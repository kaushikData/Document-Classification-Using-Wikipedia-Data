It is a [[sucker (parasitic worm anatomy)|specialised sucker]] for [[parasitism|parasitic]] [[adaptation]] in trematodes by which the worms are able to attach on the [[host (biology)|host]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Castro GA |chapter =Helminths: Structure, Classification, Growth, and Development | title= Medical Microbiology |edition=4|editor=Baron S |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8282/ |year= 1996|page= |publisher=University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston |location=Galveston (TX)| isbn=0-9631172-1-1|pmid=21413252}}&lt;/ref&gt; In annelids, it is basically a [[locomotory organ]] for attaching to a substratum.

==Etymology==

Acetabulum literally means "a small saucer for [[vinegar]]". It is derived from two [[Latin]] words ''acetum'', meaning "vinegar", and ''-bulum'', a [[suffix]] denoting "saucer" or "vessel" or "bowl". The name is used because of the saucer-like structure in the invertebrates.&lt;ref name=coll/&gt;

==Structure==

===Annelids===
[[File:Sucking leech.jpg|thumb|right| Acetabulum of leech towards the right]]
In leeches, acetabulum refers to the prominent posterior sucker at the extreme end of the body. In fact it forms a head-like structure, while the actual head is relatively small. It is a thick disc-shaped muscular system composed of circular, longitudinal and radial fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Farnesi RM, Marinelli M, Tei S, Vagnetti D |title= Morphological and ultrastructural aspects of ''Branchiobdella pentodonta'' Whit. (Annelida, Oligochaeta) suckers |year =1981 |url= | journal= J Morphol | volume= 170 | issue= 2 |pages =195–205  |pmid= 7299828 |pmc= |doi= 10.1002/jmor.1051700206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trematode===
[[File:Fasciola gigantica.png|thumb|right| On the right, eyspot-like acetabulum of ''Fasciola gigantica'']]
In flatworms, acetabulum is the ventral sucker situated towards the anterior part of the body, but behind the anterior oral sucker. It is composed of numerous spines for penetrating and gripping the host tissue. The location and structure of the acetabulum, and the pattern of the spine alignment are important diagnostic tool among trematode species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Skírnisson K, Kolářová L, Horák P, Ferté H, Jouet D |title=  Morphological features of the nasal blood fluke ''Trichobilharzia regenti'' (Schistosomatidae, Digenea) from naturally infected hosts|year =2012 |url= | journal= Parasitol Res | volume= 110 | issue=5  |pages =1881–92  |pmid= 22146993 |pmc= |doi=10.1007/s00436-011-2713-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cribb TH, Bray RA |title= A review of the Apocreadiidae Skrjabin, 1942 (Trematoda: Digenea) and description of Australian species |year = 1999|url= | journal= Syst Parasitol| volume= 44 | issue=1  |pages =1–36  |pmid= 10619071 |pmc= |doi= 10.1023/a:1006197201426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mollusc===
[[File:Octopus vulgaris.jpg|thumb|right| An octopus displaying its suckers with central cavity of acetabulum]]
Acetabulum in molluscs is a circular hollow opening on the [[tentacle|arms]]. It occupies the central portion of the sucker and surrounded by a larger spherical cavity infundibulum. Both these structures are thick muscles, and the acetabulum is specifically composed of radial muscles. They are covered with [[chitin]]ous cuticle to make a protective surface.&lt;ref name=kier&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kier WM, Smith AM |title= The structure and adhesive mechanism of octopus suckers|year =2002|url= | journal= Integr Comp Biol| volume=42 | issue= 6|pages = 1146–1153|pmid= 21680399|pmc= |doi=10.1093/icb/42.6.1146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Walla G | title=A study of the Comparative Morphology of Cephalopod Armature |url= http://www.tonmo.com/science/public/gcwalla.php |year=2007 |work= tonmo.com|publisher=Deep Intuition, LLC |accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==

Acetabulum is essentially an organ of attachment. In annelids, it is used for adherence to the substratum during a looping locomotion. Annelid worms such as leeches move by repeated alternating extensions and shortenings of the body. This in turn is done by successive attachment and detachment of the oral sucker and the acetabulum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Stern-Tomlinson W, Nusbaum MP, Perez LE, ((Kristan WB Jr)) |title=A kinematic study of crawling behavior in the leech, Hirudo medicinalis  |year =1986 |url= | journal=J Comp Physiol A | volume= 158 | issue= 4 |pages = 593–603 |pmid= 3723440 |pmc= |doi= 10.1007/bf00603803}}&lt;/ref&gt; In flukes it is used for penetrating the mucosal wall of the [[gastrointestinal tract]] for maintaining its parasitic habitat. It is sensory in nature consisting of type 2 [[sensory receptor]], which is a smooth bulb-like non-ciliated papilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Filippi JJ, Quilichini Y, Marchand B |title= Topography and ultrastructure of the tegument of ''Deropristis inflata'' Molin, 1859 (Digenea: Deropristidae), a parasite of the European eel ''Anguilla anguilla'' (Osteichthyes: Anguillidae) |year =2013 |url= | journal= Parasitol Res | volume= 112 | issue=2  |pages =517–528  |pmid= 23052788 |pmc= |doi=10.1007/s00436-012-3162-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mollusc===

Molluscans uses it for grasping substratum, [[predation|catching prey]] and for [[Animal locomotion|locommotory]] accessory. The best studied acetabular activity is that of octopus. Octopus arms contains 200-300 independently controlled suckers that can grasp small objects and produce high adhesion forces on virtually any non-porous surface. This precise mechanism of high flexibility even has a potential mechanical applications in [[robotics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Grasso FW, Setlur P |title= Inspiration, simulation and design for smart robot manipulators from the sucker actuation mechanism of cephalopods|year =2007|url= | journal= Bioinspir Biomim| volume=2 | issue=4|page = S170-181|pmid=18037726 |pmc= |doi=10.1088/1748-3182/2/4/s06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Laschi C, Mazzolai B, Mattoli V, Cianchetti M, Dario P |title= Design of a biomimetic robotic octopus arm|year =2009|url= | journal= Bioinspir Biomim| volume=4 | issue=1|page = 015006|pmid=19258690 |pmc= |doi=10.1088/1748-3182/4/1/015006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each sucker is a [[tactile sensor]] for detecting the surrounding. When the sucker attaches itself on an object, the infundibulum maily provides adhesion while the central acetabulum is quite free. This provides greater suction on the flat surface; hence, making pressure incredibly low. This is why octopus grip is exceptionally firm. Then contraction of the radial muscle of the acetabulum causes detachment of the entire sucker.&lt;ref name=kier/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Octopuses &amp; Relatives | title=Learn about octopuses &amp; relatives: locomotion | url=http://www.asnailsodyssey.com/LEARNABOUT/OCTOPUS/octoLoco.php | work=asnailsodyssey.com | publisher= | accessdate=2013-06-08 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522005231/http://www.asnailsodyssey.com/LEARNABOUT/OCTOPUS/octoLoco.php | archive-date=2013-05-22 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7901">'''Approximate computing''' is a computation technique which returns a possibly inaccurate result rather than a guaranteed accurate result, and can be used for applications where an approximate result is sufficient for its purpose.&lt;ref name="surveyACT"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mittal|first1=Sparsh|title=A Survey of Techniques for Approximate Computing|journal=ACM Comput. Surv.|date=May 2016|volume=48|issue=4|pages=62:1–62:33|doi=10.1145/2893356|publisher=ACM|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Sampson, et al. "[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1993518 EnerJ: Approximate data types for safe and general low-power computation]", In ACM SIGPLAN Notices, vol. 46, no. 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; One example of such situation is for a search engine where no exact answer may exist for a certain search query and hence, many answers may be acceptable. Similarly, occasional dropping of some [[Frame (video)|frames]] in a video application can go undetected due to perceptual limitations of humans. Approximate computing is based on the observation that in many scenarios, although performing exact computation requires large amount of resources, allowing [[Approximation theory|bounded approximation]] can provide disproportionate gains in performance and energy, while still achieving acceptable result accuracy.{{clarify|date=January 2016}}  For example, in [[k-means clustering|''k''-means clustering]] algorithm, allowing only 5% loss in classification accuracy can provide 50 times energy saving compared to the fully accurate classification.&lt;ref name="surveyACT"/&gt;

The key requirement in approximate computing is that approximation can be introduced only in non-critical data, since approximating critical data (e.g., control operations) can lead to disastrous consequences, such as [[program crash]] or erroneous output.

==Strategies==
Several strategies can be used for performing approximate computing.

; Approximate circuits
: Approximate [[Adder (electronics)|adders]],&lt;ref&gt;J. Echavarria, et al. "FAU: Fast and Error-Optimized Approximate Adder Units on LUT-Based FPGAs", FPT, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Miao, et al. "Modeling and synthesis of quality-energy optimal approximate adders", ICCAD, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[Binary multiplier|multipliers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rehman|first=Semeen|last2=El-Harouni|first2=Walaa|last3=Shafique|first3=Muhammad|last4=Kumar|first4=Akash|last5=Henkel|first5=Jörg|date=2016-11-07|title=Architectural-space exploration of approximate multipliers|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2966986.2967005|publisher=ACM|pages=80|doi=10.1145/2966986.2967005|isbn=9781450344661}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[logical circuit]]s can reduce hardware overhead.&lt;ref&gt;S. Venkataramani, et al. "SALSA: systematic logic synthesis of approximate circuits", DAC, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Miao, et al. "Approximate logic synthesis under general error magnitude and frequency constraints", ICCAD, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Hegde et al. "Energy-efficient signal processing via algorithmic noise-tolerance", ISLPED, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an approximate multi-bit adder can ignore the [[carry chain]] and thus, allow all its sub-adders to perform addition operation in parallel.
; Approximate storage
: Instead of [[Computer data storage|storing data]] values exactly, they can be stored approximately, e.g., by [[Data truncation|truncating]] the lower-bits in [[floating point]] data. Another method is accept less reliable memory. For this, in [[DRAM]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raha|first=A.|last2=Sutar|first2=S.|last3=Jayakumar|first3=H.|last4=Raghunathan|first4=V.|date=July 2017|title=Quality Configurable Approximate DRAM|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7784741/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Computers|volume=66|issue=7|pages=1172–1187|doi=10.1109/TC.2016.2640296|issn=0018-9340}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[eDRAM]], [[refresh rate]] can be lowered and in [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]], supply voltage can be lowered. In general, any [[error detection and correction]] mechanisms should be disabled.
; Software-level approximation
: There are several ways to approximate at software level. [[Memoization]] can be applied. Some [[iteration]]s of [[Loop (computing)|loops]] can be skipped (termed as [[loop perforation]]) to achieve a result faster. Some tasks can also be skipped, for example when a run-time condition suggests that those tasks are not going to be useful ([[task skipping]]). [[Monte Carlo algorithm]]s and [[Randomized algorithm]]s trade correctness for execution time guarantees&lt;ref&gt;C.Alippi, Intelligence for Embedded Systems: a Methodological approach,  Springer, 2014, pp. 283&lt;/ref&gt;. The computation can be reformulated according to paradigms that allow easily the acceleration on specialized hardware, e.g. a neural processing unit.&lt;ref&gt;H. Esmaeilzadeh, et al. "Neural acceleration for general-purpose approximate programs", MICRO, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
; Approximate system 
: In an approximate system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raha|first=Arnab|last2=Raghunathan|first2=Vijay|date=2017|title=Towards Full-System Energy-Accuracy Tradeoffs: A Case Study of An Approximate Smart Camera System|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3061639.3062333|journal=Proceedings of the 54th Annual Design Automation Conference 2017|series=DAC '17|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=74:1–74:6|doi=10.1145/3061639.3062333|isbn=9781450349277}}&lt;/ref&gt;, different subsystems of the system such as the processor, memory, sensor, and communication modules are synergistically approximated to obtain a much better system-level Q-E trade-off curve compared to individual approximations to each of the subsystems.

==Application areas==
Approximate computing has been used in a variety of domains where the applications are error-tolerant, such as [[multimedia]] processing, [[machine learning]], [[signal processing]], [[Computational science|scientific computing]], etc. Google is using this approach in their [[Tensor processing unit]]s (TPU, a custom ASIC).

==Derived paradigms==
The main issue in approximate computing is the identification of the section of the application that can be approximated. In the case of large scale applications, it is very common to find people holding the expertise on approximate computing techniques not having enough expertise on the application domain (and vice versa). In order to solve this problem, [[programming paradigm]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nguyen|first1=Donald|last2=Lenharth|first2=Andrew|last3=Pingali|first3=Keshav|title=A lightweight infrastructure for graph analytics|journal=Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth ACM Symposium on Operating Systems Principles|date=2013|pages=456–471|publisher=ACM|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Silvano|first1=Cristina|last2=Agosta|first2=Giovanni|last3=Cherubin|first3=Stefano|last4=Gadioli|first4=Davide|last5=Palermo|first5=Gianluca|last6=Bartolini|first6=Andrea|last7=Benini|first7=Luca|last8=Martinovič|first8=Jan|last9=Palkovič|first9=Martin|last10=Slaninová|first10=Kateřina|last11=Bispo|first11=João|last12=Cardoso|first12=João M.

They all have in common the clear role separation between application [[programmer]] and application [[domain expert]]. These approaches allow the spread of the most common [[Program optimization|optimizations]] and approximate computing techniques.

An '''archaeophyte''' is a [[plant]] species which is non-native to a geographical region, but which was an [[introduced species]] in "ancient" times, rather than being a modern introduction. Those arriving after are called [[Neophyte (botany)|neophyte]]s. In Britain, archaeophytes are considered to be those species first introduced prior to 1492, when [[Christopher Columbus]] arrived in the [[New World]] and the [[Columbian Exchange]] began.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Preston |first=Christopher D. |last2=Pearman |first2=David A. |last3=Hall |first3=Allan R. |date=1 July 2004 |title=Archaeophytes in Britain |url=https://academic.oup.com/botlinnean/article/145/3/257/2420246 |journal=[[Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society]] |language=en |volume=145 |issue=3 |pages=257–294 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2004.00284.x |issn=0024-4074 |access-date=2018-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306102951/https://academic.oup.com/botlinnean/article/145/3/257/2420246 |archive-date=2018-03-06 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astroecology'''  concerns the interactions of [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] with [[space]] environments. It studies resources for [[life]] on [[planet]]s, [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s, around various [[star]]s, in [[Galaxy|galaxies]], and in the [[universe]].  The results allow estimating the future prospects for life, from [[planet]]ary to [[galaxy|galactic]] and [[cosmology|cosmological]] scales.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002"&gt;{{Citation |last=Mautner |first=Michael N. |title = Planetary Bioresources and Astroecology. 1.

==Overview==
The term "astroecology" was first applied in the context of performing studies in actual [[meteorite]]s to evaluate their potential resources favorable to sustaining life.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002" /&gt; Early results showed that meteorite/asteroid materials can support [[microorganisms]], [[algae]] and [[plant]] cultures under Earth's atmosphere and supplemented with water.

Several observations suggest that diverse planetary materials, similar to meteorites collected on Earth, could be used as agricultural soils, as they provide nutrients to support microscopic life when supplemented with water and an atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002"/&gt; Experimental astroecology has been proposed to rate planetary materials as targets for astrobiology exploration and as potential biological in-situ resources.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002"/&gt; The biological fertilities of planetary materials can be assessed by measuring water-extractable [[electrolyte]] nutrients. The results suggest that [[carbonaceous asteroid]]s and Martian [[basalt]]s can serve as potential future resources for substantial biological populations in the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002"/&gt;

Analysis of the essential [[nutrient]]s ([[carbon|C]], [[Nitrogen|N]], [[Phosphorus|P]], [[Potassium|K]]) in meteorites yielded information for calculating the amount of [[biomass]] that can be constructed from asteroid resources.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002" /&gt; For example, [[carbonaceous asteroid]]s are estimated to contain about 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; kg potential resource materials,&lt;ref name ="Lewis-1997"&gt;{{Citation |last=Lewis |first=J.S |author-link=J.

==Cultures on simulated asteroid/meteorite materials==
To quantify the potential amounts of life in biospheres, theoretical astroecology attempts to estimate the amount of biomass over the duration of a [[biosphere]]. The resources, and the potential time-integrated biomass were estimated for [[planetary system]]s, for [[habitable zone]]s around [[stars]], and for the [[galaxy]] and the [[universe]].&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; Such astroecology calculations suggest that the limiting elements [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] in the estimated 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; kg carbonaceous asteroids could support 6·10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; kg biomass for the expected five billion future years of the [[Sun]], yielding a future time-integrated ''BIOTA'' (''BIOTA'', '''B'''iomass '''I'''ntegrated '''O'''ver '''T'''imes '''A'''vailable, measured in kilogram-years) of 3·10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years in the Solar System,&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; a hundred thousand times more than life on Earth to date. Considering biological requirements of 100 W kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; biomass, radiated energy about [[red giant]] stars and [[White dwarf|white]] and [[red dwarf]] stars could support a time-integrated ''BIOTA'' up to 10&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years in the galaxy and 10&lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years in the universe.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;

Such astroecology considerations quantify the immense potentials of future life in space, with commensurate [[biodiversity]] and possibly, [[intelligence]].&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; [[Chemical analysis]] of [[carbonaceous chondrite]] meteorites show that they contain extractable bioavailable [[water]], [[organic carbon]], and essential [[phosphate]], [[nitrate]] and [[potassium]] nutrients.&lt;ref name = 'nine'&gt;{{Citation | last = Jarosewich | first = E.| title = Chemical Analysis of the Murchison Meteorite | journal = Meteoritics | volume = 1 | pages = 49–52 | year = 1973 | bibcode = 1971Metic...6...49J | doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.1971.tb00406.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'ninea'&gt;{{Citation | last = Fuchs | first = L.H.| last2 = Olsen |first2 = E. |  last3 = Jensen | first3 = K.J. | title = Mineralogy, Mineral Chemistry and Composition of the Murchison (CM2) Meteorite | journal = Smithsonian Contributions to the Earth Sciences | volume = 10 | pages = 1–84 | year = 1973 | doi=10.5479/si.00810274.10.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'ten' &gt;{{Citation | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title = Planetary Resources and Astroecology.

Laboratory experiments showed that material from the [[Murchison meteorite]], when ground into a fine powder and combined with Earth's water and air, can provide the nutrients to support a variety of organisms including bacteria ([[Nocardia asteroides]]), algae, and plant cultures such as potato and asparagus.&lt;ref name = 'ten' /&gt; The microorganisms used organics in the carbonaceous meteorites as the carbon source. Algae and plant cultures grew well also on Mars meteorites because of their high bio-available phosphate contents.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002" /&gt; The Martian materials achieved soil fertility ratings comparable to productive agricultural soils.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002" /&gt; This offers some data relating to [[terraforming of Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Olsson-Francis | first1 = K  | last2 = Cockell | first2 = CS | title = Use of cyanobacteria in in-situ resource use in space applications | journal = Planetary and Space Science | volume = 58 | pages = 1279–1285 | year = 2010 | bibcode = 2010P&amp;SS...58.1279O | doi = 10.1016/j.pss.2010.05.005 | issue = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrestrial analogues of planetary materials are also used in such experiments for comparison, and to test the effects of space conditions on microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Billi | first1 = D | last2 = Viaggiu | first2 = E | last3 = Cockell | first3 = CS | last4= Rabbow | first4 = E | last5 = Horneck | first5 = G | last6 = Onofri | first6 = S | title = Damage escape and repair in dried Chroococcidiopsis spp. from hot and cold deserts exposed to simulated space and martian conditions | journal = [[Astrobiology (journal)|Astrobiology]] | volume = 11 | pages = 65–73 | year = 2010 | bibcode = 2011AsBio..11...65B | doi = 10.1089/ast.2009.0430 | pmid=21294638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biomass that can be constructed from resources can be calculated by comparing the concentration of elements in the resource materials and in biomass (Equation 1).&lt;ref name="Mautner-2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; A given mass of resource materials (''m&lt;sub&gt;resource&lt;/sub&gt;'')  can support ''m&lt;sub&gt;biomass, X&lt;/sub&gt;'' of biomass containing element ''X'' (considering ''X'' as the limiting nutrient), where ''c&lt;sub&gt;resource, X&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the concentration (mass per unit mass) of element ''X'' in the resource material and ''c&lt;sub&gt;biomass, X&lt;/sub&gt;'' is its concentration in the biomass.

&lt;math&gt;m_{biomass,\, X} = m_{resource,\, X} \frac{c_{resource,\, X}}{c_{biomass,\, X}}&lt;/math&gt;  (1)

Assuming that 100,000&amp;nbsp;kg biomass supports one human, the asteroids may then sustain about 6e15 (six million billion) people, equal to a million Earths (a million times the present population).{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Similar materials in the comets could support biomass and populations about one hundred times larger.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} [[Solar energy]] can sustain these populations for the predicted further five billion years of the Sun. These considerations yield a maximum time-integrated ''BIOTA'' of 3e30 kg-years in the Solar System. After the Sun becomes a white dwarf star,&lt;ref name = 'sixteen'&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Adams | first1 = F. | last2 = Laughlin | first2 = G. | title = The Five Ages of the Universe | publisher = Touchstone Books, New York | year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other white dwarf stars, can provide energy for life much longer, for trillions of eons.&lt;ref name = 'seventeen'&gt;{{Citation | doi = 10.1006/icar.2001.6591 | last1 = Ribicky | first1 = K.

==Effects of wastage==
Astroecology also concerns wastage, such as the leakage of biological matter into space. This will cause an exponential decay of space-based biomass&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; as given by Equation (2), where M (biomass 0) is the mass of the original biomass, ''k'' is its rate of decay (the fraction lost in a unit time) and ''biomass t'' is the remaining biomass after time ''t''. 
			
:Equation 2:  &lt;math&gt;M_{biomass}(t) = M_{biomass} (0) e^{-kt}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Integration from time zero to infinity yields Equation (3) for the total time-integrated biomass (''BIOTA'') contributed by this biomass:

:Equation 3:  &lt;math&gt;BIOTA  = \frac{M_{biomass} (0)}{k}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, if 0.01% of the biomass is lost per year, then the time-integrated ''BIOTA'' will be 10,000&lt;math&gt;M_{biomass} (0)&lt;/math&gt;. For the 6·10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; kg biomass constructed from asteroid resources, this yields 6·10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years of ''BIOTA'' in the Solar System. Even with this small rate of loss, life in the Solar System would disappear in a few hundred thousand years, and the potential total time-integrated ''BIOTA'' of 3·10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years under the main-sequence Sun would decrease by a factor of 5·10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, although a still substantial population of 1.2·10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; biomass-supported humans could exist through the habitable lifespan of the Sun.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; 
The integrated biomass can be maximized by minimizing its rate of dissipation. If this rate can be reduced sufficiently, all the constructed biomass can last for the duration of the habitat and it pays to construct the biomass as fast as possible. However, if the rate of dissipation is significant, the construction rate of the biomass and its steady-state amounts may be reduced allowing a steady-state biomass and population that  lasts throughout the lifetime of the habitat.

An issue that arises is whether we should build immense amounts of life that decays fast, or smaller, but still large, populations that last longer. Life-centered biotic ethics suggests that life should last as long as possible.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2009" /&gt;

==Galactic ecology==
If life reaches galactic proportions, [[technology]] should be able to access all of the materials resources, and sustainable life will be defined by the available energy.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt; The maximum amount of biomass about any star is then determined by the energy requirements of the biomass and by the [[luminosity]] of the star.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; For example, if 1&amp;nbsp;kg biomass needs 100 Watts, we can calculate the steady-state amounts of biomass that can be sustained by stars with various energy outputs. These amounts are multiplied by the life-time of the star to calculate the time-integrated ''BIOTA'' over the life-time of the star.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt; Using similar projections, the potential amounts of future life can then be quantified.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;

For the Solar System from its origins to the present, the current  10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; kg biomass over the past four billion years gives a time-integrated biomass (''BIOTA'') of 4·10&lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years. In comparison, carbon, [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]] and water in the 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; kg asteroids allows 6·10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; kg biomass that can be sustained with energy for the 5 billion future years of the Sun, giving a ''BIOTA'' of 3·10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years in the Solar System and 3·10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years about  10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; stars in the galaxy. Materials in comets could give biomass and time-integrated ''BIOTA'' a hundred times larger. &lt;!--In space colonies? Certainly not on the outer planets as we know them. Lots of assumptions are loaded in this statement, when the research was limited to water-soluble chemicals: After the Sun turns into a red giant, life in the outer Solar System can contribute significant further biomass for a billion years.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt; --&gt;

The Sun will then become a [[white dwarf]] star, radiating 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Watts that sustains 1e13 kg biomass for an immense hundred million trillion (10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;) years, contributing a time-integrated ''BIOTA'' of 10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; years. The 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; white dwarfs that may exist in the galaxy during this time can then contribute a time-integrated ''BIOTA'' of 10&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years. Red dwarf stars with luminosities of 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; Watts and life-times of 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; years can contribute 10&lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years each, and 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; red dwarfs can contribute 10&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years, while [[brown dwarf]]s can contribute 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years of time-integrated biomass (''BIOTA'') in the galaxy. In total, the energy output of stars during 10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; years can sustain a time-integrated biomass of about 10&lt;sup&gt;45&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years in the galaxy. This is one billion trillion (10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;) times more life than has existed on the Earth to date. In the universe, stars in 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; galaxies could then sustain 10&lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years of life.

&lt;!--This section is little more than a though experiment: contemplating the spontaneous conversion of all atoms (barionic matter) in the universe to living matter. No use in Wikipedia.
==Potential life in the universe==
It is of interest to estimate the maximum amount of potential life in this universe. This would be achieved if all the [[baryonic matter]] was converted to living matter. However, life requires energy, and a fraction of this mass would then need to be converted to energy to sustain life.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt;  Assume that the power requirement is &lt;math&gt;P_{biomass}&lt;/math&gt; (measured in J sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) and the energy yield is ''E&lt;sub&gt;yield&lt;/sub&gt;'') (measured in J kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;). If the biomass is converted to energy at the rate required to provide the needed power for the remaining biomass, then the rate of decrease of biomass is given by equation&lt;ref name="Weber-1985" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{d M_{biomass}}{d t} E_{yield, biomass} = P_{biomass} M_{biomass}&lt;/math&gt; (4)

This is similar to equation (3) with a rate of loss &lt;math&gt;k_{waste} =  P_{biomass}{E_{yield, biomass}}&lt;/math&gt;. The remaining biomass after time ''t'' is given according to Equation (5) as:

With an energy requirement of 100 W kg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; biomass and with the maximum energy yield of ''E = mc&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' a fraction of 3.5·10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; of the biomass per year would need to be converted to energy, yielding about 3·10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years of time-integrated BIOTA per kg biomass. An estimated 10&lt;sup&gt;41&lt;/sup&gt; kg baryonic matter in the galaxy and 10&lt;sup&gt;52&lt;/sup&gt; kg in the universe, all converted to biomass, would then yield 3·10&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years of time-integrated biomass in the galaxy and 3·10&lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt; kg-years of time-integrated biomass in the universe.&lt;ref name="Mautner-2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mautner-2000" /&gt;

If all the biomass consisted of 100&amp;nbsp;kg humans, this would allow 10&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt; humans in the galaxy living 3·10&lt;sup&gt;46&lt;/sup&gt; human-years and 10&lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt; human-years in the universe. This illustrates the immense potential amounts of biological and human life in the universe.

'''''Authors of Plant Names''''' ('''Brummitt &amp; Powell''') by [[Richard Kenneth Brummitt]] and [[C. E.

The [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN) governs the naming of these organisms, and suggests that a taxon be fully identified by its name and the author, but does not require that abbreviations be used when citing an author for a taxon. When abbreviations are used, the ICN recommends that Brummitt &amp; Powell’s ''Authors of plant names'' (1992), and the websites, the International Plant Names Index (www.ipni.org) and the [[Index Fungorum]] (www.indexfungorum.org) can be used to find "unambiguous" abbreviations.&lt;ref name="MelbourneCode"&gt;{{Citation |year=2012 |editor-last=McNeill |editor-first=J. |editor2-last=Barrie |editor2-first=F.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7305">In [[biochemistry]], '''avidity''' refers to the accumulated strength of ''multiple'' affinities of individual [[non-covalent]] binding interactions, such as between a protein receptor and its ligand, and is commonly referred to as functional affinity. As such, avidity is distinct from [[chemical affinity|affinity]], which describes the strength of a ''single'' interaction. However, because individual binding events increase the likelihood of other interactions to occur (i.e. increase the local concentration of each binding partner in proximity to the binding site), avidity should not be thought of as the mere sum of its constituent affinities but as the combined effect of all affinities participating in the biomolecular interaction. A particular important aspect relates to the phenomenon of 'avidity entropy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kitov PI, Bundle DR |title=On the nature of the multivalency effect: a thermodynamic model |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |volume=125 |issue=52 |pages=16271–84 |year=2003 |pmid=14692768 |doi=10.1021/ja038223n }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biomolecules often form heterogenous complexes or homogeneous [[oligomer]]s and multimers or [[polymer]]s. If clustered proteins form an organized matrix, such as the [[clathrin]]-coat, the interaction is a described as [[matricity]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

==Antibody-antigen interaction==
Avidity is commonly applied to [[antibody]] interactions in which multiple antigen-binding sites simultaneously interact with the target [[antigen]]ic [[epitope]]s, often in multimerized structures. Individually, each binding interaction may be readily broken; however, when many binding interactions are present at the same time, transient unbinding of a single site does not allow the molecule to diffuse away, and binding of that weak interaction is likely to be restored.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

Each antibody has at least two antigen-binding sites, therefore antibodies are bivalent to multivalent. Avidity (functional affinity) is the accumulated strength of multiple affinities.&lt;ref name="pmid19409036"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rudnick SI, Adams GP |title=Affinity and avidity in antibody-based tumor targeting |journal=Cancer Biotherapy &amp; Radiopharmaceuticals |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=155–61 |year=2009 |pmid=19409036 |pmc=2902227 |doi=10.1089/cbr.2009.0627 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[IgM]] is said to have low affinity but high avidity because it has 10 weak binding sites for antigen as opposed to the 2 stronger binding sites of [[IgG]], [[IgE]] and [[IgD]] with higher single binding affinities.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Affinity===
Binding affinity is a measure of dynamic equilibrium of the ratio of on-rate (k&lt;sub&gt;on&lt;/sub&gt;) and off-rate (k&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;) under specific concentrations of reactants. The affinity constant, [[Equilibrium constant|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;]], is the inverse of the dissociation constant, [[Dissociation constant|K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The strength of complex formation in solution is related to the [[stability constants of complexes]], however in case of large biomolecules, such as [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]-[[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] pairs, their interaction is also dependent on other structural and thermodynamic properties of reactants plus their orientation and immobilization.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

There are several [[methods to investigate protein–protein interactions]] existing with differences in immobilization of each reactant in 2D or 3D orientation. The measured affinities are stored in public databases, such as the [[Ki Database]] and [[BindingDB]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} As an example, affinity is the binding strength between the complex structures of the [[epitope]] of antigenic determinant and [[paratope]] of antigen-binding site of an antibody. Participating non-covalent interactions may include [[hydrogen bond]]s, [[ionic bond|electrostatic bond]]s, [[van der Waals force]]s and [[hydrophobic effect|hydrophobic force]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Charles A |last1=Janeway |first2=Paul |last2=Travers |first3=Mark |last3=Walport |first4=Mark J |last4=Shlomchik |page=104 |year=2001 |title=Immunobiology |edition=5th |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10757/ |location=New York |publisher=Garland Science |isbn=0-8153-3642-X }}{{page needed|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calculation of binding affinity for bimolecular reaction (1 antibody binding site per 1 antigen):

:&lt;chem&gt;[Ab] + [Ag] &lt;=&gt; [AbAg]&lt;/chem&gt;

where [Ab] is the [[antibody]] concentration and [Ag] is the [[antigen]] concentration, either in free ([Ab],[Ag]) or bound ([AbAg]) state.

calculation of association constant (or [[equilibrium constant]]):   
:&lt;math chem&gt;K_a = \frac{k_\ce{on}}{k_\ce{off}} = \frac\ce{[AbAg]}\ce{[Ab][Ag]}&lt;/math&gt;

calculation of dissociation constant:  
:&lt;math chem&gt;K_d = \frac{k_\ce{off}}{k_\ce{on}} = \frac\ce{[Ab][Ag]}\ce{[AbAg]}&lt;/math&gt;

==Application==
Avidity tests for [[rubella virus]], ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV), [[varicella-zoster virus]], human immunodeficiency virus ([[HIV]]), [[viral hepatitis|hepatitis viruses]], [[Epstein-Barr virus]], and others were developed a few years ago. These tests help to distinguish acute, recurrent or past infection by avidity of marker-specific [[IgG]]. Currently there are two avidity assays in use. These are the well known chaotropic (conventional) assay and the recently developed AVIcomp (avidity competition) assay.&lt;ref name="pmid19129411"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Curdt I, Praast G, Sickinger E, Schultess J, Herold I, Braun HB, Bernhardt S, Maine GT, Smith DD, Hsu S, Christ HM, Pucci D, Hausmann M, Herzogenrath J |title=Development of fully automated determination of marker-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) avidity based on the avidity competition assay format: application for Abbott Architect cytomegalovirus and Toxo IgG Avidity assays |journal=Journal of Clinical Microbiology |volume=47 |issue=3 |pages=603–13 |year=2009 |pmid=19129411 |pmc=2650902 |doi=10.1128/JCM.01076-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:15 bars multirest.png|thumb|Fifteen bar [[multirest]]]]

In [[musical notation]], a '''bar''' (or '''measure''') is a segment of time corresponding to a specific number of [[beat (music)|beats]] in which each beat is represented by a particular note value and the boundaries of the bar are indicated by vertical '''bar lines'''. Dividing music into bars provides regular reference points to pinpoint locations within a musical composition. It also makes written music easier to follow, since each bar of staff symbols can be read and played as a batch.&lt;ref name=ChordWizard&gt;{{cite web|last=ChordWizard Software|title=www.howmusicworks.org|url=http://www.howmusicworks.org/504/Meter-and-Rhythm/BarMeasure-Divisions|accessdate=11 September 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709024021/http://www.howmusicworks.org/504/Meter-and-Rhythm/BarMeasure-Divisions|archivedate=9 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a piece consists of several bars of the same length, and in [[modern musical symbols|modern musical notation]] the number of beats in each bar is specified at the beginning of the score by the  [[time signature]].  In [[time signature#Simple vs. compound|simple time]], (such as {{music|time|3|4}}), the top figure indicates the number of beats per bar, while the bottom number indicates the note value of the beat (the beat has a [[quarter note]] value in the {{music|time|3|4}} example).

The word ''bar'' is more common in [[British English]], and the word ''measure'' is more common in [[Comparison of American and British English|American English]], although musicians generally understand both usages. In American English, although the words ''bar'' and ''measure'' are often used interchangeably, the correct use of the word 'bar' refers only to the vertical line itself, while the word 'measure' refers to the beats ''contained between bars''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gardner Read|Read, Gardner]]. (1979) ''Music Notation: A Manual of Modern Practice'', 2nd ed., New York: Taplinger Publishing Company, p.183.&lt;/ref&gt; In international usage, it is equally correct to speak of ''bar numbers'' and ''measure numbers'', e.g. ‘bars 9–16’ or ‘mm. 9–16’. Along the same lines, it is wise{{cn|date=January 2018}} to reserve the abbreviated form ‘bb. 3–4’ etc. for beats only; ''bars'' should be referred to by name in full.

The first metrically complete bar within a piece of music is called ‘bar 1’ or ‘m. 1’. When the piece begins with an [[anacrusis]] (an incomplete bar at the head of a piece of music), ‘bar 1’ or ‘m. 1’ is the following bar.

==Bar==
Originally, the word ''bar'' came from the vertical lines drawn through the staff to mark off metrical units and not the bar-like (i.e., rectangular) dimensions of a typical measure of music. In British English, these vertical lines  are called ''bar'', too, but often the term ''bar line'' is used in order to make the distinction clear. A ''double bar line'' (or ''double bar'') can consist of two single bar lines drawn close together, separating two [[Musical form|sections]] within a piece, or a bar line followed by a thicker bar line, indicating the end of a piece or movement. Note that ''double bar'' refers not to a type of ''bar'' (i.e., measure), but to a type of ''bar line''. Another term for the bar line denoting the end of a piece of music is ''music end''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dolmetsch.com/musicalsymbols.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208020519/http://dolmetsch.com/musicalsymbols.htm |archivedate=2007-02-08 |df= }} − Chart of Musical Symbols&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''[[repeat sign]]'' (or, ''repeat bar line''&lt;ref&gt;Nickol, Peter (2008). ''Learning to Read Music'', p.105. {{ISBN|1-84528-278-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) looks like the music end, but it has two dots, one above the other, indicating that the section of music that is before is to be repeated. The beginning of the repeated passage can be marked by a ''begin-repeat sign''; if this is absent the repeat is understood to be from the beginning of the piece or movement. This begin-repeat sign, if appearing at the beginning of a staff, does not act as a bar line because no bar is before it; its only function is to indicate the beginning of the passage to be repeated.

In music with a regular [[Metre (music)|meter]], bars function to indicate a periodic [[accent (music)|accent]] in the music, regardless of its duration. In music employing [[Time signature|mixed meters]], bar lines are instead used to indicate the beginning of rhythmic note groups, but this is subject to wide variation: some composers use dashed bar lines, others (including [[Hugo Distler]]) have placed bar lines at different places in the different parts to indicate varied groupings from part to part.

[[Igor Stravinsky]] said of bar lines:

{{Quote|The bar line is much, much more than a mere accent, and I don't believe that it can be simulated by an accent, at least not in my music.&lt;ref&gt;Winold, Allen (1975). "Rhythm in Twentieth-Century Music", ''Aspects of Twentieth-Century Music''. Wittlich, Gary (ed.). Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice–Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-049346-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bars and bar lines also indicate grouping: [[rhythm]]ically of beats within and between bars, within and between [[phrase (music)|phrases]], and on higher levels such as meter.

==History==

The earliest barlines, used in keyboard and [[vihuela]] music in the 15th and 16th centuries, didn't reflect a regular [[meter (music)|meter]] at all but were only section divisions, or in some cases marked off every beat.

Barlines began to be introduced into ensemble music in the late 16th century but continued to be used irregularly for a time. Not until the mid-17th century were barlines used in the modern style with every measure being the same length, and they began to be associated with time signatures.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Dictionary of Music, Second ed. (1972), "Barline"&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern editions of early music that was originally notated without barlines sometimes use a [[mensurstrich]] as a compromise.

== Hypermeasure ==
&lt;!--[[Hypermeasure]] redirects directly here.--&gt;
&lt;!--this image displayed wider than 400px for clarity--&gt;
[[Image:Hypermeter.png|thumb|center|450px|Hypermeter: 4 beat measure, 4 measure hypermeasure, and 4 hypermeasure verses. Hyperbeats in red.]]

A '''hypermeasure''', large-scale or high-level measure, or measure-group is a [[meter (music)|metric unit]] in which, generally, each regular measure is one beat (actually [[Beat (music)#Hyperbeat|hyperbeat]]) of a larger meter. Thus a beat is to a measure as a measure/hyperbeat is to a hypermeasure. Hypermeasures must be larger than a notated bar, perceived as a unit, consist of a pattern of strong and weak beats, and along with adjacent hypermeasures, which must be of the same length, create a sense of [[hypermeter]]. The term was coined by [[Edward T. Cone]] in ''Musical Form and Musical Performance'' (New York: Norton, 1968),&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Deborah (2005). ''Engaging Music: Essays in Music Analysis'', p.18-19 and "Glossary", p.329. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-517010-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is similar to the less formal notion of a [[Phrase (music)|phrase]].

The '''Boveri–Sutton chromosome theory''' (also known as the '''chromosome theory of inheritance''' or the '''Sutton–Boveri theory''') is a fundamental unifying theory of [[genetics]] which identifies [[chromosome]]s as the carriers of [[genes|genetic material]].&lt;ref name=GNN&gt;[http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/resources/timeline/1902_Boveri_Sutton.php 1902: Theodor Boveri (1862-1915) and Walter Sutton (1877-1916) propose that chromosomes bear hereditary factors in accordance with Mendelian laws] Genetics and Genomics Timeline.

It also states that chromosomes are linear structures with [[gene]]s located at specific sites called [[Locus (genetics)|loci]] along them.&lt;ref name=holmgren/&gt;

It states simply that chromosomes, which are seen in all dividing cells and pass from one generation to the next, are the basis for all genetic inheritance.
Over a period of time random mutation
creates changes in the DNA sequence of a gene. Genes are located on chromosomes.

The chromosome theory of inheritance is credited to papers by [[Walter Sutton]] in 1902&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, W.S. (1902).

Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, pp. 27-41.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to independent work by [[Theodor Boveri]] during roughly the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Boveri, T.H. (1904). Ergebnisse über die Konstitution der chromatischen Substanz des Zelkerns. Fisher, Jena.&lt;/ref&gt; Boveri was studying [[sea urchin]]s, in which he found that all the chromosomes had to be present for proper [[embryonic development]] to take place. Sutton's work with [[grasshopper]]s showed that chromosomes occur in matched pairs of maternal and paternal chromosomes which separate during meiosis and "may constitute the physical basis of the Mendelian law of heredity".&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, W.S. (1902), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

This groundbreaking work led [[Edmund Beecher Wilson|E.B. Wilson]] in his classic text to name the chromosome theory of inheritance the "Sutton-Boveri Theory".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, E.B. (1925). ''The Cell in Development and Heredity'', 3rd edition. Macmillan, New York. p. 923.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was close to both men, since the young Sutton was his student and the prominent Boveri was his friend (in fact, Wilson dedicated the afore-mentioned book to Boveri). Although the naming precedence is now often reversed to "Boveri-Sutton", there are some who argue that Boveri didn't actually articulate the theory until 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, L.A.-C.P. (1999). [http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=s1415-47571999000200022&amp;script=sci_arttext Did Sutton and Boveri propose the so-called Sutton-Boveri chromosome hypothesis?] Genet. Mol. Biol. [online]. Vol.22, n.2, pp. 261-272 [Retrieved 2011-03-03].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verification==
The proposal that chromosomes carried the factors of Mendelian inheritance was initially controversial, but in 1913 it gained strong support when [[Eleanor Carothers]] documented definitive evidence of [[independent assortment]] of chromosomes in a species of grasshopper.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, E.W. and Crow, J. F.  [http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/full/160/1/1 100 Years Ago: Walter Sutton and the Chromosome Theory of Heredity] ''Genetics,'' Vol. 160, 1-4, January 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Debate continued, however, until 1915 when [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]]'s work on inheritance and [[genetic linkage]] in the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' provided incontrovertible evidence for the proposal.&lt;ref name=GNN/&gt;&lt;ref name=mader/&gt; The unifying theory stated that inheritance patterns may be generally explained by assuming that genes are located in specific sites on chromosomes.

To comply with the [[Building Act 1984]] and the subsequent [[statutory instrument]]s known as the [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building Regulations]], '''Building regulations approval''' is required to construct certain structures in England and Wales. Construction projects falling into this category are sometimes referred to as "notifiable", however this is different from the "notification" (which may also be required under the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015, which seeks to monitor health and safety in construction projects.

The rules vary for Scotland and Northern Ireland, but elsewhere [[Building regulations in the United Kingdom|Building Regulations]] approval can usually be obtained by application to a [[building control body]] (BCB), of which there are two types: [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local Authority]] BCBs (usually a council's building control department) and private BCBs (known as Approved Inspectors). If an Approved Inspector is used, before any controlled building work can start on site they must inform the local authority about the work. This is called giving an 'initial notice'.  This notice states that a particular Approved Inspector is the BCB for the specified works, at the specified location.

If using a local authority, approval can be obtained in 1 of 3 ways:-

==1. Full Plans==
By the "full plans" method where drawings are deposited with the Local Authority and are subsequently checked for compliance with the Building Regulations.

The various stages of the work are also inspected and checked for compliance with the relevant technical requirements of the Building Regulations; by a Building Control Surveyor employed by the Local Authority.

This is the most thorough option. And a response from the Local Authority will typically take 4–8 weeks. However, unlike [[planning permission]], work may start before approval has been granted. It is also quite usual for the final building to differ in some respects to that which received full plans approval, in which case amended "as built" plans are often required to be submitted to the Local Authority.
A "completion certificate" is issued upon completion, as long as the completed work complies with the Building Regulations.

==2. Building Notice==
By the "building notice" method where notice of commencement of (minor) building work is given to the Local Authority at least two days prior to commencement of work. The various stages of the work are then inspected and approved by the Local Authority but no plans are checked.

This method may not be used if the premises contain a workplace, or creates new flats.

==3. Regularisation==
This is the retrospective approval for work already carried out without consent - and can only be administered by a Local Authority.

Most commonly, it is used by the owner of a building to apply for retrospective approval for [[illegal building]] work. The Local Authority will assess, and verify by means of site visits, plans and information submitted, identify non-compliant items, open up and inspect works, monitor the making good of defective work and, if satisfied, issue a Certificate.

An application for a Regularisation Certificate does not prevent the Authority taking legal action for failure to comply with the Building Regulations when the work was first carried out.

Generally '''Fees''' are paid to the Building Control Body, with each application. These will vary depending on the size and value of the project, and between different Local authorities across the country, and each Approved Inspector is free to set their own levels of charges. Some types of work may be exempt fees, e.g. adaptations or alterations for Disabled Persons.

Some work such as Electrical and Heating installations can be carried out by persons who can certify work as being Building Regulation compliant, without further inspection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Building Inspection|url=http://www.buildinginspectionsadelaide.net.au|website=BIA|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by either the Local Authority or an Approved Inspector. Any work certified in this way must however be registered with the Local Authority in the geographical area in which the work has been carried out.

A Building Control Body should issue a "Completion Certificate" or "Final Certificate" upon the practical completion of each building project, to state that the work meets the technical requirements of the Building Regulations.

If an Approved Inspector cannot do this due to omissions and/or known failures of the building work to show compliance with the relevant technical requirements of the Building Regulations, then the relevant local authority should investigate and consider the need to take appropriate enforcement action.

Building Regulation 'Enforcement Action' and/or 'incomplete work status' is normally recorded in the Local Lands Charges Register, held as a 'public record' by the relevant local authority. Solicitors must search these records prior to any purchase of any building.

'''Christoph Cremer''' (born in [[Freiburg]] im Breisgau, [[Germany]]) is a German [[physicist]] and [[professor]] at the [[Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg]], honorary professor at the [[University of Mainz]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imb-mainz.de/fileadmin/imb/news/Press_Release_Cremer_HonProfJGU.pdf] Honorary Professorship for IMB’s Christoph Cremer&lt;/ref&gt; and group leader at the [[Institute of Molecular Biology]] (IMB) a newly established research centre on the campus of the Johannes Gutenberg University of [[Mainz]], [[Germany]], who has successfully overcome the conventional limit of resolution that applies to light based investigations (the [[Abbe limit]]) by a range of different methods (1971/1978 development of the concept of 4Pi-microscopy; 1996 localization [[microscopy]] SPDM; 1997 spatially structured illumination SMI). In September 2014 he founded the NPO LuciaOptics to support the use of [[Super-resolution microscopy]] in the fields of [[molecular biology]], [[biomedicine]], [[microbiology]], [[virology]], [[pharmaceutical sciences]] and [[diagnosis]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luciaoptics.org] Research Center Microscopy LuciaOptics&lt;/ref&gt;

His actual microscope Vertico-SMI is the world’s fastest nano light microscope that allows large scale investigation of supramolecular complexes including living cell conditions. It allows 3 D imaging of biological preparations marked with conventional fluorescent dyes and reaches a resolution of 10&amp;nbsp;nm in 2D and 40&amp;nbsp;nm in 3D.

This nanoscope has therefore the potential to add substantially to the current revolution in optical imaging which will affect the entire molecular biology, medical and pharmaceutical research. The technology allows the development of new strategies for the prevention, the lowering of risk and therapeutic treatment of diseases.

== Biography ==
Following a few semesters studying [[philosophy]] and [[history]] at [[Freiburg University]] and [[Munich University]], Cremer studied [[physics]] in [[Munich]] (with financial support from the [[Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes]]) and completed his [[Ph.D.]] in [[genetics]] and [[biophysics]] in Freiburg. This was followed by post-doctoral studies at the Institute for Human Genetics at Freiburg University, several years in the United States at the [[University of California]], and his "[[Habilitation]]" in general human genetics and experimental cytogenetics at Freiburg University. Since 1983, he is teaching as a professor (chair since 2004) for "applied optics and information processing" at the Kirchhoff Institute for Physics at the University of Heidelberg. In addition, he is a member of the [[Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing]] of the Institute for Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, as well as of the University’s "Bioquant" Center. Cremer is a participant in three current "Projects of Excellence" of the University of Heidelberg (2007–2012), and is also a partner in the Biotechnology Cluster for cell-based and molecular medicine, one of five clusters selected in 2008 as German [[BMBF]] Clusters of Excellence. Elected as Second Speaker of the Senate of the University of Heidelberg (since 2006), Cremer is also involved in university governance and politics. In his function as adjunct professor at the [[University of Maine]] and as member of the [[Jackson Laboratory]] ([[Bar Harbor, Maine]]), where he undertakes research for several weeks each year during the semester breaks, he is involved in the establishment of the biophysics center (Institute for Molecular Biophysics), which is linked with the University of Heidelberg through a "Global Network" collaboration.

Cremer is married to [[architect]] and artist Letizia Mancino-Cremer.

== Fundamental developments ==

=== Developing the concept of 4Pi microscopy ===
Cremer was involved early in the further development of [[laser]] based [[light microscopy]] approaches. First ideas had their origin in his graduate student years in the 1970s. Jointly with his brother [[Thomas Cremer]], now professor (chair) of Anthropology and Human Genetics at the Ludwigs-Maximilian University in Munich, Christoph Cremer proposed the development of a [[hologram]]-based laser scanning 4Pi [[microscope]]. The basic idea was to focus laser light from all sides (space angle 4Pi) in a spot with a diameter smaller than the conventional laser focus and to scan the object by means of this spot. In this manner, it should be possible to achieve an improved [[optical resolution]] beyond the conventional limit of approx. 200&amp;nbsp;nm lateral, 600&amp;nbsp;nm axial.&lt;ref name="CremerCremer1978"&gt;C. Cremer and T. Cremer (1978): Considerations on a laser-scanning-microscope with high resolution and depth of field ''Microscopica Acta'' VOL. 81 NUMBER 1 September, pp. 31—44 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;T.

In ''European Journal of Histochemistry'', Vol. 50, pp. 223-272&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1992, 4Pi microscopy has been developed by [[Stefan Hell]] (Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen) into a highly efficient, high-resolution imaging process, using two microscope [[objective lenses]] of high numeric aperture opposing each other.&lt;ref&gt;S. Hell, S. Lindek, C. Cremer, E. H. K. Stelzer (1994): Measurement of the 4pi-confocal point spread function proves 75 nm axial resolution: in ''Applied Physics Letters'' Vol 64, pp. 1335-1337&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. E. Hänninen, S. W. Hell, J. Salo, E. Soini, C. Cremer(1995): Two-photon excitation 4Pi confocal microscope - Enhanced axial resolution microscope for biological research: , in ''Applied Physics Letters'', Vol 68, pp. 1698-1700&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of the first DNA laser-UV-microirradiation technique for living cells ===
In the early 1970s, the brothers realized a [[Ultraviolet|UV]] laser micro irradiation instrument which for the first time made it possible to irradiate in a controlled manner only a tiny part of a [[living cell]] at the absorption maximum for [[DNA]] (257&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref&gt;C. Cremer, C. Zorn und T. Cremer (1974): An ultraviolet Laser microbeam for 257 nm/Eine Laser-UV-Mikrobestrahlungsapparatur für 257 nm: in ''Microscopica Acta'' Vol. 75, No. 4, pp. 331—337&lt;/ref&gt; This replaced the conventional UV partial irradiation practiced for over 60 years. In this way, it was possible for the first time to induce alterations in the DNA in a focused manner (i.e. at predetermined places in the [[cell nucleus]] of living cells) without compromising the cells ability to divide and to survive. Specific very small cell regions could be irradiated and thus the dynamics of [[macromolecules]] (DNA) contained there quantitatively estimated. Furthermore, due to the high speed of the process using irradiation times of fractions of a second, it became possible to irradiate even moving [[cell organelles]]. This development provided the basis for important experiments in the area of [[genome]] structure research (establishing the existence of so-called [[chromosome territories]] in living [[mammalian]] cells) and led, a few years later (1979/1980) to a successful collaboration with the biologist [[Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard]] ([[Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology]], [[Tübingen]]). In this collaboration Cremer used his UV laser micro irradiation equipment to elicit cellular changes in the early [[larval]] stages of the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lohs-Schardin, C. Cremer and C. Nüsslein-Volhard (1979): A Fate Map for the Larval Epidermis of Drosophila melanogaster: Localized Cuticle Defects Following Irradiation of the Blastoderm with an Ultraviolet Laser Microbeam: in ''Developmental Biology'' 73, pp. 239-255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Nüsslein-Volhard, M. Lohs-Schardin, K.Sander and C. Cremer(1980): A dorso-ventral shift of embryonic primordia in a new maternal-effect mutant of Drosophila: in ''Nature'' (London), Vol. 283, No. 5746, pp. 474-476&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of the confocal laser scanning microscopy for fluorescence ===
On the basis of experience gained in the construction and application of the UV laser micro irradiation instrument, the Cremer brothers designed in 1978 a laser scanning process which scans point-by-point the three-dimensional surface of an object by means of a focused laser beam and creates the over-all picture by electronic means similar to those used in scanning electron microscopes.&lt;ref name="CremerCremer1978"/&gt; It is this plan for the construction of a [[confocal laser scanning microscope]] (CSLM), which for the first time combined the laser scanning method with the 3D detection of biological objects labeled with [[fluorescent marker]]s that earned Cremer his professorial position at the University of Heidelberg. During the next decade, the confocal fluorescence microscopy was developed into a technically fully matured state in particular by groups working at the [[University of Amsterdam]] and the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL) in Heidelberg and their industry partners. In later years, this technology was adopted widely by biomolecular and [[biomedical]] laboratories and remains to this day the gold standard as far as three-dimensional light microscopy with conventional resolution is concerned.

=== Development of the super resolution microscopy methods ===

The goal of microscopy is in many cases to determine the size of individual, small objects. Conventional fluorescence microscopy can only establish sizes to around the conventional [[optical resolution]] limit of approximately 200&amp;nbsp;nm (lateral). More than 20 years after submitting the 4 pi patent application,&lt;ref name="CremerCremer1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cremer C, Cremer T (1971) &lt;math&gt;4\pi&lt;/math&gt; Punkthologramme: Physikalische Grundlagen und mögliche Anwendungen. Enclosure to Patent application DE 2116521 "Verfahren zur Darstellung bzw. Modifikation von Objekt-Details, deren Abmessungen außerhalb der sichtbaren Wellenlängen liegen" (Procedure for the imaging and modification of object details with dimensions beyond the visible wavelengths). Filed 5 April 1971; publication date 12 October 1972.Deutsches Patentamt, Berlin. http://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?action=pdf&amp;docid=DE000002116521A&lt;/ref&gt; Christoph Cremer returned to the problem of the diffraction limit. 
With the [[Vertico SMI]] microscope he could realize his various super resolution techniques including SMI,SPDM, SPDMphymod and LIMON. These methods are mainly used for biomedical applications &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luciaoptics.com/press-publications/papers-biomedical-applications/ Biomedical applications for Super Resolution Microscopy]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spatially Modulated Illumination SMI====
Around 1995, he commenced with the development of a light microscopic process, which achieved a substantially improved size resolution of cellular [[nanostructure]]s stained with a fluorescent marker. This time he employed the principle of wide field microscopy combined with structured laser illumination (spatially modulated illumination, SMI)&lt;ref&gt;R. Heintzmann, C. Cremer (1999) Lateral modulated excitation microscopy: ''Improvement of resolution by using a diffraction grating''. Proc. SPIE 3568: 185-196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US patent 7,342,717, filed 10 July 1997: Christoph Cremer, Michael Hausmann, Joachim Bradl, Bernhard Schneider ''Wave field microscope with detection point spread function''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BaddeleyCremerBirk2007"&gt;D.

Birk (2007): Nano-structure analysis using Spatially Modulated Illumination microscopy: in ''Nature Protocols'', Vol 2, pp. 2640–2646&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, a size resolution of 30 – 40&amp;nbsp;nm (approximately 1/16 – 1/13 of the wavelength used) is being achieved. In addition, this technology is no longer subjected to the speed limitations of the focusing microscopy so that it becomes possible to undertake 3D analyses of whole cells within short observation times (at the moment around a few seconds).

Structured illumination microscopy of autofluorescent aggregations in human tissue. Micron, 42, 330-335&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Localization Microscopy SPDM ====
Also around 1995, Cremer developed and realized new fluorescence based wide field microscopy approaches which had as their goal the improvement of the effective optical resolution (in terms of the smallest detectable distance between two localized objects) down to a fraction of the conventional resolution (spectral precision distance/position determination microscopy, SPDM; Disambiguation SPDM: S = Spectral, P = Precision, D = Distance, M = Microscopy).&lt;ref&gt;J.

SPIE 2926: 201-206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;US patent 6,424,421, filed 23 December 1996: Christoph Cremer, Michael Hausmann, Joachim Bradl, Bernd Rinke ''Method and devices for measuring distances between object structures''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Heintzmann, H. Münch, C. Cremer (1997) ''High-precision measurements in epifluorescent microscopy - simulation and experiment''. Cell Vision 4: 252-253&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Localization Microscopy SPDMphymod ====
With this method, it is possible to use conventional, well established and inexpensive fluorescent dyes, standard like GFP, RFP, YFP, Alexa 488, Alexa 568, Alexa 647, Cy2, Cy3, Atto 488 and fluorescein.

}}'''Denise Scott Brown''' (née '''Lakofski'''; born October 3, 1931) is an American [[architect]], planner, writer, educator, and principal of the firm Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lumiere.lib.vt.edu/iawa_db/view_all.php3?person_pk=343&amp;table=bio&amp;|title=View all information for Denise Scott Brown|work=vt.edu|accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Brown and her husband and partner, [[Robert Venturi]], are regarded as among the most influential architects of the twentieth century, both through their architecture and planning, and theoretical writing and teaching.

==Education and teaching==

Born to Jewish parents Simon and Phyllis (Hepker) Lakofski, Denise Lakofski had the vision from the time she was five years old that she would be an architect. Pursuing this goal, she spent her summers working with architects, and from 1948 to 1952, studied in [[South Africa]] at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]. She briefly entered [[liberal politics]], but was frustrated by the lack of acceptance of women in the field. Lakofski traveled to [[London]] in 1952, working for the [[Modernist architecture|modernist]] architect [[Frederick Gibberd]]. She continued her education there, winning admission to the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]] to learn “useful skills in the building of a just South Africa,” within an intellectually rich environment which embraced women. She was joined there by Robert Scott Brown, whom she had met at Witwatersrand in 1954, and graduated with a degree in architecture in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brownlee|first1=David B.|last2=De Long|first2=David G.|last3=Whitaker|first3=Kathryn|title=Out of the Ordinary|date=2001|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|location=Philadelphia, PA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Denise Lakofski and Robert Scott Brown were married on July 21, 1955. The couple spent the next three years working and traveling throughout Europe, and in 1958, they moved to [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], to study at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s planning department. In 1959, Robert died in a car accident. Denise Scott Brown completed her master's degree in city planning in 1960 and, upon graduation, became a faculty member at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2005/06.09/15-radmedal.html|title=Harvard Gazette: Architect to receive Radcliffe Medal|author=Harvard News Office|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=25 February 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215447/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2005/06.09/15-radmedal.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While teaching, she completed a master's degree in architecture.  At a 1960 faculty meeting, she argued against demolishing the university's library (now the [[Furness Library|Fisher Fine Arts Library]]), designed by [[Philadelphia]] architect [[Frank Furness]]. At the meeting, she met [[Robert Venturi]], a young architect and fellow professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/lessons-from-las-vegas/|title=Lessons from Las Vegas - 99% Invisible|work=99% Invisible|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two became collaborators and taught courses together from 1962 to 1964. Scott Brown left the University of Pennsylvania in 1965. Becoming known as a scholar in [[urban planning]], she taught at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and was then named co-chair of the Urban Design Program at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. During her years in the Southwest, Scott Brown became interested in the newer cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. She invited Venturi to visit her classes at [[UCLA]], and in 1966 asked him to visit [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] with her. The two were married in [[Santa Monica, California]], on July 23, 1967. Scott Brown moved back to [[Philadelphia]] in 1967 to join Robert Venturi's firm, Venturi and Rauch, and became principal in charge of planning in 1969.  Denise Scott Brown later taught at [[Yale University]], and in 2003 was a visiting lecturer with Venturi at [[Harvard University]]'s [[Graduate School of Design]].

==Architecture and planning==
[[File:Denise Scott Brown 1978 © Lynn Gilbert.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Denise Scott Brown in 1978, photographed by [[Lynn Gilbert]]]]
In 1972, with Venturi and [[Steven Izenour]], Scott Brown wrote ''[[Learning from Las Vegas|Learning From Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form]]''. The book published studies of the [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] Strip, undertaken with students in an architectural research studio course which Scott Brown taught with Venturi in 1970 at [[Yale]]'s School of Architecture and Planning. The book joined Venturi's previous ''Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture'' ([[Museum of Modern Art]], 1966) as a rebuke to orthodox modernism and elite architectural tastes, and a pointed acceptance of American sprawl and vernacular architecture.  The book coined the terms "Duck" and "Decorated Shed" as applied to opposing architectural styles. Scott Brown has remained a prolific writer on architecture and urban planning.

Scott Brown and Venturi strove for understanding the city in terms of social, economic and cultural perspectives, viewing it as a set of complex systems upon planning. As part of their design process, the Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates firm studies the trends of an area, marking future expansions or congestions. These studies influence plans and design makeup. Such an approach was used for their Berlin Tomorrow Competition, putting the population movement and daily pattern in consideration. Similarly, the [[Bryn Mawr College]] plan took into consideration the landmark of the early campus and the usages of campus space prior to planning.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Moos|first1=Stanislaus|title=Venturi Scott Brown &amp; Associates Buildings and Projects, 1986-1998|date=1999|publisher=The Monacelli Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scott Brown holds a systematic approach to planning in what is coined as “FFF studios.” In it, form, forces and function determine and help define the urban environment.&lt;ref name="Out of the Ordinary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brownlee|first1=David B.|last2=De Long|first2=David G.|last3=Hiesinger|first3=Kathryn B.|title=Out of the Ordinary|date=2001|publisher=Department of Publishing|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates firm studied both the expansion of Dartmouth College campus along with the wilderness surrounding the perimeter of the area.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The fusion of Eastern and Western ideas in the [[Nikko Hotels|Nikko hotel chain]] are evident by merging the Western notion of comfort (62 Stanislaus Von Moos) with historical [[kimono]] patterns with their hidden order. The architecture applies a post-Las Vegas modern feel while projecting the traditional Japanese shopping street. Guest rooms are typically made with Western taste, with fabrics, wallpaper, and carpet exclusively from the Venturi, Scott Brown &amp; Associates firm that reflect the scenery outside. In contrast, the exterior “street” complex reflects Japanese urban and traditional life.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

With the firm, renamed Venturi, Rauch and Scott Brown in 1980, and finally Venturi, Scott Brown and Associates in 1989, Scott Brown has led major civic planning projects and studies, and more recently has directed many university campus planning projects. By the beginning of the 1980s, Venturi and Brown had made huge success with their ideas and concepts. Critics characterized them as the most influential and visionary architects of the time and continued their path with a clear approach, with their radical theories of design.&lt;ref name="Out of the Ordinary"/&gt; She has also served as principal-in-charge with [[Robert Venturi]] on the firm's larger architectural projects, including the [[Sainsbury Wing]] of [[London National Gallery|London's National Gallery]], the capitol building in [[Toulouse]] and the Nikko Hotel and Spa Resort in [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vsba.com/whoweare/index_team.html|title=VSBA Homepage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Robert Venturi was named as winner of the 1991 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor Blau (April 8, 1991) [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/08/arts/robert-venturi-is-to-receive-pritzker-architecture-prize.html Robert Venturi Is to Receive Pritzker Architecture Prize] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Brown did not attend the award ceremony in protest.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Robin Pogrebin (April 17, 2013) [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/arts/design/bid-for-pritzker-prize-to-acknowledge-denise-scott-brown.html Partner Without the Prize] ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; The prize organization, the Hyatt Foundation stated that, in 1991, it honored only individual architects, a practice that changed in 2001 with the selection of [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron|Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, the award was given to two recipients in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.pritzkerprize.com/laureates/year| work= |publisher=The Pritzker Architecture Prize |title = The Pritzker Architecture Prize Laureates| accessdate= April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Women In Design, a student organization spearheaded by Caroline Amory James and Arielle Assouline-Lichten&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/#/news/caroline-james-and-arielle-assouline-lichten-honored-by-bwaf.html|title=Harvard Graduate School of Design  - Homepage|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] started a petition for Scott Brown to receive joint recognition with her partner [[Robert Venturi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/18/arts/design/bid-for-pritzker-prize-to-acknowledge-denise-scott-brown.html?ref=design| work= The New York Times |title = Partner Without the Prize| accessdate= April 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When awarded the [[Jane Drew Prize]] in 2017 Scott Brown referred to the Pritzer controversy and subsequent petition saying "I was very touched by the Pritzker petition – and that is my prize in the end. 20,000 people wrote from all over the world and every one of them called me Denise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/denise-scott-brown-recognised-with-2017-jane-drew-prize/10017080.article|title = Denise Scott Brown recognised with 2017 Jane Drew Prize| accessdate= February 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Room at the top ===
In 1989, Scott Brown published her famous essay, "Room at the top? Sexism and the Star System in Architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic753413.files/14_Outsiders%20in%20the%20Profession/Brown_Sexism.pdf |format=PDf|title=Room at the top? Sexism and the Star System in Architecture|website=www.isites.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Scott Brown wrote the essay in 1975, she decided not to publish it at the time, out of fear for damaging her career. The essay describes her struggle to be recognized as an equal partner of the firm, in an architecture world that was predominantly male. She has since been an advocate for Women in Architecture and has spoken out about discrimination within the profession on several accounts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4018">'''Digital probabilistic physics''' is a branch of [[digital philosophy]] which holds that the universe exists as a [[Nondeterministic finite automaton|nondeterministic]] [[State Machine|state machine]].  The notion of the universe existing as a state machine was first postulated by [[Konrad Zuse]]'s book ''[[Rechnender Raum]]''.  Adherents hold that the universe state machine can move between more and less probable states, with the less probable states containing more [[information]].  This theory is in contrast to [[digital physics]], which holds that the history of the universe is [[computable]] and is deterministically unfolding from initial conditions.

The fundamental tenets of digital probabilistic physics were first explored at great length by Tom Stonier in a series of books which explore the notion of information as existing as a physical phenomenon of the universe.  According to Stonier, the arrangement of atoms and molecules which make up physical objects contains information, and high-information objects such as DNA are low-probability physical structures.  Within this framework, [[civilization]] itself is a low-probability construct maintaining its existence by propagating through communication.  Stonier's work has been unique in considering information as existing as a physical phenomenon, being broader than as an application to the domain of telecommunications. 

To distinguish the [[probability]] of the physical state of the molecules from the probability of the energy distribution of thermodynamics, the term [[Negentropy|extropy]] was appropriated to define the probability of the atomic configuration, as opposed to the [[entropy]]. Thus, in thermodynamics, a 'coarse-grain' set of partitions is defined which groups together similar microscopically different states and in ''digital probabilistic physics'' the specific microscopic state probability is considered alone.  The extropy is defined to be the [[self-information]] of the [[Markov chain]] describing the physical system.

The extropy of a system &lt;math&gt;X(A_n)&lt;/math&gt; in bits associated with the Markov chain configuration &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; whose outcome has probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is{{Citation needed|reason=a literature search does not show 'extropy' being used in this way|date=February 2014}}:

:&lt;math&gt;X(A_n) = \log_2 \left(\frac{1}{p(A_n)} \right) = - \log_2(p(A_n)) &lt;/math&gt; 

Within this philosophy, the probability of the physical system does not necessarily change with the deterministic flow of energy through the atomic framework, but rather moves into a lesser probability state when the system goes through a bifurcating transition. Examples of this include Bernoulli cell formation, quantum fluctuations in a gravitational field causing gravitational precipitation points, and other systems moving through unstable self-amplifying state transitions.

==Criticism==

* The existence of discrete digital states is incompatible with the continuous symmetries such as [[rotational symmetry]], [[Lorentz symmetry]], [[electroweak symmetry]] and others.  Proponents of digital physics hold that the continuous models are approximations to the underlying discrete nature of the universe.

'''FSU Young Scholars Program (YSP)''' is a six-week residential [[science]] and [[mathematics]] summer program for 40 [[Florida]] [[Secondary education in the United States|high school students]] with significant potential for careers in the fields of [[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], and [[mathematics]]. The program was developed in 1983 and is currently administered by the Office of Science Teaching Activities in the [[Florida State University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] at [[Florida State University]].

==Academic program==
Each young scholar attends a total of three courses in the fields of mathematics, science, and computer programming. The courses are designed specifically for this program—they are neither high school nor college courses.

==Research==
Each student who attends YSP is assigned an Independent Research Project (IRP) based on his or her interests. Students join the research teams of [[Florida State University|FSU]] professors, participating in [[scientific research]] for two days each week.  The fields of study available range from [[robotics]], [[molecular biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[physics]], to [[zoology]]. At the conclusion of the program, students present their projects in an [[academic conference]], documenting their findings and explaining their projects to both students and faculty.

==Faculty==
The program is co-directed by Dr. Erica Staehling, Barbara Shoplock, and Teresa Callahan, members of the Office of Science Teaching Activities, [[Florida State University]]. Instructional faculty includes Dr. Steve Blumsack, Emeritus Professor of [[Mathematics]]; Dr. Dan Oberlin, Professor of [[Mathematics]]; Drs. Harrison Prosper and Horst Wahl, Professors of [[Physics]]; and Dr. Lloyd Epstein, Professor of [[biology|Biological Science]]. Twenty additional Florida State science and engineering faculty members mentor the students in their independent research projects.

==Selection process==
YSP admits students who have completed the eleventh grade in a Florida [[public high school|public]] or [[private high school]].  A few exceptionally qualified and mature tenth graders have been selected in past years, though this is quite rare.

All applicants must have completed [[Pre-Calculus]] and maintain at least a 3.0 unweighted [[Grading (education)|GPA]] to be considered for acceptance. Additionally, students must have scored at the 90th percentile or better in science or mathematics on a nationally standardized exam, such as the [[SAT]], [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]], [[ACT (test)|ACT]], or [[PLAN (test)|PLAN]].  Students are required to submit an application package, including [[Transcript (education)|high school transcripts]] and a letter of recommendation.

Selection is extremely competitive, as there are typically over 200 highly qualified applicants competing for only 40 positions.  The majority of past participants graduated in the top ten of their respective high school classes, with over 25% of students entering their senior year ranked first in their class.  The average [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]] score of past young scholars was in the 97th percentile in math and 94th percentile in critical reading nationally.

[[File:Ecran oled flexible.jpg|thumb|Demonstration of a 4.1" prototype flexible display from Sony]]
A '''flexible organic light emitting diode''' ('''FOLED''') is a type of [[organic light-emitting diode]] (OLED) incorporating a flexible plastic [[Substrate (semiconductor)|substrate]] on which the [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] [[organic semiconductor]] is deposited. This enables the device to be bent or rolled while still operating. Currently the focus of research in industrial and academic groups, flexible OLEDs form one method of fabricating a [[rollable display]].

==Technical details and applications==
{{See also|Organic light-emitting diode#Working_principle|l1=Organic LED: Working principle|Organic light-emitting diode#Advantages|l2=List of OLED advantages}}
An OLED emits light due to the [[electroluminescence]] of thin films of [[organic semiconductor]]s approximately 100&amp;nbsp;nm thick. Regular OLEDs are usually fabricated on a glass [[Substrate (semiconductor)|substrate]], but by replacing glass with a flexible plastic such as [[polyethylene terephthalate]] (PET)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/357477a0|title=Flexible light-emitting diodes made from soluble conducting polymers|year=1992|last1=Gustafsson|first1=G.|last2=Cao|first2=Y.|last3=Treacy|first3=G.

J.|journal=Nature|volume=357|pages=477|issue=6378|bibcode=1992Natur.357..477G}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/B310846P|title=Engineered films for display technologies|year=2004|last1=MacDonald|first1=W. A.|journal=Journal of Materials Chemistry|volume=14|pages=4–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; OLEDs can be made both bendable and lightweight.

Such materials may not be suitable for comparable devices based on  [[inorganic]] [[semiconductor]]s due to the need for [[lattice matching]] and the high temperature fabrication procedure involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/16.605453|title=Achieving full-color organic light-emitting devices for lightweight, flat-panel displays|year=1997|last1=Burrows|first1=P.

E.|journal=IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices|volume=44|pages=1188–1203|bibcode = 1997ITED...44.1188B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, flexible OLED devices can be fabricated by deposition of the organic layer onto the substrate using a method derived from [[Inkjet printer|inkjet]] printing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.120807|title=Ink-jet printing of doped polymers for organic light emitting devices|year=1998|last1=Hebner|first1=T.

Flexible OLEDs may be used in the production of [[rollable display]]s, [[electronic paper]], or bendable displays which can be integrated into clothing, wallpaper or other curved surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/31/business/la-fi-flexscreen-20110127|title=Flexible electronic display will get Army field test|author=Brandon Bailey|date=31 January 2011|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/8434705.stm|title='Light emitting wallpaper' could replace bulbs|date=30 December 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10373923|title=Haptics brings a personal touch to technology|author=Michael Fitzpatrick|date=5 July 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prototype displays have been exhibited by companies such as [[Sony]], which are capable of being rolled around the width of a pencil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20006000-1.html|title=Sony unveils ultrathin rollable OLED|author=Candace Lombardi|date=26 May 2010|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages==
{{see also|Organic light-emitting diode#Disadvantages|l1=List of OLED disadvantages}}
Both flexible substrate itself as well as the process of bending the device introduce [[Stress (mechanics)|stress]] into the materials. There may be residual stress from the deposition of layers onto a flexible substrate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiang|first1=C.-J.|last2=Winscom|first2=C.|last3=Monkman|first3=A.|year=2010|title=Electroluminescence characterization of FOLED devices under two type of external stresses caused by bending|journal=Organic Electronics|volume=11|pages=1870–1875|doi=10.1016/j.orgel.2010.08.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; thermal stresses due to the different coefficient of [[thermal expansion]] of materials in the device,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hsueh|first1=C. H.|year=2002|title=Thermal stresses in elastic multilayer systems|journal=Thin Solid Films|volume=418|pages=182–188|doi=10.1016/S0040-6090(02)00699-5|bibcode=2002TSF...418..182H}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the external stress from the bending of the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiang|first1=C.-J.|last2=Winscom|first2=C.|last3=Bull|first3=S.|last4=Monkman|first4=A.|year=2009|title=Mechanical modeling of flexible OLED devices|journal=Organic Electronics|volume=10|pages=1268–1274|doi=10.1016/j.orgel.2009.07.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stress introduced into the organic layers may lower the efficiency or brightness of the device as it is deformed, or cause complete breakdown of the device altogether. [[Indium tin oxide]] (ITO), the material most commonly used as the transparent [[anode]], is brittle. Fracture of the anode can occur which can increase the [[sheet resistance]] of the ITO or disrupt the layered structure of the OLED.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leterrier|first1=Y.|last2=Médico|first2=L.|last3=Månson|first3=J.-A. E.|last4=Betz|first4=U.|last5=Escolà|first5=M.

[[Micro-encapsulation|Encapsulation]] is another challenge for flexible OLED devices.  The materials in an OLED are sensitive to air and moisture which lead to [[Chemical decomposition|degradation]] of the materials themselves as well as [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quenching]] of excited states within the molecule.  The common method of encapsulation for regular OLEDs is to seal the organic layer between glass.  Flexible encapsulation methods are generally not as effective a barrier to air and moisture as glass, and current research aims to improve the encapsulation of flexible organic light emitting diodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Han|first1=J.-M.|last2=Han|first2=J.-W.|last3=Chun|first3=J.-Y.|last4=Ok|first4=C.-H.|last5=Seo|first5=D.-S.|year=2008|title=Novel Encapsulation Method for Flexible Organic Light-Emitting Diodes using Poly(dimethylsiloxane)|journal=Japanese Journal of Applied Physics|volume=47|pages=8986–8988|doi=10.1143/JJAP.47.8986|bibcode = 2008JaJAP..47.8986H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=S.|last2=Zhang|first2=D.|last3=Li|first3=Y.|last4=Duan|first4=L.|last5=Dong|first5=G.|last6=Wang|first6=L.|last7=Qiu|first7=Y.|year=2008|title=New hybrid encapsulation for flexible organic light-emitting devices on plastic substrates|journal=Chinese Science Bulletin|volume=53|pages=958–960|doi=10.1007/s11434-008-0088-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[cell biology]], '''focal adhesions''' (also '''cell–matrix adhesions''' or '''FAs''') are large [[macromolecular assemblies]] through which mechanical force and regulatory signals are transmitted between the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) and an interacting cell. More precisely, focal adhesions are the sub-cellular structures that mediate the regulatory effects (i.e., signaling events) of a cell in response to ECM adhesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = CS | last2 = Alonso | first2 = JL | last3 = Ostuni | first3 = E | last4 = Whitesides | first4 = GM | last5 = Ingber | first5 = DE | year = 2003 | title = Cell shape provides global control of focal adhesion assembly | url = | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 307 | issue = 2| pages = 355–61 | doi=10.1016/s0006-291x(03)01165-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Focal adhesions serve as the mechanical linkages to the ECM, and as a biochemical signaling hub to concentrate and direct numerous signaling proteins at sites of [[integrin]] binding and clustering.

==Structure and function==
Focal adhesions are integrin-containing, multi-protein structures that form mechanical links between intracellular actin bundles and the extracellular substrate in many cell types. Focal adhesions are large, dynamic [[protein complexes]] through which the [[cytoskeleton]] of a cell connects to the ECM. They are limited to clearly defined ranges of the cell, at which the plasma membrane closes to within 15&amp;nbsp;nm of the ECM substrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zaidel-Bar | first1 = R | last2 = Cohen | first2 = M | last3 = Addadi | first3 = L | last4 = Geiger | first4 = B | year = 2004 | title = Hierarchical assembly of cell matrix adhesion complexes | url = | journal = Biochemical Society Transactions | volume = 32 | issue = 3| pages = 416–20 | doi=10.1042/bst0320416 | pmid=15157150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focal adhesions are in a state of constant flux: proteins associate and disassociate with it continually as signals are transmitted to other parts of the cell, relating to anything from [[cell motility]] to [[cell cycle]]. Focal adhesions can contain over 100 different proteins, which suggests a considerable functional diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zamir | first1 = E | last2 = Geiger | first2 = B | year = 2001 | title = Molecular complexity and dynamics of cell–matrix adhesions | url = | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 114 | issue = 20| pages = 3583–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than anchoring the cell, they function as signal carriers (sensors), which inform the cell about the condition of the ECM and thus affect their behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riveline | first1 = D | last2 = Zamir | first2 = E | last3 = Balaban | first3 = NQ | last4 = Schwarz | first4 = US | last5 = Ishizaki | first5 = T | last6 = Narumiya | first6 = S | last7 = Kam | first7 = Z | last8 = Geiger | first8 = B | last9 = Bershadsky | first9 = AD | year = 2001 | title = Focal contacts as mechanosensors: externally applied local mechanical force induces growth of focal contacts by an mDia1-dependent and ROCK-independent mechanism | url = | journal = Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 153 | issue = 6| pages = 1175–86 | doi=10.1083/jcb.153.6.1175 | pmid=11402062 | pmc=2192034}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[wiktionary:sessile|sessile]] cells, focal adhesions are quite stable under normal conditions, while in moving cells their stability is diminished: this is because in motile cells, focal adhesions are being constantly assembled and disassembled as the cell establishes new contacts at the leading edge, and breaks old contacts at the trailing edge of the cell. One example of their important role is in the [[immune system]], in which [[white blood cells]] migrate along the connective [[endothelium]] following cellular signals to damaged [[biological tissue]].

==Morphology==

Connection between focal adhesions and proteins of the [[extracellular matrix]] generally involves [[integrins]]. Integrins bind to extra-cellular proteins via short amino acid sequences, such as the [[RGD motif]] (found in proteins such as [[fibronectin]], [[laminin]], or [[vitronectin]]), or the DGEA and GFOGER motifs found in [[collagen]]. Integrins are [[heterodimers]] which are formed from one beta and one alpha subunit. These subunits are present in different forms, their corresponding ligands classify these receptors into four groups: RGD receptors, laminin receptors, leukocyte-specific receptors and collagen receptors. Within the cell, the intracellular domain of integrin binds to the cytoskeleton via adapter proteins such as [[Talin (protein)|talin]], [[Actinin, alpha 1|α-actinin]], [[filamin]], [[vinculin]] and [[tensin]]. Many other intracellular signalling proteins, such as [[focal adhesion kinase]], bind to and associate with this integrin-adapter protein–cytoskeleton complex, and this forms the basis of a focal adhesion.

==Adhesion dynamics with migrating cells==
The dynamic assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions plays a central role in [[cell migration]]. During cell migration, both the composition and the morphology of the focal adhesion change. Initially, small (0.25μm²) focal adhesions called focal complexes (FXs) are formed at the leading edge of the cell in [[lamellipodia]]: they consist of integrin, and some of the adapter proteins, such as [[talin protein|talin]], [[paxillin]] and [[tensin]]. Many of these focal complexes fail to mature and are disassembled as the lamellipodia withdraw. However, some focal complexes mature into larger and stable focal adhesions, and recruit many more proteins such as [[zyxin]]. Recruitment of components to the focal adhesion occurs in an ordered, sequential manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zaidel-Bar|first1=R|last2=Cohen|first2=M|last3=Addadi|first3=L|last4=Geiger|first4=B|title=Hierarchical assembly of cell-matrix adhesion complexes.|journal=Biochemical Society Transactions|date=June 2004|volume=32|issue=Pt3|pages=416–20|pmid=15157150|doi=10.1042/bst0320416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in place, a focal adhesion remains stationary with respect to the extracellular matrix, and the cell uses this as an anchor on which it can push or pull itself over the ECM. As the cell progresses along its chosen path, a given focal adhesion moves closer and closer to the trailing edge of the cell. At the trailing edge of the cell the focal adhesion must be dissolved. The mechanism of this is poorly understood and is probably instigated by a variety of different methods depending on the circumstances of the cell. One possibility is that the calcium-dependent protease [[calpain]] is involved: it has been shown that the inhibition of calpain leads to the inhibition of focal adhesion-ECM separation. Focal adhesion components are amongst the known calpain substrates, and it is possible that calpain degrades these components to aid in focal adhesion disassembly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huttenlocher | first1 = A | last2 = Palecek | first2 = SP | last3 = Lu | first3 = Q | last4 = Zhang | first4 = W | last5 = Mellgren | first5 = RL | last6 = Lauffenburger | first6 = DA | last7 = Ginsberg | first7 = MH | last8 = Horwitz | first8 = AF | year = 1997 | title = Regulation of cell migration by the calcium-dependent protease calpain | url = | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 272 | issue = 52| pages = 32719–22 | doi=10.1074/jbc.272.52.32719}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actin retrograde flow===
The assembly of nascent focal adhesions is highly dependent on the process of retrograde actin flow. This is the phenomenon in a migrating cell where actin filaments polymerize at the leading edge and flow back towards the cell body. This is the source of traction required for migration; the focal adhesion acts as a molecular clutch when it tethers to the ECM and impedes the retrograde movement of actin, thus generating the pulling (traction) force at the site of the adhesion that is necessary for the cell to move forward. This traction can be visualized with [[traction force microscopy]]. A common metaphor to explain actin retrograde flow is a large number of people being washed downriver, and as they do so, some of them hang on to rocks and branches along the bank to stop their downriver motion. Thus, a pulling force is generated onto the rock or branch that they are hanging on to. These forces are necessary for the successful assembly, growth, and maturation of focal adhesions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardel|first1=M.

===Natural biomechanical sensor===
Extracellular mechanical forces, which are exerted through focal adhesions, can activate [[Src kinase]] and stimulate the growth of the adhesions. As well as, intracellular force generated by actomyosin contractility is sensed by focal adhesion via adhesion proteins such as talin and vinculin &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Abhishek|last2=Ouyang|first2=Mingxing|last3=Dries|first3=Koen Van den|last4=McGhee|first4=Ewan James|last5=Tanaka|first5=Keiichiro|last6=Anderson|first6=Marie D.|last7=Groisman|first7=Alexander|last8=Goult|first8=Benjamin T.|last9=Anderson|first9=Kurt I.|date=2016-05-09|title=Talin tension sensor reveals novel features of focal adhesion force transmission and mechanosensitivity|url=http://jcb.rupress.org/content/213/3/371|journal=J Cell Biol|language=en|volume=213|issue=3|pages=371–383|doi=10.1083/jcb.201510012|issn=0021-9525|pmid=27161398|pmc=4862330}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grashoff|first=Carsten|last2=Hoffman|first2=Brenton D.|last3=Brenner|first3=Michael D.|last4=Zhou|first4=Ruobo|last5=Parsons|first5=Maddy|last6=Yang|first6=Michael T.|last7=McLean|first7=Mark A.|last8=Sligar|first8=Stephen G.|last9=Chen|first9=Christopher S.|date=2010-07-08|title=Measuring mechanical tension across vinculin reveals regulation of focal adhesion dynamics|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature09198|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=466|issue=7303|pages=263–266|doi=10.1038/nature09198|issn=1476-4687|pmc=2901888}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Decreasing actomyosin contractility, using the drug blebbistatin, leads to a decrease in talin tension as well as focal adhesion size &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. This indicates that focal adhesions may function as mechanical sensors, and suggests that force generated from [[myosin]] fibers could contribute to maturing the focal complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Y | last2 = Botvinick | first2 = EL | last3 = Zhao | first3 = Y | last4 = Berns | first4 = MW | last5 = Usami | first5 = S | last6 = Tsien | first6 = RY | last7 = Chien | first7 = S | year = 2005 | title = Visualizing the mechanical activation of Src | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 434 | issue = 7036| pages = 1040–5 | doi=10.1038/nature03469 | pmid=15846350}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This gains further support from the fact that inhibition of myosin-generated forces leads to slow disassembly of focal adhesions, by changing the turnover kinetics of the focal adhesion proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wolfenson | first1 = H. | last2 = Bershadsky | first2 = A. | last3 = Henis | first3 = Y. I. | last4 = Geiger | first4 = B. | year = 2011 | title = Actomyosin-generated tension controls the molecular kinetics of focal adhesions | url = | journal = J Cell Sci | volume = 124 | issue = 9| pages = 1425–32 | doi=10.1242/jcs.077388| pmc = 3078811 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between forces on focal adhesions and their compositional maturation, however, remains unclear. For instance, preventing focal adhesion maturation by inhibiting myosin activity or stress fiber assembly does not prevent forces sustained by focal adhesions, nor does it prevent cells from migrating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nascent Focal Adhesions Are Responsible for the Generation of Strong Propulsive Forces in Migrating Fibroblasts|url = http://jcb.rupress.org/content/153/4/881|journal = The Journal of Cell Biology|date = 2001-05-14|issn = 0021-9525|pmid = 11352946|pages = 881–888|volume = 153|issue = 4|doi = 10.1083/jcb.153.4.881|first = Karen A.|last = Beningo|first2 = Micah|last2 = Dembo|first3 = Irina|last3 = Kaverina|first4 = J.

Their role in mechanosensing is important for [[durotaxis]].

'''Frank Pope''' (born 13 May 1973) is the Chief Executive Officer for [[Save_the_Elephants|Save the Elephants]] (STE). After studying zoology at the University of Edinburgh he began his career in marine science before joining The Times newspaper as the world's only Ocean Correspondent (between 2008 and 2011) to cover the fast-changing science, environment and geopolitics of the sea and help increase visibility of the crisis facing marine ecosystems. During this time he published two books, Dragon Sea (Penguin, 2007) and 72 Hours (Orion, 2011) and hosted the BBC Series Britain's Secret Seas. 

After joining Save the Elephants in 2012 Pope helped establish the Elephant Crisis Fund (a joint initiative between Save the Elephants &amp; the [[Wildlife Conservation Network]]), supporting more than 58 different partner organisations across Africa and the world in conducting over 180 projects in the realms of anti-poaching, anti-trafficking and demand reduction. An experienced bush pilot, Pope is married to [[Saba Douglas-Hamilton]], daughter of STE founder [[Iain Douglas-Hamilton]]. They live in Kenya with their three children. In 2015, they made the BBC Natural History Unit series ''This Wild Life''.

==Maritime Archaeology==

Pope worked on maritime archaeological projects in [[Uruguay]], the [[Cape Verde Islands]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Mozambique]] on wrecks including the ''San Salvador'', ''[[German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee|Graf Spee]]'' off [[Montevideo]] and [[Lord Nelson]]'s flagship [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS Agamemnon]] in Uruguay, ''Princess Louisa'' in Cabo Verde and the ''San Sebastian Wreck'' in Mozambique. In Vietnam, Pope worked on the [[Hoi An Wreck]], the subject of his book, Dragon Sea: A True Tale of Treasure, Archeology, &amp; Greed. &lt;ref name="bestoftimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article4066732.ece|title=Best of Times, Worst of Times: Frank Pope|accessdate=2009-10-18 | work=The Times | location=London | first=Charlotte | last=HuntGrubbe | date=2008-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The general rating of city appeal''' — is a method for calculating and comparing the city appeal and urban environment, based on determining their number values and the threshold of appeal. The method is based on collection, description and assessment of qualitative and quantitative indices. 
Quantitative indices are represented by annual statistical data on the cities of the [[Russian Federation]], whereas qualitative characteristics are represented by own properties of a city. The purpose of the rating is to carry out an integrated collective and public analysis of the [[urban environment]], compare urban environments, analyze strengthens and weaknesses and to prepare information for managerial analysis and to make personnel decisions.

== Description ==

The general rating of city appeal for [[Russian cities]] was designed by the [[Russian Union of Engineers]] in 2012. The rating was designed due to the objective need to conduct a complex analysis and assess disproportions in distribution of population, labour resources and production capacity in the Russian Federation.

'''The purpose of the rating''' is to carry out an unbiased and complex appraisal of Russian cities in terms of the criteria which determine the quality level of all spheres of activity of the population, city economy and urban environment.

'''Tasks:'''
* To analyze the existing Russian and foreign methods and practices of comparing administrative and territorial units of macroregions and countries.
* To conduct a comprehensive research and determine the criteria and basic indicators of appraisal of cities by means of selected theoretical and methodological disciplines, related to the appraisal of qualitative and quantitative characteristics of objects under research.
* To develop a rating [[methodology]], based on the best Russian and foreign practices.
* To develop a complex rating methodology for comparing cities on the basis of a system of economic parameters.
* To develop a system social and economic parameters, fully charactering functioning of cities.
* To calculate integral parameters, indices and groups of indices in accordance with the developed methodology.
* To outline typical groups (typology) of items according to a range of features, specify similarities and differences in their development outline significant individual differences and analyze the results.
* To develop a monitoring system of social and economic status of the cities under research.

== Rating methodology ==

The methodology of appraisal of city appeal is based on quality assessment of elements of the city economy and comfort of living of citizens. The main method is a procedure borrowed from qualimetry, in which several approaches to quantitative appraisal of quality were developed.

To compare various properties measured in scales different in range and dimension &lt;math&gt;K_i&lt;/math&gt;, a relative dimensionless ratio, is used to show the degree of approximation of  &lt;math&gt;Qi&lt;/math&gt;, (absolute property indicator) to the maximum  &lt;math&gt;Q^{max}&lt;/math&gt;, and minimum   &lt;math&gt;Q^{min}&lt;/math&gt;. The relative ratio is described as the following relationship  &lt;math&gt;Ki=f{(Q^{min},\ldots,Q_i,\ldots,Q^{max})}&lt;/math&gt;, which may be represented as a normalized function as follows  &lt;math&gt;K_i=\frac{Q_i-Q^{min}}{Q^{max}-Q^{min}}&lt;/math&gt;

To compare the relativities of all properties included in the tree of properties &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt;, dimensionless importance ratios are used. For the purposes of convenience the following is usually assumed  &lt;math&gt;0&lt;G_i&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, and  &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^N G_i=1&lt;/math&gt;

The values of importance ratios are determined with the help of expert and non-expert (analytical) methods. This study combines both techniques (as described below). The relative importance was determined using a method of expert survey involving 50 experts of various industries and areas of business, different social and professional status.

Thus, the qualitative appraisal of quality  &lt;math&gt;K_k&lt;/math&gt; is expressed using the following formula

&lt;math&gt;K_k=K_ef \sum_{i=1}^N K_iG_i&lt;/math&gt;, where

&lt;math&gt;K_ef=1&lt;/math&gt; for all indices forming a part of the final general index of city appeal.
The general city appeal index is directly calculated as an average compound of all characteristics

&lt;math&gt;G(K_1, K_2, \ldots, K_n)=\sqrt[n]{K_1K_2\cdots K_n}=\left(\prod_{i=1}^n K_i\right)^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt;

The key problem of selection of the minimum  combination of properties (indicators) forming a part of the item quality may be solved through the functional and typological analysis considering the quality as a system of objective properties, and based on the volume of the original information (statistical and open-access information). 
Therefore, to conduct the appraisal, 70 quasisimple properties were selected, forming 41 overall indices, which are, in their turn, interpreted as 13 indices.

== Ranking results ==

The top ten cities are characterized by high indicators in nearly all the aspects. The only exception is the [[housing affordability]] factor, in terms of which the leading cities have low indicators because of high prices for 1 square meter of residential space. The cities leading in terms of most indicators are million-plus cities ([[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Kazan]], [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Rostov-on-Don]], and others); cities having development advantages (Vladivostok, Krasnodar, Sochi, and Kaliningrad); cities that are attractive from the point of view of investments ([[Tomsk]], [[Omsk]], [[Surgut]], [[Tyumen]], [[Irkutsk]], [[Yaroslavl]], [[Saratov]]); and Moscow Region cities with high construction rate ([[Podolsk]], [[Khimki]], [[Balashikha]] and [[Mytishchi]]).

The medium-ranked cities are the cities characterized by dynamic development ([[Kaluga]], [[Krasnodar]], [[Kislovodsk]]); industrial cities ([[Pervouralsk]], [[Chelyabinsk]], [[Ulyanovsk]], [[Kamensk-Uralsky]], [[Shakhty]]); the single-industry city of [[Naberezhnye Chelny]], as well as [[Bryansk]], [[Ryazan]], [[Vologda]], and [[Yoshkar-Ola]].

The following cities are noted for satisfactory development levels: [[Orsk]], [[Ulan-Ude]], [[Orenburg]], [[Sterlitamak]], [[Syzran]], [[Ussuriysk]], [[Oktyabrsky, Russia|Oktyabrsky]], [[Votkinsk]], single-industry cities [[Magnitogorsk]], [[Nizhni Tagil]], and the single-industry city having the highest investment inflow – [[Nakhodka]].

The bottom-ranked cities in most subratings are the [[North Caucasus]] cities ([[Kaspiysk]]  and [[Yessentuki]]), cities of the Altai Territory ([[Rubtsovsk]], [[Barnaul]], [[Biysk]]), single-industry cities [[Leninsk-Kuznetsky (city)|Leninsk-Kuznetsky]] and [[Severodvinsk]], as well as [[Artyom]], [[Miass]], [[Novocheboksarsk]] and Kopeisk. [[Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous District]] cities [[Novy Urengoy]] and [[Noyabrsk]], in spite of high economic indicators, generally lose on 50% of the indicators.

Overall ranking indicates considerable disproportions in city potential, which becomes clear, if we delete [[population dynamics]] indices from the rating. Thus, if we exclude this parameter, the potential of the 1st city will be more than twice as high as of the 10th city and 10 times higher than the potential of the 100th city. Evidently, such a high difference is determined by objective difference of potentials of the cities; it is also important to notice that, in accordance with the Pareto principle, it is not obligatory to improve all the components of qualitative appraisal of cities. Here, the key aspect is economic potential.

It is also necessary to compare some social factors, first of all, the development of [[healthcare]], [[education]], [[social services]] because these are the key indicators.

The overall ranking of cities in the rating shows that even absolute leaders are not so far from the cities in the middle of the rating. This is caused by leveling of low indicators of parameters of some leaders. In particular, the value of the general index of Omsk, which ranks 10th, is just 1,2 times (by 20%) higher than that of the mid-city Mezhdurechensk. The only exception is Moscow (the value of the general indicator is 3 times higher than that of [[Mezhdurechensk]]; 2,5 times higher than that of the 10th city – Omsk – and twice as high as of the 3rd city – Novosibirsk).

Besides, if we analyze the total of indicators of all the cities as their total potential, then the weight of Moscow – the leader of the rating – is 2%, and the weight of Grozny – the last in the rating -  is 0,6%.

For most cities it can be said that the level of economic and industrial development would differ very much depending on [[living conditions]]. This is true for nearly all cities. For example, [[Syberia]] and [[Ural (region)|Ural]] are centers for hydrocarbon production and [[metal mining]]. With the highest [[Per capita income|income rates per capita]], these cities are characterized by the worst [[climate|natural climatic conditions]] and low-developed [[transport system]].

The group of mid-cities comprises rather different cities, ranging from the largest metallurgic mono-cities – Chelyabinsk, Magnitogorsk, Kamensk-Uralsky to cities with quite versatile economy – [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]], [[Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk]], Volzhsky. On the whole, this group consists of either industrially developed centers with negative natural and climatic conditions, or mid-cities of old-cultivated regions, characterized by primarily average values of all indicators.

The lowest indices are found among underdeveloped cities of the North Caucasus and South Siberia. This is connected primarily with [[agriculture|agricultural specialization of the economy]] of these cities and adverse effect of conflicts which took place on the territory of the North Caucasus. The group of depressed cities also includes former large and middle-sized industrial centers which are primarily mono-cities – [[Zlatoust]] (metallurgy), [[Leninsk-Kuznetsky (city)|Leninsk-Kuznetsky]] (metallurgy), [[Norilsk]] (metallurgy), [[Severodvinsk]] (defense industry complex). In money terms, the income difference may be more than by 6,7 times, and, as a rule, not in favour of underdeveloped cities, where income growth rate may be observed primarily in budget sectors and general income growth rate is low. In addition, real income of population grows faster, which is determined by constant production growth in innovation industries.

== Theoretical implications ==

The study and appraisal of urban environment, namely, the parameter of appeal for internal and external factors and consumers, is of value:
* For [[economic science]], from the point of view of developing a system of complex research and appraisal of the quality of Russian cities, making development plans  directed at comprehensive satisfaction of needs of population;
* For [[sociology]], determining the key factors of perception of the city as a whole and of its individual elements.
* For the development of management potential of municipal authorities in terms of balanced management of the system of [[urban infrastructure]].

== Practical implications of the rating ==

On November 21, 2012, in the [[Polytechnical Museum| Polytechnical Museum of Moscow]], the Russian Union of Engineers presented the General rating of appeal of Russian cities for 2011, which attracted much interest among the general public, [[Mass Media]] and local, regional and federal authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuGhTtAYQso&amp;feature=player_embedded|title=Presentations of the General Rating of Russian Cities 2011|publisher=RUE|location=Moscow|date=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2013, the Ministry of Regional Development of the Russian Federation, the [[Gosstroy|Federal Agency of Construction and Housing of the Russian Federation]], Russian Union of Engineers and the experts of [[Moscow State University|Lomonosov Moscow State University]] developed a rating and methodology of  evaluation of urban environment and analyzed 50 largest [[Russian cities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minregion.ru/press_office/news/2939.html |title=The project of Russian cities appeal rating |publisher=The Ministry of Regional Development of the Russian Federation |location=Moscow |date=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012003742/http://www.minregion.ru/press_office/news/2939.html |archivedate=2013-10-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mail.ru/politics/13168733/|title=The Ministry of Regional Development made a rating of appeal of Russian Cities |publisher=|location=Moscow|date=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2013/05/21/goroda-site.html|title=The most attractive cities of Russia are announced|publisher=Russian Newspaper|location=Moscow|date=2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this work, the Union designed the methods of urban environment quality assessment and a city appeal threshold. 
The rating has been developed:

* by the order [[the President of the Russian Federation]] defined in paragraph 1 of Assignments No. Pr-534 of the President of the Russian Federation as of February 29, 2012, to executive bodies as a result of the meeting “On measures of implementation of the housing policy” as of February 14, 2012 
* by the order of the Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation defined in paragraph 4 of the List of assignments № VP-P9-1581  “On development of a methodology of assessment of urban environment quality and assessment of the major cities of Russia”  of the Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation as March 20, 2012.

The '''gonadosomatic index''', abbreviated as '''GSI''', is the calculation of the [[gonad]] mass as a proportion of the total [[body mass]].  It is represented by the formula:&lt;ref name=FD&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Richard O.|last2=Gutreuter|first2=Stephen J.|editor1-last=Nielsen|editor1-first=Larry A.|editor2-last=Johnson|editor2-first=David Lawrence|title=Fisheries techniques|date=1983|publisher=American Fisheries Society|location=Bethesda, Md.|isbn=9780913235003|pages=283-300|chapter=Chapter 15. Length, weight and assoiated structural indices}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;GSI = [gonad weight / total tissue weight] &amp;times; 100&lt;/blockquote&gt;
It is a tool for measuring the [[sexual maturity]] of animals in correlation to [[ovary]] development and [[testes]] development. This index is frequently used as reporting point in OECD test guideline which may be used as indication or evidence of potential endocrine disruption effect of chemicals in regulatory frame work (EFSA and ECHA, 2017)&lt;ref name=EC&gt; Guidance for the identification of endocrine disruptors in the context of Regulations (EU) no 528/2012 and (EC) 1107/2009&lt;/ref&gt;  WHO/IPCS&lt;ref name=who&gt; World Health Organisation/ International Programme for Chemical Safety, 2002 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3626">'''Ground substance''' is an amorphous gel-like substance in the extracellular space that contains all components of the [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) except for fibrous materials such as [[collagen]] and [[elastin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Michelle | last = Peckham | name-list-format = vanc | title = Extracellular Matrix - 'Ground substance' | url = https://www.histology.leeds.ac.uk/tissue_types/connective/connective_groundS.php | publisher = University of Leeds }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ground substance is active in the development, movement, and proliferation of tissues, as well as their metabolism. Additionally, cells use it for support, water storage, binding, and a medium for intercellular exchange (especially between blood cells and other types of cells). Ground substance provides lubrication for collagen fibers.&lt;ref name=atlas&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stecco |first1=Carla |last2=Hammer |first2=Warren |last3=Vleeming |first3=Andry |last4=De Caro |first4=Raffaele | name-list-format = vanc |chapter=Connective Tissues |title=Functional Atlas of the Human Fascial System |pages=1–20 |year=2015 | publisher = Churchill Livingstone Elsevier | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-7020-4430-4.00001-4 | isbn=978-0-7020-4430-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The components of the ground substance vary depending on the tissue. Ground substance is primarily composed of water, [[glycosaminoglycans]] (GAGs) such as [[hyaluronic acid]], [[heparan sulfate]], [[dermatan sulfate]], and [[chondroitin sulfate]], [[proteoglycans]] which GAGs are bound to, and [[glycoproteins]]. Components of the ground substance are secreted by [[fibroblasts]]. Usually it is not visible on slides, because it is lost during staining in the preparation process.&lt;ref name="urlConnective Tissue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courseweb.uottawa.ca/medicine-histology/English/SS_BasicTissues/Connective_Tissue.htm | title=Connective Tissue | work = Self Study Unit of the Basic Tissues | publisher = University of Ottawa |access-date=2008-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107231710/http://www.courseweb.uottawa.ca/medicine-histology/English/SS_BasicTissues/Connective_Tissue.htm |archive-date=2008-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Link proteins such as [[vinculin]], [[spectrin]] and [[actomyosin]] stabilize the proteoglycans and organize elastic fibers in the ECM.&lt;ref name=atlas/&gt; Changes in the density of ground substance can allow collagen fibers to form aberrant cross-links.&lt;ref name=atlas/&gt; [[Loose connective tissue]] is characterized by few fibers and cells, and a relatively large amount of ground substance. [[Dense connective tissue]] has a smaller amount of ground substance compared to the fibrous material.&lt;ref name=atlas/&gt;

The meaning of the term has evolved over time.&lt;ref name="pmid12756276"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wheatley DN | title = Diffusion, perfusion and the exclusion principles in the structural and functional organization of the living cell: reappraisal of the properties of the 'ground substance' | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 206 | issue = Pt 12 | pages = 1955–61 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12756276 | doi = 10.1242/jeb.00238 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11604">'''GrubStreet, Inc.''' is a non-profit creative writing center located in the heart of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Through various workshops, seminars, events and programs, GrubStreet supports writers at all stages of development. According to GrubStreet's website, its mission is "to be an innovative, rigorous, and welcoming community for writers who together create their best work, find audience, and elevate the literary arts for all."&lt;ref name="whatIsGrubStreet"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grubstreet.org/index.php?id=2 | title=What Is Grub Street? | publisher=Grub Street | accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was founded, 53 instructors and 22 students have successfully published their books.&lt;ref name="boston.com"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2010/07/04/empowering_writers/ | title=Empowering writers | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=July 4, 2010 | accessdate=March 29, 2012 | author=Gardner, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those include [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' bestselling]] author [[Jenna Blum]]. GrubStreet is considered to be center of literary life in Boston.&lt;ref name="phoenix"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/other_stories/multi-page/documents/05016163.asp | title=Putting in a good word | work=[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Phoenix]] | date=October 13, 2005 | accessdate=March 29, 2012 | author=Miliard, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

GrubStreet was founded in 1997 in [[Boston]], Massachusetts. Founder [[Eve Bridburg]] opened GrubStreet as a place for anyone interested in creative writing to gain instruction and guidance. At first, GrubStreet only offered fiction workshops, had two instructors (Bridburg one of them) and eight students. GrubStreet demonstrated early success when, a year later in 1998, [[HarperCollins]] published student [[Jamie Katz]]'s mystery novel ''Dead Low Tide''. By 2001 GrubStreet had nearly 100 students, more than a dozen instructors, and courses in poetry, screenwriting, nonfiction, and playwriting. GrubStreet became a fully accredited nonprofit in 2002.&lt;ref name="phoenix"/&gt;

Since then, GrubStreet has taught over 10,000 Boston-area writers of all levels and has put over $1 million into the pockets of writers. It has a fully staffed office overlooking [[Boston Common]] in downtown Boston and operates on an annual budget of $800,000, funded by grants, donations, and membership dues. New books affiliated with GrubStreet include: [[Jenna Blum]]'s ''The Stormchasers''; [[Jonathan Papernick]]'s ''There is No Other''; [[Lynne Reeves Griffin|Lynne Griffin]]'s ''Sea Escape''; [[Michelle Hoover]]'s "The Quickening;" [[Marianne Leone]]'s ''Knowing Jesse''; [[Bruce Machart]]'s ''The Wake of Forgiveness''; [[Randy Susan Meyers]]'s ''The Murderer's Daughters'' and ''The Comfort Of Lies''; [[Amy MacKinnon]]'s ''Tethered''; [[Lisa Genova]]'s ''[[Still Alice]]''; and [[Daphne Kalotay]]'s ''Russian Winter'', Nichole Bernier's ''The Unfinished Work of Elizabeth D'', Julie Wu's forthcoming ''The Third Son'' and [[Henriette Power Lazaridis]]' forthcoming ''Clean Monday''.&lt;ref name="boston.com"/&gt;

==Workshops==

GrubStreet does not offer any writing degrees. Rather, it provides writing instruction that is comparable to an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] program. The pedagogy is, in effect, to offer classes in both the "muse" (inspiration) and "marketplace" (how to get published). The writing workshops --- courses in poetry, fiction, essay, narrative nonfiction, as well as screen and playwriting --- are run like traditional writing workshops, with weekly group critiques of student work, led by the instructor. Classes in the "Writing Life" (time management, blogging, writer's block, etc.) and publishing and promotion (such as classes on submitting to agents or planning book tours) help writers address the marketplace aspects of their writing careers. Courses can be one-night seminars, weekend workshops, or 6- or 10-week-long workshops.

==Membership==

GrubStreet classes are open to all, however the membership provides discounts and benefits. Members, called “Grubbies,” are given discounts on courses, as well as benefit from discounts at all Boston [[independent bookstore]]s. Further benefits include discounts on theatre tickets, magazine subscriptions, free access to the GrubStreet space and library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grubstreet.org/index.php?id=34 | title=join grub street | publisher=Grub Street | accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muse &amp; the Marketplace==

GrubStreet’s signature event, The Muse and the Marketplace, is a three-day, weekend-long writer’s symposium. It is known for attracting acclaimed authors, agents, and editors to its programs.  Hugely successful, the [[Boston Globe]] calls it the “highlight of the Boston literary scene”.&lt;ref name="bostonGlobe2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/05/04/novices_peek_at_literary_world/ | title=Novices peek at literary world | work=The Boston Globe | date=May 4, 2008 | accessdate=March 29, 2012 | author=McKenna, Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is attended by over 900 writers and publishing professionals.&lt;ref name="boston.com"/&gt;

Over the three days, prominent authors lead craft seminars, while agents, editors, and publicists lead sessions on the business aspects of writing. There is also a Manuscript Mart, where writers meet one-on-one with an agent or editor for personalized feedback.  Various seminars, lectures, and panels about creative writing and the business of writing are held.

Many bestselling authors and renowned agents and editors have been involved with GrubStreet’s Muse and the Marketplace. In 2010, [[Chuck Palahniuk]] was the keynote speaker. Other people of note include: [[Steve Almond]], Jessica Shattuck, Jeanne Leiby, Richard Abate, Elyse Cheney, Lynne Barrett, Martha Southgate, Christina Thompson, Jenni Ferrari-Alder, Lisa Grubka, [[Maud Casey]], [[Ben Percy]], Miriam Altshuler, PJ Mark, Vestal McIntyre, Michael Downing, Joseph Olsham, Elizabeth Evans, Tim Bartlett, Susan Tiberghien, Lauren Grodstein, Leslea Newman, Reagan Arthur, Regina Brooks, Joanna Volpe, [[Ann Hood]], Allison Winn Scotch, Christine Pride, Stephany Evans, Mitchell Waters, [[Jennifer 8. Lee]], [[Ethan Gilsdorf]], Ladette Randolph, Elizabeth Weed, Rebecca Oliver, Thomas Mallon, [[Anita Shreve]], Pamela Dorman, Julie Barer, Sorche Fairbank, Nathaniel Rich, [[Pablo Medina]], Janna Malamud Smith, Jofie Ferrari-Alder, Denise Shannon, [[Elizabeth Strout]], Michelle Hoover, Janet Silver, Amy Einhorn, [[Bret Anthony Johnston]], Donovan Campbell, Katherine Fausset, Jill Kneerim, [[Elinor Lipman]], Randy Susan Meyers, [[Jenna Blum]], [[Hallie Ephron]], Lynne Griffin, [[Mameve Medwed]], and Katharine Sands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grubstreet.org/index.php?id=173 | title=The Muse &amp; the Marketplace 2012 | publisher=Grub Street | accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=March 2012}}

==Programs==

===Memoir Project===

Working with the city of Boston, GrubStreet founded the Memoir Project in 2006, which involves older residents in 10 Boston neighborhoods, including [[Nantucket]], to write. The joint effort aims at teaching and encouraging the elderly to use writing as a creative outlet as well as document and preserve their stories for future generations.&lt;ref name="boston.com" /&gt; Neighborhoods involved include: Chinatown, Charlestown, East Boston, Mattapan, Roxbury, [[South Boston]], and the [[North End, Boston|North End]]. Two anthologies of collected works have been published: ''Born Before Plastic'' and “My Legacy Is Simply This: Stories From Boston’s Most Endearing Neighborhoods.” Another anthology is to be published.&lt;ref name="boston.com" /&gt;

===Young Adult Writing Program (YAWP)===

GrubStreet’s Young Adult Writing Program (YAWP) offers free writing workshops for all Boston-area teenagers. The program consists of monthly, 4-hour workshops during a Saturday at the downtown offices. Workshops range from poetry and fiction to graphic novel and are taught by Grub Street instructors.&lt;ref name="grubStreetYAWP"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grubstreet.org/index.php?id=22 | title=Young Adult Writers Program | publisher=Grub Street | accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; YAWP has been recognized as the hub for creative writing teenagers in the Boston area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ethangilsdorf.com/storage/portrait%20of%20young%20bards.pdf | title=Portrait of the young bards | work=The Boston Globe | date=December 24, 2006 | accessdate=March 29, 2012 | author=Junge, Christine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Summer Teen Fellowship===

GrubStreet runs the YAWP Teen Writing Fellowship, an intensive three-week creative writing program during the summer. Accepted teens are immersed in the writers’ life of craft and publishing: they work with published authors, meet with agents and editors, and receive a stipend for their commitment. GrubStreet aims to mimic writers’ residencies, thus the YAWP Fellowship is by application only. About 20 students are accepted each summer.&lt;ref name="grubStreetYAWP" /&gt;

==National Book Prize==

The GrubStreet Book Prize is awarded three times a year to a writer publishing his/her second or beyond.  As the goal of the prize is to bring writers to Boston, only writers whose primary residence is not Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, or Rhode Island are eligible. Though merit is the most important criterion, authors publishing with small presses, writers of short stories, and writers of color are encouraged to apply. 
Winners of the Book Prize each receive $1000, as well as a book party at GrubStreet’s downtown location and co-sponsored by an independent bookstore. Winners will also lead a seminar of his or her choice, with accommodations, travel, and board provided for by GrubStreet. Fiction and non-fiction winners are invited as guest authors to the next Muse and the Marketplace.&lt;ref name="grubStreetYAWP" /&gt;

'''Habit''' is equivalent to '''habitus''' in some applications in [[biology]]; the term refers variously to aspects of behaviour or structure, as follows: 
*In [[zoology]] (particularly in [[ethology]]), '''habit''' usually refers to aspects of more or less predictable ''behaviour'', [[instinct]]ive or otherwise, though it also has broader application. '''Habitus''' refers to the characteristic form or morphology of a species.
*In botany '''habit''' is the characteristic form in which a given species of [[plant]] grows (see [[Glossary of plant morphology#Plant habit]]).&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavior ==
In [[zoology]], ''habit'' (not to be confused with ''habitus'' as described below) usually refers to a specific [[behavior]] pattern, either adopted, [[Learning|learned]], pathological, [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|innate]], or directly related to [[physiology]]. For example:
* ...the [cat] was in the ''habit'' of springing upon the [door knocker] in order to gain admission...&lt;ref name="ChambersChambers1835"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Chambers|author2=Robert Chambers|title=Chambers's Edinburgh Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UnUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA69|year=1835|publisher=W. Orr|pages=69–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* If these sensitive parrots are kept in cages, they quickly take up the ''habit'' of feather plucking.&lt;ref name="LantermannVriends1986"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Werner Lantermann|author2=Matthew M. Vriends|title=New Parrot Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ilp6E-rV4NYC&amp;pg=PA110|year=1986|publisher=Barron's Educational Series|isbn=978-0-8120-3729-6|pages=110–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[spider monkey]] has an [[arboreal]] ''habit'' and rarely ventures onto the [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|forest]] floor.
* The [[brittlestar]] has the ''habit'' of breaking off arms as a means of [[Antipredator adaptation|defense]].

''Mode of life'' (or ''lifestyle'', ''modus vivendi'') is a concept related to ''habit'', and it sometimes is referred to as the ''habit'' of an animal. It may refer to the [[animal locomotion|locomotor]] capabilities, as in "([[motile]] ''habit''", [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]], errant, sedentary), [[feeding behaviour]] and mechanisms, nutrition mode (free-living, [[parasitic nutrition|parasitic]], [[holozoic nutrition|holozoic]], [[saprotrophic]], [[Primary nutritional groups|trophic type]]), type of [[habitat]] ([[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], [[arboreal]], [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]], [[marine biology|marine]], freshwater, seawater, [[benthos|benthic]], [[pelagic]], [[nektonic]], [[planktonic]], etc.),  period of activity ([[Diurnality|diurnal]], [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]]), types of [[ecological interaction]], etc.

The habits of plants and animals often change in response to changes in their [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. For example: if a species develops a disease or there is a drastic change of habitat or local climate, or it is removed to a different region, then the normal habits may change. Such changes may be either [[Wiktionary:pathological|pathological]], or [[Adaptive behavior|adaptive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wynne|first=Parry|title=Disease May Help Shape Animals' Migration Habits|url=http://www.livescience.com/10441-disease-shape-animals-migration-habits.html|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
In [[botany]], habit is the general appearance, growth form, or [[plant architecture|architecture]]. For example:
* Many species of [[maple]] have a [[shrub]]by ''habit'' and may form [[shrub|bushes]] or [[hedge (barrier)|hedge]]s rather than [[tree]]s.
* Certain [[alpine plants]] have been chosen for [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] because of their [[dwarfing|dwarf]] ''habit''.

Plants may be [[woody plant|woody]] or [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]]. The main types of woody plants are [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s and [[liana]]s. Climbing plants ([[vine]]s) can be woody (lianas) or herbaceous (nonwoody vines). Plants can also be categorized in terms of their ''habit'' as [[subshrub]]s (dwarf shrub, bush), [[cushion plant]]s and [[succulent]]s.

There is some overlap between the classifications of plants according to their habit and their [[plant life-form|life-form]].

Other terms in biology refer similarly to various [[Taxon|taxa]]; for example:
* [[Fungi]] are described by their ''growth patterns'': [[mold]]s, [[yeast]]s, [[mushroom]]s and [[dimorphic fungi]]. 
* [[Lichen]]s structure is described their ''growth form'': foliose, [[crustose]], fruticose or gelatinous.
* [[Bryophyte]]s structure is described as foliose or [[thallose]].
* The structure of a given species of [[algae]] is referred to as its ''type'' or ''{{Interlanguage link multi|level of organization|de|3=Organisationsstufe}}''. 
* [[Bacteria]] are described by their ''[[Bacterial cellular morphologies|morphology]]'' or ''shape''. 
* [[Animal]] structure is described by  its ''[[body plan]]'', which encompasses the [[body symmetry]], the type of [[germ layer]]s and of [[body cavity|body cavities]].

Since the distinction between the concepts – mode of behavior and [[Morphology (biology)|morphological form]] – are significant in zoology, the term ''habitus'' (from which the word ''habit'' derives) is used to describe form as distinct from behaviour (''habit''). The term ''habitus'' also occurs in botanical texts, but there it is used almost interchangeably with ''habit'', because plant behaviour generally does not correspond closely to the concept of habits in the zoological sense.

{{Redirect|high-level||High level (disambiguation){{!}}High level}}
'''High-level''' and '''low-level''', as technical terms, are used to classify, describe and point to specific [[Objective (goal)|goal]]s of a systematic operation; and are applied in a wide range of contexts, such as, for instance, in domains as widely varied as [[computer science]] and [[business administration]].

'''High-level''' describe those operations that are more [[abstraction|abstract]] in nature; wherein the overall goals and systemic features are typically more concerned with the wider, macro system as a whole.

'''Low-level''' describes more specific individual components of a systematic operation, focusing on the details of rudimentary micro functions rather than macro, complex processes. Low-level classification is typically more concerned with individual components within the system and how they operate.

Features which emerge only at a high level of description are known as [[epiphenomenon|epiphenomena]].

==Differences and similarities==
Due to the nature of [[complex systems]], the high-level description will often be completely different from the low level one; and, therefore, the (different) descriptions that each deliver are consequent upon the level at which each (differently) direct their study. For example,
* there are features of an [[ant colony]] that are not features of any individual [[ant]];
* there are features of the human [[mind]] that are not known to be descriptive of individual [[neuron]]s in the [[brain]];
* there are features of [[ocean]]s which are not features of any individual [[water molecule]]; and
* there are features of a human [[personality]] that are not features of any [[cell (biology)|cell]] in a body.

==Uses==
* In computer science, software are typically divided into two types: '''high-level''' end-user applications software (such as word processors, databases, video games, etc.), and '''low-level''' systems software (such as operation systems, hardware drivers, etc.).&lt;br&gt;As such, '''high-level''' applications typically rely on '''low-level''' applications to function.&lt;br&gt;In terms of programming, a [[high-level programming language]] is one which has a relatively high level of abstraction, and manipulates conceptual functions in a structured manner.&lt;br&gt;A [[low-level programming language]] is one like [[assembly language]] that contains rudimentary [[microprocessor]] commands.
* In [[formal methods]], a high-level [[formal specification]] can be related to a low-level executable [[implementation]] (e.g., formally by [[mathematical proof]] using [[formal verification]] techniques).
* In [[sociology]] and [[social anthropology]], high-level descriptions would be terms like [[economy]] and [[politics|political structure]], and low level descriptions would be individual peoples' motivations and work.
* In neuroscience, low-level would relate to the functioning of a cell (or part of a cell, or molecule) and high level to the overall function or activity of a neural system.
* In documentation, a [[high-level document]] contains the [[executive summary]], the [[low-level document]]s the technical specifications.
* In business, [[corporate strategy]] is a high-level description, a list of who does what jobs is a low level description.

==Examples==
* ''[[Climate]]'' is a high-level description of the actions of the [[atmosphere]] and [[ocean]]s. [[Physics]] of [[water]] and [[gas]] molecules is a low-level description of the same system.
* The instruction "write a creative poem on love" is a high-level instruction. The instruction "tighten the [[tendon]]s in the [[Handedness|dominant]] [[wrist]] to grip the [[pen]]" is a low-level description of an activity within that.
* ''"Wikipedia is an encyclopedia"'' is a high-level description compared to ''"Wikipedia is a collection of textual articles on many topics"''. The former reflects a higher level view of organization, purpose, concept and structure, but does not explain what Wikipedia physically ''is''. The latter is more detailed as to what exactly Wikipedia contains and how it's made up, but doesn't explain what its overall purpose and goals are. These are typical features of high-level and low-level descriptions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="85624">[[Horizontal gene transfer|Horizontal or lateral gene transfer]] (HGT or LGT) is the transmission of portions of genomic [[DNA]] between organisms through a process decoupled from [[Vertical transfer|vertical inheritance]]. In the presence of HGT events, different fragments of the [[genome]] are the result of different [[evolution]]ary histories. This can therefore complicate the investigations of evolutionary relatedness of lineages and species. Also, as HGT can bring into genomes radically different [[genotype]]s from distant lineages, or even new [[gene]]s bearing new functions, it is a major source of [[phenotype|phenotypic]] innovation and a mechanism of [[niche adaptation]]. For example, of particular relevance to human health is the lateral transfer of [[antibiotic resistance]] and [[pathogenicity]] determinants, leading to the emergence of pathogenic lineages.&lt;ref name=Hiramatsu2001/&gt;

'''Inferring horizontal gene transfer''' through [[computational phylogenetics|computational]] identification of HGT events relies upon the investigation of sequence composition or evolutionary history of genes. Sequence composition-based ("parametric") methods search for deviations from the genomic average whereas evolutionary history-based ("[[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]]") approaches identify genes whose evolutionary history significantly differs from that of the host [[species]]. The evaluation and benchmarking of HGT inference methods typically rely upon simulated genomes, for which the true history is known. On real data, different methods tend to infer different HGT events, and as a result it can be difficult to ascertain all but simple and clear-cut HGT events.

==Overview==
Horizontal gene transfer was first observed in 1928, in [[Frederick Griffith]]'s [[Griffith's experiment|experiment]]: showing that virulence was able to pass from virulent to non-virulent strains of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', Griffith demonstrated that genetic information can be horizontally transferred between [[bacteria]] via a mechanism known as [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]].&lt;ref name="Griffith1928"/&gt; Similar observations in the 1940s&lt;ref name="Lederberg1946"/&gt; and 1950s&lt;ref name="Zinder1952"/&gt; showed evidence that [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] and [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]] are additional mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer.&lt;ref name="Jones1970"&gt;{{Cite journal

To infer HGT events, which may not necessarily result in [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] changes, most contemporary methods are based on analyses of genomic sequence data. These methods can be broadly separated into two groups: parametric and phylogenetic methods (see [[#Fig-1|Figure 1]]). Parametric methods search for sections of a genome that significantly differ from the genomic average, such as [[GC-content|GC content]] or [[Codon usage bias|codon usage]].&lt;ref name="Lawrence2002" /&gt; Phylogenetic methods examine evolutionary histories of genes involved and identify conflicting phylogenies. Phylogenetic methods can be further divided into those that reconstruct and compare [[phylogenetic tree]]s explicitly, and those that use surrogate measures in place of the phylogenetic trees.&lt;ref name="Dessimoz2008" /&gt;

The main feature of parametric methods is that they only rely on the genome under study to infer HGT events that may have occurred on its lineage. It has been a considerable advantage at the early times of the sequencing era, when few closely related genomes were available for comparative methods. However, because they rely on the uniformity of the host's signature to infer HGT events, not accounting for the host's intra-genomic variability will result in overpredictions&amp;mdash;flagging native segments as possible HGT events.&lt;ref name="Guindon2001" /&gt; Similarly, the transferred segments need to exhibit the donor's signature and to be significantly different from the recipient's.&lt;ref name="Lawrence2002" /&gt; Furthermore, genomic segments of foreign origin are subject to the same [[mutation]]al processes as the rest of the host genome, and so the difference between the two tends to vanish over time, a process referred to as amelioration.&lt;ref name="Lawrence1997" /&gt; This limits the ability of parametric methods to detect ancient HGTs.

Phylogenetic methods benefit from the recent availability of [[List of sequenced eukaryotic genomes|many sequenced genomes]]. Indeed, as for all [[comparative biology|comparative]] methods, phylogenetic methods can integrate information from multiple genomes, and in particular integrate them using a model of evolution. This lends them the ability to better characterize the HGT events they infer—notably by designating the donor species and time of the transfer. However, models have limits and need to be used cautiously. For instance, the conflicting phylogenies can be the result of events not accounted for by the model, such as unrecognized [[Homology (biology)#Paralogy|paralogy]] due to [[Gene duplication|duplication]] followed by [[Human evolutionary genetics#Gene loss|gene losses]]. Also, many approaches rely on a reference species tree that is supposed to be known, when in many instances it can be difficult to obtain a reliable tree. Finally, the computational costs of reconstructing many gene/species trees can be prohibitively expensive. Phylogenetic methods tend to be applied to genes or [[protein sequence]]s as basic evolutionary units, which limits their ability to detect HGT in regions outside or across gene boundaries.

{{anchor|Fig-1}}[[Image:Inferring horizontal gene transfer conceptual overview.svg|632px|thumb|center|Figure 1. Conceptual overview of HGT inference methods. (1) Parametric methods infer HGT by computing a statistic, here GC content, for a sliding window and comparing it to the typical range over the entire genome, here indicated between the two red horizontal lines. Regions with atypical values are inferred as having been horizontally transferred. (2) Phylogenetic approaches rely on the differences between genes and species tree evolution that result from HGT. Explicit phylogenetic methods reconstruct gene trees and infer the HGT events likely to have resulted into that particular gene tree. Implicit phylogenetic methods bypass gene tree reconstruction, e.g., by looking at discrepancies between pairwise distances between genes and their corresponding species.]]

Because of their complementary approaches&amp;mdash;and often non-overlapping sets of HGT candidates&amp;mdash;combining [[Prediction#Prediction in science|predictions]] from parametric and phylogenetic methods can yield a more comprehensive set of HGT [[candidate gene]]s. Indeed, combining different parametric methods has been reported to significantly improve the quality of predictions.&lt;ref name="Azad2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Xiong2012" /&gt; Moreover, in the absence of a comprehensive set of true horizontally transferred genes, discrepancies between different methods&lt;ref name="Becq2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Poptsova2009" /&gt; might be resolved through combining parametric and phylogenetic methods. However, combining inferences from multiple methods also entails a risk of an increased [[Type I and type II errors|false-positive rate]].&lt;ref name="Poptsova2007" /&gt;

==Parametric methods==
Parametric methods to infer HGT use characteristics of the genome sequence specific to particular species or [[clade]]s, also called [[genomic signature]]s. If a fragment of the genome strongly deviates from the genomic signature, this is a sign of a potential horizontal transfer. For example, because bacterial GC content falls within a wide range (see [[#Fig-2|Figure 2]]), GC content of a genome segment is a simple genomic signature. Commonly used genomic signatures include [[nucleotide]] composition,&lt;ref name="Daubin2003" /&gt; [[oligonucleotide]] frequencies,&lt;ref name="Lawrence1998" /&gt; or structural features of the genome.&lt;ref name="Worning2000" /&gt;

To detect HGT using parametric methods, the host's genomic signature needs to be clearly recognizable. However, the host's genome is not always uniform with respect to the genome signature: for example, GC content of the third codon position is lower close to the [[DNA replication|replication]] terminus &lt;ref name="Deschavanne1995" /&gt; and GC content tends to be higher in highly [[gene expression|expressed]] genes.&lt;ref name="Wuitschick1999" /&gt; Not accounting for such intra-genomic variability in the host can result in over-predictions, flagging native segments as HGT candidates.&lt;ref name="Guindon2001" /&gt; Larger sliding windows can account for this variability at the cost of a reduced ability to detect smaller HGT regions.&lt;ref name="Becq2010" /&gt;

Just as importantly, horizontally transferred segments need to exhibit the donor's genomic signature. This might not be the case for ancient transfers where transferred sequences are subjected to the same mutational processes as the rest of the host genome, potentially causing their distinct signatures to "ameliorate"&lt;ref name="Lawrence1997" /&gt; and become undetectable through parametric methods. For example, ''[[Bdellovibrio|Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus]]'', a predatory [[Deltaproteobacteria|δ-Proteobacterium]], has homogeneous GC content, and it might be concluded that its genome is resistant to HGT.&lt;ref name="Rendulic2004" /&gt; However, subsequent analysis using phylogenetic methods identified a number of ancient HGT events in the genome of ''B. bacteriovorus''.&lt;ref name="Gophna2006" /&gt; Similarly, if the inserted segment was previously ameliorated to the host's genome, as is the case for [[prophage]] insertions,&lt;ref name="Vernikos2007" /&gt; parametric methods might miss predicting these HGT events. Also, the donor's composition must significantly differ from the recipient's to be identified as abnormal, a condition that might be missed in the case of short- to medium-distance HGT, which are the most prevalent. Furthermore, it has been reported that recently acquired genes tend to be [[GC-content|AT-richer]] than the recipient's average,&lt;ref name="Daubin2003" /&gt; which indicates that differences in GC-content signature may result from unknown post-acquisition mutational processes rather than from the donor's genome.

===Nucleotide composition===
{{anchor|Fig-2}}[[Image:Inferring horizontal gene transfer average GC content.svg|400px|thumb|right|Figure 2. Average GC content of coding regions compared to the genome size for selected bacteria. There is considerable variation in average GC content across species, which makes it relevant as a genomic signature.]]

Bacterial GC content falls within a wide range, with ''Ca. Zinderia insecticola'' having a GC content of 13.5%&lt;ref name="McCutcheon2010" /&gt; and ''[[Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans]]'' having a GC content of 75%&lt;ref name="Liu2008" /&gt; (see [[#Fig-2|Figure 2]]). Even within a closely related group of [[Alphaproteobacteria|α-Proteobacteria]], values range from approximately 30% to 65%.&lt;ref name="Bentley2004" /&gt; These differences can be exploited when detecting HGT events as a significantly different GC content for a genome segment can be an indication of foreign origin&lt;ref name="Daubin2003" /&gt; (see [[#Fig-2|Figure 2]]).

===Oligonucleotide spectrum===
The oligonucleotide spectrum (or [[k-mer]] frequencies) measures the frequency of all possible nucleotide sequences of a particular length in the genome. It tends to vary less within genomes than between genomes and therefore can also be used as a genomic signature.&lt;ref name="Karlin1995" /&gt; A deviation from this signature suggests that a genomic segment might have arrived through horizontal transfer.

The oligonucleotide spectrum owes much of its discriminatory power to the number of possible oligonucleotides: if n is the size of the vocabulary and w is oligonucleotide size, the [[Exponentiation#Combinatorial interpretation|number of possible distinct oligonucleotides]] is n&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;; for example, there are 4&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;=1024 possible pentanucleotides. Some methods can capture the signal recorded in motifs of variable size,&lt;ref name="Vernikos2006" /&gt; thus capturing both rare and discriminative motifs along with frequent, but more common ones.

[[Codon usage bias]], a measure related to [[DNA codon table|codon]] frequencies, was one of the first detection methods used in methodical assessments of HGT.&lt;ref name="Lawrence1998" /&gt; This approach requires a host genome which contains a bias towards certain synonymous codons (different codons which code for the same amino acid) which is clearly distinct from the bias found within the donor genome. The simplest oligonucleotide used as a genomic signature is the dinucleotide, for example the third nucleotide in a codon and the first nucleotide in the following codon represent the dinucleotide least restricted by [[amino acid]] preference and codon usage.&lt;ref name="Hooper2002" /&gt;

It is important to optimise the size of the sliding window in which to count the oligonucleotide frequency: a larger sliding window will better buffer variability in the host genome at the cost of being worse at detecting smaller HGT regions.&lt;ref name="Deschavanne1999" /&gt; A good compromise has been reported using tetranucleotide frequencies in a sliding window of 5&amp;nbsp;[[Base pair#Length measurements|kb]] with a step of 0.5kb.&lt;ref name="Dufraigne2005" /&gt;

A convenient method of modelling oligonucleotide genomic signatures is to use [[Markov chain]]s. The transition probability matrix can be derived for endogenous vs. acquired genes,&lt;ref name="Cortez2009" /&gt; from which Bayesian [[Posterior probability|posterior probabilities]] for particular stretches of DNA can be obtained.&lt;ref name=Nakamura2004 /&gt;

===Structural features===
Just as the nucleotide composition of a DNA molecule can be represented by a sequence of letters, its structural features can be encoded in a numerical sequence. The structural features include [[Interaction energy|interaction energies]] between neighbouring base pairs,&lt;ref name="Ornstein1978" /&gt; the angle of twist that makes two bases of a [[base pair|pair]] non-[[Coplanarity|coplanar]],&lt;ref name="elHassan1996" /&gt; or DNA deformability induced by the proteins shaping the chromatin.&lt;ref name="Olson1998" /&gt;

The [[autocorrelation]] analysis of some of these numerical sequences show characteristic periodicities in complete genomes.&lt;ref name="Herzel1999" /&gt; In fact, after detecting [[archaea]]-like regions in the [[Thermophile|thermophilic]] bacteria ''[[Thermotoga maritima]]'',&lt;ref name="Nelson1999" /&gt; periodicity spectra of these regions were compared to the periodicity spectra of the [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] regions in the archaea ''[[Pyrococcus horikoshii]]''.&lt;ref name="Worning2000" /&gt; The revealed similarities in the periodicity were strong supporting evidence for a case of massive HGT between the bacteria and the archaea [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]].&lt;ref name="Worning2000" /&gt;

===Genomic context===
The existence of [[genomic island]]s, short (typically 10–200kb long) regions of a genome which have been acquired horizontally, lends support to the ability to identify non-native genes by their [[Locus (genetics)|location]] in a genome.&lt;ref name="Langille2010" /&gt; For example, a gene of ambiguous origin which forms part of a non-native [[operon]] could be considered to be non-native. Alternatively, flanking [[Repeated sequence (DNA)|repeat sequences]] or the presence of nearby [[integrase]]s or [[transposase]]s can indicate a non-native region.&lt;ref name="Hacker1997" /&gt; A [[machine learning|machine-learning]] approach combining oligonucleotide frequency scans with context information was reported to be effective at identifying genomic islands.&lt;ref name="Vernikos2008" /&gt; In another study, the context was used as a secondary indicator, after removal of genes which are strongly thought to be native or non-native through the use of other parametric methods.&lt;ref name="Azad2011" /&gt;

==Phylogenetic methods==
The use of phylogenetic analysis in the detection of HGT was advanced by the availability of many newly sequenced genomes. Phylogenetic methods detect inconsistencies in gene and species evolutionary history in two ways: explicitly, by reconstructing the gene tree and reconciling it with the reference species tree, or implicitly, by examining aspects that correlate with the evolutionary history of the genes in question, e.g., patterns of presence/absence across species, or unexpectedly short or distant pairwise evolutionary distances.

===Explicit phylogenetic methods===
The aim of explicit phylogenetic methods is to compare gene trees with their associated species trees. While weakly supported differences between gene and species trees can be due to inference uncertainty, statistically significant differences can be suggestive of HGT events (see [[#Fig-1a|Figure 1a]]). For example, if two genes from different species share the most recent ancestral connecting node in the gene tree, but the respective species are spaced apart in the species tree, an HGT event can be invoked. Such an approach can produce more detailed results than parametric approaches because the involved species, time and direction of transfer can potentially be identified.

As discussed in more detail below, phylogenetic methods range from simple methods merely identifying discordance between gene and species trees to mechanistic models inferring probable sequences of HGT events. An intermediate strategy entails deconstructing the gene tree into smaller parts until each matches the species tree (genome spectral approaches).

Explicit phylogenetic methods rely upon the accuracy of the input rooted gene and species trees, yet these can be challenging to build.&lt;ref name="Altenhoff2012" /&gt; Even when there is no doubt in the input trees, the conflicting phylogenies can be the result of evolutionary processes other than HGT, such as duplications and losses, causing these methods to erroneously infer HGT events when [[Homology (biology)#Paralogy|paralogy]] is the correct explanation. Similarly, in the presence of [[incomplete lineage sorting]], explicit phylogeny methods can erroneously infer HGT events.&lt;ref name="Than2007" /&gt; That is why some explicit model-based methods test multiple evolutionary scenarios involving different kinds of events, and compare their fit to the data given [[Occam's razor|parsimonious]] or [[Probability theory|probabilistic]] criteria.

====Tests of topologies====
To detect sets of genes that fit poorly to the reference tree, one can use [[Statistical hypothesis testing|statistical tests]] of topology, such as the Kishino–Hasegawa (KH),&lt;ref name="Goldman2000" /&gt; Shimodaira–Hasegawa (SH),&lt;ref name="Shimodaira1999" /&gt; and Approximately Unbiased (AU)&lt;ref name="Shimodaira2002" /&gt; tests. These tests assess the likelihood of the gene [[sequence alignment]] when the reference topology is given as the null hypothesis.

The rejection of the reference [[topology]] is an indication that the evolutionary history for that [[gene family]] is inconsistent with the reference tree. When these inconsistencies cannot be explained using a small number of non-horizontal events, such as gene loss and duplication, an HGT event is inferred.

One such analysis checked for HGT in groups of homologs of the [[Gammaproteobacteria|γ-Proteobacterial]] lineage.&lt;ref name="Lerat2003" /&gt; Six reference trees were reconstructed using either the highly conserved small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences, a consensus of the available gene trees or concatenated alignments of [[Homology (biology)#Orthology|orthologs]]. The failure to reject the six evaluated topologies, and the rejection of seven alternative topologies, was interpreted as evidence for a small number of HGT events in the selected groups.

Tests of topology identify differences in tree topology taking into account the uncertainty in tree inference but they make no attempt at inferring ''how'' the differences came about. To infer the specifics of particular events, genome spectral or [[Tree rearrangement|subtree pruning and regraft]] methods are required.

====Genome spectral approaches====
In order to identify the location of HGT events, genome spectral approaches decompose a gene tree into substructures (such as [[Bipartite graph|bipartitions]] or quartets) and identify those that are consistent or inconsistent with the species tree.

'''Bipartitions'''
Removing one [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|edge]] from a reference tree produces two unconnected sub-trees, each a disjoint set of nodes&amp;mdash;a bipartition. If a bipartition is present in both the gene and the species trees, it is compatible; otherwise, it is conflicting. These conflicts can indicate an HGT event or may be the result of uncertainty in gene tree inference. To reduce uncertainty, bipartition analyses typically focus on strongly supported bipartitions such as those associated with branches with [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrap]] values or posterior probabilities above certain thresholds. Any gene family found to have one or several conflicting, but strongly supported, bipartitions is considered as an HGT candidate.&lt;ref name="Zhaxybayeva2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beiko2005" /&gt;

'''Quartet decomposition'''
Quartets are trees consisting of four leaves. In bifurcating (fully resolved) trees, each internal branch induces a quartet whose leaves are either subtrees of the original tree or actual leaves of the original tree. If the topology of a quartet extracted from the reference species tree is embedded in the gene tree, the quartet is compatible with the gene tree. Conversely, incompatible strongly supported quartets indicate potential HGT events.&lt;ref name="Zhaxybayeva2006" /&gt; Quartet mapping methods are much more [[Algorithmic efficiency|computationally efficient]] and naturally handle heterogeneous representation of taxa among gene families, making them a good basis for developing large-scale scans for HGT, looking for highways of gene sharing in databases of hundreds of complete genomes.&lt;ref name="Bansal2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bansal2013" /&gt;

====Subtree pruning and regrafting====
A mechanistic way of modelling an HGT event on the reference tree is to first cut an internal branch—i.e., prune the tree—and then regraft it onto another edge, an operation referred to as [[Tree rearrangement|subtree pruning and regrafting]] (SPR).&lt;ref name="Hallett2001" /&gt; If the gene tree was topologically consistent with the original reference tree, the editing results in an inconsistency. Similarly, when the original gene tree is inconsistent with the reference tree, it is possible to obtain a consistent topology by a series of one or more prune and regraft operations applied to the reference tree. By interpreting the edit path of pruning and regrafting, HGT candidate nodes can be flagged and the host and donor genomes inferred.&lt;ref name="Beiko2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baroni2005"/&gt; To avoid reporting false positive HGT events due to uncertain gene tree topologies, the optimal "path" of SPR operations can be chosen among multiple possible combinations by considering the branch support in the gene tree. Weakly supported gene tree edges can be ignored a priori&lt;ref name="Beiko2006" /&gt; or the support can be used to compute an optimality criterion.&lt;ref name="Nakhleh2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Abby2010" /&gt;

Because conversion of one tree to another by a minimum number of SPR operations is [[NP-hard|NP-Hard]],&lt;ref name="Hickey2008" /&gt; solving the problem becomes considerably more difficult as more nodes are considered. The computational challenge lies in finding the optimal edit path, i.e., the one that requires the fewest steps,&lt;ref name="Hein1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen2001" /&gt; and different strategies are used in solving the problem. For example, the HorizStory algorithm reduces the problem by first eliminating the consistent nodes;&lt;ref name="MacLeod2005" /&gt; recursive pruning and regrafting reconciles the reference tree with the gene tree and optimal edits are interpreted as HGT events. The SPR methods included in the supertree reconstruction package SPRSupertrees substantially decrease the time of the search for the optimal set of SPR operations by considering multiple localised sub-problems in large trees through a clustering approach.&lt;ref name="Whidden2014" /&gt;

====Model-based reconciliation methods====
Reconciliation of gene and species trees entails mapping evolutionary events onto gene trees in a way that makes them concordant with the species tree. Different reconciliation models exist, differing in the types of event they consider to explain the incongruences between gene and species tree topologies. Early methods exclusively modelled horizontal transfers (T).&lt;ref name="Hallett2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nakhleh2005"/&gt; More recent ones also account for duplication (D), loss (L), [[incomplete lineage sorting]] (ILS) or [[homologous recombination]] (HR) events. The difficulty is that by allowing for multiple types of events, the number of possible reconciliations increases rapidly. For instance, a conflicting gene tree topologies might be explained in terms of a single HGT event or multiple duplication and loss events. Both alternatives can be considered plausible reconciliation depending on the frequency of these respective events along the species tree.

Reconciliation methods can rely on a [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimonious]] or a [[Computational phylogenetics#Maximum likelihood|probabilistic]] framework to infer the most likely scenario(s), where the relative cost/probability of D, T, L events can be fixed a priori or estimated from the data.&lt;ref name="Doyon2011"/&gt; The space of DTL reconciliations and their parsimony costs—which can be extremely vast for large multi-copy gene family trees—can be efficiently explored through [[dynamic programming]] algorithms.&lt;ref name="Doyon2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DavidAlm2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Szollosi2012" /&gt; In some programs, the gene tree topology can be refined where it was uncertain to fit a better evolutionary scenario as well as the initial sequence alignment.&lt;ref name="DavidAlm2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nguyen2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Szollosi2013b" /&gt; More refined models account for the biased frequency of HGT between closely related lineages,&lt;ref name="BansalAlm2012" /&gt; reflecting the loss of efficiency of [[Homologous recombination|HR]] with phylogenetic distance,&lt;ref name="Majewski2000" /&gt; for [[incomplete lineage sorting|ILS]],&lt;ref name="Sjostrand2014" /&gt; or for the fact that the actual donor of most HGT belong to extinct or unsampled lineages.&lt;ref name="Szollosi2013a" /&gt; Further extensions of DTL models are being developed towards an integrated description of the genome evolution processes. In particular, some of them consider horizontal at multiple scales&amp;mdash;modelling independent evolution of gene fragments&lt;ref name="Haggerty2014" /&gt; or recognising [[co-evolution]] of several genes (e.g., due to co-transfer) within and across genomes.&lt;ref name="Szollosi2014" /&gt;

===Implicit phylogenetic methods===
In contrast to explicit phylogenetic methods, which compare the agreement between gene and species trees, implicit phylogenetic methods compare evolutionary distances or sequence similarity. Here, an unexpectedly short or long distance from a given reference compared to the average can be suggestive of an HGT event (see [[#Fig-1|Figure 1]]). Because tree construction is not required, implicit approaches tend to be simpler and faster than explicit methods.

However, implicit methods can be limited by disparities between the underlying correct phylogeny and the evolutionary distances considered. For instance, the most similar sequence as obtained by the highest-scoring [[BLAST]] hit is not always the evolutionarily closest one.&lt;ref name="Koski2001" /&gt;

====Top sequence match in a distant species====
A simple way of identifying HGT events is by looking for high-scoring sequence matches in distantly related species. For example, an analysis of the top BLAST hits of protein sequences in the bacteria ''Thermotoga maritima'' revealed that most hits were in archaea rather than closely related bacteria, suggesting extensive HGT between the two;&lt;ref name="Nelson1999" /&gt; these predictions were later supported by an analysis of the structural features of the DNA molecule.&lt;ref name="Worning2000" /&gt;

However, this method is limited to detecting relatively recent HGT events. Indeed, if the HGT occurred in the [[Common descent|common ancestor]] of two or more species included in the database, the closest hit will reside within that clade and therefore the HGT will not be detected by the method. Thus, the threshold of the minimum number of foreign top BLAST hits to observe to decide a gene was transferred is highly dependent on the taxonomic coverage of sequence databases. Therefore, experimental settings may need to be defined in an ad-hoc way.&lt;ref name="WisniewskiDye2011" /&gt;

====Discrepancy between gene and species distances====
The [[molecular clock]] hypothesis posits that homologous genes evolve at an approximately constant rate across different species.&lt;ref name="Zuckerkandl1962" /&gt; If one only considers homologous genes related through [[Speciation|speciation events]] (referred to as “orthologous" genes), their underlying tree should by definition correspond to the species tree. Therefore, assuming a molecular clock, the evolutionary distance between orthologous genes should be approximately proportional to the evolutionary distances between their respective species. If a putative group of orthologs contains [[Xenolog#Xenology|xenologs]] (pairs of genes related through an HGT), the proportionality of evolutionary distances may only hold among the orthologs, not the xenologs.&lt;ref name="Novichkov2004" /&gt;

Simple approaches compare the distribution of similarity scores of particular sequences and their orthologous counterparts in other species; HGT are inferred from outliers.&lt;ref name="Lawrence1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clarke2002" /&gt; The more sophisticated DLIGHT ('Distance Likelihood-based Inference of Genes Horizontally Transferred') method considers simultaneously the effect of HGT on all sequences within groups of putative orthologs:&lt;ref name="Dessimoz2008" /&gt; if a [[likelihood-ratio test]] of the HGT hypothesis versus a hypothesis of no HGT is significant, a putative HGT event is inferred. In addition, the method allows inference of potential donor and recipient species and provides an estimation of the time since the HGT event.

====Phylogenetic profiles====
A group of orthologous or homologous genes can be analysed in terms of the presence or absence of group members in the reference genomes; such patterns are called [[Phylogenetic profiling|phylogenetic profiles]].&lt;ref name="Pellegrini1999" /&gt; To find HGT events, phylogenetic profiles are scanned for an unusual distribution of genes. Absence of a homolog in some members of a group of closely related species is an indication that the examined gene might have arrived via an HGT event. For example, the three facultatively symbiotic ''[[Frankia|Frankia sp.]]'' strains are of strikingly different sizes: 5.43 Mbp, 7.50 Mbp and 9.04 Mbp, depending on their range of hosts.&lt;ref name="Normand2007" /&gt; Marked portions of strain-specific genes were found to have no significant hit in the reference database, and were possibly acquired by HGT transfers from other bacteria. Similarly, the three phenotypically diverse ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' strains ([[Uropathy|uropathogenic]], [[Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli|enterohemorrhagic]] and benign) share about 40% of the total combined [[gene pool]], with the other 60% being strain-specific genes and consequently HGT candidates.&lt;ref name="Welch2002" /&gt; Further evidence for these genes resulting from HGT was their strikingly different codon usage patterns from the core genes and a lack of [[Synteny|gene order conservation]] (order conservation is typical of vertically evolved genes).&lt;ref name="Welch2002" /&gt; The presence/absence of homologs (or their effective count) can thus be used by programs to reconstruct the most likely evolutionary scenario along the species tree. Just as with [[#Model-based reconciliation methods|reconciliation methods]], this can be achieved through parsimonious&lt;ref name="Csuros2008" /&gt; or probabilistic estimation of the number of gain and loss events.&lt;ref name="Pagel1999" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Csuros2009" /&gt; Models can be complexified by adding processes, like the truncation of genes,&lt;ref name="HaoGolding2010" /&gt; but also by modelling the heterogeneity of rates of gain and loss across lineages&lt;ref name="HaoGolding2006" /&gt; and/or gene families.&lt;ref name="Csuros2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HaoGolding2008" /&gt;

====Clusters of polymorphic sites====
Genes are commonly regarded as the basic units transferred through an HGT event. However it is also possible for HGT to occur within genes. For example, it has been shown that horizontal transfer between closely related species results in more exchange of [[Open reading frame|ORF]] fragments,&lt;ref name="Ochman2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Papke2004" /&gt; a type a transfer called [[gene conversion]], mediated by homologous recombination. The analysis of a group of four ''Escherichia coli'' and two ''[[Shigella flexneri]]'' strains revealed that the sequence stretches common to all six strains contain [[Gene polymorphism|polymorphic sites]], consequences of homologous recombination.&lt;ref name="Mau2006" /&gt; Clusters of excess of polymorphic sites can thus be used to detect tracks of DNA recombined with a distant relative.&lt;ref name="Didelot2007" /&gt; This method of detection is, however, restricted to the sites in common to all analysed sequences, limiting the analysis to a group of closely related organisms.

==Evaluation==
The existence of the numerous and varied methods to infer HGT raises the question of how to validate individual inferences and of how to compare the different methods.

A main problem is that, as with other types of phylogenetic inferences, the actual evolutionary history cannot be established with certainty. As a result, it is difficult to obtain a representative [[test set]] of HGT events. Furthermore, HGT inference methods vary considerably in the information they consider and often identify inconsistent groups of HGT candidates:&lt;ref name="Lawrence2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ragan2001" /&gt; it is not clear to what extent taking the [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]], the [[Union (set theory)|union]], or some other combination of the individual methods affects the [[Type I and type II errors#Type I error|false positive]] and [[Type I and type II errors#Type II error|false negative]] rates.&lt;ref name="Poptsova2007" /&gt;

Parametric and phylogenetic methods draw on different sources of information; it is therefore difficult to make general statements about their relative performance. Conceptual arguments can however be invoked. While parametric methods are limited to the analysis of single or pairs of genomes, phylogenetic methods provide a natural framework to take advantage of the information contained in multiple genomes. In many cases, segments of genomes inferred as HGT based on their anomalous composition can also be recognised as such on the basis of phylogenetic analyses or through their mere absence in genomes of related organisms. In addition, phylogenetic methods rely on explicit models of sequence evolution, which provide a well-understood framework for parameter inference, hypothesis testing, and model selection. This is reflected in the literature, which tends to favour phylogenetic methods as the standard of proof for HGT.&lt;ref name="Ragan2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kechris2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moran2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Danchin2010" /&gt; The use of phylogenetic methods thus appears to be the preferred standard, especially given that the [[Moore's law|increase in computational power]] coupled with algorithmic improvements has made them more tractable,&lt;ref name="Whidden2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Szollosi2013a" /&gt; and that the ever denser sampling of genomes lends more power to these tests.

Considering phylogenetic methods, several approaches to validating individual HGT inferences and benchmarking methods have been adopted, typically relying on various forms of [[Computer simulation|simulation]]. Because the truth is known in simulation, the number of false positives and the number of false negatives are straightforward to compute. However, simulating data do not trivially resolve the problem because the true extent of HGT in nature remains largely unknown, and specifying rates of HGT in the simulated model is always hasardous. Nonetheless, studies involving the comparison of several phylogenetic methods in a simulation framework could provide quantitative assessment of their respective performances, and thus help the biologist in choosing objectively proper tools.&lt;ref name="Abby2010" /&gt;

Standard tools to simulate sequence evolution along trees such as INDELible&lt;ref name="Fletcher2009" /&gt; or PhyloSim&lt;ref name="Sipos2011" /&gt; can be adapted to simulate HGT. HGT events cause the relevant gene trees to conflict with the species tree. Such HGT events can be simulated through subtree pruning and regrafting rearrangements of the species tree.&lt;ref name="Beiko2006" /&gt; However, it is important to simulate data that are realistic enough to be representative of the challenge provided by real datasets, and simulation under complex models are thus preferable. A model was developed to simulate gene trees with heterogeneous substitution processes in addition to the occurrence of transfer, and accounting for the fact that transfer can come from now [[Extinction|extinct]] donor lineages.&lt;ref name="Galtier2007" /&gt; Alternatively, the genome evolution simulator ALF&lt;ref name="Dalquen2012" /&gt; directly generates gene families subject to HGT, by accounting for a whole range of evolutionary forces at the base level, but in the context of a complete genome. Given simulated sequences which have HGT, analysis of those sequences using the methods of interest and comparison of their results with the known truth permits study of their performance. Similarly, testing the methods on sequence known not to have HGT enables the study of false positive rates.

Simulation of HGT events can also be performed by manipulating the biological sequences themselves. Artificial [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric genomes]] can be obtained by inserting known foreign genes into random positions of a host genome.&lt;ref name="Becq2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortez2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsirigos2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Azad2005" /&gt; The donor sequences are inserted into the host unchanged or can be further evolved by simulation,&lt;ref name="Dessimoz2008" /&gt; e.g., using the tools described above.

One important caveat to simulation as a way to assess different methods is that simulation is based on strong simplifying assumptions which may favour particular methods.&lt;ref name="Iantorno2014" /&gt;

The '''Kanzelhoehe Solar Observatory''' or KSO is an [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[observatory]] affiliated with the Institute of Geophysics, Astrophysics and Meteorology out of the [[University of Graz]]. It is located near [[Villach]] on the southern border of [[Austria]].

Its Web page at http://www.kso.ac.at/ usually posts current images of the sun, especially in the hydrogen-alpha line that is the strongest visible-light line of hydrogen and that reveals the solar chromosphere.

==History==
Founded in 1941 by the German [[Luftwaffe]] to research the effects of the Sun on the Earth's [[ionosphere]], the KSO focuses on multispectral synoptic observations of the sun using several telescope on the same mount.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="136054">{{hatnote|This is a mostly complete list of the works of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, according to the sixth edition of the Köchel catalogue. For a selective list of his works, grouped by genre, see [[List of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].}}

The '''Köchel catalogue''' ({{lang-de|Köchel-Verzeichnis}}) is a [[Chronology|chronological]] catalogue of compositions by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], originally created by [[Ludwig Ritter von Köchel|Ludwig von Köchel]], in which the entries are abbreviated ''K.'' and ''KV''. The numbers of the Köchel catalogue reflect the continuing establishment of a complete chronology of Mozart's works, and provide a shorthand reference to the compositions.

According to Köchel's counting, ''[[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem in D minor]]'' is the 626th piece Mozart composed, thus is designated either ''K.&amp;nbsp;626'' or ''KV&amp;nbsp;626''; however, his original catalogue (1862) of Mozart has been twice revised, and some works have had three KV. numbers, e.g. Mozart's [[Horn Concerto No. 1 (Mozart)|Horn Concerto No. 1, K.&amp;nbsp;(412+514)/386b]].

==History==
In the decades after Mozart's death there were several attempts to catalogue his compositions, for example by [[Franz Gleißner]] and [[Johann Anton André]] (published in 1833), but it was not until 1862 that Ludwig von Köchel succeeded in producing a comprehensive listing. Köchel's 551-page catalogue was titled ''Chronologisch-thematisches Verzeichnis sämm&lt;!-- not a typo --&gt;tlicher Tonwerke W. A. Mozarts'' (''Chronological-thematic Catalogue of the Complete Musical Works of W. A. Mozart'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[Breitkopf &amp; Härtel]] |last=Köchel |first=Ludwig Ritter von |authorlink=Ludwig Ritter von Köchel |title=Chronologisch-thematisches Verzeichniss sämmtlicher Tonwerke Wolfgang Amade Mozart's |location=Leipzig |year=1862 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kV4VAAAAYAAJ |oclc=3309798 |archiveurl=https://archive.org/details/chronologischth01kcgoog |archivedate=12 February 2008 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Köchel attempted to arrange the works in chronological order, but many compositions written before 1784 could only be estimated, although [[Leopold Mozart]] had compiled a partial list of his son's earlier works; Mozart's catalogue of his own compositions (begun in February 1784 with [[K. 449]]) allows relatively precise dating of many of his later works.  The catalogue included the opening bars of each piece, known as an [[incipit]]. Köchel divided the corpus into a main chronology of 626 works, and five appendices (''{{linktext|Anhang}}'' in German, abbreviated to ''Anh.'') The appendices (Anh. I-V) included:
*I – Lost authentic works
*II – Fragments by Mozart
*III – Works by Mozart transcribed by others
*IV – Doubtful works
*V – Misattributed works

Since Köchel published his original catalogue in 1863 (now referred to as K{{sup|1}}), the dating of Mozart's compositions has been subject to constant revision. Many more pieces have since been found, re-dated, re-attributed and re-numbered, requiring three revised editions of the catalogue. Subsequent editions – especially the third edition (K{{sup|3}}) by [[Alfred Einstein]] (1937), and the sixth edition (K{{sup|6}}) by [[Franz Giegling]], [[:de:Gerd Sievers|Gerd Sievers]], and [[Alexander Weinmann]] (1964) – have reflected attempts to arrange the growing list of works in a more accurate chronological order, according to various levels of scholarship.

A major shortcoming of K{{sup|1}} was that there was no room to expand the strictly sequential numbering in the main catalogue to allow for any new discoveries or further reassessment of existing works. For the 1937 edition (K{{sup|3}}) Einstein (following the analyses of [[Téodor de Wyzewa|Théodore de Wyzewa]] and Georges de St. Foix) reassigned a number of works from the original K{{sup|1}} appendices into the main catalogue by interpolating new numbers into the main sequence with a lower-case letter suffix. In K{{sup|6}} some of these were reassessed in the light of scholarship since 1937 and returned to the re-worked appendices:
* K. 626a
** K. 626a I – 64 cadenzas by Mozart to his own keyboard concertos
** K. 626a II – Cadenzas by Mozart to keyboard concertos by other composers
* K. 626b – 42 sketches &amp; other fragments by Mozart (replacing K{{sup|3}} Anh. II)
* Anh. A – Copies by Mozart of other composers' works 
* Anh. B – Works by Mozart transcribed by others
* Anh. C – Doubtful and misattributed vocal (C.1–10) and instrumental (C.11-30) works

For example, the Divertimento for Wind Octet in E♭ was numbered Anh.&amp;nbsp;226 in K{{sup|1}}; Einstein placed it in the K{{sup|3}} main catalogue as K.&amp;nbsp;196e, between K.&amp;nbsp;196 and K.&amp;nbsp;197; K{{sup|6}} reassigned it again to the 'doubtful' appendix C as Anh. C 17.01. Some works in Anh. A have been identified since 1965 as by Leopold Mozart. Many works in Anh. C have since been more reliably assigned to other composers, or to Mozart himself.

==List of existing Mozart compositions==
To maintain as much of the original K-numbering of the list as possible, while re-ordering in the revised, chronological sequence, letters were added to the new numbers. The following list shows Köchel's original designation (K{{sup|1}}) and the sixth edition (K{{sup|6}}). Other addenda and supplements to the catalogue are marked ''{{linktext|Anhang}}.'' (This has been abbreviated to 'Anh.' in the list below.)  Works listed as composed for piano were most likely performed on harpsichord or piano (more properly, forte-piano), as the harpsichord was still current in Mozart's day.

==Recordings==
Recordings of the complete works of Mozart have been issued three times: on the occasion of the bicentenary of Mozart's death in 1991, [[Philips Classics Records]] released a 180-CD collection in 45 box sets and each CD in a jewel case, ''[[The Complete Mozart Edition]]'', between 1990 and 1991. A selection of 25 CDs from this set, ''The Best of the Complete Mozart Edition'', was published in 1995. The full selection was then released again in 17 box sets as ''The Compact Complete Mozart Edition'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccaclassics.com/au/cat/4646602 ''Complete Mozart Edition'', Philips]&lt;/ref&gt; The Philips collection was made with recordings from world-renowned artists and is of high audio quality. On the occasion of Mozart's 250th birthday in 2006, [[Brilliant Classics]] released a single box with 170 CDs, plus one with liner notes to all works and the libretti to vocal works, ''Mozart Complete Edition''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brilliantclassics.com/articles/m/mozart-complete-edition/ ''Mozart Complete Edition''], Brilliant Classics&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, for the 225th anniversary of Mozart's death, [[Decca Classics]] and [[Deutsche Grammophon]] in partnership with the [[International Mozarteum Foundation]] released a box of 200 CDs with 2 hardback books with a new Mozart biography by [[Cliff Eisen]] and a newly developed short Köchel guide. ''Mozart 225: The New Complete Edition'' contains premiere performances of previously lost compositions and never recorded fragments, as well as key works in alternative versions and recordings of legendary historic performances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mozart225.com/ ''Mozart 225: The New Complete Edition''], home page&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18608">This is a list of [[books]] released for the [[UK World Book Day]]. In 1998 and 1999 a specially created WBD anthology priced at [[Pound sterling|£]]1 ([[Euro|€]]1.50 in [[Ireland]]) was published. In 2000, instead of a single £1 special anthology, four separate £1 books were published, covering a wider age-range. Since then, each year has seen a new set of special £1 books published.

From 2009 to 2011 flip books were published containing stories by two different [[author]]s one starting at each end of the book. 2012 saw the return of single story books and the first [[E-book]]s published simultaneously.&lt;ref name="revert-single-books"&gt;"[http://www.thebookseller.com/news/world-book-day-titles-revert-single-books.html World Book Day titles to revert to single books | The Bookseller]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Important dates in the history of art conservation==
Some key dates in the history of conservation in Europe and the United States include:
*1565, Restoration of the [[Sistine Chapel]] frescoes began [53 years after the ceilings were painted].
*1726, First attempt was made to restore Leonardo da Vinci's [[Last Supper]] by Michelangelo Bellotti.
*1729, First recorded transfer had been carried out by Domenico Michelini in Venice for a Titian painting (Ulisse Forni, Manuale del pittore restauratore, 1866, p.&amp;nbsp;106). The profession of restoration becomes more visible in the following years.  In the 18th century, painting restoration became a separate profession in France.
*1735 to 1820, Restoration of paintings in the Spanish royal collections following a 1734 fire.  Hundreds of important paintings were methodically treated in a specially constructed studio; materials used have been documented by Zahira Véliz.  (Zahira Véliz "The Restoration of Paintings in the Spanish Royal Collections, 1734-1820," Studies in the History of Painting Restoration, ed. Christine Sitwell and Sarah Staniforth, Archetype Publications, 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–62.)
*1777, 1785, Pietro Edwards, Director of the Restoration of the Public Pictures of Venice and the Rialto, published on basic concepts of preventive conservation, original vices of painters’ materials, respect for the artist’s original intent, and reversibility.
*1794, Charles Willson Peale recorded in his memo book using wax to impregnate paintings.  By the middle of the 19th century, paintings were being wax lined; Rembrandt’s Night Watch was wax-lined in 1851. [Note precedent above with glue; first there was impregnation with an adhesive and some years later, lining.  Analogous to the 20th-century use of PVA/EVA etc.]
*1809, Count Chaptal of Napoleon’s court filed a report regarding pigments used in Pompeii. [Technical analysis of artists’ materials appears and increases in the 19th century.]
*1815, Pigment studies by Sir Humphry Davy (he had a small portable chemical laboratory and 	traveled around Europe, accompanied by Michael Faraday 1813-1815)
*1850, First U.S. Art Restoration Company was formed in New York City – Oliver Brothers Smitsonian Institution, James Oliver account books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/james-oliver-account-books-6971|title=Summary of the James Oliver account books, 1865-1890 - Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|author=Archives of American Art|work=si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*1851, Rembrandt’s ''[[Night Watch (painting)|Night Watch]]'' is relined with a wax adhesive.
*1852, The cleaning by John Seguier of nine major pictures in the National Gallery, London led to a fierce public outcry and demand for an inquiry.  Cleaning controversies followed in London, Paris, Munich, (in the US by 1978, and about the Sistine 	Chapel by 1985).  (Cleaning controversies had also erupted re. policies at the Louvre in 1793.)
*1850-1853, Michael Faraday carried out analytical and deterioration studies for the National Gallery, London, investigated varnishes, cleaning methods and the impact of London fog, coal smoke, and 	gas lighting on the discoloration of surface coatings.  His findings were generally ignored.
*1860s, [[Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration|Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration and Conservation]] has expanded and opened a location in Boston. 	
*1863, Max Pettenkofer of Munich patented a method to “reverse the aging of varnish” through exposure to ethanol vapors; this method was later found to increase the interactive zone between paintings and varnish, complicating future cleanings [Ref. Sibylle Schmitt, IIC 1990].
*1870s, Louis Pasteur carried out analytical studies of paint and optical crystallography for over a decade.
*1888, [[Friedrich Rathgen]] became chemist in charge of the Royal Museums of Berlin (Staatliche Museen), first museum laboratory
*1896, [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] discovered x-rays in 1895 and x-rayed a painting the next year.  He called them  “X-rays”, using the mathematical designation for something unknown.
*1920, [[British Museum]] Research Laboratory established under the direction of Alexander Scott as a direct response to the poor state of the museum’s collections.
*1920s, George T. Oliver of Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration, Boston&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oliverbrothersonline.com|title=Art Restoration and Conservation - Oliver Brothers|work=Oliver Brothers Fine Art Restoration}}&lt;/ref&gt; has invented world’s first vacuum table for re-lining paintings.

*1928, Questionnaire initiated by the German museum council in 1928 on how much to clean, how much to inpaint [Berlin was a leading international art center at this time].  German activities at an international level ended when the National Socialists assumed power in 1933; art experts who emigrated (e.g. Max J. Friedländer, Ernst Gombrich, [[Julius S. Held]], Johannes Hell, Helmut Ruhemann, William Suhr, etc.) influenced attitudes in U.K. and U.S.

'''Measurement of sea ice''' is important for safety of [[navigation]] and for monitoring the [[Natural environment|environment]], particularly the [[climate]]. Sea ice extent interacts with large climate patterns such as the [[North Atlantic oscillation]] and [[Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation]], to name just two, and influences climate in the rest of the globe.

The amount of [[sea ice]] coverage in the arctic has been of interest for centuries, as the [[Northwest Passage]] was of high interest for trade and seafaring. There is a longstanding history of records and measurements of some effects of the sea ice extent, but comprehensive measurements were sparse till the 1950s and started with the [[satellite]] era in the late 1970s. Modern direct records include data about ice extent, ice area, concentration, thickness, and the age of the ice.  The current trends in the records show a significant decline in [[Northern hemisphere]] sea ice and a small but statistically significant increase in the ''winter'' [[Southern hemisphere]] sea ice.

Furthermore, current research comprises and establishes extensive sets of multi-century historical records of arctic and subarctic sea ice and uses, among others high-resolution paleo-proxy sea-ice records.&lt;ref name=colo&gt;[http://instaar.colorado.edu/meetings/AW2012/abstract_details.php?abstract_id=45 Signal of Persistent Multidecadal Variability in Wintertime Sea-Ice Records: Linkages to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, Miles, Martin et al., 42nd Annual International Arctic Workshop  will be held 7-9 March 2012 in Winter Park, Colorado]
&lt;/ref&gt; The arctic sea ice is a dynamic climate-system component and is linked to the Atlantic multidecadal variability and the historical climate over various decades. There are circular changes of sea ice patterns but so far no clear patterns based on modeling predictions.

== Methods of measuring sea ice ==

===Early observations===

Records assembled by [[Vikings]] showing the number of weeks per year that ice occurred along the north coast of [[Iceland]] date back to A.D. 870, but a more complete record exists since 1600. More extensive written records of Arctic sea ice date back to the mid-18th century. The earliest of those records relate to Northern Hemisphere shipping lanes, but records from that period are sparse. Air temperature records dating back to the 1880s can serve as a stand-in (proxy) for Arctic sea ice, but such temperature records were initially collected at only 11 locations. [[Russia|Russia’s]] Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute has compiled ice charts dating back to 1933. Today, scientists studying Arctic sea ice trends can rely on a fairly comprehensive record dating back to 1953, using a combination of satellite records, shipping records, and ice charts from several countries.&lt;ref name="NASA - Monitoring Sea Ice"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/SeaIce/page2.php|title=NASA Earth Observatory - Monitoring Sea Ice|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Antarctic, direct data prior to the satellite record are even more sparse. To try to extend the historical record of Southern Hemisphere sea ice extent further back in time, scientists have been investigating various proxies for sea ice extent. One is records kept by Antarctic [[whaler]]s that document the location of all whales caught and relate to sea ice observations directly. There seems to be an abrupt mid-twentieth-century decline in Antarctic sea-ice extent from whaling records, the direct global estimates of the Antarctic sea-ice cover from satellite observations, since the 1970 provide no clear trends.&lt;ref name= Mare /&gt; Because whales tend to congregate near the sea ice edge to feed, their locations could be a proxy for the ice extent. Other proxies use the presence of [[phytoplankton|phytoplankton-derived]] organic compounds and other extremophiles traces &lt;ref&gt;Science 25 January 2002: Vol. 295  no. 5555  pp. 641-644 DOI: 10.1126/science.1063391 Antarctic Sea Ice--a Habitat for Extremophiles D. N. Thomas, G. S. Dieckmann&lt;/ref&gt; in Antarctic [[ice core]]s and sediments. Since phytoplankton grow most abundantly along the edges of the ice pack, the concentration of this [[sulfur|sulfur-containing]] organic compounds and their geochemistry provide indicators of how far the ice edge extended from the continent. There are further extensive sets of multicentury historical records of arctic and subarctic sea ice and uses, among others high-resolution paleo proxy sea-ice records.&lt;ref name=colo /&gt;

===Satellites===

[[File:DMSP Block-5D2.jpg|thumb|[[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program|DMSP satellite]]]]
Useful satellite data concerning sea ice began in December 1972 with the [[Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer]] (ESMR) instrument. However, this was not directly comparable with the later SMMR/SSMI, and so the practical record begins in late 1978 with the launch of NASA’s [[Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer]] (SMMR) satellite.,&lt;ref name="NSIDC faq"/&gt; and continues with the [[Special Sensor Microwave/Imager]] (SSMI). [[AMSR|Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer]] (AMSR) and [[Cryosat-2]].

Since 1979, satellites have provided a consistent continuous record of sea ice.&lt;ref name = "NASA - Conclusions"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/SeaIce/page5.php | publisher =  NASA | title = Sea Ice - Conclusions }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Satellite images of sea ice are made from observations of [[microwave]] energy radiated from the Earth’s surface. Because ocean water emits microwaves differently from sea ice, ice "looks" different from water to the satellite sensor—see [[sea ice emissivity modelling]]. The observations are processed into digital picture elements, or pixels. Each pixel represents a square surface area on Earth. The first instruments provided approximately 25 kilometers by 25 kilometers resolution; later instruments higher. Algorithms examine the microwave emissions, and their vertical and horizontal polarisations, and estimate the ice area.&lt;ref name= "NASA - Monitoring Sea Ice"/&gt;

Sea ice may be considered in terms of total volume, or in terms of areal coverage. Volume is harder, because it requires a knowledge of the ice thickness, which is hard to measure directly; efforts such as PIOMAS &lt;ref&gt;http://psc.apl.washington.edu/wordpress/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/&lt;/ref&gt; use a combination of observations and modelling to estimate total volume.

There are two ways to express the total polar ice cover: ice area and ice extent. To estimate ice area, scientists calculate the percentage of sea ice in each pixel, multiply by the pixel area, and total the amounts. To estimate ice extent, scientists set a threshold percentage, and count every pixel meeting or exceeding that threshold as "ice-covered." The common threshold is 15 percent.&lt;ref name= "NASA - Monitoring Sea Ice"/&gt;

The threshold–based approach may seem less accurate, but it has the advantage of being more consistent. When scientists are analyzing satellite data, it is easier to say whether there is or isn’t at least 15 percent ice cover in a pixel than it is to say, for example, whether the ice cover is 70 percent or 75 percent. By reducing the uncertainty in the amount of ice, scientists can be more certain that changes in sea ice cover over time are real.&lt;ref name= "NASA - Monitoring Sea Ice"/&gt;

A careful analysis of satellite [[Radar altimeter|radar altimetry]] echoes can distinguish between those backscattered from the open ocean, new ice or multi-year ice.  The difference between the elevation of the echoes from snow/sea ice and open water gives the elevation of the ice above the ocean; the ice thickness can be computed from this.&lt;ref name= "Radar Altimetry Tutorial"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.altimetry.info/html/appli/ice/sea_ice_en.html | title = Radar Altimetry Tutorial | publisher = J. Benveniste and N. Picot Ed}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique has a limited vertical resolution - perhaps 0.5m - and is easily confused by the presence of even small amounts of open water. Hence it has mostly been used in the Arctic, where the ice is thicker and more continuous.

===Submarines===
Starting in 1958 [[Submarines in the United States Navy|U. S. Navy submarines]] collected upward-looking [[sonar]] profiles, for navigation and defense, and converted the information into estimates of ice thickness.&lt;ref name = "NASA - Satellites and Submarines"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/seaice_skinny.html | title = Satellites and Submarines Give the Skinny on Sea Ice Thickness | publisher = NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from U. S. and [[Royal Navy Submarine Service|Royal Navy submarines]] available from the [[NSIDC]] includes maps showing submarine tracks. Data are provided as ice draft profiles and as statistics derived from the profile data. Statistics files include information concerning ice draft characteristics, keels, level ice, leads, undeformed and deformed ice.&lt;ref name = "NSIDC Submarine Data"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://nsidc.org/data/g01360.html | title = Submarine Upward Looking Sonar Ice Draft Profile Data and Statistics | publisher = NSIDC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buoys===
Buoys are placed on the ice to measure ice properties and weather conditions by the participants of the [[International Arctic Buoy Program]] and its sister, the [[International Programme for Antarctic Buoys]].  Buoys can have sensors to measure [[air temperature]], [[atmospheric pressure]], buoy position ice growth/melt, ice temperature, [[ocean currents]], sea ice motion, sea level pressure, sea surface temperature, skin temperature, surface air temperature, surface winds, and water temperature.&lt;ref name= "NSIDC - IPAB Antarctic Drifting Buoy Data"&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://nsidc.org/data/nsidc-0084.html | title = NSIDC - IPAB Antarctic Drifting Buoy Data | publisher = NSIDC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "IPAB - International Programme for Antarctic Buoys"&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://iabp.apl.washington.edu/ | title = IPAB - International Programme for Antarctic Buoys |publisher = IPAB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "IAPB - International Arctic Buoy Programme"&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://iabp.apl.washington.edu/ | title = IAPB - International Arctic Buoy Programme |publisher = IAPB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upward looking sonar===
{{main|Upward looking sonar}}

Upward looking sonar (ULS) devices can be deployed under polar ice over a period of months or even years, and can provide a complete profile of ice thickness for a single site.

===Auxiliary observations===
Auxiliary observations of sea ice are made from shore stations, [[ships]], and from [[aircraft]].

Although  in  recent  years  remotely  sensed  data  has  come  to  play  a major  role  in  sea  ice  analysis,  it  is  not  yet  possible  to  compile  a complete  and  accurate  picture  of  sea  ice  conditions  from  this  data source  alone.  Auxiliary  sea  ice  observations  play  a  major  role  in confirming  remotely  sensed  ice  information  or  providing  important corrections  to  the  overall  picture  of  ice  conditions.&lt;ref name = "USN Handbook"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/forecaster_handbooks/SeaIce/Handbook%20for%20Sea%20Ice%20Analysis%20and%20Forecasting.07.pdf | title = Handbook for Sea Ice Analysis and Forecasting | publisher = U. S. Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  most  important  auxiliary  sea  ice  observation  is  the  location  of the  ice  edge.  Its  value  reflects  both  the  importance  of  the  ice  edge location  in  general  and  the  difficulty  of  accurately  locating  the  ice edge  with  remotely  sensed  data.  It  is  also  useful  to  provide  a  description of  the  ice  edge  in  terms  of  indications  of  freezing  or  thawing,  wind-driven  advance  or  retreat,  and  compactness  or  diffuseness.  Other important  auxiliary  information  includes  the  location  of  the [[icebergs]],  floebergs,  ice  islands,  old  ice,  ridging  and  hummocking. These  ice  features  are  poorly  monitored  by  remote  sensing  techniques  but are  very  important  aspects  of  the  ice  cover.&lt;ref name="USN Handbook"/&gt;

== Types of measurements ==

===Sea ice extent===
[[Image:ArcticSeaIceExtents.jpg|thumb|Sea Ice in the Arctic Ocean fluctuates with the seasons.]] 
Sea ice extent is the area of sea with a specified amount of ice, usually 15%.  To satellite microwave sensors, surface melt appears to be open water rather than water on top of sea ice. So, while reliable for measuring area most of the year, the microwave sensors are prone to underestimating the actual ice concentration and area when the surface is melting.&lt;ref name="MeierStroeve2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Meier|first1=Walter N.|last2=Stroeve|first2=Julienne|last3=Fetterer|first3=Florence|title=Whither Arctic sea ice? A clear signal of decline regionally, seasonally and extending beyond the satellite record|journal=Annals of Glaciology|volume=46|issue=1|year=2007|pages=428–434|issn=0260-3055 |url=http://www.igsoc.org/annals/46/a46a251.pdf |format=PDF|doi=10.3189/172756407782871170|bibcode=2007AnGla..46..428M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea ice area===
To estimate ice area, scientists calculate the percentage of sea ice in each pixel, multiply by the pixel area, and total the amounts. To estimate ice extent, scientists set a threshold percentage, and count every pixel meeting or exceeding that threshold as "ice-covered." The [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]], one of NASA’s Distributed Active Archive Centers, monitors sea ice extent using a threshold of 15 percent.&lt;ref name= "NASA - Monitoring Sea Ice"/&gt;

===Sea ice concentration===
{{main|Sea ice concentration}}
Sea ice concentration is the percentage of an area that is covered with sea ice.&lt;ref name= "NASA - Monitoring Sea Ice"/&gt;

===Sea ice thickness===
{{main|Sea ice thickness}}
Sea ice thickness increases over time, and increases when winds and currents push the ice together.  The European Space Agency's [[Cryosat-2]] satellite was launched in April 2010 on a quest to map the thickness and shape of the Earth's polar ice cover.  Its single instrument - a SAR/Interferometric Radar Altimeter is able to measure the [[sea ice freeboard]].

===Sea ice age===
The age of the ice is another key descriptor of the state of the sea ice cover, since older ice tends to be thicker and more resilient than younger ice.  Sea ice rejects salt over time and becomes [[freezing point depression|less salty resulting in a higher melting point]].&lt;ref name="NSIDC faq"&gt;[http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/faq.html#area_extent   NSIDC -Frequently Asked Questions about Arctic sea ice]&lt;/ref&gt; A simple two-stage approach classifies sea ice into first year and multiyear ice. First-year is ice that has not yet survived a summer melt season, while multi-year ice has survived at least one summer and can be several years old.&lt;ref name = "SEARCH - Study of Enviromental Artic Change"&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://www.arctic.noaa.gov/reportcard/seaice.html | title = Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Outlook 2009: Summary Report |publisher = SEARCH}}&lt;/ref&gt;
See [[sea ice growth processes]].

===Sea ice mass balance===
[[Image:Measuring Sea Ice Mass Balance.jpg|thumb|Measuring Sea Ice Mass Balance]]
Sea ice mass balance is the balance of how much the ice grows in the winter and melts in the summer. For Arctic sea ice virtually all of the growth occurs on the bottom of the ice. Melting occurs on both the top and the bottom of the ice. In the vast majority of cases all of the snow melts during the summer, typically in just a couple of weeks. The mass balance is a powerful concept since it is the great integrator of the heat budget. If there is a net increase of heat, then the ice will thin. A net cooling will result in thicker ice.&lt;ref name = "USACE - Sea Ice Mass Balance"&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://imb.crrel.usace.army.mil/massisit.htm | title = Mass Balance, what is it? |publisher = Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Making direct measurements of the mass balance is simple. An array of stakes and thickness gauges is used to measure ablation and accumulation of ice and snow at the top and bottom of the ice cover. In spite of the importance of mass balance measurements and the relatively simple equipment involved in making them, there are few observational results. This is due, in large part, to the expense involved in operating a long-term field camp to serve as the base for these studies.&lt;ref name = "USACE - Sea Ice Mass Balance" /&gt;

===Sea ice volume===
[[Image:Plot arctic sea ice volume.svg|thumb|right|Blue: Seasonal variation and long term decrease of Arctic sea ice volume as determined by measurement backed numerical modelling.

{{cite web |url=http://psc.apl.washington.edu/ArcticSeaiceVolume/IceVolume.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711152422/http://psc.apl.washington.edu/ArcticSeaiceVolume/IceVolume.php |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seymour W. Laxon et al., CryoSat-2 estimates of Arctic sea ice thickness and volume, Geophys. Res. Lett. , DOI: 10.1002/grl.50193, 28 FEB 2013&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There are no Arctic-wide or Antarctic-wide measurements of the volume of sea ice, but the volume of the Arctic sea ice is calculated using the [[Pan-Arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System]] (PIOMAS) developed at the University of Washington Applied Physics Laboratory/Polar Science Center.  PIOMAS blends satellite-observed sea ice concentrations into model calculations to estimate sea ice thickness and volume. Comparison with submarine, mooring, and satellite observations help increase the confidence of the model results.&lt;ref name= "NSIDC - June 8, 2010 "&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/| title = National Snow and Ice Data Center - Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis | publisher = NSIDC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[ICESat]] was a laser altimeter equipped satellite, which could measure the freeboard of ice flows.&lt;ref&gt;B.E.Schutz et al., "Overview Of The IceSat Mission", GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS, VOL. 32, L21S01, doi:10.1029/2005GL024009, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/icesat-20090707.html | title = Images: New NASA Satellite Survey Reveals Dramatic Arctic Sea Ice Thinning | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its active service period was from February 2003 to October 2009. Together with a set of auxiliary data like ice density, snow cover thickness, air pressure, water salinity one can calculate the flow thickness and thus its volume. Its data have been compared with the respective PIOMAS data and a reasonably agreement has been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://psc.apl.washington.edu/wordpress/research/projects/arctic-sea-ice-volume-anomaly/validation/ | title = PIOMAS Ice Volume Validation and Uncertainty | publisher = Polar Science Center, University of Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cryosat-2]], launched in April 2010, has the ability to measure the freeboard of ice flows, just like [[ICESat]], only that it uses radar instead of laser pulses. Data is calculated with the PIOMAS model.

== Trends in the data ==
Reliable and consistent records for all seasons are only available during the satellite era, from 1979 onwards.

===Northern hemisphere===
{{see also|Arctic sea ice decline}}
[[File:Seaice-1870-part-2009.png|thumb|right|1870-2000 Northern hemisphere [[Measurement of sea ice#Sea ice extent|sea ice extent]] in million square kilometers. Blue shading indicates the pre-satellite era; data then is less reliable. In particular, the near-constant level extent in Autumn up to 1940 reflects lack of data rather than a real lack of variation.]]
According to scientific measurements, both the thickness and extent of summer sea ice in the Arctic have shown a dramatic decline over the past thirty years.&lt;ref name="MeierStroeve2007"/&gt;

===Southern hemisphere===

Records before the satellite era are sparse. William K. de la Mare, 1997, in ''Abrupt mid-twentieth-century decline in Antarctic sea-ice extent from whaling records''&lt;ref name= Mare &gt;{{cite journal |author=de la Mare WK |title=Abrupt mid-twentieth-century decline in Antarctic sea-ice extent from whaling records |journal=Nature |volume=389 |issue=6646 |pages=57–60 |date=September 1997 |doi=10.1038/37956 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v389/n6646/full/389057a0.html|bibcode=1997Natur.389...57D }}&lt;/ref&gt; found a southwards shift in ice edge based on whaling records; these findings have been questioned, but later papers by de la Mare and by Cotte support the same conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=de la Mare WK |title=Changes in Antarctic sea-ice extent from direct historical observations and whaling records |journal=Climate Change |volume=92 |issue=3–4 |pages=461–93 |date=February 2009 |doi=10.1007/s10584-008-9473-2 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/u4n73015638160q6/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author1 = Cotté, Cedric | author2 = Guinet, Christophe | title = Historical whaling records reveal major regional retreat of Antarctic sea ice | journal = Deep-Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers | date = January 2007 | doi=10.1016/j.dsr.2006.11.001 | volume=54 | pages=243–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The satellite-derived Antarctic sea ice trends show pronounced increase in the central Pacific sector  by ∼4–10% per decade and a decrease in the Bellingshausen/western Weddell sector with similar percentages but lower extent. There is a close connection to the Antarctic Oscillation of the further and impacts of positive polarities of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) for the latter. The magnitude of the ice changes associated with the AAO and ENSO are smaller than the regional ice trends and local (or less understood large) scale processes still need to be investigated for a complete explanations.&lt;ref name=cur&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = J. | last2 = Curry | first2 = J.

===Use of 1981 to 2010 as a baseline===
Scientists use the 1981 to 2010 average because it provides a consistent baseline for year-to-year comparisons of sea ice extent. Thirty years is considered a standard baseline period for weather and climate, and the satellite record is now long enough to provide a thirty-year baseline period.&lt;ref&gt;http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/faq/#1979average&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical fetishism''' refers to a number of [[sexual fetishism|sexual fetishes]] involving objects, practices, environments, and situations of a medical or clinical nature. In [[sexual roleplay]] a hospital or medical scene involves the [[sex partners]] assuming the roles of doctors, nurses, surgeons and patients to act out specific or general medical fetishes. Medical fantasy is a genre in [[pornography]], though the fantasy may not necessarily involve pornography or sexual activity.

Medical fetishism may involve sexual attraction to [[respiratory therapy]] involving oxygen via nasal cannula or any sort of masks, [[medical practitioner]]s, [[medical uniform]]s, [[hospital gowns]],  [[anaesthesia]], [[intimate examination]]s (such as [[rectal examination]], [[gynecology|gynecological examination]], [[urology|urological examination]], [[andrology|andrological examination]], [[thermometer#Medical thermometer|rectal temperature-taking]]), [[catheterization]], [[diaper]]ing, [[enema]]s, [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]s, insertion (such as [[suppository]] insertion, [[Menstrual cup|menstrual-cup]] insertion, and [[prostatic massage]]), [[medical device]]s (such as [[orthopedic cast]]s and [[Brace (orthopaedic)|orthopedic brace]]s; see also "[[Abasiophilia]]"), [[dentistry|dental]] objects (such as [[dental braces]], [[retainer (orthodontic device)|retainers]], and [[orthodontic headgear|headgear]]), [[medical restraint]]s, and [[medical gag]]s.

== Physical examination ==
[[File:Kink.com photo shoot.jpg|thumb|The film set for a medical fetishism scene]]
Some people eroticize about intimate examinations as part of a medical fetish, and as such are a common service offered by [[professional dominant]]s.

An intimate examination can form part of a scene in medical play where the nurse or doctor inflicts one or more embarrassing and humiliating quasi-medical procedures on the patient. Often frozen or heated objects are introduced to the patient's body to simulate the uncomfortable sensations that can occur during a real examination. Examinations may include an examination and intrusion of the anus, urethra, or vagina, as well as handling and twisting of the penis, testicles, clitoris, and nipples. Quite often, strap on play is also incorporated, as this can heighten the intimacy, and also the sensations of the patient. This may be a prelude to masturbation or administration of an enema. Before examination, the patient can be placed in [[Bondage (sexual)|physical restraints]] and [[gag (BDSM)|gag]]ged, and wear some form of embarrassing clothing.

== Temperature-taking fetish ==
'''Temperature taking fetish''' is a sexual fetish for [[Thermometer|oral thermometers and rectal thermometers]]. This may include the sexual attraction to the equipment, processes, environments or scenarios/situations. Sexual arousal from the desire to take another's temperature or have one's temperature taken is primarily what surrounds the fetish.  While rectal temperature taking is more prominent, there is also an interest in oral temperature taking.

== Anesthesia fetishism ==
'''Anesthesia fetishism''' is a sexual fetish for [[anesthesia]]. This may include the sexual attraction to the equipment, processes, substances, effects, environments or situations. Sexual arousal from the desire to administer anesthesia, or the sexual desire for oneself to be anesthetized are two forms in which an individual may exist as an arbiter of the fetish. Older-style anesthesia masks of black rubber, still in occasional use today, are one of the more common elements fetishized, and have earned the nickname ''Black Beauty'' by many fetishists.

=== Acts, behaviour and rituals ===
Anesthesia fetish is considered [[edgeplay]] when realised outside the boundaries of fantasy, and may result in various degrees of harm, or death. [[fantasy (psychology)|Fantasies]] are elaborated by the viewing of images and reading of stories of anesthetic inductions. [[Edgeplay]] may involve obtaining and [[Scene (BDSM)|scening]] with various anesthesia-related paraphernalia—usually anesthesia masks for [[breathplay]], the acquisition of anesthetics for anesthetizing others or being anesthetized oneself, and the occupation of a medical setting or environment for the same practice.

Some anesthesia fetishists who seek to be anesthetized may feign or induce medical conditions in an attempt to obtain general anesthesia from medical personnel. This is considered safer than playing with anesthetic agents outside of a medical setting, but may nevertheless be an abuse of all concerned.

=== Internet influence ===
The [[Internet]] has enabled people with this relatively rare [[paraphilia]] to discuss the subject and exchange anesthesia-related [[multimedia]].{{cn|date=December 2014}}

'''''Miguxês''''' ({{IPA-pt|miɡuˈʃes}} or {{IPA-pt|miɣuˈʃeʃ|}}), also known in [[Portugal]] as '''''pita talk''''' or '''''pita script''''' (&lt;small&gt;pronounced &lt;/small&gt;{{IPA-pt|ˈpitɐ|}}), is an [[Internet slang]] of the [[Portuguese language]], commonly used by mostly [[Brazil]]ian teenagers in [[Internet]] and other electronic media, such as messages written in [[cell phone]].

==Brief history==

Its name derives from ''miguxo'', a corruption from ''amiguxo'', turn a term used for ''amiguinho'', or "buddy" in Portuguese. This [[sociolect]] of Vernacular [[Brazilian Portuguese]] brings possible simplifications in the grammatical structures, since the vehicles in which ''miguxês'' is used are nearly universally colloquial, often space-delimited (such as [[SMS message]]s, [[instant messenger]]s or [[social network]]s). It also tends to have "simpler" orthography in comparison to standard Portuguese orthography, which leads to the most strong criticism to it (''miguxês'' without its common alternative spellings is associated with the just normal Internet and/or youth slang).

There are identitarian and orthographic differences between the so-called [[leet]]speak, ''miguxês'', ''tiopês'' and ''internetês'' — Brazilian Portuguese for [[netspeak]], which is by far the one that most closely resembles standard Portuguese —, all common sociolects found in the Portuguese-speaking digital network community, the three latter ones created in it.

Basically, the use of each category depends on the individual choice and the environment in which people are interacting. While in the Internet, in a general manner, there is a handful of a different phenomenon in which users communicate with abbreviations to simplify writing, ''miguxês'' carries with it an effective intention, that is, to express an infantile language in a conversation between friends, or even satirize this style of communication. In certain subcultures in Brazil, especially in the case of what is called '[[emo]]' there, ''miguxês'' is an item of group identification. So it would not be unusual for someone which opposes such subcultures to also develop a distaste for ''miguxês''. Brazilian '[[Emo#Backlash|anti-emo]]' groups usually satirize 'emo' teenagers with use of ''miguxês''.

Together with the cited urban tribes, they started to fell out of the mainstream in the early 2010s, so that they have much lower popularity with the following teen generation that did not see its spreading as a frequent Internet meme.

==Spelling==

Although orthography rules of ''miguxês'' may vary individually, and also in each region and in different [[urban tribe]]s since it is plain broken Portuguese, there are certain characteristics often commonly found as:

* Replacement of ''s'' and ''c'' for ''x'', simulating the [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of native Portuguese-speaking children's speech through their language acquisition: ''você'' (Second person singular), ''vocês'' (Second person plural) &gt; ''vuxeh'', ''vuxeix'';
* Omission or replacement of [[diacritics]], notably by replacing an acute accent over a vowel with the letter ''h'' after the vowel as in ''é'' ("is") &gt; ''eh'' (to distinguish it from the word ''e'' meaning "and") or ''será'' ("will be") &gt; ''serah''. Or replacing the [[tilde]] with ''n''/''m'' to indicate nasalization: ''não'' ("no") &gt; ''nawn''/''naum''
* Replacement of ''i'' by ''ee'', influenced by [[English language]] orthography: ''gatinha'' (female kitten, also a slang for pretty girl) &gt; ''gateenha'';
* Replacement of ''o'' and ''e'' by ''u'' and ''i'' respectively, specially in non-tonic syllables: ''quero'' (I want) &gt; ''keru''.
* Replacing the digraph ''qu'' and the letter ''c'' as ''k'' both for brevity and as a form of [[sensational spelling]], and deleting the ''u'' of these environments: ''quem'' (who), ''escreveu'' (wrote) &gt; ''kem'', ''ixkrevew''

==Tiopês==
[[2010s in fashion#Youth fashion|Brazilian indie and scene kids]] use a related Internet sociolect, the ''tiopês'' (from ''tiop'', which is a corruption of Portuguese ''tipo'', or equivalent to English "like, totally", in ''tiopês''), which mainly uses [[ingroup]] [[Internet meme|meme]]s as well purposeful ridiculous-sounding [[Spelling#Misspellings|misspellings]] to add humor or irony to the message and bring group identification, much like [[teh]] of English-derived leetspeak.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://youpix.com.br/memepedia/a-origem-do-tiopes/ The origin of "tiopês" – memepedia – youPIX, people + pixels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010130045/http://youpix.com.br/memepedia/a-origem-do-tiopes/ |date=2012-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As it is common for the ''miguxês'', there are detractors of ''tiopês'', although much less numbered and for different reasons (usually, people which are detractors at the same time of different youth subcultures deemed as alienated, including 'emo' teenagers, [[2000–2009 in fashion#Youth fashion|scene kids]] and [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|indie kids]]). ''Tiopês'' is also much less common in the Portuguese-speaking Internet community, and is said to be a phenomenon limited to Brazil.

===Example===
* Tiopês: amiogs, eo tiop a~mo a dercycolpëdya, rsrsrs1!!11! o artigo deels sorb noës indys eh tuod mas asi~m meninës nein toads os saitys de parödjas soa lezgaus tiop augums pormoven ~polëmicas~ conmo precomseiots e eu noa asho iso valiod un boa~m eggzenpel ~master no ingreis AEAEAEAE~ seriä a tau da emceeclopëdia dramatchyca q aepzar do noem noa shorem leëtros pro sel fin11!11!
* Rough colloquial Brazilian Portuguese translation of the ''tiopês'' piece: Gente, eu absolutamente adoro a Desciclopédia, hahahaha, o artigo deles sobre nós indies é tudo, mas tenho algo a dizer a vocês, nem todos os ''sites'' de paródia são legais, alguns deles promovem coisas controversas como preconceitos, e eu não acho esse tipo de coisa válida, um bom exemplo seria uma certa Encyclopedia Dramatica que apesar do nome, não é de se sofrer um drama por seu fim.
* English, literal translation of the Portuguese piece: You guys, I [have to tell that I] absolutely love/adore [[Uncyclopedia]], hahahaha, their [Portuguese] article on us indie kids is awesome, but I have something to say [to you], not every parody site is cool, some of them promote controversial things such as [a number of] prejudices, and I am reticent of [all] this kind of thing, a good example would be a so-called [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] that in spite of its name, would not be worth of a drama because of its end.

The Neighbour-Sensing mathematical model of hyphal growth is a set of interactive computer models that simulate the way [[fungal|fungi]] hyphae grow in three-dimensional space. The three-dimensional simulation is an experimental tool which can be used to study the [[morphogenesis]] of fungal hyphal networks. 

The modelling process starts from the proposition that each [[hypha]] in the fungal [[mycelium]] generates a certain abstract field that (like known physical fields) decrease with increasing distance. Both scalar and vector fields are included in the models. The field(s) and its (their) gradient(s) are used to inform the algorithm that calculates the likelihood of branching, the angle of branching and the growth direction of each hyphal tip in the simulated mycelium. The growth vector is being informed of its surroundings so, effectively, the virtual hyphal tip is sensing the neighbouring mycelium. This is why we call it the Neighbour-Sensing model.

Cross-walls in living hyphae are formed only at right angles to the long axis of the hypha. A daughter hyphal apex can only arise if a branch is initiated. So, for the fungi, hyphal branch formation is the equivalent of cell division in animals, plants and protists. The position of origin of a branch, and its direction and rate of growth are the main formative events in the development of fungal tissues and organs. Consequently, by simulating the mathematics of the control of hyphal growth and branching the Neighbour-Sensing model provides the user with a way of experimenting with features that may regulate hyphal growth patterns during morphogenesis to arrive at suggestions that could be tested with live fungi.

The model was proposed by Audrius Meškauskas and David Moore in 2004 and developed using the [[supercomputing]] facilities of the [[University of Manchester]].
The key idea of this model is that all parts of the fungal mycelium have identical field generation systems, field sensing mechanisms and growth direction altering algorithms. Under properly chosen model parameters it is possible to observe the transformation of the initial unordered mycelium structure into various forms, some of them being very like natural fungal fruit bodies and other complex structures.

In one of the simplest examples, it is assumed that the hyphal tips try to keep a 45 degree orientation with relation to the Earth’s gravity vector field, and also generate some kind of scalar field that the growing tips try to avoid. This combination of parameters leads to development of hollow conical structures, similar to the fruit bodies of some primitive fungi.

[[Image:Neighbour Sensing model cords.jpg|thumb|250px|left|After changing the parameter set, the initially chaotic formation (in the center) starts forming cords]]

In another example, the hypha generates a vector field parallel to the hyphal axis, and the tips tend to turn parallel to that field. After more tips turn in the same direction, their hyphae form a stronger directional field. In this way, it is possible to observe spontaneous orientation of growing hypha in a single direction, which simulates the strands, cords and rhizomorphs produced by many species of fungi in nature.
The parameters under which the model operates can be changed during its execution. This allows a greater variety of structures to be formed (including mushroom - like shapes) and may be supposed to simulate cases where the growth strategy depends on an internal biological clock.
The Neighbour-Sensing model explains how various fungal structures may arise because of the ‘crowd behaviour’ of the community of hyphal tips that make up the mycelium.

'''Neural backpropagation''' is the phenomenon in which after the [[action potential]] of a [[neuron]] creates a voltage spike down the [[axon]] (normal propagation) another impulse is generated from the soma and propagates toward to the [[Apical dendrite|apical]] portions of the dendritic arbor or [[dendrites]], from which much of the original input current originated.  In addition to active backpropagation of the action potential, there is also passive [[electrotonic]] spread. While there is ample evidence to prove the existence of backpropagating action potentials, the function of such action potentials and the extent to which they invade the most distal dendrites remains highly controversial.

==Mechanism==
[[File:Mechanisms_of_Neural_Backpropagation.jpg|thumb|alt=Visual representation of two mechanisms of neural backpropagation.|Methods of neural backpropagation.  Left: action potential forms in axon and travels towards soma.  Right: Regular action potential generates an echo that backpropagates through the dendritic tree.]]
When the graded [[excitatory postsynaptic potentials]] (EPSPs) depolarize the soma to spike threshold at the [[axon hillock]], first, the axon experiences a propagating impulse through the electrical properties of its voltage-gated sodium and voltage-gated potassium channels.  An action potential occurs in the axon first as research illustrates that sodium channels at the dendrites exhibit a higher threshold than those on the membrane of the axon (Rapp et al., 1996).  Moreover, the voltage-gated sodium channels on the dendritic membranes having a higher threshold helps prevent them triggering an action potential from synaptic input.  Instead, only when the soma depolarizes enough from accumulating graded potentials and firing an axonal action potential will these channels be activated to propagate a signal traveling backwards (Rapp et al. 1996).  Generally, EPSPs from synaptic activation are not large enough to activate the dendritic voltage-gated calcium channels (usually on the order of a couple milliamperes each) so backpropagation is typically believed to happen only when the cell is activated to fire an action potential.  These sodium channels on the dendrites are abundant in certain types of neurons, especially mitral and pyramidal cells, and quickly inactivate.  Initially, it was thought that an action potential could only travel down the axon in one direction towards the axon terminal where it ultimately signaled the release of neurotransmitters.  However, recent research has provided evidence for the existence of backwards propagating action potentials (Staley 2004).

[[File:Dendritic ap spike.gif|thumb|This diagram displays how the dendritic voltage spike comes after the depolarization of the axon and soma.]]

To elaborate, neural backpropagation can occur in one of two ways.  First, during the initiation of an axonal action potential, the cell body, or soma, can become depolarized as well. This [[depolarization]] can spread through the cell body towards the dendritic tree where there are voltage-gated sodium channels. The depolarization of these voltage-gated sodium channels can then result in the propagation of a dendritic action potential.  Such backpropagation is sometimes referred to as an echo of the forward propagating action potential (Staley 2004).  It has also been shown that an action potential initiated in the axon can create a retrograde signal that travels in the opposite direction (Hausser 2000). This impulse travels up the axon eventually causing the cell body to become depolarized, thus triggering the dendritic voltage-gated calcium channels. As described in the first process, the triggering of dendritic voltage-gated calcium channels leads to the propagation of a dendritic action potential

It is important to note that the strength of backpropagating action potentials varies greatly between different neuronal types (Hausser 2000).  Some types of neuronal cells show little to no decrease in the amplitude of action potentials as they invade and travel through the dendritic tree while other neuronal cell types, such as cerebellar [[Purkinje neurons]], exhibit very little action potential backpropagation (Stuart 1997). Additionally, there are other neuronal cell types that manifest varying degrees of amplitude decrement during backpropagation.  It is thought that this is due to the fact that each neuronal cell type contains varying numbers of the voltage-gated channels required to propagate a dendritic action potential.

==Regulation and inhibition==
Generally, synaptic signals that are received by the dendrite are combined in the soma in order to generate an action potential that is then transmitted down the axon toward the next synaptic contact. Thus, the backpropagation of action potentials poses a threat to initiate an uncontrolled [[positive feedback]] loop between the soma and the dendrites.  For example, as an action potential was triggered, its dendritic echo could enter the dendrite and potentially trigger a second action potential.  If left unchecked, an endless cycle of action potentials triggered by their own echo would be created.  In order to prevent such a cycle, most neurons have a relatively high density of [[Voltage-gated potassium channel|A-type K+ channels]].

A-type K+ channels belong to the superfamily of [[voltage-gated ion channels]] and are transmembrane channels that help maintain the cell’s membrane potential (Cai 2007). Typically, they play a crucial role in returning the cell to its resting membrane following an action potential by allowing an inhibitory current of K+ ions to quickly flow out of the neuron.  The presence of these channels in such high density in the dendrites explains their inability to initiate an action potential, even during synaptic input.  Additionally, the presence of these channels provides a mechanism by which the neuron can suppress and regulate the backpropagation of action potentials through the dendrite (Vetter 2000).  Pharmacological antagonists of these channels promoted the frequency of backpropagating action potentials which demonstrates their importance in keeping the the cell from excessive firing (Waters et al., 2004).  Results have indicated a linear increase in the density of A-type channels with increasing distance into the dendrite away from the soma. The increase in the density of A-type channels results in a dampening of the backpropagating action potential as it travels into the dendrite.  Essentially, inhibition occurs because the A-type channels facilitate the outflow of K+ ions in order to maintain the membrane potential below threshold levels (Cai 2007).  Such inhibition limits EPSP and protects the neuron from entering a never-ending positive-positive feedback loop between the soma and the dendrites.

==History==
Since the 1950s, evidence has existed that [[neurons]] in the [[central nervous system]] generate an [[action potential]], or voltage spike, that travels both through the [[axon]] to signal the next neuron and backpropagates through the [[dendrites]] sending a retrograde signal to its presynaptic signaling neurons. This current decays significantly with travel length along the dendrites, so effects are predicted to be more significant for neurons whose synapses are near the postsynaptic cell body, with magnitude depending mainly on sodium-channel density in the dendrite. It is also dependent on the shape of the dendritic tree and, more importantly, on the rate of signal currents to the neuron. On average, a backpropagating spike loses about half its voltage after traveling nearly 500 micrometres.

Backpropagation occurs actively in the [[neocortex]], [[hippocampus]], [[substantia nigra]], and [[spinal cord]], while in the [[cerebellum]] it occurs relatively passively. This is consistent with observations that [[synaptic plasticity]] is much more apparent in areas like the hippocampus, which controls spatial memory, than the cerebellum, which controls more unconscious and vegetative functions.

The backpropagating current also causes a voltage change that increases the concentration of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the dendrites, an event which coincides with certain models of synaptic plasticity. This change also affects future integration of signals, leading to at least a short-term response difference between the presynaptic signals and the postsynaptic spike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Functions==
While many questions have yet to be answered in regards to neural backpropagation, there exists a number of hypotheses regarding its function. Some proposed function include involvement in synaptic plasticity, involvement in dendrodendritic inhibition, boosting synaptic responses, resetting membrane potential, retrograde actions at synapses and conditional axonal output.
Backpropagation is believed to help form LTP (long term potentiation) and Hebbian plasticity at hippocampal synapses. Since artificial LTP induction, using microelectrode stimulation, voltage clamp, etc. requires the postsynaptic cell to be slightly depolarized when EPSPs are elicited, backpropagation can serve as the means of depolarization of the postsynaptic cell. 

Backpropagating action potentials can induce Long-term potentiation by behaving as a signal that informs the presynaptic cell that the postsynaptic cell has fired. Moreover, [[Spike-timing-dependent plasticity|Spike-Time Dependent Plasticity]] is known as the narrow time frame for which coincidental firing of both the pre and post synaptic neurons will induce plasticity. Neural backpropagation occurs in this window to interact with [[NMDA receptor|NMDA receptors]] at the apical dendrites by assisting in the removal of voltage sensitive Mg2+ block (Waters et al., 2004). This process permits the large influx of calcium which provokes a cascade of events to cause potentiation.  

Current literature also suggests that backpropagating action potentialss are also responsible for the release of retrograde neurotransmitters and trophic factors which contribute to the short-term and long-term efficacy between two neurons. Since the backpropagating action potentials essentially exhibit a copy of the neurons axonal firing pattern, they help establish a synchrony between the pre and post synaptic neurons (Waters et al., 2004).   

Importantly, backpropagating action potentials are necessary for the release of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). BDNF is an essential component for inducing synaptic plasticity and development (Kuczewski N., Porcher C., Ferrand N., 2008). Moreover, backpropagating action potentials have been shown to induce BDNF-dependent phosphorylation of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) which is known to be a major component in synaptic plasticity and memory formation (Kuczewski N., Porcher C., Lessmann V., et al. 2008). 

==Algorithm==
While a backpropagating action potential can presumably cause changes in the weight of the presynaptic connections, there is no simple mechanism for an error signal to propagate through multiple layers of neurons, as in the computer [[backpropagation]] algorithm. However, simple linear topologies have shown that effective computation is possible through signal backpropagation in this biological sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bogacz |first=Rafal |authorlink=Rafal Bogacz |author2=Malcolm W.

The '''PAIRS Foundation''', Inc., develops [[experiential learning]] curricula and programs designed to reconcile married couples and prevent divorce. It is a not-for-profit 501(c)(3) corporation based in Broward County, Florida. The company was originally established in Virginia as PAIRS, Ltd. in 1983 and as The PAIRS Foundation, Inc. in Florida in 2000. In 2010, PAIRS, Ltd. formally merged into The PAIRS Foundation, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunbiz.org Florida Department of State]&lt;/ref&gt;

PAIRS Foundation owns copyright to marriage and relationship education programs that are taught by instructors worldwide who are trained, certified and licensed by the foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://consumer.pairs.com/directory.php PAIRS Instructors]&lt;/ref&gt; and to the trademark,  "skills for successful relationships".

==Mission==

PAIRS Foundation's mission is to "teach those attitudes, emotional understandings, and behaviors that nurture and sustain healthy relationships and to make this knowledge broadly available on behalf of a safer, saner, more loving world."&lt;ref&gt;[http://instructor.pairs.com/history.html PAIRS Mission]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The PAIRS 120-hour semester course was   developed in 1975 by marriage and family therapist Lori Heyman Gordon as a graduate program for counseling students at [[American University]] in Washington, D.C.; it was one of the first comprehensive educational programs in the United States that sought to reduce marriage and family breakdown through [[Relationship Education]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Lori Heyman. "Passage to Intimacy", Fireside Books, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  The course integrated and  work by  [[Virginia Satir]], [[Daniel Harold Casriel|Daniel Casriel]], [[Murray Bowen]], [[James Framo]], George Bach, Gordon and others.&lt;ref&gt;DeMaria, Rita. "Building Intimate Relationships", "The Saga of PAIRS." Routledge, December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Casriel_website"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Lori Heyman|title=From the road to happiness to a relationship roadmap for couples|url=http://danielcasriel.com/2017/08/22/from-the-road-to-happiness-to-a-relationship-roadmap-for-couples/|website=DanielCasriel.com|publisher=Purpose Built Families Foundation|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A 1982 [[Washington Post]] article featured PAIRS as a new alternative to traditional [[Family Therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2011/03/31/couples-can-this-marriage-be-saved-331 McNees, Pat. "Can This Marriage Be Saved," Washington Post, November 29, 1982.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1992 and 1997, Carlos Durana, Ph.D., conducted early studies on the impact of the program, many of which were published in industry journals. During that period, articles about the program appeared in ''Newsweek'', ''Time'', ''Cosmopolitan,''  '' Ladies Home Journal'' and ''Psychology Today'' Gordon was also featured in interviews on CNN, NBC's Today Show, Geraldo, The Gordon Elliot Show, and CBN.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon, Lori Heyman. "If You Really Loved Me", Science and Behavior, Palo Alto (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation began piloting intensive couples seminars, ranging from one to four days, in the late nineties. A December 1998 ''New Woman'' magazine cover story featured the first-person account of Molly and Chris Hanson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pairs.com/marriage_makeover.html Hanson, Molly. "PAIRS Marriage Makeover," New Woman Magazine, December 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, 2000, the foundation's CEO Seth Eisenberg was a guest on ABC's ''[[Politically Incorrect]] with Bill Maher'' to discuss Florida's Marriage Preparation and Preservation Act, mandating relationship skills training in high schools and for couples applying for marriage licenses. O .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=203828&amp;more=ucepisodelist&amp;episodeid=2480254  - TV Guide, Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Gordon was recognized with the Impact Award of the Coalition for Marriage, Family and Couples Education:&lt;ref&gt;[http://instructor.pairs.com/history.html PAIRS History]&lt;/ref&gt;

PAIRS was awarded a $5 million federal grant in 2006 by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]], [[Administration for Children and Families]], to provide classes and conduct a five-year evaluation of the program's impact among English, Spanish and French/Creole-speaking couples and singles in Florida's Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2010/04/14/marriages-families-jobs/ Falciglia, Amanda. "Study offers hope for marriages, families, and jobs," FatherhoodChannel.com, April 14, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, PAIRS was featured in a [[Time magazine]] cover story by Belinda Luscombe, "Who Needs Marriage?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2032116,00.html Luscombe, Belinda. "Who Needs Marriage," Time Magazine, November 18, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Another [[Time Magazine]] story that month featured a PAIRS [[iPhone]] App and questioned, "Can an iPhone App Save Your Marriage?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthland.time.com/2010/11/01/can-an-iphone-app-save-your%C2%A0marriage/ Luscombe, Belinda. "Can an iPhone App Save Your Marriage," Time Magazine, November 1, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] [[Veterans Health Administration]] featured PAIRS in an article about helping Veterans strengthen "their most significant relationships":

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Department of Veterans Affairs is trying a new path to caring for and healing the nation's wounded Veterans. Now, in addition to repairing their damaged bodies and minds, VA is going one step further and helping to repair their crumbling intimate relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va.gov/health/NewsFeatures/20121018a.asp Peterson, Hans. "Relationship Retreats: From Warriors to Soul Mates," Veterans Health Administration, October 18, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also in October 2012, PAIRS Foundation's collaboration with the San Diego VA Healthcare System was recognized with the "Spirit of Planetree Award" for the program's impact strengthening relationships between "family, friends and social supports as a central component of patient-centered care."&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2012/10/04/pairs-collaboration-with-va-recognized-with-prestigious-2012-spirit-of-planetree-award-104/ Henthorn, Robert. "PAIRS Collaboration with VA Recognized with Prestigious 2012 Spirit of Planetree Award," FatherhoodChannel.com, October 4, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetree.org/?page_id=2327 2012 Planetree Program Awards, Human Interactions/Independence, Dignity and Choice.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a joint effort with the Department of Veterans Affairs Patient-Centered Care and Cultural Transformation Initiative, PAIRS Foundation published the ''PAIRS Essentials VA Program Support Guide'' in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/pairs/docs/va_support PAIRS Essentials VA Program Support Guide, January 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation produced a video in May 2014 promoting the Warrior to Soul Mate program, supported by the PAIRS curriculum, as a valuable component of VA's efforts to promote health and wellness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1qDGaW-PbM U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation. "Health for Life: Strengthening Relationships through the Warrior to Soul Mate Program," Office of Patient Centered Care and Cultural Transformation, May 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation Sacred Trust==

In September 2011, the foundation's [[Operation Sacred Trust]] initiative, launched in collaboration with [[Carrfour Supportive Housing]], Henderson Behavioral Health, and Neighborhood Housing Services of South Florida, was awarded a $1 million grant from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Supportive Services for Veteran Families ("SSVF"), to help end homelessness for Veteran families in Broward and Miami-Dade counties. An additional $1 million was awarded in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.va.gov/homeless/ssvf.asp U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Supportive Services for Veteran Families website]&lt;/ref&gt; Two November 11, 2012 articles featured Operation Sacred Trust as a new model for ending homelessness for veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lilly|first=Christiana|title=Operation Sacred Trust Combats Veteran Homelessness In South Florida With $1 Million Grant |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/08/homeless-veterans-operation-sacred_n_2093151.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berman-Eisenberg|first=Stephanie|title=A step forward for homeless vets|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/11/11/3090081/a-step-forward-for-homeless-vets.html|publisher=Miami Herald|date=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 12, 2012, a CBS News story featured Operation Sacred Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newland|first=Maggie|title=Miami Man Turns Life Around, Gives Back to Fellow Veterans|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2012/11/12/miami-man-turns-life-around-gives-back-to-fellow-veterans/|publisher=CBS Miami|date=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage Equality==

Following the 2014 ruling of [[Robert Lewis Hinkle|U.S. District Judge Robert L. Hinkle]] that Florida's same sex marriage ban violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Court Rules that Florida Ban on Marriage for Same-Sex Couples is Unconstitutional|url=https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights/federal-court-rules-florida-ban-marriage-same-sex-couples-unconstitutional/|publisher=ACLU|date=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; PAIRS Foundation began offering ''PAIRS for Love, for Life'' classes in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]] and [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]], Florida specifically geared to committed, engaged and married same sex couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://equality.pairs.com PAIRS Classes for Same Sex Couples]&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Florida's 1998 Marriage Preparation and Preservation Act, completion of the PAIRS class allows same sex couples to receive a discount on marriage licenses and exemption from Florida's typical three-day waiting period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.flrules.org/1998/403 Florida Marriage Preparation and Preservation Act of 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curricula==

"PAIRS Essentials" is a nine-hour curriculum delivered in a group setting, with a PAIRS Instructor, often over a weekend, or in several weekly class sessions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://training.pairs.com/essentials/overview.php PAIRS Essentials Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;  "PAIRS For Our Future, For Our Family" is a 30-hour curriculum typically delivered over 12 weekly 2-1/2 hour sessions "&lt;ref&gt;[http://fatherhoodchannel.com/2012/10/17/national-marriage-education-study-117/ Henthorn, Robert. "National Study Shows Strong Consumer Satisfaction with Marriage and Relationship Education Classes," Fatherhood Channel, October 17, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; "PAIRS Mastery Course" is a 120-hour, semester-long curriculum delivered over four to seven months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pairsvirginia.com/class_schedule.html PAIRS Classes for Couples]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mechanical engineering]], a '''parallel force system''' is a situation in which two [[force]]s of equal magnitude act in the same direction [[Coplanarity|within the same plane]], with the counter force in the middle.  An example of this is a [[see saw]].  The children are applying the two forces at the ends, and the [[Lever|fulcrum]] in the middle gives the counter force to maintain the see saw in neutral position.  Another example are the major vertical forces on an [[airplane]] in flight (see image at right).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5828">Anna Cecilia '''Petra Östergren''' (born 29 September 1965 in [[Kiruna Municipality]]) is a Swedish [[feminist]] writer, debater, social commentator and an instructor in [[self defense]]. She has an MA in [[Social Anthropology]] ([[University of Stockholm]]), and is a doctoral student at [[Lund University]]. Her research is titled "The State of Feminism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/o.o.i.s?id=24890&amp;news_item=4626 Ulrika Oredsson.

== Self-defence ==
In the 1980s Östergren  helped launch a feminist self-defense movement in [[Sweden]]. She was active as an instructor in the organisation ''Pandora kvinnligt försvar'' (Pandora Women's Defense) and ran the Kung Fu club in the [[kajukenbo]] style in an effort to help women defend themselves against sexual assault. She was involved with the National Organisation for Women's Shelters and [[Roks]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roks.se/ Roks: Riksorganisationen för kvinnojourer och tjejjourer i Sverige (National organisation for women's and young women's shelters in Sweden)]&lt;/ref&gt;
She is the author of ''Slå tillbaka!: Handbok i självförsvar'' (Fight back!; A handbook of self-defence) published in 1993. She also wrote a book about her mother, who was beaten to death by a man she had had a brief relationship with, entitled ''Att komma till ro med det allra värsta'' (Coming to terms with the worst).

== Sociology and gender politics ==
Her involvement with teaching men self-defence made her a controversial figure with radical feminists, and the rift became complete when she published an article in [[Bang (magazine)|Bang]] magazine in which she questioned whether all pornography was essentially misogynous.

Östergren is considered a major critic of [[radical feminism]] in Sweden. In particular she has challenged their views on sex, violence and power, pointing out that violence in [[lesbian]] relationships did not differ significantly from that in [[heterosexual]] relationships. From its origin, Östergren was one of the few people who publicly challenged the radical feminist position on [[Prostitution in Sweden|prostitution]] which culminated in the ''sexköpslagen'' (Sex Purchase Act) 1999. She has been an advocate for the decriminalisation of prostitution. In 2006, she published ''Porr, horor och feminister'' (Pornography, whores and other feminists), an analysis of three decades of Swedish policy on [[pornography]] and prostitution, and a critique of radical feminist sexual politics. In 2008, she published an edited volume ''F-ordet: Mot en ny feminism'' (The F -word: Towards a new feminism), bringing together writers and commentators to provide new perspectives on old feminist issues.

== Work ==
In addition to her books, Östergren writes regularly for newspapers and magazines, including ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'', ''[[LO-tidningen]]'', ''[[Expressen]]'', ''[[Aftonbladet]]'', [[Axess magasin|''Axess'']] and ''Voltaire'' and regularly gives public talks, and is consulted on prostitution and gender issues.

'''Pheophorbide a''' is the product of [[chlorophyll]] breakdown. It is used as a [[photosensitizer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Chen, K.| title=Novel photosensitizer-protein nanoparticles for Photodynamic therapy: Photophysical characterization and in vitro investigations| journal=Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B: Biology| year=2009 | volume=96 | issue=1 | pages=66–74 | doi=10.1016/j.jphotobiol.2009.04.006|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with several photosensitizers is a promising modality for the treatment of cancer. In this study, the therapeutic effect of PDT using the synthetic photosensitizer pheophorbide a (Pa-PDT) was examined in AT-84 murine oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells.

[[File:Louvre Grab.JPG|thumb|Life sized pleurants from the [[tomb of Philippe Pot]]]]
[[File:Tien pleurants.jpg|thumb|Pleurants of Isabella of Bourbon]]
'''Pleurants''' or '''weepers''' (the English meaning of ''pleurants'') are anonymous sculpted figures representing [[mourner|mourners]], used to decorate elaborate [[tomb monument]]s, mostly in the late Middle Ages in Western Europe.  Typically they are relatively small, and a group were placed around the sides of a raised tomb monument, perhaps interspersed with armorial decoration, or carrying shields with this.  They may be in [[relief]] or free-standing.  In English usage the term "weepers" is sometimes extended to cover the small figures of the deceased's children often seen kneeling underneath the [[tomb effigy]] in Tudor tomb monuments. 

These figures represent the mourners, who pray for the deceased standing during the funeral procession.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Because many of the original tombs have been vandalised or destroyed, relatively few examples remain to be studied. Many figures have been detached from their original context, which is not always known.

In the 16th and 17th century the practice of placing anonymous pleurant figures disappeared, although the group at Brou for [[Margaret of Bourbon (1438–1483)|Margaret of Bourbon]] were not begun until 1526 at the earliest.  But these were commissioned over 40 years after her death by her daughter, along with tombs for herself and her husband, and reflected the taste of Margaret's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Burk, Jens Ludwig, "Conrat Meit, Margaret of Austria's Court Sculptor in Malines and Brou", Centre des monuments nationaux (France) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==
The type began in England in the 13th century, inspired by French examples. The first examples had relief figures set within quatrefoil frames, as in the tomb now used for [[Henry Marshal (bishop of Exeter)|Henry Marshal, Bishop of Exeter]] (d. 1206) in [[Exeter Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 146. The tomb now carries his effigy, but dates to the second half of the century&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded use of the English word is in a contract relating to the construction of the very grand tomb of [[Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick]], who died in 1437 in France, though the contract is some time later, and the weepers were made in 1452–53. This has the effigy and weepers in [[gilt-bronze]], and still stands in the [[Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick]], with the "xiv images embossed of lords and ladyes in divers verstures, called weepers", standing in niches around the sides, that were specified.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 207–209; [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=aKJbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10 the contract]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Franco-Burgundian examples ==
On the Continent they are especially a feature of the tombs of Franco-Burgundian royalty, imitated by some grand nobles.  The tomb at [[Royaumont Abbey]] of [[Louis of France (1244–1260)]], son of [[Louis IX of France]], appears to have popularized the type.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, 146&lt;/ref&gt;  Here a side of the chest below the effigy shows eight walking figures in relief in an arcade, led by two mitred clerics.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Louiss1260.jpg|image]]&lt;/ref&gt; One end of the chest had a relief of the dead prince, covered by a cloth that leaves his face exposed being carried by four bearers.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Cortège des funérailles de Louis de France (1260).jpg|Image, now musée Carnavalet]]. Rather bizarrely, after the Revolution this panel was re-used for the "grave" of [[Peter Abelard|Abelard]] and [[Héloïse]] at [[Père Lachaise]] cemetery.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Raimon Panikkar Alemany''', also known as '''Raimundo Panikkar''' and '''Raymond Panikkar'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20100826/53990452372.html|title=Biodata|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100829081848/http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20100826/53990452372.html|archivedate=2010-08-29|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; (November 2, 1918 &amp;ndash; August 26, 2010), was a Catalan [[Roman Catholic]] priest and a proponent of [[Interfaith dialogue|inter-religious dialogue]]. As a scholar, he specialized in [[comparative religion]].

==Early life and education==
Raimon Panikkar was born as the son of a Spanish [[Roman Catholic]] mother and a [[Hindu]] [[India]]n father in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{citejournal|work=Time|date=September 20, 2010|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was well-educated and from the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] bourgeoisie. His father, Ramunni Panikkar, belonged to  [[Malabar district|Malabar]] [[Nair]] family from [[South India]]. Panikkar's father was a freedom fighter during [[British Raj|British colonial rule in India]] and escaped from Britain and married into a Catalan family. Panikkar's father studied in England and was the representative of a German chemical company in Barcelona. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Educated at a [[Jesuit]] school, Panikkar studied chemistry and philosophy at the universities of [[University of Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] and [[Complutense University of Madrid|Madrid]], and Catholic Theology in Madrid and Rome. He earned a doctorate in philosophy at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]] in 1946 and a doctorate in chemistry in 1958.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{citejournal|work=The New York Times|date=September 6, 2010|page=A20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a third doctorate in theology at the [[Pontifical Lateran University]] in Rome in 1961.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; He compared St. Thomas Aquinas's Philosophy with the eighth-century Hindu philosopher [[Adi Shankara|Ādi Śańkara]]'s Interpretation of the [[Brahma Sutras]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

==Career==

In 1946 he was ordained a [[Catholic priest]], and became a professor of philosophy at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

He made his first trip to India in 1954 where he studied [[Indian philosophy]] and religion at the [[University of Mysore]] and [[Banaras Hindu University]], where he met several Western monks seeking Eastern forms for the expression of their Christian beliefs.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; "I left Europe [for India] as a Christian, I discovered I was a Hindu and returned as a Buddhist without ever having ceased to be Christian," he later wrote.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

While in Jerusalem during 1962, he was summoned to Rome by Opus Dei founder and director, [[Saint]] [[Josemaría Escrivá]], who expelled him after a brief trial where he was charged with disobedience to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Raimon Panikkar |author= Raffaele Luise |id= San Paolo |place= Milan |year=2011 |pages= 25-32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 he became a visiting professor at [[Harvard Divinity School]] and a professor of religious studies at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; For many years he taught in the spring and spent the rest of the year doing research in India.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Where the typical approach to Cross-Cultural Religious Studies, especially in a secular university, was to hold two or more traditions at arm's length and draw lines of comparison between them, Panikkar's approach was to view issues in the real world through the eyes of two or more traditions.

In 1987 he moved to [[Tavertet]] in [[Catalonia]], in the hills north of Barcelona, where he founded the Raimon Panikkar Vivarium Foundation, a center for intercultural studies.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; 
In 2005 he creates Arbor &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moneyhouse registration|url=http://www.moneyhouse.ch/en/p/panikkar_alemany_raimon-4995690/|website=Moneyhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the realization of his principle of interreligious collaboration for the relief of poverty in thousands of villages of India &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arbor Foundation India|url=https://www.arborindia.org|website=Arbor India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panikkar authored more than 40 books and 900 articles. His complete works are being published in Italian. His 1989 [[Gifford Lectures]] were published in English by Orbis in 2009 under the title "The Rhythm of Being."

In a statement from his residence in Tavertet dated January 26, 2010, he wrote: "Dear Friends . . . I would like to communicate with you that I believe the moment has come, (put off time and again), to withdraw from all public activity, both the direct and the intellectual participation, to which I have dedicated all my life as a way of sharing my reflections.  I will continue to be close to you in a deeper way, through silence and prayer, and in the same way I would ask you to be close to me in this last period of my existence.  You have often heard me say that a person is a knot in a network of relationships; in taking my leave from you I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for having enriched me with the relationship I have had with each of you.  I am also grateful to all of those who, either in person or through association, continue working to spread my message and the sharing of my ideals, even without me.  Thankful for the gift of life which is only such if lived in communion with others: it is with this spirit that I have lived out my ministry."

'''''Sasquatch''''', also known as '''''Sasquatch, the Legend of Bigfoot''''', is a docudrama filmed in 1975 by North American Film Productions, Oregon Ltd., at the height of public fascination with accounts and tales of [[Bigfoot]] sightings.

The film follows a group of explorers on a summer-long search for the mythical Bigfoot creature. The audience is informed that the search takes place in Northwest Canada ([[British Columbia]]) along the 'Peckatoe River Valley' but in reality the movie was filmed further south in the Three Sisters Wilderness area of the [[Cascade Range|Cascade Mountain Range]] near Bend, [[Oregon]].

While sometimes compared to other Bigfoot documentary films of the era such as (''[[The Legend of Boggy Creek]]'' (1972) and ''Creature From Black Lake'' (1976), the film does not feature on-camera interviews with possible eyewitnesses. The producers strived for a sense of believability and used taglines like "The most complete and only true story of Bigfoot ever filmed" in promotional material. The film features a number of animal stunts, including cougar and bear attacks. To simulate the grizzly attack, Tootsie Rolls were placed on actor Lou Salerni's shoulder, where they were eaten by the trained bear. Animals were supplied by Dick Robinson who, along with ''Sasquatch'' co-producer and editor John Fabian, went on to make a Grizzly Adams-type film "The Life and Legend of Buffalo Jones". That film was also co-directed by ''Sasquatch'' cast member / narrator George Lauris and its soundtrack contains music by ''Sasquatch'' contributors [[Al Capps]] &amp; [[Lane Caudell]]. The "Life and Legend of Buffalo Jones" film ultimately became known as ''Buffalo Rider''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Brett|title=George Lauris: On the Trail of Bigfoot...Sasquatch--A True Story|journal=Filmfax|date=Fall 2010|issue=125|pages=101–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The film begins in the forest with shots of local wildlife, agitated and on alert, but the source is not seen on screen. The camera then switches to a first person view, hinting at an unseen presence and the scene culminates with the view of a large human-like creature's reflection at water's edge while a haunting wail echos through the forest. Opening credits are next, followed by a review of recent Bigfoot stories via newspaper clippings and narration. Next up is the well-known [[Patterson–Gimlin film]], shot by Roger Patterson on October 20, 1967, in Bluff Creek, CA which shows an ape-like creature walking along a dry creek bed. The narrator goes on to explain that by running statistical data through modern computers, a site in British Columbia has been determined as the most likely spot for a population of [[Sasquatch]] to live undisturbed. An expedition is mounted, hoping to verify the creature's existence and secure funding for future research into the phenomenon.

The seven man team is composed of Native American guide Techka Blackhawk, seasoned wilderness explorer Josh Bigsby, wise-cracking reporter Bob Vernon, anthropologist Dr. Paul Markham, cook Barney Snipe, animal handler Hank Parshall and team leader Chuck Evans who also narrates the film. The team is on horseback and brings tracking dogs to aid in the hunt.

As the film progresses, tales of Sasquatch encounters by earlier explorers are interwoven with the current expedition's adventure and told as campfire stories. These scenes are recreated by uncredited cast members and include the [[Ape Canyon]] incident in which miners are attacked while sleeping in their cabin and an encounter by early pioneer explorers Bauman and Jessup. Initially the expedition takes on the feel of a nature trek, but as we reach a scene where the team is traversing a hillside it takes on a more ominous feel. As rocks begin tumbling down towards them from above, Techka stops the caravan in time to avoid injuries but the cause of the rockslide is unknown. From this point on the film becomes more focused on its intended subject, the search for Bigfoot. After this incident the team feels they're being watched by 'someone or something' and everyone takes turns guarding the camp at night. One evening a bear attacks while they sleep and everyone is shaken up but none are seriously injured. On a subsequent evening the camp is once again attacked, but this time the lookout was able to scare off the attacker(s) with gunshots. The following day they find large footprints in the areas surrounding the camp and employ the tracking dogs. While some team members take plaster molds of the tracks, Hank and his dogs follow a scent to the base of a sheer rock wall but cannot continue due to the difficult terrain.

As the expedition nears their intended destination, they discover tall trees snapped in half well above human reach. Techka tells them it is a sign the Sasquatch use to mark their territory and upon entering the valley, the team finds more footprints and sets up camp. They install a tripwire system around the perimeter and post lookouts. The team notes that the forest is eerily quiet that evening and well after dark, the inevitable happens. Multiple sensors begin to light up, the camp is attacked and we hear the same haunting wail as earlier. As the lookouts scramble for a clear shot with their tranquilizer guns, large boulders and branches are thrown in from multiple directions. Paul Markham is injured by one of the rocks and one of the shadowy creatures actually invades the camp and destroys most of the surveillance equipment. The attackers are eventually scared off and when daylight comes the team gets a good look at the devastation. There are many footprints around the camp but no signs of a dead or wounded Sasquatch. By now summer is almost over and winter storms are looming so the team packs up and begins their long trek back to civilization. In the final scene the camera pans out to a wide shot of the team departing, showcasing a picturesque view of the valley and its surrounding mountains. During the closing credits we see a large human-like silhouette, the same one seen in promotional movie posters, looking down at the camera from a hilltop as it slowly turns and walks away.

==Production==
The film was shot in [[Bend, Oregon|Bend]] and [[Sisters, Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Bigfoot: The Inside Story|p=322|author=Long, Greg|year=2004|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn= 978-1-615-92374-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The film's soundtrack is a combination of serene '70s style folk / country (title track 'High in the Mountains') and summer blockbuster style orchestral music. Both are well suited to the scenes they accompany and when combined with the 'authentic' Sasquatch wail used, lend a great deal of atmosphere to the film. The title track, written and performed by [[Al Capps]] &amp; [[Lane Caudell]], was available on vinyl 45's for a limited time but has long since gone out of production.

==Distribution==
The film was originally released by North American Film Enterprises Inc. and was shown in theaters nationwide in the mid to late '70s. Distributors such as RetroMedia, RetroFlix, Image Entertainment and VCI Home Video have re-released it on DVD. A remastered version complete with an additional six minute introduction sequence (shown separately from the main picture) was released by Code Red on Blu-Ray in late 2016. It featured a scene that had been in the original theatrical release showing a young Native-American boy being pursued by a Sasquatch. The scene was thought lost for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sasquatch Legend of Bigfoot Blu-ray|url=http://codereddvd.bigcartel.com/product/sasquatch-encounters-with-the-unknown-bd-50-limited-edition-blu|website=Code Red Store}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5135">The '''Savory brittleness scale''' is used to describe the position on a simple 1 to 10 scale of any environment based upon the distribution of humidity throughout each year, to assist with management decisions. It was developed by [[Allan Savory]], a [[Zimbabwe]]an biologist, because scientists were only recognizing desertification taking place in low rainfall or “fragile” environments. Savory recognized that desertification was the extreme or terminal form of man-made [[land degradation]], but that this began with simple biodiversity loss that was occurring at all levels of rainfall from high to low. Fragile environments did not cover the situation because Savory thought all environments were fragile. The scale is used in land management because the annual distribution of humidity affects the way entire biological communities function on the land, and in particular to conservation or resting the environment to maintain or restore biodiversity. He also noted that the distribution of humidity and thus position on the brittleness scale influenced the effects of such things as fire and grazing by large herbivores.

==Scale==

The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with 1 being non-brittle and 10 being very brittle. The scale is subjective; there is no formula for its calculation. A [[tropical rainforest]] is considered a 1 on the scale, and an arid [[desert]] such as the [[Namib]] or [[Gobi]] is considered a 10.

Position on the scale is determined not from rainfall records but from field observation because humidity is influenced by several factors such as altitude or prevailing winds. Savory used the term brittleness because an easy practical observation is whether or not a dead grass stem or small dead twig is soft and easily bent by hand or so brittle it snaps. For these reasons it differs from an  [[aridity index]]. Thus, some high rainfall environments, e.g., Zambia, with 2,000&amp;nbsp;mm annual rainfall and distinct wet and dry seasons, is higher on the brittleness scale because of the long portions of the year without rainfall. An environment with lower total rainfall distributed fairly evenly throughout the year, such as parts of England with 600&amp;nbsp;mm annually, are lower on the brittleness scale.

==Effect of brittleness==

Grass leaves and stems that die off above ground every year following the growing season break down slowly and mainly through oxidation in sunlight and physical weathering in the more brittle environments. And trees dying in such environments tend to remain standing for many years again gradually breaking down through oxidation and weathering from the top down. At the opposite end of the scale where humidity distribution is more even dead plant material tends to break down rapidly through high micro-organism activity or biological decay. Commonly a dead tree will decay at the base, fall and decay on the ground. Other observations Savory made were that at the lower end of the scale most herbivores naturally were insects with few large herbivores and solitary predators, while moving toward the higher end large herding herbivores and pack-hunting predators increased.

The effect of resting the environment to allow recovery and maintenance of biodiversity is different across the brittleness scale. At the low end resting the environment as in establishing wilderness or conservation is the most powerful action possible to restore biodiversity. Moving across the scale the same practice can become increasingly damaging to the health of entire communities. This is why Savory argued that abandoned cities of past ages low on the scale are today found under recovered tropical forest, while abandoned cities at the other end in former savannas are today found under desert sands. Total protection by removing all livestock leads to recovery of biodiversity in the perennially humid environments in the US, but the same practice in places such as New Mexico has led to severe desertification.

The '''Socialist Unity Network''' was a small network of the [[far-left]] in the [[United Kingdom]] which was not affiliated with any single [[political party]]. It grew out of the [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]] (SA) in England, and was initiated by several non-aligned members of the SA executive in March 2004.

Members of the network were supporters of [[Respect - The Unity Coalition]] and other left electoral initiatives including the [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]]. The main aspect of the network was its now defunct website, which had regularly updated articles from a wide range of socialist  perspectives on issues including the possibilities of creating socialist unity.

==History==
The network was formed in March 2004 by several non-aligned members of the Socialist Alliance in England, and grew to include left-wing activists from a range of political parties and campaigning organisations, and those with no party affiliation. It was centrally involved in the debates around the winding down of the Socialist Alliance and the formation of Respect. It produced its own leaflets on occasions and in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]] some members of the network stood as "Socialist Unity" candidates, providing a banner under which independent socialists could choose to stand, as part of the [[Socialist Green Unity Coalition]], a coalition with the Socialist Party.

Socialist Unity candidates stood again in the 2006 council elections, gaining over 5% of the vote in Swindon, and over 10% in Hackney. The network also produced a 2005 election guide with ''[[Red Pepper (magazine)|Red Pepper]]'' magazine.

Leading members included Jim Jepps (later a Green Party activist), Declan O'Neill, Andy Newman (later a Labour Party member),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andy-newman Andy Newman &amp;#124; The Guardian] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420115503/http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andy-newman |date=April 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Caygill, John Nicholson, Martin Wicks (of Swindon Trades Council), Pete Green, Nick Bird, Salman Shaheen (journalist, and co-editor of Third Estate blog), Reuben Rosenberg (journalist, and co-editor of Third Estate blog) and Tawfiq Chahboune.

== Core beliefs ==
The "who we are" section on the socialist unity network webpage stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Socialist Unity Network originated in the Socialist Alliance. It is not a political group conceived to add to the competition between the many socialist organisations which already exist. It is a network of activists which campaigns for the widest practical collaboration of left groups and movements resisting the attacks of the Blair government.

In England the left has failed to make the break with the sectarian legacy that has dogged the "far left" for so long. Such divisions undermine our ability to build a fightback against the Blair government.

The Socialist Unity Network therefore believes that, in the interests of building resistance and striving to create the conditions in which a socialist alternative to New Labour can emerge, it is necessary to strive to develop [[collaborative method]]s of working as widely as possible. This is similar to the process that led to the formation of the SSP in Scotland, which was the result of a number of years of common work and discussion which enabled previously competing and sometimes hostile organisations to overcome old antagonisms and to develop greater political agreement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''The Center for the Blue Economy''', commonly referred to as CBE, is a research center that is managed by the [[Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey|Middlebury Institute of International Studies]] (MIIS) located in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[California]]. The CBE research focuses on the [[Blue economy|Blue Economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/centers-initiatives/center-blue-economy|title=Center for the Blue Economy|website=Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;The CBE was founded in 2011. It received the initial fund of $1 million from Robin and Deborah Hicks, the parents of the Middlebury College students, in their capacities as trustees of the Loker Foundation. Professor Jason Scorse, who is also the Head/Chair of [[International Environmental Policy]] (IEP) program at MIIS, is the Director of Center of Blue Economy. The CBE was created to address the issues related to “Blue Economy’ in the ocean and coastal areas.

== Research focus ==
The research at the CBE mainly focuses on determining the factors that ensure [[sustainability]] and [[economics]] of oceans and coastal regions. The research at the center provides open-access data to different stakeholders, including businesses, governments, nonprofits that could help them to make decisions for managing ocean and coastal resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.montereyherald.com/2011/03/03/your-town-planning-commission-adds-member/|title=Your Town: Planning Commission adds member|date=2011-03-03|work=Monterey Herald|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research also focuses on climate change adaptation in coastal areas, governing the environmental issues and providing possible solutions considering the ocean and coastal issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/green/reports/2012/06/27/11794/the-foundations-of-a-blue-economy/|title=The Foundations of a Blue Economy - Center for American Progress|work=Center for American Progress|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The center collaborates with various local and national organizations and they worked on a wide range of topics related to ocean and coastal areas. The center also offers specialization course of  [https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/centers-initiatives/center-blue-economy/academics/ocrm Ocean and Coastal Resource Management](OCRM) for the IEP program.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|title=Growing the Blue Economy|date=2016-09-30|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.14217/b703c0fe-en|work=The Blue Economy and Small States|pages=33–41|publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat|isbn=9781848599505|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CBE Advisory Council ==
The CBE Advisory Council has experts from different backgrounds and experiences including marine science, policy and business. The team aims to make a change and shape the future of blue economy. The organogram of the CBE Advisory Council is shown in Figure. 

===Grants and funding===
The CBE 2018 received grants from three major sources:71% federal government, 28% state and local agencies, and 1% other sources (see Table 1).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1157">'''Toxic capacity''' can mean the [[toxicity]] of a substance, possibly in relation to a specific [[organism]] and '''toxic capacity''' can mean the capacity of an organism, organic system or [[ecosystem]] to contain a toxic substance or a selection of toxic substances (a compound) without showing signs of poisoning or dying.

==Toxic capacity among humans, children==
Generally people with less mass have a lower toxic capacity than people with larger mass.  In particular, children (who have lower mass compared to an adult) are more vulnerable to toxic effects of compounds.  The compounds do not have to be poisons but could be medications as well, which is why children's dosages are almost always less than those of an adult, and the overdose danger higher for children.

UDI involves considering the potential needs of all learners when designing and delivering instruction by identifying and eliminating unnecessary barriers to teaching and learning while maintaining academic rigor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Burgstahler | first = Sheryl |author2=Burgstahler, S. |author3=Cory, R. | year = 2008 | title = Universal Design in Higher Education: From Principles to Practice  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TUEmAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Universal+design+in+higher+education:+From+principles+to+practice&amp;dq=Universal+design+in+higher+education:+From+principles+to+practice&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ySIMUbKqBYvS9AT64oHoCw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA | publisher  = Harvard Education Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; UDI is thus proactive and benefits all students, in contrast to providing accommodations for a specific student (e.g., providing a [[sign language]] interpreter for a student who is [[deaf]]).

==Background==

Universal Design for Instruction (UDI) applies and adapts universal design principles and the Principles of Universal Design&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsu.edu/project/design-projects/udi/center-for-universal-design/the-principles-of-universal-design/ Principles of Universal Design, Center for Universal Design, NCSU]&lt;/ref&gt; to learning environments and learning products, with a goal toward maximizing learning for all students.

[[Universal design|Universal design (UD)]], a concept pioneered by architect Ronald Mace at [[North Carolina State University|North Carolina State University (NCSU)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.design.ncsu.edu/cud/about_ud/udprinciples.htm |title=Center for Universal Design, NCSU |access-date=2008-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513071023/http://www.design.ncsu.edu/cud/about_ud/udprinciples.htm |archive-date=2008-05-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to [[buildings]], [[Product (business)|products]], and environments that are inherently accessible to both people without disabilities and people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwm.edu/~edyburn/ud.html#anticipating A Primer on Universal Design (UD) in Education, Dave L. Edyburn, Ph.D.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Center for Universal Design at NCSU established a set of Principles of Universal Design&lt;ref&gt;Center for Universal Design, [http://www.ncsu.edu/project/design-projects/udi/center-for-universal-design/the-principles-of-universal-design/ Principles of Universal Design]&lt;/ref&gt; based on UD to guide and evaluate the [[design process]], with a goal toward creating more accessible products and environments. Universal Design for Instruction is an educational framework and set of strategies that applies both UD and the Principles of Universal Design to academic and teaching environments, learning products, and learning materials.

Specific UDI [[Conceptual framework|frameworks]] and educational initiatives vary between academic and policy institutions. The Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/doit/CUDE/ Center for Universal Design in Education]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[the DO-IT Center]] ([[University of Washington]]) combines UD, the Principles of Universal Design and [[Universal Design for Learning|Universal Design for Learning (UDL)]] to create UDI strategies for applying universal design to [[educational]] products and [[Knowledge environment|environment]]s.&lt;ref name=EAUDI&gt;[http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Academics/equal_access_udi.html Equal Access: Universal Design of Instruction]&lt;/ref&gt; Each CUDE strategy is linked with relevant principles of UD and UDL.&lt;ref name =EAUDI/&gt; Using a different approach, the Center on Postsecondary Education and Disability at the [[University of Connecticut]] developed a set of UDI principles that draws on the work of Chickering and Gamson,&lt;ref&gt;Scott, McGuire, &amp; Shaw, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; who had originally published a set of principles for more inclusive [[postsecondary education]], as well as the Principles of Universal Design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tss.uoguelph.ca/uid/uduid.cfm Universal Design and Universal Instructional Design - University og Guelph]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==

The original seven Principles of Universal Design for products and environments established by the Center for Universal Design at NSCU&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsu.edu/project/design-projects/udi/center-for-universal-design/the-principles-of-universal-design/ The Principles of Universal Design]&lt;/ref&gt; follow; UDI applies these principles to learning environments.&lt;ref&gt;Burgstahler, Sheryl, [http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Academics/ud_edu.html Universal Design in Education: Principles and Applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Principle 1: Equitable Use
*Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
*Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive
*Principle 4: Perceptible Information
*Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
*Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
*Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

The DO-IT Center's Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE) combines UDI strategies and UD principles with the more specific [[Universal Design for Learning|Universal Design for Learning (UDL)]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;Burgstahler, Sheryl, [http://www.washington.edu/doit/Brochures/Academics/instruction.html Universal Design of Instruction (UDI): Definition, Principles, Guidelines, and Examples]&lt;/ref&gt; Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is "a set of principles for curriculum development that give all individuals equal opportunities to learn."&lt;ref&gt;Center for Applied Special Technology, CAST [http://www.cast.org/udl/faq/ Universal Design in Learning: About UDL ]&lt;/ref&gt; UDL guidelines encourage curriculum designers to provide the student with options with respect to the following:

*UDL 1: Perception
*UDL 2: Language, Expressions, Symbolism
*UDL 3: Comprehension
*UDL 4: Physical Action
*UDL 5: Expressive Skills and Fluency
*UDL 6: Executive Functions
*UDL 7: Recruiting Interest
*UDL 8: Sustaining Effort and Persistence
*UDL 9: Self-Regulation
 

The [[University of Connecticut]] researchers and practitioners propose nine principles that describe a successful implementation of Universal Design ''for'' Instruction. Four of them state that materials and activities should be:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mohawkcollege.ca/dept/stdev/Disability/UID-Faculty-Workbook.pdf UID Faculty Workbook - Mohawk College]&lt;/ref&gt;

*1: Accessible and fair,
*2: Flexible,
*3: Straightforward and consistent, and
*4: Explicit. 

Three principles for universal design for instruction state that the learning environment should:
*5: Be supportive,
*6: Minimize unnecessary physical effort, and
*7: Accommodate students and multiple teaching methods.

Universal design for instruction includes two more principles related to the delivery environment:

*8: Tolerance for error and
*9: Size and space for approach and use.

== Examples of application to instruction ==

Ways of applying UD to instruction include those listed below.

* '''Delivery Methods''': Use of a variety of delivery methods and learning approaches, including lecture, discussion, hands-on activities, projects, cases, and Internet-based interaction. All should be accessible to students with a wide range of abilities, backgrounds, and previous experiences.
* '''Learning Methods and Materials''': Print materials should be available in electronic format. Provide text descriptions of graphics presented on web pages. Use presentation tools to make presentations legible in large spaces. Use captioned video presentations. Provide outlines in advance to allow students to prepare for the topic to be presented. Create printed and web-based materials in simple, intuitive, and consistent formats.
* '''Interaction''': Encourage different ways for students to interact with each other and with the facilitator. This may include in-class questions and discussion, group work, and Internet-based communications.
* '''Feedback''': Provide effective prompting during an activity and feedback after the assignment is complete. Use feedback to help students correct errors and misconceptions. Allow opportunities for self-assessment. Ensure that electronic-based learning tools provide proper feedback for both navigation and learning and are designed in an accessible format.
* '''Assessment/Demonstration of Knowledge''': Ensure that students’ opportunity to demonstrate knowledge is frequent and if possible, flexible. Consider options besides tests and papers for demonstrating knowledge, such as group work, demonstrations, portfolios, and videotaped or on-site presentations.
* '''Physical Effort and Access''': Ensure that classrooms, labs, and field work are accessible to individuals with a wide range of physical abilities. Make sure equipment and activities minimize sustained physical effort and accommodate people with different physical abilities. Ensure the safety of all students. Minimize the need for unnecessary physical travel by making materials available or allowing them to be submitted electronically.

==The process==

The Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE) at the [[The DO-IT Center|DO-IT Center]] describes UDI as "a goal, a process, and a set of practices."&lt;ref name=EAUDI/&gt; According to CUDE, the UDI process is described as the following series of steps:&lt;ref name="EAUDI"/&gt;

#'''Identify the course.''' Describe the course, its learning [[Goal|objectives]], and its overall [[content (media)|content]].
#'''Define the universe.''' Describe the overall [[population]] of students eligible to enroll in the course and then consider their potential diverse characteristics (e.g., with respect to gender; age; [[ethnicity]] and race; native language; learning style; and abilities to see, hear, manipulate objects, read, and communicate).
#'''Involve students.''' Consider perspectives of students with diverse characteristics, as identified in Step 2, in the development of the course. If they are not available directly from students, gain student perspectives through diversity programs such as the campus disability services office.
#'''Adopt instructional strategies.''' Adopt overall learning and teaching philosophies and methods. Integrate these practices with universal design guidelines or strategies for learning or instruction.
#'''Apply instructional strategies.''' Apply universal design strategies in concert with good instructional practices (both identified in Step 4) to the overall choice of course teaching methods, [[curricula]], and assessments. Then apply universal design to all lectures, classroom discussions, group work, handouts, web-based content, labs, fieldwork, assessment instruments, and other academic activities and materials to maximize the learning of students with the wide variety of characteristics identified in Step 2.
#'''Plan for accommodations.''' Learn campus procedures for addressing accommodation requests (e.g., arrangement of sign language interpreters) from specific students for whom the course design does not automatically provide full access.
#'''Evaluate.''' Monitor the effectiveness of instruction through observation and feedback from students with the diverse set of characteristics identified in Step 2, assess learning, and modify the course as appropriate.

The university offers 143 undergraduate degree programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Admissions|url=http://www1.umn.edu/twincities/admissions.php|publisher=Regents of the University of Minnesota|accessdate=September 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 200 graduate degree programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Degree Programs|url=http://twin-cities.umn.edu/academics|website=Academics webpage|publisher=University of Minnesota, Twin Cities|accessdate=February 21, 2016|date=2015-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has all three branches of the [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC)|url=http://www.catalogs.umn.edu/ug/rotc/rotcinfo.html|publisher=Regents of the University of Minnesota |accessdate=September 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Minnesota Twin Cities as well as its sister campuses at [[University of Minnesota Crookston|Crookston]], [[University of Minnesota Duluth|Duluth]], and [[University of Minnesota Morris|Morris]] are accredited by the [[Higher Learning Commission]] (HLC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.academic.umn.edu/provost/reviews/gen_institutional/accreditation_um.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505170140/http://academic.umn.edu/provost/reviews/gen_institutional/accreditation_um.html |archivedate=May 5, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The racial/ethnic breakdown of the student population is: 65.3% White, 12.7% International Students (that are undesignated race/ethnicity), 9.2% Asian, 4.3% Black, 3.1% Hispanic/Latino, 1.2% American/Native American Indian, and 4.2% Unknown.  63% of matriculants to the university are considered Minnesota residents, and 37% of matriculants are considered out-of-state residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = OIR : Enrollment Headcount Data: All Data | url = http://www.oir.umn.edu/student/enrollment/term/1159/current/show_all | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160209025041/http://www.oir.umn.edu/student/enrollment/term/1159/current/show_all | dead-url = yes | archive-date = February 9, 2016 | publisher = University of Minnesota Office of Institutional Research | accessdate = January 11, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the University Office of Institutional Research, as of Fall 2015, there are 30,511 undergraduates at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities campus. Of that number, 5,771 are first-time degree seeking freshmen. There are 12,659 graduate students.

===Minneapolis campus===
The original Minneapolis campus overlooked the [[Saint Anthony Falls]] on the [[Mississippi River]], but it was later moved about a mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) downstream to its current location. The original site is now marked by a small park known as Chute Square at the intersection of University and Central Avenues. The school shut down following a financial crisis during the American Civil War, but reopened in 1867 with considerable financial help from [[John S. Pillsbury]]. It was upgraded from a [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]] to a college in 1869.  Today, the university's Minneapolis campus is divided by the Mississippi River into an East and West Bank.

The campus now has buildings on both river banks. The "''East Bank''", the main portion of the campus, covers {{convert|307|acre|ha}}. The West Bank is home to the [[University of Minnesota Law School]], the [[Humphrey School of Public Affairs]], the [[Carlson School of Management]], various social science buildings, and the performing arts center. The St. Paul campus is home to the College of Biological Sciences (CBS), the College of Design (CDes), the College of Food, Agriculture and Natural Resource Sciences (CFANS), and the veterinary program.

The Minneapolis campus has several residence halls, 17th Avenue Hall, Centennial Hall, Frontier Hall, Territorial Hall, Pioneer Hall, Sanford Hall, Middlebrook hall, and Comstock Hall.

To help ease navigation of the large campus, the university has divided the '''East Bank''' into several areas: '''the Knoll area''', '''the Mall area''', '''the Health area''', '''the Athletic area''', and '''the Gateway area'''.

'''The Knoll area''', the oldest part of the university's current location, is in the northwestern part of the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uservices.umn.edu/heritage/knoll/historic.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927131946/http://www.uservices.umn.edu/heritage/knoll/historic.htm|archivedate=September 27, 2011 |title=The Campus Knoll|publisher=University of Minnesota}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[discipline]]s in this area relate to the [[humanities]]. Burton Hall is home to the [[University of Minnesota College of Education and Human Development|College of Education and Human Development]]. Many buildings in this area are well over 100 years old; a 13-building group comprises the [[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District|Old Campus Historic District]] on the U.S. [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uservices.umn.edu/heritage/about.htm|title= University of Minnesota Heritage Trail |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209121242/http://www.uservices.umn.edu/heritage/about.htm|archivedate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A residence hall, Sanford Hall, and a student-apartment complex, Roy Wilkins Hall, are in this area. The Institute for Advanced Study&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ias.umn.edu/ Institute for Advanced Study] IAS&lt;/ref&gt; is in the Nolte Center. This area is just south of the Dinkytown neighborhood and business area.

'''Northrop Mall''', or '''the Mall area''', is arguably the center of the Minneapolis campus. It was based on a design by [[Cass Gilbert]], although his plans were too extravagant to be fully implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Millett|first=Larry|title=AIA Guide to the Twin Cities: The Essential Source on the Architecture of Minneapolis and St. Paul|year=2007|isbn=978-0-87351-540-5 |pages=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the campus's primary buildings surround the Mall area. The [[Northrop Auditorium|Cyrus Northrop Memorial Auditorium]] provides a northern anchor, with [[Coffman Memorial Union]] (CMU) to the south. Four of the larger buildings to the sides of it are the primary [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]] buildings, (Vincent Hall, Tate Laboratory and Smith Hall, respectively) and [[Walter Library]]. The Mall area is home to the [[University of Minnesota College of Liberal Arts|College of Liberal Arts]], which is Minnesota's largest public or private college, and the [[University of Minnesota Institute of Technology|College of Science and Engineering]]. Behind CMU is another residence hall, Comstock Hall, and another student-apartment complex, Yudof Hall.

'''The Health area''' is to the southeast of the Mall area and focuses on undergraduate buildings for [[biological science|biological-science]] students, as well as homes to the College of [[Pharmacy]], the School of [[Nursing]], the [[University of Minnesota School of Dentistry|School of Dentistry]], the [[University of Minnesota Medical School|Medical School]], the [[University of Minnesota School of Public Health|School of Public Health]], and [[Fairview Health Services|Fairview Hospitals and Clinics]]. This complex of buildings forms what is known as the [[University of Minnesota Medical Center]]. Part of the [[University of Minnesota College of Biological Sciences|College of Biological Sciences]] is housed in this area.

{{anchor|Superblock}}&lt;!--the page [[Superblock (University of Minnesota)]] redirects to this anchor.--&gt;Across the street from Fairview Hospital is an area known as the "Superblock", a four-city-block space comprising four residence halls (Pioneer, Frontier, Centennial and Territorial Halls). The Superblock is one of the most popular locations for on-campus housing because it has the largest concentration of students living on campus and has a multitude of social activities between the residence halls.

'''The Athletic area''' is directly north of the Superblock and includes four recreation/athletic facilities: the University Recreation Center, Cooke Hall, the University Fieldhouse, and the [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)#University Aquatic center|University Aquatic Center]]. These facilities are all connected by tunnels and skyways allowing students to use one locker-room facility. North of this complex is the [[TCF Bank Stadium]], [[Williams Arena]], [[Mariucci Arena]], [[Ridder Arena]], and the [[Baseline Tennis Center]].

'''The Gateway area''', an easternmost section, is primarily office buildings instead of classrooms and lecture halls. The most prominent building is [[McNamara Alumni Center]]. The university is also heavily invested in a [[biomedical|biomedical-research]] [[initiative (enterprise)|initiative]] and has built five biomedical-research buildings that form a biomedical complex directly north of TCF Bank Stadium.

=====Notable architecture=====
[[File:Pillsbury Hall.jpg|thumb|[[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District#Pillsbury Hall, 1889|Pillsbury Hall]], one of the oldest buildings on campus (1889)]]
[[File:Weisman Art Museum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Weisman Art Museum|Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum]]]]
The [[University of Minnesota Armory|Armory]], northeast of the Northrop Mall, is built like a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] [[castle]], with a [[sally port|sally-port]] entrance facing Church Street, and a tower originally intended to be the Professor of [[Military Science]]'s residence, until it was found to be too cold. It originally held the athletics department as well as the military-science classes it now holds.

One of the oldest buildings on campus is [[University of Minnesota Old Campus Historic District#Pillsbury Hall, 1889|Pillsbury Hall]], designed in the [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] style and built using varieties of sandstone available in Minnesota. It has a unique color that is hard to capture in a photograph. Many of the buildings on the East Bank campus were designed by the prolific Minnesota architect [[Clarence H. Johnston, Sr.|Clarence Johnston]], including the [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] Folwell Hall and the [[Roman Renaissance]] [[Walter Library]], which he considered the heart of the university.

In more recent times, [[Frank Gehry]] designed the [[Weisman Art Museum|Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum]]. It is a typical example of his work with curving metallic structures.

Another new building is the addition to the Architecture building designed by [[Steven Holl]] and completed in 2002. It won an [[American Institute of Architects]] award for its innovative design. The Architecture building was then renamed Rapson Hall after the local [[modernist architecture|modernist]] architect and School of Architecture Dean [[Ralph Rapson]].

The university also has historic [[fraternities and sororities]] buildings (a "Greek row") north of Northrop Mall on University Avenue SE. 
{{main|List of Fraternities and Sororities at the University of Minnesota#Building Fraternity Row}}

Another notable building is Keller Hall, home to the computer science department. The building is built to reflect the design of a floppy disc. Areas 1 and 3 are in the basement, and are home to experiments in the building.

====West Bank====
[[File:Rarig Center-20071213.jpg|thumb|Department of Theatre Arts &amp;amp; Dance, Rarig Center]]
The '''West Bank''' covers {{convert|53|acre|ha}}. The West Bank Arts Quarter includes:

*[[Rarig Center]] (Theatre Arts &amp; Dance)
*The Barbara Barker Center for Dance
*Ferguson Hall (School of Music)
*Ted Mann Concert Hall
*Regis Center for Art

The Quarter is home to several annual interdisciplinary arts festivals.

The Social Sciences are also on the West Bank and include the [[Carlson School of Management]], the [[University of Minnesota Law School|Law School]], and the [[Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs]].

Wilson Library, the largest library in the university system, is also on the West Bank as is Middlebrook Hall, the largest residence hall on campus. Approximately 900 students reside in the building named in honor of William T. Middlebrook.&lt;ref&gt;Middlebrook served the University as Comptroller, VP of Business Administration, and was a longtime Secretary of the Board of Regents. He wrote a seminal text on estimating building needs for colleges and universities. Middlebrook graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1912, where he was a member of [[Phi Sigma Kappa]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Getting around====
[[File:Washington Avenue Bridge Minneapolis.jpg|thumb|The [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] connects the East Bank and West Bank portions of the [[Minneapolis]] campus.]]
[[File:Green Line, Coffman Union, and bus stop.jpg|thumb|A [[Green Line (Minnesota)|Green Line]] train after leaving the [[East Bank (Metro Transit station)|East Bank Station]], heading towards [[Downtown Minneapolis]]]]
The [[Washington Avenue Bridge (Minneapolis)|Washington Avenue Bridge]] crossing the Mississippi River provides access between the East and West Banks, on foot, designated bike lanes, or via free shuttle service. The bridge has two separate [[deck (bridge)|deck]]s: the lower deck for vehicles and the newly constructed light rail, and the upper deck for pedestrian and bicycle traffic. An unheated enclosed walkway runs the length of the bridge and shelters students from the weather. Walking and riding bicycles are the most common modes of transportation among students. University Police occasionally cite individuals for [[jaywalking]] as well as riding bicycles on restricted sidewalk areas in areas surrounding the university resulting in fines as high as $250. This is often done at the beginning of a school year or after pedestrians interfere with traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pedestrians should exercise caution|work=The Minnesota Daily|date=September 29, 2006 |url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/09/29/69182|accessdate=December 22, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212212526/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/09/29/69182 |archivedate=February 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some pedestrian tunnels to get from building to building during harsh weather; they are marked with signs reading "[[The Gopher Way]]".

The Minneapolis campus is near [[Interstate Highway System|Interstates]] [[Interstate 94|94]] and [[Interstate 35|35W]] and is bordered by the Minneapolis neighborhoods of [[Dinkytown]] (on the north), [[Cedar-Riverside, Minneapolis|Cedar-Riverside]] (on the west), [[Stadium Village]] (on the southeast), and [[Prospect Park, Minneapolis|Prospect Park]] (on the east).

Three [[Light rail in Minnesota|light-rail stations]] serve the university along the [[Green Line (Minnesota)|Green Line]]. The stations include [[Stadium Village (Metro Transit station)|Stadium Village]], the [[East Bank (Metro Transit station)|East Bank]], and the [[West Bank (Metro Transit station)|West Bank]]. The university partnered with [[Metro (Minnesota)|Metro]] to offer students, staff, and faculty members a [[Go-To card#Campus Zone Pass|Campus Zone Pass]] that enables free travel on the three stations that pass through campus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/pts/bus/campuszonepass.html|title=Campus Zone Pass|website=University of Minnesota Parking and Transportation|accessdate=February 24, 2016|date=Spring 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109142525/http://www1.umn.edu/pts/bus/campuszonepass.html|archivedate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a discounted unlimited pass for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pts.umn.edu/bus/upass|title=U-Pass|website=University of Minnesota Parking and Transportation|accessdate=May 1, 2018|date=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===St. Paul campus===
[[File:AerialUMN-SP012506.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of St. Paul campus, facing south]]
The St. Paul campus is in the city of [[Falcon Heights, Minnesota|Falcon Heights]], about {{convert|3|mi}} away from the Minneapolis campus. The default place name for the ZIP code serving the campus is "St. Paul", but "Falcon Heights" is also recognized for use in the street addresses of all campus buildings. The [[University of Minnesota College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences|College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences]], including the University of Minnesota Food Industry Center and many other disciplines from social sciences to [[vocational education]] are on this campus. This also includes the College of Continuing and Professional Studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ccaps.umn.edu/|title=COLLEGE OF CONTINUING AND PROFESSIONAL STUDIES|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=cce.umn.edu|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; College of Veterinary Medicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cvm.umn.edu/ |title=College of Veterinary Medicine |publisher=cvm.umn.edu |date=May 16, 2012 |accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the College of Biological Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.umn.edu/ |title=COLLEGE OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES |publisher=cbs.umn.edu |date= |accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extensive lawns, flowers, trees, woods, and the surrounding University research farm plots creates a greener and quieter campus. It has a grassy mall of its own and can be a bit of a retreat from the more-urban Minneapolis campus. Prominent on this campus is Bailey Hall, the St. Paul campus' only residence hall. There are campus connectors running every 5 minutes on the weekdays when school is in session, and every 20 minutes on weekends, allowing students easy access to both campuses.

The Continuing Education and Conference Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cce.umn.edu/Continuing-Education-and-Conference-Center/index.html|title=Continuing Education and Conference Center|publisher=University of Minnesota College of Continuing Education|accessdate=July 16, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823100748/http://www.cce.umn.edu/Continuing-Education-and-Conference-Center/index.html|archivedate=August 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which serves over 20,000 conference attendees per year, is also on the St. Paul campus.

The St. Paul campus is home to the College of Design's department of Design, Housing, and Apparel (DHA). Located in McNeal Hall, DHA includes the departmental disciplines of Apparel Design, Graphic Design, Housing Studies, Interior Design, and Retail Merchandising.

The St. Paul campus is known to University students and staff for the Dairy Salesroom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fscn.cfans.umn.edu/researchandservices/dairysalesroom/|title=Dairy Salesroom|publisher=Department of Food Science and Nutrition, College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences, University of Minnesota|date=January 20, 2010|accessdate=July 16, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523050352/http://fscn.cfans.umn.edu/researchandservices/dairysalesroom/|archivedate=May 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which sells food (including ice cream) produced in the university's state-certified dairy plant by students, faculty and staff, and the similar Meat Sales Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansci.umn.edu/meatlab.htm|title=Meat Science|publisher=Department of Animal Science, University of Minnesota|accessdate=July 16, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715163807/http://www.ansci.umn.edu/meatlab.htm|archivedate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The St. Paul campus borders the [[Minnesota State Fair]]grounds, which hosts the largest [[state fair]] in the United States by daily attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =2006 Detailed Daily Attendance| publisher =Minnesota State Fair| url =http://www.mnstatefair.org/pages/attendance.html| accessdate =July 17, 2007| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070928083455/http://www.mnstatefair.org/pages/attendance.html| archivedate =September 28, 2007| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fair lasts twelve days, from late August through Labor Day in early September. The grounds also serve a variety of functions during the rest of the year.

Although the Falcon Heights [[North American Numbering Plan|area code]] is 651, the university telephone system trunk lines use Minneapolis [[Telephone exchange|exchanges]] and its 612 area code.

===Commuting between Minneapolis and St. Paul campuses===
During the school year on regular weekdays, the Campus Connectors operate with schedule-less service as often as every five minutes during the busiest parts of the school day between 7:00am and 5:30pm, slowing to once every 15 or 20 minutes during earlier or later hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.umn.edu/pts/bus/connectors.html |title=Campus Connectors &amp;#124; Parking &amp; Transportation Services |website=Umn.edu |date= |accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated time to commute from St. Paul to East Bank is 15 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pts.umn.edu/bus/campus-connectors |title=Campus Connectors &amp;#124; Parking &amp; Transportation Services |website=Umn.edu |date= 2016-05-11|accessdate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the system carried 3.55 million riders. Despite the fact the shuttle service is free, it is comparatively inexpensive to operate: with an operating cost of $4.55 million in 2008, the operating subsidy was only $1.28 per passenger. Even [[Metro Transit (Minnesota)|Metro Transit]]'s busy [[METRO (Minnesota)|METRO]] [[Blue Line (Minnesota)|Blue Line]] light rail required a subsidy of $1.44 that year, and that was with many riders paying $1.75 or more for a ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/transportation/Evaluation2009/Evaluation2009.htm|title=2009 Transit System Performance Evaluation|publisher=Metropolitan Council|year=2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519222803/http://www.metrocouncil.org/planning/transportation/Evaluation2009/Evaluation2009.htm |archivedate=May 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campus safety===
The Step Up campaign is a program that helps students prevent crimes, sexual assault, and excessive drinking by teaching students how to intervene and prevent in a positive way.&lt;ref name="Step Up"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stepup.umn.edu/|title=Step Up|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do this by explaining the [[Bystander effect]]. The U of M also has a TXT-U emergency notification text messaging system that sends out a notification to all faculty, staff, and students in case of emergency.&lt;ref name="TXT - U"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/prepared/txtu/|title=TXT- U|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=October 1, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213316/http://www1.umn.edu/prepared/txtu/|archivedate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there are different resources which students are able to get help while getting home. 624-WALK, an escort to walk to adjacent campuses and neighborhoods, and Gopher Chauffeur, a van service that offers rides near and on campus. Both of these are free and open to all students, staff, and faculty.&lt;ref name="Creating a safe U"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.umn.edu/prepared/|title=Safety and Security|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are almost 200 AED's on campus and 200 yellow phones for emergency only calls. The University Police Station has 20 Code Blue Phones around campus that immediately connect people to their office. There are also over 2,000 security cameras being monitored 24 hours a day.&lt;ref name="Creating a safe U" /&gt;

====Sexual assaults====

More than 1,000 sexual assaults on campus were reported between the years 2010 and 2015.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;{{cite web|title=After Authorities Did Not Charge her Rapist U Student Fought Back|url=http://www.startribune.com/after-authorities-did-not-charge-her-rapist-u-student-fought-back/398051931/|work=Minneapolis Star Tribune|accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The total number of prosecutions for rape was zero according to Katie Eichele of the Aurora Center,&lt;ref name=Tribune/&gt; until the conviction of [[2014 University of Minnesota rape case|Daniel Drill-Mellum]] in 2016, for the rapes of two fellow students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Former University of Minnesota Frat Brother Sentenced to 6 Years in Prison for Rape|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/news/a63590/university-of-minnesota-daniel-drill-mellum-rape-sentenced-prison/|work=Cosmopolitan|accessdate=October 23, 2016|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the sexual assaults on campus, few are reported to university police.&lt;ref name=Fox9&gt;{{cite web|title=1 in 10 rape cases on University of Minnesota campus lead to arrest|url=http://www.fox9.com/news/investigators/12385885-story|work=Fox 9 News|accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Six resulted in arrest from 2010 to 2015; one was determined to be unfounded.&lt;ref name=Fox9/&gt; In a study by campus police, in the years between 2005 and 2015, sexual assaults at the university remained the same or increased&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Year Part I Crime Statistics|url=https://police.umn.edu/10yearcrime|work=University of Minnesota Public Safety|accessdate=October 23, 2016|date=2015-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite six sexual assault resources and many anti-crime programs on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Universities and Fraternities Must Tell the Whole Truth’ About Sexual Violence|url=http://time.com/100084/campus-sexual-assault-fraternities/|work=Time|accessdate=October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Working Together to Address Campus Sexual Violence|url=https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/ojp/forms-documents/Documents/2015%20Conference%20on%20Crime%20and%20Victimization/Presentations/Sexual%20Violence%20on%20College%20Campuses.pdf|work=University of Minnesota|accessdate=October 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210042625/https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/ojp/forms-documents/Documents/2015%20Conference%20on%20Crime%20and%20Victimization/Presentations/Sexual%20Violence%20on%20College%20Campuses.pdf|archive-date=February 10, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Here's What's Missing From the Stats on Campus Rape|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/10/campus-crime-statistics-undercount-sexual-assaults|work=MotherJones|accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the University of Minnesota handles sexual assault|url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2015/04/01/bcst-sexual-assault-university-of-minnesota|work=Minnesota Public Radio|accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Big Ten Academic Alliance ==
The University of Minnesota is a participant in the [[Big Ten Academic Alliance]]. The Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) is the academic consortium of the universities in the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Engaging in $10 billion in research in 2014–2015, BTAA universities provide powerful insight into important issues in medicine, technology, agriculture, and communities. Students at participating schools are also allowed "in-house" borrowing privileges at other schools' libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/projects/library/reciprocal-borrowing/introduction |title=Reciprocal Library Borrowing |publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BTAA uses collective purchasing and licensing, and has saved member institutions $19 million to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/projects/purchasing-and-licensing |title=Purchasing and Licensing |publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Course sharing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/SharedCourses.aspx|title=Sharing Access to Courses|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[professional development]] programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/Leadership.aspx|title=Leadership Development|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[study abroad]] and international collaborations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/GlobalCollaborations.aspx|title=Global Collaborations|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other initiatives are also part of the BTAA.

==Student life and traditions==
===Greek life, professional and honor societies===
{{main|List of fraternities and sororities at the University of Minnesota}}
The number of fraternities and sororities at the University of Minnesota is extensive. Including defunct branches, the Greek System numbers more than 200 organizations. Approximately half of these continue to operate today.&lt;ref&gt;For examples, see any edition of the [http://umedia.lib.umn.edu/taxonomy/term/819 Minnesota Gopher Yearbook], which featured fraternities and sororities during its century-long publication run. Website accessed June 30, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The university's Greek societies include the residential [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|Academic and Social]] chapters including non-residential multicultural groups. The Greek System includes some but not all [[Professional fraternities and sororities|Professional Fraternities]], [[Honor society|Honor Societies]], Religious and [[Service fraternities and sororities|Service Fraternities]]. Fraternities and sororities have built several historically significant "Fraternity Row" homes along University Ave. SE, 10th Ave. SE, 4th Street SE, and 5th Street SE, all in Minneapolis, or along Cleveland Ave. near the St. Paul campus.&lt;ref name="HistoricalStudy2003"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = University of Minnesota Greek Letter Chapter House Designation Study, prepared for the Minneapolis Heritage Preservation Commission | author = Carole Zellie | location = Author's firm: Landscape Research, St. Paul, MN | date = 2003 | pages = 3–4 of 180, and throughout by chapter entry }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2018, approximately 3,900 system members made up about 11% of the campus population. Minnesota hosts 38 academic fraternities, 20 academic sororities, 56 honors societies, 31 professional societies, and two service-focused chapters.&lt;ref name="OFSL2017"&gt;[http://fsl.umn.edu/about-us/reports-statistics/ The University of Minnesota / Office for Fraternity and Sorority Life annual report], accessed 9 Sept, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Minnesota, [http://sua.umn.edu/ List of student organizations].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
[[File:Northrupmall.jpg|thumb|upright|The eastern edge of the Northrop Mall, Spring 2008]]

====Print====
''[[Minnesota Daily|The Minnesota Daily]]'' is published only twice a week during the normal school season as of the Fall 2016 semester.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/u-of-m-student-newspaper-to-cut-back-print-edition-to-2-days-a-week/384877851/|title=U of M student newspaper to cut back print edition to 2 days a week|last=Maura|first=Lerner|date=June 29, 2016|work=Star Tribune|access-date=August 2, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is printed once each week during the summer. The ''Daily'' is operated by an autonomous organization run entirely by students. It was first published on May 1, 1900. Outside of every day news coverage the paper has also published special issues such as the Grapevine Awards, Ski-U-Mah, the Bar &amp; Beer Guide, Sex-U-Mah, and others.

A long-defunct but fondly remembered humor magazine, ''[[Ski-U-Mah (magazine)|Ski-U-Mah]]'', was published from about 1930 to 1950. It launched the career of novelist and scriptwriter [[Max Shulman]].

A relative newcomer to the university's print-media community is ''[[The Wake Student Magazine]]'', a weekly magazine that covers University-related stories and provides a forum for student expression. It was founded in November 2001 in an effort to diversify campus media and achieved student group status in February 2002.&lt;ref name="fund"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sua.umn.edu/groups/funding/fees/requests/studentorgs/thewake.pdf?PHPSESSID=1|title=2008–2009 Student Organization Student Services Fees Request|accessdate=March 12, 2008|date=January 25, 2008}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students from many disciplines do all of the reporting, writing, editing, illustration, photography, layout and business management for the publication. The magazine was founded by James DeLong and Chris Ruen.&lt;ref name="dead"/&gt; ''The Wake'' was named the nation's best campus publication (2006) by the Independent Press Association.&lt;ref name="fund"/&gt;

Additionally, the ''Wake'' publishes ''Liminal'', a literary journal that began in 2005. ''Liminal'' was created in the absence of an undergraduate literary journal and continues to bring poetry and prose to the university community.

''The Wake'' has faced a number of challenges during its existence, due in part to the reliance on student fees funding. In April 2004, the needed $60,000 in funding was restored, which allowed for the magazine's continued existence after the Student Services Fees Committee had initially declined to fund it.&lt;ref name="dead"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2004/04/07/9112 |title=Official Restores Wake's Funding|accessdate=March 12, 2008|date=April 7, 2004|first=Jens |last=Krogstad|work=The Minnesota Daily |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040625230120/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2004/04/07/9112|archivedate=June 25, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; They faced further challenges in 2005 when their request for additional funding to publish weekly was denied&lt;ref name="dead2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2005/02/18/63317|title=Wake Awaits Fees Decision |accessdate=March 12, 2008|date=February 18, 2005|first=Bryce|last=Haugen|newspaper=The Minnesota Daily |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050220004605/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2005/02/18/63317|archivedate=February 20, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then partially restored.&lt;ref name="dead4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2005/03/10/63664|title=Final Recommendations In|accessdate=March 12, 2008|date=March 10, 2005|first=Bryce|last=Haugen|newspaper=The Minnesota Daily|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312130639/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2005/03/10/63664|archivedate=March 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 conservatives on campus began formulating a new monthly magazine named ''The'' ''Minnesota Republic''. The first issue was released in February 2006, and funding by student service fees started in September 2006.

====Radio====
The campus radio station, [[KUOM]] "Radio K", broadcasts an eclectic variety of [[independent music]] during the day on 770 [[kHz]] [[AM radio|AM]]. Its 5,000-watt signal has a range of {{convert|80|mi|km}}, but shuts down at dusk because of [[Federal Communications Commission]] regulations. In 2003, the station added a low-power (8-watt) signal on 106.5&amp;nbsp;MHz [[FM radio|FM]] overnight and on weekends. In 2005, a 10-watt translator began broadcasting from Falcon Heights on 100.7 FM at all times. Radio K also [[Internet radio|stream]]s its content at www.radiok.org. With roots in experimental transmissions that began before World War I, the station received the first AM broadcast license in the state on January 13, 1922, and began broadcasting as [[Radio K|WLB]], changing to the KUOM [[radio call sign|call sign]] about two decades later. The station had an educational format until 1993 when it merged with a smaller campus-only music station to become what is now known as Radio K. A small group of full-time employees are joined by over 20 part-time student employees who oversee the station. Most of the on-air talent consists of student volunteers.

====Television====
Some television programs made on campus have been broadcast on local [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] station [[KTCI]] channel 17. Several episodes of ''Great Conversations'' have been made since 2002, featuring one-on-one discussions between University faculty and experts brought in from around the world. ''Tech Talk'' is a show meant to help people who feel intimidated by modern technology, including cellular phones and computers.

===Minnesota Student Association===
The Minnesota Student Association (MSA) is the undergraduate student government at the University of Minnesota. It advocates for student interests on local, state, and federal levels, and focuses on efforts that directly benefit student population.

"Gopher Chauffeur," originally titled the MSA Express, is a student-operated late-night ride service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/12/13/70274|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103094323/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2006/12/13/70274|title=Hitch a ride with MSA |newspaper= [[Minnesota Daily]]|archivedate=January 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Piloted by MSA, the 2007–2008 administration of Emma Olson and Ross Skattum began the process of transitioning the service to the university's Boynton Health Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mndaily.com/2008/04/17/boyntonto-run-msa-express-0|title=Boynton to run MSA Express|newspaper=[[Minnesota Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done to ensure its longevity. Student response was overwhelmingly positive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wcco.com/search/Link.ashx?R=http%3a%2f%2fwcco.com%2ftopstories%2fMSA.Express.University.2.365282.html|title=Shuttle Service Provides 'U' Students Security|publisher=Wcco.com|date=|accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the program was expanded in recent years due to campus safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discover.umn.edu/news/campus-community/gopher-chauffeur-service-helps-keep-students-safe |title=Taking them home: The U's Gopher Chauffeur service helps keep students safe at night. |date=November 20, 2013 |website=umn.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729013501/http://discover.umn.edu/news/campus-community/gopher-chauffeur-service-helps-keep-students-safe |archivedate=July 29, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSA was instrumental in passing legislation in the 2013 Minnesota legislature for medical amnesty, and has focused more heavily on legislative advocacy in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mndaily.com/lifestyle/alcohol/2013/07/31/under-medical-amnesty-law-underage-drinkers-will-get-new-legal-protecti |title=Under medical amnesty law, underage drinkers will get new legal protections: Underage drinkers will be able to call 911 without fearing a citation. |date=July 31, 2013 |newspaper=[[Minnesota Daily]] |last=Nelson |first=Cody |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727170936/http://www.mndaily.com/lifestyle/alcohol/2013/07/31/under-medical-amnesty-law-underage-drinkers-will-get-new-legal-protecti |archivedate=July 27, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Graduate and Professional Student Assembly====
The Graduate and Professional Student Assembly (GAPSA) is responsible for graduate and professional student governance at the University of Minnesota. It is the largest and most comprehensive graduate/professional student governance organization in the United States. GAPSA serves students in the [[Carlson School of Management]], the Dental School, the Graduate School, the [[University of Minnesota Law School|Law School]], the [[University of Minnesota Medical School|Medical School]], the School of Nursing, the College of Pharmacy, the School of Public Health, the College of Veterinary Medicine, and the [[College of Education and Human Development]]. GAPSA is also a member of the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students.

The University of Minnesota has the second largest number of graduate and professional students in the United States at over 16,000. All registered [[graduate student|graduate]] and [[professional students]] at the University of Minnesota are members of GAPSA. It was established in 1990 as a non-profit (IRS 501 (c)(3)) confederation of independent college councils representing all graduate and professional students at the University of Minnesota to the Board of Regents, the President of the University, the University Senate, the university at large and wider community. GAPSA serves as a resource for member councils, as the primary contact point for administrative units, as a graduate and professional student policy-making and policy-influencing body, and as a center of intercollegiate and intra-collegiate interaction among students.

===Athletics===
Minnesota's athletic teams at the Twin Cities campus are known as the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers]] and compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] as members of the [[Big Ten Conference]]. They have won 20 national championships as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/champs_records_book/Overall.pdf |title=Championships Summary through July 1, 2016 |publisher=NCAA |date=July 1, 2016 |accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Minnesota Golden Gophers}}
The university's intercollegiate sports teams are called the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers|Golden Gophers]] and are members of the [[Big Ten Conference]] and the [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association]] (WCHA) in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA). Since the 2013–14 school year, the only Minnesota team that does not compete in the Big Ten is the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey|women's ice hockey team]], which competes in the WCHA. The Gophers [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey|men's ice hockey team]] was a longtime WCHA member, but left when the Big Ten began operating a [[Big Ten Conference#Men's ice hockey|men's ice hockey league]] with six inaugural members. The current athletic director is Mark Coyle, who took the position from interim athletic director [[Beth Goetz]], after [[Norwood Teague]] resigned in August 2015 amid sexual assault allegations. Teague replaced [[Joel Maturi]].

The Golden Gophers' most notable rivalry is the annual college football game against the [[Wisconsin Badgers]] ([[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], Wisconsin) for [[Paul Bunyan's Axe]], the longest continuous rivalry in [[NCAA]] Division I football. The two universities also compete in the Border Battle, a year-long athletic competition in which each sport season is worth 40 points divided by the number of times the teams play each other (i.e. football is worth 40 points because they play each other only once, while women's ice hockey is worth 10 points per game because they play four times a year). Conference and post-season [[playoffs]] do not count in the point standings.

[[Goldy Gopher]] is the mascot for the Twin Cities campus and the associated sports teams. The [[gopher (animal)|gopher]] mascot is a tradition as old as the state which was tabbed the "Gopher State" in 1857 after a political cartoon ridiculing the US$5-million railroad loan which helped open up the West. The cartoon portrayed shifty railroad barons as striped gophers pulling a railroad car carrying the Territorial Legislature. Later, the university picked up the nickname with the first university [[yearbook]] bearing the name "Gopher Annual" appearing in 1887.

The "[[Minnesota Rouser]]" is the University of Minnesota's [[fight song]]. It is commonly played and sung by the [[University of Minnesota Marching Band|Minnesota Marching Band]], the university's 320-member [[marching band]], at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic games. It is among a number of songs associated with the university, including the [[Minnesota March]], which was composed for the university by [[John Philip Sousa]], and [[Hail! Minnesota]], the university's [[Alma mater (song)|alma mater]] and [[state song]] of Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cla.umn.edu/music/ensembles-creative-work/marching-band/history-traditions/school-songs|title=School Songs|work=College of Liberal Arts {{!}} University of Minnesota|access-date=August 4, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Football====
{{main|Minnesota Golden Gophers football}}
[[File:TCF Bank Stadium opener.jpg|thumb|right|[[TCF Bank Stadium]] replaced the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] as the Gophers' home stadium in 2009.]]
The Minnesota Golden Gophers are one of the oldest programs in college-football history. They have won 7 [[National Championship]]s and 18 [[List of Big Ten National Championships|Big Ten Conference Championships]]. The Golden Gophers played their first game on September 29, 1882, a 4–0 victory over [[Hamline University]], St. Paul. In 1887, the Golden Gophers played host to the Wisconsin Badgers in a 63–0 victory. With the exception of 1906, the Golden Gophers and the Badgers have played each other every year since. The 128 games played against each other is the most-played rivalry in NCAA Division I FBS college football.

In 1981, the Golden Gophers played their last game in [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]]. Between 1982 and 2008, the school hosted their home games in the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] in downtown Minneapolis until they moved back to campus on September 12, 2009, when their new home, [[TCF Bank Stadium]], opened with a game against the [[2009 Air Force Falcons football team|Air Force Falcons]] of the [[United States Air Force Academy|U.S. Air Force Academy]].

====Basketball====
{{main|Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|Minnesota Golden Gophers women's basketball}}
The Golden Gophers men's basketball team has won two [[Helms Athletic Foundation#NCAA Basketball National Champions|National Championships]], two [[National Invitation Tournament]] (NIT) Championships and eight Big Ten Regular Season Championships. They also have six [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]], including a [[Final Four]] appearance in 1997 and three [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet 16]] appearances. However, because of [[University of Minnesota basketball scandal|NCAA sanctions for academic fraud]], all postseason appearances from 1994 to 1998—in the NCAA Tournament in 1994, 1995, and 1997 and NIT in 1996 and 1998—were vacated. Most recently in April 2014, the Golden Gophers defeated SMU to win the NIT championship at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

The [[Golden Gophers]] women's basketball team has enjoyed success in recent years under [[Pam Borton]], including a [[Final Four]] appearance in 2004. Overall, they have six [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearances and three [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet 16]] appearances.

====Men's ice hockey====
{{main|Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey}}
[[File:Mariucci Arena.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mariucci Arena]]]]
Ice hockey is one of the most strongly supported athletic programs at the University of Minnesota, referred to by the university as "Minnesota's Pride on Ice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gophersports.com/prideonice/|title=University of Minnesota Official Athletic Site – University of Minnesota|publisher=|accessdate=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high amount of support is due to the State of Minnesota's high affinity for the sport of ice hockey at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=6287694|title=NCAA men's hockey: Minnesota the capital of hockey nation|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=August 3, 2015|date=2011-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Golden Gophers men's ice-hockey program has won five [[NCAA Men's Ice Hockey Championship#NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Championship|Division I National Championships]] and 13 [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association men's champions|Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) Regular Season Championships]], most recently in 2012. They have won 14 [[Western Collegiate Hockey Association men's champions|WCHA Tournament Championships]] and have 20 NCAA [[Frozen Four]] appearances. A former Golden Gophers hockey tradition was to stock the roster almost exclusively (sometimes completely) with Minnesota natives. Home games are played at Mariucci Arena. The Golden Gophers' big rivals are the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and the [[University of North Dakota]].

====Women's hockey====
{{main||Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey}}
The Golden Gophers women's hockey team has also won six National Championships, most recently in 2016, and six WCHA Regular Season Championships. They have also won four WCHA Tournament Championships and have eleven NCAA Frozen Four appearances. They play their home games in [[Ridder Arena]]. They were the first collegiate women's hockey team to play in an arena dedicated solely to women's ice hockey. In the 2012–2013 season they finished undefeated at 41–0, and are the first and only NCAA Women's Hockey team to do so. After winning the NCAA tournament their winning streak stood at 49 games, dating back to February 17, 2012 when they lost to North Dakota.

==== Women's Rugby ====
The Golden Gophers Women's Rugby club team won the Midwest conference championships in 2015, 2016 and 2017.
