      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2889">'''Alfred Edments''' (17 October 1853 – 13 July 1909) was a merchant and [[philanthropist]] in [[Australia]].

==Early life and education==
Edments was born in [[London]], the son of James Edments, a labourer, and his wife Ann, ''née'' Lyons.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080437b.htm |title=Edments, Alfred (1853 - 1909) |accessdate=2008-10-09 |author=Neilma Sidney |work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]], Volume 8 |publisher=[[Melbourne University Press|MUP]] |year=1981 |pages=412–413}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had only a primary education and at an early age began to work for a firm of cork merchants.

==Career==
He left for [[Australia]] at the age of 19 and arrived at [[Sydney]]. He obtained a position, saved a little money, began working as a peddler in a small way, and then opened a shop in Sydney where he sold goods by auction. Edments went to [[Melbourne]] in 1888 and started an auction room in [[Bourke Street, Melbourne]]. He also for a short period was a [[bookmaker]], attending only the principal meetings, but found this did not suit his health and soon gave it up. He also gave up having auctions and opened a shop selling watches, clocks and fancy goods, which steadily prospered. He visited England in 1892 to arrange for direct buying, and after trying various locations, finally settled his place of business at 309-311 Bourke Street, Melbourne,&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; in 1895.

The business grew and Edments began to open branches in the suburbs and in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]].  He kept a close watch on every detail, thoroughly trained his staff, and treated them with great consideration.

==Employee management==
Every employee had a fortnight's holiday on full pay, and when ill, Edments continued to pay their salaries and often their medical fees.

==Legacy==
He himself worked very hard and his health began to cause anxiety when he was only in his early forties. He paid frequent visits to England and in 1898 opened a London office. For the last six months of his life he was compelled to manage his business from his home. Edments died at Melbourne on 13 July 1909 of heart disease.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; He married but had no children. At his death left a large proportion of his considerable fortune to charity via the Alfred Edments Trust.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt; This in 1940 amounted to about £150,000 and about £6000 is distributed every year. The rest of his fortune was left to his niece E Dench who had no children and left her fortune at her death to [[Ewen Middlemiss]] estimated at the time to be $20 million.

'''American Publishers Association''' (APA) was created in 1901 to maintain the price of copyright books in the American market.

In 1913, the New York Supreme court ruled in favor of R. H [[Macy's]] &amp; Co. vs American Publishers Association, saying Macy's was entitled to damages of $140,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sequence 14788     (Page 345):     Harvard University.

'''Business.gov'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.gov/index.html Business.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; is sponsored by the U.S. Small Business Administration to provide small business owners with access to federal, state and local government resources from a single access point. 

==History==
Business.gov was launched in 1997 as the U.S. Business Advisor by the [[National Technical Information Service]] of the [[United States Department of Commerce]].  The U.S. Business Advisor aimed to improve interaction between businesses and government agencies by providing a single resource for finding tools, how-to guides, frequently asked questions, current items of interest, and information on doing transactions with the federal government.

Business.gov was re-launched in May 2004 as a Presidential E-Government Initiative&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/omb/egov/c-presidential.html Georgebush-whitehouse.archives.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  SBA assumed management oversight of Business.gov in partnership with 21 other federal agencies.  This partnership, known as the Business Gateway, established Business.gov as the single access point to government services that help the nation’s businesses with their operations. The content of the site was primarily aimed at starting, growing, and managing a small business, with an emphasis on government assistance programs and services available from SBA and other federal agencies.

Business Gateway officially re-launched Business.gov on October 12, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business.gov/press/releases/20061012.doc Business.gov Helps Businesses Meet Federal Compliance Requirements]. News Release,  October 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; as a web portal targeted at helping small and medium-sized businesses find, understand and comply with government regulations.  The website has since evolved to provide guidance and resources for all aspects of starting and running a business.

The Business.gov Community&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.business.gov/bsng/ Community.business.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; launched&lt;ref&gt;[http://sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/news_release_09-18.pdf SBA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; in March, 2009 as an interactive extension of the website, creating a forum for business owners to interact with government, industry experts and each other through discussion boards, idea exchanges and blog articles.

== Reducing regulatory burden for small businesses ==
Business.gov provides a platform for online services—feature articles, interactive tools and a specialized, Google-based search engine—that help small businesses reduce significant regulatory burdens.

All businesses, large or small, are subject to legal and regulatory burdens.  Small businesses face the greatest burden of all. Research conducted and documented by the U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sba.gov/advo/stats/sbfaq.pdf U.S. Small Business Administration, Office of Advocacy, FAQ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202170306/http://www.sba.gov/advo/stats/sbfaq.pdf |date=December 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed the following:
  
*Very small firms with fewer than 20 employees spend 45% more per employee than larger firms to comply with federal regulations.
*These very small firms spend 4.5 times as much per employee to comply with environmental regulations and 67% more per employee on tax compliance than their larger counterparts.
*Businesses with fewer than 20 employees spend an average of $7,647 per employee to stay in compliance vs. an average of $5,282 for firms with 500+ employees. 
*Firms with fewer than 500 employees represent 99.7% of the 29.6 million businesses in the U.S.; the most recent data show there are only 18,000 large businesses.
*Small businesses generated 64% of net new jobs annually over the past 15 years.
*Small businesses must also comply with labor and safety regulations.

== Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002 ==
The Small Business Paperwork Relief Act (SBPRA) of 2002 requires federal agencies to designate one point of contact to act as a liaison between the agency and small business concerns. SBPRA also requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in conjunction with the Small Business Administration, to publish on the Internet a list of compliance assistance resources available at Federal agencies for small businesses. In accordance with the SBPRA, Business.gov has published a Federal Compliance Contacts&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business.gov/contacts/federal/ Business.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; page which gives the names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses of individuals at federal agencies that can help small business answer regulatory and legal questions.  Business.gov also provides guidance through links to federal, state and local agency resources that help small businesses meet their regulatory requirements.

==Features and services==

==Model for government-to-business websites==
Business.gov served as a model for other government websites by fulfilling the goals of President George W. Bush's 2001 [[President's Management Agenda]]. The site continues to deliver on the current Administration’s Open Government Initiative&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/Open/# |title=Whitehouse.gov |access-date=2009-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203223805/http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/# |archive-date=2009-12-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; under President [[Barack Obama]] and is showcased on the White House Open Government Innovations Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/innovations Whitehouse.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chief analytics officer''' ('''CAO''') is a job title for the senior manager responsible for the analysis of data within an organization, such as a listed company or an educational institution. The CAO often reports to the [[chief executive officer]].

Not many companies currently have the role of Chief Analytics Officer (CAO) defined within their existing c-suite. However this is a fast emerging position that would be pivotal in massive transformation - in the way companies take their business decisions. CAOs not only bring strong data science backed actionable insights to the table, but also own the resulting 'ROI'/'Impact' on both top line and bottom line numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-a-o.net/about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109234330/http://www.c-a-o.net/about.html |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This position, along with that of [[chief information officer]] has risen to prominence due to the rise in [[information technology]] and [[data acquisition]]. The two positions are similar in that both deal with information, but the CIO focuses on the infrastructure required for maintaining and communicating information while the CAO focuses on the infrastructure required for generating and analyzing information. A similar position is that of the [[chief data officer]] (CDO); while the CDO focuses on data processing and maintenance, the CAO focuses on providing input into operational decisions on the basis of the analysis. As such, the CAO requires experience in [[statistical analysis]] and [[marketing]], [[finance]], or [[Business operations|operations]]. The CAO may be a member of the [[board of directors]] of the organization, but this is dependent on the type of organization.

No specific qualification is typical of CAOs in general. Many have advanced degrees in [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[economics]], or [[econometrics]] but this is by no means universal. Many were analysts in the past.

'''Changing role of the Chief Data Officer and growth in the Chief Analytics Office'''

Research* indicates that First Generation CDOs are typically responsible for the following:

* Assessing the state of the company's data which, more often than not, is in some state of disrepair
* Developing a data warehouse that acts as a central repository for all of the company's data
* Defining the data governance, management and ownership frameworks that will ensure data quality is created and maintained
* Working with business to understand data requirements and then how to provide them with this data - whilst maintaining control (see point above)
* Assisting in developing reporting tools through BI, visualisation tools, etc.
* Ensuring compliance to data or sector-specific regulations - this is mostly true in the financial services sector where most companies employ a CDO to make sure that they're compliant to regulations

In addition to these key responsibilities, the First Generation CDO is concerned with communicating his/her value to the organisation, evangelising the importance of data and building business processes to ensure efficient workflows.

These are all the critical, foundation-building baby steps that need to be taken before moving into the next phase or generation of CDO-ship. The CDO is producing step-changes within the organisation's data architecture and usage. Change is big but perhaps does not deliver significant business value.

'''Second Generation CDOs and the shift into a CAO'''

Our research has uncovered that, in the second phase, there is almost a shift away from being a CDO toward being a Chief Analytics Officer. The ultimate end goal for data in an organisation is to have the ability to use it to make good decisions in real time.

It's based on this that I assess the Second Generation CDO as being increasingly responsible for, and involved with, advanced business analytics. The first phase was all about getting data in shape for it to be utilised accurately across the business.

It's at this point where the CDO is involved in the optimisation and transformation of the business. 
 Our research has uncovered that, in the second phase, there is almost a shift away from being a CDO toward being a Chief Analytics Officer. The ultimate end goal for data in an organisation is to have the ability to use it to make good decisions in real time.
Innovation through data!

The Second Generation CDO becomes an integral part of eking out the hard-fought percentages of business improvement and profitability. Innovation across the organisation has come to rely on data. Product innovation takes a look at how the product is performing, who buys it, how it is manufactured etc. to evolve it and keep its competitive edge. None of this could be done without access to good quality data in real time - or at least in a short space of time.

A recent study shows an increasing number of CDO's at the forefront of their company's digital transformation, most likely because data and analytics play such a critical role in digitising a business, and so as a result many Chief Data Officers have moved in Chief Digital Officer roles.

'''What does the Future Look Like?'''

It's not easy to predict what the next generation will look like and how they'll act. I don't think Facebook anticipated that the current youngest generation would not be big users of the service.

Data Digest points that out by the development of the CDO - and for that matter the CAO and the Chief Digital Officer. Could they all blend into one? Or will they be obsolete in a few years and replaced with a new emerging C-suite?

For now, we'll keep focused on understanding the different needs of the First Generation and Second Generation of CDOs to ensure we can provide relevant information and networks. It is likely that the next generation will only emerge in 4–5 years time.

Since about 1970, several major business and government excesses were seen in the [[United States]] to generate  subsequent legal, public and political reaction.  The [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] is perhaps the legislation with the most significant influence in the development of ethics and compliance programs; similar ideas are encoded in the [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission|Committee of Sponsoring Organizations]], and the [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]].

==Foreign Corrupt Practices Act==

The [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] (FCPA) marked the early beginnings of compliance programs in the United States. In the mid-1970s, [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) investigations discovered that a significant number of American companies participated in bribery overseas. “Over 400 U.S. Companies admitted to making questionable or illegal payments to foreign government officials, politicians and political parties.” (United States Department of Justice 2006) One of the most infamous cases of its time was the admission by a Lockheed executive, to the Multinational Corporations Subcommittee of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], that [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] had paid bribes in the amount of $22 million to Japanese government officials in the course of trying to sell its aircraft. This revelation came on the heels of the U.S. Government providing Lockheed with a $250 million emergency loan guarantee (Hishikawa 2003).

In an effort to restore faith in American business, in December 1977 the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act was signed into law. This anti-bribery provision makes it “unlawful for a U.S. person, and certain foreign issuers of securities, to make a corrupt payment to a [[foreign official]] for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business for or with, or directing business to, any person.” ([[United States Department of Justice]] 2006) The law also requires publicly traded companies “to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent the company’s transactions. Additionally, it requires these companies to have an adequate systems of internal accounting controls.” (United States Department of Justice 2006)

Following the passage of the FCPA, in 1988, the Congress became concerned that American companies were operating at a disadvantage because their foreign counterparts were, as a matter of practice, paying bribes to foreign officials and deducting those bribes as business expenses on their taxes. (United States Department of Justice 2006) Subsequently, the [[Executive Branch]] began negotiations with the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), a 34-member nation coalition consisting of the United States and 33 other countries, to enact legislation similar to FCPA. In 1997, the OCED signed the Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions. (http://www.oecd.org/document/21/0,2340,en_2649_34859_2017813_1_1_1_1,00.html)

This regulation requires member nations to designate the payment of bribes to foreign offices as a crime and to follow the rules and regulations that govern bribery in international transactions. The U.S. ratified this convention and enacted implementing legislation in 1998. At this time, the FCPA was amended to include territorial jurisdiction over foreign companies and nationals. A foreign company or person is now subject to the FCPA, if the company or person either directly or indirectly through agents, engages in acts which further the facilitation of corrupt payments taking place within the territory of the United States.

== Committee of Sponsoring Organizations ==

In response to the FCPA and its requirement to implement internal control programs, in 1985 a private-sector initiative was formed called the National Committee on Fraudulent Financial Reporting (commonly known as the Treadway Commission). This Commission recommended that its organizational sponsors work together to develop guidance on internal controls. Subsequently, the [[Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission]] (COSO) was formed, and in conjunction with the CPA firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand, COSO authored and published in 1992 the “Internal Control-Integrated Framework". This framework has become the de facto standard in the accounting industry for auditing, evaluating and monitoring internal control systems.

The COSO Internal Control-Integrated Framework is now widely used by most organizations as the basis for “establishing and maintaining an adequate internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting” ( 15 USC § 7262) and for the assessment of control effectiveness under section 404 of [[Sarbanes-Oxley]].

== United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations ==

In 1984 Congress passed the [[Sentencing Reform Act]], which created a set of mandatory federal sentencing guidelines (Campbell &amp; Bemporad 2006). As part of the Act, the [[United States Sentencing Commission]] was formed and delegated the responsibility “to provide “certainty” and “fairness” in sentencing, avoiding “unwarranted sentencing disparities” while “maintaining sufficient flexibility to permit individualized sentencing when warranted by [[mitigating factor|mitigating]] or aggravating factors (Campbell &amp; Bemporad 2006).”

On May 1, 1991, as an extension of the Sentencing Reform Act, the United States Sentencing Commission submitted to Congress the Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Organizations] (FSGO), a set of standards that govern the sentences federal judges impose on organizations convicted of federal crimes. Enacted on November 1, 1991, core to the guidelines was the Commission’s intent to “prevent and deter organizational wrongdoing” through its design of the organizational sentencing guidelines. These guidelines describe the elements of an organization’s compliance and ethics program that are required to be considered for eligibility for a reduced sentence if convicted. In general, the FSGO require an organization to establish standards to guide its employees and agents. These standards must reflect government regulations and industry standards and apply to almost all types of organizations including corporations, partnerships, unions, non-profit organizations and trusts.

In 2004, the United States Sentencing Commission voted to amend its existing organization guidelines to make the criteria for an effective compliance and ethics program more stringent. Two major standards were identified in the amended guidelines. The amended guidelines stated the need for directors and executives to take an active role in the management of its compliance and ethics program and the importance of promoting an [[organizational culture]] that is compliant with the law and demonstrates ethical culture. The amended guidelines outline minimum requirements for an effective compliance and ethics program and the amended FSGO has become synonymous with an effective compliance program.

The FCPA, [[Sarbanes-Oxley]] (SOX) and the Federal Sentencing Guidelines represent just a fraction of the standards and requirements organizations need to consider today when developing and implementing their compliance programs. “Since the passage of SOX, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE), [[NASDAQ]], and the [[Public Company Accounting Oversight Board]] (PCAOB), have all proposed and implemented new rules relating to compliance programs (Martin 2004).” Organizations today are increasingly accountable to mandated laws, regulations and standards on a number of dimensions, which include geographical/regional considerations, as well as industry and functional discipline concerns. These regulations and standards apply to a variety of financial and non-financial areas. Adding to this complexity are the “voluntary” boundaries, which organizations have individually established such as organizational commitments, values, and contractual obligations. As a result of these dynamics, organizations at the very core of their business strategy need to establish the capacity and the capability to effectively address the conditions mandated by these external requirements and internally generated operating principles while still meeting their business objectives.

History set the tone for increasing regulations and rising standards. Over time, organizations will need to be more proactive in anticipating and addressing these considerations while simultaneously protecting and building the enterprise. More and more organizations will need to translate, integrate and simplify these various standards and requirements into a cohesive approach.

== Designing an effective compliance and ethics program ==

Designing an effective '''compliance''' and '''ethics program''' requires implementing a detailed plan that will make sure the business achieves their ethics objectives. The organization must have ways of managing, evaluating, and controlling business ethics and compliance programs. There are five items which can affect the success of the compliance and ethics program: (1) the content of the company's code of ethics, (2) the frequency of communication regarding the ethical code and program, (3) the quality of communication, (4) senior management's ability to successfully incorporate ethics into the organization, (5) and local management's ability to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Ethics|last=Ferrell, Fraedrich, Ferrell|first=O.C., John, Linda|publisher=Erin Joyner|year=2013|isbn=978-1-111-82516-4|location=|pages=241|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Compliance''' and '''ethics program''' with regulatory requirements and the organization’s own policies are a critical component of effective risk management. An organizations program is recommended to include monitoring and auditing systems that allow detection of criminal and other improper context to be found easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acc.com/legalresources/quickcounsel/eaecp.cfm|title=Establishing an Effective Compliance Program: An Overview to Protecting Your Organization|website=www.acc.com|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining the compliance and ethics program is one of the most important ways for an organization to maintain its ethical health, support its long-term prosperity, and preserve and promote its values.

A '''compliance''' and '''ethics program''' supports the organization’s business objectives, identifies the boundaries of legal and ethical behavior, and establishes a system to alert management when the organization is getting close to (or crossing) a boundary or approaching an obstacle that prevents the achievement of a business objective.

Management should continuously improve its '''compliance''' and '''ethics program'''. This will enable it to better prevent, detect, and respond to similar misfeasance and/or malfeasance in the future.

The '''compliance''' and '''ethics program''' should strive to deliver tangible benefits and outcomes to the organization. Every organization is unique and has its own objectives. As such, several objectives of the compliance and ethics program will be unique as well. There are a few universal program outcomes/objectives that a compliance and ethics capability should deliver. These include an enhanced culture of trust, accountability and integrity; prevention of noncompliance, preparation for when (not “if”) noncompliance occurs, protection (to the extent possible) from negative consequences, detection of noncompliance, response to noncompliance and improvement of the program to better prevent, protect, prepare, detect and respond to noncompliance.

An important aspect of a high-performing program, and one that cannot be overstated, is enhancing an '''ethical culture'''. A strong ethical culture that provides important benefits would including a “safety net” for when formal controls are weak or absent, and an open environment of trust, ingredients that help drive overall workforce productivity.

A well-designed compliance and ethics program is only half the picture. Critical to its success and its ability to meet the challenges of constant change, increasing complexity, rapidly evolving threats, the need for continuous improvement requires organizations to have the commitment of both senior management and the board, adequate authorization and funding, the appropriate tools to facilitate measurement and rolling-up information, comprehensive training on the measurement process and an early socialization of approach.

== Effective program implementation ==

Implementation is often the most difficult aspect of any program. This is the juncture where most failure occurs. However, if executed well, it can represent the biggest opportunity for positive influence on the organization’s performance and culture.

The engaged involvement of key stakeholders is critical to a successful implementation or major enhancement of a compliance and ethics program, i.e. the dialogue and agreement up front, by all the major parties, regarding the objectives, goals, and overall purpose of the program will be critical to the project’s eventual impact. By working together, compliance and ethics officers, executive management, and the board can help ensure a compliance and ethics program not only contributes to the improvement of the organization’s governance practices but the success of its company’s strategy as well.

One of most important conditions for an ethics program to be effectively implemented is the existence of a feeling of trust from the employees toward the organization. Organizations that present high levels of misconduct will experience lack of trust from its employees, which possible will cause high turnover among its workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferrell|first1=O.C.|last2=Fraedrich|first2=John|last3=Ferrell|first3=Linda|title=BUSINESS ETHICS Ethical Decision Making and Cases|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-305-50084-6|pages=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Integrate compliance and ethics - Address the “letter of the law” while promoting the “spirit of the law”. For some companies this means making a breach of company policy as serious as breaching laws, resulting in “internal” standards being as important as ‘mandatory’ standards.

Embed compliance and ethics risk management processes into the business - Organizations must systematically assess and prioritize present and emerging compliance and ethics risks. Such analysis should take into account the organization’s culture, compliance and ethics history, as well as industry issues. Business processes should incorporate compliance and ethics program needs. Boards should routinely discuss these risks, and how they are addressed, with management.

Demonstrate leadership - The board should ensure senior management consistently communicates and models the organization’s values and behavioral expectations identified in the compliance and ethics program.

Require accountability and ownership - In order to have the compliance and ethics program “make a difference”, it should foster a corporate culture that places responsibility on individuals for their actions and motivates everyone. The board and management should ensure employees have appropriate training and information and should participate in such training themselves.

Provide an open culture - Issues and problems should be, and in some cases are, required by law to be investigated and proactively managed to resolution. Unethical or illegal behavior should be addressed promptly. Employees must be required to raise and resolve violations of compliance or ethics standards. To do so, they must feel confident that they can take action without fear of retaliation. Such fears have been reduced, but not eliminated, with the introduction of the “[[whistleblower]]” protections of the [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] and the Canadian equivalents. The board should inquire of management the steps they are taking to create this open culture.

Measure performance and results - Compliance and ethics processes and results should be monitored and measured. Objective data should support evaluations that are more subjective. Evaluation results should provide the basis for continually improving the program.

== Measuring program performance ==

By using accurate, timely data on the organization’s performance, managers know whether they are moving the entity closer to its objectives. Measuring compliance and ethics program performance help organizations gauge their improvement and learn whether the company's tactics are contributing to the success of the company's strategy. Keeping the board informed is a critical activity and robust performance reporting facilitates that important effort too. An organization’s compliance and ethics program should be measured like any other critical capability.

There are numerous benefits and challenges to measuring the performance of a program.  A well-known maxim is "what gets measured gets done.” The compliance and ethics program and capability is no different.

The Open Compliance and Ethics Group, [http://www.oceg.org OCEG]&lt;small&gt;TM&lt;/small&gt;, a non-profit organization that provides a performance framework for integrating governance, compliance, risk management and culture, has developed a Measurement and Metrics Guide (MMG) for assisting in measuring and reporting on the performance of compliance and ethics programs. This measurement platform advocates that program objectives be aligned with and contribute to the enterprise objectives in a tangible way.  In order to achieve desired program outcomes, an organization should design processes and practices that effectively measure program dimensions on three key dimensions: effectiveness, efficiency and responsiveness.

=== Effectiveness describes the quality of a program along two dimensions: design effectiveness and operational effectiveness. ===

* Design effectiveness describes the degree to which a system or process is logically designed to meet legal and other defined requirements. Does the system or process contain all the necessary elements to thoroughly evaluate risk? Has it been designed for maximum effectiveness? If not, what features must be added to improve the system? Design effectiveness is very much a logical test that considers all requirements, risks and boundaries and determines if the system is appropriately designed.
* Operational effectiveness describes the degree to which a system or process operates as designed.  If the system has been well designed, does it function correctly? Does it operate the way it was designed? If not, how must it be managed to elevate its level of operation? Operational effectiveness helps management understand if, given a strong design, the system is operating as it is intended.

=== The concept of efficiency captures the cost of the process or system – not simply financial efficiency, the amount of money spent but also the cost of human capital expended. ===

* Financial efficiency describes the total amount of financial capital required to execute a process.
* Human capital efficiency describes the type and level of individual(s) required to participate in the process. While human capital costs can be partially captured in purely financial terms, intangible [[opportunity cost]]s must also be captured. In other words, if the program relies too heavily on senior executive time and focus, it may represent more than just purely financial costs (salary, benefits, and other overhead). An organization must also recognize the intangible costs of the loss of executive time and focus on other strategic objectives such as growth, profitability, talent retention, and customer loyalty.

=== Responsiveness should be looked at on two dimensions — the system's ability to operate quickly and flexibly in response to changing circumstances. ===

* Cycle time describes the amount of total hours and/or total duration that it takes to execute a process. 
* Flexibility/adaptability describes the degree to which the system can integrate changes including new requirements (e.g. a new law, rule or regulation) and/or new business units (due to merger and acquisition activity.) These changes may be internal; as managers study the results of past performance evaluations and make needed alterations. Or they may be external. New regulatory environments, changing market conditions, or altered public perceptions and concerns require the organization to make adjustments. A responsive system adapts quickly to changes in the environment. It also develops a long-range perspective, foreseeing more distant changes and preparing for them.
A solid measurement system and approach should be implemented that embodies these principles: 
* Focused on Business Objectives, 
* Outcome-Oriented and a 
* Simple Measurement System.
Key metrics and indicators should be specific/simple, measurable, actionable, relevant and timely.
* Balance of Leading and Lagging - Lagging indicators show how the company has already done (revenue growth in the past quarter; number of workplace accidents in the last year). Leading indicators are those that may predict future performance. Examples are on-time delivery rate, which can lead to higher customer satisfaction ratings and, in turn, more sales to existing customers.
* Indicators should provide visibility into both short-term and long-term objectives. Overemphasis on short-term objectives can stifle a company's long-term growth, by short-changing new product development. Emphasis on short-term financial results, such as quarterly profits, can lead to reduction in spending on research for new product development, or purchasing cheaper components to raise profit margins, leading to lower product quality, more product returns, complaints from customers, and loss of business.
* Focus on Internal Trends before External Benchmarks - Program metrics and measurement should help management understand internal trends. Once internal trends are understood, the use of external benchmarks will be more meaningful.

Performance measurement system should be reviewed and improved on an ongoing basis. It is only by gaining experience measuring performance that the organization can really refine and improve the system.

== Future outlook for ethics and compliance programs ==

Compliance risk is the current and prospective risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of, or nonconformance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, internal policies, and procedures, or ethical standards.  Compliance risk also arises in situations where the laws or rules governing certain bank products or activities of the Bank’s clients may be ambiguous or untested.  This risk exposes the institution to fines, civil money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts.  Compliance risk can lead to diminished reputation, reduced franchise value, limited business opportunities, reduced expansion potential, and an inability to enforce contracts.

[[Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance]] (GRC) management capability is the solution to addressing increasing stakeholder expectations. Solid financial results are no longer sufficient. Stakeholders are demanding more. They want to know about non-financial results and the intangibles that will ensure financial growth. They want increased reporting and transparency and insight into an organization’s strategy, risks, and operations along with an understanding of the manner in which business is conducted. As with the quality movement of the mid-1980s to early 1990s, these stakeholder demands are becoming baseline expectations.

Compliance and ethics practices can no longer be viewed in isolation of the rest of the organization, as some function off to the side to keep an organization out of jail. It must become part of the overall business strategy and operations, pervasive throughout the entire organization. Ultimately, taking this integrated approach will lead to better overall performance and compliance will become less of a burden on the business.

'''Corvée''' ({{IPA-fr|kɔʁve|lang|Fr-corvée.ogg}}) is a form of unpaid, [[unfree labour]], which is intermittent in nature and which lasts limited periods of time: typically only a certain number of days' work each year.

'''Statute labour''' is a corvée imposed by a [[state (polity)|state]] for the purposes of [[public works]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/564272/statute-labour&lt;/ref&gt; As such it represents a form of levy ([[taxation]]). Unlike other forms of levy, such as a [[tithe]], a corvée does not require the population to have land, crops or cash. It was thus favored in historical economies in which [[barter]] was more common than cash transactions or circulating money was in short supply.

The obligation for tenant farmers to perform corvée work for landlords on private [[landed estate]]s was widespread throughout history before the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The term is most typically used in reference to [[Medieval Europe|medieval]] and [[early modern Europe]], where work was often expected by a feudal landowner (of their vassals), or by a monarch of their subjects. However, the application of the term is not limited to that time or place; corvée has existed in modern and ancient Egypt, ancient Israel under Solomon,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biblestudytools.com/encyclopedias/isbe/solomon.html&lt;/ref&gt; ancient Rome, China and Japan, everywhere in continental Europe, the [[Incan]] civilization, [[Haiti]] under [[Henri Christophe]] and under [[United States occupation of Haiti|American occupation]] (1915&amp;ndash;1934), and [[Chibalo|Portugal's African colonies]] until the mid-1960s. Forms of statute labour officially existed until the early twentieth century in Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1541-0064.1999.tb01359.x | volume=43 | title=STATUTE LABOUR ON ONTARIO TOWNSHIP ROADS, 1849–1948: RESPONDING TO A CHANGING SPACE ECONOMY | journal=The Canadian Geographer/Le Géographe canadien | pages=36–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legaltree.ca/node/795|title=Statute Labour Act could mean that some Ontario taxpayers must perform road work|publisher=Legal Tree|language=English|author=Bob Aaron|date=8 December 2007|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "corvée" itself has its origins in Rome, and reached the English language via France. In the Late Roman Empire the citizens performed [[opera publica]] in lieu of paying taxes; often it consisted of road and bridge work. Roman landlords could also demand a number of days' labour from their tenants, and also from the [[freedmen]]; in the latter case the work was called ''opera officialis''. In Medieval Europe, the tasks that [[serf]]s or [[villein]]s were required to perform on a yearly basis for their lords were called ''opera riga''. Plowing and harvesting were principal activities to which this work was applied. In times of need, the lord could demand additional work called ''opera corrogata'' (Latin ''corrogare'', "to requisition"). This term evolved into ''coroatae'', then ''corveiae'', and finally ''corvée'', and the meaning broadened to encompass both the regular and exceptional tasks. This Medieval agricultural corvée was not entirely unpaid: by custom the workers could expect small payments, often in the form of food and drink consumed on the spot. Corvée sometimes included military conscription, and the term is also occasionally used in a slightly divergent sense to mean forced requisition of military supplies; this most often took the form of ''cartage'', a lord's right to demand wagons for military transport.

Because corvée labour for agriculture tended to be demanded by the lord at exactly the same times that the peasants needed to attend to their own plots &amp;ndash; e.g. planting and harvest &amp;ndash; the corvée was an object of serious resentment. By the 16th century its use in agricultural setting was on the wane; it became increasingly replaced by money payments for labour. It nevertheless persisted in many areas of Europe until the French Revolution and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;In the Austro-Hungarian Empire, serfdom, along with heavy forms of corvée were abolished only in 1848. Robert A. Kann, '' A history of the Habsburg Empire, 1526–1918'', University of California Press, 1974, pp. 303–304.&lt;/ref&gt; The word survives in modern usage, meaning any kind of "inevitable or disagreeable chore".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mould |first=Michael |title=The Routledge Dictionary of Cultural References in Modern French |year=2011 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location=New York |isbn=978-1-136-82573-6 |page=147 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x-FNTmUwfpEC&amp;pg=PA147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Austria, Holy Roman Empire, and Germany===
Corvée labour was essential in the feudal economic system of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] – later [[Austrian Empire]] – and most German states that have belonged to the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Farmers and peasants were obliged to do hard agricultural work for their nobility. When a cash economy became established, the duty was gradually replaced by the duty to pay taxes.

After the [[Thirty Years' War]], the demands for corvée labour grew too high and the system became dysfunctional. The official decline of corvée is linked to the abolition of [[serfdom]] by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] and Habsburg ruler, in 1781. Corvée labour continued to exist, however, and was only abolished during the [[revolutions of 1848]], along with the legal inequality between the nobility and common people.

Bohemia (or Czech lands) were a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] as well as the Habsburg monarchy and corvée labour itself was called "robota" in Czech. In Russian and other Slavic languages, "robota" denotes any work but in Czech, it specifically refers to unpaid unfree work, corvée labour, serf labor, or drudgery. The Czech word was imported to a part of Germany where corvée labour was known as Robath, and into Hungarian as ''robot''.

The word "robota" turned out to be optimal for Czech writer [[Karel Čapek]] who, after a recommendation by his brother [[Josef Čapek]], introduced the word "[[robot]]" for (originally anthropomorphic) machines that do unpaid work for their owners in his 1920 play [[R.U.R.]].

===Egypt===
[[File:Wells egyptian peasants taxes.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Egyptian peasants seized for [[tax noncompliance|non-payment of taxes]] during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Pyramid Age]].]]
From the [[Ancient Egyptian|Egyptian]] [[Old Kingdom]] (ca 2613 BC) onward, (the [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|4th Dynasty]]), corvée labour helped in 'government' projects; during the times of the [[Nile River]] floods, labour was used for construction projects such as [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids]], temples, quarries, canals, roads, and other works.

The 1350 BC [[Amarna letters]] [[Text corpus|correspondence]], (mostly addressed to the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian [[pharaoh]]), has one short letter, with the topic of corvée labour. Of the 382&amp;ndash;Amarna letters, it is an example of an undamaged letter, from [[Biridiya]] of [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]], entitled: ''"Furnishing corvée workers".'' See: city [[Nuribta]].

In later Egyptian times, during the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], [[Ptolemy V]], in his [[Rosetta Stone|Rosetta Stone Decree]] of 196 BC, listed 22 accomplishments for being honored and the ten rewards granted to him for his accomplishments. The last reward listed is his making of the [[Rosetta Stone]], (the [[Decree of Memphis (Ptolemy V)]]), in three scripts, to be displayed to the public in the temples-(two near complete copies).

One of the shorter accomplishments listed near the middle of the list,

{{quote|He (pharaoh) decreed:&amp;mdash;Behold, not is permitted to be pressed men of the sailors.&lt;ref&gt;Budge.  ''The Rosetta Stone'', pp. 138–139.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The statement implies it was a common practice.

Until the late 19th century, many of the [[Egyptian Public Works]] including the [[Suez Canal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Karabell|first=Zachary|title=Parting the Desert, the creation of the Suez Canal|year=2003|publisher=Alfred Knopf|isbn=0375408835|pages=113, 169–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; were built using corvée labour.

Corvée labor in Egypt ended after 1882.  Britain took control of Egypt in 1882 and opposed opposed forced labor on principle,  but they postponed abolition until Egypt had paid off its foreign debts.  It disappeared as Egypt modernised after 1860. During the 19th century the corvée had expanded into a national program. It was favoured for temporary projects such as building irrigation works and dams. However Nile Delta landowners replaced it with cheap temporary labor recruited from Upper Egypt. As a result, the corvée was used only in scattered locales, and even then there was peasant resistance. It disappeared by the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan J. Brown, "Who abolished corvée labour in Egypt and why?." ''Past &amp; Present'' 144 (1994): 116-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In France the corvée existed until August 4, 1789, shortly after the beginning of the [[French Revolution]], when it was abolished along with a number of other feudal privileges of the French landlords. In these later times it was directed mainly towards improving the roads. It was greatly resented, and is considered an important cause of the Revolution. Counterrevolution revived the corvée in France, in 1824, 1836, and 1871, under the name ''prestation''; every able bodied man had to give three days' labour or its money equivalent in order to be allowed to vote. The corvée also continued to exist  under the [[Seigneurial system of New France|Seigneurial system]] in what had been [[New France]], in [[British North America]].
In 1866, during the French occupation of [[Mexico]] the French army under Marshal [[Bazaine]] set up the corvée to provide labor for public works in place of a system of fines.&lt;ref&gt;Jack A. Dabbs.  ''The French Army in Mexico 1861–1867'', p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haiti===
The independent Kingdom of Haiti based at [[Cap-Haïtien]] under [[Henri Christophe]] imposed a corvée system of labor upon the common citizenry which was used for massive fortifications to protect against a French invasion. Plantation owners could pay the government and have laborers work for them instead. This enabled the Kingdom of Haiti to maintain a stronger economic structure than the Republic of Haiti based in [[Port-au-Prince]] in the South under [[Alexandre Pétion]] which had a system of agrarian reform distributing land to the laborers.

After [[United States occupation of Haiti|deploying to Haiti]] in 1915 as an expression of the [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], the United States military enforced a corvée system of labor in the interest of making improvements to infrastructure.&lt;ref name = "UOH"&gt;Paul Farmer, ''The Uses of Haiti'' (Common Courage Press: 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; By official estimates, more than 3,000 Haitians died during this period.

===Imperial China===
Imperial China had a system of conscripting labour from the public, equated to the western corvée by many historians. [[Qin Shi Huang]], the first emperor, and following dynasties imposed it for public works like the [[Great Wall]], the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]], and the system of national roads and highways.

However, as the imposition was exorbitant and punishment for failure draconian, Qin Shi Huang was resented by the people and criticized by many historians.

===Japan===

Corvée-style labour called {{nihongo|yō|[[:ja:租庸調|庸]]}} was found in pre-modern Japan.  During the 1930s, it was common practice to import Corvée labourers from both [[China]] and [[Korea]] to work in coal mines.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J Samuels. ''Machiavelli's Children'' (Cornell University Press 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; This practice continued until the end of [[World War II]].

===Madagascar===
France annexed [[Madagascar]] as a [[French colonial empire|colony]] in the late 19th century. [[Joseph Gallieni|Governor-General Gallieni]] then implemented a hybrid corvée and [[Tax per head|poll tax]], partly for revenue, partly for labour resources (the French had just [[Abolition of slavery timeline|abolished slavery]] there), and partly to move away from a [[subsistence economy]]; the last feature involved paying small amounts for the [[forced labour]]. This solution to problems typical of [[colonialism]], and contemporary thinking behind it, are described in a 1938 work:

{{quote|There was the introduction of equitable taxation, so vital from the financial point of view; but also of such great political, moral and economic importance. It was the tangible proof of French authority having come to stay; it was the stimulus required to make an inherently lazy people work. Once they had learned to earn they would begin to spend, whereby commerce and industry would develop.

The corvée in its old form could not be continued, yet workmen were required both by the colonists, and by the Government for its vast schemes of public works. The [[Joseph Gallieni|General]] therefore passed a temporary law, in which [[taxation]] and labour were combined, to be modified according to country, the people, and their mentality. Thus, for instance, every male among the [[Hova (Madagascar)|Hovas]], from the age of sixteen to sixty, had either to pay twenty-five [[francs]] a year, or give fifty days of labour of nine hours a day, for which he was to be paid twenty [[centimes]], a sum sufficient to feed him. Exempted from taxation and labour were soldiers, militia, Government clerks, and any Hova who knew [[French language|French]], also all who had entered into a contract of labour with a colonist. Unfortunately, this latter clause lent itself to tremendous abuses. By paying a small sum to some European, who nominally engaged them, thousands bought their freedom from work and taxation by these fictitious contracts, to be free to continue their lazy, unprofitable existence. To this abuse an end had to be made.

The urgency of a sound fiscal system was of tremendous importance to carry out all the schemes for the welfare and development of the island, and this demanded a local budget. The goal to be kept in view was to make the colony, as soon as possible, self-supporting. This end the [[Joseph Gallieni|Governor-General]] succeeded in achieving within a few years.&lt;ref&gt;''The Drama of Madagascar'', Sonia E. Howe, pp. 331&amp;ndash;2. Methuen  &amp; Co. ltd. London, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===The Philippines===

{{see also|History of the Philippines (1521–1898)#Spanish rule}}

The system of forced labour otherwise known as ''polo y servicios'' evolved within the framework of the ''[[encomienda]]'' system, introduced into the South American colonies by the Spanish government. ''Polo y servicios'' in [[the Philippines]] refers to 40 days forced manual labour for men ranging 16 to 60 years of age; these workers built community structures such as churches. Exemption from ''polo'' was possible via paying the ''falla'' (corruption of the [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]] ''falta'', meaning "absence"), which was a daily fine of one and a half real. In 1884, the required tenure of labour was reduced to 15 days. The system was patterned after the Mexican ''repartimento'' selection for forced labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Agoncillo|1990|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal, African colonies===
In Portugal's African colonies (e.g. [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]]), the [[Native Labour Regulations]] of 1899 stated that all able bodied men must work for six months of every year, and that "They have full liberty to choose the means through which to comply with this regulation, but if they do not comply in some way, the public authorities will force them to comply."
&lt;ref&gt;Native Labour Regulations, section 1, 1899, Lisbon; in
Gordon White, Robin Murray, and Christina White, Eds., ''Revolutionary Socialist Development in the Third World''. 1983; Sussex, U.K.; Wheatsheaf Books. p.77.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Africans engaged in subsistence agriculture on their own small plots were considered unemployed. The labour was sometimes paid, but in cases of rule violations it was sometimes not—as punishment. The state benefited from the use of the labour for farming and infrastructure, by high income taxes on those who found work with private employers, and by selling corvée labour to [[South Africa]]. This system of corvée labour, called ''[[chibalo]]'', was not abolished in Mozambique until 1962, and continued in some forms until the [[Carnation Revolution]] in 1974.

===Romanian principalities===
In Romania, the corvée was called "clacă". Karl Marx describes the corvée system of the [[Danubian Principalities]] as a pre-capitalist form of compulsory over-work. The labour of the peasant needed for his own maintenance is distinctly marked off from the work he supplies to the land-owner (the boyar, or ''boier'', in Romanian) as surplus labour. The 14 days of labour due to the land-owner – as prescribed by the code of the corvée in the ''[[Regulamentul Organic|Règlement organique]]'' – actually amounted to 42 days, because the working day was considered the time required for the production of an average daily product, "and that average daily product is determined in so crafty a way that no Cyclops would be done with it in 24 hours."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Capital. A Critique of Political Economy: Volume One|year=1967|publisher=International Publishers|isbn=0717806219|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The code of the corvée was supposed to abolish serfdom, but it couldn't achieve anything in regard to this goal.

A [[Land reform in Romania#1864 reform|land reform]] took place in 1864, after the Danubian Principalities became unified and formed [[United Principalities|The United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia]], which abolished the corvée and turned the peasants into free proprietors. The former owners were promised compensation, which was to be paid from a fund the peasants had to contribute to for 15 years. Besides the annual fee, the peasants also had to pay for the newly owned land, although at a price below market value. These debts made many peasants return to a life of semi-serfdom.

===Russian Empire ===
[[File:Ukaz o trekhdnevnoy barschine.jpg|thumb|right|Paul I's edict, the [[manifesto of three-day corvee]]]]
In the [[Russian Tsardom]] and the [[Russian Empire]] there were a number of permanent corvees called ''[[:ru:тягло|тяглые]] повинности'': carriage corvée (подводная повинность), coachman corvée (ямская повинность), lodging corvée (постоялая повинность), etc.

In the context of the history of Russia, the term ''corvée'' is also sometimes used to translate the terms ''barshchina'' ({{lang|ru|барщина}}) or ''boyarshchina'' ({{lang|ru|боярщина}}), which refer to the obligatory work that the [[Russian serfdom|Russian serfs]] performed for the ''[[pomeshchik]]'' (Russian [[landed nobility]]) on the pomeshchik's land.  While no official government regulation to the extent of ''barshchina'' existed, a 1797 [[ukase]] by [[Paul I of Russia]] described a ''barshchina'' of three days a week as normal and sufficient for the landowner's needs.

In the [[Black Earth Region]], 70% to 77% of the serfs performed ''barshchina''; the rest paid levies (''[[obrok]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pipes, Russia under the old regime, pages 147–8&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Poland ===
In Poland in the 1940s Junacy ([[Służba Pracy]]) was a system of unpaid labour in bad conditions (little food, etc.) where underage people were often tricked or pressed into slavery for months or years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===United States===
Corvée was used in several states in North America especially for road maintenance and this practice persisted to some degree in the United States. Its popularity with local governments gradually waned after the [[American Revolution]] with the increasing development of the monetary economy. After the [[American Civil War]], some [[Southern United States|Southern]] states, with money in short supply, commuted taxing their inhabitants with obligations in the form of labour for public works, or let them pay a fee or a little bit higher tax to avoid it. The system proved unsuccessful because of the poor quality of work; in 1894, the Virginia state supreme court ruled that corvée violated the state constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showpdf.php?id=9711|title=Virginia as Analogue|publisher=H-Net Reviews|language=English|date=August 2004|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1913 [[Alabama]] became among the last states to abolish it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=flvS-nJga8QC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=Corv%C3%A9e+in+alabama&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DyEItrQGHl&amp;sig=13LJQSXWXQFp-TNtMa_NoWZqMTw&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIvePp2cTPAhXJd5oKHax6CucQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Corv%C3%A9e%20in%20alabama&amp;f=false|title=Motives and Management|publisher=Way of the World|page=101|language=English|author=MG Lay|date=1992|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern instances==
The government of [[Myanmar]] is well known for its use of the corvée and has defended the practice in its official newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;''Ending Forced Labour in Myanmar: Engaging a Pariah Regime'' Routledge, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bhutan]], the ''{{lang|bo-Latn|[[driglam namzha]]}}'' calls for citizens to do work, such as [[dzong]] construction, in lieu of part of their tax obligation to the state.

In [[Rwanda]], the centuries-old tradition of [[umuganda]], or community labor, still continues, usually in the form of one Saturday a month when citizens are required to perform this work.

The [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] maintains corvée for females (ages 18–35) and males (ages 18–45) of 10 days yearly for public works at the discretion of the authorities. This is termed Labor duty ({{lang-vi|nghĩa vụ lao động}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://moj.gov.vn/vbpq/Lists/Vn%20bn%20php%20lut/View_Detail.aspx?ItemID=6774 "Decree defining labor duty"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The British overseas territory of [[Pitcairn Island]], which has a population of about 50 and no income or sales tax, has a system of "public work" whereby all able-bodied people are required to perform, when called upon, jobs such as road maintenance and repairs to public buildings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onlinepitcairn.com/pitcairn_%20today.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Venezuela]], President [[Nicolás Maduro]] signed a decree in July 2016 that "all workers from the public and private sector with enough physical capabilities and technical know-how be required to work in the agricultural sector for a 60-day period that can be extended for another 60 days 'if the circumstances require it.'" &lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2016/07/29/congratulations-to-bolivarian-socialism-venezuela-brings-back-agricultural-slavery&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-late 19th century, most countries have restricted corvée labour to [[conscription]] ([[military service|military]] or [[civilian service]]), or [[prison labour]].

'''Dispatch''' is a procedure for assigning employees (workers) or vehicles to customers.  Industries that dispatch include [[taxicab]]s, [[courier]]s, [[emergency service]]s, as well as home and commercial services such as [[maid]] services, [[plumbing]], [[HVAC]], [[pest control]] and [[electricians]].

With vehicle dispatching, clients are matched to vehicles according to the order in which clients called and the proximity of vehicles to each client's pick-up location.  Telephone operators take calls from clients, then either enter the client's information into a [[computer]] or write it down and give it to a [[dispatcher]].  In some cases, calls may be assigned a priority by the call-taker.  Priority calls may jump the queue of pending calls. In the first scenario, a central computer then communicates with the [[mobile data terminal]] located in each vehicle (see [[computer assisted dispatch]]); in the second, the dispatcher communicates with the driver of each vehicle via two-way radio.

With home or commercial service dispatching, customers usually schedule services in advance and the dispatching occurs the morning of the scheduled service.  Depending on the type of service, workers are dispatched individually or in teams of two or more.  Dispatchers have to coordinate worker availability, skill, travel time and availability of parts.  The skills required of a dispatcher are greatly enhanced with the use of computer dispatching software (see [[computer aided call handling]]).

==Manual dispatch systems==

The following are examples of manual systems used to track the status of resources in a dispatched fleet.

===Cards===
Card systems employ a set of shelves with a slot for each unit in the dispatch fleet. Each vehicle or resource has a slot in the shelving system. In it, a card, like a time card used to track an employee's work hours, is stored. A time clock, similar to the one that stamps work hours on a time card, is used to stamp event times on each card. At the beginning of a work day, the resource's identifier or other information is handwritten on the card. Each time the resource's status changes, the card is punched in the time clock and a new status entry is handwritten on the card. The card collects a series of entries through the work shift.

In a tow truck example, the card might be labeled with the tow car's radio identifier, "Downtown 6" and may be labeled with the vehicle number or data about the capabilities of the specific tow car. It might give a weight capacity, show the unit as a flat bed or cradle snatcher, or mention the unit carries a can of Diesel fuel. The name of the staff on the car might be noted. At the start of a shift, the dispatcher would note the unit "available" and time stamp the card. At the assignment to a call, the call information would be written on the card and the card might be stamped at the moment the assignment is read to the tow car crew. The string of notes and time stamps allows dispatch staff to get a clear picture of the status of a small fleet.

Some systems use shelving with red and green lights and a switch at the back of the card slot. If the resource's card is pushed all the way into the card slot, the switch is actuated and an indicator lamp turns red. This identifies the tow car whose card occupies that slot as not available, or assigned to a call. Leaving the card pulled partway out leaves the indicator green, showing the dispatcher that unit is available. Is anyone available? The lights are supposed to give the dispatch staff a snapshot of their resource situation.

A major flaw of this system is that cards are inside shelves and trying to look at an entire set of cards to evaluate the overall situation requires the dispatcher to pull out every card, one at a time, and read it. If two or more resources are sent to the same call, the dispatcher has a lot of writing to do.

===Punched tags===
Punched tag systems employ a set of pegs with each peg holding tags for one unit in the dispatch fleet. Each vehicle working the current shift has a peg with a tag describing the unit's current status. A time clock, similar to the one that stamps work hours on a time card, is used to stamp times on each tag. At the beginning of a work day, the resource's identifier may be posted above the peg. The unit's start time is stamped and their status is written on the tag. Each time the resource's status changes, a new tag is written and the tag is time stamped in order to log the time the unit's status changed. The peg collects a stack of tags through the work shift.

In a tow truck example, the peg might be labeled with the tow car's radio identifier, "Downtown 6" and may be labeled with the vehicle number or data about the capabilities of the specific tow car. It might give a weight capacity, show the unit as a flat bed or cradle snatcher, or mention the unit carries a can of Diesel fuel. The name of the staff on the tow car might be noted. At the start of a shift, the dispatcher would note the unit "available" and time stamp a tag, then hang it on that unit's peg. At the assignment to a call, the call information would be written on another tag and the tag might be stamped at the moment the assignment is read to the tow car crew. The tag would then be hung on that unit's peg. The stack of tags allows dispatch staff to get a clear picture of the status of a small fleet.

Some systems use colored tags to show general categories of events such as "available". For example, each unit that is available might have the fact noted on an orange tag. Is anyone available? A glance at the pegboard shows anybody whose tag is "orange" is available. An repossession might use a yellow tag to identify a service call with a safety issue where the police should be called in the event the tow car crew doesn't check in by radio within five minutes. A blue tag might show a resource is taking a dinner or lunch break.

A major flaw of this system is that tags can easily be posted on the wrong peg, causing confusion. This can be countered by writing unit identifiers on every tag: a lot of work. In colored-tag systems, it is always possible to run out of certain colors of tags, messing up the system. If two or more resources are sent to the same call, the dispatcher has a lot of writing to do.

===Plastic icons===
In a plastic icon system, the blank panel on the communications console or a nearby wall is fitted with a sheet of [[Velcro]]. The material has vertical stripes painted on it, making a column for each of several possible status conditions. The simplest system is two columns: available and unavailable. Magnetized icons can be used in place of Velcro. The icons can be coloured or shaped to identify the type of unit or some other feature of the resource.

Each vehicle working the current shift has an icon placed in the column describing the unit's current status. A log book is used to track times, event details, and other information about calls for service. In a tow truck example, the icon might be labelled with the tow car's radio identifier, "Down town 6". During a shift, the icon would be moved by the dispatcher into whatever column describes the resource's current condition. Alternatively, there could be columns for some other condition such as the names of move-up or standby points where resources are sent to backfill for busy tow cars.

A major flaw of this system is that icons can easily be misplaced or fall off of the status board. Magnetic objects can damage cathode ray tube displays if they get too close to the display face or housing.

== Airline dispatch ==

In [[airline]] operations in a few countries, a [[dispatcher]] shares legal responsibility for a flight's safety with its pilot, and may delay, divert or cancel a flight if there is reason to do so.  This [[checks and balances]] mechanism supposedly improves the safety of the dispatch system, although most countries do not use this system and there is no noticeable detriment to flight safety.  A dispatcher typically must be licensed by the aviation authority of a country.  The examination for the licence requires the candidate to demonstrate knowledge in meteorology and aviation comparable to that required to obtain an [[Airline Transport Pilot Licence]].

== Mobile dispatch ==

In a mobile system, wireless technology is provided for efficient job planning, assignment and efficient job planning through the use of mobile dispatch systems sent out through a [[mobile network]] on to a mobile device such as [[PDA]]. This allows for more flexible management of the workers out in the field as a job can be dispatched to multiple users to accept or reject the job. The benefits of a mobile system as it can then be integrated back into the other software systems used by an organization such as [[asset management]], rostering, and other financial systems.

== Trucking dispatch ==

[[Trucking]] dispatchers play a major role in transportation logistics.  Truck dispatchers orchestrate freight movement and equipment from one place to another while keeping close communication with truck drivers.  Some dispatching companies help truck drivers to negotiate and acquire loads and handle paperwork.  Dispatching trucks require a variety of skills like using a computer to find and track loads for drivers to speaking multiple languages depending on the region or number of trucks they manage.  Great customer service and good communication are vital for succeeding in this fast-paced environment.

==Capacity and metrics==
There is a limit to how many field units can be managed. This varies with circumstances. For example, a parcel delivery service [[dispatcher]] may encounter higher traffic around [[Christmas]]. Work is not evenly distributed across time: in any dispatch system there are traditional peaks or busy hours in requests for service. Some workplace cultures will allow longer wait times than others.

Systems may use a [[Radiotelephony procedure]] to reduce talking time, allowing interaction with a larger dispatch fleet. Air traffic control and towing are two examples. The use of abbreviations or standard phrases can reduce the length of a transaction. Capacity may be reduced by relaxed voice procedure such as a delivery dispatcher giving a lengthy description of a customer complaint over the radio.

It is generally accepted that giving field units computers connected with the computer-aided dispatch, or another enterprise system used for dispatch, unloads voice two-way radio channels and increases capacity. Users research information on their terminal or laptop instead of calling in with a request that the dispatcher do it.&lt;ref&gt;Suggested reading: "Congestion and Coverage Concerns," ''Contra Costa County Public Safety Mobile Radio Master Plan'', ([[Fairfax, Virginia]]: Federal Engineering, Inc., 2002,) pp. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; One source suggests radio traffic drops by 30% when computers are available to mobile users.&lt;ref&gt;"4.5 Mobile Data Systems," ''San Rafael Police Radio Committee: Report to Mayor and City Council'', ([[San Rafael, California]]: City of San Rafael, 1995,) pp. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
Measurements of communications may reflect dispatch capacity. A partial definition of capacity comes from the number of communications channels required to support a dispatch fleet. Two metrics of channel capacity may be: 1) the number of field units or ''resources'' dispatched, and; 2)number of push-to-talk presses per day.&lt;ref&gt;Some touch screen radio dispatch consoles can keep a tally of [[push-to-talk]] presses.&lt;/ref&gt; A resource may refer to a fire engine, tow truck, taxi, or refuse truck, regardless of how many walkie-talkies, mobile radios, or persons were fielded along with each resource.

One suggestion is that 100 to 150 mobiles is the maximum practical on one channel.&lt;ref&gt;See: "Section I: General," ''The [[California Highway Patrol]] Communications Technology Research Project on 800 MHz'', 80-C477, ([[Sacramento, California]]: Department of General Services, Communications Technology Division, 1982,) pp. I-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggests 60-70 units as a maximum.&lt;ref&gt;Suggested reading: "Congestion and Coverage Concerns," ''Contra Costa County Public Safety Mobile Radio Master Plan'', ([[Fairfax, Virginia]]: Federal Engineering, Inc., 2002,) pp. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in these two ranges probably reflects the wording. For example, 120 ''mobiles'' may mean radios: 60 units each containing a mobile radio and an officer with a walkie talkie.&lt;ref&gt;It may also reflect differences in operational styles between the Contra Costa Sheriffs Department and Highway Patrol. It might be that the average Highway Patrol officer interacts less often with their dispatcher.&lt;/ref&gt; For dispatch systems like take-out food delivery, where life safety is not an issue, delays may be acceptable. Delays increase capacity.

Another possible measure of capacity is system push-to-talk presses. A 187-day study of four [[Contra Costa County, California]] Sheriffs Department conventional two-way radio dispatch channels showed an average of around 2,500 push-to-talk presses per day. The count was within +/-350 a day across all four primary dispatch channels.&lt;ref&gt;Data were supplied by the Sheriffs Department. Suggested reading: "Congestion and Coverage Concerns," ''Contra Costa County Public Safety Mobile Radio Master Plan'', ([[Fairfax, Virginia]]: Federal Engineering, Inc., 2002,) pp. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--*Can you find more?*--&gt;

===Telephone===
[[File:18butt~1.png|right|200px|thumb|Multi-line phones are seen in many dispatching facilities. Rotary dials are rare.]]A method used for telephone traffic analysis may fit some circumstances. One evaluation looked at 1) peak of busy hour usage, 2) average hourly usage, 3) message length in seconds, 4) maximum delay or wait time desirable, and; 5) maximum percent of users being delayed. [[Traffic analysis]] can be applied to radio or telephone communications.&lt;ref&gt;For one example, see: "3.2.10.1 Current System Problems," ''Trunked Radio System: Request For Proposals'', (Oklahoma City, Oklahoma: Oklahoma City Municipal Facilities Authority, Public Safety Capital Projects Office, 2000) pp. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most office telephone systems have some facility for recording calling volumes, and incoming call timing. Dispatch centers use [[Automatic call distribution|Automatic call distribution (ACD)]] groups which can be evaluated for metrics such as average wait time, abandoned calls, and calls per hour. These numeric data can be entered into spreadsheets for analysis of trends.

In dispatching, US emergency medical services literature suggests that telephone calls to a dispatching facility should be answered in the first few rings. One document suggests emergency calls to dispatch should result in busy signals once per 100 calls during the busiest hour.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction: EMS Communications," ''Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Regional-level Planning Guide'', (Washington, DC: Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1995) pp. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In business call centers, similar standards are suggested by consultants in order to provide an ideal customer experience and to outperform competing services.&lt;ref&gt;See InTelegy customer service web site (ibid) for more information on call metrics.&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficient staffing should be in place so that 90% of emergency calls are, "...answered within 10 seconds, or with no greater than three rings, during the average busy hour," according to one source.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction: EMS Communications," ''Planning Emergency Medical Communications: Volume 2, Regional-level Planning Guide'', (Washington, DC: Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 1995) pp. 11. For a discussion of telephone traffic statistics and ''busy hours'', see: American Telephone and Telegraph Company, ''Basic Traffic Analysis'', {{ISBN|0-13-335407-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolerable wait times vary from one culture and region to another: some cultures expect immediate service; others will tolerate waits for some services. Regardless of sector or industry, almost all dispatchers will spend virtually their entire work day on the phone, answering as many as a thousand calls in a single shift while multi tasking other aspects of the job. In many ways, being a dispatcher is really one person doing the work of three or four people. It consistently ranks as among the most stressful jobs in the industrialized world, with high blood pressure, fatigue, obesity, heart disease, and other stress/sedentary related health concerns existing at rates up to ten times the norm of any other occupation.

==Zone system to assign service calls==

[[File:TRANSIT cad.png|thumb|right|500px|Dispatch consoles used by [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] RTD, a transit service provider in a US city. Drawing at right illustrates the controls associated with a single channel on the console. Photos courtesy of US Department of Transportation.]]One method for organizing assignments in a manual dispatch system is to use a zone map system. Consider a community with four fire stations and two ambulance service providers. A grid is overlaid on a community map. Saint Proximal Medical Center ambulance is identified by the notation ''P'' while Distal Volunteer Rescue Squad is noted with a ''D''.

Each zone of the grid is identified with a progression of ambulance zones and fire stations.&lt;ref&gt;This would work for any system including taxis or parcel pick up.&lt;/ref&gt; One zone might be labeled: DP241. This means fire station 2, then 4, then 1, then 3 would respond to a fire call occurring inside this zone. If fire stations 2, 4, and 1 were assigned to calls, Station 3 would be sent to this zone. Distal Volunteer Rescue Squad would be first-up for an ambulance call occurring inside zone DP241.

The predefined order is created by persons with expertise in the service being provided, local geography, traffic, and patterns in calls for service. In assigning resources to a zone, decision-makers may consider that responding units must drive around freeways, lakes, or terrain obstructions in order to reach a zone. Zone boundaries and designations will periodically change as communities grow or lessons are learned during day-to-day operations. Consider a zone with an irrigation canal defining one boundary. If a car crashes into the canal, which zone is it in?

Zone systems may include standby, move-up, or backfill points. For example, taxi drivers working in a certain zone in the evening hours may expect night club patrons to need a ride. Consider a standby point at Main Street and Railroad Avenue named ''N''. Some fares will come from radio calls to dispatch. A taxi driver, Car 4, may go to predefined standby location ''N''. In some dispatching systems, the driver will call the dispatcher and report they are available and located at standby point ''N''. The dispatcher may respond by reporting the driver's position in the queue, "Car 4, second N." The first call in this district would go to the driver ahead of Car 4. Car 4 would be assigned the second call.

If [[automatic vehicle location]] is available, it would display service vehicle locations on a map. The closest unit would be interpreted by the dispatcher looking at vehicle locations projected on the map.

The '''Financial Reporting Council''' ('''FRC''') is the UK's and the Republic of Ireland's independent regulator responsible for promoting high quality corporate governance and reporting to foster investment.

==Structure==
The FRC is a [[company limited by guarantee]], partly funded by government and the industry and its board of directors is appointed by the [[Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy]]. It and its subsidiaries play crucial roles in the oversight and development of [[corporate governance]] standards in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, such as the [[UK Corporate Governance Code]] and standards for the accounting industry.

The FRC board is supported by three committees:
* the Codes &amp; Standards Committee
* the Executive Committee
* the Conduct Committee

The Codes and Standards Committee advise the FRC board on matters relating to codes, standard-setting and policy questions, through its Accounting, Actuarial and Audit &amp; Assurance Councils (formerly Audit Practices Board). The Conduct Committee advise the FRC Board in matters relating to conduct activities to promote high-quality corporate reporting, including monitoring, oversight, investigative and disciplinary functions, through its Monitoring Committee and Case Management Committee. The Executive Committee will support the Board by advising on strategic issues and providing day-to-day oversight of the work of the FRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=FRC structure | url=http://www.frc.org.uk/About-the-FRC/FRC-structure.aspx | publisher=Financial Reporting Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Former structure==

The FRC incorporates six operating bodies:

===Accounting Standards Board===
The role of the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) is to issue accounting standards in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is recognised for that purpose under the [[Companies Act 1985]]. It took over the task of setting accounting standards from the [[Accounting Standards Committee]] (ASC) in 1990. However, ASB was overtaken by Financial Reporting Council (FRC) on 2 July 2012. Thus, FRC is now the authority that may issue accounting standards in UK.

===Financial Reporting Review Panel===
The Financial Reporting Review Panel (FRRP) was established in 1990 as a subsidiary of the [[United Kingdom]]'s Financial Reporting Council. The FRRP seeks to ensure that the provision of financial information by public and large private companies complies with relevant accounting requirements such as the [[Companies Act 1985]].

===Accountancy &amp; Actuarial Discipline Board===
The Accountancy &amp; Actuarial Discipline Board (AADB) is the independent, investigative and disciplinary body for accountants and actuaries in the [[United Kingdom]]. The AADB was formerly known as the Accountancy Investigation &amp; Discipline Board (AIDB). It changed its name to the AADB on August 16, 2007. The AADB Scheme establishes the framework and sets in place the legal formalities of participation between the AADB and the Participating Accountancy Bodies i.e. the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] (ICAEW), the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]] (ACCA), the [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA), and the [[Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy]] (CIPFA), The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ireland, and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland.

{{As of|2010}} the AADB has a substantial workload including investigations into the conduct of professional firms, such as [[Ernst &amp; Young|EY]], that had advised [[Lehman Brothers]], [[JPMorgan]], [[Connaught plc|Connaught]], Aero Inventory, and [[BAE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/2069558/disciplinary-funding-costs-leap-icaew Disciplinary funding costs leap at the ICAEW], Accountancy Age, 10 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional Oversight Board===
The '''Professional Oversight Board''' ('''POB''') is a [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[regulatory]] body specializing in the [[accounting]], [[financial audit|auditing]], and [[actuary|actuarial]] [[profession]]s. It is a part of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC), the independent regulator of [[corporate governance]] and [[financial accounting|reporting]] in the UK.

The Board's stated purpose is to support the FRC's goal of [[investor]] and public confidence in the financial governance of [[business]] organizations. The Board provides assurance that [[professional association|professional accountancy bodies]] are properly setting standards and enforcing [[discipline]] for their members, in accordance with the [[Companies Act 2006]] and other statutory requirements. The POB can carry out inspections on behalf of the FRC, but if any shortcomings are found, sanctions can only be imposed by the professional bodies.&lt;ref name=licensed&gt;[http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/analysis/2070827/licensed-audit Licensed to audit?], ''[[Accountancy Age]]'', 13 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, if a complaint raises concerns that a professional accountancy or actuarial body may have breached significantly its own standard procedures in the handling of a complaint about their member, the POB will normally seek the comments of the relevant body and look at papers relating to the case as appropriate. The Board will then normally write to the complainant to tell them the outcome of their consideration of the matter and whether the body proposes to take any action based on their comments. The POB does not have the power either to overturn any decision which the body has made in a case or to direct how the body should handle a case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frc.org.uk/pob/complaints/index.cfm|title=Complaints about Registered Auditors, Accountants and Actuaries|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629062032/http://www.frc.org.uk/pob/complaints/index.cfm|archivedate=2012-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board also operates an Audit Inspection Unit (AIU) that oversees auditing organizations and makes recommendations for appropriate regulatory actions by governmental and professional authorities. As part of its oversight of the actuarial profession, the Board monitors the activities of actuarial organizations with regard to the [[Actuary#Credentialing and exams|education]], discipline, [[business ethics|ethical]] standards and continuing [[professional development]] of their members. The Board also seeks to provide a framework for the evaluation of the quality and effectiveness of actuarial work.

Before 5 May 2006, the Board was known as the Professional Oversight Board for Accountancy. The name change reflected the Board's additional responsibility for oversight of the actuarial profession from that date.

In 2011, the Board published information for the first time about shortcomings in self-regulation by particular institutes. Press reports highlighted comments about [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]], which had implemented recommendations to improve its examination syllabus, but needed to pay greater attention to continuing monitoring of members who had registered as auditors some years ago.&lt;ref name=aa20110722&gt;{{cite news|last=Orlik|first=Rose|title=POB regulation report names and shames institutes|url=http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/2095994/pob-regulation-report-names-shames-institutes|accessdate=28 July 2011|newspaper=Accountancy Age|date=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board contains members from a wide range of backgrounds. {{As of|2011}} Paul George is its Director,&lt;ref name=licensed/&gt; and John Kellas is interim chair following the death of Dame [[Barbara Mills]].&lt;ref name=aa20110722/&gt;

===Auditing Practices Board===
The Auditing Practices Board Limited (APB) was originally established in 1991 as a committee of the [[Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies]], to take responsibility within both [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] for setting standards of [[auditing]] with the objective of enhancing public confidence in the audit process and the quality and relevance of audit services in the public interest. In 2002 APB was re-established under the auspices of [[The Accountancy Foundation]] and, following a UK government review, it has been transferred to the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). Its objective has remained the same, but its remit has been extended to include responsibility for setting standards for auditors' integrity, objectivity and independence.

===Board for Actuarial Standards===

==Senior personnel==
[[Sir Winfried Bischoff]] has been Chairman of the FRC since May 2014. Other board members include Gay Huey Evans, Melanie McLaren and Paul George.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.frc.org.uk/About-the-FRC/FRC-structure/FRC-Board/Members.aspx FRC Board], Financial Reporting Council. Retrieved 19 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The FRC's Chief Executive since November 2009 is [[Stephen Haddrill]].

==Financial Reporting Review Panel==
The '''Financial Reporting Review Panel''' (FRRP) was established in 1990 as a subsidiary of the [[United Kingdom]]'s Financial Reporting Council. The FRRP seeks to ensure that the provision of financial information by public and large private companies complies with relevant accounting requirements such as the [[Companies Act 1985]].

==Controversies==
On 19 April 2013, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' ran a story titled "Criticism as seven watchdog members set to investigate KPMG are revealed as current and former employees".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/money/news/article-2311821/Criticism-SEVEN-watchdog-members-set-investigate-KPMG-revealed-current-employees-they-all-were-part-of-the-scandel.html|title=Criticism as SEVEN watchdog members set to investigate KPMG are revealed as current and former employees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carillion===
Following the January 2018 collapse of construction and services business [[Carillion]], it was reported that Carillion's auditor [[KPMG]] would have its role examined by the FRC.&lt;ref name="Prior-29Jan2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prior|first1=Grant|title=Carillion accountant KPMG faces probe by watchdog|url=http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2018/01/29/carillion-accountant-kpmg-faces-probe-by-watchdog/|accessdate=29 January 2018|work=Construction Enquirer|date=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, the FRC's conduct committee announced an investigation into the conduct of former Carillion finance directors [[Richard Adam]] and [[Zafar Khan (businessman)|Zafar Khan]].&lt;ref name="Boffey-17Mar2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boffey|first1=Daniel|last2=Davies|first2=Rob|title=Former Carillion finance directors expected to face investigation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/17/former-carillion-finance-directors-investigation-frc|accessdate=19 March 2018|work=Guardian|date=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morby-19Mar2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morby|first1=Aaron|title=FRC launches probe into Carillion finance directors|url=http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2018/03/19/frc-launches-probe-in-carillion-finance-directors/|accessdate=19 March 2018|work=Construction Enquirer|date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operations of the FRC itself were also to be scrutinised by an independent inquiry ordered by [[Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|Business Secretary]] [[Greg Clark]].&lt;ref name="Partington-21Mar2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Partington|first1=Richard|title=PwC charges more than £20m for first eight weeks of Carillion collapse|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/mar/21/pwc-charges-20m-eight-weeks-carillion-collapse-final-bill|accessdate=21 March 2018|work=Guardian|date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{merge to|Indian Contract Act 1872|date=March 2018}}

'''Indian contract law''' regulates [[contract law]] in [[India]] except the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The main contract law in India is codified in the [[Indian Contract Act 1872]] which came into effect on September 1, 1872 and is applicable in the whole country. It governs entering into contract, execution of contract, and the effects of breach of contract.

== Definition ==
According to Section 2(h) of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 a '''contract''' is
(i) An agreement Enforceable by law
An '''agreement''' as per Section 2(e) means a promise or a set of promises in exchange for a promise or a set of promises.

== Enforcement of contracts==

{{Capitalism}}
{{Financial market participants}}

An '''investor''' is a person that allocates capital with the expectation of a future financial return.&lt;ref name="Reasonable"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Reasonable Investor(s)|journal=Boston University Law Review|volume=95|issue=461|page=466|first=Tom C.W.|last=Lin|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of investments include: [[stock|equity]], [[Bond (finance)|debt]] [[Security (finance)|securities]], [[real estate]], [[currency]], [[commodity]], [[Exonumia|token]], derivatives such as put and call [[Option (finance)|options]], [[Futures contract|futures]], [[Forward contract|forwards]], etc. This definition makes no distinction between those in the primary and secondary markets.  That is, someone who provides a business with capital and someone who buys a stock are both investors.  An investor who owns a stock is a [[shareholder]].

==Essential quality==
The assumption of risk in anticipation of gain but recognizing a higher than average possibility of loss. The term "speculation" implies that a business or investment risk can be analyzed and measured, and its distinction from the term "investment" is one of degree of risk. It differs from [[gambling]], which is based on random outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Barron's&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Investors can include stock traders but with this distinguishing characteristic: investors are owners of a company which entails responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/News/Speech/Detail/Speech/1370541547078|title=Looking at Corporate Governance from the Investor's Perspective |publisher=Sec.gov |date=April 21, 2014 |accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of investors==
There are two types of investors, retail investors and [[institutional investor]]s:

===Retail investor===
* Individuals gambling in games of chance.
* Individual investors (including [[Trust law|trusts]] on behalf of individuals, and umbrella companies formed by two or more to pool investment funds)
* [[Collecting|Collectors]] of [[art]], [[antique]]s, and other things of value
* [[Angel investor]]s (individuals and groups)
* [[Sweat equity]] investor

===Institutional investor===
* [[Venture capital]] and [[private equity]] funds, which serve as investment collectives on behalf of individuals, companies, pension plans, insurance reserves, or other funds.
* [[Business]]es that make investments, either directly or via a captive fund
* [[Investment trust]]s, including [[real estate investment trust]]s
* [[Mutual fund]]s, [[hedge fund]]s, and other funds, ownership of which may or may not be [[Public company|publicly traded]] (these funds typically pool money raised from their owner-subscribers to invest in securities)
* [[Sovereign wealth fund]]s

Investors might also be classified according to their [[Investor profile|styles]]. In this respect, an important distinctive [[Behavioral economics|investor psychology]] trait is [[risk aversion|risk attitude]].

==Investor protection==
The term "investor protection" defines the entity  of efforts  and activities to observe, safeguard and enforce the rights and claims of a person in his role as an investor. This includes advice and legal action.  The assumption of a need of protection is based on the experience that financial investors  are usually structurally inferior to providers of financial services and products due to lack of professional knowledge, information or experience. Countries with stronger investor protections tend to grow faster than those with poor investor protections.  Investor protection includes accurate financial reporting by public companies so the investors can make an informed decision.  Investor protection also includes fairness of the market which means all participants in the market have access to the same information.

===Through government===
Investor protection through government is regulations and enforcements by government agencies to ensure that market is fair and fraudulent activities are eliminated.  An example of a government agency that provides protection to investors is the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC), which works to protect reasonable investors in America.&lt;ref name="Reasonable" /&gt;

===As individuals===
Investor protection through individual is the strategy that one utilizes to minimize loss. Individual investors can protect themselves by purchasing only shares of businesses that they understand, or only those that remain calm through market volatility.

An individual investor may be protected by the strategy he uses in investment. The strategy includes an appropriate price of the stocks or assets in the right time he enters. It's hard to fix what "an appropriate price" is, and when it is appropriate because no one makes a purchase or a sale absolutely in his most favorable situation. However, determination may be made when the price of such share or assets are "undervalued" comparing to its potentiality. This is called the margin of safety  where an investor can feel at ease when the price of the stocks is alarmingly down.

==Investment tax structures==
While a tax structure may change, it is generally accepted that long-term capital gains will maintain their position of providing an advantage to investors. This is countered by the opinion that after-tax returns should be considered, especially during retirement, on the basis that allocation to equities is in general, lower, than any returns and should be maximized, to the most lucrative extent. In the current circumstances, long-term capital gains offer one of the best opportunities in the [[United States]] tax structure.

It is made easier for investors to generate long-term capital gains by the employment of [[exchange-traded fund]]s (ETFs); the process if investment in broad-based index funds, without required indicators. Although some outlandish ETFs could provide investors with the opportunity to venture into previously inaccessible markets and employ different strategies, the unpredictable nature of these holdings frequently result in short-term transactions,  surprising tax equations and general performance results issues.

Company dividends are paid from after-tax profits, with the tax already deducted. Therefore, shareholders are given some respite with a preferential tax rate of 15% on "qualified dividends" in the event of the company being domiciled in the United States. Alternatively, in another country having a double-taxation treaty with the USA, accepted by the IRS;. Non-qualified dividends paid by other foreign companies or entities; for example, those receiving income derived from interest on bonds held by a mutual fund, are taxed at the regular and generally higher rate of income tax. When applied to 2013, this is on a sliding scale up to 39.6%, with an additional 3.8% surtax for high-income taxpayers ($200,000 for singles, $250,000 for married couples).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Investment Tax Basics for All Investors|url=http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072313/investment-tax-basics-all-investors.asp|website=Investopedia.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discipline==
A disciplined and structured investment plan prevents emotional investing which can be related to impulsive buying. This factor can be utilized to counteract the sentiments of a marketplace, which is often reflective of the emotional state of an entire population. Short-term activity in stock prices or the broader markets can frequently be compared to impulsive actions. This is seen in the term "bull run" which can induce investors to leap into an investment, as opposed to a "bearish market" that could influence a "sell-off".  It is these types of market scenarios that can cause investors to abandon their investment strategies. Investor discipline is the ability to maintain an investment strategy even in the most tempting, or extreme conditions in the marketplace.

An established and popular method for stock market investors is [[Systematic Investment Plan]]s (SIPs) especially for those who have a regular, monthly surplus income. The provision for reaping maximum benefits from these plans is that a disciplined strategy is maintained, one of the foremost advantages for a successful investor. Consistency is closely associated with an investment strategy and can be related to various, adopted, proven techniques; for example, predicting outperforming funds, valuation, or a technical strategy. A strategic advantage that meets the required consistency is long-term investment, which in turn, offers investors long-term capital gains tax advantages.  While many investors try to exercise a long-term disciplined approach, the investment marketplace can provide various, tempting options; for instance, a sudden drop in the marketplace, or a pending worldwide event. This is particularly prevalent for retired investors, who are preserving their capital with care.

==Constant advantage for retirees==
In general, core indexes remain constant making it unnecessary for investors to move from one to another. Although an investor could transfer holdings; despite a maturation of the companies and their markets; a large-cap exchange-traded fund would never require being switched for a similar holding. A large-cap ETF will always remain so and an investor will usually want to retain at least a part allocation to large-cap equities in their portfolio.

It is consistency that is a significant advantage for ETF investors and one that makes it convenient to retain investment positions and benefit from long-term capital gains tax. Despite a potential reduction in the capital gains tax advantage, it is an advantage that should continue to provide some positive benefits in producing after-tax returns. This is a factor that could become an important issue in the future as taxes increase, affecting the lifestyles of retirees. It can be added to by additional taxes generated in short-term trading, exacerbating the situation, due to normal income-tax rates increases.

==Role of the financier==
{{redirect|financier}}
A '''financier''' ({{IPAc-en|f|ɪ|n|ə|n|ˈ|s|ɪər}}; {{IPA-fr|finɑ̃sje|lang}}) is a person  whose primary occupation is either facilitating or directly providing investments to up-and-coming or established [[companies]] and [[businesses]], typically involving large sums of money and usually involving [[private equity]] and [[venture capital]], [[mergers and acquisitions]], [[leveraged buyout]]s, [[corporate finance]], [[investment banking]], or large-scale [[asset management]]. A financier makes money through this process when his or her investment is paid back with interest,&lt;ref name="Freixas"&gt;Xavier Freixas, Jean-Charles Rochet, ''Microeconomics of Banking'' (2008), p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; from part of the company's [[private equity|equity]] awarded to them as specified by the business deal, or a financier can generate income through [[Commission (remuneration)|commission]], performance, and management fees. A financier can also promote the success of a financed business by allowing the business to take advantage of the financier's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Landström, ''Handbook of Research on Venture Capital'' (2007), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The more experienced and capable the financier is, the more the financier will be able to contribute to the success of the financed entity, and the greater reward the financier will reap.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin H. Neave, ''Modern Financial Systems: Theory and Applications'' (2009), p.8, &lt;/ref&gt; The term, financier, is [[French language|French]], and derives from ''[[finance]]'' or ''payment''. 

Financier is a term used to describe someone who handles money. Certain financier avenues require degrees and licenses including [[venture capitalist]]s, [[hedge fund]] managers, [[Trust Fund Manager|trust fund managers]], [[accountant]]s, [[stockbroker]]s, [[financial advisors]], or even [[treasurer|public treasurers]]. Personal investing on the other hand, has no requirements and is open to all by means of the [[stock market]] or by word of mouth requests for money. A financier "will be a specialized financial intermediary in the sense that it has experience in [[Liquidation|liquidating]] the type of firm it is lending to".&lt;ref name="Freixas"/&gt;

===Perceptions===
Economist [[Edmund Phelps]] has argued that the financier plays a role in directing capital to investments that governments and social organizations are constrained from playing:

{{quote|[T]he pluralism of experience that the financiers bring to bear in their decisions gives a wide range of entrepreneurial ideas a chance of insightful evaluation. And, importantly, the financier and the entrepreneur do not need the approval of the state or of social partners. Nor are they accountable later on to such social bodies if the project goes badly, not even to the financier's investors. So projects can be undertaken that would be too opaque and uncertain for the state or social partners to endorse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europainstitut.at/upload/publikationen/publikation_39.pdf|title=Dynamic Capitalism|author=Edmund S. Phelps|author-link=Edmund Phelps|publisher=[[Europa-Institut]]|date=October 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The concept of the financier has been distinguished from that of a mere capitalist based on the asserted higher level of judgment required of the financier.&lt;ref&gt;Sterling Elliott, ed., ''Good Roads: Devoted to the Construction and Maintenance of Roads'' (1896), Vol. 24, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt; However, financiers have also been mocked for their perceived tendency to generate wealth at the expense of others, and without engaging in tangible labor. For example, humorist [[George Helgesen Fitch]] described the financier as "a man who can make two dollars grow for himself where one grew for some one else before".&lt;ref name="Fitch"&gt;George Fitch, ''Vest Pocket Essays'' (1916), p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific investors' guidelines==
Specific investment practices are suggested to  maintain an ethical behaviour based on principles universally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jubilee-centre.org/investing-as-a-christian-reaping-where-you-have-not-sown-by-paul-mills/|title=Investing as a Christian: Reaping where you have not sown by Paul Mills - Jubilee Centre|date=17 June 1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Socially responsible investing==
[[Socially responsible investing]] is recommended in all types of investment.

It is connected to the rear of the [[Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino]] and was in service from 1971 until the demise of the [[Desert Wind]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Marroquin |first=Art |date=August 21, 2016 |title=Rails remain, but Amtrak left Las Vegas with the Desert Wind |url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/news-columns/road-warrior/rails-remain-but-amtrak-left-las-vegas-with-the-desert-wind/ |work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |accessdate=March 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the construction of the casino, part of the site was used for a [[Streamline Moderne]] train station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agilitynut.com/train.html |title=Art Deco Train Stations |accessdate=2008-09-02 |website=Agilitynut.com |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Constructed in 1940, the station was upgraded with [[neon]] lights in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/78469770@N00/96524005/ |title=UP Railroad Station 1946 – Las Vegas |accessdate=2008-09-02 |website=Flickr.com |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This station was demolished in 1971 and replaced by the Union Plaza Hotel, which included a small waiting room to be used as a station for Amtrak trains.

==Union Plaza Hotel and Casino station==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
The Union Plaza Hotel and Casino, originally called the Union Plaza in reference to the [[Union Pacific]] railroad station that stood at the site, opened on July 2, 1971. Its original owners included local businessmen: [[Sam Boyd]], [[Howard Cannon]], [[Jackie Gaughan]], and Frank Scott. 

From 1990 to 1992, the red neon object was installed at the top of the neon sign.

Before the discontinuation of the ''[[Desert Wind]]'' train route on May 10, 1997, [[Amtrak]]'s Las Vegas, Nevada station was located at the Plaza. The station and ticket windows were directly connected to the hotel. It was the only train station in the United States located in a casino. The [[Las Vegas Limited]] also served the station during the service's short existence.

Today, Las Vegas is served by an [[Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach]] from the [[Salt Lake City Intermodal Hub]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. Its two Las Vegas bus stops are located at [[McCarran International Airport]] and in [[Downtown Las Vegas]], near Union Plaza station.

==Future plans==
Amtrak plans for restoration of Las Vegas rail service surfaced almost immediately after the discontinuation of the Desert Wind. These plans recommended using [[Talgo]] trains between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, similar to Amtrak's [[Amtrak Cascades|Cascades]] route in the Pacific Northwest. This plan was never implemented and Las Vegas went without passenger rail service. Las Vegas is [[List of major cities in U.S. lacking Amtrak service|one of the largest metro areas in the US without passenger rail service]].

In 2005 DesertXpress Enterprises LLC was formed in an attempt to restore passenger rail service to Las Vegas. They officially released their plan to construct a high-speed route to [[Southern California|SoCal]] later that year. In 2009, after years of environmental reports, determining [[right of way (public throughway)|right of way]], and debating over what federal agency would have regulatory authority, Secretary of Transportation [[Ray LaHood]] announced the official recognition of DesertXpress as a high-speed route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xpresswest.com/milestones.html|title=Milestones • XpressWest Website|website=Xpresswest.com|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011, DesertXpress applied for a federal, $5 billion loan through the [[Federal Railroad Administration|FRAs]] [[Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing|RRIF]]. If approved this would be the largest single amount loaned out since the program began. This contradicted original statements made by DesertXpress Enterprises, that they would not use any tax payer funds. This loan request came months before the final [[Environmental impact statement|EIS]] was approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vegasinc.com/news/2011/feb/21/desert-xpress-going-after-tax-dollars-after-all/|title=DesertXpress rail project going after tax dollars, after all|date=21 February 2011|website=Vegasinc.com|accessdate=31 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their [[XpressWest]] project is a plan to construct a {{convert|185|mi|abbr=on}} high-speed route from Las Vegas to Southern California. The terminus of this line, [[Victorville, CA|Victorville]], has been criticized due to its distance from Downtown Los Angeles, the place long considered to be the prime location for any high-speed rail terminal. Victorville, approximately 85 miles from Los Angeles, was chosen due to the exponential cost of building high-speed rail infrastructure in urban areas, such as the Los Angeles metropolitan area.

A competing company, [[Las Vegas Railway Express]], also plans to begin passenger rail service between Las Vegas and Southern California, though at lower speeds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1893">'''Lieven Gevaert''' ([[Antwerp]], 28 May 1868 – [[The Hague]], 2 February 1935) was a [[Flanders|Flemish]] industrialist. His father died when he was only three years old. He started his career in the company he founded together with his mother in 1889, which produced photographic paper according to traditional methods. In 1894, he founded the company [[Gevaert &amp; Co]], which in 1920, was transformed to [[N.V Gevaert Photo-producten]], merged in 1964 with Agfa AG to become Gevaert-Agfa NV and later [[Agfa-Gevaert]] NV.

Already at an early age, he felt socially responsible and wanted to advance the status of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] in Belgium. His personal ideas were strongly influenced by the social encyclical ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891) and the writings of [[Lodewijk De Raet]]. He supported several [[Flanders|Flemish]] initiatives as a manager, but stayed outside politics. His main objectives were the introduction of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] as a business language, and the foundation of a sound Dutch-speaking education as a means to establish a [[Flemish people|Flemish]] elite. In 1926, when the ''Vlaamsch Handelsverbond'' ([[Vlaams Economisch Verbond]], VEV) was founded, Gevaert was its first chairman. Later, he founded the Sint-Lievenscollege in Antwerp, where he lived on [[Belgiëlei]].

'''Moïse Lévy de Benzion''' (1873–1943) was an Egyptian department store owner who built an important collection of art and antiquities. The collection was plundered by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] in France during the Second World War and nearly 1000 items seized.

During the Second World War, Lévy de Benzion's collections in Paris and the chateau "La Folie" in Draviel were extensively looted by units of the [[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]] (ERR), the Nazi unit charged with following behind invading German troops and identifying and seizing works of art from occupied countries. Records of the ERR indicate that 989 items were seized from the Lévy de Benzion collection alone.&lt;ref name=Harc&gt;Harclerode, Peter, &amp; Brendan Pittaway.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7908">[[File:Baines 1835-Mule spinning crop.jpg|thumb|Part of an 1835 engraving showing a mule scavenger at work]]

'''Scavengers''' were employed in 18th and 19th century in [[cotton mill]]s, predominantly in the UK and the United States, to clean and recoup the area underneath a [[spinning mule]].  The [[cotton]] wastage that gathered on the floor was seen as too valuable for the owners to leave and one of the simplest solutions was to employ young children to work under the machinery.  Many children suffered serious injuries while under the mules, with fingers, hands, and sometimes heads crushed by the heavy moving parts.  Legislation introduced in 1819 tried to reduce working hours and improve conditions but there were still deaths recorded well beyond the middle of the 19th century.

==Job description==
Scavengers were the lowliest of the apprentices at the cotton mills and had to endure the worst conditions.&lt;!--{{POV|date=September 2011}}--&gt;  They were employed to work under the machinery to clean up the dust and oil and to gather the cotton that had been thrown off the mule by its intense vibrations.  The tenters would not stop to allow the scavenger to work because they were paid by how much they could produce.  As the mule moved forwards the children were sent under the machine, sweeping and gathering the cotton.  They had to then time their retreat so as to not become entangled within the many moving parts.&lt;ref name="TR"&gt;[[Tony Robinson|Robinson, Tony]]. ''[[The Worst Jobs in History]]''. Pan. {{ISBN|0-330-43857-3}} pp. 164–166.&lt;/ref&gt;  These children had started in the mills at around the age of four, working as scavengers until they were eight before progressing to the role of piecers.  They worked 14 to 16 hours a day, beaten if they fell asleep, until they were 15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/childreno4.htm Children of the Revolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817164123/http://www.cottontimes.co.uk/childreno4.htm |date=17 August 2010 }}. Cotton Times. Accessed 2 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Both tertiary sources that have introduced inaccuracies. Cotton Times is a good starting point, but heavily redacted--&gt;

==Danger==
The job is noted as being one of the worst in history owing to the conditions the children had to work in.  The danger of being beneath the machines meant that they had to constantly pay attention to its movements in order to avoid serious injury.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdiscovery.com/history/worst_jobs/georgian/index.shtml The Worst Jobs in History]. [[Discovery Channel]]. Accessed 2 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  An 1840 novel by [[Frances Trollope]] describes the work of a scavenger:
{{quotation|The miserable little creature... was a little girl about seven years old, whose office as "''scavenger''," was to collect incessantly from the machinery and from the floor, the flying fragments of cotton that might impede the work.  In the performance of this duty, the child was obliged, from time to time, to stretch itself with sudden quickness on the ground, while the hissing machinery passed over her; and when this is skilfully done, and the head, body, and outstretched limbs carefully glued to the floor, the steady-moving, but threatening mass, may pass and repass over the dizzy head and trembling body without touching it.  But accidents frequently occur; and many are the flaxen locks, rudely torn from infant heads, in the process.|Frances Trollope, ''The life and adventures of Michael Armstrong, the factory boy''&lt;ref&gt;Trollope, Frances Milton. ''The life and adventures of Michael Armstrong, the factory boy''. 1840.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While there were no requirements for factory owners to keep any records about the majority of accidents on their premises there are many anecdotal cases of scavengers suffering serious and sometimes fatal injuries.

==Legislation==
The children were sent to the mills of Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Lancashire from the [[workhouse]]s in London and other towns and cities in the south of England.  About half of the workers in Manchester and Stockport cotton factories surveyed in 1818 and 1819 had begun work at under ten years of age.  Part of the [[Factory Acts#Factory Act 1802|Factory Act of 1802]] was introduced to improve conditions for children, but it was not enough.  In the [[Factory Acts#Cotton Mills, etc. Act 1819|1819 Cotton Mills and Factories Act]] the law was updated to state that no children under the age of nine were to be employed and that children aged 9–16 years were limited to a maximum day of 16 hours.&lt;ref name="earlyfactory"&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/livinglearning/19thcentury/overview/earlyfactorylegislation/ Early factory legislation].

The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) is a partnership between government, academia, and the private sector focused supporting the country’s ability to address current and future cybersecurity education and workforce challenges through standards and best practices. NICE is led by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]] in the [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]]. 

==History==
The [[Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative|Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI)]], established by President George W. Bush in January 2008, included over twelve Initiatives, one of which, Initiative 8, was aimed at making the Federal cybersecurity workforce better prepared to handle cybersecurity challenges.

In May 2009, the [https://csrc.nist.gov/Topics/Laws-and-Regulations/executive-documents/Cyberspace-Policy-Review Cyberspace Policy Review], directed by President Barack Obama,  elevated the CNCI Initiative 8, which had initially been focused on improving the Federal cybersecurity workforce’s ability to perform cybersecurity work. The scope was expanded beyond the Federal workforce to include the private sector workforce, truly making it a national charge. 

In March 2010, the Obama administration declassified limited material regarding the CNCI, making Initiative 8 public: ''Initiative #8. Expand cyber education.'' ''While billions of dollars are being spent on new technologies to secure the U.S. Government in cyberspace, it is the people with the right knowledge, skills, and abilities to implement those technologies who will determine success. However there are not enough cybersecurity experts within the Federal Government or private sector to implement the CNCI, nor is there an adequately established Federal cybersecurity career field. Existing cybersecurity training and personnel development programs, while good, are limited in focus and lack unity of effort. In order to effectively ensure our continued technical advantage and future cybersecurity, we must develop a technologically-skilled and cyber-savvy workforce and an effective pipeline of future employees. It will take a national strategy, similar to the effort to upgrade science and mathematics education in the 1950’s, to meet this challenge.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative|date=2018-07-17|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Comprehensive_National_Cybersecurity_Initiative&amp;oldid=850689173|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the CNCI described training, education, and professional development programs as lacking “unity of effort”. 

[https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/1353/text Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014] Title IV established the “National cybersecurity awareness and education program”, which is now known as the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE). 

==Vision==
A digital economy enabled by a knowledgeable and skilled cybersecurity workforce.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2018/01/16/nice_strategicplan_011218_web.pdf|title=2016 NICE Strategic Plan|last=NICE Program Office|first=|date=April 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission== 
To energize and promote a robust network and an ecosystem of cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Publications==
'''NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework'''
[[File:NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework.jpg|thumb|NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework seven categories in color boxes.]]
The NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework (NICE Framework), NIST Special Publication 800-181&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework|last=Newhouse|first=William|publisher=NIST|year=2017|isbn=|location=https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-181.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is a national focused resource that categorizes and describes cybersecurity work. The publication serves as a fundamental reference to support a workforce capable of meeting an organization’s cybersecurity needs by establishing a taxonomy and common lexicon that describes cybersecurity work and workers irrespective of where or for whom the work is performed. The NICE Framework is intended to be applied in the public, private, and academic sectors. Although the NICE Framework was published as a NIST Special Publication in August 2017, working drafts of the document have been in use since 2010. The publication is intended to be a living document that will be updated periodically based on change requests to the NICE Program Office.  A plethora of tools and resources exist for learning about and implementing the NICE Framework. Learn more at [https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework nist.gov/nice/framework].   

'''NICE Strategic Plan'''

The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 requires that a strategic plan be developed and implemented every five years. The current [https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/about/strategic-plan NICE Strategic Plan] includes a multitude of guiding values and three primary goals: 1) Accelerate Learning and Skills Development, 2) Nurture a Diverse Learning Community, and 3) Guide Career Planning and Workforce Development. See the current and past versions of the NICE Strategic Plan at [https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice nist.gov/nice]. 

'''Supporting the Growth and Sustainment of the Nation's Cybersecurity Workforce: Building the Foundation for a More Secure American Future'''

In May 2017, President Donald Trump issued the Executive Order on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. In part, the order states that it is the policy of the United States “to support the growth and sustainment of a workforce that is skilled in cybersecurity and related fields as the foundation for achieving our objectives in cyberspace.” Consequently, the Secretary of Commerce and Secretary of Homeland Security were directed to provide a report to the President with findings and recommendations regarding how to support the growth and sustainment of the Nation's cybersecurity workforce in both the public and private sectors. The report, ''[https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/executive-order-13800 Supporting the Growth and Sustainment of the Nation's Cybersecurity Workforce: Building the Foundation for a More Secure American Future]'', is the response to this charge. 

'''NICE Framework Work Role Capability Indicators: Indicators for Performing Work Roles''' 

The [https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8193/draft NICE Framework Work Role Capability Indicators: Indicators for Performing Work Roles, draft NIST Interagency Report 8193], was co-authored by representatives from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. The document helps determine what qualities or accomplishments indicate that someone is suitable to perform a particular job or activity. These qualities are defined in this report as “capability indicators.”

==Organization==
NICE is headquartered at NIST facilities in Gaithersburg, Maryland. The NICE Program Office activities are organized into three categories: government engagement, industry engagement, and academic engagement. 

'''Committees'''

NICE has several committees: 

* [https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/national-initiative-cybersecurity-education-nice/nice-interagency NICE INTERAGENCY COORDINATING COUNCIL]  - The NICE Interagency Coordinating Council convenes Federal Government partners of NICE for consultation, communication, and coordination of policy initiatives and strategic directions related to cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development. The meetings provide an opportunity for the NICE Program Office, to communicate program updates with key partners in the Federal Government to learn about other Federal Government activities in support of NICE. The group will also identify and discuss policy issues and provide input into the strategic directions for NICE. 
* [https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/about/working-group NICE WORKING GROUP] - The NICE Working Group provides a mechanism for public and private sector participants to develop concepts, design strategies, and pursue actions that advance cybersecurity education, training, and workforce development. The meetings provide an opportunity for consultation and information-sharing between the government, academia, and the private sector. The NICE Working Group also identifies new initiatives that support the strategic objectives of NICE. 
* [https://niceconference.org/about NICE CONFERENCE PROGRAM COMMITTEE] – The NICE Conference Program Committee serves as expert advisors to the NICE Program office, coordinators, and hosts of the [https://niceconference.org/ NICE Conference]. The Program Committee is responsible for identifying the conference theme and tracks as well as soliciting and selecting speaker proposals for the conference. 
* [https://www.k12cybersecurityconference.org/conference-planning-committee/ NICE K12 CYBERSECURITY EDUCATION CONFERENCE PLANNING COMMITTEE] – The NICE K12 Cybersecurity Education Conference Planning Committee assists and supports the NICE Program office, coordinators, and hosts of the [https://www.k12cybersecurityconference.org/ NICE K12 Cybersecurity Education Conference]. 

== Funded Projects ==
'''NICE Challenge Project'''

The [https://nice-challenge.com/ NICE Challenge Project], led by California State University, San Bernardino, is designed to create a flexible set of challenge environments and supporting infrastructure with a low barrier of use in which one would be able to perform the tasks outlined in the [https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/nice/resources/nice-cybersecurity-workforce-framework NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework]. It can be used as a platform for instruction as well as to evaluate those who endeavor to be part of the cybersecurity workforce. 

'''CyberSeek'''

[https://www.cyberseek.org/ CyberSeek], an interactive heat map and pathway tool, developed by [[CompTIA]] in partnership with Burning Glass Technologies, provides a data visualization of the need for and supply of cybersecurity workers to guide employers, job seekers, policy makers, education and training providers, and guidance counselors. CyberSeek includes a Cybersecurity Jobs Heat Map which shows information on the supply of workers with relevant credentials. This project also shows Career Pathways in cybersecurity that map opportunities for advancement in the field. 

'''Regional Alliances and Multistakeholder Partnerships to Stimulate Cybersecurity Education and Workforce Development (RAMPS)''' 

[https://www.nist.gov/nice/regional-alliances-and-multistakeholder-partnerships-stimulate-ramps RAMPS] was a program that provides funding opportunities to build multistakeholder workforce partnerships of employers, schools and institutions of higher education, and other community organizations.

{{Japanese name|Ōkura}}
''Incorporates translations from the corresponding Japanese Wikipedia article''

{{nihongo|'''Baron Ōkura Kihachirō'''|大倉 喜八郎||October 23, 1837 &amp;ndash; April 5, 1928}} was an [[entrepreneur]] who built up the Ōkura-gumi and founded the giant ''Ōkura [[zaibatsu]]'' (literally financial cliques) and the ''Ōkura Shōgyō Gakkō'' which later became [[Tokyo Keizai University]] in 1949.

== Biography ==
In contrast to most of the zaibatsu, the Ōkura zaibatsu was founded by someone from the peasant class. Ōkura Kihachirō moved from what is now [[Niigata Prefecture]] on the north shore of [[Honshū]] to [[Edo]] and worked for three years before starting his own grocery store in 1857. After selling groceries for eight years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/zaibatsu.htm#OKURA Okura zaibatsu]&lt;/ref&gt; he became a [[weapons]] dealer during the turbulent years between the arrival of the [[Black Ships]] and the eventual overthrow in 1867 of the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] and despite being born a peasant, he became an expert in [[Shindō Munen-ryū]]. He became one of the principal business investors of the original [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] completed in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oldtokyo.com/okura.html Okura]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kihachiro's son, [[Kishichiro Okura|Kishichirō]], is credited with introducing the [[automobile]] into [[Japan]].

Kihachiro, who made a fortune in his lifetime and lived in [[Toranomon]], was a collector of [[Oriental]] [[antiques]]. In fear of valuable [[Visual arts|artworks]] flowing out to other countries, he built Japan’s first private [[museum]], the [[Ōkura Shukokan]], in 1917 by donating many cultural assets he had collected, the land, and the funds. The 5-story building stood on a property of about 10,000 square meters (2.5 acres), but it was damaged in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]]. The Ōkura Shukokan that now stands adjacent to the Hotel Ōkura was rebuilt in 1928; it was based on a design by [[Itō Chūta]], who is known for his design for [[Tsukiji Honganji]] Temple, and is designated as a cultural asset of Japan. The museum houses 2,000 pieces of Oriental paintings and sculptures, including such national treasures as the wooden statue of [[Samantabhadra]] and 35,000 volumes of [[Chinese literature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.city.minato.tokyo.jp/yukari/e/man-detail.cgi?id=16&amp;CGISESSID=dcd5fd43789c08a3a564dcfaa4f6ce9b Prominent People of Minato City]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3733">'''Otto Sverdrup Engelschiøn''' (30 October 1902 – 8 May 1982) was a Norwegian marketer, businessperson, resistance member and genealogist.

He was born in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] as a son of consul-general Søren Dass Brodtkorb Sverdrup Engelschiøn (1867–1909) and Janka Hansen (1869–1935). In 1928 he married Gudrun Irgens Garmann.&lt;ref name=hvem&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=1973|title=Engelschiøn, Otto Sverdrup |encyclopedia=[[Hvem er hvem?]]|editor=Steenstrup, Bjørn|publisher=Aschehoug|location=Oslo|url=http://runeberg.org/hvemerhvem/1973/0139.html |page=139|language=Norwegian|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Engelschiøn [[examen artium|finished]] his secondary education in 1922 and graduated from the [[University of Oslo|Royal Frederick University]] with the [[cand.jur.]] degree in 1926. He was an attorney from 1927, and also director of I. Sverdrup Engelschiøn which had the rights to distribute Swedish [[Tomten (company)|Tomten]] products in Norway. In 1929 it was merged with [[Norsk Barnengens Tekniske Fabrik]]. Engelschiøn spent the rest of his career in the company, from 1929 as director of the sales and marketing department and from 1948 to 1968 as co-owner.&lt;ref name=hvem/&gt;

In the 1930s he was a member of [[Nasjonal Samling]]. He left the party in the 1937 party split, continuing though in the ''[[Ragnarok (national socialist group)|Ragnarok]]'' group around national socialist [[Hans S. Jacobsen]], and edited the magazine [[Ragnarok (periodical)|''Ragnarok'']] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nazister ble motstandsmenn|date=11 July 2001|work=[[Dagbladet]]|page=39|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Emberland |first=Terje |author2=Rougthvedt, Bernt  |title=Det ariske idol: Forfatteren, eventyreren og nazisten Per Imerslund |year=2004 |publisher=Aschehoug |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian |isbn=978-82-03-22964-0 |oclc=58648278}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, however, Norway was [[Operation Weserübung|invaded]] and [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupied by Nazi Germany]]. Engelschiøn joined the resistance movement and was the head of intelligence in [[Milorg]]'s District 13, Division 3 ([[Asker]] and [[Bærum]]) from 1943 to 1945. He received the [[Defence Medal 1940–1945]] with rosette.&lt;ref name=hvem/&gt;

Engelschiøn chaired the [[Norwegian Genealogical Society]] from 1957 to 1968, and thereafter served as deputy chairman. He was also a [[bibliophile]], chairing [[Bibliofilklubben]] twice as well as the contest jury for the Most Beautiful Book of the Year. Engelschiøn also issued a crime novel under pseudonym.&lt;ref name=hvem/&gt;

He resided in Bærum.&lt;ref name=hvem/&gt; He died in 1982 and was buried at [[Haslum Church|Haslum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disnorge.no/gravminner/index.php?language=engelsk|title=Cemeteries in Norway|publisher=DIS-Norge|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''partnership''' is an arrangement where parties, known as [[business partners|partners]], agree to cooperate to advance their mutual interests. The partners in a partnership may be individuals, [[business entity|businesses]], [[interest]]-based [[organization]]s, [[school]]s, [[government]]s or combinations. [[Organization]]s may partner to increase the likelihood of each achieving their mission and to amplify their reach. A partnership may result in issuing and holding equity or may be only governed by a contract.

==History==

Partnerships have a long history; they were already in use in Medieval times in Europe and in the Middle East. 
In Europe, the partnerships contributed to the [[Commercial Revolution]] which started in the 13th century. In the 15th century the cities of the [[Hanseatic League]], would mutually strengthen each other; a ship from Hamburg to Danzig would not only carry its own cargo but was also commissioned to transport freight for other members of the league. This practice not only saved time and money, but also constituted a first step toward partnership. This capacity to join forces in reciprocal services became a distinctive feature, and a long lasting success factor, of the Hanseatic team spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beerbühl|first1=Margrit Schulte|title=Networks of the Hanseatic League|url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/european-networks/economic-networks/margrit-schulte-beerbuehl-networks-of-the-hanseatic-league|website=EGO European History Online|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A close examination of Medieval trade in Europe shows that numerous significant credit based trades were not bearing interest. Hence, pragmatism and common sense called for a fair compensation for the risk of lending money, and a compensation for the opportunity cost of lending money without using it for other fruitful purposes. In order to circumvent the usury laws edicted by the Church, other forms of reward were created, in particular through the widespread form of partnership called ''commenda'', very popular with Italian merchant bankers.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Favier, Gold &amp; Spices: the rise of commerce in the middle ages, Holmes &amp; Meier Pub; 1st US edition, July 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Florentine [[merchant banks]] were almost sure to make a positive return on their loans, but this would be before taking into account solvency risks.

In the Middle East, the ''[[Qirad]]'' and ''Mudarabas'' institutions developed when trade with the Levant, namely the Ottoman Empire and the Muslim Near East, flourished and when early [[Trading company|trading companies]], [[contract]]s, [[bills of exchange]] and long-distance [[international trade]] were established.&lt;ref name=Banaji&gt;Jairus Banaji (2007), "Islam, the Mediterranean and the rise of capitalism", ''[[Historical Materialism (journal)|Historical Materialism]]'' '''15''' (1): 47–74, [[Brill Publishers]].&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Roman Empire, the Levant trade revived in the tenth to eleventh centuries in Byzantine Italy. The eastern and western Mediterranean formed part of a single commercial civilization in the Middle Ages, and the two regions were economically interdependent through trade (in varying degrees).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laiou|first1=Angeliki E.|title=The Economic History of Byzantium: From the Seventh through the Fifteenth Century|date=2008|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks|isbn=088402332X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Igp8hxsHV_AC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnership agreements==
Although not required by law, partners may benefit from a partnership agreement that defines the important terms of the relationship between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Is a Partnership|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/partnership.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partnership agreements can be formed in the following areas: 
* Business: two or more companies join forces in a joint venture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bamford|first1=James|last2=Ernst|first2=David|last3=Fubini|first3=David G.|title=Launching a World-Class Joint Venture|url=https://hbr.org/2004/02/launching-a-world-class-joint-venture|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=3 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a consortium to i) work on a project (e.g. industrial or research project) which would be too heavy or too risky for a single entity, ii) join forces to have a stronger position on the market, iii) comply with specific regulation (e.g. in some emerging countries, foreigners can only invest in the form of partnerships with local entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coispeau|first1=Olivier|title=Mergers &amp; Acquisitions and Partnerships in China|date=18 May 2015|publisher=World Scientific Publishing Co|isbn=9814641022|page=311|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/9789814641036_fmatter|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the alliance may be structured in a process comparable to a [[Mergers &amp; Acquisitions]] transaction.
* Politics (or geopolitics): In what is usually called an [[Political alliance|alliance]], governments may partner to achieve their national interests, sometimes against allied governments holding contrary interests, as occurred during [[World War II]] and the [[Cold War]]. 
* Knowledge: In [[education]], [[Educational accreditation|accrediting agencies]] increasingly evaluate schools, or universities, by the level and quality of their partnerships with local or international peers and a variety of other entities across societal sectors. 
* Individual: Some partnerships occur at [[domestic partnership|personal levels]], such as when two or more individuals agree to domicile together, while other partnerships are not only personal, but private, known only to the involved parties.

Partnerships present the involved parties with complex negotiation and special challenges that must be navigated unto agreement. Overarching goals, levels of give-and-take, areas of responsibility, lines of authority and [[Succession planning|succession]], how success is evaluated and distributed, and often a variety of other factors must all be negotiated. Once agreement is reached, the partnership is typically enforceable by [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]], especially if well documented. Partners who wish to make their agreement affirmatively explicit and enforceable typically draw up [[Articles of Partnership]]. Trust and pragmatism are also essential as it cannot be expected that everything can be written in the initial partnership agreement, therefore quality governance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zadek|first1=Simon|last2=Radovich|first2=Sacha|title=Governing collaborative governance|journal=John F. Kennedy School of Government|date=April 2006|url=https://sites.hks.harvard.edu/m-rcbg/CSRI/publications/workingpaper_23_zadek_radovich.pdf|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and clear communication are critical success factors in the long run. It is common for information about formally partnered entities to be made public, such as through a press release, a newspaper ad, or public records laws.

While industrial partnerships stand to amplify mutual interests and accelerate success, some forms of collaboration may be considered ethically problematic. When a politician, for example, partners with a corporation to advance the latter's interest in exchange for some benefit, a [[conflict of interest]] results; consequentially, the [[public good]] may suffer. While technically lawful in some jurisdictions, such practice is broadly viewed negatively or as [[corruption]].

==Partner compensation==
Partner compensation will often be defined by the terms of a partnership agreement. Partners who work for the partnership may receive compensation for their labor before any division of profits between partners.

===Equity vs. salaried partners===
In certain partnerships of individuals, particularly [[law firm]]s and [[accountancy]] firms, '''equity partners''' are distinguished from '''salaried partners''' (or '''contract or income partners'''). The degree of control which each type of partner exerts over the partnership depends on the relevant [[partnership agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Serrill-Robins|first1=Mira|title=Equity vs. Non-Equity Partnerships|url=https://www.lexisnexis.com/legalnewsroom/lexis-hub/b/careerguidance/archive/2010/03/15/equity-vs-non-equity-partner-what-the-difference-means-to-you.aspx|website=LexisNexis Legal Newsroom|publisher=Relx Group|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An equity partner is a part-owner of the [[business]], and is entitled to a proportion of the distributable [[Profit (accounting)|profits]] of the partnership.
* A salaried partner who is paid a [[salary]] but does not have any underlying ownership interest in the business and will not share in the [[dividend|distributions]] of the partnership (although it is quite common for salaried partners to receive a bonus based on the firm's profitability).

Although individuals in both categories are described as partners, equity partners and salaried partners have little in common other than [[joint and several liability]]. In many legal systems, salaried partners are not technically "partners" at all in the eyes of the law. However, if their firm holds them out as partners, they are nonetheless subject to joint and several liability.

In their most basic form, equity partners enjoy a fixed share of the partnership (usually, but not always an equal share with the other partners) and, upon distribution of profits, receive a portion of the partnership's profits proportionate to that share. In more sophisticated partnerships, different models exist for determining either ownership interest, profit distribution, or both. Two common alternate approaches to distribution of profit are "[[lockstep compensation|lockstep]]" and "[[Merit pay|source of origination]]" [[remuneration|compensation]] (sometimes referred to, more graphically, as "eat what you kill").&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Norman|title=Better carrots for partner compensation strategies|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=b1849e63-a519-4da7-979c-0753525fef6b|website=Lexology|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lockstep involves new partners joining the partnership with a certain number of "points". As time passes, they accrue additional points, until they reach a set maximum sometimes referred to as a plateau. The length of time it takes to reach the maximum is often used to describe the firm (so, for example, one could say that one firm has a "seven-year lockstep" and another has a "ten-year lockstep" depending on the length of time it takes to reach maximum equity).
*Source of origination involves the compensation of profits according to a formula that takes into consideration the amount of revenue and profit generated by each partner, such that partners who generate more revenue receive a greater share of the partnership's distributed profit.

===Law firms===
Source of origination compensation is rarely seen outside of law firms. The principle is simply that each partner receives a share of the partnership profits up to a certain amount, with any additional profits being distributed to the partner who was responsible for the "origination" of the work that generated the profits.&lt;ref name="clark"/&gt;

British law firms tend to use the lockstep principle, whereas American firms are more accustomed to source of origination. When British firm [[Clifford Chance]] merged with American firm [[Rogers &amp; Wells]], many of the difficulties associated with that [[merger]] were blamed on the difficulties of merging a lockstep culture with a source of origination culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Becker|first1=Amanda|title=Law firm merger activity picks up|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/02/AR2010070204907.html|accessdate=22 September 2017|publisher=Washington Post|date=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxation==
Partnerships recognized by a government body may enjoy special benefits from [[Tax policy|taxation policy]]. Among developed countries, for example, business partnerships are often favored over [[corporation]]s in taxation policy, since [[dividend tax]]es only occur on profit before they are distributed to the partners. However, depending on the partnership structure and the [[jurisdiction]] in which it operates, owners of a partnership may be exposed to greater [[personal liability]] than they would as [[shareholder]]s of a corporation. In such countries, partnerships are often regulated via [[anti-trust]] laws, so as to inhibit [[monopoly|monopolistic practices]] and foster [[Market economy|free market competition]]. Enforcement of the laws, however, varies considerably. Domestic partnerships recognized by governments typically enjoy tax benefits, as well.

==Common law==
At [[common law]], members of a business partnership are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the partnership. Forms of partnership have evolved that may limit a partner's liability.

===Forms of partnership===
As [[common law]] there are two basic forms of partnership:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partnership|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/small/Op-Qu/Partnership.html|website=Reference for Business|publisher=Advameg, Inc.|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[general partnership]]: a partnership in which all partners manage the business and are personally liable for its debts. General partners have an obligation of [[strict liability]] to third parties injured by the Partnership. General partners may have [[joint liability]] or [[joint and several liability]] depending upon circumstances.
#[[limited partnership]] (LP): a partnership in which general partners manage the partnership's operations, and limited partners forego the right to manage the business in exchange for [[limited liability]] for the partnership debts. The liability of limited partners is limited to their investment in the partnership.

More recently, additional forms of partnership have been recognized:
*[[limited liability partnership]] (LLP): a form of partnership in which all partners may have some degree of limited liability.
* [[limited liability limited partnership]] (LLLP): a form of limited partnership in which general partners have limited liability for the debts and obligations of the limited partnership.

===Silent partners===
A '''''silent partner''''' is one who still shares in the profits and losses of the business, but who is not involved in its management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Silent partner|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/silent_partner|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the silent partner's interest in the business will not be publicly known. A silent partner is often an investor in the partnership, who is entitled to a share of the partnership's profits. Silent partners may prefer to invest in limited partnerships in order to insulate their personal assets from the debts or liabilities of the partnership.

===Australia===
{{Main|Partnership (Australia)}}
Summarising s. 5 of the ''[[Partnership Act 1958]]'' (Vic) (hereinafter the "Act"), for a partnership in Australia to exist, four main criteria must be satisfied. They are:
* Valid Agreement between the parties;
* To carry on a business – this is defined in s. 3 as "any trade, occupation or profession";
* In Common – meaning there must be some mutuality of rights, interests and obligations;
* View to Profit – thus charitable organizations cannot be partnerships (charities are typically incorporated associations under ''Associations Incorporations Act 1981'' (Vic))
Partners share profits and losses. A partnership is basically a settlement between two or more groups or firms in which profit and loss are equally divided

===Bangladesh===
In Bangladesh, the relevant law for regulating partnership is the Partnership Act 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Partnership Act, 1932|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/pdf_part.php?id=157|website=Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division|publisher=Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partnership is defined as the relation between persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business carried on by all or any of them acting for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Section 4 of the Partnership Act 1932|url=http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/pdf_part.php?id=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law does not require written partnership agreement between the partners to form a partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goni|first1=Osman|title=Should you register your partnership?|url=https://osmangoni.com/register-partnership/|website=Osman Goni|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partnership does not also required to be registered, however an unregistered partnership has a number of limitation regarding enforcing its rights in any court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should you register your partnership?|url=https://osmangoni.com/register-partnership/|website=Osman Goni|accessdate=21 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A partnership is considered as a separate legal identity (i.e. separate from its owners) in Bangladesh only if the partnership is registered. There must be a minimum of 2 partners and maximum of 20 partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to start a partnership business in Bangladesh - OGR Legal|url=https://resource.ogrlegal.com/partnership-in-bangladesh/|website=Resource Portal of OGR Legal|publisher=OGR Legal|accessdate=29 April 2016|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Statutory regulation of partnerships in Canada fall under [[Constitution Act, 1867|provincial jurisdiction]]. A partnership is not a separate legal entity and partnership income is taxed at the rate of the partner receiving the income. It can be deemed to exist regardless of the intention of the partners. Common elements considered by courts in determining the existence of a partnership are that two or more legal persons:
*Are carrying on a business
*In common
*With a view to profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part 1: Partnerships – Am I in One and Why Does it Matter?|url=http://www.uvicblc.ca/2012/03/part-1-partnerships-am-i-in-one-and-why-does-it-matter/|website=Business Law Clinic|publisher=University of Victoria, Faculty of Law|accessdate=22 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224161517/http://www.uvicblc.ca/2012/03/part-1-partnerships-am-i-in-one-and-why-does-it-matter/|archivedate=24 February 2015|date=6 March 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
{{Main|Partnership (Hong Kong)}}
A partnership in Hong Kong is a business entity formed by the Hong Kong Partnerships Ordinance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/38/ |title=Hong Kong Ordinances, CAP 38 Partnership Ordinance |publisher=Hklii.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which defines a partnership as "the relation between persons carrying on a business in common with a view of profit" and is not a joint stock company or an incorporated company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/38/s3.html |title=Hong Kong Partnerships Ordinance, Chapter 38, section 3 |publisher=Hklii.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the business entity registers with the Registrar of Companies it takes the form of a limited partnership defined in the Limited Partnerships Ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/37/ |title=CAP 37 Limited Partnerships Ordinance |publisher=Hklii.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hklii.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org/hk/legis/en/ord/37/s4.html |title=Hong Kong Limited Partnerships Ordinance, Chapter 37, section 4 |publisher=Hklii.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, if this business entity fails to register with the Registrar of Companies, then it becomes a general partnership as a default.&lt;ref name="hklii.org"/&gt;

===India===
According to section 4 of the Partnership Act of 1932,"Partnership is defined as the relation between two or more persons who have agreed to share the profits of a business run by all or any one of them acting for all". This definition superseded the previous definition given in section 239 of Indian Contract Act 1872 as – “Partnership is the relation which subsists between persons who have agreed to combine their property, labor, skill in some business, and to share the profits thereof between them”. The 1932 definition added the concept of mutual agency. The Indian Partnerships have the following common characteristics:

1) '''A partnership firm is not a legal entity''' apart from the partners constituting it. It has limited identity for the purpose of tax law as per section 4 of the Partnership Act of 1932.&lt;ref name="indiapartact"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Partnership Act, 1932|url=http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/actsbills/pdf/Partnership_Act_1932.pdf|website=Ministry of Corporate Affairs|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2) '''Partnership is a concurrent subject'''. Contracts of partnerships are included in the Entry no.7 of List III of The Constitution of India (the list constitutes the subjects on which both the State government and Central (National) Government can legislate i.e. pass laws on).&lt;ref name="indiapartact"/&gt;

3) '''Unlimited Liability'''. The major disadvantage of partnership is the unlimited liability of partners for the debts and liabilities of the firm. Any partner can bind the firm and the firm is liable for all liabilities incurred by any firm on behalf of the firm. If property of partnership firm is insufficient to meet liabilities, personal property of any partner can be attached to pay the debts of the firm.&lt;ref name="indiapartact"/&gt;

4) '''Partners are Mutual Agents'''.The business of firm can be carried on by all or any of them for all. Any partner has authority to bind the firm. Act of any one partner is binding on all the partners. Thus, each partner is ‘agent’ of all the remaining partners. Hence, partners are ‘mutual agents’. Section 18 of the Partnership Act, 1932 says "Subject to the provisions of this Act, a partner is the agent of the firm for the purpose of the business of the firm"&lt;ref name="indiapartact"/&gt;

5) '''Oral or Written Agreements'''. The Partnership Act, 1932 nowhere mentions that the Partnership Agreement is to be in written or oral format. Thus the general rule of the [[Indian Contract Act 1872|Contract Act]] applies that the contract can be 'oral' or 'written' as long as it satisfies the basic conditions of being a contract i.e. the agreement between partners is legally enforceable. A written agreement is advisable to establish existence of partnership and to prove rights and liabilities of each partner, as it is difficult to prove an oral agreement.&lt;ref name="indiapartact"/&gt;

6) '''Number of Partners is minimum 2 and maximum 50 in any kind of business activities'''.Since partnership is ‘agreement’ there must be minimum two partners. The Partnership Act does not put any restrictions on maximum number of partners. However, section 464 of Companies Act 2013, and Rule 10 of Companies (Miscellaneous) Rules, 2014 prohibits partnership consisting of more than 50 for any businesses, unless it is '''registered as a company''' under [[Companies Act 2013|Companies Act, 2013]] or formed in pursuance of some other law. Some other law means companies and corporations formed via some other law passed by [[Parliament of India]].

7) '''Mutual agency is the real test'''. The real test of ‘partnership firm’ is ‘mutual agency’ set by the Courts of India, i.e. whether a partner can bind the firm by his act, i.e. whether he can act as agent of all other partners.&lt;ref name="indiapartact"/&gt;

8) '''Global Safety Summit'''. The real test of ‘partnership firm’ is ‘mutual agency’ set by the public limited companies of India, i.e. whether a partner can bind the firm by his act, i.e. whether he can act as agent of all other partners.

===United Kingdom limited partnership===
{{Main|UK partnership law}}

A limited partnership in the United Kingdom consists of:

* One or more people called general partners, who are liable for all debts and obligations of the firm; and
* One or of the firm beyond the amount contributed.

Limited partners may not:

* Draw out or receive back any part of their contributions to the partnership during its lifetime; or
* Take part in the management of the business or have power to bind the firm.

If they do, they become liable for all the debts and obligations of the firm up to the amount drawn out or received back or incurred while taking part in the management, as the case may be.

===United States===

Under U.S. law a partnership is a business association of two or more individuals, through which partners share the profits and responsibility for the liabilities of their venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partnership|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/partnership|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. states recognize forms of limited partnership that may allow a partner who does not participate in the business venture to avoid liability for the partnership's debts and obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=What Is a Partnership|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/business/partnership.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=9 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partnerships typically pay less taxes than corporations in fields like fund management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/84075784-11a2-11e8-8cb6-b9ccc4c4dbbb|title=Private equity chiefs face conversion dilemma|last=Espinoza|first=Javier|last2=Indap|first2=Sujeet|date=2018-02-19|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-15/ares-switches-to-corporation-from-partnership-after-tax-overhaul|title=Ares Becomes Litmus Test for Buyout Firms Mulling Tax Change|date=2018-02-15|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal government of the United States does not have specific statutory law governing the establishment of partnerships. Instead, every U.S. state and the District of Columbia has its own statutes and common law that govern partnerships. The [[National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws]] has issued non-binding model laws (called uniform act) in which to encourage the adoption of uniformity of partnership law into the states by their respective legislatures. Model laws include the [[Uniform Partnership Act]] and the [[Uniform Limited Partnership Act]]. Most U.S. states have adopted a form of the [[Uniform Partnership Act]], which includes provisions reguating  [[general partnership]]s, [[limited partnership]]s and [[limited liability partnership]]s.

Although the federal government does not have specific statutory law for establishing partnerships, it has an extensive statutory and regulatory scheme for the [[Partnership taxation (USA)|taxation of partnerships]], set forth in the [[Internal Revenue Code]] (IRC) and [[Code of Federal Regulations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partnerships|url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/partnerships|website=IRS|publisher=Internal Revenue Service|accessdate=26 January 2018|date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IRC defines federal tax obligations for partnership operations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=26 U.S. Code, Subtite A, Chapter 1, Subchapter K - Partners and Partnerships|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/subtitle-A/chapter-1/subchapter-K|website=Legal Information Institute|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that effectively serve as federal regulation of some aspects of partnerships.

The '''Peale Museum''', officially the '''Municipal Museum of the City of Baltimore''', was a [[museum]] of [[paintings]] and [[natural history]], located in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], United States. It occupied the first building in the [[Americas|Western Hemisphere]] to be designed and built specifically as a museum.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv1"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=66000915}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination: Peale's Baltimore Museum|last=Mendinghall|first=Joseph S.|date=February 28, 1975|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum was created by [[Charles Willson Peale]] (1741–1827) and his son [[Rembrandt Peale]] (1778–1860). It functioned separately as Baltimore City's historical museum since the original structure was being rebuilt, restored, and renovated in 1930–1931, and then merged with other historic sites, houses and museums in the early 1980s under the expansive efforts of a new executive director, with the name of the '''Baltimore City Life Museums''' and a broader mission in conjunction with the other historical locations/sites/structures in Baltimore.

After opening a new three-story exhibition gallery, uniquely using the old cast-iron façade of the razed (but placed in storage in a city yard for 30 years) Fava Fruit Company and being re-assembled on the new structure facing North Front Street and the parallel new President Street boulevard (between East Lombard and East Fayette streets), the new gallery and the B.C.L.M. ran into financial difficulties in the first year (1996–1997) after the grand opening, coincidentally during the bicentennial celebration of Baltimore's establishment as a city. The Peale branch of the City Life Museums closed with the other branches, historic houses and sites later in 1997, after being refused a one-year extension of its five-year subsidy of about $300,000 annually by then Mayor [[Kurt Schmoke]]. Its large collections from over 66 years of original existence were disassembled, transferred and handed over to the [[Maryland Historical Society]], founded 1844, now located on the city block on the southwest corner of West Monument Street and Park Avenue, centered in the old [[Enoch Pratt]] Mansion and adjacent research library and museum exhibition areas building.&lt;ref name="mhs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdhs.org/library/collections/bclmphoto/bclm.shtml|title=Baltimore City Life Museum Photo Collection|publisher=Maryland Historical Society|accessdate=2009-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="nhlsum" /&gt;

Today, the museum is being renovated and relaunched as the Peale Center for Baltimore History and Architecture through a partnership between Baltimore's Department of General Services, which owns the building, and the Board of the Peale Center for Baltimore History and Architecture, a [[501(c)(3)]] tax-exempt, non-profit corporation. It is currently open to the public for special events and anticipates being fully reopened by 2020.

==History==
[[Charles Willson Peale]] (1741–1827) received his inspiration for a public museum in 1783 while illustrating [[mastodon]] [[fossil]]s belonging to Dr. [[John Morgan (physician)|John Morgan]]. Once he had conceived the idea for an American museum of natural history, Peale opened a museum to the public in [[Philadelphia]] on July 18, 1786. In 1810, Peale retired from his work with the museum, leaving its management and responsibility to his sons. Later in 1814, a museum was established at 225 North Holliday Street between East Saratoga and East Lexington streets in Baltimore by [[Rembrandt Peale]] (1778–1860), the second son of Charles Willson Peale. It was dubbed as "Peale's Baltimore Museum and Gallery of Fine Arts" and featured [[portrait]]s of famous Americans (many by the founder) and the complete skeleton of a prehistoric mastodon exhumed by C.W. Peale in 1801.

In 1830, the old Peale Museum was sold and the exhibits were moved to a newly constructed building on the northwest corner of [[Calvert Street (Baltimore)|North Calvert Street]] and East Baltimore Street, one block south of the [[Battle Monument|Battle Monument Square]] and the [[Baltimore City Circuit Courthouses|Baltimore City Courthouse]]. By 1830, the historic building became home to Baltimore's first "City Hall" and remained there through the tumultuous [[American Civil War|Civil War]] years until 1875 when replaced by the current [[Baltimore City Hall]], which had been under construction since 1867 one block south, on the 200 block of Holliday Street. The massive new municipal government offices of [[Second Empire architecture|French Second Empire]]-style architecture, with its distinctive mansard roofs and large dome and clock, now occupied an entire city block bounded by Holliday, East Lexington, East Fayette and North streets (now Guilford Avenue), one block south at the 200 block of Holliday between East Lexington and Fayette streets.

The old museum and City Hall was then turned over to the city's Board of School Commissioners and the [[Baltimore City Public Schools]] and became the Number 1 Colored Primary School (as there was a number of then-called "Negro" or "Colored" institutions, churches, law firms and businesses in the areas around East Pleasant, Saratoga, East Lexington and along [[St. Paul Street (Baltimore)|St. Paul Street]] and North Calvert streets). Later it was rented out to a series of private businesses.

By 1928, it had been repeatedly condemned and was in danger of demolition. With the inspiration of newly-emergent, local historians and journalists, who had just celebrated the centennial of the "[[Star Spangled Banner]]" (future [[national anthem]]) and the [[Battle of Baltimore]] with its Bombardment of [[Fort McHenry]] and resulted in the saving of the old 1793 rowhouse at East Pratt and Albemarle streets in the [[Jonestown, Baltimore|Jonestown/Old Town]] and [[Little Italy, Baltimore|Little Italy]] neighborhoods, owned and lived in by [[Mary Pickersgill|Mary Young Pickersgill]], (1776–1857) who made the huge "[[Star Spangled Banner Flag]]", the restoration of the old "Flag House" and setting up of a historical museum there in 1927 boosted the hopes, political power and determination of the preservationists. So the restoration of the old museum took place with an expense of $90,000. The building was renovated and rededicated in 1931 as the Municipal Museum of Baltimore. The museum underwent a major two-year renovation starting in 1978 and was reopened in 1981 as the Peale Museum. In 1985, the Peale became part of the Baltimore City Life Museums system until its closure in 1997.
 
The entire Peale collection has been moved to the [[Maryland Historical Society]], leaving the original building on North Holliday Street vacant.

As of April 2014, a campaign was being waged by a Maryland group to raise $4&amp;nbsp;million for restoration of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-04-04/news/bs-md-ci-peale-museum-20140326_1_peale-center-peale-museum-lewis-museum |title=New life envisioned for old Peale Museum downtown |last=Wenger |first=Yvonne |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=April 4, 2014 |accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is located between [[Zion Lutheran Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|Zion Lutheran Church]] and offices for ''[[The Real News]]''.

'''Performance-based advertising''', also known as [[pay for performance advertising]], is a form of [[advertising]] in which the purchaser pays only when there are measurable results. Performance-based advertising is becoming more common with the spread of [[electronic media]], notably the [[Internet]], where it is possible to measure user actions resulting from advertisement.

== Pricing models ==
There are four common pricing models used in the online performance advertising market.

[[Cost per impression|CPM (cost-per-mille, or cost-per-thousand)]] pricing models charge advertisers for impressions, i.e. the number of times people view an advertisement. [[Display advertising]] is commonly sold on a CPM pricing model. The problem with CPM advertising is that advertisers are charged even if the target audience does not click on the advertisement.

[[Pay per click|CPC (cost-per-click)]] advertising overcomes this problem by charging advertisers only when the consumer clicks on the advertisement. However, due to increased competition, [[search engine technology|search]] [[Index term|keywords]] have become very expensive. A 2007 [[Doubleclick]] Performics Search trends Report shows that there were nearly six times as many keywords with a [[cost per click]] (CPC) of more than $1 in January 2007 than the prior year. The cost per keyword increased by 33% and the cost per click rose by as much as 55%.

In recent times, there has been a rapid increase in online lead generation – banner and direct response advertising that works off a CPL pricing model. In a cost-per-lead pricing model, advertisers pay only for qualified leads – irrespective of the clicks or impressions that went into generating the lead. CPL advertising is also commonly referred to as [[online lead generation]].

[[Cost per lead]] (CPL) pricing models are the most advertiser friendly. A recent [[IBM]] research study{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} found that two-thirds of senior marketers expect 20 percent of [[Advertising|ad]] [[revenue]] to move away from impression-based sales, in favor of action-based models within three years. CPL models allow advertisers to pay only for qualified leads as opposed to clicks or impressions and are at the pinnacle of the online advertising ROI hierarchy.

In [[Cost per action|CPA advertising]], advertisers pay for a specific action such as a [[credit card]] [[Financial transaction|transaction]] (also called CPO, cost-per-order).

Advertisers need to be careful when choosing between CPL and CPA pricing models.

In CPL campaigns, advertisers pay for an interested lead – i.e. the contact information of a person interested in the advertiser's product or service. CPL campaigns are suitable for brand marketers and direct response marketers looking to engage consumers at multiple touch-points – by building a [[newsletter]] list, community site, [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] [[programme management|program]] or member acquisition program.

In CPA campaigns, the advertiser typically pays for a completed sale involving a credit card transaction. CPA is all about 'now' – it focuses on driving consumers to buy at that exact moment. If a visitor to the website doesn't buy anything, there's no easy way to re-market to them.

There are other important differentiators:

# CPL campaigns are advertiser-centric. The advertiser remains in control of their brand, selecting trusted and contextually relevant publishers to run their offers. On the other hand, CPA and affiliate marketing campaigns are publisher-centric. Advertisers cede control over where their brand will appear, as publishers browse offers and pick which to run on their websites. Advertisers generally do not know where their offer is running.
# CPL campaigns are usually high volume and light-weight. In CPL campaigns, consumers submit only basic [[contact (social)|contact]] [[information]]. The transaction can be as simple as an [[email address]]. On the other hand, CPA campaigns are usually low volume and complex. Typically, consumer has to submit credit card and other detailed information.

CPL advertising is more appropriate for advertisers looking to deploy acquisition campaigns by re-marketing to end consumers through e-newsletters, community sites, reward programs, [[loyalty programs]] and other engagement vehicles.

== Economic benefits ==
Many advertisers have limited budgets and may not understand the most effective method of advertising.  
With performance-based advertising plans, they avoid the risk of paying large amounts for advertisements that are ineffective.  They pay only for results.

The advertising agency, distributor or publisher assumes the risk, and is therefore motivated to ensure that
the advertisement is well-targeted, making best use of the available inventory of advertising space.
Electronic media publishers may choose advertisements based on location, time of day, day of week, demographics and performance history,
ensuring that they maximize revenue earned from each advertising slot.

The close attention to targeting is intended to minimize the number of irrelevant advertisements presented to consumers.
They see advertisements for products and services that are likely to interest them.
Although consumers often state that advertisements are irritating, in many situations they find the advertisement useful  if they are relevant.

== Metrics ==
Various types of measurable action may be used in charging for performance-based advertising:

* Many Internet sites charge for advertising on a "CPM" (cost per thousand) or [[cost per impression]] basis.  That is, the advertiser pays only when a consumer sees their advertisement.  Some would argue that this is not performance-based advertising since there is no measurement of the user response.
* Internet sites often also offer advertising on a "PPC" ([[pay per click]]) basis.  [[Google]]'s [[AdWords]] product and equivalent products from [[Millennial Media]], [[Yahoo!]], [[Microsoft]] and others support PPC advertising plans. 
* A small but growing number of sites are starting to offer plans on a "Pay per call" basis.  The user can click a button to place a [[VoIP]] call, or to request a call from the advertiser.  If the user requests a call, presumably they are highly likely to make a purchase.
* Finally, there is considerable research into methods of linking the user's actions to the eventual purchase: the ideal form of performance measurement.

Some Internet sites are markets, bringing together buyers and sellers.  [[eBay]] is a prominent example of a market operating on an auction basis.  Other market sites let the vendors set their price.  In either model, the market mediates sales and takes a commission – a defined percentage of the sale value.  The market is motivated to give a more prominent position to vendors who achieve high sales value.  Markets may be seen as a form of performance-based advertising.

The use of mobile coupons also enables a whole new world of metrics within identifying campaign effect. There are several providers of mobile coupon technology that makes it possible to provide unique coupons or barcodes to each individual person and at the same time identify the person downloading it. This makes it possible to follow these individuals during the whole process from downloading until when and where the coupons are redeemed.

== Media ==

Although the Internet introduced the concept of performance-based advertising, it is now spreading into other media.

The [[mobile telephone]] is increasingly used as a web browsing device, and can support both [[Pay per click|pay-per-click]] and pay-per-call plans.
Coupons delivered to the mobile handset can be used to link advertising direct to sales.
As consumers start to use their mobile handset as an electronic payment device, it may become practical to establish direct linkage between advertising and purchases.
The linkage may be indirect.
A consumer may use their mobile phone to scan a barcode on an outdoor advertisement.  
This loads the advertiser's mobile site onto the phone.
When the consumer shortly afterwards goes to the advertiser's store and uses their phone to make a purchase, the linkage can be inferred.

[[Directory assistance]] providers are starting to introduce advertising, particularly with "Free DA" services such as the [[Jingle Networks]] [[1-800-FREE-411]], the [[AT&amp;T]] 1-800-YELLOWPAGES and the (now-defunct) [[Google]] 1-800-GOOG-411.  
The advertiser pays when a caller listens to their advertisement, the equivalent of Internet CPM advertising, when they ask for additional information, or when they place a call.

[[IPTV]] promises to eventually combine features of [[cable television]] and the Internet.
Viewers may see advertisements in a sidebar that are relevant to the show they are watching.
They may click on an advertisement to obtain more details, and this action can be measured and used to charge the advertiser.

It is even possible to directly measure the performance of print advertising. The publisher prints a special telephone number in the advertisement, used nowhere else. When a consumer places a call to that number, the call event is recorded and the call is routed to the regular number. In theory, the call could only have been generated because of the print advertisement. In practice, there is the risk that an inadvertent third party will find a number from an advertisement and submit it to an online or printed directory, causing it to receive additional calls for which the advertiser must pay individually as "leads" or enquiries. Some of the received calls may be misdirected product support requests from existing clients or even enquiries from suppliers, which are not new revenue and should not be counted as new leads. [[Toll-free telephone number]]s are also notoriously prone to [[misdialed call|misdials]] which a company must pay to receive - often because a little-used number is one digit away from a major airline, hotel chain, hire car firm, bank or national franchise operator.

== Pricing ==

A publisher may charge defined prices for performance-based advertising, so much per click or call, but it is common for prices to be set through some form of "bidding" or auction arrangement.
The advertiser states how much they are willing to pay for a user action, and the publisher provides feedback on how much other advertisers have offered.  The actual amount paid may be lower than the amount bid, for example 1 cent more than the next highest bidder.

A "bidding" plan does not guarantee that the highest bidder will always be presented in the most prominent advertising slot, or will gain the most user actions.
The publisher will want to earn the maximum revenue from each advertising slot, and may decide (based on actual results) that a lower bidder is likely to 
bring more revenue than a higher bidder - they will pay less but be selected more often.

In a competitive market, with many advertisers and many publications, defined prices and bid-based prices are likely to converge on the generally accepted value of an advertising action.  This  presumably reflects the expected sale value and the profit that will result from the sale.  An item like a hotel room or airplane seat that loses all value if not sold may be priced at a higher ratio of sale value than an item like a bag of sand or box of nails that will retain its value over time.

A number of companies provide products or services to help optimize the bidding process, including deciding which keywords the advertiser should bid on and which sites will give best performance.

Other companies that offer straightforward pay for performance lead generation services, offer performance based pricing related to the quality or quantity of the lead.

== Issues ==

There is the potential for fraud in performance-based advertising.

* The publication may report excessive performance results, although a reputable publication would be unlikely to take the risk of being exposed by audit.
* A competitor may arrange for automatically generated clicks on an advertisement

Since the user's actions are being measured, there are serious concerns of loss of privacy.

Performance-based advertising mechanisms induce firms to distort the prices of their goods (usually upwards) relative to prices that would maximize profits in settings where advertising is sold under established pay-per-impression methods. Upward price distortions reduce both consumer surplus and the joint publisher-advertiser profit, leading to a net reduction in social welfare. Dellarocas (2010) discusses a number of ways in which performance-based advertising mechanisms can be enhanced to restore efficient pricing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6484">'''Richard Franklin Bache''', also known as '''Richard Bache Jr.''' (1784–1848), was a military and political official in the [[Republic of Texas|Republic]] and [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Texas]]. He assisted in drafting the [[Texas Constitution|Texas Constitution of 1845]], the first of its five state constitutions.

==Biography==

===Early life and ancestors===
Bache was born on March 11, 1784, at [[Philadelphia]], the son of [[Richard Bache]] Sr., a marine insurance underwriter and importer. Bache Sr. had also served as [[United States Postmaster General]] from 1776 to 1782. About 1819, he was the publisher of the ''Franklin Gazette,'' a democratic newspaper in Philadelphia, along with [[John Norvell]].  John Norvell founded the ''[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' after leaving the Gazette and later moved to Michigan, where he was elected as one of the new state's first U.S. Senators.

Richard's mother was [[Sarah Franklin Bache]] (September 11, 1743 – October 5, 1808), known as Sally, the only daughter of [[Benjamin Franklin]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], and his common-law wife, [[Deborah Read]].

Richard grew up in a large family of eight. Among his siblings were his older brother, [[Benjamin Franklin Bache (journalist)|Benjamin Franklin Bache]], a controversial newspaper publisher who died of [[yellow fever]] at the age of 29. One of Richard's nephews was [[Andrew A. Harwood]], a naval officer who reached the rank of admiral.

===Education===
Bache was educated in local schools as a boy. He attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]], graduating in 1812.

===Marriage and family===
On April 4, 1805, Bache married Sophia Burrell Dallas, the daughter of Arabella Maria Smith and [[Alexander J. Dallas (statesman)|Alexander J. Dallas]]. Her father later was appointed as the [[U.S. Treasury Secretary]] under President [[James Madison]].

Richard and Sophia had nine children together:
* [[Alexander Dallas Bache]] (1806–1867)
* Mary Blechenden Bache (1808–1873), married [[Robert John Walker]], who was appointed [[Secretary of the Treasury]] under President [[James Knox Polk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dUwUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA359&amp;lpg=PA359&amp;dq=robert+j.+walker+and+mississppi+historical+socity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sqyV5peZZq&amp;sig=e2QDNpzsceMFfIg1ob1DcRFgkPE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1cMWSoe1C4fQswPp7JHbCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 |title=Publications of the Mississippi ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-10-20 |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* George Mifflin Bache (1811–1846), whose son was [[George M. Bache|George Mifflin Bache Jr.]]
* Richard Bache III (1813–1850)
* Sophia Arabella Bache (1815–1904), who married [[William W. Irwin|William Wallace Irwin]], later [[Mayor of Pittsburgh]] and elected as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] member of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[Pennsylvania]].
* Matilda Wilkins Bache (1819–1900), who married [[William H. Emory]], later a United States Army general and surveyor of Texas.
* Henrietta Constantia Bache (1822–1887)
* Sarah Franklin Bache (1824–1880), who married [[Richard Wainwright (American Civil War naval officer)|Richard Wainwright]], a naval officer during the [[American Civil War]]
* Maria Campbell Bache (1827–1851)

===Career===
He served as a captain of the Franklin Flying Artillery of the Philadelphia Volunteers in the [[War of 1812]]. He also served in the [[United States Navy]]. He was later appointed as postmaster for Philadelphia.

In 1832 Bache abandoned his family, with likely five children still at home and three under the age of ten, and moved to Texas, possibly for financial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;possibly because fifty thousand dollars of funds of the office of postmaster of Philadelphia could not be accounted for&lt;/ref&gt; He settled in [[Stephen F. Austin]]’s colony at Brazoria. He served on the ''[[Texan schooner Zavala|Zavala]]'' in the [[Texas Navy]]. On May 1, 1836, he joined the Louisiana Independent Volunteers, commanded by J. J. Robinson, who were supporting the [[Texas War of Independence]]. While in service, he guarded the Mexican general [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] after the [[Battle of San Jacinto]].

In 1838-39 he served as chief clerk in the Navy Department at Houston. He was appointed as enrolling clerk of the House of Representatives in the Third Congress of the [[Texas Republic]].

In 1842 Bache settled in [[Galveston, Texas]], where he afterward held a number of appointed government posts of trust and responsibility. He became commissioner of the navy yard, and was appointed as collector of customs, and later as a justice of the peace for Galveston County. In 1845, he was elected as a delegate to the [[Texas Annexation]] Convention. He was the only elected official to vote against annexation, allegedly because he did not wish to enlarge the domain of his brother-in-law, [[George M. Dallas]], then vice-president of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DUeG7iobgI4C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;lpg=PA187&amp;dq=%22richard+bache%22+and+texas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wkDQ0rd3O1&amp;sig=Fgc8zdc9X-5GgL1NFEvwwxpufeg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0j9CS9KONYGSsgPXuO3WAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAgQ6AEwADgo#v=onepage&amp;q=%22richard%20bache%22%20and%20texas&amp;f=false |title=The Texas Senate: Republic to Civil ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped draft the Constitution of 1845. He was elected twice, to the First and Second Texas Legislatures, representing Galveston in the [[Texas Senate, District 11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lura N.

===Death===
He died in [[Austin, Texas]], on March 17, 1848, and is buried at [[Oakwood Cemetery (Austin, Texas)|Oakwood Cemetery]], located in central Austin. It is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

'''Réseau Canopé''' is a French public institution under the supervision of the [[French Ministry of Education]]. As the publishing arm of the  National Education service, it performs editing, production and dissemination of educational and administrative resources for professional education. It contributes to the development of [[Educational technology|information and communication technologies in education]] (ICTs) as well as artistic and cultural education. "Canopé" stands for ''Conception et accompagnement des nouvelles offres pour l'éducation'' ("Design and Support of New Offers for Education").

In 2014, it replaced the '''National Centre for Educational Documentation''' (''Centre national de documentation pédagogique'', CNDP) and its regional (CRDP) and departmental (CDDP) branches. These and a few other institutions formed the SCÉRÉN network (''Services, Culture, Éditions, Ressources pour l'Éducation nationale'': "Services, Culture, Publishing, Resources for National Education").

The network also includes:
* the [[Centre de liaison de l'enseignement et des médias d'information]] (Clemi);
* the [[Centre de ressources et d’information sur les multimédias pour l’enseignement supérieur]] (Cerimes);
* the National Education Museum.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19297">'''Wall Street West''' is a name used by [[Real estate development|real estate developers]], [[City manager|city officials]] and [[news media]] in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hampson|first=Rick|title=Model of urban future: Jersey City?|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-15-jersey-city_N.htm|accessdate=10 March 2013|newspaper=USA Today|date=16 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; to call particular streets or places west of [[Manhattan]] that have a high concentration of [[Wall Street]] companies or a major [[Trade|exchange]]. The most notable for that is along the waterfront of [[Jersey City, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=businessweek&gt;{{cite news|title=Jersey City: "Wall Street West"|url=http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2001-10-28/jersey-city-wall-street-west|accessdate=10 March 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg Business Week Magazine|date=28 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those locations in the [[Western United States]], the name "'''Wall Street of the West'''" has been used in the latter part of the 19th century. [[Montgomery Street]] in [[San Francisco]] has been known by that nickname to date.&lt;ref name=1906-san-francisco&gt;{{cite book|last=Prentice|first=Carol S.|title=1906 San Francisco Earthquake Centennial Field Guides: Field Trips Associated With the 100th Anniversary Conference, 18-23 April 2006, San Francisco, California|date=28 February 2006|publisher=Geological Society of America|isbn=9780813700076|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CwchZE54dWYC&amp;|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A couple of other places were known by that name for a period of time and that was faded away when the industry moved out to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Cecil|title=TV Taking Stock of 1929 Crash|accessdate=10 March 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=22 Jul 1980|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/665093492.html?dids=665093492:665093492&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jul+22%2C+1980&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=TV+TAKING+STOCK+OF+1929+CRASH&amp;pqatl=google|page=G1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wall Street of the West==
[[Image:Montgomerystreetsf.jpg|thumbnail|200px|Montgomery Street in San Francisco's financial district.]]
The Montgomery Street in San Francisco started its transformation from the street with wood shacks, warehouses and retail stores in the 1850s. By the 1870s, more notable buildings were constructed to replace the old wood shacks and the [[mudflat|mud flats]].&lt;ref name=1906-san-francisco/&gt; The street continued to develop from that point with financial services companies located in that area. The Montgomery Street has been known as "Wall Street of the West" to date. The [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]] has been expanded to cover the triangular area east of Grant Avenue, south of Washington Street, west of the [[Embarcadero (San Francisco)|Embarcadero]]. In 2012, when the [[Occupy movement]] had a protest at the [[Financial District, San Francisco|San Francisco's Financial District]] as a continuation of [[Occupy San Francisco]], the protesters went through the financial district under the banner ''Occupy Wall Street West''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Occupy Wall Street West: New Movement Rises In San Francisco|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/18/occupy-wall-street-west_n_1214407.html|accessdate=9 March 2013|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; giving the shorter name of the financial district than its typical name as Wall Street of the West.

For [[Denver]], Colorado, the city started picking up some shares of commercial buildings in the late 19th century. There was a push by the local politicians to transform its Seventeenth Street to become the "Wall Street of the Denver" as seen in an 1892 pamphlet in promoting the [[Equitable Building (Denver, Colorado)|Equitable Building]] by the [[AXA Equitable Life Insurance Company|Equitable Life Assurance Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spirits and Scandals on 17th and Stout Streets|url=http://coloradowest.auraria.edu/content/equitable-building|publisher=Center of the Colorado &amp; the West at Auraria Library|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other buildings were constructed at other corners of the 17th Street such as the [[Boston Building]] in 1890 and the Ideal Cement Building in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wall Street of the Rockies|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=4659|publisher=HMdb.org The Historical Marker Database|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, the 17th Street had been referred as "Wall Street of the West".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gentry|first=Garland|title=Denver's Famous Street Lighting|journal=Public Service|date=July 1908|volume=V|issue=1|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBApAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Colorado National Bank (First National Bank) was constructed in 1911, it reaffirmed its central business district's Wall Street status. The 17th Street was also called "Wall Street of the Rockies" at a later time as it attracted other premier financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Resources of Downtown Denver|url=http://www.historycolorado.org/sites/default/files/files/OAHP/crforms_edumat/pdfs/646.pdf|work=National Register of Historic Places|publisher=United States Department of the Interior National Park Service|accessdate=20 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Los Angeles]] also picked up a fair share of financial companies starting in the early part of the 1900s. The new financial buildings were concentrating along South Spring Street. The title of "Wall Street of the West" was used and the [[Spring Street Financial District]] was born. The district continued to flourish for many decades until the 1960s when companies started shifting toward the western part of the downtown area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Sitton (Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History)|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form: Spring Street Financial District, at page 8|publisher=Los Angeles Conservancy web site|date=July 1977|url=http://www.laconservancy.org/initiatives/Spring%20St%20Nomination%20PDF.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1980s, many buildings were empty and the Spring Street showed no sign of its past as one of the financial centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rafter|first=Michelle|title=Spring Hopes Eternal|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997/nov/05/business/fi-50374/2|accessdate=10 March 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=5 November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fort Worth, Texas]] was known as the "Wall Street of the West" starting in the early 1900s similarly to Los Angeles's South Spring Street. However, it was not the financial companies that gave [[Fort Worth Stockyards]] its Wall Street name, but the [[livestock]] trading. In 1902, the Livestock Exchange Building was constructed to house many livestock commission companies, [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] offices, railroad offices and other support businesses. The business grew to the peak at 1944 which processed 5,277,496 head of livestock. After that year, the livestock exchange business started to decline until its low point in 1986. The Livestock Exchange Building is now a historical site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A History of the  Fort Worth Stockyards|url=http://www.stockyardsmuseum.org/index_files/StockYardsHistory.htm|publisher=stockyards Museum|accessdate=10 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jersey City==
[[Image:Jersey City.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Southern part of the Wall Street West in Jersey City]]
In the 1980s, some financial companies started moving from [[Manhattan]] to the west of the [[Hudson River]] to settle in the waterfront area of [[Jersey City, New Jersey]]. The area earned the name of "Wall Street West" after [[Bankers Trust]] had a major relocation to Jersey City in 1985. Other major financial firms followed shortly after with [[National Westminster Bank|National Westminster Bank of London]] building its domestic subsidiary there. [[Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette]] (DLJ) moved into a new 20-story building in the [[Exchange Place (Jersey City)|Exchange Place area]]. The new [[Harborside Financial Center]] were built with anticipation of more relocations. [[Daiwa Securities Group|Daiwa Securities]], [[Royal Bank of Canada]], and [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] were planning to have their major workforce there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Winston|title=On the Jersey City Docks, Wall St. West|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/28/nyregion/on-the-jersey-city-docks-wall-st-west.html|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 October 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major development in Exchange Place started with a plan to redevelop the 34-acre former [[Colgate-Palmolive]] soap factory in 1988.

On the northern side of Jersey City's waterfront, another major development called [[Newport, Jersey City|Newport]] was started in the late 1980s. It was planned as a mixed-use community with office, residential and retail buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hevesi|first=Dennis|title=On the Hudson, a City Within Jersey City|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/13/realestate/on-the-hudson-a-city-within-jersey-city.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=20 May 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early 2001, Newport had gained major tenants including [[UBS]], [[Knight Capital]], and [[Insurance Services Office]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Herman|first=Eric|title=UBS Nears Jersey City Office Lease|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/money/ubs-nears-jersey-city-office-lease-article-1.910855|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=NY Daily News|date=13 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Knight/Trimark Group Signs Lease for New World Headquarters at Newport|url=http://www.knight.com/investorRelations/pressReleases.asp?compid=105070&amp;releaseID=93436|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=Knight Press Release|date=17 May 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Construction of ISO Commercial Tower/Newport IV Building Ahead of Schedule|url=http://listings.cushwake.com/us/cw/News/media.cfm?artcl_id=666|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=Cushman Wakefield Press Release|date=22 February 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, the "Wall Street West" expanded to include the entire waterfront area from Newport to Exchange Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cadenilla|first=William|title=The Sixth Borough|url=http://www.jerseycityonline.com/jcedc/sixth_borough.htm|publisher=Jersey City Economic Development Corporation|accessdate=21 May 2013|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[September 11 attacks]], there were renewed interests from financial firms to diversify their workforce to be outside of Manhattan. At the same time, there were immediate needs to find office space for misplaced workers who used to work in the [[Lower Manhattan]] area. Office space in Jersey City's waterfront became boom again due to its proximity to Lower Manhattan and the ferry services which were not affected by the attacks.&lt;ref name=marketwatch&gt;{{cite news|last=Gelsi|first=Steve|title=Wall Street moves west|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wall-street-builds-waterfront-presence-in-jersey-city|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=Market Watch|date=9 February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of September 2001, ten of the largest 18 firms from the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] area including [[American Express]] and [[Deutsche Bank]] moved some of their operations to Jersey City.&lt;ref name=businessweek/&gt; [[Goldman Sachs]] at the time were planning to move its headquarters to the new building being constructed in Jersey City.&lt;ref name=marketwatch/&gt;

The boom since 2001 had been short live. By 2007, the vacancy rate had increased and some financial firms had scaled down their plans. UBS changed their plan not to fully occupy the newly constructed building. Goldman Sachs only partially occupied its building and planned to build a new headquarters in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kornreich|first=Leron|title=therealdeal.com/issues_articles/nj-waterfront-vacancies-remain-high/|url=http://therealdeal.com/issues_articles/nj-waterfront-vacancies-remain-high/|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=The Real Deal|date=17 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wall Street West suffered further by the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]]. The office space vacancy rate spiked up as investment bank tenants started collapsing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Jersey's `Wall Street West' Quakes Amid Namesake's Turmoil|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ajRX_QI2ODtw&amp;refer=home|accessdate=21 May 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg|date=17 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The downturn economy had dampen the real estate growth in this area for many years.

As the economy started to slowly recover between 2011 and 2012, large leases started to pick up again especially in the Newport area with major financial institutions such as [[Citigroup]] and [[Fidelity Investments]]. [[Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation]] also moved the majority of its workforce from Manhattan to Jersey City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hughes|first=C.

Currently, the "Wall Street West" employment contributes to one third of the [[private sector]] jobs in Jersey City. Within the Financial Service cluster, there are three major sectors: more than 60 percent are in the [[Security (finance)|securities industry]]; 20 percent are in [[bank]]ing; and 8 percent in [[insurance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Gateway to Opportunity, Enterprise Zone Five Year Strategic Plan 2010|url=http://www.jcedc.org/Pages/JerseyCity%20UEZ_Economics.pdf|publisher=Jersey City Economic Development Corporation|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the September 11 attacks, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], the [[Federal Reserve]] and the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] recommended that the data backup facilities of Wall Street firms should be moved away from New York City with  a different [[power grid]], transportation network and [[Drainage basin|watershed]] than New York. In 2006, Governor of Pennsylvania, [[Ed Rendell]], announced the creation of "Wall Street West" initiative to attract 20 potential Wall Street firms to move their backup facilities to [[Northeastern Pennsylvania]] in nine counties:Northampton, Berks, Monroe, Carbon, Pike, Wayne, Luzerne and Lackawanna. He also pledged to invest in office space construction, infrastructure improvement and installation of [[fiber optic]] from New York City to the region. The region was chosen as it was still within the {{convert|125|mi}} from Manhattan which was considered far enough to sustain major disaster but still within the range of instantaneous data transmission via fiber optic. The first project was Penn Regional Business Center in Monroe County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rubinkam|first=Michael|title=Pa. Wants to Become 'Wall Street West'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/08/AR2006100800378.html|accessdate=27 May 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=8 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the initiative, Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Northeast Pennsylvania (BFTP/NEP), a state-funded economic development network, worked closely with the Pennsylvania Department of [[Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry|Labor and Industry]] and [[Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development|Community and Economic Development]] to develop a proposal for the federal grants through [[Workforce Innovation in Regional Economic Development]] (WIRED). The management was later turned to an independent unit called [[Wall Street West (organization)|Wall Street West]] with a 17-member Executive Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Early Implementation of Generation I WIRED Initiative  2007 Site Visit Highlights Wall Street West WIRED|url=http://wdr.doleta.gov/research/FullText_Documents/Appendix%20A%205-21-08.pdf|publisher=Berkeley Policy Associates|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, the initiative received an $8 million commitment from [[Level 3 Communications]] for a $40 million project to build a new fiber optic network from Manhattan to [[East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania|East Stroudsburg]] with a branched-off network in [[Warren County, New Jersey|Warren County]] in New Jersey. This was to address the shortcoming of direct high-speed communication which was required by Wall Street firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Rich|title=Wall Street West Gets Level 3 Link|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2007/06/13/wall-street-west-gets-level-3-link/|accessdate=27 May 2013|newspaper=Data Center Knowledge|date=13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by June 2008, the initiative was unable to attract any Wall Street firm to the region with an exception of one financial services related company. A company which hosted compliance solutions for financial services opened its new data center in the region with 10 job creation. By that time, Level 3 Communications indicated that it would not build the fiber optic link unless more financial services firms commit to locate in the region and buy services from them. Part of the difficulties in attracting more companies was that many financial institutions were more comfortable with the shorter range of {{convert|70|km}} from Manhattan which caused many financial firms to build out their new data centers in [[Central Jersey]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Rich|title=Why Wall Street West Has Struggled|url=http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2008/05/26/why-wall-street-west-has-struggled/|accessdate=27 May 2013|newspaper=Data Center Knowledge|date=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Without a commitment from financial services companies, the decision was made in 2009 to expand the Wall Street West mission to include healthcare, [[Materials science|advanced materials]] and diversified manufacturing, and [[logistics]] and transportation industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bringing Energy to Economic Development - Annual Report 2009|url=http://nep.benfranklin.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/BFTP-NEP_2009_annual_report.pdf|publisher=Ben Franklin Technology Partners of Northeastern Pennsylvania|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waste Industries''' is a provider of non-hazardous [[solid waste]] and [[recycling]] collection, transfer, and disposal company in the southeast United States. The company has over 1.9 million service points.

The company is dedicated to creating a better world through its Full Circle Project. In 2007, Waste Industries also began the process of reducing its number of [[diesel fuel|diesel]] trucks with compressed natural gas powered trucks.

On October 10, 2018, the company announced its intentions to merge with a Canadian company for an undisclosed amount. The company will continue to operate as Waste Industries in the US and will be headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article219777470.html?#emlnl=Breaking_Newsletter&amp;id=c25vd2Nvb2w3NzZAZ21haWwuY29t|title=Raleigh’s Waste Industries merging with Canadian company|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Company history==
Waste Industries was created as a waste disposal firm in 1970 by [[Lonnie Poole Jr.]] who used funds from the sale of his Ohio home and borrowed money from Gregory Poole, Owner of a local construction company, to create the company.  The initial idea of Waste Industries stemmed from market research Poole conducted, while concepting a new mobile [[landfill]] [[compactor]] while he was living in Ohio. His compactor idea failed, but Poole soon discovered his calling, and started Waste Industries in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/waste-industries-usa-inc/ North Carolina History Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few years, of stagnation, the company grew in the 1970s and quickly expanded past Wake county and the city of Raleigh. By 1980 the company had reached ten million dollars in revenue and soon after, they named their first employee, Jim Perry, as President and Chief Operating Officer.

In 1997, with an estimated revenue of $100 million, Waste Industries went public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=442466 Nasdaq Filing]&lt;/ref&gt; The company continued to grow that year with an estimated 20 branches, 11 transfer stations and 4 recycling facilities under its belt.

In 2000 Waste Industries went through a tech revolution and updated its website. With the website upgrade they also became the first company on the east-coast to incorporate [[e-billing]] for waste pick-up customers. 
In 2008, the company went private again and experienced a restructuring in its management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.thomasnet.com/companystory/waste-industries-usa-inc-announces-agreement-to-go-private-for-38-00-per-share-808189 ThomasNet News]&lt;/ref&gt; Vern Poole, son of original owner Lonnie Poole and long-time company leader, would become Chairman and CEO and would create his personal board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2008/12/29/daily24.html Triangle Business Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; Greg Yorston would later become Chief Operating Office,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waste360.com/personnel-moves/waste-industries-names-yorston-chief-operating-officer Waste 360 News]&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Grissiom Chief Financial Officer, and Lisa Inman Senior Vice President and General Counsel.

In 2010, [[North Carolina State University]] unveiled a wall display highlighting original Waste Industries founder Lonnie Poole as well as the progress Waste Industries has made over the years as it has grown.&lt;ref&gt;[https://poole.ncsu.edu/index-exp.php/news/article/poole-college-installs-wall-display-to-honor-benefactor-lonnie-c.-poole-jr NC State University Board]&lt;/ref&gt;  Poole is a longtime supporter of NC State and provided major investments to create their graduate business degree programs after switching schools to get his MBA due to the lack of a program upon his graduation from NC State with his bachelor’s degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wral.com/news/education/story/8792708/ WRAL News]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014, the company was valued at $570 million with over 1600 employees.

On October 10, 2018, the company announced it was going to be sold off to a Canadian Company, [[GFL Environmental]], for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article219777470.html?#emlnl=Breaking_Newsletter&amp;id=c25vd2Nvb2w3NzZAZ21haWwuY29t|title=Raleigh’s Waste Industries is being sold to Canadian company|work=newsobserver|access-date=2018-10-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Full Circle Project==
In 2014, Waste Industries created the Full Circle Project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northwestgeorgianews.com/polkfishwrap/news/local/waste-industries-gives-to-local-organizations/article_64224b22-a8c2-11e5-9578-e331948f61f8.html North Georgian News]&lt;/ref&gt; The Full Circle Project allows employees and customers to give to their favorite non-profit through Waste Industries. To date, Waste Industries has given close to $1 million in non-profit donations.

'Uliti Uata appointed as Minister for Health"], Tongan government portal, 27 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Tonga]]n politician. He is a member of the [[Human Rights and Democracy Movement]] and the [[Democratic Party of the Friendly Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taimionline.com/articles/1581 "MP ‘Uliti Uata tipped as new Health Minister"], Taimi Media Network, January 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was initially a businessman, running several businesses including "inter-islands ferries, general store, tourism, and others", until he entered politics and "divested himself" of his businesses so as to focus on his political career and on his family (he has ten children).&lt;ref name="gov" /&gt;

Uata was first elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Tonga]] in 1975, and served as a People's Representative until 1980.  After a break from politics, he contested the [[Tongan general election, 1993|1993 election]] and won the seat of [[Ha'apai]].  He has been re-elected in every subsequent election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.gov.to/about-parliament/members/people/207-uliti-uata.html Biography] on the website of the Tongan Parliament&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Uata was one of several pro-democracy MPs charged with [[sedition]] over speeches given before the [[2006 Nuku'alofa riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=32703 |title=Decision next week in Tonga on trial of sedition suspects |publisher=Radio New Zealand International |date=2007-06-02 |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The charges were dismissed in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=49080 |title=Five acquitted on charges of seditious conspiracy in Tonga |publisher=Radio new Zealand International |date=2009-09-13 |accessdate=2010-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uata was re-elected for an eighth term in the [[Tongan general election, 2010|2010 election]], for the new single-seat constituency of [[Haʻapai 13]], and nominated to the post of Minister of Health on 25 January 2011, following [[ʻAkilisi Pohiva]]'s resignation from that position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matangitonga.to/article/tonganews/government/20110126_tonga_uliti.shtml "New Minister of Health"], Matangi Tonga, 26 Jan 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In late June 2012, Uata -along with two other ministers- resigned from the Cabinet, so as to support a [[motion of no confidence]] tabled by his party (DPFI) against the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnzi.com/pages/news.php?op=read&amp;id=69116 "Three Cabinet Ministers in Tonga resign ahead of confidence motion"], Radio New Zealand International, 25 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded as Minister for Health by [[Lord Tonga Tuʻiʻafitu|Lord Tuʻiʻafitu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://matangitonga.to/2012/07/09/pms-new-cabinet-short-ministers "PM's new Cabinet short of ministers"], ''Matangi Tonga'', 9 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
