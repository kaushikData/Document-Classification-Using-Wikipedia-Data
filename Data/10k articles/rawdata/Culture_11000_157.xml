'''''Anglo-Saxon Amulets and Curing Stones''''' is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] study of [[amulet]]s, [[talisman]]s and curing stones in the burial record of [[Anglo-Saxon England]]. Written by the Australian archaeologist [[Audrey Meaney]], it was published by the company British Archaeological Reports as the 96th monograph in their BAR British Series. Prior to writing the work, Meaney had published several books dealing with Anglo-Saxon burials.

In the book, Meaney opines that scholars can understand more about [[Magic in Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon beliefs regarding magic]] by looking at the archaeological evidence for amulets and related magic items found buried in graves. Looking at the literary evidence for magical practices, she goes on to look at a wide variety of items found in Anglo-Saxon inhumation burials which might have had amuletic properties. She categorises such artefacts into a series of overarching categories, including vegetable amulets, mineral amulets, animal amulets, manufactured amulets and found amulets, to each of which she devotes a chapter. Concluding her study, Meaney argues that amulets were primarily worn by women and children in Anglo-Saxon England, and that there were certain females, whom she termed "[[cunning folk|cunning women]]", who worked in a specific magical capacity for their local communities.

The book received a mixed review from the academic [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] in the ''Folklore'' journal. Meaney herself produced a rebuttal to Ellis Davidson in the following issue. Meaney's ideas regarding Anglo-Saxon cunning women would subsequently be adopted by fellow archaeologist Tania Dickinson.

==Background==
Prior to the publication of ''Anglo-Saxon Amulets and Curing Stones'', Meaney had written a number of studies on the archaeological burial record from Anglo-Saxon England. 1964 saw the publication of the ''Gazetteer of Early Anglo-Saxon Burial Sites'', brought out by [[Allen and Unwin]]. In 1970, Meaney's book, ''Two Anglo-Saxon Cemeteries at Winnall, Winchester, Hampshire'' was published by the Society for Medieval Archaeology as the fourth title in their monograph series.

==Synopsis==
[[Image:Artemisia vulgaris - Köhler–s Medizinal-Pflanzen-016.jpg|thumb|right|A 19th century illustration of ''[[Artemisia vulgaris]]'', colloquially known as ''mugwort'', a plant used for amuletic purposes in Anglo-Saxon England.]]
Chapter one, "Introduction" opens with Meaney's discussion of how archaeology can be used to shed light on the cognitive aspects of the past. She explains how she chooses to define terms like "amulet", "talisman", "charm" and "curing stone", before making comparisons with contemporary "good luck charms" to highlight the pervasiveness of amulets in human society. Moving on, she explores the early Christian attitudes to amulets in Europe using documentary sources, before going on to look specifically at the matter in Anglo-Saxon England. Here, she examines several Early Mediaeval manuscripts, such as the ''[[Lacnunga]]'' and ''[[Bald's Leechbook]]'', for evidence of written charms which made reference to amulets, before discussing the three known examples of Anglo-Saxon [[finger rings]] which had been engraved with a charm in [[rune|runic]] script.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mea81|Meaney 1981]]. pp. 3&amp;ndash;24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proceeding to discuss the existence of amulets and curing stones in Anglo-Saxon burials, she notes that two conditions must apply before an artefact is labelled under one of these two categories. The first is that there should be documentary evidence that "the object was believed to have magical powers." Although recognising that the most applicable documentary evidence should come from Anglo-Saxon England, she refuses to dismiss supporting evidence from a "related or descendent culture", and cites examples as varied as the ancient Greek ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' by [[Pliny the Elder]] to 19th-century British folk customs. Her second condition is that such artefacts should be evidently "especially valued" by those who performed the burial, being close to the body, but which were neither beautiful nor useful, implying that they must have had a different, magical purpose.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mea81|Meaney 1981]]. pp. 24&amp;ndash;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second chapter, entitled "Vegetable Amulets", looks at the evidence for herbal amulets in the Old English medical manuscripts, noting how problematic it is to identify specific plant species from the information provided in these sources. Using information from later Middle English sources, Meaney attempts to highlight the magical uses that Anglo-Saxons had for a variety of different plants, including [[Stachys officinalis|betony]], [[camomile]] and [[mugwort]]. Following on from this, Meaney discusses the evidence of plant-based amulets from Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, noting the existence of flat wooden coils from [[Welbeck Hill]] in [[Lincolnshire]], an oak ball from Little Wilbraham in [[Cambridgeshire]] and the vegetable fibres found at Polhill in [[Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mea81|Meaney 1981]]. pp. 38&amp;ndash;65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter three, "Mineral Amulets" offers an exploration of the evidence for amulets and curing stones made out of mineral substances, such as rocks and crystals. Making use of both written sources and burial evidence from Anglo-Saxon England and neighbouring parts of Europe, Meaney focuses on the role of [[amber]], [[jet (lignite)|jet]], [[amethyst]] and the potential magical associations which they had in Early Medieval society. She also looks at burial evidence for the use as quartz in creating rock crystal beads and [[spindle whorl]]s and also the burial of [[crystal ball]]s and sieve spoons, speculating on any magical uses that such items might have had by comparing them with Medieval literary sources and later folklore. She proceeds to look into the role of quartz pebbles, holed stones, pyrites and chalk and other white substances, all of which have been found in Anglo-Saxon graves.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mea81|Meaney 1981]]. pp. 67&amp;ndash;101.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bald's Leechbook page.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A facsimile page of ''Bald's Leechbook'', in which several Anglo-Saxon written charms are recorded.]]
Moving into the fourth chapter, "Animal Amulets", Meaney discusses possible amulets that were made out of animal products. After discussing Old English literary sources for magical beliefs regarding animal products, she refers to various items found within Anglo-Saxon graves which may have had amuletic properties, including fossil invertebrates like [[ammonites]] and [[sea urchin|echinoids]] and also shells such as [[cowries]], which were imported to England from the shores of the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Meaney proceeds to look into the wide variety of animal teeth found in Anglo-Saxon graves, including horse, oxen, boar and pig, dog and wolf, beaver and human, speculating as to their potential symbolism. She then rounds off the chapter with a discussion of items carved out of antler and the claws and miscellaneous bones that have sometimes been found in graves from this period.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mea81|Meaney 1981]]. pp. 106&amp;ndash;147.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter five, "Manufactured Amulets", deals with items that were intentionally crafted by the Anglo-Saxons or neighbouring peoples, possibly with the intention of being used as amulets. Meaney opens the chapter with a look at the miniature models of weapons and tools that were often found in Anglo-Saxon graves, comparing them with toiletry items and debating their possible amuletic uses. She then looks at pendants and in particular at the Anglo-Saxon bucket pendants, making comparisons with similar items in continental Europe. Next, Meaney looks at the various metal knots, rings and keys found in Anglo-Saxon contexts, noting that the latter apparently had phallic associations. Proceeding with this analysis, she then discusses the work-boxes found in multiple female Christian graves, which contained scraps of cloth and other organic materials; Meaney looks into the possible that they are relic boxes, containing sanctified pieces of cloth. Finally, she looks at miscellaneous items such as bronze spangles and [[Bulla (amulet)|bullae]] found in the Anglo-Saxon context.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mea81|Meaney 1981]]. pp. 148&amp;ndash;191.&lt;/ref&gt;

The sixth chapter, which is entitled "Found Amulets", looks at ''objects trouvés'' in Anglo-Saxon England, items which had probably been constructed in the preceding pre-Roman and Roman Iron Ages of English history but which had been adopted by Anglo-Saxons as trinkets and in certain cases buried with them. Meaney discusses the Anglo-Saxon use of Roman-era glass beads, either for general ornamentation or as [[sword bead]]s, making use of later folklore to argue that for the Anglo-Saxons, such beads may have been viewed as amuletic. She proceeds to discuss how certain Anglo-Saxons may have made use of prehistoric worked flints for [[weather magic]], and then their use of coinage produced by the Roman Empire, [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Merovingian]]s and [[Visigoth]]s, primarily for ornamentation. Meaney looks at the Anglo-Saxon tradition of burying the deceased with "something old", such as a Roman brooch or a sherd of coloured Roman glass, suggesting that these had potential amuletic properties.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mea81|Meaney 1981]]. pp. 192&amp;ndash;238.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final chapter offers a conclusion to the study, initially looking at the few amuletic items that were associated with male burials, such as magical inscriptions on armour and weaponry. She then discusses the role of amulets in infant burials before moving on to look at those included in the burials of adult women. She argues that certain female burials with particular collections of amulets represent "[[cunning folk|cunning women]]" who served their [[tribe]] in a magical capacity, using their abilities for both malevolent and benevolent purposes. She rounds off the book with a discussion of the changing fashions in amulets and the changing attitudes towards Anglo-Saxon amulets throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mea81|Meaney 1981]]. pp. 239&amp;ndash;273.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[analogy]] typically includes reference to the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] head of [[government]] as [[head of state]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Body politic: political metaphor and political violence |author=A. D. Harvey |publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84718-272-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the analogy may also be extended to other anatomical parts, as in political readings of [[Aesop's fable]] of "[[The Belly and the Members]]".

A later [[Europe]]an reference to the concept appears in ''The Book of the Body Politic'' (1407) by poet and court writer [[Christine de Pizan]], in which she admits having borrowed the concept from a letter of [[Plutarch]]'s to the Roman Emperor [[Trajan]] but does not mention [[John of Salisbury]]'s work, ''[[Policraticus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christine de Pizan]] ''The Book of the Body Politic'' pp.xviii-xx Kate Langdon Forhan 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of the Body Politic'' pp.3-5 1994&lt;/ref&gt;  The metaphor appears in the French language as the ''corps-état''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Baecque|first1=Antoine|others=Trans.

The metaphor was elaborated in the [[Renaissance]], and subsequently, as medical knowledge based on [[Galen]] was challenged by thinkers such as [[William Harvey]].  Analogies were drawn between supposed causes of disease and disorder and their equivalents in the political field, viewed as [[Plague (disease)|plague]]s or infections that might be remedied with [[purgative|purges]] and [[Patent medicine|nostrums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Foreign bodies and the body politic: discourses of social pathology in early modern England |author=Jonathan Harris |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-521-59405-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval origins==
{{Anchor|In statehood}} The term "Body politic" (the political body of [[society]]) derives from the mediæval political concept of the '''King's two bodies''' first noted by mediaeval historian [[Ernst Kantorowicz]], as a point of theology as much as statehood. However, the person to give the concept some legal bite and codified reality, as much as legitimacy as well as Sovereignty, was the 14th century judge Sir [[William de Shareshull]] in 1351 for the offence of high treason&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration what Offences shall be adjudged Treason. Compassing the Death of the King, Queen, or their eldest Son; violating the Queen, or the King’s eldest Daughter unmarried, or his eldest Son’s Wife; levying War; adhering to the King’s Enemies; killing the Chancellor, Treasurer, or Judges in Execution of their Duty.

ITEM, Whereas divers Opinions have been before this Time in what Case Treason shall be said, and in what not; the King, at the Request of the Lords and of the Commons, hath made a Declaration in the Manner as hereafter followeth, that is to say; When a Man doth compass or imagine the Death of our Lord the King, or of our Lady his [Queen or of their eldest Son and Heir; or if a Man do violate the King’s Companion or the King’s eldest Daughter unmarried, or the Wife  the King’s eldest Son and Heir; or if a Man do levy War against our Lord the King in his Realm, or be adherent to the King’s Enemies in his Realm, giving to them Aid and Comfort in the Realm, or elsewhere, and thereof be probably] attainted of open Deed by the People] of their Condition: . . . , and if a Man slea the Chancellor, Treasurer, or the King’s Justices of the one Bench or the other, Justices in Eyre, or Justices of Assise, and all other Justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their Places, doing their Offices: And it is to be understood, that in the Cases above rehearsed, that ought to be judged Treason which extends to our Lord the King, and his Royal Majesty" Treason Act 1351 25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''1351 Treason''' Act 25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2&lt;/ref&gt; in the aftermath of the [[First Barons' War|Barons war]]. However, by the time of the fifteenth-century judge [[John Fortescue (judge)|Sir John Fortescue]] the concept moves away from theology to [[jurisprudence]] in his ''The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy'', written from exile in about 1462 . Fortescue explains that the ''character angelus'' (divine character) of the king is his royal power, derived from angels and separate from the frail physical powers of his body.  However, he uses the phrase ''body politic'' itself only in its modern sense, to describe the realm, or shared rule, of [[Brutus of Troy|Brutus]], mythical first king of England, and how he and his fellow exiles had covenanted to form a body politic. Unusually for the time, Fortescue was writing in English and not Latin: "made a body pollitike callid a reawme." The early medieval period (13th century) saw a general and radical shift in the idea of the political body and sovereignty and who was to be ultimate ruler of humankind.This constant shift in [[Translatio imperii]] and ''The Halo of perpetuity''(Kantorowicz reasoning)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kings Two Bodies|last=Ernst|first=Kantorowicz|publisher=|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=78–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; transformed the king's persona from [[Liturgy]] to legal science, argues Kantorowicz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The King's Two Bodies|last=Kantorowicz|first=|publisher=|year=1957|isbn=|location=|pages=87–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] proved one thing, quite surprisingly enough, the king wasn't the ultimate and major landowner with just 20% of land ownership as [[William the Conqueror]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Doomsday Of Crown Lands|last=Sidney J|first=Madge|publisher=Routledge|year=1938|isbn=|location=|pages=20–21|quote="Before the Norman conquest, therefore, it is possible to find a feudal edifice of at least four stages-first, the king as supreme lord;then the holders of "bocland"with their "courts", and the power of making separate grants; next the owners of "laenland", rendering military service and special dues;and lastly, the cultivators of the land (Feudal serfs) of two types, free and unfree.This division of the land before and after the (Norman) Conquest, worked out so carefully in 1867, but expressed in percentage form for the first time, reveals the curious fact that the Church(29.6%) alone gained by the Conquest, relatively speaking, the Crown(19.9%) and the Baronage(50.5%) showing proportionate losses in the new triangular balance of power."}}&lt;/ref&gt; found out to his disgust and chagrin, which ultimately led to the [[Domesday Book|Domesday book]] being compiled. With [[Plenitudo potestatis]], [[Unam sanctam]] (a [[Papal bull]]) [[extra Ecclesiam nulla salus]] and the [[Sun and moon allegory]] now part of the armoury of jurisdictional power of the papacy with both [[Canon law]], and medieval political theology now becoming(part of the [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] movement beginning with [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[John of Salisbury]]) a standard bearer for medieval political power which then descended into the infamous [[Inquisition]] and [[heresy]] (deviation from truth)as the ultimate legal reality which meant both the [[Roman catholic church|Roman Catholic Church]] and [[Papal supremacy]] couldn't be ignored(not without fear of [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunication]] and in some cases judicial execution). The church, which ultimately had powerful claims to sovereignty due to their immense wealth and vast monetary resources which included a clever taxation system establishing the legal validity of the [[tithe]] system which baffled legal experts of the day of its historical lineage and origin, such as Sir [[William Blackstone]], for example, not its legal validity; such as their (the church's) enormous network and ownership of land, law making and the then-University and education system.

==Literal manifestation==
In 1550 the jurist [[Edmund Plowden]] merged Fortescue's concepts, at the same time removing them from abstraction into a real, physical manifestation in the body of the king. Plowden reports how lawyers codified this notion in an examination of a case of land-ownership turning on a disputed gift by an earlier monarch; they determined that the "Body politic…that cannot be seen or handled…[is] constituted for the direction of the People…[and] these two bodies are incorporated in one person…the Body politic includes the [king's] Body natural."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kantorowicz|first=Ernst H|authorlink=Ernst Kantorowicz|title=The King's Two Bodies: A Study in Mediaeval Political Theology|year=1957|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691071209|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1609 [[Attorney General]] [[Edward Coke]] pronounced his dissenting opinion,  that mortal power was God-made while the immortality of royal power existed only as a man-made concept; Coke later succeeded in limiting the royal power of both [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] and [[James VI and I]] with his now infamous judgements of [[Case of Proclamations]]&lt;ref&gt;'''England and Wales High Court (King's Bench Division)''' ''Decisions Case of Proclamations [1610] EWHC KB J22 November 1610''&lt;/ref&gt; and his ''[[Petition of Right]]'', which triggered off the [[English Civil War]] and would have reverberations right across the country for the next 100 years. When the monarchy, in the person of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], was [[Restoration (England)|restored]] at the end of the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] the idea remained current and royalty continued to use the notion, as a buttress to its authority, until an assertion of the rights of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] brought about the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688.&lt;ref&gt;Kantorowicz (1957: 423)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olwig (2002: 102)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th century English [[Barrister]] and judge Sir [[William Blackstone]] developed further the medieval idea and the legal argument  (which still stands today) of the monarch in legal terms "immortal" with added emphasis of a quasi divine (''character angelus'') status.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Blackstone|Sir William Blackstone]] (1765) ''Commentaries On The Laws of England: In Four Books'' p.196 Volume 1 "But, fourthly; however the crown may be limited or transferred, it still retains its descendible quality, and becomes hereditary in the wearer of it. And hence in our law the king is said never to die, in his political capacity; though,in common with other men, he is subject to mortality in his natural: because immediately upon the natural death of Henry,William, or Edward, the king survives in his successor.
For the right of the crown vests, eo instanti, upon his heir; either the ''hares natus'', if the course of descent remains unimpeached,or the ''hares factus'', if the inheritance be under any particular settlement. So that there can be no interregnum (7); but,as [[Sir Matthew Hale]] (b) observes, the right of sovereignty is fully invested in the successor by the very descent of the crown.And therefore, however acquired, it becomes in him absolutely hereditary, unless by the rules of the limitation it is otherwise ordered and determined. 
In the same manner as landed estates,to continue our former comparison, are by the law here hereditary, or descendible to the heirs of the owner; but still there exists a power, by which the property of those lands may be transferred to another person. If this transfer be made simply and absolutely (8), the lands will be hereditary in the new owner, and descend to his heir-at-law; but if the transfer be clogged with any limitations, conditions, or entails, the lands must descend in that channel, so limited and prescribed,and no other". 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ancient legal maxim is that ‘the King never dies’. According to Blackstone,”the King survives in his successor” and “the right of the Crown ''vests, eo instanti'', upon his heirs”. Thus in legal theory the monarch is regarded as immortal and there is no moment in which the throne is vacant”. [[Halsbury's Laws of England]] Fifth Edition ''Crown and Crown Proceedings'' pp.8-9 Volume 29 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=John Anthony|title=James I and Divine Right|publisher=Sophia University|location=Tokyo|oclc=41418652|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Revolution monarchs of France also claimed legitimacy on this principle, and extended it to include the idea that the king's heir assimilated the "body politic" of the old king, in a physical "transfer of corporeality", on accession.&lt;ref&gt;de Baecque (1997: 100–102)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11106">'''Convention against [[Discrimination in Education]]''' is a [[multilateral treaty]] adopted by [[UNESCO]] on 14 December 1960 in [[Paris]] and came into effect on 22 May 1962, which aims to combat discrimination   cultural or religious assimilation or [[racial segregation]] in the field of [[education]]. The Convention also ensures the free choice of [[religious education]]&lt;ref&gt;Article 2 (b)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[private school]],&lt;ref&gt;Article 2 (c)&lt;/ref&gt; [[linguistic rights|right to use or teach their own languages]] for [[national minority|national minorities]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 5, (c)&lt;/ref&gt; and prohibits any [[reservation (law)|reservation]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 9&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention enters into force for each State 12 months after the deposit of instrument of ratification. As at August 2017, 105 states were members of the Convention (including [[China]] in relation to [[Macau]] only).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=12949&amp;language=F Signatures to the Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;List of member states of the [http://portal.unesco.org/la/convention.asp?KO=12949&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha convention] and [http://portal.unesco.org/la/convention.asp?KO=15321&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha protocol]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an additional '''Protocol Instituting a Conciliation and Good Offices Commission''', which was adopted in 10 December 1962 and entered into force on 24 October 1968 in signatory States. As at September 2018, the Protocol has 37 members (including Vietnam; post-unification Vietnam has not expressed a position on whether it succeeds pre-unification South Vietnam as a member of the Protocol).

This Convention is also referred to in the ''Preamble'' of [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination]] and [[United Nations Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families]].

==Contents==
Article 1 defines "discrimination" as any distinction, [[social exclusion|exclusion]], limitation or preference on the basis of race, color, sex, language, religion, [[political opinion|political]] or other opinion, origin national or social status, economic status or birth. 

However, the article indicates a number of situations which are not to be considered to constitute discrimination. This includes the creation or maintenance of separate educational systems or establishments for pupils of both sexes, when they have easy access to education:
*establishment or maintenance on religious or linguistic grounds, and 
*the establishment or maintenance of private educational institutions, if the purpose of such institutions is not to ensure exclusion of any group but to add to the educational opportunities offered by the public authorities. 

Article 3 requires States to eliminate and prevent discrimination and Article 5 affirms respect for the freedom of parents in the choice of [[private school]]s, and for national minorities to have the right to engage in educational activities of their own and the employment or teaching of [[linguistic rights|their own language]]. 

Article 9 prohibits any [[reservation (law)|reservation]] to the Convention.

The treaty, in its entirety, may be viewed [http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=12949&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html here].

'''''Cracking India''''', (1991, U.S., 1992, India; originally published as ''Ice Candy Man'', 1988, England) is a novel by author [[Bapsi Sidhwa]].

Sidhwa's novel deals with the [[partition of India]] and its aftermaths. This is the first novel by a female novelist from Pakistan which describes the fate of people in [[Lahore]]. The novel deals with "the bloody partition of India through the eyes of a girl Lenny growing up in a [[Parsee]] family, surviving through female bonding and rebellion."

==Film==
* Filmmaker [[Deepa Mehta]]'s 1998 film, ''[[Earth (1998 film)|Earth]]'' (titled ''Earth 1947''), is based on ''Cracking India''.

==Controversies==
* A complaint was filed in Volusia County, Florida, arguing that ''Cracking India'', which was on a high school reading list, contained "[[pornography|pornographic material]]" and should be banned from the county's public schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chron.com/life/article/School-board-considers-ban-on-Houston-author-s-1558617.php&lt;/ref&gt; The district decided not to ban the book.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2005-11-18/news/VBOOKBAN18_1_volusia-cracking-india-reed&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Créolie''' is a literary movement in the island of [[Réunion]], a French [[overseas department]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] east of [[Madagascar]]. The term was coined by [[Jean Albany]] (1917–1984) and was developed in his poetry and painting. It attracted figures like [[Gilbert Aubry]], a Réunion poet and bishop.&lt;ref&gt;Noirs, Cafres et Créoles. Études de la représentation du non-Blanc réunionnais.

The '''Dipylon inscription''' is a short text written on an [[ancient Greek]] pottery vessel dated to ca. 740 BC. It is famous for being the oldest (or one of the oldest) known samples of the use of the [[Greek alphabet]]. The text is scratched on a wine jug ([[oenochoe]]), which was found in 1871 and is named after the location where it was found, the ancient Dipylon Cemetery, near the Dipylon Gate on the area of [[Kerameikos]] in [[Athens]]. The jug is attributed to the Late [[Geometric Style|Geometrical Period]] (750-700 BC). It is now in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Athens]] (inv. 192).

==Text==
The text is written in an archaic form of the [[Greek alphabet]], with some letter shapes still resembling those of the original [[Phoenician alphabet]]. It is written from right to left, with the individual letters mirror-shaped in comparison with the modern forms. It is placed in a circle around the shoulder of the vessel. The text consists of 46 characters, of which the first 35 can easily be read as an [[hexameter|hexametric]] verse in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]. The fragmentary rest is believed to have been the beginning of the second verse of a [[distichon]], but the exact interpretation is unclear. B. Powell has argued that the final characters may represent a garbled snippet from the middle of an abecedarium (ΚΛΜΝ) by a second hand, someone learning to write.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, N. M. Binek has shown that the last six markings can "be viewed not as letters or as attempts to inscribe letters, but rather as decorative elements fashioned by a second inscriber in accordance with the principles of Geometric idiom," inasmuch as the segment roughly mirrors the shapes of letters 9-4 (ΧΡΟΝΥΝ).&lt;ref&gt;Binek, 2017, pp. 423, 430-31&lt;/ref&gt; The text marks the vessel as a prize in a dancing competition. It is translated as: "whoever of the dancers now dances most lightly ...", and the second line is conjectured to have said something to the effect of "... he shall get this (vessel as his prize)."

[[File:Transcription of the Dipylon Oinochoe Inscription.jpg|thumb|Transcription of Dipylon Oinochoe Inscription (Powell, 1988)]]

The text of the inscription runs:
:ΗΟΣΝΥΝΟΡΧΕΣΤΟΝΠΑΝΤΟΝΑΤΑΛΟΤΑΤΑΠΑΙΖΕΙΤΟΤΟΔΕΚΛ[?]ΜΙ[?]Ν
In modern scholarly editions this is sometimes transcribed as:
:{{lang|grc|ὸς νῦν ὀρχεστôν πάντον ἀταλότατα παίζει,&lt;br /&gt;τô τόδε κλμιν[...]}}
This corresponds to the following in the later classical orthography in Greek (using the Ionian form of the Greek alphabet), with the metric feet of the hexameter indicated:
:{{lang|grc|ὃς νῦν &amp;#x7c; ὀρχη&amp;#x7c;στῶν πάν&amp;#x7c;των ἀτα&amp;#x7c;λώτατα &amp;#x7c; παίζει&lt;br /&gt;τῷ τόδε ...}}
Literal translation:
:Whoever of all these dancers now plays most delicately,
:to him this ...

==Oldest inscriptions==
It is believed that either the Dipylon inscription or the so-called [[Nestor Cup]] is the oldest known alphabetic Greek inscription. The Nestor Cup, which also bears a verse inscription, was found in an excavation at the ancient Greek colony of [[Pithekoussai]] on the island of [[Ischia]] in [[Italy]]. It is thought to be of equal age with the Dipylon inscription or slightly younger.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16248">'''Discourse ethics''' refers to a type of [[argument]] that attempts to establish normative or ethical truths by examining the presuppositions of discourse.&lt;ref&gt;“Discourse Ethics.” Encyclopedia of Science, Technology, and Ethics, Encyclopedia.com, www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/discourse-ethics.&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of this argument have been used in the establishment of [[egalitarian]] ethics, as well as [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] ethics.

==Habermas and Apel==
German philosophers [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Karl-Otto Apel]] are considered the originators of modern discourse ethics.&lt;ref name="Àbba"&gt;{{cite book|last=Àbba|first=Giuseppe|title=Quale Impostazione per la filosofia morale?|publisher=LAS|location=Roma|year=1996|isbn=978-88-213-0314-2|pages=126–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas's discourse ethics is his attempt to explain the implications of [[communicative rationality]] in the sphere of moral insight and normative validity. It is a complex theoretical effort to reformulate the fundamental insights of Kantian [[deontological ethics]] in terms of the analysis of communicative structures.  This means that it is an attempt to explain the universal and obligatory nature of morality by evoking the universal obligations of communicative rationality. It is also a [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivist]] moral theory, which means it holds that justifying the validity of moral norms can be done in a manner analogous to the justification of facts.  However, the entire project is undertaken as a [[rational reconstruction]] of moral insight.  It claims only to reconstruct the implicit normative orientations that guide individuals and it claims to access these through an analysis of communication.

===Public discourse ethics===
This type of ethics consists of conversations about ideas in civic or community contexts marked by diversity of perspectives requiring thoughtful public engagement. This discourse is made up of differing insights that helps to shape the public's engagement with one another.&lt;ref name= "Arnett, Fritz, &amp; Bell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnett, Fritz, &amp; Bell|title=Communication ethics Literacy|publisher= SAGE Publications Inc.|location=California|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4129-4214-0|pages=99–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of discourse is meant to protect and to promote the public good. For public discourse ethics to be successful there must be an effective level of civility between people or persons involved. It was Sigmund Freud who once said, "civilization began the first time an angry person cast a word instead of a rock" and that statement is something that continues to be seen in society today.&lt;ref name= "Waisanen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Waisanen|first=D|title=TOWARD ROBUST PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT:THE VALUE OF DELIBERATIVE DISCOURSE FOR CIVIL COMMUNICATION|pages=287–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Harvard Law Review accurately examines public discourse and explains it in a manner that is appropriate and conceptually accurate. "Every man who publishes a book commits himself to the judgement of the public, and anyone may comment upon his performance.... [W]hatever their merits, others have a right to pass their judgement upon them-to censure them if they be censurable, and to turn them into ridicule if they be ridiculous".&lt;ref name= "Post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Post|first=Robert|title=''Harvard Law Review''|year=1990|page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the public discourse ethics to be productive there must be accountability on the public stage as the Harvard Law Review calls into question. Without any act of accountability the ethicality of the discourse is no longer valid and cannot go on. Public accountability consists of three basic factors. The factors are a diversity of ideas, an engagement  of public decision making, and finally an account for continuing a practice or way of doing something or a means or reason for changing the practice. Finally, public discourse ethics puts a great responsibility on the individual. They must continually be asking questions and finding answers. They will not always be right; and that is okay. As long as they are able to make a positive decision in the end.

===Presupposition===
Habermas maintains that normative validity cannot be understood as separate from the argumentative procedures used in everyday practice, such as those used to resolve issues concerning the legitimacy of actions and the validity of the norms governing interactions. He makes this claim by making reference to the validity dimensions attached to speech acts in communication and the implicit forms of argumentation they imply (see [[Universal pragmatics]]). The basic idea is that the validity of a moral norm cannot be justified in the mind of an isolated individual reflecting on the world. The validity of a norm is justified only intersubjectively in processes of argumentation between individuals; in a [[dialectic]]. The validity of a claim to normative rightness depends upon the mutual understanding achieved by individuals in argument.

From this it follows that the [[presupposition]]s of argumentation would become important. [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] extracted moral principles from the necessities forced upon a rational subject reflecting on the world. Habermas extracts moral principles from the necessities forced upon individuals engaged in the discursive justification of validity claims, from the inescapable presuppositions of communication and argumentation. These presuppositions were the kinds of idealization that individuals had to make in order for communication and argumentation to even begin. For example:
* The presupposition that participants in communicative exchange are using the same linguistic expressions in the same way
* The presupposition that no relevant argument is suppressed or excluded by the participants
* The presupposition that no force except that of the better argument is exerted
* The presupposition that all the participants are motivated only by a concern for the better argument

There were also presuppositions unique to discourse:
* The presupposition that everyone would agree to the universal validity of the claim thematized
* The presupposition that everyone capable of speech and action is entitled to participate, and everyone is equally entitled to introduce new topics or express attitudes needs or desires
* The presupposition that no validity claim is exempt in principle from critical evaluation in argumentation

These are all at the center of Habermas's moral theory. Habermas's discourse ethics attempts to distill the idealized moral point of view that accompanies a perfectly rational process of argumentation (also idealized), which would be the moral principle implied by the presuppositions listed above.  The key point is that the presuppositions of argumentation and communication that have been rationally reconstructed by Habermas are both factual and normative.  This can be said about his entire project because it is explicitly attempting to bridge the gap between the "is" and the "ought."  Habermas speaks of the mutual recognition and exchanging of roles and perspectives that are demanded by the very structural condition of rational argumentation. He maintains that what is implied in these factual presuppositions of communication is the deep structure of moral norms, the conditions that every valid norm must fulfill.

===Universalization===
The presuppositions of communication express a universal obligation to maintain impartial judgment in discourse, which constrains all affected to adopt the perspectives of all others in the exchange of reasons.  From this Habermas extracts the following principle of universalization (U), which is the condition every valid norm has to fulfill:

&lt;blockquote&gt;(U) All affected can accept the consequences and the side effects that [the norm's] general observance can be anticipated to have for the satisfaction of everyone's interests, and the consequences are preferred to those of known alternative possibilities for regulation. (Habermas, 1991:65)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This can be understood as the deep structure of all acceptable moral norms, and should not be confused with the principle of discourse ethics (D), which presupposes that norms exist that satisfy the conditions specified by (U).

&lt;blockquote&gt;(D) Only those norms can claim to be valid that meet (or could meet) with the approval of all affected in their capacity as participants in a practical discourse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The implications of (U) and (D) are quite profound. (U) claims to be a rational reconstruction of the impartial moral point of view at the heart of all cognitivist moral theories. According to moral cognitivists (e.g. Kant, Rawls etc.), it is only from such a moral point of view that insight into the actual (quasi-factual) impersonal obligations of a general will can be gained, because this perspective relieves decisions from the inaccuracies of personal interests.  Of course, Habermas's reconstruction is different because it is intersubjective.  That is, Habermas (unlike [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] or [[John Rawls|Rawls]]) formulates the moral point of view as it arises out of the multiple perspectives of those affected by a norm under consideration.  The moral point of view explicated in (U) is not the property of an individual subject but the property of a community of interlocutors, the results of a complex dialogical process of role taking and perspective exchanging.  Furthermore, (U) is deduced from a rational reconstruction of the presupposition of communication, which downgrades the strong transcendentalism of Kantian ethics by establishing a foundation in inner-worldly processes of communication.

(D) on the other hand is a principle concerning the manner in which norms conforming to (U) must be justified through discourse.  Again, Habermas takes the task of moral reflection out of the isolated individual's head and gives it to intersubjective processes of communication.  What (D) proposes is that moral principles must be validated in actual discourse and that those to be affected by a norm must be able to participate in argumentation concerning its validity.  No number of thought experiments can replace a communicative exchange with others regarding moral norms that will affect them.  Moreover, this general prescription concerning the type of discourse necessary for the justification of moral norms opens the process of moral deliberation to the kind of learning that accompanies a fallibilistic orientation.  (U) and (D) are catalysts for a moral learning process, which although fallible is not relative.  The flesh and blood insights of participants in communicative exchange are refracted through the universal guidelines explicated from the deep structures of communication and argumentation.  This spawns discourses with a rational trajectory, which are grounded in the particular circumstances of those involved but aimed at a universal moral validity.

===Practical applications===

The practical applications of discourse ethics have taken a significant turn after the publication of Habermas' book [[Between Facts and Norms]] (1992),&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jurgen (1995). Between Facts and Norms. Cambridge: [[MIT Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; where its application to democracy and the legislative process was substantially refined and expanded. Prior to this book, Habermas had left open the question of the various applications of discourse theory to almost any type of consensus oriented group&lt;ref&gt;Habermas, Jurgen (1986). Moral Consciousness and Communicative Ethics. Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from highly visible political and governmental groups, such as Parliament in Great Britain and Congressional debate in the United States, and other consensus oriented activities as found in public and private institutions such as those supported on various international websites and Wikipedia.{{third-party-inline|date=September 2013}}&lt;!-- The whole paragraph --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6169">The '''Fandroana''', termed the '''Royal Bath''' by 19th century European historians, is the annual New Year's festival of the [[Merina people]] inhabiting the highlands of central [[Madagascar]].  The origins of the festival are preserved through oral history. According to folk legend, the wild [[zebu]] cattle that roamed the Highlands were first domesticated for food in [[Kingdom of Imerina|Imerina]] under the reign of [[Ralambo]]. Different legends attribute the discovery that zebu were edible to the king's servant&lt;ref name = B85&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bloch | first = Maurice | title = Almost Eating the Ancestors | journal = Man | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 631–646 | year = 1985 | jstor = 2802754 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to Ralambo himself.&lt;ref name = raison&gt;{{Cite book | last = Raison-Jourde | first = Françoise | title = Les souverains de Madagascar | publisher = Karthala Editions | location = Antananarivo | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-2-86537-059-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nKSlFJjgC9UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = February 18, 2011 |pages=141–142| ref = harv|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ralambo is credited with founding the traditional ceremony of the fandroana to celebrate this discovery,&lt;ref name = dela/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Ogot | first = Bethwell A. | title = Africa from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century | publisher = UNESCO | location = Paris |page=876 | year = 1992 | isbn = 978-92-3-101711-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WAQbp7aLpZkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = February 18, 2011 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; although others have suggested he merely added certain practices to the celebration of a long-standing ritual.&lt;ref name=Madatana&gt;{{Cite web |last=Madatana |title=Colline d'Ambohidrabiby |url=http://madatana.com/colline-ambohidrabiby.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324030204/http://madatana.com/colline-ambohidrabiby.php |archivedate=March 24, 2009 |accessdate=October 4, 2010 |language=fr |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
According to one version of the story, while traversing the countryside Ralambo and his men came across a wild zebu so exceptionally fat that the king decided to make a burnt offering of it. As the zebu flesh cooked, the enticing smell led Ralambo to taste the meat. He declared zebu meat to be fit for human consumption. In honor of the discovery, he decided to establish a holiday called ''fandroana'' that would be distinguished by the consumption of well-fattened zebu meat.  The holiday was to be celebrated on the day of his birth, which coincided with the first day of the year. To this end, the holiday symbolically represented a community-wide renewal that would take place over a period of several days before and after the first of the year.&lt;ref name = p29&gt;Raison-Jourde (1983), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==
Although the precise form of the original holiday cannot be known with certainty and has evolved over time, 18th- and 19th-century accounts suggest what the event may have been like.&lt;ref name = Larson&gt;{{Citation | last = Larson | first = Pier M. | contribution = A cultural politics of bedchamber construction and progressive dining in Antananarivo: ritual inversions during the ''fandroana'' of 1817  | title = Ancestors, Power and History in Madagascar| editor-last = Middleton | editor-first = Karen | place = Leiden, The Netherlands | publisher = Brill | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-90-04-11289-6 |pp =37–70 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=My4B9q9FTiYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate = March 3, 2010 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts from these centuries indicate that all family members were required to reunite in their home villages during the festival period. Estranged family members were expected to attempt to reconcile. Homes were cleaned and repaired and new housewares and clothing were purchased. The symbolism of renewal was particularly embodied in the traditional sexual permissiveness encouraged on the eve of the ''fandroana'' (characterized by early 19th-century British missionaries as an "orgy") and the following morning's return to rigid social order with the sovereign firmly at the helm of the kingdom.&lt;ref name = Larson/&gt; 

On this morning, the first day of the year, a red rooster was traditionally sacrificed and its blood used to anoint the sovereign and others present at the ceremony. Afterward the sovereign would bathe in sanctified water, then sprinkle it upon attendees to purify and bless them and ensure an auspicious start to the year.&lt;ref name = dela&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = de La Vaissière | first1 = Camille | last2 = Abinal | first2 = Antoine | title = Vingt ans à Madagascar: colonisation, traditions historiques, moeurs et croyances |pages=285–290 | publisher = V.

The zebu meat eaten over the course of the festival was primarily grilled or consumed as ''jaka'', a preparation reserved uniquely for this holiday. ''Jaka'' was prepared during the festival by sealing shredded zebu meat with [[suet]] in a decorative clay jar; this [[confit]] would then be conserved in an underground pit for twelve months to be served at the next year's ''fandroana''.&lt;ref name = p29/&gt;

In November 1943, a ''fandroana'' was held in [[Toulouse]] by the authorities of [[Vichy France]]. The ''Chef d'état'' [[Philippe Pétain]] was dressed as a Merina king and received a wooden zebu sculpture from the ''tirailleurs malgaches'' (Malagasy soldiers) stranded in France after the [[British invasion of Madagascar]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric T. Jennings, "Vichy Propaganda, Metropolitan Public Opinion, and the British Attack on Madagascar, 1942", ''L'Esprit Créateur'', '''47''', 1 (2007): 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''French phonology''' is the sound system of [[French language|French]]. This article discusses mainly the [[phonology]] of [[Standard French]] of the Parisian dialect. Notable phonological features include its [[uvular r]], [[nasal vowel]]s, and three processes affecting word-final sounds: [[liaison (French)|liaison]], a specific instance of [[sandhi]] in which word-final consonants are not pronounced unless they are followed by a word beginning with a vowel; [[elision (French)|elision]] in which certain instances of {{IPAslink|ə}} ([[schwa]]) are elided (such as when final before an initial vowel) and {{wikt-lang|fr|enchaînement}} (resyllabification) in which word-final and word-initial consonants may be moved across a syllable boundary, with syllables crossing word boundaries:

An example of the various processes is this:
*Written: ''{{lang|fr|On a laissé la fenêtre ouverte.}}''
*Meaning: "The window has been left open."
*In isolation: {{IPA|/ɔ̃ a lɛse la fənɛːtʁ uvɛʁt/}}
*Together: {{IPA|[ɔ̃.na.lɛ.se.laf.nɛː.tʁu.vɛʁt]}}

* Word-final consonants are always released. Generally, {{IPA|/b, d, ɡ/}} are voiced throughout and {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} are unaspirated.{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=75}}
* {{IPA|/l/}} is usually apical alveolar {{IPAblink|l|l̺}} but sometimes laminal denti-alveolar {{IPAblink|l̪}}.{{sfnp|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=192}} Before {{IPA|/f, ʒ/}}, it can be realised as [[Retroflex consonant|retroflex]] {{IPAblink|ɭ}}.{{sfnp|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|p=192}}
* In current pronunciation, {{IPA|/ɲ/}} is merging with {{IPA|/nj/}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=doYT4VXnhnAC&amp;pg=PA326&amp;lpg=PA326&amp;dq=/%C9%B2/+is+merging+with+/nj/+in+france&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lnaybD5zcI&amp;sig=KgM38kqEAf2D0dp_eZtS0Q9zkUI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YOmXUemkJ6230gG8lYGwAg&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%2F%C9%B2%2F%20is%20merging%20with%20%2Fnj%2F%20in%20france&amp;f=false Phonological Variation in French: Illustrations from Three Continents], edited by Randall Scott Gess, Chantal Lyche, Trudel Meisenburg.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|/ŋ/}} is not a native [[phoneme]] of French, but it occurs in [[loan word]]s  such as {{wikt-lang|fr|camping}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|bingo}} or {{wikt-lang|fr|kung-fu}}.{{sfnp|Wells|1989|p=44}} Some speakers who have difficulty with this consonant realise it as a sequence {{IPA|[ŋɡ]}} or replace it with {{IPA|/ɲ/}}.{{sfnp|Grevisse|Goosse|2011|loc=§32, b}}
* The approximants {{IPA|/j, ɥ, w/}} correspond to the close vowels {{IPA|/i, y, u/}}. While there are a few [[minimal pair]]s (such as {{wikt-lang|fr|loua}} {{IPA|/lu.a/}} 's/he rented' and {{wikt-lang|fr|loi}} {{IPA|/lwa/}} 'law'), there are many cases where there is free variation.{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=75}}
* Some dialects of French have a palatal lateral {{IPA|/ʎ/}} (French: ''l [[mouillé]]'', 'moistened l'), but in the modern standard variety, it has merged with {{IPA|/j/}}.{{sfnp|Grevisse|Goosse|2011|loc=§33, b}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=47}} See also [[#Glides and diphthongs|Glides and diphthongs]], below.
* The French [[Rhotic consonant|rhotic]] has a wide range of realizations: the [[voiceless uvular fricative|voiceless]] or [[voiced uvular fricative|voiced]] uvular fricatives {{IPA|[χ]}} and {{IPA|[ʁ]}} (the latter also realized as an [[approximant consonant|approximant]]), the [[uvular trill]] {{IPA|[ʀ]}}, the [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}, and the [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}}. These are all recognized as the [[phoneme]] {{IPA|/r/}},{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=75}} but all except {{IPA|[ʁ]}} and {{IPA|[χ]}} are considered dialectal. {{IPA|[ʁ]}} is the standard consonant. Although the voiceless {{IPA|[χ]}} is pronounced before or after a voiceless obstruent or at the end of a sentence, the voiced symbol {{IPA|[ʁ]}} is often used in phonemic transcriptions. See [[Guttural R#French|French guttural r]] and map at right.
* Velars {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} may become [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalised]] to {{IPA|[kʲ⁓c]}} and {{IPA|[ɡʲ⁓ɟ]}} before {{IPA|/i, e, ɛ/}}, and more variably before {{IPA|/a/}}.{{sfnp|Berns|2013}} Word-final {{IPA|/k/}} may also be palatalised to {{IPA|[kʲ]}}.{{sfnp|Detey|Durand|Laks|Lyche|2016|pp=131, 415}} Velar palatalisation has traditionally been associated with working class,{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=42}} though recent studies suggest it is spreading to more demographics of large French cities.{{sfnp|Detey|Durand|Laks|Lyche|2016|pp=131, 415}}

===Geminates===
Although double consonant letters appear in the orthographic form of many French words, [[gemination|geminate]] consonants are relatively rare in the pronunciation of such words. The following cases can be identified.{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|pp=149–150}}

The geminate pronunciation {{IPA|[ʁʁ]}} is found in the future and conditional forms of the verbs {{wikt-lang|fr|courir}} ('to run') and {{wikt-lang|fr|mourir}} ('to die'). The conditional form ''il mourrait'' {{IPA|[il.muʁ.ʁɛ]}} ('he would die'), for example, contrasts with the imperfect form ''il mourait'' {{IPA|[il.mu.ʁɛ]}} ('he was dying'). This is no longer true for most modern speakers, for whom {{IPA|[ʁʁ]}} has reduced to {{IPA|[ʁ]}} in all words. Other verbs that have a double {{angbr|rr}} orthographically in the future and conditional are pronounced with a simple {{IPA|[ʁ]}}: ''il pourra'' ('he will be able to'), ''il verra'' ('he will see').

When the prefix {{wikt-lang|fr|in-}} combines with a base that begins with ''n'', the resulting word is sometimes pronounced with a geminate {{IPA|[nn]}} and similarly for the variants of the same prefix ''im-'', ''il-'', ''ir-'': 
* {{wikt-lang|fr|inné}} {{IPA|[i(n).ne]}} ('innate')
* {{wikt-lang|fr|immortel}} {{IPA|[i(m).mɔʁtɛl]}} ('immortal')
* {{wikt-lang|fr|illisible}} {{IPA|[i(l).li.zibl]}} ('illegible')
* {{wikt-lang|fr|irresponsable}} {{IPA|[i(ʁ).ʁɛs.pɔ̃.sabl]}} ('irresponsible')

Other cases of optional gemination can be found in words like {{wikt-lang|fr|syllabe}} ('syllable'), {{wikt-lang|fr|grammaire}} ('grammar'), and {{wikt-lang|fr|illusion}} ('illusion'). The pronunciation of such words, in many cases, a [[spelling pronunciation]] varies by speaker and gives rise to widely varying stylistic effects.{{sfnp|Yaguello|1991|}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=51}} In particular, the gemination of consonants other than the liquids and nasals {{IPA|/m n l ʁ/}} is "generally considered affected or pedantic".{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|p=150}} Examples of stylistically marked pronunciations include {{wikt-lang|fr|addition}} {{IPA|[ad.di.sjɔ̃]}} ('addition') and {{wikt-lang|fr|intelligence}} {{IPA|[ɛ̃.tel.li.ʒɑ̃s]}} ('intelligence').

Gemination of doubled {{angbr|m}} and {{angbr|n}} is typical of the [[Languedoc]] region, as opposed to other southern accents.

A few cases of gemination do not correspond to double consonant letters in the orthography.{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|pp=151–153}} The deletion of word-internal schwas (see below), for example, can give rise to sequences of identical consonants: ''là-dedans'' {{IPA|[lad.dɑ̃]}} ('inside'), ''l'honnêteté''  {{IPA|[lɔ.nɛt.te]}} ('honesty'). Gemination is obligatory in such contexts. The elided form of the object pronoun ''l&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' ('him/her/it') can optionally (in nonstandard, popular speech) be realized as a geminate {{IPA|[ll]}} when it appears after a vowel:
*''Je l'ai vu'' {{IPA|[ʒə(l).levy]}} ('I saw it')
*''Il faut l'attraper'' {{IPA|[il.fo(l).la.tʁa.pe]}} ('it must be caught')
Finally, a word pronounced with [[#Emphatic stress|emphatic stress]] can exhibit gemination of its first syllable-initial consonant:
*'''''for'''midable'' {{IPA|[fːɔʁ.mi.dabl]}} ('terrific')
*''é'''pou'''vantable'' {{IPA|[e.pːu.vɑ̃.tabl]}} ('horrible')

===Liaison===
{{Main|Liaison (French)}}

Many words in French can be analyzed as having a "latent" final consonant that is pronounced only in certain syntactic contexts when the next word begins with a vowel. For example, the word {{wikt-lang|fr|deux}} {{IPA|/dø/}} ('two') is pronounced {{IPA|[dø]}} in isolation or before a consonant-initial word (''deux jours'' {{IPA|/dø ʒuʁ/}} → {{IPA|[dø.ʒuʁ]}} 'two days'), but in ''deux ans'' {{IPA|/døz‿ɑ̃/}} (→ {{IPA|[dø.zɑ̃]}} 'two years'), the linking or liaison consonant {{IPA|/z/}} is pronounced.

==Vowels==
[[Image:French vowel chart.svg|thumb|right|[[Vowel]]s of Parisian French, from {{Harvcoltxt|Collins|Mees|2013|pp=225–226}}. Many speakers merge {{IPA|/œ̃/}} with {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} and {{IPA|/a/}} with {{IPA|/ɑ/}}. In the latter case, the outcome is an open central {{IPAblink|ä}} between the two (not shown on the chart).]]
Standard French contrasts up to 13 oral vowels and up to 4 nasal vowels. The schwa (in the center of the diagram next to this paragraph) is not necessarily a distinctive sound. Even though it often merges with one of the mid front rounded vowels, its patterning suggests that it is a separate phoneme (see the sub-section [[#Schwa|Schwa]] below).

===Close vowels===
In contrast with the mid vowels, there is no tense–lax contrast in close vowels. However, non-phonemic lax (near-close) {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ}}, {{IPA link|ʏ}}, {{IPA link|ʊ}}]}} appear in the Quebec and Cajun varieties as allophones of {{IPA|/i, y, u/}} when the vowel is both phonetically short (so not before {{IPA|/v, z, ʒ, ʁ/}}) and in a closed syllable, so that e.g. ''petite'' {{IPA|[pə.t͡sɪt]}} 'small ({{abbr|f.|feminine}})' differs from ''petit'' 'small ({{abbr|m.|masculine}})' {{IPA|[pə.t͡si]}} not only in the presence of the final {{IPA|/t/}} but also in the tenseness of the {{IPA|/i/}}. Laxing is obligatory only in stressed closed syllables, but also found in other environments to various degrees.{{sfnp|Walker|1984|pp=51–60}}{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|pp=25–6}}

In Parisian French, {{IPA|/i, u/}} are consistently close {{IPA|[{{IPA link|i}}, {{IPA link|u}}]}},{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=73}}{{sfnp|Lodge|2009|p=84}}{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2013|p=225}} but the exact height of {{IPA|/y/}} is somewhat debatable as it has been variously described as close {{IPAblink|y}}{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=73}}{{sfnp|Lodge|2009|p=84}} and near-close {{IPAblink|ʏ}}.{{sfnp|Collins|Mees|2013|p=225}}

===Mid vowels===
Although the mid vowels contrast in certain environments, there is limited distributional overlap so they often appear in complementary distribution. Generally, [[close-mid vowel]]s ({{IPA|/e, ø, o/}}) are found in open syllables, and [[open-mid vowel]]s ({{IPA|/ɛ, œ, ɔ/}}) are found in closed syllables. However, there are minimal pairs:{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=73}}
* open-mid {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and close-mid {{IPA|/e/}} contrast in final-position open syllables:
*: {{wikt-lang|fr|allait}} {{IPA|[a.lɛ]}} ('was going'), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|allé}}  {{IPA|[a.le]}} ('gone');
* likewise, open-mid {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/œ/}} contrast with close-mid {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ø/}} mostly in closed monosyllables, such as these:
*: {{wikt-lang|fr|jeune}} {{IPA|[ʒœn]}} ('young'), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|jeûne}} {{IPA|[ʒøn]}} ('fast', verb),
*: {{wikt-lang|fr|roc}} {{IPA|[ʁɔk]}} ('rock'), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|rauque}} {{IPA|[ʁok]}} ('hoarse'),
*: {{wikt-lang|fr|Rhodes}} {{IPA|[ʁɔd]}} ('Rhodes'), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|rôde}} {{IPA|[ʁod]}} ('[I] lurk'),
*: {{wikt-lang|fr|Paul}} {{IPA|[pɔl]}} ('Paul', masculine), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|Paule}} {{IPA|[pol]}} ('Paule', feminine),
*: {{wikt-lang|fr|bonne}} {{IPA|[bɔn]}} ('good', feminine), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|Beaune}} {{IPA|[bon]}} ('[[Beaune]]', the city).

Beyond the general rule, known as the ''loi de position'' among French phonologists,{{sfnp|Morin|1986}} there are some exceptions. For instance, {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/ø/}} are found in closed syllables ending in {{IPA|[z]}}, and only {{IPA|[ɔ]}} is found in closed monosyllables before {{IPA|[ʁ]}}, {{IPA|[ɲ]}}, and {{IPA|[ɡ]}}.{{sfnp|Léon|1992|p=?}}

The phonemic opposition of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/e/}} has been lost in the southern half of France, where these two sounds are found only in complementary distribution. The phonemic oppositions of {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} and of {{IPA|/œ/}} and {{IPA|/ø/}} in terminal open syllables have been lost in all of France, but not in [[Belgium]], where {{wikt-lang|fr|pot}} and {{wikt-lang|fr|peau}} are still opposed as {{IPA|/pɔ/}} and {{IPA|/po/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://research.jyu.fi/phonfr/58.html |title=Phonétique et prononciation du français pour apprenants finnophones |last1=Kalmbach |first1=Jean-Michel |last2= |first2= |date=2011 |website= |publisher= |access-date=2 October 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open vowels===
The phonemic contrast between front {{IPA|/a/}} and back {{IPA|/ɑ/}} is sometimes not maintained in Standard French, which leads some researchers to reject the idea of two distinct phonemes.&lt;ref&gt;"Some phoneticians claim that there are two distinct ''a''s in French, but evidence from speaker to speaker and sometimes within the speech of a single speaker is too contradictory to give empirical support to this claim".{{Harvcoltxt|Casagrande|1984|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the distinction is still clearly maintained in other dialects such as [[Quebec French]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ciral.ulaval.ca/phonetique/phono/r30.htm Postériorisation du / a /] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706214342/http://www.ciral.ulaval.ca/phonetique/phono/r30.htm |date=2011-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is much variation among speakers in France, a number of general tendencies can be observed. First of all, the distinction is most often preserved in word-final stressed syllables such as in these minimal pairs:
: {{wikt-lang|fr|tache}} {{IPA|/taʃ/}} → {{IPA|[taʃ]}} ('stain'), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|tâche}} {{IPA|/tɑʃ/}} → {{IPA|[tɑʃ]}} ('task')
: {{wikt-lang|fr|patte}} {{IPA|/pat/}} → {{IPA|[pat]}} ('leg'), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|pâte}} {{IPA|/pɑt/}} → {{IPA|[pɑt]}} ('paste, pastry')
: {{wikt-lang|fr|rat}} {{IPA|/ʁa/}} → {{IPA|[ʁa]}} ('rat'), vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|ras}} {{IPA|/ʁɑ/}} → {{IPA|[ʁɑ]}} ('short')

There are certain environments that prefer one open vowel over the other. For example, {{IPA|/ɑ/}} is preferred after {{IPA|/ʁw/}} and before {{IPA|/z/}}:
: {{wikt-lang|fr|trois}} {{IPA|[tʁwɑ]}} ('three'),
: {{wikt-lang|fr|gaz}} {{IPA|[ɡɑz]}} ('gas').{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|p=64}}

The difference in quality is often reinforced by a difference in length (but the difference is contrastive in final closed syllables). The exact distribution of the two vowels varies greatly from speaker to speaker.&lt;ref&gt;"For example, some have the front {{IPA|[a]}} in {{wikt-lang|fr|casse}} 'breaks', and the back {{IPA|[ɑ]}} in {{wikt-lang|fr|tasse}} 'cup', but for others the reverse is true. There are also, of course, those who use the same vowel, either {{IPA|[a]}} or {{IPA|[ɑ]}}, in both words".{{Harvcoltxt|Tranel|1987|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back {{IPA|/ɑ/}} is much rarer in unstressed syllables, but it can be encountered in some common words:
: {{wikt-lang|fr|château}} {{IPA|[ʃɑ.to]}} ('castle'),
: {{wikt-lang|fr|passé}} {{IPA|[pɑ.se]}} ('past').

Morphologically complex words derived from words containing stressed {{IPA|/ɑ/}} do not retain it:
: {{wikt-lang|fr|âgé}} {{IPA|/ɑʒe/}} → {{IPA|[aː.ʒe]}} ('aged', from {{wikt-lang|fr|âge}} {{IPA|/ɑʒ/}} → {{IPA|[ɑʒ]}})
: ''rarissime'' {{IPA|/ʁaʁisim/}} → {{IPA|[ʁaʁisim]}} ('very rare', from {{wikt-lang|fr|rare}} {{IPA|/ʁɑʁ/}} → {{IPA|[ʁɑʁ]}}).

Even in the final syllable of a word, back {{IPA|/ɑ/}} may become {{IPA|[a]}} if the word in question loses its stress within the extended phonological context:{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|p=64}}
: ''J'ai été au '''bois''''' {{IPA|/ʒe ete o bwɑ/}} → {{IPA|[ʒe.e.te.o.bwɑ]}} ('I was in the woods'),
: ''J'ai été au '''bois''' de Vincennes'' {{IPA|/ʒe ete o bwɑ dəvɛ̃sɛn/}} → {{IPA|[ʒe.e.te.o.bwad.vɛ̃.sɛn]}} ('I was in the Vincennes woods').

===Nasal vowels===
The phonetic qualities of the back nasal vowels are not very similar to those of the corresponding oral vowels, and the contrasting factor that distinguishes {{IPA|/ɑ̃/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ̃/}} is the extra lip rounding of the latter according to some linguists,{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=74}} but other linguists have come to the conclusion that the main difference is in tongue height.{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=33-34}} Speakers who produce both {{IPA|/œ̃/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} distinguish them mainly through increased lip rounding of the former, but many speakers use only the latter phoneme, especially most speakers in northern France such as Paris (but not farther north, in [[Belgium]]).{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=74}}{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=33-34}}

In some dialects, particularly that of Europe, there is an attested tendency for nasal vowels to shift in a counterclockwise direction: {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} tends to be more open and shifts toward the vowel space of {{IPA|/ɑ̃/}} (realised also as {{IPA|[æ̃]}}), {{IPA|/ɑ̃/}} rises and rounds to {{IPA|[ɔ̃]}} (realised also as {{IPA|[ɒ̃]}}) and {{IPA|/ɔ̃/}} shifts to {{IPA|[õ]}} or {{IPA|[ũ]}}. Also, there also is an opposite movement for {{IPA|/ɔ̃/}} for which it becomes more open and unrounds to {{IPA|[ɑ̃]}}, resulting in a merger of Standard French {{IPA|/ɔ̃/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} in this case.{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=33-34}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansen|first=Anita Berit|title=Les voyelles nasales du français parisien moderne. Aspects linguistiques, sociolinguistiques et perceptuels des changements en cours|year=1998|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press|isbn=87-7289-495-4|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Quebec French, two of the vowels shift in a different direction: {{IPA|/ɔ̃/}} → {{IPA|[õ]}}, more or less as in Europe, but {{IPA|/ɛ̃/}} → {{IPA|[ẽ]}} and {{IPA|/ɑ̃/}} → {{IPA|[ã]}}.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/icphs-proceedings/ICPhS2011/OnlineProceedings/RegularSession/Carignan/Carignan.pdf Oral articulation of nasal vowel in French]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schwa===
When phonetically realised, [[schwa]] ({{IPAslink|ə}}), also called ''e {{wikt-lang|fr|caduc}}'' ('dropped e') and ''e {{wikt-lang|fr|muet}}'' ('mute e'), is a mid-central vowel with some rounding.{{sfnp|Fougeron|Smith|1993|p=73}} Many authors consider it to be phonetically identical to {{IPAslink|œ}}.{{sfnp|Anderson|1982|p=537}}{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|p=88}} Geoff Lindsey suggests the symbol {{IPAslink|ɵ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindsey|first1=Geoff|title=Le FOOT vowel|url=http://englishspeechservices.com/blog/le-foot-vowel/|website=English Speech Services|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindsey|first1=Geoff|title=Rebooting Buttocks|url=http://englishspeechservices.com/blog/rebooting-buttocks/|website=English Speech Services|accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvcoltxt|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006}} state, more specifically, that it merges with {{IPAslink|ø}} before high vowels and glides:
: {{wikt-lang|fr|netteté}} {{IPA|/nɛtəte/}} → {{IPA|[nɛ.tø.te]}} ('clarity'),
: {{wikt-lang|fr|atelier}} {{IPA|/atəlje/}} → {{IPA|[a.tø.lje]}} ('workshop'),
in phrase-final stressed position:
: ''dis-le !'' {{IPA|/di lə/}} → {{IPA|[di.lø]}} ('say it'),
and that it merges with {{IPAslink|œ}} elsewhere.{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=59}} However, some speakers make a clear distinction, and it exhibits special phonological behavior that warrants considering it a distinct phoneme. Furthermore, the merger occurs mainly in the French of France; in Quebec, {{IPAslink|ø}} and {{IPAslink|ə}} are still distinguished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afcp-parole.org/doc/Archives_JEP/2008_XXVIIe_JEP_Avignon/PDF/avignon2008_pdf/JEP/072_jep_1653.pdf Timbre du schwa en français et variation régionale : un étude comparative] retrieved 14 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The main characteristic of French schwa is its "instability": the fact that under certain conditions it has no phonetic realisation.
* That is usually the case when it follows a single consonant in a medial syllable:
*: {{wikt-lang|fr|rappeler}} {{IPA|/ʁapəle/}} → {{IPA|[ʁap.le]}} ('to recall'),
* It is most frequently mute in word-final position:
*: {{wikt-lang|fr|table}} {{IPA|/tabl(ə)/}} → {{IPA|[tabl]}} ('table').
* Word-final schwas are optionally pronounced if preceded by two or more consonants and followed by a consonant-initial word:
*: ''une porte fermée'' {{IPA|/yn(ə) pɔʁt(ə) fɛʁme/}} → {{IPA|[yn.pɔʁ.t(ə).fɛʁ.me]}} ('a closed door').
* In the future and conditional forms of ''-er'' verbs, however, the schwa is sometimes deleted even after two consonants:
*: ''tu garderais'' {{IPA|/ty ɡaʁdəʁɛ/}} → {{IPA|[ty.ɡaʁ.d(ə.)ʁɛ]}} ('you would guard'),
*: ''nous brusquerons [les choses]'' {{IPA|/nu bʁyskəʁɔ̃/}} → {{IPA|[nu.bʁys.k(ə.)ʁɔ̃]}} ('we will precipitate [things]').
* On the other hand, it is pronounced word-internally when it follows more pronounced consonants that cannot be combined into a complex onset with the initial consonants of the next syllable:
*: {{wikt-lang|fr|gredin}} {{IPA|/ɡʁədɛ̃/}} → {{IPA|[ɡʁə.dɛ̃]}} ('scoundrel'),
*: ''sept petits'' {{IPA|/sɛt pəti/}} → {{IPA|[sɛt.pə.ti]}} ('seven little ones').{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|pp=88–105}}

Pronouncing {{IPA|[ə]}} as {{IPA|[œ]}} is a way to emphasise the syllable.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} For instance, pronouncing {{wikt-lang|fr|biberon}} ('baby bottle') {{IPA|[bi.bœ.ʁɔ̃]}} instead of {{IPA|[bib.ʁɔ̃]}} is a way to draw attention to the {{angbr|e}} (to clarify the spelling, for example).

In French versification, word-final schwa is always elided before another vowel and at the ends of verses. It is pronounced before a following consonant-initial word.{{sfnp|Casagrande|1984|pp=228–29}} For example, ''une grande femme fut ici ''{{IPA|[yn ɡʁɑ̃d fam fy.t‿i.si]}}, would be pronounced {{IPA|[y.nə ɡʁɑ̃.də fa.mə fy.t‿i.si]}}, with the {{IPA|/ə/}} at the end of each word being pronounced.

Schwa cannot normally be realised as a front vowel ({{IPAblink|œ}}) in closed syllables. In such contexts in inflectional and derivational morphology, schwa usually alternates with the front vowel {{IPAslink|ɛ}}:
: {{wikt-lang|fr|harceler}} {{IPA|/aʁsəle/}} → {{IPA|[aʁ.sœ.le]}} ('to harass'), with
: ''il harcèle'' {{IPA|/il aʁsɛl/}} → {{IPA|[i.laʁ.sɛl]}} ('[he] harasses').{{sfnp|Anderson|1982|pp=544–46}}

A three-way alternation can be observed, in a few cases, for a number of speakers:
: {{wikt-lang|fr|appeler}} {{IPA|/apəle/}} → {{IPA|[ap.le]}} ('to call'),
: ''j'appelle'' {{IPA|/ʒ‿apɛl/}} → {{IPA|[ʒa.pɛl]}} ('I call'),
: {{wikt-lang|fr|appellation}} {{IPA|/apelasjɔ̃/}} → {{IPA|[a.pe.la.sjɔ̃]}} ('brand'), which can also be pronounced {{IPA|[a.pɛ.la.sjɔ̃]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=63}} for {{IPAblink|e}}, TLFi, s.v. ''[http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/appellation appellation]'' for {{IPA|[ɛ]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instances of orthographic {{angbr|e}} that do not exhibit the behaviour described above may be better analysed as corresponding to the stable, full vowel {{IPA|/œ/}}. The [[enclitic]] pronoun {{wikt-lang|fr|le}}, for example, always keeps its vowel in contexts like ''donnez-le-moi'' {{IPA|/dɔne lə mwa/}} → {{IPA|[dɔ.ne.lœ.mwa]}} ('give it to me') for which schwa deletion would normally apply (giving *{{IPA|[dɔ.nɛl.mwa]}}), and it counts as a full syllable for the determination of stress.

Cases of word-internal stable {{angbr|e}} are more subject to variation among speakers, but, for example, ''un rebelle'' {{IPA|/ɛ̃ ʁəbɛl/}} → {{IPA|[ɛ̃.ʁœ.bɛl]}} ('a rebel') must be pronounced with a full vowel in contrast to ''un rebond'' {{IPA|/ɛ̃ ʁəbɔ̃/}} → {{IPA|[ɛ̃.ʁœ.bɔ̃]}} or {{IPA|[ɛ̃ʁ.bɔ̃]}} ('a bounce').{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|pp=98–99}}

===Length===
Except for the distinction still made by some speakers between {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/ɛː/}} in rare minimal pairs like  {{wikt-lang|fr|mettre}} {{IPA|[mɛtʁ]}} ('to put') vs. {{wikt-lang|fr|maître}} {{IPA|[mɛːtʁ]}} ('teacher'), variation in vowel length is entirely allophonic. Vowels can be lengthened in closed, stressed syllables, under the following two conditions:

*{{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/ø/}}, {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, and the nasal vowels are lengthened before any consonant: {{wikt-lang|fr|pâte}} {{IPA|[pɑːt]}} ('dough'), {{wikt-lang|fr|chante}} {{IPA|[ʃɑ̃ːt]}} ('sings').
*All vowels are lengthened if followed by one of the voiced fricatives—{{IPA|/v/}}, {{IPA|/z/}}, {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, {{IPA|/ʁ/}} (not in combination)—or by the cluster {{IPA|/vʁ/}}: {{wikt-lang|fr|mer}}/{{wikt-lang|fr|mère}} {{IPA|[mɛːʁ]}} ('sea/mother'), {{wikt-lang|fr|crise}} {{IPA|[kʁiːz]}} ('crisis'), {{wikt-lang|fr|livre}} {{IPA|[liːvʁ]}} ('book').{{sfnp|Walker|1984|pp=25–27}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Tranel|1987|pp=49–51}} However, words such as ''(ils) servent'' {{IPA|[sɛʁv]}} ('(they) serve') or {{wikt-lang|fr|tarte}} {{IPA|[taʁt]}} ('pie') are pronounced with short vowels since the {{IPA|/ʁ/}} appears in clusters other than {{IPA|/vʁ/}}.

When such syllables lose their stress, the lengthening effect may be absent. The vowel {{IPA|[o]}} of {{wikt-lang|fr|saute}} is long in ''Regarde comme elle saute !'', in which the word is phrase-final and therefore stressed, but not in ''Qu'est-ce qu'elle saute bien !''{{sfnp|Walker|2001|p=46}} In accents wherein {{IPA|/ɛː/}} is distinguished from {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, however, it is still pronounced with a long vowel even in an unstressed position, as in ''fête'' in ''C'est une fête importante.''{{sfnp|Walker|2001|p=46}}

===Devoicing===
In Parisian French, the close vowels {{IPA|/i, y, u/}} and the mid front {{IPA|/e, ɛ/}} at the end of utterances can be [[devoiced]]. A devoiced vowel may be followed by a sound similar to the [[voiceless palatal fricative]] {{IPA|[ç]}}:
: ''Merci.'' {{IPA|/mɛʁsi/}} → {{IPA|[mɛʁ.si̥ç]}} ('Thank you.'),
: ''Allez !'' {{IPA|/ale/}} → {{IPA|[a.le̥ç]}} ('Go!').{{sfnp|Fagyal|Moisset|1999}}

In Quebec French, close vowels are often devoiced when unstressed and surrounded by voiceless consonants:
: ''université'' {{IPA|/ynivɛʁsite/}} → {{IPA|[y.ni.vɛʁ.si̥.te]}} ('university').{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=27}}
Though a more prominent feature of Quebec French, phrase-medial devoicing is also found in European French.{{sfnp|Torreira|Ernestus|2010}}

===Elision===
{{Main|Elision (French)}}

The final vowel (usually {{IPA|/ə/}}) of a number of monosyllabic [[function word]]s is [[elision|elided]] in syntactic combinations with a following word that begins with a vowel. For example, compare the pronunciation of the unstressed subject pronoun, in ''je dors'' {{IPA|/ʒə dɔʁ/}} {{IPA|[ʒə.dɔʁ]}} ('I am sleeping'), and in ''j'arrive'' {{IPA|/ʒ‿aʁiv/}} {{IPA|[ʒa.ʁiv]}} ('I am arriving').

===Glides and diphthongs===
The glides {{IPA|[j]}}, {{IPA|[w]}}, and {{IPA|[ɥ]}} appear in syllable onsets immediately followed by a full vowel. In many cases, they alternate systematically with their vowel counterparts {{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[u]}}, and {{IPA|[y]}} such as in the following pairs of verb forms:
:''nie'' {{IPA|[ni]}}; {{wikt-lang|fr|nier}} {{IPA|[nje]}} ('deny')
:''loue'' {{IPA|[lu]}}; {{wikt-lang|fr|louer}} {{IPA|[lwe]}} ('rent')
:''tue'' {{IPA|[ty]}}; {{wikt-lang|fr|tuer}} {{IPA|[tɥe]}} ('kill')
The glides in the examples can be analysed as the result of a glide formation process that turns an underlying high vowel into a glide when followed by another vowel: {{IPA|/nie/}} → {{IPA|[nje]}}.

This process is usually blocked after a complex onset of the form obstruent + liquid (a stop or a fricative followed by {{IPA|/l/}} or {{IPA|/ʁ/}}). For example, while the pair ''loue''/''louer'' shows an alternation between {{IPA|[u]}} and {{IPA|[w]}}, the same suffix added to ''cloue'' {{IPA|[klu]}}, a word with a complex onset, does not trigger the glide formation: ''clouer'' {{IPA|[klue]}} ('to nail'). Some sequences of glide + vowel can be found after obstruent-liquid onsets, however. The main examples are {{IPA|[ɥi]}}, as in ''pluie'' {{IPA|[plɥi]}} ('rain'), {{IPA|[wa]}}, and {{IPA|[wɛ̃]}}.&lt;ref&gt;The latter two correspond to orthographic {{angbr|oi}}, as in ''trois'' {{IPA|[tʁwa]}} ('three'), which contrasts with disyllabic ''troua'' {{IPA|[tʁu.a]}} ('[he] punctured').&lt;/ref&gt; They can be dealt with in different ways, as by adding appropriate contextual conditions to the glide formation rule or by assuming that the phonemic inventory of French includes underlying glides or rising [[diphthong]]s like {{IPA|/ɥi/}} and {{IPA|/wa/}}.{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|pp=37–39}}{{sfnp|Chitoran|2002|p=206}}

Glide formation normally does not occur across morpheme boundaries in compounds like ''semi-aride'' ('semi-arid').{{sfnp|Chitoran|Hualde|2007|p=45}} However, in colloquial registers, ''si elle'' {{IPA|[si.ɛl]}} ('if she') can be pronounced just like {{wikt-lang|fr|ciel}} {{IPA|[sjɛl]}} ('sky'), or ''tu as'' {{IPA|[ty.ɑ]}} ('you have') like ''tua'' {{IPA|[tɥa]}} ('[he] killed').{{sfnp|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=39}}

The glide {{IPA|[j]}} can also occur in syllable coda position, after a vowel, as in {{wikt-lang|fr|soleil}} {{IPA|[sɔlɛj]}} ('sun'). There again, one can formulate a derivation from an underlying full vowel {{IPA|/i/}}, but the analysis is not always adequate because of the existence of possible minimal pairs like {{wikt-lang|fr|pays}} {{IPA|[pɛ.i]}} ('country') / {{wikt-lang|fr|paye}} {{IPA|[pɛj]}} ('paycheck') and {{wikt-lang|fr|abbaye}} {{IPA|[a.bɛ.i]}} ('abbey') / {{wikt-lang|fr|abeille}} {{IPA|[a.bɛj]}} ('bee').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Fagyal|Kibbee|Jenkins|2006|p=39}}. The words ''pays'' and ''abbaye'' are more frequently pronounced {{IPA|[pe.i]}} and {{IPA|[abe.i]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Schane (1968) proposes an abstract analysis deriving postvocalic {{IPA|[j]}} from an underlying lateral by palatalization and glide conversion ({{IPA|/lj/}} → {{IPA|/ʎ/}} → {{IPA|/j/}}).{{sfnp|Schane|1968|pp=57–60}}

==Stress==
Word stress is not distinctive in French, so two words cannot be distinguished on the basis of stress placement alone. In fact, grammatical stress is always on the final full syllable (syllable with a vowel other than schwa) of a word. Monosyllables with schwa as their only vowel ({{wikt-lang|fr|ce}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|de}}, {{wikt-lang|fr|que}}, etc.) are generally [[clitic]]s but otherwise may receive stress.{{sfnp|Anderson|1982|p=537}}

The difference between stressed and unstressed syllables in French is less marked than in English. Vowels in unstressed syllables keep their full quality, regardless of whether the rhythm of the speaker is syllable-timed or mora-timed (see [[isochrony]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mora-timed speech is frequent in French, especially in Canada, where it is very much the norm.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, words lose their stress to varying degrees when pronounced in phrases and sentences. In general, only the last word in a phonological phrase retains its full grammatical stress (on its last full syllable).{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|pp=194–200}}

===Emphatic stress===
Emphatic stress is used to call attention to a specific element in a given context such as to express a contrast or to reinforce the emotive content of a word. In French, this stress falls on the first consonant-initial syllable of the word in question. The characteristics associated with emphatic stress include increased amplitude and pitch of the vowel and gemination of the onset consonant, as mentioned [[#Geminates|above]].{{sfnp|Tranel|1987|pp=200–201}} Emphatic stress does not replace, but occurs in tandem with, grammatical stress.{{sfnp|Walker|2001|pp=181—2}}
*''C'est parfaitement vrai''. {{IPA|[sɛ.paʁ.fɛt.mɑ̃.ˈvʁɛ]}} ('It's perfectly true.'; no emphatic stress)
*''C'est '''par'''faitement vrai.'' {{IPA|[sɛ.ˈp(ː)aʁ.fɛt.mɑ̃.ˈvʁɛ]}} (emphatic stress on ''parfaitement'')

For words that begin with a vowel, emphatic stress falls on the first syllable that begins with a consonant or on the initial syllable with the insertion of a glottal stop or a [[liaison (French)|liaison]] consonant.
*''C'est é'''pouv'''antable.'' {{IPA|[sɛ.te.ˈp(ː)u.vɑ̃ˈ.tabl]}} ('It's terrible.'; emphatic stress on second syllable of ''épouvantable'')
*''C'est '''é'''pouvantable !'' {{IPA|[sɛ.ˈt(ː)e.pu.vɑ̃.ˈtabl]}} (initial syllable with liaison consonant {{IPA|[t]}})
*''C'est '''é'''pouvantable !'' {{IPA|[sɛ.ˈʔe.pu.vɑ̃.ˈtabl]}} (initial syllable with glottal stop insertion)

==Intonation==

{{Main|Intonation (linguistics)#French}}

French intonation differs substantially from that of English.{{sfnp|Lian|1980}} There are four primary patterns:

*The continuation pattern is a rise in pitch occurring in the last syllable of a rhythm group (typically a phrase).
*The finality pattern is a sharp fall in pitch occurring in the last syllable of a declarative statement.
*The yes/no intonation is a sharp rise in pitch occurring in the last syllable of a yes/no question.
*The information question intonation is a rapid fall-off from high pitch on the first word of a non-yes/no question, often followed by a small rise in pitch on the last syllable of the question.

'''Grotrian-Steinweg''', known as '''Grotrian''' in the US, is a German manufacturer of luxury [[piano]]s. The company is based in [[Braunschweig]], Germany, commonly known as Brunswick in English. Grotrian-Steinweg makes premium [[grand piano]]s and [[upright piano]]s.

[[File:Grotrian Fluegel.JPG|thumb|right|Grotrian-Steinweg grand piano inner mechanism]]
Grotrian-Steinweg's history dates back to 1835 when the first Steinweg piano factory was built by [[Henry E. Steinway|Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg]] (later known as Henry Steinway after his emigration to the US where he founded [[Steinway &amp; Sons]]). In 1856, Friedrich Grotrian became a partner; in 1865 his son Wilhelm Grotrian and two associates bought the factory and the right to market their pianos as successors to the Steinweg brand. Ensuing generations of Grotrian family members led the company to become one of the finest piano manufacturers in Germany. Grotrian-Steinweg pianos were preferred by some famous pianists, and they received accolades at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago. Grotrian-Steinweg operated an orchestra and a concert hall, and established sales rooms in a half dozen major cities in Germany, and by 1920, in London as well. At its peak in the late 1920s, Grotrian-Steinweg employed 1,000 people and made 3,000 pianos per year.

Economic depression in the 1930s and war in the 1940s caused Grotrian-Steinweg to decline severely and then lose its factory completely. The family rebuilt the factory and re-established its reputation for quality work. In the 1950s, an annual piano-playing competition was founded by the company, to identify promising young piano students.

Grotrian-Steinweg sought to expand into the US in the mid-1960s. Steinway &amp; Sons sued to prevent them from using the Steinweg name, resulting in a 1975 decision by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]. The case set a [[precedent]] in describing "[[initial interest confusion]]": that the brand Grotrian-Steinweg could cause  piano buyers to temporarily confuse its brand with the brand Steinway &amp; Sons. The court ordered Grotrian-Steinweg to stop selling pianos in the US under the "Steinweg" name. Afterward, the company formed a business entity named Grotrian Piano Company to sell pianos in North America.

==19th century==
On 13 January 1803, Georg Friedrich Karl Grotrian, called Friedrich, was born in [[Schöningen]], Germany.&lt;ref name=History2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=KeyboardEncyclopedia/&gt; He settled in [[Moscow]] to sell pianos, beginning around 1830. He joined a partnership in a small piano making firm based in [[Saint Petersburg]], and included these pianos among the various instruments he sold in his successful Moscow music shop.&lt;ref name=Petersen81/&gt;

In Germany, [[Heinrich Engelhard Steinweg]] (1797–1871) started making pianos in 1835 from his house in [[Seesen]] at the edge of the [[Harz]] mountains;&lt;ref name=Knize303/&gt; a source of fine beech and spruce wood for the instruments. Among the pianos that Steinweg produced in his first year was a [[square piano]] designed by and built for Friedrick Grotrian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Piano Makers |last=Wainwright |first=David |page=121 |publisher=Hutchinson |year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pianoforte |last=Sumner |first=William Leslie |page=124 |publisher=Macdonald |year=1971 |edition=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This instrument is now in the [[Braunschweig]] museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Piano |last=Williams |first=John-Paul |page=78 |publisher=Aurum |year=2002 |series=Quarto}}&lt;/ref&gt;) H.E. Steinweg entered three of his pianos in a state fair in 1839, two of them square pianos, but his [[grand piano]] brought wide notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Piano: The Making of a Steinway Concert Grand |last=Barron |first=James |page=26 |publisher=Macmillan |year=2007 |isbn=0-8050-8304-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850, H.E. Steinweg took most of his large family to New York City, leaving the piano factory to his eldest son [[C.F. Theodor Steinweg]] (1825–1889) who stayed behind to run it under his own name. Meanwhile, in New York City, the Steinweg family Americanized their surname to Steinway and in 1853 they founded the piano manufacturer [[Steinway &amp; Sons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0X3FoI_Z6cQC&amp;pg=PA170 |page=170 |title=The Piano |last1=Ripin |first1=Edwin M. |last2=Belt |first2=Philip |publisher=W.

[[File:Th. Steinweg Nachf. Braunschweig.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An early piano branded "Th. Steinweg Nachf.", meaning "successor to Theodor Steinweg"]]
Soon after taking ownership of his father's old factory, C.F. Theodor Steinweg moved it to [[Wolfenbüttel]] near Braunschweig. Here he met Friedrich Grotrian who was traveling for business.&lt;ref name=KeyboardEncyclopedia/&gt; In 1854, Friedrich Grotrian received the Müller-Mühlenbein pharmacy as an inheritance from an uncle, so he moved back to Germany to manage it. He joined C.F. Theodor Steinweg's piano company as a partner in 1856.&lt;ref name=Petersen81/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ratcliffe26&gt;{{cite book |first=Ronald V. |last=Ratcliffe |title=Steinway |location=San Francisco |publisher=Chronicle Books |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-8118-3389-9 |pages=23, 26–27 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ugt7RtDgJ7MC&amp;pg=PA26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:G-S Stammhaus.JPG|left|thumb|upright|The Grotrian-Steinweg residence and piano-making workshop in [[Braunschweig]]]]
In 1857, C.F. Theodor Steinweg and Grotrian moved the piano factory to Braunschweig, setting up shop in a former mayor's mansion at 48 Bohlweg Street in the inner, medieval part of the city.&lt;ref name=Columbian1895&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QOEsAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA204 |page=204 |title=Musical instruments at the World's Columbian Exposition |publisher=Presto Co. |year=1895|author1=Abbott |first1=Frank D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company employed about 25 people at this time. Friedrich Grotrian died on 11 December 1860, leaving his share of the company to his son Wilhelm (1843–1917).&lt;ref name=KeyboardEncyclopedia/&gt; In 1865, C.F. Theodor Steinweg was needed by his family in New York to help manage Steinway &amp; Sons after his brothers Henry and Charles died. Wilhelm Grotrian joined with two of the piano workmen—Adolph Helfferich and H.D.W. Schulz—to buy out C.F. Theodor Steinweg's share of the building. The new partnership paid for the right to use the trademark "C.F. Th. Steinweg Nachf.", meaning, "Successor to C.F. Theodor Steinweg." (''Nachf.'' is an abbreviation for ''Nachfolger''—German for ''successor''.) The company name became "Grotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th. Steinweg Nachf."&lt;ref name=Ratcliffe26/&gt; Wilhelm Grotrian raised two sons in the 1870s: Wilhelm "Willi" Grotrian Jr (1868–1931) and Kurt Grotrian (1870–1929).&lt;ref name=KeyboardEncyclopedia/&gt;

In New York City, C.F. Theodor Steinweg (H.E. Steinweg's son) changed his name to C.F. Theodore Steinway, and served as the leader and chief technician of Steinway &amp; Sons for fifteen years. He did not like living in the US, so he kept his home in Braunschweig and traveled back and forth as needed. In 1880 he stopped traveling overseas and started a new Steinway &amp; Sons piano factory in [[Hamburg]], competing with his father's old firm, now called Grotrian-Steinweg, in making pianos for European customers. After establishing the business, Steinway retired to Braunschweig for his last years. He died in 1889, leaving his collection of pianos to the city's museum. The Hamburg factory proved successful in competing against Grotrian-Steinweg—both companies were known for producing premium pianos.&lt;ref&gt;Ratcliffe, 1989, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1880s, Willi Grotrian studied piano making with [[Wm. Knabe &amp; Co.]] in  [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and with [[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel, Wolff et Cie]] in Paris, France.&lt;ref name=Columbian1895/&gt; Kurt Grotrian also studied with piano makers in other countries. Their father Wilhelm Grotrian Sr took Willi with him to Chicago in 1893; there, at the [[World's Columbian Exposition]], Grotrian-Steinweg won an award for fine quality.&lt;ref name=Columbian1895/&gt; Pianists [[Eugen d'Albert]], [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] and [[Clara Schumann]] expressed a preference for Grotrian-Steinweg pianos.&lt;ref name=Columbian1895/&gt; Grotrian-Steinweg was counted among the top German piano manufacturers along with [[C. Bechstein Pianofortefabrik|Bechstein]], [[Blüthner]], [[Feurich]], Ibach, Lipp and the Hamburg division of Steinway.&lt;ref&gt;Ripin, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0X3FoI_Z6cQC&amp;pg=PA61 p. 61].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, Wilhelm Grotrian Sr made his two sons partners in the business.&lt;ref name=KeyboardEncyclopedia/&gt; He told them, "Lads, build good pianos and the rest will take care of itself."&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grotrian.de/en/phil_geschichte.html |title=Company's history |publisher=Grotrian-Steinweg |accessdate=12 December 2011}} The original German sentence is "''Jungs, baut gute Klaviere&amp;nbsp;– dann kommt alles andere von selbst.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Willi Grotrian methodically set about to improve the systems and standards the Grotrian-Steinweg company used to produce pianos.&lt;ref name=Petersen80&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uap2d1aQCw4C&amp;pg=PA80 |page=80 |title=Vom "Schwachstarktastenkasten" und seinen Fabrikanten |last=Petersen |first=Sonja |publisher=Waxmann Verlag |year=2011 |isbn=3-8309-2534-4 |language=German |series=Cottbuser Studien zur Geschichte von Technik, Arbeit und Umwelt |volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grotrian-Steinweg brand was well known for being of the highest quality: the company was named purveyor to some 30 "Kaisers, Kings and royal houses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Die Musik in Geschichte und Gegenwart: allgemeine Enzyklopädie der Musik |page=97 |first1=Ludwig |last1=Finscher |first2=Friedrich |last2=Blume |language=German |year=2002 |publisher=Bärenreiter |volume=8 |edition=2}} Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The owners Franz Wilhelm Grotrian, Willi Grotrian and Kurt Grotrian were awarded an imperial and [[royal warrant of appointment]] to the court of [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In Braunschweig, Grotrian-Steinweg grew to a workforce of 550 by 1913, producing about 1,600 pianos annually.&lt;ref name=KeyboardEncyclopedia&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Grotrian-Steinweg |last1=Dürer |first1=Carsten |last2=Anderson |first2=David |pages=157–158 |editors=Robert Palmieri, Margaret W. Palmieri and Igor Kipnis |title=Encyclopedia of Keyboard Instruments |volume=2 |year=2003 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=0-415-93796-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grotrian-Steinweg Orchestra was active in [[Leipzig]] under the baton of young conductor [[Hermann Scherchen]]. Grotrian-dedicated salesrooms were operating in Leipzig, [[Hanover]], [[Königsberg]], [[Düsseldorf]] and Berlin.

During [[World War I]], Kurt Grotrian left the factory to serve in the German Army. He was soon wounded and taken [[prisoner of war]]. The elder Wilhelm Grotrian died in 1917.&lt;ref name=KeyboardEncyclopedia/&gt; Willi Grotrian, his son, led the company but it was greatly reduced in manpower and orders for pianos. After the war, the company resumed as before, expanding sales in 1920 by establishing a London shop under the brand name Grotrian-Steinweg. The workforce increased to 1,000.&lt;ref name=KeyboardEncyclopedia/&gt; In 1924, Grotrian-Steinweg built an unusual piano for [[microtonal music]] composer [[Ivan Wyschnegradsky]]. The piano had three [[Manual (music)|manuals]], and strings tuned a [[quarter tone]] apart.&lt;ref&gt;Ripin, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0X3FoI_Z6cQC&amp;pg=PA71 p. 71].&lt;/ref&gt; By 1927, Grotrian-Steinweg was making about 3,000 pianos annually. This number dropped significantly in the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]]; fewer than 500 pianos were made in 1931, and the workforce was reduced to less than 200.&lt;ref name=Petersen81&gt;Petersen, 2011, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uap2d1aQCw4C&amp;pg=PA81 81].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Piano: A History |last=Ehrlich |first=Cyril |publisher=Dent |year=1976 |page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurt Grotrian had become seriously ill in the late 1920s, and in 1928 he made his two sons Erwin (1899–1990) and Helmut (1900–1977) shareholders. In 1929, Kurt Grotrian died of complications from his old war wound.&lt;ref name=History2005&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.le-clavier.com/HISTORY_OF_THE_GROTRIAN_PIANO_COMPANY.pdf |title=History of the Grotrian Piano Company |publisher=Grotrian |year=2005 |accessdate=13 December 2011}} Hosted by le-clavier.com&lt;/ref&gt; Willi Grotrian died in 1931.

In [[World War II]], the Grotrian-Steinweg factory (like many others in Germany) was ordered to switch to fabricating parts for aircraft. The factory was destroyed in 1944 by the [[Bombing of Braunschweig in World War II|bombing of Braunschweig]], as was the founder's mansion in the center of town.&lt;ref name=History2005/&gt; Afterward, Erwin and Helmut rebuilt the factory.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; By 1948, production had resumed; composer and pianist [[Wilhelm Kempff]] went on record as an admirer of the "sonority and exquisite execution" of the post-war work.&lt;ref name=History2005/&gt;

===Piano performance competition===
[[File:Rückansicht G-S Klavier.JPG|thumb|upright|left|A Grotrian-Steinweg upright piano with its signature radial rear brace adding strength]]
In 1954, Grotrian-Steinweg initiated a piano-playing competition known as ''Grotrian-Steinweg Klavierspielwettbewerb'', featuring young pianists from music schools. The competition took place in the Braunschweig location of the Hertie department store, with audience applause used as the gauge to determine the winner. In 1968, Grotrian-Steinweg entered into talks with the German National Music Council and the [[Hochschule für Musik, Theater und Medien Hannover|Hannover University of Music]] to increase the scale of the competition. It increased in odd years to encompass a national and international scope. Pianists such as [[:de:Ragna Schirmer|Ragna Schirmer]] and [[Lars Vogt]] gained notice as winners of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.braunschweig.de/kultur_tourismus/veranstaltungen/kalender.html?mode=details&amp;event_id=119362 |title=Internationaler Grotrian-Steinweg Klavierspielwettbewerb |work=Veranstaltungen in Braunschweig: Musik |publisher=Braunschweig.de |language=German |accessdate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trademark conflict===
The first [[trademark]] friction between the two piano manufacturers  occurred in 1895 when Steinway &amp; Sons sued to stop Grotrian-Steinweg from using the name "Steinweg" on its pianos. Steinway lost the case, but in January 1919, Willi and Kurt Grotrian decided to change the family surname to Grotrian-Steinweg to protect the trademark of the family business, in the hope of preventing further lawsuits.&lt;ref name=Knize303&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EAhBfomMZ4UC&amp;pg=PA303 |page=303 |title=Grand Obsession: A Piano Odyssey |last=Knize |first=Perri |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2009 |isbn=0-7432-7639-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Petersen80/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nicholas2004&gt;{{cite journal |work=International Piano Quarterly |year=2004 |volume=8 |pages=54–57 |title=Ibach &amp; Grotrian-Steinweg |last=Nicholas |first=Jeremy |publisher=Gramophone Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925, the company established a sales presence in the US as a [[Delaware General Corporation Law|Delaware corporation]] called Grotrian-Steinweg Company.&lt;ref name=MacMahon1973&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ny.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19731001_0000302.SNY.htm/qx |title=Grotrian v.

A family representative of Steinway went to Germany to discuss the problem directly with the Grotrian-Steinweg family. Arriving at a private agreement, the two family leaders smoked a "peace cigar"&lt;ref name=MacMahon1973/&gt; and Grotrian-Steinweg subsequently stopped using the names "Steinweg" and "Grotrian-Steinweg" in the US.&lt;ref name=MacMahon1973/&gt; In 1930 the Delaware corporation was dissolved, and in the next three years exports from Grotrian-Steinweg to the US decreased then halted completely. In 1950, Grotrian-Steinweg relinquished its old 1926 trademark application, which had never been published.&lt;ref name=MacMahon1973/&gt;

In 1961, Knut Grotrian-Steinweg (b. 1935) joined the company. In 1966, the company formed a contract with [[Wurlitzer]] to sell Grotrian-Steinweg pianos in the US, and the Steinway company brought suit in New York.&lt;ref name=Knize303/&gt; The case lasted nine years, winding its way through trial courts and district courts, presenting the litigants' counterclaims and appeals. In 1975, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] heard the arguments in ''Grotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th. Steinweg Nachf. v. Steinway &amp; Sons''. Grotrian-Steinweg, the plaintiff,  argued that their brand was long established, predating Steinway's in Germany. Steinway &amp; Sons, defendant, counterclaimed that their brand, well known and strongly positive in the US, was weakened by consumers' confusion as to whether the pianos were related. The court affirmed the lower court's ruling in favor of the defendant that piano buyers would be misled in their "initial interest" in the two piano brands; "a potential Steinway buyer may satisfy himself that the less expensive Grotrian-Steinweg is at least as good, if not better, than a Steinway."&lt;ref name=court-appeal&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit|title=523 F.2d 1331: Grotrian, Helfferich, Schulz, Th.

The case was the first instance of a court defining the concept now known as "[[initial interest confusion]]".&lt;ref name=Rothman2005&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cardozolawreview.com/PastIssues/ROTHMAN.FINAL.VERSION.pdf |title=Initial Interest Confusion: Standing at the Crossroads of Trademark Law |last=Rothman |first=Jennifer E. |work=Cardozo Law Review |pages=114–116 |volume=27 |number=1 |date=April 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430122258/http://www.cardozolawreview.com/PastIssues/ROTHMAN.FINAL.VERSION.pdf |archivedate=30 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; District Judge [[Lloyd Francis MacMahon]] wrote: "Misled into an initial interest, a potential Steinway buyer may satisfy himself that the less expensive Grotrian-Steinweg is at least as good, if not better, than a Steinway."&lt;ref name=Rothman2005/&gt; MacMahon's idea about the "initial interest" confusion was confirmed by Appeals Court Judge [[William H. Timbers]], writing, "such initial confusion works an injury to Steinway."&lt;ref name=Rothman2005/&gt;

The English-language section of Grotrian's website does not have any reference to the surname "Steinweg", unlike the French-, German- and Russian-language versions. This is likely a result of the lawsuit and a wish to minimize liability.&lt;ref name=Rothman2005/&gt;

In 1974, the Grotrian-Steinweg family built a new factory in northwest Braunschweig on Grotrian-Steinweg Street, very near [[Bundesautobahn 2]], a major east–west highway. After Helmut and Erwin Grotrian-Steinweg supervised the construction they retired, leaving Helmut's son Knut in charge. This factory is the current location of Grotrian-Steinweg production.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; In 1999, Knut Grotrian-Steinweg stepped down from active supervision of the company, and put day-to-day control in the hands of Burkhard Stein, an industrial manager and piano builder.&lt;ref name=KeyboardEncyclopedia/&gt; As of 2012, the Grotrian-Steinweg company is owned by the daughters of Erwin Grotrian,&lt;ref name=History2005/&gt; with sixth-generation Jobst Grotrian (b. 1969), Knut's son, a shareholder.&lt;ref name=KeyboardEncyclopedia/&gt; Annually, the company produces about 500 [[upright piano]]s in six sizes and 100 grand pianos in five sizes.&lt;ref name=Fine166&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pianobuyer.com/fall11/166.html |page=166 |title=Grotrian |last=Fine |first=Larry |authorlink=Larry Fine (pianos) |work=Acoustic &amp; Digital Piano Buyer |date=Fall 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522170937/http://www.pianobuyer.com/fall11/166.html |archivedate=22 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 20 concert grands are made per year—each one requiring 8 months of manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;Knize, 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EAhBfomMZ4UC&amp;pg=PA302 p. 302].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the company issued a special 175-year anniversary model, a {{convert|46.5|in|cm|adj=on}} upright called ''Composé Exclusif'', of which 50 were produced.&lt;ref name=Fine166/&gt;

In 2011, [[Larry Fine (pianos)|Larry Fine]] said that Modern Grotrian-Steinweg pianos are among the "highest quality"—on par with Hamburg-built Steinways, [[Fazioli]]s, and [[Bösendorfer]]s, and higher quality, in his opinion, than New York-built Steinways.&lt;ref name=Fine2011&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pianobuyer.com/fall11/44.html |page=44 |title=The New Piano Market Today |last=Fine |first=Larry |authorlink=Larry Fine (pianos) |work=Acoustic &amp; Digital Piano Buyer |date=Fall 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203075611/http://www.pianobuyer.com/fall11/44.html |archivedate=3 December 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michelle Borromeo Actor Headshots 30.jpg|thumb|180px|Head shot of actress]] 
A '''head shot''' or '''headshot''' is a modern (mostly digital files ) [[portrait]] where the focus is on the person. The term is usually applied for professional profile images on social media, the 'about us page' or a corporate website and promotional pictures of [[actor]]s, [[model (profession)|models]], and [[author]]s. 

==Entertainment industry==
In [[theater]], film, and [[television]], [[actor]]s, [[Model (person)|models]], [[singers]], and other entertainers are often required to include a head shot, along with their résumé, when applying for a job. These head shots are usually more artistic: they intend to portray the subject in the best possible light.&lt;ref name="popphoto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popphoto.com/how-to/2015/04/tips-pro-peter-hurley-high-end-headshot-photography|title=Tips From a Pro: Peter Hurley on High-End Headshot Photography|last=Kolonia|first=Peter|date=9 April 2015|publisher=Popular Photography|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Head shots often feature the actor or actress facing off-center.  A performer will often have head shots expressing different poses and expressions to give a potential employer an idea of the subject's range of appearances or expressions. These types of head shots are called "looks". It is common for an actor to have different head shots for different roles, but for the most part these consist of a change in attire. The head shots that include a person’s shoulders are called "three-quarter" shots. Previously, head shots were often in black-and-white; however, most head shots are now taken in color.&lt;ref name="backstage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backstage.com/advice-for-actors/headshots/taking-your-best-shot/|title=Taking Your Best Shot|last=Sanville|first=Michael|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Backstage|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actors' head shots, when printed and not simply uploaded online to an industry database, are done in an 8"×10" format. Other promotional images, for example, press shots and lobby prints, may be in many different aspect ratios. Acting head shots are often not photographic prints, instead they are typically printed via a lithographic or laser process.

The main purpose of an actor's head shot is identification. Therefore, the most important feature of an actor's head shot is that it represents the subject. Theatrical head shots are usually very "neutral" looking shots of the actor clearly showing their facial features.

Head shots are intended to show a person as they currently appear and reflect their best qualities. Therefore, if an actor's hair has been recently cut or colored, they would often get a new head shot to reflect their new image. Additionally, if an actor has a scar or facial blemish, it is expected to be visible on the head shot and not digitally removed from the image. Pimples or spots are temporary and, therefore, are usually digitally retouched.

==Modeling industry==
[[File:Modelling Headshot by Headshot London Photography.jpg|thumb|180px|Modelling headshot]]
Modeling head shots or comp cards, sometimes also called tear sheets, are a compilation of images for casting in one sheet with a résumé of work, name and relevant statistics. They are often done in color; however in some jurisdictions, such as the UK, they may be in black-and-white. Models often use them for castings and modeling work applications. A close-up head shot is often required to show a model's skin complexion for beauty work.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Modeling head shots are usually used for:
* Comp cards or tear sheets
* Modeling portfolios
* TV advertisements for skin products
* Magazine advertisements for creams and other skin or hair products
* Online industry profiles

Models' head shots are also often professionally retouched to ensure their close-up beauty photograph appears perfect without blemishes or spots.

[[Comp card]]s are one of the cornerstones of a model’s “marketing materials”. They are about 5½×8” and printed on both sides. Almost all 
comp cards are in color but may include black-and-white images. A model may have four to five images on the comp card and at least one of these images will be a head shot.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Corporate and business head shots==
[[File:Corporate Headshot of Douglas Anderson.jpg|alt=|thumb|269x269px|Example of corporate head shot featuring entrepreneur and business coach Douglas Anderson of DA Talent]]
Corporate head shots are portraits often produced digitally and used for engaging in social media, the 'about us' page and industry specialty sites. A ''headshot'' or ''head shot'' is often used for branding and to showcase the executive team, style and personality.  Corporations will use the headshot to merge branding between the people working for them and its agency. 

Corporate head shots serve a variety of purposes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artofheadshots.com/professional-profile-picture/|title=Professional profile picture|last1=Locke|first1=David|date=October 26, 2017|website=artofheadshots.com|publisher=Business professional specialized in headshot photography|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branding headshots==
Branding headshots may be a corporate or business headshot with the difference being that the image is designed to convey the individual's or a corporate branding identity. A corporation may chose a streamlined background for all its headshots while an individual may chose an action, experience or background objects to identify his or her brand. Large corporations, firms and/or agencies will usually have a manual for the type and style of headshot to be photographed.

[[File:Blackhawk-spiritbeing.jpg|thumb|[[Ledger art]]work by [[Lakota people|Lakota]] artist [[Black Hawk (artist)|Black Hawk]] representing a dream of a thunder being. c.1880]]

The '''heyoka''' ('''''heyókȟa,''''' also spelled "haokah," "heyokha") is a kind of [[sacred clown]] in the culture of the [[Lakota people]] of the [[Great Plains]] of North America. The heyoka is a contrarian, [[jester]], and [[satirist]], who speaks, moves and reacts in an opposite fashion to the people around them. Only those having visions of the thunder beings of the west, the ''[[Wakíŋyaŋ]],'' and who are recognized as such by the community, can take on the ceremonial role of the heyoka.

The Lakota medicine man, [[Black Elk]], described himself as a ''heyoka,'' saying he had been visited as a child by the thunder beings.&lt;ref name="Neihardt1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Gneisenau Neihardt|title=The Sixth Grandfather: Black Elk's Teachings Given to John G. Neihardt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bXElCJTANaoC&amp;pg=PA3|year=1985|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-6564-6|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbirds]]).

==Social role==
The ''Heyókȟa'' is thought of as being backwards-forwards, upside-down, or contrary in nature. This manifests by their doing things backwards or unconventionally—riding a horse backwards, wearing clothes inside-out, or speaking in a backwards language. For example, if food is scarce, a ''heyókȟa'' may sit around and complain about how full he is; during a baking hot heat wave, a ''heyókȟa'' might shiver with cold and put on gloves and cover himself with a thick blanket. Similarly, when it is freezing he might wander around naked, complaining that it is too hot. A unique example is the famous ''heyókȟa'' sacred clown called "the Straighten-Outer":

{{Quote|He was always running around with a hammer trying to flatten round and curvy things (soup bowls, eggs, wagon wheels, etc.), thus making them straight. | [[John Fire Lame Deer]]&lt;ref name=LD250&gt;Lame Deer, John (Fire) and Richard Erdoes. ''Lame Deer, Seeker of Visions.'' Simon and Schuster, New York, New York (1972). Paperback {{ISBN|0-671-55392-5}}. p.250&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''heyókȟa'' symbolizes and portrays many aspects of the sacred beings, the [[Wakíŋyaŋ]]. His satire presents important questions by fooling around. They ask difficult questions, and say things others are too afraid to say. Their behavior poses questions as do [[Zen]] [[koans]]. By reading between the lines, the audience is able to think about things not usually thought about, or to look at things in a different way.

Principally, the ''heyókȟa'' functions both as a mirror and a teacher, using extreme behaviors to mirror others, and forcing them to examine their own doubts, fears, hatreds, and weaknesses. ''Heyókȟa'' have the power to heal emotional pain; such power comes from the experience of shame—they sing of shameful events in their lives, beg for food, and live as clowns. They provoke laughter in distressing situations of despair, and provoke fear and chaos when people feel complacent and overly secure, to keep them from taking themselves too seriously or believing they are more powerful than they are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Elizabeth Hoffman|title=Fools and Jesters in Literature, Art, and History: A Bio-bibliographical Sourcebook|date=1998|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0-313-29785-1|pages=246–248|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLtoRB9Wy-sC&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=heyoka%20laughter&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=The Heyoka of the Sioux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, sacred clowns serve an important role in shaping tribal codes. Unbound by societal constraints, ''heyókȟa'' are able to violate cultural taboos freely and thus critique established customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swann|first1=Brian|title=Coming to Light: Contemporary Translations of the Native Literatures of North America|date=1996|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0-679-74358-8|page=433|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eh2cL7XMFkkC&amp;lpg=PA433&amp;dq=heyoka%20taboos&amp;pg=PA433#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paradoxically, however, by violating these norms and taboos, they help to define the accepted boundaries, rules, and societal guidelines for ethical and moral behavior. They are the only ones who can ask "Why?" about sensitive topics; they use satire to question the specialists and carriers of sacred knowledge or those in positions of power and authority.

{{Quote|For people who are as poor as us, who have lost everything, who had to endure so much death and sadness, laughter is a precious gift. When we were dying like flies from white man's disease, when we were driven into reservations, when the government rations did not arrive and we were starving, watching the pranks and capers of Heyókȟa were{{sic}} a blessing.|[[John Fire Lame Deer]]&lt;ref name=LD250 /&gt;}}

==Vision of thunder beings==
{{Quote|Only those who have had visions of the thunder beings of the west can act as heyokas.  They have sacred power and they share some of this with all the people, but they do it through funny actions.  When a vision comes from the thunder beings of the West, it comes with terror like a thunder storm; but when the storm of vision has passed, the world is greener and happier; for wherever the truth of vision comes upon the world, it is like a rain. The world, you see, is happier after the terror of the storm.|[[Black Elk]]&lt;ref name="ElkNeihardt2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Black Elk|author2=John G. Neihardt|title=Black Elk Speaks: Being the Life Story of a Holy Man of the Oglala Sioux, the Premier Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7p9VqRLiKqcC&amp;pg=PA149|date=16 October 2008|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-2540-5|pages=149–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[Lakota mythology]], ''Heyókȟa'' is also a spirit of [[thunder]] and [[lightning]].  He is said to use the wind as sticks to beat the drum of thunder. His emotions are portrayed opposite the norm; he laughs when he is sad and cries when he is happy, cold makes him sweat and heat makes him shiver. In art, he is depicted as having two horns, which marks him as a hunting spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Borges, Jorge Luis. (1969).'' The Book Of Imaginary Beings''&lt;/ref&gt;.  In some visions, he also appeared as a snow bird, a swallow, a horse, a dog, a night hawk, a frog, or a dragonfly.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, James R. (1980).'' Lakota Belief and Ritual'' p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  

==In popular culture==
In 2013, [[Half Acre Beer Company|Half Acre]] [[brewery]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] released what they called Heyoka [[India Pale Ale|IPA]], which became one of their signature [[beer]]s. It won a [[silver medal]] at the [[Great American Beer Festival]] in October 2014. Members of the [[American Indian Movement]] and other Native American activists complained, arguing that giving the name of a sacred figure in Lakota spirituality to a beer constituted [[cultural appropriation]]. Half Acre renamed their beer ''Senita'' (perhaps after the [[Pachycereus schottii|Senita cactus]] found in the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] that is depicted on the former ''Heyoka'' beer can).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/food/ct-half-acre-heyoka-senita-20150105-story.html "Half Acre Beer renames Heyoka as Senita after complaints"], ''Chicago Tribune,'' 5 January 2015; Retrieved January 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2804">'''Historical pragmatics''' is the study of [[pragmatics|linguistic pragmatics]] over time. Research in historical pragmatics is mainly carried out on written [[text corpus|corpora]] as recordings of spoken language are a relatively recent phenomenon.

== State of the art ==
Since the late 1970s, historical linguists have discovered their growing interest in pragmatic questions—first in German, then in Romance linguistics. The field has also been attracting more and more colleagues from English linguistics since the mid-1990s, with [[Andreas Jucker]] being one of the first and most influential proponents.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. especially Jucker 1995 and Jucker/Fritz/Lebsanft 1999a for an overview on the development of this discipline.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal of Historical Pragmatics'' is edited by Andreas Jucker and Irma Taavitsainen.

== Methodology ==
Historical pragmatics has to rely exclusively on written corpora. This leads to the question how can we find out about the ways people talked to each other in medieval and early modern times? The difficulty of unmasking spoken language in earlier periods has been discussed several times; for medieval times there are practically no reflexes of or on spoken language, and a majority of studies on historical pragmatics do not delve into text prior to the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., e.g, the overviews in Jucker et al. 1999b and Jucker 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* (the last paragraph) */ slight tweak to the wording. In particular, the difference between "counteracting" and "overpowering" may be important to the meaning of the sentence which now contains both of those words. The word "counteracting" can mean to cancel or mitigate -- PARTIALLY or otherwise --  the influence of someone or some thing, while the use of the word "overpowering" clearly applies in cases where the influence of the thing being counteracted is 100% -- (completely) -- overpowered.</comment>

Hofstadter's law was a part of Douglas Hofstadter's 1979 book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach|Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]]''. The "law" is a statement regarding the difficulty of accurately estimating the time it will take to complete tasks of substantial complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Electronic technologies and preservation |last1=Waters |first1=Donald J. |authorlink= |author2=Commission on Preservation and Access |year=1992 |publisher=Commission on Preservation and Access |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbHgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Hofstadter's+law%22&amp;dq=%22Hofstadter's+law%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wDXvTcr1H6vOiALRubz1AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often cited by [[programmer]]s, especially in discussions of techniques to improve productivity, such as ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]'' or [[extreme programming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=David M. Goldschmidt |date=October 3, 1983 |title=The trials and tribulations of a cottage industrialist |journal=[[InfoWorld]] |volume=5 |issue=40 |pages=16 |publisher=InfoWorld Media Group, Inc. |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2C8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=%22Hofstadter's+law%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=wDXvTcr1H6vOiALRubz1AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Hofstadter's%20law%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The recursive nature of the law is a reflection of the widely experienced difficulty of estimating complex tasks despite all best efforts, including knowing that the task is complex.

The law was initially introduced in connection with a discussion of [[Computer chess|chess-playing computers]], where top-level players were continually beating machines, even though the machines outweighed the players in recursive analysis. The intuition was that the players were able to focus on particular positions instead of following every possible line of play to its conclusion. Hofstadter wrote in 1979, "In the early days of computer chess, people used to estimate that it would be ten years until a computer (or program) was world champion. But after ten years had passed, it seemed that the day a computer would become world champion was still more than ten years away ... &lt;!-- sic --&gt; This is just one more piece of evidence for the rather recursive Hofstadter's Law:"&lt;ref&gt;''Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid'', Basic Books 1979, Vintage Books Edition, 1980, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid''. 20th anniversary ed., 1999, p. 152. {{ISBN|0-465-02656-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Unwritten Laws: The Unofficial Rules of Life as Handed Down by Murphy and Other Sages |last=Rawson |first=Hugh |authorlink= |year=2002 |publisher=Book Sales |location= |isbn= |page=115 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6OqbX7Z59wMC&amp;q=%22Hofstadter's+law%22+chess&amp;dq=%22Hofstadter's+law%22+chess&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2ATwTcCXE4ugsQOSxvGYDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hofstadter's Law &amp;#124; Unwritten Laws of Life|url=http://lawsoflife.co.uk/hofstadters-law/|accessdate=August 9, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826030032/http://lawsoflife.co.uk/hofstadters-law/|archivedate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, that day did indeed come, when [[Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov|Deep Blue defeated Garry Kasparov in 1997]], which indicates that the [[Law of Accelerating Returns]] may take effect when the task is repeated, thus counteracting -- and [in some cases] overpowering -- Hofstadter's law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="75251">An '''intelligent tutoring system''' ('''ITS''')  is a [[computer system]] that aims to provide immediate and customized instruction or feedback to learners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Intelligent Tutoring Systems: Lessons Learned |author=Joseph Psotka, Sharon A. Mutter|year=1988|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |isbn=0-8058-0192-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually without requiring intervention from a human teacher.  ITSs have the common goal of enabling learning in a meaningful and effective manner by using a variety of computing technologies.  There are many examples of ITSs being used in both formal education and professional settings in which they have demonstrated their capabilities and limitations.  There is a close relationship between intelligent tutoring, cognitive learning theories and design; and there is ongoing research to improve the effectiveness of ITS. An ITS typically aims to replicate the demonstrated benefits of one-to-one, personalized tutoring, in contexts where students would otherwise have access to one-to-many instruction from a single teacher (e.g., classroom lectures), or no teacher at all (e.g., online homework).&lt;ref name="VanLehn" /&gt; ITSs are often designed with the goal of providing access to high quality education to each and every student.

==History==

===Early mechanical systems===

[[File:Skinner teaching machine 08.jpg|thumb|Skinner teaching machine 08]]

The possibility of intelligent machines have been discussed for centuries. [[Blaise Pascal]] created the first calculating machine capable of mathematical functions in the 17th century simply called [[Pascal's calculator|Pascal's Calculator]]. At this time the mathematician and philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] envisioned machines capable of reasoning and applying rules of logic to settle disputes (Buchanan, 2006).&lt;ref name = "Buchanan"&gt;Buchanan, B. (2006). A (Very) Brief History of Artificial Intelligence. AI Magazine 26(4). pp.53-60.&lt;/ref&gt; These early works contributed to the development of the computer and future applications.

The concept of intelligent machines for instructional use date back as early as 1924, when [[Sidney Pressey]] of Ohio State University created a mechanical teaching machine to instruct students without a human teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.coe.uh.edu/smcneil/cuin6373/idhistory/pressey.html Sidney Pressey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Fry"&gt;Fry, E. (1960). Teaching Machine Dichotomy: Skinner vs. Pressey. Pshychological Reports(6) 11-14. Southern University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His machine resembled closely a typewriter with several keys and a window that provided the learner with questions. The Pressey Machine allowed user input and provided immediate feedback by recording their score on a counter.&lt;ref name = "Shute"&gt;Shute, V. J., &amp; Psotka, J. (1994). Intelligent Tutoring Systems: Past, Present, and Future. Human resources directorate manpower and personnel research division.  pp. 2-52&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressey himself was influenced by [[Edward L. Thorndike]], a learning theorist and educational psychologist at the Columbia University Teacher College of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Thorndike posited laws for maximizing learning.  Thorndike's laws included the [[law of effect]], the [[law of exercise]], and the [[law of recency]]. Following later standards, Pressey's teaching and testing machine would not be considered intelligent as it was mechanically run and was based on one question and answer at a time,&lt;ref name = "Shute"/&gt; but it set an early precedent for future projects.
By the 1950s and 1960s, new perspectives on learning were emerging. [[Bf skinner|Burrhus Frederic "B.F." Skinner]] at [[Harvard University]] did not agree with Thorndike's learning theory of connectionism or Pressey's teaching machine. Rather, Skinner was a [[behaviourist]] who believed that learners should construct their answers and not rely on recognition.&lt;ref name = "Fry"/&gt; He too, constructed a teaching machine structured using an incremental mechanical system that would reward students for correct responses to questions.&lt;ref name = "Fry"/&gt;

===Early electronic systems===

In the period following the second world war, mechanical binary systems gave way to binary based electronic machines.  These machines were considered intelligent when compared to their mechanical counterparts as they had the capacity to make logical decisions. However, the study of defining and recognizing a machine intelligence was still in its infancy.

[[Alan turing|Alan Turing]], a mathematician, logician and computer scientist, linked computing systems to thinking. One of his most notable papers outlined a hypothetical test to assess the intelligence of a machine which came to be known as the [[Turing test]].  Essentially, the test would have a person communicate with two other agents, a human and a computer asking questions to both recipients.  The computer passes the test if it can respond in such a way that the human posing the questions cannot differentiate between the other human and the computer.  The Turing test has been used in its essence for more than two decades as a model for current ITS development.  The main ideal for ITS systems is to effectively communicate.&lt;ref name = "Shute"/&gt;  As early as the 1950s programs were emerging displaying intelligent features. Turing's work as well as later projects by researchers such as Allen Newell, Clifford Shaw, and Herb Simon showed programs capable of creating logical proofs and theorems. Their program, [[Logic Theorist|The Logic Theorist]] exhibited complex symbol manipulation and even generation of new information without direct human control and is considered by some to be the first AI program. Such breakthroughs would inspire the new field of [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]] officially named in 1956 by [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] in 1956 at the [[Dartmouth workshop|Dartmouth Conference]].&lt;ref name="Buchanan" /&gt; This conference was the first of its kind that was devoted to scientists and research in the field of AI.

[[Image:Platovterm1981.jpg|right|thumb|The PLATO V CAI terminal in 1981]]

The latter part of the 1960s and 1970s saw many new CAI (Computer-Assisted instruction) projects that built on advances in computer science. The creation of the [[ALGOL]] programming language in 1958 enabled many schools and universities to begin developing Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) programs. Major computer vendors and federal agencies in the US such as IBM, HP, and the National Science Foundation funded the development of these projects.&lt;ref name = "Chambers"&gt;Chambers, J., &amp; Sprecher, J. (1983). Computer-Assisted Instruction: Its Use in the Classroom. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Early implementations in education focused on programmed instruction (PI), a structure based on a computerized input-output system.  Although many supported this form of instruction,  there was limited evidence supporting its effectiveness.&lt;ref name = "Shute"/&gt; The programming language [[Logo (programming language)|LOGO]] was created in 1967 by [[Wally Feurzeig]], [[Cynthia Solomon]], and [[Seymour Papert]] as a language streamlined for education. PLATO, an educational terminal featuring displays, animations, and touch controls that could store and deliver large amounts of course material, was developed by Donald Bitzer in the University of Illinois in the early 1970s. Along with these, many other CAI projects were initiated in many countries including the US, the UK, and Canada.&lt;ref name = "Chambers"/&gt;

At the same time that CAI was gaining interest, Jaime Carbonell suggested that computers could act as a teacher rather than just a tool (Carbonell, 1970). A new perspective would emerge that focused on the use of computers to intelligently coach students called Intelligent Computer Assisted Instruction or Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Where CAI used a behaviourist perspective on learning based on Skinner's theories (Dede &amp; Swigger, 1988),&lt;ref name = "Larkin"&gt;Larkin, J, &amp; Chabay, R. (Eds.). (1992). Computer Assisted Instruction and Intelligent Tutoring Systems: Shared Goals and Complementary Approaches. Hillsdale, New Jersey: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; ITS drew from work in cognitive psychology, computer science, and especially artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name = "Larkin"/&gt; There was a shift in AI research at this time as systems moved from the logic focus of the previous decade to knowledge based systems—systems could make intelligent decisions based on prior knowledge (Buchanan, 2006).&lt;ref name="Buchanan" /&gt; Such a program was created by Seymour Papert and Ira Goldstein who created [[Dendral]], a system that predicted possible chemical structures from existing data. Further work began to showcase analogical reasoning and language processing. These changes with a focus on knowledge had big implications for how computers could be used in instruction. The technical requirements of ITS, however, proved to be higher and more complex than CAI systems and ITS systems would find limited success at this time.&lt;ref name = "Chambers"/&gt;

Towards the latter part of the 1970s interest in CAI technologies began to wane.&lt;ref name = "Chambers"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Anderson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = K | year = 1986 | title = Computer-Assisted Instruction | url = | journal = Journal of Medical Systems | volume = 10 | issue = 2| pages = 163–171 | doi=10.1007/bf00993122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computers were still expensive and not as available as expected. Developers and instructors were reacting negatively to the high cost of developing CAI programs, the inadequate provision for instructor training, and the lack of resources.&lt;ref name = "Anderson"/&gt;

===Microcomputers and intelligent systems===

The microcomputer revolution in the late 1970s and early 1980s helped to revive CAI development and jumpstart development of ITS systems. Personal computers such as the [[Apple II series|Apple 2]], [[Commodore PET]], and [[TRS-80]] reduced the resources required to own computers and by 1981, 50% of US schools were using computers (Chambers &amp; Sprecher, 1983).&lt;ref name="Chambers"/&gt; Several CAI projects utilized the Apple 2 as a system to deliver CAI programs in high schools and universities including the British Columbia Project and California State University Project in 1981.&lt;ref name="Chambers"/&gt;

The early 1980s would also see Intelligent Computer-Assisted Instruction (ICAI) and ITS goals diverge from their roots in CAI. As CAI became increasingly focused on deeper interactions with content created for a specific area of interest, ITS sought to create systems that focused on knowledge of the task and the ability to generalize that knowledge in non-specific ways (Larkin &amp; Chabay, 1992).&lt;ref name = "Larkin"/&gt; The key goals set out for ITS were to be able to teach a task as well as perform it, adapting dynamically to its situation. In the transition from CAI to ICAI systems, the computer would have to distinguish not only between the correct and incorrect response but the type of incorrect response to adjust the type of instruction. Research in [[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]] and [[Cognitive psychology|Cognitive Psychology]] fueled the new principles of ITS. Psychologists considered how a computer could solve problems and perform 'intelligent' activities. An ITS programme would have to be able to represent, store and retrieve knowledge and even search its own database to derive its own new knowledge to respond to learner's questions. Basically, early specifications for ITS or (ICAI) require it to "diagnose errors and tailor remediation based on the diagnosis" (Shute &amp; Psotka, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;9).&lt;ref name = "Shute"/&gt;  The idea of diagnosis and remediation is still in use today when programming ITS.

A key breakthrough in ITS research was the creation of LISPITS, a program that implemented ITS principles in a practical way and showed promising effects increasing student performance. LISPITS was developed and researched in 1983 as an ITS system for teaching students the LISP programming language (Corbett &amp; Anderson, 1992).&lt;ref name = "Corbett"&gt;Corbett, A.T., &amp; Anderson, J. R. (1992). LISP Intelligent Tutoring System Research in Skill Acquisition. In Larkin, J. &amp; Chabay, R. (Eds.) Computer assisted instruction and intelligent tutoring systems: shared goals and complementary approaches (pp.73-110) Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; LISPITS could identify mistakes and provide constructive feedback to students while they were performing the exercise. The system was found to decrease the time required to complete the exercises while improving student test scores (Corbett &amp; Anderson, 1992).&lt;ref name = "Corbett" /&gt; Other ITS systems beginning to develop around this time include TUTOR created by Logica in 1984 as a general instructional tool&lt;ref name = "Ford"&gt;Ford, L. A New Intelligent Tutoring System (2008) British Journal of Educational Technology, 39(2), 311-318&lt;/ref&gt; and PARNASSUS created in Carnegie Mellon University in 1989 for language instruction.&lt;ref name = "Bailin"&gt;Bailin, A &amp; Levin, L. Introduction: Intelligent Computer Assisted Language Instruction (1989) Computers and the Humanities, 23, 3-11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern ITS===
After the implementation of initial ITS, more researchers created a number of ITS for different students. In the late 20th century, Intelligent Tutoring Tools (ITTs) was developed by the Byzantium project, which involved six universities. The ITTs were general purpose tutoring system builders and many institutions had positive feedback while using them. (Kinshuk, 1996)&lt;ref&gt;Kinshuk (1996). Computer aided learning for entry level Accountancy students. PhD Thesis, De Montfort University, England, July 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; This builder, ITT, would produce an Intelligent Tutoring Applet (ITA) for different subject areas. Different teachers created the ITAs and built up a large inventory of knowledge that was accessible by others through the Internet. Once an ITS was created, teachers could copy it and modify it for future use. This system was efficient and flexible. However, Kinshuk and Patel believed that the ITS was not designed from an educational point of view and was not developed based on the actual needs of students and teachers (Kinshuk and Patel, 1997).&lt;ref&gt;Kinshuk, and Ashok Patel. (1997) A Conceptual Framework for Internet Based Intelligent Tutoring Systems.

Modern day ITSs typically try to replicate the role of a teacher or a teaching assistant, and increasingly automate pedagogical functions such as problem generation, problem selection, and feedback generation. However, given a current shift towards blended learning models, recent work on ITSs has begun focusing on ways these systems can effectively leverage the complementary strengths of human-led instruction from a teacher&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Miller, W.

There were three ITS projects that functioned based on conversational dialogue: [[AutoTutor]], Atlas (Freedman, 1999),&lt;ref&gt;Freedman, R. 1999. Atlas: A Plan Manager for Mixed-Initiative, Multimodal Dialogue. (1999) AAAI Workshop on Mixed-Initiative Intelligence&lt;/ref&gt; and Why2. The idea behind these projects was that since students learn best by constructing knowledge themselves, the programs would begin with leading questions for the students and would give out answers as a last resort. AutoTutor's students focused on answering questions about computer technology, Atlas's students focused on solving quantitative problems, and Why2's students focused on explaining physical systems qualitatively.

Articicial Intelligence, 106-111.&lt;/ref&gt; tend to provide hints and immediate feedback for students when students have trouble answering the questions. They could guess their answers and have correct answers without deep understanding of the concepts. Research was done with a small group of students using Atlas and Andes respectively. The results showed that students using Atlas made significant improvements compared with students who used Andes.&lt;ref&gt;Shelby, R. N.; Schulze, K. G.; Treacy, D. J.; Wintersgill, M. C.; VanLehn, K.; and Weinstein, A. (2001) The Assessment of Andes Tutor.&lt;/ref&gt; However, since the above systems require analysis of students' dialogues, improvement is yet to be made so that more complicated dialogues can be managed.

==Structure==

Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) consist of four basic components based on a general consensus amongst researchers (Nwana,1990;&lt;ref name = "Nwana"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nwana | first1 = H. S. | year = 1990 | title = Intelligent tutoring systems: An overview | url = | journal = Artificial Intelligence Review | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 251–277 | doi=10.1007/bf00168958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freedman, 2000;&lt;ref name = "Freedman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freedman | first1 = R | year = 2000 | title = What is an intelligent tutoring system? | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 15–16 | doi=10.1145/350752.350756}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nkambou et al., 2010&lt;ref name = "Nkambou"&gt;Nkambou, R., Mizoguchi, R., &amp; Bourdeau, J. (2010). Advances in intelligent tutoring systems. Heidelberg: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;):

#The Domain model
#The Student model
#The Tutoring model, and
#The User interface model
The ''domain model'' (also known as the [[cognitive model]] or expert knowledge model) is built on a theory of learning, such as the [[ACT-R]] theory which tries to take into account all the possible steps required to solve a problem. More specifically, this model "contains the concepts, rules, and problem-solving strategies of the domain to be learned. It can fulfill several roles: as a source of expert knowledge, a standard for evaluating the student's performance or for detecting errors, etc." (Nkambou et al., 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;4).&lt;ref name = "Nkambou"/&gt; Another approach for developing domain models is based on Stellan Ohlsson's Theory of Learning from performance errors,&lt;ref&gt;Ohlsson, S. (1996) Learning from Performance Errors. Psychological Review, 103, 241-262.&lt;/ref&gt; known as constraint-based modelling (CBM).&lt;ref&gt;Ohlsson, S. (1992) Constraint-based Student Modeling. Artificial Intelligence in Education, 3(4), 429-447.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the domain model is presented as a set of constraints on correct solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Mitrovic, A., Ohlsson, S. (2006) Constraint-Based Knowledge Representation for Individualized Instruction. Computer Science and Information Systems, 3(1), 1-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ohlsson, S., Mitrovic, A. (2007) Fidelity and Efficiency of Knowledge representations for intelligent tutoring systems.  Technology, Instruction, Cognition and Learning, 5(2), 101-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''student model'' can be thought of as an overlay on the domain model. It is considered as the core component of an ITS paying special attention to student's cognitive and affective states and their evolution as the learning process advances. As the student works step-by-step through their problem solving process, an ITS engages in a process called ''model tracing''. Anytime the student model deviates from the domain model, the system identifies, or ''flags'', that an error has occurred. On the other hand, in constraint-based tutors the student model is represented as an overlay on the constraint set.&lt;ref&gt;Mitrovic, A. and Ohlsson, S. (1999) Evaluation of a Constraint-Based Tutor for a Database Language. Int. J. Artificial Intelligence in Education, 10(3-4), 238-256.&lt;/ref&gt; Constraint-based tutors&lt;ref&gt;Mitrovic, A. (2010) Fifteen years of Constraint-Based Tutors: What we have achieved and where we are going. User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction, 22(1-2), 39-72.&lt;/ref&gt; evaluate the student's solution against the constraint set, and identify satisfied and violated constraints. if there are any violated constraints, the student's solution is incorrect, and the ITS provides feedback on those constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Mitrovic, A., Martin, B., Suraweera, P. (2007) Intelligent tutors for all: Constraint-based modeling methodology, systems and authoring. IEEE Intelligent Systems, 22(4), 38-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zakharov, K., Mitrovic, A., Ohlsson, S. (2005) Feedback Micro-engineering in EER-Tutor. In: C-K Looi, G. McCalla, B. Bredeweg, J. Breuker (eds) Proc. Artificial Intelligence in Education  AIED 2005, IOS Press, pp. 718-725.&lt;/ref&gt; Constraint-based tutors provide negative feedback (i.e. feedback on errors) and also positive feedback &lt;ref&gt;Mitrovic, A., Ohlsson, S., Barrow, D. (2013) The effect of positive feedback in a constraint-based intelligent tutoring system. Computers &amp; Education, 60(1), 264-272.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''tutor model'' accepts information from the domain and student models and makes choices about tutoring strategies and actions. At any point in the problem-solving process the learner may request guidance on what to do next, relative to their current location in the model. In addition, the system recognizes when the learner has deviated from the production rules of the model and provides timely feedback for the learner, resulting in a shorter period of time to reach proficiency with the targeted skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = H. | last2 = Koedinger | first2 = M. | year = 1997 | title = Intelligent tutoring goes to school in the Big City | url = | journal = International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 30–43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tutor model may contain several hundred production rules that can be said to exist in one of two states, ''learned'' or ''unlearned''.  Every time a student successfully applies a rule to a problem, the system updates a probability estimate that the student has learned the rule. The system continues to drill students on exercises that require effective application of a rule until the probability that the rule has been learned reaches at least 95% probability.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett, Albert T. and Anderson, John R., "Student Modeling and Mastery Learning in a Computer-Based Programming Tutor" (2008). Department of Psychology. Paper 18. http://repository.cmu.edu/psychology/18&lt;/ref&gt;

''Knowledge tracing'' tracks the learner's progress from problem to problem and builds a profile of strengths and weaknesses relative to the production rules. The cognitive tutoring system developed by [[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John Anderson]] at Carnegie Mellon University presents information from knowledge tracing as a ''skillometer'', a visual graph of the learner's success in each of the monitored skills related to solving algebra problems. When a learner requests a hint, or an error is flagged, the knowledge tracing data and the skillometer are updated in real-time.

The ''user interface'' component "integrates three types of information that are needed in carrying out a dialogue: knowledge about patterns of interpretation (to understand a speaker) and action (to generate utterances) within dialogues; domain knowledge needed for communicating content; and knowledge needed for communicating intent" (Padayachee, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;3).&lt;ref name = "Padayachee"&gt;Padayachee I. (2002). Intelligent Tutoring Systems: Architecture and Characteristics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nkambou et al. (2010) make mention of Nwana's (1990)&lt;ref name = "Nwana"/&gt; review of different architectures underlining a strong link between architecture and paradigm (or philosophy). Nwana (1990) declares, "[I]t is almost a rarity to find two ITSs based on the same architecture [which] results from the experimental nature of the work in the area" (p.&amp;nbsp;258). He further explains that differing tutoring philosophies emphasize different components of the learning process (i.e., domain, student or tutor). The architectural design of an ITS reflects this emphasis, and this leads to a variety of architectures, none of which, individually, can support all tutoring strategies (Nwana, 1990, as cited in Nkambou et al., 2010). Moreover, ITS projects may vary according to the relative level of intelligence of the components. As an example, a project highlighting intelligence in the domain model may generate solutions to complex and novel problems so
that students can always have new problems to work on, but it might only have simple methods for teaching those problems, while a system that concentrates on multiple or novel ways of teaching a particular topic might find a less sophisticated representation of that content sufficient.&lt;ref name = "Freedman"/&gt;

==Design and development methods==

Apart from the discrepancy amongst ITS architectures each emphasizing different elements, the development of an ITS is much the same as any [[instructional design]] process. Corbett et al. (1997) summarized ITS design and development as consisting of four iterative stages: (1) needs assessment, (2) cognitive task analysis, (3) initial tutor implementation and (4) evaluation.&lt;ref name = "Corbett et al"&gt;Corbett A. T., Koedinger, K. R., &amp; Anderson, J. R. (1997). Intelligent tutoring systems. In M. G. Helander, T. K. Landauer, &amp; P. V. Prabhu (Eds.), ''Handbook of human-computer interaction'' (pp. 849–874). Amsterdam: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stage known as needs assessment, is common to any instructional design process, especially software development.  This involves a ''learner analysis'', consultation with subject matter experts and/or the instructor(s). This first step is part of the development of the expert/knowledge and student domain. The goal is to specify learning goals and to outline a general plan for the curriculum; it is imperative not to computerize traditional concepts but develop a new curriculum structure by defining the task in general and understanding learners' possible behaviours dealing with the task and to a lesser degree the tutor's behavior. In doing so, three crucial dimensions need to be dealt with: (1) the probability a student is able to solve problems; (2) the time it takes to reach this performance level and (3) the probability the student will actively use this knowledge in the future. Another important aspect that requires analysis is cost effectiveness of the interface. Moreover, teachers and student entry characteristics such as prior knowledge must be assessed since both groups are going to be system users.&lt;ref name = "Corbett et al"/&gt;

The second stage, cognitive task analysis, is a detailed approach to expert systems programming with the goal of developing a valid computational model of the required problem solving knowledge. Chief methods for developing a domain model include: (1) interviewing domain experts, (2) conducting "think aloud" protocol studies with domain experts, (3) conducting "think aloud" studies with novices and (4) observation of teaching and learning behavior. Although the first method is most commonly used, experts are usually incapable of reporting cognitive components. The "think aloud" methods, in which the experts is asked to report aloud what s/he is thinking when solving typical problems, can avoid this problem.&lt;ref name = "Corbett et al"/&gt; Observation of actual online interactions between tutors and students provides information related to the processes used in problem-solving, which is useful for building dialogue or interactivity into tutoring systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shah|first=Farhana|author2=Martha Evens |author3=Joel Michael |author4=Allen Rovick |title=Classifying Student Initiatives and Tutor Responses in Human Keyboard-to-Keyboard Tutoring Sessions|journal=Discourse Processes|year=2002|volume=33|issue=1|pages=23–52 |doi=10.1207/s15326950dp3301_02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third stage, initial tutor implementation, involves setting up a problem solving environment to enable and support an authentic learning process. This stage is followed by a series of evaluation activities as the final stage which is again similar to any software development project.&lt;ref name = "Corbett et al"/&gt;

The fourth stage, evaluation includes (1) pilot studies to confirm basic usability and educational impact; (2) formative evaluations of the system under development, including (3) parametric studies that examine the effectiveness of system features and finally, (4) summative evaluations of the final tutor's effect: learning rate and asymptotic achievement levels.&lt;ref name = "Corbett et al"/&gt;

'''Eight principles of ITS design and development'''

Anderson et al. (1987)&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J., Boyle, C., Farrell, R., &amp; Reiser, B. (1987). Cognitive principles in the design of computer tutors. In P. Morris (Ed.), ''Modeling cognition''. NY: John Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; outlined eight principles for intelligent tutor design and Corbett et al. (1997)&lt;ref name = "Corbett et al"/&gt; later elaborated on those principles highlighting an all-embracing principle which they believed governed intelligent tutor design, they referred to this principle as:

Principle 0: An intelligent tutor system should enable the student to work to the successful conclusion of problem solving.
# Represent student competence as a production set.
# Communicate the goal structure underlying the problem solving.
# Provide instruction in the problem solving context.
# Promote an abstract understanding of the problem-solving knowledge.
#Minimize working memory load.
#Provide immediate feedback on errors.
#Adjust the grain size of instruction with learning.
#Facilitate successive approximations to the target skill.&lt;ref name = "Corbett et al"/&gt;

==Use in practice==

All this is a substantial amount of work, even if [[authoring tool]]s have become available to ease the task.&lt;ref&gt;For an example of an ITS authoring tool, see [http://ctat.pact.cs.cmu.edu/ Cognitive Tutoring Authoring Tools]&lt;/ref&gt; This means that building an ITS is an option only in situations in which they, in spite of their relatively high development costs, still reduce the overall costs through reducing the need for human instructors or sufficiently boosting overall productivity. Such situations occur when large groups need to be tutored simultaneously or many replicated tutoring efforts are needed. Cases in point are technical training situations such as training of military recruits and high school mathematics. One specific type of intelligent tutoring system, the [[cognitive tutor|Cognitive Tutor]], has been incorporated into mathematics curricula in a substantial number of United States high schools, producing improved student learning outcomes on final exams and standardized tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = K. R. | last = Koedinger | author-link = Kenneth Koedinger  | first2 = A. | last2 = Corbett  | editor-last = Sawyer | editor-first = K.  | contribution = Cognitive Tutors: Technology bringing learning science to the classroom  | contribution-url =  | title = The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences  | year = 2006  | pages = 61–78  | publisher = Cambridge University Press | oclc= 62728545 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intelligent tutoring systems have been constructed to help students learn geography, circuits, medical diagnosis, computer programming, mathematics, physics, genetics, chemistry, etc. Intelligent Language Tutoring Systems (ILTS), e.g. this&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shaalan |first=Khalid F. |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all?content=10.1080/09588220500132399 |title=An Intelligent Computer Assisted Language Learning System for Arabic Learners |journal=Computer Assisted Language Learning: An International Journal |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group Ltd. |volume=18 |issue=1 &amp; 2 |pages=81–108 |date=February 2005 |doi=10.1080/09588220500132399}}&lt;/ref&gt; one, teach natural language to first or second language learners. ILTS requires specialized natural language processing tools such as large dictionaries and morphological and grammatical analyzers with acceptable coverage.

==Applications==

During the rapid expansion of the web boom, new computer-aided instruction paradigms, such as [[e-learning]] and distributed learning, provided an excellent platform for ITS ideas. Areas that have used ITS include [[natural language processing]], [[machine learning]], planning, [[multi-agent systems]], [[ontologies]], [[semantic Web]], and social and emotional computing. In addition, other technologies such as  multimedia, [[object-oriented operating system|object-oriented systems]], modeling, simulation, and statistics have also been connected to or combined with ITS. Historically non-technological areas such as the educational sciences and psychology have also been influenced by the success of ITS.&lt;ref&gt;Ramos, C., Ramos, C., Frasson, C., &amp; Ramachandran, S. (2009). Introduction to the special issue on real world applications of intelligent tutoring systems. , 2(2) 62-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years{{when|date=July 2016}}, ITS has begun to move away from the search-based to include a range of practical applications.&lt;ref&gt;https://trac.v2.nl/export/.../Intelligent%20Tutoring%20Systems.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; ITS have expanded across many critical and complex cognitive domains, and the results have been far reaching. ITS systems have cemented a place within formal education and these systems have found homes in the sphere of corporate training and organizational learning. ITS offers learners several affordances such as individualized learning, just in time feedback, and flexibility in time and space.

While Intelligent tutoring systems evolved from research in cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence, there are now many applications found in education and in organizations. Intelligent tutoring systems can be found in online environments or in a traditional classroom computer lab, and are used in K-12 classrooms as well as in universities. There are a number of programs that target mathematics but applications can be found in health sciences, language acquisition, and other areas of formalized learning.

Reports of improvement in student comprehension, engagement, attitude, motivation, and academic results have all contributed to the ongoing interest in the investment in and research of theses systems. The personalized nature of the intelligent tutoring systems affords educators the opportunity to create individualized programs. Within education there are a plethora of intelligent tutoring systems, an exhaustive list does not exist but several of the more influential programs are listed below.

Developed by the [[U.S. Army Research Laboratory]] from 2009 to 2011, GIFT was released for commercial use in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gifttutoring.org/projects/gift/wiki/Overview|title=Overview - GIFT - GIFT Portal|website=www.gifttutoring.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; GIFT is open-source and domain independent, and can be downloaded online for free. The software allows an instructor to design a tutoring program that can cover various disciplines through adjustments to existing courses. It includes coursework tools intended for use by researchers, instructional designers, instructors, and students.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinatra|first=Anne M.|last2=Goldberg|first2=Benjamin S.|last3=Sottilare|first3=Robert A.|date=2014-09-01|title=The Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT) as a Tool for Human Factors Professionals

'''''SHERLOCK'''''
"SHERLOCK"  is used to train Air Force technicians to diagnose problems in the electrical systems of F-15 jets.  The ITS creates faulty schematic diagrams of  systems for the trainee to locate and diagnose.  The ITS provides diagnostic readings allowing the trainee to decide whether the fault lies in the circuit being tested or if it lies elsewhere in the system.  Feedback and guidance are provided by the system and help is available if requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lajoie | first1 = S.

'''''Cardiac Tutor'''''
The Cardiac Tutor's aim is to support advanced cardiac support techniques to medical personnel.  The tutor presents cardiac problems and, using a variety of steps, students must select various interventions. Cardiac Tutor provides clues, verbal advice, and feedback in order to personalize and optimize the learning. Each simulation, regardless of whether the students were successfully able to help their patients, results in a detailed report which students then review.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, C., &amp; Woolf, B. (1994). Reasoning about the user within a simulation-based real-time training system. In Proceedings of the fourth international conference on user modeling , 121-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''CODES'''''
Cooperative Music Prototype Design is a Web-based environment for cooperative music prototyping. It was designed to support users, especially those who are not specialists in music, in creating musical pieces in a prototyping manner. The musical examples (prototypes) can be repeatedly tested, played and modified. One of the main aspects of CODES is interaction and cooperation between the music creators and their partners.&lt;ref&gt;MILETTO, E. M., PIMENTA, M. S., VICARI, R. M., &amp; FLORES, L. V. (2005).

==Effectiveness==

Assessing the effectiveness of ITS programs is problematic. ITS vary greatly in design, implementation, and educational focus. When ITS are used in a classroom, the system is not only used by students, but by teachers as well. This usage can create barriers to effective evaluation for a number of reasons; most notably due to teacher intervention in student learning.

Teachers often have the ability to enter new problems into the system or adjust the curriculum. In addition, teachers and peers often interact with students while they learn with ITSs (e.g., during an individual computer lab session or during classroom lectures falling in between lab sessions) in ways that may influence their learning with the software.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Prior work suggests that the vast majority of students' help-seeking behavior in classrooms using ITSs may occur entirely outside of the software - meaning that the nature and quality of peer and teacher feedback in a given class may be an important mediator of student learning in these contexts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, aspects of classroom climate, such as students' overall level of comfort in publicly asking for help,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or the degree to which a teacher is physically active in monitoring individual students&lt;ref&gt;Holstein, K., McLaren, B. M., &amp; Aleven, V. (2017, March). SPACLE: investigating learning across virtual and physical spaces using spatial replays. In ''Proceedings of the Seventh International Learning Analytics &amp; Knowledge Conference'' (pp. 358-367). ACM.&lt;/ref&gt; may add additional sources of variation across evaluation contexts. All of these variables make evaluation of an ITS complex,&lt;ref&gt;Intelligent Tutoring Systems, Chapter 37 / Corbett, Koedinger &amp; Anderson / Chapter 37 (Original pp 849-874) 14  retrieved May 21, 2012 from http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/papers/173/Chapter_37_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and may help explain variation in results across evaluation studies.&lt;ref&gt;Karam, R., Pane, J.

''Educational Technology Research and Development'', 1-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the inherent complexities, numerous studies have attempted to measure the overall effectiveness of ITS, often by comparisons of ITS to human tutors.&lt;ref name="Anderson et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=J.R.|author2=Corbett, A. T. |author3=Koedinger, K.

Studies of the Algebra Cognitive Tutor found that the ITS students outperformed students taught by a classroom teacher on standardized test problems and real-world problem solving tasks.&lt;ref name="Koedinger et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koedinger|first=K. R.|author2=Anderson, J. R. |author3=Hadley, W. H. |author4=Mark, M. A. |title=Intelligent tutoring goes to school in the big city|journal=International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education|year=1997|volume=8|pages=30–43}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent studies found that these results were particularly pronounced in students from special education, non-native English, and low-income backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Plano&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plano|first=G. S.|title=The Effects of the Cognitive Tutor Algebra on student attitudes and achievement in a 9th grade Algebra course|journal=Unpublished doctoral dissertation, Seton Hall University, South Orange, NJ.|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent meta-analysis suggests that ITSs can exceed the effectiveness of both CAI and human tutors, especially when measured by local (specific) tests as opposed to standardized tests.  "Students who received intelligent tutoring outperformed students from conventional classes in 46 (or 92%) of the 50 controlled evaluations, and the improvement in performance was great enough to be considered of substantive importance in 39 (or 78%) of the 50 studies. The median ES in the 50 studies was 0.66, which is considered a moderate-to-large effect for studies in the social sciences. It is roughly equivalent to an improvement in test performance from the 50th to the 75th percentile. This is stronger than typical effects from other forms of tutoring. C.-L. C. Kulik and Kulik’s (1991) meta-analysis, for example, found an average ES of 0.31 in 165 studies of CAI tutoring. ITS gains are about twice as high. The ITS effect is also greater than typical effects from human tutoring. As we have seen, programs of human tutoring typically raise student test scores about 0.4 standard deviations over control levels. Developers of ITSs long ago set out to improve on the success of CAI tutoring and to match the success of human tutoring. Our results suggest that ITS developers have already met both of these goals.... Although effects were moderate to strong in evaluations that measured outcomes on locally developed tests, they were much smaller in evaluations that measured outcomes on standardized tests. Average ES on studies with local tests was 0.73; average ES on studies with standardized tests was 0.13. This discrepancy is not unusual for meta-analyses that include both local and standardized tests... local tests are likely to align well with the objectives of specific instructional programs. Off-the-shelf standardized tests provide a looser fit. ... Our own belief is that both local and standardized tests provide important information about instructional effectiveness, and when possible, both types of tests should be included in evaluation studies."&lt;ref name="Kulik and Fletcher 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kulik|first=James A.|author2=Fletcher, J.D.|title=Effectiveness of Intelligent Tutoring Systems: A Meta-Analytic Review|journal=Review of Educational Research|year=2016|volume=86|pages=42–78|doi=10.3102/0034654315581420|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/277636218_Effectiveness_of_Intelligent_Tutoring_Systems_A_Meta-Analytic_Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recognized strengths of ITS are their ability to provide immediate yes/no feedback, individual task selection, on-demand hints, and support mastery learning.&lt;ref name = "VanLehn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Koedinger &amp; Vincent"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koedinger|first=Kenneth|author2=Alven, Vincent|title=Exploring the Assistance Dilemma in Experiments with Cognitive Tutors|journal=Educ Psychol Rev|year=2007|volume=19|pages=239–264|doi=10.1007/s10648-007-9049-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

Intelligent tutoring systems are expensive both to develop and implement. The research phase paves the way for the development of systems that are commercially viable. However, the research phase is often expensive; it requires the cooperation and input of subject matter experts, the cooperation and support of individuals across both organizations and organizational levels. Another limitation in the development phase is the conceptualization and the development of software within both budget and time constraints. There are also factors that limit the incorporation of intelligent tutors into the real world, including the long timeframe required for development and the high cost of the creation of the system components. A high portion of that cost is a result of content component building.&lt;ref name=Nkambou /&gt; For instance, surveys revealed that encoding an hour of online instruction time took 300 hours of development time for touring content.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, T. (1999). Authoring intelligent tutoring systems: An analysis of the state of the art. International Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education (IJAIED), 10, 98–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, building the Cognitive Tutor took a ratio of development time to instruction time of at least 200:1 hours.&lt;ref name="Anderson et al" /&gt; The high cost of development often eclipses replicating the efforts for real world application.&lt;ref name="Polson et al" /&gt;
Intelligent tutoring systems are not, in general, commercially feasible for real-world applications.&lt;ref name="Polson et al" /&gt;

A criticism of Intelligent Tutoring Systems currently in use, is the pedagogy of immediate feedback and hint sequences that are built in to make the system "intelligent". This pedagogy is criticized for its failure to develop deep learning in students. When students are given control over the ability to receive hints, the learning response created is negative. Some students immediately turn to the hints before attempting to solve the problem or complete the task. When it is possible to do so, some students bottom out the hints&amp;nbsp;– receiving as many hints as possible as fast as possible&amp;nbsp;– in order to complete the task faster. If students fail to reflect on the tutoring system's feedback or hints,  and instead increase guessing until positive feedback is garnered, the student is, in effect, learning to do the right thing for the wrong reasons. Most tutoring systems are currently unable to detect shallow learning, or to distinguish between productive versus unproductive struggle (though see, e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;Baker, R., Gowda, S., Corbett, A., &amp; Ocumpaugh, J. (2012). Towards automatically detecting whether student learning is shallow. In ''Intelligent Tutoring Systems'' (pp. 444-453). Springer Berlin/Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Käser, T., Klingler, S., &amp; Gross, M. (2016, April). When to stop?: towards universal instructional policies. In ''Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Learning Analytics &amp; Knowledge'' (pp. 289-298). ACM.&lt;/ref&gt;). For these and many other reasons (e.g., overfitting of underlying models to particular user populations&lt;ref&gt;Ocumpaugh, J., Baker, R., Gowda, S., Heffernan, N., &amp; Heffernan, C. (2014). Population validity for Educational Data Mining models: A case study in affect detection. ''British Journal of Educational Technology'', ''45''(3), 487-501.&lt;/ref&gt;), the effectiveness of these systems may differ significantly across users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koedinger|first=K.|author2=Aleven, V.|title=Exploring the assistance dilemma in experiments with cognitive tutors|journal=[[Educational Psychology Review]]|year=2007|volume=19|pages=239–264|doi=10.1007/s10648-007-9049-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of intelligent tutoring systems is the failure of the system to ask questions of the students to explain their actions. If the student is not learning the domain language than it becomes more difficult to gain a deeper understanding, to work collaboratively in groups, and to transfer the domain language to writing. For example, if the student is not "talking science" than it is argued that they are not being immersed in the culture of science, making it difficult to undertake scientific writing or participate in collaborative team efforts.  Intelligent tutoring systems have been criticized for being too "instructivist" and removing intrinsic motivation, social learning contexts, and context realism from learning.&lt;ref&gt;Jonassen, D. H., &amp; Reeves, T. C. (1996). Learning with technology: Using computers as cognitive tools.  In D. H. Jonassen (Ed.), Handbook of research on educational communications and technology (pp. 693 - 719). New York: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Practical concerns, in terms of the inclination of the sponsors/authorities and the users to adapt intelligent tutoring systems, should be taken into account.&lt;ref name="Polson et al"&gt;Polson, Martha C.; Richardson, J. Jeffrey, eds. (1988). Foundations of Intelligent Tutoring Systems. Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; First, someone must have a willingness to implement the ITS.&lt;ref name="Polson et al" /&gt; Additionally an authority must recognize the necessity to integrate an intelligent tutoring software into current curriculum and finally, the sponsor or authority must offer the needed support through the stages of the system development until it is completed and implemented.&lt;ref name="Polson et al" /&gt;

Evaluation of an intelligent tutoring system is an important phase; however, it is often difficult, costly, and time consuming.&lt;ref name="Polson et al" /&gt; Even though there are various evaluation techniques presented in the literature, there are no guiding principles for the selection of appropriate evaluation method(s) to be used in a particular context.&lt;ref name="Iqbal et al"&gt;Iqbal, A., Oppermann, R., Patel, A. &amp; Kinshuk (1999). A Classification of Evaluation Methods for Intelligent Tutoring Systems. In U. Arend, E. Eberleh &amp; K. Pitschke (Eds.) Software Ergonomie '99 - Design von Informationswelten, Leipzig: B. G. Teubner Stuttgart, 169-181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Siemer"&gt;Siemer, J., &amp; Angelides, M. C. (1998). A comprehensive method for the evaluation of complete intelligent tutoring systems. Decision support systems, 22(1), 85–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Careful inspection should be undertaken to ensure that a complex system does what it claims to do. This assessment may occur during the design and early development of the system to identify problems and to guide modifications (i.e. formative evaluation).&lt;ref name="Mark &amp; Greer"&gt;Mark, M. A., Greer, J. E.. (1993). Evaluation methodologies for intelligent tutoring systems. Journal of Artificial Intelligence in Education, 4, 129–129.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the evaluation may occur after the completion of the system to support formal claims about the construction, behaviour of, or outcomes associated with a completed system (i.e. summative evaluation).&lt;ref name="Mark &amp; Greer" /&gt; The great challenge introduced by the lack of evaluation standards resulted in neglecting the evaluation stage in several existing ITS'.&lt;ref name="Iqbal et al" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Siemer /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark &amp; Greer" /&gt;

==Improvements==
Intelligent tutoring systems are less capable than human tutors in the areas of dialogue and feedback. For example, human tutors are able to interpret the affective state of the student, and potentially adapt instruction in response to these perceptions. Recent work is exploring potential strategies for overcoming these limitations of ITSs, to make them more effective.

'''Dialogue'''

Human tutors have the ability to understand a person's tone and inflection within a dialogue and interpret this to provide continual feedback through an ongoing dialogue. Intelligent tutoring systems are now being developed to attempt to simulate natural conversations.  To get the full experience of dialogue there are many different areas in which a computer must be programmed; including being able to understand tone, inflection, body language, and facial expression and then to respond to these. Dialogue in an ITS can be used to ask specific questions to help guide students and elicit information while allowing students to construct their own knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Graessner A. C., Kurt VanLehn, C. P R., Jordan, P. &amp; Harter, D. (2001). Intelligent tutoring systems with conversational dialogue. AI Magazine, 22(4), 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of more sophisticated dialogue within an ITS has been a focus in some current research partially to address the limitations and create a more constructivist approach to ITS.&lt;ref&gt;Graesser, A. C., Chipman, P., Haynes, B. C., &amp; Olney, A. (2005). AutoTutor: An intelligent tutoring system with mixed-initiative dialogue. , 48(4) 612-618.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some current research has focused on modeling the nature and effects of various social cues commonly employed within a dialogue by human tutors and tutees, in order to build trust and rapport (which have been shown to have positive impacts on student learning).&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, R., Papangelis, A., &amp; Cassell, J. (2014, August). Towards a dyadic computational model of rapport management for human-virtual agent interaction. In ''International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents'' (pp. 514-527). Springer International Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Madaio, M. A., Ogan, A., &amp; Cassell, J. (2016, June). The Effect of Friendship and Tutoring Roles on Reciprocal Peer Tutoring Strategies. In ''International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems'' (pp. 423-429). Springer International Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emotional affect'''

A growing body of work is considering the role of [[affect (psychology)|affect]] on learning, with the objective of developing intelligent tutoring systems  that can interpret and adapt to the different emotional states.&lt;ref name="D'Mello et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=D'Mello|first=C.|author2=Graessner, A.|title=Dynamics of affective states during complex learning|journal=Learning and Instruction|year=2012|volume=22|issue=2|pages=145–157|doi=10.1016/j.learninstruc.2011.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sarrafzadeh"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sarrafzadeh | first1 = A. | last2 = Alexander | first2 = S. | last3 = Dadgostar | first3 = F. | last4 = Fan | first4 = C. | last5 = Bigdeli | first5 = A. | year = 2008 | title = How do you know that I don't understand?" A look at the future of intelligent tutoring systems | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 1342–1363 | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2007.07.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans do not just use cognitive processes in learning but the affective processes they go through also plays an important role. For example, learners learn better when they have a certain level of disequilibrium (frustration), but not enough to make the learner feel completely overwhelmed.&lt;ref name="D'Mello et al" /&gt; This has motivated affective computing to begin to produce and research creating intelligent tutoring systems that can interpret the affective process of an individual.&lt;ref name="D'Mello et al" /&gt;  An ITS can be developed to read an individual's expressions and other signs of affect in an attempt to find and tutor to the optimal affective state for learning. There are many complications in doing this since affect is not expressed in just one way but in multiple ways so that for an ITS to be effective in interpreting affective states it may require a multimodal approach (tone, facial expression, etc...).&lt;ref name="D'Mello et al" /&gt; These ideas have created a new field within ITS, that of Affective Tutoring Systems (ATS).&lt;ref name ="Sarrafzadeh" /&gt; One example of an ITS that addresses affect is Gaze Tutor which was developed to track students eye movements and determine whether they are bored or distracted and then the system attempts to reengage the student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = D'Mello | first1 = S. | last2 = Olney | first2 = A. | last3 = Williams | first3 = C. | last4 = Hays | first4 = P. | year = 2012 | title = Gaze tutor: A gaze-reactive intelligent tutoring system | url = | journal = International Journal of Human - Computer Studies | volume = 70 | issue = 5| pages = 377–398 | doi=10.1016/j.ijhcs.2012.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Wittgenstein Symposium''' is an international conference dedicated to the work of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and its relationship to [[analytic philosophy|philosophy]] and [[philosophy of science|science]]. It is sponsored by the [[Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society]].&lt;ref name="Graz"&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Graz, Department of Philosophy|url=http://philosophie-gewi.uni-graz.at/en/researching/philosophical-societies/oesterreichische-ludwig-wittgenstein-gesellschaft/|publisher=University of Graz|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224042/http://philosophie-gewi.uni-graz.at/en/researching/philosophical-societies/oesterreichische-ludwig-wittgenstein-gesellschaft/|archivedate=2016-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lud"&gt;{{cite web|title=Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society|url=http://www.alws.at/index.php/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wittgenstein News|url=http://wittgenstein-news.org/events}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1976, the International Wittgenstein Symposium was founded by [[Elisabeth Leinfellner]], [[Werner Leinfellner]], Rudolf Haller, Paul Weingartner, and Adolf Hübner in [[Kirchberg am Wechsel]], [[Lower Austria]]. The location was chosen because in the 1920s, Ludwig Wittgenstein taught at elementary schools in the area surrounding Kirchberg am Wechsel. On the 24th to the 25th of April, 1976 (just prior to the 25th anniversary of Wittgenstein's death), the first conference took place. Only four of the five founders gave talks on his philosophical work at the first meeting, but at the second, 120 speakers attended from around the world.&lt;ref name="Lud"/&gt;

==Philosophical topics==

The general topic of each symposium centers around the philosophy and philosophy of science of Wittgenstein, but the specific topics change from year to year.  For example, the topic of the second International Wittgenstein Symposium was "Wittgenstein and his impact on contemporary thought" and the topic of the third symposium was "Wittgenstein, the [[Vienna Circle]], and [[critical rationalism]] (including a seminar on [[Karl Popper|Popper's]] ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies|open society]]'')." A survey of topics is available from the [http://www.alws.at/index.php/review/show/iws_a_survey_of_topics_19762003/ site of the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society].&lt;ref name="Lud"/&gt;

==Proceedings==

Starting with the second symposium, the papers accepted for presentation have been published in edited proceedings.  From 1978 to 2005 the proceedings of the International Wittgenstein Symposium were published by Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky and are now published by ontos verlag. The proceedings published at ontos verlag are available Open Access online at a [http://wab.uib.no/agora-ontos site prepared by the Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen]. The Wittgenstein Archives have also prepared a site that contains an [http://wab.uib.no/agora-alws Open Access selection of symposium papers from the period 2001-10].&lt;ref name="Lud"/&gt;

==Sponsorship==

The symposia are sponsored by the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society and they are largely funded by the government of [[Lower Austria]] and the Austrian Federal Ministry for Science and Research.&lt;ref name="Lud"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2556">'''John William Grout''' (July 25, 1843 – October 21, 1861) was an [[American Civil War]] soldier from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], whose death inspired the poem "The Vacant Chair".  

==Life and death==  
The son of Jonathan and Mary Jane Grout, John William Grout was born July 25, 1843, at Worcester, Massachusetts.  He was a graduate of [[Phillips Academy, Andover]] in 1859. 

He served as a 2nd lieutenant of Company D, [[15th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry|15th Massachusetts Infantry]] and was killed at age eighteen at the [[Battle of Ball's Bluff|Battle of Ball’s Bluff]]. Lt. Grout's body was recovered on November 5, 1861, after being washed 35 miles back to [[Washington, D.C.]] His remains were identified by the name written on his clothing.

==Poem==
His death inspired a famous poem that was later turned into a Civil War song. The poem ("The Vacant Chair") is an allegory that describes the pain suffered by the family of those killed in war when sitting at the [[Thanksgiving]] table. The poem was written by [[Henry S. Washburn]] and was turned into song by [[George F. Root]]. Root wrote "[[The Battle Cry of Freedom]]", "[[Tramp! Tramp! Tramp!]]" and other songs of the Civil War. "The Vacant Chair" was a hit in both the North and the South.

'''Kathryn Merteuil''' is a fictional character who appears in ''[[Cruel Intentions]]'' and ''[[Cruel Intentions 2]]'', portrayed by actresses [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] and [[Amy Adams]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/03.11.99/gifs/cruelintentions-9910.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the Marquise Isabelle de Merteuil in [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]]'s ''[[Les Liaisons dangereuses]]'', Kathryn serves as the primary [[antagonist]] of the series.

==Storylines==

===''Cruel Intentions''===
In the film, Kathryn is wealthy, beautiful and popular, She is part of the [[Upper East Side]]'s social elite. Portrayed as a manipulative mastermind who uses and destroys people for her own amusement, she is also depicted as being addicted to [[cocaine]], which she hides in her [[rosary]], and may even suffer from [[Bulimia]], as her ex-boyfriend Court states she's a "Bulimic Headcase" and Sebastian's private journal also states she's bulimic. She hides her true nature behind the facade of a deeply religious model student, fooling everyone she knows, except for her equally narcissistic [[step-brother]] Sebastian Valmont and Court Reynolds. Kathryn shows signs of sociopathic and narcissistic traits, treating the death of her supposedly "loved" brother with cold disdain (who exposed her, posthumously, via his journal, a book that Cecile and Annette distributed), and gleefully enjoying destroying his life, as well as those of the people she perceives as threats or inferior to her. She has a strong superiority complex, but the extent of her interest in Sebastian is left ambiguous (she does cry when Sebastian's journal is made public, but whether this is because she finally saw how much Sebastian actually loathed/loved her, or if it is because people finally see her conniving, troubled mind, is left unanswered). Kathryn is the archetypal cold, ice princess whose opulent bedroom is a cold, dark lair decorated in royal blue and silver with crystal embellishments. When she's not wearing black, gray or other dark, muted colors, she occasionally wears icy blue.

In the film, she's first seen discussing her prep school with Mrs. Caldwell and her daughter, Cecile. Kathryn promises Mrs. Caldwell that she will look out for the sheltered and naive Cecile. However, she reveals to her [[step-brother]] Sebastian that her real intention is to use Cecile to take revenge on Court Reynolds, her ex-boyfriend, who had dumped her for Cecile. Kathryn asks Sebastian to seduce Cecile; yet he refuses as he is planning to seduce virgin Annette Hargrove, the daughter of their school's new headmaster.  The two make a wager: Kathryn believes he cannot get Annette to bed, yet Sebastian believes he can. If Kathryn wins, she gets Sebastian's vintage [[Jaguar XK140]]; if Sebastian wins, Kathryn will have sex with him.

After numerous failed attempts of seducing Annette, Sebastian agrees to seduce Cecile. Cecile confesses to Kathryn that her music teacher, Ronald Clifford is in love with her. Afterwards Kathryn secretly tells Mrs. Caldwell about Ronald and Cecile's romance and Mrs. Caldwell intervenes in their relationship. Sebastian, in turn, calls Cecile to his house, ostensibly to give her a letter from Ronald. There, he blackmails Cecile and performs [[oral sex]] on her. The next day, Cecile confides in Kathryn, who advises her to learn from Sebastian so that she can make Ronald happy in bed.

After Sebastian sleeps with Annette, Kathryn offers herself to Sebastian as he has won the bet, but he refuses; he now only wants Annette. Kathryn begins showing signs of possessiveness towards Sebastian, and it is suggested that she is in truly in love with him.&lt;ref name=cins&gt;{{cite web|title=Cruel Intentions Script|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/c/cruel-intentions-script-transcript-gellar.html|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Kathryn taunts him and threatens to ruin Annette's reputation, so Sebastian pretends indifference to Annette and coldly breaks up with her. After Sebastian tells Kathryn that he has broken up with Annette and arranged for Cecile and Ronald to be together, Kathryn reveals that she has known all along that he was truly in love with Annette and manipulated him into giving her up. Kathryn knowing he came to make plans for them to have sex, rejects him. Once he leaves Kathryn calls Ronald to tell him that Sebastian slept with Cecile and (falsely) inform him that Sebastian hit her. This false information leads to Ronald attacking Sebastian and engineers his death. Only when he watches Sebastian and Annette profess their love before his death, Ronald realizes that Kathryn lied to him in order to get him to kill Sebastian and feels guilty for his actions. At Sebastian's funeral, Cecile distributes copies of Sebastian's private journal, made into a book by Annette, titled "Cruel Intentions". Kathryn is humiliated and rejected by her former friends, and her spotless reputation is ruined when the drugs hidden in her rosary are discovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=KrystelClaire|title=Cruel Intentions (1999): Synopsis|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139134/synopsis|work=IMDB|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Cruel Intentions 2''===
The [[straight-to-video]] prequel to the original film centers around a younger Kathryn. In the prequel film it is revealed Kathryn was born to Manhattan's Tiffany Merteuil a well-respected New York socialite. However, the prequel features several inconsistencies in its relation to the first film, such as the backstory concerning Kathryn's mother and Kathryn's overly outward meanspirited behavior, but this is due to the film originally being written as a TV series retelling rather than a prequel. She attends Manchester Prep, a prestigious co-educational private school on just outside of the city. As in the first film, she manipulates and controls everyone around her, even seducing her school's headmaster, and then blackmailing him into letting her do whatever she wants. Soon her new [[Step-brother]] Sebastian Valmont and his father move in, and after their first meeting, Kathryn becomes quickly jealous of Sebastian as he out skills her in both piano and vocabulary.

The next day, at a school assembly, Kathryn, who is the student body president, delivers a speech to her classmates, but is interrupted by uncontrollable hiccups coming from a student, who then begins to choke on the gum that she was chewing in a bid to stop her hiccups. She is saved by the quick action of Another fellow student who performs the [[Heimlich maneuver]], allowing the student to expel the gum, which ends up flying into Kathryn's hair. Afterwards Kathryn calls a meeting  For the [[secret society]] of student elites, deciding upon the fate of the new students. This leads them to Cherie, the student with the hiccups, as well as the discovery that Cherie's family is wealthier than that of Kathryn; this, and the events of the assembly, cause Kathryn to seek a vendetta against Cherie.

The next night, Kathryn calls Cherie, asking if she'd like to attend a school event with her. Revealing to Sebastian that she plans to ruin Cherie's reputation. She takes Cherie to a popular nightclub, and tricks her into drinking several [[Long Island Ice Tea]]s. After getting the attention of a male club goer, Kathryn tells Cherie he clearly likes her and that she has to "fuck him". Yet her plan fails once Cherie throws up on the young man's feet. After Sebastian angers Kathryn, whose day is interrupted by not being able to contact her driver, She conducts a plan to make him similar to her, and begins thinking on how she can mold Sebastian into a heartless womanizer. She starts by interfering with Sebastian's attempts to woo the fellow student Danielle. Kathryn first tries to tempt him away from Danielle by luring him with identical twins, who confide to Sebastian that Danielle is the only virgin at Manchester and she plans not to have sex with anyone unless she's truly in love.

Kathryn continues her attempt to sabotage Cherie, however it backfires, as Kathryn's mother tells her to become best friends with Cherie, in an attempt to encourage Cherie's mother to donate a large amount of money to the school.  Sebastian soon professes his love for Danielle, only to find that she does not reciprocate. It turns out that Danielle is actually secretly working alongside Kathryn and is helping fulfill her secret plan to dupe Sebastian and make him heartless. Defeated by Kathryn's manipulation, a heartbroken Sebastian states he no longer has any attentions to ever fall in love again, afterwards he makes an alliance with Kathryn to dominate and manipulate others. She then tells Sebastian he should start with Cherie.

===''Cruel Intentions 3''===
While Kathryn herself does not appear in the third film in the franchise, the main character in this film - Kathryn's equally manipulative cousin Cassidy Merteuil - reveals that she is currently a patient in a [[methadone]] clinic.

==Characterization==
Kathleen Sweeney sees Merteuil as one of "Hollywood's Bad Girls", a [[stock character]] that Sweeney regards as appearing first in Veronica Sawyer in the 1988 film ''[[Heathers]]''. Sweeney suggests that 1999 "gave viewers two manipulative dark-haired [[Queen bee (sociology)|Queen Bees]]": Kathryn Merteuil in ''Cruel Intentions'' and Courtney Alice Shayne in ''[[Jawbreaker (film)|Jawbreaker]]''. Sweeney notes that in both films, "the Queens of Mean are punished by their peers, but not before laying out the game plan for wielding power in high school as visual "how-to" manuals for aspiring Queen Bees everywhere." Merteuil, Sweeney suggests, "maintains a Straight-A Uber Girl persona of innocence until the very end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sweeney|first1=Kathleen|title=Maiden USA: Girl Icons Come of Age|date=2008|publisher=[[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]]|page=113|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=qlYpFAi1QsMC&amp;pg=PA113|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samantha Lindop classifies Merteuil as a ''fille fatale'' (a young ''[[femme fatale]]'') and compares her to Adrian Forrester in ''[[The Crush (1993 film)|The Crush]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lindop|first1=Samantha|title=Postfeminism and the Fatale Figure in Neo-Noir Cinema|date=2015|publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]|page=102|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lF5OCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Burt suggests that Merteuil is "punished for being beautiful and smart" in that she "can't keep guys from dumping her for stupider girls." Burt goes on to note that Merteuil is a "[[Bitch (insult)|bitch]]" who is "incapable of love" and "ultimately humiliated for her destructive nastiness."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burt|first1=Richard|chapter=Teen Things I Hate about Girlene Shakesploitation Flicks in the Late 1990s or Not-So-Fast Times at Shakespeare High|title=Spectacular Shakespeare: Critical Theory and Popular Cinema|date=2002|publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press]]|page=224|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=HyoVSxSgZoAC&amp;pg=PA224|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gellar's portrayal of Merteuil was parodied in the 2001 film ''[[Not Another Teen Movie]]'', in which [[Mia Kirshner]] played Catherine Wyler, "The Cruelest Girl in School".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10286">'''La Cebra Danza Gay''' is a dance troupe founded in 1996 by [[José Rivera Moya]] in [[Mexico City]]. It is the first in Mexico to focus nearly exclusively on gay community and the issues it faces. The groups as a repertoire of over ten major works including ''Danza del mal amor o mejor me voy'', which has been performed over 100 times. La Cebra has appeared in various locations in [[Mexico]] and has had appearances in the United States and [[France]].
==José Rivera Moya==
The dance troupe was founded by José Rivera Moya from [[San Luis Potosí]].&lt;ref name="arrancan"&gt; {{cite news |title= Arrancan temporada este miércoles "La Cebra Danza Gay" y "Virulo"|agency=Notimex |location=Mexico City |date=July 6, 2010 |language=Spanish |trans-title=La Cebra Danza Gay and Virulo begin their season this Wednesday }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mozart"&gt; {{cite news |title= Baila a Mozart danza gay |author=Julieta Riveroll |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=February 18, 2005 |page=3 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Danza Gay dances Mozart}} &lt;/ref&gt; When Rivera arrived to Mexico City in 1987, there were no gay bars and police action against homosexuals was common.&lt;ref name="enkidu"&gt; {{cite journal |last=Romero |first=Guillermo |date=November 12, 2005 |title=La Cebra Danza Gay |journal=Enkidu magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |url= http://enkidumagazine.com/art/2005/221105/E_066_221105.htm }} &lt;/ref&gt; In the capital, Rivera became a dancer with the [[Ballet Independiente]] under director [[Raúl Flores Canelo]], who would remain an influence on Rivera’s work since.&lt;ref name="festeja"&gt; {{cite news |title= Festeja La Cebra Danza Gay una década de denuncia creativa |author=Fabiola Palapa Quijas |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2006/06/19/index.php?section=cultura&amp;article=a16n1cul |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=June 19, 2006 |accessdate=September 21, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=La Cebra Danza Gay celebrates a decade of creative denunciation }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="culturaunam"&gt; {{cite web |url= http://www.cultura.unam.mx/index.html?tp=articulo&amp;id=1327&amp;ac=mostrar&amp;Itemid=103&amp;ct=0 |title= a Cebra Danza Gay, entre libros y rosas |date=March 31, 2010 |work=Cultura UNAM |publisher=UNAM |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=To Cebra Danza Gay, among books and roses |accessdate=September 22, 2011 }} &lt;/ref&gt; While a dancer with this Ballet, Rivera produced his first work with a homoerotic theme called ''Danza del mal amor o mejor me voy'', first presented in 1990, winning the Concurso Interno de Coreografías of that year.&lt;ref name="enkidu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="festeja"/&gt; In 1996, Rivera founded La Cebra in Mexico City to focus nearly exclusively on gay themes, becoming his life’s work.&lt;ref name="enkidu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mozart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="llega"&gt; {{cite news |title= Llega la compañía La Cebra Danza Gay a Tijuana para ofrecer lo suyo.

Rivera readily admits he is not the first choreographer in Mexico to create gay-themed pieces, giving credit to his mentor Flores Canelo as well as to [[Marco Antonio Silva]] and [[Miguel Mancillas]]. However, he founded La Cebra as the first to focus on gay themes, with much of the works presented by the group based on Rivera’s own life as a gay male growing up in Mexican society.&lt;ref name="festeja"/&gt;The director considers himself a “narrative choreographer” and says that his works say what many young gays “want to scream.”&lt;ref name="festeja"/&gt; Today, Rivera remains artistic director of the Ballet Independiente and has become a member of the [[Mexican Society of Choreographers]] (Sociedad Mexicana de Coreógrafos).&lt;ref name="leonmil"&gt; {{cite news |title= Cebra Danza Gay se presentará en FIC |author=Alfonso Machuca |url= http://leon.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/b7ee2d743f396305d89c9a2a02c6e383 |newspaper=Milenio León |location=León, Guanajuato |date=July 20, 2011 |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Cebra Danza Gay will present at the Festival International Cervantino }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enkidu"/&gt;
==History and make up of La Cebra==
La Cebra Danza Gay was established in 1996 specifically to focus on gay issues, including erotic themes.&lt;ref name="enkidu"/&gt; Rivera’s 1990s work, ''Danza del mal amor o mejor me voy'', moved from the Ballet Independiente to become one of the main elements of the new organization’s repertoire.&lt;ref name="enkidu"/&gt; In 1998, the group had it first major performance at the XXIII Festival Internacional de Danza “Lilia López” in [[San Luis Potosí, San Luis Potosí|San Luis Potosí]].&lt;ref name="15años"&gt; {{cite news |title= Todo listo para festejar los 15 años de La Cebra Danza Gay |agency=Notimex |location=Mexico City |date=May 30, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Everything ready to celebrate 15 years of La Cebra Danza Gay}} &lt;/ref&gt; Since then it has remained active, performing in various parts of Mexico and the United States.&lt;ref name="enkidu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="festeja"/&gt;  As of 2005, Danza del mal amor o mejor me voy had been performed 100 times.&lt;ref name="enkidu"/&gt; In 2010, it collaborated with humorist [[Alejandro García Villalón]] of the [[Nueva Trova Cubana]].&lt;ref name="arrancan"/&gt; Today, there are six main dancers José Rivera Moya, Bruno Ramírez, Hugo Cruz, Jonathan Villeda, Juan Madero and Jesús Salinas.&lt;ref name="culturaunam"/&gt; It is one of very few dance troupes consisting entirely of men, as most are dominated by women.&lt;ref name="festeja"/&gt;The members of the group are not necessarily homosexual, but the themes it works with almost exclusively are.&lt;ref name="leonmil"/&gt; La Cebra has had guest choreographers such as [[Rafael Rosales]], also from the Ballet Independiente, and [[Bruno Ramírez]].&lt;ref name="culturaunam"/&gt; The group receives support from the [[Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes]], with permanent practice space at the [[CONACULTA]] building in [[Colonia Guerrero, Mexico City|Colonia Guerrero in Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="culturaunam"/&gt; For its 15th anniversary, the troupe performed “Con humo en los ojos y en el corazón” by [[Uruguay]]an dancer [[Dery Fazio]]. The event also included a “retro” fashion show to support AIDS research.&lt;ref name="ofrecer"&gt; {{cite news |title= Ofrecerá La Cebra Danza Gay estreno mundial a cargo de Dery Fazio |agency=Notimex |location=Mexico City |date=July 28, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=La Cebre Danza Gay will offer the world premier of a work by Dery Fazio }} &lt;/ref&gt; 
==Repertoire and message==
La Cebra’s message and focus remains on the gay community and the issues it faces with some branching out to more general cultural and human rights issues.&lt;ref name="festeja"/&gt;&lt;ref name="culturaunam"/&gt; These include elements such as [[homoeroticism]],  violence,  minority rights, [[AIDS]], [[cross-dressing]], [[hate crime]]s, discrimination, male prostitution and the Catholic’s church stance on homosexuality.&lt;ref name="festeja"/&gt;&lt;ref name="15años"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ondea"&gt; {{cite news |title= Ondea el FIC bandera gay |author=Oscar Ced de León |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=September 5, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Festival Internacional Cervantines unfurls the gay flag}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

''Ave María Purísima, de prostitución y lentejuelas'' was created with the dance company in 1996. ''Yo no soy Pancho Villa ni me gusta el futbol'' was created in 1998 about the gay nightclub scene in Mexico City.&lt;ref name="festeja"/&gt;  ''Quinceañera del Bajío mata a sus chambelanes'' is a criticism of the drug-related violence which plagues Mexico.&lt;ref name="15años"/&gt; ''Oraciones'' was choreographed by Graciela Henriquez, which traces the roots of Latin American peoples and the religious syncretism that emerged after Spanish and Portuguese conquests.&lt;ref name="mozart"/&gt; ''Arcoiris Mambo'' is a homage to the music of the 1950s, and the movies of [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema|Mexico’s Golden Age of Cinema]].&lt;ref name="mambo"&gt; {{cite news |title= La Cebra danza gay sube a escena con "Mambo Arcoiris" |author=Angel Reyna |url= http://www.milenio.com/cdb/doc/noticias2011/f093ccf4edf26d1cdb9c4181ba51797c |newspaper=Milenio |location=Mexico City |date=October 26, 2010 |accessdate=September 22, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=La Cebra Danza Gay enters the state with “Mambo Arcoiris” }} &lt;/ref&gt; ''Bailemos a Mozart. Por los ángeles que se han ido'' was created in 2001 in memory of those who had died of AIDS. ''El tiempo lo arrasa todo. Queda la muerte'' was created in 2004 which discusses death and AIDS. ''Cartas de amor'' is about people who live with [[HIV]].&lt;ref name="15años"/&gt; ''El soldado y el marinero'' is a love story.&lt;ref name="festeja"/&gt;
==Appearances==
La Cebra has performed in various parts of Mexico, such as [[Baja California]], [[Colima]] and [[Oaxaca]] and has made appearances in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name="mozart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="festeja"/&gt; The group performed ''Bailemos a Mozart, por los angeles'' at the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]], the country’s most prestigious venue.&lt;ref name="mozart"/&gt; The group represented Mexico at the X Biennal de la Danse in [[Lyon]], France in 2002.&lt;ref name="leonmil"/&gt;  It participated in the X Muestra Internacional de Danza [[Tijuana]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="llega"/&gt; In 2010, performed at the Feria del Libro y la Rosa in [[Taxco]], sponsored by [[UNAM]],&lt;ref name="culturaunam"/&gt; and the Festival Artístico [[Coahuila]] .&lt;ref name="mambo"/&gt; In 2011, they were invited to perform at the [[Festival Internacional Cervantino]], which is significant as [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]] is considered one of the most conservative cities in Mexico.&lt;ref name="ondea"/&gt;&lt;ref name="leonmil"/&gt; For this event, the group opted to perform a work called ''Ganímedes'',” which is based on the [[Ganymede (mythology)|Greek myth]]. It has homoerotic themes and dances who are nude except for body paint.&lt;ref name="ondea"/&gt;

This is a '''list of beauty pageants''' from around the world. A [[beauty pageant]] or beauty contest is a competition that has traditionally focused on judging and ranking the [[Physical attractiveness|physical attributes]] of the contestants, although some contests have evolved to also incorporate [[Personality psychology|personality]], intelligence, talent, and answers to judges' questions as judged criteria.&lt;ref name="chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-10/25/content_385531.htm"&gt;{{cite news|title=Miss Earth 2004 beauty pageant|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-10/25/content_385531.htm|publisher=China Daily|agency=Reuters|date=2004-10-25|accessdate=2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=publicized-contests&gt;{{cite news|title=Brazil’s Miss World finalist has her hands and feet amputated|url=http://english.pravda.ru/society/stories/22-01-2009/106992-mariana_miss_world-0/|accessdate=24 September 2012|newspaper=English.pravda.ru|date=22 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=make-beauty&gt;{{cite news|last=Enriquez|first=Amee|title=Philippines: How to make a beauty queen|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25550425|accessdate=3 February 2014|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|date=2 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pageant industry commonly uses three specific [[Courtesy title|courtesy titles]] – [[Miss]], [[Ms.|Ms]] and [[Mrs.|Mrs]] – to clearly identify the difference between pageant divisions. Similar events for men or boys are usually called by other names and are more likely to be [[bodybuilding]] contests.

[https://www.bu.edu/av/core/journal/xxiii/Aruffo.pdf "Problems with the Noble Lie."] ''Boston University''.  Accessed 4 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In [[politics]], a '''noble lie''' is a [[myth]] or [[Lie|untruth]], often, but not invariably, of a religious nature, knowingly propagated by an [[elite]] to maintain social harmony or to advance an agenda. The noble lie is a concept originated by [[Plato]] as described in the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]''.

In [[religion]], a '''pious fiction''' is a narrative that is presented as true by the author, but is considered by others to be fictional albeit produced with an altruistic motivation. The term is sometimes used [[pejorative]]ly to suggest that the author of the narrative was deliberately misleading readers for selfish or deceitful reasons. The term is often used in religious contexts, sometimes referring to passages in religious texts.

==Plato's ''Republic''==
[[File:P. Oxy. LII 3679.jpg|thumb|P. Oxy. 3679, manuscript from the 3rd century AD, containing fragments of Plato's Republic.]]
{{main|The Republic (Plato)}}
Plato presented the Noble Lie (γενναῖον ψεῦδος, ''gennaion pseudos'' – literally, "a lie or wrong opinion about origin") in the fictional tale known as the myth or parable of the metals. In it, Socrates provides the origin of the three [[social class]]es who compose the republic proposed by Plato; Socrates speaks of a [[Social stratification|socially stratified society]], wherein the populace are told "a sort of Phoenician tale":

{{Quotation|...the earth, as being their mother, delivered them, and now, as if their land were their mother and their nurse, they ought to take thought for her and defend her against any attack, and regard the other citizens as their brothers and children of the self-same earth...While all of you, in the city, are brothers, we will say in our tale, yet god, in fashioning those of you who are fitted to hold rule, mingled gold in their generation, for which reason they are the most precious—but in the helpers, silver, and iron and brass in the farmers and other craftsmen. And, as you are all akin, though for the most part you will breed after your kinds, it may sometimes happen that a golden father would beget a silver son, and that a golden offspring would come from a silver sire, and that the rest would, in like manner, be born of one another. So that the first and chief injunction that the god lays upon the rulers is that of nothing else are they to be such careful guardians, and so intently observant as of the intermixture of these metals in the souls of their offspring, and if sons are born to them with an infusion of brass or iron they shall by no means give way to pity in their treatment of them, but shall assign to each the status due to his nature and thrust them out among the artisans or the farmers. And again, if from these there is born a son with unexpected gold or silver in his composition they shall honor such and bid them go up higher, some to the office of guardian, some to the assistanceship, alleging that there is an oracle that the city shall then be overthrown when the man of iron or brass is its guardian.&lt;ref&gt;Book 3, 414e–15c&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Socrates proposes and claims that if the people believed "this myth...[it] would have a good effect, making them more inclined to care for the state and one another."&lt;ref&gt;Book 3, 415c–d&lt;/ref&gt; This is his ''noble lie'': "a contrivance for one of those falsehoods that come into being in case of need, of which we were just now talking, some noble one..."&lt;ref&gt;414b–c&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern views==

===Karl Popper===
[[File:Karl Popper2.jpg|right|thumb|Sir Karl Popper in 1990]]
{{main article|Karl Popper}}
Karl Popper accused Plato of trying to base religion on a noble lie as well. In ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Popper remarks, "It is hard to understand why those of Plato's commentators who praise him for fighting against the subversive conventionalism of the Sophists, and for establishing a spiritual naturalism ultimately based on religion, fail to censure him for making a convention, or rather an invention, the ultimate basis of religion." Religion for Plato is a noble lie, at least if we assume that Plato meant all of this sincerely, not cynically. Popper finds Plato's conception of religion to have been very influential in subsequent thought.&lt;ref name="popper"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071209060939/http://www.positiveliberty.com/2007/07/open-society-vi-on-religion-as-a-noble-lie.html Positive Liberty » Open Society VI: On Religion as a Noble Lie&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leo Strauss===

{{main article|Leo Strauss}}
Strauss noted that thinkers of the first rank, going back to Plato, had raised the problem of whether good and effective politicians could be completely truthful and still achieve the necessary ends of their society. By implication, Strauss asks his readers to consider whether it is true that noble lies have no role at all to play in uniting and guiding the [[polis]]. Are myths needed to give people meaning and purpose and to ensure a stable society? Or can men dedicated to relentlessly examining, in [[Nietzsche]]'s language, those "deadly truths," flourish freely? Thus, is there a limit to the political, and what can be known absolutely? In ''The City and Man,'' Strauss discusses the myths outlined in [[The Republic (Plato)|Plato's ''Republic'']] that are required for all governments. These include a belief that the state's land belongs to it even though it was likely acquired illegitimately and that citizenship is rooted in something more than the accidents of birth. Seymour Hersh also claims that Strauss endorsed noble lies: myths used by political leaders seeking to maintain a cohesive society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seymour Hersh|Seymour M. Hersh]], [http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?030512fa_fact "Selective Intelligence"], ''[[The New Yorker]]'', May 12, 2003, accessed June 1, 2007.{{Dead link|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reason"&gt;Brian Doherty, [http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml "Origin of the Specious: Why Do Neoconservatives Doubt Darwin?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725170209/http://www.reason.com/9707/fe.bailey.shtml |date=2008-07-25 }}, ''[[Reason Online]]'', July 1997, accessed February 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]'', documentary filmmaker [[Adam Curtis]] opines that "Strauss believed it was for politicians to assert powerful and inspiring myths that everyone could believe in. They might not be true, but they were necessary illusions. One of these was religion; the other was the myth of the nation."&lt;ref&gt;''The Rise of the Politics of Fear''; Episode 1: "Baby It's Cold Outside"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desmond Lee===

{{main article|Desmond Lee}}
"Plato has been criticized for his Foundation Myth as if it were a calculated lie. That is partly because the phrase here translated 'magnificent myth' (p.414b) has been conventionally mistranslated 'noble lie'; and this has been used to support the charge that Plato countenances manipulation by propaganda. But the myth is accepted by all three classes, Guardians included. It is meant to replace the national traditions which any community has, which are intended to express the kind of community it is, or wishes to be, its ideals, rather than to state matters of fact."&lt;ref name="Plato p177"&gt;Plato: The Republic, Penguin Classics, translated by Desmond Lee, p177&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sea of Faith===

{{main article|Sea of Faith}}
The Sea of Faith Network (SoF) aims are "Exploring and promoting religious faith as a human creation..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sofn.org.uk/ Sea of Faith homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although arguably not an organisation ''based'' on the noble lie, many of their members no longer believe, but continue to espouse religious beliefs for positive social control and continue to hold positions in many religious organizations and various church groups.

The '''nude''' figure is a tradition in [[Western art]], and has been used to express ideals of male and female beauty and other human qualities. It was a central preoccupation of [[Ancient Greek art]], and after a semi-dormant period in the Middle Ages returned to a central position in Western art with the [[Renaissance]]. Athletes, dancers, and warriors are depicted to express human energy and life, and nudes in various poses may express basic or complex emotions such as [[pathos]].&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, Ch.1 ''The Naked and the Nude''&lt;/ref&gt;  In one sense, a nude is a work of [[fine art]] that has as its primary subject the unclothed human body,&lt;ref&gt;Clark&lt;/ref&gt; forming a subject [[Genre#Visual arts|genre]] of art, in the same way as [[Landscape art|landscapes]] and [[still life]]. Unclothed figures often also play a part in other types of art, such as [[history painting]], including [[Allegory#Art|allegorical]] and [[religious art]],  [[portrait painting|portraiture]], or the [[decorative arts]].

==History==
Nude female figures called [[Venus figurine]]s are found in very early prehistoric art, and in historical times, similar images represent fertility deities.&lt;ref name="Graves"&gt;Graves&lt;/ref&gt; Representations of gods and goddesses in Babylonian and Ancient Egyptian art are the precursors of the works of Western antiquity. Other significant non-Western traditions of depicting nudes come from [[History of sex in India#Ancient times|India]], and Japan, but the nude does not form an important aspect of [[Chinese art]]. Temple sculptures and cave paintings, some very explicit, are part of the Hindu tradition of the value of sexuality, and as in many warm climates partial or complete nudity was common in everyday life. Japan had a tradition of mixed communal bathing that existed until recently, and was often portrayed in woodcut prints.

===Ancient Greece===
{{see also|Ancient Greek sculpture}}
[[File:Diadoumenos-Atenas.jpg|thumb|Copy of [[Polykleitos|Polyclitus]]' [[Diadumenos]],  [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens]]]]

The earliest [[Greek sculpture]], from the early [[Bronze Age]] [[Cycladic civilization]] consists mainly of stylized male figures who are presumably nude. This is certainly the case for the [[kouros]], a large standing figure of a male nude that was the mainstay of [[Archaic Greece|Archaic Greek]] sculpture. The first realistic sculptures of nude males, the kouroi depict nude youths who stand rigidly posed with one foot forward.&lt;ref name="Rodgers_&amp;_Plantzos"/&gt; By the 5th century BCE, Greek sculptors' mastery of anatomy resulted in greater naturalness and more varied poses. An important innovation was [[contrapposto]]—the asymmetrical posture of a figure standing with one leg bearing the body's weight and the other relaxed. An early example of this is [[Polykleitos]]' sculpture ''[[Doryphoros]]'' (ca. 440 BCE).&lt;ref name="Rodgers_&amp;_Plantzos"/&gt;

In the convention of [[heroic nudity]], gods and heroes were shown nude, while ordinary mortals were less likely to be so, though athletes and warriors in combat were often depicted nude.

In Ancient Greece, where the mild climate was conducive to being lightly-clothed or nude whenever convenient, and  male athletes competed at religious festivals entirely nude, and celebrated the human body, it was perfectly natural for the Greeks to associate the male nude form with triumph, glory, and even moral excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primitivism.com/nudity.htm|title=Nudity in Ancient to Modern Cultures|first=Aileen|last=Goodson|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek goddess Aphrodite was a deity whom the Greeks preferred to see clothed. In the mid-fourth century BC, the sculptor [[Praxiteles]] made a nude [[Aphrodite of Cnidus|Aphrodite]], called the Knidian, which established a new tradition for the female nude, having idealized proportions based on mathematical ratios as were the nude male statues. The nudes of Greco-Roman art are conceptually perfected ideal persons, each one a vision of health, youth, geometric clarity, and organic equilibrium. Kenneth Clark considered idealization the hallmark of true nudes, as opposed to more descriptive and less artful figures that he considered merely naked. His emphasis on idealization points up an essential issue: seductive and appealing as nudes in art may be, they are meant to stir the mind as well as the passions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in Western Art and its Beginnings in Antiquity,  In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nuba/hd_nuba.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian attitudes cast doubt on the value of the human body, and the Christian emphasis on chastity and celibacy further discouraged depictions of nakedness, even in the few surviving Early Medieval survivals of secular art. Completely unclothed figures are rare in medieval art, the notable exceptions being [[Adam and Eve]] and the damned in ''[[Last Judgement]]'' scenes, and the ideal forms of Greco-Roman nudes are completely lost, transformed into symbols of shame and sin, weakness and defenselessness.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp.&amp;nbsp;300–309&lt;/ref&gt; This was true not only in Western Europe, but also in Byzantine art.&lt;ref&gt;Ryder&lt;/ref&gt;  Increasingly, Christ was shown largely naked in scenes of his Passion, especially the [[Crucifixion of Jesus in Christian art|Crucifixion]],&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp.&amp;nbsp;221–226&lt;/ref&gt; and even when glorified in heaven, to allow him to display the wounds his sufferings had involved.  The [[Nursing Madonna]] and [[Mary Magdalene#In art|naked "Penitent Mary Magdalene"]], as well as the infant [[Jesus]], whose [[Circumcision of Jesus#Depictions in art|penis was sometimes emphasized]] for theological reasons, are other exceptions with elements of nudity in medieval religious art.

By the late medieval period female nudes intended to be attractive edged back into art, especially in the relatively private medium of the [[illuminated manuscript]], and in classical contexts such as the [[Signs of the Zodiac]] and illustrations to [[Ovid]].  The shape of the female "Gothic nude" was very different from the classical ideal, with a long body shaped by gentle curves, a narrow chest and high waist, small round breasts, and a prominent bulge at the stomach (as in the [[Hugo van der Goes]] at left).&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp.&amp;nbsp;307–312&lt;/ref&gt; Male nudes tended to be slim and slight in figure, probably drawing on apprentices used as models, but were increasingly accurately observed.

The rediscovery of classical culture in the Renaissance restored the nude to art. [[Donatello]] made [[David (Donatello)|two statues]] of the Biblical hero [[David]], a symbol for the [[Republic of Florence]]: his first (in marble, 1408–1409) shows a clothed figure, but his second, probably of the 1440s, is the first freestanding statue of a nude since antiquity,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–50&lt;/ref&gt; several decades before [[Michelangelo]]'s massive ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' (1501–04).  Nudes in Michelangelo's [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] reestablished a tradition of male nudes in depictions of Biblical stories; the subject of the martyrdom of the near-naked [[Saint Sebastian]] had already become highly popular. The monumental female nude returned to Western art in 1486 with [[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|''The Birth of Venus'']] by [[Sandro Botticelli]] for the [[Medici family]], who also owned the classical [[Venus de' Medici]], whose pose Botticelli adapted.

The ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Dresden Venus]]'' of [[Giorgione]] (c. 1510), also drawing on classical models, showed a reclining female nude in a landscape, beginning a long line of famous paintings including the ''[[Venus of Urbino]]'' ([[Titian]], 1538), the ''[[Rokeby Venus]]'' ([[Diego Velázquez]], c. 1650), [[Goya]]'s ''[[La maja desnuda|Nude Maja]]'' (c. 1798) and [[Manet]]'s ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'' (1863).  Although they reflect the proportions of ancient statuary, such figures as Titian's ''Venus and the Lute Player'' and ''Venus of Urbino'' highlight the sexuality of the female body rather than its ideal geometry. In addition to adult male and female figures, the classical depiction of Eros became the model for the naked Christ child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance,  In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/numr/hd_numr.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raphael]] in his later years is usually credited as the first artist to consistently use female models for the drawings of female figures, rather than studio apprentices or other boys with breasts added, who were previously used. Michelangelo's suspiciously boyish ''[[Study of a Kneeling Nude Girl for The Entombment]]'' ([[Louvre]], c. 1500), which is usually said to be the first nude female [[figure study]], predates this and is an example of how even figures who would be shown clothed in the final work were often worked out in nude studies, so that the form under the clothing was understood. The nude [[figure drawing]] or figure study of a [[model (art)|live model]] rapidly became an important part of artistic practice and training, and remained so until the 20th century.

[[File:The Three Graces, by Peter Paul Rubens, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|''[[The Three Graces (Rubens)|The Three Graces]]'' (1636–1638) by [[Peter Paul Rubens]]]]

In [[Baroque]] art, the continuing fascination with classical antiquity influenced artists to renew their approach to the nude, but with more naturalistic, less idealized depictions, perhaps more frequently working from live models.&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt; Both genders are represented; the male in the form of heroes such as Hercules and Samson, and female in the form of Venus and the Three Graces. [[Peter Paul Rubens]], who with evident delight painted women of generous figure and radiant flesh, gave his name to the adjective rubenesque.

In the later Baroque or [[Rococo]] period, a more decorative and playful style emerged, exemplified by [[François Boucher]]'s ''Venus Consoling Love'', likely commissioned by [[Madame Pompadour]].

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, classical subjects remained popular, along with nudes in [[historical paintings]]. In the later nineteenth century, academic painters continued with classical themes, but were challenged by the Impressionists. Eduard Manet shocked the public of his time by painting nude women in contemporary situations in his ''[[Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' (1863) and ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'' (1865), and Gustave Courbet earned criticism for portraying in his ''[[Woman with a Parrot]]'' a naked prostitute without vestige of goddess or nymph. Edgar Degas painted many nudes of women in ordinary circumstances, such as taking a bath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/degas-and-nude|publisher=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|title=Degas and the Nude|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auguste Rodin challenged classical canons of idealization in his expressively distorted Adam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in Baroque and Later Art,  In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nuba/hd_nuba.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the invention of photography, artists began using the new medium as a source for paintings, [[Eugène Delacroix]] being one of the first.&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt;

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Woman3.jpg|thumb|''[[Woman III]]'' (1953) by [[Willem de Kooning]], the human body in [[Abstract Expressionism]]]] --&gt;

Although both the Academic tradition and Impressionists lost their cultural supremacy at the beginning of the twentieth century, the nude remained although transformed by the ideas of [[modernism]]. The idealized Venus was replaced by the woman intimately depicted in private settings, as in the work of [[Egon Schiele]].&lt;ref name="Graves"/&gt; The simplified modern forms of [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Gaston Lachaise]] and [[Aristide Maillol]] recall the original goddesses of fertility more than Greek goddesses.&lt;ref&gt;Borzello, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; In early abstract paintings, the body could be fragmented or dismembered, as in Picasso's [[Demoiselles d'Avignon]], but there are also abstracted versions of classical themes, such as [[Henri Matisse]]'s dancers and bathers.

In the post-WWII era, [[Abstract Expressionism]] moved the center of Western art from Paris to New York City. One of the primary influences in the rise of abstraction, the critic [[Clement Greenberg]], had supported de Kooning's early abstract work. Despite Greenberg's advice, the artist, who had begun as a figurative painter, returned to the human form in early 1950 with his [[Woman III|''Woman'' series]]. Although having some references to the traditions of single female figures, the women were portrayed as voracious, distorted, and semi-abstract. According to the artist, he wanted to "create the angry humor of tragedy"; having the frantic look of the atomic age, a world in turmoil, a world in need of comic relief. Later, he said "Maybe ... I was painting the woman in me. Art isn't a wholly masculine occupation, you know. I'm aware that some critics would take this to be an admission of latent homosexuality ... If I painted beautiful women, would that make me a non-homosexual? I like beautiful women. In the flesh—even the models in magazines. Women irritate me sometimes. I painted that irritation in the Woman series. That's all." Such ideas could not be expressed by pure abstraction alone.&lt;ref&gt;Scala, Ch 2. "The Influence of Anxiety" by Susan H. Edwards&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics, however, see the Woman series as [[misogynistic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unveiling the American Nude|last=Monaghan|first=Peter|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=Jan 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other New York artists of this period retained the figure as their primary subject. [[Alice Neel]] painted nudes, including her own self-portrait, in the same straightforward style as clothed sitters,&lt;ref&gt;Leppert, pp.&amp;nbsp;154–155&lt;/ref&gt; being primarily concerned with color and emotional content.&lt;ref&gt;Borzello, Chapter 2 - The Changing Room: Female Perspectives&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Pearlstein]] uses unique cropping and perspective to explore the abstract qualities of nudes. As a young artist in the 1950s, Pearlstein exhibited both abstracts and figures, but it was deKooning that advised him to continue with figurative work.&lt;ref&gt;Borzello, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1970, from feminist principles, [[Sylvia Sleigh]] painted a series of works reversing stereotypical artistic themes by featuring naked men in poses usually associated with women.&lt;ref&gt;Leppert, pp.&amp;nbsp;221–223&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucien Freud]] was one of a small group of painters which included [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] who came to be known as "The School of London"; creating figurative work in the 1970s when it was unfashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/25/arts/the-school-of-london-mordantly-messy-as-ever.html|title=The School of London, Mordantly Messy as Ever|first=ALAN|last=RIDING|date=September 25, 1995|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=2013-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of his life his works had become icons of the [[Post Modern]] era, depicting the human body without a trace of idealization, as in his series working with an [[Benefits Supervisor Sleeping|obese model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2012/feb/08/lucian-freud-national-portrait-gallery#/?picture=385691839&amp;index=5|title=Lucien Freud|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=10 November 2012|location=London|date=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Freud's works is entitled "Naked Portrait", which implies a realistic image of a particular unclothed woman rather than a conventional nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/freud-naked-portrait-t01972|title=Naked Portrait 1972-3|publisher=The Tate Modern|accessdate=2013-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Freud's obituary in ''The New York Times'', it is stated: His "stark and revealing paintings of friends and intimates, splayed nude in his studio, recast the art of portraiture and offered a new approach to figurative art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lucian Freud, Figurative Painter Who Redefined Portraiture, Is Dead at 88|newspaper=The New York Times|first=William|last=Grimes|date=Jul 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings of [[Jenny Saville]] include family and self-portraits among other nudes; often done in extreme perspectives, attempting to balance realism with abstraction; all while expressing how a woman feels about the female nude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artists/jenny_saville.htm|title=Jenny Saville|publisher=Saatchi Gallery|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lisa Yuskavage]]'s nude figures painted in a nearly academic manner constitute a "parody of art historical nudity and the male obsession with the female form as object".&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Currin]] is another painter whose work frequently reinterprets historic nudes.&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecily Brown]]'s paintings combine figurative elements and abstraction in a style reminiscent of de Kooning.&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marlene Dumas]] paints emotionally challenging images derived from her own snapshots or from photographs found in news magazines.&lt;ref&gt;Mullins, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Dumas says of her paintings of nude figures that "it was not the nude I was looking for, nor the posing figure, but the erotic conditions of life ... Two 'subjects' confronting each other."&lt;ref&gt;Dumas, M., Bedford, E., South African National Gallery., &amp; Standard Bank Centre Art Gallery. (2007). ''Marlene Dumas: Intimate relations''. Johannesburg: Jacana Media. p. 43. {{ISBN|978-1-77009-381-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the twentieth century saw the rise of new media and approaches to art, although they began much earlier. In particular [[installation art]] often includes images of the human body, and [[performance art]] frequently includes nudity. "Cut Piece" by [[Yoko Ono]] was first performed in 1964 (then known as a "happening"). Audience members were requested to come on stage and begin cutting away her clothing until she was naked. Several contemporary performance artists such as [[Marina Abramović]], [[Vanessa Beecroft]] and [[Carolee Schneemann]] use their own nude bodies or other performers in their work.

===Drawing===
{{Main|Figure drawing}}
In art, a '''figure drawing''' is a study of the [[Human figure|human form]] in its various shapes and [[Human positions|body postures]], with line, form, and composition as the primary objective, rather than the subject person. 
A '''life drawing''' is a work that has been drawn from an observation of a live [[Model (art)|model]]. Study of the human figure has traditionally been considered the best way to learning how to draw, beginning in the late Renaissance and continuing to the present.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolaides&lt;/ref&gt;

===Printmaking===
{{Main|Printmaking}}
Japanese prints are one of the few non-western traditions that can be called nudes, but they are quite different. The activity of communal bathing in Japan is portrayed as just another social activity, without the significance placed upon the lack of clothing that exists in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
{{See also|List of engravings by Dürer}}

===Painting===
{{Main|Figure painting}}
Oil paint historically has been the ideal medium for depicting the nude. By blending and layering paint, the surface can become more like skin. "Its slow drying time and various degrees of viscosity enable the artist to achieve rich and subtle blends of color and texture, which can suggest transformations from one human substance to another."&lt;ref&gt;Scala, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculpture===
{{Main|Sculpture}}
&lt;!-- [[File:Nude model in sculpture studio, c. 1912.jpg|thumb|Model in a sculpture studio, c. 1912]] --&gt;
Due to its durability, it is in sculpture that we see the full, nearly unbroken history of the nude from the Stone Age to the present. Figures, usually of the naked female, have been found in the [[Balkans|Balkan region]] dating back to 7,000 BCE &lt;ref&gt;Gimbustas, Marija ''The Goddesses and Gods of Old Europe: Myths and Cult Images'', University of California Press, Berkeley, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to this day to be generated. In the Indian and Southeast Asian sculpture tradition nudes were frequently adorned with bracelets and jewelry that tended to "punctuate their charms and demarcate the different parts of their bodies much as developed musculature does in the male."&lt;ref&gt;Finn, David, essay by Vicki Goldberg, ''Nude Sculpture: 5,000 Years'', Harry N. Abrams Ltd., Publishers, New York,  2000. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography===
{{Main|Nude photography (art)}}
The nude has been a subject of photography almost since its invention in the nineteenth century. Early photographers often selected poses that imitated the classical nudes of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Dawes, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Photography suffers from the problem of being too real,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2012/naked-before-the-camera|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|title=Naked Before the Camera|accessdate=10 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scala, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and for many years was not accepted by those committed to the traditional fine arts.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; However, the work of many photographers has been established as fine artists including [[Ruth Bernhard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| author=Conrad, Donna  | publisher=PhotoVision| title = A Conversation with Ruth Bernhard| newspaper = Vol. 1 No. 3| year = 2000  | url = http://www.photovisionmagazine.com/articles/bernhard.interview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Imogen Cunningham]], [[Anne Brigman]], [[Edward Weston]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edward-weston.com/edward_weston_nudes.htm|title=Edward Weston|accessdate=10 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113145451/http://www.edward-weston.com/edward_weston_nudes.htm|archivedate=13 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alfred Stieglitz]].

===New media===
In the late twentieth century several new art forms have emerged, including [[installation art|installations]], [[performance art|performance]], and [[video art]] all of which have been used to create works that include nudity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1322089/six-dance-shows-stripped-bare-redefining-nudity-on-stage|title=Six Dance Shows Stripped Bare: Redefining Nudity on Stage|last=Daris|first=Gabriella|date=March 6, 2018|work=Artinfo|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The naked and the nude===

While there is no single definition of fine art, there are certain generally accepted features of most definitions. In the fine arts, the subject is not merely copied from nature, but transformed by the artist into an [[Aesthetics#Aesthetics and the philosophy of art|aesthetic]] object, usually without significant utilitarian, commercial ([[advertising]], [[illustration]]), or purely [[Decorative art|decorative]] purposes. There is also a judgement of taste; the fine art nude being part of [[high culture]] rather than [[middle brow]] or [[low culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Low Culture should not be confused with the [[Lowbrow (art movement)|Lowbrow or Graffiti Art Movement]], which often uses nude images from popular culture but attempts to raise them to Fine Art.&lt;/ref&gt; However, judgements of taste in art are not entirely subjective, but include criteria of skill and [[Artisan|craftsmanship]] in the creation of objects, communication of complex and non-trivial messages, and [[creativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Dutton, Ch. 3 - ''What is Art?''&lt;/ref&gt; Some works accepted as high culture of the past, including much [[Academic art]], are now seen as imitative or sentimental&lt;ref&gt;King, Ross&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise known as [[kitsch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csmt.uchicago.edu/glossary2004/kitsch.htm|title=Theories of Media, Keywords Glossary:kitsch | publisher=The University of Chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also: [[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern artists have continued to explore classical themes, but also more abstract representations, and movement away from idealization to depict people more individually. During most of the twentieth century, the depiction of human beauty was of little interest to modernists, who were concerned instead with the creation of beauty through formal means.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner pp. 44, 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; In the contemporary, or [[Postmodern art|Post-modern]] era, the nude may be seen as passé by many,&lt;ref&gt;Steinhart, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; however there are always artists that continue to find inspiration in the human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/147546-nude-freud-painting-in-17m-record-sale|title=Nude Freud painting in £17m record sale|publisher=Metro|accessdate=22 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most often cited book on the nude in art history is ''The Nude: a Study in Ideal Form'' by Lord [[Kenneth Clark]], first published in 1956. The introductory chapter makes the most often-quoted distinction&lt;ref&gt;Nead, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; between the naked body and the nude. Clark states that to be naked is to be deprived of clothes, and implies embarrassment and shame, while a nude, as a work of art, has no such connotations. This separation of the artistic form from the social and cultural issues remains largely unexamined by classical art historians.

One of the defining characteristics of the modern era in art is the blurring of the line between the naked and the nude. This likely first occurred with the painting ''[[La maja desnuda|The Nude Maya]]'' (1797) by Goya, which in 1815 drew the attention of the [[Spanish Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;Goya, F., Tomlinson, J. A., Calvo, S. F., Museo del Prado., &amp; National Gallery of Art (U.S.). (2002). ''Goya: Images of women''. Washington, D.C: National Gallery of Art. p. 228. {{ISBN|0-89468-293-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The shocking elements were that it showed a particular model in a contemporary setting, with pubic hair rather than the smooth perfection of goddesses and nymphs, who returned the gaze of the viewer rather than looking away. (Goya then painted another version, with clothes.) Some of the same characteristics were shocking almost 70 years later when Manet exhibited his ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'', not because of religious issues, but because of its modernity. Rather than being a timeless Odalisque that could be safely viewed with detachment, Manet's image was of a prostitute of that time, perhaps referencing the male viewers' own sexual practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Manet's Olympia: The Figuration of Scandal|author=Charles Bernheimer|journal=Poetics Today|volume=10|issue=2|date=Summer 1989|pages=255–277|publisher=Duke University Press|jstor=1773024|doi=10.2307/1773024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian and author, [[Frances Borzello]] says that contemporary artists are no longer interested in the ideals and traditions of the past, but confront the viewer with all the sexuality, discomfort and anxiety that the unclothed body may express, perhaps eliminating the distinction between the naked and the nude.&lt;ref&gt;Borzello, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; [[Performance art]] takes the final step by presenting actual naked bodies as a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;Borzello, Chapter 2 - Body Art: the Journey into Nakedness&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
 ===Men, Women, and Children=== 
--&gt;

===Sexuality===
Kenneth Clark noted that sexuality was part of the attraction to the nude as a subject of art, stating "no nude, however abstract, should fail to arouse in the spectator some vestige of [[erotic]] feeling, even though it be only the faintest shadow—and if it does not do so it is bad art and false morals." According to Clark, the explicit temple sculptures of tenth-century India "are great works of art because their eroticism is part of their whole philosophy." Great art can contain significant sexual content without being [[obscene]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9&lt;/ref&gt; However sexually explicit works of fine art produced in Europe before the modern era, such as [[Gustav Courbet]]'s ''[[L'Origine du monde]]'', were not intended for public display.&lt;ref&gt;Leppert p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Courbet's "L'origine du monde": The Origin without an Original|first=Linda|last=Nochlin|work=October|volume=37|year=1986|pages=76–86|publisher=The MIT Press|jstor=778520|doi=10.2307/778520}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judgement of whether a particular work is artistic or [[pornographic]] is ultimately subjective and has changed through history and from one culture to another. Some individuals judge any public display of the unclothed body to be unacceptable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/national-gallery-visitor-attacks-gauguin-painting-officials-say/2011/04/03/AFoATUXC_story.html|title=National Gallery visitor attacks Gauguin painting|publisher=The Washington Post|author1=Smith, Timothy R.  |author2=Weil, Martin  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=April 3, 2011| accessdate=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others may find artistic merit in [[Erotic art|explicitly sexual]] images. Public reviews of art may or may not address the issue.&lt;ref name="Gopnik"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gopnik|first=Blake|title=In Art We Lust|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/06/AR2009110600041_2.html|accessdate=2013-02-23|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public reaction versus the art world====
The nude, particularly the female body, has always been one of the more obvious subjects of work in museums. However, in the United States nudity in art is a controversial subject when public funding and display in certain venues brings the work to the attention of the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Nead&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Nude in Contemporary Art|publisher=The Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puritan history continues to impact the selection of artwork shown in museums and galleries. At the same time that any nude may be suspect in the view of many patrons and the public, art critics may reject work that is not either ironic or fetishistic, and therefore cutting edge. "Artists who refuse to assault the body with stylishly perverse psychological or physical deformations are usually dismissed as being hopelessly out of tune with today's art world."&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Works that celebrate the human body are likely to be seen as too erotic by one group, and kitsch by the other. According to Bram Dijkstra, attractive nudes by American artists have been relegated to storage by museums, with only rare special exhibits or publications in recent decades. Relatively tame nudes tend to be shown in museums, while works with shock value such as those by [[Jeff Koons#Made in Heaven series|Jeff Koons]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2008/06/09/080609craw_artworld_schjeldahl|title=Funhouse:A Jeff Koons retrospective|first=Peter|last=Schjeldahl|date=June 9, 2008|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=2013-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; are shown in cutting-edge galleries. Dijkstra says the art world has devalued simple beauty and pleasure, although these values are present in art from the past and in many contemporary works.&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

====Explaining nudity in art to students====
When school groups visit museums, there are inevitable questions that teachers or tour leaders must be prepared to answer. The basic advice is to give matter-of-fact answers emphasizing the differences between art and other images, the universality of the human body, and the values and emotions expressed in the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/citi/resources/Rsrc_001627.pdf|title=Body Language:How to Talk to Students about Nudity in Art|date=March 18, 2003|publisher=Art Institute of Chicago|accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the problems that might arise lead many teachers to avoid the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/education/teacherartexchange/archive/Jan08/0010.html|title=Teach Art Exchange: Response to Nudity in Art Education|publisher=The Getty.edu|date=January 8, 2008|accessdate=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical works, children were rarely shown except for babies and [[putto|putti]]. Before the era of Freudian psychoanalysis, children were assumed to have no [[child sexuality|sexual feelings before puberty]], so naked children were shown as symbols of pure innocence. Boys often swam nude, and were shown doing so in paintings by [[John Singer Sargent]], [[George Bellows]], and others. Other images were more erotic, either symbolically or explicitly.&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, Ch. 5 - Retreat to the Dream&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leppert, Ch. 2 - Representing the Young&lt;/ref&gt;

Men and women did not receive equal opportunities in nude training during the Renaissance. Female artists were not allowed access to nude models and could not participate in this part of the arts education. During this time period the study of the nude figure was something all male artists were expected to go through to become an artist of worth and to be able to create History Paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, Linda. Women, Art and Power and Other Essays. Thames and Hudson, 1988. ProQuest. Web. 25 Sep. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Male nude: gods and warriors====
Academic art history tends to ignore the sexuality of the male nude, speaking instead of form and composition.&lt;ref&gt;Leppert, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of history, nude men represented martyrs and warriors, emphasizing an active role rather than the passive one assigned to women in art. [[Alice Neel]] and [[Lucien Freud]] painted the modern male nude in the classic reclining pose, with the genitals prominently displayed. [[Sylvia Sleigh]] painted versions of classic works with the genders reversed.

====Female nude: the Venus and Odalisques ====

The Greek goddesses were initially sculpted with drapery rather than nude. The first free-standing, life-sized sculpture of an entirely nude woman was the ''[[Aphrodite of Cnidus]]'' created ca. 360–340 BCE by [[Praxiteles]].&lt;ref name="Rodgers_&amp;_Plantzos"&gt;Rodgers, David and Plantzos, Dimitris. "Nude." ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Web. Retrieved 2 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The female nude became much more common in the later Hellenistic period.

Rarely seen during the Middle Ages, the female nude reappeared in Italy in the 15th century. Subsequently, eroticism became more emphatic in paintings such as [[Giorgione]]'s ''[[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Sleeping Venus]]'' (ca. 1510), which situated the reclining nude in an idyllic landscape, and [[Titian]]'s ''[[Danaë (Titian series)|Danaë]]'' series (ca. 1553–1556). These works inspired countless reclining female nudes for centuries afterwards.&lt;ref name="Rodgers_&amp;_Plantzos"/&gt; The annual glut of paintings of idealized nude women in the 19th-century [[Paris Salon]] was satirized by [[Honoré Daumier]] in an 1864 lithograph.

In the 19th century the [[Orientalism]] movement added another reclining female nude to the possible subjects of European paintings, the [[odalisque]], a slave or harem girl. One of the most famous was "The [[Grande Odalisque]]" painted by [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/grand-odalisque.html|title=Ingres' La Grand Odalisque }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Lynda Nead, the female nude is a matter of containing sexuality; in the case of the classical art history view represented by Kenneth Clark, this is about idealization and de-emphasis of overt sexuality, while the modern view recognizes that the human body is messy, unbounded, and problematical.&lt;ref&gt;Nead, Part I - Theorizing the Female Nude&lt;/ref&gt; If a virtuous woman is dependent and weak, as was assumed by the images in classical art, then a strong, independent woman could not be portrayed as virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, Ch. 3 - The "New Woman": Fading Flower or Scourge of Nature?&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern reinterpretations====
[[File:The Barricade by George Wesley Bellows - BMA.jpg|thumb|''[[The Barricade]]'' (1918), oil on canvas, by [[George Bellows]]. A painting inspired by an incident in August 1914 in which German soldiers used Belgian townspeople as [[human shields]].]]

Until the 1960s, art history and criticism rarely reflected anything other than the male point of view. The [[feminist art movement]] began to change this, but one of the first widely known statements of the political messages in nudity was made in 1972 by the art critic [[John Berger]]. In ''[[Ways of Seeing]]'', he argued that female nudes reflected and reinforced the prevailing power relationship between females portrayed in art and the predominantly male audience. A year later [[Laura Mulvey]] wrote "[[Feminist film theory|Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema]]" stating the concept of the [[Gaze|male gaze]], which asserts that all nudes are inherently voyeuristic.&lt;ref&gt;Leppert, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–11&lt;/ref&gt;

The feminist art movement was aimed at giving women the opportunity to have their art reach the same level of notoriety and respect that men’s art received. The idea that women are intellectually inferior to men came from Aristotelian ideology and was heavily depended on during the Renaissance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jacobs, Frederika H. “Woman's Capacity to Create: The Unusual Case of Sofonisba Anguissola.”'' Renaissance Quarterly,'' vol. 47, no. 1, 1994, pp. 74–101.&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed by [[Aristotle]] that during the process of procreation, men were the driving force. They held all creative power while women were the receivers. Women’s only role in reproduction was to provide the material and act as a vessel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This idea carried over into the image of the artist and the nude in art. The artist was seen specifically as a white male, and he was the only one who held the innate talent and creativity to be a successful professional artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This belief system was prevalent in nude art. Women were depicted as passive, and they did not possess any control over their image. The female nude during the Renaissance was an image created by the male gaze.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;McDonald, Helen. ''Erotic Ambiguities: The female nude in art.'' Routledge, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an eroticized image that holds the heterosexual male desire.

In Jill Fields’ article “Frontiers in Feminist Art History”, Fields examines the feminist art movement and how they attempted to change the image of the female nude. She considers how the image of the female nude was created and how the feminist art history movement attempted to change the way the image of the female nude was represented. Derived from the Renaissance ideal of feminine beauty, the image of the female body was created by men and for a male audience. In paintings like [[Gustave Courbet|Gustave Courbet's]],'' The Origin of the World,'' and [[François Boucher|Francois Boucher's]], ''Reclining Girl'', women are expressed with open legs. This symbol implies that women are to be passive and they are an object to be used.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer-Tugendhat, Daniela and Zanchi, Michael. “Art, Sexuality, and Gender Construction.” ''Art in Translation'', vol. 4, no. 3, 2012, pp. 361-382.&lt;/ref&gt; The feminist art history movement has aimed to change the way this image is perceived. The female nude has become less of an icon in Western art since the 1990s, but this decline in importance did not stop members of the feminist art movement from incorporating things like the “central core” image.&lt;ref&gt;Fields, Jill. “Frontiers in Feminist Art History.” ''Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies,'' vol. 33, no. 2, June 2012, pp, 1-21.&lt;/ref&gt; This way of representing the nude female figure in art was focused on the fact that women were in control of their own image. The central image was focused on vulva related symbols. By incorporating new images and symbols into the female nude image in Western art, the feminist art history movement continues to try and dismantle the male-dominated art world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Intersectionality ====
The nude image in art has affected women of color in a different way than it has white women, according to [[Charmaine Nelson]]. The different depictions of the nude in art has not only instituted a system of controlling the image of women but it has put women of color in a place of other. The intersection of their identities, as Nelson asserts, creates a “doubly fetishized black female body.”&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, pp. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Women of color are not represented to the degree that white women are in nude art from the Renaissance to the 1990s, and when they are represented it is in a different way than white women. The Renaissance ideal of female beauty did not include black women. White women were represented as a sexual image, and they were the ideal sexual image for men during the Renaissance. White women, in most major works, did not have pubic hair. Black women normally did, and this created their image in an animalistic sexual way.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nelson, Charmaine]]. "Coloured Nude: Fetishization, Disguise, Dichotomy." ''Racar''22.1-2 (1995): 97-107. ''ProQuest. ''Web. 17 Oct. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; While the white women’s image became one of innocence and the idealized, black women were continually overtly sexualized.

===Social commentary===
The nude has also been used to make a powerful social or political statement. An example is ''The Barricade'' by George Bellows, which depicts Belgian citizens being used as human shields by Germans in World War I. Although based upon a report of a real incident in which the victims were not nude, portraying them so in the painting emphasizes their vulnerability and universal humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Dijkstra, pp.&amp;nbsp;246–247&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cast of the Flash at 2015 PaleyFest.jpg|thumb|Panel with the cast of ''[[The Flash]]'' at 2015 PaleyFest]]

A '''panel discussion''', or simply a '''panel''', involves a group of people gathered to discuss a topic in front of an audience, typically at scientific, business, or [[academic conference]]s, [[fan convention]]s, and on television shows. Panels usually include a moderator who guides the discussion and sometimes elicits audience questions, with the goal of being informative and entertaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panel Discussions|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/panel-discussions-13909630|publisher=Nature Education|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kirsner|first1=Scott|title=How To Moderate a Panel Like a Pro|url=https://hbr.org/2013/05/how-to-moderate-a-panel-like-a|date=30 May 2013|work=[[Harvard Business Review]]|accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film panels at fan conventions have been credited with boosting box office returns by generating advance [[Marketing buzz|buzz]].

==Format==

The typical format for a discussion panel includes a moderator in front of an audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inside Our Schools: Teen-Age Congress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o00EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT12|accessdate=17 April 2015|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=12 April 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television shows in the English-speaking world that feature a discussion panel format include ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', ''[[Loose Women]]'', ''[[The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore]]'', as well as segments of the long-running ''[[Meet the Press]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hruby|first1=Patrick|title=Bill Maher’s ‘Real Time’: The survival manual for conservative panelists|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/mar/28/how-conservatives-survive-a-stint-on-bill-mahers-r/?page=all|work=[[Washington Times]]|date=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quiz shows featuring this format, such as ''[[QI]]'' and ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'', are called [[panel game]]s. The host of a panel is typically expected to bring a token refreshment or snack to the discussants.

==Fan conventions==

Panels at sci-fi [[fan convention]]s, such as  [[San Diego Comic-Con International|San Diego Comic-Con]] and [[New York Comic-Con]], have become increasingly popular; there are typically long lines to get access to the panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sacks|first1=Ethan|title=New York Comic Con will start with 10-day ‘Super Week’ as convention grows in size and popularity|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/n-y-comic-bigger-previous-years-start-10-day-super-week-article-1.1955449|accessdate=16 April 2015|work=[[New York Daily News]]|date=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panels often feature advance looks at upcoming films and [[video games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamar|first1=Cyriaque|title=4 Miserable Experiences You Can't Avoid at Comic-Con|url=http://www.cracked.com/blog/4-miserable-experiences-you-cant-avoid-at-comic-con/|accessdate=16 April 2015|work=[[Cracked (magazine)|Cracked]]|date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panels and the early screenings at conventions have been credited as increasing the popularity of blockbuster films in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burke|first1=Liam|title=The Comic Book Film Adaptation: Exploring Modern Hollywood’s Leading Genre|date=2015|publisher=Univ.

One of the earliest film panels was at the 1976 San Diego Comic-Con, when publicist Charles Lippincott hosted a slideshow—in front of a "somewhat skeptical" audience—for an upcoming film called ''[[Star Wars]]''. Five years later,  the ''[[Blade Runner]]'' panel at the 1981 San Diego Comic-Con featured a film [[featurette]], before featurettes were popular. At the 2000 event, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' preview panel ushered in today's era of hugely popular panels.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;{{cite news|title=The 10 Most Memorable Panels In Comic-Con History|url=http://www.film.com/movies/the-most-memorable-panels-in-comic-con-history|accessdate=16 April 2015|work=Film.com|date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pedra Furada''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈpɛdɾɐ fuˈɾadɐ}}, meaning pierced rock) is an important collection of over 800 [[archaeological site]]s in the state of [[Piauí]], [[Brazil]]. These include hundreds of rock paintings dating from circa 11,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/south_america/serra_da_capivara/pedra_furada/index.php Bradshaw Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; Charcoal from very ancient fires and stone shards that may be interpreted as tools suggest the possibility of a human presence prior to the arrival of [[Clovis culture|Clovis]] people in North America.

In 1973, a Brazilian and French team excavating a site located in the southeastern portion of what is now the [[Serra da Capivara National Park]] discovered the first finds. The discovery was reported by the Brazilian [[archaeologist]] [[Niède Guidon]], who published her findings in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Guidon, Niède y G. Delibrias |year=1986 |title=Carbon-14 dates point to man in the Americas 32 000 years ago |journal=Nature |issue=321 |pages=769–771 |doi=10.1038/321769a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has since conducted extensive excavations and published other findings.

==Excavations==
[[File:Sítio Arqueológico Boqueirão da Pedra Furada.jpg|thumb|300px|Rock paintings at Pedra Furada]]

Pedra Furada includes a collection of rock shelters used for thousands of years by human populations. The first excavations yielded charcoal deposits with [[Carbon-14]] dates of 48,000 to 32,000 years [[Before Present|BP]]. Repeated analysis has confirmed this dating, carrying the range of dates up to 60,000 BP.&lt;ref&gt;Guidon, Niède. 1986 "Las Unidades Culturales de Sao Raimundo Nonato – Sudeste del Estado de Piaui-Brasil"; ''New Evidence for the Pleistocene Peopling of the Americas:'' 157–171. Edited by Alan Bryan. Center for the Study of Early Man. University of Maine. Orono.&lt;/ref&gt;  A review of the site by archaeologist [[Tom Dillehay]] in 1994 suggested that the charcoal remains may have been from natural fires and were not necessarily indicative of human occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.thefreelibrary.com/On+a+Pleistocene+human+occupation+at+Pedra+Furada,+Brazil.-a016352243|title = On a Pleistocene human occupation at Pedra Furada, Brazil.|last = Meltzer|first = David|date = 1 December 1994|journal = Antiquity|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 20 January 2015|last2 = Adovasio|first2 = James|last3 = Dillehay|first3 = Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guidon has established 15 distinct levels, classified in three cultural phases, called ''Pedra Furada'', that includes the oldest remains; and ''Serra Talhada'', from 12,000 to 7,000 BP, with tools such as [[knives]], [[Scraper (archaeology)|scrapers]], [[Lithic flake|flakes]] used "as is" or with some retouch and [[lithic core]]s, all made of [[quartz]] or [[quartzite]].

The discoveries are the subject of debate as they apparently contradict the longstanding "[[Clovis culture#Clovis First .2F Single origin hypothesis|Clovis first]]" view for the settlement of [[Prehistoric migration and settlement of the Americas from Asia|humans in the Americas]], which holds that the first inhabitants of the continent were representatives of the [[Clovis culture]], which began roughly 11,500 BP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/america/clovis_first/|title = Clovis First: Shaking the Orthodoxy|date = 2011|accessdate = 20 January 2015|website = |publisher = Bradshaw Foundation|last = Oppenheimer|first = Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discoveries at other sites, such as [[Monte Verde]], [[Chile]], dated to 14,800 years BP, [[Piedra Museo]] in the Argentinian province of [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz]], dated 11,000 years BP,&lt;ref&gt;Paleoamerican Origins, Smithsonian, http://www.smithsonian.org/encyclopedia_si/nmnh/origin.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Topper (archaeological site)|Topper]] in the state of [[South Carolina]], U.S.A. dated 16,000–20,000 years BP,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&amp;context=sciaa_staffpub|title = Evidence of Pre-Clovis Sites in the Eastern United States|date = 1 January 2005|accessdate = 20 January 2015|website = Scholar Commons|publisher = University of South Carolina|last = Goodyear|first = Albert C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Meadowcroft Rockshelter]] located near [[Avella, Pennsylvania|Avella]] in [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]] in southwestern [[Pennsylvania]], United States, dated to 16,000 years BP, have also raised doubts about the "Clovis First" theory.

The mainstream view of the peopling of the Americas, also known as the ''short chronology theory,'' is that the first movement beyond [[Alaska]] into the New World occurred no earlier than 15,000 – 17,000 years ago, followed by successive waves of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080313-first-americans.html |title=Chaw joins poop in archaeology arsenal |work=University of Wisconsin }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to American History|first=Alan |last=Axelrod|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=prdgVZaIIiAC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=Chukchi%20people%20first%20americans&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true|publisher=Alpha Books|year=2003|isbn=0-02-864464-6|accessdate=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pedra Furada provides potential evidence for the proponents of the ''long chronology theory,'' which states that the first group of people entered the hemisphere at a much earlier date, possibly 21,000–40,000 years ago,&lt;ref name="parkscan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|work=Government of Canada|publisher=Parks Canada|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/pfa-fap/sec1.aspx|year=2009|accessdate=9 January 2010|quote=Canada's oldest known home is a cave in Yukon occupied not 12,000 years ago like the U.S. sites, but at least 20,000 years ago|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424103401/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/docs/r/pfa-fap/sec1.aspx|archivedate=24 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vuntut"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pleistocene Archaeology of the Old Crow Flats|publisher=Vuntut National Park of Canada|url=http://yukon.taiga.net/vuntutrda/archaeol/info.htm|year=2008|accessdate=10 January 2010|quote=However, despite the lack of this conclusive and widespread evidence, there are suggestions of human occupation in the northern Yukon about 24,000 years ago, and hints of the presence of humans in the Old Crow Basin as far back as about 40,000 years ago.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022085345/http://yukon.taiga.net/vuntutrda/archaeol/info.htm|archivedate=22 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a much later mass secondary wave of immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Atlas of the Human Journey |url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html?era=e003 |work=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/journey/|title=Journey of mankind|work=Brad Shaw Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This evidence is considered controversial and not widely accepted by experts in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1521376/Pedra-Furada|title = Pedra Furada|date = |accessdate = 20 January 2015|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.sfu.museum/journey/an-en/postsecondaire-postsecondary/pedra_furada|title = Pedra Furada|date = 2005|accessdate = 20 January 2015|website = Journey To A New Land|publisher = SFU Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A caribou bone used as a scraper, found at the [[Old Crow Flats]] site in Canada was thought to be 27,000 years old in the 1970s was used to support the ''long chronology theory''.

==Controversy==
[[File:Serra da Capivara - Painting 3.JPG|thumb|Painting from the site]]

Debate continues as to whether or not the [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and [[Hearths#Archaeological features|hearths]] are instead [[geofact]]s that were made naturally, or alternatively, made by monkeys. Wild bearded capuchin monkeys (''[[Black-striped capuchin|Sapajus libidinosus]]'') in Serra da Capivara National Park have been observed smashing stones against rocks embedded in the ground. The resulting 'shaped' rocks and flakes are similar to early hominid tools and flakes. It has been suggested that similar behavior, by earlier simians, might account for what have been regarded as human tools at Pedra Furada. [[James M. Adovasio|James Adovasio]] of [[Florida Atlantic University]] believes that the tools identified by Guidon as human made are rocks that fell from a cliff and broke when they hit the ground. “The Pedra Furada stuff is not even up to capuchin standards,” he said. (The capuchin behavior also has implications for interpretations of the simplest [[Oldowan]] technology in East African).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Kate|title=Whose Tools Are These?|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/monkeys-make-stone-ldquo-tools-rdquo-that-bear-a-striking-resemblance-to-early-human-artifacts/|journal=Scientific American|language=en|volume=316|issue=1|pages=10–12|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0117-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wild-monkeys-stone-tools-force-a-rethink-of-human-uniqueness/|title=Wild Monkeys' Stone "Tools" Force a Rethink of Human Uniqueness|last=Wong|first=Kate|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/wild-monkeys-unintentionally-make-stone-age-tools-180960837/|title=Wild Monkeys Unintentionally Make Stone Age Tools, But Don't See the Point|last=Handwerk|first=Brian|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Proffitt|first=Tomos|last2=Luncz|first2=Lydia V.|last3=Falótico|first3=Tiago|last4=Ottoni|first4=Eduardo B.|last5=Torre|first5=Ignacio de la|last6=Haslam|first6=Michael|date=3 November 2016|title=Wild monkeys flake stone tools|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature20112|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=539|issue=7627|pages=85–88|doi=10.1038/nature20112|issn=1476-4687|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be a dividing line on the debate among archaeologists disputing Guidon's theory that the site's artifacts prove pre-Clovis human settlement in the Americas.

In 2000 the controversy was characterized by Alex Bellos, at ''[[The Guardian]],'' as U.S. archaeologists believe that the items are geofacts created naturally, "because the North Americans cannot believe that they do not have the oldest site", while David Meltzer, of the Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas asks "...if we have [pre-Clovis] humans in South America, then by golly, why don't we have them in North America too?" 

Responding to this Guidon suggested a sea voyage across the Atlantic as a potential route for the first migration.&lt;ref name="bellos"/&gt;  

In an article in the ''[[New York Times]]'' Guidon claimed occupation of the Americas could go back 100,000 years and the first settlers 'might have come not overland from Asia but by boat from Africa'.&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

[[Michael R. Waters]], a [[Geoarchaeology|geoarchaeologist]] at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] noted the absence of genetic evidence in modern populations to support Guidon's claim.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/world/americas/discoveries-challenge-beliefs-on-humans-arrival-in-the-americas.html|title=Discoveries Challenge Beliefs on Humans’ Arrival in the Americas|last=Romero|first=Simon|date=2014-03-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Buttermilk Creek Complex]] in Texas was discovered in 2006 and dated at about 15,500 BP. &lt;ref&gt; [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6024/1599], “Science” &lt;/ref&gt; 

Then, in 2017 a hearth excavated on [[Triquet Island]] off British Columbia was determine to be 14,000 years old, making it one of the oldest human settlements ever discovered in North America and bolstering the Pacific [[Coastal Migration]] route hypothosis.&lt;ref&gt; [https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/one-oldest-north-american-settlements-found-180962750/], “Smithsonian” &lt;/ref&gt;

Guidon has said that, "The carbon is not from a natural fire. It is only found inside the sites. You don't get natural fires inside the shelters."&lt;ref name="bellos"&gt;[http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/pedrafurada.html "Brazilian Findings Spark Archeological Debate" by Alex Bellos]&lt;/ref&gt; French [[palaeolithic]] archaeologist Jacques Pelegrin, believes there is a possibility for natural processes creating flaked stones that could mimic the Pedra Furada specimens because of their simplicity, but he finds this very unlikely in this case because of continuous human presence in the site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14619834.000-stones-of-contention.html David Meltzer, "Stones of contention"], ''New Scientist''&lt;/ref&gt;

PS: Political Science &amp; Politics, p. 646-647.&lt;/ref&gt;

Converse studied for a time in France before returning to the United States to earn an M.A. in sociology at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1956, followed by a Ph.D. in social psychology at Michigan in 1958.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; As he began his graduate education, Converse worked as the assistant study director of Michigan's Survey Research Center, joining forces with Warren Miller and Angus Campbell to field the 1956-1960 National Election Study panel survey.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; That work produced the foundational text for political behavior, ''The American Voter'' (1960). He would serve in leadership roles for the Center and for the broader Institute for Social Research (ISR) in which it was housed for the rest of his career, including as director of the Center for Political Studies (1981-1986) and director of ISR itself (1986-1989).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1961, Converse married social scientist Jean G. McDowell, an expert in interviewing techniques who directed the Detroit Area Study.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Converse became an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Michigan in 1960, the same year as his co-authored seminal treatise ''The American Voter'' was published.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; He quickly earned tenure with promotion to associate professor in 1964, as his celebrated essay on belief systems was published.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; One year later, he was promoted to the rank of full professor in sociology and a joint appointment in political science.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; After being awarded two named chair positions in the 1970s and 1980s, Converse was selected as the 1987 Henry Russel Lecturer, the University's highest honor given to a senior faculty member.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt;

Converse left the University of Michigan to become director of the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences at [[Stanford University]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=":04"/&gt; He returned to the University of Michigan as an emeritus professor of sociology and political science in 1994.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Philip Converse died December 30, 2014, in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], at the age of 86.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; He was survived by his wife, Jean, and his two sons.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Research ==
Converse is best known for his work on ideology and belief systems, voters and elections, partisanship, political representation, party systems, the human meaning of social change, and political sophistication.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; His work drew on extensive public opinion survey data from the United States and France.

=== "The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics" (1964) ===
In "The Nature of Belief Systems in Mass Publics," Converse challenged the notion that ordinary citizens share the sophisticated ideological structure in political thinking seen among political elites. He argues first that belief systems are ultimately about "constraint"—if one's view changes on an issue central to the belief system, that change shifts attitudes throughout the network of other views when constraint is high. In contrast, other views do not change in a low-constraint belief system when another attitude changes. Converse says belief systems are constructed by political elites, who decide the issue views that go together, and he says political information is key for determining whether members of the mass public are capable of following these connections in their own thinking.

Next, Converse empirically analyzes belief systems in the mass public using survey data from the 1956-58-60 [[American National Election Studies|American National Election Study]]. He proceeds in four parts. In the first section, he shows that, when asked to describe their views on the political parties and candidates, very few Americans rely on abstract principles or other signs of ideological thinking ("ideologues"). Instead, the largest category of people think about politics and parties in terms of "group benefits" based on which prominent social groups they see as advantaged or disadvantaged by Democrats or Republicans. Others thought about parties based on the "nature of the times" or "no issue content." In sum, regular people don't talk about politics in ideological ways.

In the second section, Converse shows that when Americans are asked explicitly to explain the terms "liberal" and "conservative," many struggle to link those terms to the political parties and to give meaningful reasons for those pairings. This suggests a lack of ideological understanding and again pushed against the notion of an ideological public. In the third section, Converse presents evidence that issue preferences in the public show low constraint, as seen in low correlations between issue pairs. This stands in contrast to relatively high constraint observed in the views of political elites. Finally, Converse shows that political attitudes are highly unstable in the mass public over time. On some issues, the public provides such inconsistent responses over two and four years that they appear to be responding almost as if at random. If ordinary people had idiosyncratic belief systems, he argues their views would be stable over time. The instability he observes is the final strike against the notion of an ideologically sophisticated public.

Converse concludes that mass publics generally lack the structured belief systems seen in political elites, and he speculates that this finding from mid-century America applies broadly across publics in other places and eras.

In a 1970 essay, Converse calls these highly unstable political views "non-attitudes."&lt;ref&gt;Converse, P.E. 1970. Attitudes and non-attitudes: continuation of a dialogue. In: (E.R. Tufte, ed.), ''The quantitative analysis of social problems''. Addison-Wesley, Mass.&lt;/ref&gt;

Converse's book ''Political Representation in France'' with Roy Pierce on mass politics in France draws similar conclusions about belief systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674187887|title=Political Representation in France — Philip E. Converse, Roy Pierce {{!}} Harvard University Press|website=www.hup.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[The American Voter|''The American Voter'' (1960)]] ===
Converse also co-authored ''[[The American Voter]]'' with [[Angus Campbell (psychologist)|Angus Campbell]], [[Warren Miller (political scientist)|Warren Miller]], and Donald Stokes. The book is one of the earliest and most influential assessments of electoral behavior in political science. One of the book's primary contributions was the introduction of the social-psychological concept of partisan identity and investigations into its effects on political behavior. Partisanship, they say, is functions more as an attachment to a social group than as a mere summary of political values and attitudes, and it is the fundamental driver in vote choice and much else. This theory became known as the [[Michigan Model]]. They also find that citizens who choose not to identify with a political party are generally disengaged from politics and low in political knowledge, in contrast to idealized views celebrating the independent voter. Evidence for the book was drawn from analysis of the 1956-68 [[National Election Studies]] panel. ''[[The American Voter]]'' also assesses factors that influence voter turnout, the influence of electoral rules, effects from social and economic conditions, the roles of group identity and socio-economic position, and it introduces some of the initial analysis that underlies Converse's 1964 "Nature of Belief Systems" essay.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The book also introduces other important concepts like the "funnel of causality" modeling the long-term and short-term forces leading eventually to an individual's vote, and the "normal vote" model relating partisanship and turnout in election outcomes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3865">"'''Pornoviolence'''" is an essay by American author [[Tom Wolfe]]. It first appeared under a longer title in the July 1967 issue of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine,&lt;ref name=esquire&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|title=Pause, Now, and Consider Some Tentative Conclusions About the Meaning of This Mass Perversion Called Porno-Violence: What It Is and Where It Came from and Who Put the Hair on the Walls|journal=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=July 1967|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later published in the collection ''[[Mauve Gloves &amp; Madmen, Clutter &amp; Vine]]''.&lt;ref name=mauve&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfe|first=Tom|author-link=Tom Wolfe|title=[[Mauve Gloves &amp; Madmen, Clutter &amp; Vine]]|publisher=[[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]]|location=New York|isbn=0374204241|pages=178–187|chapter=Pornoviolence|year=1976|lccn=76043968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essay introduced the term "pornoviolence" in reference to graphic written or audiovisual depictions of violence, which Wolfe argued were used in newspapers, magazines, and film to stimulate prurient audience interest.

The essay was intended to decry the media's habit of glorifying violence as a way of gratifying their audience, in the same way a [[pornographic film]] does using sex. Aside from attacking [[popular culture]], such as the articles of ''[[The National Enquirer]]'' and its imitators, Wolfe also levels his criticism at more mainstream art, including [[Truman Capote]]'s controversial [[non-fiction novel]] ''[[In Cold Blood]]''. He argues that, in the absence of mystery and the unpredictable, Capote's book retains the audience's attention with the promise of disclosing gruesome details about the [[true crime]] it discusses, thus degenerating the work to the level of sadistic sensationalism, or, indeed, pornoviolence.

"Pornoviolence" as a term has subsequently been used to disparage excessively violent content in books, horror films, and video games.&lt;ref name=kingdanse&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen|title=[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]|publisher=Everest House|location=New York|isbn=9780896960763|page=132|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hoberman&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Hoberman | first = J. | authorlink =  | editor-first = Jeffrey H. | editor-last = Goldstein | editor-link = Jeffrey H.

A '''prank call''' (also known as a '''crank call''', '''phony call''' or '''hoax call''') is a telephone [[practical joke]]. Prank phone calls began to gain a worldwide following since the invention of telephones, as they became a staple of the obscure and amusing [[cassette tape]]s traded among musicians, [[sound engineer]]s, and media traders beginning in the late 1970s. Among the most famous and earliest recorded prank calls are the [[Tube Bar prank calls]] tapes, which centered on [[Louis "Red" Deutsch]]. Comedian [[Jerry Lewis]] was an incorrigible phone prankster, and recordings of his hijinks, dating from the 1960s and possibly earlier, still circulate to this day.

Very prominent people have fallen victim to prank callers, for example [[Elizabeth II]], who was fooled by Canadian DJ [[Pierre Brassard]] posing as Canadian Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]], asking her to record a speech in support of Canadian unity ahead of the [[1995 Quebec referendum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | author2= | title=Hoaxing: A national pastime | date=2000-01-25 |publisher=BBC | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/618065.stm | work =BBC News | accessdate = 2007-09-15 | quote = In 1995, Canadian DJ Pierre Brassard got through to [[Buckingham Palace]] pretending to be Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien. He chatted to the Queen for 15 minutes on air – eliciting a promise that she would try to influence [[Quebec]]'s [[referendum]] on proposals to break away from Canada – and she never realised it was a hoax.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other notable examples of prank calls were made by the Miami-based radio station [[WLZL|Radio El Zol]]. In one, they telephoned Venezuelan president [[Hugo Chávez]], and spoke to him pretending to be Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Chavez falls for Castro hoax | date=2003-01-08 &lt;!-- 02:57 GMT --&gt; | publisher=BBC | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2637395.stm | work =BBC News | accessdate = 2007-09-15 | quote = A radio station in the American state of Florida Hasplayed a practical joke on President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela with a hoax phone call he believed was from his friend and ally, the Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Two presenters at Radio El Zol, in Miami, called Mr. Chavez on a private line and used taped extracts of Mr Castro's voice to make him think it was the communist leader himself on the phone.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later reversed the prank, calling Castro and pretending to be Chávez. Castro began swearing at the pranksters live on air after they revealed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/fidel/transcript.htm|title=Transcript of Castro's prank call|first=Tony de la|last=Cova|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anonymity ==
Prank callers can now be easily found through [[Caller ID]], so it is often asserted that since the 1990s, prank calls have been harder to accomplish and thus waning in popularity.&lt;ref name="vanishing"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/06/14/the-vanishing-underappreciated-prank-call/yNo0aIoOo5yXeadKt8EmsI/story.html|title=The vanishing, underappreciated prank call - The Boston Globe|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most telephone companies permit callers to withhold the identifying information from calls using the [[vertical service code]] [[*67]] that blocks the caller's ID (141 in the UK), but potential victims may be reluctant to answer a call from an ID-blocked number.&lt;ref name="vanishing" /&gt; [[Wiretapping]] by several governments have also made prank calls easier to trace. Callers can also call from [[payphones]] in order to hide their identity, although this is becoming less common as pay phones are beginning to phase out starting in the late 2000s. The advent and advancements in digital switching technologies such as those found in [[Signalling System No. 7|SS7]], unspoofable [[Automatic number identification|ANI]], as well as outbound and inbound calls being logged at [[telephone exchange|carrier exchange]] equipment, further complicate the pranksters will to remain anonymous while carrying out such activities.

Another increasingly popular option is to use some form of [[VoIP]]. With some VoIP services, the telephone number will simply not exist. These calls are extremely difficult to trace since they may pass through servers and routers operated by multiple corporations or entities in various countries. Although law enforcement agencies may theoretically be able to find where a [[VoIP]] call originates from if they tried, in practice the amount of time, effort, and resources required would be too great to use on ordinary prank calls.

== Political leaders ==
Sometimes, prank callers are able to connect with political leaders. In December 2005, a commercially operated radio station in Spain ([[COPE (radio station)|COPE]] – owned by a series of institutions affiliated with the Catholic Church) played a prank on Bolivian president-elect [[Evo Morales]]. The hoaxster pretended to be Spanish Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero]], congratulating Morales on his election&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.quepasa.com/english/news/latinamerica/Zapatero.Morales.prank/406542.html |title=Prank call to Evo Morales |access-date=September 10, 2016}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}{{dead link|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saying things like, "I imagine the only one not to have called you was George Bush. I've been here two years and he still hasn't called me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informativos.telecinco.es/cope/zapatero/broma_morales/dn_17521.htm|title=Noticias, última hora en Informativos Telecinco|publisher=|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prank calls and the Internet ==
Ever since the opportunity has been available, there have been multiple internet radio stations dedicated to prank calls. Most of them feature a so-called "rotation" of prank calls, which is a constant broadcast of various prank calls submitted by the community, usually streamed from a [[SHOUTcast]] server host. Software such as [[Ventrilo]] has allowed prank calls to be carried out to a more private user-base, however, in real-time.

The internet has allowed many people to share their own personal prank calls and develop into communities. Prank calls can be carried out in many ways; live or pre-recorded. Sites such as [[Stickam]] and [[Ustream]] allow hosts to carry out prank calls live to thousands of listeners, who can also chat and discuss on-goings in real-time. The use of [[social networking]] and the popularity of [[user generated content]] also allows these prank calls to spread and popularity to grow. 

== Legal issues ==
Some prank calls are criminalized in many jurisdictions, for instance if the call involves calling the emergency services, while others may be protected as [[freedom of expression]].  For example, in the US, for a prank call to fall afoul of the Telecommunications Act, {{uscsub|47|223|a|1}}, the call must be done with the intent to "abuse, threaten, or harass". In Australia, the 2Day FM incident is alleged by ACMA to have violated Australian law, but on the grounds that the recorded call was publicly broadcast without the other party's consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=India-born nurse's death: Watchdog finds radio station guilty | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-09-20/other-news/42251296_1_radio-station-mel-greig-jacintha-saldanha | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130927161026/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-09-20/other-news/42251296_1_radio-station-mel-greig-jacintha-saldanha | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2013-09-27 | work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rudimentary criminal 'pranks' may range from simple [[telephone harassment]] to [[bomb threats]]. One such hoax call occurred in [[Perth]], Western Australia, on New Year's Eve 2002, when a drunk teenager called the new anti-terrorist hot line to report a bomb threat against the New Year's Eve fireworks celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ag.gov.au/agd/WWW/attorneygeneralHome.nsf/Page/Media_Releases_2003_January_2003_WA_man_charged_over_hoax_hotline_call_(1_January_2003) |title= Perth, Australia bomb threat hoax |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504182614/http://www.ag.gov.au/agd/WWW/attorneygeneralHome.nsf/Page/Media_Releases_2003_January_2003_WA_man_charged_over_hoax_hotline_call_(1_January_2003) |archivedate=May 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The threat was taken seriously, and the celebrations were about to be cancelled when police discovered that no such threat existed. The teenager was then arrested for the false report.

More elaborate pranks rely on tricking the recipient into harmful behavior. An example of these was the 1996–2004 [[strip search phone call scam]], in which a prankster posing as a police officer was able to cause store managers to [[strip search]] female employees. More recently, the [[Pranknet]] [[virtual community]] has been credited for causing tens of thousands of dollars in damage to many hotels and [[fast food restaurant]]s. Posing as [[Authority|authority figures]], such as [[fire alarm]] company representatives and hotel corporate managers, Pranknet participants called unsuspecting employees and customers in the United States via [[Skype]] and tricked them into damaging property, setting off [[fire sprinkler]]s and other humiliating acts such as disrobing. They also post fraudulent ads on [[Craigslist]], and then shout racial epithets and make violent threats of rape and murder against the people who call them to respond to the ads. Pranknet members listen in real-time and discuss the progress together in a private [[chat room]]. The group, who flaunted their anonymity, were outed when editors of ''[[The Smoking Gun]]'', posing as journalists, persuaded them to visit unique URLs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2009/0803091pranknet1.html Telephone Terrorist] The Smoking Gun, August 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of prank calls by Joseph Sherer led to convictions and a twenty-year prison sentence for impersonating a physician, criminal endangerment, and [[aggravated assault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2000-01-21/news/0001201213_1_mutilation-mclane-bozeman|title=Caller Prompted Mutilation, Police Say |newspaper=Sun-Sentinel |location=Ft. Lauderdale |date=2000-01-21|author=Andreas Tzortzis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://billingsgazette.com/news/local/defendant-sentenced-to-years/article_b6c9b824-2769-594b-9b15-f9cd3cf2ed57.html|title=Defendant sentenced to 20 years |newspaper=Billings Gazette|date=2000-11-15|author=The Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one call, as described by the [[Montana Supreme Court]], "Sherer, impersonating a sympathetic and caring doctor, instructed the victim to cut off her nipple. The victim's obedient actions flowed directly from Sherer's instructions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/mt-supreme-court/1314983.html|title=STATE of Montana, Plaintiff and Respondent, v. Joseph SHERER, Defendant and Appellant. No. 01-191.|publisher=FindLaw|date=December 20, 2002|author=Supreme Court of Montana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until his death in 2011, Oklahoma construction worker Frank Garrett was prank called and recorded countless times for his vitriolic reactions. The [[Soundboard (computer program)|soundboard]] community that followed him caused at least three known incidents with the law: two in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] and a third in [[Houston]]; both were for threats of violence against residents and the police with his name being used in the process. Both incidents were covered by local [[FOX News]] stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|title=Frank Garrett (Aka Duncan) has died July 3, 2011|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmb5775DLGQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.examiner.net/article/20100223/NEWS/302239712|last=Glover|first=Michael|title=Angry, threatening calls alarm Sugar Creek|date=February 23, 2010|accessdate=January 22, 2014|publisher=[[GateHouse Media]]|newspaper=[[The Examiner (Missouri)|The Examiner]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202104541/http://www.myfoxhouston.com/story/18232189/caller-threatens-to-blow-up-hpd|url=http://www.myfoxhouston.com/story/18232189/caller-threatens-to-blow-up-hpd|title=Caller Threatens to Blow Up HPD|date=April 26, 2011| accessdate=January 22, 2014|archivedate=February 2, 2014|publisher=[[KRIV (TV)|Fox 26 News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pulley|first=Mary|title=Man makes repeated threatening, obscene phone calls to people in Independence|url=http://fox4kc.com/2014/12/08/woman-worried-by-threatening-obscene-phone-calls-made-to-her-home/|publisher=[[WDAF-TV|Fox 4KC]]|date=December 9, 2014|accessdate=September 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{Main|Suicide of Jacintha Saldanha}}

In 2012, Jacintha Saldanha, a nurse at [[King Edward VII's Hospital Sister Agnes|King Edward VII hospital]] who was attending a pregnant [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]], was deceived into transferring a prank call from [[Mel Greig]] and [[Mike Christian]], the hosts of the ''[[Hot30 Countdown]]'' radio program broadcast on [[2Day FM]] in Sydney, Australia, who were impersonating [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]. The hoaxsters were able to ask the duty nurse questions about the duchess' health, making the answers public. Saldanha was later found dead in a suspected suicide. The incident and the following death received intense media coverage and triggered an investigation, but no charges were laid.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9731359/Cruel-hospital-hoax-still-playing-on-radio.html |title='Cruel' hospital hoax still playing on radio|author=Gordon Rayner |work=The Daily Telegraph |date= 8 December 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20130202StuffCoNz&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/europe/8254302/No-charges-for-royal-hoaxters |title=No charges for royal hoaxters |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=2 February 2013 | accessdate=2 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prank calls frequently appear in many earlier episodes of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', as [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] calls [[Moe's Tavern]] asking for people whose names are actually double entendres. Examples include "Mike Rotch" (my crotch), "Bea O'Problem" ([[Body odor|B.O.]] problem), "Al Coholic" (alcoholic), "Amanda Hugginkiss" (a man to hug and kiss), and "Anita Bath" (I need a bath). [[Moe Szyslak|Moe]] then asks his clientele if the person is present, embarrassing himself in the process. However, in the episode "[[Flaming Moe's]]", Bart's prank call backfires when he calls up asking for a "Hugh Jass" (huge ass), only for a man with the same name to answer. And in "[[Donnie Fatso]]", [[Fat Tony (The Simpsons)|Fat Tony]] accidentally calls Moe asking for his business partner, "Yuri Nator" (urinator).

[["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s song "Phony Calls" (a parody of "[[Waterfalls (TLC song)|Waterfalls]]" by [[TLC (group)|TLC]], featured on his 1996 album ''[[Bad Hair Day]]'') deals with prank phone calls. Specifically, it talks about the "Is your refrigerator running?" gag and the "Do you have Prince Albert in a can?" gag. It also incorporates Bart Simpson's aforementioned "Mike Rotch" prank phone call. 

On an episode of ''[[Pee-Wee's Playhouse]]'', the mischievous Randy makes a prank call (the classic "Is your refrigerator running? Then you better catch it!" gag) and talks Pee-Wee into doing so also. The recipient of the call is irritated and gets her husband on the phone, who happens to be a police officer. The officer sternly warns Pee-Wee that making prank calls is against the law and that it can result in going to jail and a lifetime criminal record.

The [[Cartoon Network]] series ''[[Regular Show]]'' featured an episode centered around prank calls in its first season, entitled "Prank Callers". Inspired by watching online videos of the "world's best prank caller", the show's protagonists, Mordecai and Rigby, attempt to make several prank calls of their own. After the two fail to prank the world's best prank caller, they are sent back in time to 1982, and are later joined by the rest of the show's main cast. The episode then focuses on the group's efforts to return to their proper time period, by pranking the aforementioned prank caller. in the episode entitled "House Rules" Benson decrees a series of dubious rules. one of which forbids the use of making prank calls, causing Mordecai and Rigby to abandon him of their own free will. Later on, Mordecai receives a prank call(the classic, but derogatory "Loser says what?" prank). Mordecai attempts to dismiss the caller, but inadvertently falls for it.

In John Carpenter's spooky thriller, ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'', during the scene when [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] appears before Lynda while disguising himself as her boyfriend, Bob, in a ghost costume, and she teases him before calling Laurie, during which Michael strangles her, Laurie thinks it's just Annie making another prank call. 

Prank calls are common in morning radio talk shows with a comedy theme, radio broadcasts a Carmen Prank Call will occur, where "Carmen" calls random people and annoys them to the point of them hanging up, irritated, once, and after a second call, twice. Prank calls are generally done for the amusement of the pranksters (and their listening audiences). Some performers such as [[The Jerky Boys]], [[Tom Mabe]] and [[Roy D. Mercer]] made a name for themselves producing albums of their recorded prank calls.

The [[Nickelodeon]] series ''[[Spongebob SquarePants]]'' features an episode in which SpongeBob is distracted by a prank call, before realizing he could fly as a result of his hair dryer being stuck in his pants. SpongeBob receives a prank call from someone asking for "The Birdman of Bikini Bottom", before asking SpongeBob if he lived in a birdcage, annoying him to the point of asking him who's calling him, before being given a joke name (The Classic "Joe Mama" gag), before SpongeBob admonishes the caller and hangs up.

[[Sal "the Stockbroker" Governale]] and [[Richard Christy]], writers on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', have made various prank calls to [[public access]] shows, [[talk radio]], radio stations, and normal people at home. They also have a fictional radio show called the "Jack and Rod show" where they call a major celebrity for an interview and prank them with sound effects or fake guests such as [[Bruce Morrow|Cousin Brucie]] (where Howard imitates a famous radio host while using an exaggerated version of his signature speech patterns) and many other pranks.

The television show ''[[Crank Yankers]]'' is a series of real-life prank calls made by celebrities and re-enacted on-screen by [[puppet]]s for a humorous effect.

''[[Fonejacker]]'', a show started on April 5, 2007 on [[E4 (channel)|E4]], stars [[Kayvan Novak]] performing prank calls to the general public and being shown with animated pictures in a [[Monty Python]] style with their mouths moving and live recordings as the victim receives the call.

Beginning in early 2011, the image board [[4chan]] organized a prank calling of the Gold and Silver Pawn Shop in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], location of the popular television show ''[[Pawn Stars]]''. The callers repeatedly asked the employees if they sold ''[[Battletoads]]'', a video game for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] notorious for its difficulty. This call led Rick, star of ''Pawn Stars'' and owner of the store, to repeatedly swear and yell at the prank callers. The 4chan callers recorded this and uploaded it to [[YouTube]], and subsequently many videos related to prank callers dialing random establishments and asking about ''Battletoads'' have been uploaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ReadyToPrank|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpmWNpUZmcA|website=YouTube|publisher=ReadyToPrank|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=PrankCallsByReV|title=Prank Call ReV Calls (Pawn Stars) Rick Harrison Cellphone # "Battletoads"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ3yTVkL7bQ|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prank Website|url=https://www.ownagepranks.com|website=OwnagePranks|publisher=OwnagePranks|accessdate=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Queremos Galego''' or '''Plataforma Queremos Galego!''' ([[English language|English]]: ''We want Galician!'') is a citizen platform and [[social movement]], consisting of 600 entities from different areas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/a/queremosgalego.org/queremos-galego/listaxe_asociacions|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520120224/http://sites.google.com/a/queremosgalego.org/queremos-galego/listaxe_asociacions|dead-url=yes|archive-date=20 May 2010|title=4- Listaxe apoios colectivos (Queremos Galego)|date=20 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by people individually, that was born in 2009 to articulate a collective response in defense of the [[Galician language]], its public use and the linguistic rights of the Galician-speaking population. The main actions of the platform are [[Protest|demonstrations]] and public acts.

'''''Return of the Blind Dead''''', also known as '''''Return of the Evil Dead''''' and '''''El ataque de los muertos sin ojos''''' (translation: ''Attack of the Eyless Dead''), is a 1973 Spanish [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Amando de Ossorio]].

The film is the second in Ossorio's "Blind Dead" series, and the sequel to ''[[Tombs of the Blind Dead]]'' (1972). It was followed by ''[[The Ghost Galleon]]'' (1974).

==Plot==
The film opens with a flashback to 13th century Bouzano, Portugal. A peasant mob has captured the [[Knights Templar]] and is preparing to burn them for witchcraft and murder. One of the captured knights (Luis Barboo) swears revenge on the village. The villagers (in a break from the first film) burn the knights' eyes out with torches before burning them to death.

The film flashes ahead to the present, where the village prepares for a festival celebrating the 500th anniversary of the defeat of the Templars. The village idiot, Murdo ([[José Canalejas (actor)|José Canalejas]]), watches the preparations until being attacked and stoned by a pack of children. The children are run off by Moncha (Loreta Tovar) and Juan (José Thelman), romantically involved locals.

Back in the town square, firework technician and former military captain Jack Marlowe ([[Tony Kendall (actor)|Tony Kendall]]) meets Mayor Duncan ([[Fernando Sancho]]), his assistant Dacosta (Ramón Lillo) and his fiancee/secretary Vivian ([[Esperanza Roy]]). It is revealed that Jack and Vivian have a personal history, establishing a tension between the four characters. Jack and Vivian take a walk, where she reveals that she purposely hired Jack to rekindle their romance. Their walk takes them to the abbey graveyard where the Templars are buried. Their romantic interlude is interrupted by peeping Murdo, who proceeds to warn them of the Templars' impending return. After Jack and Vivian depart, Murdo murders a young townswoman that he has kidnapped as a blood sacrifice.

While the festival is in full swing, the Templars rise, awakened by Murdo's sacrifice. At the festival, Jack convinces Vivian to leave with him. Their interactions raise the ire of Duncan and Dacosta, who are a keeping a close eye on the pair.

Back at the graveyard, the Templars ride down Murdo (but leave him alive) and head toward town. On their way, they come across Moncha's house, where she is in the midst of a sexual rendezvous with Juan. Juan is killed but Moncha escapes on an undead Templar horse. She stops for help at the rail station, where she persuades the station manager ([[Francisco Sanz]]) of the danger by revealing her zombie horse. She runs off, as he tries to call the mayor.

While the phone rings in his office, the mayor dispatches Dacosta and his henchmen to assault Jack. The beating is finally interrupted when the call from the station manager gets through. The mayor is skeptical, and believes the manager to be drunk. He sends Dacosta to the station to take over. The Templars arrive at the station and kill the manager.

Meanwhile, Jack and Vivian leave in Jack's car. They encounter the traumatized Moncha in the middle of the road and bring her back to town. Dacosta and another of Duncan's goons, Beirao (Ramón Lillo), encounter the knights as they approach the train station. They hurry back to the village and warn the mayor of the oncoming horde.

The mayor calls the governor (Juan Cazalilla) to request help, but his pleas fall on deaf ears as the governor assumes Duncan to be drunk and reprimands him. The governor is the third person (after the station manager, and then the mayor) to ignore warnings of the coming Templars, assuming the messenger to be drunk.

The knights descend on the village and the festival turns into a massacre. Jack organizes Dacosta and some of the villagers into a defense force, as Duncan scrambles to gather his valuables and then looks on from the balcony. Eventually, Jack and Dacosta clear an escape for most of the villagers. Jack, Vivian, Dacosta, Moncha and Duncan are all left behind. They try to get away in Jack's car, but are overwhelmed by zombies and escape into the church, where Beirao and his wife Amalia ([[Lone Fleming]]), are holed up with their daughter (Maria Nuria). Once inside the church, the group finds Murdo hiding out.

The survivors begin fortifying the church against the undead siege, but before long, unity begins to erode. After failing once again to convince the governor of their plight, Duncan persuades Beirao to make a break for the car. He is killed in the attempt. Meanwhile, Murdo persuades Moncha to come with him into the tunnels beneath the church to escape. After Beirao's failed attempt, Duncan tries to escape using Beirao and Amalia's young daughter as bait. He is killed and the child is left in grave peril among the Templars. Jack and Amalia manage to save her, with Amalia sacrificing her own life in the process.

Down in the tunnels, Murdo is decapitated by the knights as he climbs out to the surface and Moncha is subsequently pulled by her head through the opening and killed.

Back in the church, Dacosta catches Vivian alone. Resigned to a grim fate, he attempts to rape her before the Templars kill him. Jack rescues Vivian, and Dacosta is impaled on a spear in the ensuing scuffle.

As the night wears on, Jack and Vivian decide to chance escaping. They convince Amalia's daughter that the zombies and her mother's death were both part of a nightmare and then blindfold her as they attempt to silently creep through the square full of blind dead. As they slip past the Knights, the little girl peeks out of her blindfold and screams as she sees the zombies surrounding them. However, the Templars make no move, and then crumple to the ground in the breaking morning light. Jack, Vivian and the child walk away from the village as the credits roll.

==Production==
As in the other three films in the series, de Ossorio wrote, directed and designed the Templar make-up for the film &lt;ref&gt;Burrell, Nigel. Knights of Terror: The Blind Dead Films of Amando de Ossorio. 2005 Revised Edition. England, UK: midnight media publishing, 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  and composer Anton Garcia Gabril scored it.

Ossorio characterized the financing and production of the film as "very difficult... very complicated", and claimed he had never been paid by the distributor.&lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;Alexander, Chris, and Trevor Barley.  "Lord of the Blind Dead."  Rue Morgue Sept. 2005: 24-29.  Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle shooting location for the festival scenes and the church exterior was the Plaza de la Iglesia located in the pueblo of [[El Vellon]] in [[Madrid]], Spain.

==Themes==
De Ossorio described the film as having "political aspects", evidenced by the mayor who looks to abandon the town and save himself when the Templars attack.&lt;ref name="Alexander"/&gt;

Author and critic Jamie Russell described the thematic link between sex and death in the films as "a pessimistic vision in which youth and beauty are always destroyed". Russell asserted that "sex becomes nothing more than prelude...that brings us ever closer to the final end", and that "flesh is simply a reminder of our own mortality".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Jamie. Book of the Dead: The Complete History of Zombie Cinema. 4th Edition. England, UK: Fab Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
There are multiple cuts of the film. The uncut Spanish language version, ''El ataque de los muertos sin ojos'', runs over four minutes longer than the international English-language cut, ''Return of the Evil Dead'', and contains longer, more explicit gore sequences. The opening of the English cut contains a truncated version of the Templars' blood sacrifice before the villagers capture and kill the knights. In the Spanish version, the sacrifice flashback occurs when Murdo warns Jack and Vivian about the coming return of the Templars, and contains shots of the virgin's heart being removed and eaten by the knights. In the ''Return of the Evil Dead'' cut, Murdo does not sacrifice a local girl to incite the Templars resurrection, and when he's decapitated later in the film, the shot of his headless, spurting neck is removed. Several names are changed and/or Anglicized in the English dub of the film: the village of Bouzano is renamed Berzano, Moncha is Monica, Juan is Don, Dacosta is Howard, Beirao is Bert and Amalia's unnamed daughter is Nancy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16279">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Revelation Space'' universe}}
The '''''Revelation Space'' universe''' is a [[fictional universe]] which was created by [[Alastair Reynolds]] and used as the setting for a number of his [[novel]]s and [[short story|stories]]. Its [[future history|fictional history]] follows the human species through various conflicts from the relatively near future (roughly 2200) to approximately 40,000 [[Anno Domini|AD]] (all the novels to date are set between 2427 and 2727, although certain stories extend beyond this period). It takes its name from ''[[Revelation Space]]'', which was the [[Debut novel|first published novel]] set in the universe.

The name "''Revelation Space'' universe" has been used by Alastair Reynolds in both the introductory text in the collections ''[[Diamond Dogs, Turquoise Days]]'' and ''[[Galactic North]]'', and also on several editions of the novels set in the universe.

==Overview==
The ''Revelation Space'' universe is set in a future version of our world, with the addition of a number of [[races in Revelation Space|extraterrestrial species]] and advanced technologies that are not necessarily grounded in current science.&lt;ref&gt;One example is the "Hades matrix" in ''Revelation Space'': a supercomputer created inside a [[neutron star]], and capable of communicating freely with its own past and future selves.&lt;/ref&gt; It is, nonetheless, somewhat "harder" than most examples of space opera, relying to a considerable extent on science Reynolds believes to be possible; in particular, [[faster-than-light travel]] is largely absent. Reynolds has said he prefers to keep the science in his fiction plausible, but he will adopt science he believes will be impossible when it is necessary for the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6608459.stm |title=Science fiction 'thrives in hi-tech world' |work=[[BBC News Online]] |date=30 April 2007 |quote=I prioritise story over science but not at the expense of being really stupid about it. If there's a story I absolutely cannot tell without faster than light travel then I am quite prepared to accept it — even though I don't personally believe it is possible. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a great deal of science fiction reflects either very optimistic or [[dystopia]]n visions of the human future, the Revelation Space universe is notable in that human societies have not developed to either positive or negative extremes. Instead, despite their dramatically advanced technology, they are similar to those of today in terms of their moral ambiguity and mixture of cruelty and decency, [[political corruption|corruption]] and opportunity.

The ''Revelation Space'' universe contains elements of [[Lovecraftian horror]], with [[List of Revelation Space characters#Dan Sylveste|one posthuman entity]] stating explicitly that some things in the universe are fundamentally beyond human or [[transhuman]] understanding.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Absolution Gap]]'', pages 412–13 in the hardcover version, although many other passages hint at it.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the main storyline is essentially optimistic, with humans continuing to survive even in a universe that seems fundamentally hostile to intelligent life.&lt;ref&gt;From an [http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue406/interview.html interview] with the author: "''Galactic North'' is actually quite optimistic, in my book, because it hints that there will still be thousands of years of good times ahead before things reach a crisis point again. And humanity will survive that, as well, even if it means abandoning the old galaxy. So in a way I think the whole thing's quite cheerily upbeat!"&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Revelation Space" appears in the novel of the same name during Philip Lascaille's account of his visit to Lascaille's Shroud, an anomalous region of the local universe. Lascaille says that "the key" to something momentous "was explained to me [. . .] while I was in Revelation Space."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Revelation Space]]'', Chapter Four: page 98 in the paperback edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
The chronology of the ''Revelation Space'' universe extends to roughly one billion years into the past, when the "Dawn War" — a galaxy-spanning conflict over the availability of various natural resources — resulted in almost all sentient life in the galaxy being wiped out. One race of survivors, later termed the [[Races in Revelation Space#Inhibitors|Inhibitors]], having converted itself to machine form, predicted that the impending [[Andromeda–Milky Way collision]], roughly 3 billion years in our future, may severely damage the capacity of either galaxy to support life. Consequently, they planned to adjust the positions of stars in order to limit the damage the collision would cause. Also central to the Inhibitor project was the eradication of all species above a certain technological level until the crisis was over (as they believed no organic species would be capable of co-operating on such a large-scale project). Whilst they were relatively successful, certain advanced species were able to hide from Inhibitor forces, or even fight back.

In human history, during 21st and 22nd centuries numerous wars occurred, and a flotilla of [[generation ship]]s were deployed to colonise a planet orbiting the star [[61 Cygni]] (this becomes a major segment of the plot of ''[[Chasm City]]''). The flotilla was later to reach a planet termed Sky's Edge, which was to be embroiled in war until human civilisation there was eradicated.

Meanwhile, in the Solar System in 2190, the [[Factions in Revelation Space#Conjoiners|Conjoiners]] emerged as a result of increased experimentation with neural implants. In response, the Coalition for Neural Purity was formed, opposed to the Conjoiners. [[List of Revelation Space characters#Nevil Clavain|Nevil Clavain]] fought on the side of the Coalition in the ensuing war, but defected later on after being betrayed. Clavain, and the Conjoiners, succeeded in escaping the Solar System and left for surrounding stars.

For the next few centuries, the so-called ''Belle Epoque'', humanity enjoyed a period of relative peace and prosperity, with several planets being colonised. The most successful planet of all was [[List of Revelation Space locations#Yellowstone|Yellowstone]], a planet orbiting the star [[Epsilon Eridani]], site of the [[List of Revelation Space locations#Glitter Band / Rust Belt|Glitter Band / Rust Belt]] and [[List of Revelation Space locations#Chasm City|Chasm City]]. Technologies developed included the Conjoiner Drive, a gift from the Conjoiners (who resumed contact with humanity at an unknown time), advanced [[nanotechnology]], and numerous other devices. With the exception of [[the Prefect|an attempted takeover]] of the Glitter Band, no major incidents affected humanity during this time.

The ''Belle Epoque'' was terminated by the advent of the Melding Plague in 2510, a [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] virus that destroyed all other nanotechnology it came into contact with. Only the Conjoiners were unaffected by this disaster, which devastated the civilisation around Yellowstone. War between the [[Factions in Revelation Space#Demarchists|Demarchists]] and Conjoiners erupted as a result of the plague.

Meanwhile, activities around a far-flung human colony on the planet Resurgam, orbiting the star [[Delta Pavonis]], inadvertently attracted the attention of the [[Races in Revelation Space#Inhibitors|Inhibitors]]. The Conjoiners, also made aware of this event, sent Clavain to recover the exceedingly powerful "Cache Weapons" from this system (said weapons having been stolen from the Conjoiners centuries before) that could be used to fend off the Inhibitors while the Conjoiners escaped. Clavain instead defected from the Conjoiners, intending to use the weapons to protect all of humanity. [[List of Revelation Space characters#Skade|Skade]], another Conjoiner, was sent to stop him and recover the weapons. They fought around the Resurgam system, with Clavain and his allies eventually obtaining the weapons. Clavain's ally [[List of Revelation Space characters#Remontoire|Remontoire]] agreed to seek out alien assistance from the Hades Matrix, a nearby alien computer disguised as a neutron star, whilst Clavain sheltered refugees from Resurgam on another planet, later termed Ararat.

Remontoire returned in 2675, only a few days after Clavain's death at the hands of Skade, who had arrived with him. Remontoire and his allies were now at war with the Inhibitors, assisted by alien technology obtained from Hades. Even so, it was realised that the humans would not last indefinitely, and Clavain's people, now led by [[List of Revelation Space characters#Scorpio|Scorpio]] decided to seek out the mysterious "Shadows", a race believed to be near a moon called Hela, site of a [[theocracy]]. Aura, daughter of [[List of Revelation Space characters#Ana Khouri|Ana Khouri]] (an ally of Remontoire) infiltrated the theocracy under the pseudonym [[List of Revelation Space characters#Rashmika Els|Rashmika Els]]. After considerable conflict, Scorpio and Aura realised that contacting the Shadows was inadvisable. They instead contacted the [[Races in Revelation Space#Nestbuilders / Slugs|Nestbuilders]], who provided them with weapons capable of defeating the Inhibitors. As such, the Inhibitors were effectively eradicated from human space, with [[buffer zone]]s and frontiers established to keep them at bay.

Humanity then enjoyed a second, 400-year-long golden age. After this, however, came the [[Galactic North|Greenfly outbreak]], in which human civilisation was destroyed by a rogue [[terraforming]] system of human origin that destroyed planets and converted them to millions of orbiting, vegetation-filled habitats. The Greenfly began to subsume most of human space, with all efforts to stop them failing. The storyline of the Revelation Space universe thus far concludes with humanity leaving the [[Milky Way]] galaxy in an attempt to set up a new civilisation elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Galactic North]]," the short story in the book of the same name&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[architecture]] and [[masonry]], the term '''set-off''' is given to the horizontal line shown on a [[floorplan]] indicating a reduced wall thickness, and consequently the part of the thicker portion appears projecting before the thinner. In [[plinth]]s, this is generally simply chamfered. In other parts of stonework, the set-off is generally concealed by a projecting stringer. Where, as in [[parapet]]s, the upper part projects (is "proud of") the lower, the break is generally hid by a corbel [[Water table (architecture)|watertable]]. The portions of buttress caps which recede one behind another are also called sets-off.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20433">The '''Student and Exchange Visitor Program'''  is a program within  [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], which is under the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]], to manage foreign students and exchange visitors in the United States through the '''Student and Exchange Visitor Information System''' ('''SEVIS''').&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.ice.gov/sevis|title = Student and Exchange Visitor Program|accessdate = January 29, 2017|publisher = [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SEVP encompasses the [[F visa|F status]] (for foreign students in the United States in academic programs and their dependents), [[J-1 visa|J status]] (for exchange visitors in the United States and their dependents), and [[M-1 visa|M status]] (for foreign students in the United States in vocational programs and their dependents). The exchange visitor part of the program (J visa) is managed by the [[U.S. Department of State]], although the SEVIS system is maintained by ICE.&lt;ref name=official/&gt;

Note that SEVP does not manage the issuance of the visas themselves. Visas are issued at United States consulates and embassies in other countries, which fall under the [[U.S. Department of State]]'s Bureau of Consular Affairs. However, having the correct status and information in the SEVIS system is necessary for a person to be able to receive a F, J, or M visa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/study-exchange/student.html|title = Student Visa|publisher = [[U.S. Department of State]] Bureau of Consular Affairs|accessdate = January 29, 2017|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160603231159/https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/study-exchange/student.html|archive-date = June 3, 2016|dead-url = yes|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/study-exchange/exchange.html|title = Exchange Visitor Visa|publisher = [[U.S. Department of State]] Bureau of Consular Affairs|accessdate = January 29, 2017|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170129071309/https://travel.state.gov/content/visas/en/study-exchange/exchange.html|archivedate = January 29, 2017|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that the SEVP does not cover some other statuses that can be used by foreign students in the United States, such as the [[H-4 visa|H-4 status]] and other statuses for dependents of people in non-student statuses.

== History ==

=== Pre-origins: CIPRIS ===

In the [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]], a [[truck bomb]] was detonated below the North Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]]. In the aftermath of this incident, the student visa came under increased scrutiny when it was discovered that [[Eyad Ismoil]], one of the terrorists involved was in the United States on an expired student visa.&lt;ref name="cis1"&gt;{{cite news | last = Suhler | first = Jayne Noble | author2 = Timms, Ed | title = Security worries putting spotlight on student visas | url = http://www.cis.org/articles/Katz/katz1999.html | work = [[The Dallas Morning News]] | date = September 20, 1998 | accessdate = 2007-05-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070512122504/http://www.cis.org/articles/Katz/katz1999.html | archivedate = May 12, 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cis2"&gt;{{cite news | last = Suhler | first = Jayne Noble | author2 = Timms, Ed | title = Cases highlight flaws in federal visa system | url = http://www.cis.org/articles/Katz/katz1999.html | work = [[The Dallas Morning News]] | date = November 8, 1998 | accessdate = 2007-05-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070512122504/http://www.cis.org/articles/Katz/katz1999.html | archivedate = May 12, 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shareok&gt;{{cite web|url = https://shareok.org/bitstream/handle/11244/917/3187222.PDF?sequence=1|title = A Descriptive Case Study of the Impact of 9/11 on International Student Visa Policy in the 20 Months Following the Attacks|author = Mary Helen Reeves|accessdate = February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ins-fsp-report&gt;{{cite web|url = https://oig.justice.gov/special/0205/chapter6.htm|title = CHAPTER SIX. THE INS'S FOREIGN STUDENT PROGRAM|date = May 20, 2002|accessdate = February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memorandum from the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]'s Office of Investigative Agency Policies to the Deputy Attorney General dated September 24, 1994, mentioned the need to subject foreign students to thorough and continuing scrutiny before and during their stay in the United States. On April 17, 1995, the Deputy Attorney General asked the INS Commissioner to address this issue. This led to the formation of an INS task force in June 1995 to conduct a comprehensive review of the F, M, and J visa processes. Besides the INS, the task force included members from the State Department and the United States Information Agency, and experts in the administration of international student programs.&lt;ref name=ins-fsp-report/&gt; The task force report, issued on December 22, 1995, identified problems in the tracking and monitoring of students by schools, problems in the certification of schools by the INS, and problems with INS receiving and maintaining up-to-date records from schools.&lt;ref name=ins-fsp-report/&gt; As a result of these findings, the [[Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996]] directed the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to develop and conduct a program to collect certain information on nonimmigrant foreign students and exchange visitors from approved institutions of higher education and designated exchange visitor programs.&lt;ref name=ins-fsp-report/&gt;&lt;ref name=shareok/&gt;

In June 1997, the INS launched a pilot program for a centralized electronic reporting system for institutions, called the Coordinated Interagency Partnership Regulating International Students (CIPRIS). The CIPRIS pilot officially ended in October 1999, as the INS felt it had gathered enough data from the prototype to start working on the nationwide system.&lt;ref name=ins-fsp-report/&gt; The INS began working on a new system that would be called the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) with the associated information system called the Student and Exchange Visitor Information Service (SEVIS). During the rollout, CIPRIS and SEVIS met with considerable opposition from the [[NAFSA: Association of International Educators|Association of International Educators]] and the [[American Council on Education]]. However, they claimed that the opposition was not against the programs in principle but due to the concern that a botched rollout by the INS could result in many students suffering.&lt;ref name=ins-fsp-report/&gt;&lt;ref name=shareok/&gt;

=== Launch after the September 11 attacks ===
In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] (September 11, 2001) and the [[Patriot Act]] passed in response (October 26, 2001), there was further increase in scrutiny of student visas, increasing the momentum in favor of the adoption of SEVIS. This was partly because of the fact that one of the attackers, [[Hani Hanjour]], had come to the United States on a student visa.&lt;ref name=factcheck-hanjour&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.factcheck.org/2013/05/911-hijackers-and-student-visas/|title = 9/11 Hijackers and Student Visas|last = Farley|first = Robert|date = May 10, 2013|accessdate = June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shareok/&gt;&lt;ref name=ins-fsp-report/&gt;

During the first half of 2012, changes that affect all colleges, universities, and other educational institutions that provide English language training ("ESL") programs began. These changes stem from the Accreditation of English Language Training Act ("Accreditation Act"), which became effective in June 2011. Pursuant to the Accreditation Act, ESL programs that enroll foreign nonimmigrant students must obtain accreditation from a regional or national accreditation agency recognized by the [[United States Department of Education]]. The Accreditation Act applies to two types of ESL programs: Stand-Alone ESL Schools whose officials have indicated on the school's Form I-17 the intention to offer only ESL programs of study; and Combined Schools whose officials have indicated on the school's Form I-17 that the school offers an ESL program of study, as well as other programs of study. A Combined School may either contract out the ESL program of study or wholly own and operate the ESL program of study under the institution's governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SEVP Implementation of the Accreditation Act|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/sevp-implementation-accreditation-act|publisher=[[Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo]], P.C.|work=The National Law Review|date=2012-07-03|accessdate=2012-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mandatory reporting requirements ===
Schools and programs approved to host students and scholars on these visas are required to report certain information. Information that must be reported includes:
* Change of [[legal name]]
* Change of U.S. address
* Change of major field of study
* Change of education degree level
* Change of funding
* Authorization for off-campus employment

In addition, they must report  events that constitute a violation of the international visitor's visa status, such as academic suspension, [[criminal conviction]], failure to enroll and unauthorized off-campus employment.

=== Fee for students and exchange visitors ===

In 2004, the United States Congress mandated that all international students and exchange visitors pay the I-901 SEVIS fee, which funds the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) and SEVIS. The fee can be paid online at fmjfee.com. As of January 2017, the fees are as follows:&lt;ref name=sevis-fee&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.ice.gov/sevis/i901|title = I-901 SEVIS Fee|publisher = [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" border="1"

| F or M visa applicant (full payment) || 200
|-
| J visa applicant (full payment) || 180
|-
| J visa applicant (subsidized payment) || 35 
|-
| Government visitor || 0
|}

The SEVIS fee must be paid after receiving the initial document (I-20 or DS-2019) and is a prerequisite for obtaining the F, J, or M visa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://internationalaffairs.uchicago.edu/page/students/admitted|title = Admitted Students|publisher = [[University of Chicago]]|accessdate = February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if transitioning to student status using [[Form I-539]].&lt;ref name=studyinthestates-i-539&gt;{{cite web|url = https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/2013/07/what-is-the-form-i-539|title = What is the Form I-539?|date = June 18, 2013|accessdate = February 1, 2016|publisher = [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fee needs to be paid only for the principal (the F-1, J-1, or M-1). Dependents (F-2, J-2, and M-2) do not need to pay the fee. Also, the fee needs to be paid only once per initial SEVIS record, and in particular, does not need to be paid again if applying for a new visa on the same status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://internationalaffairs.uchicago.edu/fmjfee|title = SEVIS Fee|publisher = [[University of Chicago]] Office of International Affairs|accessdate = January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is distinct from the visa fees, which need to be paid for each visa application.

=== Fee for schools seeking SEVP certification ===

Below is the list of fees for schools seeking SEVP certification (through Form I-17) or re-certification, as of January 2017.&lt;ref name=sevis-fee/&gt;

A '''substitute good''' is a good that can be used in place of another.  In [[consumer theory]], substitute goods or '''substitutes''' are products that a consumer perceives as similar or comparable, so that having more of one product makes them desire less of the other product. Formally, ''X'' and ''Y'' are substitutes if, when the price of ''X'' rises, the demand for ''Y'' rises.

[[Potato]]es from different [[farm]]s are an example: if the price of one farm's potatoes goes up, then it can be presumed that fewer people will buy potatoes from that farm and source them from another farm instead.

There are different degrees of substitutability. For example, a [[car]] and a [[bicycle]] may substitute to some extent: if the price of motor fuel increases considerably, one may expect that some people will switch to bicycles.

== Introduction ==
In economics, one way that two or more goods can be classified is by examining the relationship of the demand schedules when the [[price]] of one good changes.  This relationship between demand schedules leads to classification of goods as either substitutes or complements. Substitute goods are goods which, as a result of changed conditions, may replace each other in use (or consumption).&lt;ref name="NoURL" /&gt;  A '''substitute good''', in contrast to a [[complementary good]], is a [[goods|good]] with a positive [[cross elasticity of demand]]. This means a good's demand is increased when the price of another good is increased; both in the same direction.&lt;ref name="mactew"&gt;{{cite book |title=Macroeconomics the Easy Way |last=Kroon |first=George E. |year=2007 |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |isbn=0764132377 |page=39 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iiNLQK2jIxYC |accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is decreased. If goods A and B are substitutes, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to [[Demand curve#Changes that increase demand|shift out]]. A decrease in the price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to [[Demand curve#Changes that decrease demand|shift in]].[[File:Substitute good chart.jpg|thumb|550px|750px|Substitute good graphical example]]
Examples of substitute goods include [[margarine]] and [[butter]], [[tea]] and [[coffee]], [[beer]] and [[wine]].  Substitute goods not only occur on the consumer side of the market but also the producer side.  Substitutable producer goods would include: [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] (used for heating or [[electricity]]).  The degree to which a good has a perfect substitute depends on how specifically the good is defined.  Take for example, the demand for [[Rice Krispies]] cereal, which is a very narrowly defined good as compared to the demand for cereal generally. The fact that one good is substitutable for another has immediate economic consequences: insofar as one good can be substituted for another, the [[demand]]s for the two kinds of good will be interrelated by the fact that customers can trade off one good for the other if it becomes advantageous to do so.

==Increase in price==
An ''increase'' in price ([[ceteris paribus]]) will result in an ''increase'' in demand for its substitute goods. If two goods have a high substitutability, the change in demand will be much greater. Thus, economists can predict that a spike in the cost of a particular brand of detergent is likely to result in a large change in demand for other brands, whereas a change in the price of pencils will have a much smaller effect on the demand for other stationery, such as pens on legal documents or pencils on most high-school maths homework.

==Different types==

=== Substitutability ===
It is important to note that when speaking about substitute goods one is referring to ''two different kinds'' of goods; so the "substitutability" of one good for another is always a matter of degree. One good is a '''perfect substitute''' for another only if it can be used in exactly the same way. In that case the [[utility]] of a combination is an increasing function of the sum of the two amounts, and theoretically, in the case of a price difference, there would be no demand for the more expensive good.

In microeconomics, two types of substitutes are being distinguished, '''gross substitutes''' and '''net substitutes'''. Good &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''gross substitute of good''' &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; if
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial X_i}{\partial P_Y} &gt;0
&lt;/math&gt;

Goods X and Y are said to be '''net substitutes''' if 
:&lt;math&gt;
\left.\frac{\partial X_i}{\partial P_Y}\right|_{U=const}&gt;0
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U=U(X,Y)&lt;/math&gt; is a utility function for the two goods.&lt;ref name="NoURL"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicholson|first=Walter|title=Microeconomic Theory|year=1998|publisher=The Dryden Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Categorization ===
Substitutes differ with respect to their [[Categorization|'''category''']] '''membership'''. '''Within-category''' '''substitutes''' are goods that are members of the same taxonomic category, goods sharing common attributes (e.g., chocolate, chairs, station wagons, etc.). '''Cross-category substitutes''' are goods that are members of different taxonomic categories but can satisfy the same [[goal]]. A person who cannot have the chocolate that she desires, for example, might instead buy ice cream to satisfy her goal to have a dessert.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huh|first=Young Eun|last2=Vosgerau|first2=Joachim|last3=Morewedge|first3=Carey K.|date=2016-06-01|title=More Similar but Less Satisfying Comparing Preferences for and the Efficacy of Within- and Cross-Category Substitutes for Food|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/27/6/894|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=27|issue=6|pages=894–903|doi=10.1177/0956797616640705|issn=0956-7976|pmid=27142460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Substitutability of a good==
[[Image:Indifference-curves-perfect-substitutes.svg|thumb|[[Indifference curve]] for perfect substitutes]]
Goods that are completely substitutable with each other are called perfect substitutes. They may be characterized as goods having a [[linear utility]] function or a constant [[marginal rate of substitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Browning|first=Edgar K|title=Microeconomic Theory &amp; Applications 6th Edition|year=1999|publisher=Addison Wesley Educational Publishers|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Writeable compact disks from different manufacturers are often considered to be perfect substitutes. As the price of one brand of CD rises, consumers will be expected to substitute other brands of CD in a one-to-one fashion. This means that the total quantity of CDs purchased would not change.

Imperfect substitutes have a lesser level of substitutability, and therefore exhibit variable marginal rates of substitution along the consumer [[indifference curve]]. The consumption points on the curve offer the same level of utility as before but the compensation now depends on the starting point of the substitution. An example of such a product is the soft drink.  As the price of [[Coca-Cola]] rises, consumers could be expected to substitute [[Pepsi]]. However, many consumers prefer one brand of soft drink over the other. Consumers who prefer Coke to Pepsi, for example, will not trade between them in a one-to-one fashion. Rather, a consumer would be willing to give relatively large amounts of Pepsi in exchange for relatively small amounts of Coke.

People exhibit a strong preference for within-category substitutes to cross-category substitutes. Across a ten sets of different foods, a majority of research participants (79.7%) believed that a within-category substitute would better satisfy their craving for a food they could not have than a cross-category substitute. Unable to acquire a desired Godiva chocolate, for instance, a majority reported that they would prefer to eat a store-brand chocolate (a within-category substitute) than a chocolate-chip granola bar (a cross-category substitute). This preference for within-category substitutes appears, however, to be misguided. Because within-category substitutes are more similar to the missing good, their inferiority to it is more noticeable. This creates a negative [[contrast effect]], and leads within-category substitutes to be less satisfying substitutes than cross-category substitutes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Monopolistic competition==
Many markets for commonly used goods feature products which are perfectly substitutable yet are differently branded and marketed, a condition referred to as [[monopolistic competition]]. A good example may be the comparison between store brand and name brand versions of medications - the products may be ''identical'' but the packaging is differentiated by the vendors. Since the goods are essentially alike, the only genuine difference between them is the price - their vendors rely primarily on price and [[brand]]ing to effect sales. In those sectors consumer choice is usually driven by discriminate according to ''lowest price'', with higher-priced variants relying on a sense of exclusivity created by slicker branding to maintain competitiveness.

Perfect substitutability is significant in the era of [[deregulation]], since there are usually several competing providers in a field (e.g. electricity suppliers) each retailing exactly the same product. The result is often aggressive [[price competition]] between the retailers.

==Perfect competition==
One of the requirements for [[perfect competition]] is that the products of competing firms should be perfect substitutes. When this condition is not satisfied, the market is characterized by [[product differentiation]].

==Types of substitute goods==
''Unit-demand goods'' are goods from which the consumer wants only a single item. If the consumer has two items, then his utility is the ''maximum'' of the utilities he gains from each of these items. For example, consider a certain consumer that only wants a means of transportation, which may be either a car or a bicycle. His utility from a car is 100 and from a bicycle is 50. If he has both a car and a bicycle, then he uses only the car so his utility is 100. ''Unit-demand goods are always substitutes'', since if the price of one good increases, the consumer will tend to want the other good (Laizer 2016).

'''''The Cloverfield Paradox''''' is a 2018 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]] directed by [[Julius Onah]], written by Oren Uziel and [[Doug Jung]], and produced by [[J. J. Abrams]]{{'}}s [[Bad Robot Productions]]. It is the third installment in the [[Cloverfield (franchise)|''Cloverfield'' franchise]], following ''[[Cloverfield]]'' (2008) and ''[[10 Cloverfield Lane]]'' (2016). The film stars [[Daniel Brühl]], [[Elizabeth Debicki]], [[Aksel Hennie]], [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]], [[Chris O'Dowd]], [[John Ortiz]], [[David Oyelowo]] and [[Zhang Ziyi]], and follows an international group of astronauts aboard a space station who, after using a [[particle accelerator]] to try to solve Earth's energy crisis, must find a way home after accidentally traveling to an [[multiverse|alternate dimension]].

The film was based on ''God Particle'', a [[spec script]] from Oren Uziel which had the main plot of the space station crew, but was unconnected to ''Cloverfield''. The script was acquired by [[Paramount Pictures]] and Bad Robot in 2012. It had been initially planned as part of Paramount's low-budget InSurge distribution label, but following the folding of that label, its production was expanded as a Paramount-distributed film. Only during production did Abrams decide to link the film to ''Cloverfield'', adapting Uziel's screenplay and adding scenes to establish the connection, after the same approach was used to alter ''10 Cloverfield Lane'' from its original script, ''The Cellar''. Abrams saw the particle accelerator accident as a cinematic means for future events to cause changes in the past, narratively linking the ''Cloverfield'' franchise together.

Once announced as a yet-to-be-named ''Cloverfield'' film in late 2016, the film's release was delayed several times. A surprise trailer aired during [[Super Bowl LII]] on February 4, 2018, advertising the film's final title and its release on [[Netflix]], which had purchased rights for the film from Paramount. The release occurred immediately after the game.&lt;ref name="sb"/&gt;

While the unique marketing tactics were praised, the film itself received generally negative reviews from critics, who disliked the narrative, writing and editing, with many considering it the weakest of the ''Cloverfield'' films, although Mbatha-Raw's performance did receive some praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2018/02/05/netflix-cloverfield-paradox-reviews/|title=Netflix Cloverfield sequel trashed by critics: 'An unholy mess'|author=James Hibberd|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/article/the-cloverfield-paradox-wastes-fresh-marketing-on-disappointing-release/|title=The Cloverfield Paradox Wastes Fresh Marketing on Disappointing Release|author=Jean Bentley|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
In 2028,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/06/how-the-cloverfield-paradox-ties-together-the-cloververse  |title=How The Cloverfield Paradox Ties Together The Cloververse|first=Jonathan|last=Dornbush|date=February 5, 2018|work=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earth is suffering from a global energy crisis. The space agencies of the world prepare to test the Shepard [[particle accelerator]] aboard the orbiting Cloverfield Station, which would provide Earth with infinite energy, while conspiracy theorists fear it will create the "Cloverfield Paradox", opening portals to allow horrors from [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel universes]] to threaten Earth. Among the crew is Ava Hamilton, a British engineer who frets about leaving her husband Michael potentially for years, as their relationship struggles since the loss of their children to a house fire. The crew is rounded out by American commander Kiel, German physicist Ernst Schmidt, Brazilian medical doctor Monk Acosta, Irish engineer Mundy, Russian engineer Volkov, and Chinese engineer Tam.

After about two years of unsuccessful testing of the Shepard, they eventually achieve a seemingly stable beam, but it then overloads and creates a power surge on the station. After restoring basic power, they find Earth has vanished from view, and the [[gyroscope]] that aids in the station's navigation is missing. As the crew work on repairs, strange events begin to occur, including finding an unfamiliar woman called Mina Jensen fused with wires inside a wall, whom the crew rescues. Volkov fears something crawling beneath his skin and is compelled to craft a gun using an on-board 3D printer. He uses the gun to threaten the crew, but as he does so he convulses and dies, and the station's colony of worms bursts out of him. Jensen tells Ava not to trust Schmidt, who is soon discovered to be a spy sent by the German government to keep the Shepard shut down. Mundy's arm gets pulled into a solid wall and is severed clean off, without bleeding or pain. They find the arm roaming of its own volition. When they recognize that it is trying to write something, it instructs them to "cut Volkov open". Once they do, they find the missing gyroscope. They quickly locate Earth and restore their communications, but transmissions state that Cloverfield Station was destroyed and fell to Earth two days prior.

The crew determine they have moved to a different universe; Jensen is found to be a crew member of the space station from this universe. Here, Hamilton's children did not die, she stayed on Earth as a civilian engineer, and Jensen replaced Tam as the station's engineer. They plan to reactivate the Shepard device to return to their own universe. While the crew repair the station, Tam works out a means to make Shepard work properly, but she is trapped in a chamber flooding with water, which later implodes and is exposed to space, killing Tam. Meanwhile, Hamilton decides to return with Jensen to Earth to be with her children. As they prepare, Mundy is killed in an explosion caused by a strange magnetic field. After the explosion, Kiel sacrifices himself to disengage the wildly-spinning maintenance ring that was jeopardizing the station, leaving Hamilton in charge.

On Earth, Michael wakes up to discover a wave of destruction ravaging the planet, witnessing the silhouette of a giant monster in the distance. On his way to offer his assistance at the local hospital, he stops to help a young girl named Molly at a dockyard. After learning that the hospital has been destroyed, he takes her to an underground shelter belonging to a friend and tends to her wounds.

With Shepard ready to activate again, Hamilton prepares to leave with Jensen, but Jensen suddenly knocks her out. Jensen kills Monk with Volkov's gun, wounds Schmidt, and insists that the station must stay in her universe to keep the Shepard device there. Regaining consciousness, Hamilton uses the gun to shoot out a window, ejecting Jensen into space. Hamilton decides to return to their universe with Schmidt and makes a recording for her alternate universe self, giving her the plans for the Shepard device and stressing the importance of her family. Hamilton and Schmidt reverse the universe shift and use Tam's modifications to finally make Shepard work. After reporting in, the two eject themselves in an evacuation capsule towards Earth.

Michael learns from mission control of the station's reappearance and his wife's return to Earth, but he lambasts mission control for not warning Hamilton not to return to Earth in light of the ongoing situation. As the capsule re-enters the Earth's atmosphere, the head and torso of [[Clover (creature)|a giant monster]] burst through a layer of clouds.

Additionally, [[Donal Logue]] cameos as Mark Stambler, a conspiracy theorist discussing the "Cloverfield Paradox"; reviewers observed that the character shares the same surname as Howard Stambler, the conspiracy theorist portrayed by [[John Goodman]] in ''10 Cloverfield Lane''.&lt;ref name="independent easter eggs"/&gt; [[Suzanne Cryer]], who appeared as Leslie in ''10 Cloverfield Lane'', also appears in a brief cameo role as a newscaster who interviews Stambler.&lt;ref name="independent easter eggs"/&gt; [[Simon Pegg]] and [[Greg Grunberg]], both of whom have frequently worked with Abrams on other films and television series, provide vocal cameos as Radio Voice and Joe, respectively.&lt;ref name="independent easter eggs"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/cloverfield-3-paradox-easter-eggs-cameos-references-netflix-10-cloverfield-lane-links-secrets-things-a8197506.html | title = The Cloverfield Paradox: All the Easter Eggs, cameos and references to other Cloverfield films | first = Jack | last = Shepherd | date = February 7, 2018 | accessdate = February 9, 2018 | work = [[The Independent]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oyelowo and Logue previously portrayed Kiel and Stambler in the film's [[ARG campaign]].

== Production ==
=== Pre-production ===
The film was announced in November 2012, under the title ''God Particle'', based on a script by Oren Uziel and to be directed by Julius Onah. With J.J. Abrams' Bad Robot Productions as the production studio, it was set to be released under Paramount's [[Insurge Pictures|InSurge]] label, limiting the film's budget to $5–10 million.&lt;ref name="variety announce"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2012/film/news/god-particle-believes-in-newbie-helmer-1118062919/ | title = ‘God Particle’ believes in newbie helmer | first = Justin | last  =Kroll | date = November 30, 2012 | accessdate = February 5, 2018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage, the film was established to take place on a space station in Earth's orbit and a resulting incident that causes the crew to find Earth has gone missing.&lt;ref name="variety announce"/&gt; Uziel said that his script had been a spec script he wrote about one year after finishing up a similar spec script for ''[[Shimmer Lake]]''.&lt;ref name="collider uziel"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://collider.com/god-particle-cloverfield-movie-details-oren-uziel/ | title = Exclusive: ‘God Particle’ Writer Oren Uziel on How the Film Became a Cloverfield Movie | first = Adam | last = Chitwood | date = May 17, 2017 | accessdate = February 5, 2018 | work = [[Collider (website)|Collider]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pick-up of the film occurred around the same time that Paramount and Bad Robot bought the rights to the spec script ''The Cellar'' by Josh Campbell and Matt Stuecken, which ultimately was reworked during production to become ''10 Cloverfield Lane'' (2016), adding in elements to tie that script to the first ''Cloverfield'' film; however, when Uziel wrote his screenplay for ''God Particle'' it had not been attached to ''Cloverfield''.&lt;ref name="collider uziel"/&gt; When Bad Robot acquired the script, J. J. Abrams had already put some thought for how it could fit into ''Cloverfield'' but had not come up with a way prior to filming.&lt;ref name="verge abrams"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16988106/cloverfield-paradox-facebook-questions-jj-abrams-julius-onah-fan-theories-answers-video-debunked | title = Cloverfield Paradox was already shooting before J.J.

In March 2015, Paramount decided to close the InSurge label; ''The Cellar'' had been moved under the main Paramount label, but ''God Particle''{{'}}s fate was unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2015/film/news/paramounts-insurge-gets-absorbed-bad-robots-the-cellar-moves-to-big-studio-1201458545/ | title = Paramount’s Insurge Gets Absorbed; Bad Robot’s ‘The Cellar’ Moves to Big Studio | first = Justin | last = Kroll | date = March 23, 2015 | accessdate = February 5, 2018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2016, Paramount confirmed it would release the film under its own label, with a planned February 2017 release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2016/film/news/god-particle-release-date-jj-abrams-1201707780/ | title = J.J.

=== Filming ===
The film was shot in Los Angeles, California, where it received tax credits under the state's film incentive program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://deadline.com/2016/04/los-angeles-film-production-2016-first-quarter-1201740314/ |title=On-Location L.A.

== Release ==
Shortly after filming in October 2016, ''[[The Wrap]]'' learned from insiders of the connection of ''God Particle'' to ''Cloverfield'', though neither Paramount nor Bad Robot commented on this discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.thewrap.com/jj-abrams-god-particle-next-film-cloverfield-series-exclusive/ | title = JJ Abrams’ ‘God Particle’ Is Next Film in Cloverfield Series (Exclusive) | first = Matt | last = Donnelly | date = October 26, 2016 | accessdate = February 5, 2018 | work = [[The Wrap]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by December 2016, Paramount affirmed the film's connection; the title ''God Particle'' had been dropped in favor of listing the film as "2017 ''Cloverfield'' movie".&lt;ref name="variety renamed"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2016/film/news/j-j-abrams-god-particle-renamed-cloverfield-movie-1201937568/ | title = J.J.

Alongside the renaming, Paramount reslotted the film's release from February 2017 to October 2017, to give more time for post-production.&lt;ref name="variety renamed"/&gt; The film suffered two additional delays. In July 2017, it was announced the release had been delayed another three months to February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/paramount-2017-cloverfield-movie-2018-1202502280/ |title=Paramount Pushes 'Cloverfield Movie' Back to 2018 |author=Dave McNary |date=July 21, 2017|access-date=August 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, the release was moved for a third time, to April 20, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2018/film/news/god-particle-cloverfield-release-date-postponed-1202651936/ | title = J.J.

In mid-January 2018, the ''Cloverfield'' [[alternative reality game]] (ARG), which had been used for both of the previous films, was relaunched, and provided some hints how this film would be tied to the other two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/31/cloverfield-3-rumors-clues-and-theories-about-whats-going-on-in-the-cloverfield-universe | title = Cloverfield 3: Rumors, Clues, And Theories About What's Going On In The Cloverfield Universe | first = Jonathan | last  =Dornbush | date = January 31, 2018 | accessdate = February 5, 2018 | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late January 2018, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' stated that Netflix was interested in picking up the film from Paramount, following a similar deal the streaming service had worked out for the film ''[[Annihilation (film)|Annihilation]]''. According to the ''Reporter'', Paramount's chairman [[Jim Gianopulos]] felt the film's budget (which ballooned to over $40 million from an initial $5 million) was too large for the film to be profitable with a traditional theatrical release and that it still needed work done, and "while Abrams expressed an intent to get down to business in post-production, it was too little, too late".&lt;ref name=THR&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/netflix-talks-acquire-cloverfield-sequel-paramount-1077752 |title=Netflix in Talks to Acquire 'Cloverfield' Sequel From Paramount |last=Kit |first=Borys |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=January 23, 2018 |accessdate=January 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, Paramont's COO Andrew Gumpert affirmed that Paramont, after reviewing the finished film with Abrams, had doubted the commercial viability of a theatrical release, and that "there was an ability for us to be fiscally prudent and monetize" by selling the rights to Netflix, exposing the film to a much larger audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2018/film/news/paramount-coo-andrew-gumpert-reflects-on-cloverfield-premium-vod-and-losing-jordan-peele-1202735784/ | title = Paramount COO Andrew Gumpert Reflects on ‘Cloverfield,’ Premium VOD and Losing Jordan Peele | first  =Andrew | last = Wallenstein | date = March 24, 2018 | accessdate =March 27, 2018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the film's release, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' stated that Netflix paid more than {{USD|50 million|long=no}} for the rights, with negotiations starting in late December 2017 and completed by mid January 2018; this offer made the film immediately profitable to Paramount. The studio retains China and home entertainment release rights.&lt;ref name="Netflix"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/netflix-paid-paramount-more-50-million-cloverfield-paradox-1082305|title=Sources: Netflix Paid Paramount More Than $50 Million for 'Cloverfield Paradox'|publisher=Netflix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thr 50m"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/netflix-paid-paramount-more-50-million-cloverfield-paradox-1082305 | title = Sources: Netflix Paid Paramount More Than $50 Million for 'Cloverfield Paradox' | first1 = Borys | last1 = Kit | first2= Pamela | last2 = McClintonk | date = February 6, 2018 | accessdate = February 6, 2018 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wrap feb6"/&gt; According insiders speaking to ''The Wrap'', Paramount executives believed handing off the release to Netflix was an easy way to get instant return on the film, and the surprise reveal and release a good way to keep in line with the mysterious mystique in the franchise. This said, they clarified that they still have intentions of having theatrical releases for future films in the series.&lt;ref name="wrap feb6"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-still-release-jj-abrams-overlord-cloverfield-paradox-netflix-exclusive/ | title= Paramount to Release JJ Abrams’ ‘Overlord’ Despite Shuffling ‘Cloverfield Paradox’ to Netflix |first = Jeremy | last= Fuster | date   =February 6, 2018 | accessdate = February 7, 2018 | work = [[The Wrap]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, speculation of the film being named ''Cloverfield Station'' arose, though this was not confirmed by Paramount.&lt;ref name=THR/&gt; Further speculation circulated in Hollywood sources that work on the film was actually complete and that its first trailer would be revealed soon; ''10 Cloverfield Lane'' had a similar surprise trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2303282/cloverfield-3s-first-trailer-may-debut-sooner-than-we-thought | title =Cloverfield 3’s First Trailer May Debut Sooner Than We Thought | first = Dirk | last = Libbey | date = January 29, 2018 | accessdate = February 5, 2018 | work = [[Cinema Blend]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The events of the preceding month culminated on February 4, 2018, where, during a surprise advertisement during Super Bowl LII, Netflix announced it had acquired the premiere rights for the film, now titled ''The Cloverfield Paradox'', and would be available on the service, immediately after the game.&lt;ref name="sb"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://deadline.com/2018/02/cloverfield-sequel-god-particle-super-bowl-trailer-netflix-streaming-release-1202276386/ | title = Netflix’s Ultimate Super Bowl Surprise: ‘The Cloverfield Paradox’ – Watch Trailer | first = Anthony | last = D'Alessandro | date = February 4, 2018 | accessdate = February 4, 2018 | work = [[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actors themselves were not aware of this arrangement until the day of the Super Bowl and were told of the title, the advertisement, and the release that day during a morning conference call.&lt;ref name="verge abrams"/&gt;

===Home media===
On November 28, 2018, Paramount announced that the film would be receiving a DVD and Blu-ray release on February 5, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=24279&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Critical reception==
On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 17% based on 107 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5/10. The site's critical consensus states: "Brilliant casting is overshadowed by a muddled mix of genres and storylines that scratch more heads than sci-fi itches in ''The Cloverfield Paradox''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Cloverfield Paradox (2018) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_cloverfield_paradox |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=March 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on reviews from 27 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Cloverfield Paradox Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-cloverfield-paradox |accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John DeFire of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' called the film a "trainwreck of a sci-fi flick bent on extending a franchise that should have died a peaceful death almost exactly one decade ago."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/cloverfield-paradox-review-1081665|title='The Cloverfield Paradox': Film Review|first=John|last=DeFore|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=February 4, 2018|accessdate=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for [[Deadline Hollywood]] Dino-Ray Ramos said, "The Super Bowl trailer for ''Paradox'' gave the impression the movie would reveal the origin of the monster that appeared in the 2008 movie and was later on hinted at in the critically acclaimed 2016 follow-up — but it barely did that. Instead, it stalls the franchise as a pastiche of sci-fi cinema veiled in clever marketing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/02/the-cloverfield-paradox-review-netflix-jj-abrams-gugu-mbatha-raw-daniel-bruhl-julius-onah-1202278163/|title=‘The Cloverfield Paradox’ Review: A Mishmash Of Sci-Fi Tropes That Leaves More Unanswered Questions Behind|first=Dino-Ray|last=Ramos|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=February 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cinemablend gave it a positive review, granting it 4 of 5 stars; the review noted that the [[ensemble cast]] "helps keep the wheels in motion, with a perpetual motion that never lets up", and that Ava's storyline provides a "human anchor" for the film's narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/2306662/the-cloverfield-paradox-review |title=The Cloverfield Paradox Review |last=Reyes |first=Mike |date=2018-02-05 |work=CINEMABLEND |access-date=2018-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the film received negative reviews, the marketing approach of announcing the film during the Super Bowl and premiering it hours later was seen as a novel move by Netflix. [[IGN]] noted that this strategy could only work for a film in an established franchise, whereas most new films would need a significant marketing period to draw in viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/05/the-cloverfield-gimmick-how-netflix-tricked-the-world | title = The Cloverfield Gimmick: How Netflix Tricked The World | first = William | last =Bibbiani | date = February 5, 2018 | accessdate = February 5, 2018 | work = [[IGN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even knowing that the film might be a critical flop, Netflix would have been able to grab attention due to hype from the Super Bowl, and attention that the ''Cloverfield'' series had already had.&lt;ref name="thr 50m" /&gt;

According to [[Nielsen ratings]] based on subscription video on demand, nearly 785,000 viewers watched ''The Cloverfield Paradox'' on the night of Super Bowl LII; by three days, over 2.8 million had watched it, and 5 million after a week.&lt;ref name=Nielsen&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/cloverfield-paradox-netflix-viewership-nielsen-says-smaller-bright-1085311 | title = Nielsen Says 785K Watched Netflix's 'Cloverfield Paradox' on Super Bowl Sunday | first = Michael | last = O'Conner | date = February 15, 2018 | accessdate = February 15, 2018 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; These ratings were not as strong as Netflix's ''[[Bright (film)|Bright]]'', released 6 weeks earlier, which had 11 million viewers within 3 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/netflix-bright-ratings-viewers-nielsen-1202649332/ |title=Netflix's 'Bright' Lands 11 Million U.S. Streaming Viewers Over First Three Days |last=Spangler |first=Todd |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2017-12-26 |accessdate=2018-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film did not significantly draw viewers from the episode of ''[[This Is Us (TV series)|This is Us]]'' on NBC after the Super Bowl game, which had been extensively marketed ahead of the night, and which drew 27 million that evening.&lt;ref name=Nielsen/&gt;

'''''The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning''''' is the first game in ''[[The Legend of Spyro]]'' trilogy, a [[reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of the ''[[Spyro|Spyro the Dragon]]'' series. It was [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Krome Studios]] and published by [[Vivendi Universal Games]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]], [[GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. [[Amaze Entertainment]] developed the [[Nintendo DS]] version.

The game utilizes the voices of celebrities, featuring [[Elijah Wood]] as the voice of Spyro, Comedian [[David Spade]] as Sparx, [[Cree Summer]] as Cynder and [[Gary Oldman]] as Ignitus. Its success spawned two sequels and a planned CGI movie.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Spyro ANB screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|An in-game screenshot for ''A New Beginning''. Spyro is seen fighting an ape soldier with an electricity move.]]
''The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning'' uses a more action-based focus than previous ''Spyro'' games. Rather than the previous focus on platforming, the gameplay is now more combat based. Spyro has a variety of combat moves as well as four different breath attacks: fire, electricity, ice and earth, which he can use as both long range and short range attacks. Spyro can also use furies, huge blasts of elemental energy. The game has fewer levels than previous ''Spyro'' games, with six levels that progress from a starting point towards a final destination and boss encounter in a linear fashion, and two [[Shoot 'em up#Tube and rail shooters|rail shooter]] style flying levels adjoining them. It takes about six hours to complete the game.

The DS version has additional attacks and challenges. As well as breath attacks and furies, Spyro can create an elemental shield around himself that protects him from enemies while hurting attacking enemies. Also, the DS version has extra side missions in the form of puzzles.

==Plot==
The game begins inside a temple, where a large red dragon named Ignitus is watching over an egg; it is the "Year of the Dragon", a time every twelve years when new dragon eggs are brought to the realm. A dragons' prophecy tells that every ten generations, a rare purple dragon will be born, who will direct the fate of that era; Ignitus is looking after such an egg.

The dragons are, however, at war with an enemy known as the "Dark Master", who also knows of the prophecy, and lays siege to the temple, intent on destroying the brood of eggs. Ignitus escapes with the purple dragon's egg, leaving it to drift downriver into a swamp, hoping for the best.  The egg is discovered by a family of dragonflies, and upon hatching, they name the dragon Spyro and adopt him into the family and raise him as one of their own, alongside Sparx, a dragonfly born the same day.

One day, after coming under attack by strange foes and discovering that he can breathe fire, Spyro is told that he is not a dragonfly himself but a stranger from a distant land; Spyro decides to leave the swamp in search of his true home; Sparx, though reluctant at first, decides to follow along.  Spyro is pursued by hostile forces, but eventually comes into contact with a distraught Ignitus, who although pleased that Spyro is alive, fears that with the Dragon Temple under occupation by their enemy, led by a female dragon named Cynder (who was from the same brood of eggs, but was kidnapped) their war is already lost.

Spyro convinces Ignitus to lead him to the Temple, and is able to drive Cynder's forces out, after which Ignitus tells Spyro more about their war against the dark armies, offers Spyro some training in the art of the fire element, and then sends Spyro off to rescue three other dragons from Cynder's forces.  One by one, Spyro clashes with Cynder's armies, rescues the three other dragons, Volteer, Cyril, and Terrador, while acquiring new skills and training along the way.  It is learned that Cynder has been draining the dragons' power into crystals.

Cynder, however, starts fighting Spyro who shortly after rescues the final Dragon Guardian, Terrador; Ignitus intervenes to fight Cynder but is kidnapped.  It is revealed that it was the four dragons who originally sealed away the Dark Master, and that Cynder is using the dragons' drained powers to open the seal.  Ignitus's power is the final key in unsealing the Dark Master, so Spyro is sent on a final, direct assault against Cynder's fortress.

Spyro attempts to fight Cynder, but Cynder succeeds in draining Ignitus's power of fire into a crystal, and escapes to the sealed realm of the Dark Master. During the fight, Spyro had noticed there was something familiar in Cynder's eyes. Ignitus then tells Spyro the rest of the story of what happened the night of the attack on the temple. After sending Spyro's egg down the river, Ignitus had returned to see that the Dark Master's forces had destroyed the brood of eggs, except one - for only a dragon born in the Year of the Dragon can open the portal and release the Dark Master: Cynder, who had been transformed by the Dark Master's sinister powers. Ignitus fears that it is too late to stop her, but Spyro pursues Cynder and forces a showdown, eventually using all of his power in a final attack which defeats her, purging her of the Dark Master's influence and returning her to her true form, a young dragon the same size as Spyro. The realm begins to collapse in on itself; Sparx insists on making a quick exit but Spyro declares he will not leave Cynder behind with the Dark Master; though barely, Spyro is able to grab Cynder and escape safely.

Though victorious, the battle cost Spyro much of his own strength and powers, and both Spyro and Cynder suspect that the Dark Master is still alive somewhere; the war is still far from over. The story continues in ''[[The Legend of Spyro: The Eternal Night]]''.

==Characters==
===Spyro and Sparx===
Spyro and Sparx are described as being an "oddly-matched, yet compatible pair". Spyro was adopted into a family of dragonflies, growing up alongside Sparx, a dragonfly born the same day.  Through an ape attack, Spyro's parents tell him that he isn't a dragonfly. In fact, he is a dragon from a distant place. Learning this, Spyro set out to find this place and Sparx tagged along with him. Spyro and Sparx are voiced by Elijah Wood and David Spade.

===Dragon Guardians===
The Dragon Guardians are a group of four elder dragons, each the master of an elemental power and who in turn teach that power to Spyro once he finds them. Ignitus, a red dragon, is very wise and is the guardian of fire. Volteer, a highly intelligent yellow dragon with a lightning fast tongue and guardian of electricity, Cyril, a sassy blue ice dragon and is the guardian of ice, and Terrador, a [[Militant (word)|militant]] green dragon with a spike ball tail tip and is the guardian of earth. Gary Oldman voices as Ignitus, Corey Burton as Volteer, Jeff Bennett as Cyril, and Kevin Michael Richardson as Terrador.

===Cynder===
A large, powerful black dragon, Cynder serves as the primary antagonist in ''The Legend of Spyro: A New Beginning''. Although born from the same batch of eggs as Spyro and in truth the same size and age as Spyro, Cynder's egg was seized by the Dark Master's forces and she was raised by them; under the influence of the Dark Master's power, Cynder grew to gigantic size and strength quickly due to the dark magic the Dark Master shrouded Cynder in, and was then able to defeat and capture the Dragon Guardians, collecting their power in order to unseal the Dark Master from imprisonment. After her defeat from Spyro, Cynder returned to her original size and strength, and was safely returned to the Dragon Temple to celebrate Spyro's victory. Cynder is voiced by Cree Summer.

==Development==
{{Unsourced-section|date=February 2018}}
[[Krome Studios]] were asked by [[Vivendi Games]] to develop ''The Legend of Spyro''. After Krome showed Vivendi their technology they were using to develop a ''Crash Bandicoot'' game, Sierra asked a prototype for what subsequently became ''The Legend of Spyro''.

'''''The Odyssey''''' is a 1997 American [[fantasy film|fantasy]]&amp;ndash;[[adventure film|adventure]] [[miniseries|television miniseries]] based on the ancient Greek epic poem by [[Homer]], the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Directed by [[Andrei Konchalovsky]], the miniseries aired in two parts beginning on May 18, 1997 on [[NBC]]. The series won the award for "Outstanding Directing for a Miniseries or a Special". It was filmed in [[Malta]], [[Turkey]], parts of England, and many other places around the Mediterranean, where the story takes place. The cast includes [[Armand Assante]], [[Greta Scacchi]], [[Irene Papas]], [[Isabella Rossellini]], [[Bernadette Peters]], [[Eric Roberts]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Christopher Lee]] and [[Vanessa Williams]].

==Plot==

===Part 1===
[[Odysseus]] ([[Armand Assante]]), the king of the ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] kingdom of [[Homer's Ithaca|Ithaca]], is called to service in the [[Trojan War]] after the birth of his son [[Telemachus]], much to the dismay of his wife Queen [[Penelope]] ([[Greta Scacchi]]). Odysseus is worried that he may not return, and tells Penelope that she should remarry by the time Telemachus is a man if he does not return. The war lasts ten years, during which Greece's best soldier, [[Achilles]] ([[Richard Trewett]]), is killed and the Greeks avenge him by using a [[Trojan Horse|giant horse]] to sneak inside and destroy the city of [[Troy]]. [[Laocoön]] ([[Heathcote Williams]]) tries to warn the Trojans of a vision of this, but is suddenly devoured by a [[sea monster]]. On the way back, Odysseus' ego gets the best of him and he tells the [[Greek Gods|gods]] that he did it himself, which angers [[Poseidon]] (voiced by [[Miles Anderson]]) so much that he promises to make Odysseus' journey home to Penelope nearly impossible, mentioning that it was he who sent the sea monster to devour Laocoön.

Odysseus and his men initially stop on an island dominated by one-eyed giants, the [[Cyclops|Cyclopes]]. A Cyclops named [[Polyphemus]] ([[Reid Asato]]) traps them in his cave intending to eat them, but Odysseus gets him drunk on wine, causing him to pass out. Then, he sharpens a tree branch into a stake and blinds the Cyclops, allowing them to escape by hiding under sheep skins when he removes the heavy stone door. Polyphemus screams for help, but Odysseus had tricked him into stating that his name was "Nobody", so the Cyclops is shouting that nobody has tricked him, arousing no suspicion. Odysseus and his men escape, but Odysseus taunts the Cyclops who asks his father Poseidon to avenge him. This makes Odysseus' journey home harder.

Odysseus travels to an island where [[Aeolus]] ([[Michael J. Pollard]]) provides him with a bag of wind to help him home, instructing him to open it when he gets close to Ithaca. One of his men opens it prematurely blowing them off course. Next, they stop at the island of [[Circe]] ([[Bernadette Peters]]), a beautiful witch, who turns his men into animals and blackmails him into sleeping with her. Odysseus is told of Circe's magic by [[Hermes]] ([[Freddy Douglas]]), who helps him avoid being transformed as well. Circe tells him to go to the [[Greek underworld|Underworld]] next, and only then does Odysseus realize that he has actually been tricked by Circe, who put a spell on him so he stayed on the island for five years instead of five days. Odysseus digs his ship out of the sand and tide and sails to the Underworld.

===Part 2===
Arriving at the Underworld, [[Tiresias]] ([[Christopher Lee]]) torments Odysseus, recognizing his courage and wit, but criticizes his ego and foolishness. After Odysseus sacrifices a goat into the River [[Styx]], Tiresias tells him that the only way home will take him past a treacherous isle where the monsters [[Scylla]] and [[Charybdis]] live. As he is running in terror from the underworld, he meets his mother [[Anticlea]] ([[Irene Papas]]), who committed suicide due to the pain of losing her son. She informs him that back on Ithaca there are multiple suitors, including [[Eurymachus]] ([[Eric Roberts]]), vying with each other to marry Penelope for her money and power.

Odysseus' boat nears the isle of Scylla and Charybdis. Scylla's six serpentine heads wreak havoc on the crew, killing many. Everyone but Odysseus is killed when Charybdis creates a whirlpool and destroys his ship. Odysseus arrives on the island where [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]] ([[Vanessa Williams]]) lives and becomes her prisoner. Meanwhile, Odysseus' now 15-year-old son Telemachus ([[Alan Stenson]]) tries to find his father and is told by [[Athena]] ([[Isabella Rossellini]]) to travel to [[Sparta]] and seek out one of his former comrades that fought with him. When Telemachus finds [[Menelaus]] ([[Nicholas Clay]]), one of Odysseus' comrades, he learns that he doesn't know what happened to Odysseus but believes him to be dead.

Two years later, Hermes arrives, telling Calypso to release Odysseus, and she provides him with a raft to get to Ithaca. Another storm causes problems for Odysseus as he calls out to Poseidon. Poseidon reminds Odysseus about what he said the day he left Troy, and to remember his place as a mere mortal. The next morning, Odysseus washes ashore and is found by some [[Scheria|Phaeacians]] girls. With help from Phaeacian King [[Alcinous]] ([[Jeroen Krabbé]]), they help Odysseus back to Ithaca. They deliver him at night while he is fast asleep, to a hidden harbor on Ithaca. Upon awakening the next morning, he finds himself on Ithaca where is reunited with Telemachus. Using a peasant disguise provided by Athena, Odysseus meets up with Penelope where she decides to hold a contest to find the person who can string Odysseus' bow. After Odysseus wins the contest, Athena lifts his disguise and Odysseus is assisted by Telemachus in slaying Eurymachus and the suitors. Once the suitors are dead, Odysseus reunites with Penelope.

===Special effects===
The creature effects for this miniseries were provided by [[Jim Henson's Creature Shop]] where they used a talking animatronic pig roasting on a spit, a CGI for [[Scylla]], a rod puppet sea slug-like [[sea monster]] that devours [[Laocoön]], and the full-bodied version of [[Polyphemus]].

The boat used in the series was reused a few years later for the ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (miniseries)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' miniseries.

===Rating===
[[MPAA]] rated this film PG-13 for violent sequences and some sensuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118414/parentalguide|title=The Odyssey's Rating|accessdate=July 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But the first training session makes matters worse as everyone involved starts making more offensive comments at each other. The situation later makes matters even worse when Flex introduces a talking doll based on his likeness that uses offensive language. This prompts Ebro's boss, Station Manager Alex Cameron, who wants Ebro to tell Flex that the doll "is faulty as Flex's ears," to take action into his own hands and forces the entire air staff to take a weekend sensitivity course. Meanwhile, Rosenberg feels slighted by [[Mike Tyson]] after the former boxer visits the station during Cipha and Rosenberg's show and incorrectly calls out the latter's first name as "Dave", not knowing that the staffers are in on the flub because Rosenberg is a fan of Tyson.

'''''To Stay Alive: A Method''''' is a 2016 Dutch documentary film directed by Erik Lieshout, Arno Hagers and Reinier van Brummelen. It is based on [[Michel Houellebecq]]'s 1991 essay "To Stay Alive", about struggling artists, the role of the poet, and mental health problems. It features marginal artists as well as Houellebecq and the rock singer [[Iggy Pop]], who reads from the original essay.

==Production==
The director Erik Lieshout had first met Houellebecq when he interviewed him for Dutch television during the promotion of the novel ''[[The Possibility of an Island]]'', and ended up directing ''Last Words'', a behind-the-scenes documentary for Houellebecq's own [[La Possibilité d'une île (film)|film adaptation of the novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Macnab|first=Geoffrey|date=2016-11-22|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/to-stay-alive-a-method-iggy-pop-michel-houellebecq-a7431721.html|title=When Iggy Pop met Michel Houellebecq: They admitted that they were die-hard fans of one another|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lieshout then asked [[Iggy Pop]] if he could possibly provide a track for the film, with little hope; but to his surprise, the singer replied very enthusiastically: in the mean time he had actually read the book (as well as a selection of Houellebecq's poetry), and loved it, finding many parallels with his own life and state of mind, to the point that it inspired him a whole album, named ''[[Préliminaires]]'', quieter than his usual output, partly sung in french, with several tracks directly related to the novel. The two artists first met in 2009, during the promotion for the album, and shared their admiration for each other's works. Indeed, Houellebecq has been a devoted fan of [[The Stooges]] since he was a teenager, contrasting with his reputation for apathy and languid intellectualism.

''To Stay Alive: A Method'' was produced by Serious Film with co-production support from AT-prod and VPRO. It was completed in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://international.eyefilm.nl/to-stay-alive-a-method.html|title=To Stay Alive - a Method|work=Eye International|publisher=Film Institute Netherlands|accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film was screened at the [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam]] on 19 November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idfa.nl/industry/tags/project.aspx?id=4c96ebff-dc00-4896-8ea8-51a06a3aa33e|title=To Stay Alive - A Method|publisher=[[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam]]|accessdate=2017-01-04}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in Dutch cinemas on 2 February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmtotaal.nl/film/30437|title=To Stay Alive: A Method|work=Filmtotaal|accessdate=2017-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IPA notice}}
This article is a technical description of the sound system of the [[Vietnamese language]], including [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]]. Two main varieties of Vietnamese, [[Hanoi]] and [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (Saigon), are described below.

==Initial consonants==
Initial consonants which exist only in the Hanoi dialect are in red, while those that exist only in the Saigon dialect are in blue.

* /w/ is the only initial consonant permitted to form [[consonant cluster]]s with other consonants.
* {{IPA|/p/}} occurs syllable-initially only in [[loan word]]s, and is mostly converted into {{IPA|/ɓ/}} (as in ''sâm banh'', derived from French ''champagne'').
* The glottalized stops are preglottalized and voiced:  {{IPA|[ʔɓ, ʔɗ]}} (the [[glottis]] is always closed before the oral closure). This glottal closure is often not released before the release of the oral closure, resulting in the characteristic [[implosive]] pronunciation. However, sometimes the glottal closure is released prior to the oral release in which case the stops are pronounced {{IPA|[ʔb, ʔd]}}. Therefore, the primary characteristic is preglottalization with implosion being secondary.
* {{IPA|/ɓ, m/}} are [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]], while {{IPA|/f, v/}} are [[Labiodental consonant|labiodental]].
* {{IPA|/t, tʰ/}} are [[Denti-alveolar consonant|denti-alveolar]] ({{IPA|[t̪, t̪ʰ]}}), while {{IPA|/ɗ, n, l/}} are [[Apical consonant|apico]]-[[alveolar consonant|alveolar]].&lt;ref name="Kirby 382"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kirby|2011|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/c, ɲ/}} are phonetically [[Laminal consonant|lamino]]-[[palatoalveolar]]  (the blade of the tongue makes contact behind the [[alveolar ridge]]).
* {{IPA|/ʈ, c/}} are often slightly [[affricate]]d {{IPA|[ʈ͡ʂ, t͡ɕ]}}, but they are [[Aspiration (phonetics)|unaspirated]].
* A [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}} is inserted before words that begin with a vowel or {{IPA|/w/}}:

:{| cellpadding="5" style="line-height: 1.0em;"
| ''ăn''
| 'to eat'
| {{IPA|/ăn/}}
| →
| {{IPA|[ʔăn]}}
|-
| ''uỷ''
| 'to delegate'
| {{IPA|/wi/}}
| →
| {{IPA|[ʔwi]}}
|}

===Hanoi initials===
* {{IPA|/s, z/}} are [[Laminal consonant|laminal]].&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Thompson|1965"/&gt;
* ''d'', ''gi'' and ''r'' are all pronounced {{IPA|/z/}}.
* ''ch'' and ''tr'' are both pronounced {{IPA|/c/}}, while ''x'' and ''s'' are both pronounced {{IPA|/s/}}.

===Saigon initials===
* {{IPA|/s/}} is [[Apical consonant|apical]].&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Thompson|1965"/&gt;
* ''d'' and ''gi'' are both pronounced {{IPA|/j/}}.
* Historically, {{IPA|/v/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[j]}}, merging with ''d'' and ''gi''. However, it is becoming distinct and pronounced as {{IPA|[v]}}.
* Historically, a distinction is made between ''ch'' {{IPA|/c/}} and ''tr'' {{IPA|/ʈ/}}, as well as between ''x'' {{IPA|/s/}} and ''s'' {{IPA|/ʂ/}}. However, these two pairs are becoming merged as {{IPA|/c/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Phạm|2008|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In southern speech, the phoneme {{IPA|/r/}}, generally represented in Vietnamese linguistics by the letter {{angbr|r}}, has a number of variant pronunciations that depend on the speaker. More than one pronunciation may even be found within a single speaker. It may occur as a [[Voiced retroflex fricative|retroflex fricative]] {{IPA|[ʐ]}}, an [[alveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ]}}, a [[Alveolar tap|flap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} or a [[Alveolar trill|trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}.

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] chart of vowel nuclei above is based on the sounds in Hanoi Vietnamese; other regions may have different inventories. Vowel nuclei consist of [[monophthong]]s (simple [[vowel]]s) and three [[centering diphthong]]s.

* All vowels are [[Roundedness|unrounded]] except for the four back rounded vowels: {{IPA|/u, o, ɔ, uə̯/}}.
* {{IPA|/ə̆/}} and {{IPA|/ă/}} are pronounced [[Vowel length|short]] — shorter than the other vowels.
* While there are small consistent spectral differences between {{IPA|/ə̆/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}}, it has not been established that they are perceptually significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kirby|2011|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{IPA|/ɨ/}}: Many descriptions, such as Thompson,&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Thompson|1965"/&gt; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguyễn|1970}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Nguyễn|1997}}, consider this vowel to be [[Close back unrounded vowel|close back unrounded]]: {{IPA|[ɯ]}}. However, Han's&lt;ref name="Harvcoltxt|Han|1966"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Han|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; instrumental analysis indicates that it is more central than back. {{Harvcoltxt|Hoang|1965}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Brunelle|2003}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Phạm|2006}} also transcribe this vowel as central.
{{clear}}

===Closing sequences===
In Vietnamese, vowel nuclei are able to combine with offglides {{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}} to form closing [[diphthong]]s and [[triphthong]]s. Below is a chart&lt;ref&gt;From {{Harvcoltxt|Nguyễn|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; listing the closing sequences of general northern speech.

:{| class="wikitable nowrap" style="text-align: center;"
! rowspan="2" |

| {{IPA|/uə̯j/}} {{angbr|uôi}}
|-
! [[Close vowel|Close]]
| {{IPA|/iw/}} {{angbr|iu}}
| {{IPA|/ɨw/}} {{angbr|ưu}}
| {{IPA|/ɨj/}} {{angbr|ưi}}
| {{IPA|/uj/}} {{angbr|ui}}
|-
! [[Close-mid vowel|Close-mid]]/&lt;br&gt;[[Mid vowel|Mid]]
| {{IPA|/ew/}} {{angbr|êu}}
| –
&lt;br&gt;{{IPA|/ə̆w/}} {{angbr|âu}}
| {{IPA|/əj/}} {{angbr|ơi}}
&lt;br&gt;{{IPA|/ə̆j/}} {{angbr|ây}}

|-

&lt;br&gt;{{IPA|/ăw/}} {{angbr|au}}
| {{IPA|/aj/}} {{angbr|ai}}
&lt;br&gt;{{IPA|/ăj/}} {{angbr|ay}}
| {{IPA|/ɔj/}} {{angbr|oi}}
|}

{{Harvcoltxt|Thompson|1965}} says that in Hanoi, words spelled with ''ưu'' and ''ươu'' are pronounced {{IPA|/iw, iəw/}}, respectively, whereas other dialects in the Tonkin delta pronounce them as {{IPA|/ɨw/}} and {{IPA|/ɨəw/}}. This observation is also made by {{Harvcoltxt|Phạm|2008}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Kirby|2011}}.

==Final stops==
When stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} occur at the end of words, they have [[no audible release]] ({{IPA|[p̚, t̚, k̚]}}):

:{| cellpadding="5" style="line-height: 1.0em;"
| ''đáp''
| 'to reply'
| {{IPA|/ɗap/}}
| →
| {{IPA|[ɗap̚]}}
|-
| ''mát''
| 'cool'
| {{IPA|/mat/}}
| →
| {{IPA|[mat̚]}}
|-
| ''khác''
| 'different'
| {{IPA|/xak/}}
| →
| {{IPA|[xak̚]}}
|}

When the velar consonants {{IPA|/k, ŋ/}} are after {{IPA|/u, o, ɔ/}}, they are articulated with a simultaneous bilabial closure {{IPA|[k͡p̚, ŋ͡m]}} (i.e. [[doubly articulated]]) or are strongly [[labialization|labialized]] {{IPA|[k̚ʷ, ŋʷ]}}.

:{| cellpadding="5" style="line-height: 1.0em;"
| ''đục''
| 'muddy'
| {{IPA|/ɗuk/}}
| →
| {{IPA|[ɗuk͡p̚]}}, {{IPA|[ɗuk̚ʷ]}}
|-
| ''độc''
| 'poison'
| {{IPA|/ɗok/}}
| →
| {{IPA|[ɗə̆wk͡p̚]}}, {{IPA|[ɗə̆wk̚ʷ]}}
|-
| ''đọc''
| 'to read'
| {{IPA|/ɗɔk/}}
| →
| {{IPA|[ɗăwk͡p̚]}}, {{IPA|[ɗăwk̚ʷ]}}
|-
| ''ung''
| 'cancer'
| {{IPA|/uŋ/}}
| →
| {{IPA|[uŋ͡m]}}, {{IPA|[uŋʷ]}}
|-
| ''ông''
| 'man'
| {{IPA|/oŋ/}}
| →
| {{IPA|[ə̆wŋ͡m]}}, {{IPA|[ə̆wŋʷ]}}
|-
| ''ong''
| 'bee'
| {{IPA|/ɔŋ/}}
| →
| {{IPA|[ăwŋ͡m]}}, {{IPA|[ăwŋʷ]}}
|}

===Hanoi finals===
====Analysis of final ''ch'', ''nh''====

The pronunciation of syllable-final ''ch'' and ''nh'' in Hanoi Vietnamese has had different analyses. One analysis, that of {{Harvcoltxt|Thompson|1965}} has them as being phonemes {{IPA|/c, ɲ/}}, where {{IPA|/c/}} contrasts with both syllable-final ''t'' {{IPA|/t/}} and ''c'' {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɲ/}} contrasts with syllable-final ''n'' {{IPA|/n/}} and ''ng'' {{IPA|/ŋ/}}. Final {{IPA|/c, ɲ/}} is, then, identified with syllable-initial {{IPA|/c, ɲ/}}.

Another analysis has final {{angbr|ch}} and {{angbr|nh}} as representing predictable [[allophonic]] variants of the velar phonemes {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} that occur after upper front vowels {{IPA|/i/}} (orthographic {{angbr|i}}) and {{IPA|/e/}} (orthographic {{angbr|ê}}). This analysis interprets orthographic ⟨ach⟩ and ⟨anh⟩ as an underlying {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, which becomes phonetically open and diphthongized: {{IPA|/ɛk/}} → {{IPA|[ăjk̟̚]}}, {{IPA|/ɛŋ/}} → {{IPA|[ăjŋ̟]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Although there are some words where orthographic {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|ng}} occur after {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, these words are few and are mostly loanwords or [[onomatopoeia]]&lt;/ref&gt; This diphthongization also affects ⟨êch⟩ and ⟨ênh⟩: {{IPA|/ek/}} → {{IPA|[ə̆jk̟̚]}}, {{IPA|/eŋ/}} → {{IPA|[ə̆jŋ̟]}}.

Arguments for the second analysis include the limited distribution of final {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[ɲ]}}, the gap in the distribution of {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[ŋ]}} which do not occur after {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[e]}}, the pronunciation of ⟨ach⟩ and ⟨anh⟩ as {{IPA|[ɛc]}} and {{IPA|[ɛɲ]}} in certain conservative central dialects,&lt;ref name="rhyme"/&gt; and the patterning of {{IPA|[k]}}~{{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[ŋ]}}~{{IPA|[ɲ]}} in certain reduplicated words. Additionally, final {{IPA|[c]}} is not articulated as far forward as the initial {{IPA|[c]}}: {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[ɲ]}} are pre-velar {{IPA|[k̟, ŋ̟]}} with no alveolar contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kirby|2011|p=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first analysis closely follows the surface pronunciation of a slightly different Hanoi dialect than the second. In this dialect, the {{IPA|/a/}} in {{IPA|/ac/}} and {{IPA|/aɲ/}} is not diphthongized but is actually articulated more forward, approaching a front vowel {{IPA|[æ]}}. This results in a three-way contrast between the rimes ''ăn'' {{IPA|[æ̈n]}} vs. ''anh'' {{IPA|[æ̈ɲ]}} vs. ''ăng'' {{IPA|[æ̈ŋ]}}. For this reason, a separate phonemic {{IPA|/ɲ/}} is posited.

==Tone==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

Vietnamese vowels are all pronounced with an inherent [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]]. Tones differ in

* pitch
* length
* contour melody
* intensity
* [[phonation]] (with or without accompanying constricted vocal cords)

Unlike many Native American, African, and Chinese languages, Vietnamese tones do not rely solely on [[pitch contour]]. Vietnamese often uses instead a [[register complex]] (which is a combination of phonation type, pitch, length, vowel quality, etc.). So perhaps a better description would be that Vietnamese is a register language and not a "pure" tonal language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Phạm|2003|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vietnamese orthography, tone is indicated by diacritics written above or below the vowel.

===Six-tone analysis===

There is much variation among speakers concerning how tone is realized phonetically. There are differences between varieties of Vietnamese spoken in the major geographic areas (northern, central, southern) and smaller differences within the major areas (e.g. Hanoi vs. other northern varieties). In addition, there seems to be variation among individuals. More research is needed to determine the remaining details of tone realization and the variation among speakers.

====Northern varieties====

The six tones in the Hanoi and other northern varieties are:

[[File:VietnameseToneHanoi2.png|thumb|upright=1.93|Hanoi tones as uttered by a different female speaker in isolation. From {{Harvcoltxt|Nguyễn|Edmondson|1998}}]]

'''Ngang tone:'''

*The ''ngang'' tone is level at around the mid level (33) and is produced with [[modal voice]] [[phonation]] (i.e. with "normal" phonation). Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as "level"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguyễn|1997}} describes it as "high (or mid) level".

'''Huyền tone:'''

*The ''huyền'' tone starts low-mid and falls (21). Some Hanoi speakers start at a somewhat higher point (31). It is sometimes accompanied by [[breathy voice]] (or lax) phonation in some speakers, but this is lacking in other speakers: ''bà'' = {{IPA|[ɓa˨˩]}}.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Nguyễn|Edmondson|1998}} show a male speaker from [[Nam Định Province|Nam Định]] with [[lax voice]] and a female speaker from Hanoi with breathy voice for the ''huyền'' tone while another male speaker from Hanoi has modal voice for the ''huyền''.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as "grave-lowering"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguyễn|1997}} describes it as "low falling".

'''Hỏi tone:'''

* The ''hỏi'' tone starts a mid level and falls. It starts with modal voice phonation, which moves increasingly toward [[tense voice]] with accompanying [[harsh voice]] (although the harsh voice seems to vary according to speaker). In Hanoi, the tone is mid falling (31). In other northern speakers, the tone is mid falling and then rises back to the mid level (313 or 323). This characteristic gives this tone its traditional description as "dipping". However, the falling-rising contour is most obvious in citation forms or when syllable-final; in other positions and when in fast speech, the rising contour is negligible. The ''hỏi'' also is relatively short compared with the other tones, but not as short as the ''nặng'' tone. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as "smooth-rising"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguyễn|1997}} describes it as "dipping-rising".

'''Ngã tone:'''

* The ''ngã'' tone is mid rising (35). Many speakers begin the vowel with modal voice, followed by strong [[creaky voice]] starting toward the middle of the vowel, which is then lessening as the end of the syllable is approached. Some speakers with more dramatic glottalization have a [[glottal stop]] closure in the middle of the vowel (i.e. as {{IPA|[VʔV]}}). In Hanoi Vietnamese, the tone starts at a higher pitch (45) than other northern speakers. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as "chesty-raised"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguyễn|1997}} describes it as "creaking-rising".

'''Sắc tone:'''

*The ''sắc'' tone starts as mid and then rises (35) in much the same way as the ''ngã'' tone. It is accompanied by [[tense voice]] phonation throughout the duration of the vowel. In some Hanoi speakers, the ''ngã'' tone is noticeably higher than the ''sắc'' tone, for example: ''sắc'' = {{IPA|˧˦}} (34); ''ngã'' = {{IPA|˦ˀ˥}} (45). Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as "acute-angry"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguyễn|1997}} describes it as "high (or mid) rising".

'''Nặng tone:'''

* The ''nặng'' tone starts mid or low-mid and rapidly falls in pitch (32 or 21). It starts with tense voice that becomes increasingly tense until the vowel ends in a glottal stop closure. This tone is noticeably shorter than the other tones. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as "chesty-heavy"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguyễn|1997}} describes it as "constricted".

====Southern varieties====
{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}
The Southern variety is similar through all tones except for the ''nặng'' and ''ngã'' tones; the ''nặng'' tone is pronounced [˨˧], while the ''ngã'' tone is merged into the ''hỏi'' tone.

====North-central and Central varieties====

{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

North-central and Central Vietnamese varieties are fairly similar with respect to tone although within the North-central dialect region there is considerable internal variation.

It is sometimes said (by people from other provinces) that people from [[Nghệ An]] pronounce every tone as a nặng tone.

===Eight-tone analysis===

An older analysis assumes eight tones rather than six.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Phạm|2003|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This follows the lead of traditional Chinese phonology.  In [[Middle Chinese]], syllables ending in a vowel or nasal allowed for three tonal distinctions, but syllables ending with {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/k/}} had no tonal distinctions.  Rather, they were consistently pronounced with a short high tone, which was called the [[entering tone]] and considered a fourth tone. Similar considerations lead to the identification of two additional tones in Vietnamese for syllables ending in {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/c/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}.  These are not [[phoneme|phonemically]] distinct from the ''sắc'' and ''nặng'' tones, however, and hence not considered as separate tones by modern linguists and are not distinguished in the orthography.

==Syllables and phonotactics==
According to {{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997}}, there are 4,500 to 4,800 possible spoken syllables (depending on dialect), and the standard national orthography (''[[Quốc Ngữ]]'') can represent 6,200 syllables (''Quốc Ngữ'' orthography represents more phonemic distinctions than are made by any one dialect).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; A description of syllable structure and exploration of its patterning according to the Prosodic Analysis approach of J.R. Firth is given in Henderson (1966).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Henderson|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese [[syllable|syllable structure]] follows the scheme:

:(C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(w)V(G|C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)+T

where
:{| cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" style="background: #f9f9f9;"
| style="vertical-align: top;" |
* C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = initial consonant onset
* w = labiovelar on-glide {{IPA|/w/}}
* V = vowel nucleus
| style="vertical-align: top;" |
* G = off-glide coda ({{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}})
* C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = final consonant coda
* T = tone.
|}

In other words, a syllable has an obligatory nucleus and tone, and can have an optional consonant [[syllable onset|onset]], an optional on-glide {{IPA|/w/}}, and an optional [[syllable coda|coda]] or off-glide.

More explicitly, the syllable types are as follows:

:{| class="wikitable"
|- style="font-size: 85%; background: #f2f2f2;"
! Syllable
! Example
! Syllable
! Example
|-
| V
| ê "eh"
| wV
| uể "sluggish"
|-
| VC
| ám "possess (by ghosts,.etc)"
| wVC
| oán "bear a grudge"
|-
| VC
| ớt "capsicum"
| wVC
| oắt "little imp"
|-
| CV
| nữ "female"
| CwV
| huỷ "cancel"
|-
| CVC
| cơm "rice"
| CwVC
| toán "math"
|-
| CVC
| tức "angry"
| CwVC
| hoặc "or"
|}

'''C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:''' Any consonant may occur in as an onset with the following exceptions:
* {{IPA|/p/}} does not occur in native Vietnamese words

'''w:''' the onglide {{IPA|/w/}} (sometimes transcribed instead as [[labialization]] {{IPA|[ʷ]}} on a preceding consonant):

* does not occur after labial consonants {{IPA|/ɓ, f, v, m/}}
* does not occur after {{IPA|/n/}} in native Vietnamese words (it occurs in uncommon [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] borrowings)

'''V:''' The vowel nucleus V may be any of the following 14 monophthongs or diphthongs: {{IPA|/i, ɨ, u, e, ə, o, ɛ, ə̆, ɔ, ă, a, iə̯, ɨə̯, uə̯/}}.

'''G:''' The offglide may be {{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}}. Together, V and G must form one of the diphthongs or triphthongs listed in the section on Vowels.
* offglide {{IPA|/j/}} does not follow the front vowels {{IPA|/i, e, ɛ, iə̯/}}
* offglide {{IPA|/w/}} does not follow the rounded vowels {{IPA|/u, o, ɔ, uə̯/}}
* with some exceptions (such as ''[[wikt:khuỷu tay#Vietnamese|khuỷu tay]]'' "elbow"), the offglide {{IPA|/w/}} cannot occur if the syllable contains a {{IPA|/w/}} onglide

'''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:''' The optional coda C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is restricted to labial, coronal, and velar stops and nasals {{IPA|/p, t, k, m, n, ŋ/}}, which cannot cooccur with the offglides {{IPA|/j, w/}}.

'''T:''' Syllables are spoken with an inherent [[tone (linguistics)|tone contour]]:
* Six tone contours are possible for syllables with offglides {{IPA|/j, w/}}, closed syllables with nasal codas {{IPA|/m, n, ŋ/}}, and [[open syllable]]s—i.e., those without consonant codas {{IPA|/p, t, k/}}.
* If the syllable is closed with one of the oral stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}}, only two contours are possible: the ''sắc'' and the ''nặng'' tones.

* Less common rimes may not be represented in this table.
* The ''nặng'' tone mark (dot below) has been added to all rimes in this table for illustration purposes only. It indicates which letter tone marks in general are added to, largely according to the "new style" rules of Vietnamese orthography as stated in [[:vi:Quy tắc đặt dấu thanh trong chữ quốc ngữ#Ki.E1.BB.83u m.E1.BB.9Bi|Quy tắc đặt dấu thanh trong chữ quốc ngữ]]. In practice, not all these rimes have real words or syllables that have the ''nặng'' tone.
* The IPA representations are based on [[Help:IPA/Vietnamese|Wikipedia's conventions]]. Different dialects may have different pronunciations.

Below is a table comparing four linguists' different transcriptions of Vietnamese vowels as well as the orthographic representation. Notice that this article mostly follows {{Harvcoltxt|Han|1966}}, with the exception of marking short vowels short.

{{Harvcoltxt|Thompson|1965}} says that the vowels {{IPA|[ʌ]}} (orthographic '''â''') and {{IPA|[ɐ]}} (orthographic '''ă''') are shorter than all of the other vowels, which is shown here with the length mark {{IPA|[ː]}} added to the other vowels. His vowels above are only the basic vowel phonemes. Thompson gives a very detailed description of each vowel's various allophonic realizations.

{{Harvcoltxt|Han|1966}} uses acoustic analysis, including [[spectrogram]]s and [[formant]] measuring and plotting, to describe the vowels. She states that the primary difference between orthographic ''ơ'' &amp; ''â'' and ''a'' &amp; ''ă'' is a difference of length (a ratio of 2:1).  ''ơ'' = {{IPA|/ɜː/}}, ''â'' = {{IPA|/ɜ/}}; ''a'' = {{IPA|/ɐː/}}, ''ă'' = {{IPA|/ɐ/}}. Her formant plots also seem to show that {{IPA|/ɜː/}} may be slightly higher than {{IPA|/ɜ/}} in some contexts (but this would be secondary to the main difference of length).

Another thing to mention about Han's studies is that she uses a rather small number of participants and, additionally, although her participants are native speakers of the Hanoi variety, they all have lived outside of Hanoi for a significant period of their lives (e.g. in [[France]] or [[Ho Chi Minh City]]).

{{Harvcoltxt|Nguyễn|1997}} has a simpler, more symmetrical description. He says that his work is not a "complete grammar" but rather a "descriptive introduction."  So, his chart above is more a phonological vowel chart rather than a phonetic one.

'''Whale watching''' is the practice of observing [[whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s ([[cetacean]]s) in their natural habitat. Whale watching is mostly a recreational activity (cf. [[birdwatching]]), but it can also serve scientific and/or educational purposes.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2009"&gt;Hoyt, E. 2009. Whale watching. In Encyclopedia of Marine Mammals, 2nd Edition (Perrin, W.F., B. Würsig and J.G.M. Thewissen, eds.) Academic Press, San Diego, CA., pp1219-1223.&lt;/ref&gt; A study prepared for [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]] in 2009 estimated that 13 million people went whale watching globally in 2008. Whale watching generates $2.1 billion per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers.&lt;ref&gt;O’Connor, S., Campbell, R., Cortez, H., &amp; Knowles, T., 2009, Whale Watching Worldwide: tourism numbers, expenditures and expanding economic benefits, a special report from the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Yarmouth MA, USA, prepared by Economists at Large. http://www.ifaw.org/whalewatchingworldwide&lt;/ref&gt; The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the [[whaling]] industry about the best use of whales as a [[natural resource]].

== History ==
Organized whale watching started in the United States, when the [[Cabrillo National Monument]] in [[San Diego]] was declared a public venue for observing the migration of [[Gray Whale]]s; the spectacle attracted 10,000 visitors in its first year, 1950.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2009" /&gt; In 1955 the first water-based whale watching commenced in the same area, charging customers $1 per trip to view the whales at closer quarters.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2009" /&gt; The industry spread throughout the western coast of the [[United States]] over the following decade.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2009" /&gt;

In 1971 the [[Montreal Zoological Society]] commenced the first commercial whale watching activity on the eastern side of North America, offering trips in the [[St. Lawrence River]] to view [[Fin Whale|Fin]] and [[Beluga Whale]]s.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2009" /&gt;

In 1984, [[Erich Hoyt]], who had spent much time amongst the [[Orca]]s of British Columbia, published the first comprehensive book on whale watching, ''The Whale Watcher's Handbook'', which [[Mark Carwardine]] called his number one "natural classic" book in ''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Carwardine, M. 1995. ''Natural Classic'', BBC Wildlife, July, p79.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1985 more visitors watched whales from [[New England]] than California. The rapid growth in this area has been attributed to the relatively dense population of [[Humpback Whale]]s, whose [[Cetacean surfacing behaviour|acrobatic behavior]] such as breaching (jumping out of the water) and tail-slapping thrilled observers, and the close proximity of whale populations to the large cities there.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157"&gt;Hoyt, E. 2001. Whale Watching  2001: Worldwide Tourism Numbers, Expenditures, and Expanding Socioeconomic Benefits. International Fund for Animal Welfare, Yarmouth Port, MA, USA, pp. 1-157.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whale watching tourism has grown substantially since the mid-1980s. The first worldwide survey of whale watching was conducted by Hoyt for the [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society]] (WDCS) in 1992. It was updated in 1995 and submitted by the UK government to the [[International Whaling Commission]] (IWC) meetings as a demonstration of the value of living whales.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157" /&gt; In 1999, the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]] (IFAW) asked Hoyt for another expansion, which was published in 2001.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157" /&gt; In 2009 the survey was completed by a team of economists and this report estimated that in 2008, 13 million people went whale watching, up from 9 million ten years earlier.  Commercial whale watching operations were found in 119 countries.  Direct revenue of whale watching trips was estimated at US$872.7 million and indirect revenue of $2,113.1 million was spent by whale watchers in tourism-related businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifaw.org/whalewatchingworldwide|title=Whale Watching Worldwide|work=IFAW – International Fund for Animal Welfare|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whale watching is of particular importance to developing countries. Coastal communities have started to profit directly from the whales' presence, significantly adding to popular support for the protection of these animals from commercial whaling and other threats such as bycatch and ship strikes using the tool of [[marine protected areas]] and sanctuaries. In 2007, the [[Humane Society International]] sponsored a series of workshops to introduce whale watching to coastal Peru and commissioned Hoyt to write a blueprint for high quality, sustainable whale watching.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2012"&gt;Hoyt, E. 2012. Whale Watching Blueprint – I. Setting up a marine ecotourism operation. Nature Editions, North Berwick, Scotland [{{ISBN|978-1-908732-00-2}} (eBook)]&lt;/ref&gt; This manual, later translated into Spanish, French, Indonesian, Japanese, Chinese and Dutch, with co-sponsorship from WDCS, IFAW and Global Ocean was updated in English in 2012 in ebook form.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2012" /&gt;

== Conservation ==
[[File:Whale-watching-australia.jpg|thumb|Whale watching operator giving a talk about whales and their conservation]]
The rapid growth of the number of whale watching trips and the size of vessel used to watch whales may affect whale behavior, migratory patterns and breeding cycles. There is now strong evidence that whale watching can significantly affect the biology and ecology of whales and dolphins.

Environmental campaigners, concerned by what they consider the "quick-buck" mentality of some boat owners, continue to strongly urge all whale watcher operators to contribute to local regulations governing whale watching (no international standard set of regulations exist because of the huge variety of species and populations). Common rules include:

*Minimize speed/"No wake" speed
*Avoid sudden turns
*Minimize noise
*Do not pursue, encircle or come in between whales
*Approach animals from angles where they will not be taken by surprise
*Consider cumulative impact – minimize number of boats at any one time/per day
*Do not coerce dolphins into bow-riding.
*Do not allow swimming with dolphins. (This last rule is more contentious and is often disregarded in, for example, the [[Caribbean]].) In New Zealand, the rules adopted under the [[Marine Mammals Protection Act]] specifically allow swimming with dolphins and seals but not with juvenile dolphins or a pod of dolphins that includes juvenile dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/1992/0322/latest/DLM168840.html Marine Mammals Protection Regulations 1992 §&amp;nbsp;20](b)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Avistamiento.JPG|thumb|Typical bad whale watching in [[El Vizcaíno]], with people trying to enter in contact with the animal]]
In Uruguay, where whales can be watched from the beach, legislators have designated the country's territorial waters as a sanctuary for whales and dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalvoices.org/2013/12/16/uruguay-becomes-a-sanctuary-for-whales-and-dolphins/|title=Uruguay Becomes a "Sanctuary for Whales and Dolphins" · Global Voices|date=2013-12-16|website=Global Voices|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is illegal to be more than 300 metres from a whale.

== Locations ==

Whale watching tours are available in various locations and climates. By area, they are:

=== South Africa ===
[[File:Brydes whale.jpg|thumb|[[Brydes whale]] in [[False Bay]], South Africa]]
In [[South Africa]], the town of [[Hermanus]] is one of the world centers for whale watching. Between May and December [[southern right whales]] come so close to the Cape shoreline that visitors can watch whales from their hotels. The town employs a "whale crier" (cf [[town crier]]) to walk through the town announcing where whales have been seen.

You can watch the whales in Hermanus from the cliff tops, from a boat or the air. Boat-based whale watching tours are available out of the Hermanus New harbour which allows the public to view southern right whales from June till Mid December.  [[Port Elizabeth]] runs a boat-based whale watching tour out of the Port Elizabeth harbour which allows the public to view southern right whales from July to November, humpback whales from June to August and November to January, and Bryde's whales all year round, up-close. Visitors can also see humpback whales from the lighthouse at Cape Recife (the Westerly point of [[Algoa Bay]]), and southern right whales from viewing points along the coast. Boat-based whale watching (and dolphin watching) is also a popular tourist attraction in a number of other coastal towns in South Africa, such as Plettenberg Bay, where the industry is linked to [[conservation biology|conservation]] and education efforts through Plettenberg Bay-based volunteer [[marine conservation]] organisations. [[Plettenberg Bay]] is visited by southern right whales in the winter months and [[humpback whale]]s in the summer months. Bryde's whales are resident throughout the year.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157" /&gt; The other famous centre for whale watching is False Bay. Tours leave Gordon's Bay and follow the coast around the bay. Species include southern right whales, humpback whales and Bryde's whales. Orcas are present during the winter months. Visitors include pilot whales and pygmy sperm whales. Many species of dolphin are encountered including Haveside dolphins. The same tours include great white sharks at Seal Island and the African Penguin Colony at Simon's Town.

=== Southwest Atlantic ===
[[File:Baleia de Bryde.jpg|thumb| [[Brydes whale]] breaching in [[Baia de Castelhanos]], north of [[Sao Paulo]], Brasil]]
In [[Brazil]], humpbacks are observed off [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] in [[Bahia State]] and at the National Marine Park of [[Abrolhos Marine National Park|Abrolhos]] during their breeding season in austral winter and spring. Likewise, southern right whales are observed from shore in [[Santa Catarina State]] and [[Espírito Santo]] during the same season. Mother/calf pairs can come as close to shore as 30 meters (about 100 feet). Income from whale watching bolsters coastal communities and has made the township of [[Imbituba]], the Brazilian "whale capital".

In [[Argentina]], [[Península Valdés]] in [[Patagonia]] hosts (in winter) the largest breeding population of southern right whales, with more than 2,000 catalogued by the [[Whale Conservation Institute]] and [[Ocean Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oceanalliance.org Ocean Alliance website&lt;/ref&gt; The region contains six natural reserves, and is considered to be one of the premier whale watching destinations in the world, particularly around the town of [[Puerto Pirámides]] and the city of [[Puerto Madryn]], as the whales come within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the main beach and play a major part in the large [[ecotourism]] industry in the region.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157" /&gt;

In [[Uruguay]], southern right whales are observable from the beach in two coastal departments – [[Maldonado Department|Maldonado]] and [[Rocha Department|Rocha]] from June to November.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://guruguay.com/whale-watching/|title=5 of the best places to whale-watch in Uruguay|date=2015-06-04|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The points where most sightings in Maldonado are made are [[Punta Colorada]], [[Punta Negra, Uruguay|Punta Negra]], Playa Mansa and Punta Salinas in [[Punta del Este]], and in Rocha off [[La Paloma, Rocha|La Paloma]] and [[La Pedrera, Rocha|La Pedrera]] beaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.descubriendouruguay.com/auc.aspx?176450,1276,0,,0|title=Descubriendo Uruguay – Montevideo Portal|website=www.descubriendouruguay.com|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== West Pacific ===
[[File:Southern Right Whale (Eubalaena australis) (16358018502).jpg|thumb|Southern right whale, offshore from Cheynes, [[Western Australia]] ]]
In [[Western Australia]], whales are watched near [[Cape Naturaliste]] in the south-east [[Indian Ocean]] and at [[Cape Leeuwin]] where the Indian and [[Southern Ocean|Southern]] Oceans meet.

In the [[Southern Ocean]] there are many spots to see whales, both from land or aboard ship. Albany on the south coast of Western Australia the town where the last land based whaling station in the southern hemisphere was located is now home to a thriving whale watching industry. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] a popular site is Logan's Beach at [[Warrnambool, Victoria|Warrnambool]], as well as in the waters off [[Port Fairy, Victoria|Port Fairy]] and [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140914141221/http://www.abc.net.au/oceans/whale/spot.htm|title=Whale Spotting|author=|date=14 September 2014|website=archive.org|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Tasmania]] whales can be seen all along the east coast and even on the [[Derwent River (Tasmania)|River Derwent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourismtasmania.com.au/media/facts/whales|title=Tourism Tasmania :: Whales &amp; Dolphins|author=|date=|website=tourismtasmania.com.au|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Australia]] whales are watched in the [[Great Australian Bight]] Marine Park areas and closer to Adelaide at [[Victor Harbor, South Australia|Victor Harbor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/marine/marine-species/cetaceans/whale-and-dolphin-watching#where |title=Where to see whales and dolphins in the wild |publisher=Commonwealth of Australia |date=2009-01-12 |work=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts |accessdate=2010-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127051045/http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/marine/marine-species/cetaceans/whale-and-dolphin-watching |archivedate=January 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In eastern Australia, whale watching occurs in many spots along the Pacific coast. From headlands, whales may often be seen making their migration south. At times, whales even make it into [[Sydney Harbour]].

New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife took an active role in 2010 during the peak southern whale watching&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nelsonbayhotels.net.au/nelson-bay-activities/interesting-information-whale-watching-port-stephens/|title=Travelicious Australia   –  Nelson Bay Hotels|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; season between May and November with the launch of its whale watching site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildaboutwhales.com.au|title=2015 NSW whale watching season – Wild About Whales – NSW National Parks|author=#|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== East Pacific ===
[[File:Ballena jorobada y ballenato en Bahía Málaga.JPG|thumb|derecha|220px|Humpback whale species in [[Uramba Bahía Málaga National Natural Park]], in [[Colombia]], considered the favorite place for whales give birth to their young, making it a tourist destination]]

In [[Colombia]], the towns of [[Bahía Solano]] and [[Nuquí]] are visited by a large number of Humpback whales from late July to the beginning of October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colombia.travel/en/international-tourist/vacations-holidays-where-to-go/pacific-coast-travel-guide|title=The Pacific|work=Colombia Travel|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In southern Costa Rica, [[Marino Ballena National Park]] has two seasons when whales visit.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In [[Panama]], the [[Pearl Islands]] archipelago receive an estimated 300 humpbacks whale from late June to late November. These had become now the main attraction for whale watching tours starting in [[Panama City]]. In the [[Gulf of Chiriqui]], the World Heritage Site of [[Coiba Island]] National Park and the islands near the town of Boca Chica are offering opportunities for whale watching. Isla Iguana near [[Pedasí township, Los Santos|Pedasi]] is now a popular destination for whale watchers. Several foundations train local community members to perform as guide and captains for whale watching tours.

In [[Ecuador]], from June to September, there are many sites from which large groups of humpback whales can be seen, including Isla de la Plata (AKA Little Galapagos) and [[Salinas, Ecuador|Salinas]], at the tip of the [[Santa Elena Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157" /&gt;

=== Northeast Atlantic ===
Tidal straits, inlets, lagoons, and varying water temperatures provide diverse habitats for multiple cetacean species. Substantial numbers live off the coasts of [[Great Britain]], [[Ireland]], [[Iceland]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], and [[France]]. Commercial car ferries crossing the [[Bay of Biscay]] from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Ireland]] to [[Spain]] and [[France]] often pass by enormous [[blue whales]] and much smaller [[harbor porpoise]]. Land-based tours can often view these animals.

[[Chanonry Point]] is&lt;ref&gt;Independent 18 July 2009; Sea Watch Foundation; &amp; many UK dolphin watching guides&lt;/ref&gt; one of the best spots in the UK to view [[Bottlenose dolphin]] ''Tursiops truncatus''. The dolphins are visible  from the shore, particularly on an incoming tide when they play and fish in the strong currents. Other wildlife, including [[porpoise]]s and [[grey seal]]s, can also regularly be spotted.

Off the south coast of Ireland, [[humpback whale]]s and [[fin whale]]s are regularly seen on [[Whale watching in Ireland|organized whale watching trips]] between July and February. Species seen all year include [[minke whale]]s, [[common dolphin]]s, [[bottlenose dolphin]]s, [[Risso's dolphin]]s, [[Orca]]s and [[harbour porpoise]]s. There is also a resident group of [[bottlenose dolphin]]s in the [[Shannon Estuary]] which attracts tourists all year round.

In [[northern Norway]] ([[Nordland]] and [[Troms]]) [[orca]]s are visible in the [[Vestfjorden (Norway)|Vestfjorden]], [[Tysfjorden]], [[Ofotfjorden]] and [[Andfjorden]] as the [[herring]] gathers in the [[fjord]]s to stay over the winter and off the [[Lofoten islands]] during the summer. At [[Andenes]] on [[Andøya]] in [[Vesterålen]] and around [[Krøttøya]] in [[Troms]], [[sperm whale]]s can be observed year round, summer whale watching trips occur from May till September, winter trips with [[killer whales]] and [[humpback whales]] are offered from October till April. [[Tromsø]] also offers whale watching for sperm whales and other whales. The continental shelf [[Eggakanten]] and deep water where the [[sperm whale]]s congregate, is very close to shore, beginning only {{convert|7000|m|ft|sp=us}} from the [[Andenes]] harbour.

In [[Portugal]]  whale watching is available in the [[Algarve]]. [[Lagos]] and [[Portimão]] are the most important whale watching places. The species observed in this area are: [[bottlenose dolphin]], [[common dolphin]], [[striped dolphin]], [[pilot whale]], [[fin whale]] and [[orca]].

In the middle of the Northeast Atlantic, around the [[Madeira]], the [[Azores]] and the [[Cape Verde]] archipelagos, whale watching is on the increase and popular due to more protection and education. One of the most common whales in these regions is the sperm whale, especially groups of calving females.

In [[Spain]] whale watching is available along the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], the [[Canary Islands]], and in the [[Bay of Biscay]]. [[Tarifa]] is the most important whale watching town in the Strait of Gibraltar; this gateway to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] is also a central point in between the colder waters to the North and the tropical waters off of Africa: a good route for migrating cetaceans. The species observed in this area are: [[bottlenose dolphin]], [[common dolphin]], [[striped dolphin]], [[pilot whale]], [[sperm whale]], [[fin whale]] and [[orca]].

In the Canary Islands it is possible to see these and others, such as the [[blue whale]], [[Bryde's whale]], [[beaked whale]], [[false killer whale]], [[Risso's dolphin]], [[Atlantic spotted dolphin]] and [[rough-toothed dolphin]].

In [[Iceland]] it is possible to see whales in [[Eyjafjörður]], [[Breiðafjörður]], [[Skjálfandi]] and [[Faxaflói]]. The towns offering whale watching are [[Dalvík]], [[Hauganes]], [[Húsavík]], [[Akureyri]], [[Hólmavík]], [[Grundarfjörður]] and [[Reykjavík]].  Most common are [[minke whale]], [[humpback whale]], [[white-beaked dolphin]], [[blue whale]], [[Killer Whale]], [[Sperm Whale]] and [[harbour porpoise]].

=== Northwest Atlantic ===
[[File:Humpback stellwagen edit.jpg|thumb|A humpback breaching in the [[Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary]].  This is a behavior commonly seen in the area.|alt=Photo of whale with head in the air and two-thirds of its body out of the water, falling onto its back]]

In [[New England]] and off the east coast of [[Long Island]] in the United States, the whale watching season typically takes place from about mid-spring through October, depending both on weather and precise location. It is here that the [[humpback whale]], [[fin whale]], [[minke whale]], and the very endangered/heavily protected [[North Atlantic right whale]] are often observed. For generations, areas like the [[Gulf of Maine]] and [[Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary]] (part of the inner waters formed by [[Cape Cod]]'s hooked shape) have been important feeding grounds for these species: to this day a very large portion of the waters off the Eastern Seaboard are rich in [[sand lance]] and other nutritious treats for mothers to teach their calves to feed on.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157" /&gt;

In the past this area was the US whaling industry's capital, particularly [[Nantucket]], an island just off the coast of [[Massachusetts]]. Though strict laws prohibit molestation of these large wild mammals, it is not unknown for the whales to approach whale watching boats uninvited, particularly curious calves and juveniles: it is not unknown in particular, for example, for juvenile humpbacks to approach the boat and [[spyhop]] to get a better look at the humans aboard. In recent years it is also not uncommon to see these animals playing and feeding in harbors, including [[New York City]] or [[Boston]] where fish species of interest to the whales have lately returned in astonishing numbers. As of 2011, an expert from [[Cornell University]] has recorded the vocalizations of six whale species including the humpback, the fin whale, and the massive [[blue whale]] within close proximity of the [[Verrazano-Narrows Bridge]] in the lower portion of [[New York Harbor]] and there is at least one company offering  marine life tours out of The [[Rockaway Peninsula]] in Queens.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|PZAF7bk8Ol4| Whales in the NY Harbor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Httpwwwnydailynewscomny_local_whales_return_to_new_york_city_massive_mammals_appearing_again_in_seas_near_cityhtml"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2011/01/30/2011-01-30_whales_return_to_new_york_city_massive_mammals_appearing_again_in_seas_near_city.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Whales return to New York City: Massive mammals appearing again in seas near city; draws sightseers | first=Barbara | last=Ross | date=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these increasingly frequent visits, new laws address the safety of boaters, commercial fishermen, and the whales themselves: off the coast of Boston, for example, cargo vessels must slow down to protect the much slower [[North Atlantic right whale]] and there is talk of erecting an apparatus for the much more heavily trafficked waters surrounding [[New York City]] that can warn boats of a whale's presence and location so as to avoid accidentally striking the animal.&lt;ref name="Httpwwwnydailynewscomny_local_whales_return_to_new_york_city_massive_mammals_appearing_again_in_seas_near_cityhtml" /&gt; Because of the relative diversity of whales and dolphins within easy access of shore, cetacean research takes place at [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute]], and the [[Riverhead Foundation]] among other centers.

[[File:Whale watching Tadoussac 11.jpg|thumb|Whale watching near Tadoussac]]
Eastern [[Canada]] has many whale watching tours in [[Newfoundland and Labrador]], [[Nova Scotia]] or [[New Brunswick]]. Twenty-two species of whales and dolphins frequent the waters of Newfoundland and Labrador, although the most common are the humpback, minke, fin, Beluga and killer whales.  Another popular whale-watching area is at [[Tadoussac, Quebec]], where Belugas favor the extreme depth and admixture of cold fresh water from the [[Saguenay River]] into the inland end of the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. Humpbacks, minkes, fin and blue whales are also frequently seen off Tadoussac.The  [[Bay of Fundy]] is an equally important feeding ground for large baleen whales and dozens of other creatures of the sea; it shares a population of migrating humpbacks with America and is a known summer nursery for mother right whales with calves.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157" /&gt;

On the east coast of the [[United States]], Virginia Beach, Virginia whale watching is a winter activity from the end of December until the middle of March. Fin, humpback, and right Whales are seen off the Virginia Beach coast on whale watching boat trips run by the [[Virginia Aquarium]] and Marine Science Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitvirginiabeach.com/visitors/explore/articles/whale-watching|title=Whale Watching in Virginia Beach brings giant thrills.|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sightings are mostly of juveniles who stay near the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] where food is plentiful, while the adults continue to the Caribbean to mate.  "Mom" and "Dad" pick up their offspring on the way back north where the whole family summers.

[[File:2017 Sarasota Adventure Kayak Guided Tour Cormorant among the Fleet 04 FRD 9405.jpg|thumb|Ecotour guide stands on a kayak spotting dolphins and manatees, around [[Lido Key]]]]

Ecotourism based on kayak trips is gaining in popularity in warm-water vacation destinations such as [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota Keys]]. Guided kayak trips take kayakers on a tour of the local ecosystem. Kayakers can watch [[dolphin]]s breach and [[manatee]]s eat sea grass, in shallow bay water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kayak Coasting, SRQ Magazine(2015)|url=http://www.srqmagazine.com/articles/146/Kayak-Coasting|accessdate=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The waters surrounding Virginia are also a known migration corridor for the endangered [[North Atlantic right whale]]: Pregnant females must pass through this area around December to reach their birthing grounds down the coast in Georgia and Florida. For these reasons  the waters between the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] and the barrier islands that stretch southwards towards northern Florida must be monitored every winter and spring as mothers give birth to their calves, nurse them, and then ready themselves and their younglings to return north for the cooler waters near New England and Canada.

=== Caribbean ===
About 25 species are observed in the Caribbean waters such as Humpback whales, Sperm whales, beaked whales and many other small cetaceans. Principle whale watch activities : Dominican Republic, East Caribbean islands. Caribwhale, the Caribbean whale watch association, include operators engaged in a sustainable whale watching activity, experts, conservationists and research groups as the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Dalhousie University and Association Evasion Tropicale.

=== Northern Indian Ocean ===
On the South and East Coasts of [[Sri Lanka]] and [[The Maldives]], the industry is growing. During winter and summer, [[sperm whales]] cross the southern tip of the island, migrating to the warmer waters of Southeast Asia. So do [[pygmy blue whale]]s.

Many pygmy blue whales can be seen at Dondra point in Sri Lanka. You can access it through the [[Mirissa]] Harbour or [[Weligama]] Harbour. Whale watching tours can be arranged via many in Sri Lanka.

The sea of [[Mirissa]] is the place where you can see blue whales and few types of dolphins while travelling in Sri Lanka. Many sightings have been reported in November to April in the year.

=== Northeast Pacific ===
[[File:Watching Orcas (Monterey, 2007).jpg|thumb|Watching [[orca]]s in [[Monterey Bay]].]]
[[File:Avistamiento de ballenas jorabadas (Megaptera novaeangliae), Juneau, Alaska, Estados Unidos, 2017-08-17, DD 19.jpg|thumb|Humpback whales watching (''Megaptera novaeangliae''), Juneau, Alaska, United States.]]
On the West Coast of Canada and the United States, excellent whale watching can be found in Alaska (summer), British Columbia, and the San Juan Islands/Puget Sound in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], where orca pods are sometimes visible from shore.  Three types of orca pods can be observed during the summer months in the Northeast Pacific: resident, transient, and offshore killer whales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eaglewingtours.com/orca-killer-whales|title=Killer Whales in Victoria, British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Central Pacific ===
Each winter 4,000 to 10,000 North Pacific humpback whales migrate from [[Alaska]] to [[Hawaii]]. In the vast waters that line Alaska's coast, an encounter with a whale is likely, if not downright predictable. In the summer, after thousands of whales have made their way to the rich feeding grounds of Alaska waters, sightings are extremely common.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Whale watching is possible within as well as outside the [[Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary]]. The best places to see whales in Hawaiʻi is in the protected channels between the Hawaiʻian islands. The best months to see the whales here are January and February when you can expect to see between 2 and 4 whales per 15 minute period,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hawaiihumpbackwhale.noaa.gov/involved/pdfs/Part1_2010OCReport.pdf|title=Sanctuary Ocean Count: Analysis of Humpback Whale Census and Behavior Data 2002–2010|date=2010-07-01|accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; although fluctuations between 0 and 20 sightings are normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lovebigisland.com/big-island-whale-watching/#whale-season|title=Whale sighting statistics for the island of Hawaiʻi|website=Lovebigisland|accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
{{Main|Whaling in the Philippines}}
Many countries in Asia have large whale watching industries.  In 2008 the largest, in terms of number of tourists, were mainland China, Taiwan and Japan.  India, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines and the Maldives also have dolphin watching and some whale watching. China’s dolphin watching is almost entirely focussed on Sanniang Bay in [[Guangxi]].  Taiwan has several whale watching ports on its east coast.  Japan has a range of whale and dolphin watching businesses on all main islands and [[Okinawa]], Zamami, Ogasawara, Mikura-Jima and Miyake-jima.&lt;ref&gt;O’Connor, S., Campbell, R., Cortez, H., &amp; Knowles, T., 2009, Whale Watching Worldwide: tourism numbers, expenditures and expanding economic benefits, a special report from the International Fund for Animal Welfare, Yarmouth MA, USA, prepared by Economists at Large. Page 120 http://www.ifaw.org/whalewatchingworldwide&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Philippines]], over thirty species of whales and dolphins can be observed around [[Pamilacan]] in Central [[Visayas]], [[Davao Gulf]], the northern coast of the province-island [[Babuyan Islands]] in [[Batanes]], [[Pasaleng Bay]], and [[Malampaya Sound]], [[Palawan]]. The Visayas is particularly known area for dolphin sightings, and is home to one of the larger populations of the [[Fraser's dolphin]] in the world. Dolphin species in the Visayas are attracted to fish lures and to commercial fishing operations. In the northernmost province of Batanes, at least 12 species of whales and dolphins has been sighted, making it the single location in the country with the highest cetacean diversity. There seems to be no specific whale watching season in the Philippines, although the calmer waters of the summer season typically provides the best conditions. Some populations, like those of the [[Irrawaddy dolphin]], [[Bryde's whale]], and [[humpback whale]]s in Batanes, appear migratory. Other populations have yet to be studied. Some former coastal whaling communities in the Philippines have also started to generate whale watching income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwf.org.ph/wwf3/news/1|title=WWF-Philippines|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]], [[whale shark]]s can be observed in Nabire of [[Western New Guinea|Papua]] region.

{{Main|Whale watching in Australia|Whale watching in New Zealand}}
[[Kaikoura]] in [[New Zealand]] is a world-famous whale-watching site. The sea around Kaikoura supports an abundance of sea life, with the town's income stemming largely from the tourism generated from whale watching and swimming with or around dolphins. Recently the [[sperm whale]] watching at Kaikoura has developed rapidly and now it is an industry leader, arguably the most developed in the world. The town went into recession after the collapse of [[whaling in New Zealand]]. Its recent development has been used to advocate the benefits of watching whales instead of hunting them.

The [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]] and [[Hervey Bay]] (where the whales stay and rest before migrating) in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] offer reliable whale watching conditions for [[Humpback whale|southern humpback whales]] from the end of June through to the end of November each year. Whale numbers and activity have increased markedly in recent years.{{When|date=October 2012}} [[Sydney]], [[Eden, New South Wales|Eden]], [[Port Stephens (New South Wales)|Port Stephens]], [[Narooma]] and [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]] in [[New South Wales]] are other popular hot spots for tours from May to November.

Southern right whales are seen June–August along the south coast of Australia. They are often readily viewed from the coast around [[Encounter Bay]] near [[Victor Harbor, South Australia|Victor Harbor]] and up to a hundred at a time may be seen from the cliff tops at the head of the [[Great Australian Bight]] near [[Yalata, South Australia|Yalata]].

== Whaling and whale watching ==
The three biggest [[whaling]] nations ([[Canada]], [[Greenland]] and [[Norway]]) have growing whale watching industries. The next four whaling nations ([[Japan]], [[USA]], [[Russia]] and [[Iceland]]) also have whale watching industries. Indeed, Iceland had the fastest-growing whale watching industry in the world between 1994 and 1998.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2009" /&gt;

===Canada===
Whale watching and hunting take place in different regions of Canada. Whale watching happens in the Saint Lawrence River, western Hudson's Bay near Churchill, and British Columbia. Hunting takes place in eastern Hudson's Bay (Nunavik, Quebec), Nunavut and the Beaufort Sea. Researchers have suggested the hunting areas would benefit more from whale watching than hunting, since hunting takes more resources than it earns.&lt;ref name="hoover"&gt;{{Cite journal |authors=Hoover C, Bailey M, Higdon J, Ferguson SH, Sumalia R |date=March 2013 |title=Estimating the Economic Value of Narwhal and Beluga Hunts in Hudson Bay, Nunavut |url=https://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/4261/4242 |journal=The Arctic Institute of North America |volume=66 |pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
[[File:Tysfjord orca 1.jpg|thumb|[[Orca]] near [[Tysfjord]], Norway]]
Enjoyment of observing live cetaceans is rather separated from the domestic whaling industry in Norway; however, whale watching has become a popular national tourist attraction in recent years, especially in [[Andfjorden]] ([[Vesterålen]] and [[Troms]]) and around [[Tromsø]].
*Uniquely, public opinions against whaling showed sudden rises in 2014, when a possibly pregnant [[Minke Whale]] ''Heiko'', named after [[Keiko (orca)|Keiko]] the [[Orca]] and a local cetacean researcher Heike Vester who monitors the whale's safety, successfully shook off whaling vessels by taking refuge in the very shallow fjord of [[Lofoten]], where large whales had not been seen for years; this has provided chances for locals to witness cetaceans at close range. Heiko's appearance soon resulted in an increase in interest among locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=McEnally C.|year=2014|title=After Escaping Whaling Ships, One Whale is Changing Norwegian Attitudes on Whale Meat|url=http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/heiko-the-minke-whale-is-changing-norwegian-attitudes-on-whale-meat/|publisher=The One Green Planet|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time passed, Heiko attracted more domestic and international interest, which has resulted in greater questioning and opposition to the whaling industry in Norway.

=== Japan ===
[[File:Illustration of Whale 1, Edo period, 18th-19th century, color on paper - Tokyo National Museum - DSC05512.JPG|thumb|[[Humpback whale]] illustration from the [[Edo period]], 18th-19th century]]
[[File:2006年5月8日 御蔵島ツアー.jpg|thumb|Resident [[Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin]]s at [[Mikura-jima]]]]
[[Erich Hoyt]] and other conservationists argue that a whale is worth more alive and watched than dead.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157" /&gt; The goal is to persuade their governments to curtail whaling activities. This debate continues at the [[International Whaling Commission]], particularly since whaling countries complain that the scarcity of [[whale meat]] and other products has increased their value. However, the whale meat market has collapsed, and in Japan the government subsidizes the market through distribution in schools and other promotion. In 1997, 2,000 tonnes of whale meat were sold for $30m – a 10-tonne [[Minke Whale]] would thus have been worth $150,000. There is no agreement as to how to value a single animal although its true value is probably much higher. However, it is clear from most coastal communities that are involved in whale watching that profits can be made and are more horizontally distributed throughout the community than if the animals were killed by the whaling industry.&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoyt, E 2001. pp. 1-157" /&gt;
*There have been disputes and skirmishes between whale watching operators and whalers in the nation. For example, whaling was operated right in front of watching vessels, causing malaise among domestic and international passengers on board, and domestic disputes spread on the Internet in [[Nemuro Strait]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mainichi Shimbun]], 2007, ＜クジラ＞ウオッチングの観光客の目前で捕獲 知床沖&lt;/ref&gt; Local tour operators confirmed that targeted species for hunting such as Baird's Beaked Whales and [[Dall's Porpoise]]s are known to disappear or have become harder to approach in the seasons of whaling operations in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Shiretoko Nature Cruise&lt;/ref&gt; Recent notable declines and disappearances (or abandoning of historical habitats) of [[Minke Whale|Minke]] and [[Baird's Beaked Whale]]s in coastal waters caused by commercial and scientific whaling that have been operated in wide ranges off the eastern half of [[Honshu]] and [[Hokkaido]] especially off [[Abashiri]], Gulf of [[Sendai]], and along the coast of [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], caused dramatic decreases in sightings of both species in many areas, enough for whalers to be forced to change their operating ranges, and a watching operator in [[Muroran]] claimed that whaling affected the profits of the operator due to serious declines and low rates of successful minke sightings in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kk-elm.jp/|title=トップページ - イルカ・鯨ウォッチングとフィッシングのKKエルム - 株式会社エルム|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hunting of Baird's Beaked Whales in [[Sea of Japan]] has ceased in recent decades, and the whales have been said to have become more friendly during this period; however, commercial whaling was resumed in Sea of Japan and caused concerns among cetacean conservationists.
*The first whale watching in Japan was conducted in [[Bonin Islands]] in 1998 by a group called "Geisharen ''鯨者連''" which was formed by groups of domestic and international people including both domestic and international celebrities and notable cetacean researchers and conservationists such as [[Roger Payne]], [[Erich Hoyt]], Richard Oliver, [[Jim Darling]], [[John Ford]], [[Kyusoku Iwamoto]] (cartoonist), [[Hutoushiki Ueki]] (science writer), [[Nobuyuki Miyazaki]] (head chief of the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute of The [[University of Tokyo]]), [[Nobuaki Mochizuki]] (one of the world's first whale photographers to record a [[North Pacific right whale]] underwater in 1990 in Bonin Islands), and [[Junko Sakuma]] (freelancer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kyusoku Iwamoto|title=僕が出会った世界のクジラ人たち|url=http://www24.big.or.jp/~kyusoku/w_peapl.htm|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time until before the group reach the destination, the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)]] and other groups and anonymous individuals watched the group's movements and tried to pressure them not to conduct the tour.&lt;ref name=Obara1996&gt;Hideo Obara, 1996, 『人間は野生動物を守れるか』(book), [[Iwanami Shoten, Publishers]]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this movement, those who claimed conserving marine mammals including [[pinniped]]s, or individuals who tried to correct illegal and over-extensive hunts (including [[C. W. Nicol]], who was a sympathizer with Japan's whaling industries) or domestic media that have done reporting assignments&lt;ref&gt;[[Aera (magazine)]], (2008) 『捕鯨ナショナリズム煽る農水省の罪』&lt;/ref&gt; in Japan had been discriminated.&lt;ref name=Obara1996 /&gt; These include a former fisherman who was ostracized from the community, later to become a whale-watching operator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[BlueVoice.org]]|title=From Dolphin Hunting to Dolphin Watching|url=http://www.bluevoice.org/news_dolphinwatching.php|accessdate=2015-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other tours have been operated by former whalers or dolphin hunters in places such as [[Abashiri]] and [[Muroto, Kōchi|Muroto]].

===Russia===
Russian whale watching involves orcas off the Kamchatka peninsula on the edge of the Sea of Okhotsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/the-complete-guide-to-whale-dolphin-watching-1750980.html |title=The Complete Guide To: Whale &amp; dolphin watching |work=The Independent |access-date=2018-12-01 |language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beluga are hunted in the Sea of Okhotsk as well as farther north. Erich Hoyt of the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society has identified other places in Russia to develop whale watching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Whale Watching and Marine Ecotourism in Russia-Туристические экскурсии по наблюдению за китами и морской экотуризм в России |last=Hoyt |first=Erich |publisher=Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society |year=2006 |isbn=ISBN: 1 901386 56 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iceland ===
[[File:BlueWhaleWithCalf.jpg|thumb|[[Blue whale]] with Calf, [[Ólafsvík]], Iceland]]
Upon the resumption of whaling in Iceland in August 2003, pro-whaling groups, such as fishermen who argue that increased stocks of whales deplete fish populations, suggested that sustainable whaling and whale watching could live side-by-side. Whale watching lobbyists, such as [[Húsavík Whale Museum]] curator Asbjorn Bjorgvinsson, counter that the most inquisitive whales, which approach boats very closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, will be the first to be taken. Pro-whaling organisations such as the [[High North Alliance]] on the other hand, claim that some whale-watching companies in Iceland are surviving only because they receive funding from anti-whaling organizations.

=== Portugal ===

In comparison, the government of the [[Azores]] has promoted an economic policy centred on tourism that includes whale watching. With the decline of whaling in the early 1970s in the islands, many of the communities of the archipelago involved in whaling (including villages and towns, specifically on the islands of [[Faial Island|Faial]], [[Terceira]], [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]] and [[Pico Island|Pico]]) were transformed into hubs for whale watching services (that followed the migratory tracts during the summer), while older buildings and factories were re-purposed into museums.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

'''''Wolves Eat Dogs''''' is a [[Crime|crime novel]] by [[Martin Cruz Smith]], set in [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]] in the year 2004. It is the fifth novel to feature Investigator [[Arkady Renko]] and the first one taking place in Russia during the new, independent (post-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]]) era.&lt;ref&gt;Wroe, Nicholas, ''The Guardian'' (March 26, 2005).

==Plot==
[[Russia]] has changed from a [[Communist]] to [[capitalist]] state, and [[Ukraine]] has seceded from the former [[Soviet Union]]. When Pavel "Pasha" Ivanov, one of the leading members of Russia's new [[billionaire]] class, dies in an apparent [[suicide]], Renko investigates. Pasha fell from the balcony of his penthouse apartment, and all the signs point to his having been alone at the time. The only anomaly is a large mound of table [[salt]] in the victim's wardrobe.

Despite interference from his own boss as well as from other persons of power, Renko continues his investigation by questioning Pasha's friends and associates. There is apparently some kind of dark secret in Ivanov's past, and Pasha was always very depressed around [[International Workers' Day|May Day]]. Just before he is forcefully removed from the investigation, Arkady returns alone to Pasha's apartment and reconstructs his movements on the night he died. In the drawer of his bureau, Arkady finds a [[radiation]] [[dosimeter]] wrapped in a blood-stained handkerchief.  Turning it on, he finds that the entire apartment is radioactive, the highest levels coming from the mound of salt.  Arkady concludes that Ivanov did indeed commit suicide but that it was under a form of duress.  A [[HazMat]] team re-examines the apartment and Pasha's body and finds that the salt was mixed with a small quantity of [[cesium chloride]], identical in appearance to table salt but lethally radioactive. After confirming that his apartment was filled with radiation, Ivanov swallowed a large quantity of the salt before jumping, in an attempt to protect anyone entering the apartment later. 

A week after Arkady's discovery, Pasha's business partner Timofeyev is found murdered near [[Pripyat, Ukraine]], in the "dead zone" around the site of the [[Chernobyl disaster]]. Arkady's superior, exasperated at his insubordination, posts him to Ukraine to "investigate" this murder with neither assistance nor resources. He makes the acquaintance of the colorful local community: a team of radiobiologists, various foreign scientists, and a small group of peasant squatters who refuse to leave the area despite the official evacuation. Arkady also becomes the lover of Eva Kazka, a medical doctor assigned to the scientific community. Eva confides to him that she was rendered [[infertile]] and also suffered a long series of operable [[cancer]]s as a result of exposure to radioactive [[fallout]] that blanketed [[Kiev]] while she was marching in a May Day parade after the meltdown.

Eva's ex-husband, Alex Gerasimov, the leader of the radiobiology team, kidnaps Arkady and reveals himself to be the culprit, explaining his motives with relish: Ivanov and Timofeyev were the favorite pupils of Alex's father, Felix Gerasimov, the Soviet Union's leading authority on [[nuclear accident]]s. When the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] telephoned Gerasimov to ask what to do about the meltdown, Gerasimov was too drunk to respond, so Ivanov and Timofeyev took the call, pretending to be relaying Gerasimov's instructions. Based on what the Committee told them, Ivanov and Timofeyev decided that it was unnecessary to either evacuate Pripyat or to cancel the May Day celebrations in Kiev. In other words, Ivanov and Timofeyev were ambitious men who reacted to a crisis the way ambitious men do: by covering up for their boss, and by telling the men in charge what they want to hear - and by doing so, they allowed millions of civilians (including Eva) to be exposed to the fallout. Gerasimov remained untouched by the scandal but later committed suicide.

While Alex admits that Ivanov and Timofeyev were not solely responsible for the disaster, he felt they should be held accountable to some degree. He planted tiny grains of cesium on their clothes and persons, tormenting them before administering fatal doses. He even offered to stop if Ivanov and Timofeyev would return to Chernobyl and admit their responsibility, but ''"they were too ashamed to save their own lives."'' After Ivanov's death, Timofeyev tried to save himself by returning to the scene of his crime, though Alex says he doesn't know who murdered him. Having killed his assistants in cold blood, Alex prepares to kill Arkady to cover his tracks when he is shot down by the vengeful sister of one of the assistants. 

Arkady reports that Pasha's case has been solved, though the murders of Timofeyev and Alex Gerasimov remain open. He is recalled to Moscow. Eva leaves with him, and the couple adopt an orphaned boy named Zhenya whom Arkady has been mentoring at a local shelter.

A few months later, they make a one-day trip back to Pripyat to visit some of their local friends, an elderly farmer couple who have lived in the same place all their lives, and whose grandchildren died from [[radiation poisoning]]. Seeing the husband, Roman, slaughter a pig in almost exactly the same way as Timofeyev was killed, Arkady and Eva realize that it was Roman who killed Timofeyev, and why, but refrain from reporting it to the authorities.

==Explanation of the title==
There are a number of possible interpretations of the title:
*Wolves are said to attack domesticated canines out of the sentiment that the dogs have betrayed their own species by living with and depending on humans for their survival. The contemptible dogs have unforgivingly traded their priceless freedom for food, security and other creature comforts.
*The murderer, when revealed, describes himself as a wolf, not so much for any violence or viciousness in his character, but because he considers himself a true predator: attacking his victims, and disposing of his unreliable associates, without compunction.  One of these associates, on his deathbed, mentions playing "the Wolf" in a school production of "[[Peter and the Wolf]]," and fancied himself as a wolf, "until I met a real one."
*The title can also be taken as a metaphor describing the corruption surrounding Arkady; the "wolves" being large organizations or powerful men that eat the "dogs" (meaningless men like Arkady Renko), who are insignificant in society and prove to be nothing more but an obstacle that must be eradicated. As wolves hunt in packs to overpower their prey, so do businesses and large organizations in this novel.

==Allusions to real-life history, persons, or places==
*Most of the novel takes place in the "[[Zone of alienation|dead zone]]" around the site of the [[Chernobyl disaster]].  To "amuse" a company at dinner one night, Alex tells his own dramatic story of exactly how the meltdown occurred.
*Oddly, the novel predates by several years the [[Alexander Litvinenko poisoning|poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko]], which bears certain similarities to the attacks on Pasha Ivanov.
*Though there are several radioactive isotopes found at the site of the Chernobyl disaster, [[Caesium-137]] is the most common (which may be why the killer chooses it to attack Ivanov and Timofeyev).
