== Work ==
Federgruen is known for his work in the development and implementation of planning models for supply chain management and logistical systems. His work on scenario planning is widely cited, the field has gained prominence as computers now allow the processing of large masses of complex data.&lt;ref&gt;Theory and Practice of Leadership, , by Roger Gill , 2006, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Management Consulting: Delivering An Effective Project, by Philip A. Wickham 2004, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

His work on supply chain models has wide applications in, for example, flu vaccine and  the risks of relying too heavily on a single vaccine supplier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/ideasatwork/magazinefeature?top.showsendarticle=yes&amp;main.view=articles.detail&amp;main.id=59882]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also an expert on  applied probability models and dynamic programming. In the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Federgruen was quoted on the subject of applying predictive models to minimize risk in disaster situations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/hermes/fall2005/article_bestlaidplans.cfm Columbia Business School: Hermes Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728212656/http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/hermes/fall2005/article_bestlaidplans.cfm |date=2007-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bridge life-cycle cost analysis''' (BLCCA), is [[Whole-life cost|life-cycle cost analysis]] for individual [[bridge]]s assuming a planning or [[time horizon]] as the period of time over which all costs are to be estimated.

Transportation officials consider BLCCA important for assisting with investment decisions.

The calculation of life-cycle costs depends on the choice of a distinct time period (planning time horizon) over which operations and maintenance costs are accrued, discounted ([[Net present value|NPV]]), and compared with cost of [[Financial capital|capital]].

{{refimprove|date=January 2018}}
A '''can seamer''' is a machine used to seal the lid to the can body. The lid or "end" is usually tinplated steel while the body can be of [[metal]] (such as cans for beverages and soups), [[paperboard]] ([[whisky]] cans) or [[plastic]].

The seam formed is generally leak proof, but this depends on the product being canned. The seam is made by mechanically overlapping the two layers to form a hook.

Different parameters of the hook are measured and monitored to check the integrity of the seam under different conditions.

The shape of the [[double seam]] is determined by the shape of the seamer roll profile and the relative position. During the can seaming process, the seamer chuck holds the can while the rolls rotate around it. Initially, the first operation roll folds the lid (end) and then the second operation rolls tightens the resulting seam.

The first operation seam is critical to avoid problems like wrinkles (tightness issues) and leaks. The shape of the seam is determined by the shape of the first operation roll, the second operation roll, their relative positions and distances, lifter height, lifter pressure. Any damage or problems to the seamer or seamer tools can cause severe problems to the double seam like seam bumps, wrinkles, sharp seams, and open seams.

== Can seamer setup ==
Seamer setup is usually done by an experienced individual, typically using a lifter height gauge, lifter height pressure gauge, and feeler gauges (small pieces of metal for go/no go testing of the distances between the roll and chuck toolings). New products like the [[clearance gauge]] are able to let even novice users adjust seamers and optimize them, as well as locate problems with broken/damaged tooling, shank/bushing issues, seamer adjustment issues, or broken bearings.

== Applications ==

Some common can seamer applications include, but are not limited to:

* Cans
* Automotive filters ([[oil]] and fuel)
* Capacitors
* Certain automotive mufflers (silencers)
* Drums

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7349">'''CECOSESOLA''' ('''Central de las cooperativas de Lara''', '''Cooperatives of Social Services of Lara State''') is a hierarchy-free, solidary association of [[cooperatives]] in [[Venezuela]], with emphasis on cultivation and distribution of food and health care.&lt;ref name=Maheshvarananda&gt;{{cite web | url=https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/11034 | title=The Silent Success Of Cooperatives In The Bolivarian Revolution | publisher=[[Venezuelanalysis.com]] | date=November 21, 2014 | accessdate=July 19, 2017 | author=[[Dada Maheshvarananda]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History ==

The umbrella organization of cooperatives for social services in the [[Lara, Venezuela|state of Lara]] was founded in late in 1967. The first project of CECOSESOLA was a [[funeral home]]. It is now the largest in the region. The Institute operates its own [[coffin]] production.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

About fifty-based organizations with a total of 20,000 members (employees and users) are connected to the network. 1,200 Cooperative fashionistas work as "full-time" (trabajadores asociados) at CECOSESOLA. They get their livelihood directly from the total composite.&lt;ref&gt;"CECOSESOLA - On the Way", published by Die Buchmacherei, Berlin 2012 - Preface pp. 10/11&lt;/ref&gt; They pay a weekly amount which is mentioned in the definition of [[wage labor]] "advance" (anticipo). The height is about twice the [[government]]-set [[minimum wage]]. This advance is based on people's requirements, so it is not the same for everyone. Those with children, for example, get more. In 2010, the turnover of the company amounted to 430 million Bolivares - around 100 million U.S. dollars.

===Projects===

* [[Barquisimeto]]: The organization operates three weekly markets, where every week 55,000 families – about a quarter of the [[urban area|urban]] population – provide them with [[fruits]], [[vegetables]] and [[foods]]. 450 tonnes of fruit and vegetables are sold weekly. The prices are on average 30 percent lower than those of privately operated markets. In addition, there is a shop for home appliances and furniture, where members can buy the products with installment payments without the usual high [[interest rates]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the six projects of 190,000 [[health care]] treatments are performed per year. In 2009, the newly built health center was inaugurated in CICS. Here, alternative treatments such as [[acupuncture]] and [[massages]] are offered, but also [[surgical procedures]] and [[laboratory]] and [[X-ray]] examinations. The prices are 60 percent below those of private [[hospitals]]. For members of the cooperatives certain treatments are free.

The cooperative also includes farms: Twelve organizations in the states of Lara and Trujillo with over 200 small farms (2-3 hectares) supply the markets. In some, companies will try to replace [[agrochemicals]] with [[biological crop protection]]. Small production cooperatives produce foods that are sold in the markets - [[bread]], whole grain [[pasta]], cereals, [[tomato]] sauce, herbs, spices, [[honey]], fruit pulp etc. There is also a [[credit union]] and other financing and a Solidarity Fund.

==How does CECOSESOLA work?==

There is a high turnout of customers whose needs are not always discussed with them outside. Some of the customers are also involved in the cooperatives.

Inside the most striking feature is the absence of [[hierarchical]] positions. "All members can always get involved at all levels with the same rights. [[Consensus decision-making|Decisions in consensus]] and met again for discussion, if someone declares his non-acceptance in hindsight, was independent of whether the person involved in the decision or absent. In 2011, there were about 3,000 of the weekly meetings in individual and cooperative projects instead, and 300 cross-meetings."&lt;ref&gt;"CECOSESOLA - On the Way", published by Die Buchmacherei, Berlin 2012 - Preface p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no governing body, no managing director and no supervision. You trying to make sure that the meetings are not a substitute for, the management or the manager. Each person or group to take responsibility for decisions that must be made in everyday life. consensus means for the members otherwise than unanimity. For the unanimity all members of a group or organization must be present. This corresponds to a vote in which all are in favor. A consensus decision is when they 'corresponds to, We, that is the criteria that you share in this moment -. Whether this decision was made by a person, a group or an informal gathering this kind, to make decisions, can obviously lead to chaos and missteps that may attract large economic losses. But all economic losses are by far compensated by the flexibility and dynamism that results in the organization, in that we free ourselves from the cultural [[shackles]] that restrict all our capacities and creative potential."&lt;ref&gt;"CECOSESOLA - On the Way", published by Die Buchmacherei, Berlin 2012, S.127/128, translation of a brochure of CECOSESOLA from 2009: "Hacia un colectivo de cerebro reuniones ... a espacios de encuentro?"&lt;/ref&gt;

CECOSESOLA trying to take the place of [[power (social and political)|power]] and enforcement of personal interests in an opposite process. Dismantle hierarchies, making information accessible to all, build trust relationships and to establish its own identity on the collective power of [[solidarity]].  The experience of CECOSESOLA can explain different concepts:

:The productive force "cooperation" leads to increased efficiency.
:The way of cooperation and cohesion increased motivation of employees.
:The construction of network structures based on trust and cooperation supports the long-term survival of cooperatives.

Here, the forms that people interact with each other like here in relationship, beyond the sphere of work and production. Perhaps it is here rather a different way of life that needs no justification for efficiency criteria. "When we succeed, the self-organization of living with respect for others and the Other, we will do by and by this momentum to our own, and our behavior will be consistent with the process of life. This opens us the possibility to go beyond the dutiful ecological behavior that will get only from a utilitarian nature, which is at the service of man. We have the opportunity to be ecologically from scratch, since the nature then some of us will not be Separated: We are all natural Maybe we are just before opting for a form of life.. A choice that requires us to overcome the hierarchical relationship of power over the others that are part of our cultural heritage. An election in which it is clear that the takeover may be no alternative but to change the world ..... "&lt;ref&gt;"CECOSESOLA - On the Way", published by Die Buchmacherei, Berlin, 2012, p 104, translation from a brochure of CECOSESOLA from 2007: "Construyendo aqui y ahora que el mundo queremos"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corporate law in [[Vietnam]]''' was originally based on the [[French company law|French commercial law]] system. However, since Vietnam's independence in 1945, it has largely been influenced by the ruling [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Communist Party]]. Currently, the main sources of Corporate Law are the Law on Enterprises,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vietnamlaws.com/freelaws/Lw13na12Jun99Enterprises%5BXIV1033%5D.pdf Law on Enterprises]&lt;/ref&gt; the Law on Securities&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telchar.com/capmkts/VietnamSecuritiesLaw2006English.pdf Law on Securities]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Law on Investment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vietnamlaws.com/freelaws/Lw59na29Nov05CIL%5B10Apr06%5D.pdf Law on Investment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of corporate law and sources of law in Vietnam==

===The post-independence period (1945–1986)===
Corporate law in Vietnam is largely influenced by French laws due to its colonial past. After the [[1954 Geneva Conference]], Vietnam separated into two zones: the North and the South. In 1980, after the North took control of the South, the country adopted a [[Central planning|centrally-planned]] economy, with officials discouraging private commerce.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, F. R. (1987). Vietnam Country Study. Retrieved August, 2011, from http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/vntoc.html&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:History of Vietnam Corporate Law.tiff|thumb|600px|History of Vietnam Corporate Law]]

===Doi Moi (post-1986)===
In 1986, the government initiated economic reforms ([[Doi Moi]]) to the corporate sector to reinvigorate the ailing economy. These policies aimed to reverse most of policies that led to economic crises in the 1970s and 1980s following the [[Vietnam War]]. Development of the [[private sector]] was encouraged and the economy was liberalized in hopes of increasing the potential for economic development. In 1987, the Law on Foreign Investment was passed, allowing foreign investors into the country.&lt;ref&gt;Asian Development Bank. (2011). Economy of Vietnam - An Overview. Retrieved August, 2011, from 44th Annual Meeting, Board of Governors, Asian Development Bank: {{cite web |url=http://adb2011.vn/adb2011/categorynews/Economy/567/52 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110326053556/http://adb2011.vn/adb2011/categorynews/Economy/567/52 |archivedate=2011-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, the Law on Private Enterprises and Companies Law were introduced to boost economic development. They were subsequently superseded by the Law on Enterprises (LOE) in 1999, which introduced Partnerships in addition to [[Limited Liability Company|Limited Liability Companies]] and [[Public company|Shareholding Companies]]. Within three years of implementing the LOE, over 70,000 enterprises were registered as compared to just over 40,000 for the previous nine years.&lt;ref&gt;Bai, X. H. (2006). Vietnamese Company Law: The Development and Corporate Governance Issues. Bond Law Review , 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Law on Investment (replacing Law on Foreign Investment) and a new LOE were enacted in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Bai, X. H., &amp; Walker, G. (2005). Transitional Adjustment Problems in Contemporary Vietnamese Company Law. Journal of International Banking Law and Regulation , 567-576.&lt;/ref&gt; These statutes are expected to further strengthen Vietnam's economy and its potential for international economic integration.

Legislation - Originated from civil law passed down from the French.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, P. (2007). Borrowing Court Systems - The Experience of Socialist Vietnam. Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Appendix 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of business enterprise==

The LOE governs business enterprises in Vietnam. Enterprises in all economic sectors have to satisfy the stipulated conditions accounted for in Article 7(2).
There are 4 forms of business enterprises.

===Limited liability company (LLC)===
[[File:LLC.tiff|thumb|left|380px|Structure of Limited Liability Companies]]
An LLC is established by members' capital contribution to the company. As a LLC is a legal entity separate from the owners, the owner(s)'s liability for the firm's debts and obligations is limited to his capital contribution.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 38 and 63, [http://www.vietnamlaws.com/freelaws/Lw13na12Jun99Enterprises%5BXIV1033%5D.pdf Law of Enterprises] 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

LLCs exist in two forms - one-member LLC, or multi-member LLC. The former is owned by an organisation/individual,&lt;ref&gt;Article 63, Law of Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; while the latter allows for two to fifty members.&lt;ref&gt;Article 38, Law of Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The management structure consists of a Members' Council (MC), Chairperson of the MC and Director. Where there are more than 11 members in LLC, an Inspection Committee (IC) must also be established.&lt;ref&gt;Article 46, Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shareholding Company (SC)===
[[File:Shareholding Company.tiff|thumb|390px|Structure of a Shareholding Company]]
An SC is an entity with at least three [[shareholder]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Article 77(1)(b), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; where ownership of the firm depends on the number of shares they hold. It is the only form of enterprise that can issue securities to raise capital.

Shareholders' liability is limited to their capital contribution;&lt;ref&gt;Article 77(1)(c), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; however, shareholders can be personally liable where the company is substantially [[undercapitalised]] on formation.

The management structure consists of a shareholders' meeting (SM), a board of management (BOM), a director and an IC.&lt;ref&gt;Article 95, Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnership===
A [[partnership]] comprises at least two co-owners jointly conducting business under one common name,&lt;ref&gt;Article 130(1)(a), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; with at least one co-owner being an individual. In a partnership, there can be both limited&lt;ref&gt;Article 130(1)(c), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and unlimited liability&lt;ref&gt;Article 130(1)(b), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; partners.

The Partners' Council, consisting of all partners, is the highest body in the partnership with the right to resolve all business affairs, such as the admission of new partners.&lt;ref&gt;Article 135, Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private enterprises===
A [[Privately held company#Privately owned enterprise|private enterprise]] is a firm owned by an individual, who is its legal representative&lt;ref&gt;Article 143(4), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The owner has total discretion in making business decisions,&lt;ref&gt;Article 143(1), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and is liable for its operations to the extent of all his [[assets]].&lt;ref&gt;Article 141(1), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual can only establish one private enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Article 141(3), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules concerning ownership of businesses==
The government has rules to restrict certain lines of businesses,&lt;ref&gt;Article 7, Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and will periodically review business conditions and proceed with any changes accordingly.

The rights and obligations of business enterprises are provided for in Articles 8–10; but might differ slightly should the enterprise offer public services or products.
[[File:Ownership Differences.tiff|thumb|500px|Ownership Differences]]

===Limited liability company (LLC)===
Owners in LLCs have to contribute capital in full and on time. In one-member LLCs, the owner will be responsible for [[debt]]s and other property obligations if he fails to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Article 65, Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in multi-member LLCs, members are to contribute capital in the type of asset, and any change is subject to the consent of other members.&lt;ref&gt;Article 39(1) Law of Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Owners in LLCs can assign a share of their capital contribution except where prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;Such prohibitions are laid down in Article 45(6).&lt;/ref&gt; In one-member LLCs, this is the only way for the owner to withdraw capital.

===Shareholding Company (SC)===
The government provides specific provisions on the forms of offering [[Security (finance)|securities]] to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Article 11, Securities Law 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In offering securities, SCs are subject to conditions laid out in the Securities Law, such as the requirement for a paid-up [[charter capital]] at the time of offering of at least [[VND]] 10 billion in book value.&lt;ref&gt;Article 12, Securities Law 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Founding shareholders can assign their registered ordinary shares to each other if they hold 20% of ordinary shares for 3 years from the date of the Business Registration Certificate. Approval at the SM will allow a non-founding shareholder to purchase registered ordinary shares from a founding shareholder.

===Partnerships===
If an unlimited-liability partner fails to contribute capital accordingly, other partners may be held liable to compensate the partnership for the damage. However, where the limited liability partner fails to contribute capital accordingly, the unpaid amount will become a debt owed by that partner to the partnership.

An unlimited liability partner can transfer his share of capital in the partnership to another person only with the consent of the other unlimited liability partners.

===Private enterprises===
The owner must register his investment capital in the firm, and record changes in the [[investment capital]] in the accounts.

==Rules concerning corporate governance==

===Regulation of governing bodies===

====Ownership====
The ownership powers of the enterprises are vested in the MC/Chairman for LLCs&lt;ref&gt;Article 47(1), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 68(1), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and in the SM and BOM for SCs.&lt;ref&gt;Article 96(1), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 108(1), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; They are the highest decision making bodies for each enterprise and are tasked with the passing of resolutions, amending the Company Charter and setting out the general direction of the Company, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Article 47(2), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 96(2), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 104(2), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A resolution can only be passed with a minimum percentage approval.&lt;ref&gt;Article 52(2), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 68(6), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Such a rule is put in place to ensure the interests of all shareholders are protected.

====Executive====
The Director, appointed by the ownership institutions of the enterprise, has Executive powers and oversees the day-to-day running of the Company for SCs&lt;ref&gt;Article 116 (2), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and LLCs.&lt;ref&gt;Article 55(1), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 70(1), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He is legally responsible for the implementation of delegated rights and obligations. Directors of LLCs cannot be affiliated to any member of the MC,&lt;ref&gt;Article 70(3), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; ensuring the separation of powers between the company's ownership and management.

However, for SCs, the LOE permits persons to take up dual roles as Director and chairman of the BOM.&lt;ref&gt;Article 111 (1), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; One survey found that 75% of chairmen of a BOM were also the Directors of their company. Furthermore, other members of the BOM are often majority shareholders and managers of the company. This highlights an indefinite differentiation between ownership and management.

====Inspection====
The LOE prescribes the formation of a mandatory IC to monitor and check the ownership and executive powers.&lt;ref name="article_71"&gt;Article 71, Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 121, Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the IC must minimally possess professional qualifications or [[accounting]]/[[auditing]] work experience,&lt;ref name="article_71_4"&gt;Article 71(4), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and cannot be related to members of the ownership or executive bodies.&lt;ref name="article_71_4"/&gt; This ensures impartiality and prevents conflict of interests. However, in SCs, while members of the IC cannot hold any managerial positions in the company, they are allowed to own company shares or be a general employee of the Company.&lt;ref&gt;Article 122(2), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Individual liability for corporate actions===

====Ownership Representatives====
Where the MC/Chairman of the LLC fails to convene a requested meeting within 15 days of the request, he must bear personal liability for any damage that may result to the company.&lt;ref&gt;Article 50(5), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Executive====
The LOE prescribes that the Director of a LLC may be sued by shareholders should he fail to perform his obligations and duties.&lt;ref&gt;Article 41(1g), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in a SC, there are no such provisions to grant the shareholders power to bring an action against Directors who do not perform their duties. While the law lays out the [[fiduciary]] duties of the Directors, it does not provide a way to enforce these duties. This has led to the criticism that the interests of shareholders of SCs are not adequately protected.&lt;ref&gt;Le Minh, Toan and Walker, Gordon (2008) "Corporate Governance of Listed Companies in Vietnam," Bond Law Review: Vol. 20: Iss.2, Article 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inspectors====
The IC is legally responsible for the implementation of its rights and duties.&lt;ref name="article_71"/&gt; The LOE however does not specify the circumstances under which the IC will be deemed to have neglected its rights and duties and hence be legally liable.

===Restrictions on transactions with owners/shareholders===
The LOE prescribes certain regulations to control and approve large related-party transactions. For SCs, if a [[loan agreement]]/contract is valued at at least 50% of the company's total assets, it is subject to approval by the BOM.&lt;ref name="article_120_2"&gt;Article 120(2), Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

All related-party transactions must be approved by the shareholders.&lt;ref name="article_120_2"/&gt; 'Related-party' include managers of the enterprise or family members of shareholders,&lt;ref name="article_4_17"&gt;Article 4(17), Law on Enterprises 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and related-party transactions are business arrangements between two parties with prior relationships.

Management personnel have to disclose details of their and their related parties' ownership interests in other enterprises; the latter applies where the related-party holds more than 35% of charter capital.&lt;ref name="article_4_17"/&gt; These measures ensure that personal interests do not override the company's interests. In addition, shareholders or directors related to the transaction cannot vote on the deal.&lt;ref&gt;Article 120 Section 3, Law on Enterprises 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The LOE, however, does not provide for an external checking mechanism for related-party transactions. The BOM has the sole and unfettered right to give approval to related-party transactions, and this lack of an extra checking mechanism has resulted in a lack of investor protection in Vietnam.{{#tag:ref|In a 2006 World Bank research, Vietnam tallied a score of 0 in the extent of director liability index, a stark contrast to the average score of 4.4 attained for East Asia and Pacific economies.&lt;ref&gt;Le Minh, Toan and Walker, Gordon (2008) "Corporate Governance of Listed Companies in Vietnam," Bond Law Review: Vol. 20: Iss.2, Article 6.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

==Foreign investment==
Both foreign and domestic investments are similarly treated under the LOI. Foreign investors and expatriates working for foreign-invested businesses or business co-operation contract can remit investment capital, profits and other assets, and their income abroad respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam - A Guide for Business and Investment, 2008, PriceWaterHouseCoopers&lt;/ref&gt;
There are four types of foreign investment in Vietnam:&lt;ref&gt;Article 21, [http://www.vietnamlaws.com/freelaws/Lw59na29Nov05CIL%5B10Apr06%5D.pdf Law on Investment] 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
*100% Foreign Owned Enterprise (FOE);
*Joint-Venture Enterprise (JV);
*Business Co-operation Contract (BCC); and
*Building–Operation–Transfer/Building– Transfer–Operation/Building–Transfer. (BOT/BTO/BT)

===Foreign owned enterprise===
Foreign investors may establish economic organizations or LLCs in the form of 100% capital of foreign investors.&lt;ref&gt;Article 21 (1), Law on Investment 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint venture===
Foreign investors may enter a [[joint venture]] where there is at least one foreign and one domestic investor.&lt;ref&gt;Article 21 (2), Law on Investment 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The operational duration of a Foreign Invested Project cannot exceed 50 years; where the Government thinks it necessary to continue, it cannot exceed 70 years.&lt;ref&gt;Article 52, Law on Investment 2005&lt;/ref&gt; FOEs are recommended over joint ventures and they can be formed quickly through application of investment licenses. Joint ventures face problems such as corruption and the lack of control over the business.&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam –Open for Business?, http://www.business-in-asia.com/vn_industrial.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business cooperation contract===
Foreign investors may invest in contractual agreements with Vietnamese partners to cooperate on specific business activities. This form of investment does not constitute a new legal entity and the investors have unlimited liability for BCC's debts.&lt;ref&gt;Article 21 (3), Law on Investment 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===BOT/ BTO/ BT===
A foreign investor can sign such a contract with a State body to implement projects for expansion and modernization of [[infrastructure]] projects in the sectors stipulated by the Government.&lt;ref&gt;Article 21 (4), Law on Investment 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Article 23 (2), Law on Investment 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis and assessment of current rules==

===Comparison with other jurisdictions===

====Flexibility in choosing corporate governance structures====
Although Vietnam's corporate law adopted Anglo-American legal principles, [[common law]] jurisdictions like the US grant businesses greater flexibility in choosing corporate governance structures. The LOE, however, imposes mandatory internal governance structures.&lt;ref&gt;Katharina Pistor et al, 'The Evolution of Corporate Law: A Cross‐Country Comparison' (2003) 23(4) University of Pennsylvania, Journal of International Economic Law 791, 19,&lt;/ref&gt; This has been criticised for failing to give companies the latitude to adapt their corporate governance structures to suit their needs.&lt;ref&gt;Xuan Hai, Bui, and Nunoi, Chihiro, Corporate Governance in Vietnam: A System in Transition, Hitotsubashi Journal of Commerce and Management 42 (2008), pp.45-65.&lt;/ref&gt;
Anglo-American law allows directors to delegate their powers to a sub-committee or another person.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ss 198C(1), 198(1) of the Corporation Act 2001 (C th) of Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in Vietnam, subcommittees can be established to assist the BOM, but the latter cannot delegate its powers to the former. The imposition of mandatory corporate governance structures without delegation of powers leads to less flexibility and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. American Law Institute, Principles of Corporate Governance: Analysis and Recommendations (Vol. 1, 1994) s.305, Part III‐A (ss 3A.01‐3A.05).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jursidictions.tiff|thumb|500px|Comparisons between jurisdictions]]

====Separation of supervisory and management bodies====
Internal governance structures are important in supervising the company managers. In US, the supervisory body is often subsumed within the single-tiered [[board of directors]], whereas in Vietnam, the IC is an independent body. Through separation of supervisory and management functions, the Vietnamese corporate law model, at least theoretically, ensures that the BOM is held to a greater degree of accountability by an independent checking mechanism.
However, there is no hierarchy for the Vietnamese IC and BOM. This contrasts with the German two-tiered board model for SCs, with an [[Aufsichtsrat]] (supervisory board) which is hierarchically superior to the [[Vorstand]] (management board). Because the IC is not recognised as a superior institution, it has limited authority over the BOM. In practice, many supervisors are low level employees within the company. Although institutionally independent, the members of the IC are, in reality, dependent on their employers for their livelihoods, and therefore serve as a weak check against mismanagement by the BOM or Director.

====Vesting of executive powers====
In Vietnam, executive powers are vested solely in the Director while in Germany, executive powers are shared equally amongst members of the Vorstand. This encourages consensus decision-making in German companies as responsibility is shared amongst all members of the Vorstand.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan P. Charkham (1994). Keeping Good Company: A Study of Corporate Governance in Five Countries. Oxford University Press. pp. 14–21&lt;/ref&gt; This can be further contrasted with Japan, where the corporate law does not designate any positions for corporate officers (the Vietnamese equivalent of Director) and executive powers are largely retained within the Board of Directors (the Vietnamese equivalent of BOM).&lt;ref&gt;http://finance.wharton.upenn.edu/~allenf/download/Vita/Japan-Corporate-Governance.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems===

====Understanding corporate governance and role of management structures====
Corporate governance in Vietnam is seen more as a management framework rather than a system for accountability and protecting minority shareholders. In particular, the LOE does not clearly mandate the separation of ownership and management. Separation of ownership and management promotes [[accountability]] by allowing managers to be objectively appraised. On the other hand, owners who serve as managers will be more likely to pursue their own interests, possibly at the expense of the interests of minority shareholders.

====State-owned enterprises====
Following the introduction of LOE, SOEs were converted to single-organisation-owned LLCs.&lt;ref&gt;Decree No. 95/2006/ND-CP of Government dated Sept. 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; However, the state retains many powers and is directly involved in management decision-making. Government officials are thus selected to run companies for political reasons. Their lack of business expertise and [[profit motive]] has led to inefficiency and mismanagement of large [[state-owned enterprise]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://swopec.hhs.se/eijswp/papers/eijswp0228.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928011551/http://swopec.hhs.se/eijswp/papers/eijswp0228.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, since only up to three supervisors can be appointed, there is limited monitoring on the company managers. In 2010, the state-owned shipbuilding firm [[Vinashin]] ended in [[bankruptcy]], following mismanagement and false reporting of [[financial statement]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dztimes.net/post/politics/poor-governance-led-to-vinashin-s-financial-wrongdoings.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the inadequate monitoring and auditing mechanisms for SOEs.

====Investor protection====
The LOE is increasingly recognizing the interests of minority shareholders by introducing new avenues for them to hold the management accountable.{{#tag:ref|These new measures includes basic rights of shareholders such as attending the General Shareholders' Meeting, voting on the basis of one share one vote, selecting senior managers and supervisors and having priority in making additional capital contributions, among others.|group=Note}} Nonetheless, with stringent prerequisites including higher shareholding requirements and the need to show evidence before minority shareholders can call for a shareholders' meeting, investor protection in Vietnam is still limited compared to other jurisdictions.{{#tag:ref|These other jurisdictions include China, Spain, Ireland, Italy, Australia, Germany and New Zealand.|group=Note}}
Other shortcomings of the LOE include limited opportunities for shareholders to request a meeting, no imposition of legal responsibilities on board members who approve unfair transactions, no shareholders' rights to sue those in the corporate governance structure (for SCs), and a shortage of provisions to require disclosure obligations and directors to avoid [[insolvent trading]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; CrimethInc. emerged in the mid-1990s,&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; initially as the hardcore  [[zine]] ''[[Inside Front]]'', and began operating as a collective in 1996.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Stacy |title=Punk Productions: Unfinished Business |publisher=SUNY Press |pages=109 |location=Albany |year=2004 |isbn=0-7914-6187-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has since published widely read articles and zines for the anarcho-communist movement and distributed posters and books of its own publication.&lt;ref name=brandt&gt;{{cite web |last=Brandt |first=Jed |url=http://burning.typepad.com/burningman/2006/03/crimethinc_is_i.html |title=Crimethinc: In Love With Love Itself |work=[[Clamor (magazine)|Clamor]] |accessdate=January 14, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5eW0gRYrS?url=http://burning.typepad.com/burningman/2006/03/crimethinc_is_i.html |archivedate=February 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CrimethInc. cells have published books, released records, and organized national campaigns against globalization and representative democracy in favor of radical community organizing. Less public splinter groups have carried out direct action (including arson and [[hacktivism]]), hosted international conventions and other events, maintained local chapters, sparked riots, and toured with multimedia performance art or hardcore [[anarcho-punk]] musical ensembles. The collective has received national media and academic attention, as well as criticism and praise from other anarchists for its activities and philosophy. CrimethInc. has an association with the North American anarcho-punk scene due to its relationship with artists in the genre and its publishing of ''Inside Front'' as well as, more recently, the contemporary anti-capitalist movement.

Several websites are maintained by individual cells, including Crimethinc.com, operated by the Far East Cell, which hosts propaganda, excerpts from available publications, and a blog of the activities of other cells. CrimethInc. is connected to publishing collectives/organizations with similar ideas, notably the [[Curious George Brigade]], which has written a number of publications including ''Anarchy in the Age of Dinosaurs''. In 2005, they began publishing a half-gloss journal, ''Rolling Thunder'', with the byline "An Anarchist Journal of Dangerous Living", which released its eighth issue in 2009. CrimethInc. texts have received wide coverage in the anarchist media and in academic publications,&lt;ref&gt;

Since the summer of 2002, CrimethInc. has hosted annual conventions, termed "convergences", open to anyone. Typically featuring the performances of traveling theatrical troupes, musicians, direct-action and [[mutual aid (politics)|mutual-aid]] workshops from individual participants, the few-days-long camping trips have attracted coverage in newspaper articles,&lt;ref name=gouss/&gt; initiated multiple [[Reclaim the Streets]] actions, mobilized large [[Critical Mass (cycling)|Critical Mass]] events, and catalyzed many other activities.&lt;ref name=ao7/&gt;

The 2007 convergence in [[Athens, Ohio]], saw an impromptu [[street party]] which resulted in arrests on minor charges.&lt;ref name=gouss&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Athens News'' characterized the convergence as "a sort of networking, resume-swapping opportunity for would-be radicals, free-thinkers, [[Levellers]], [[Diggers]], [[Neo-Luddism|Neo-Luddites]] and other assorted malcontents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.athensnews.com/news/local/good-going-you-left-town-for-the-summer-and-missed/article_fbdcc78d-64dd-5cff-b2e0-8d368406181a.html |title=Good going; you left town for the summer and missed everything |publisher=The Athens News |accessdate=2008-02-25 |last=Phillips |first=Jim |date=2007-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typical of these gatherings to require that all attendees have something to contribute to the momentum: whether it is bringing food or equipment to share, leading a discussion group, or providing materials with which to write to [[political prisoner]]s. There has been a pattern of promoting convergences as festivals, reminiscent of barnstorming [[flying circus]]es and travelling sideshows.&lt;ref name=ao7&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoshop.org/inews/article.php?story=2007073009151431 |title=Athens, Ohio: Police attack Crimethinc conference |work=Infoshop News |publisher=[[Infoshop.org]] |accessdate=2008-04-28 |date=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523102836/http://www.infoshop.org/inews/article.php?story=2007073009151431 |archivedate=2011-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' journalist Matthew Power described the 2006 convergence in [[Winona, Minnesota]] as follows:
{{quote|text=Several hundred young anarchists from around the country had train-hopped and hitchhiked there to attend the annual event known as the CrimethInc Convergence...Grimy and feral-looking, the CrimethInc kids squatted in small groups around a clearing....[they] were in the middle of several days of self-organized workshops, seminars, and discussions, ranging from the [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist banking]] theories of the nineteenth-century anarchist philosopher [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], to an introductory practicum on lock-picking, to a class on making one's own menstrual pads .... CrimethInc's adherents had come together there because they wanted to live their lives as some sort of solution. They saw 'the revolution' not as a final product but as an ongoing process; they wanted not just to destroy the capitalist system but to create something livable in its place.&lt;ref name="harper's"/&gt;|sign=Matthew Power|source=''[[Harper's Magazine]]'', March 2008}}

These convergences have been hosted by different groups within the collective each time, typically based on the initiative of local enthusiasts. Every year a different set of policy requests is released from locals in the field, typically encouraging a sober, consensus-based space in which no financial transactions are made. The one firm rule has been "No police informants," a regulation which has been ignored by the [[FBI]]. Information gathered by FBI informants at CrimethInc. convergences (in 2004, 2005, and 2008) contributed to the convictions of [[Eric McDavid]] and his associates, as well as [[2008 Republican National Convention]] protester Matthew DePalma.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.startribune.com/local/stpaul/41070787.html?elr=KArks:DCiUtEia_nDaycUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607063219/http://www.startribune.com/local/stpaul/41070787.html?elr=KArks%3ADCiUtEia_nDaycUiD3aPc%3A_Yyc%3AaUU |date=2011-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Conventions/story?id=5718900&amp;page=1 |title=Michigan Man Accused of RNC Molotov Cocktail Plot |author=ABC News |work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.kovr.viacomlocalnetworks.com/~kovr/affidavit.pdf |archivedate=2007-01-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070111192140/http://static.kovr.viacomlocalnetworks.com/~kovr/affidavit.pdf |title=Confidential Source "Anna"-issued affidavit |accessdate=2008-07-21 |format=[[.pdf]] |work=United States District Court Eastern District of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, CrimethInc. announced the ''We Are Everywhere'' campaign of national tours and events in lieu of the traditional convergence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimethinc.com/blog/2010/06/03/august-2010-we-are-everywhere/ |title=August 2010: We Are Everywhere - CrimethInc.

=== Music ===

CrimethInc. is associated with the [[North America]]n [[anarcho-punk]] scene because of its long relationship with notable musicians in the genre and its publishing of ''Inside Front'', a "journal of hardcore punk and anarchist action".&lt;ref name="thompson-music"&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Stacy |title=Punk Productions: Unfinished Business |publisher=SUNY Press |pages=109 |location=Albany |year=2004 |isbn=0-7914-6187-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CrimethInc. releases include LPs, CDs, and 7"s from North American and European anarcho-punk, hardcore and [[anti-folk]] bands. Academic Stacy Thompson has described CrimethInc. as "exemplary of a more contemporary and nuanced approach" to the possible forms anarcho-punk could take to resist commodification through aesthetic expression.&lt;ref name="thompson-music"/&gt; However, Thompson does not consider the aesthetic choices of the collective to be substantially different from the anarcho- and [[crust punk]] bands released by fellow anarcho-punk collective ''[[Profane Existence]]'' in the mid-to-late 90s.&lt;ref name="thompson-music"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
[[File:CrimethInc. - eclipse the past.png|thumb|140px|"Eclipse the past" inside front cover image from CrimethInc.'s ''Days of War, Nights of Love'' (2001). A philosophical theme of CrimethInc.'s writings is the rejection of the "exclusive, anti-[[subjectivity|subjective]]" nature of history, and the need to take active control of one's own life.]]

CrimethInc as a loose association represents a variety of political views; the CrimethInc.

CrimethInc. is influenced by the [[Situationist International]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lang |first=Daniel |date=May 2007 |title="Give Us the Dumpsters -Or- Give Us Life": Res Derilictae and the Trash of Free Trade |journal=Cultural Recycling |volume=3 |issue=1 |publisher=[[Other Voices (open-access journal of cultural criticism)|Other Voices]] |url=http://www.othervoices.org/3.1/dlang/index.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described by scholar Martin Puchner as "inheritors of the political [[avant-garde]]",&lt;ref&gt;Puchner, Martin (2005).

[[Princeton University Press]], Princeton and Oxford. 320pp., {{ISBN|978-0-691-12260-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Knabb]] has criticized CrimethInc. for presenting simplistic and in some cases false accounts of history in their manifesto ''Days of War, Nights of Love'', and for mythologizing themselves as "a pole of international subversion".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For their part, the authors of the book criticized the "exclusive, anti-[[subjectivity|subjective]]" nature of history as "paralyzing", advocating in its place a non-superstitious myth.&lt;ref&gt;''Days of War, Nights of Love'' (2001) , {{ISBN|0-9709101-0-X}}, p. 111–114&lt;/ref&gt; The collective has expressed a strident anti-copyright stance and advocacy of the appropriation of texts and ideas of others, which has attracted criticism from academic philosopher George MacDonald Ross as an endorsement of plagiarism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=George |last=MacDonald Ross |title=Plagiarism really is a crime:a counterblast against anarchists and postmodernists (and others) |booktitle=Plagiarism: Prevention, Practice and Policies 2004 Conference |date=2004-05-10 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228450982_Plagiarism_really_is_a_crime_a_counterblast_against_anarchists_and_postmodernists_and_others |accessdate=2008-04-07 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; CrimethInc.'s N©!

Contributors to publications are generally not credited in respect of an anonymity asserted by participants to be one of the organization's primary values.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt; The name "CrimethInc." itself is a satirical self-criticism about the hypocrisy of revolutionary propaganda (and other "margin-walking between contradictions"&lt;ref name="faq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimethinc.com/about/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2007-10-31 |work=Crimethinc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a direct reference to the concept of "[[thoughtcrime]]" developed in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref name="faq"/&gt;

{{Other uses|Depletion (disambiguation)}}

'''Depletion''' is an [[accounting]] and [[tax]] concept used most often in [[mining]], [[timber]], [[petroleum]], or other similar industries. The depletion deduction allows an owner or operator to account for the reduction of a product's reserves. Depletion is similar to [[depreciation]] in that it is a cost recovery system for accounting and tax reporting. 

Depletion, for both accounting purposes and [[Internal Revenue Service|United States tax purposes]], is a method of recording the gradual expense or use of [[natural resource]]s over time.  Depletion is the using up of natural resources by [[mining]], [[quarrying]], [[Boring (earth)|drilling]], or [[logging|felling]].

According to the [[IRS]] Newswire,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=120930,00.html IRS Issues Guidance on Recoverable Reserves]&lt;/ref&gt; over 50 percent of oil and gas extraction businesses use cost depletion to figure their depletion deduction. Mineral property includes oil and gas wells, mines, and other natural deposits (including geothermal deposits). For that purpose, property is each separate interest businesses own in each [[mineral deposit]] in each separate tract or parcel of land. Businesses can treat two or more separate interests as one property or as separate properties.

==Types of depletion==
For tax purposes, the two types of depletion are percentage depletion and cost depletion.
 
For mineral property, one generally must use the method that gives you the larger deduction. For standing timber, one must use cost depletion.&lt;ref name="irs.gov"&gt;[https://www.irs.gov/publications/p535/ch09.html Publication 535 (2007), Business Expenses]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Percentage depletion===
To figure percentage depletion, one multiplies a certain percentage, specified for each mineral, by gross income from the property during the tax year. The rates to be used and other conditions and qualifications for oil and gas wells are discussed below under ''Independent Producers and Royalty Owners'' and under ''Natural Gas Wells''. Rates and other rules for percentage depletion of other specific minerals are found later in ''Mines and Geothermal Deposits''.&lt;ref name="irs.gov"/&gt;

===Cost depletion===
Cost depletion is an accounting method by which costs of natural resources are allocated to depletion over the period that make up the life of the asset. Cost depletion is computed by estimating the total quantity of mineral or other resources acquired and assigning a proportionate amount of the total resource cost to the quantity extracted in the period. For example, if Big Texas Oil, Co. discovers a large reserve of oil, the company has estimated the oil well will produce 200,000 barrels of oil. The company invests $100,000 to extract the oil and extracts 10,000 barrels the first year. Therefore, the depletion deduction is $5,000 ($100,000 X 10,000/200,000).

Cost depletion for tax purposes may be completely different from cost depletion for accounting purposes:

:&lt;math&gt;CD = S/(R+S) \times AB = AB/(R+S) \times S &lt;/math&gt;
:CD = Cost Depletion.
:S =  Units sold in the current year
:R =  Reserves on hand at the end of the current year
:AB = Adjusted basis of the property at the end of the current year

==Accounting==
Adjusted basis is the basis at end of year adjusted for prior years depletion in cost or percentage. It automatically allows for adjustments to the basis during the taxable year.

By using the units remaining at the end of the year, the adjustment automatically allows for revised estimates of the reserves.

Depletion is based upon sales and not production. Units are considered sold in the year the proceeds are taxable under the taxpayer's accounting method.

==Reserves==
Reserves generally include proven developed reserves and "probable" or "prospective" reserves if there is reasonable evidence to have believed that such quantities existed at that time.

==Example==
If producer X has capitalized costs on property A of $40,000, originally consisting of the lease bonus, capitalized exploration costs, and some capitalized carrying costs, and the lease has been producing for several years and during this time, X has claimed $10,000 of allowable depletion. In 2009, X's share of production sold was 40,000 barrels and an engineer's report indicated that 160,000 barrels could be recovered after December 31, 2009.

The calculation of cost depletion for this lease would be as follows:

:Cost depletion = S/(R+S) × AB or AB/(R+S) × S
:CD = 40,000/(40,000 + 160,000) × ($40,000 − $10,000)   
:   = 40,000/200,000          × $30,000    
:   = $6,000

'''Disciplinary probation''' is a disciplinary status that can apply to [[student]]s at a higher educational institution&lt;ref name=Knowles1977 /&gt; or to [[employee]]s in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Pell2003 /&gt; For employees, it can result from both poor performance at work or from misconduct.&lt;ref name=Pell2003 /&gt; For students, it results from misconduct alone, with poor academic performance instead resulting in [[scholastic probation]].&lt;ref name=Knowles1977 /&gt;

For a student, disciplinary probation means that the student is on formal notice, and subject to special rules and regulations.&lt;ref name=Knowles1977 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BradySnoxell1965 /&gt; The violation of these rules may lead to more severe forms of discipline, such as suspension, dismissal, and expulsion.&lt;ref name=BradySnoxell1965 /&gt;

For employees, disciplinary probation is one common step in a scheme of [[progressive discipline]]. It is a common replacement, in non-unionized workplaces, for the progressive disciplinary step of suspension without pay. A usual period for such probation is 90 days.&lt;ref name=Grote2006 /&gt;
Some companies may place permanent employees on probationary status, particularly if their performance is below a set standard or for disciplinary reasons. In this instance, the employee is usually given a period of time to either improve their performance or modify their behaviour before more severe measures are taken.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4000">'''Discovery-driven planning''' is a planning technique first introduced in a ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article by [[Rita Gunther McGrath]] and Ian C. MacMillan in 1995&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, R. G. &amp; MacMillan, I. C. 1995. Discovery driven planning. ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', 73(4): 44–54.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently referenced in a number of books and articles.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, R. G. &amp; MacMillan, I. C. 2009. ''Discovery driven growth: a breakthrough process to reduce risk and seize opportunity''. Boston: [[Harvard Business Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, C. M. 1997. ''The innovator's dilemma: When new technologies cause great firms to fail''. Boston: [[Harvard Business School Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach applies than is normally used in conventional planning. In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project, as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery-driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.&lt;ref&gt;Block, Z. &amp; MacMillan, I. C. 1985. Milestones for successful venture planning. ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', 63(5): 84–90.&lt;/ref&gt; Conventional project management tools, such as stage-gate models or the use of financial tools to assess innovation, have been found to be flawed in that they are not well suited for the uncertainty of innovation-oriented projects &lt;ref&gt;Rajesh, S. &amp; Zafar, I. 2008. Stage-gate controls, learning failure, and adverse effect on novel new products. ''[[Journal of Marketing]]'', 72(1): 118. {{JSTOR|30162204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, C., Kaufman, S., &amp; Shih, W. 2008. Innovation killers: how financial tools destroy your capacity to do new things. ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', 86(1): 98–105, 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discovery-driven planning has been widely used in entrepreneurship curricula and has recently been cited by [[Steve Blank]] as a foundational idea in the [[lean startup]] methodology &lt;ref&gt;Blank, S. 2013. Why the lean start-up changes everything. ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', 91(5): 63–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Five disciplines ==

A discovery-driven plan incorporates five disciplines or plan elements:
# Definition of success for the plan or initiative, including a "reverse" income statement
# Benchmarking against market and competitive parameters
# Specification of operational requirements
# Documentation of assumptions
# Specification of key checkpoints

Using discovery-driven planning, it is often possible to iterate the ideas in a plan, encouraging experimentation at lowest possible cost. The methodology is consistent with the application of real options reasoning to business planning, in which ventures are considered "real" options. A real option is a small investment made today which buys the right, but not the obligation to make further investments.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath, R. G. 1997. A real options logic for initiating technology positioning investments. ''[[Academy of Management Review]]'', 22(4): 974–996. {{JSTOR|259251}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;van Putten, A. B. &amp; MacMillan, I. C. 2004. Making real options really work. ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', 82(12): 134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dixit, A. K. &amp; Pindyck, R. S. 1994.

'''Dominique Cerutti''' (born January 3, 1961 in [[Manosque]], France) is a French businessman and has been Chairman and CEO of the [[Altran]] group since June 2015.

==Career==

=== Early career ===
Dominique Cerutti began his career as an engineer for French company [[Bouygues|Bouygues Construction]] in [[Saudi Arabia]], where he was based for nearly two years.

=== IBM ===
He moved to [[IBM]] in 1986 starting out in sales engineering and sales management. He remained at IBM for more than 20 years.

At IBM, he was promoted to his first management position in 1996 as the Director of Personal Systems Group for Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=83421936&amp;ticker=ICE&amp;previousCapId=20571&amp;previousTitle=GANNETT%20CO|title=intercontinentalexchange gro (ICE:New York)|work=Businessweek|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following decade, Cerutti ascended the ranks of IBM, and worked in roles that were particularly international. In 1998, he became Executive Assistant to the Chairman and CEO, Lou Gerstner.

In 2000, he moved to IBM Global Services, the leading market services provider in Europe, first as General Manager for Western Europe and then for the whole EMEA region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=19091455&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=M0Gd&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=2774862811395063981142&amp;srchindex=2&amp;srchtotal=11&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A2774862811395063981142%2CVSRPtargetId%3A19091455%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary|title=Dominique Cerutti profile|work=Linkedin|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He managed tens of thousands of employees in 17 different sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/societes/2009/10/01/04015-20091001ARTFIG00488-dominique-cerutti-rejoint-nyse-euronext-.php|work=Le Figaro|title=Dominique Cerutti rejoint NYSE Euronext |date=October 1, 2009|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Cerutti became IBM’s General Manager for Europe, Middle East and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/60a24ba6-aeea-11de-96d7-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2wD2gq890|title=NYSE Euronext picks IBM veteran Cerutti|work=Financial Times|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his former IBM colleagues, Cerutti starkly contrasted with the company’s generally diffident management style, and preferred to clearly outline strategies for his teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usinenouvelle.com/article/dominique-ceruttile-nouveau-profil-d-ibmapres-avoir-conseille-pendant-un-an-lou-gerstner-p-dg-d-ibm-dominique-cerutti-pilote-la-filiale-de-services-informatiques-du-groupe-en-europe.N102980|title=Dominique Cerutti, le nouveau profil d'IBM|work=Usine Nouvelle|date=2001-08-23|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NYSE-Euronext ===
In 2009 Dominique Cerutti left IBM to join NYSE [[Euronext]], the global exchange group, as President and Deputy CEO.  He was also CEO of Euronext NV, the European subsidiary of NYSE Euronext, and Chairman and CEO of Euronext Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/dominique-cerutti/|title=Dominique Cerutti|work=Forbes|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, he was appointed as Board Member of the Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a.WEW4C9lqmM|title=NYSE Names Cerutti to Succeed Theodore as Deputy CEO (Update1)|work=Bloomberg|date=2009-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook one of his first notable projects as a member of the Board: compliance with the EU’s [[Markets in Financial Instruments Directive]]. According to him, this directive decreased transparency in financial markets by allowing the creation of alternative exchange platforms at a time when “the need for transparence has never been so acute.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dominique Cerutti met en garde contre l'opacité des marchés actions|url = http://www.lesechos.fr/29/06/2010/LesEchos/20708-161-ECH_dominique-cerutti-met-en-garde-contre-l-opacite-des-marches-actions.htm|website = lesechos.fr|accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, he moved up from Deputy CEO of NYSE to become the CEO of Euronext.

In June 2014, he oversaw Euronext’s [[Initial public offering|IPO]] as an independent company after it separated from parent company ICE. As CEO of Euronext, he turned around the strategy of the group, moving away from the legacy of his predecessor, Jean-François Théodore.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In September 2014, he embarked on a program to increase operational savings by €60 million over the next three years, with the goal of achieving a 5% annual revenue growth and improve the company's long-term [[EBITDA]] margin from 42% to 53%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.thetradenews.com/news/Asset_Classes/Equities/Cerutti_outlines_multi-asset_class_vision_for_Euronext.aspx|title = Cerutti outlines multi-asset class vision for Euronext|date = June 10, 2014|accessdate = October 13, 2014|website = Trade News|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cerutti has also spoken against the European Commission's proposal of a [[Financial-transactions tax|financial transactions tax]], arguing that "the political intention of creating such a tax is a noble one, but the current form of the proposal is counter-productive […] this tax is truly the last thing we need now.“&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.leadersleague.com/news/view/id/795c276142f14a11e9de0d3977815f34|title = Portrait : Dominique Cerutti, CEO, Euronext|date = September 26, 2014|accessdate = October 13, 2014|website = Leaders League|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141018052436/http://www.leadersleague.com/news/view/id/795c276142f14a11e9de0d3977815f34|archivedate = October 18, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also spoken out in favor of increased market regulation and transparency as the main way of reducing risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.leadersleague.com/news/view/id/54ab112d5a151b8c5d3293623a9bbff4|title = Dominique Cerutti (Euronext) : "Se repositionner comme un centre majeur de levée de capitaux"|date = September 24, 2014|accessdate = October 13, 2014|website = Leaders League|publisher = |last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141018052340/http://www.leadersleague.com/news/view/id/54ab112d5a151b8c5d3293623a9bbff4|archivedate = October 18, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time as CEO, Euronext once again became independent and had an IPO in its own markets.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to Rijnhard Van Tets, president of Euronext's Surpervisory Board, "Under his direction, the company was able to successfully re-position itself as the leading independent European stock market." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dominique Cerutti va quitter Euronext pour diriger Altran|url = http://www.ladepeche.fr/article/2015/04/22/2092196-dominique-cerutti-va-quitter-euronext-pour-diriger-altran.html|website = ladepeche.fr|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Altran ===
Dominique Cerutti has been Chairman and CEO of the [[Altran]] group since 18 June 2015.

In November 2015, Dominique Cerutti announced his five-year strategic plan, "Altran 2020. Ignition." The plan aims for the firm to reach 3 billion euros in revenue in five years and a big increase in profitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Altran voit les choses en grand pour 2020|url = http://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/021503433116-altran-voit-les-choses-en-grand-pour-2020-1177808.php?XF5S6o3QZLTYxjph.99|website = lesechos.fr|access-date = 2016-02-01|language = fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Altran dévoile son plan stratégique : « Altran 2020.

Dominique Cerrutti also set up several strategic partnerships, especially in the fields of 3D printing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.lefigaro.fr/figaro/video/dominique-cerutti-avec-l-imprimante-3d-il-sera-possible-de-creer-un-habitat-sur-mars/5021321869001/|title=Dominique Cerutti : "Avec l'imprimante 3D il sera possible de créer un habitat sur Mars"|publisher=Le Figaro}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Divergent an American startup that integrates 3D printing with automobile manufacturing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/automobile/actualites/impression-3d-pour-l-automobile-altran-investit-dans-divergent-07-09-2016-2066519_683.php|title=Impression 3D pour l'automobile: Altran investit dans Divergent|publisher=Le Point|date=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and autonomous driving with EMG (eMApgo) a Chinese company specialized in digital mapping for the automobile industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/automobile/actualites/altran-s-allie-avec-une-entreprise-chinoise-specialisee-dans-la-cartographie-numerique-04-01-2017-2094556_683.php|title=Altran s'allie avec une entreprise chinoise spécialisée dans la cartographie numérique|publisher=Le Point|date=4 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, he led Altran’s acquisition of Information Risk Management (IRM), a UK-based company specialized in cyber security, as well as GlobalEdge, an India-based software solutions firm specialized in IoT systems and embedded software solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroinvestor.fr/actualites/2017/07/28/altran-technologies-altran-acquires-information-risk-management-irm-a-cyber-security-consultancy-based-in-the-uk/13646321|title=ALTRAN TECHNOLOGIES : Altran acquires Information Risk Management (IRM), a Cyber Security consultancy based in the UK|publisher=Euroinvestor|date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.consultancy.uk/news/14012/indian-software-services-firm-globaledge-acquired-by-altran|title=Indian software services firm GlobalEdge acquired by Altran|publisher=Consultancy|date=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, under the leadership of Dominique Cerruti, Altran Group also purchased the company [[Aricent]] for $2.0 billion, which is to date, the Group’s largest acquisition. This move enabled “Altran 2020. Ignition” strategic plan to achieve its goals two years ahead of schedule and established the company as a world leader in engineering, research and development services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/altran-buys-out-aricent-from-kkr-for-2-billion-117113000869_1.html France's Altran buys out Aricent from KKR for $2 bn], Business Standard, December 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/030960044570-altran-change-dechelle-avec-lacquisition-daricent-2134642.php Altran change d'échelle avec l'acquisition d'Aricent], Les Echos, November 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Under Cerutti, Altran published revenues for the year 2017 indicating a 10% increase in sales, as well as a current operating income up by 13.6% that year; an increased revenue margin of 10.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2018-02-28/altran-technologies-full-year-results-2017-the-ignition-transformation-bears-its-fruits|title=Full Year results 2017: the "Ignition" transformation bears its fruits|publisher=Bloomberg|date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, Dominique Cerutti announced the plan "The High Road, Altran 2022".

'''Downtown Evansville''' is the [[central business district]] of [[Evansville, Indiana]]. The boundaries of downtown Evansville have changed as the city has grown, but they are generally considered to be between Canal Street at the south and east, the [[Lloyd Expressway]] to the north, [[Pigeon Creek (Indiana)|Pigeon Creek]] to the northwest, and the [[Ohio River]] to the southeast south and southwest. Downtown Evansville is entirely within [[Pigeon Township, Vanderburgh County, Indiana|Pigeon Township]].

The district constitutes Evansville's government, cultural and business center. The [[Evansville Civic Center Complex|Evansville Civic Center]] houses the administrative offices for the city and [[Vanderburgh County]]. [[Berry Plastics]], [[Vectren]], and [[Old National Bank]], the largest financial services bank holding company headquartered in Indiana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Old National Bank Corporate Profile| publisher=SNL Financial| url=http://www.snl.com/irweblinkx/corporateprofile.aspx?IID=100391|accessdate=2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; have corporate headquarters in downtown Evansville with [[Mead Johnson]]'s headquarters just west of Downtown.

==History==
Evansville's original downtown plat was made on about 200 acres, with streets running parallel to the river from northwest to southeast. Other streets nearby were laid out on the cardinal points, due north-south and east-west. Thus, anyone entering or leaving downtown finds that the street makes a confusing oblique-angle turn in one direction or another.&lt;ref&gt;Patry, Robert (1996). ''City of Four Freedoms''. Evansville: Friends of Willard Library. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the city suffered from problems such as decreased economic activity and suburban flight, but city-sponsored revitalization has since improved downtown conditions.

==Entertainment venues and attractions==
[[Victory Theatre]] is a vintage 1,950-seat venue that is home to the [[Evansville Philharmonic Orchestra]] and hosts other concerts and events. A wide variety of concerts, plays, and other special events are held at the 2,500-seat auditorium at [[The Centre (Evansville)|The Centre]]. Downtown is also home to the [[Children's Museum of Evansville]], [[Evansville Museum of Arts, History and Science|Evansville Museum]], and [[Tropicana Evansville|Tropicana]], with the [[USS LST-325|LST-325 Museum]] located just south of Downtown at the nearby Indiana-Kentucky State Line.   The [[Ford Center (Evansville)|Ford Center]] is a new arena opened in 2011 located near [[The Centre (Evansville)|The Centre]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38190">[[Data mining]], the process of discovering patterns in large [[data set]]s, has been used in many applications.

==Games==
Since the early 1960s, with the availability of [[Oracle machine|oracles]] for certain [[combinatorial game]]s, also called [[tablebase]]s (e.g. for 3x3-chess) with any beginning configuration, small-board [[dots-and-boxes]], small-board-hex, and certain endgames in chess, dots-and-boxes, and hex; a new area for data mining has been opened. This is the extraction of human-usable strategies from these oracles. Current pattern recognition approaches do not seem to fully acquire the high level of abstraction required to be applied successfully. Instead, extensive experimentation with the tablebases – combined with an intensive study of tablebase-answers to well designed problems, and with knowledge of prior art (i.e., pre-tablebase knowledge) – is used to yield insightful patterns. [[Berlekamp]] (in dots-and-boxes, etc.) and [[John Nunn]] (in [[chess]] [[Chess endgame|endgames]]) are notable examples of researchers doing this work, though they were not – and are not – involved in tablebase generation.

==Business==

In business, data mining is the analysis of historical business activities, stored as static data in data warehouse databases. The goal is to reveal hidden patterns and trends. Data mining software uses advanced [[Pattern recognition|pattern recognition algorithms]] to sift through large amounts of data to assist in discovering previously unknown strategic business information. Examples of what businesses use data mining for is to include performing market analysis to identify new product bundles, finding the root cause of manufacturing problems, to prevent [[customer attrition]] and acquire new customers, [[cross-selling]] to existing customers, and profiling customers with more accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, J. A., &amp; Marakas, G. M. (2011). Management Information Systems. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill/Irwin.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In today’s world raw data is being collected by companies at an exploding rate. For example, Walmart processes over 20 million point-of-sale transactions every day. This information is stored in a centralized database, but would be useless without some type of data mining software to analyze it. If Walmart analyzed their point-of-sale data with data mining techniques they would be able to determine sales trends, develop marketing campaigns, and more accurately predict customer loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, D. (n.d.). Data Mining. Retrieved from The University of Texas at Austin: College of Liberal Arts: http://www.laits.utexas.edu/~anorman/BUS.FOR/course.mat/Alex/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniele Medri: Big Data &amp; Business: An on-going revolution|url=http://www.statisticsviews.com/details/feature/5393251/Big-Data--Business-An-on-going-revolution.html|publisher=[[Statistics Views]]|date=21 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example for Walmart would be that of diapers and beer sales, discovered through data mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/08/15/beer_diapers/|title=The parable of the beer and diapers|access-date=2018-02-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Categorization of the items available in the e-commerce site is a fundamental problem. A correct item categorization system is essential for user experience as it helps determine the items relevant to him for search and browsing.  Item categorization can be formulated as a supervised classification problem in data mining where the categories are the target classes and the features are the words composing some textual description of the items. One of the approaches is to find groups initially which are similar and place them together in a latent group.  Now given a new item, first classify into a latent group which is called coarse level classification. Then, do a second round of classification to find the category to which the item belongs to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://labs.ebay.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Jean-David-Ruvini-Large-scale_Item.pdf|title =Large Scale Item Categorization|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20151005215055/http://labs.ebay.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Jean-David-Ruvini-Large-scale_Item.pdf|archivedate =2015-10-05|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every time a credit card or a store loyalty card is being used, or a warranty card is being filled, data is being collected about the user's behavior. Many people find the amount of information stored about us from companies, such as Google, Facebook, and Amazon, disturbing and are concerned about privacy. Although there is the potential for our personal data to be used in harmful, or unwanted, ways it is also being used to make our lives better. For example, Ford and Audi hope to one day collect information about customer driving patterns so they can recommend safer routes and warn drivers about dangerous road conditions.&lt;ref name="macon.com"&gt;Goss, S. (2013, April 10). Data-mining and our personal privacy. Retrieved from The Telegraph: {{cite web |url=http://www.macon.com/2013/04/10/2429775/data-mining-and-our-personal-privacy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705055127/http://www.macon.com/2013/04/10/2429775/data-mining-and-our-personal-privacy.html |archivedate=2014-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data mining in [[customer relationship management]] applications can contribute significantly to the bottom line.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Rather than randomly contacting a prospect or customer through a call center or sending mail, a company can concentrate its efforts on prospects that are predicted to have a high likelihood of responding to an offer. More sophisticated methods may be used to optimize resources across campaigns so that one may predict to which channel and to which offer an individual is most likely to respond (across all potential offers). Additionally, sophisticated applications could be used to automate mailing. Once the results from data mining (potential prospect/customer and channel/offer) are determined, this "sophisticated application" can either automatically send an e-mail or a regular mail. Finally, in cases where many people will take an action without an offer, "[[uplift modelling|uplift modeling]]" can be used to determine which people have the greatest increase in response if given an offer. Uplift modeling thereby enables marketers to focus mailings and offers on persuadable people, and not to send offers to people who will buy the product without an offer. [[Data clustering]] can also be used to automatically discover the segments or groups within a customer data set.
* Businesses employing data mining may see a return on investment, but also they recognize that the number of predictive models can quickly become very large. For example, rather than using one model to predict how many customers will [[Churn rate|churn]], a business may choose to build a separate model for each region and customer type. In situations where a large number of models need to be maintained, some businesses turn to more automated data mining methodologies.
* Data mining can be helpful to human resources (HR) departments in identifying the characteristics of their most successful employees. Information obtained – such as universities attended by highly successful employees – can help HR focus recruiting efforts accordingly. Additionally, Strategic Enterprise Management applications help a company translate corporate-level goals, such as profit and margin share targets, into operational decisions, such as production plans and workforce levels.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Monk |first1=Ellen |last2=Wagner |first2=Bret |title=Concepts in Enterprise Resource Planning, Second Edition |publisher=Thomson Course Technology |location=Boston, MA |year=2006 |isbn=0-619-21663-8 |oclc=224465825 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Market basket analysis]], relates to data-mining use in retail sales. If a clothing store records the purchases of customers, a data mining system could identify those customers who favor silk shirts over cotton ones. Although some explanations of relationships may be difficult, taking advantage of it is easier. The example deals with [[association rule]]s within transaction-based data. Not all data are transaction based and logical, or inexact [[Rule of inference|rules]] may also be present within a [[database]].
* Market basket analysis has been used to identify the purchase patterns of the [[Alpha consumer|Alpha Consumer]]. Analyzing the data collected on this type of user has allowed companies to predict future buying trends and forecast supply demands.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Science and engineering==
In recent years, data mining has been used widely in the areas of science and engineering, such as [[bioinformatics]], [[genetics]], [[medicine]], [[educational data mining|education]] and [[electrical power]] engineering.
* In the study of human genetics, [[sequence mining]] helps address the important goal of understanding the mapping relationship between the inter-individual variations in human [[DNA]] sequence and the variability in disease susceptibility. In simple terms, it aims to find out how the changes in an individual's DNA sequence affects the risks of developing common diseases such as [[cancer]], which is of great importance to improving methods of diagnosing, preventing, and treating these diseases. One data mining method that is used to perform this task is known as [[multifactor dimensionality reduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Xingquan |last1=Zhu |first2=Ian |last2=Davidson |title=Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining: Challenges and Realities |publisher=Hershey |location=New York, NY |year=2007 |page=18 |isbn=978-1-59904-252-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the area of electrical power engineering, data mining methods have been widely used for [[condition monitoring]] of high voltage electrical equipment. The purpose of condition monitoring is to obtain valuable information on, for example, the status of the [[insulator (electricity)|insulation]] (or other important safety-related parameters). [[Data clustering]] techniques – such as the [[self-organizing map]] (SOM), have been applied to vibration monitoring and analysis of transformer on-load tap-changers (OLTCS). Using vibration monitoring, it can be observed that each tap change operation generates a signal that contains information about the condition of the tap changer contacts and the drive mechanisms. Obviously, different tap positions will generate different signals. However, there was considerable variability amongst normal condition signals for exactly the same tap position. SOM has been applied to detect abnormal conditions and to hypothesize about the nature of the abnormalities.&lt;ref name="McGrail"&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=Anthony J. |last1=McGrail |first2=Edward |last2=Gulski |first3=David |last3=Allan |first4=David |last4=Birtwhistle |first5=Trevor R. |last5=Blackburn |first6=Edwin R. S. |last6=Groot |title=Data Mining Techniques to Assess the Condition of High Voltage Electrical Plant |journal=CIGRÉ WG 15.11 of Study Committee 15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data mining methods have been applied to [[dissolved gas analysis]] (DGA) in [[power transformer]]s. DGA, as a diagnostics for power transformers, has been available for many years. Methods such as SOM has been applied to analyze generated data and to determine trends which are not obvious to the standard DGA ratio methods (such as Duval Triangle).&lt;ref name="McGrail" /&gt;
* In educational research, where data mining has been used to study the factors leading students to choose to engage in behaviors which reduce their learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Ryan S. J. d.&lt;!-- sic --&gt; |last=Baker |title=Is Gaming the System State-or-Trait?

In this way, data mining can facilitate [[institutional memory]].

* In adverse drug reaction surveillance, the [[Uppsala Monitoring Centre]] has, since 1998, used data mining methods to routinely screen for reporting patterns indicative of emerging drug safety issues in the WHO global database of 4.6&amp;nbsp;million suspected [[adverse drug reaction]] incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bate | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Lindquist | first2 = Marie | last3 = Edwards | first3 = I.

* Data mining has been applied to [[software]] artifacts within the realm of [[software engineering]]: [[Mining Software Repositories]].

==Human rights==
Data mining of government records – particularly records of the justice system (i.e., courts, prisons) – enables the discovery of systemic [[human rights]] violations in connection to generation and publication of invalid or fraudulent legal records by various government agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Zernik, Joseph; [https://www.scribd.com/doc/38328591/ Data Mining as a Civic Duty – Online Public Prisoners' Registration Systems], ''International Journal on Social Media: Monitoring, Measurement, Mining'', 1: 84–96 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zernik, Joseph; [https://www.scribd.com/doc/38328585/ Data Mining of Online Judicial Records of the Networked US Federal Courts], ''International Journal on Social Media: Monitoring, Measurement, Mining'', 1:69–83 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical data mining==
{{See also|PatientsLikeMe|Comparative genomics}}
Some [[machine learning]] algorithms can be applied in medical field as second-opinion [[Clinical decision support system|diagnostic tools]] and as tools for the knowledge extraction phase in the process of [[knowledge discovery in databases]].
One of these classifiers (called ''Prototype exemplar learning classifier'' ([[PEL-C]])&lt;ref name=Gagliardi2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gagliardi|first=F|title=Instance-based classifiers applied to medical databases: Diagnosis and knowledge extraction|journal=Artificial Intelligence in Medicine|year=2011|volume=52|issue=3|pages=123–139|doi=10.1016/j.artmed.2011.04.002|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2011.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; is able to discover [[syndrome]]s as well as atypical clinical cases.

In 2011, the case of [[Sorrell v. IMS Health, Inc.]], decided by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], ruled that [[Pharmacy|pharmacies]] may share information with outside companies. This practice was authorized under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st Amendment of the Constitution]], protecting the "freedom of speech."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= David G. Savage | work = Los Angeles Times |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jun/24/nation/la-na-court-drugs-20110624 |title=Pharmaceutical industry: Supreme Court sides with pharmaceutical industry in two decisions|date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the passage of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act) helped to initiate the adoption of the electronic health record (EHR) and supporting technology in the United States.&lt;ref name="Analyzing Medical Data 2012"&gt;Analyzing Medical Data. (2012). ''Communications of the ACM'' 55(6), 13-15. {{DOI|10.1145/2184319.2184324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HITECH Act was signed into law on February 17, 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and helped to open the door to medical data mining.&lt;ref&gt;http://searchhealthit.techtarget.com/definition/HITECH-Act&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the signing of this law, estimates of only 20% of United States-based physicians were utilizing electronic patient records.&lt;ref name="Analyzing Medical Data 2012"/&gt; Søren Brunak notes that “the patient record becomes as information-rich as possible” and thereby “maximizes the data mining opportunities.”&lt;ref name="Analyzing Medical Data 2012"/&gt; Hence, electronic patient records further expands the possibilities regarding medical data mining thereby opening the door to a vast source of medical data analysis.

==Spatial data mining==
Spatial data mining is the application of data mining methods to spatial data. The end objective of spatial data mining is to find patterns in data with respect to geography. So far, data mining and [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS) have existed as two separate technologies, each with its own methods, traditions, and approaches to visualization and data analysis. Particularly, most contemporary GIS have only very basic spatial analysis functionality. The immense explosion in geographically referenced data occasioned by developments in IT, digital mapping, remote sensing, and the global diffusion of GIS emphasizes the importance of developing data-driven inductive approaches to geographical analysis and modeling.

Data mining offers great potential benefits for GIS-based applied decision-making. Recently, the task of integrating these two technologies has become of critical importance, especially as various public and private sector organizations possessing huge databases with thematic and geographically referenced data begin to realize the huge potential of the information contained therein. Among those organizations are:
* offices requiring analysis or dissemination of geo-referenced statistical data
* public health services searching for explanations of disease clustering
* environmental agencies assessing the impact of changing land-use patterns on climate change
* geo-marketing companies doing customer segmentation based on spatial location.

Challenges in Spatial mining:
Geospatial data repositories tend to be very large. Moreover, existing GIS datasets are often splintered into feature and attribute components that are conventionally archived in hybrid data management systems. Algorithmic requirements differ substantially for relational (attribute) data management and for topological (feature) data management.&lt;ref&gt;Healey, Richard G. (1991); ''Database Management Systems'', in Maguire, David J.; Goodchild, Michael F.; and Rhind, David W., (eds.), ''Geographic Information Systems: Principles and Applications'', London, GB: Longman&lt;/ref&gt; Related to this is the range and diversity of geographic data formats, which present unique challenges. The digital geographic data revolution is creating new types of data formats beyond the traditional "vector" and "raster" formats. Geographic data repositories increasingly include ill-structured data, such as imagery and geo-referenced multi-media.&lt;ref&gt;Camara, Antonio S.; and Raper, Jonathan (eds.) (1999); ''Spatial Multimedia and Virtual Reality'', London, GB: Taylor and Francis&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several critical research challenges in geographic knowledge discovery and data mining. Miller and Han&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Harvey J.; and Han, Jiawei (eds.) (2001); ''Geographic Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery'', London, GB: Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; offer the following list of emerging research topics in the field:
* '''Developing and supporting geographic data warehouses (GDW's)''': Spatial properties are often reduced to simple [[Theory of Forms#What are the Forms?|aspatial]] attributes in mainstream data warehouses. Creating an integrated GDW requires solving issues of spatial and temporal data interoperability – including differences in semantics, referencing systems, geometry, accuracy, and position.
* '''Better spatio-temporal representations in geographic knowledge discovery''': Current geographic knowledge discovery (GKD) methods generally use very simple representations of geographic objects and spatial relationships. Geographic data mining methods should recognize more complex geographic objects (i.e., lines and polygons) and relationships (i.e., non-Euclidean distances, direction, connectivity, and interaction through attributed geographic space such as terrain). Furthermore, the time dimension needs to be more fully integrated into these geographic representations and relationships.
* '''Geographic knowledge discovery using diverse data types''': GKD methods should be developed that can handle diverse data types beyond the traditional raster and vector models, including imagery and geo-referenced multimedia, as well as dynamic data types (video streams, animation).

==Temporal data mining==
Data may contain attributes generated and recorded at different times. In this case finding meaningful relationships in the data may require considering the temporal order of the attributes. A temporal relationship may indicate a causal relationship, or simply an association.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Sensor data mining==
[[Wireless sensor network]]s can be used for facilitating the collection of data for spatial data mining for a variety of applications such as air pollution monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ma | first1 = Y. | last2 = Richards | first2 = M. | last3 = Ghanem | first3 = M. | last4 = Guo | first4 = Y. | last5 = Hassard | first5 = J. | title = Air Pollution Monitoring and Mining Based on Sensor Grid in London | doi = 10.3390/s8063601 | journal = Sensors | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = 3601 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A characteristic of such networks is that nearby sensor nodes monitoring an environmental feature typically register similar values. This kind of data redundancy due to the spatial correlation between sensor observations inspires the techniques for in-network data aggregation and mining. By measuring the spatial correlation between data sampled by different sensors, a wide class of specialized algorithms can be developed to develop more efficient spatial data mining algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ma | first1 = Y. | last2 = Guo | first2 = Y. | last3 = Tian | first3 = X. | last4 = Ghanem | first4 = M. | title = Distributed Clustering-Based Aggregation Algorithm for Spatial Correlated Sensor Networks | doi = 10.1109/JSEN.2010.2056916 | journal = IEEE Sensors Journal | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 641 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual data mining==
In the process of turning from analog into digital, large data sets have been generated, collected, and stored discovering statistical patterns, trends and information which is hidden in data, in order to build predictive patterns. Studies suggest visual data mining is faster and much more intuitive than is traditional data mining.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, Kaidi; and Liu, Bing; Tirpark, Thomas M.; and Weimin, Xiao; [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1106390 ''A Visual Data Mining Framework for Convenient Identification of Useful Knowledge'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keim, Daniel A.; [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.135.7051 ''Information Visualization and Visual Data Mining'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Burch, Michael; Diehl, Stephan; Weißgerber, Peter; [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1056018.1056024 ''Visual Data Mining in Software Archives'']&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Computer vision]].

==Music data mining==
Data mining techniques, and in particular [[co-occurrence]] analysis, has been used to discover relevant similarities among music corpora (radio lists, CD databases) for purposes including classifying music into [[genres]] in a more objective manner.&lt;ref&gt;Pachet, François; Westermann, Gert; and Laigre, Damien; [http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2001/pachet01c.pdf ''Musical Data Mining for Electronic Music Distribution''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327024728/http://www.csl.sony.fr/downloads/papers/2001/pachet01c.pdf# |date=2014-03-27 }}, Proceedings of the 1st WedelMusic Conference, Firenze, Italy, 2001, pp. 101–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surveillance==
Data mining has been used by the U.S. government. Programs include the [[Total Information Awareness]] (TIA) program, Secure Flight (formerly known as Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System ([[CAPPS II]])), Analysis, Dissemination, Visualization, Insight, Semantic Enhancement ([[ADVISE]]),&lt;ref&gt;Government Accountability Office, ''Data Mining: Early Attention to Privacy in Developing a Key DHS Program Could Reduce Risks'', GAO-07-293 (February 2007), Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt; and the Multi-state Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange ([[MATRIX]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20604775/ Secure Flight Program report], MSNBC&lt;/ref&gt; These programs have been discontinued due to controversy over whether they violate the 4th Amendment to the United States Constitution, although many programs that were formed under them continue to be funded by different organizations or under different names.&lt;ref name="eff-tia-funding"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/TIA/20031003_comments.php |title=Total/Terrorism Information Awareness (TIA): Is It Truly Dead? |year=2003 |work=Electronic Frontier Foundation (official website) |accessdate=2009-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325113304/http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/TIA/20031003_comments.php |archivedate=2009-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of combating terrorism, two particularly plausible methods of data mining are "pattern mining" and "subject-based data mining".

==Pattern mining== &lt;!-- [[Pattern mining]] links to here. --&gt;
"Pattern mining" is a data mining method that involves finding existing [[pattern]]s in data. In this context ''patterns'' often means [[association rules]]. The original motivation for searching association rules came from the desire to analyze supermarket transaction data, that is, to examine customer behavior in terms of the purchased products. For example, an association rule "beer ⇒ potato chips (80%)" states that four out of five customers that bought beer also bought potato chips.

In the context of pattern mining as a tool to identify terrorist activity, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] provides the following definition: "Pattern-based data mining looks for patterns (including anomalous data patterns) that might be associated with terrorist activity&amp;nbsp;— these patterns might be regarded as small signals in a large ocean of noise."&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, Rakesh; Mannila, Heikki; Srikant, Ramakrishnan; Toivonen, Hannu; and Verkamo, A. Inkeri; ''Fast discovery of association rules'', in ''Advances in knowledge discovery and data mining'', MIT Press, 1996, pp. 307–328&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NRC2008"&gt;National Research Council, ''Protecting Individual Privacy in the Struggle Against Terrorists: A Framework for Program Assessment'', Washington, DC: National Academies Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Haag2006"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haag |first1=Stephen |first2=Maeve |last2=Cummings |first3=Amy |last3=Phillips |title=Management Information Systems for the information age |page=28 |isbn=0-07-095569-7 |year=2006 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Ryerson |location=Toronto |oclc=63194770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pattern Mining includes new areas such a [[Music Information Retrieval]] (MIR) where patterns seen both in the temporal and non temporal domains are imported to classical knowledge discovery search methods.

==Subject-based data mining== &lt;!-- [[Subject-based data mining]] links to here. --&gt;
"Subject-based data mining" is a data mining method involving the search for associations between individuals in data. In the context of combating terrorism, the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] provides the following definition: "Subject-based data mining uses an initiating individual or other datum that is considered, based on other information, to be of high interest, and the goal is to determine what other persons or financial transactions or movements, etc., are related to that initiating datum."&lt;ref name="NRC2008" /&gt;

==Knowledge grid==
Knowledge discovery "On the Grid" generally refers to conducting knowledge discovery in an open environment using [[grid computing]] concepts, allowing users to integrate data from various online data sources, as well make use of remote resources, for executing their data mining tasks. The earliest example was the [[Discovery Net]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Ghanem | first1 = Moustafa | last2 = Guo | first2 = Yike | last3 = Rowe | first3 = Anthony | last4 = Wendel | first4 = Patrick | chapter = Grid-based knowledge discovery services for high throughput informatics | doi = 10.1109/HPDC.2002.1029946 | title = Proceedings 11th IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing | pages = 416 | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-7695-1686-6 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Ghanem | first1 = Moustafa | last2 = Curcin | first2 = Vasa | last3 = Wendel | first3 = Patrick | last4 = Guo | first4 = Yike | chapter = Building and Using Analytical Workflows in Discovery Net | doi = 10.1002/9780470699904.ch8 | title = Data Mining Techniques in Grid Computing Environments | pages = 119 | year = 2009 | isbn = 9780470699904 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed at [[Imperial College London]], which won the "Most Innovative Data-Intensive Application Award" at the ACM SC02 (Supercomputing 2002) conference and exhibition, based on a demonstration of a fully interactive distributed knowledge discovery application for a bioinformatics application. Other examples include work conducted by researchers at the [[University of Calabria]], who developed a Knowledge Grid architecture for distributed knowledge discovery, based on [[grid computing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cannataro, Mario |author2=Talia, Domenico |title=The Knowledge Grid: An Architecture for Distributed Knowledge Discovery |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=46 |number=1 |date=January 2003 |pages=89–93 |doi=10.1145/602421.602425 |url=http://grid.deis.unical.it/papers/pdf/CACM2003.pdf |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Talia, Domenico |author2=Trunfio, Paolo |title=How distributed data mining tasks can thrive as knowledge services |journal=Communications of the ACM |volume=53 |number=7 |date=July 2010 |pages=132–137 |doi=10.1145/1785414.1785451 |url=http://grid.deis.unical.it/papers/pdf/CACM2010.pdf |accessdate=17 October 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foreign exchange risk''' (also known as '''FX risk''', '''exchange rate risk''' or '''currency risk''') is a [[financial risk]] that exists when a financial transaction is denominated in a [[currency]] other than that of the base currency of the company. Foreign exchange risk also exists when the foreign subsidiary of a firm maintains financial statements in a currency other than the reporting currency of the consolidated entity. The risk is that there may be an adverse movement in the [[exchange rate]] of the denomination currency in relation to the base currency before the date when the transaction is completed.&lt;ref name="Levi 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Finance, 4th Edition | author = Levi, Maurice D. | year = 2005 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-30900-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moffett et al. 2009"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Fundamentals of Multinational Finance, 3rd Edition | author = Moffett, Michael H. | author2 = Stonehill, Arthur I. | author3 = Eiteman, David K. | year = 2009 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Boston, MA | isbn = 978-0-321-54164-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investors and businesses exporting or importing goods and services or making foreign investments have an exchange rate risk which can have severe financial consequences; but steps can be taken to manage (i.e. reduce) the risk.&lt;ref name="Homaifar 2004"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Managing Global Financial and Foreign Exchange Risk | author = Homaifar, Ghassem A. | year = 2004 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Hoboken, NJ | isbn = 978-0-471-28115-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moosa 2003"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Operations: Arbitrage, Hedging, Speculation, Financing and Investment | author = Moosa, Imad A. | year = 2003 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-333-99859-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of Foreign exchange risk 

===Transaction risk===
A firm has ''transaction risk'' whenever it has contractual cash flows (receivables and payables) whose values are subject to unanticipated changes in exchange rates due to a contract being denominated in a foreign currency. To realize the domestic value of its foreign-denominated cash flows, the firm must exchange foreign currency for domestic currency. As firms negotiate contracts with set prices and delivery dates in the face of a volatile foreign exchange market with exchange rates constantly fluctuating, the firms face a risk of changes in the exchange rate between the foreign and domestic currency. It refers to the risk associated with the change in the exchange rate between the time an enterprise initiates a transaction and settles it.

Applying public accounting rules causes firms with transnational risks to be impacted by a process known as "re-measurement". The current value of contractual cash flows are remeasured at each balance sheet.

===Economic risk===
A firm has ''economic risk'' (also known as ''forecast risk'') to the degree that its market value is influenced by unexpected exchange rate fluctuations. Such exchange rate adjustments can severely affect the firm's market share position with regards to its competitors, the firm's future cash flows, and ultimately the firm's value. Economic risk can affect the present value of future cash flows. Any transaction that exposes the firm to foreign exchange risk also exposes the firm economically, but economic risks can be caused by other business activities and investments which may not be mere international transactions, such as future cash flows from fixed assets. A shift in exchange rates that influences the demand for a good in some country would also be an economic risk for a firm that sells that good.

===Translation risk===
A firm's ''translation risk'' is the extent to which its financial reporting is affected by exchange rate movements. As all firms generally must prepare consolidated financial statements for reporting purposes, the consolidation process for multinationals entails translating foreign assets and liabilities or the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries from foreign to domestic currency. While translation risk may not affect a firm's cash flows, it could have a significant impact on a firm's reported earnings and therefore its stock price.

===Contingent risk===
A firm has ''contingent risk'' when bidding for foreign projects or negotiating other contracts or foreign direct investments. Such a risk arises from the potential of  a firm to suddenly face a transnational or economic foreign exchange risk, contingent on the outcome of some contract or negotiation. For example, a firm could be waiting for a project bid to be accepted by a foreign business or government that if accepted would result in an immediate receivable. While waiting, the firm faces a contingent risk from the uncertainty as to whether or not that receivable will happen.

==Measurement==
If foreign exchanges market are [[efficient-market hypothesis|efficient]] such that [[purchasing power parity]], [[interest rate parity]], and the [[international Fisher effect]] hold true, a firm or investor needn't protect against foreign exchange risk due to an indifference toward international investment decisions. A deviation from one or more of the three international parity conditions generally needs to occur for an exposure to foreign exchange risk.&lt;ref name="Wang 2005"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Economics of Foreign Exchange and Global Finance | author = Wang, Peijie | year = 2005 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin, Germany | isbn = 978-3-540-21237-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial risk is most commonly measured in terms of the [[variance]] or [[standard deviation]] of a variable such as percentage [[rate of return|returns]] or rates of change. In foreign exchange, a relevant factor would be the rate of change of the spot exchange rate between currencies. Variance represents exchange rate risk by the spread of exchange rates, whereas standard deviation represents exchange rate risk by the amount exchange rates deviate, on average, from the mean exchange rate in a [[probability distribution]]. A higher standard deviation would signal a greater currency risk. Economists have criticized the accuracy of standard deviation as a risk indicator for its uniform treatment of deviations, be they positive or negative, and for automatically squaring deviation values. Alternatives such as [[average absolute deviation]] and [[semivariance]] have been advanced for measuring financial risk.&lt;ref name="Moosa 2003" /&gt;

===Value at risk===
Practitioners have advanced and regulators have accepted a financial risk management technique called [[value at risk]] (VaR), which examines the tail end of a distribution of returns for changes in exchange rates to highlight the outcomes with the worst returns. Banks in Europe have been authorized by the [[Bank for International Settlements]] to employ VaR models of their own design in establishing [[capital requirement]]s for given levels of [[market risk]]. Using the VaR model helps risk managers determine the amount that could be lost on an investment portfolio over a certain period of time with a given probability of changes in exchange rate

==Management==
{{See also|Foreign exchange hedge}}
Firms with exposure to foreign exchange risk may use a number of foreign exchange hedging strategies to reduce the exchange rate risk. Transaction exposure can be reduced either with the use of the [[money market]]s, [[foreign exchange derivative]]s such as [[forward contract]]s, [[futures contract]]s, [[option (finance)|options]], and [[swap (finance)|swaps]], or with operational techniques such as currency invoicing, leading and lagging of receipts and payments, and exposure [[netting]].&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Financial Management, 6th Edition | author = Eun, Cheol S. | author2 = Resnick, Bruce G. | year = 2011 | publisher = McGraw-Hill/Irwin | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-07-803465-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firms may adopt alternative strategies to financial hedging for managing their economic or operating exposure, by carefully selecting production sites with a mind for lowering costs, using a policy of flexible sourcing in its supply chain management, diversifying its export market across a greater number of countries, or by implementing strong research and development activities and differentiating its products in pursuit of greater inelasticity and less foreign exchange risk exposure.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;

Translation exposure is largely dependent on the accounting standards of the home country and the translation methods required by those standards. For example, the United States [[Federal Accounting Standards Board]] specifies when and where to use certain methods such as the temporal method and current rate method. Firms can manage translation exposure by performing a balance sheet hedge. Since translation exposure arises from discrepancies between net assets and net liabilities on a balance sheet solely from exchange rate differences. Following this logic, a firm could acquire an appropriate amount of exposed assets or liabilities to balance any outstanding discrepancy. Foreign exchange derivatives may also be used to hedge against translation exposure.&lt;ref name="Eun &amp; Resnick 2011" /&gt;

==History==
Many businesses were unconcerned with and did not manage foreign exchange risk under the [[Bretton Woods system]] of international monetary order. It wasn't until the switch to [[floating exchange rate]]s following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system that firms became exposed to an increasing risk from exchange rate fluctuations and began trading an increasing volume of financial derivatives in an effort to hedge their exposure.&lt;ref name="Dunn &amp; Mutti 2004"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Economics, 6th Edition | author = Dunn, Robert M., Jr. | author2 = Mutti, John H. | year = 2004 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-0-415-31154-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pilbeam 2006"&gt;{{Cite book | title = International Finance, 3rd Edition | author = Pilbeam, Keith | year = 2006 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = New York, NY | isbn = 978-1-4039-4837-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[currency crisis|currency crises]] of the 1990s and early 2000s, such as the [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico|Mexican peso crisis]], [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian currency crisis]], [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], and the [[1998–2002 Argentine great depression|Argentine peso crisis]], led to substantial losses from foreign exchange and led firms to pay closer attention to their foreign exchange risk.&lt;ref name="Reszat 2003"&gt;{{Cite book | title = The Japanese Foreign Exchange Market | author = Reszat, Beate | year = 2003 | publisher = Routledge | location = New Fetter Lane, London | isbn = 0-203-22254-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GRC Envelop''' is a [[risk management]] and [[audit]] management software tool. It enables process control managers, [[auditors]] and risk managers to document and manage their work. The entire tool is web based and is built using the [[Python (programming language) |Python]]/[[Django (web framework) |Django]].  The idea behind GRC Envelop is to help risk managers and auditors with a standard work flow and framework to help capture the process details within an organisation.  This tool is mainly used for internal and external audits focused on financial, IT, HR and sales processes within firms.

Since, this tool has an open source license, it has been listed on a few sites&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.crowdreviews.com/grc-envelop | title = GRC Envelop Reviews | accessdate = 5 May 2017 | publisher = Crowd reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://cloudsmallbusinessservice.com/small-business/best-audit-software-for-small-business.html | title = Best Audit Software | accessdate = 2 June 2017 | publisher = Cloud small business service | work = Small Business Software Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.imritechsearch.com/risk-man-capt | title = Risk Man.

Throughout GRC Envelop, the fundamental data structure is as follows:

Processes → Objectives → Risks → Controls → Tests → Findings → Actions

Processes are the basic starting point for the entire tool. Objectives, risks and controls are the most important part that this tool intends to handle. Sometimes this part is also referred to as the risk control matrix in some organisations.

== Features ==
* '''Audit management''': There are three basic areas for the audit management
** Creating audits - Title, description, start and end dates are of some of the features that are available while creating an audit. You can also attached work papers to an Audit. While creating an audit, you can create the processes, the objectives, the risks, the controls and the tests. At each of these levels you can attach work papers too.
** Managing and executing audits - to manage or execute an Audit, the GRC Envelop tool provides a separate workflow to ensure that  auditors can only enter test results and test descriptions. While executing the audit you can create findings and actions. The ability to make control and test assessment is only available in the enterprise version.
** Report generation - the main use of this tool  is to provide easy report generation at the end of an auditing exercise. report generation template can be modified according to your needs. The community version has only one default report generation template. The enterprise version has the ability to have multiple templates.
* '''Risk Management''': The risk management module looks at providing the basic structure for capturing the risk assessment process and documentation. The module is generally based around [[ISO/IEC 27001:2013]].
** Risk register: A register is a collection of risks. Registers may be used to group risks in any manner that is convenient to the firm. A Register report can be generated to show risk register details and an overview of all the risks and stakeholder opinions.
** Risk: A risk is a clear definition of some kind of uncertainty that will affect the firm in future. An uncertainty can occur on many different dimensions, for example, financial risk or reputation risk. There are two aspects to consider when modeling risk, likelihood and impact. Likelihood and Impact are presented as scales in the risk management module.
** The risk owner: any user on the system
** Risk Opinion: The most powerful feature of this module is to generate a survey link which can be sent to all the stakeholders associated with the risk (or risk register). GRC Envelop with capture all the responses on the survey and present the report based on a template. 
** Risk Summary: The risk summary provides an overview of all the responses from the stakeholders to the Risk Manager. There is a table that provides the detailed view of each stakeholder and their responses. The last row of the table has the average values of the likelihood and impacts across all the stakeholders.
** Report generation: reports can be generated based on a changeable template. The template can be designed to aggregate the responses in numerous ways.
** Scales: Scales are to be defined for likelihood and impact of a risk. Each scale has numeric range (minimum and maximum values), the units that the scale deals with and the type of scale (whether Likelihood or Impact scale). Each scale has a title and description too.
* '''Repository''': The repository module is a store or library of processes, objectives, risks, controls and tests. The structure under a process group is the same as that in the audit module. However, there are no findings or actions in the repository module.
* '''Planning''': Planning module helps managers to see on a calendar format the different audits and resources that are planned for a time period. For example, conflicts of assignment of auditors can be quickly recognised

== Users and Roles ==
Restricting users to their areas is an important task  for a tool.  The community version has only one user type ( auditor) whereas the enterprise version has the following seven user types:
* auditor
* audit manager
* risk manager
* repository manager
* internal business user
* external viewer
* system administrator

== Licenses ==
There are two types of licenses that with which GRC Envelop is available:
* Open source [[MIT License | MIT]] license (limited features)&lt;ref name="releases"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.grcenvelop.com/download |title=Downloads |publisher= GRC Envelop |accessdate= 10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Enterprise license

== Releases ==
* 17 April 2018 - Release version 0.4.1 (community version)
* 24 October 2017 - Windows installers are made available (community version)
* 1 October 2017 - Release version 1.2.1 (enterprise version)
* 15 January 2017 - Release version 1.1.4 (enterprise version)
* 27 September 2016 - Release version 1.1.4 (enterprise version)
* 8 June 2016 - Release version 0.3.2 (community version)
* 30 September 2015 - Initial release version 0.2 (community version)

'''''Georgia Trend''''' (tagline: ''The Magazine of Georgia Business, Politics &amp; Economic Development Since 1985'') is a monthly business magazine covering business and finance in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. It was established in 1985 by [[Times Publishing Company]], which published the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' (then known as the ''St. Petersburg Times''). It was modeled on the business magazine ''[[Florida Trend]]'', because [[Eugene Patterson]], the then-president of Times Publishing Company, wanted to start a similar magazine in his home state of Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/business-economy/georgia-trend |title=Georgia Trend |last=Starrs |first=Chris |website=[[New Georgia Encyclopedia]] |publication-date=26 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine's first issue was published in September of that year. It is distributed in every county in Georgia.&lt;ref name=augusta/&gt; In February 2017, [[Morris Publishing Group]] acquired the magazine's publisher, Trend Publications LLC.&lt;ref name=augusta&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/news/business/2017-02-02/morris-acquires-georgia-trend-magazine|title=Morris acquires Georgia Trend magazine|last=Cline  |first=Damon|website=The Augusta Chronicle|publisher=Morris Publishing Group|date=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7201">'''James Alexander Lyons''' (1861 - 1920) was an American accountancy author, and publisher, known for publishing a series of books on bookkeeping and accountancy in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Henry Kramer (1920) ''Experimental Research as a Factor in Commercial Education.'' 1920. p. 185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Ingendahl (1990) ''Die Kapitalflussrechnung im Rechnungslegungsrecht der USA und der Bundesrepublik Deutschland.'' p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The first work Lyons published was the 1896 textbook entitled "A treatise on business practice," which was designed as  textbook for all business schools and as reference for all classes.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons (1896, p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Lyons had started his commercial textbook business in cooperation with Orville Marcellus Powers (1852-1910s) under the name Powers &amp; Lyons in the 1890s. One of the first books were "The new business arithmetic; a treatise on commercial Calculations," first published in 1893, and "The complete accountant: Designed for the use of schools and private study : a book of reference for the counting house, embodying the latest forms and methods in use in the best business houses," first published in 1898. Both books were authored by Powers, and ran in several editions.

The firm Powers &amp; Lyons had been dissolved in 1909, and Lyons assumes full ownership, continuing the business under the name of J. A. Lyons &amp; Company.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisconsin Journal of Education.'' Vol. 41, (1909). p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911 James W. Carnahan joined the firm, who had been general representative of the Ginn &amp; Company publishing company. The publishing company changed its name in Lyons and Carnahan.&lt;ref&gt;''Moderator-topics,'' Vol. 32. (1911), p. 578&lt;/ref&gt; Based in Chicago, the company continued to concentrated on publishing textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Carl B. Cone (2015). ''The University of Kentucky: A Pictorial History.'' p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== ''Modern corporation accounting,'' 1908 ===
The purpose of the 1908 ''Modern corporation accounting,'' was to show students what a corporation is, and how it is created; to give them in concise form a correct idea of those accounts which belong peculiarly to corporation bookkeeping, and the original entries which affect those accounts; and to illustrate several processes of closing the ledger of a corporation and distributing corporation profits. While studying these things, observing students will learn much that will be of general benefit and that will serve to guide them in possible future dealings with corporations.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons 1908, p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bookkeeping: Classification of Loss or Gain Accounts ===
In ''Modern corporation accounting,'' (1908) Lyons picture some of the transactions and entries which are peculiar to corporations and corporation accounting. In doing so, he presents one of the earliest modern flow diagrams of cost accounting. These relation was originally pictured  by [[Emile Garcke]] and [[J. M. Fells]] in their [[Emile Garcke#System of factory accounting|System of factory accounting]] from 1889. Lyons had symplified these relations into one single flow diagram:

[[File:Relation of the various loss or gain accounts, 1908.jpg|thumb|600px|center|Relation of the various loss or gain accounts, 1908]]

Lyon explained that the above diagram shows the relation of the various loss or gain accounts to each other, and indicates what account each group of accounts closes into. Out-Freight, Cash Discount Dr., and the Sales Book total, close into the Sales account. Manufacturing Labor, Manufacturing Expense, Materials, and Materials Expense close into Production (after In-Freight and Cash Discount Cr., which are subordinate to Materials, have been closed into Materials). Sales and Production, which now exhibit respectively the net returns on merchandise and the gross cost of manufacture, are closed into Implements, which is the Merchandise account.

'''James Henry Bradney''' (2 April 1853 – 26 May 1936) was a [[New Zealand Reform Party]] Member of Parliament, and shipping proprietor.

==Early life==
James Henry Bradney was born on 2 April 1853 at [[Wolverhampton]], [[Staffordshire]], the son of Joseph Bradney, coachsmith &amp; ironmonger, and Emily née Morris.  Joseph and Emily, with James Henry and three other children, emigrated on the ''Mermaid'' from [[Liverpool]] on 11 July 1859, arriving at [[Auckland]], New Zealand on 19 October.&lt;ref&gt;Passenger list of the ''Mermaid'', Liverpool to Auckland, July 1859 to October 1859 [http://www.yesteryears.co.nz/shipping/passlists/mermaid.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradney's early schooling was at [[Takapuna]]. At age 11 he went to work on a farm, and remained there three years. He later worked in a bakery, and as a butcher and grocer.

==Maritime activities==
Bradney ran away to sea and joined the small steamer ''Go Ahead'' as a deck hand. He later sailed round the coast for some time in the three-masted schooner ''Policeman'', then went bushfelling at [[Coromandel, New Zealand|Coromandel]], and gold mining at [[Thames, New Zealand|Thames]]. 
[[File:James Henry Bradney cartoon Observer 20 Feb 1909.jpg|thumb|350px|left|Observer newspaper cartoon of Captain Bradney while on the Auckland Harbour Board in 1909.]] 
Still later he rowed ferry boats plying between Auckland and [[Northcote, New Zealand|Northcote]], on Auckland's [[North Shore City|North Shore]]. He served on the ''Lily'', the first steamer to enter the [[Kaipara Harbour|Kaipara]] service, and then went abroad on deep-sea vessels.&lt;ref name="Auckland Star"&gt;''Auckland Star'' 26 May 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

While in [[Geelong]], near [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], Bradney met his future wife, Mary Jane Haxton, whom he married in Auckland in 1878 when he was a pilot on the [[Kaipara Harbour|Kaipara bar]]. He then worked for the [[Auckland Harbour Board]], and finally became a [[Waterman (occupation)|waterman]], one of the hardy band of men whose boats formed the means of communication between shore and ship.

In 1884 Captain Bradney joined forces with his brother-in-law Ernest Charles Binns (who had emigrated to New Zealand on the same ship, the ''Mermaid'') forming the firm of Bradney &amp; Binns with the launch ''Despatch''. The ''Vivid'' was purchased in 1892, and on 26 March 1904 Captain Bradney's daughter Blanche launched the ''Pitoitoi I''. The replacement ''Pitoitoi II'' was brought into service in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Zealand Herald'' 27 May 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm was succeeded by J H Bradney &amp; Sons in 1934, and at the time of Captain Bradney's death in 1936 was operating the ''Onewa'', ''Kaipatiki'', ''Matareka'', and ''Presto'', the latter being used by the port health officer.

==Lenormand cards==
In the mid 19th century after the death of the famous French fortune-teller [[Marie Anne Lenormand]], Lenormand's name was used on several cartomancy decks including a deck of 36 illustrated cards known as the Petit Lenormand or simply Lenormand cards still used extensively today. The 36 card Lenormand deck is modelled on a deck of cards published c1799 as part of ''Das Spiel der Hoffnung'' (''The Game of Hope''), a game of chance designed by Hechtel which was still being advertised in 1820. So-called Lenormand decks have the same card numbering, primary symbols and playing card associations as the cards in Hechtel's ''Das Spiel der Hoffnung'' game. Some examples of the game are included in an extensive collection of playing cards bequeathed to the [[British Museum]] by [[Lady Charlotte Guest|Lady Charlotte Schreiber]]. ''Das Spiel der Hoffnung'' is listed among Hechtel's works in an advertisement by publisher Gustav Philipp Jakob Bieling of Nuremberg dated 1799.&lt;ref name ="Bieling" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Luigi "Gino" Macaluso''' (9 June 1948 – 27 October 2010) was the President and Chairman of the [[Sowind group]], under whose roof a watch Manufacture and the two Brands [[Girard-Perregaux]] and JeanRichard are united. Since the long-term strategic cooperation agreement signed with [[PPR (company)|Kering]] in June 2008, he had also joined the Gucci Group Management Committee and the Boucheron Board of Directors.

==Career==
He was born in Turin, Italy, on 9 June 1948. He founded one of the major watch wholesaling company in Italy in 1982 (Blancpain, Breitling, Hamilton). In 1987, he became the Italian distributor of Girard-Perregaux, a company with a history going back to the year 1791, based in La Chaux-de-Fonds. Its Tourbillon with three Gold Bridges is regarded as a landmark in the history of Swiss watchmaking. In 1989, he joined the Company's board of Directors. On 15 September 1992, he took over Girard-Perregaux.&lt;ref&gt;ArmbandUhren, Special Girard-Perregaux, p. 66-69, "The Macaluso Family"&lt;/ref&gt;  Under his leadership, the firm refined its strategy, with a focus on the high-end segment.&lt;ref&gt;François Chaille, Girard-Perregaux, p. 120-123"&lt;/ref&gt;

Alter producing only quartz watches for almost 20 years, Macaluso turned Girard Perregaux into a genuine Manufacture. Since then, the brand builds high end mechanical watches with their own calibers, developed and manufactured in house. With his knowledge of architecture – he held a degree in the field– he was closely involved in the design of the Brand’s creations.

Macaluso was President of the AIHH (Fine watchmaking Professional Association) in 1999, 2001 and 2004.

On October 27th 2010, Luigi Macaluso unexpectedly died at age 62 after suffering a heart attack. Luigi was married to Monica and was the father of four children, Stefano, Massimo, Anna and Margherita. More than 10 years ago, his two sons joined him at the head of the Sowind Group.

An architect, former motor racing driver and entrepreneur, he had been behind the wheel of Girard-Perregaux since 1992. A firm believer in the value of an authentic Haute Horlogerie Manufacture, he pioneered the development of an integrated production strategy. A charismatic leader, he was able to make Sowind Group an essential player in Swiss Haute Horlogerie.

==Distinctions==
In 1998, Luigi Macaluso was awarded the [[Prix Gaïa]] for the entrepreneurship category, the highest distinction within the Swiss watchmaking world, attributed by the Musée International de l'Horlogerie.

In 2008, he was appointed a Grand Officer of the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]]. In 2009, he was appointed a Knight of the [[Order of Merit for Labour]].

==Motor sports==
Motor racing played a pivotal role in his life.&lt;ref&gt;Vanity Fair On Time, October 2009, “On the Road”, p. 37-38"&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1972, he won the title of [[European Rally Championship|European Rally Champion]] as co-driver to [[Raffaele Pinto]] in a [[Fiat 124 Sport Spider]]. In 1985, he joined the Club Italia, a not-for-profit organization promoting the Italian historic car patrimony and over which he presides.
In 2001, he was elected President of the CSAI, the Italian Motor Sport Federation. He served as President of the [[FIA]]’s Karting Commission and sat on the FIA World Council.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13239">{{Marketing}}'''Mass marketing''' is a market strategy in which a firm decides to ignore market segment differences and appeal the whole market with one offer or one strategy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Mass Marketing   |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/mass-marketing.html  |quote=Business Dictionary |accessdate = 2 May 2012 |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which supports the idea of broadcasting a message that will reach the largest number of people possible. Traditionally mass marketing has focused on radio, television and newspapers as the media used to reach this broad audience. By reaching the largest audience possible, exposure to the product is maximized, and in theory this would directly correlate with a larger number of sales or buys into the product.

Mass marketing is the opposite of [[niche marketing]], as it focuses on '''high sales and low prices''' and aims to provide products and services that will appeal to the whole market. Niche marketing targets a very specific segment of market; for example, specialized services or goods with few or no competitors.&lt;ref&gt;“Niche Market.” ''Business: The ultimate resource''. (2002). Cambridge, Mass: Perseus Publications:1294.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Mass marketing or undifferentiated marketing has its origins in the 1920s with the inception of mass [[radio]] use. This gave [[corporations]] an opportunity to appeal to a wide variety of potential customers. Due to this, variety marketing had to be changed in order to persuade a wide audience with different needs into buying the same thing. It has developed over the years into a worldwide multi-billion dollar industry. Although sagging in the Great Depression it regained popularity and continued to expand through the 40s and 50s. It slowed during the anti-capitalist movements of the 60's and 70's before coming back stronger than before in the 80's, 90's and today. These trends are due to corresponding upswings in mass media, the parent of mass marketing. For most of the twentieth century, major consumer-products companies held fast to mass marketing- mass-producing, mass distributing and mass promoting about the same product in about the same way to all consumers. Mass marketing creates the largest potential market, which leads to lowered costs.
It is also called overall marketing.

Over the years marketing activities have notably transitioned from traditional forms, such as television, radio and print advertisements to a more digitalized forms, such as the utilisation of online media platforms to reach various consumers. Huang (2009, as cited in Shyu et al., 2015), explains three chief attributes digital marketing has enhanced; one being “Penetrating Power” which is to have the ability to reach a wider circle of customers in the market, accredited to the ease of online communication. Digital marketing allows for a marketer to reach a larger-scale audience in a more efficient and cost-effective manner, which is ultimately what Mass Marketing seeks to do.&lt;ref&gt;Shyu, M., Chiang, W., Chien, W., &amp; Wang, S. (2015). Key success factors in Digital Marketing in Service Industry and the Development Strategies: A case study on Fleur De Chine at Sun Moon Lake. ''International Journal of Organizational Innovation, 8''(1), 172-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persuasion in mass marketing ==
For a mass marketing campaign to be successful, the advertisement must appeal to a “set of product needs that are common to most consumers in a target market.” (Bennett &amp; Strydom, 2001) In this case it is unnecessary to segment consumers into separate niches as, in theory, the product should appeal to any customer’s wants and/or needs. Many mass marketing campaigns have been successful through persuading audiences using the central route to persuasion, as well as using the peripheral route to persuasion, according to the [[Elaboration likelihood model|Elaboration Likelihood Model]].  Lane et al. state that the different types of persuasion depend on the “involvement, issue-relevant thinking, or elaboration that a person dedicates to a persuasive message.” (2013).&lt;ref&gt;Lane, R., Miller, A. N., Brown, C., &amp; Vilar, N. (2013). An Examination of the Narrative Persuasion with Epilogue through the lens of the Elaboration Likelihood Model. ''Communication Quarterly, 61''(4), 431-445. doi: 10.1080/01463373.2013.799510&lt;/ref&gt; Political campaigns are a prime example of central persuasion through mass marketing; where the content of the communication involves a detailed level of thinking which seeks to achieve a cognitive response. Contrastingly, a toothpaste advertisement would typically persuade the audience peripherally; where there is low involvement and consumers rely on “heuristics” to alter their behaviour. [[John Watson (psychologist)|John Watson]] was a leading [[psychologist]] in mass marketing with his experiments in advertising.

== Shotgun approach ==
The shotgun theory is an approach of mass marketing. It involves reaching as many people as possible through television, cable and radio. On the Web, it refers to a lot of [[advertising]] done through banners to text ads in as many websites as possible, in order to get enough eyeballs that will hopefully turn into sales. An example of shotgun marketing would be to simply place an ad on primetime television, without focusing on any specific group of audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techopedia.com/definition/24119/shotgun-approach |title=shotgun marketing &amp;#124;  |quote=Undifferentiated audience}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shotgun approach increases the odds of hitting a target when it is more difficult to focus on one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essentials of marketing |last1= Mc Daniel |first1= Carl|last2 = F.Hair|first2=Joseph|last3=Lamb|first3=Charles W.|isbn=0324656203|page=224 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9Kf_O1eI0J4C&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=marketing+approaches+-+shotgun+approach#v=onepage&amp;q=marketing%20approaches%20-%20shotgun%20approach&amp;f=false |date=January 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential limitation of using the shotgun approach is that each receiver will interpret the message in their own way, whether this be the way the sender intends for it to be decoded, or not. In other words, the receiver’s “frame of reference” at the time of decoding enables them to perceive a brand message in a particular way; thus, the marketer’s intention may be become distorted. Dahlen, Lange, &amp; Smith (2010) claim that each receiver has different “attitudes, values and perceptions stemming from knowledge, experience or the influence of other people.” In situations where there is no specific target market, mass marketers should simply focus on grabbing the attention of consumers in “different, surprising, original and entertaining” ways in order to generate the most desirable feedback. (Bigat, 2012).

== Guerrilla marketing ==
[[Guerrilla marketing]] aims to cut through clutter by attracting attention in unique, memorable and imaginative ways to “maximise interest in a firm’s goods and services while minimizing the costs of advertising.” (Bigat, 2012). According to Kotler (2007, as cited in Bigat, 2012) this type of marketing was traditionally carried out by small to medium sized enterprises but has become more predominant in today’s society where competition is substantially thicker. It is particularly effective at reaching a large-scale audience due to the captivating nature of the advertisement.

Bigat discusses the role of technology, more specifically, of the internet and its effectiveness of disseminating a large message from the sender to receivers; to which he states that “Internet blogs, online magazines, newspapers along with chat and forum pages are crucial arenas for getting the message across.” Logically, this is due to the fact that digitalised media generates more efficient feedback from consumers. Mass marketers should aim to effect the behaviour of their consumers by having them engage with the brand in a positive way, which, in turn tends to more activity (both on and offline) as well as further market penetration.&lt;ref&gt;Bigat, E. C. (2012). Guerrilla Advertisement and Marketing. ''Procedia – Social and Behavioral Sciences, 51''(1), 1022-1029. doi: 10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.08.281&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use and products sold ==
Mass marketing is used to effect attitude change to as wide an audience as possible. Often this would take the form of selling a product like [[toothpaste]]. Toothpaste isn't made specially for one consumer and it is sold in huge quantities. A company or individual who manufactures toothpaste wishes to get more people to buy their particular brand over another. The goal is when a consumer has the option to select a tube of toothpaste that the consumer would remember the product which was marketed. Mass marketing is the opposite of [[niche marketing]], where a product is made specially for one person or a group of persons. Other products of mass marketing are [[furniture]], [[Visual arts|artwork]], [[automobile]]s, residential communities, fizzy drinks and [[personal computer]]s. Typically, things which are perceived to be necessary/essential to the consumer are subject to mass marketing. Resources of mass marketing provide cost-effective marketing solutions for small and micro businesses, including start-ups. Even "products" like [[politicians]] and services from [[professions]] such as [[law]], [[chiropractic]] and [[medicine]], are subject to mass marketing.

== Questions of quality ==
To further increase profits, mass marketed products touted as "[[durable goods]]" are often made of substandard material, so that they deteriorate prematurely. This practice is called [[planned obsolescence]].  Not only does this lower production costs, but it ensures future sales opportunities by preventing the market from becoming saturated with high-quality, long-lasting goods. The forces of a [[free market]] tend to preclude the sale of substandard staples, while disposability, technological innovations, and a culture of collection all facilitate [[planned obsolescence]].

Many mass marketed items are considered [[staple food|staples]].  These are items people are accustomed to buying new when their old ones wear out (or are used up).  Cheaper versions of durable goods are often marketed as staples with the understanding that they will wear out sooner than more expensive goods, but they are so cheap that the cost of regular replacement is easily affordable.

==Benefits of mass marketing==
Since the target audience is broad, the number of successful hits is high despite the low probability of a single person turning up, and if all the efforts in one particular area goes in vain, the eventual loss is less compared to one in a narrowly focused area. Production costs per unit are low on account of having one production run for homogeneous product, and marketing research/advertising costs are also relatively low as well,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to travel and tourism marketing |last= Bennett | first= J. Alf |last2=Strydom | first2=Johan Wilhelm |year=2001 | page=62 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=USqcuWxTemEC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=benefits+of+mass+marketing#v=onepage&amp;q=benefits%20of%20mass%20marketing&amp;f=false |isbn = 0702156361 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which, as a whole, leads to higher potentials of sales volume and efficiency of scale in a much larger market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marketing |last1= L. Burrow | first1= James |last2 =Bosiljevac | first2=Jim |year=2005|publisher=South Western Educational Publishing | page=183 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=royU59GUZiEC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=marketing+approaches+-+mass+marketing+advantages#v=onepage&amp;q=marketing%20approaches%20-%20mass%20marketing%20advantages&amp;f=false | isbn= 0538446641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drawbacks of mass marketing ==
Due to increased competition and the complexity of consumers’ wants and needs in today’s society, Bennett and Strydom (2001) suggest that mass marketing campaigns are less likely to be successful; as consumers have a range of specific tastes and requirements that they would more likely find in alternative products.

'''Microtargeting''', often used by [[political party|political parties]] and [[election campaign]]s includes [[direct marketing]] [[datamining]] techniques that involve predictive [[market segmentation]] (aka [[cluster analysis]]). It is used by the [[United States]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] political parties, as well as candidates to track individual voters and identify potential supporters. The term "microtargeting" was coined in 2002 by political consultant Alexander P. Gage.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.technologyreview.com/s/509026/how-obamas-team-used-big-data-to-rally-voters/ How Obama’s Team Used Big Data to Rally Voters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://theaapc.org/about-us/board-of-directors/alex-gage/ ALEXANDER P. GAGE&lt;/ref&gt;

They use various means of communication such as direct mail, phone calls, home visits, television, radio, web advertising, email, and text messaging, among others,to communicate with voters, crafting messages to build support for fundraising, campaign events, volunteering, and eventually to turn them out to the polls on the [[election]] day. Microtargeting's tactics rely on transmitting a tailored message to a subgroup of the electorate on the basis of unique information about that subgroup.

==History==
Although some of the tactics of microtargeting had been used in [[California]] since 1992, it really started to be used nationally only in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]].&lt;ref name="Vander Veen"&gt;Chad Vander Veen, Zeroing In, [http://www.govtech.net/magazine/channel_story.php/97723 www.govtech.net, Jan 2, 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014132950/http://www.govtech.net/magazine/channel_story.php/97723 |date=2006-10-14 }}, accessed November 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In that year, [[Karl Rove]], along with [[Blaise Hazelwood]] at the [[Republican National Committee]], used it to reach voters in 18 states that [[George W. Bush|George W. Bush's]] reelection campaign was not able to reach by other means. The results were greater contacts with likely Bush voters. For example, in [[Iowa]] the campaign was able to reach 92% of eventual Bush voters (compared to 50% in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]]) and in [[Florida]] it was able to reach 84% (compared to 50% in 2000).&lt;ref name="Dreazen"&gt;[[Yochi Dreazen|Yochi J. Dreazen]], Democrats, Playing Catch-Up, Tap Database to Woo Potential Voters, ''The Wall Street Journal'', October 31, 2006, A1.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this pioneering work was done by [[Alex Gage]] and his firm, TargetPoint Consulting.

Democrats did limited microtargeting in 2004, with some crediting microtargeting for Kerry's win in Iowa in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, T: ''New Math: How a trio of savvy Kerry campaign workers used a fresh voter equation to win Iowa.'', web only. American Prospect, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Some news accounts credited Republican superiority in that area for victories in that election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kettle, "How Democrats missed the vote", ''The Guardian'', November 3, 2006 [http://commentisfree.guardian.co.uk/martin_kettle/2006/11/better_policies_or_better_micr.html], accessed February 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Democrats later developed microtargeting capabilities for the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 election cycle]].&lt;ref name="Vander Veen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dreazen" /&gt; "It's no secret that the other side [Republicans] figured this out a little sooner", said Josh Syrjamaki, director of the Minnesota chapter of [[America Votes]] in October 2006. "They've had four to six years' jump on us on this stuff...but we feel like we can start to catch up."&lt;ref name="Balz"&gt;Dan Balz, Democrats Aim to Regain Edge In Getting Voters to the Polls, ''Washington Post'', October 8, 2006, accessed November 7, 2006. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/07/AR2006100700388.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 2016]], [[Cambridge Analytica]] played a role in first promoting [[Ted Cruz]] and, eventually, [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|journal=The Times|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/world/trump-calls-in-brexit-experts-to-target-voters-pf0hwcts9|title=Data scientists target 20 million new voters for Trump|author=Rhys Blakely|date=2016-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the claims of Cambridge Analytica's influence, made by its managers, have not been proven, and Cruz's opponent [[Ben Carson]] was ultimately unsuccessful even though he, too, involved Cambridge Analytica in his campaign.&lt;ref name="20161206spiegel"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==
Microtargeting is a modification of a practice used by commercial direct marketers. It would not be possible on a large scale without the development of large and sophisticated [[database]]s that contain data about as many voters as possible. The database essentially tracks voter habits in the same ways that companies like [[Visa (company)|Visa]] track consumer spending habits. The [[Republican National Committee|Republican National Committee's]] database is called [[Voter Vault]]. The Democratic National Committee effort is called VoteBuilder.&lt;ref name="VoteBuilder"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/campaign-2008/dnc-holds-national-training-as-it-rolls-ut-new-oter-file-2007-08-15.html|work=The Hill|title=DNC holds national training as it rolls out new voter file|date=August 15, 2007|author=Aaron Blake}}&lt;/ref&gt; A parallel Democratic effort is being developed by [[Catalist]], a $9 million initiative headed by [[Harold M. Ickes|Harold Ickes]],&lt;ref name="Dreazen" /&gt; while the leading non-partisan database is offered by [[Aristotle, Inc.|Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="Aristotle" &gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2007/12/aristotle200712|work=Vanity Fair|title=Big Brother Inc.|date=December 3, 2007|author=James Verini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The databases contain specific information about a particular voter (party affiliation, frequency of voting, contributions, volunteerism, etc.) with other activities and [[Habit (psychology)|habits]] available from commercial [[data brokers]] such as [[Acxiom]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}, [[Dun &amp; Bradstreet]], Experian Americas, and [[InfoUSA]]. Such personal information is a "product" sold to interested companies. These data are particularly illuminating when portrayed through a [[geographic information system]] (GIS), where trends based on location can be mapped alongside dozens or hundreds of other variables. This geographic depiction also makes it ideal for volunteers to visit potential voters (armed with lists in hand, laid out in the shortest route—much like how [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] pre-determine delivery routes).

These databases are then [[datamining|mined]] to identify issues important to each voter and whether that voter is more likely to identify with one party or another. Political information is obviously important here, but consumer preferences can play a role as well. Individual voters are then put into groups on the basis of sophisticated computer modeling. Such groups have names like "Downscale Union Independents", "Tax and Terrorism Moderates," and "Older Suburban Newshounds."&lt;ref name="Dreazen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Balz" /&gt;

Once a multitude of voting groups is established according to these criteria and their minute political differences, then the tailored messages can be sent via the appropriate means. While political parties and candidates once prepared a single television advertisement for general broadcast nationwide, it is now not at all uncommon to have several dozen variations on the one message, each with a unique and tailored message for that small demographic sliver of the voting public. This is the same for radio advertisement, direct mail, email, as well as stump speeches and fundraising events.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8412">'''Microthermoforming''' is the abbreviation for [[microscopic scale|microscopic]] or microscale [[thermoforming]], or, more precisely, for thermoforming of microproducts or [[microstructure]] products. Microstructure products means products that have structures in the [[micrometre]] range and have their technical function provided by the shape of the microstructure [1]. Thermoforming [2] in turn means shaping of heated and therefore softened semi finished products in the form of [[thermoplastic]] [[polymer]] films or plates with their edges fixed by three-dimensional stretching. Shaping is carried out mainly by forming the films or plates into female moulds (negative forming) or over male moulds (positive forming). While the other polymer microreplication processes such as micro [[injection moulding]] or (vacuum) hot embossing are primary forming processes where forming occurs already in a molten, liquid phase of the heated polymer material, microthermoforming is a secondary forming process where forming occurs in a strongly softened, but still solid phase of the heated polymer.

Moulds for polymer microreplication in general and in particular for microthermoforming can be fabricated by various methods such as mechanical micromachining, lithographic based methods in combination with electroplating (see also the so-called '[[LIGA]]' process) and wet or dry etching. And they can be fabricated of various materials such as metal, silicon and glass.

== State of the art ==
For several years now, at [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] (KIT), a pressure or high pressure (thermo)forming process is used to fabricate film microchips for [[capillary electrophoresis]] (CE) [3–5] and for three-dimensional cell cultivation [6–8]. The process is derived from the macroscopic trapped sheet forming process [2]. This is a simple variation of vacuum or pressure forming without prestretching, i.e. a single stage forming, into a female mould with heating of the plastic sheet using a contact heating plate inside the forming station. The forming air is supplied via through holes in the heating plate. Still in a laboratory scale process, diverse thermoplastic films also from biodegradable polymers such as [[polycaprolactone]] (PCL) with thicknesses typically between 20 and 100&amp;nbsp;µm are thermoformed. This is performed with gas pressures up to 5 MPa into mechanically micromachined cavities of plate shaped micromoulds from brass.

First examples of processes coming near to something that could be called 'microthermoforming' originate from the second half of the nineties. So, in 1993, dome shaped polymer microstructures for use in electrical membrane switches were fabricated [9]. This was done between a mating upper and lower metal emboss die with a concave and a convex detail, respectively, first in a hot, then in a second cold press. And in 1999, corrugated sheet like polymer microstructures for use e.g. in electrostatic actuators were fabricated [10]. This was also done between heated tools and counter tools, namely in discontinuous processes between stamps or in continuous processes between rollers. Partly, the counter tool was a soft one in the form of a thicker, unpatterned film or plate made from an easily deformable, e.g. [[elastomeric]] material which is able to assume the shape of the hard, metallic tool. In 2006, at the School of Polymer, Textile and Fiber Engineering (PTFE) of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] (GIT), the same technology approach was used to fabricate similar corrugated sheet like structures in a so-called 'rubber-assisted hot embossing process' [11].

== Features and applications ==
The microthermoforming process including its products can have all the advantageous properties of the powerful macroscopic production process. Moreover, the thermoformed microparts have additional, specific properties appearing only in microscale dimensions and resulting from their unusual morphology. Thermoformed e.g. [[microfluidic]] structures have free standing microcavities such as channels and reservoirs and they are thin walled partly in the range of a few micrometers. Specific properties of thermoformed microparts are, amongst others, their high flexibility, their small volume and mass, their low thermal resistance and heat capacity, and their low light absorbance and background fluorescence. Morphology and properties of these microparts now can result in improved or even new, so far unthought of applications.

Compared to the other microreplication processes, in microthermoforming, modifications of the film to be formed remain preserved beyond the forming step due to the already mentioned material coherence during this secondary forming process. This enables surface and bulk modification and functionalisation of the three-dimensionally formed films or membranes, namely as highly resolved micro- and nanopatterns, and all side, i.e. on hardly accessible side walls and even behind [[undercut (manufacturing)|undercuts]]. Thus, e.g. thermoformed chips for three-dimensional cell cultivation can be provided with pores, cell adhesion patterns [6–8], surface topologies and electrodes [12].

Future application fields for microthermoforming are expected to be

* generally life sciences, e.g. flexible film microchips such as [[µTAS]] (Micro Total Analysis Systems) and LOC ([[Lab-on-a-chip]]) devices, possibly in continuous format and combined with polytronic circuits, also as human implants
* especially [[tissue engineering]], e.g. film substrates or scaffolds for three-dimensional cell cultivation in fundamental research, medical diagnosis, pharmaceutical active substance research, and clinical research and therapy, particularly if integrated in standard laboratory platforms such as petri dishes and microtitre plates
* micropackaging, e.g. micro sensor and actuator housings or caps
* [[smart textiles]] etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8735">'''Mobile location analytics''' (MLA) refers to technology for retailers, including developing aggregate reports used to reduce waiting times at checkouts, improving store layouts, and understanding consumer shopping patterns. The reports are generated by recognizing the [[Wi-Fi]] or [[Bluetooth]] addresses of cell phones as they interact with store networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mobile Location Analytics Code of Conduct |url=http://www.futureofprivacy.org/wp-content/uploads/10.22.13-FINAL-MLA-Code.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Futureofprivacy.org|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By seeing the movement of devices, retailers can gather data that will help them optimize such things as floor plan layouts, advertisement placement and checkout lane staffing. MLA products work by capturing a device's MAC address, the unique 12-digit number that is assigned to a specific hardware device. This number can be detected by WiFi or Bluetooth sensors.  There are separate MAC addresses for WiFi and Bluetooth. 
[[IBeacon|Beacons]] are also used for MLA purposes and they work with Bluetooth.  Through this technology, they are also able to send push notifications. Recently companies started using the combination of WiFi and Bluetooth to improve accuracy and reliability of the MLA devices. The technology works as people walk through stores; the tracking companies find their wireless signal and assign the device a random number. They monitor that number as it moves across the screen and analyze patterns in the data.

==Uses ==
A number of industries can benefit from MLA services including retail, real estate, energy, insurance, manufacturing, healthcare, government, planning, and public safety. For example, retail businesses can compare sales revenue and evaluate marketing campaign effectiveness. Businesses can determine where to open stores and distribute their products. MLA is also beneficial for emergency cases. Hospitals can determine demand for new vaccines or make sense of sudden disease outbreaks. This is possible because every information system, desktop solution, or mobile app can take advantage of the location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insights.wired.com/profiles/blogs/location-analytics-where-the-future-will-be#axzz3Fly85C9N|title=Location Analytic s: The Future is Where|publisher=Insights.wired.com|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical stores have tools to collect data on their shoppers by monitoring their movement and their pauses. Video monitoring can provide up to 10,000 data points per store visitor. This allows stores to develop heat maps so they can put the items they want to sell in high traffic areas.
If a mobile device is stolen by theft, this can be found by police by tracing the mobile number.

==In-store analytics==
In-store analytics has become more like online store analytics.  Stores can see where shoppers go and where they linger, detect whether they are shopping alone or with friends or children, and match shopping to weather.  Mobile Location Analytics is helping stores in many ways. One company with small stores located in malls found that the space just inside the entry was a dead zone, so they moved the popular items further inside the store. Another store couldn’t tell which display sold more effectively because they had duplicate inventory.  They were about to remove the wall displays when they decided to check traffic with a Mobile Location Analytics company. After creating a heat map, they made the floor displays smaller and easier for customers to walk through to reach the wall displays. The stores want analytics to see if the displays erected at the end of aisles eat away the sales of the same item stacked halfway down the aisle or if they contribute to additional sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://augustcapital.typepad.com/news/2012/08/e-commerce-style-big-data-analytics-meet-brick-and-mortar-retailers.html|title=AugustCapital|publisher=Augustcaptial.typepad.com|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mobile location analytics company can be used for counting, so they can ensure stores are staffed appropriately for the traffic at all times of the day. It helps businesses make better correlations between transaction data and traffic. So now they can find opportunities that they might be missing.  According to a study, brick-and-mortar’s accounts for 93% of sales.  Therefore, the retail store remains a critical focus.
It makes easier to find airport, bus stand etc.

==Privacy==
Privacy is also a concern.  The privacy agreement comes at a time when brick-and-mortar retailers are eager to have access to the kind of information about consumer behavior that can match Web retailers like Amazon. The move also reflects how industry is responding to public concern over the collection of personal data. As companies increasingly use data in more robust ways such as targeting online ads or tracking physical location, they are realizing the need to give users more control over how data is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evidon.com/blog/retail-industry-and-mobile-device-tracking|title=The Retail Industry and Mobile Device Tracking - Online Marketing Intelligence, Web Analytic s, Privacy - Evident|publisher=Evident.com|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although products dealing with mobile location analytics do not record personally identifiable information about specific customers, they have generated concerns about customer data integration and [[consumer privacy]]. Several MLA companies have worked with United States Senator, Charles Schemer and the Future of Privacy Forum to develop a smart phone tracking code of conduct. Under the voluntary code of conduct, MLA vendors and retailers will inform customers when they are being tracked and allow individual customers to opt out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/mobile-location-analytics-MLA|title=What is mobile location analytics (MLA)? - Definition from What Is.com|publisher=Search business analytics.tech target.com|accessdate=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems Reusing WiFi access points==

Nowadays most Wifi router or access points vendors provides an API for listening the device's MAC address of the signals to identify smartphones, this is the base of solution vendors of Wifi tracking and analytics systems, but almost new smartphones emit more than one MAC address when they are not connected to the WiFi. 
An iPhone can produce a lot of different and/or false MAC addresses when visit a venue during 30-40 minutes, because every time you touch the screen and awake from sleep mode the MAC address changes.

Wifi tracking solution vendors are dealing with data based on these false MAC addresses if they try to detect not associated devices, and only if the smartphone connects  to the WiFi access point to have free internet access (then it is associated) they can detected the true MAC address of the iPhone. But not so much people of total customers use the free internet service, in general less than 10-20%.

==Other alternative==

There is another technology for MLA is Seeketing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seeketing.com/corp/index.php/en|title=Seeketing.com|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2017/07/26/talento_digital/1501081908_570798.html|title=Elpais.com|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expansion.com/economia-digital/innovacion/2017/02/07/5898699722601d000c8b472d.html|title=Expansion.com|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This technology based in specific radio sensors and SDKs provides solution for unique device identifier both online and offline, and  can be integrated with other infrastructure: WEB sites, landing pages, WIFI,CRM, APPs, POS, Digital Screens and digital advertising networks, among others. 

Seeketing works listening 2,4 Ghz and 5 Ghz frequency bands (even they can work with other cellular bands) not only listening MAC addresses. It can recognize patterns of signals based in full signal parameters. Seeketing nodes can detect and identify approximately 70-80% of total smartphones in their coverage area (15.000 square meters) but reusing Wifi access points we can only ensure to detect and identify 10-20% (those who are connected to WiFi access point).
And even it can we used to send messages to smartphones with APPs installed or without APP installed, similar to ibeacon interaction with Apps are possible,  and similar to eddystone beacons interaction with Webs are possible with Seeketing technology.

'''Moses Herman Cone''' (June 29, 1857 &amp;ndash; December 8, 1908) was an American [[textile]] [[entrepreneur]], [[conservation movement|conservationist]], and [[philanthropist]] of the [[Gilded Age]] who was active in the southern [[United States]].  He began his career in sales and became an innovator who offered finished clothing, which was unusual in an era when textiles were normally sold as unfinished cloth.

Cone manufactured unusual textile fabrics and founded a company that became a leading manufacturer of [[denim]]. [[Cone Mills Corporation|His company]] was a major supplier to [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi Strauss and Company]] for nearly a century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualblueridge.com/parkway_tour/parks/293_0 Moses H. Cone Memorial Park &amp; Flat Top Manor (Milepost 294.1)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueridgeheritage.com/HistoricBlueRidge/HistoricSites/MosesConeManor.html Historic Blue Ridge sites - Moses Cone Manor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227111405/http://www.blueridgeheritage.com/HistoricBlueRidge/HistoricSites/MosesConeManor.html |date=2007-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr. Cone and his wife had no children and donated substantial property upon their deaths.  Their home [[Flat Top Manor]] has become a [[North Carolina]] tourist attraction that receives 250,000 visitors a year.  It forms part of [[Moses H. Cone Memorial Park]], which is run by the [[National Park Service]].  Their donations founded the [[Moses Cone Health System]], a private not-for-profit health care system based in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] and its principal facility [[Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital|The Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital]].

== Early life ==
Moses Herman Cone was born in 1857 in [[Jonesborough, Tennessee]]. He was the eldest of thirteen children of [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish-German]] [[immigrants]]. His parents, Herman Kahn and Helen Guggenheimer, emigrated from [[Germany]] to America in the 1840s. Moses' father changed his last name from Kahn to "Cone" almost immediately upon arrival in the United States to become more [[United States|American]].&lt;ref&gt;Noblitt, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses' father Herman had a [[dry goods]] and [[grocery]] business in Jonesborough along with his brother-in-law Jacob Adler, the husband of his sister Sophia. While running the business Herman and Jacob would alternately make week-long peddling trips selling their [[Product (business)|wares]]. On one of these trips Herman met Helen Guggenheimer near [[Lynchburg, Virginia]]. They married in 1856 and Moses was born in 1857. Two years later came their next child named Ceaser with whom Moses enjoyed a close relationship all his life.&lt;ref&gt;Noblitt, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The family lived in Jonesborough until 1870 and had an additional five children there. Between  1857 and 1870 Moses' father became fairly well-to-do through his business affairs and real estate ventures. The family then moved to [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. There Moses' father and relatives started a wholesale grocery business called ''Guggenheimer, Cone, &amp; Company, Wholesale Grocers''.&lt;ref&gt;Noblitt, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1873 Jacob Adler also moved to Baltimore and went in partnership with Herman selling groceries. They formed a new firm that was called ''Cone &amp; Adler''. They ran the business successfully and in 1878 dissolved it.&lt;ref name="Noblitt, p. 8"&gt;Noblitt, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; This same year Moses' parents had their last child.

== Adult life ==
Moses and Ceasar, now as young adults, immediately formed a new firm with their father. It was called ''H. Cone &amp; Sons.'' Moses and his brother Ceasar were "drummers" (traveling salesmen) for their father's dry goods firm. They sold their wares from [[Maryland]] to [[Alabama]].&lt;ref name="Noblitt, p. 8"/&gt;

In the 1880s the Cones then moved to Eutaw Place in Baltimore, on the same street as the Lindau family. In 1884, Moses began to court Bertha Lindau, the eldest daughter. Moses and Bertha in all likelihood met at a community social club called the "Sociables."{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} Moses' and Bertha's courtship would last four years, during which time Bertha was also wooed by others, including Moses' own brother Ceasar.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Wedge, Lucius. [http://www.immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=227 "Moses Herman Cone."] In ''Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present'', vol. 3, edited by Giles R. Hoyt. German Historical Institute. Last modified February 24, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses and Bertha were both from German Jewish descendants and had much in common. In addition, they both were firstborn children from large families. They married on February 15, 1888,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and would have no children themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Noblitt, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
===Early years with textiles===
Moses and Ceasar dealt much with textile mill owners in their travels as salesmen. They not only sold normal dry goods, but introduced into their wares ready-made clothing as well as certain fabrics like [[denim]]. This gave them experience then in [[textile]] products and the textile industry. The Cone brothers soon invested in Southern textile mills which generally had over a 20% return on average.&lt;ref&gt;Noblitt, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; One of these companies the Cones invested into was ''C. E. Graham Manufacturing Company'' of [[Asheville, North Carolina]], an up-and-coming newly formed textile mill. Moses became its president in 1882. The company's original builder Charles Edward Graham continued with its on-site management while Moses pursued other investments and ventures.&lt;ref&gt;Noblitt, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880 Moses moved to [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. Soon thereafter he joined Simon Lowman and Charles Burger to form ''Cone Brothers, Lowman, and Burger Clothing Manufacturers'' based in Baltimore. Moses discovered the need for durable clothing for the blue-collar people of the High Country and fulfilled this need with [[denim]] and plain, fabric-based clothing.

===Cone Export &amp; Commission Company===
{{See also|Cone Mills Corporation}}
In 1890 Moses and Ceasar were contemplating even grander ventures and formed the ''Cone Export &amp; Commission Company'' in [[New York City]] along with Anderson Price and Jay C. Guggenheimer as the other major stockholders. They developed what was called the "Plaid Trust" which was a commission clearing house to stabilize the production market on [[Check (fabric)|checks]] and [[Plaid (pattern)|plaid]]s. They were a marketer of Southern cloth mill-goods to [[South America]] in competition with [[Great Britain]]. Initially the par value of the capital stock of their new company was fifty dollars per share. There were 20,000 shares of the company, so the value of this new firm was placed at one million dollars. Eventually they took in another forty mills over time to capture control of this market, but their ambitious goal was never fully achieved.

In 1895 Moses purchased a defunct steel mill and developed it into a large cotton mill called Proximity that produced blue and brown denim. He built additional mills throughout the Greensboro area and [[Deep South|the deep South]] and soon became one of the biggest producers of the [[denim]] [[fabric]] in the world.,&lt;ref&gt;Noblitt, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; becoming known as "The Denim King" in the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Noblitt, pp. 20-24&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the twentieth century he began supplying denim to Levi Strauss and Company, a relationship that the Greensboro firm retains to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mastgeneralstore.com/msledger/august2005/productspotmastjean-ome.php3 The Mast Store Jean-ome Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109020726/http://www.mastgeneralstore.com/msledger/august2005/productspotmastjean-ome.php3 |date=2008-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cone Mills Corporation]] was the world leader in the manufacturing of denim and largest supplier in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.unc.edu/mss/inv/c/Cone_Mills_Corporation.html Inventory of the Cone Mills Corporation Records, 1858–1997]&lt;/ref&gt; Moses was instrumental in the development of Watauga Academy, now known as [[Appalachian State University]]. In 1899, Moses donated $500 to the founders; it was the largest single donation received for the school's construction.&lt;ref&gt;Rhododendron, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
Moses died at age 51 in 1908 of [[pulmonary edema]] at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Moses H. Cone Dead. |quote=Wealthy Greensboro Merchant Succumbs at Johns Hopkins. |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=December 9, 1908 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The grave of Moses Cone is on the Cone Estate property approximately a mile by trail from the manor.

==Widow and sisters==
His childless wife Bertha lived an additional 39 years and donated the [[Flat Top Mansion]] property to [[Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital|the Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital]].
A few years later the hospital conveyed the property to the [[National Park System]] with the proviso that it be known as the [[Moses H. Cone Memorial Park]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blowingrock.org/mosescone.html Moses H. Cone Memorial Park history information]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cone sisters]], Claribel and Etta, were two of Moses' younger sisters. They befriended [[Picasso]] and [[Matisse]] while living amongst the [[School of Paris]] in its prime in Europe. The Cone Collection is one of the greatest in the world for these artists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Baltimore Museum of Art#Cone collection|Cone Collection at the Baltimore Museum of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Old Street''' is a [[street]] in central and east [[London]] that runs west to east from [[Goswell Road]] in [[Clerkenwell]], in the [[London Borough of Islington]], via [[St Luke's, London|St Luke's]] and [[Old Street Roundabout]], to the crossroads where it meets [[Shoreditch High Street]] (south), [[Kingsland Road]] (north) and [[Hackney Road]] (east) in [[Shoreditch]] in the [[London Borough of Hackney]].

The nearest [[List of London Underground stations|London Underground station]] is [[Old Street tube station|Old Street]] on the [[Northern line]]. It is also on the [[National Rail]] [[Northern City Line]].

The western part of Old Street, the area in central London, is inside the boundary of the Central London Congestion Charging Zone.

==History==
[[File:Finsbury Met. B Ward Map 1952.svg|thumb|left|A map showing Old Street ward of Finsbury Metropolitan Borough as it appeared in 1952.]]
Old Street was recorded as ''Ealdestrate'' in about 1200, and ''le Oldestrete'' in 1373. As befits its name there are some suggestions that the road is of ancient origin. It lies on the route of an old Roman or possibly pre-Roman track connecting [[Calleva Atrebatum|Silchester]] and [[Camulodunum|Colchester]], skirting round the walls of [[Londinium]], today the areas known as the [[City of London]]. 

The western part was widened between 1872 and 1877, but it narrows east of Coronet Street; there survive, at Nos. 340-342 on the south side of the street and Nos. 323 and 325-329 on the north side, some domestic buildings from the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, though somewhat battered and altered in function. At the east end of Old Street there is a notable deviation of the line of the street as it joins the old Roman Road north to [[York]]. This deviation is visible on old maps but unexplained, and is today fronted by [[Shoreditch Town Hall]] and the former Shoreditch Magistrates Court (now a hotel). Together with [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]] at the east end of Old Street, this was the civic hub of the former [[Metropolitan Borough of Shoreditch]].

The eastern half of the road is on the [[London Inner Ring Road]] and forms part of the boundary of the [[London congestion charge]] zone. Old Street and the surrounding areas of [[Hoxton Square]] and Great Eastern Street host a thriving night life. The street and its adjacent areas have attracted IT and tech companies, both established and start-ups, and Old Street Roundabout, located at the junction with [[City Road]], has been dubbed [[Old_Street_Roundabout#Silicon_Roundabout|Silicon Roundabout]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/silicon-roundabout London's Silicon Roundabout] Wired UK, 29 January 2010, accessed November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old Street station]] is located under the roundabout. With the increase in passenger numbers using the station, in 2014 [[Transport for London]] announced that it was to offer [[pop-up retail]] space there as part of a drive to increase its revenue.&lt;ref&gt;https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2014/april/pop-up-shops-arrive-at-old-street-tube-station-to-reflect-the-vibrancy-of-tech-city&lt;/ref&gt; 

Within the past few years Old Street has become a favoured location for notable graffiti artists such as [[Banksy]] and [[Jef Aérosol]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Banksy has featured several pieces on "Shoreditch Bridge".&lt;ref name="Bankys Old Street Art"&gt;[http://www.artofthestate.co.uk/Banksy/Banksy_Have_A_Nice_day_cops.htm "Example of Banksy Art on Old Street"], 1 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Snowflake-schema.png|350px|thumb|The snowflake schema is a variation of the star schema, featuring normalization of dimension tables.]]
In [[computing]], a '''snowflake schema''' is a [[Logical schema|logical arrangement]] of tables in a [[multidimensional database]] such that the [[Entity-relationship model|entity relationship]] diagram resembles a [[snowflake]]  shape. The snowflake schema is represented by centralized [[fact table]]s which are connected to multiple [[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimensions]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}.  "Snowflaking" is a method of normalizing the dimension tables in a [[star schema]]. When it is completely normalized along all the dimension tables, the resultant structure resembles a snowflake with the [[fact table]] in the middle. The principle behind snowflaking is normalization of the dimension tables by removing low cardinality attributes and forming separate tables.&lt;ref&gt;Paulraj Ponniah. ''Data Warehousing Fundamentals for IT Professionals.'' Wiley, 2010, pp. 29–32. {{ISBN|0470462078}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The snowflake schema is similar to the star schema. However, in the snowflake schema, dimensions are [[Normalization (database)|normalized]] into multiple related tables, whereas the star schema's dimensions are denormalized with each dimension represented by a single table. A complex snowflake shape emerges when the dimensions of a snowflake schema are elaborate, having multiple levels of relationships, and the child tables have multiple parent tables ("forks in the road").

== Common uses ==
Star and snowflake schemas are most commonly found in dimensional [[data warehouse]]s and [[data mart]]s where speed of data retrieval is more important than the efficiency of data manipulations. As such, the tables in these schemas are not normalized much, and are frequently designed at a level of normalization short of [[third normal form]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

== Data normalization and storage ==
[[Database normalization|Normalization]] splits up data to avoid redundancy (duplication) by moving commonly repeating groups of data into new tables. Normalization therefore tends to increase the number of tables that need to be joined in order to perform a given query, but reduces the space required to hold the data and the number of places where it needs to be updated if the data changes.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

From a space storage point of view, dimensional tables are typically small compared to fact tables. This often negates the potential storage-space benefits of the star schema as compared to the snowflake schema. Example: One million sales transactions in 300 shops in 220 countries would result in 1,000,300 records in a star schema (1,000,000 records in the fact table and 300 records in the dimensional table where each country would be listed explicitly for each shop in that country). A more normalized snowflake schema with country keys referring to a country table would consist of the same 1,000,000 record fact table, a 300 record shop table with references to a country table with 220 records. In this case, the star schema, although further denormalized, would only reduce the number or records by a (negligible) factor of ~0.9998 (=[1,000,000+300] divided by [1,000,000+300+220])

Some database developers compromise by creating an underlying snowflake schema with [[View (database)|views]] built on top of it that perform many of the necessary joins to simulate a star schema. This provides the storage benefits achieved through the normalization of dimensions with the ease of querying that the star schema provides. The tradeoff is that requiring the server to perform the underlying joins automatically can result in a performance hit when querying as well as extra joins to tables that may not be necessary to fulfill certain queries.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

== Benefits ==
The snowflake schema is in the same family as the [[star schema]] logical model. In fact, the [[star schema]] is considered a special case of the snowflake schema. The snowflake schema provides some advantages over the [[star schema]] in certain situations, including:

* Some [[OLAP]] multidimensional database modeling tools are optimized for snowflake schemas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings09/103-2009.pdf |title=Using SAS® OLAP Server for a ROLAP Scenario|first=Michelle|last=Wilkie|work=SAS Global Forum 2009|date=2009|accessdate=2013-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Database normalization|Normalizing]] attributes results in storage savings, the tradeoff being additional complexity in source query joins.

== Disadvantages ==
The primary disadvantage of the snowflake schema is that the additional levels of attribute normalization adds complexity to source query joins, when compared to the [[star schema]].

Snowflake schemas, in contrast to flat single table dimensions, have been heavily criticised. Their goal is assumed to be an efficient and compact storage of normalised data but this is at the significant cost of poor performance when browsing the joins required in this dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

|quote = Do not snowflake your dimensions, even if they are large
|pages = 95–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; This disadvantage may have reduced in the years since it was first recognized, owing to better query performance within the browsing tools.

When compared to a highly [[Database normalization|normalized]] transactional schema, the snowflake schema's [[denormalization]] removes the data integrity assurances provided by normalized schemas. {{citation needed|date=August 2014|reason=This comment is pretty much the antithesis of most critiques of snowflakes (normalized) vs. unrolled and denormalized single table dimensions, as favored by Kimball.}} Data loads into the snowflake schema must be highly controlled and managed to avoid update and insert anomalies.

== Examples ==
[[Image:Snowflake-schema-example.png|300px|thumb|right|Snowflake schema used by example query.]]

The example schema shown to the right is a snowflaked version of the star schema example provided in the [[star schema]] article.

The following example query is the snowflake schema equivalent of the star schema example code which returns the total number of units sold by brand and by country for 1997. Notice that the snowflake schema query requires many more joins than the star schema version in order to fulfill even a simple query. The benefit of using the snowflake schema in this example is that the storage requirements are lower since the snowflake schema eliminates many duplicate values from the dimensions themselves.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3534">The '''Spreckels Sugar Company''' is an [[United States|American]] [[sugar beet]] refiner that for many years controlled much of the [[West Coast of the United States|U.S. West Coast]] refined sugar market. It is currently headquartered in [[Brawley, California]].

==History==
The Spreckels Sugar Company was founded by entrepreneur, industrialist, newspaper publisher, and railroad executive [[Claus Spreckels]] (1828–1908) in February 1899. He founded the [[company town]] of [[Spreckels, California]], just south of the city of [[Salinas, California]], in 1897, but his descendants began to relinquish control when they started selling homes in the community to the public c. 1925. In 1891, [[Henry O. Havemeyer]], who controlled The American Sugar Refining Company (The Sugar Trust), bought half of the stock of the Western Sugar Company, thus giving his company control of the Hawaiian sugar and of the markets west of the [[Mississippi River]]. When it was completed in 1899, Spreckels' "Factory 1" was the largest sugar refinery in the United States and the third-largest in the world. Shipping to and from the plant was mostly by a private Spreckels-owned narrow-gauge railroad system connecting to the docks at [[Moss Landing, California]]. The factory was just north of the [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]] at {{coord| 36|37|7|N| 121|39|5|W| type:landmark_region:US-CA| display=inline,title}}.

On Claus Spreckels' death, his second son [[Adolph B. Spreckels]] (1857–1924) assumed the management of Spreckels Sugar Company. Adolph's wife's nephew, [[Charles Edouard de Bretteville]], eventually took over as head of the company and in 1949 led a group that purchased control. In 1963, the family sold their interests to [[Domino Foods|Amstar]]. In 1987, a management team bought out the Spreckels Sugar Division; in 1996, it was sold to [[Imperial Sugar|Imperial Holly Corp.]] of [[Sugar Land, Texas]], who owned it until 2005 when it was sold to [[Southern Minnesota Beet Sugar Cooperative]] of [[Renville, Minnesota]].

Spreckels Boulevard outside Salinas, as well as Spreckels Road outside [[King City, California]] and Spreckels Boulevard in [[Manteca, California]], still bear witness to the mark Spreckels Sugar made in the area.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/03/19/sugar-factory-stunk-to-olfactory/&lt;/ref&gt;

American author [[John Steinbeck]] worked on ranches owned by Spreckels Sugar throughout the Salinas Valley in the early 1920s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22799">'''Teleadministration''' is based on the concept that documents in electronic format have legal value. Administrative informatics is not new, but for many years it was merely Information Technology applied to legal documents, that is, the reproduction of paper-based legal documents into electronic file systems. Instead, Teleadministration turns this approach into its head. It is based on research conducted in 1978, the year when, at a conference promoted by the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]], [[:it:Giovanni Duni|Giovanni Duni]] launched the then-futuristic idea that an electronic document could have legal value.&lt;ref&gt;1. Duni, G., L'utilizzabilità delle tecniche elettroniche nell'emanazione degli atti e nei procedimenti amministrativi. Spunto per una teoria dell'atto amministrativo emanato nella forma elettronica, in "Rivista amm. della Repubblica italiana", 1978, pag.407 ss.&lt;/ref&gt; 1978 was also the year in which the first research on digital signatures ([[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]])&lt;ref&gt;2. Rivest, Shamir e [[Leonard Adleman|Adleman]], A method for obtaining digital signature and public key cryptosystems, in Communications of the ACM, vol. 21, febbraio 1978, 120-126. This research referred to the asymmetric encryption technology (Diffie and Hellman, New directions in Cryptography, in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, November 1976, 644 ss. Diffie and Hellman’s research was disseminated in Italy by  Gardner, “Un nuovo tipo di cifrario che richiederebbe milioni di anni per essere decifrato”, in Le Scienze, December 1977, 126 ss.), who added the regulation for issuing the keys and the public certification process associated to them.&lt;/ref&gt; was published in the United States, yet it would take more than twenty-five years for jurists and mathematicians to start working together.&lt;ref&gt;3. The first application of the research by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman was the 1995 Utah Code, § from 46-3-101 to 46-3-504 (Enacted by l. 1995, ch. 61). The Utah code was analysed in the brilliant dissertation written by Francesca Flora, Evoluzione della informatica nel sistema di governo degli Stati Uniti d’America (Cagliari, dept. Of Politiacl Science, November 1996). For application at the federal level one had to wait until 1998: US Senate, S. 1594, Digital Signature and Electronic Authentication Law (SEAL) of 1998. — US House of Representatives, H.R. 3472, Digital Signature and Electronic Authentication Law (SEAL) of 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, and even before 1978, IT helped [[Public Administration]] but kept a “safe distance”, assuming that the ‘sacred nature’ of the Law demanded the use of pen and paper. Information Technology merely managed and filed copies of legal documents: it was known as “parallel IT”,&lt;ref&gt;4. Duni, G., Amministrazione digitale, Voce della Enciclopedia del diritto, Annali, I, Milano 2007, p. 13-49.&lt;/ref&gt; since it was an accessory to the activity with formal value, the one based on pen and paper.

Thus, the logical, legal and material premise of Teleadministration is the conferment of legal value to IT documents.

== Origins and terminology  ==
In Italy, the linguistic expression &lt;ref&gt;5. [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/teleamministrazione_(Lessico-del-XXI-Secolo) Teleamministrazione, Lessico del XXI secolo], Treccani&lt;/ref&gt; teleamministrazione was first used in 1991 at the Roman ‘La Sapienza’ university, during a conference organised by the Court of Cassation,&lt;ref&gt;6. Duni, G., Il progetto nazionale di teleamministrazione pubblica, in “L’informatica giuridica e il Ced della Corte di Cassazione”, proceedings of the conference held at the Univ. of Rome “La Sapienza”, 27-29 Nov. 1991, Milan 1992, p. 87 ss.&lt;/ref&gt; in which it was said that: «the new system of administrative information technology is called “teleadministration” because all the work of the [[Public Administration]] will be carried out through devices, that could also be computers, linked to the central server through a network.» Teleadministration was indeed considered a type of teleworking.&lt;ref&gt;7. Applicazioni della multimedialità nella P.A.: teleamministrazione e telelavoro”, in Funzione Pubblica, special issue “I convegni di FORUM P.A. ’96”, volume I, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Teleadministration, amministrative procedures become electronic administrative procedures and, more specifically, those that are initiated by a party realize the electronic One Stop Shop.

== The fundamentals of teleadministration ==
In the decades from 1970 to 1990, the [[Supreme Court of Cassation (Italy)|Court of Cassation]] was at the core of research on the relationship between IT and Law, organising international conferences every five years on the topic. The 1993 international conference featured the fundamentals of teleadministration, providing the details of the administrative systems behind the One Stop Shop concept:&lt;ref&gt;8. Duni, G., presentation at the 5th International Congress at the Court of Cassation on “IT and Legal Activity” Rome, 3–7 May 1993, I.P.Z.S. - Libreria dello Stato, 1994, II, p. 381 ss.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A citizen presents his/her claim to one administration, which then manages the entire procedure.
# A single “administrative file” is created, no matter how many different administrations may be involved.
# For both internal and external stages in an administrative procedure, a "warning signal" is sent telematically to the relevant office where the next stage is due, the employee in that office then becomes responsible for that phase of the procedure.
# Any information concerning records already held by public administration is accessed telematically, without involving the citizen. 
# The (electronic) signature identifies the identity of the operator through sophisticated techniques.
# The original of an administrative act is electronic and is therefore always available telematically to any administration that may need it. 
# The presence of an increasing amount of on-line data will necessitate greater use of automatic data processing in decision-making.
# Saving data on multiple memory locations will guarantee the safekeeping of the acts. 
# Statistical data will be available in real time and under multiple profiles, with great benefits for top level decision-making.
# Private citizens can obtain paper copies of the electronic acts.
It should be noted that the 5th fundamental mentions electronic rather than digital signatures.  This is because, in the jurists’ domain, digital signatures were not yet known. The generic reference to the electronic signature is however valid, and its general nature is actually suitable for the rules contained six years later in the Directive 1999/93/EC.
As we will see, the Directive refers in particular to all procedures initiated by private citizens, but the system remains valid for all procedures initiated by the administration offices as well.

The legally accepted form of acts and documents evolved according to the following stages:
# Acts only exist in paper form
# Acts in electronic format are a possible option
# Electronic format is compulsory, safe for a few exceptions
In Italy, Phase 2 was launched by Art 15, para, 2,  Law N. 59 of 15 March 1997, (the so-called ‘Bassanini 1’ law: it established the legal value of electronic documents, while regulations would establish the authentication criteria). The EC intervened later with its Directive 1999/93/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and the [[Council of the European Union|Council]] of 13 December 1999 (Transposed by Law Decree N.10 of 23 January 2002), which imposes an obligation on Member States to give legal value to documents with digital signatures (not directly named as such, but all their features are described in the directive). It also establishes that electronic documents should not be rejected a priori, hence opening to a range of different solutions to establish the authorship of a document (the so-called ‘weak signatures’).

The 1993 Directive was revoked and absorbed (for reasons of legal certainty and clarity) by Regulation 910/2014 of the European Parliament and Council of 23 July 2014 (also known as eIDAS regulation) in the OJEU 28 August 2014, which did not renege on the principle of also accepting the so-called ‘weak signatures’.
In Italy, The move to Phase 3 was established by Art.40 of Legislative sl. Decree N.82 of 7 March 2007, Code of Digital Administration (CAD), entitled “Creation of electronic documents”, which states: “Public Administrations make the original copy of their documents with electronic means, according to the provisions of the present Code and the technical specifications of Article 71”. Exceptions are extremely rare: Comma 3 states: by means of appropriate regulations…. , proposed by the delegated Ministers for Public Functions, Innovation and Technology and the Minister for Cultural Heritage and Activities, the categories of administrative documents that can be created on paper in original are identified, having regard to the special historical and archive value they will have by nature” (think, for example, of the resignation of a President of the Republic).

Unfortunately, national administrations are ignoring this provision, and today it is only private companies that are no longer allowed paper-based communication with public administrations (Art. N. 5 bis of the CAD and D.P.C.M. 22 July 2011); compulsory electronic invoicing was added on 31 March 2015 by Law N. 44 of 24 December 2007, Art. N. 1, para 209-214 implemented by Ministerial  Decree N.55 of 3 April 2013, further clarified by Ministerial circular N.1 of 9 March 2015.
The modernisation of procedures was also touched by Presidential Decree N. 447 of 20 October 1998 (creation of the One Stop Shop, but only for production activities, and paper based), while interest for a telematic procedure only began with Legislative Decree N. 82 of 7 March 2005, CAD, which is not as relevant in its first version but was later modified by several interventions, particularly Legislative Decree N. 335 of 10 December 2013.

European sources are also essential. The EC, and later the European Union, have undertaken a wide range of actions on e-government: one of the most important was the launch of the IDABC programme (and financing) for Interoperable Delivery of European eGovernment Services to public Administrations, Business and Citizens, via Decision 2004/387/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 21 April 2004. However, the ultimate acknowledgement of the principles of teleadministration, with the telematic One Stop Shop, is contained in the Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 12 December 2006, on the Internal market for services, which provides for Member States to set up an electronic One Stop Shop in the wide field of administrative procedures.

== Teleadministration and the ‘star’ procedure ==
This article is not meant to argue the great effect that teleadministration has on the efficiency of administrative activity, as we assume that the reader is fully aware that, once paper based documents are abandoned, the real-time flow of documents greatly improves time management and responsibility of the single offices/ operators, while direct online access improves transparency. Rather, this paragraph wants to emphasize how teleadministration promotes maximum usage of the “star procedure”, known and researched in Germany as “Sternverfahren”. This procedure, an alternative to the sequential procedure, which has by nature longer head times, in the paper-based world would require making several copies of the administrative file (which can be extremely voluminous) for each office and each administration that needs to express an opinion or issue an authorisation. With the One Stop Shop, the administration initiating the process is charged with this task. Electronic files clearly provide evident benefits for these procedures, since all involved administrations can directly and simultaneously access the file, view the part they need to evaluate and add their opinion or authorisation directly, using a star-shaped scheme.

== Assessing the actual acceptance of teleadministration in current law and real life ==
As a scientific proposition, teleadministration sketched the system of telematic administrative procedures well ahead of the law, and particularly the electronic One Stop Shop concept. Both concepts are based on the dematerialisation of documents and on telematic administrative work.

The concept of documents’ dematerialisation,&lt;ref&gt;9. According to some commentators “dematerialization” is not the appropriate term for documents that are created in electronic form, but rather for those that are created in paper form and are later converted in digital format. Though conceptually correct, this observation ignores the fact that the expression now is generally understood to mean any “form that does without the material presence of paper, from the creation of the document”&lt;/ref&gt; in existence since 1978 as a scientific notion,&lt;ref&gt;10. See note. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; was first embraced in Italy (Law N. 59 of 15 March 1997, Art. 15, para 2) and later by the E.C. in Directive 1999/93/EC.

Once the principle that an electronic document can have legal value was accepted, it was possible to deal with its management within a telematic procedure.
As mentioned, configuring this procedure within the rules of teleadministration is today accepted in both European and Italian laws. European laws also provide quite a detailed description of the electronic One Stop Shop, with rules that fit nicely within the scientific rules of teleadministration; their main limitation is that they were specifically designed for the free circulation of services within Europe, and hence for the procedures these require. It is the above-mentioned 1996/123/EC Directive, whose Art.6 establishes the One Stop Shop and Art. 8 provides that it should be managed “remotely and electronically”, leaving further details to the Commission. And indeed the Commission, with its Decision of 16 October 2009, provided a number of measures to facilitate the use of electronic procedures through the “One Stop Shop” under Directive 2006/123/EC. These sources are clear and they apply to a wide-ranging sector: the problem is that any sector or procedure that is not related to the supply of services within the Union is not regulated, and Member States are therefore able to carry on with old-fashioned paper-based procedures.

In light of this limitation, a group of illustrious European Law academics, coordinated by Giovanni Duni, has drafted the most effective text for a Directive providing a universal system of telematic administrative procedure.&lt;ref&gt;11. The outcome of this collective research effort is the text for a draft Directive, that can be found on the CNR ITTIG journal  Informatica e diritto, Vol. XXI, 2012, N. 2, pp. 113-129: The telematic procedures in the European Union. Introducing a draft Directive, as well as  on line, with an Italian and an English language version of the draft on the site [http://www.teleamministrazione.it www.teleamministrazione.it]&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian sources are based on the Code of Digital Administration, the above-mentioned Law Decree N.82 of 7 March 2005 in its current version, following several modifications, which (if correctly interpreted and implemented) should make it compulsory for all public administrations to use teleadministration, thus making the telematic administrative procedure the default procedural method. Art. 14, the key provision, establishes that the proceeding administration creates an electronic file, to which all involved administrations can and should have access, and feed it with the acts of their competence. Private citizens can also access it under Law 241/90
Thus the electronic file is the technical and organizational specification of the telematic administrative procedure, as it is clear that its creation is an operative stage of the procedure and not simply a new filing system for the archives.

Art. 10 of the CAD appears at first to be at odds with this interpretation, since it establishes that the One Stop Shop for productive activities provides its services electronically but leaves doubts about the possibility that the back office activities could be still paper-based. However, if Art. 10 and Art. 41 are interpreted together, the only possible conclusion is that the former is a clarification of front office activities, but all the administrative activity is based on the general rule of electronic files, and therefore on the teleadministration and the One Stop Shop. 
Compared to European and Italian law, reality is somewhat behind. Eight years after Directive 1996/123/CE, there would be grounds for an infraction procedure against Italy. But since Italy enjoys the company of several other non-compliant Member States, they are all ‘safe’ for the time being.

Though the letter of the CAD may be not be respected, it seems very unlikely that this may determine the invalidity or nullity of the acts for violation of Art. 41(electronic file) or Art. 40 (statutory requirement of digital signature), because in front of a claim of this nature, the administrative judge would apply Artt. 21 septies and 21 octies of Law 241/90. The claimant should demonstrate that the use of the electronic format and electronic file would have led to a different outcome.

'''Telman Mardanovich Ismailov''' ({{lang-az|Telman Mərdan oğlu İsmayılov}}, {{lang-ru| Те́льман Марда́нович Исмаи́лов}}; born 26 October 1956) is an [[Azerbaijan]]i-born [[businessman]] and [[entrepreneur]] of [[History of the Jews in Azerbaijan|Mountain Jew]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gzt.ru/people/teljman-ismailov/243349.html На взятие Исмаилова] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Azerbaijan does not allow [[Azerbaijani nationality law|dual citizenship]], he holds [[Russia]]n-[[Turkey|Turkish]] citizenship. He is the [[chairman]] of the Russian AST Group of companies, which is active in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gorskie.ru/personalii/person36.htm РЕЗИДЕНТ ГРУППЫ АСТ ТЕЛЬМАН ИСМАИЛОВ: У НАС РУБЛЬ СЪЕШЬ - ТРИ ОТДАШЬ] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2009, Ismailov owned the Europe's then-largest marketplace, [[Cherkizovsky Market]], located in Moscow, Russia.

==Early life and family==
Telman Ismailov was born in [[Baku]], [[USSR]] in 1956, to a business family from Baku. He is the 10th child of a family with 12 children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peoples.ru/undertake/founder/telman_ismailov/ Тельман Марданович Исмаилов - Peoples.ru] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both his father's and mother's family include Muslims and [[Mountain Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www9.gazetevatan.com/haberdetay.asp?Categoryid=1&amp;Newsid=244668]{{tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
===Current assets===
In 1989, he registered the brand "AST" (initials of his two sons (Alekper, Sarkhan) and himself).&lt;ref name="Telman"&gt;[http://pragent.ru/prostopr/ismailov/ PR-кампания Тельмана Исмаилова] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the lavish opening of a hotel resort in [[Antalya]], Russia's prime minister [[Vladimir Putin]] was reportedly enraged that Ismailov invested so much abroad and flaunted his riches while Russia was being hit by a credit crunch.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/oligarch-pays-for-party-that-enraged-putin-1748289.html&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation, the angry Putin ordered the closing of Cherkizovsky Market in 2009, causing 100,000 traders at the famous bazaar to lose their jobs.

==Lifestyle==
Known for his extravagant life style, Ismailov is famous for spending millions of dollars on [[singers]] like [[Jennifer Lopez]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]], and others. Ismailov paid [[Lopez]] $1.4 million for her to sing 10 minutes worth of songs.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The video of her singing "[[Happy Birthday to You|Happy Birthday]]" song to him is available on YouTube. Ismailov befriended plenty of other celebrities such as [[actors|actresses]] like [[Sharon Stone]], [[Richard Gere]], [[Monica Bellucci]], [[Paris Hilton]], and numerous other performers just to appear at his lavish parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-life/fashion/2009/06/03/glitz-and-glamour-for-all-in-turkey-100252-23776517/ Glitz and glamour for all in Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Death of Contract''''' is a book by American law professor [[Grant Gilmore]], written in 1974, about the [[history]] and development of the [[common law]] of [[contract]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmore, Grant.  ''The Death of Contract''.  The Ohio State University Press, 1974, 2nd edition 1995.  {{ISBN|0-8142-0676-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohiostatepress.org/index.htm?/books/book%20pages/gilmore%20death.htm Comments on The Death of Contract, from Ohio State University Press]&lt;/ref&gt;  Gilmore's central [[thesis]] was that the Law of Contracts, at least as it existed in the 20th-century United States was largely artificial:  it was the work of a handful of [[scholars]] and [[judge]]s building a system, rather than a more organic, historically rooted development based on the [[evolution]] of [[case law]].  This book is required supplemental reading in the first year program at many [[Law school in the United States|U.S. law schools]]. A second edition was published in 1995, which was edited with a new introduction by [[Ronald K.L. Collins]].

== Chapter 1.  Origin ==
Gilmore begins the introduction forcefully, stating "We are told that Contract, like God, is dead.  And so it is." Gilmore then brings us through the [[life]] of Contract, from [[birth]] to [[death]].  He notes that courts had been deciding contract law for centuries before the [[theory]] of contracts was introduced by [[Christopher Columbus Langdell]]. This assertion, that Langdell "invented" the general theory of contracts is somewhat contested by contracts scholars, with Richard Austen-Baker, for example, pointing out the lack of any evidence of any theory of contract authored by Langdell, to prior work by English jurists such as Addison and Leake and to far more developed work by English scholars such as Sir [[Sir William Anson, 3rd Baronet|William Anson]] and Sir [[Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet|Frederick Pollock]], contemporary with Langdell.&lt;ref&gt;R. Austen-Baker "Gilmore and the Strange Case of the Failure of Contract to Die After All" (2002) 18 ''Journal of Contract Law'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilmore retains the central idea that the general law of contract is a residual category, that is, what is left after all the specialized bodies of law have been added up. The world of [[commercial law]], and within it contract law, was largely the product of the [[Industrial Revolution]].  It was created quite rapidly, outlined in little more than a half-century. Initially, for legal greats like [[Joseph Story|Justice Story]], there was no separate theory of contracts.  Rather, there were specialized bodies of law that had been developed to address the various needs of the Industrial Revolution. Gilmore alleges, that rather than contract coming first, and the various specialties being developed afterwards, it actually was the opposite, where contract enveloped pre-existing specialties, like [[negotiable instruments]] and [[sales]].

Gilmore credits Langdell with the “almost inadvertent discovery” of contract law, as it was the subject of his very first [[casebook]].  The goal of Langdell’s casebook was to reduce the world of contracts to major underlying principles in a scientific fashion. The theory of contracts created by Langdell is furthered by [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] and [[Samuel Williston]], which Gilmore calls the Holmes-Williston construct.  The theory is described whereby, “no one should be liable to anyone for anything.”, or at least liability shall be strictly limited.  Damages in contract were distinguished from damages in [[tort]], and [[punitive damages]] were not to be allowed.  Furthermore, courts were to act as “detached umpires or referees” and only to see that the rules of the game were followed, but not to “see that justice or anything of that sort was done.”  Gilmore further describes Holmes’ view on objective interpretation of contract law, as laid out in ''[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]]''. Thus, Gilmore states that the theory of contracts was not developed naturally from continual [[case law]] development, such as the decisions by [[Lord Mansfield]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Hawkes v Saunders]]'' (1782) 98 ER 1091 and ''[[Pillans v Van Mierop]]'' (1765) 97 ER 1035. He notes that ''[[Eastwood v Kenyon]]'' (1840) 114 ER 482 is typically seen as the final rejection of Lord Mansfield's ideas.&lt;/ref&gt; but rather it was an “[[ivory tower]] abstraction” that lived “in the [[law school]]s, not the law courts.” Often the rules of contract were the result of a string of cases being pulled together, with little citation or presentation of the facts, and declared to be a rule in the works of Williston. The problem with contract theory was that “businessman, adapting to changing circumstance, kept doing things differently.  The general theory required that, always and everywhere, things remain as they have, in theory, always been.” He illustrates this argument by reference to English case law that had been elevated by the theorists to the status of "rules", in ''[[Stilk v Myrick]]'', ''[[Dickinson v Dodds]]'' and ''[[Foakes v Beer]]'', all as a way of ensuring that the [[doctrine of consideration]] would preclude the enforceability of a contract.

== Chapter 2.  Development ==
Developing on the discussion of the first chapter, Gilmore begins by focusing on the change from a [[Subjectivity|subjective]] approach to an [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] approach in the theory of contracts. Contract law in the 19th century was experiencing a shift from a formalistic regime toward a more flexible paradigm that tended to uphold the validity of contracts. This was due in part to the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the need to facilitate commerce between parties. The requirement of ceremonial trappings such as seals and ribbons gave way to a more reality based emphasis on consideration as indicia of the parties' intent to contract.

Gilmore begins with an analysis of ''[[Raffles v Wichelhaus]]'', otherwise famously known as ''The Peerless''. He continues, noting examples of case objectification by Holmes in his book ''[[The Common Law (Holmes)|The Common Law]]'', and that if the “[[Magic (illusion)|magician]]” can objectify that case, he could do so to anything.  According to Holmes, ''Raffles'', is not decided on a failure of the [[meeting of the minds]], but rather they objectively said two different things.  This action was consistent with Holmes’ desire to remove morality from the understanding of law. The importance in objectifying contract law is that it is far easier to litigate. For Holmes, no longer could one void a contract simply because they had made a mistake, the mistake would have to be objectively reasonable. Gilmore finishes the chapter by discussing the reception of the policy of absolute contractual liability in ''[[Paradine v Jane]]'' into the law of Massachusetts, and the Holmesian theorists disdain for the condoning of special damages in ''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]''.

== Chapter 3.  Decline and Fall ==
Gilmore’s first point is that contract law was never as neat and tidy as the casebooks tried to make it appear.  Cases were selected and reported in the texts as long as they fit the categories already created. The theory of contract as formulated by Holmes and Williston, was disassembled by [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]] and [[Arthur Linton Corbin]].  Cardozo did this through his judicial opinions, which gave power to the courts to create contracts wherever possible, adding contract terms if necessary, while Corbin did so in his treatise on Contracts (which Gilmore describes as the greatest law book ever written).  Corbin’s work takes the opposite stance of Holmes, refuting the idea that contract law was external, rather focusing on the “operative facts” of the cases.

Corbin worked with Williston on the [[Restatements of the Law|Restatement of Contracts]].  As Gilmore states, “Williston and Corbin held antithetical points of view on almost every conceivable point of law.”  As such, Gilmore points out the contradictions with the Restatement itself, citing sec. 75 and sec. 90.  While sec. 75 takes a purely Holmesian objective point of view, sec. 90 appears to go in the exact opposite direction, allowing for reasonable expectations.  Gilmore points to the contradiction of sections as example of the “unspoken cases” as mentioned earlier that didn’t fit the Holmesian model, being presented by Corbin in an un-ignorable fashion.  Ultimately, the differing view points resulted in the Restatement coming out “fudged or blurred, pointing equivocally in all directions at once.  The Restatement, we might say, ended up uneasily between past and future, which is no doubt the best thing that could have been done.”

However, Gilmore points out that the future wins out, and the [[Restatement (Second) of Contracts|Second Restatement]] moves towards the direction of sec. 90, “the unwanted stepchild” of the first Restatement.  The move is exemplified by the newfound success of plaintiffs looking to recover for the benefit that they conferred on the defendant, even though they ultimately failed to complete their contractual obligations.

Gilmore suggests that the theory of contract law just complicates the obvious.  As he states, “In any civilized system the same agreements, provided that they are entered into voluntarily and in good faith, will be enforced - as of course they should be.  We did [the same thing] by discovering or inventing, in appropriate cases, ‘exceptions’ from the ‘general rule’ - which makes the resulting pattern look a good deal more complicated than it really is, with the result that people - including lawyers and judges - are sometimes led astray.”  Historically, there are examples of “exceptions” carved out even under absolute liability assumptions, thus almost always providing for what would be perceived as a just result.  Similarly, the remedies for breach of contract have broadened beyond what was originally allowed.

== Chapter 4.  Conclusions and Speculations ==
Gilmore begins the final chapter by stating that perhaps, “we might say that what is happening is that ‘contract’ is being reabsorbed into the mainstream of ‘tort’”. The artificial divisions that were used to carve contract theory out of tort a hundred years ago have all but crumbled.  With all of the exceptions in contract law, liability in contract is no longer very different from liability in tort, and the merging of damages is not far behind. Quite comically, Gilmore suggests that the merging of contracts and torts should be reflected in legal education in a class called “[[Contorts]]”. Gilmore pays heed to the justifications for creating a theory of contract in the first place.  Around the start of the 20th century, the legal climate was one that feared legal individualism among the [[U.S. state|states]], and therefore, a general theory of contract law was appealing as it could transcend state lines.  At the same time, taking commercial issues and deciding them under contract law and the guise of “questions of law” kept them from being decided by inconsistent and unreliable juries. In closing, Gilmore notes the constantly changing tides of legal thought, and states that “Contract is dead - but who knows what unlikely resurrection the Easter-tide may bring?”
