In [[knot theory]], the '''6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; knot''' is one of three [[prime knot]]s with [[crossing number (knot theory)|crossing number]] six, the others being the [[Stevedore knot (mathematics)|stevedore knot]] and the [[6₂ knot|6&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; knot]]. It is [[alternating knot|alternating]], [[hyperbolic knot|hyperbolic]], and [[amphichiral knot|fully amphichiral]].
It can be written as the braid word
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_1^{-1}\sigma_2^2\sigma_1^{-2}\sigma_2. \, &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=6_3+knot&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symmetry==
Like the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]], the 6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; knot is [[amphichiral knot|fully amphichiral]]. This means that the 6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; knot is [[amphichiral knot|amphichiral]],&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Amphichiral Knot|id=AmphichiralKnot}} Accessed: May 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that it is indistinguishable from its own mirror image. In addition, it is also [[invertible knot|invertible]], meaning that orienting the curve in either direction yields the same oriented knot.

==Invariants==
The [[Alexander polynomial]] of the 6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; knot is
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(t) = t^2 - 3t + 5 - 3t^{-1} + t^{-2}, \, &lt;/math&gt;

[[Alexander polynomial#Alexander.E2.80.93Conway polynomial|Conway polynomial]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla(z) = z^4 + z^2 + 1, \, &lt;/math&gt;

[[Jones polynomial]] is
:&lt;math&gt;V(q) = -q^3 + 2q^2 - 2q + 3 - 2q^{-1} + 2q^{-2} - q^{-3}, \, &lt;/math&gt;

and the [[Kauffman polynomial]] is
:&lt;math&gt;L(a,z) = az^5 + z^5a^{-1} + 2a^2z^4 + 2z^4a^{-2} + 4z^4 + a^3z^3 + az^3 + z^3a^{-1} + z^3a^{-3} - 3a^2z^2 - 3z^2a^{-2} - 6z^2 - a^3z - 2az - 2za^{-1} - za^{}-3 + a^2 + a^{-2} +3. \, &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Knot Atlas|6_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; knot is a [[hyperbolic knot]], with its complement having a [[Hyperbolic volume (knot)|volume]] of approximately 5.69302.

'''Adalbero III of Luxembourg''' ({{circa|1010}}{{spaced ndash}}13 November 1072) was a German nobleman.  He was a titular [[Count]] of [[Luxembourg]] and [[Bishop]] of [[Bishopric of Metz|Metz]].

Adalbero was the third son of Count [[Frederick of Luxembourg]] and a brother of Count [[Giselbert of Luxembourg|Giselbert]].  In 1047, he succeeded his uncle [[Dietrich II of Luxembourg|Dietrich II]] (d. 30 April 1047) as Bishop of [[Bishopric of Metz|Metz]].  He distinguished himself by his piety, his education, the prudent manner in which he administered his bishopric and his political influence.

He was a teacher of [[Bruno of Eguisheim-Dagsburg]], who became Bishop of [[Bishopric of Toul|Toul]] in 1026.  In 1049, Adalbero III was present at the meeting in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], organized by Emperor [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]], where Bruno was elected as the imperial candidate to become Pope.  Later the people of Rome elected Bruno by [[acclamation]], and he became Pope as [[Pope Leo IX|Leo IX]].

Adalbero III was also present at the [[Synod|council]] in Rome in 1050 where Bishop [[Gerard of Toul]] was canonized.

Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] enfeoffed Adalbero with the [[County of Saarbrücken]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4223">The '''agent systems reference model''' (ASRM) is a layered, abstract description for [[multiagent systems]].  As such, the [[reference model]]
* provides a taxonomy of terms, concepts and definitions to compare agent systems;
* identifies functional elements that are common in agent systems;
* captures data flow and dependencies among the functional elements in agent systems; and
* specifies assumptions and requirements regarding the dependencies among these elements.

The ASRM differentiates itself from [[technical standard]]s, such as [[Knowledge Interchange Format]], [[Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language]], and those of the [[FIPA|Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents]] in that it defines the required ''existence'' of components of a multiagent system; standards prescribe how they are ''designed''.

==Technical approach==

The ASRM was technically constructed through [[Reverse engineering|forensic software analysis]] of existing agent-based systems.  Such fielded systems include [[Java Agent DEvelopment framework|JaDE]], [[Cougaar]], [[Extendable mobile agent architecture|EMAA]], [[NOMADS]], [[Retsina (agent framework)|Retsina]], [[A-Globe]], among others.  In so doing, through empirical evidence, the ASRM motivates its functional breakdown of agent-based systems.

An alloprotein is a novel [[synthetic biology|synthetic]] [[protein]] containing one or more "non-natural" [[amino acid]]s. Non-natural in the context means an amino acid either '''not occurring in nature''' (novel and synthesised amino acids),&lt;ref name="Yokohama"&gt;[http://www.riken.jp/engn/r-world/research/lab/ssbc/expand/index.html Expanded Genetic Code System Research Team], [[Yokohama Institute]], [[Japan]]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''occurring in nature but not naturally occurring within proteins''' (natural but [[proteinogenic|non-proteinogenic]] amino acids).&lt;ref name="patent 4879223"&gt;[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=7&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=4879223&amp;OS=4879223&amp;RS=4879223 Method for producing protein containing nonprotein amino acids] - 1988, Miyazawa &amp; Yokoyama et al. Description states: ''The present invention relates to a method for producing proteins comprising nonprotein amino acids (hereinafter referred to as non-natural proteins) using protein-producing organisms. The term "nonprotein amino acids" as used herein implicates all amino acids excluding the aforementioned 20 natural amino acids. Thus, all amino acids but the aforementioned 20 amino acids are referred to as nonprotein amino acids '''even if they are naturally present'''.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The possibility for novel amino acids and proteins arises because in nature, the [[genetic code]] responsible for protein structure has 64 possible [[codon]]s available for encoding all amino acids used in proteins (4 [[nucleotide]]s in each of 3  [[Nucleobase|bases]]; 4 x 4 x 4 gives 64 possible combinations&lt;ref name="isbn0-465-09138-5"&gt;{{cite book | author = Crick, Francis | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = What mad pursuit: a personal view of scientific discovery | edition = | language = | publisher = Basic Books | location = New York | year = 1988 | origyear = | pages = 89–101 | quote = | isbn = 0-465-09138-5 | chapter = Chapter 8: The genetic code }}&lt;/ref&gt;) but in [[human being]]s and other [[eukaryote]]s these encode for just 20 standard amino acids.&lt;ref name="hahn"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/anie.200301720 | volume=43 | title=Old Codons, New Amino Acids | year=2004 | journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition | pages=1190–1193 | last1 = Hahn | first1 = Ulrich}}&lt;/ref&gt; This level of [[Redundancy (information theory)|information redundancy]] within the [[DNA codon table|codon table]] is known in [[biochemistry]] as [[Codon#Degeneracy|degeneracy]]. It opens the door for new amino acids to be potentially encoded.&lt;ref name="hahn" /&gt;

One approach takes advantage of the redundancy of the 3 codons that encode a "stop" signal. If one of these can be substituted by another stop codon, then that codon can in principle be "reassigned" (along with requisite [[tRNA]], [[release factor]] and [[enzyme]] modifications) to code for a novel amino acid without affecting other existing codings.&lt;ref name="codon-reassignment"&gt;[http://protein.gsc.riken.jp/sakamoto/codonreassignment_en.html First Genetic Code of an Organism Revised in a Research Laboratory] - RIKEN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reassignment"&gt;[http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/38/22/8188.full Codon reassignment in the Escherichia coli genetic code] - 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Using this approach, alloproteins and novel amino acids can be created by techniques that [[Expanded genetic code|"expand" the genetic code]] to include additional novel codings, using newly devised [[codon]]s and related tRNA ([[transfer RNA]]) and tRNA [[synthetase]] [[enzyme]]s ([[aminoacyl tRNA synthetase]]). The usual mechanisms, which produce amino acids and combine them into proteins, then produce novel or non-proteinogenic amino acids and incorporate them to make novel proteins the same way. In 2010 this technique was used to reassign a codon in the genetic code of the [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', modifying it to produce and incorporate a novel amino acid, without adversely affecting existing encodings or the organism itself.&lt;ref name="codon-reassignment" /&gt;&lt;ref name="reassignment" /&gt;

Alloprotein uses include the incorporation of unusual or heavy [[atom]]s for [[X-ray diffraction|diffractive structure analysis]], photo-reactive linkers ([[photocrosslinker]]s), [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] groups (used as labelled probes), and [[molecular switch]]es for signaling pathways.&lt;ref name="Yokohama" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protein.gsc.riken.jp/Concept/submain5.html Riken Systems and Structural Biology Center: protein synthesis and functional studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition and history ==
Modern alloprotein techniques were first developed in the late 1980s by Miyazawa and Yokoyama at the [[University of Tokyo]] to address limitations of existing methods: genetic manipulation was limited to the 20 standard amino acids, chemical synthesis was limited to small scale and low yield.&lt;ref name="patent 4879223" /&gt;

An early use of the term is found in a 1990 paper "Biosynthesis of alloprotein", by Koide, Yokoyama and Miyazawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 2406480 | volume=48 | title=[Biosynthesis of alloprotein] | journal=Nihon Rinsho | pages=208–13 | last1 = Koide | first1 = H | last2 = Yokoyama | first2 = S | last3 = Miyazawa | first3 = T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A working description is provided by ''Budisa et al'':&lt;ref&gt;[http://gfpp.free.fr/conferences/abstract_BUDISA.pdf A holistic approach to genetic code engineering] - Wiltschi, Merkel and Budisa, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Genetic code engineering is [a] new research field that intent to reprogram protein synthesis by reassignment of specific codons to non-canonical (mainly synthetic) amino acids. The resulting proteins are alloproteins with tailor-made properties that are of outstanding interest for both, academia and industrial biotechnology."

'''Ambidexterity''' is the state of being equally adapted in the use of both the left and the right [[hand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/ambidextrous?q=Ambidexterity#ambidextrous__5/|title=ambidextrous - Definition of ambidextrous in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightleftrightwrong.com/what.html|title=Right, Left, Right, Wrong! - What is Handedness?|website=www.rightleftrightwrong.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to objects, the concept indicates that the object is equally suitable for right-handed and left-handed people. When referring to humans, it indicates that a person has no marked preference for the use of the right or left hand. 

Only about one percent of people are naturally ambidextrous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100125094511.htm|title=Mixed-handed children more likely to have mental health, language and scholastic problems, study finds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more modern times, it is common to find some people considered ambidextrous who were originally [[Handedness|left-handed]] and who learned to be ambidextrous, either deliberately or as a result of training in [[school]]s or in jobs where right-handed habits are often emphasized or required. Since many everyday devices (such as [[can opener]]s and [[scissors]]) are asymmetrical and designed for right-handed people, many left-handers learn to use them right-handedly due to the rarity or lack of left-handed models. Thus, left-handed people are more likely to develop motor skills in their non-dominant hand than right-handed people (who are not subjected to left-favoring devices). Right-handers may become ambidextrous due to an injury of their right hand or arm. Ambidexterity is often encouraged in activities requiring a great deal of skill in both hands, such as [[typing]], [[juggling]], [[musician]]ship, [[surgery]], [[sports]] and [[martial arts]].

== Etymology ==
The word "ambidextrous" is derived from the [[Latin]] roots ''[[wiktionary:ambi-|ambi-]]'', meaning "both", and ''[[wiktionary:dexter|dexter]]'', meaning "right" or "favorable". Thus, "ambidextrous" is literally "both right" or "both favorable". The term '''[[:wikt:ambidexter|ambidexter]]''' in [[English language|English]] was originally used in a [[law|legal]] sense of [[jury|jurors]] who accepted bribes from both parties for their verdict.&lt;ref&gt;1811 MMADEHof the Vulgar Tongue, page 12, {{ISBN|0-695-80216-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In sports ==

=== Baseball ===
Ambidexterity is highly prized in the sport of [[baseball]]. "[[Switch hitter|Switch hitting]]" is the most common phenomenon, and is highly prized because a batter usually has a higher statistical chance of successfully hitting the baseball when it is thrown by an opposite-handed pitcher. Therefore, an ambidextrous hitter can bat from whichever side is more advantageous to him in that situation. [[Pete Rose]], who had more hits than anyone else in the history of [[Major League Baseball]], was a switch hitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2003130073_moments16.html Seattletimes.com] paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Switch pitcher]]s, comparatively rare in contrast to switch hitters, also exist. [[Tony Mullane]] won 284 games in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;50 Biggest Baseball Myths by Brandon Toropov, page 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2003130073_moments16.html Seattletimes.com] paragraph 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elton Chamberlain]] and [[Larry Corcoran]] were also notable ambidextrous pitchers. In the 20th century, [[Greg A. Harris]] was the only major league pitcher to pitch with both his left and his right arm. A natural right-hander, by 1986 he could throw well enough with his left hand that he felt capable of pitching with either hand in a game. Harris wasn't allowed to throw left-handed in a regular-season game until September 28, 1995, the penultimate game of his career. Against the [[Cincinnati Reds]] in the ninth inning, Harris (then a member of the [[Montreal Expos]]) retired [[Reggie Sanders]] pitching right-handed, then switched to his left hand for the next two hitters, [[Hal Morris]] and [[Ed Taubensee]], who both batted left-handed. Harris walked Morris but got Taubensee to ground out. He then went back to his right hand to retire [[Bret Boone]] to end the inning.

In the 21st century there is one major league pitcher, [[Pat Venditte]] of the [[Seattle Mariners]], who regularly pitches with both arms. Venditte became the 21st century's first switch pitcher in MLB with his debut on June 5, 2015 against the [[Boston Red Sox]], pitching two innings, allowing only one hit and recording five outs right-handed and one out left-handed. Because the art of switch-pitching is such an unusual skill, rule changes restricting the ability of a pitcher to change arms were imposed during Venditte's professional career.

[[Billy Wagner]] was a natural right-handed pitcher in his youth, but after breaking his throwing arm twice, he taught himself how to use his left arm by throwing nothing but fastballs against a barn wall. He became a dominant left-handed relief pitcher, most known for his 100+ mph (161+ km/h) fastball. In his 1999 season, Wagner captured the [[National League]] [[Rolaids Relief Man of the Year|Relief Man of the Year Award]] as a [[Houston Astros|Houston Astro]].

[[St. Louis Cardinals]] pitcher [[Brett Cecil]] is naturally right-handed, but starting from a very early age, threw with his left. As such, he writes and performs most tasks with the right side of his body, but throws with his left.

All baseball players have to be ambidextrous fielders, as the glove hand is most often on the off-hand.

=== Basketball ===
In [[basketball]] a player may choose to make a pass or shot with the weaker hand. NBA stars [[Kobe Bryant]], [[Kyrie Irving]], [[Carlos Boozer]], [[David Lee (basketball)|David Lee]], [[John Wall (basketball)|John Wall]], [[Derrick Rose]], [[Chandler Parsons]], [[Andrew Bogut]],  [[John Henson (basketball)|John Henson]] and [[Michael Beasley]], and [[Jerryd Bayless]] are ambidextrous players. Bogut and Henson are both stronger in the post with their left-handed hook shot than they are with their natural right hands. Brothers [[Marc Gasol|Marc]] and [[Pau Gasol]] can make hook shots with either hand while the right hand is dominant for each. [[Bob Cousy]], a Boston Celtics legend was forced to play with left hand in high school when he injured his right hand, thus making him effectively ambidextrous. [[Mike Conley Jr.|Mike Conley]] shoots left-handed, but has preferred to shoot floaters right handed, as he does everything else right-handed off the court, [[Ben Simmons]] and [[Luke Kennard (basketball)|Luke Kennard]] are also natural right-handers shooting left-handed. [[Tristan Thompson]] is a natural left-hander, and was a left-handed shooter, but has shot right-handed since the 2013-2014 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Tristan Thompson will switch shooting hands next season|url = https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2013/8/11/4611888/tristan-thompson-shooting-hands-switch|accessdate = 2015-06-02|first = Drew|last = Garrison}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does perform left-handed hook shots more often. [[LA Clippers]] center [[DeAndre Jordan]] who is left-handed, shoots with his left hand but has been known to dunk with his right hand, spin clockwise in his 360 dunks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TricksHD|title=NBA 2017 Dunk Contest ALL DUNKS HD|date=2017-02-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTTRVOLk0E|accessdate=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shoot right handed hook shots more accurately and from further out. Los Angeles Lakers center [[Roy Hibbert]] shoots his hook shots equally well with either hand. [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] left-handed point guard [[Derek Fisher]] used to dunk with his right hand in his early years. [[Candace Parker]], forward for the WNBA Sparks team, also has equal dominance with either hand. [[Los Angeles Lakers]] superstar [[Kobe Bryant]] shoots with either hand, although his right hand is dominant: due to an injury to the right hand, he was forced to shoot with his left. [[Paul George]], [[Tracy McGrady]] and [[Vince Carter]] are all noted to be right-handed, but rotates clockwise for dunks, but Carter is able to also spin anticlockwise, as he did during high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216160427/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR-FwCgDvGk|title=YouTube|date=16 December 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGrady also spins anti-clockwise for his baseline dunks. [[Larry Bird]], [[LeBron James]], [[Paul Millsap]], [[Russell Westbrook]], [[Danny Ainge]] and [[Gary Payton]] shoot right-handed, but do almost everything left-handed off the courts, but Bird once had a game in which he only shot left-handed running hook shots, cross passes and layups. [[Ronnie Price]], however has a tendency to dunk with his left hand, but he is a right-handed shooter. [[Josh McRoberts]] is known to be a left handed shooter but does everything with his right hand such as his famous dunks. Ivica Zubac is a right handed shooter, but can shoot hook shots with both hands, and is more accurate with his left handed hooks.

[[Trevor Booker]] is left handed for shooting a basketball but writes with his right hand. [[Ben Simmons]] shoots jumpers and free throws left-handed, but does everything else right-handed, including dunking, throwing long passes and writing. He also shoots more right-handed non-jumpers (layups, floaters and hook shots).

In [[skateboarding]], being able to skate successfully with not only one's dominant foot forward but also the less dominant one is called "switch skating" and is a prized ability. Notable switch skateboarders include [[Rodney Mullen]], [[Eric Koston]], [[Guy Mariano]], [[Paul Rodriguez Jr.]], [[Mike Mo Capaldi]], and [[Bob Burnquist]]. Similarly, [[surfing|surfers]] who ride equally well in either stance are said to be surfing "switch”. Also, [[snowboarding]] at the advanced level requires the ability to ride equally well in either.

=== Combat sports ===
In [[Martial arts|combat sports]] fighters may choose to face their opponent with either the left shoulder forward in a right-handed stance ("orthodox") or the right shoulder forward in a left-handed stance ("south-paw"), thus a degree of cross dominance is useful. In [[boxing]], [[Manny Pacquiao]] has a southpaw stance in the ring even though he is really ambidextrous outside the ring. Also, in mixed martial arts, many naturally left-handed strikers like [[Lyoto Machida]] and [[Anderson Silva]] will switch stances in order to counter opponent's strikes or takedown attempts to stay standing.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Cricket ===
In [[cricket]], it is also beneficial to be able to use both arms. Ambidextrous fielders can make one handed catches or throws with either hand. [[Sachin Tendulkar]] uses his left hand for writing, but bats and bowls with right hand. There are many players who are naturally right handed but bat left and vice versa. [[Sourav Ganguly]] uses his right hand for writing and bowls with the right hand, too, but bats with his left hand. Players due to injuries may also switch arms for fielding. [[Phillip Hughes]] batted, bowled and fielded left handed before a shoulder injury. Australian batsman [[George Bailey (cricketer, born 1982)|George Bailey]] also due to sustaining an injury, taught himself to throw with his weaker left arm. He is now often seen throughout matches switching between arms as he throws the ball. See also [[Reverse sweep#Reverse sweep|reverse sweep]] and [[Batting (cricket)#Switch hit|switch hitting]]. [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]] has batted right handed in high school, and has practiced right handed as well, when he is normally a left-handed switch-hitter. Alastair Cook, James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Ben Stokes, Adam Gilchrist and Kagiso Rabada are natural right-handers, but bat left handed.

[[Akshay Karnewar]] is an ambidextrous bowler. Originally, he only bowled with his right hand, but since he does everything else with his left hand, he was taught to bowl left handed as well, but needs to signal to the umpire when he switch hands when bowling to allow for the field to change. He is a left-handed batsman. As an off-spinner and left-arm orthodox spin, the ball will always spin towards the batsman (OB vs. RHB; SLO vs. LHB), or away from opposite-handed batsmen, which is the predominant role of switch-handed spinners. 

Sri Lankan [[Kusal Perera]] started his cricket as a right hand batsman, until he changed to left hand to mimic his favorite cricketer [[Sanath Jayasuriya]]. Another Sri Lankan [[Kamindu Mendis]] is also a handy ambidextrous bowler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Video: Spinner bowls with both arms in one over at U19 World Cup|url = http://www.newshub.co.nz/sport/video-spinner-bowls-with-both-arms-in-one-over-at-u19-world-cup-2016020409#axzz3yyJNNtdh|website = www.newshub.co.nz|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He can bowl [[Left-arm orthodox spin|orthodox left-arm spin]] and he can bowl right-arm [[Off spin|offspin]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Cue sports ===
In [[cue sports]], players can reach farther across the table if they are able to play with either hand, since the cue must either be placed on the left or the right side of the body. English [[snooker]] player [[Ronnie O'Sullivan]]&lt;ref name="SC"&gt;"[http://www.snookerclub.com/profiles/Ronnie-OSullivan.shtml Ronnie O'Sullivan, "The Rocket"]", Snookerclub.com. Retrieved on 21 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; is a rarity amongst the current ranks of top snooker professionals, in that he is able to play to world standard with either hand. While he lacks power in his left arm, his ability to alternate hands allows him to take shots that would otherwise require awkward cueing or the use of a [[Rest (cue sports)|rest]]. When he first displayed this ability in the [[World Snooker Championship 1996|1996 World Championship]] against the Canadian player [[Alain Robidoux]], Robidoux accused him of disrespect. O'Sullivan responded that he played better with his left hand than Robidoux could with his right.&lt;ref name="SC"/&gt; O'Sullivan was summoned to a disciplinary hearing in response to Robidoux's formal complaint, where he had to prove that he could play to a high level with his left hand. Many people think O'Sullivan had to play a match against former professional [[Rex Williams]], but this never took place. On [[Eurosport]]'s coverage of the 2014 International Championships, commentator David Hendon confirmed that O'Sullivan never played the match against Rex Williams.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Figure skating ===
In [[figure skating]], most skaters who are right-handed spin and jump to the left, and vice versa for left-handed individuals, but it also down to habit for ballerinas. Olympic Champion [[figure skater]] [[John Curry]] notably performed his jumps in one direction (anti-clockwise) while spinning predominantly in the other. Very few skaters have such an ability to perform jumps and spins in both directions, and it is now considered a "difficult variation" in spins under the [[ISU Judging System]] to rotate in the non-dominant direction. [[Michelle Kwan]] used an opposite-rotating [[camel spin]] in some of her programs as a signature move. No point bonus exists for opposite direction jumps or bi-directional combination jumps, despite their being much harder to perfect. Nobody can perform a jump sequence (because it requires change of edge, whereas a combo is maintained on the same edge) from clockwise to anti-clockwise, or vice versa.

=== Football codes===
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
====Association football====
In [[association football]], being able to kick with either foot provides more options for both passing and scoring, as well as the ability to play on either side of the pitch. Therefore, players with the ability to use their weaker foot with proficiency are valuable in any team. Examples of ambidextrous footballers include [[Johan Cruyff]], [[Zinedine Zidane]], [[Glenn Hoddle]], [[Alfredo Di Stéfano]], [[Sócrates]], [[Paolo Maldini]], [[George Best]], [[Michael Laudrup]], [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], [[Pelé]], [[Pavel Nedvěd]], [[Marc Overmars]], [[Michel Platini]], [[Roberto Baggio]], [[Carlos Valderrama]], [[Bobby Charlton]], [[Zico]], [[Tom Finney]], [[John Barnes (footballer)|John Barnes]], and [[John Charles]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1062536-20-greatest-two-footed-players-in-world-football-history |title=20 Great Two-Footed Players in World Football History |publisher=The Bleacher Report |date=15 February 2018 |accessdate=28 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gianluca Pagliuca]] is cross-dominant. He punches and throws with his right, but kicks with his left.

====Rugby====
In [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]] being ambidextrous is an advantage when it comes to passing the ball between teammates as well as being able to use both feet by the halves is an advantage in gaining field position by kicking the ball ahead. [[Jonny Wilkinson]] is a prime example of a union player who is good at kicking with both feet, he is left handed and normally place kicks using his left, but he dropped the goal that won the Rugby World Cup in 2003 with his right. [[Dan Carter]] is actually right handed, but kicks predominantly with his left, sometimes with his right.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/rugby-world-cup/11984780/Dan-Carter-highlights-art-of-kicking-with-both-feet-is-lost.html|title=Dan Carter highlights art of kicking with both feet is lost|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gridiron football====
In [[american football]], it is especially advantageous to be able to use both arms. Ambidextrous receivers can make one-handed catches with either hand; linemen can hold their shoulders square and produce an equal amount of power with both arms; and punters can handle a bad snap and roll out and punt with either leg, limiting the chance of a block. Naturally right-handed quarterbacks may have to perform left-handed passes to avoid sacks. [[Chris Jones (punter)|Chris Jones]] is cross dominant. Although he is a left-footed punter, he throws with his right.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dallascowboys.com/team/players/roster/chris-jones|title=Chris Jones|website=Dallas Cowboys|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Hanson (American football)|Chris Hanson]] was dual-footed, able to punt with either foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/nfl/punting-takes-a-left-turn/ar-BBIfW9V?li=BBnb7Kz&amp;ocid=AARDHP|title=Punting Takes a Left Turn |first=Jenny|last=Vrentas|work=Sports Illustrated|date=January 11, 2018|accessdate=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Golf ===
Some players find cross-dominance advantageous in [[golf]], especially if a left-handed player utilizes right-handed clubs. Having more precise coordination with the left hand is believed to allow better-controlled, and stronger drives. [[Mac O'Grady]] was a touring pro who played right-handed, yet could play "scratch" (no handicap) golf left-handed. He lobbied the USGA for years to be certified as an amateur "lefty" and a pro "righty" to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.golfreview.com/showthread.php?t=2784|title=Golfreview.com Forums|website=forums.golfreview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not ambidextrous, [[Phil Mickelson]] and [[Mike Weir]] are both right-handers who golf left-handed; [[Ben Hogan]] was the opposite, being a natural left-hander who played golf right-handed. This is known as [[cross-dominance]] or mixed-[[handedness]]. Katelyn Johnson is a famous ambidextrous women's golf player.

=== Hockey ===
[[Ice hockey]] players may shoot from the left or right side of the body. For the most part, right-handed players shoot left and, likewise, most left-handed players shoot right as the player will often wield the stick one-handed. The dominant hand is typically placed on the top of the stick to allow for better stickhandling and control of the puck. Players who learn the game in the United States will generally play with their stronger hand in the middle of the stick, thus putting more power into slapshots. [[Gordie Howe]] was one of few players capable of doing both, although this was at a time when the blade of the stick was not curved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/16/sports/olympics/16lefty.html|title=Hockey Stick Divide: Canada Leans Left, U.S. Right|first=Jeff Z.|last=Klein|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ice hockey goaltender [[Bill Durnan]], had the ability to catch the puck with either hand. He won the [[Vezina Trophy]], then for the [[National Hockey League]]'s goalie with the fewest goals allowed six times out of only seven seasons. He had developed this ability playing for church-league teams in Toronto and Montreal to make up for his poor lateral movement. He wore custom gloves that permitted him to hold his stick with either hand. Most goaltenders nowadays choose to catch with their non-dominant hand.

[[Field hockey]] players are forced to play right-handed. The rules of the game denote that the ball can only be struck with the flat side of the stick. Only one player Laeeq Ahmed on Pakistan National Hockey team, played with unorthodox left hand below and right hand up side of stick grip with full command. He played from 1991 to 1992 for the national team. Perhaps to avoid confusing referees, there are no left-handed sticks.

=== Lacrosse ===
In [[field lacrosse]], which is more popular in the United States, it is extremely advantageous to be able to use both hands, as players can play on both sides of the field and are harder to defend against. Usually in field lacrosse, all players except goalies, but especially offensive players, are expected to be able to catch and throw with their weak hand. However, in [[box lacrosse]], which is more popular in Canada, players often only use their dominant hand, like in hockey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laxlibrary.com/lacrosse-content/righties-and-lefties/|title=Going back to "Righties" and "Lefties" {{!}} Lacrosse Library|date=2013-11-18|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Martial arts ===
The [[traditional martial arts]] tend to feature a larger number of practitioners who have intentionally developed ambidexterity to a high degree, compared to athletes in combat sports. This is because unlike sports, which have structured rules and common player preferences, traditional martial arts are intended for situations such as self-defense, in which a wider array of physical challenges may occur.

Some arts and schools practice all or most techniques and movements with both sides, while others emphasize that some techniques should only be trained on the right or the left (though both sides tend to eventually receive nearly equal attention). This may be for a number of reasons. Some of these arts rely on the tendency of right-handed people to move differently with the left side than with the right, and attempt to take advantage of this. Similarly, certain weapons are more often carried on one side. For instance, most weapons in ancient China were wielded primarily with the right hand and on the right side; this habit has carried on to the practice of those weapons in modern times. As an example, in [[Xing Yi Quan]], most schools that teach spear-fighting only practice on the right side, although much of the rest of the art is ambidextrous in practice.

=== Racing ===
In professional [[sports car racing]], drivers who participate in various events in both the United States and Europe will sometimes encounter machines with the steering wheel mounted on different sides of the car. While steering ability is largely unaffected, the hand used for shifting changes. This is further complicated by the fact that the shift pattern relative to the driver changes, e.g. a gear change that requires moving the lever toward the driver in a left-hand-drive vehicle becomes a movement away from the driver in a right-hand-drive vehicle. A driver skilled in shifting with the opposite hand is at an advantage.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Also notice{{original research inline|date=October 2016}} that the more widely adopted [[left-foot braking]] technique in modern race cars requires a sensitive left foot to operate and a left-hand-driver with a more dominated left foot may brake better than those who brakes with right foot or whose left foot isn't dominated, this drastically shorten the time from maximum acceleration to maximum deceleration and left footer possesses a much greater advantages in racing.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Racket sports ===
In [[tennis]], a player may be able to reach balls on the backhand side more easily if they're able to use the weaker hand. An example of a player who is ambidextrous is [[Luke Jensen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newengland.usta.com/news/custom.sps?iType=1175&amp;icustompageid=14191 |title=Luke Jensen Biography |website=USTA New England |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916214901/http://www.newengland.usta.com/?sc_itemid=b85bd15b-6977-4a95-b023-fd4cf1b1dbc4 |archive-date=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rafael Nadal]] uses his right hand for writing, but plays tennis with left. There are many players who are naturally right handed but play lefty and vice versa. [[Evgenia Kulikovskaya]] is also an ambidextrous player, Kulikovskaya played with two forehands and no backhand, switching her racket hand depending on where the ball was coming. [[Jan-Michael Gambill]] is the opposite case of Kulikovskaya, since he played with a two handed forehand and backhand, although he served with his right hand. Other famous examples of a two handed forehand are [[Fabrice Santoro]] and [[Monica Seles]]. Seles' playing style was unusual in that she hit with two hands on both sides and, at the same time, always kept her (dominant) left hand at the base of her racket. This meant that she hit her forehand cross-handed. Currently, [[Maria Sharapova]] is also known to be ambidextrous.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Cheong-eui Kim is a truly ambidextrous player with no backhand, and can serve left-handed as well as right-handed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Stefan Dimov|title=Tennis pro has TWO FOREHANDS and serves (lefty and righty)|date=2017-08-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iosXeyBb9U|accessdate=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is quite uncommon, in [[badminton]], ambidextrous players are able to switch the racquet between their hands, often to get to the awkward backhand corner quickly. As badminton can be a very fast sport, at professional levels of play, players might not have time to switch the racquet, as this disrupts their reaction time.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Rugby ===
While being able to kick both footed are beneficial, cross dominance do exist between hands and feet. [[Dan Carter]] is actually right handed, but kicks predominantly with his left, sometimes with his right.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Jonny Wilkinson|Johnny Wilkinson]] is left handed and left footed, but he has won the 2003 Rugby World Cup final with a right-footed drop kick.

=== Volleyball ===
A volleyball player has to be ambidextrous to control the ball to either direction and performing basic digs. On the other hand, the setter has to be proficient in performing dump sets with either hand to throw off blockers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=The Art of Coaching Volleyball|title=The setter dump - The Art of Coaching Volleyball|date=2016-02-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYFP7KQEfCk|accessdate=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wing spikers that can spike with either hand can alter trajectories to throw off receivers' timing.

== In art ==
Although most artists have a favored hand, some artists use both of their hands for arts such as [[drawing]] and [[Sculpture|sculpturing]]. It is believed that [[Leonardo da Vinci]] utilized both of his hands after an injury to his right hand during his early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15177791 | doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2004.02.042 | volume=55 | title=The handedness of Leonardo da Vinci: a tale of the complexities of lateralisation | journal=Brain Cogn | pages=262–8 | last1 = McManus | first1 = IC | last2 = Drury | first2 = H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary artist, Gur Keren, can draw with both his hands and even feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://illusion.scene360.com/news-community/quasistochastic-morphogenesis/|title=Quasistochastic Morphogenesis|first=|last=Scene360|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627140605/http://www.holesinthenet.co.il/holesinthenet-media-story-2859|title=חורים ברשת - אמן בארבע גפיים: הכירו את גור קרן|date=27 June 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thea Alba was a well-known German who could write with all ten fingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flashbak.com/1920s-thea-alba-was-the-woman-with-10-brains-one-for-each-finger-20442/|title=1920s: Thea Alba Was 'The Woman With 10 Brains' (One For Each Finger) - Flashbak|date=15 September 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary artist Daniel Joy Grimes, AKA "Dani Joy", draws with both hands at the same time during figure drawing sessions that are timed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_0KP2ANVb0 Ambidextrous figure drawing with Dani Joy, from a live model.....]&lt;/ref&gt;When he paints he switches back and forth whenever a hand gets tired. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUfa5TaJPts Ambidextrous painting demo by Dani Joy Artist]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tribalogy is the artistic study of creating abstract lines and shapes on a surface using both hands at the same time. An artist who studies tribalogy is referred to as a tribalogist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030727093455/http://www.tribalogy.com/|title=Wayback Machine|date=27 July 2003|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In music ==
In [[drum and bugle corps (modern)|drum and bugle corps]] (and drum and bell corps), snare drummers, quads (tenors), and bass drummers need to be somewhat ambidextrous. Since they have to abide by what the composer/arranger has written, they have to learn to play their piece starting with either left or right.
Former [[Beatles]] member [[Paul McCartney]] is left-handed ([[guitar]] and [[bass guitar]]), and had his guitar altered (restrung) for performing (as can be seen in many photos and videos throughout his musical career). The drummer of The Beatles, [[Ringo Starr]], is left-handed as well, but he plays a right-handed [[drum kit]]. American instrumental guitarist [[Michael Angelo Batio]] is known for being able to play both right-handed and left-handed guitar proficiently. Irish guitar player [[Niall Horan]], from boyband [[One Direction]], applies on this case. He writes with the left hand but plays the guitar with the right one.
The ambidexterity of [[Jimi Hendrix]], perhaps the most widely acclaimed rock guitarist, has been explored in a psychology [http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/section?content=a918531369&amp;fulltext=713240928 paper]. [[Shara Lin]] is naturally left-handed, but plays the violin and guitar right handed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlBq7eyCnis|title=大黃蜂電吉他矇眼版|first=|last=iamSharaLin|date=13 July 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; She can also play the piano with her left hand while playing the [[zither]] with her right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiVlAevviq8|title=超正點女子一人樂坊演奏 [舞孃]_Taiwan Artist - Shara Lin 林逸欣|first=|last=layla19781101|date=3 May 2011|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kurt Cobain]], from [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], was naturally left-handed, but Donald Cobain, his father, forced him to write with his right handed. Kurt could wrote ambidextrous, but mostly wrote right-handed.

== Tools ==
With respect to tools, ambidextrous may be used to mean that the tool may be used equally well with either hand; an "ambidextrous knife" refers to the opening mechanism and locking mechanism on a folding knife. It can also mean that the tool can be interchanged between left and right in some other way, such as an "ambidextrous headset," which can be worn on either the left or right ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205095305/http://www.tout-lemonde.com/?page=shop/flypage&amp;product_id=174|title=Pruner -Thumb Lock LEFT or RIGHT HAND|date=5 December 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/logitech-cordless-vantage-headset-for-ps3-137352.php|title=Logitech Cordless Vantage Headset for PS3|date=13 September 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an opposite example, some scissors are made specifically for use in one hand, and will not cut properly if used in the other hand. [[Scissors#Right-handed and left-handed scissors|Left-handed as well as ambidextrous scissors]] are nowadays available.

== Knitting ==
In [[knitting]], the use of two needles, the knitter must learn to use both needles seamlessly. Several factors also lead to ambidexterity, the first one being if a person either favors their left hand over their right or if they learned to [[crochet]] before learning to knit. In that case, they either use the Continental method (yarn in left hand, work moving from left needle to right needle; sometimes called 'picking') or the English method (yarn held in right hand, work still moving from left to right needle; sometimes called 'throwing' and more common in the United States.) For colour work both methods can be used at the same time.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Firearms ==
Many modern small arms employ ambidextrous design to accommodate both the right- and left-handed operator. This is advantageous for marketing the firearm to military or law enforcement units because the firearms are distributed in a large scale. Ambidextrous firearms allows for an identical manual of arms regardless of which hand is being used as primary, which streamlines training (eliminates need to have separate training drill for left handed shooting).

Many right-handed persons shoot rifles left-handed because they have a left dominant eye, and the opposite also applies. Generally, it is easier to adapt handedness than to retrain eye-gunsight tracking. Regardless, with training, eye dominance can be overridden.  {{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

''Old West'' gunfighter [[Dallas Stoudenmire]] carried two pistols, and was noted for being equally accurate with either hand.

== Medicine and surgery ==
A degree of ambidexterity is required in surgery because surgeons must be able to tie with their left and right hands in either single or double knots. This is usually due to factors like the positioning of the surgeon, whether they have an assistant and the angle required to throw and secure the knot.

Ambidexterity is also useful after surgery on a dominant hand or arm, as it allows the patient to use their non-dominant hand with equal facility as the limb which is recovering from surgery.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

'''Amir ibn Abd al-Qays''' (d. ca. 661&amp;ndash;680) was a ''[[taba'een|tabi`i]]'' of [[Basra]] who died at [[Damascus]], where he had become famous within the [[Muslim]] community for his austere and eloquent speeches. Numerous miracles are recorded of him; it is said that he lived in the desert where wild beasts came tamely to him. He was also known for his charity towards orphans. These and other aspects of his life are often cited by the [[Sufis]].&lt;ref&gt;Abu Nucaym, 11. 87-95; Safadi, xvi. 585-6; Ibn Marthad, 37-8&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of the [[caliph]] [[Uthman]] (d. 656), the text of the [[Quran]] was standardized, and he despatched a ''[[qari]]'' along with each copy of the Quran to various cities, so as to demonstrate the correct reading to the people. Amir ibn Abd al-Qays was responsible for this important order in Basrah.&lt;ref&gt;''Mujaz 'alum al-Qur'an'', 166&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-aging creams''' are predominantly [[Moisturizer|moisturiser]]-based [[cosmeceutical]] skin care products marketed with the promise of making the consumer look younger by reducing, masking or preventing signs of skin [[aging]]. These signs are laxity (sagging), rhytids ([[wrinkles]]), and [[photoaging]], which includes [[erythema]] (redness), [[dyspigmentation]] (brown discolorations), solar elastosis (yellowing), [[Keratosis|keratoses]] (abnormal growths), and poor texture.&lt;ref&gt;Alexiades-Armenakas MR, et al .J Am Acad Dermatol. 2008 May;58(5):719-37; quiz 738-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite great demand, many anti-aging products and treatments have not been proven to give lasting or major positive effects. One study found that the best performing creams reduced wrinkles by less than 10% over 12 weeks, which is not noticeable to the human eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/health/healthy-living/beauty-personal-care/cosmetics/wrinkle-creams/wrinkle-creams-1-07/overview/0107_cream_ov_1.htm |title=Wrinkle creams - Consumer Reports Health |publisher=Consumerreports.org |date=2011-07-28 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that cheap moisturisers were as effective as high-priced anti-wrinkle creams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.which.co.uk/reviews-ns/anti-wrinkle-eye-creams/index.jsp |title=Anti-wrinkle eye creams - Archive - Which?

Traditionally, anti-aging creams have been marketed towards women, but products specifically targeting men are increasingly common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4433343.stm |title=Drawing a line under men's wrinkles |publisher=BBC News Magazine |date=2005-04-19 |accessdate=2012-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ingredients ==

Anti-aging creams may include conventional moisturising ingredients. They also usually contain specific anti-aging ingredients, such as:
* [[Retinol]] (for instance, in the form of [[retinyl palmitate]]). In various formulations it has been shown to reduce fine lines and pores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/143/5/606 |title=Archderm.ama-assn.org |doi=10.1001/archderm.143.5.606 |publisher=Archderm.ama-assn.org |date=2007-05-01 |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Epidermal growth factor]], to stimulate cell renewal and [[collagen]] production in the skin, and strengthen elasticity and structure. The discovery of epidermal growth factor won [[Stanley Cohen (biochemist)|Stanley Cohen]] and [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]] a Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine in 1986. In various research epidermal growth factor has been shown to reduce fine lines, wrinkles and sagging.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Controlled Release, April 2007, pages 169–176; Journal of Burn Care and Rehabilitation, March–April 2002, pages 116–125; and Journal of Dermatologic Surgery and Oncology, July 1992, pages 604–606&lt;/ref&gt; It also has healing (wounds and burns) and anti-inflammatory properties when applied to skin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Skin Pharmacology and Applied Skin Physiology]], January–April 1999, pages 79–84&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Alpha hydroxy acid]]s (AHAs) and [[beta hydroxy acid]]s or other [[chemical peels]]. These help to dissolve the intracellular "glue" that holds dead cells together on the skin. The use of this type of product on a daily basis gradually enhances the [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliation]] of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]. This exposes newer skin cells and can help improve appearance.  AHAs may irritate some skin, causing redness and flaking.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}
* [[Peptides]], such as Matryxil and [[Copper peptide GHK-Cu|copper peptides]].
* [[Coenzyme Q10]]
* [[Argireline]] (also known as acetyl hexapeptide-3). This peptide relaxes facial muscles to prevent wrinkles and fine lines from forming.
* [[Anti-oxidants]] are substances that &lt;u&gt;may&lt;/u&gt; protect cells from the damage caused by unstable molecules known as free radicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Antioxidants: Beyond the Hype {{!}} The Nutrition Source {{!}} Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health|url = http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/antioxidants/|website = www.hsph.harvard.edu|access-date = 2016-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studies so far are inconclusive, but generally don’t provide strong evidence that antioxidant supplements have a substantial impact on disease.
* [[Sunscreens]] provide a high level of [[Ultraviolet A|UVA]] protection against the effects of UVA radiation, such as wrinkles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skincancer.org/sunscreens-explained.html |title=Sunscreens Explained |publisher=SkinCancer.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=Sunscreen is the most biologically active antiaging ingredient in skin care products, but the antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects of botanicals possess tremendous marketing appeal.|last1=Draelos M.D.|first1=Zoe Diana|title=Article|url=http://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/2010/02000/Active_Agents_in_Common_Skin_Care_Products.38.aspx|website=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vitamin C]] is supposedly one of the most effective and commonly included ingredients in wrinkle creams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= Vitamin C in dermatology| pmc=3673383 | pmid=23741676 | doi=10.4103/2229-5178.110593| volume=4| year=2013| journal=Indian Dermatol Online J| pages=143–6 | last1 = Telang | first1 = PS}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also thought to help the healing process.

== Origin ==
After former [[General Secretary]] [[Hu Yaobang]]'s death on April 15, students mobilized spontaneously&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 67.&lt;/ref&gt; both to mourn Hu's passing and to demand democratic reform in China.&lt;ref&gt;King and Cushman, ''Political Communication'', 117.&lt;/ref&gt; On April 19, at [[Peking University]] (Beida), a meeting was anonymously organized to discuss the ongoing protests in the Square, as well as the prospect of forming an autonomous student organization.&lt;ref name=Wright150&gt;Wright, "State Repression and Student Protest in Contemporary China," 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting, in essence, was a "democracy salon"—an unofficial student discussion group that students at Beida had founded by the former Beida physics [[graduate student]] [[Liu Gang]] months before Hu Yaobang's death.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Li, and Mark, ''Culture and Politics in China'', 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The salon decided that an autonomous organization was necessary to coordinate student protesters on multiple Beijing campuses.&lt;ref name="Li157"/&gt; However, for fear of punishment by the government, few at the meeting were willing to speak out.&lt;ref name="Wright150"/&gt; Those who did, including history student [[Wang Dan (dissident)|Wang Dan]], became the leaders of the newly formed Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation.&lt;ref name=Li159&gt;Li, Li, and Mark, ''Culture and Politics in China'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aim of the new Federation was the rejection of the official student organizations.&lt;ref name="Li157"/&gt; According to one student announcement, "the leadership of the original union is inept, has sold out the students' interests…and is completely unable to represent the students' wishes."&lt;ref name="Calhoun41"/&gt; In this way, the student protesters saw the Federation as representing the wishes of the entire student body.&lt;ref name=Francis904 /&gt; The Federation planned to seek legitimacy by strict observance of democratic policies such as elections and group decision-making.&lt;ref name=Calhoun53&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The students hoped these methods would ensure the organization's unity of leadership,&lt;ref name=Francis908&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 908.&lt;/ref&gt; and would effectively contrast with the lack of transparency they perceived in the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Calhoun53"/&gt; On May 23, the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation established officially at [[Liu Gang]]'s residence near [[Yuanmingyuan]], during the first meeting, the students had elected  [[Zhou Yongjun]] as the first chairman of the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation.&lt;ref&gt;Eddie Cheng, ''Standoff at Tiananmen'' (Sensys Corporation, 2009), 88-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, ''[[People's Daily]]'' published the editorial [[April 26 Editorial|"It is Necessary to Take a Clear-Cut Stand Against Turmoil"]],&lt;ref name=Wright154&gt;Wright, "State Repression and Student Protest in Contemporary China," 154.&lt;/ref&gt; attributing the protests to "a small minority" attempting to "poison people's minds" and "create national turmoil."&lt;ref name=Francis909&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 909.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li, Li, and Mark, ''Culture and Politics in China'', 158.&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation was officially established.&lt;ref name="Saich190"/&gt; At their meeting, around 2,000 students elected a seven-person committee to lead the Federation.&lt;ref name="Li159"/&gt; Concerned by the April 26 editorial, the Federation decided that, as an illegal organization, it needed to reinforce its legitimacy by showing its popular support.&lt;ref name="Wright154"/&gt; To achieve this goal, the Federation organized a demonstration to take place on April 27.&lt;ref name="Wright154"/&gt;

== Dialogue and Recognition ==
Between April 16 and 26, the government had dismissed the autonomous students' demands for recognition and dialogue.&lt;ref name="King121"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis907"/&gt; The government, unwilling to accept the legitimacy of the independent student unions,&lt;ref name="Francis908"/&gt; had attempted instead to arrange talks with individual student leaders.&lt;ref name="Francis909"/&gt; Although the student protesters believed they were acting patriotically&lt;ref name="Li159"/&gt; and morally,&lt;ref&gt;Saich, "The Rise and Fall of the Beijing People's Movement," 191.&lt;/ref&gt; the Communist leadership saw the students' demands as a threat to political and social order.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 915.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the students had difficulty obtaining their goal of direct dialogue with the government.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Li, and Mark, ''Culture and Politics in China'', 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[April 27 Demonstration|April 27 student demonstrations]],&lt;ref name="Francis909"/&gt; the government held its first dialogue with the Federation leaders on April 29.&lt;ref name="King121"/&gt; However, the government avoided direct contact with the Federation, instead inviting student leaders to meet on an individual basis.&lt;ref name=Calhoun56&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 56.&lt;/ref&gt; While some students saw the government's offer as a victory,&lt;ref name="Francis909"/&gt; others felt that they should only attend the dialogue as recognized representatives of the Federation.&lt;ref name="Francis909"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Calhoun56"/&gt; [[Wuer Kaixi]], a Federation leader, attended the dialogue as a "private individual",&lt;ref name="Calhoun56"/&gt; but decided to leave midway through to protest the government's lack of recognition of the Federation.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 910.&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfied with the dialogue, Wuer Kaixi later described it as a "trick of the government to destroy the student solidarity."&lt;ref name=King122&gt;King and Cushman, ''Political Communication'', 122.&lt;/ref&gt; During the meeting, [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] spokesman Yuan Mu insisted that the Communist Party and the student protesters shared the same goals.&lt;ref name="King122"/&gt;

On May 1, the Federation rejected the legitimacy of the April 29 dialogue in a news conference.&lt;ref name="Francis911"/&gt; The following day, the Federation presented a twelve-point petition, including a demand that future government efforts at dialogue be sincere.&lt;ref name="King122"/&gt; Although the government rejected this petition,&lt;ref name="King122"/&gt; the petition represented a compromise on the students' part, as [[Amnesty International]] researcher Corinna-Barbara Francis suggests.&lt;ref name=Francis912&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 912.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, instead of demanding explicit government recognition, the students only asked for dialogue "on the basis of full equality between the two parties."&lt;ref name="Francis912"/&gt; By May 29, the students' demands were reduced to two: denunciation of the April 26 editorial by the government and acknowledgement of the federation's democratic nature.&lt;ref name="Francis912"/&gt;

== Division and Decline ==
[[File:蒲志強19890510.jpg|thumb|A photo of [[Pu Zhiqiang]], a student protester at [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen]], taken on 10 May 1989.]]
On May 4, the Federation successfully organized a demonstration of over 100,000 protesters in Tiananmen Square, marking the 70-year anniversary of the [[May 4 Movement|1919 May 4 Movement]].&lt;ref name="Wright155"/&gt; Also on May 4, the Federation decided to end the boycott on class attendance it had begun on April 24.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, "The Progress of Protest in China," 905.&lt;/ref&gt; This sudden and unexpected end to the boycott, and loss of momentum in student-government negotiations, resulted in a loss of student enthusiasm for the protests.&lt;ref name="Wright155"/&gt;&lt;ref name="King122"/&gt; As student leader [[Chai Ling]] noted "the movement dwindled to a low point as more and more students returned to classes."&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to reinvigorate the movement, Chai Ling and other students started a [[hunger strike]] on the Square.&lt;ref name="Wright155"/&gt; Although the Federation initially opposed the hunger strikers during its May 12 meeting, it eventually decided to support individual strikers, but avoided official endorsement of the Hunger Strike Group.&lt;ref name="Li157"/&gt; As the protests continued throughout May and into June, the Hunger Strike Group would take control of events in the Square, and would largely displace the authority previously held by the Beijing Students' Autonomous Federation.&lt;ref&gt;Calhoun, ''Neither Gods Nor Emperors'', 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dingxin Zhao, ''The Power of Tiananmen: State-Society Relations and the 1989 Beijing Student Movement'' (University of Chicago Press, 2008), 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government Response ==
Speaking with [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|Party General Secretary]] [[Zhao Ziyang]] on May 4, [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Premier]] [[Li Peng]] voiced his concern over the ongoing protests in the Square.&lt;ref name=Zhang117&gt;Liang Zhang, Andrew J Nathan, and E. Perry Link, ''The Tiananmen Papers'' (New York: PublicAffairs, 2002), 117.&lt;/ref&gt; While Zhao Ziyang contended that the April 26 editorial had encouraged student protesters, Li Peng contended that this was too simple an explanation for the growth of the protest movement, suggesting that the April 26 editorial "did not accuse the vast majority of students of creating turmoil."&lt;ref name="Zhang117"/&gt; Li Peng also opposed to the student protester's demands for negotiation.&lt;ref name=Zhang118&gt;Zhang, Nathan, and Link, ''The Tiananmen Papers'', 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Voicing concern over the rising prominence of the "illegal student organizations," &lt;ref name="Zhang117"/&gt; Li objected to the Federation's desire "to negotiate with the Party and government as equals" and saw the students' twelve-point petition as a "threat."&lt;ref name="Zhang118"/&gt; In his conversation with Zhao, Li also asserted that the Federation's primary goal was to "negate the leadership of the CCP and negate the entire socialist system."&lt;ref name="Zhang118"/&gt;

On May 13, after the hunger striker's announced their plan, [[Yan Mingfu]], Director of the Party's [[United Front Work Department]], met with a number of intellectuals and student protesters, including Wang Dan, Chai Ling, and Wuer Kaixi.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Nathan, and Link, ''The Tiananmen Papers'', 158.&lt;/ref&gt; At the meeting, Yan Mingfu suggested that if the student protesters stopped their hunger strike and instead submitted their "demands and suggestions through proper channels," he could assure them that "the door to dialogue" would remain open.&lt;ref name=Zhang159&gt;Zhang, Nathan, and Link, ''The Tiananmen Papers'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when he later briefed Zhao Ziyang on the meeting, Yan Mingfu shared his unease at the divisions he observed among the student protesters: "the AFS [the Federation], the Dialogue Delegation, and representatives of the hunger strikers…are in disagreement among themselves…I'm not sure any of them truly represents the hunger strikers or can exert any influence on them."&lt;ref name="Zhang159"/&gt;

'''''Bionic Six''''' is an American-Japanese animated television series that aired from 1987 to 1989. It was produced by [[TMS Entertainment]] and distributed, through first-run syndication, by [[MCA Inc.|MCA TV]], years before the latter company became [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/copyright/bionic-six/|title=Bionic Six – Copyright Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renowned Japanese animation director [[Osamu Dezaki]] was involved as chief supervising director, and his distinctive style (as seen in ''[[Golgo 13]]'' and ''[[Cobra (manga)|Cobra]]'') is evident throughout all its episodes.

The title characters of the series are a family of [[cyborg|machine-enhanced]] human beings possessing unique powers after being augmented with [[bionics|bionic technology]]. Each family member is given specific bionic powers, and thus they form a superhero team called the Bionic Six.

==Plot==
In the near future (some unspecified decades after 1999&lt;ref name="ep15"/&gt;), Professor Dr. Amadeus Sharp Ph.D., head of the Special Projects Labs (SPL), creates a new form of technology to augment humans through bionics. His first subject was Jack Bennett, a test pilot who secretly acted as Sharp's field agent, Bionic-1. On a family ski vacation in the Himalayas, an alien spacecraft triggers an avalanche that buries the entire family, exposing them to the unusual radiation of a mysterious buried object. Jack frees himself but discovers his family in a comatose state. Theorizing that Jack's bionics protected him from the radiation, Professor Sharp implants bionic technology in the others, awakening them. Afterward, the family operates incognito as a publicly lauded team of adventuring superheroes, the Bionic Six.

The primary antagonist of the series is a mad scientist known as Doctor Scarab, along with his gang of henchmen{{spaced ndash}}Glove, Madam-O, Chopper, Mechanic, and Klunk{{spaced ndash}}accompanied by Scarab's legion of drone robots called Cyphrons. Scarab is Professor Sharp's brother. Obsessed with obtaining immortality and ruling the world, Scarab believes that the key to both goals lies in the secret bionic technology invented by his brother, ever plotting to possess it.

*'''Professor Dr. Amadeus Sharp Ph.D.''' is the genius scientist who infused the Bionic Six team with bionics. As was the case with Dr. Rudolph "Rudy" Wells in both ''The Six Million Dollar Man'' and ''The Bionic Woman,'' all his research is supported by the government, and Sharp's technology must be periodically reviewed by government agency Q10.&lt;ref name="ep60"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Ready, Aim, Fired | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lives alone in his private museum, which houses his secret Special Projects Lab, the hidden base of the Bionic Six. Amadeus is also Scarab's brother.&lt;ref name="ep06"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Family Affair | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp excels in the fields of [[aeronautics]],&lt;ref name="ep20"&gt;{{cite episode | title = The Perceptor File | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[animatronics]],&lt;ref name="ep07"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Happy Birthday, Amadeus | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[archaeology]],&lt;ref name="ep01"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Valley of Shadows | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; bionics,&lt;ref name="ep10"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Bionics On!

(Oppenheimer was also the second actor to play Rudy Wells in ''The Six Million Dollar Man.'')

The Bennett family includes patriarch Jack, matriarch Helen, Eric, Meg, J.D., and Bunji. They live in a secluded oceanfront home in the fictional city of Cypress Cove, in northern [[California]].&lt;ref name="ep38"&gt;{{cite episode | title = You've Come a Long Way, Baby! | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each member wears a special ring and a "[[wristwatch computer|wristcomp]]" (a mini-computer hardwired into the wrist), which they use to activate their bionic powers. The Bionic Six can also combine their powers by joining hands, creating a "Bionic Link" to amplify their abilities.&lt;ref name="ep01"/&gt;

*'''Jack Bennett,''' aka '''Bionic-1,''' is an engineer,&lt;ref name="ep34"&gt;{{cite episode | title = The Man in the Moon | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; an expert test pilot,&lt;ref name="ep20"/&gt; and the secret agent known to the world only as "Bionic-One."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Episode #10: "Bionics On! The First Adventure"&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoys gourmet cooking,&lt;ref name="ep19"&gt;{{cite episode | title = 1001 Bionic Nights | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; even participating in the Paris Food Conference.&lt;ref name="ep08"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Brain Food | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bionic-1's powers are mostly related to his bionic eyes (including "x-ray vision," telescopic sight, energy blasts, and low-powered beams that temporarily cause electronic devices to malfunction or even turn against their users), and enhanced hearing (this last capability beyond even the powers of the other team members, who each possess superhuman levels of hearing in their own right). His family was initially unaware of his secret bionic identity until bestowed with powers of their own.&lt;ref name="ep10"/&gt; Bionic-1 was voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]].&lt;ref name="TVGuide"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/bionic-six/cast/200090/ | title = Bionic Six Cast and Details}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Helen Bennett,''' aka '''Mother-1,''' is Jack's wife. She is an oceanographer&lt;ref name="ep34"/&gt; and an accomplished marine biologist.&lt;ref name="ep04"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Klunk in Love | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mother-1 possesses various [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]] powers that allow her to occasionally see glimpses of the future,&lt;ref&gt;Episode #21: Masterpiece"&lt;/ref&gt; telepathically communicate with other sentient and non-sentient beings, determine the function and operation of mechanical devices by mentally "tracing" their internal workings,&lt;ref&gt;Episode #20: "The Perceptor File"&lt;/ref&gt; and can mentally project [[hologram]]-like optical illusions. She is also an accomplished fighter, having bested Dr. Scarab's henchwoman Madame-O on the occasions when the two physically fought each other one-on-one. She was voiced by [[Carol Bilger]].&lt;ref name="TVGuide"/&gt;
*'''Eric Bennett,''' aka '''Sport-1,''' is Jack's and Helen's blond, athletic son. At local Albert Einstein High School, Eric is a shortstop on the baseball team, the Einstein Atoms.&lt;ref name="ep03"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Eric Bats a Thousand | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He routinely employs baseball vernacular in his dialogue. As Sport-1, he affects electromagnetic powers to attract or repel metallic objects with tremendous force, meld them together, or even rip them apart. This force is directional and{{spaced ndash}}by varying the configuration of his hands, or by using one or both arms{{spaced ndash}}Sport-1 can adjust the strength of attraction or repulsion. He can also use objects as he would a baseball bat, including steel beams, lampposts and other objects (including baseball bats) to redirect incoming objects and energy blasts; infused by the same field that comes from his arms, he can use those ordinarily fragile objects to hit and deflect things they normally could not. (In one instance, he used a steel beam to hit an incoming asteroid.) He was voiced by [[Hal Rayle]].&lt;ref name="TVGuide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toonarific.com/interview.php?interview_id=23|title=Hal Rayle Interview @ Toonarific Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Meg Bennett,''' aka '''Rock-1,''' is Jack's and Helen's daughter and Eric's younger sister.&lt;ref name="ep03"/&gt; Meg is an excitable, and somewhat ditsy, teen who loves music. She is prone to habitual use of the future-slang phrase "So-LAR!" (comparable to "awesome"), as well as the prefixes "Mega-!" (as befitting her first name) and "Ultra-!" At Albert Einstein High School, Meg is a member of the debate team; in a number of episodes, she is seen dating a classmate named Bim.&lt;ref name="ep15"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Youth or Consequences | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Rock-1, she can emit sonic beams from blaster units mounted on her shoulders{{spaced ndash}}the blaster units are only visible when she assumes "bionic mode." She can also run at blinding speeds, faster than other members of the team. (These can all run at superhuman speeds in their own right, though nowhere near as fast as she can.) Meg and Eric are the only Bennett offspring biologically related to each other, and to their parents. Meg was voiced by [[Bobbi Block]].&lt;ref name="TVGuide"/&gt;
*'''James Dwight "J.D." Corey,''' aka '''IQ,''' is Jack's and Helen's remarkably intelligent, adopted African-American son. He enjoys amateur boxing, although he is not particularly skilled at it.&lt;ref name="ep56"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Shadow Boxer | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As IQ, he has both super-human strength (he is even stronger than the other members of the team with super-human strength, making him the strongest member of the team) and super-intelligence. J.D. was the only team member whose bionic code name did not include the number "1" as a suffix. He was voiced by [[Norman Bernard]].&lt;ref name="TVGuide"/&gt;
*'''Bunjiro "Bunji" Tsukahara,''' aka '''Karate-1,''' is Jack's and Helen's Japanese foster son. He was placed under their guardianship after his own father disappeared 10 years earlier somewhere in the East.&lt;ref name="ep02"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Enter the Bunji | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bunji is an avid karate enthusiast. As Karate-1, he has enhanced martial arts skills, made more formidable when applying his bionics. As such, his agility levels surpasses that of his teammates, and his reflexes are among the sharpest, and only Rock-1's reflexes surpass his, due to her super-speed. He was voiced by [[Brian Tochi]].&lt;ref name="TVGuide"/&gt;
*'''F.L.U.F.F.I.''' is a gorilla-like robot who lives as a housekeeper with the Bennetts. He regularly demonstrates a comical craving for aluminum cans that extends to casually devouring the Bennetts's cookware, vehicles, or other metal objects.&lt;ref name="ep13"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Fugitive F.L.U.F.F.I. | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his bungling behavior, he nonetheless proves helpful around the Bennett home, or assisting the Bionic Six with physical tasks in the field. F.L.U.F.F.I. was voiced by [[Neil Ross]].

===Villains===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:TeamScarab.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Team Scarab, left to right: the traitorous Glove, the dim-witted Mechanic, the ruthless Chopper, the seductive Madame-O and the grotesque Klunk.]] --&gt;
The primary antagonist of the series is '''Dr. Scarab'''{{spaced ndash}}real name Dr. Wilmer Sharp Ph.D., who is Amadeus Sharp's brother.&lt;ref name="ep06"/&gt; Scarab is a hefty, egotistically brilliant and occasionally comical man who yearns for the secret to eternal life and world domination. His right eye has been modified with a monocle that has a low-powered scanner that can detect individuals with bionics, even when they are disguised, and a destructive, high-powered beam. In rare instances throughout the series, he seemingly demonstrates superhuman, bionic strength of his own (on at least one occasion, he picked up Mother-One effortlessly and threw her around;&lt;ref&gt;Episode #22: "Mrs. Scarab"&lt;/ref&gt; in another instance, he was seen carrying as much solid gold out of Fort Knox as his other bionic minions{{ndash}}several hundred pounds' worth.&lt;ref&gt;Episode #64: "The Return of Scarabina."&lt;/ref&gt;)He was voiced by [[Jim MacGeorge]],&lt;ref name="TVGuide"/&gt; who imitated the voice of [[George C. Scott]] when providing that character voice.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Dr. Scarab has assembled a motley team of henchmen (described below), imbued with an apparently lesser form of the same bionic powers employed by the Bionic Six. (Another one of Scarab's goals in the series is to try to figure out the secrets behind his brother's superior bionics knowledge.)

* '''Glove''' is a purple-skinned villain named for his left-handed blaster glove which is capable of firing both beams and projectiles. He serves as the field leader in Scarab's evil plans (hence made a frequent target for punishment for failures) and constantly vies to replace Dr. Scarab as leader. Although cunning and vicious, he tends to retreat at the first sign of defeat. His strength varies, as in some instances, he seems to be the equal of Bionic-1, while in one instance, he was able to physically overpower and dominate both Bionic-1 and Karate-1 at the same time. He was voiced by [[Frank Welker]].&lt;ref name="web_fw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mkbmemorial.com/FWHp/film_ab.htm#B|title=The Frank Welker Homepage: Filmography A-B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Madame-O''' is an enigmatic blue-skinned femme fatale who wears a full face mask and uses a harp-like weapon to fire sonic blasts. She has a verbal tic of ending many of her statements with the word "...darling." While possessing super strength, she is not as strong as many of the other characters; Mother-1 was able to defeat her in physical struggles in various occasions. Before her transformation, she actually appeared to be an elderly woman.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; She was voiced by [[Jennifer Darling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jenniferdarling.com/animation.htm|title=Jennifer Darling Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Mechanic''' is a dim-witted, childish brute who employs various mechanical tools as weapons{{spaced ndash}}nail or rivet guns, throwing circular saw blades, using a large wrench as a bludgeon. Despite his short temper, he has a soft spot for animals and an engrossing fondness for (in-universe) children's television cartoons. He was voiced by [[Frank Welker]].&lt;ref name="web_fw"/&gt;
* '''Chopper''' is a chain-wielding thug who articulates sounds mimicking a revving motorcycle. He is sometimes depicted riding a three-wheeled motorcycle vehicle. He, like both Mechanic and Glove, was voiced by [[Frank Welker]].&lt;ref name="web_fw"/&gt; (Perhaps by intentional design, Welker had previously voiced ''another'' character by the name of Chopper, with exactly the same voice and "vocal mannerisms," in a 1970s-era cartoon titled ''[[Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch]].'')
* '''Klunk''' is a patchwork monstrosity who appears to be made of living glue, and who rarely speaks coherently.&lt;ref&gt;Bionic Six Episode 4: "Klunk in Love"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ep27"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Mindlink | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after his creation, Scarab noted to himself to "use a little less power next time."&lt;ref name="ep10"/&gt; While relatively unintelligent, he is considered one of the most dangerous opponents to engage in battle with, due to his unparalleled strength (his strength appears to surpass even that of I.Q, the strongest member of the Bionic Six), high resistance to physical attacks, and his gooey body's ability to engulf his opponent{{spaced ndash}}even Dr. Scarab fears him to some extent. Unlike the other minions of Dr. Scarab, he is (understandably) horrified by his own transformation and longs to be human again. He, like Jack "Bionic-1" Bennett, was voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]].

Dr. Scarab has tried to create additional minions with limited success, usually due to envying interference from his existing henchmen. Some of these include:

* '''Mrs. Scarab''', aka '''Scarabina'''{{spaced ndash}}Dr. Scarab's attempt at cloning a perfect mate for himself: a woman possessing his own intelligence added to Mother-1's beauty and ESP powers. Madame-O tampered with the lab equipment during her creation, resulting in an obnoxious female version of Dr. Scarab who was utterly devoted to him. Scarab, though repulsed by her, attempted to use her to his advantage. She eventually caught on to his manipulation and left him.&lt;ref name="ep44"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Mrs. Scarab | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned in a subsequent episode, trying to win his affection by creating opposite-sex versions of his own henchmen to overcome the Bionic Six through sheer numbers.&lt;ref name="ep64"&gt;{{cite episode | title = The Return of Mrs. Scarab | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Shadow Boxer'''{{spaced ndash}}Rescuing a down-on-his-luck former boxing champion from arrest and trying to give him powers, Dr. Scarab instead accidentally creates Shadow Boxer due to Glove's interference. Rather than becoming merely another super strong minion, Shadow Boxer acquired the ability to solidify his shadow and to act through it at will. He apparently lost this ability when Bionic-1 exposed his shadow to an intense light and it faded away.&lt;ref name="ep56"/&gt;

Where covert action is called for, Scarab and his gang go disguised via their "Bionic Masking Units." To disengage these electronically imparted disguises, they slam their fists to their chest insignias and exclaim, "Hail Scarab!" (Scarab, however, vainly exclaims, "Hail me!"). Doing so serves a secondary purpose {{spaced ndash}}the activation of a temporary strength enhancement.

In addition to his henchmen, Scarab also uses [[robot]]s of his own design, called Cyphrons, in battles against the Bionic Six. The Cyphrons are, like the rest of his minions, generally incompetent but dangerous in large numbers. Attempts by Scarab to create more advanced Cyphron units are shown to backfire.

===Supporting characters===
''Bionic Six'' episodes also featured a number of recurring, supporting characters.

* '''Bunji's Father.''' Bunji's (unnamed) father, who taught him his martial arts skills but suddenly and mysteriously vanished over 10 years ago (causing Bunji to be adopted by the Bennetts in the first place), shows up in several episodes of the series during its run. He assists his son in instances where his son's life is in danger and there is no other apparent way to save him. It is implied that he has ascended to some unknown, higher plane of existence through his martial arts training, and has become a quasi-immortal being. His efforts at saving his son are usually orchestrated in ways that are unseen and unnoticed by everyone, including his son, and his own son does not even know for sure that his father is alive or what has become of him until much later into the series. He first appeared in episode #2, "Enter the Bunji." He was voiced by [[Shuko Akune]].
* '''Perceptor.''' Peter Wilcox was one of the finest bionic researchers under Professor Sharp. Due to impatience, Wilcox tested their bionic experiment on himself. The experiment bestowed on Wilcox bionic abilities, but at the cost of his own sight. Blaming technology for his blindness, Wilcox became the anti-technology vigilante known as the Perceptor. However, after a confrontation with Sharp and the Bionic Six, Wilcox renounces his terrorist activities to become a hero and occasional ally of the Bionic Six.&lt;ref name="ep20"/&gt; Perceptor was voiced by [[Neil Ross]].
* '''Dr. Hugo Fish.''' An eccentric scientist inventor and colleague to Professor Sharp, Dr. Fish consistently creates devices with unusual functions, including foodstuff that grants enhanced intelligence,&lt;ref name="ep08"/&gt; a device that gives people the ability to recreate famous works of art,&lt;ref name="ep21"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Masterpiece | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; an animatronic theme park,&lt;ref name="ep23"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Holidaze | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a device capable of generating giant mushrooms.&lt;ref name="ep46"&gt;{{cite episode | title = The Fungus Among Us | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These quirky inventions often put him in crossfire between the Bionic Six and Scarab's group. Dr. Fish was voiced by [[Howard Morris]].
* '''The Bandroids''' are androids, created by Dr. Bruce "Bad Brains" Huxter, designed to perform as a musical band. The Bandroids are guitarist Rivet Rick, keyboardist Techno Tex, bassist Metalhand, and drummer Bob. Each Bandroid has their musical instrument designed into their chassis and showcases some special ability: Rivet Rick can generate force fields, Techno Tex is equipped with two six-shooters, Metalhand can grow in size and has a jet pack, and Bob can generate electrical blasts from his drumsticks. The Bandroids perform in concert and are reported to have had four consecutive number one hits.&lt;ref name="ep25"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Music Power | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Kaleidoscope.''' Harlan Nails was a brilliant scientist who worked alongside Prof. Sharp in the field of Bionics. During that time, he invented a device that could temporarily rearrange an item's atomic structure. After Sharp snubbed him, Dr. Nails continued to experiment independently, soon partnering with Dr. Scarab. Nails created an outfit from his invention to become a master of disguise, calling himself Kaleidoscope. He became Scarab's partner in crime, until Scarab betrayed him. Kaleidoscope was the true inventor of much of Scarab's technology, including his Bionic Masking Units and the first-generation Cyphrons. After spending 20 years in jail, Nails is released into the custody of the Bionic Six to help track down Scarab. However, the newly escaped Kaleidoscope has only one thing on his mind: revenge on both Dr. Scarab and Prof. Sharp.&lt;ref name="ep42"&gt;{{cite episode | title = Kaleidoscope | series = Bionic Six | serieslink = Bionic Six | airdate = 1987-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaleidoscope's suit is one-of-a-kind, and attuned so that only he can use it. Unlike the Bionic Masking Units employed by Scarab's minions, Kaleidoscope's suit can not only create illusions, but also temporarily reconfigure matter; in one instance, he once transformed his body into a large metal plate of armor, shielding the Bionic Six from a massive energy beam intended to kill them all.&lt;ref&gt;Episode #50: "I, Scarab" part 2&lt;/ref&gt; In "I, Scarab," Kaleidoscope is blackmailed by Sharp to help Perceptor and the Bandroids rescue the captured Bionic Six and help defeat Scarab's mind control over the world. Kaleidoscope yells at the group over how he is no hero, but a crook. However, Sharp points out that Harlan has not committed any crimes since his escape from prison. Kaleidoscope admits that his time in jail soured him on crime and aids the group in defeating Scarab, earning a pardon as a reward.

==Bionic Six vehicles==
* '''The Sky Dancer''' is the Bionic Six's jet for long-range missions. The Sky Dancer can carry the Bionic six and all their support vehicles. It is housed on the Bionic base and enters via an underwater runway.
* '''The M.U.L.E.S. Van,''' or '''M'''obile '''U'''ti'''l'''ity '''E'''nergizing '''S'''tation, is a support vehicle that can fly, carry the team on short-range missions, and carry their motorcycles and Quad ATVs. At one time, the Van was outfitted with crab armor.&lt;ref&gt;SE2 EP#33{{spaced ndash}}I Am the Viper&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episode list==
{{Main|List of Bionic Six episodes}}

The first season of Bionic Six introduces viewers to the Bennett family, and to Scarab and his goons. Karate-1's origin is explored, and the mystery of his missing father is introduced. The origin of both the Bionic Six and of Scarab and his lackeys is revealed early on in the 22-episode run. The supporting characters of Dr. Fish and Perceptor are also introduced.

The second season continues on from the first seamlessly. Old supporting characters like Perceptor and Dr. Fish return, and new characters, such as the Bandroids are brought aboard. The second season includes a two-part episode titled "I, Scarab," wherein Professor Sharp assembles a second Bionic Six group to rescue the original team. This second team is made up of supporting characters from prior episodes: Kaleidoscope, Perceptor, and the Bandroids.

The series finale finds several of the members from the Bionic Six trapped for a time in a dimension where the "cartoon characters" (with an animation style highly reminiscent of Tiny Toons and Animaniacs, an animated series TMS would, during this time, soon work on) of their favorite TV shows exist; after I.Q., Rock-One and Karate-One escape, I.Q notes that in the cartoon dimension, the characters were unaware that they were imaginary characters; he then wonders if it is at all possible that he and everyone else in the "real" world are cartoon characters themselves. His family dismisses his thoughts as meaningless babble{{spaced ndash}}as a bunch of characters from the cartoon dimension walk outside the Bennett family's residence and break the [[fourth wall]] as the episode fades out.

==Merchandising==

===Action figures===
Produced by [[LJN]] in 1986, the line consisted of 13 figures (Jack, Helen, J.D., Eric, Meg, Bunji, F.L.U.F.F.I., Doctor Scarab, Glove, Mechanic, Madame-O, Chopper, and Klunk), five vehicles and one playset. These figures and vehicles were made up of plastic and die-cast metal with some of the figures having
transparent limbs. The 13 figures were designed and copyrighted by Paul Samulski on behalf of LJN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?hd=1,1&amp;SC=Author&amp;SA=Samulski%2C%20Paul&amp;PID=dNlex1rk3MbS0-5iNsscI6k05ieMH&amp;HIST=0&amp;SEQ=20100130200155&amp;SID=2|title=Samulski, Paul Copyright Info}}&lt;/ref&gt;
F.L.U.F.F.I. the robot ape was difficult to find early in the show's release, but became easier to come by later as the line lost popularity. Today, the line remains moderately collectible with the playset and vehicles being the hardest to come across.

===Books===
[[Grosset &amp; Dunlap]] Publishing produced the ''Bionic Six Super Picture Book,'' a collection of color and black &amp; white pin-ups of the Bionic Six, Dr. Sharp, F.L.U.F.F.I., and Scarab's team. The books's art was supplied by Vince Perez and Lisa Santangelo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kochman | first = Charles | title = Bionic Six | publisher = Grosset &amp; Dunlap | year = 1987 | pages = | isbn = 0-448-19057-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Bionic Six'' comic book (illustration credited to "Espinoza &amp; Hooper" &lt;nowiki&gt;[sic]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) advertised mid-1988 for forthcoming release by independent publisher New Comics Group &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hama | first = Larry | title = Young Master (issue 4, back cover in-house advertisement) | publisher = New Comics Group | date = May 1988 | pages = 32 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; never materialized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3550">'''Brachymeiosis''' was a hypothesized irregularity in the [[Ascomycota#Sexual reproduction|sexual reproduction of ascomycete fungi]], a variant of [[meiosis]] following an "extra" [[karyogamy]] (nuclear fusion) step. The hypothesized process would have transformed four [[diploid]] [[nucleus (cell)|nuclei]] into eight [[haploid]] ones. The current [[scientific consensus]] is that brachymeiosis does not occur in any fungi.&lt;ref name="Carlile"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Carlile | first=Michael J. | title=Two influential mycologists: Helen Gwynne-Vaughan (1879-1967) and Lilian Hawker (1908-1991) | journal=Mycologist | volume=19 | issue=03 | year=2005 | pages=129–131 | doi=10.1017/s0269915x05003058}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the current understanding, [[Ascomycota|ascomycetes]] reproduce by forming male and female organs ([[Antheridium|antheridia]]/spermatia and [[ascogonium|ascogonia]]), transferring [[haploid]] [[nucleus (cell)|nuclei]] from the antheridium to the ascogonium, and growing a dikaryotic [[ascus]] containing both nuclei. Karyogamy then occurs in the ascus to form a diploid nucleus, followed by meiosis and [[mitosis]] to form eight haploid nuclei in the [[ascospore]]s.&lt;ref name="Dube"&gt;{{cite book | last=Dube | first=H.C. | title=Introduction To Fungi, 3E | publisher=Vikas Publishing House Pvt Limited | year=2009 | isbn=978-81-259-1433-4 | page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, the botanist [[Robert Almer Harper|R.A. Harper]] reported the observation of a second karyogamy event in the ascogonium prior to ascogeny. This would imply the creation of a tetraploid nucleus in the ascus, rather than a diploid one; in order to produce the observed haploid ascospores, a second meiotic reduction in chromosome count would then be necessary. The second reduction was hypothesized to occur during the second or third mitotic division in the ascus, even though chromosome reduction does not typically occur during mitosis. This supposed form of meiosis was termed “brachymeiosis” in 1908 by H. C. I. Fraser.&lt;ref name="Swingle"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Swingle | first=D.B. | title=Fertilization in ''Ascodesmis nigricans'' Van Tiegh| journal=American Journal of Botany | date=1934 | jstor=2436104 | volume=21 |pages=519–545 | doi=10.2307/2436104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of brachymeiosis was controversial throughout the first half of the twentieth century, with many conflicting results published. Then, research with improved staining techniques established clearly that only one reductive division occurs in the asci of all examined species, including some which had been believed to undergo brachymeiosis.&lt;ref name="Hirsch"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hirsch | first=Hilde E. | title=No Brachymeiosis in Pyronema Confluens | journal=Mycologia | volume=42 | issue=2 | year=1950 | page=301 | doi=10.2307/3755444 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Olive"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olive |first=L.

The '''Buttington Oak''' was a tree near to [[Offa's Dyke]] at [[Buttington]], [[Wales]], said to have been planted to mark the site of the [[Battle of Buttington]] between the Vikings and a Mercian, Wessex and Welsh force in 893.  It had been [[Pollarding|pollarded]] for timber at some point in its history.  The oak tree was rediscovered in 2009.  It was badly damaged by storms in 2017 and fell in February 2018.

The oak was said to have been planted by locals to mark the 893 [[Battle of Buttington]], a victory of an allied [[Mercia]]n, [[Wessex]] and Welsh force against invading Vikings or as a boundary marker on [[Offa's Dyke]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousand-year-old oak on Offa’s Dyke finally fallen|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/thousand-year-old-oak-on-offa-s-dyke-finally-fallen-dnjm7pqrz|accessdate=20 February 2018|work=The Times|date=19 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tree was located near [[Welshpool]] and close to the dyke, an 8th-century earthwork that marked the border between Mercia and the [[Kingdom of Powys]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The tree stood in fields on a flood plain to the north of [[Buttington]] and east of the [[River Severn]] and was accessible by a [[public footpath]] (approximately half a mile's walk from the [[A458 road]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miles|first1=Archie|title=The British Oak|date=2013|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=9781472114105|page=296|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I8WbBQAAQBAJ|accessdate=19 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sky/&gt;  The oak was a working tree, being [[Pollarding|pollarded]], to provide timber for the local community and may have been used to fashion weapons.&lt;ref name=sky/&gt;

== Description ==
The Buttington Oak was not rediscovered until 2009 and was not protected by any legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=March|first1=Polly|title=Tree hunter's epic quest nears end|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-mid-wales-36533155|accessdate=20 February 2018|work=BBC News|date=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At around {{convert|11|m}} in girth the oak was the largest tree on the dyke and the second-largest oak in Wales.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=sky/&gt;  The [[Woodland Trust]] described it as "an iconic feature of the landscape".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meet some very special trees|url=https://www.woodlandtrust.org.uk/get-involved/campaign-with-us/our-campaigns/vi-trees/showcase/|publisher=Woodland Trust|accessdate=20 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buttington Oak was badly damaged by storms in 2017 which caused it to split in two.&lt;ref name=sky&gt;{{cite news|title=1,000-year-old oak tree on England-Wales border crashes down after storm|url=https://news.sky.com/story/1000-year-old-oak-tree-on-england-wales-border-crashes-down-after-storm-11257771|accessdate=20 February 2018|work=Sky News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tree fell in February 2018, an event first noticed by the same man who recorded it in 2009.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|title=1,000-year-old oak on Offa's Dyke falls|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-mid-wales-43084088|accessdate=19 February 2018|work=BBC News|date=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The tree was estimated to be more than one thousand years old when it died.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

Saint '''Castulus''' (died 286) is venerated as a [[martyr]].  According to tradition, he was the [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]] (or officer, valet) of Emperor [[Diocletian]] and the husband of '''Irene of Rome''', also venerated as a saint.&lt;ref name="heiligenlexikon.de"/&gt;

==Biography==
A convert to the [[Christian]] religion, he sheltered Christians in his home and arranged for religious services inside the palace of the emperor.  Among those he sheltered were [[Mark and Marcellian]].&lt;ref&gt;Ebenezer Cobham Brewer, ''A Dictionary of Miracles: Imitative, Realistic, and Dogmatic'' (Chatto and Windus, 1901), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is one of the saints associated with the life and legend of [[Saint Sebastian]].

With his friend [[Saint Tiburtius]], he converted many men and woman to Christianity and brought them to [[Pope Saint Caius]] to be [[baptism|baptized]].&lt;ref name="ACI Prensa - Santos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aciprensa.com/santos/santo.php?id=94 |title=Santos |publisher=ACI Prensa |date=2007-07-29 |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was betrayed by an [[apostate]] named Torquatus and taken before Fabian, prefect of the city.&lt;ref name="ACI Prensa - Santos"/&gt;     

Castulus was tortured and executed by being [[buried alive]] in a [[sand pit]] on the [[Via Labicana]].  According to tradition, Irene subsequently buried the body of the martyred Sebastian.  She was later martyred herself, around 288 AD.

==Veneration of St. Castulus==
A church dedicated to him at [[Rome]], built on the site of his martyrdom, existed from at least the seventh century.

Castulus was venerated in [[Bavaria]] after [[relics]] of his were taken to [[Moosburg]].  Duke [[Heinrich der Löwe]] started the construction of the Kastulus [[Minster (cathedral)]] in 1171.

In 1604, relics were also brought to [[Landshut]].&lt;ref name="heiligenlexikon.de"/&gt;  His relics still rest in Landshut's [[St. Martin's Church (Landshut)|church of St. Martin's]] and Kostel Sv. Haštala (Church of St.Castulus), Prague.

Irene of Rome was the widow of the martyr St. Castulus. After the death of her husband, she continued to be active in the Christian community in Rome. According to legend, when Saint Sebastian was discovered to be a Christian, in 286, he was handed over to the [[Mauretania]]n archers, who tied him to a tree and pierced him with arrows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13668a.htm Löffler, Klemens. "St. Sebastian." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 8 Jan. 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, Irene came to bury the body and found that he was still clinging to life. Irene took him to her lodgings and nursed him back to health. Irene is venerated by Christians for her virtuous care in attending the injured. 

Her feast day is March 30.

Irene tending Sebastian was the subject of paintings by [[Benedetto Luti]] and others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3745">A '''chimera virus''' is defined by the Center for Veterinary Biologics (part of the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture's]] [[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]]) as a "new hybrid microorganism created by joining [[nucleic acid]] fragments from two or more different [[microorganisms]] in which each of at least two of the fragments contain essential [[genes]] necessary for replication."&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/vet_biologics/publications/notice_05_23.pdf Center for Veterinary Biologics Notice No. 05-23.] USDA website. Dec.8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The term ''[[chimera (genetics)|chimera]]'' already referred to an individual [[organism]] whose body contained [[Cell (biology)|cell]] populations from different [[zygotes]] or an [[organism]] that developed from portions of different embryos. In [[mythology]], a [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]] is a creature such as a [[hippogriff]] or a [[griffin|gryphon]] formed from parts of different animals, thus the name for these viruses. Chimeric [[flavivirus]]es have been created in an attempt to make novel live attenuated vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14714441 | volume=61 | title=Chimeric flaviviruses: novel vaccines against dengue fever, tick-borne encephalitis, and Japanese encephalitis | year=2003 | journal=Adv Virus Res | pages=469–509| author1=Lai | first1=C. J | last2=Monath | first2=T. P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As a bioweapon ==
Combining two [[Viral disease|pathogenic viruses]] increases the lethality of the new virus&lt;ref name=collett&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Collett |first1=Marc S. |title=Impact of Synthetic Genomics on the Threat of Bioterrorism with Viral Agents |journal=Working Papers for Synthetic Genomics: Risks and Benefits for Science and Society |date=2006 |pages=83-103}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is why there have been cases where chimeric viruses have been considered for use as a [[Biological agent|bioweapon]]. For example, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet Union's]] Chimera Project attempted to combine [[DNA]] from Venezuelan [[Equus (genus)|equine]] [[encephalitis]], [[smallpox]] and [[Ebola virus]] in the late 1980's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ainscough |first1=Michael J. |title=Next Generation Bioweapons: Genetic Engineering and BW |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A combination [[smallpox]] and [[monkeypox]] virus has also been studied&lt;ref name=collett /&gt;.

== As a medical treatment ==
Studies have shown that chimeric viruses can also be developed to have medical benefits.

&lt;!--This article is in US English--&gt;
The '''Dragons of Pern''' are a [[fiction]]al race created by [[Anne McCaffrey]] as an integral part of the [[science fiction]] world depicted in her [[Dragonriders of Pern]] novels.

In creating the [[Pern]] setting, McCaffrey set out to subvert the clichés associated with [[dragons]] in European [[folklore]] and in modern [[fantasy fiction]]. Pernese dragons are similar to traditional [[European dragons]] in the fact that they can breathe [[fire]] and resemble great lizards or dinosaurs with wings, but the resemblance ends there. Unlike most dragons in previous Western literature, Pernese dragons are entirely friendly to humanity. Furthermore, they are not [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] at all. Instead, they are a heavily [[genetic engineering|genetically modified]] species based on one of Pern's native life-forms, the [[fire-lizard]].

== History ==
In [[Dragonsdawn]], the race was intentionally engineered to fight [[thread (Pern)|Thread]], a deadly [[Mycorrhiza|mycorrhizoid]] [[spore]] that devours all organic matter that it touches, after it first caught the [[human]] colonists on Pern unawares, with devastating results. Geneticist Kitti Ping Yung designed the dragons by manipulating the genetic code of the indigenous [[fire-lizards]] that had been acquired as pets by the colonists. The dragons were named after their resemblance to [[European dragons]] from the legends of old Earth. Later genetic manipulation by Ping's granddaughter, Wind Blossom, also resulted in the [[whers|watch-whers]], ungainly, nocturnal creatures who bore a slight resemblance to dragons. The later novels, set during the Third Pass, have shown the watch-whers are more useful than commonly thought in the novels set in the First Pass. On Pern, time is measured in "Turns", or years, and "Passes", which are about fifty Turns long, and occur when a planet named the "Red Star" is close enough to Pern for Thread to traverse space between the Red Star and Pern. Thread only falls during Passes. Periods between Passes, when the Red Star's orbit takes it away from Pern, are referred to as "Intervals"; usually lasting about two hundred Turns. In the novels, "Long Intervals", of about four hundred and fifty Turns, have occurred twice. These Long Intervals have led the inhabitants of Pern to believe that Thread will never return.

== Physiology ==
Dragons are described as [[carnivorous]], [[oviparous]], [[warm-blooded]] creatures. Like all of Pern's native large fauna, they have six limbs&amp;nbsp;– four feet and two wings. Their blood, referred to as [[ichor]], is [[copper]]-based and green in color. Their head and general body type is described by McCaffrey as being similar in shape to those of [[horses]]. On their heads they have small headknobs, similar to those of [[giraffes]], and no visible ears. They have multifaceted eyes that change color depending on the dragon's mood. Unlike the dragons of Terran legend, they have a smooth hide rather than scales; the texture of their skin is described as being reminiscent of [[suede]] with a spicy, sweet scent when clean. They are described as having forked [[tail]] ends with a [[defecation]] opening between the forks; however, most artistic renderings depict their tails as having [[spade]]-shaped tips. The dragons usually get from one place to another by utilizing a teleportation process known as "going ''[[Between (fictional place)|between]]''".

Kitti Ping designed the dragons to gradually increase in size with each generation until they reached pre-programmed final dimensions. The dragons of the first Hatchings were not much bigger than horses. By the Sixth Pass (1500 years later) they had reached their programmed size and remained at that size until a single isolated dragon population suffered severe inbreeding, resulting in much larger beasts. In the Ninth Pass, in which most of the novels have been set, the largest Pernese dragon on record, [[Ramoth (dragon)|Ramoth]], hatched. According to the novel ''[[All the Weyrs of Pern]]'' these dragons were roughly three times the size of the largest first-generation dragons. Ramoth's great size is often attributed to mutation and the genetic isolation of Benden Weyr for over 400 years (or Turns). Ramoth, at full length, was forty-five meters long.&lt;ref&gt;The Dragon Lovers Guide to Pern pg 39. 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[All the Weyrs of Pern]]'', AIVAS, an artificial intelligence still in operation after all this time, notes that all of the primary Benden dragons, Ramoth, Mnementh and Canth, are notably larger than Kitti Ping's specified end-size of the dragon species. Newly hatched dragons are the size of very large [[dogs]] or small [[pony|ponies]], and reach their full size after eighteen months. Because young dragons grow so fast, their riders must regularly apply oil to their hides to prevent the skin from cracking or drying out.

Dragons, like their fire-lizard ancestors, can breathe fire by chewing a [[phosphine]]-bearing rock, called "firestone" in the novels, which reacts with an acid in a special "second stomach" organ. This forms a volatile gas that can be exhaled at will and ignites upon contact with [[air]]. The flame is used to burn Thread from the sky before it reaches the ground. However, the chewed firestone must be expelled from the body after it is used up, for the dragons cannot digest it.

== Psychic abilities ==
Despite their relatively low [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], fire-lizards communicate through a form of weak [[telepathy]]. They also [[imprinting (psychology)|imprint]] on the first individual who feeds them after they hatch, creating a telepathic bond with them; the Pernese call this phenomenon "[[Impression (Dragonriders of Pern)|Impression]]". In creating dragons, Kitti Ping intensified the creatures' telepathy, greatly increased their intelligence, and gave them a strong [[instinct]]ive drive to Impress to a human. Upon hatching, each dragonet chooses one of the humans present (usually) and Impresses to that person; from that moment on, the pair are in a constant state of telepathic contact for as long as they both live. Dragons also use telepathy to communicate with each other and with fire-lizards. They are capable of speaking telepathically to humans besides their own riders, but not all of them will do so except under unusual circumstances.

Dragons and fire-lizards can also [[Teleportation|teleport]]. They do this by briefly entering a [[hyperspace (science fiction)|hyperspace]] dimension known as ''[[between (fictional place)|between]]''. Both humans and dragons experience ''between'' as an extremely cold, sensory-deprived, black void. After spending no more than eight seconds in ''between'', the dragon or fire-lizard can re-emerge anywhere on Pern, along with any passengers or cargo they carried. This ability is explained as having evolved in fire-lizards as a defense against Thread; not only does it allow them to quickly escape from Threadfall, but the intense cold of ''between'' kills any [[Thread (Pern)|Thread]] that has already burrowed into them. If a dragon attempts to teleport without a clear mental image of the place where they intend to reappear, they may simply fail to emerge from ''between'' and thus, be gone forever.

Going ''between'' allows dragons to travel through [[time travel|time]] as well as space, as long as they have a clear picture of what a particular place looked like (or will look like) at the desired time. However, the practice is highly dangerous to both dragon and rider and is severely restricted. Existing in two places at once for extended periods of time, or in close proximity, causes severe weakness and psychological disturbance for humans but not for dragons, the effects of which are discussed in several novels. In addition, while teleporting through space always takes the same amount of time, when a dragon travels through time, the amount of time they spend in ''between'' increases depending on how far away in time the destination is. Thus, traveling to remote times poses severe dangers from [[hypothermia]] and [[oxygen]] deprivation. In the first Pern novel, [[Dragonflight]], [[Lessa (Dragonrider)|Lessa]] passes out after having travelled back more than four hundred Turns.

''[[The Dragonlover's Guide to Pern]]'' states that dragons defecate while ''between''. This idea originated with a statement by Anne McCaffrey herself, in answer to a fan's question about the subject at a [[fan convention|con]]. However, McCaffrey may have been joking when she first said this. As the idea has never been referenced in any of the Pern novels (in fact, defecation was mentioned only a few times in all of the books ever written in the Pern series), it cannot be considered definitively [[canon (fiction)|canonical]]. It should be noted that ''[[The Skies of Pern]]'' references the use of dragon dung as a repellent against the large felines inhabiting the southern continent.

Dragons are also capable of [[telekinesis]], though this ability is unknown and used in an unconscious manner (to augment flight) until it is discovered as a conscious ability by the green dragon Zaranth and her rider Tai in the Thirty-first Turn of the Ninth Pass. It is speculated that the undersized wings were intentionally created in the dragons by Kitti Ping to reduce the surface area of a dragon that is exposed to possible Thread injury, and that the telekinetic abilities were intended to make up for the loss of wingsail. It is said in many books that a dragon can carry whatever it thinks it can carry. This is likely an extension of the telekinesis, mentally "lifting" the extra load. This is the most likely explanation for the great loads that dragons sometimes carry during emergencies.

== Psychology ==
Unlike their fire-lizard ancestors, dragons are fully [[Sapience|sapient]]. They communicate fluently in human [[language]] (although only telepathically), and have personalities and opinions distinct from those of their riders. However, their intelligence does seem to be somewhat lower than that of the average human. In particular, their long-term [[memory]] is severely limited.

Dragons' telepathic communication is usually limited to contact with their rider and with other dragons, however a dragon sometimes communicates well with a person with whom their rider has close emotional ties. They do understand spoken human language and occasionally reply telepathically to people whom they choose to speak.

As a safeguard against the possible damage that could be caused by such powerful creatures, Ping engineered dragons to be profoundly psychologically dependent on their riders. Any dragonet that fails to Impress to a human shortly after hatching will die. If a dragon's rider dies, the dragon immediately [[suicides]] by going ''between'' without a destination. The only exception is when the rider of a queen dragon dies while the queen is [[gravid]]; the dragon waits just long enough to lay her eggs and see them hatch before disappearing ''between''. (Humans who lose their dragons typically commit suicide as well. However, some do survive, although the experience leaves profound psychological trauma.)

Ping also designed the dragons to be fairly calm in temperament. They never fight one another, unless two queens come into [[estrus]] at the same time. They are also not dangerous to humans except shortly after hatching, when it is common for confused and frightened dragonets to maul or even kill humans hoping to Impress.

When a dragon hatches, they announce their names to their new riders upon Impression. Pernese dragons' names always end in -[[voiceless dental fricative|th]]. A watch-wher's name will end in "sk".

== Colors ==
On [[canon (fiction)|canon]] Pern, barring rare mutations, female dragons and fire-lizards are always either green or gold in color, while males are blue, brown or bronze.

* '''Gold''' dragons, also called '''queens''', are the largest dragons (40–45 feet or meters long)&lt;ref name=Size group=Notes/&gt; and the only fertile females. Gold dragons are by far the rarest dragons on Pern, at just less than one percent of the population. They are dominant over all other colors; any non-gold dragon will invariably obey a queen's orders, even against the wishes of its own rider. Queens are incapable of digesting firestone and producing flame (see below); however, they do fight Thread&amp;nbsp;– they fly in the lowest wing, with their riders armed with specially-designed [[flamethrowers]] to flame any Thread missed by the wings flying above. An egg that is going to hatch a gold dragon is notable: It is gold-colored and larger than other eggs. A gold dragon will always Impress a heterosexual female and are believed by most Weyrfolk to prefer young women who were not raised in the Weyr.
* '''Bronze''' dragons are the largest males (35–45 feet or meters long),&lt;ref name=Size group=Notes/&gt; although they are generally significantly smaller than the queens. Bronzes account for about five percent of all dragons. They are almost always the ones to mate with queens, as the smaller colors generally lack the stamina to chase and catch the gold dragons when they rise to mate. Due to the 5-1 bronze/gold ratio and the infrequency of gold mating flights, they often mate with greens (the losers of a gold flight almost always seek a green for their needs), but their size often puts them at a disadvantage in chasing the agile, smaller females. The senior bronze of a Weyr is determined through which bronze wins the mating flight of the senior gold. In canon Pern, the rider of a bronze dragon is always a [[heterosexual]] male.
* '''Brown''' dragons are the next largest color (30–40 feet or meters long).&lt;ref name=Size group=Notes/&gt; About fifteen percent of all dragons are brown. They may occasionally mate with queens, although this is rare, and becomes even more rare as the dragons increase in size; by Ramoth's time in the Ninth Pass it is unheard of. All brown riders in the Pern novels are men; most are heterosexual, but [[bisexual]] or "masculine" [[homosexual]] brown riders are not rare.
* '''Blue''' dragons are the smallest males (24–30 feet or meters long)&lt;ref name=Size group=Notes/&gt; and make up about a third (thirty percent) of all dragons on Pern. They are nearly as agile as greens, but unlike the greens, they often have enough stamina to last for an entire Threadfall. They mate only with greens, as they are simply too small to keep up with a massive queen over a long mating flight. There are few prominent blue dragons or blue riders in the books. Some assume the position of teaching the new riders after their Impression. Canon blue riders are typically homosexual or bisexual, though some are heterosexual. In interviews, McCaffrey stated that homosexual women may be able to Impress a blue dragon. In the later books written with her son, [[Todd McCaffrey]], blue Tazith is ridden by Xhinna, the first female weyrleader and the first female rider of a blue dragon.
* '''Green''' dragons are the smallest normal color (20–24 feet or meters long),&lt;ref name=Size group=Notes/&gt; and make up about half of all dragons on Pern (fifty percent). They are female, but unlike the queens, they are infertile—due to the chronic use of firestone—and can produce flame. They are extremely valuable in Threadfall because of their agility, but they lack the stamina to last an entire Fall and generally fly in two or three shifts. Originally, greens Impressed only girls; however, after various natural disasters and plagues decimated Pern's population, women were needed to help repopulate the planet. Since going ''between'' during [[pregnancy]] can induce [[miscarriage]] and because removing pregnant riders from the Wings reduced the effectiveness of the Wings, it became impractical to present large numbers of women as candidates for Impression. Thus, green dragons began Impressing homosexual boys; by the time of the end of the Second Pass, female green riders were becoming rare. By the time of [[Moreta]] in the Sixth Pass, female green riders were entirely forgotten, although greens gradually begin Impressing to women again in the Ninth Pass. Females of any sexual orientation may Impress green.
* There is only one '''white''' dragon mentioned anywhere in the Pern novels: [[Ruth (dragon)|Ruth]], whose rider is Lord [[Jaxom]] of [[Ruatha Hold]]. He is not an [[albino]], as his hide contains very faint patches of all the normal dragon colors. Ruth's egg would not have hatched if Jaxom had not forced it open and released the dragonet from a thick membrane sac; thus, it seems likely that white coloration in dragons is normally a lethal [[mutation]]. Although his parents are the largest queen, Ramoth, and largest bronze, Mnementh, in the history of Pern, Ruth is smaller than even a normal green dragon in his time; he is only slightly larger than the largest dragons of the first generation. While his exact length is never specifically mentioned in the books, it does state that he stands higher than a runnerbeast ([[horse]]) at the shoulder, extrapolations suggest that he might be 18 feet or meters long.&lt;ref name=Size group=Notes/&gt; He is male or neuter (undetermined), and assumed sterile, with no urge to mate. Ruth also has the unusual ability to intuitively orient himself in [[time]].

The larger a color is, the less common it is. For instance, there are more blues than browns, and there are more browns than bronzes. Half the dragon population is female, with green dragons being roughly fifty percent of the population and golds being one percent or slightly less.

Riding a larger color of dragon confers higher social status in Pern's extremely hierarchical society, color rankings following the dragons' own strict instinctual hierarchical organization based on fire-lizard structures. Perhaps as a result of this, it is commonly believed that the larger colors are more intelligent, although recent novels imply that this may not be true.

The Pernese believe that chewing firestone makes female dragons sterile; they therefore refuse to allow queens to use it. Greens, on the other hand, are so common that if they produced offspring it would quickly lead to overpopulation. They always chew firestone, and because of their numbers and agility they are vital to any Thread-fighting force. However, ''Dragonsdawn'' suggests that Kitti Ping—possibly motivated by old-fashioned ideas about [[gender roles]]—deliberately engineered greens to be infertile and gold dragons to be incapable of producing flame in order to protect the gold dragons, the only reproductively fertile females, from the dangers of Thread fighting.

== Mating and reproduction ==

=== Mating ===
Both gold and green dragons experience a periodic mating urge. During a Pass a gold dragon will rise roughly once per Turn, and more often at the beginning of a Pass, yet less often towards the end of a Pass. During an Interval a gold dragon may rise to mate only once every four or five Turns. Greens will rise to mate three or four times a Turn, whether this increases or decreases depending on whether or not it is a Pass is unknown. Greens will mate with any male, usually blues or browns. As they are smaller and have less stamina, a green mating flight is much shorter than a gold one.

When a female comes into [[estrus]], interested males compete to catch her in a mating flight. Usually, the female chooses the male who impresses her the most with his skill in the flight, although inexperienced females may be caught before making their choice. The pair actually mate in midair; thus, the higher they get during the flight, the longer their mating can last. The Pernese commonly believe that longer matings result in larger clutches. For this reason, queen riders are strongly encouraged to restrain their dragons from eating heavily just before a flight, instructing them to drink blood instead for a quick burst of energy.

=== Effects on rider sexuality ===
Due to the intense psychic bond between rider and dragon, dragonriders are overcome by the powerful emotions and sensations associated with mating flights. The riders of the mating pair engage in sex themselves, to varying degrees unaware of what they are doing. This contributes to a much looser attitude toward sexuality in general among dragonriders than in the rest of Pernese society.

For much of Pern's history, all green riders were male. During these periods, all green mating flights resulted in [[homosexual]] intercourse between the riders of the dragons involved. This homosexual intercourse is accepted in the Weyr as being separate from the rider's sexual orientation unless the rider has shown otherwise. Mating flight sex between two riders, one of whom is not the other's chosen partner (known as a weyrmate) is not considered to be "cheating". It is understood within the Weyr that sex during mating flights is not optional for the rider. Anne McCaffrey stated that "The dragon decides, the rider complies." Dragons do not usually consider the orientation of their riders when considering what female they wish to chase, or, for a female dragon, what male dragon might catch her. A primary example of this behavior is between Weyrleader T'gellan, Weyrwoman Talina, and green rider Mirrim. T'gellan and Mirrim are weyrmates, but T'gellan's bronze dragon must mate with Weyrwoman Talina's gold dragon at least yearly in order for T'gellan to maintain his position as Weyrleader. Mirrim, known to be an extremely acerbic and temperamental rider, shows no jealousy or other problem with her weyrmate's regular sexual contact with Talina.

=== Effects on non-rider sexuality ===
Both green and gold dragons broadcast their sexual feelings on a wide band during mating flights. Weyrfolk tend to become somewhat inured to this and therefore can hold their sexual reactions until an appropriate place and time. However, flights are usually not over the Weyr itself and sometimes the flight path of the mating flight brings the mating dragons over Holds or Farmholds where the average people occasionally find themselves engaged in unexpected activities. This is especially common among young teens working out in the fields who react to the sudden, unexpected and overwhelming urges with potentially embarrassing results.

Riders of the losing dragons usually seek sexual relief after the intense flight; if they do not have a chosen partner they may seek the comfort of any willing and available partner of their sexual orientation. The weyrfolk tend to happily accommodate these riders, especially if they have been affected by the flight's sexual urgency. This is one of the major reasons for the Weyr's reputation for being sexually very open.

== Fandom considerations ==
Anne McCaffrey has stated in a number of documents and interviews that dragonets use [[pheromones]] to determine the [[sexual orientation]] of the humans to whom they Impress. According to these statements, greens Impress only to women or to "[[effeminate]]" homosexual men. Blues Impress primarily to homosexual or bisexual men with "[[masculinity|masculine]]" temperaments, or possibly to masculine or lesbian women; browns similarly Impress primarily to heterosexual men, but sometimes to bisexual men. Bronzes and golds Impress exclusively to heterosexual men and heterosexual women, respectively.

However, these ideas have never been made explicit in the books (although it is clear, at least, that most male green- and blue riders are homosexual). Many members of online Pern fandom find McCaffrey's ideas about sexuality highly questionable for a number of reasons, both [[science|scientific]] and [[ethics|ethical]]. (Most infamously, she claimed in an interview that science has proven that being the receptive partner in anal sex triggers a hormonal change that will make a previously heterosexual man become homosexual and effeminate. Thus, she argues, even if a male green rider were originally heterosexual, he would not stay that way.) In later interviews McCaffrey claims that green dragons merely pick up on psychological clues from homosexual boys before they themselves know that they are homosexual. "A green Hatchling is unlikely to be impressed (pun intended) by a heterosexual boy." - Anne McCaffrey 1998 on The Kitchen Table BB.

Pern-based roleplaying games thus sometimes ignore McCaffrey's restrictions on who can Impress to a given color of dragon. [[MUDs]] and [[fanzine]]-based clubs often ignore everything except the basic rule that only women Impress gold and only men Impress bronze; [[PBEM]] games are more likely to accept the restrictions on sexual orientation. Most clubs post their policy on canon strictness. While some accept more liberal thoughts on color/gender/sexual orientation matches, many are very strict on this issue.

For the purposes of roleplaying games, McCaffrey has also officially allowed females (masculine lesbians) to ride browns or blues, though she insists that this could never happen on ''her'' (canon) Pern.

Also in fandom, if a rider has strong objections to sex with someone involved in a mating flight or the writer has objections to writing a homosexual encounter or object to their character being involved in a sexual encounter with a person other than their "significant other," they may sequester themselves with a more acceptable partner during the flight. This idea is called "Stand-Ins" and based on a concept McCaffrey introduced in Dragonseye/Red Star Rising, in which a female green rider objects to the idea of a specific bronze rider winning her green's mating flight. However, this concept is not seen in other books and clearly does not exist in the Ninth Pass, as several problems arise regarding green and gold riders who object to the random nature of mating flights and end up [[rape]]d by the male winner of the flight (most notably in Skies of Pern).

== Significance ==
As the primary line of defense against the [[Thread (Pern)|Thread]], dragons are a requirement for the survival and prosperity of humans, not to mention other forms of land life, on Pern. However, the great beasts require a good deal of maintenance, to the degree of requiring a large part of Pernese [[infrastructure]]—especially [[cattle]] farming—to be centered around their upkeep. This has been known to cause resentment among those doing the supporting, especially at times when Thread is not falling.

== Significant Pernese Dragons ==
* [[Ramoth (dragon)|Ramoth]] (gold), ridden by Ninth Pass [[Benden Weyr|Benden]] Weyrwoman [[Lessa (Dragonrider)|Lessa]]. Ramoth is the largest dragon in Pern's history, and together with Lessa rediscovers the lost knowledge that dragons are capable of [[time travel]]. She is described as having a beautiful mental voice in the short story ''The Girl Who Heard Dragons''.
* [[Mnementh]] (bronze), ridden by Ninth Pass Benden Weyrleader [[F'lar]]. Although significantly smaller than Ramoth, Mnementh is the largest bronze in the history of Pern. He is described as having a deep, rich mental voice.
* Canth (brown), ridden by [[F'nor]] of Benden Weyr (F'lar's half-brother) during the Ninth Pass. He and F'nor make the first known attempt by the Pernese to teleport to the surface of another planet. Canth is also unusually large for his color&amp;nbsp;– large enough to rival a small bronze in size&amp;nbsp;– and is the first brown in centuries to attempt participation in a queen's mating flight.
* [[Ruth (dragon)|Ruth]] (white), ridden by Lord [[Jaxom]] of [[Ruatha Hold]], during the Ninth Pass. Ruth is the only known white dragon in Pern's history, and the only dragon to be ridden by a reigning Lord Holder. He has a much higher intelligence compared to that of many other dragons, and always knows ''when'' as well as ''where'' he is in time and space.
* Orlith (gold), ridden by Sixth Pass Fort Weyrwoman [[Moreta]], who is one of the most famous dragonriders of Pernese history. Moreta's deeds are celebrated in the well-known song "The Ballad of Moreta's Ride."
* Faranth (gold), ridden by First Pass Fort Weyrwoman Sorka Hanrahan; Faranth is not the first queen to hatch, mate or lay eggs (she was actually one of the last of her clutch) but she is the first Senior Gold, ridden by the first Weyrwoman. By later Passes, her status is confused with being the first gold in existence. Although Pern has no real religious beliefs, Faranth comes to occupy ambiguous status in later Pernese culture; "by the egg of Faranth" is a common [[oath]].
* Path (green), ridden by Mirrim of Benden Weyr during the Ninth Pass. Path is the first green in several centuries to Impress to a female rider, picking Mirrim when she was not a Candidate.
* Zaranth (green), ridden by Tai of Monaco Bay after the ending of the Ninth Pass. Zaranth is the first Pernese dragon to consciously use telekinesis and communicate this ability to other dragons.
* Golanth (bronze), ridden by F'lessan, son of Lessa and F'lar at the end of the Ninth Pass. F'lessan and Golanth are the first to create a Weyrhold -specifically Honshū Weyrhold- where dragons and their riders can live in smaller groups once Thread no longer falls on Pern, without relying on tithes.

== Notes ==
{{reflist|group=Notes|refs=
&lt;ref name=Size&gt;There is great contention with regard to what measurement system to use for the dragons of Pern. Some sources cite the size in feet; others in meters, without changing the actual numbers. Since 45 meters is the equivalent of 147.63 feet, the difference is not trivial. See:

'''[[Torture]]''' has been used throughout history for the purpose of obtaining information in [[interrogation]]. Torture, while widely illegal and a violation of international law, has been frequently cited as generating false or misleading information, and lacks scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness. The counterargument points to some specific cases{{which|date=September 2018}} where torture has elicited true information.

== Historical Examples of the Use of Torture ==

=== Judicial Use of Torture ===

====17th century====

One early writer on the ineffectiveness of torture was [[Friedrich Spee]] (1591-1635). Spee was a [[Germany|German]] [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, professor, and poet, most noted as an opponent of [[Witch trials|trials for witchcraft]].  Spee was the first person in his time to present strong written and spoken arguments against [[torture]], especially with regards to its unreliability in obtaining "truth" from someone undergoing painful questioning.&lt;ref name="Hellyer"&gt;Friedrich Spee von Langenfeld: ''Cautio Criminalis, or a Book on Witch Trials'' (1631), translated by Marcus Hellyer. University of Virginia Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8139-2182-1}}. The [https://books.google.com/books?id=gp1GMTaUuzwC&amp;printsec=frontcover translator's introduction (pp. vii–xxxvi)] contains many details on Spee's life.&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that subjects would make up stories if it meant the torture would cease.

=== Military Use of Torture ===

====World War II====

After the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropping of the atomic bombs]] on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]] during World War II, the Japanese military tortured a captured American [[P-51]] [[fighter pilot]], Marcus McDilda,  in order to discover how many [[atomic bombs]] the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] had and what the future targets were. McDilda, who knew nothing about the atomic bomb nor the [[Manhattan Project]], "confessed" under torture that the U.S. had 100 atomic bombs and that [[Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto]] were the next targets. McDilda's false confession may have swayed the Japanese leaders' [[Surrender of Japan|decision to surrender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Jerome T. Hagen| title=War in the Pacific, Chapter 25 "The Lie of Marcus McDilda"| publisher= Hawaii Pacific University| year=1996| ISBN=978-0-9653927-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kristof&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/05/opinion/blood-on-our-hands.html |title=Blood On Our Hands? |first=Nicholas |last=Kristof |authorlink=Nicholas Kristof |date=5 August 2003 |accessdate=20 May 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Korean War====
Chinese interrogators tortured U.S. Air Force prisoners of war during the [[Korean War]] with the specific goal of eliciting false confessions.&lt;ref name=china&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/us/02detain.html |title=China Inspired Interrogations at Guantánamo|last1=Shane |first1=Scott |authorlink=Scott Shane |date=July 2, 2008 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=27 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, these false confessions led to allegations that the airmen had been "[[brainwashing|brainwashed]]", so the United States interviewed the former prisoners of war to collect information on the torture techniques employed, publishing their results in 1957.&lt;ref name=Biderman&gt;{{cite journal |title=Communist Attempts to Elicit False Confessions from Air Force Prisoners of War |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1806204/pdf/bullnyacadmed00378-0046.pdf |first=Albert D. |last=Biderman |work=[[Journal of Urban Health|Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine]] |date=September 1957 |volume=33 |issue=9 |pages=616–625 |accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These torture techniques were incorporated into the [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]] (SERE) program to train servicemembers to resist torture.&lt;ref name=china /&gt;

====1992 U.S. Army Field Manual====
[[FM 34-52 Intelligence Interrogation]], the [[United States Army Field Manuals|United States Army field manual]], explains that torture "is a poor technique that yields unreliable results, may damage subsequent collection efforts, and can induce the source to say what he thinks the interrogator wants to hear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=United States Department of the Army |authorlink=United States Department of the Army |title=FM 34-52: Intelligence Interrogation |date=28 September 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is torture ineffective at gathering reliable information, but it also increases the difficulty of gathering information from a source in the future.

====War on Terror and 2003 invasion of Iraq====

Directed by Michael Kirk. [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]. March 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the revelations in 2004 and 2008 that the President [[George W. Bush]] administration [[Torture Memos|authorized the use of torture]] in interrogations, and that United States personnel have used such practices in interrogations related to the [[9/11 attacks]] and [[al-Qaeda]], both at [[black sites]] and at [[Guantánamo Bay detention camp]], discussions on this topic have been heated. In commenting on the use and effectiveness of various torture methods, with a focus on [[waterboarding]], former U.S. [[Director of National Intelligence]], [[Dennis C. Blair]], wrote in 2009 that "high value information came from interrogations in which these methods were used".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/us/politics/23detain.html?_r=0|title=Interrogations' Effectiveness May Prove Elusive|work=[[New York Times]]|date=22 April 2009 |accessdate=2013-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However a Senate Committee that investigated claims of useful information being extracted from suspects that underwent enhanced interrogation concluded that critical and valuable information was not obtained using these methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/jan/26/does-torture-work-and-is-it-worth-the-cost-donald-trump|title=Does torture work – and is it worth the cost?|last=Burke|first=Jason|date=26 January 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5,700-page [[Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture]] also concluded that the CIA repeatedly and deliberately impeded oversight, as well as misrepresenting the effectiveness of torture as an interrogation technique to policymakers and to the public through coordinated [[news leak|leaking]] of false information.&lt;ref name=TheReportItself&gt;{{cite web

Alex Knapp, a staff writer at ''[[Forbes]],'' wrote the following in 2009, "Time and time again, people with actual experience with interrogating terror suspects and actual experience and knowledge about the effectiveness of torture techniques have come out to explain that they are ineffective and that their use threatens national security more than it helps".&lt;ref name="knapp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/an_fbi_interrogator_on_the_effectiveness_of_torture/ |title=An FBI Interrogator on the Effectiveness of Torture |publisher=Outsidethebeltway.com |date=10 September 2009 |accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had written an article about an FBI interrogator, who noted their practice did not include torture; FBI agents had registered strong disapproval of the US military approach.&lt;ref name="knapp"/&gt;

Annette Sisco argues that "the [torture] techniques... are specifically designed to make captives pliable and dependent. They are designed to get prisoners to say whatever you want them to say".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Annette Sisco |url=http://blog.nola.com/guesteditorials/2009/04/how_effective_is_torture_not_v.html |title=How effective is torture?

The book ''Physicians at War: the Dual-Loyalties Challenge'' by Fritz Allhoff explains that "to test the effectiveness of torture researchers would have to ignore the consent of the research subjects".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D2BDGSZ0qJEC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=Effectiveness+of+torture&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=mqXYTtH3EJDSmAWDpY3fCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Effectiveness%20of%20torture&amp;f=false |title=Physicians at war: the dual-loyalties challenge|editor=Fritz Allhoff|via=Google Books |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date= 2008|isbn=9781402069123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''existential crisis''' is a moment at which an individual questions if their life has [[Meaning of life|meaning]], purpose, or value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fAFg7z93gDwC&amp;pg=PA13 |title=Crisis intervention strategies |author=Richard K. James}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be commonly, but not necessarily, tied to depression or inevitably negative speculations on purpose in life (e.g., "if one day I will be forgotten, what is the point of all of my work?"). This issue of the meaning and purpose of human [[existence]] is a major focus of the [[philosophy|philosophical]] tradition of [[existentialism]].

== Description ==
{{Original research|section|date=March 2016}}
An existential crisis may result from, be [[misdiagnosis|misdiagnosed]] as, or be combined with:{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
* [[Major depressive disorder]]
* [[Depersonalization disorder]]
* [[Borderline personality disorder]]
* [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder]]
* [[Alcohol use disorder]]
* Major sleep deprivation
* Prolonged isolation
* Dissatisfaction with one's life
* Major psychological trauma
* Psychedelic drug trip
* The sense of [[solitude|being alone]] and [[social isolation|isolated]] in the world;
* A new-found grasp or appreciation of one's mortality, perhaps following diagnosis of a major health concern such as a terminal illness;
* Believing that one's life has no purpose or [[interpersonal relationship|external]] meaning;
* Searching for the [[meaning of life]];
* Shattering of one's sense of reality, or how the world is;
* An extremely pleasurable or hurtful experience that leaves one seeking meaning;
* Realizing that the [[Universe]] is more complex, mysterious, and larger beyond current human understanding; 

An existential crisis is often provoked by a significant event in the person's life—psychological trauma, marriage, separation, major loss, the death of a loved one, a life-threatening experience, a new love partner, psychoactive drug use, adult children leaving home, reaching a personally significant age (turning 16, turning 40, etc.), etc. Usually, it provokes the sufferer's [[introspection]] about personal mortality, thus revealing the [[psychological repression]] of said awareness.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

An existential crisis may resemble [[anomie]] (a personal condition resulting from a lack of [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]) or a [[midlife crisis]]. An existential crisis may stem from one's new perception of life and existence. Analogously, existentialism posits that a person ''can and does'' define the meaning and purpose of his or her life, and therefore must ''choose'' to resolve the crisis of [[existence]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In existentialist philosophy, the term 'existential crisis' specifically relates to the crisis of the individual when they realize that they must always define their own lives through the choices they make. The existential crisis occurs when one recognizes that even the decision to either refrain from action or withhold assent to a particular choice is, in itself, a choice. In other words, humankind is "condemned" to freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Flynn|first=Thomas|title=Jean-Paul Sartre|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/#Ont|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Handling ==
Existential crisis has often been negatively associated with [[Depression (mood)|depression]].

[[Peter Wessel Zapffe]], a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[philosopher]] and adherent of [[Existential nihilism|nihilism]] and [[antinatalism]], asserted in his book, ''[[The Last Messiah]]'', four ways that he believed all [[self-consciousness|self-conscious]] beings use in order to cope with their apprehension of indifference and absurdity in existence, comprising "anchoring", "isolation", "distraction", and "sublimation":&lt;ref&gt;Zapffe, Peter Wessel, {{cite web | title=The Last Messiah | work=Philosophy Now | url=http://www.philosophynow.org/issue45/45zapffe.htm | accessdate=April 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Anchoring'' is the "fixation of points within, or construction of walls around, the liquid fray of consciousness". The anchoring mechanism provides individuals with a value or an ideal that allows them to focus their attentions in a consistent manner. Zapffe also applied the anchoring principle to society, and stated "God, the Church, the State, morality, fate, the laws of life, the people, the future" are all examples of collective primary anchoring firmaments.
* ''Isolation'' is "a fully arbitrary dismissal from consciousness of all disturbing and destructive thought and feeling".
* ''Distraction'' occurs when "one limits attention to the critical bounds by constantly enthralling it with impressions". Distraction focuses all of one's energy on a task or idea to prevent the mind from turning in on itself.
* ''[[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]]'' is the refocusing of energy away from negative outlets, toward positive ones. Individuals distance themselves and look at their existence from an aesthetic point of view (e.g., writers, poets, painters). Zapffe himself pointed out that his written works were the product of sublimation.

==Cultural contexts==
In the 19th century, [[Kierkegaard]] considered that [[angst]] and existential despair would appear when an inherited or borrowed world-view (often of a collective nature) proved unable to handle unexpected and extreme life-experiences.&lt;ref&gt;S. Kierkegaard, ''The Sickness unto Death'' (1980) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nietzsche]] extended his views to suggest that the [[Death of God]]—the loss of collective faith in religion and traditional morality—created a more widespread existential crisis for the philosophically aware.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Camus, ''The Rebel'' (Vintage 1950[?]) p. 66-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Existential crisis has indeed been seen as the inevitable accompaniment of [[modernism]] ({{Circa}}1890–1945).&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas [[Durkheim]] saw individual crises as the byproduct of social pathology and a (partial) lack of collective norms,&lt;ref&gt;E. Durkeheim, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1952) p. 214 and p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; others have seen existentialism as arising more broadly from the modernist crisis of the loss of meaning throughout the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader (2000) p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Its twin answers were either a religion revivified by the experience of anomie (as with [[Martin Buber]]), or an individualistic existentialism based on facing directly the absurd contingency of human fate within a meaningless and alien universe, as with [[Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus|Camus]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 103-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Irvin Yalom]], an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Stanford University has made fundamental contributions to the field of [[existential psychotherapy]]. [[Rollo May]] is another of the founders of this approach.

[[Fredric Jameson]] has suggested that [[postmodernism]], with its saturation of social space by a visual consumer culture, has replaced the modernist angst of the traditional subject, and with it the existential crisis of old, by a new social pathology of flattened affect and a fragmented subject.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 267-8 and p. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerard Kitchen O'Neill''' (February 6, 1927 – April 27, 1992) was an American [[physicist]] and [[Space advocacy|space activist]]. As a faculty member of [[Princeton University]], he invented a device called the [[Storage ring|particle storage ring]] for high-energy physics experiments.&lt;ref name="physrev-sr" /&gt; Later, he invented a magnetic launcher called the [[mass driver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|pp=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, he developed a plan to build human settlements in outer space, including a [[space habitat]] design known as the [[O'Neill cylinder]]. He founded the [[Space Studies Institute]], an organization devoted to funding research into [[space manufacturing]] and [[Space colonization|colonization]].

O'Neill began researching high-energy [[particle physics]] at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] in 1954, after he received his doctorate from [[Cornell University]]. Two years later, he published his theory for a particle storage ring. This invention allowed [[particle accelerator]]s at much higher energies than had previously been possible. In 1965 at [[Stanford University]], he performed the first colliding beam physics experiment.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"/&gt;

While teaching physics at Princeton, O'Neill became interested in the possibility that humans could survive and live in outer space. He researched and proposed a futuristic idea for human settlement in space, the O'Neill cylinder, in "The Colonization of Space", his first paper on the subject. He held a conference on [[space manufacturing]] at Princeton in 1975. Many who became post-[[Apollo program|Apollo]]-era space activists attended. O'Neill built his first [[Mass Driver 1|mass driver prototype]] with professor [[Henry Kolm]] in 1976. He considered mass drivers critical for extracting the mineral resources of the [[Moon]] and [[asteroid]]s. His award-winning book ''[[The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space]]'' inspired a generation of space exploration advocates. He died of [[leukemia]] in 1992.

==Birth, education, and family life==
O'Neill was born in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]] on February 6, 1927 to Edward Gerard O'Neill, a lawyer, and Dorothy Lewis O'Neill (née Kitchen).&lt;ref name="GaleBio"&gt;[[#GaleBio|"Gerard K. O'Neill" ''Notable Scientists: From 1900 to the Present'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GaleAuth"&gt;[[#GaleAuth|"Gerard K(itchen) O'Neill" ''Contemporary Authors Online'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rein77"&gt;{{harvnb|Rein|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had no siblings. His family moved to [[Speculator, New York]] when his father temporarily retired for health reasons.&lt;ref name="Rein77"/&gt; For high school, O'Neill attended [[Newburgh Free Academy]] in [[Newburgh, New York]]. While he was a student there he edited the school newspaper and took a job as a news broadcaster at a local radio station.&lt;ref name="GaleBio"/&gt; He graduated in 1944, during [[World War II]], and enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] on his 17th birthday.&lt;ref name="GaleBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniels92"&gt;{{harvnb|Daniels|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy trained him as a radar technician, which sparked his interest in science.&lt;ref name="GaleBio"/&gt;

After he was honorably discharged in 1946, O'Neill studied physics and mathematics at [[Swarthmore College]].&lt;ref name="Daniels92"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyson93p97"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child he had discussed the possibilities of humans in space with his parents, and in college he enjoyed working on rocket equations. However, he did not see space science as an option for a career path in physics, choosing instead to pursue high-energy physics.&lt;ref name="Henson77p8"&gt;{{harvnb|Henson|1977|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated with [[Phi Beta Kappa]] honors in 1950. O'Neill performed his graduate studies at [[Cornell University]] with the help of an [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] fellowship, and was awarded a [[Ph.D.]] in physics in 1954.&lt;ref name="Daniels92"/&gt;

O'Neill married Sylvia Turlington, also a Swarthmore graduate, in June 1950.&lt;ref name="GaleBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Turlington50"&gt;[[#Turlington50|"Sylvia Turlington Wed at Her Home" ''New York Times'']]&lt;/ref&gt; They had a son, Roger, and two daughters, Janet and Eleanor, before their marriage ended in divorce in 1966.&lt;ref name="GaleBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rein77"/&gt;

One of O'Neill's favorite activities was flying. He held instrument certifications in both powered and [[Glider (sailplane)|sailplane]] flight and held the [[FAI Gliding Commission|FAI]] Diamond Badge, a gliding award.&lt;ref name="Rein77"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#ONeill77|O'Neill ''The High Frontier'' 1977]], back matter&lt;/ref&gt; During his first cross-country glider flight in April 1973, he was assisted on the ground by Renate "Tasha" Steffen. He had met Tasha, who was 21 years younger than him, previously through the [[YMCA]] International Club. They were married the day after his flight.&lt;ref name="GaleAuth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rein77"/&gt; They had a son, Edward O'Neill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.towntopics.com/may2808/obits.html ''Town Topics'', Princeton local newspaper]&lt;/ref&gt;

==High-energy physics research==
After graduating from Cornell, O'Neill accepted a position as an instructor at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name="Daniels92"/&gt; There he started his research into high-energy [[particle physics]]. In 1956, his second year of teaching, he published a two-page article that theorized that the particles produced by a [[particle accelerator]] could be stored for a few seconds in a [[storage ring]].&lt;ref name="physrev-sr"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=O'Neill |first1=G. |authorlink1=Gerard K. O'Neill |title=Storage-Ring Synchrotron: Device for High-Energy Physics Research |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.102.1418 |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=102 |issue=5 |pages=1418–1419 |year=1956 |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode=1956PhRv..102.1418O |url=http://www.feynman.princeton.edu/mumu/physics/oneill_pr_102_1418_56.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306163409/http://www.feynman.princeton.edu/mumu/physics/oneill_pr_102_1418_56.pdf |archivedate=March 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stored particles could then be directed to collide with another particle beam. This would increase the energy of the particle collision over the previous method, which directed the beam at a fixed target.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas were not immediately accepted by the physics community.&lt;ref name="GaleBio"/&gt;

O'Neill became an assistant professor at Princeton in 1956, and was promoted to associate professor in 1959.&lt;ref name="GaleBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GaleAuth"/&gt; He visited Stanford University in 1957 to meet with Professor [[Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|1997|p=265}} {{quote|O'Neill visited HEPL in 1957 to discuss colliding beams with Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky, then the director of that laboratory, and to seek collaborators.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a collaboration between Princeton and Stanford to build the Colliding Beam Experiment (CBX).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richter|2002}} {{quote|This facility, first proposed by Gerard K. O’Neill of Princeton, and built at the High-Energy Physics Lab by a Princeton-Stanford collaboration, is the grandfather of all electron colliding-beam machines.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a US$800,000 grant from the [[Office of Naval Research]], construction on the first particle storage rings began in 1958 at the Stanford High-Energy Physics Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|1997|p=267}} {{quote|The Office of Naval Research, a very imaginative organization that was then the principal supporter of fundamental research in physics, funded the project to the tune of $800,000, thanks to the persuasive powers of Panofsky.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Richter|2002}} {{quote|The construction of the first serious colliding-beam system began there in 1958 ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; He figured out how to capture the particles and, by pumping the air out to produce a [[vacuum]], store them long enough to experiment on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dyson|1993|pp=97–98}} {{quote|He solved the tough technical problems of injecting a beam from an accelerator into the ring and keeping the betatron oscillations of the particles in the ring small, so that a substantial fraction of the injected particles were stably captured.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#GaleBio|"Gerard K. O'Neill" ''Notable Scientists: From 1900 to the Present'']] {{quote|Finally obtaining financial support in 1959 from the Office of Naval Research and the Atomic Energy Commission, O'Neill and his colleagues built two particle storage rings at Stanford University that used his high-vacuum technique and successfully demonstrated his colliding-beam theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBX stored its first beam on March 28, 1962. O'Neill became a full professor of physics in 1965.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"/&gt;

[[Image:SLAC long view.jpg|thumb|The two-mile-long [[Stanford Linear Accelerator]] tunnel]]

In collaboration with [[Burton Richter]], O'Neill performed the first colliding beam physics experiment in 1965. In this experiment, particle beams from the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator]] were collected in his storage rings and then directed to collide at an energy of 600 [[Electron volt|MeV]]. At the time, this was the highest energy involved in a particle collision. The results proved that the charge of an electron is contained in a volume less than 100 [[Metre#SI prefixed forms of metre|attometers]] across. O'Neill considered his device to be capable of only seconds of storage, but, by creating an even stronger vacuum, others were able to increase this to hours.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"/&gt; In 1979, he, with physicist David C. Cheng, wrote the graduate-level textbook ''Elementary Particle Physics: An Introduction''.&lt;ref name="GaleAuth"/&gt; He retired from teaching in 1985, but remained associated with Princeton as ''professor emeritus'' until his death.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"/&gt;

==Space colonization==
{{Main|Space colonization}}

===Origin of the idea (1969)===
[[Image:S88 33646.jpg|thumb|[[NASA]] envisioned an ambitious scientific exploration of the [[Moon]].]]
O'Neill saw great potential in the United States space program, especially the [[Apollo program|Apollo missions]]. He applied to the Astronaut Corps after NASA opened it up to civilian scientists in 1966. Later, when asked why he wanted to go on the Moon missions, he said, "to be alive now and not take part in it seemed terribly myopic".&lt;ref name="Rein77"/&gt; He was put through NASA's rigorous mental and physical examinations. During this time he met [[Brian O'Leary]], also a scientist-astronaut candidate, who became his good friend.&lt;ref name="ONeill77p243"&gt;[[#ONeill77|O'Neill ''The High Frontier'' 1977]], p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; O'Leary was selected for [[Astronaut Group 6]] but O'Neill was not.&lt;ref&gt;[[#JSCBio|Astronaut Biographies: Former Astronauts]]&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Neill became interested in the idea of space colonization in 1969 while he was teaching freshman physics at Princeton University.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CoEvInt"&gt;{{harvnb|Brand|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; His students were growing cynical about the benefits of science to humanity because of the controversy surrounding the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="ONeill77p233"&gt;[[#ONeill77|O'Neill ''The High Frontier'' 1977]], p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Overend77"&gt;{{harvnb|Overend|1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; To give them something relevant to study, he began using examples from the Apollo program as applications of elementary physics.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rein77"/&gt; O'Neill posed the question during an extra seminar he gave to a few of his students: "Is the surface of a planet really the right place for an expanding technological civilization?"&lt;ref name="CoEvInt"/&gt; His students' research convinced him that the answer was no.&lt;ref name="CoEvInt"/&gt;

[[Image:Bernal Sphere 3.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Bernal sphere]], an "inside-out planet"]]

O'Neill was inspired by the papers written by his students. He began to work out the details of a program to build self-supporting space habitats in free space.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniels92"/&gt; Among the details was how to provide the inhabitants of a space colony with an Earth-like environment. His students had designed giant pressurized structures, spun up to approximate Earth gravity by [[centrifugal force]]. With the population of the colony living on the inner surface of a sphere or cylinder, these structures resembled "inside-out planets". He found that pairing counter-rotating cylinders would eliminate the need to spin them using rockets.&lt;ref name="CoEvInt"/&gt; This configuration has since been known as the ''[[O'Neill cylinder]]''.

===First paper (1970–1974)===
Looking for an outlet for his ideas, O'Neill wrote a paper titled "The Colonization of Space", and for four years attempted to have it published.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brand|1977}} {{quote|O'Neill: So then it went through a period of-let's see, that was 1970, and it was not until four more years that I was able to get an article published.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He submitted it to several journals and magazines, including ''Scientific American'' and ''Science'', only to have it rejected by the reviewers. During this time O'Neill gave lectures on space colonization at [[Hampshire College]], Princeton, and other schools. Many students and staff attending the lectures became enthusiastic about the possibility of living in space.&lt;ref name="CoEvInt"/&gt; Another outlet for O'Neill to explore his ideas was with his children; on walks in the forest they speculated about life in a space colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brand|1977}} {{quote|O'Neill: ... I used to talk about it to my children. I'd take them on walks in the woods, and speculate about what life in a space colony would be like....}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paper finally appeared in the September 1974 issue of ''[[Physics Today]]''. In it, he argued that building space colonies would solve several important problems: {{cquote|It is important to realize the enormous power of the space-colonization technique. If we begin to use it soon enough, and if we employ it wisely, at least five of the most serious problems now facing the world can be solved without recourse to repression: bringing every human being up to a living standard now enjoyed only by the most fortunate; protecting the biosphere from damage caused by transportation and industrial pollution; finding high quality living space for a world population that is doubling every 35 years; finding clean, practical energy sources; preventing overload of Earth's heat balance.|Gerard K. O'Neill|"The Colonization of Space"&lt;ref name="ONeill74"&gt;[[#ONeill74|O'Neill 1974]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Lagrange 2 mass.gif|thumb|right|Diagram of the Lagrange points in the Earth-Moon system]]

He explored the possibilities of flying gliders inside a space colony, finding that the enormous volume could support atmospheric thermals.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ONeill74|O'Neill 1974]] {{cquote|As an enthusiastic glider pilot, I have checked the question of thermal scales: the soaring pilots of the colonial age should find sufficient atmospheric instability to provide them with lift.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He calculated that humanity could expand on this man-made frontier to 20,000 times its population.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ONeill74|O'Neill 1974]] {{quote|the ultimate size limit for the human race on the newly available frontier is at least 20,000 times its present value.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial colonies would be built at the Earth-Moon {{L4}} and {{L5}} [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange points]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#ONeill74|O'Neill 1974]] {{quote|For the first colony it is probably best to choose a particular point on that sphere, within easy range of both Earth and Moon, not so close as to be eclipsed often, and preferably stable against displacements in all three coordinates. The {{L4}} and {{L5}} Lagrange libration points satisfy all these conditions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{L4}} and {{L5}} are stable points in the [[Solar System]] where a spacecraft can maintain its position without expending energy. The paper was well received, but many who would begin work on the project had already been introduced to his ideas before it was even published.&lt;ref name="CoEvInt"/&gt; The paper received a few critical responses. Some questioned the practicality of lifting tens of thousands of people into orbit and his estimates for the production output of initial colonies.&lt;ref name="ONeill77p253"&gt;[[#ONeill77|O'Neill ''The High Frontier'' 1977]], p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was waiting for his paper to be published, O'Neill organized a small two-day conference in May 1974 at Princeton to discuss the possibility of colonizing outer space.&lt;ref name="CoEvInt"/&gt; The conference, titled ''First Conference on Space Colonization'', was funded by [[Stewart Brand|Stewart Brand's]] [[Point Foundation (environment)|Point Foundation]] and Princeton University.&lt;ref name="ONeill77p249"&gt;[[#ONeill77|O'Neill ''The High Frontier'' 1977]], p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; Among those who attended were [[Eric Drexler]] (at the time a freshman at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]), scientist-astronaut [[Joseph P. Allen|Joe Allen]] (from Astronaut Group 6), [[Freeman Dyson]], and science reporter [[Walter S. Sullivan|Walter Sullivan]].&lt;ref name="CoEvInt"/&gt; Representatives from NASA also attended and brought estimates of launch costs expected on the planned [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]].&lt;ref name="CoEvInt"/&gt; O'Neill thought of the attendees as "a band of daring radicals".&lt;ref name="Henson77p10"&gt;{{harvnb|Henson|1977|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan's article on the conference was published on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' on May 13, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sullivan|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; As media coverage grew, O'Neill was inundated with letters from people who were excited about living in space.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ONeill77|O'Neill ''The High Frontier'' 1977]], pp. 250–252&lt;/ref&gt; To stay in touch with them, O'Neill began keeping a mailing list and started sending out updates on his progress.&lt;ref name="CoEvInt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ONeill77p252"&gt;[[#ONeill77|O'Neill ''The High Frontier'' 1977]], p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later he heard [[Peter Glaser]] speak about [[solar power satellite]]s at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. O'Neill realized that, by building these satellites, his space colonies could quickly recover the cost of their construction.&lt;ref name="ONeill77p255"&gt;[[#ONeill77|O'Neill ''The High Frontier'' 1977]], p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; According to O'Neill, "the profound difference between this and everything else done in space is the potential of generating large amounts of new wealth".&lt;ref name="Rein77"/&gt;

===NASA studies (1975–1977)===
O'Neill held a much larger conference the following May titled ''Princeton University Conference on Space Manufacturing''.&lt;ref name="ONeill77p256"&gt;[[#ONeill77|O'Neill ''The High Frontier'' 1977]], p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; At this conference more than two dozen speakers presented papers, including [[Keith Henson|Keith]] and [[Carolyn Meinel|Carolyn Henson]] from [[Tucson, Arizona]].&lt;ref name="Erichsen94"&gt;{{harvnb|Erichsen|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIAA75"&gt;[[#AIAA75|''Space Manufacturing Facilities'' 1977]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the conference Carolyn Henson arranged a meeting between O'Neill and Arizona Congressman [[Mo Udall|Morris Udall]]. Udall wrote a letter of support, which he asked the Hensons to publicize, for O'Neill's work.&lt;ref name="Erichsen94"/&gt; The Hensons included his letter in the first issue of the [[L5 Society|L-5 Society]] newsletter, sent to everyone on O'Neill's mailing list and those who had signed up at the conference.&lt;ref name="Erichsen94"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Udall|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ONeillSenate1976.gif|thumb|left|O'Neill testifying before the Senate Subcommittee on January 19, 1976]]

In June 1975, O'Neill led a ten-week study of permanent space habitats at NASA Ames. During the study he was called away to testify on July 23 to the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] Subcommittee on Space Science and Applications.&lt;ref name="ONeill77p282"&gt;[[#ONeill77|O'Neill ''The High Frontier'' 1977]], p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; On January 19, 1976, he also appeared before the [[United States Senate|Senate]] Subcommittee on Aerospace Technology and National Needs. In a presentation titled ''Solar Power from Satellites'', he laid out his case for an Apollo-style program for building power plants in space.&lt;ref name="ONeill77p264"&gt;[[#ONeill77|O'Neill ''The High Frontier'' 1977]], p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Ames in June 1976 and 1977 to lead studies on space manufacturing.&lt;ref name="SSIHistory"&gt;[[#SSIHistory|''SSI History'']]&lt;/ref&gt; In these studies, NASA developed detailed plans to establish bases on the Moon where space-suited workers would mine the mineral resources needed to build space colonies and solar power satellites.&lt;ref name="ONeillAmes77"&gt;[[#ONeillAmes77|O'Neill ''Summer Study Notes'' 1977]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private funding (1977–1978)===
Although NASA was supporting his work with grants of up to $500,000 per year, O'Neill became frustrated by the bureaucracy and politics inherent in government-funded research.&lt;ref name="GaleBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Overend77"/&gt; He thought that small privately funded groups could develop space technology faster than government agencies.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"/&gt; In 1977, O'Neill and his wife Tasha founded the [[Space Studies Institute]], a non-profit organization, at Princeton University.&lt;ref name="Daniels92"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#GaleBio|"Gerard K. O'Neill" ''Notable Scientists: From 1900 to the Present'']] {{quote|Therefore, in 1977, he sought and obtained private support for a new, non-profit corporation called the Space Studies Institute. Located at Princeton University, the Space Studies Institute supports technical research on the science and engineering of living and working in space with grants made possible by members' contributions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSI received initial funding of almost $100,000 from private donors, and in early 1978 began to support basic research into technologies needed for space manufacturing and settlement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SSIHistory|''SSI History'']] {{quote|At the end of the year and with legal matters attended to, SSI was given a strong head-start by two gifts from private donors, totaling nearly $100,000.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ONEILLMASS.GIF|thumb|right|[[Henry Kolm|Kolm]] (left) and O'Neill (center) with [[mass driver]]]]
One of [[Space Studies Institute|SSI's]] first grants funded the development of the [[mass driver]], a device first proposed by O'Neill in 1974.&lt;ref name="AboutSSI"&gt;[[#AboutSSI|''About SSI'']]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kolm|1992|p=123}} {{quote|An offshoot of this maglev research resulted in the concept of the mass driver by Professor Gerard K.

He took a sabbatical from Princeton to work on mass drivers at MIT. There he served as the [[Jerome C. Hunsaker Visiting Professor of Aerospace Systems|Hunsaker Visiting Professor of Aerospace]] during the 1976–77 academic year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kolm|1992|p=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; At MIT, he, [[Henry Kolm|Henry H. Kolm]], and a group of student volunteers built their [[Mass Driver 1|first mass driver prototype]].&lt;ref name="Henson77p10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SSIHistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AboutSSI"/&gt; The eight-foot (2.5&amp;nbsp;m) long prototype could apply 33&amp;nbsp;''[[g-force|g]]'' (320&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of acceleration to an object inserted into it.&lt;ref name="Henson77p10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SSIHistory"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weintraub84p304"/&gt; With financial assistance from SSI, later prototypes improved this to 1,800&amp;nbsp;''g'' (18,000&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), enough acceleration that a mass driver only 520 feet (160&amp;nbsp;m) long could launch material off the surface of the Moon.&lt;ref name="SSIHistory"/&gt;

===Opposition (1977–1985)===
In 1977, O'Neill saw the peak of interest in space colonization, along with the publication of his first book, ''[[The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space|The High Frontier]]''.&lt;ref name="Erichsen94"/&gt; He and his wife were flying between meetings, interviews, and hearings.&lt;ref name="Rein77"/&gt; On October 9, the [[CBS]] program ''[[60 Minutes]]'' ran a segment about space colonies. Later they aired responses from the viewers, which included one from Senator [[William Proxmire]], chairman of the Senate Subcommittee responsible for NASA's budget. His response was, "it's the best argument yet for chopping NASA's funding to the bone .... I say not a penny for this nutty fantasy".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lovell|1977}} {{quote|"It's the best argument yet for chopping NASA's funding to the bone. As Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee responsible for NASA's appropriations, I say not a penny for this nutty fantasy..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; He successfully eliminated spending on space colonization research from the budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Proxmire|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, [[Paul Werbos]] wrote for the L-5 newsletter, "no one expects Congress to commit us to O'Neill's concept of large-scale space habitats; people in NASA are almost paranoid about the public relations aspects of the idea".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Werbos|1978|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it became clear that a government-funded colonization effort was politically impossible, popular support for O'Neill's ideas started to evaporate.&lt;ref name="Erichsen94"/&gt;

Other pressures on O'Neill's colonization plan were the high cost of access to Earth orbit and the declining cost of energy. Building solar power stations in space was economically attractive when energy prices spiked during the [[1979 energy crisis|1979 oil crisis]]. When prices dropped in the early 1980s, funding for space solar power research dried up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; His plan had also been based on NASA's estimates for the flight rate and launch cost of the Space Shuttle, numbers that turned out to have been wildly optimistic. His 1977 book quoted a Space Shuttle launch cost of $10 million, but in 1981 the subsidized price given to commercial customers started at $38 million.&lt;ref name="ONeill77p134"&gt;[[#ONeill77|O'Neill ''The High Frontier'' 1977]], p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanushek|1985|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1985 accounting of the full cost of a launch in 1985 raised this as high as $180 million per flight,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanushek|1985|p=6}} (in 1982 dollars)&lt;/ref&gt; and later estimates as the Space Shuttle program neared its end in 2011 were much higher yet.

O'Neill was appointed by United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] to the National Commission on Space in 1985.&lt;ref name="Daniels92"/&gt; The commission, led by former NASA administrator [[Thomas O. Paine|Thomas Paine]], proposed that the government commit to opening the inner Solar System for human settlement within 50 years.&lt;ref name="Paine86"&gt;{{harvnb|Paine|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their report was released in May 1986, four months after the [[Space Shuttle Challenger]] broke up on ascent.&lt;ref name="Paine86"/&gt;

==Writing career==
[[Image:Spacecolony1.jpg|thumb|right|O'Neill cylinders as illustrated in [[The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space|''The High Frontier'']]]]

O'Neill's popular science book ''[[The High Frontier: Human Colonies in Space]]'' (1977) combined fictional accounts of space settlers with an explanation of his plan to build space colonies. Its publication established him as the spokesman for the space colonization movement.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"/&gt; It won the [[Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science]] that year, and prompted Swarthmore College to grant him an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]].&lt;ref name="GaleAuth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PBKAwards"&gt;[[#PBKAwards|''Phi Beta Kappa Award in Science Winners'']]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The High Frontier'' has been translated into five languages and remained in print as of 2008.&lt;ref name="SSIHistory"/&gt;

His 1981 book ''[[2081: A Hopeful View of the Human Future]]'' was an exercise in [[futures studies|futurology]]. O'Neill narrated it as a visitor to Earth from a space colony beyond Pluto.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferris|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book explored the effects of technologies he called "drivers of change" on the coming century. Some technologies he described were space colonies, solar power satellites, [[anti-aging]] drugs, [[Hydrogen vehicle|hydrogen-propelled cars]], climate control, and underground [[Maglev train|magnetic trains]]. He left the social structure of the 1980s intact, assuming that humanity would remain unchanged even as it expanded into the Solar System. Reviews of ''2081'' were mixed. ''New York Times'' reviewer John Noble Wilford found the book "imagination-stirring", but [[Charles Nicol]] thought the technologies described were unacceptably far-fetched.&lt;ref name="GaleAuth"/&gt;

In his book ''The Technology Edge'', published in 1983, O'Neill wrote about economic competition with Japan.&lt;ref name="Weil84"&gt;{{harvnb|Weil|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that the United States had to develop six industries to compete: [[Microfabrication|microengineering]], robotics, genetic engineering, [[Magnetic levitation|magnetic flight]], [[Flying car (fiction)|family aircraft]], and space science.&lt;ref name="COMPUTE"&gt;{{harvnb|Bateman|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also thought that industrial development was suffering from short-sighted executives, self-interested unions, high taxes, and poor education of Americans. According to reviewer Henry Weil, O'Neill's detailed explanations of emerging technologies differentiated the book from others on the subject.&lt;ref name="Weil84"/&gt;

==Entrepreneurial efforts==
[[Image:RDSS Diagram.png|thumb|Design for the satellite position determination system]]

O'Neill founded Geostar Corporation to develop a satellite position determination system for which he was granted a patent in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[[#GaleBio|"Gerard K. O'Neill" ''Notable Scientists: From 1900 to the Present'']] {{quote|In 1983, he founded the Geostar Corporation which, based on O'Neill's own patent, developed the first private satellite navigational system to guide travel on earth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system, primarily intended to track aircraft, was called Radio Determination Satellite Service (RDSS).&lt;ref name="COMPUTE"/&gt; In April 1983 Geostar applied to the FCC for a license to broadcast from three satellites, which would cover the entire United States. Geostar launched GSTAR-2 into [[geosynchronous orbit]] in 1986. Its [[transmitter]] package permanently failed two months later, so Geostar began tests of RDSS by transmitting from other satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martin|2000|pp=263–264}} {{quote|In 1987 ... the Geostar Corporation began providing limited one-way position determination service (Geostar System 1.0) from mobile subscribers, primarily in the long-distance trucking industry, using the French Argos transponders on U.S. meteorological satellites.}} {{quote|The second was on GStar 2, launched in 1986; the subsystem operated properly in initial testing but failed less than two months after launch.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his health failing, O'Neill became less involved with the company at the same time it started to run into trouble.&lt;ref name="SmitGeo"&gt;[[#SmitGeo|''Geostar Corporation Records 1983–1991'']]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1991 Geostar filed for bankruptcy and its licenses were sold to [[Motorola]] for the [[Iridium satellite constellation]] project.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sat91|''Satellite News'' 1991]] {{quote|Satellite News has learned that Iridium Inc., a Motorola affiliate, and Comsat Corp. have purchased the assets of ill-fated, Washington, D.C.-based Geostar Corp. at a bankruptcy auction proceeding late last week.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the system was eventually replaced by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]], O'Neill made significant advances in the field of position determination.&lt;ref name="SmitGeo"/&gt;

O'Neill founded O'Neill Communications in Princeton in 1986. He introduced his Local Area Wireless Networking, or LAWN, system at the PC Expo in New York in 1989.&lt;ref name="PCExLAWN"&gt;{{harvnb|Sexton|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LAWN system allowed two computers to exchange messages over a range of a couple hundred feet at a cost of about $500 per node.&lt;ref name="PerCompLAWN"&gt;{{harvnb|Honan|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Neill Communications went out of business in 1993; the LAWN technology was sold to Omnispread Communications. As of 2008, Omnispread continued to sell a variant of O'Neill's LAWN system.&lt;ref name="Keystone06p4"&gt;[[#Keystone06|Keystone press release 2006]], p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 1991, O'Neill filed a patent application for a [[vactrain]] system.&lt;ref name="VacTrainPatent"&gt;{{cite web|title=Patent US5433155: High speed transport system|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US5433155|website=Google Patents|publisher=Google|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the company he wanted to form ''VSE International'', for velocity, silence, and efficiency.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"/&gt;  However, the concept itself he called ''[[Magnetic Flight]]''.  The vehicles, instead of running on a pair of tracks, would be elevated using electromagnetic force by a single track within a tube (permanent magnets in the track, with variable magnets on the vehicle), and propelled by electromagnetic forces through tunnels. He estimated the trains could reach speeds of up to 2,500&amp;nbsp;mph (4,000&amp;nbsp;km/h) — about five times faster than a jet airliner — if the air was evacuated from the tunnels.&lt;ref name="Daniels92"/&gt; To obtain such speeds, the vehicle would accelerate for the first half of the trip, and then decelerate for the second half of the trip. The acceleration was planned to be a maximum of about one-half of the force of gravity. O'Neill planned to build a network of stations connected by these tunnels, but he died two years before his first patent on it was granted.&lt;ref name="Dyson93p98"/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[Image:Pegasus Air Launch.jpg|thumb|O'Neill's ashes were carried on the upper stage of an [[Pegasus (rocket)|Orbital Sciences Pegasus]]]]

O'Neill was diagnosed with [[leukemia]] in 1985.&lt;ref name="SmitGeo"/&gt; He died on April 27, 1992, from complications of the disease at the [[Sequoia Hospital]] in [[Redwood City, California]].&lt;!-- Here he's back in Redwood City, next door to Stanford, yet he remained affiliated with Princeton ... confused if he moved to Stanford duirng his career or what ?  --&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniels92"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dyson93p97"/&gt; He was survived by his wife Tasha, his ex-wife Sylvia, and his four children.&lt;ref name="Daniels92"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roger08|"O'Neill, Dr. Roger A." 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; A sample of his incinerated remains was [[Space burial|buried in space]].&lt;ref name="Simons97"&gt;{{harvnb|Simons|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vial containing his ashes was attached to a [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus XL]] rocket and launched into Earth orbit on April 21, 1997.&lt;ref name="Simons97"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#FAA1997|''Quarterly Launch Report'' 3Q 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt; It re-entered the atmosphere in May 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Debris02|"Pegasus HAPS Rocket Body Reentry Prediction" 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Neill directed his Space Studies Institute to continue their efforts "until people are living and working in space".&lt;ref&gt;[[#SSIHistory|''SSI History'']] {{quote|At the last board meeting that he attended, one month before he succumbed to a seven-year bout with leukemia, Dr. Gerard O'Neill firmly stated, "Our mission is not complete until people are living and working in space."}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, management of SSI was passed to his son Roger and colleague Freeman Dyson.&lt;ref name="SSIHistory"/&gt; SSI continued to hold conferences every other year to bring together scientists studying space colonization until 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoyt|2006|p=20}} {{quote|The conference was held again at Princeton the following year in cooperation with the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]], and took place every other year from 1975 to 2001.}}&lt;/ref&gt; then irregularly thereafter.

[[Henry Kolm]] went on to start Magplane Technology in the 1990s to develop the magnetic transportation technology that O'Neill had written about. In 2007, Magplane demonstrated a working magnetic pipeline system to transport phosphate ore in Florida. The system ran at a speed of 40&amp;nbsp;mph (65&amp;nbsp;km/h), far slower than the high-speed trains O'Neill envisioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dickson|2007}} {{quote|The Magplane Pipeline Technology was demonstrated in Florida at IMC Global Inc., which has merged with Cargill Crop Nutrition to form The Mosaic Company [NOS-NY]—the world's leading producer of potash and phosphate crop nutrients. In the demonstration, phosphate ore was successfully transported at speeds up to 65 kilometers/hour using the pipeline system that utilized rare earth (neodymium-iron-boron) permanent magnets on the capsules over a 275-metre long pipeline containing a linear synchronous motor winding.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#MTIPrincipals|''MTI Principals'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

All three of the founders of the [[Space Frontier Foundation]], an organization dedicated to opening the space frontier to human settlement, were supporters of O'Neill's ideas and had worked with him in various capacities at the Space Studies Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tumlinson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of them, [[Rick Tumlinson]], describes three men as models for space advocacy: [[Wernher von Braun]], Gerard K. O'Neill, and [[Carl Sagan]]. Von Braun pushed for "projects that ordinary people can be proud of but not participate in".&lt;ref name="Grierson04"&gt;{{harvnb|Grierson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan wanted to explore the universe from a distance. O'Neill, with his grand scheme for settlement of the Solar System, emphasized moving ordinary people off the Earth "en masse".&lt;ref name="Grierson04"/&gt;

The [[National Space Society]] (NSS) gives the Gerard K. O'Neill Memorial Award for Space Settlement Advocacy to individuals noted for their contributions in the area of space settlement. Their contributions can be scientific, legislative, and educational. The award is a trophy cast in the shape of a [[Bernal sphere]]. The NSS first bestowed the award in 2007 on lunar entrepreneur and former astronaut [[Harrison Schmitt]]. In 2008, it was given to physicist [[John Marburger]].&lt;ref name="NSSAward"&gt;[[#NSSAward|NSS Gerard K. O'Neill Memorial Award]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In fiction, the protagonist of [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]]'s ''[[Manifold: Time]]'' names his spaceship the ''Gerard K. O'Neill.''

As of November, 2013, Gerard O'Neill's papers and work are now located in the archives at the [[Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum]], [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]].

'''HMS ''Foxhound''''' was an 18-gun {{sclass-|Cruizer|brig-sloop}} built by King at Dover and launched in 1806. She participated in the [[battle of the Basque Roads]] in early 1809 and foundered later that year.

==Service==
Commander Pitt Burnaby Greene, late commander of the [[Hired armed vessels|hired armed]] [[brig]] {{HMS|Cockatrice|1781|2}},  commissioned ''Foxhound'' in May 1807.&lt;ref&gt;''The Gentleman's Magazine'' Vol. 163. p.89.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 August ''Foxhound'' captured the Danish vessel ''Adetheid Margaretha''.&lt;ref name=LG16498/&gt; Two days later she captured the Danish vessels ''Gimlé'' and ''De Gode''.&lt;ref name=LG16498&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16498|page=1158|date=22 June 1811}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 June 1808 ''Foxhound'' captured the French [[chasse maree]] ''Susanne''. Then on 11 January 1809 ''Foxhound'' recaptured the Hamburg ship ''Vierininguen''.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16253|page=629|date=2 May 1809}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 March 1809, ''Foxhound'' joined Admiral Lord [[James Gambier, 1st Baron Gambier|Gambier's ]]  Channel fleet anchored off the Basque Roads. The British plan was to use the 60 vessels (of all kinds) to attack the French fleet lying within. The 15 French vessels there, commanded by Vice-Admiral [[Zacharie Allemand]], lay behind a boom protected by 30 guns. 

During this time ''Foxhound'' participated in the capture of two vessels, the Danish ship ''Neptunus'' on 24 March and the French ship ''Nymphe'' on 28 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16362|page=584 |date=17 April 1810}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the capture of ''Neptunus'', ''Foxhound'' was in company with {{HMS|Indefatigable|1784|2}} and the sloop {{HMS|Goldfinch|1808|2}}.&lt;ref name=LG16308&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16308|page=1674|date=21 October 1809}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Foxhound'' was also in company with ''Indefatigable'' for the capture of ''Nymphe''.&lt;ref name=LG16308/&gt;

On 11 April, two explosion ships, twelve [[fire ship]]s, accompanied by bomb vessels and escorted by men-of-war, some 27 vessels in all, under the command of Captain [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord  Cochrane]], broke the boom under a heavy fire. ''Foxhound'' covered the [[bomb vessel]] {{HMS|Aetna|1803|2}} near the [[Île-d'Aix]], which was making a diversionary attack. The British main attack captured two French vessels and two were blown up, all with a total loss to the British of only eight men killed and 24 wounded. Still, Cochrane was highly critical of Gambier's failure to act more aggressively. (Gambier had earlier objected to the plan to use explosion (Cochrane's invention) and fire ships, calling it "a horrible and anti-Christian mode of warfare".)

Two of ''Foxhound''{{'}}s sister ships, {{HMS|Doterel|1808|2}} and {{HMS|Beagle|1804|2}} were also present at the Basque Roads. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the then-surviving participants in the battle the Naval General Service Medal with the clasp "Basque Roads 1809".&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=20939|page=243|date=26 January 1849}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 1809, ''Foxhound'' sailed for Quebec with a convoy.&lt;ref name="NMM-WH-367137"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/pdf/Warship_Histories_Vessels_i.pdf|title=NMM, vessel ID 367137|work=Warship Histories, vol i|publisher=[[National Maritime Museum]]|accessdate=30 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20110802041558/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/upload/pdf/Warship_Histories_Vessels_i.pdf|archivedate=2 August 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fate== 

While under the command of Commander James MacKenzie, ''Foxhound'' was returning from [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] when she foundered in the Atlantic with the loss of all on board.&lt;ref&gt;Hepper (1994), p.130.&lt;/ref&gt; The loss occurred in August, and perhaps on 31 August 1809.&lt;ref&gt;Gossett (1986), p.72.&lt;/ref&gt; The vessels in company were unable to render any assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Grocott (1997), p.283.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7673">'''Hedda Nussbaum''' (born August 8, 1942) is an American woman who was caretaker for a six-year-old girl who died of [[physical abuse]] in 1987. The death of the girl, Lisa Steinberg, sparked a lengthy and controversial trial and media frenzy.  The legal case was one of the first to be televised "[[gavel]] to gavel."&lt;ref&gt;Fergeson, Robert A. 2008. The Trial in American Life. University of Chicago Press, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters characterized Nussbaum as a victim of horrific [[domestic abuse]] at the hands of her live-in partner, [[Joel Steinberg]]. Critics suggested she was a consensual partner in a [[sado-masochistic]] relationship and an unprosecuted [[conspiracy (criminal)|co-conspirator]] in the young girl's death.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Before meeting [[Joel Steinberg]] in 1975, Nussbaum had been an editor and author of children's books at [[Random House]] publishers, and before that at Appleton Century Crofts. Steinberg was a defense attorney who sometimes handled [[adoption]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0306/16/lkl.00.html |contribution= Interview With Hedda Nussbaum |title= [[Larry King Live]] |date= June 16, 2003 |publisher= [[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1976, Nussbaum and Steinberg lived together in a [[brownstone]] apartment in [[New York City]]'s [[Greenwich Village]]. Her 1977 book, ''Plants Do Amazing Things'', was dedicated, in part, "to Joel, my everyday inspiration."&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Hedda. Plants Do Amazing Things.  New York, NY: Random House, Inc, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Nussbaum's occasionally obvious bruises and other injuries, friends and colleagues suspected that Nussbaum was the victim of [[domestic violence]]. Neighbors later stated to police they believed that Nussbaum and Steinberg were active participants in a "some kind of a sexual sadomasochistic game."&lt;ref&gt;Raoul Lionel Felder, Barbara Victor. Getting Away With Murder: weapons for the war against domestic violence. Simon and Schuster, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Friends occasionally offered to help if Nussbaum was being abused, but she declined their offers of intervention or aid and refused to implicate Steinberg. After extended absences from work, Random House put Nussbaum on consulting editor status in 1982.

In 1981, under dubious legal circumstances, Nussbaum and Steinberg took custody of an infant girl they named Lisa. The girl's birth mother had paid Steinberg a $500.00 legal fee to place the child with a [[Roman Catholic]] family; both Steinberg and Nussbaum were [[Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;Skaine, Rosemary. 2003. Paternity and American law. McFarland, {{ISBN|0-7864-1411-1}}, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Under similar circumstances, Nussbaum and Steinberg later took in a toddler they named Mitchell. Nussbaum and Steinberg never legally adopted either child.

In her 2005 book ''Surviving Intimate Terrorism'', Nussbaum argued that her [[denial]] of the danger she and her children lived in was typical of some chronically maltreated persons (see [[battered person syndrome]]). Nussbaum claimed that she fled from the home six times, only to later return. In her 2005 book, Nussbaum also mentions the medical theory that trauma, especially prolonged trauma, can elicit the body's production of opioids that produce mental and physical numbness. In her 2005 book, Nussbaum also suggests that her "numbness" further reduced her ability to think and act clearly, akin to "[[Stockholm Syndrome]]", a mental state wherein victims identify with their abusers.

===Lisa's death and subsequent trial===
According to initial police reports, on November 1, 1987 around 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Steinberg rendered Lisa unconscious with a severe blow to the head. Nussbaum remained alone with the dying child for roughly ten hours, failing to notify police or medical personnel. Steinberg departed and returned several times, sometimes [[freebasing]] [[cocaine]]. According to initial police reports, Nussbaum didn't notify authorities because she believed Steinberg had [[supernatural]] healing powers.&lt;ref name="Skaine, p. 87"&gt;Skaine, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; At roughly 6.00 a.m. the next morning, Lisa stopped breathing. Shortly thereafter, Steinberg telephoned [[9-1-1|911]] at Nussbaum's urging.

After Lisa's death, Mitchell was discovered in squalid conditions. The child's birth mother, Nicole Smiegel, had waived her parental rights. However, since a legal adoption had never occurred, Smiegel was ultimately granted custody of her son.

When authorities learned of Lisa's death, they initially charged both Nussbaum and Steinberg with complicity. In the course of the investigation, however, charges were later dropped against Nussbaum. She agreed to testify against Steinberg, and medical examination revealed that Nussbaum was [[anemia|anemic]], [[malnourished]], and suffering from broken bones and chronic infections. With these findings, authorities determined that Nussbaum was physically incapable of seriously wounding Lisa.

Nussbaum's courtroom testimony against Steinberg earned substantial [[mass media|media]] attention, due in part to her face showing obvious evidence of physical trauma. There were also indications, as Nussbaum testified in court, that Lisa had been sexually abused by people outside of her immediate family. During the trial, medical experts testified that while Lisa's injuries were severe, she would have almost certainly survived if given prompt medical treatment.&lt;ref name="Skaine, p. 87"/&gt;

Steinberg was convicted on charges of first-degree [[manslaughter]]. After serving 16 years at the [[Southport Correctional Facility]] in Pine City, New York, where he was held in [[protective custody]], Steinberg was released on parole in 2004 and got a job in construction.

===Later life===
In the years following Lisa's death, Nussbaum worked to rebuild her life and had numerous reconstructive plastic surgeries. She also co-facilitated a support group for battered women for about eight years and later worked as a [[paralegal]] for an organization that assists battered women. In 1995, Nussbaum began giving lectures about abuse at colleges and shelters.  When Steinberg was released from prison, however, she receded from public attention until the publication of her book a year and a half later.

==Analyses==
The Nussbaum case polarized [[feminist]] scholars and activists. Some saw Nussbaum as an [[archetypal]] victim of [[domestic violence]] whose actions were controlled and restricted not only by her abusive partner, but also by the culture at large that denies the seriousness of abuse in the home. Other leading feminists—notably [[Susan Brownmiller]]—suggested that while Nussbaum suffered violence from her partner, she also have shared full culpability for Lisa's death.&lt;ref&gt;Weisberg, D. Kelly. 1996. Applications of feminist legal theory to women's lives: sex, violence, work, and reproduction. Temple University Press, {{ISBN|1-56639-424-4}}, p. 919&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Helena Sophia Ekblom''', known as ''Predikare-Lena'' (Preacher-Lena) and ''Vita jungfrun'' (The White Maiden), (24 June 1790 &amp;ndash; 1859) was a Swedish writer and preacher.&lt;ref name="van"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edu.vanersborg.se/Bsgweb/kvinnoboken/2005/Predikarlena.htm |title=Helena Sofia Ekblom |last=Hallberg |first=Johanna |publisher=Vanersborg School |language=Swedish |accessdate=18 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413141907/http://www.edu.vanersborg.se/Bsgweb/kvinnoboken/2005/Predikarlena.htm |archivedate=13 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, Jerry. "Lena Ekblom: the folly of the Beatitudes." ''[[CrossCurrents|Cross Currents]]'' Spring 1998: 89+ (7 pages). Vol.48, Issue 1. GALE|A20627195. Retrieved 19 October 2012. Abstract: "Helena Jakobsdotter Ekblom preached with all simplicity and truthfulness and, as expected, was punished for it. She spread the virtues of being poor and meek, which was the very essence of Christ's Beatitudes, and how the kingdom of God would reward them with a fruitful life in the hereafter. The authorities at that time, however, denounced her preachings as subversive because her messages conveyed the implication that the rich and the powerful are bound to suffer and be punished."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and career ==
Helena Ekblom was born in [[Östergötland]]. Her father worked as a sailor. At the age of nine, she claimed to have had a religious revelation. In 1806, she began her activity as a travelling preacher. As she was always dressed in white during her sermons, she was called The White Maiden. In 1808, she was placed in the [[Vadstena]] mental asylum. During her stay at the institution, she wrote a book about her revelations, which was published in several editions until 1920.

In 1828, she was released from the asylum and continued her activity as a travelling preacher. She was eventually housed by a farmer. During her old age, she became confused. She died by freezing to death in the snow during winter.

[[File:Ian Fleming.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Ian Fleming]]

'''Ian Lancaster Fleming''' (28 May 1908&amp;nbsp;– 12 August 1964) was an English author, journalist, and naval intelligence officer who is best known for his [[James Bond]] series of spy novels. Fleming came from a wealthy family connected to the merchant bank [[Robert Fleming &amp; Co.]], and his father was the Member of Parliament for [[Henley (UK Parliament constituency)|Henley]] from 1910 until his death on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1917. He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Sandhurst]], and the universities of [[Munich University|Munich]] and [[University of Geneva|Geneva]], and he moved through several jobs before he started writing.

Fleming worked for Britain's [[Naval Intelligence Division]] during the Second World War and was involved in planning [[Operation Goldeneye]] and in the planning and oversight of the [[30 Assault Unit]] and [[T-Force]] intelligence units. His wartime service and his career as a journalist provided much of the background, detail, and depth of the James Bond novels.

Fleming wrote his first Bond novel ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' in 1952. It was a success, with three print runs being commissioned to cope with the demand. Eleven Bond novels and two collections of short stories followed between 1953 and 1966. The novels revolved around James Bond, an officer in the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] commonly known as MI6. Bond was also known by his code number 007, and was a commander in the Royal Naval Reserve. The Bond stories rank among the best-selling series of fictional books of all time, having sold more than 100 million copies worldwide. Fleming also wrote the children's story ''[[Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang]]'' and two works of non-fiction. In 2008, ''[[The Times]]'' ranked Fleming 14th on its list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945".

Fleming was married to [[Ann Fleming|Ann Charteris]], who was divorced from the second [[Esmond Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere|Viscount Rothermere]] because of her affair with Fleming. The couple had a son named Caspar. Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker for most of his life and succumbed to heart disease in 1964 at age 56. Two of his James Bond books were published posthumously. Fleming's creation has appeared in film 26 times, portrayed by seven actors.

In 1914, with the start of the First World War, [[Valentine Fleming]] joined [[Squadron (army)|"C" Squadron]], [[Queen's Own Oxfordshire Hussars]], and rose to the rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]].&lt;ref name="Churchill Obit" /&gt; He was killed by German shelling on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] on 20&amp;nbsp;May 1917; [[Winston Churchill]] wrote an obituary that appeared in ''[[The Times]]''.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=12}} Because the family owned an estate at [[Arnisdale]], Valentine's death was commemorated on the [[Glenelg, Highland|Glenelg]] War Memorial.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=13}}

Fleming's elder brother [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter]] (1907–1971) became a travel writer and married actress [[Celia Johnson]].&lt;ref name="PF Obit (1971)" /&gt; Peter served with the [[Grenadier Guards]] during the Second World War, was later commissioned under [[Colin Gubbins]] to help establish the [[Auxiliary Units]], and became involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.&lt;ref name="PF Obit (1971)" /&gt;

Fleming also had two younger brothers, Michael (1913–1940) and Richard (1911–1977), and a younger maternal half-sister born out of wedlock, the cellist [[Amaryllis Fleming]] (1925–1999), whose father was the artist [[Augustus John]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fleming |first=Fergus |title=Amaryllis Fleming |department=Obiturary |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-amaryllis-fleming-1110720.html |accessdate=4 December 2011 |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=5 August 1999 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amaryllis was conceived during a long-term affair between John and Evelyn that started in 1923, six years after the death of Valentine.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=19}}

=== Education and early life ===
In 1914 Fleming attended [[Durnford School]], a [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]] on the [[Isle of Purbeck]] in [[Dorset]].{{sfn|DelFattore|1989|p=86}}{{efn|The school was near to the estate of the Bond family, who could trace their ancestry to an Elizabethan spy named John Bond, and whose motto was ''Non Sufficit Orbis''—the world is not enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Britten|first=Nick|title=Ian Fleming 'used 16th century spy as inspiration for James Bond'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3285886/Ian-Fleming-used-16th-century-spy-as-inspiration-for-James-Bond.html|accessdate=4 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=30 October 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} He did not enjoy his time at Durnford; he suffered unpalatable food, physical hardship and bullying.{{sfn| DelFattore |1989|p=86}}
[[File:Eton College quadrangle.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A building in the Tudor style with a courtyard in front|[[Eton College]]: Fleming's ''alma mater'' from 1921 to 1927]]
In 1921 Fleming enrolled at [[Eton College]]. Not a high achiever academically, he excelled at athletics and held the title of ''[[Victor Ludorum]]'' ("Winner of the Games") for two years between 1925 and 1927.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=33}} He also edited a school magazine, ''The Wyvern''.&lt;ref name="Lycett (DNB)" /&gt; His lifestyle at Eton brought him into conflict with his housemaster, E. V. Slater, who disapproved of Fleming's attitude, his hair oil, his ownership of a car and his relations with women.{{sfn| DelFattore |1989|p=86}} Slater persuaded Fleming's mother to remove him from Eton a term early for a [[Cram school|crammer]] course to gain entry to the [[Royal Military College, Sandhurst|Royal Military College]] at Sandhurst.{{sfn| DelFattore |1989|p=86}} He spent less than a year there, leaving in 1927 without gaining a commission, after contracting [[gonorrhea]].{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=33}}

In 1927, to prepare Fleming for possible entry into the [[Foreign Office]],{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=45}} his mother sent him to the Tennerhof in [[Kitzbühel]], Austria, a small private school run by the [[Adlerian]] disciple and former British spy Ernan Forbes Dennis and his novelist wife, [[Phyllis Bottome]].{{sfn|DelFattore|1989|p=87}} After improving his language skills there, he studied briefly at [[Munich University]] and the [[University of Geneva]].&lt;ref name="Lycett (DNB)" /&gt; While in Geneva, Fleming began a romance with Monique Panchaud de Bottens and the couple were briefly engaged in 1931.&lt;ref name="S Tel: Bottens" /&gt;{{efn|Some sources provide the name as "Monique Panchaud de Bottomes".{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=17}}}} His mother disapproved and made him break off the relationship.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=34}} He applied for entry to the Foreign Office, but failed the examinations. His mother again intervened in his affairs, lobbying Sir Roderick Jones, head of [[Reuters]] News Agency, and in October 1931 he was given a position as a [[sub-editor]] and journalist for the company.&lt;ref name="Lycett (DNB)" /&gt; In 1933 Fleming spent time in Moscow, where he covered the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] [[show trial]] of six engineers from the British company [[Metropolitan-Vickers]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=46}} While there he applied for an interview with Soviet premier [[Joseph Stalin]], and was amazed to receive a personally signed note apologising for not being able to attend.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=39}}

Fleming bowed to family pressure in October 1933, and went into banking with a position at the financiers Cull &amp; Co.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=46}} In 1935 he moved to Rowe and Pitman on [[Bishopsgate]] as a stockbroker.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=39}} Fleming was unsuccessful in both roles.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=72}}{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=46}} Early in 1939 Fleming began an affair with Ann O'Neill (née Charteris), who was married to the [[Baron O'Neill|3rd Baron O'Neill]];{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=96}} she was also having an affair with [[Esmond Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere|Esmond Harmsworth]], the heir to Lord Rothermere, owner of the ''Daily Mail''.&lt;ref name="Lycett (Ann DNB)" /&gt;

=== Second World War ===
[[File:Old Admiralty Building 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=A red brick building with white stone detailing in the Queen Anne style with French influences|[[Admiralty#The Admiralty|The Admiralty]], where Fleming worked in the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] during the Second World War]]
In May 1939 Fleming was recruited by [[Rear Admiral]] [[John Henry Godfrey|John Godfrey]], [[Naval Intelligence Division|Director of Naval Intelligence]] of the [[Royal Navy]], to become his [[personal assistant]]. He joined the organisation full-time in August 1939,{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=99}} with the codename "17F",{{sfn|Gant|1966|p=45}} and worked out of Room 39 at [[Ripley Building|The Admiralty]].{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=101}} Fleming's biographer, [[Andrew Lycett]], notes that Fleming had "no obvious qualifications" for the role.&lt;ref name="Lycett (DNB)" /&gt; As part of his appointment, Fleming was commissioned into the [[Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] in July 1939,{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=99}} initially as [[Lieutenant (navy)|lieutenant]],{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=101}} but promoted to [[commander]] a few months later.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=103}}

Fleming proved invaluable as Godfrey's personal assistant and excelled in administration.&lt;ref name="Lycett (DNB)" /&gt; Godfrey was known as an abrasive character who made enemies within government circles. He frequently used Fleming as a liaison with other sections of the government's wartime administration, such as the [[Secret Intelligence Service]], the [[Political Warfare Executive]], the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE), the [[Joint Intelligence Committee (United Kingdom)|Joint Intelligence Committee]] and the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]'s staff.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=28}}

On 29 September 1939, soon after the start of the war, Godfrey circulated a memorandum that, "bore all the hallmarks of&amp;nbsp;... Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming", according to historian [[Ben Macintyre]].{{sfn|Macintyre|2010|p=6}} It was called the [[Trout Memo]] and compared the deception of an enemy in wartime to [[fly fishing]].{{sfn|Macintyre|2010|p=6}} The memo contained several schemes to be considered for use against the [[Axis powers]] to lure [[U-boats]] and German surface ships towards minefields.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=29}} Number 28 on the list was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy; the suggestion is similar to [[Operation Mincemeat]], the 1943 plan to conceal the [[operation Husky|intended invasion of Italy]] from North Africa, which was developed by Charles Cholmondoley in October 1942.{{sfn|Macintyre|2010|p=7}} The recommendation in the Trout Memo was titled: "A Suggestion (not a very nice one)",{{sfn|Macintyre|2010|p=7}} and continued: "The following suggestion is used in a book by [[Basil Thomson]]: a corpse dressed as an airman, with despatches in his pockets, could be dropped on the coast, supposedly from a parachute that has failed. I understand there is no difficulty in obtaining corpses at the Naval Hospital, but, of course, it would have to be a fresh one."{{sfn|Macintyre|2010|p=7}}

In 1940 Fleming and Godfrey contacted [[Kenneth Mason (geographer)|Kenneth Mason]], Professor of Geography at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], about the preparation of reports on the geography of countries involved in military operations. These reports were the precursors of the [[Naval Intelligence Handbooks|''Naval Intelligence Division Geographical Handbook Series'']] produced between 1941 and 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clout|first=Hugh|author2=Gosme, Cyril |title=The Naval Intelligence Handbooks: a monument in geographical writing|journal=[[Progress in Human Geography]]|date=April 2003|volume=27|issue=2|pages=153–173 [156]|doi=10.1191/0309132503ph420oa|issn=0309-1325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Operation Ruthless]], a plan aimed at obtaining details of the [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#German Navy 3-rotor Enigma|Enigma codes]] used by [[Kriegsmarine|Nazi Germany's navy]], was instigated by a memo written by Fleming to Godfrey on 12 September 1940. The idea was to "obtain" a German bomber, man it with a German-speaking crew dressed in Luftwaffe uniforms, and crash it into the English Channel. The crew would then attack their German rescuers and bring their boat and [[Enigma machine]] back to England.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=121}} Much to the annoyance of [[Alan Turing]] and [[Peter Twinn]] at [[Bletchley Park]], the mission was never carried out. According to Fleming's niece, [[Lucy Fleming|Lucy]], an official of the [[Royal Air Force]] pointed out that if they were to drop a downed [[Heinkel]] bomber in the English Channel, it would probably sink rather quickly.&lt;ref name="Correspondence" /&gt;

Fleming also worked with Colonel [[William Joseph Donovan|"Wild Bill" Donovan]], President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s special representative on intelligence co-operation between London and Washington.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=120}} In May 1941 Fleming accompanied Godfrey to the United States, where he assisted in writing a [[blueprint]] for the [[Office of the Coordinator of Information]], the department that turned into the [[Office of Strategic Services]] and eventually became the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].{{sfn|Pearson|1967|p=137}}

Admiral Godfrey put Fleming in charge of [[Operation Goldeneye]] between 1941 and 1942; Goldeneye was a plan to maintain an intelligence framework in Spain in the event of a German takeover of the territory.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|pp=124–125}} Fleming's plan involved maintaining communication with [[Gibraltar]] and launching sabotage operations against the Nazis.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=54}} In 1941 he liaised with Donovan over American involvement in a measure intended to ensure that the Germans did not dominate the seaways.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=125}}

==== 30 Assault Unit ====
In 1942 Fleming formed a unit of [[British Commandos|commandos]], known as [[No. 30 Commando]] or 30 Assault Unit (30AU), composed of specialist intelligence troops.{{sfn|Rankin|2011|p=136}} 30AU's job was to be near the front line of an advance—sometimes in front of it—to seize enemy documents from previously targeted headquarters.{{sfn|Longden|2010|p=2}} The unit was based on a German group headed by [[Otto Skorzeny]], who had undertaken similar activities in the [[Battle of Crete]] in May 1941.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=33}} The German unit was thought by Fleming to be "one of the most outstanding innovations in German intelligence".{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=50}}

Fleming did not fight in the field with the unit, but selected targets and directed operations from the rear.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=33}} On its formation the unit was thirty strong, but it grew to five times that size.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=50}} The unit was filled with men from other commando units, and trained in unarmed combat, safe-cracking and lock-picking at the SOE facilities.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=33}} In late 1942 [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] (later [[Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom|Rear-Admiral]]) Edmund Rushbrooke replaced Godfrey as head of the Naval Intelligence Division, and Fleming's influence in the organisation declined, although he retained control over 30AU.&lt;ref name="Lycett (DNB)" /&gt; Fleming was unpopular with the unit's members,{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=50}} who disliked his referring to them as his "Red Indians".{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=152}}

Before the 1944 [[Normandy landings]], most of 30AU's operations were in the Mediterranean, and it also secretly participated in the [[Dieppe Raid]] in a failed pinch raid for an Enigma machine and related materials. Fleming observed the raid from [[HMS Fernie (L11)|HMS ''Fernie'']], 700 yards offshore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ogrodnik|first=Irene|title=Breaking German codes real reason for 1942 Dieppe raid: historian|url=http://www.globalnews.ca/feature/6442694158/story.html|work=Global News|publisher=[[Shaw Media]]|accessdate=17 August 2012|date=9 August 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024084451/http://www.globalnews.ca/feature/6442694158/story.html|archivedate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its successes in Sicily and Italy, 30AU became greatly trusted by naval intelligence.{{sfn|Rankin|2011|p=220}}{{sfn|Longden|2010|p=6}}

In March 1944 Fleming oversaw the distribution of intelligence to Royal Navy units in preparation for [[Operation Overlord]].{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=56}} He was replaced as head of 30AU on 6 June 1944,{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=33}} but maintained some involvement.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|pp=152–3}} He visited 30AU in the field during and after Overlord, especially following an attack on [[Cherbourg]] for which he was concerned that the unit had been incorrectly used as a regular commando force rather than an intelligence-gathering unit. This wasted the men's specialist skills, risked their safety on operations that did not justify the use of such skilled operatives, and threatened the vital gathering of intelligence. Afterwards, the management of these units was revised.{{sfn|Rankin|2011|p=220}} He also followed the unit into Germany after it located, in Tambach Castle, the German naval archives from 1870.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|pp=56–57}}

In December 1944 Fleming was posted on an intelligence fact-finding trip to the Far East on behalf of the Director of Naval Intelligence.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=154}} Much of the trip was spent identifying opportunities for 30AU in the Pacific;{{sfn|Lycett|1996|pp=154–155}} the unit saw little action because of the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of 30 Assault Unit 1942–1946|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lhcma/summary/xh40-001.shtml|work=Liddell Hart Centre for Military Archives|publisher=[[King's College London]]|accessdate=16 May 2012|location=London|date=8 August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== T-Force ====
[[File:GoldeneyeEstate.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A white-washed bungalow with a lawn in front|[[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye]], where Fleming wrote all the Bond stories]]

The success of 30AU led to the August 1944 decision to establish a "Target Force", which became known as [[T-Force]]. The official memorandum, held at [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] in London, describes the unit's primary role: "T-Force = Target Force, to guard and secure documents, persons, equipment, with combat and Intelligence personnel, after capture of large towns, ports etc. in liberated and enemy territory."{{sfn|Longden|2010|p=45|ps=: National Archives document WO219/551 (Special Force to Seize Intelligence)}}

Fleming sat on the committee that selected the targets for the T-Force unit, and listed them in the "Black Books" that were issued to the unit's officers.{{sfn|Longden|2010|p=51}} The infantry component of T-Force was in part made up of the 5th Battalion, [[King's Regiment]], which supported the [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]].{{sfn|Longden|2010|p=78}} It was responsible for securing targets of interest for the British military, including nuclear laboratories, gas research centres and individual rocket scientists. The unit's most notable discoveries came during the advance on the German port of [[Kiel]], in the research centre for German engines used in the [[V-2 rocket]], [[Messerschmitt Me 163]] fighters and high-speed U-boats.{{sfn|Longden|2010|p=198}} Fleming would later use elements of the activities of T-Force in his writing, particularly in his 1955 Bond novel ''[[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]]''.{{sfn|Longden|2010|p=377}}

In 1942 Fleming attended an Anglo-American intelligence summit in Jamaica and, despite the constant heavy rain during his visit, he decided to live on the island once the war was over.{{sfn|Gant|1966|p=51}} His friend Ivar Bryce helped find a plot of land in [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|Saint Mary Parish]] where, in 1945, Fleming had a house built, which he named [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye]].{{sfn|Pearson|1967|p=161}} The name of the house and estate where he wrote his novels has many possible sources. Fleming himself mentioned both his wartime Operation Goldeneye{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=165}} and [[Carson McCullers]]' 1941 novel ''[[Reflections in a Golden Eye (novel)|Reflections in a Golden Eye]]'', which described the use of British naval bases in the Caribbean by the American navy.{{sfn|Pearson|1967|p=161}}

Fleming was awarded the Danish Frihedsmedalje in October 1947 for his contribution in assisting Danish officers escaping from Denmark to Britain during the occupation of Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Faurholt|first1=Af Martin Schantz|title=Fleming og James Bonds danske forbin|url=http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/kultur/historie/ian-fleming-og-james-bonds-danske-forbindelse|accessdate=30 October 2015|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-war ===
Upon Fleming's [[Demobilisation of the British Armed Forces after the Second World War|demobilisation]] in May 1945, he became the Foreign Manager in the Kemsley newspaper group, which at the time owned ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. In this role he oversaw the paper's worldwide network of correspondents. His contract allowed him to take three months holiday every winter, which he took in Jamaica.&lt;ref name="Lycett (DNB)" /&gt; Fleming worked full-time for the paper until December 1959,{{sfn|Lycett|1996|pp=360–361}} but continued to write articles and attend the Tuesday weekly meetings until at least 1961.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=384}}{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=394}}

After Ann Charteris' first husband died in the war, she expected to marry Fleming, but he decided to remain a bachelor.&lt;ref name="Lycett (DNB)" /&gt; On 28 June 1945, she married the [[Esmond Harmsworth, 2nd Viscount Rothermere|second Viscount Rothermere]].&lt;ref name="Lycett (Ann DNB)" /&gt; Nevertheless, Charteris continued her affair with Fleming, travelling to Jamaica to see him under the pretext of visiting his friend and neighbour [[Noël Coward]]. In 1948 she gave birth to Fleming's daughter, Mary, who was [[Stillbirth|stillborn]]. Rothermere divorced Charteris in 1951 because of her relationship with Fleming,&lt;ref name="Lycett (Ann DNB)" /&gt; and the couple married on 24 March 1952 in Jamaica,{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=217}} a few months before their son Caspar was born in August. Both Fleming and Ann had affairs during their marriage, she with [[Hugh Gaitskell]], the [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]].{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=295}} Fleming had a long-term affair in Jamaica with one of his neighbours, [[Blanche Blackwell]], the mother of [[Chris Blackwell]] of [[Island Records]].{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=113}}

=== 1950s ===

Fleming had first mentioned to friends during the war that he wanted to write a spy novel,&lt;ref name="Lycett (DNB)" /&gt; an ambition he achieved within two months with [[Casino Royale (novel)|''Casino Royale'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ian Fleming |url=http://www.ianfleming.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=96 |work=About Ian Fleming |publisher=[[Ian Fleming Publications]] |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815225420/http://www.ianfleming.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=96 |archivedate=15 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He started writing the book at Goldeneye on 17 February 1952, gaining inspiration from his own experiences and imagination. He claimed afterwards that he wrote the novel to distract himself from his forthcoming wedding to the pregnant Charteris,{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|2003|p=1}} and called the work his "dreadful oafish opus".{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=19}} His manuscript was typed in London by Joan Howe (mother of travel writer [[Rory MacLean]]), and Fleming's red-haired secretary at ''The Times'' on whom the character [[Miss Moneypenny]] was partially based.{{sfn|MacLean|2012|p=57}} Clare Blanchard, a former girlfriend, advised him not to publish the book, or at least to do so under a pseudonym.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=5}}

During ''Casino Royale's'' final draft stages, Fleming allowed his friend [[William Plomer]] to see a copy, and remarked "so far as I can see the element of suspense is completely absent".{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=226}} Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house [[Jonathan Cape]]. At first, they were unenthusiastic about the novel, but Fleming's brother Peter, whose books they managed, persuaded the company to publish it.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=226}} On 13 April 1953 ''Casino Royale'' was released in the UK in hardcover, priced at [[£sd|10s 6d]],{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=244}} with a cover designed by Fleming.&lt;ref name="Guardian covers (2008)" /&gt; It was a success and three print runs were needed to cope with the demand.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=244}}&lt;ref name="Guardian covers (2008)" /&gt;{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=14}}

The novel centres on the exploits of [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]], an officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]. Bond was also known by his code number, 007, and was a [[Commander (Royal Navy)|commander]] in the [[Royal Naval Reserve]]. Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist [[James Bond (ornithologist)|James Bond]], an expert on [[Caribbean]] birds and author of the definitive field guide ''[[Birds of the West Indies]]''. Fleming, himself a keen [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]],&lt;ref name="Bond obit" /&gt; had a copy of Bond's guide, and later told the ornithologist's wife, "that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born".{{sfn|Griswold|2006|p=46}} In a 1962 interview in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', he further explained: "When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument&amp;nbsp;... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard."&lt;ref name="Hellman (1962)" /&gt;
[[File:Fleming007impression.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Fleming's sketch showing his concept of the [[James Bond (literary character)|James Bond]] character.]]
Fleming based his creation on individuals he met during his time in the Naval Intelligence Division, and admitted that Bond "was a compound of all the secret agents and commando types I met during the war".&lt;ref name=" Macintyre (2008)" /&gt; Among those types were his brother Peter, whom he worshipped,&lt;ref name=" Macintyre (2008)" /&gt; and who had been involved in behind-the-lines operations in Norway and Greece during the war.&lt;ref name="PF Obit (1971)" /&gt; Fleming envisaged that Bond would resemble the composer, singer and actor [[Hoagy Carmichael]]; others, such as author and historian [[Ben Macintyre]], identify aspects of Fleming's own looks in his description of Bond.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=51}}{{sfn|Amis|1966|p=35}} General references in the novels describe Bond as having "dark, rather cruel good looks".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=62}}

Fleming also modelled aspects of Bond on [[Conrad O'Brien-ffrench]], a spy whom Fleming had met while skiing in Kitzbühel in the 1930s, [[Patrick Dalzel-Job]], who served with distinction in 30AU during the war, and [[Wilfred Dunderdale|Bill "Biffy" Dunderdale]], station head of MI6 in Paris, who wore cufflinks and handmade suits and was chauffeured around Paris in a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]].&lt;ref name=" Macintyre (2008)" /&gt;{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|pp=68–69}} [[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Sir Fitzroy Maclean]] was another possible model for Bond, based on his wartime work behind enemy lines in the [[Balkans]], as was the MI6 [[double agent]] [[Duško Popov]].{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=54}} Fleming also endowed Bond with many of his own traits, including the same golf handicap, his taste for scrambled eggs, his love of gambling, and use of the same brand of toiletries.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=50}}&lt;ref name="Cook (2004)" /&gt;

After the publication of ''Casino Royale'', Fleming used his annual holiday at his house in Jamaica to write another Bond story.&lt;ref name="Lycett (DNB)" /&gt; Twelve Bond novels and two short-story collections were published between 1953 and 1966, the last two (''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' and ''[[Octopussy and The Living Daylights]]'') posthumously.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=75}} Much of the background to the stories came from Fleming's previous work in the Naval Intelligence Division or from events he knew of from the [[Cold War]].{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=90}} The plot of [[From Russia, with Love (novel)|''From Russia, with Love'']] uses a fictional Soviet Spektor decoding machine as a lure to trap Bond; the Spektor had its roots in the wartime German Enigma machine.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}} The novel's plot device of spies on the [[Orient Express]] was based on the story of Eugene Karp, a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris in February 1950, carrying papers about blown US spy networks in the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Soviet assassins already on the train drugged the conductor, and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of [[Salzburg]].{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=96}}

[[File:HoagyCarmichael.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hoagy Carmichael]], whose looks Fleming described for Bond]]
Many of the names used in the Bond works came from people Fleming knew: [[Francisco Scaramanga|Scaramanga]], the principal villain in ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', was named after a fellow Eton schoolboy with whom Fleming fought;{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=90}} [[Auric Goldfinger|Goldfinger]], from the eponymous novel, was named after British architect [[Ernő Goldfinger]], whose work Fleming abhorred;{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=90}} Sir [[Hugo Drax]], the antagonist of ''Moonraker'', was named after Fleming's acquaintance [[Reginald Plunkett|Admiral Sir Reginald Aylmer Ranfurly Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax]];{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=88}} Drax's assistant, Krebs, bears the same name as Hitler's [[Hans Krebs (Wehrmacht general)|last Chief of Staff]];{{sfn|Black|2005|p=20}} and one of the homosexual villains from [[Diamonds Are Forever (novel)|''Diamonds Are Forever'']], "Boofy" Kidd, was named after one of Fleming's close friends—and a relative of his wife—[[Arthur Gore, 8th Earl of Arran]], known as Boofy to his friends.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=90}}

Fleming's first work of non-fiction, ''[[The Diamond Smugglers]]'', was published in 1957 and was partly based on background research for his fourth Bond novel, ''Diamonds Are Forever''.{{sfn|Benson|1988|pp=16–17}} Much of the material had appeared in ''The Sunday Times'' and was based on Fleming's interviews with John Collard, a member of the International Diamond Security Organisation who had previously worked in [[MI5]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=16}} The book received mixed reviews in the UK and US.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=17}}

For the first five books (''Casino Royale'', [[Live and Let Die (novel)|''Live and Let Die'']], ''Moonraker'', ''Diamonds Are Forever'' and ''From Russia, with Love'') Fleming received broadly positive reviews.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|pp=196–197}} That began to change in March 1958 when [[Bernard Bergonzi]], in the journal ''Twentieth Century'', attacked Fleming's work as containing "a strongly marked streak of voyeurism and sado-masochism"&lt;ref name="Bergonzi (1958)" /&gt; and wrote that the books showed "the total lack of any ethical frame of reference".&lt;ref name="Bergonzi (1958)" /&gt; The article compared Fleming unfavourably with [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|John Buchan]] and Raymond Chandler on both moral and literary criteria.{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=19}} A month later, ''[[Dr. No (novel)|Dr. No]]'' was published, and Fleming received harsh criticism from reviewers who, in the words of Ben Macintyre, "rounded on Fleming, almost as a pack".{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=197}} The most strongly worded of the critiques came from [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', who, in his review "Sex, Snobbery and Sadism", called the novel "without doubt, the nastiest book I have ever read".&lt;ref name="Johnson (1958)" /&gt; Johnson went on to say that "by the time I was a third of the way through, I had to suppress a strong impulse to throw the thing away".&lt;ref name="Johnson (1958)" /&gt; Johnson recognised that in Bond there "was a social phenomenon of some importance",&lt;ref name="Johnson (1958)" /&gt; but this was seen as a negative element, as the phenomenon concerned "three basic ingredients in ''Dr No'', all unhealthy, all thoroughly English: the sadism of a schoolboy bully, the mechanical, two-dimensional sex-longings of a frustrated adolescent, and the crude, snob-cravings of a suburban adult."&lt;ref name="Johnson (1958)" /&gt; Johnson saw no positives in ''Dr. No'', and said, "Mr Fleming has no literary skill, the construction of the book is chaotic, and entire incidents and situations are inserted, and then forgotten, in a haphazard manner."&lt;ref name="Johnson (1958)" /&gt;

Lycett notes that Fleming "went into a personal and creative decline" after marital problems and the attacks on his work.&lt;ref name="Lycett (DNB)" /&gt; [[Goldfinger (novel)|''Goldfinger'']] had been written before the publication of ''Dr. No''; the next book Fleming produced after the criticism was [[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|''For Your Eyes Only'']], a collection of short stories derived from outlines written for a television series that did not come to fruition.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=18}} Lycett noted that, as Fleming was writing the television scripts and the short stories, "Ian's mood of weariness and self-doubt was beginning to affect his writing", which can be seen in Bond's thoughts.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=369}}

=== 1960s ===
In 1960 Fleming was commissioned by the [[Kuwait Oil Company]] to write a book on the country and its oil industry. The Kuwaiti Government disapproved of the typescript, ''State of Excitement: Impressions of Kuwait'', and it was never published. According to Fleming: "The Oil Company expressed approval of the book but felt it their duty to submit the typescript to members of the Kuwait Government for their approval. The [[Sheikh]]s concerned found unpalatable certain mild comments and criticisms and particularly the passages referring to the adventurous past of the country which now wishes to be 'civilised' in every respect and forget its romantic origins."&lt;ref name="Lilly Library" /&gt;

Fleming followed the disappointment of ''For Your Eyes Only'' with [[Thunderball (novel)|''Thunderball'']], the [[novelization]] of a film script on which he had worked with others. The work had started in 1958 when Fleming's friend Ivar Bryce introduced him to a young Irish writer and director, [[Kevin McClory]], and the three, together with Fleming and Bryce's friend Ernest Cuneo, worked on a script.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=17}} In October McClory introduced experienced screenwriter [[Jack Whittingham]] to the newly formed team,{{sfn|Pearson|1967|p=374}} and by December 1959 McClory and Whittingham sent Fleming a script.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=231}} Fleming had been having second thoughts on McClory's involvement and, in January 1960, explained his intention of delivering the screenplay to [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]], with a recommendation from him and Bryce that McClory act as producer.{{sfn|Pearson|1967|p=381}} He additionally told McClory that if MCA rejected the film because of McClory's involvement, then McClory should either sell himself to MCA, back out of the deal, or file a suit in court.{{sfn|Pearson|1967|p=381}}

Working at Goldeneye between January and March 1960, Fleming wrote the novel ''Thunderball'', based on the screenplay written by himself, Whittingham and McClory.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=20}} In March 1961 McClory read an advance copy, and he and Whittingham immediately petitioned the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London for an injunction to stop publication.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=21}} After [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|two court actions]], the second in November 1961,&lt;ref name="Sellers (2007)" /&gt; Fleming offered McClory a deal, settling out of court. McClory gained the literary and film rights for the screenplay, while Fleming was given the rights to the novel, provided it was acknowledged as "based on a screen treatment by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and the Author".{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=432}}

Fleming's books had always sold well, but in 1961 sales increased dramatically. On 17 March 1961, four years after its publication and three years after the heavy criticism of ''Dr. No'', an article in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' listed ''From Russia, with Love'' as one of [[President of the United States|US President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]'s ten favourite books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sidey|first=Hugh|title=The President's Voracious Reading Habits|journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]]|date=17 March 1961|volume=50|issue=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vUUEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 December 2011|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy and Fleming had previously met in Washington.&lt;ref name="Hellman (1962)" /&gt; This accolade and the associated publicity led to a surge in sales that made Fleming the biggest-selling crime writer in the US.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=383}}{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=vi}} Fleming considered ''From Russia, with Love'' to be his best novel; he said "the great thing is that each one of the books seems to have been a favourite with one or other section of the public and none has yet been completely damned."{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=97}}

In April 1961, shortly before the second court case on ''Thunderball'',&lt;ref name="Lycett (DNB)" /&gt; Fleming had a heart attack during a regular weekly meeting at ''The Sunday Times''.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=384}} While he was convalescing, one of his friends, Duff Dunbar, gave him a copy of [[Beatrix Potter]]'s ''[[The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin]]'' and suggested that he take the time to write up the bedtime story that Fleming used to tell to his son Caspar each evening.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=384}} Fleming attacked the project with gusto and wrote to his publisher, Michael Howard of Jonathan Cape, joking that "There is not a moment, even on the edge of the tomb, when I am not slaving for you";{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=194}} the result was Fleming's only children's novel, ''[[Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang]]'', which was published in October 1964, two months after his death.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=27}}

In June 1961 Fleming sold a six-month option on the film rights to his published and future James Bond novels and short stories to [[Harry Saltzman]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=21}} Saltzman formed the production vehicle [[Eon Productions]] along with  [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert R. "Cubby" Broccoli]], and after an extensive search, they hired [[Sean Connery]] on a five-film deal, beginning with ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962).{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=22}}&lt;ref name="documentary" /&gt; Connery's depiction of Bond affected the literary character; in ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]'', the first book written after ''Dr. No'' was released, Fleming gave Bond a sense of humour that was not present in the previous stories.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=205}}

Fleming's second non-fiction book was published in November 1963: ''[[Thrilling Cities]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hope|first=Francis|title=Purple Trail|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|location=London|date=10 November 1963|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reprint of a series of ''Sunday Times'' articles based on Fleming's impressions of world cities{{sfn|Pearson|1967|p=375}} in trips taken during 1959 and 1960.{{sfn|Fleming|1963|p=7}} Approached in 1964 by producer [[Norman Felton]] to write a spy series for television, Fleming provided several ideas, including the names of characters [[Napoleon Solo]] and [[The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.|April Dancer]], for the series ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]''{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=26}} However, Fleming withdrew from the project following a request from Eon Productions, who were keen to avoid any legal problems that might occur if the project overlapped with the Bond films.{{sfn|Britton|2004|p=36}}

In January 1964 Fleming went to Goldeneye for what proved to be his last holiday and wrote the first draft of ''The Man with the Golden Gun''.{{sfn| DelFattore |1989|p=108}} He was dissatisfied with it and wrote to [[William Plomer]], the copy editor of his novels, asking for it to be rewritten.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=30}} Fleming became increasingly unhappy with the book and considered rewriting it, but was dissuaded by Plomer, who considered it viable for publication.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=438}}

=== Death ===
[[File:Ian fleming grave.png|thumb|upright|alt=An obelisk marking the site of the Fleming family grave|upright|Ian Fleming's grave and memorial at [[Sevenhampton, Wiltshire|Sevenhampton]]]]
Fleming was a heavy [[tobacco smoking|smoker]] and [[alcoholic beverage|drinker]] throughout his adult life, and suffered from [[heart disease]].{{efn|When he was 38, Fleming smoked up to 70 cigarettes a day;{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=172}} he had been having them custom made at Morland of Grosvenor Street since the 1930s, and three gold bands on the filter were added during the war to mirror his naval commander's rank.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=70}}}} In 1961, aged 53, he suffered a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and struggled to [[recuperation (recovery)|recuperate]].{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=442}} On 11 August 1964, while staying at a hotel in [[Canterbury]], Fleming went to the [[Royal St George's Golf Club]] for lunch and later dined at his hotel with friends. The day had been tiring for him, and he collapsed with another heart attack shortly after the meal.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=442}} Fleming died at age 56 in the early morning of 12 August 1964—his son Caspar's twelfth birthday.&lt;ref name="Times obit (1965)" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ian Fleming and the British Heart Foundation |url=http://www.ianfleming.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=112 |work=About Ian Fleming |publisher=[[Ian Fleming Publications]] |accessdate=15 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202613/http://www.ianfleming.com/pages/content/index.asp?PageID=112 |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; His last recorded words were an apology to the ambulance drivers for having inconvenienced them,{{sfn| DelFattore |1989|p=110}} saying "I am sorry to trouble you chaps. I don't know how you get along so fast with the traffic on the roads these days."{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=443}} Fleming was buried in the churchyard of [[Sevenhampton, Wiltshire|Sevenhampton]], near [[Swindon]].{{sfn|Winn|2012|p=247}}

Fleming's last two books, ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' and ''Octopussy and The Living Daylights'', were published posthumously.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=75}} ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' was published eight months after Fleming's death and had not been through the full editing process by Fleming.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=141}} As a result, the novel was thought by publishing company Jonathan Cape to be thin and "feeble".{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=445}} The publishers had passed the manuscript to [[Kingsley Amis]] to read on holiday, but did not use his suggestions.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=445}} Fleming's biographer Henry Chandler observes that the novel "received polite and rather sad reviews, recognising that the book had effectively been left half-finished, and as such did not represent Fleming at the top of his game".{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=233}} The final Bond book, containing two short stories, ''Octopussy and The Living Daylights'', was published in Britain on 23 June 1966.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=31}}

In October 1975, Fleming's son Caspar, aged 23, committed suicide by [[drug overdose]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Son of Ian Fleming took barbiturate overdose|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=14 October 1975|location=London|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried with his father.{{sfn|Winn|2012|p=247}} Fleming's widow, Ann, died in 1981 and was buried with her husband and their son.&lt;ref name="Lycett (Ann DNB)" /&gt;

== Writing ==
The author [[Raymond Benson]], who later wrote a series of Bond novels, noted that Fleming's books fall into two distinct periods along stylistic lines. Those books written between 1953 and 1960 tend to concentrate on "mood, character development, and plot advancement",{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=85}} while those released between 1961 and 1966 incorporate more detail and imagery. Benson argues that Fleming had become "a master storyteller" by the time he wrote ''Thunderball'' in 1961.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=31}}

[[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] divides the series based on the villains Fleming created, a division supported by fellow academic Christoph Lindner.{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=81}} Thus the early books from ''Casino Royale'' to ''For Your Eyes Only'' are classed as "Cold War stories", with [[SMERSH]] as the antagonists,{{sfn|Black|2005|p=49}} followed by [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld|Blofeld]] and [[SPECTRE]] as Bond's opponents in the three novels ''Thunderball'', ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' and ''You Only Live Twice'', after the thawing of East–West relations.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=v}}{{efn|Despite the thaw, the Cold War became increasingly tense again shortly afterwards, with the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] all occurring in an eighteen-month period from April 1961 to November 1962.{{sfn|Black|2005|pp=49–50}}}} Black and Lindner both classify the remaining books—''The Man with the Golden Gun'', ''Octopussy and The Living Daylights'' and ''The Spy Who Loved Me''—as "the later Fleming stories".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=71}}

=== Style and technique ===
Fleming said of his work, "while thrillers may not be Literature with a capital L, it is possible to write what I can best describe as 'thrillers designed to be read as literature{{' "}}.{{sfn|Faulks|Fleming|2009|p=320}} He named [[Raymond Chandler]], [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[Eric Ambler]] and [[Graham Greene]] as influences.{{sfn|Bennett|Woollacott|2003|p=13}} William Cook in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' considered James Bond to be "the culmination of an important but much-maligned tradition in English literature. As a boy, Fleming devoured the [[Bulldog Drummond]] tales of Lieutenant Colonel [[H. C. McNeile]] (aka "Sapper") and the [[Richard Hannay]] stories of John Buchan. His genius was to repackage these antiquated adventures to fit the fashion of postwar Britain&amp;nbsp;... In Bond, he created a Bulldog Drummond for the jet age."&lt;ref name="Cook (2004)" /&gt; [[Umberto Eco]] considered [[Mickey Spillane]] to have been another major influence.{{sfn|Eco|2003|p=34}}

In May 1963 Fleming wrote a piece for ''Books and Bookmen'' magazine in which he described his approach to writing Bond books: "I write for about three hours in the morning&amp;nbsp;... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I never go back to see what I have written&amp;nbsp;... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day."{{sfn|Faulks|Fleming|2009|p=320}} Benson identified what he described as the "Fleming Sweep", the use of "hooks" at the end of chapters to heighten tension and pull the reader into the next.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=85}} The hooks combine with what [[Anthony Burgess]] calls "a heightened journalistic style"{{sfn|Burgess|1984|p=74}} to produce "a speed of narrative, which hustles the reader past each danger point of mockery".{{sfn|Faulks|Fleming|2009|p=318}}

Umberto Eco analysed Fleming's works from a [[Structuralism|Structuralist]] point of view,{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=3}} and identified a series of oppositions within the storylines that provide structure and narrative, including:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-2}}
* Bond—M
* Bond—Villain
* Villain—Woman
* Woman—Bond
* Free World—Soviet Union
* Great Britain—Non-Anglo-Saxon Countries
* Duty—Sacrifice
{{col-break}}
* Cupidity—Ideals
* Love—Death
* Chance—Planning
* Luxury—Discomfort
* Excess—Moderation
* Perversion—Innocence
* Loyalty—Dishonour{{sfn|Eco|2003|p=36}}
{{col-end}}

Eco also noted that the Bond villains tend to come from Central Europe or from Slavic or Mediterranean countries and have a mixed heritage and "complex and obscure origins".{{sfn|Eco|2003|p=40}} Eco found that the villains were generally asexual or homosexual, inventive, organisationally astute, and wealthy.{{sfn|Eco|2003|p=40}} Black observed the same point: "Fleming did not use class enemies for his villains instead relying on physical distortion or ethnic identity&amp;nbsp;... Furthermore, in Britain foreign villains used foreign servants and employees&amp;nbsp;... This racism reflected not only a pronounced theme of interwar adventure writing, such as the novels of Buchan, but also wider literary culture."{{sfn|Black|2005|p=19}} Writer [[Louise Welsh]] found that the novel ''Live and Let Die'' "taps into the paranoia that some sectors of white society were feeling" as the [[civil rights movement]]s challenged prejudice and inequality.{{sfn|Fleming|Welsh|2006|p=v}}

Fleming used well-known brand names and everyday details to support a sense of realism.{{sfn|Faulks|Fleming|2009|p=320}} Kingsley Amis called this "the Fleming effect",{{sfn|Amis|1966|p=112}} describing it as "the imaginative use of information, whereby the pervading fantastic nature of Bond's world&amp;nbsp;... [is] bolted down to some sort of reality, or at least counter-balanced."{{sfn|Amis|1966|pp=111–112}}

=== Major themes ===

==== Britain's position in the world ====
The Bond books were written in post-war Britain, when the country was still an imperial power.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=3}} As the series progressed, the [[British Empire]] was in decline; journalist William Cook observed that "Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the fantasy that Britannia could still punch above her weight."&lt;ref name="Cook (2004)" /&gt; This decline of British power was referred to in several of the novels; in ''From Russia, with Love'', it manifested itself in Bond's conversations with Darko Kerim, when Bond admits that in England, "we don't show teeth any more—only gums."{{sfn|Fleming|Higson|2006|p=227}}{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=113}} The theme is strongest in one of the later books of the series, the 1964 novel ''You Only Live Twice'', in conversations between Bond and the head of Japan's secret intelligence service, [[Tiger Tanaka]]. Fleming was acutely aware of the loss of British prestige in the 1950s and early 60s, particularly during the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation]], when he had Tanaka accuse Britain of throwing away the empire "with both hands".{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=113}}{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|pp=200–201}}{{sfn|Black|2005|p=62}}

Black points to the defections of [[Cambridge Five|four members of MI6]] to the [[Soviet Union]] as having a major impact on how Britain was viewed in US intelligence circles.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=61}} The last of the defections was that of [[Kim Philby]] in January 1963,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clive|first=Nigel|title=Philby, Harold Adrian Russell (Kim) (1912–1988)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/40699|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate=25 October 2011|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/40699}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Fleming was still writing the first draft of ''You Only Live Twice''.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=24}} The briefing between Bond and M is the first time in the twelve books that Fleming acknowledges the defections.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=200}} Black contends that the conversation between M and Bond allows Fleming to discuss the decline of Britain, with the defections and the [[Profumo Affair]] of 1963 as a backdrop.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=62}} Two of the defections had taken place shortly before Fleming wrote ''Casino Royale'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kerr|first=Sheila|title=Burgess, Guy Francis de Moncy (1911–1963)|journal=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/37244|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/37244|accessdate=20 September 2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2004}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the book can be seen as the writer's "attempt to reflect the disturbing moral ambiguity of a post-war world that could produce traitors like [[Guy Burgess|Burgess]] and [[Donald Maclean (spy)|Maclean]]", according to Lycett.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=221}}

By the end of the series, in the 1965 novel, ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', Black notes that an independent inquiry was undertaken by the Jamaican judiciary, while the CIA and MI6 were recorded as acting "under the closest liaison and direction of the Jamaican CID": this was the new world of a non-colonial, independent Jamaica, further underlining the decline of the British Empire.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=78}} The decline was also reflected in Bond's use of US equipment and personnel in several novels.{{sfn|Black|2005|pp=53–54}} Uncertain and shifting geopolitics led Fleming to replace the Russian organisation SMERSH with the international terrorist group SPECTRE in ''Thunderball'', permitting "evil unconstrained by ideology".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=50}} Black argues that SPECTRE provides a measure of continuity to the remaining stories in the series.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=49}}

==== Effects of the war ====
A theme throughout the series was the effect of the Second World War.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=7}} ''The Times'' journalist Ben Macintyre considers that Bond was "the ideal antidote to Britain's postwar austerity, rationing and the looming premonition of lost power",{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|pp=85–86}} at a time when coal and many items of food were still rationed.&lt;ref name="Cook (2004)" /&gt; Fleming often used the war as a signal to establish good or evil in characters:{{sfn|Black|2005|p=20}}{{sfn|Black|2005|p=59}} in [[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)#"For Your Eyes Only"|''For Your Eyes Only'']], the villain, Hammerstein, is a former [[Gestapo]] officer, while the sympathetic [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] officer, Colonel Johns, served with the British under [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Montgomery]] in the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|Eighth Army]].{{sfn|Black|2005|p=41}} Similarly, in ''Moonraker'', Drax (Graf Hugo von der Drache) is a "megalomaniac German Nazi who masquerades as an English gentleman",{{sfn|Black|2005|p=81}} and his assistant, Krebs, bears the same name as Hitler's last Chief of Staff.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=20}} In this, Fleming "exploits another British cultural antipathy of the 1950s. Germans, in the wake of the Second World War, made another easy and obvious target for bad press."{{sfn|Black|2005|p=81}} As the series progressed, the threat of a re-emergent Germany was overtaken by concerns about the Cold War, and the novels changed their focus accordingly.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=x}}

==== Comradeship ====
Periodically in the series, the topic of comradeship or friendship arises, with a male ally who works with Bond on his mission.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=86}} Raymond Benson believes that the relationships Bond has with his allies "add another dimension to Bond's character, and ultimately, to the thematic continuity of the novels".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=87}} In ''Live and Let Die'', agents Quarrel and [[Felix Leiter|Leiter]] represent the importance of male friends and allies, seen especially in  Bond's response to the shark attack on Leiter; Benson observes that "the loyalty Bond feels towards his friends is as strong as his commitment to his job".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=96}} In ''Dr. No'', Quarrel is "an indispensable ally".{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=67}} Benson sees no evidence of discrimination in their relationship{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=112}} and notes Bond's genuine remorse and sadness at Quarrel's death.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=110}}

==== The "traitor within" ====
From the opening novel in the series, the theme of treachery was strong. Bond's target in ''Casino Royale'', [[Le Chiffre]], was the paymaster of a French communist trade union, and the overtones of a fifth column struck a chord with the largely British readership, as Communist influence in the trade unions had been an issue in the press and parliament,{{sfn|Black|2005|p=5}} especially after the defections of Burgess and Maclean in 1951.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=221}} The "traitor within" theme continued in ''Live and Let Die'' and ''Moonraker''.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=16}}

==== Good versus evil ====
Raymond Benson considered the most obvious theme of the series to be good versus evil.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=86}} This crystallised in ''Goldfinger'' with the [[Saint George]] motif, which is stated explicitly in the book:{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=231}} "Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time, it really was St George and the dragon. And St George had better get a move on and do something";{{sfn|Fleming|2006|loc=ch 18}} Black notes that the image of St. George is an English, rather than British personification.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=39}}

==== Anglo-American relations ====
The Bond novels also dealt with the question of Anglo-American relations, reflecting the central role of the US in the defence of the West.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=6}} In the aftermath of the Second World War, tensions surfaced between a British government trying to retain its empire and the American desire for a capitalist new world order, but Fleming did not focus on this directly, instead creating "an impression of the normality of British imperial rule and action".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=7}} Author and journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]] observed that "the central paradox of the classic Bond stories is that, although superficially devoted to the Anglo-American war against communism, they are full of contempt and resentment for America and Americans".&lt;ref name="Hitchens (2006)" /&gt; Fleming was aware of this tension between the two countries, but did not focus on it strongly.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=7}} Kingsley Amis, in his exploration of Bond in ''[[The James Bond Dossier]]'', pointed out that "Leiter, such a nonentity as a piece of characterization&amp;nbsp;... he, the American, takes orders from Bond, the Britisher, and that Bond is constantly doing better than he".{{sfn|Amis|1966|p=90}}

For three of the novels, ''Goldfinger'', ''Live and Let Die'' and ''Dr. No'', it is Bond the British agent who has to sort out what turns out to be an American problem,{{sfn|Black|2005|pp=38–39}} and Black points out that although it is American assets that are under threat in ''Dr. No'', a British agent and a British warship, HMS ''Narvik'', are sent with British soldiers to the island at the end of the novel to settle the matter.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=33}} Fleming became increasingly jaundiced about America, and his comments in the penultimate novel ''You Only Live Twice'' reflect this;{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=187}} Bond's responses to Tanaka's comments reflect the declining relationship between Britain and America—in sharp contrast to the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=62}}

In the late 1950s the author [[Geoffrey Jenkins]] had suggested to Fleming that he write a Bond novel set in South Africa, and sent him his own idea for a plot outline which, according to Jenkins, Fleming felt had great potential.&lt;ref name="KKBB: PFO" /&gt; After Fleming's death, Jenkins was commissioned by Bond publishers [[Ian Fleming Publications|Glidrose Productions]] to write a [[continuation novel|continuation]] Bond novel, ''[[Per Fine Ounce]]'', but it was never published.{{sfn|Lane|Simpson|2000|p=433}} Starting with Kingsley Amis's ''[[Colonel Sun]]'', under the pseudonym "[[Robert Markham]]" in 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Colonel Sun|url=http://www.ianfleming.com/the-books/colonel-sun/|work=The Books|publisher=[[Ian Fleming Publications]]|accessdate=21 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; several authors have been commissioned to write Bond novels, including [[Sebastian Faulks]], who was asked by [[Ian Fleming Publications]] to write a new Bond novel in observance of what would have been Fleming's 100th birthday in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Faulks pens new James Bond novel|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6289186.stm|accessdate=13 December 2011|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|location=London|date=11 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his lifetime Fleming sold thirty million books; double that number were sold in the two years following his death.&lt;ref name="Lycett (DNB)" /&gt; In 2008 ''The Times'' ranked Fleming fourteenth on its list of "The 50 greatest British writers since 1945".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Macintyre|first=Ben|authorlink=Ben Macintyre|title=14.

The Eon Productions series of Bond films, which started in 1962 with ''Dr. No'', continued after Fleming's death. Along with two non-Eon produced films, there have been twenty four Eon films, with the most recent, ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]'', released in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Masters|first=Tim|title=James Bond: Skyfall opens new chapter for 007|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15579556|accessdate=4 November 2011|newspaper=[[BBC News]]|location=London|date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Eon Productions series has grossed over $6.2 billion worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing film series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Movie Franchises|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/series/franchisesW.php|work=The Numbers|publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
Ibn Taymiyyah's full name is ''Taqī ad-Dīn Abu 'l-`Abbās Ahmad ibn `Abd al-Ḥalīm ibn `Abd as-Salām ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Khidr ibn Muhammad ibn al-Khidr ibn `Ali ibn ʿAbd Allāh ibn Taymiyyah al-Ḥarrānī''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ({{lang-ar| تقي الدين أبو العباس أحمد بن عبد الحليم بن عبد السلام بن عبد الله بن الخضر بن محمد بن الخضر بن على بن عبد الله ابن تيمية الحراني}}).

Ibn Taymiyyah's name is unusual in that it is derived from a female member of his family as opposed to a male member, which was the normal custom at the time and still is now. Taymiyyah was a woman, famous for her scholarship and piety and the name Ibn Taymiyyah was taken up by many of her male descendants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Overview ==
Ibn Taymiyyah had a simple life, most of which he dedicated to learning, writing, and teaching. He never married nor did he have a female companion, throughout his years.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite book|title=Unholy War: Terror in the Name of Islam|last=Esposito|first=John L.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-19-516886-0|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Matroudi says that this may be why he was able to engage fully with the political affairs of his time without holding any official position such as that of a judge.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; An offer of an official position was made to him but he never accepted.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; His life was that of a religious scholar and a political activist.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; In his efforts he was persecuted and imprisoned on six different occasions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Islam and the Secular State: Negotiating the Future of Shari`a|last=An-Na`im|first=Abdullahi Ahmed|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2010|isbn=0-674-03456-2|pages=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the total time spent inside prison coming to over six years.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Other sources say that he spent over twelve years in prison.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0108|title=Ibn Taymīyah, Taqī al-Dīn Aḥmad |date=2015-02-14|accessdate=February 14, 2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press|last=Al-Matroudi|first=Abdul-Hakim}}&lt;/ref&gt; His detentions were due to certain elements of his creed and his views on some jurisprudential issues.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; However according to Yahya Michot, "the real reasons were more trivial". Michot gives five reasons as to why Ibn Taymiyyah was imprisoned, they being: not complying with the "doctrines and practices prevalent among powerful religious and Sufi establishments, an overly outspoken personality, the jealousy of his peers, the risk to public order due to this popular appeal and political intrigues."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Baber Johansen, a professor at the Harvard divinity school says that the reasons for Ibn Taymiyyah's incarcerations were, "as a result of his conflicts with Muslim mystics, jurists, and theologians, who were able to persuade the political authorities of the necessity to limit Ibn Taymiyyah's range of action through political censorship and incarceration."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Ibn Taymiyyah's own relationship, as a religious scholar, with the ruling apparatus, who did deviate in application of shari'a law, was not always amicable.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; It ranged from silence to open rebellion.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; On occasions when he shared the same views and aims as the ruling authorities, his contributions were welcomed but when Ibn Taymiyyah went against the status quo, he was seen as "uncooperative" and on occasions spent much time in prison.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah's attitude towards his own rulers, was based on the actions of the companions (sahaba) when they made an oath of allegiance to Muhammad as follows; "to obey within obedience to God, even if the one giving the order is unjust; to abstain from disputing the authority of those who exert it; and to speak out the truth, or take up its cause without fear in respect of God, of blame from anyone."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Early years ==
=== Background ===
His father had the Hanbali chair in Harran and later at the Great mosque of Damascus ([[Umayyad Mosque]]). Harran was a city part of the [[Sultanate of Rum]], now Harran is a small city on the border of [[Syria]] and Turkey, currently in [[Şanlıurfa Province|Şanlıurfa province]], a place to which Moses was reportedly sent to provide guidance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Before its [[Mongol invasions of Anatolia|destruction by the Mongols]], Harran was also well known since the early days of Islam for its [[Hanbalism|Hanbali]] school and tradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tadhkirat al-huffaz|last=Al-Dhahabi|first=Muhammad ibn Ahmad |location=Haidarabad|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which Ibn Taymiyyah's family belonged.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics|last=Hastings|first=James|publisher=Morrison and Gibb Limited|year=1908 |pages=72|volume=Volume;7}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, Abu al-Barkat Majd ad-Din ibn Taymiyyah al-Hanbali (d. 1255) and his uncle, Fakhr al-Din (d. 1225) were reputable scholars of the [[Hanbali]] [[Madh'hab|school of law]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ibn-taymiyya-SIM_3388|title="Ibn Taymiyya." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition.|date=2012|accessdate=2015-01-28|publisher=BrillOnline|last=Laoust|first=Henri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the scholarly achievements of ibn Taymiyyah's father, Shihab al-deen 'Abd al-Halim ibn Taymiyyah (d. 1284) were also well known.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=6}} According to the book 'Rethinking Islamic Studies' edited by Carl W. Ernst and Richard C. Martin, Ibn Taymiyyah believed, non-[[Arab]] Muslims are inferior to [[Arab]] Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ernst, Martin|first1=Carl W., Richard C.|title=Rethinking Islamic Studies: From Orientalism to Cosmopolitanism|url=https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=YjoMCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT137&amp;dq=ibn+taymiyyah+arab+superiority&amp;hl=tr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj4tbH1erJAhXEgg8KHb7_CzkQ6AEIJDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=ibn%20taymiyyah%20arab%20superiority&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration to Damascus ===
In 1269, Ibn Taymiyyah, at the age of seven together with his father and three brothers left the city of Harran which was completely destroyed by the ensuing Mongol invasion.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=6}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah's family moved and settled in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], which at the time was ruled by the [[Mamluk]]s of [[Egypt]].

=== Education ===
In Damascus, his father served as the director of the Sukkariyya madrasa, a place where Ibn Taymiyyah also received his early education.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Studia missionalia|last=Michel|first=Thomas|publisher=Pontificia Università Gregorian|year=1985 |location=Rome, Italy |volume=Volume 34|chapter=Ibn Taymiyya: Islamic Reformer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah acquainted himself with the [[Science in medieval Islam|religious and secular sciences]] of his time. His religious studies began in his early teens, when he committed the entire Qur'an to memory and later on came to learn the Islamic disciplines of the Qur'an.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=6}} From his father he learnt the religious science of [[Fiqh]] (jurisprudence) and [[Usul al-Fiqh]] (principles of jurisprudence).{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=6}} Ibn Taymiyyah learnt the works of [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], [[Abu Bakr al-Khallal|al-Khallal]], [[Ibn Qudamah]] and also the works of his grandfather, Abu al-Barakat Majd ad-Din.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His study of jurisprudence was not limited to the Hanbali tradition but he also learnt the other schools of jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The number of scholars under which he studied [[Hadith]] is said to number more than two hundred,&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Al-'Uqud ad-Dariat|last=Al-Dimashqi al-Hanbali |first =Ibn `Abdul-Hadi |pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; four of whom were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shadharat al-Dhahab|last=Al-Hanbali|first=Ibn al-`Imad |year=1932 |location=Cairo|pages=385, 383, 404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who are known by name amount to forty hadith teachers, as recorded by Ibn Taymiyyah in his book called ''Arba`un Hadithan''.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=38–44}} Serajul Haque says, based on this, Ibn Taymiyyah started to hear hadith from the age of five.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=38–44}} One of his teachers was the first Hanbali Chief Justice of Syria, Shams ud-Din Al-Maqdisi who held the newly created position instituted by [[Baibars]] as part of a reform of the judiciary.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Al-Maqdisi later on, came to give Ibn Taymiyyah permission to issue Fatawa (legal verdicts) when he became a [[mufti]] at the age of 17.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Islamic Political Thought|last=Michot|first=Yahya|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=0-691-13484-7 |pages=238–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sharh Al-Aqeedat-il-Wasitiyah|last=Ibn Taimiya|first=Taqi ad-Din|publisher=Dar-us-Salam|year=1996 |pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Taymiyyah's secular studies led him to devote attention to [[Arabic language]] and [[Arabic literature]] by studying Arabic grammar and [[lexicography]] under Ali ibn `Abd al-Qawi al-Tuft.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=6}}&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia|last=Leaman|first=Oliver|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2006|isbn=0-415-32639-7 |pages=280–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to master the famous book of Arabic grammar, Al-Kitab, by the Persian grammarian [[Sibawayhi]].{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=6}} He also studied mathematics, algebra, [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[theology]] ([[Ilm al-Kalam|kalam]]), philosophy, history and heresiography.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see aqidatul-waasitiyyah daarussalaam publications&lt;/ref&gt; The knowledge he gained from history and philosophy, he used to refute the prevalent philosophical discourses of his time, one of which was [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]].&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah learnt about [[Sufism]] and stated that he had reflected on the works of; [[Sahl al-Tustari]], [[Junayd of Baghdad]], [[Abu Talib al-Makki]], [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]], [[Abu Hafs Umar al-Suhrawardi]] and [[Ibn Arabi]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  At the age of 20 in the year 1282, Ibn Taymiyyah completed his education.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=8}}

== Life as a scholar ==
[[File:Flickr - …trialsanderrors - Minaret of the Bride, Damascus, Holy Land, ca. 1895.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Umayyad Mosque, a place where Ibn Taimiyya used to give lessons.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;]]
After his father died in 1284, he took up the then vacant post as the head of the Sukkariyya madrasa and began giving lessons on Hadith.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t342/e0217|title="Ibn Taymīyah, Taqī al-Dīn Aḥmad."

The Hanbali school was seen as the most traditional school out of the four legal systems ([[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]] and [[Shafi'i|Shafii]]) because it was "suspicious of the [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenist]] disciplines of philosophy and [[Ilm al-Kalam|speculative theology]]."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; He remained faithful throughout his life to this school, whose doctrines he had mastered, but he nevertheless called for [[ijtihad]] (independent reasoning by one who is qualified) and discouraged taqlid.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=8}}

=== Relationship with authorities ===
Ibn Taymiyyah's emergence into the public and political sphere began in 1293 at the age of 30, when he was asked by the authorities to give an Islamic legal verdict (Fatwa) on Assaf al-Nasrani, a Christian cleric accused of insulting Muhammad.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Crusades: Islamic Perspectives|last=Hillenbrand|first=Carole|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=1999|isbn=0-7486-0630-0 |pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=slam and Inter-Faith Relations: The Gerald Weisfeld Lectures 2006|last=Schmidt-Leukel|first=Perry|publisher=SCM Press|year=2007|isbn=0-334-04132-5 |pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accepted the invitation and delivered his fatwa, calling for the man to receive the death penalty.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Despite the fact that public opinion was very much on Ibn Taymiyyah's side,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; the Governor of Syria attempted to resolve the situation by asking Assaf to accept Islam in return for his life, to which he agreed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This resolution was not acceptable to Ibn Taymiyyah who then, together with his followers, protested outside the Governor's palace demanding Assaf be put to death,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; on the grounds that any person—Muslim or non-Muslim—who insults Muhammad must be killed.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This unwillingness to compromise coupled with his attempt to protest against the Governor's actions, resulted in him being punished with a prison sentence, the first of many such imprisonments to come.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The French orientalist [[Henri Laoust]] says that during this incarceration Ibn Taymiyyah "wrote his first great work, ''al-Ṣārim al-maslūl ʿalā s̲h̲ātim al-Rasūl (The Drawn Sword against those who insult the Messenger).''"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah, together with the help of his disciples, continued with his efforts against what, "he perceived to be un-Islamic practices" and to implement what he saw as his religious duty of commanding good and forbidding wrong.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Rapoport|first=Yossef|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |isbn=0-19-547834-7 |last2=Ahmed |first2=Shahab|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yahya Michot says that some of these incidences included: "shaving children's heads", leading "an anti-debauchery campaign in brothels and taverns", hitting an atheist before his public execution, destroying what was thought to be a sacred rock in a mosque, attacking astrologers and obliging "deviant Sufi Shaykhs to make public acts of contrition and to adhere to the Sunnah."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah and his disciples used to condemn wine sellers and they would attack wine shops in Damascus by breaking wine bottles and pouring them onto the floor.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Bori|first=Caterina|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=0-19-547834-7 |chapter=Ibn Taymiyya wa-Jama`atuhu: Authority, Conflict and Consensus in Ibn Taymiyya's Circle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years later in 1296, he took over the position of one of his teachers (Zayn al-Din Ibn al-Munadjdjaal), taking the post of professor of Hanbali jurisprudence at the Hanbaliyya madrasa, the oldest such institution of this tradition in Damascus.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=State and Government in Medieval Islam: An Introduction to the Study of Islamic Political Theory|last=K.

The Mamluk sultan [[Al-Adil Kitbugha]] was deposed by his vice-sultan [[Lajin|Al-Malik al-Mansur Lajin]] who then ruled from 1297 to 1299.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=State Formation and the Structure of Politics in Mamluk Syro-Egypt, 648-741 A.H./1250-1340 C.E.|last=Williams Clifford|first=Winslow|publisher=V&amp;r Unipress|year=2013|isbn=3-8471-0091-2|pages=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lajin had a desire to commission an expedition against the Christians of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] who formed an alliance with the [[Mongol Empire]] and taking part of the military campaign which lead to the destruction of Baghdad the capital of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and Harran the birthplace of Ibn Taymiyyah, for that purpose he urged Ibn Taymiyyah to call the Muslims to Jihad.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 1298, Ibn Taymiyyah wrote an explanation of the ayat al-mutashabihat (the unclear verses of the Qur'an) called Al-`Aqidat al-Hamawiyat al-Kubra (The creed of the great people of Hama).{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=9}}&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;{{cite book|title=Islamic Philosophy and Theology|last=Watt|first=William Montgomery|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2008|isbn=0-202-36272-8 |pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is about divine attributes and it served as an answer to a question from the city of [[Hama]], Syria.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=9}}&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt; At that particular time [[Ash'ari]]tes held prominent positions within the Islamic scholarly community in both Syria and Egypt, and they held a certain position on the divine attributes of God.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=9}} Ibn Taymiyyah in his book strongly disagreed with their views and this heavy opposition to the common Ash'ari position, caused considerable controversy.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=9}}

Ibn Taymiyyah collaborated once more with the Mamluks in 1300, when he joined the expedition against the [[Alawites]] , in the Kasrawan region of the [[Mount Lebanon|Lebanese mountains]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah thought of the Alawites as "more heritical yet than Jews and Christians,"&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Everyday Jihad: The Rise of Militant Islam Among Palestinians in Lebanon|last=Rougier|first=Bernard|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2008|isbn=0-674-03066-4 |pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; (بالنصيرية هم وسائر أصناف القرامطة الباطنية أكفر من اليهود والنصارى ; بل وأكفر من كثير من المشركين),&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah [Majmoo` al-Fatawa 35/145] [http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?flag=1&amp;bk_no=22&amp;ID=6111][https://archive.org/stream/mjftitdrwf/mft35#page/n89/mode/2up إبن تيمية مجموع الفتاوي ٣٥/١٤٥][https://shaykhulislaam.wordpress.com/2009/08/13/ruling-on-the-nusayrialawi-sect/ English translation of the Fatwa]&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Carole Hillenbrand, the confrontation with the Alawites resulted because they "were accused of collaboration with Christians and Mongols."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyya had further active involvements in campaigns against the Mongols and their alleged Alawite allies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Second expedition against the Alawites ===
Ibn Taymiyyah took part in a second military offensive in 1305 against the Alawites and the [[Isma'ilism|Isma`ilis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic Societies to the Nineteenth Century: A Global History|last=Lapidus|first=Ira M.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=0-521-73298-0 |pages=295}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Kasrawan region of the Lebanese mountains where they were defeated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=10}} The Alawis eventually left the region to settle in southern Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lebanon Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments |publisher=Int'l Business Publications|year=2012|isbn=0-7397-3913-1 |pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Involvement in Mongol invasion ==
[[File:Mongol raids into Syria and Palestine ca 1300.svg|thumb|300px|Mongol invasion of Syria]]

=== First invasions ===
The first invasion took place between December 1299 and April 1300 due to the military campaign by the Mamluks against the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia who were allied with the Mongols.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/jhoover363/taymiyyan-studies/jihad-against-the-mongols|title=Taymiyyan Studies|date=|accessdate=February 14, 2015 |last=Hoover|first=Jon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ilkhanate army managed to reach Damascus by the end of December 1299.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah went with a delegation of Islamic scholars to talk to [[Ghazan|Ghazan Khan]], who was the [[Khan (title)|Khan]] of the Mongol [[Ilkhanate]] of Iran, to plead clemency&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; and to stop his attack on the Muslims. It is reported that none of the scholars said anything to the Khan except Ibn Taymiyyah who said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;You claim that you are Muslim and you have with you [[Muezzin|Mu'adhdhins]], [[Mufti]]s, [[Imam]]s and [[Sheikh|Shaykhs]] but you invaded us and reached our country for what? While your father and your grandfather, [[Hulagu Khan|Hulagu]] were non-believers, they did not attack and they kept their promise. But you promised and broke your promise.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By early January 1300, the Mongol allies, the Armenians and Georgians, had caused widespread damage to Damascus and they had taken Syrian prisoners.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; The Mongols effectively occupied Damascus for the first four months of 1303.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Most of the military had fled the city, including most of the civilians.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah however, stayed and was one of the leaders of the resistance inside Damascus and he went to speak directily to the Mongol Ilkhan [[Ghazan|Mahmud Ghazan]] and his vizier [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid al-Din Tabib]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; He sought the release of Muslim and [[dhimmi]] prisoners which the Mongols had taken in Syria, and after discussion, secured their release.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;[[File:Ghazan's feast.jpg|thumb|300px|left|An artist illustrated of [[Ghazan Khan]], a historical figure harshly rebuked by Ibn Taymiyyah, mainly due to his constant state of hostility towards the [[Mamluk]]s of [[Egypt]].]]

=== Second Mongol invasion ===
The second invasion lasted between October 1300 and January 1301.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah at this time began giving sermons on Jihad at the Umayyad mosque.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah also spoke to and encouraged the Governor of Damscus, al-Afram to achieve a victory against the Mongols.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; He became involved with al-Afram once more, when he was sent to get reinforcements from Cairo.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;

=== Third invasion and fatwa ===
The year 1303 saw the third [[Mongol invasions of the Levant|Mongol invasion]] of Syria by [[Ghazan]] Khan.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://mamluk.uchicago.edu/MamlukStudiesReview_XI-2_2007.pdf |title=The Mongol Invasions of Bilād al-Shām by Ghāzān Khān and Ibn Taymīyah's Three "Anti-Mongol" Fatwas|last=Aigle|first=Denise|date=2007|journal=Mamluk Studies Review|access-date=January 29, 2015|publisher=The University of Chicago|page=Page 105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Muslims, Mongols and Crusaders|last=Hawting|first=Gerald|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0-7007-1393-X|location=|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; What has been called Ibn Taymiyyah's "most famous" ''[[fatwā]]''&lt;ref name="Janin, Hunt p.79"&gt;Janin, Hunt.

Publishers, 2007 p.79&lt;/ref&gt; was issued against the Mongols in the [[Mamluk#Mamluks and the Mongols|Mamluk's war]]. Ibn Taymiyyah declared that jihad against the Mongol attack on the Malmuk sultanate was not only permissible, but [[Fard|obligatory]].&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The reason being that the Mongols could not, in his opinion, be true Muslims despite the fact that they had converted to Sunni Islam because they ruled using what he considered 'man-made laws' (their traditional [[Yassa]] code) rather than Islamic law or ''Sharia'', whilst believing that the Yassa code was better than the Sharia law. Because of this, he reasoned they were living in a state of [[jahiliyyah]], or [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] [[Arabian mythology|pagan ignorance]].&lt;ref name="Kepel, Gilles 2003 p.194"&gt;Kepel, Gilles, ''The Prophet and the Pharaoh'', (2003), p.194&lt;/ref&gt; The fatwa broke new Islamic legal ground because "no jurist had ever before issued a general authorization for the use of lethal force against Muslims in battle," and was to influence modern [[Islamist]]s in the use of violence against self-proclaimed Muslims.&lt;ref name=kadri-&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012 |publisher=macmillan |isbn=978-0-09-952327-7|page=187|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Taymiyyah called on the Muslims to Jihad once again and he also personally joined the eventual [[Battle of Marj al-Saffar (1303)|battle of Marj al-Saffar]] against the Mongol army.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The battle began on 20 April of that year.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; On the same day, Ibn Taymiyyah declared a fatwa which exempted Mamluk soldiers from the fast during the month of Ramadan so that they could maintain their strength.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Within two days the Mongols were severely defeated and the battle was won.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Facing charges against his literalism ==
Ibn Taymiyah was imprisoned several times for conflicting with the ''[[ijma]]'' of jurists and theologians of his day. From the city of [[Wasit, Iraq|Wasit]], [[Iraq]], a judge requested that Ibn Taymiyyah write a book on creed which led to him writing his book, for which he faced troubles, called ''[[Al-Aqidah Al-Waasitiyyah]], ''a work on'' ''his view of the [[ʿAqīdah|creed (`aqidah)]] of the salaf which included reference to the divine attributes of God.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah adopted the view that God should be described as he was literally described in the Qur'an and in the hadith,&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; and that all Muslims were required to believe this because according to him it was the view held by the early Muslim community (salaf).&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Law Applied: Contextualizing the Islamic Shari'a|last=Bearman|first=Peri|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2007|isbn=1-84511-736-0 |pages=263–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the space of two years (1305–1306) four separate religious council hearings were held to assess the correctness of his creed.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== 1305 hearing ===
The first hearing was held with the [[Shafi'i|Shafii]] scholars who accused Ibn Taymiyyah of [[anthropomorphism]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; At the time Ibn Taymiyyah was 42 years old. He was protected by the then Governor of Damascus, Aqqush al-Afram, during the proceedings.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The scholars suggested that he accept that his creed was simply that of the Hanbalites and offered this as a way out of the charge.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The issue being, if Ibn Taymiyyah ascribed his creed to the Hanbali school of law then it would be just one view out of the four schools which one could follow rather than a creed everybody must adhere to.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah was uncompromising and maintained that it was obligatory for all scholars to adhere to his creed.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== 1306 hearings and imprisonment ===
Two separate councils were held a year later on 22 and 28 of January 1306.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The first council was in the house of the Governor of Damascus Aqqush al-Afram, who had protected him the year before when facing the Shafii scholars.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A second hearing was held six days later where the Indian scholar Safi al-Din al-Hindi found him innocent of all charges and accepted that his creed was in line with the "Qur'an and the Sunna".&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Regardless, in April 1306 the chief Islamic judges of the Mamluk state declared Ibn Taymiyyah guilty and he was incarcerated.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; He was released four months later in September.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Further objections after release ===
After his release in Damascus, the doubts regarding his creed seemed to have resolved but this was not the case.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A Shafii scholar, Ibn al-Sarsari, was insistent on starting another hearing against Ibn Taymiyyah which was held once again at the house of the Governor of Damascus, Al-Afram.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His book ''Al-Aqidah Al-Waasitiyyah'' was still not found at fault.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At the conclusion of this hearing, Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al-Sarsari were sent to Cairo to settle the problem.

== Life in Egypt ==
=== Debate on literalism and imprisonment ===
On arrival of Ibn Taymiyyah and the Shafi'ite scholar in Cairo in 1306, an open meeting was held.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=10}} The Sultan of Egypt at the time was [[Al-Nasir Muhammad]] and his deputy attended the open meeting.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=10}} Ibn Taymiyyah was found innocent.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=10}} Despite the open meeting, objections regarding his creed continued and he was summoned to the Citadel in Cairo for a Munazara (legal debate), which took place on 8 April 1306. During the Munazara his views on divine attributes, specifically whether a direction could be attributed to God, were debated by the Indian Scholar Safi al-Din al-Hindi, in the presence of Islamic judges.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=11}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah failed to convince the judges of his position and so on the recommendation of Al-Hindi was incarcerated for the charge of anthropomorphism.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=11}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thereafter, he together with his two brothers were imprisoned in the Citadel of the mountain (Qal'at al-Jabal), in Cairo until 25 September 1307.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=VII}}&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=11}} He was freed due to the help he received from two Amirs (ruler or military ruler); Salar and [[Muhanna ibn Isa]], but he was not allowed to go back to Syria.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was then, again summoned for a legal debate but this time he convinced the judges of his views and he was allowed to go free.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=11}}

=== Trial for intercession and imprisonment ===
[[File:Porte de la citadelle et mosquee Mouhammed Aly.jpg|300px|thumb|left|[[Citadel of Cairo]], the place where Ibn Taymiyyah was imprisoned for 18 months]]
Ibn Taymiyyah continued to face troubles for his views which were found to be at odds with those of his contemporaries. His strong opposition to what he believed to be un-Islamic innovation ([[bid'ah]]), caused upset among the prominent Sufis of Egypt including Ibn `Ata'Allah and Karim al-Din al-Amuli, and the locals who started to protest against Ibn Taymiyyah.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The nature of the point under contention was Ibn Taymiyyah's stance on [[Tawassul|tawassul (intercession)]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In his view a person could not ask anyone other than God for help except on the day of judgement when intercession in his view would be possible. At the time, the people did not restrict intercession to just the day of judgement but rather they said it was allowed in other cases. Due to this Ibn Taymiyyah, now 45, was ordered to appear before the Shafii judge Badr al-Din in March 1308 and was questioned on his stance regarding intercession.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thereafter, he was incarcerated in the prison of the judges in Cairo for some months.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After his release, he was allowed to return to Syria, should he so wish.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah however stayed in Egypt for a further 5 years.

=== House arrest in Alexandria ===
The year after his release in 1309 saw a change of power to a new Sultan in Egypt, [[Baibars II|Baibars al-Jashnakir]] whose reign was marked by economical and political unrest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His hold on power was short lived and lasted only a year. During this time, in August 1309, Ibn Taymiyyah was taken into custody and placed under house arrest for seven months in the new sultan's palace in [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was freed when Al-Nasir Muhammad retook the position of sultan on 4 March 1310.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Having returned to Cairo a week later, he was received by the sultan Al-Nasir.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The sultan would sometimes consult Ibn Taymiyyah on religious affairs and policies during the rest of his three-year stay in Cairo.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During this time he continued to teach and wrote his famous book Al-''Kitab al-Siyasa al-shar'iyya'' ''(Treatise on the Government of the Religious Law)'', a book noted for its account of the role of religion in politics.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fifty Key Figures in Islam|last=Jackson|first=Roy|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|isbn=0-415-35468-4 |pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=New Political Religions, Or an Analysis of Modern Terrorism|last=Cooper|first=Barry|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2005|isbn=0-8262-1621-8 |pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Return to Damascus and later years ==
He spent his last fifteen years in Damascus. Ibn Taymiyyah at the age of 50 returned to Damascus on 28 February 1313 by way of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Damascus was now under the governorship of [[Tankiz]]. In Damascus Ibn Taymiyyah continued his teaching role as professor of Hanbali fiqh. This is when he taught his most famous student, [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]], who went on to become a noted scholar in Islamic history.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ibn Qayyim was to share in Ibn Taymiyyah's renewed persecution.

Three years after his arrival in the city, Ibn Taymiyyah became involved in efforts to deal with the increasing Shia influence amongst Sunni Muslims.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; An agreement had been made in 1316 between the amir of Mecca and the Ilkhanate ruler [[Öljaitü]], brother of Ghazan Khan, to allow a favourable policy towards Shi'ism in [[Mecca]], a city that houses the holiest site in Islam, the [[Kaaba]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Around the same time the Shia theologian [[Al-Hilli]], who had played a crucial role in the Mongol rulers decision to make Shi'ism the state religion of Persia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Islam: The Key Concepts |last=Ali |first=Kecia |publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=0-415-39639-5 |pages=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rationalism in the School of Bahrain: A Historical Perspective, in Shīʻite Heritage: Essays on Classical and Modern Traditions |last=Clarke|first=Lynda|publisher=Global Academic Publishing|year=2001 |pages=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote the book, [[Minhaj al-karamah|''Minhaj al-Karamah'']]'' (''The Way of Charisma'),&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; which dealt with the Shia doctrine of the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imamate]] and also served as a refutation of the Sunni doctrine of the [[caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Formation of the Classical Tafsīr Tradition|last=A. Saleh |first=Walid|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|year=2004|isbn=9004127771 |pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter this Ibn Taymiyyah wrote his famous book, ''[[Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah]]'', as a refutation of Al-Hilli's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Medieval Islamic Historiography: Remembering Rebellion|last=N. Keaney|first=Heather|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=0-415-82852-X |pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fatwa on divorce and imprisonment ===
In 1318, Ibn Taymiyyah wrote a treatise that would curtail the ease with which a Muslim man could [[Divorce in Islam|divorce]] his wife. Ibn Taymiyyah's fatwa on divorce was not accepted by the majority of scholars of the time and this continued into the [[Ottoman Caliphate|Ottoman era]].&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Saleh|first=Walid|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=0-19-547834-7 |chapter=Ibn Tayimiyah and the Rise of Radical Hermeneutics: An Analysis of "An Introduction to the Foundation of Quranic Exegesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, almost every modern Muslim nation-state has come to adopt Ibn Taymiyyah's position on this issue of divorce.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; At the time he issued the fatwa, Ibn Taymiyyah revived an edict by the sultan not to issue fatwas on this issue but he continued to do so, saying, "I cannot conceal my knowledge".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=12}} As in previous instances, he stated that his fatwa was based on the Qur'an and hadith. His view on the issue was at odds with the Hanbali doctrine.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This proved controversial among the people in Damascus as well as the Islamic scholars and the authorities who were against him on the issue.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mamluks in Egyptian and Syrian Politics and Society|last=Winter|first=Michael|publisher=BRILL|year=2004|isbn=9004132864|pages=191–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the scholars of the time, an oath of divorce counted as a full divorce and they were also of the view that three oaths of divorce taken under one occasion counted as three separate divorces.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The significance of this was, that a man who divorces the same partner three times is no longer allowed to remarry that person until and if that person marries and divorces another man.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Only then could the man, who took the oath, remarry his previous wife.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah accepted this but rejected the validity of three oaths taken under one sitting to count as three separate divorces as long as the intention was not to divorce.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Moreover, Ibn Taymiyyah was of the view that a single oath of divorce uttered but not intended, also does not count as an actual divorce.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He stated that since this is an oath much like an oath taken in the name of God, a person must expiate for an unintentional oath in a similar manner.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Due to his views and also by not abiding to the sultan's letter two years before forbidding him from issuing a fatwa on the issue, three council hearing were held, in as many years (1318, 1319 and 1320), to deal with this matter.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The hearing were overseen by the Viceroy of Syria, Tankiz.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This resulted in Ibn Taymiyyah being imprisoned on 26 August 1320 in the [[Citadel of Damascus]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was released about five months and 8 days later,{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=12}} on 9 February 1321, by order of the Sultan Al-Nasir.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah was reinstated as teacher of Hanbali law and he resumed teaching.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=12}}

=== Risāla on visiting tombs and final imprisonment ===
Ibn Taymiyyah had written a ''[[Risalah (fiqh)|risāla]]'' (a treatise) in 1310 called ''Ziyārat al-ḳubūr''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; or according to another source, ''Shadd al-rihal''.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=12}} It dealt with the validity and permissibility of making a journey to visit the tombs of prophets and [[Wali|saints]] (Wali).{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=12}} It is reported that in the book "he condemned the cult of saints".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He declared that, the one who visits the Prophet's grave commits innovation (bidah).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/cp/CP2.pdf|title=From Visiting Graves to Their Destruction: The Question of Ziyara through the Eyes of Salafis|last=Beranek|first=Ondrej|last2=Tupek|first2=Pavel|date=July 2009|publisher=Brandeis University.

=== Life in prison ===
[[File:Damaskus4.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The [[Citadel of Damascus]], the prison Ibn Taymiyyah died in]]
Ibn Taymiyyah referred to prison as "a divine blessing".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; During his incarceration he wrote that, "when a scholar forsakes what he knows of the Book of God and of the sunnah of his messenger and follows the ruling of a ruler which contravenes a ruling of God and his messenger, he is a renegade, an unbeliever who deserves to be punished in this world and in the hereafter."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Whilst in prison he faced opposition from the Maliki and Shafii Chief Justices of Damascus, Taḳī al-Dīn al-Ik̲h̲nāʾī.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He remained in prison for over two years and ignored the sultan's prohibition, by continuing to deliver fatwas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During his incarceration Ibn Taymiyyah wrote three works which are extant; ''Kitāb Maʿārif al-wuṣūl, Rafʿ al-malām'', and ''Kitāb al-Radd ʿala 'l-Ik̲h̲nāʾī'' (The response to al-Ik̲h̲nāʾī).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The last book was an attack on Taḳī al-Dīn al-Ik̲h̲nāʾī and explained his views on saints (wali).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Death ==
Ibn Taymiyyah fell ill in early September 1328 and died at the age of 65, on 26 September of that year, whilst in prison at the Citadel in Damascus.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Once this news reached the public, there was a strong show of support for him from the people.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=14}} After the authorities had given permission, it is reported that thousands of people came to show their respects.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=14}} They gathered in the Citadel and lined the streets up to the Umayyad mosque which was and is still close by.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=14}} A Janaza (funeral prayer) was held in the citadel by the sheikh, Muhammad Tammam, and a second was held in the mosque.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=14}} A third and final funeral prayer was held by Ibn Taymiyyah's brother, the sheikh, Zain al-Din.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=14}} He was buried in Damascus, in ''Maqbara Sufiyya'' (the cemetery of the Sufis). His brother Sharafuddin had been buried in that cemetery before him.&lt;ref&gt;George Makdisi, ''A Sufi of the Qadiriya Order'', p 123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Juan Eduardo Campo, ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', p 340. {{ISBN|1-4381-2696-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=15}}

Oliver Leaman says that being deprived of the means of writing led to Ibn Taymiyyah's death.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; It is reported that two hundred thousand men and fifteen to sixteen thousand women attended his funeral prayer.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Majallat al-Majma' al-'Ilmi al-'Arabi bi-Dimashq|last=`Anhuri|first=Salim |pages=11,193|volume=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Kathir says that in the history of Islam, only the funeral of Ahmad ibn Hanbal received a larger attendance.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; This is also mentioned by Ibn `Abd al-Hadi.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; Caterina Bori says that, "In the Islamic tradition, wider popular attendance at funerals was a mark of public reverence, a demonstration of the deceased's rectitude, and a sign of divine approbation."&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

Ibn Taymiyya is said to have "spent a lifetime objecting to tomb veneration, only to cast a more powerful posthumous spell than any of his Sufi contemporaries."&lt;ref name=kadri-135 /&gt; On his death, his personal effects were in such demand "that bidders for his lice-killing camphor necklace pushed its price up to 150 dirhams, and his skullcap fetched a full 500."&lt;ref name=kadri-135 /&gt;&lt;ref name=laoust /&gt; A few mourners sought and succeeded in "drinking the water used for bathing his corpse."&lt;ref name=kadri-135 /&gt;&lt;ref name=laoust&gt;Laoust, Henri, ''Essai sur les doctrines sociales et politiques de Taki-d-Din Ahmad b Timiya'', Cairo, 1939, pp.149–50&lt;/ref&gt; His tomb received "pilgrims and sightseers" for 600 years.&lt;ref name=kadri-135&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia … |date=2012 |publisher=macmillan |isbn=978-0-09-952327-7 |page=135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 600 years after his death, the large Sufi cemetery where he was buried in was razed for redevelopment by French colonial authorities.

== Students ==
Among those Ibn Taymiyyah taught, some went on to become accomplished Islamic Scholars.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; His students came from different backgrounds and belonged to various different schools (madhabs).&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; His most famous students were [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]] and [[Ibn Kathir]].&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e1167|title=Ibn Taymīyah, Taqī al-Dīn Aḥmad |date=2015-02-13|accessdate=February 14, 2015|website=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|last=Nettler|first=Ronald L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Qayyim wrote the famous poem "O Christ-Worshipper" which examined the dogma of the [[Trinity]] propounded by many [[Christian denomination|Christian sects]].

Many scholars have argued that Ibn Taymiyyah did not enjoy popularity among the intelligentsia of his day.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Taymiyya, Radical Polymath, Part I: Scholarly Perceptions (Religion Compass, 2015), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Yossef Rapoport and Shahab Ahmed assert that he was a minority figure in his own times and the centuries that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Yossef Rapoport and Shahab Ahmed, Introduction in Ibn Taymiyya and His Times, eds.

Ibn Taymiyyah's works served as an inspiration for later Muslim scholars and historical figures, who have been regarded as his admirers or disciples.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the contemporary world, he may be considered at the root of [[Wahhabism]], the [[Senussi]] order and other later reformist movements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"He has strongly influenced modern Islam for the last two centuries. He is the source of the Wahhābīyah, a reformist movement founded by [[Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab|Muḥammad ibn ʿAbd al-Wahhāb]] (died 1792), who took his ideas from Ibn Taymiyyah's writings. Ibn Taymiyyah also influenced various reform movements that have posed the problem of reformulating traditional ideologies by a return to sources.[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/280847/Ibn-Taymiyyah]&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah has been noted to have influenced [[Rashid Rida]], [[Maududi|Abul A`la Maududi]], [[Sayyid Qutb]], [[Hassan al-Banna]], [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]], and [[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t243/e147|title=Ibn Taymiyah |date=|accessdate=February 13, 2015|website=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|last=Esposito|first=John L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Faith Misplaced: The Broken Promise of U.S.-Arab Relations: 1820–2001|last=Makdisis|first=Ussama|publisher=PublicAffairs|year=2010|isbn=1-58648-680-2 |pages=322}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Islam in Revolution: Fundamentalism in the Arab World|last=Dekmejian|first=R.

== Influences ==
{{salafi|Ideology}}

Ibn Taymiyyah was taught by scholars who were renowned in their time.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=7}} However, there is no evidence that any of the contemporary scholars influenced him.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=7}}

A strong influence on Ibn Taymiyyah was the founder of the Hanbali school of Islamic jurisprudence, Ahmad ibn Hanbal.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=7}} Ibn Taymiyyah was trained in this school and he had studied Ibn Hanbal's [[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Musnad]] in great detail, having studied it over multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fawat al-Wafayat|last=Al-Kutubi|first=Shakir |year=1881 |pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he spent much of his life following this school, in the end he renounced [[taqlid]] (blind following).{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=8}}

His work was most influenced by the sayings and actions of the [[Salaf]] (first 3 generation of Muslims) and this showed in his work where he would give preference to the Salaf over his contemporaries.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=7}} The modern [[Salafi movement]] derives its name from this school of thought.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=7}}

== Views ==
=== God's Attributes ===
Ibn Taymiyyah said that God should be described as he has described himself in the Qur'an and the way Prophet Muhammad has described God in the Hadith.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; He rejected; the [[Ta'tili]]'s who denied these attributes, those who compare God with the creation ([[Tashbih]]) and those who engage in [[Esoteric interpretation of the Quran|esoteric interpretations]] (ta'wil) of the Qur'an or use symbolic exegesis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah said that those attributes which we know about from the two above mentioned sources, should be ascribed to God.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Anything regarding God's attributes which people have no knowledge of, should be approached in a manner, according to Ibn Taymiyyah, where the mystery of the unknown is left to God (called tafwid) and the Muslims submit themselves to the word of God and the Prophet (called taslim).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Henri Laoust says that through this framework, this doctrine, "provides authority for the widest possible scope in personal internationalization of religion."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1299,]

Ibn Taymiyyah wrote the book Al-Aqida al-hamawiyya al-kubra, which dealt with, among other topics, theology and creed. When he was accused of anthropomorphism, a private meeting was held between scholars in the house of Al-Din `Umar al-Kazwini who was a Shafii judge.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Islamic Theology, Philosophy and Law: Debating Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|last=Krawietz|first=Birgit|publisher=de Gruyter|year=2012|isbn=3-11-028534-7 |pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; After careful study of this book, he was cleared of those charges.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah also wrote another book dealing with the attributes of God called, ''Al-Aqidah Al-Waasitiyyah''. He faced considerable hostility towards these views from the Ash'ari's of whom the most notable were, [[Taqi al-Din al-Subki]] and his son [[Taj al-Din al-Subki]] who were influential Islamic jurists and also chief judge of Damascus in their respective times.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Ibn Taymiyyah's highly intellectual discourse at explaining "The Wise Purpose of God, Human Agency, and the Problems of Evil &amp; Justice" using God's attributes as a means has been illustrated by Dr. Jon Hoover in his work ''Ibn Taymiyyah's Theodicy of Perpetual Optimism''.&lt;ref name="Ibn Taymiyyah's Theodicy of Perpetual Optimism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoover|first=Jon|title=Ibn Taymiyya's Theodicy of Perpetual Optimism|year=2007|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004158474|pages=xii, 276|url=http://www.brill.nl/ibn-taymiyyas-theodicy-perpetual-optimism|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Duration of Hellfire ===
Ibn Taymiyyah held the belief that Hell was not eternal even for unbelievers.&lt;ref name="HooverIT"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoover|first=Jon|year=2016|title=Withholding judgment on Islamic universalism: Ibn al-Wazir (d. 840/1436) on the duration and purpose of hell-fire.

Ibn Taymiyyah was partially supported in his view by the [[Zaydi]] [[Shi'ite]] [[Ibn al-Wazir]].&lt;ref name="HooverIT"/&gt;

=== Sources of Shari'a ===
Of the four fundamental sources of the sharia accepted by thirteenth century Sunni jurists—
#[[Qur'an]],
#[[sunnah]],
#[[ijma|consensus of jurists (ijma)]], and
#[[qiyas]] (analogical reasoning),

—Ibn Taymiyyah opposed the use of consensus of jurists, replacing it with the consensus of the "companions" (''[[sahaba]]'').&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=kadri-130 /&gt;

Like all Islamic jurists Ibn Taymiyyah believed in a hierarchy sources for the Sharia. Most important was the Quran, and the sunnah or any other source could not abrogate a verse of the Qur'an.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=66-67}} (For him, [[Naskh (tafsir)|an abrogation of a verse]], known in Arabic as ''Naskh'', was only possible through another verse in the Qur'an.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=66-67}}) Next was sunnah which other sources (besides the Quran) must not contradict.

==== Consensus (ijma) ====
Concerning Consensus (''ijma''), he believed that consensus of any Muslims other than that of the companions of Muhammad could not be "realistically verifiable" and so was speculative,&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; and thus not a legitimate source of Islamic law (except in certain circumstances).&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The consensus (ijma) used must be that of the companions found in their reported sayings or actions.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=66-67}} According one supporter, Serajul Haque, his rejection of the consensus of other scholars was justified, on the basis of the instructions given to the jurist [[Shuraih Al-Qadhi|Shuraih ibn al-Hârith]] from the Caliph [[Umar]], one of the companions of Muhammad; to make decisions by first referring to the Qur'an, and if that is not possible, then to the sayings of the Prophet and finally to refer to the agreement of the companions like himself.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=66–67}}

An example of Ibn Taymiyyah use of his interpretation was in defense of the (temporary) closing of all Christian churches in 1299 in the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] of Egypt. The closing was in violation of a 600-year-old covenant with Christian ''[[dhimmi]]'' known as the [[Pact of Umar]]. But as Ibn Taymiyyah pointed out, while venerable, the pact was written 60 years or so after the time of the companions and so had no legal effect.&lt;ref name=kadri-130&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia … |date=2012 |publisher=macmillan |isbn=978-0-09-952327-7|pages=130–1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Analogy (qiyas) ====
Ibn Taymiyyah considered the use of analogy (qiyas) based on literal meaning of scripture as a valid source for deriving legal rulings.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=68}} Analogy is the primary instrument of legal rationalism in Islam.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; He acknowledged its use as one of the four fundamental [[principles of Islamic jurisprudence]].{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=67}} Ibn Taymiyyah argued against the certainty of [[syllogistic]] arguments and in favour of [[analogy]] (''[[qiyas]]''). He argues that concepts founded on induction are themselves not certain but only probable, and thus a syllogism based on such concepts is no more certain than an argument based on analogy. He further claimed that induction itself depends on a process of analogy. His model of analogical reasoning was based on that of juridical arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ruth Mas |title=Qiyas: A Study in Islamic Logic |journal=Folia Orientalia |volume=34 |pages=113–128 |year=1998 |url=http://www.colorado.edu/ReligiousStudies/faculty/mas/LOGIC.pdf |issn=0015-5675}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sowa"&gt;{{cite book|title=Conceptual Structures for Knowledge Creation and Communication: 11th International Conference on Conceptual Structures|last=De Moor|first=Aldo|publisher=Springer|year=2003|isbn=3-540-40576-3 |pages=16–36}}, pp. 16–36&lt;/ref&gt; Work by [[John F. Sowa]] have, for example, have used Ibn Taymiyyah's model of analogy.&lt;ref name="Sowa" /&gt; He attached caveats however to the use of analogy because he considered the use of reason to be secondary to the use of revelation.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah's view was that analogy should be used under the framework of revelation, as a supporting source.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

There were some jurists who thought rulings derived through analogy could contradict a ruling derived from the Qur'an and the authentic hadith.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; However, Ibn Taymiyyah disagreed because he thought a contradiction between the definitive canonical texts of Islam, and definitive reason was impossible&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; and that this was also the understanding of the salaf.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times, Proceedings of a Conference Held at Princeton University|last=El-Omari|first=Racha|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=0-19-547834-7 |chapter=Ibn Taymiyya's Theology of the Sunna through His Polemics with the Ash'arites.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racha el-Omari says that on an epistemological level, Ibn Taymiyyah considered the Salaf to be better than any other later scholars in understanding the agreement between revelation and reason.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; One example for this is the use of analogy in the Islamic legal principle of [[maslaha]] (public good) about which Ibn Taymiyya believed, if there were to be any contradiction to revelation then it is due to a misunderstanding or misapplication of the concept of utility.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{cite book|title=Maṣlaḥah and the Purpose of the Law: Islamic Discourse on Legal Change from the 4th/10th to 8th/14th Century|last=Opwis|first=Felicitas Meta Maria|publisher=Brill|year=2010|isbn=9789004184169 |pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that to assess the utility of something, the criteria for benefit and harm should come from the Qur'an and sunnah, a criteria which he also applied to the establishment of a correct analogy.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;

An example of Ibn Taymiyyah's use of analogy was in a fatwa forbidding the use of hashish one the grounds that it was analogous to wine, and users should be given 80 lashes in punishment. "Anyone who disagreed was an apostate, he added, whose corpse ought not to be washed or given a decent burial."&lt;ref name=kadri-130 /&gt;

==== Reason (`Aql) ====
Issues surrounding the use of reason ([['Aql]]) and rational came about in relation to the attributes of God for which he faced much resistance.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; At the time the Islamic scholars thought the attributes of God as stated in the Qur'an were contradictory to reason so sought other explanations instead.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah believed that reason itself validated the entire Qur'an as being reliable and in light of that he argued, if some part of the scripture was to be rejected then this would render the use of reason as an unacceptable avenue through which to seek knowledge.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; He thought that the most perfect rational method and use of reason was contained within the Qur'an and sunnah and that the theologians of his time had used rational and reason in a flawed manner.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Criticism of the Grammarians ===
Ibn Taymiyyah had mastered the grammar of Arabic and one of the books which he studied was the book of Arabic grammar called Al-Kitab, by [[Sibawayh]].{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=20}} In later life he met the Qur'an commentator [[Abu Hayyan al-Gharnati]] to whom he expressed that, "Sibawayh was not the Prophet of [[Syntax]] nor was he infallible. He committed eighty mistakes in his book which are not intelligible to you."{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=20}} Ibn Taymiyyah is thought to have severely criticized Sibawayh but the actual substance of those criticisms is not known because the book that Ibn Taymiyyah wrote, ''al-Bahr'', within which he wrote the criticisms has been lost.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=20}} He stated that when there is an explanation of an [[Ayah]] of the Qur'an or a Hadith, from the Prophet himself, the use of philology or a grammatical explanation becomes obsolete.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=21}} He also said one should refer only to the understanding of the Salaf (first three generations of Muslims) when interpreting a word within the scriptural sources.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; However he did not discount the contributions of the grammarians completely.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=20–21}} Ibn Taymiyyah stated that the Arabic nouns within the scriptural sources have been divided by the [[faqih|fuqaha]] (Islamic jurists) into three categories; those that are defined by the shari'a, those defined by [[philology]] (lugha) and finally those that are defined by [[urf|social custom (`urf)]].{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=21}} For him each of these categories of nouns had to be used in their own appropriate manner.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=21–24}}

=== Madh'hab ===
Ibn Taymiyyah censured the scholars for blindly conforming to the precedence of early jurists without any resort to the Qur'an and Sunnah. He contended that although juridical precedence has its place, blindly giving it authority without contextualization, sensitivity to societal changes, and evaluative mindset in light of the Qur'an and Sunnah can lead to ignorance and stagnancy in [[Sharia|Islamic Law]]. Ibn Taymiyyah likened the extremism of ''[[Taqlid]]'' (blind conformity to juridical precedence or school of thought) to the practice of [[Jews]] and [[Christians]] who took their [[rabbi]]s and [[ecclesiastic]]s as gods besides God. In arguing against taqlid, he said the salaf, who in order to better understand and live according to the commands of God, had to make ijtihad using the scriptural sources.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The same approach, in his view, was needed in modern times.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

Ibn Taymiyyah believed that the best role models for Islamic life were the first three generations of Islam ([[Salaf]]); which constitute Muhammad's [[Sahabah|companions]], referred to in Arabic as Sahaba (first generation), followed by the generation of Muslims born after the death of Muhammad known as the [[Tabi'un]] (second generation) which is then followed lastly by the next generation after the Tabi'un known as [[Tabi' al-Tabi'in|Tabi' Al-Tabi'in]] (third generation). Ibn Taymiyyah gave precedence to the ideas of the Sahaba and early generations, over the founders of the Islamic schools of jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For Ibn Taymiyyah it was the Qur'an, the sayings and practices of Muhammad and the ideas of the early generations of Muslims that constituted the best understanding of Islam. Any deviation from their practice was viewed as bid'ah, or innovation, and to be forbidden. He also praised and wrote a commentary on some speeches of [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]].&lt;ref name="qadiri"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.se/~m9783/n/itaysf_e.html |title=IBN TAYMIYYA ON FUTOOH AL-GHAYB AND SUFISM|author=G. F. Haddad |date=1996-03-20 |accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic law and policy ===
Ibn Taymiyya believed that Islamic policy and management was based on {{cite quran|4|58|s=ns}},&lt;ref name=Alshamsi-54&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alshamsi|first1=Mansoor Jassem|title=Islam and Political Reform in Saudi Arabia: The Quest for Political Change|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-rJ8AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=siyasa+ibn+taymiyyah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAWoVChMI9Yq009qDyAIVh36SCh1fkgLI#v=onepage&amp;q=siyasa%20ibn%20taymiyyah&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the goal of ''al-siyasa'' (politics, the political) should be to protect ''al-din'' (religion) and to manage ''al-dunya'' (worldly life and affairs). Religion and the State should be inextricably linked, in his view,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; as the state was indispensable in providing justice to the people, enforcing Islamic law by [[Enjoining good and forbidding wrong|enjoining good and forbidding evil]], unifying the people and preparing a society conducive to the [[Ibadah|worship of God]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He believed that "enjoining good and forbidding wrong" was the duty of every state functionary with charge over other Muslims, from the caliph to "the schoolmaster in charge of assessing children's handwriting exercises."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Taymiyya, ''Le traite de droit public d'ibn Taimiya''. Translated by Henri Laoust. Beirut, 1948, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kadri-139 /&gt;

Ibn Taymiyyah supported giving broad powers to the state. In ''Al-siyasa al-Shar`iyah'', he focused on duties of individuals and punishments rather than rules and procedural limits of authorities.&lt;ref name=kadri-139 /&gt; Suspected highway robbers who would not reveal their accomplices or the location of their loot, for example should be held in detention and lashed for indefinite periods.&lt;ref name=kadri-139&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=macmillan|isbn=978-0-09-952327-7|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also allowed the lashing of imprisoned debtors, and "trials of suspicion"  (''da`sawi al-tuham'') where defendants could be convicted without witnesses or documentary proof.&lt;ref name=kadri-139-40&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=macmillan|isbn=978-0-09-952327-7|pages=139–40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henri Laoust said that Ibn Taymiyyah never propagated the idea of a single [[caliphate]] but believed the Muslim ummah or community would form into a confederation of states.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Laoust further stated that Ibn Taymiyyah called for obedience only to God, and the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, and he did not put a limit on the number of leaders a Muslim community could have.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However Mona Hassan, in her recent study of the political thoughts of Ibn Taymiyyah, questions this and says laoust has wrongly claimed that Ibn Taymiyyah thought of the caliphate as a redundant idea.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ibn Taymiyyah and His Times |last=Hassan|first=Mona|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=0-19-547834-7|chapter=Modern Interpretations and Misinterpretations of a Medieval Scholar: Apprehending the Political Thought of Ibn Taymiyyah.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hassan has shown that Ibn Taymiyyah considered the Caliphate that was under the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun Caliphs]]; [[Abu Bakr]], [[Umar]], [[Uthman]], and [[Ali]], as the moral and legal ideal.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; The Caliphate in his view could not be ceded "in favour of secular kingship (mulk).&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;

=== Jihad ===
Ibn Taymiyyah was noted for emphasis he put on the importance of [[jihad]] and for the "careful and lengthy attention" he gave "to the questions of martyrdom" in jihad, such as benefits and blessings to be had for martyrs in the afterlife.&lt;ref name="WahhabiIslam" /&gt; He asserted that martyrdom and eternal rewards and blessings, . He wrote that, "It is in jihad that one can live and die in ultimate happiness, both in this world and in the Hereafter. Abandoning it means losing entirely or partially both kinds of happiness."&lt;ref name="Peters-jihad-48"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peters |first=Rudolph |title=Jihad in Classical and Modern Islam: A Reader |publisher=Marcus Wiener |year=1996 |location=Princeton |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He defined [[jihad]] as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It comprehends all sorts of worship, whether inward or outward, including love for Allah, being sincere to Him, relying on Him, relinquishing one's soul and property for His sake, being patient and austere, and keeping remembrance of Almighty Allah. It includes what is done by physical power, what is done by the heart, what is done by the tongue through calling to the way of Allah by means of authoritative proofs and providing opinions, and what is done through management, industry, and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Abdallah Bin Bayyah|Bin Bayyah]], [http://binbayyah.net/english/2012/01/18/the-concept-of-jihad/ The Concept of Jihad].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He gave a broad definition of what constituted "aggression" against Muslims and what actions by non-believers made jihad against them permissible. He declared

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is allowed to fight people for (not observing) unambiguous and generally recognized obligations and prohibitions, until they undertake to perform the explicitly prescribed prayers, to pay [[zakat]], to fast during the month of [[Ramadan]], to make the pilgrimage to Mecca and to avoid what is prohibited, such as marrying women in spite of legal impediments, eating impure things, acting unlawfully against the lives and properties of Muslims and the like. It is obligatory to take the initiative in fighting those people, as soon as the Prophet's summons with the reasons for which they are fought has reached them. But if they first attack the Muslims then fighting them is even more urgent, as we have mentioned when dealing with the fighting against rebellious and aggressive bandits.&lt;ref name="WahhabiIslam"&gt;{{cite book |last=DeLong-Bas |first=Natana J. |title=Wahhabi Islam: From Revival and Reform to Global Jihad|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA |year=2004 |location=New York |pages=252–3 |edition=First |isbn=0-19-516991-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters-jihad-52"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peters |first=Rudolph |title=Jihad in Classical and Modern Islam: A Reader|publisher=Marcus Wiener |year=1996 |location=Princeton |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the modern context, his rulings have been used by some Islamist groups to declare jihad against various governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e959|title=Ibn Taymiyyah, Taqi al-Din Ahmad |date=2015-02-14|accessdate=February 14, 2015|website=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|last=Esposito|first=John L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Innovation (Bid`ah) ===
{{Main|Bid'ah}}
Even though Ibn Taymiyyah has been called a theologian,&lt;ref name=Hallaq-2011&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hallaq|first1=Wael B.|title=Ibn Taymiyya Against the Greek Logicians|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198240433.001.0001/acprof-9780198240433|website=Oxford Scholarship Online|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; he claimed to reject ''[[Ilm al-Kalam|`ilm al-kalam]]'', known as Islamic theology,  as well as some aspects of [[Sufism]] and [[Aristotelianism|Peripatetic philosophy]], as an innovation (''[[Bid'ah]]'').&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Despite this, Ibn Taymiyyah's works contained numerous arguments that openly refer to rational arguments ([[kalam]]) for their validity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Aaron|last=Spevack|title=The Archetypal Sunni Scholar: Law, Theology, and Mysticism in the Synthesis of Al-Bajuri|pages=143/145|publisher=State University of New York Press|date=2014|ISBN=978-1-4384-5370-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore he must be included amongst the [[kalam|Mutakallimin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Aaron|last=Spevack|title=The Archetypal Sunni Scholar: Law, Theology, and Mysticism in the Synthesis of Al-Bajuri|pages=143|publisher=State University of New York Press|date=2014|ISBN=978-1-4384-5370-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ibn Taymiyyah opposed giving any undue religious honors to mosques (even that of [[Jerusalem]], the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]]), to approach or rival in any way the Islamic sanctity of the two most holy [[mosque]]s within Islam, [[Masjid al-Haram]] (in [[Mecca]]) and [[Al-Masjid al-Nabawi]] (in [[Madina]]).&lt;ref name="ziyaarah"&gt;"A Muslim Iconoclast (Ibn Taymiyyeh) on the 'Merits' of Jerusalem and Palestine", by Charles D. Matthews, ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', volume 56 (1935), pp. 1–21. [Includes Arabic text of manuscript of Ibn Taymiyya's short work ''Qa'ida fi Ziyarat Bayt-il-Maqdis'' قاعدة في زيارة بيت المقدس]&lt;/ref&gt; As to the practice of making journey for the sole purpose of visiting a mosque, Ibn Taymiyyah has said in his books; Majmu'at al-Rasail al-Kubra, Minhaj al-Sunna and Majmu'at Fatawa, that, "Journey must not be made except to three mosques; Masjid al-Haram, Masjid al-Nabawi and Masjid Al-Aqsa".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Majmu'at al-Rasail al-Kubra|last=Ibn Taymiyyah|first=Taqi al-Din |year=1905 |location=Cairo|pages=53–63|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Minhaj al-Sunna al-Nabawiya|last=Ibn Taymiyyah|first=Taqi al-Din|publisher=|year=1903 |location=Bulaq|pages=132|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Majmu'at Fatawa|last=Ibn Taymiyyah|first=Taqi al-Din|publisher=Cairo|year=1908 |pages=185|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this Serajul Haque says that, "In the opinion of Ibn Taymiyyah only these three mosques have been accepted by the Prophet as the object of journeys, on account of their excellence over all other mosques and places of prayer.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=84}} Ibn Taymiyyah uses a saying (hadith) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in [[Sahih al-Bukhari|Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim|Muslim]] to justify his view that it is not permitted to journey exclusively to any mosque than Mecca, Medina, or Jerusalem.{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=84}}

===Existence of saints===
Although it is sometimes supposed that Ibn Taymiyyah rejected the very idea of [[saint]]s, which had become a cardinal [[Sunni]] belief in the medieval period,&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C. Brown, "Faithful Dissenters: Sunni Skepticism about the Miracles of Saints," ''Journal of Sufi Studies'' 1 (2012), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Taylor, ''In the Vicinity of the Righteous'' (Leiden: Brill, 1999), pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Renard, ''Friends of God: Islamic Images of Piety, Commitment, and Servanthood'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008); Idem., ''Tales of God Friends: Islamic Hagiography in Translation'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2009, et passim).&lt;/ref&gt; scholarship has shown that this is not true.&lt;ref name="Josef W. Meri 2002 p. 68"&gt;Josef W. Meri, ''The Cult of Saints among Muslims and Jews in Medieval Syria'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, while Ibn Taymiyyah did indeed reject widely-established orthodox ''practices'' associated with the veneration of saints in Islam at his time, like [[ziyara|the visitation to their graves]] and [[tawassul|the seeking of their intercession]], he never rejected the actual existence of saints as such. On the contrary, he explicitly states: "The miracles of saints are absolutely true and correct, by the acceptance of all Muslim scholars. And the Qur'an has pointed to it in different places, and the sayings of the Prophet have mentioned it, and whoever denies the miraculous power of saints are only people who are innovators and their followers."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah, ''al-Mukhtasar al-Fatawa al-Masriyya'', 1980, p. 603&lt;/ref&gt; In this particular respect, he differed little from all his contemporaries; for just as practically all of the era's scholars believed that "the lives of saints and their miracles were incontestable,"&lt;ref name="Josef W. Meri 2002 p. 68"/&gt; so also did Ibn Taymiyyah.&lt;ref name="Josef W. Meri 2002 p. 68"/&gt;

Ibn Taymiyyah's most categorical declaration of accepting the existence of saints and their miracles appears in his famous creed '''Aqīda al-Wāsitīya'', in which he states: "Among the fundamentals of the belief of the People of the Sunna is belief in the miracles of the saints (''karāmāt al-awliyā'') and the supernatural acts which God achieves through them in all varieties of knowledge, illuminations (''mukāshafāt''), power, and impressions as it is handed down about the ancient nations in [[Al-Kahf|the chapter of the Cave]] and in other Quranic chapters and is known of the early men among this Community of Believers among the [[Sahaba|Companions]] and [[Tabiun|Followers]] and the rest of the generations of this Community of Believers. It [the blessing of having saints and saintly miracles] will be with them until the [[Day of Resurrection]]."&lt;ref name="Josef W. Meri 2002 p. 68"/&gt;

Although Ibn Taymiyyah was critical of some of the developments within [[Sufism]], he never rejected the practice outright, and actually enumerated a list of early Sufis whom he considered to be among the greatest Islamic saints.&lt;ref&gt;See Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Majmu'a Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya'' (Cairo: Dar ar-Rahmat, u.d.), Vol. 10, p. 516&lt;/ref&gt; In this list, he included [[Bayazid Bastami]], [[Junayd of Baghdad]], [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani]], [[Hasan of Basra]], [[Ibrahim ibn Adham]], [[Maruf Karkhi]], [[Sirri Saqti]], and several other venerable personages who have always been venerated in mainstream Sunni Islam as being among the greatest saints of all.&lt;ref&gt;See Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Majmu'a Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya'' (Cairo: Dar ar-Rahmat, u.d.), Vol. 10, p. 516; for the traditional narratives of these saints, see: John Renard, ''Friends of God: Islamic Images of Piety, Commitment, and Servanthood'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding all these early saints, Ibn Taymiyyah even declares: "These great Sufi people were the leaders of humanity, and they were calling to what is right and forbidding what is wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Majmu'a Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya'' (Cairo: Dar ar-Rahmat, u.d.), Vol. 10, p. 516&lt;/ref&gt; While Ibn Taymiyyah did indeed reject the veneration of saints who promulgated the [[Ibn Arabi|Akbari]] doctrine of [[wahdat al-wajud]], he never rejected the venerability of saints who belonged to all the other Sufi orders.&lt;ref&gt;See Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Majmu'a Fatawa Ibn Taymiyya'' (Cairo: Dar ar-Rahmat, u.d.), Vol. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visitation of the tombs of the Prophets and the saints===
Ibn Taymiyyah considered the visitation of the tombs of Prophets and saints as impermissible,{{sfn|Haque|1982|p=83}} a blameworthy innovation&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=78–81}} and comparable to worshiping something besides God ([[Shirk (Islam)|Shirk]]).&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=78–81}} This view was vigorously rejected by mainstream [[Sunni]] scholars both during his life and after his death. The [[Shafi'i]] hadith master [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] stated that ''"This is one of the ugliest positions that has been reported of Ibn Taymiyya"''&lt;ref name="IT290"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7JRmPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Ibn+Taymiyya+and+his+times&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Rapoport|first=Yossef|last2=Ahmed|first2=Shahab|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-547834-1|language=en|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also added that travelling to visit the tomb of the Prophet was ''"one of the best of actions and the noblest of pious deeds with which one draws near to God, and its legitimacy is a matter of consensus."''&lt;ref name="IT291"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7JRmPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Ibn+Taymiyya+and+his+times&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Rapoport|first=Yossef|last2=Ahmed|first2=Shahab|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-547834-1|language=en|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hanafi]] hadith scholar [[Ali al-Qari]] stated that, ''"Amongst the Hanbalis, Ibn Taymiyya has gone to an extreme by prohibiting travelling to visit the Prophet – may God bless him and grant him peace"''&lt;ref name="IT292"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7JRmPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Ibn+Taymiyya+and+his+times&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Rapoport|first=Yossef|last2=Ahmed|first2=Shahab|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-547834-1|language=en|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Qastallani|Qastallani]] stated that ''"The Shaykh Taqi al-Din Ibn Taymiyya has abominable and odd statements on this issue to the effect that travelling to visit the Prophet is prohibited and is not a pious deed."''&lt;ref name="IT293"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7JRmPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Ibn+Taymiyya+and+his+times&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Rapoport|first=Yossef|last2=Ahmed|first2=Shahab|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-547834-1|language=en|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars in opposition to Ibn Taymiyyah's views include [[Ghazali]],&lt;ref name="IT291" /&gt; [[Nawawi]],&lt;ref name="IT291" /&gt; [[Muhammad al-Munawi|Munawi]]&lt;ref name="IT291" /&gt; and [[Qadi Ayyad]] who stated that visiting the Prophet was ''"a sunna of the Muslims on which there was consensus, and a good and desirable deed."''&lt;ref name="IT291" /&gt;

===Intercession===
Ibn Taymiyyah said that seeking the [[Tawassul|assistance of God through intercession]] is allowed, as long as the other person is still alive.{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=78–81}} However, he believed that those who ask assistance from the grave of the Prophet or saints, are mushrikin (polytheists), someone who is engaged in [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]].{{sfn|Haque|1982|pp=78–81}} 
This view was also vigorously rejected by mainstream Sunni scholars. For example, the chief judge of Damascus, [[Taqi al-Din al-Subki]] stated that, ''"It is proper to entreat and ask for the help and intercession of the Prophet ﷺ with God. No one from amongst the [[salaf]] and khalaf denied this, until Ibn Taymiyya came along and disapproved of this, and deviated from the straight path, and invented a position that no scholar has said before, and he became a deterrent example for Muslims"''.&lt;ref name="IT29495"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7JRmPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Ibn+Taymiyya+and+his+times&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Rapoport|first=Yossef|last2=Ahmed|first2=Shahab|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195478341|language=en|pages=294–295}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Ibn Hajar al-Haytami|Ibn Hajar]] rejected Ibn Taymiyya's view on intercession and held that he had broken with the established consensus of Sunni scholars,&lt;ref name="IT292"/&gt; as did many other scholars such as [[Muhammad al-Zurqani|Zurqani]] and [[Khalil ibn Ishaq al-Jundi|Khalil ibn Ishaq]].&lt;ref name="IT294"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7JRmPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Ibn+Taymiyya+and+his+times&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Ibn Taymiyya and His Times|last=Rapoport|first=Yossef|last2=Ahmed|first2=Shahab|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195478341|language=en|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mutakallimun ===
{{Expand section|1=Ibn Taymiyya and his times with ISBN of 9780195478341|date=February 2015}}
The mutakallimun are scholars who engage in [[ilm al-Kalam]] (rationalist theology) and they were criticised by Ibn Taymiyyah for their use of rationalist theology and philosophy.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; He said that the method of kalam was used by the [[Mu`tazila|Mu`tazilites]], [[Jahmi]]tes and [[Ash'ari|Ash`ari's]].&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah considered the use of philosophical proofs and kalam to be redundant because he saw the Qur'an and the Sunna as superior rational proofs.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah said that these explanations were not grounded in scriptural evidence such as the philosophical explanation of the divine attributes of God or the proof of God using the [[cosmological argument]].&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; He said that the call to Islam was not made using such methods by the Qur'an or the Prophet and that these theories have only caused errors and corruption.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; The mutakallimun called their use of rationalist theology usul al-din (principles of religion) but Ibn Taymiyyah said that the use of rationalist theology has nothing to do with the true usul al-din which comes from God and to state otherwise is to say that the Prophet neglected an important aspect of Islam.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah says that the usul al-din of the mutakallimun, deserve to be named usul din al-shaytan (principles of Satanic religion).&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;

Ibn Taymiyyah's attempts to focus attention onto Qur'anic rationality was taken up by his student Ibn Qayyim, to the exception of his other followers.&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt; This focus on traditionlist rationlism was also taken up by [[Musa Bigiev]].&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;

=== Sufism ===
Ibn Taymiyyah belonged to the [[Qadiriyya]] [[tariqa]] (order) of [[Sufism]]&lt;ref name="Makdisi, 1973 pp 118-28"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arch91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rapoport 334"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Halverson 2010 48–49"/&gt; and claimed to inherit the [[khirqa]] (spiritual mantle) of the founder of the Qadiriyya order [[Abdul-Qadir Gilani|'Abd al-Qadir al-Jilani]].&lt;ref name="Arch91"/&gt;
Among his explicit positive references to Sufism and the [[Qadiriyya]] [[tariqa]] in particular, Ibn Taymiyyah referred to Jilani as "Shaykhuna" (our Shaykh) and "Sayyidi" (my master).&lt;ref name="Arch92"/&gt; He spoke highly of a great many other Sufi Shaykhs also such as [[Abu Yazid al-Bistami]] and [[al-Junayd]].&lt;ref name="Arch92"&gt;{{cite book|last=Spevack|first=Aaron|title=The Archetypal Sunni Scholar: Law, Theology, and Mysticism in the Synthesis of Al-Bajuri|publisher=State University of New York Press|date=2014|isbn=143845371X|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went to great lengths to state that Sufism is not a heretical innovation ([[bid'ah]]).&lt;ref name="Arch92"/&gt;

Despite this, Ibn Taymiyyah rejected two views associated with some Sufis. Firstly, he rejected [[monism#Sufism|monism]] which he believed was similar to the [[pantheism|pantheistic]] belief that God "encompasses all things".{{sfn|Reynolds|2012|p=174}} This rejection included denouncing the views of [[Ibn Arabi]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Secondly he said that the view that [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual enlightenment]] is of a greater importance than obeying the [[sharia]] was a failure to properly follow the example of Muhammad.{{sfn|Reynolds|2012|p=174}} On Ibn Arabi, and Sufism in general, Henri Laoust says that Ibn Taymiyyah never condemned Sufism in itself, but only that which he considered to be, inadmissible deviations in doctrine, ritual or morals, such as [[monism]], [[antinomianism]] or [[esotericism]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Shi'a Islam ===
{{Main|Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah}}
{{Expand section|1=Ibn Taymiyya and his times with ISBN of 9780195478341|date=February 2015}}
Ibn Taymiyyah was extremely critical of Shia and considered them religiously bankrupt, among the most morally depraved people and the root cause of many Islamic ills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Memon|editor1-first=Muhammad Umar|editor1-link=Muhammad Umar Memon|title=Ibn Taimiya's Struggle Against Popular Religion: With an Annotated Translation of His Kitab iqtida as-sirat al-mustaqim mukhalafat ashab al-jahim|date=1976|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=9783111662381|page=361|edition=reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; His severe critique of Twelver Shia in his book, ''Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah, ''was written in response to the book ''[[Minhaj al-karamah|Minhaj al-karama fi ma'rifat al-imama]]'', by the Shia theologian [[Al-Hilli]].&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ibn Taymiyyah and His Times|last=al-Jamil|first=Tariq|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=0-19-547834-7 |chapter=Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn al-Mutahhar al-Hilli: Shi`a Polemics and the Struggle for Religious Authority in Medieval Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt; He focused his criticisms to the similarity between Shia, Christians and Jews.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Regarding the Shia mourning for Husayn on [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], Ibn Taymiyyah considered Husayn's martyrdom as a divinely bestowed honour—not a major tragedy. He also argued that such mourning was never instructed by Muhammad and that the Islamic response to recent (let alone ancient) loss is not extravagant mourning but to endure the loss with patience and trust in God. However, he also believed those who celebrated on Ashura were anti-Shia zealots ("''[[Nasibi|an-Nāṣibiyyah]]''") or ignorant people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marion Holmes Katz|title=The Birth of The Prophet Muhammad: Devotional Piety in Sunni Islam|date=2007|publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=978-1-135-98394-9|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christianity ===

{{Expand section|1=Ibn Taymiyya and his times with ISBN of 9780195478341|date=February 2015}}
He wrote [[polemic]]s against Christians.{{sfn|Reynolds|2012|p=174}}

=== Non-Muslims ===
[[File:DiezAlbumsStudyingTheKoran.jpg|thumb|225px|Ibn Taymiyyah witnessed conversions to [[Islam]] as a growing trend among many [[Mongol]]s.]]Ibn Taymiyyah strongly opposed borrowing from [[Christianity]] or other non-Muslim religions. In his text ''On the Necessity of the Straight Path'' (''kitab iqtida al-sirat al-mustaqim'') he preached that the beginning of Muslim life was the point at which "a perfect dissimilarity with the non-Muslims has been achieved." To this end he opposed the celebration of the [[Mawlid|observance of the birthday]] of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] Muhammad or the construction of [[mosque]]s around the tombs of Muslim saints saying: "Many of them (the Muslims) do not even know of the Christian origins of these practices."&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad `Umar Memon, ''Ibn Taymiyya's Struggle against Popular Religion, with an annotated translation of Kitab Iqitada'', the Hague, (1976)  p.78, 210&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic views ===
He elaborated a circumstantial analysis of [[market economies|market mechanism]], with a theoretical insight unusual in his time. Regarding the power of [[supply and demand]], Ibn Taymiyyah said, "If desire for goods increases while its availability decreases, its price rises. On the other hand, if availability of the good increases and the desire for it decreases, the price comes down."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Companion to the History of Economic Thought |chapter=Contributions of Medieval Muslim Scholars to the History of Economics and their Impact: A Refutation of the Schumpeterian Great Gap |last=Hosseini |first=Hamid S. |editor=Biddle, Jeff E. |editor2=Davis, Jon B. |editor3=Samuels, Warren J. |year=2003 |publisher=Blackwell |location=Malden, MA |isbn=0-631-22573-0 |doi=10.1002/9780470999059.ch3 |pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His discourses on the welfare advantages and disadvantages of market regulation and deregulation, have an almost contemporary ring to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baeck|first=Louis|title=The Mediterranean tradition in economic thought|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-09301-5|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, he also advocated a policy of "fair prices" and "fair profits", with the implication that anything higher would be impious. Such forms of price fixing was detrimental to entrepreneurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cizakca|first=Murat|title=Islamic Capitalism and Finance: Origins, Evolution and the Future|year=2013|publisher=Edward Elgar Pub|isbn=978-0857937629|page=xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eternity of Species===
He argued that there was an alternate view to the view held by philosophers, like [[Ibn Sina]], who claimed the universe was eternal in its entirety, and Islamic scholars, like [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], who claimed that the universe was created from nothing by God.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://jis.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/3/287.full.pdf | title=PERPETUAL CREATIVITY IN THE PERFECTION OF GOD: IBN TAYMIYYA'S HADITH COMMENTARY ON GOD'S CREATION OF THIS WORLD | accessdate = 2016-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his Sharh Hadith Imran ibn Hasan, Ibn Taymiyya distinguishes between species and elements, asserting that the former are eternal with God.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = DigiTool - Results - Full | url = http://digitool.library.mcgill.ca/R/?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=36863&amp;local_base=GEN01-MCG02 | accessdate = 2016-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He states: "If it is supposed that the species [of things done] has been with Him from eternity, neither revelation nor reason denies this 'withness' (ma^iyya). On the contrary, it is part of His perfection."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In fact, Ibn Taymiyya draws this assertion from his belief that God perpetually creates, i.e. in preeternity.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  John Hoover, in his Perpetual Creativity In The Perfection Of God: Ibn Taymiyya's Hadith Commentary On God's Creation Of This World, elaborates, "Following in the footsteps of [[Ibn Sina]] and [[Ibn Rushd]], Ibn Taymiyya then roots God's perpetual creativity in a Neoplatonic concept of God's perfection. Power and creativity are necessary concomitants of God's perfection. If God's creativity were not perpetual, God would have been devoid of His creativity, as well as other attributes of perfection, in pre-eternity."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Assessment ==
=== Salafism ===
Ibn Taymiyyah is thought by some to be the main influence behind the emergence of Salafism. He placed an emphasis on understanding Islam as it was understood by the salaf (first three generations of Muslims).&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Modern Islamism ===
Various concepts within modern [[Islamism]] can be attributed to Ibn Taymiyyah.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; His influence is noted by Yahya Michot who says Ibn Taymiyyah "has thus become a sort of forefather of [[al-Qaeda]]."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; One reason for this was his [[Divisions of the world in Islam|categorising the world]] into distinct territories: the domain of Islam (dar al-Islam), where the rule is of Islam and sharia law is enforced; the domain of unbelief (dar-al-kufr) ruled by [[Kafir|unbelievers]]; and the domain of war (dar al-harb) which is territory under the rule of unbelievers who are involved in an active or potential conflict with the domain of Islam.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Religion (A-F)|last=Chopra|first=Ramesh|publisher=Isha Books |year=2005 |isbn=8182052858 |pages=211–212|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Ibn Taymiyyah included a fourth. When the Mongols, whom he considered unbelievers, took control of the city of [[Mardin]]&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; the population included many Muslims. Believing Mardin was neither the domain of Islam, as Islam was not legally applied with an armed forces consisting of Muslims, nor the domain of war because the inhabitants were Muslim,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah created a new "composite" category, known as ''dar al-`ahd''.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Shari'a and Islamic Criminal Justice in Time of War and Peace|last=Bassiouni|first=M. Cherif|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=1-107-68417-X|location=|pages=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

A second concept is making a declaration of apostasy ([[takfir]]) against a Muslim who does not obey Islam.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; But at the same time Ibn Taymiyyah maintained that no one can question anothers faith and curse them as based on one's own desire, because faith is defined by God and the Prophet.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; He said, rather than cursing or condemning them, an approach should be taken where they are educated about the religion.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; A further concept attributed to Ibn Taymiyyah is, "the duty to oppose and kill Muslim rulers who do not implement the revealed law (shari'a).&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Ibn Taymiyyah's role in the Islamist movements of the twentieth and twenty first century have also been noted by, the previous Coordinator for Counterterrorism at the United States Department of State, [[Daniel Benjamin]] who labels the chapter on the history of modern Islamic movements in his book ''The Age of Sacred Terror'', as "Ibn Taymiyya and His children".&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Age of Sacred Terror: Radical Islam's War Against America|last=Benjamin|first=Daniel|publisher=Random House Trade|year=2003|isbn=0-8129-6984-7 |pages=VI|last2=Simon|first2=Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yossef Rapoport, a reader in Islamic history at Queen Mary, however, says this is not a probable narrative.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Mardin fatwa and the Mardin Conference ===
One of Ibn Taymiyyah's most famous fatwas is regarding the Mongols who had conquered and destroyed the [[Abbasid caliphate]] in 1258 and had then converted to Islam.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Once they were in control of Mardin, they behaved unjustly with their subjects so the people of Mardin asked Ibn Taymiyyah for a legal verdict regarding the classification of the territory under which they live.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; He categorized the territory as ''dar al-`ahd'' which in some ways is similar to dar al-kufr (domain of unbelievers).&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Included in his verdict was declaring the Mongol ruler Ghazan and other Mongols who did not accept shari'a in full, as unbelievers.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite book|title=World of Faith and Freedom: Why International Religious Liberty Is Vital to American National Security|last=Farr|first=Thomas F.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=0-19-517995-1|pages=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Political Ideologies|last=Freeden|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=0-19-958597-0 |pages=633}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Nettler and Kéchichian, Ibn Taymiyyah affirmed that Jihad against the Mongols, "was not only permissible but obligatory because the latter ruled not according to Sharīʿah but through their traditional, and therefore manmade, [[Yassa]] code. This essentially meant that Mongols were living in a state of ''[[Jahiliyyah|jāhilīyah]] ''(ignorance)."&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The authors further state that his two famous student, Ibn Qayyim and Ibn Kathir, agreed with this ruling.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; He called for a defensive jihad to mobilise the people to kill the Mongol rulers and any one who supported them, Muslim or non-Muslim.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah when talking about those who support the Mongols said, "Everyone who is with them (Mongols) in the state over which they rule has to be regarded as belonging to the most evil class of men. He is either an atheist ([[zindīq]]) or a hypocrite who does not believe in the essence of the religion of Islam. This means that he (only) outwardly pretends to be Muslim or he belongs to the worst class of all people who are the people of the bida` (heretical innovations)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=In Their Own Words|last=Aaron|first=David|publisher=RAND Corporation|year=2008|isbn=0-8330-4402-8 |pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yahya Mochet says that, Ibn Taymiyyah's call to war was not simply to cause a "rebellion against the political power in place" but to repel an "external enemy".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

In 2010, a group of [[Islamic Scholars]] at the Mardin conference argued that Ibn Taymiyyah's famous fatwa about the residents of Mardin when it was under the control of the Mongols was misprinted into an order to "fight" the people living under their territory, whereas the actual statement is, "The Muslims living therein should be treated according to their rights as Muslims, while the non-Muslims living there outside of the authority of Islamic Law should be treated according to their rights."&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite web|last=al-Turayri,|first=Shaykh Abd al-Wahhab|title=The Mardin Conference – Understanding Ibn Taymiyyah's Fatwa|url=http://muslimmatters.org/2010/06/29/the-mardin-conference-%E2%80%93-a-detailed-account/|publisher=MuslimMatters|accessdate=29 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have based their understanding on the original manuscript in the [[Al-Zahiriyah Library]], and the transmission by Ibn Taymiyyah's student [[Ibn Muflih]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/a-religious-basis-for-violence-misreads-original-principles |title=A religious basis for violence misreads original principles |work=The National |accessdate=2012-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants of the Mardin conference also rejected the categorization of the world into different domains of war and peace, stating that the division was a result of the circumstances at the time.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The participants further stated that the division has become irrelevant with the existence of nation states.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==Reevaluation==
However, some recent scholarship has argued that attempts by [[Salafis]] and [[Salafi jihadism|Jihadis]] to portray the figure of Ibn Taymiyyah as being a direct classical precursor of their own beliefs are flawed inasmuch as they are often borne, according to these same scholars, of a limited reading of the theologian's substantial corpus of works,&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt; many of which have not yet been translated from the original Arabic. James Pavlin, for example, has argued: "Ibn Taymiyya remains one of the most controversial Islamic thinkers today because of his supposed influence on many fundamentalist movements. The common understanding of his ideas have been filtered through the bits and pieces of his statements that have been misappropriated by ... [his] alleged supporters."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Taymiyyah, ''Epistle on Worship: Risalat al-'Ubudiyya'', tr. James Pavlin (London: Islamic Text Society, 2015), intro.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Abdul Haq Ansari has argued that the ubiquitous notion that Ibn Taymiyyah rejected [[Sufism]] outright is erroneous, for while "the popular image of Ibn Taymiyyah [is] ... that he [criticized] Sufism indiscriminately ... [was] deadly against the Sufis, and ... [saw] no place for Sufism in Islam,"&lt;ref name="M. Abdul Haq-Ansari 1985 pp. 1-12"&gt;M. Abdul Haq-Ansari, "Ibn Taymiyyah and Sufism," ''Islamic Studies'', Vol. 24, No. 1 (Spring, 1985), pp. 1-12&lt;/ref&gt; it is historically known, according to the same scholar, that Ibn Taymiyyah actually considered Sufism an essential part of Islam, being on the whole "sympathetic"&lt;ref name="M. Abdul Haq-Ansari 1985 pp. 1-12"/&gt; towards what everyone at the time considered an integral part of Islamic life. Indeed, "far from saying [Sufism] has no place in Islam,"&lt;ref name="M. Abdul Haq-Ansari 1985 pp. 1-12"/&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah, according to the same author, seems to have wanted to reform the practice of medieval Sufism as part of his wider aim to reform Sunni Islam (of which Sufism was a fundamental component at the time) by divesting both these traditions of what he perceived to be [[bidah|heretical innovations]] within them.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt; Moreover, these scholars also point out that Ibn Taymiyyah had a deep reverence and appreciation for the works of such major Sufi saints as [[Junayd]], [[Sahl al-Tustari]], [[Abu Talib al-Makki]], and even [[Bayazid Bastami]],&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt; and was part of the [[Qadiriyya]] Sufi order himself.&lt;ref name="Makdisi, 1973 pp 118-28"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arch91"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rapoport 334"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Halverson 2010 48–49"/&gt;

== Works ==
Ibn Taymiyyah left a considerable body of work, ranging from 350 according to his student [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/introduction/wasiti/taimiyah_3.html#HEADING3 |title=Ibn Taimiyah |publisher=Usc.edu |accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 500 according to his student [[al-Dhahabi]].&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.M. Sharif, ''A History of Muslim Philosophy'', Pakistan Philosophical Congress, p. 798&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oliver Leaman]] says that Ibn Taymiyyah produced some 700 works in the field of Islamic sciences.&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt; His scholarly output has been described as immense with a wide scope and its contents "bear the marks of brilliant insights hastility jotted down".&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; It is the case however, that his works are not yet fully understood but efforts are being made, at least in the western languages to gain an adequate understanding of his writings.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; In his early life, his work was mostly based on theology and the use of reason in interpretation of scriptural evidences, with later works focusing on; refutation of Greek [[logic]], questioning the prevalent practices of the time, and anti-Christian and anti-Shi'i polemics.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Ibn Taymiyyah's total works have not all survived and his extant works of thirty five volumes, are incomplete.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Extant books and essays written by ibn Taymiyyah include:

[[File:Antitoxin diphtheria.jpg|thumb|Vintage 1895 vial of diphtheria antitoxin.]]
"'''Jim'''" was the name of a former milk wagon horse, who was used to produce [[blood plasma|serum]] containing diphtheria [[antitoxin]] ([[antibody|antibodies]] against [[diphtheria|diphtheria toxin]]). Jim produced over 30 quarts (7.5 US gallons) of diphtheria [[antitoxin]] in his career. However, on October 2, 1901, Jim showed signs that he had contracted [[Clostridium tetani|tetanus]] and was [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]]. After the death of a girl in St. Louis was traced back to Jim's contaminated serum, it was discovered that serum dated September 30 contained tetanus in its incubation phase. This contamination could have easily been discovered if the serum had been tested prior to its use. Furthermore, samples from September 30 had also been used to fill bottles labeled "August 24," while actual samples from the 24th were shown to be free of contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/100YearsofBiologicsRegulation/ucm070022.htm#TheSt.LouisTragedyandEnactmentofthe1902BiologicsControlAct |title=The St. Louis Tragedy and Enactment of the 1902 Biologics Control Act |date=April 9, 2009 |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

These failures in oversight led to the distribution of antitoxin that caused the death of 12 more children. This incident, and a similar one involving contaminated [[smallpox]] [[vaccine]], led to the passage of the [[Biologics Control Act]] of 1902, which established the [[Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research]]. Jim's misfortune, and the ensuing tragedy and reaction, thus established a precedent for the regulation of biologics, leading to the 1906 formation of the US [[Food and Drug Administration]], or FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/100YearsofBiologicsRegulation/ |title=100 Years of Biologics Regulation |date=April 21, 2009 |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/ProductRegulation/100YearsofBiologicsRegulation/ucm070022.htm |title=Science and the Regulation of Biological Products |date=April 9, 2009 |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{pp-30-500|small=yes}}

The following is a list of alleged and confirmed [[assassination]]s reported to have been conducted by the State of [[Israel]]. It includes attempts on notable persons who were reported to have been specifically targeted by the various Israeli [[Israel Defense Forces|security]], [[Israeli intelligence community|intelligence]] and [[Israel Police|law enforcement]] agencies.

According to [[Eyal Weizman]], "targeted assassinations have become the most significant and frequent form of Israeli military attack", and serve not only to contain terror but as a "political tool" to control Palestinian territories Israel has otherwise withdrawn from. In response to protests over the number of civilians killed in targeting operations, and the refusal of a number of pilots to engage in such missions in 2003, Israel set up groups to minimize collateral damage in 2003 to establish acceptable levels of damage to bystanders. In 2006 "focused lethality munitions", missiles with intense but highly localized explosive were introduced to this end, and in November a legal committee was set up to rule on assassinations. {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

There is no clear definition of "targeted killing" under [[international law]]. The [[Supreme Court of Israel]], in response to a suit on the practice, mainly regarded actions in the [[Palestinian Territories]], ruled on 14 December 2006 that such actions took place in an 'international armed conflict' but that the "terrorists", as civilians, lacked combatant status under international law. Yet they were, in the court's view, civilians participating directly in hostilities, which would mean they lose their immunity. It also ruled, following a precedent set forth by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in its ''[[McCann and Others v United Kingdom]]'' judgement, that a [[Proportionality (law)|'law of proportionality']], balancing military necessity with humanity, must apply.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Otto, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gRuiNWNj_yEC&amp;pg=PA5 ''Targeted Killings and International Law,''] Springer 2011, p.6, pp.310,319ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Assassination were permitted if "strong and persuasive information" concerning the target's identity existed; if the mission served to curtail terror; and if other techniques, such as attempting to arrest the target, would gravely endanger soldiers' lives.

[[Nils Melzer]] in his 2006 study [[Targeted Killing in International Law]] defines [[targeted killings]] in terms of five criteria, summed up as "the use of lethal force attributable to a subject of international law with the intent, premeditation and deliberation to kill individually selected persons who are not in the physical custody of those targeting them."&lt;ref&gt;[[Nils Melzer]],
[https://books.google.com/books?id=TPcJOx_0bdoC&amp;pg=PA46&amp; ''Targeted Killing in International Law,''] Oxford University Press, 2008 pp.3-5, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Before 2001 Israel denied it practiced or has a policy of conducting extrajudicial executions.&lt;ref name="Hajjar" &gt;Lisa Hajjar,[http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/4049/lawfare-and-targeted-killing_developments-in-the-i 'Lawfare and Targeted Killing: Developments in the Israeli and US Contexts,'] [[Jadaliyya]] 15 January 2012:'In 1992 a government spokesperson said, “There is no policy, and there never will be a policy or a reality, of willful killings of suspects…the principle of the sanctity of life is a fundamental principle of the I.D.F. There is no change and there will not be a change in this respect”.'&lt;/ref&gt;

The term itself gained widespread currency only after Israel went public concerning its policy regarding alleged terrorists in the [[Palestinian territories]].&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Masters, [http://www.cfr.org/counterterrorism/targeted-killings/p9627 Targeted Killings] [[Council on Foreign Relations]] May 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Early into the [[Second Intifada]], it became the first state to publicly outline a policy of “liquidation” and “preemptive targeted killing,” when two female bystanders were killed during an operation to kill a Palestinian militant, Hussein ‘Abayat, on 9 November 2000.&lt;ref name="Hajjar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CordMora" /&gt; Killings in the past were often premised on revenge for earlier crimes, and required a quasi-judicial commission to convict the target of culpability before action was taken. The policy, re-introduced by [[Ariel Sharon]] in the face of suicide bombings, no longer took evidence of potential involvement by the target in future attacks on Israel as decisive, and the decision was left to the discretion of the Prime Minister and [[Shin Bet]].&lt;ref&gt;Ami Pedahzur,
[https://books.google.com/books?id=6SdFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA2001 ''The Israeli Secret Services and the Struggle Against Terrorism,''] Columbia University Press, 2013 ed. p.201.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the former Legal Advisor to the State Department [[Abraham David Sofaer|Judge Abraham Sofaer]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...killings in self-defense are no more "assassinations" in international affairs than they are murders when undertaken by our police forces against domestic killers. Targeted killings in self-defense have been authoritatively determined by the federal government to fall outside the assassination prohibition.&lt;ref name="sfgate2004"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-03-26/opinion/17416329_1_self-defense-killings-deadly-force |author=[[Abraham D. Sofaer]] |title=Responses to Terrorism / Targeted killing is a necessary option |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |date=March 26, 2004 |accessdate=May 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829072847/http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-03-26/opinion/17416329_1_self-defense-killings-deadly-force |archivedate=August 29, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
A state engaged in such activities must however, Sofaer concluded, openly acknowledge its responsibility and accept accountability for mistakes made.

This characterization is criticized by many, including [[Amnesty International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel and the Occupied Territories:  Israel must end its policy of assassinations |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde15/056/2003/en/ |work=AI Index: MDE 15/056/2003 |publisher=Amnesty International |accessdate=14 April 2014 |date=4 July 2003 |quote=Amnesty International considers that respect for the rule of law and the protection of the right to life require that the policy of assassinating those who do not pose an imminent threat to lives be ruled unlawful and be stopped. |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[B'tselem]] has calculated that between 2002 and May 2008, at least 387 Palestinians died as a result of Israeli targeted killings, of which 234 were the targets, and the rest collateral casualties.&lt;ref name="Alston" /&gt;&lt;ref name="B'tselem2011" &gt;B'tselem2011,[http://www.btselem.org/press-release/6-april-11-change-military-investigation-policy-welcome-it-must-not-be-contingent-secu 'Change in military investigation policy welcome, but it must not be contingent on the security situation,'] [[B’tselem]] 6 April 2011:'According to B’Tselem statistics, from the beginning of the second intifada, on 29 September 2000, to the end of 2010, Israeli security forces killed 4,927 Palestinians in the West Bank and in the [[Gaza Strip]], 970 of them minors (under age 18). At least 2,227 of the fatalities were not taking part in hostilities. Another 239 were the object of a targeted killing. Thousands more were injured. [These figures do not include the casualties in Operation Cast Lead.'&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of Israeli targeted killings have taken place in [[West Bank Areas in the Oslo II Accord|Area A of the West Bank]] lying within the jurisdiction of the [[Palestinian National Authority]].&lt;ref name="Alston" &gt;Philip Alston, [http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/docs/14session/A.HRC.14.24.Add6.pdf  ''UN: Report of the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Executions,''] [[United Nations]] A/HRC/14/24/Add.6,  May 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of killings listed below have been denied by Israel. Most{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} fall within a series of campaigns, including [[Operation Wrath of God]] (launched in response to the 1972 [[Munich massacre]]), Israeli actions in the wake of the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]] (2000–), and strikes during the 2008–09 [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]]. Gaza, according to Eyal Weizman, has now become 'the world's largest laboratory for airborne assassinations.' According to reports, as part of the long-term cease-fire terms negotiated between Israel, Hamas and other Palestinian groups to end the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]], Israel pledged it would desist from its targeted killings against Palestinian terrorists and faction leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=723559 'Abbas announces Israel-Gaza ceasefire,'] [[Ma'an News Agency]] 26 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy of targeted killings is known in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as "focused foiling" (Hebrew: סיכול ממוקד ''sikul memukad'').

"'''Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism'''" (or '''MUTO''' for short) refers to a species of [[kaiju|giant monsters]] that appeared as the main antagonists in ''[[Godzilla (2014 film)|Godzilla]]'' (2014).

==Overview==
===Name===
"MUTO" is an acronym for "Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism". Director [[Gareth Edwards (director)|Gareth Edwards]] stated that "it's basically the UFO of monsters".&lt;ref name="facebook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/godzilla/facebook-qa-with-director-gareth-edwards-may-4-2014/754626287901111|title=Facebook Q&amp;A with Director Gareth Edwards - May 4, 2014|publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=August 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's first draft differentiated the male and female MUTO as Hokmuto and Femuto, respectively. Official merchandise connected with the film refer to the male MUTO as "Winged MUTO" and the female as "Eight-Legged MUTO". While the term "MUTO" is used to identify the two parasitic creatures in the film, it is mainly used to reference giant monsters who are yet to be named. Such was the case in the official prequel comic, ''Godzilla: Awakening'', where a hive-minded [[superorganism]] from the [[Permian]] era that feeds on radiation, is identified as a MUTO before being designated as Shinomura ("Swarm of Death.")&lt;ref&gt;Godzilla: Awakening, Max and Greg Borenstein, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Kong: Skull Island]]'', Bill Randa (played by [[John Goodman]]) states that the Monarch agency (first introduced in 2014's ''Godzilla'') specializes in the hunt for Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms.&lt;ref name="monsters exist"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJdpZ4kwV80|title=Monsters Exist - Kong: Skull Island Clip|work=Youtube|date=|accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]'' (2019) retcons the monsters' designation from "MUTOs" to "Titans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/godzilla-2-monster-name-change-titans/|title=Godzilla 2 Has Renamed The MonsterVerse Creatures|first=John|last=Orquiola|work=Screen Rant|date=July 21, 2018|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
[[File:Winged muto kaiju.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Male MUTO featured in ''Godzilla: The Art of Destruction'']]
Upon acquiring the license for [[Godzilla]], Legendary Pictures had planned to feature two new monsters in addition. [[David Callaham]]'s first draft featured early versions of the MUTOs where they were established as ancient enemies of Godzilla but never established as to why. When Gareth Edwards came aboard the project, he created a back story to bridge the gap between Godzilla's connection with the MUTOs. Edwards brainstormed the idea that, "When these Godzillas were on Earth, there was another creature that would kill them and lay its eggs inside their dead bodies. Therefore, if these creatures ever came back, part of their life cycle would be the ability to attract Godzillas to the surface to kill them for reproduction."{{sfn|Cotta Vaz|2014|p=22}}

In an interview, Edwards commented that it took over a year to design the MUTO creatures, stressing that it took that long to create something that was aimed to be new and different for today's day and age. Edwards and the design team looked towards past monster characters from such films as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]'' and ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' for inspiration and reflected back on what made these monsters and their designs so iconic. From this, the design for the MUTO monsters kept evolving and "mutating", according to Edwards, into a design he felt was more cohesive.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|Pa26RU2PHgE|"Godzilla" Director Gareth Edwards explains why monsters still matter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwards has credited artist Matt Allsopp for creating the majority of the MUTO's designs. Edwards stated, "The DNA of the MUTO is 80 to 90 percent from Matt, he was the main guy". Others contributed to the design of the MUTOs as well such as Weta, Rob Bliss, Steambot, and Legacy, who provided a 3-D model of the MUTOs.{{sfn|Cotta Vaz|2014|p=82}}

The film depicts the MUTOs as a [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] species. The female is much larger and walks on eight limbs - the male is much smaller, with one pair of his eight limbs modified into wings for powered flight. Though the MUTOs have an arthropod-like appearance, filmmaker Guillaume Rocheron likened them more to vertebrates.{{sfn|Cotta Vaz|2014|p=82}} The angularity of the male MUTO's wing design was inspired by [[stealth aircraft]].{{sfn|Cotta Vaz|2014|p=114}} As a side-effect of the radiation they absorb as food, the MUTOs are capable of causing electromagnetic interference, and emitting EMP shockwaves from their claws.&lt;ref&gt;[[Godzilla (2014 film)|Godzilla]], 2014, [[Legendary Pictures]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
Oliver Gettell of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the MUTOs "Godzilla's most important co-stars", praising them as threatening antagonists that encourage the audience to root for Godzilla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-godzilla-monstrous-costars-what-do-mutos-mean-for-the-franchise-20140520-story.html|title='Godzilla's' monstrous costars: What do MUTOs mean for the franchise?|last=Gettell|first=Oliver |work=LA Times|date=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some viewers have been critical of the MUTOs' design, which was perceived to be similar to that of the [[Clover (creature)|monster from ''Cloverfield'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/first-descriptions-of-the-new-godzilla-monster-that-is-1542278728|title=First descriptions of the new Godzilla monster (that isn't Godzilla)|last=Woerner|first=Meredith|work=io9|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WatchMojo.com]] listed the MUTOs as #10 on their "Top 10 Godzilla Villains" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4zR__HFvn0|title=Top 10 Godzilla Villains|last=WatchMojo.com|first=|work=Youtube|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mercury-Atlas 7''', launched May 24, 1962, was the fourth flight of [[Project Mercury]], the first manned space program of the United States.  The Mercury spacecraft, named '''''Aurora 7''''', made three Earth orbits, piloted by astronaut [[Scott Carpenter]]. He was the sixth human and the fourth American in space.

A targeting error during reentry took the spacecraft 250 miles (about 400&amp;nbsp;km) off-course, delaying recovery of Carpenter and the spacecraft. The mission used Mercury spacecraft No. 18 and [[Atlas LV-3B|Atlas launch vehicle]] No. 107-D.

===Crew notes===
The original prime crew for Mercury Atlas-7 was to have been [[Deke Slayton]], with Schirra as his back-up. However Slayton was removed from all flight crew availability after the discovery of [[cardiac arrhythmia]] during a training run in the ''g''-loading [[centrifuge]].  Slayton had chosen the name ''Delta 7'' for the spacecraft, as this would have been the fourth manned flight and Delta (Δ) is the fourth letter in the Greek alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americaspace.com/?p=15514 |title="Change in Velocity": The Misfortune of Deke Slayton – Part 1 |last1=Evans |first1=Ben |last2= |first2= |date= |website=americaspace.com |publisher=AmericaSpace |accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of using Schirra who was backup, it was decided to give the mission to Carpenter, who was the backup crew for [[Mercury-Atlas 6]], had trained with John Glenn, and was considered the best prepared astronaut. When Carpenter was given the mission, he renamed it ''Aurora 7'' for the open sky and the dawn, symbolizing the dawn of the new age. The number Seven was also chosen for the Mercury 7 astronauts. In addition, Carpenter's home address in his childhood was the corner of Aurora and Seventh Avenues in Boulder, Colorado.&lt;ref name="Aurora"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.popsci.com/blog-network/vintage-space/mercury-astronaut-scott-carpenter-and-controversy-surrounding-aurora-7|title=Mercury Astronaut Scott Carpenter and the Controversy Surrounding Aurora 7 |last1=Teitel|first1=Amy Shira|website=popsci.com|publisher=Popular Science|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history138"/&gt;

===Preparation===
Mercury spacecraft No. 18 was delivered to [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], Florida on November 15, 1961. While under checkout, the crew changed the periscope and also worked on the drogue parachute, to prevent it from firing prematurely as happened during the previous flight. In addition, a device known as a [446] "low-level commutator" was added, to measure the temperature around the capsule, recording temperature data from 28 positions on the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="history138"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/toc.htm|title=This New Ocean: A History of Project Mercury|last=Swenson Jr.|first=Loyd S.|last2=Grimwood|first2=James M.|last3=Alexander|first3=Charles C.|work=Published as NASA Special Publication-4201 in the NASA History Series|publisher=NASA|year=1989|editor-last=Woods|editor-first=David|chapter=13-8 MA-7 Preparations|format=url|access-date=17 December 2016|editor-last2=Gamble|editor-first2=Chris|chapter-url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch13-8.htm}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atlas vehicle 107D was rolled out of the Convair factory in San Diego, California on February 25, 1962. It was delivered to Cape Canaveral on March 6, 1962.&lt;ref name="Mercurybook"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19630011968_1963011968.pdf|title="Project Mercury: A Chronology"|publisher=NASA|work=NASA report SP-4001|last=Grimwood|first=James M.|year=1963|access-date=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlas 107D incorporated two small changes from 109D (Glenn's booster), specifically removal of an insulation blanket from the common propellant tank bulkhead that was deemed unnecessary and booster jettison changed to one second earlier (T+130 seconds instead of 131 seconds).&lt;ref name="history138"/&gt;

The temperature sensor installation and the correction of the drogue parachute circuit delayed the launch until May.&lt;ref name="history138"/&gt;

A network of ground stations and ships, called the "Mercury network" was arranged around the globe to provide continuous coverage with the spacecraft. On Mercury-Atlas 7, the network consisted of 15 Mercury sites supplemented by several Atlantic Missile Range (AMR) stations, and the Goddard Space Flight Center.&lt;ref name="results"/&gt; [[Capsule communicator|CAPCOM]]s were operating from different stations around the world, to communicate with Carpenter. [[Gus Grissom]] was the CAPCOM in Cape Canaveral.&lt;ref name="Gus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacerace.com/people/grissom.php|title=Virgil Ivan "Gus" Grissom|publisher=The space race|access-date=19 December 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160802085118/http://thespacerace.com/people/grissom.php|archivedate=2 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Shepard]] was the CAPCOM at California.&lt;ref name="history139"/&gt;

===Scientific experiments===
The focus of Carpenter's five-hour mission was on science. The full flight plan included the first study of liquids in weightlessness, Earth photography, and an unsuccessful attempt to observe a flare fired from the ground.

One of the experiments would include releasing a multi-colored balloon that would remain tethered to the capsule, observing the behavior of liquid in a weightless state inside a closed glass bottle, using a special light meter to determine the visibility of a ground flare, making weather photographs with hand-held cameras, and studying the airglow layer - for which Carpenter would receive special training. The tethered balloon was a 30-inch mylar inflatable sphere, which was folded, packaged, and housed with its gas expansion bottle in the antenna canister. The whole balloon package weighed two pounds. Divided into five sections of different colors - uncolored aluminum, yellow, orange, white, and a phosphorescent coating that appeared white by day and blue by night - the balloon was to be cast off near perigee after the first orbital pass to float freely at the end of a 100-foot nylon line. The purposes of the balloon experiment were to study the effects of space on the reflection properties of colored surfaces through visual observation and photographic studies and to obtain aerodynamic drag measurements by use of a strain gauge&lt;ref name="history138"/&gt;

===During flight===
[[File:Aurora 7 launch.jpg|thumb|left|upright|MA-7 launch]]

Carpenter was awakened at 1:15 AM on the morning of the flight and ate a breakfast of orange juice, filet mignon, eggs, toast, and coffee.&lt;ref name="history139"/&gt; Prior to insertion in the capsule, he was administered a hydration regimen of water, juice, coffee, and sweet tea. He ascended into the gantry at 4:36, and entered the spacecraft at 4:43.&lt;ref name="NasaTec"/&gt; Unlike Mercury-Atlas 6, there was no problem with the sealing bolts.

Launch occurred at 7:45 AM (Florida time) on 24 May 1962.&lt;ref name="NasaTec"&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.scottcarpenter.com/MA-7%20Description%20and%20Performance%20Analysis.pdf|title="SECOND UNITED STATES MANNED THREE-PASS ORBITAL MISSION (MERCURY-ATLAS 7, SPACECRAFT 18) DESCRIPTION AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS" NASA technical note TN-D 3814|date=February 1967|last=Boynton|first=John H.|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Launch vehicle performance was overall excellent with one small anomaly in that one of the sustainer engine's hydraulic switches moved to the abort position at T+265 seconds, because a faulty pressure transducer produced an erroneous reading indicating loss of hydraulic pressure. However, since another transducer indicated correct pressure levels until after Sustainer Engine Cut-Off (SECO), the launch proceeded normally (both switches had to be tripped for the ASIS system to generate an abort signal). The Atlas's flight path was so accurate that ''Aurora 7'' reached almost the exact orbital parameters planned for the mission. SECO occurred at T+309 seconds and capsule separation at T+312 seconds.

Carpenter had solid food items for the first time (in the form of freeze-dried cubes in a plastic bag) instead of paste squeezed out of a tube, which produced problems with loose crumbs floating inside the cabin. The food cubes had been coated with an anti-crumbling agent, however they may have accidentally been crushed prior to launch, breaking the coating. Carpenter expressed concern about crumbs being sucked into ventilation intakes in the capsule, in addition, a candy bar included in the food supply melted from high cabin temperatures (up to 102&amp;nbsp;°F). By the end of the second orbit, he informed Mercury Control that most of the food was a mess and he would avoid touching it for the rest of the flight aside from taking a [[xylose]] capsule.&lt;ref name="NasaTec"/&gt;

With each orbit sunrise, Carpenter also saw the "fireflies". He saw the particles more like snowflakes than fireflies. He also noted that the particles did not seem to be truly luminous, and varied in size, brightness, and color. Some were gray, some were white, and one in particular, said Carpenter, looked like a helical shaving from a lathe. Although they seemed to travel at different speeds, they did not move out and away from the spacecraft as the confetti had in the balloon experiment.&lt;ref name="history139"/&gt;

Carpenter also took 19 photos of the flattened sun at orbit sunset.&lt;ref name="history139"/&gt;

At dawn of the third and final orbit, Carpenter inadvertently bumped his hand against the inside wall of the cabin and solved a mystery from the [[Mercury-Atlas 6|previous flight]]. The resulting bright shower of particles outside the spacecraft - what [[John Glenn]] had called "fireflies" - turned out to be ice particles shaken loose from the spacecraft's exterior. Near the end of the flight, Carpenter found that by banging his hand against the wall of the capsule, he could shake more "fireflies" loose. At first, it was thought that the particles could be marker dye or shark repellant, both green-colored, however, testing confirmed that neither of those were likely to escape from their packages in zero gravity.&lt;ref name="results"&gt;{{cite report|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19620004691_1962004691.pdf|title="Results of the Second U.S. Manned Orbital Space Flight" NASA report |date=24 May 1962|publisher=NASA|access-date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was then suspected that the fireflies were either steam from the life support system turning into the snow when exposed to open space or debris on the exterior of the spacecraft being shaken loose, however, the former was considered the more probable explanation. Steam generated by the life support system formed condensation between the spacecraft bulkhead and the heat shield which then escaped into space and froze.&lt;ref name="results"/&gt;

Like Glenn, Carpenter circled the Earth three times. Total time weightless 4&amp;nbsp;h 39&amp;nbsp;min 32&amp;nbsp;s. The performance of the Mercury spacecraft and Atlas launch vehicle was excellent in nearly every respect. All primary mission objectives were achieved. The single mission-critical malfunction which occurred involved a failure in the spacecraft pitch horizon scanner, a component of the automatic control system. This anomaly was adequately compensated for by the pilot in subsequent in-flight operations so that the success of the mission was not compromised. A modification of the spacecraft control-system thrust units was effective. Cabin and pressure-suit temperatures were high but not intolerable. Some uncertainties in the data telemetered from the bioinstrumentation prevailed at times during the flight; however, associated information was available which indicated continued well-being of the astronaut.

Equipment was included in the spacecraft which provided valuable scientific information; notably that regarding liquid behavior in a weightless state, identification of the airglow layer observed by Astronaut Glenn, and photography of terrestrial features and meteorological phenomena. An experiment which was to provide atmospheric drag and color visibility data in space through the deployment of an inflatable sphere was partially successful. The flight further qualified the Mercury spacecraft systems for manned orbital operations and provided evidence for progressing into missions of extended duration and consequently more demanding systems requirements.

===Landing===
Passing over Hawaii at the final orbit, flight director [[Christopher_C._Kraft_Jr.|Kraft]] told Carpenter to begin his retrofire countdown and to shift from manual control to the automatic attitude control. Partly because he had been distracted watching the fireflies Carpenter noted that he had begun his landing preparations late. As he started to align the spacecraft he found that the automatic stabilization system would not hold the required 34-degree pitch and zero-degree yaw attitude. While trying to determine the source of the trouble, he fell behind in his check of other items. When he hurriedly switched to the fly-by-wire control mode, he forgot to switch off the manual system. As a result, both systems were used redundantly together for 10 minutes, and fuel was wasted.&lt;ref name="history139"/&gt; 

In addition to the attitude error, Carpenter also activated the retrorockets three seconds late, adding another 15 miles or so to the trajectory error. Due to lack of fuel Carpenter overshot his planned reentry mark and splashed down {{convert|250|mi|km}} from the target.

After several hours of frantic searching, Carpenter was located in an area northeast of [[Puerto Rico]] and taken aboard the aircraft carrier {{USS|Intrepid|CV-11|6}}. Other than slight exhaustion, he was in good health and spirits and postflight medical exams did not find any significant physical changes or anomalies.

Kraft, however, was unhappy with the astronaut's performance due to his needlessly high expenditure of attitude control fuel, which resulted in reentry and landing taking place well off-course. And so Carpenter was sidelined for future missions. He left the space program in 1964 to participate in the Navy's [[SEALAB]] program.

'''Mercedes''' "'''Misty'''" '''Knight''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Tony Isabella]] and [[Arvell Jones]], Knight was first mentioned (by name) in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #20 (January 1975) and appeared in the next issue. 

Within the context of the [[Marvel Universe]], Knight is a former [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] police officer, whose arm was amputated following a bomb attack. After receiving a bionic prosthetic from [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], she started a private-investigation agency with close friend, [[Colleen Wing]]. The two would later form the crime-fighting duo [[Daughters of the Dragon]]. As private investigators, Knight and Wing frequently work with [[Heroes for Hire]]: [[Luke Cage]] and [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]. In 2013, Knight became co-leader of the [[Valkyrior]] with [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]] in ''[[Fearless Defenders]]'' #1 by [[Cullen Bunn]] and [[Will Sliney]].

[[Simone Missick]] portrays the character in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] television series ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', and the [[Iron Fist (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]''.

==Publication history==
Misty Knight was first mentioned in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #20 (January 1975) and was created by writer [[Tony Isabella]] with artist [[Arvell Jones]].  A later [[retcon]] in ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' (1st series)  #64 by [[Chris Claremont]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] would reveal she had previously appeared as an unnamed character in ''Marvel Team-Up'' (1st series) #1 (March 1972), written by [[Roy Thomas]] and penciled by [[Ross Andru]]. Comics in which Knight and [[Colleen Wing]] have starred include a storyline first printed in ''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu'' #32–33 (January — February 1977) and ''Bizarre Adventures'' #25 (March 1981) by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and penciller [[Marshall Rogers]]. The original depictions of Knight, a bionically enhanced [[African American|black]] female [[detective]] with [[martial arts]] skills, were strongly influenced by the [[blaxploitation]] and [[Kung Fu]] [[fad|craze]]s of the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Misty Knight and Iron Fist had the first interracial kiss between super heroes in mainstream comics in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2017/03/iron-fist-marvel-comics-facts/misty-knight|title= Everything You Need to Know About 'Iron Fist'|author= Khal|date= March 14, 2017|publisher= Complex|accessdate=December 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She was a longtime supporting character in comic books such as ''[[X-Men]]'' and ''[[Power Man and Iron Fist]]''; she also had a major role in the ''[[Deathlok]]'' story arc 'Souls of Cyber-Folk' that ran from issue 2–5 of the 1991 ''Deathlok'' series (Vol. 2). The character, alongside her partner [[Colleen Wing]], starred in ''[[Daughters of the Dragon]]'', a 2005 six-issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] by writers [[Justin Gray]] and [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and penciller [[Khari Evans]]. Knight is one of the stars of the 2006 ''[[Heroes for Hire]]'' series as well as a supporting character in the ongoing series ''The Immortal Iron Fist''.

In 2010, Knight appears in the crossover event "[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]", and is the central character in the spin-off title ''Shadowland: Blood on the Street''. She then goes on to star in the new version of ''Heroes for Hire''. Knight appears in the 2013 series ''[[Fearless Defenders]]'', by [[Cullen Bunn]] and [[Will Sliney]].&lt;ref name="Fearless"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/fearless-defenders-marvel-now-cullen-bunn.html |title=Marvel NOW!

==Fictional character biography==
Misty Knight was a rising star with the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] when she was seriously injured preventing a bomb attack that forced the amputation of her right arm. Rather than take a desk job, she resigned from the police force, though she remained good friends with her long-time partner on the force [[Rafael Scarfe]]. [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] provided her a [[bionic]] arm which endowed her superhuman strength. Soon after that, she met [[Spider-Man]]&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Team-Up'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; and then [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Premiere'' #15&lt;/ref&gt; Misty roomed with [[X-Men]] member [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]] until Marvel Girl returned to her life as an X-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' Vol. 1 #102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Years later, it was revealed that Misty's roommate was actually the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]] disguised as Jean.  ''Avengers'' #263; ''Fantastic Four'' #286&lt;/ref&gt;

Misty teamed with her friend [[Colleen Wing]] in fighting the criminal Emil Vachon in the Hong-Kong area. She saved Colleen from an attempted rape.&lt;ref&gt;''Deadly Hands of Kung-Fu'' #32–33&lt;/ref&gt; She then set up a [[private investigator|private detective]] agency with Colleen entitled: "Nightwing Restorations Ltd."

Soon after she first met Iron Fist, the two crime fighters fell in love. Misty conducted undercover work against the crime lord [[Bushmaster (Marvel Comics)#John McIver|John Bushmaster]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Fist'' #15&lt;/ref&gt; She aided Iron Fist, Spider-Man, and Colleen Wing against Davos, the [[Steel Serpent]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Team-Up'' #64&lt;/ref&gt; She then first met and fought [[Luke Cage|Luke Cage, Power Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''Power Man'' #48&lt;/ref&gt; Misty's "Knightwing Restorations Ltd" detective agency would go on to help Power Man and Iron Fist's [[Heroes for Hire]] agency on numerous cases. Misty aided Iron Fist and Power Man in rescuing captives of John Bushmaster, and procured a videotape clearing Cage of crimes.&lt;ref&gt;''Power Man'' #49&lt;/ref&gt; Misty was then captured and nearly killed by [[Nightshade (Marvel Comics)|Nightshade]].&lt;ref&gt;''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #51–53&lt;/ref&gt; She then helped the X-Men, Colleen Wing, and [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]] against [[Moses Magnum]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #118–119&lt;/ref&gt; She fought [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]],&lt;ref&gt;''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #66. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; and then fought [[Constrictor (comics)|Constrictor]] and Sabretooth together, and was rescued by [[El Aguila]].&lt;ref&gt;''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #78. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; She escaped captivity, and captured [[Ward Meachum]].&lt;ref&gt;''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #99. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Colleen Wing later broke off her friendship with Misty due to Misty's relationship with Tyrone King.&lt;ref&gt;''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #117. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Misty rescued Iron Fist from drowning, reconciled with him, and ended her relationship with Tyrone King.&lt;ref&gt;''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #122. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when Iron Fist broke up with her, Misty began a short romance with Power Man. This episode was a source of tension between Power Man and Iron Fist for a brief period.

Misty later learned of Iron Fist's apparent demise.&lt;ref&gt;''Power Man and Iron Fist'' #125. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Iron Fist was presumed dead for an extended period, until Misty saw the [[Super-Skrull]] impersonate Danny Rand (Iron Fist) on television.&lt;ref&gt;''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #8. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; She confronted the Super-Skrull in his guise as Danny Rand.&lt;ref&gt;''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #10. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Misty assisted [[Namor|Namor the Sub-Mariner]] in finding and saving the hero. They went to the [[Savage Land]], where they learned that the Super-Skrull had been posing as Iron Fist, and Misty aided Namor and [[Namorita]] against the Super-Skrull.&lt;ref&gt;''Namor the Sub-Mariner'' #16–18. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; She and Danny Rand were ultimately reunited and renewed their relationship.

During the 2006 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline, Misty Knight and Colleen Wing were contacted by Iron Man, Reed Richards, and Spider-Man to re-form [[Heroes for Hire]] in order to track down superhumans who refused to register. Initially hesitant, the pair eventually agree creating a team including [[Shang-Chi]], Humbug, Orka, Black Cat, Paladin, and a new Tarantula.&lt;ref&gt;''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #1&lt;/ref&gt; Misty has been identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who will be a part of the [[Fifty State Initiative|Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'' #1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120526061017/http://www.marvel.com/news/comicstories.947 |archivedate=2012-05-26 |df= }} ''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1 Character Map&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Civil War between the superheroes ended, Iron Fist was shocked to find that Misty had sided with the Initiative as he had joined the New Avengers.&lt;ref&gt;''Immortal Iron Fist'' {{Issue|date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, when the [[Steel Serpent]] and [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] plotted to kill Iron Fist and destroy the seven cities of heaven (the latter unbeknownst to Steel Serpent), Misty and Colleen rushed with Luke Cage to Danny's aid.&lt;ref&gt;''Immortal Iron Fist'' #9. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, the three helped Danny stop a terrorist attack by HYDRA on the mystical city of K'un L'un where Danny told Misty, "I love you, Misty... but I make a lousy boyfriend."&lt;ref&gt;''Immortal Iron Fist'' # 11. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Danny said this, they continued a sexual relationship and finally committed to each other on his birthday, despite their disagreement over the Superhuman Registration Act.&lt;ref&gt;''Immortal Iron Fist'' # 16–17. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning from a mission to capture [[Moon-Boy]] during the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' storyline, Heroes for Hire arrive in New York to see that it has been taken over by the Hulk. After being captured by [[Warbound]], Colleen Wing and [[Tarantula (Marvel Comics)|Tarantula]] were offered to No-Name the Brood Queen by their possessed teammate [[Humbug (comics)|Humbug]].&lt;ref&gt;''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #13. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Misty makes a deal with Paladin to take [[Moon-Boy]] (whom Colleen had become attached to) in order to find both Colleen and Tarantula after their capture.&lt;ref&gt;''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #14. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; When Misty and the other heroes come save them, Colleen is in traumatic shock from the torture she endured; she is further agitated when Moon-Boy is taken into custody by [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #9&lt;/ref&gt;  Colleen, deeply upset by her friend's actions, leaves the group as a result.&lt;ref name="Heroes for Hire vol. 2 #15"&gt;''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #15&lt;/ref&gt; Heroes for Hire itself has disbanded permanently in the aftermath of this.&lt;ref name="Heroes for Hire vol. 2 #15"/&gt; Misty becomes depressed due to her actions that led to the breakup of the group. Iron Man later comes to her to enlist her aid in stopping the Hulk's remaining robots; through this, she was able to move past her mistakes.&lt;ref name="World War Hulk: Aftersmash #1"&gt;''World War Hulk: Aftersmash'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Misty and Danny move in with each other in [[Harlem]]. Danny proposes to Misty and she accepts, after that she tells him that she is pregnant with his child.&lt;ref&gt;''Immortal Iron Fist'' #27&lt;/ref&gt; They have since found out that this was a [[false pregnancy]], causing a strain on their relationship. They decide to move out of their apartment and live separately, but continue their relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''I am an Avenger'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2010 "[[Shadowland (comics)|Shadowland]]" storyline, Misty, Colleen Wing, Iron Fist, Luke Cage, and Shang-Chi confront him in attempt to stop him without violence. After a commotion happens elsewhere in his castle, he attacks the group, believing they are responsible.&lt;ref&gt;''Shadowland'' #2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Misty teams up with Paladin, [[Silver Sable]] and the [[Shroud (comics)|Shroud]] to discover who is framing the [[The Hand (comics)|Hand]] for the murder of a number of New York's mobsters.&lt;ref&gt;''Shadowland: Blood on the Street'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the events of the "Shadowland" storyline, Misty revamps the Heroes for Hire concept by basing herself as 'control' and utilizing various street heroes based on their powers and abilities in exchange for money or information. At the end of the first issue, it is revealed that Misty is being manipulated by the [[Puppet Master (Marvel Comics)|Puppet Master]].&lt;ref&gt;''Heroes for Hire'' #1 (2010). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Misty is later freed from mind control with help from Iron Fist and [[Paladin (comics)|Paladin]]. After being freed, Paladin approaches Misty to continue the operation Puppet Master set in place, but on her terms.&lt;ref&gt;''Heroes for Hire'' #5 (2010). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Marvel NOW!]] initiative, Misty Knight showcases in the comic book alongside Valkyrie where she is one of the members of the [[Fearless Defenders]].&lt;ref&gt;''Fearless Defenders'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Misty Knight appears during the 2015–17 [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]] promotion as a supporting character to [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], the new Captain America, who is uneasy now that his friend [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] has regained his original moniker. Though the two men opt to share the name, many civilians in the Marvel Universe feel that Sam Wilson is undeserving of the title. Misty helps him deal with his doubts and is revealed to be in a sexual relationship with him as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #10 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; She then helps clear the names of female heroes and villains, who fell victim to a scandal over embarrassing sex videos posted on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America: Sam Wilson'' #16&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "[[Hunt for Wolverine]]" storyline, Misty Knight has left the NYPD for an unknown reason. She is approached by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Nur (comics)|Nur]] who enlist her to help find [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] after his body goes missing from it's unmarked grave. She takes them to an information broker that she knows who turns out to be [[Cypher (Marvel Comics)|Cypher]]. When Nur hands him a smartphone, Cypher makes use of it and tells Daredevil, Misty Knight, and Nur about the different Wolverine sightings in the past sixty days.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunt for Wolverine: Weapon Lost'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Using an Attilan Security Force Skycharger that was "borrowed" from the Inhumans, Daredevil, Misty Knight, Nur, and Cypher investigate the sightings of Wolverine in Manhattan, Phoenix, and Chicago. Misty Knight and Nur arrive at McCarthy Medical Institute in Manhattan where Jane Foster was enrolled and learned that an unnamed man delivered flowers. The security footage revealed that it was by someone that resembled Wolverine. In Chicago, Misty Knight learns from a security guard that he deleted a post when he thought he saw Wolverine. When it came to Saskatchewan, they hear that Ranger Outpost Nine in Meadowlake Provincial Park was attacked by a man with claws. When they arrive, Daredevil, Misty Knight, and Nur find the males dead and the female missing as they head into the forest to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunt for Wolverine: Weapon Lost'' #2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; When they find Cypher on the ground with a slit throat, Nur works to heal Cypher as Daredevil and Misty Knight discover that the attacker is [[Albert (comics)|Albert]] as they fight him. When Albert grabs Daredevil by the neck and demands to know what he did to [[Elsie-Dee]], Misty Knight combines her bionic arm's attacks with Nur's gun and a recovered Cypher's laser to deactivate Albert as they leave an anonymous tip for the Canadian authorities to come pick him up. Upon returning to Chicago, Daredevil, Misty Knight, and Nur visit the security guard she questioned again only to find him dead and a bomb nearby as it goes off.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunt for Wolverine: Weapon Lost'' #3. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Misty Knight's cybernetic arm manifested a shield big enough to protect her, Daredevil, and Nur from the explosion. Then they worked to evacuate those who couldn't get out of the burning building. Nur reveals to Misty Knight that his eyes also work like a camera flash as he analyzed the apartment before it blew up. His analysis revealed that the security guard worked for a group called Soteira which was listed as an asset management company. Daredevil, Misty Knight, and Nur head to one of their offices in Chicago where Daredevil's radar detects the people inside purging their records. As the group crashes through the window, Nur holds the workers a gunpoint as Cypher works to see if he can stop whatever they were doing on the computer. Misty Knight works to protect Cypher who retrieves the data as the four of them escape from the Level Four Killteam. When Misty Knight asks what to do next, Daredevil states that he is grateful for their help as this is no longer a missing persons case. As Nur asks what he plans to do with the drive after getting him, Misty Knight, and Cypher back to New York, Daredevil says that he is giving it to Kitty Pryde while informing her on who else is looking for Wolverine and what they are walking into. Nur recaps his wife leaving him following his Terrigenesis and tells Misty Knight that he looks forward to working with her again.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunt for Wolverine: Weapon Lost'' #4. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Misty Knight is a highly skilled combatant who, in addition to her police-combat training, is proficient in [[martial arts]] and possesses near-perfect aim with firearms. She is a superb detective, having graduated at the top of her class at the police academy and earned a degree in criminology from the [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;''Iron Fist'', vol. 1 #7&lt;/ref&gt; Her bionic arm is superhumanly strong, and she can punch a target with incredible force, or crush objects as tough as steel in her vise-like grip. Since the rest of her body is not cybernetically enhanced, she cannot lift objects heavier than her back, shoulders, and legs can physically support. Her arm's advantages as a weapon are limited to kinetic crushing and impact forces.

Her original bionic right arm was constructed from steel, and designed by Stark International. Her new arm was built by [[Stark Industries]] and is an alloy of [[vibranium|Antarctic vibranium]] and [[diamond]]; at close range it can liquefy all known metals, including [[adamantium]]. It is now able to generate a wide anti-gravity repulsor field similar to [[Iron Man's armor]].&lt;ref&gt;''Daughters of the Dragon'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;  It can apparently release a concentrated beam of cryogenic energy, which can cover a target in a blanket of ice from a distance. This cold seems to make the target much more fragile, allowing otherwise durable materials to be broken or rended when frozen.&lt;ref&gt;''Heroes for Hire'' #7 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Iron Man revealed the arm also displays technopathic capabilities, teaching Misty how to control a horde of robots.&lt;ref name="World War Hulk: Aftersmash #1"/&gt; Following her "pregnancy", Danny Rand spent money on additional features to the arm, including magnetism and a concussive blast.&lt;ref&gt;''Shadowland: Blood on the Street'' #1–3&lt;/ref&gt;

===MC2===
In the alternate future of the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] universe, Misty eventually settled down and married Iron Fist. Unfortunately, at some point in the past, she died of cancer.

While investigating a "Paul Maitreya", a cult leader who resembles the [[Silver Surfer]], she encounters a bald-headed woman who shoots Paul and his cult before escaping Misty. This woman appears to be one of an army of genetic clones of Heather Douglas a.k.a. [[Moondragon]].{{issue|date=March 2013}}

It was revealed within the past that Misty was originally placed in Luke Cage's Avengers as an NYPD spy operating under [[Thunderbird (comics)|John Proudstar]], but defected to the Avengers after refusing Proudstar's order to kill Cage.&lt;ref&gt;''House of M: Avengers'' #2-#3. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Misty eventually became Luke's lover, after some time has passed since the [[Taskmaster (comics)|Taskmaster]]'s murder of Tigra. It was Misty who realized that Luke's Avengers were inspiring non-mutants to fight for their rights as "Sapien" and tried to convince Cage to think beyond protecting Sapien Town.&lt;ref&gt;''House of M: Avengers'' #4 &amp; #5. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7845">'''al-Malik al-Afdal Najm ad-Din Ayyub ibn Shadhi ibn Marwan''' (Arabic: الملك ألأفضل نجم الدين أيوب بن شاﺬي بن مروان) (died August 9, 1173) was a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] soldier and politician from [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]],&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Malcolm Cameron and David Edward Pritchett Jackson, ''Saladin: The Politics of the Holy War'', (Cambridge University Press, 1982), 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and the father of [[Saladin]].&lt;ref&gt;George F. Nafziger; Mark W. Walton, ''Islam at War: A History'', (Praeger, 2003),  42.{{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is eponymous ancestor of the [[Ayyubid dynasty]].

==Life and career==

Ayyub was the son of Shadhi ibn Marwan and brother of [[Shirkuh]]. The family belonged to the tribe of Revend or Revendi, also [[Rawadid|Rawadiya]],&lt;ref&gt;Sherefkhan Bedlisi "Sherefname" Translation: Ziya Avci&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Minorsky"&gt;[[Vladimir Minorsky]], Prehistory of Saladin http://rbedrosian.com/Ref/Minorsky/vmpsal1.htm#124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Sharafnam̂a, or, The history of the Kurdish nation, 1597, Translation: Mehrdad Izady&lt;/ref&gt;
itself a branch of the [[Hadhabani]] tribe. The earliest form of the name is written "Rewend" in the [[Sharafnama]].  According to [[Vladimir Minorsky]], this could have been a corruption of the Arabic name "Rawadiya". In contrast, the name of "Rewend" or in some cases "Revend" means "Nomad" in Kurdish and this name was mostly applied to nomad Kurdish tribes in the region.  Minorsky thus leaves space for a possible Arabic influence on the tribe, although they are generally considered to be Kurdish. Furthermore, Minorsky states that the rulers of  the tribe could have given their name to it.  In other words, it is possible that the Rewend/Rawadiya rulers were of Arab origin,&lt;ref name="Minorsky" /&gt; and arrived in the Dvin region in 758 CE from the Arbela (modern [[Arbil]]) region. Further it should be considered that Vladimir Minorsky's research was based upon subjective writings of Kurdish medieval historian Ibn Athir.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Minorsky, The Prehistory of Saladin, Studies in Caucasian History, Cambridge University Press, 1957, pp.&amp;nbsp;124–132: 'The medieval historian Ibn Athir relates a passage from another commander: "...both you and Saladin are Kurds and you will not let power pass into the hands of...&lt;/ref&gt;

The family were closely connected to the [[Shaddadid]] dynasty, and when the last Shaddadid was deposed in Dvin in 1130, Shadhi moved the family first to [[Baghdad]] and then to [[Tikrit]], where he was appointed governor by the regional administrator Bihruz. Ayyub succeeded his father as governor of Tikrit when Shadhi died soon after.

In 1132 Ayyub was in the service of [[Imad ad-Din Zengi]]. He participated in a battle against the  [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk Sultan]] near Tikrit and saved Zengi's life when he assisted his retreat across the [[Tigris]]. In 1136, Shirkuh killed a Christian with whom he was quarrelling in Tikrit, and the brothers were exiled (Ayyub's son Yusuf, later known as Saladin, was supposedly born the night they left). Zengi later appointed Ayyub governor of [[Baalbek]], and when the town was besieged in 1146 by [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur]], the [[atabeg]] of the [[Burid dynasty|Burid]] emir of [[Damascus]], Ayyub surrendered it and retired to Damascus. Shirkuh, meanwhile, entered the service of Zengi's son [[Nur ad-Din Zengi]], who had designs on Damascus; when the [[Second Crusade]] [[Siege of Damascus (1148)|besieged the city]] in 1148, Nur ad-Din forced Mu'in ad-Din and the Burids into a reluctant alliance. Soon Nur ad-Din demanded the city be handed over to him, and Ayyub and Shirkuh negotiated its surrender in 1154. Ayyub remained governor of Damascus under Nur ad-Din's rule. He was held in such honour that he was the only one of Nur ad-Din's officials allowed to remain seated in his presence.

Ayyub's son Saladin also took up service with Nur ad-Din, and he was sent to [[Egypt]] to take control in Nur ad-Din's name during the period of joint [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|crusader]]-[[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] invasions. In 1170 Ayyub joined him there, either summoned by Saladin himself, or sent by Nur ad-Din to convince Saladin to depose the last [[Fatimid]] caliph. Saladin offered the vizierate to him, but he refused, and instead was granted [[Alexandria]], [[Damietta]], and [[Beheira Governorate|Al Buhayrah]] as personal fiefs. Many of Saladin's other relatives also joined him in Egypt. Nur ad-Din did not trust Saladin and his family, correctly assuming that they were consolidating power against him; Ayyub publicly supported Nur ad-Din, but privately warned his son that Nur ad-Din should never be allowed to take Egypt from him.

==Death==

Najm ad-Din Ayyub was injured in a horse riding accident on July 31, 1173, and died on August 9. His death exacerbated the tension between Saladin and Nur ad-Din; the latter had summoned the former to assist in an expedition against the Kingdom of Jerusalem, but Saladin returned home when he heard of his father's death. However the expected confrontation between Nur ad-Din and Saladin did not occur, as Nur ad-Din died the next year, and Saladin eventually took control of the whole of Egypt and Syria.

According to [[Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad]], Ayyub was "a noble, generous man, mild and of excellent character." He was also "passionately fond of [[polo]]". [[Ibn al-Qalanisi]] calls him "a man of resolution, intelligence and knowledge of affairs", who prudently handed over Baalbek to a superior force in return for rewards and honours.

His given name was Ayyub ([[Job (Bible)|Job]]), from which comes the [[Ayyubid dynasty]] of Saladin and his successors. Najm ad-Din is an honorific meaning "star of the faith".

==Family and children==
Ayyub had several children:
*Nur ad-Din Shahanshah (died 1148)
*[[Saladin|Salah ad-Din Yusuf]] (1137–1193)
*[[al-Adil I|al-Malik al-Adil Sayf ad-Din Abu Bakr Ahmad]] (1145–1218)

'''Odessa Lee Clay''' ([[née]] '''O'Grady'''; February 12, 1917 – August 20, 1994) was the mother of three-time [[List of heavyweight boxing champions|World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Rahman Ali]], and the grandmother of [[Laila Ali]].&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Dream |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,896687,00.html |quote=Odessa Grady Clay is a short, pillowy woman who has 12 cats with freckled fawn skin and an expensive orthodontist. ...|work=[[Time magazine]] |date=March 22, 1963 |accessdate=2009-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Young Cassius Clay |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1003337/4/index.htm |quote=Clay was his mother's son.

==Early life==
She was born in [[Hopkins County, Kentucky]], one of six children of John Lewis O'Grady and Birdie B. Morehead.  Her paternal grandfather was a white [[Irish people|Irishman]] named Abe O'Grady, who emigrated to the [[United States]] from [[Ennis]], [[County Clare]], soon after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and married a daughter of Lewis and Amanda J. "Mandy" Walker of Todd County, Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Muhammad Ali's warm Irish welcome |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8232367.stm |quote=Ali's ancestor, Abe Grady, lived on the Turnpike Road in the town, before moving in the 1860s to the US, where he married an African-American freed slave. |work=[[BBC]] |date=September 1, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6817619.ece "Muhammad Ali the Irishman given hero's welcome in Ennis, County Clare",] ''[[The Times]]'', September 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Her maternal grandfather, Tom Morehead, was the son of a white Morehead and a slave named Dinah.  Morehead served in the 122nd [[United States Colored Troops|USCT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishculturalsociety.com/essaysandmisc/muhammadali.html |title=Irish Cultural Society of San Antonio |website=Irishculturalsociety.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Growing Up Scared in Louisville |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1078435/index.htm |quote=More than once Odessa Clay had her husband brought into court for roughing her up. Cassius Sr. was also picked up for reckless driving, disorderly conduct, assault and battery, always after he had been drinking. As another old friend put it, "The father isn't a criminal or even an evil man. He's just a frustrated little guy who can't drink. He never served any time and he never will. |work=[[Sports Illustrated]] |date=April 18, 1966 |accessdate=2009-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay's parents separated when she was young,&lt;ref name=Hauser18&gt;Hauser, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; and her mother worked as a maid, taking care of the household chores and the young children of a white family.  Clay was raised partly by her aunt.&lt;ref name=Hauser18/&gt;  When she became an adolescent, she dropped out of school and also found work as a domestic.  Then, when she was sixteen years old, she met twenty-year-old Cassius, whom everyone referred to as "Cash".  They soon married and settled into their own house in [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hachettebookgroupusa.com/books/44/031610843X/chapter_excerpt20367.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 28, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221643/http://www.hachettebookgroupusa.com/books/44/031610843X/chapter_excerpt20367.html |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Clays' marriage was troubled.  Ali told boxing promoters, "She's afraid of him."&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

==Influence on Muhammad Ali==
Through her strong [[Christian]] belief, Clay had a great influence on the life and spiritual upbringing of both of her sons. Muhammad Ali later said, "My mother is a [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|Baptist]], and when I was growing up, she taught me all she knew about God. Every Sunday, she dressed me up, took me and my brother to church, and taught us the way she thought was right. She taught us to love people and treat everybody with kindness. She taught us it was wrong to be prejudiced or hate. I've changed my religion and some of my beliefs since then, but her God is still God; I just call him by a different name. And my mother, I'll tell you what I've told people for a long time. She's a sweet, fat, wonderful woman, who loves to cook, eat, make clothes, and be with family. She doesn't drink, smoke, meddle in other people's business, or bother anyone, and there's no one who's been better to me my whole life."&lt;ref&gt;Hauser, Thomas. [https://www.amazon.com/Muhammad-Ali-His-Life-Times/dp/product-description/0671779710 ''Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Clay supported and inspired her son throughout his boxing career.  At small gyms early in her son's career and later at international arenas when he became world-famous, Clay traveled with her son and was a ring-side regular at his bouts.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Ali's Mother Is Dead at 77 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03E2D71539F930A1575BC0A962958260 |quote=Odessa Lee Grady Clay, mother of the three-time heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali, died Sunday at the Hurstbourne Health Center, a nursing home.

After discovering boxing, it was his mother with whom he shared his dreams of greatness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gregoryallenhoward.com/powerofdreams.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 19, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629093016/http://www.gregoryallenhoward.com/powerofdreams.html |archivedate=June 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
Clay's husband died in 1990.  Odessa Clay died of heart failure on August 20, 1994, at Hurstbourne Health Center, a nursing home in the [[Louisville, Kentucky]] area.  She had been disabled by a stroke since February 1994, according to a family friend.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Odessa Lee Grady Clay, 77, mother of boxing legend Muhammad Ali, dies |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_n19_v86/ai_15779841 |quote= Odessa Lee Grady Clay, 77, mother of three-time heavyweight champ Muhammad Ali, died recently of heart failure at a nursing home in the Louisville, KY, area.

'''Parental investment''', in [[evolutionary biology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]], is any parental expenditure (e.g. time, energy, resources) that benefits [[offspring]].&lt;ref name=Clutton-Brock1991&gt;Clutton-Brock, T.H. 1991. ''The Evolution of Parental Care''.  Princeton, NJ: Princeton U. Press. pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Trivers1972&gt;Trivers, R.L. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Ed.), ''Sexual selection and the descent of man'', 1871-1971 (pp.&amp;nbsp;136–179). Chicago, IL: Aldine. {{ISBN|0-435-62157-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Parental investment may be performed by both males and females (biparental care), females alone (exclusive maternal care) or males alone (exclusive [[paternal care]]). Care can be provided at any stage of the offspring's life, from pre-natal (e.g. egg guarding and incubation in birds, and placental nourishment in mammals) to post-natal (e.g. food provisioning and protection of offspring).

In 1930, [[Ronald Fisher]] wrote ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5962/bhl.title.27468|title=The genetical theory of natural selection.|last=Fisher|first=Ronald Aylmer|date=1930|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he introduced the modern concept of parental investment, introduced the [[sexy son hypothesis]], and introduced [[Fisher's principle]]. In 1948, [[Angus John Bateman]] published an influential study of fruit flies in which he concluded that because female gametes are more costly to produce than male gametes, the reproductive success of females was limited by the ability to produce ovum, and the reproductive success of males was limited by access to females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bateman|first=A J|date=1948-12|title=Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/hdy.1948.21|journal=Heredity|volume=2|issue=3|pages=349–368|doi=10.1038/hdy.1948.21|issn=0018-067X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[Trivers|Robert Trivers']] continued this line of thinking with his proposal of parental investment theory, which describes how parental investment affects sexual behavior. He concludes that the sex that has higher parental investment will be more selective when choosing a mate.&lt;ref name="Trivers1972" /&gt; This theory has been influential in explaining sex differences in [[sexual selection]] and [[mate preference|mate preferences]]. 

==Parental care==

Parental investment theory is a branch of [[life history theory]]. The earliest consideration of parental investment is given by [[Ronald Fisher]] in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.genetics.org/content/154/4/1419|title=The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection|first=A. W. F.|last=Edwards|date=1 April 2000|publisher=|volume=154|issue=4|pages=1419–1426|via=www.genetics.org|pmid=10747041|pmc=1461012}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein Fisher argued that parental expenditure on both sexes of offspring should be equal. Clutton-Brock expanded the concept of parental investment to include costs to any other component of parental fitness.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

Male [[dunnock]]s tend to not discriminate between their own young and those of another male in [[polyandrous]] or [[polygynandrous]] systems. They increase their own [[reproductive success]] through feeding the offspring in relation to their own access to the female throughout the mating period, which is generally a good predictor of [[parent|paternity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burke|first=T.|author2=Daviest, N. B.|author3=Bruford, M. W.|author4=Hatchwell, B. J.|year=1989|title=Parental care and mating behaviour of polyandrous dunnocks ''Prunella modularis'' related to paternity by DNA fingerprinting|journal=Nature|volume=338|issue=6212|pages=249–51|bibcode=1989Natur.338..249B|doi=10.1038/338249a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This indiscriminative parental care by males is also observed in [[Ophioblennius atlanticus|redlip blennies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Santos|first=R. S.|year=1995|title=Allopaternal care in redlip blenny|journal=Journal of Fish Biology|volume=47|issue=2|pages=350–353|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.1995.tb01904.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pholcid and spiderlings.jpg|thumb|A [[Pholcidae|cellar spider]] defending spiderlings.]]In some insects, male parental investment is given in the form of a nuptial gift. For instance, [[Utetheisa ornatrix|ornate moth]] females receive a spermatophore containing nutrients, sperm and defensive toxins from the male during copulation. This gift, which can account for up to 10% of the male's body mass, constitutes the total parental investment the male provides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=Caitlin A.|last2=Norbutus|first2=Amanda J.|last3=Lagalante|first3=Anthony F.|last4=Iyengar|first4=Vikram K.|year=2012|title=Male courtship pheromones as indicators of genetic quality in an arctiid moth (''Utetheisa ornatrix'')|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=23|issue=5|pages=1009–14|doi=10.1093/beheco/ars064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some species, such as humans and many birds, the offspring are [[Altriciality|altricial]] and unable to fend for themselves for an extended period of time after birth. In these species, males invest more in their offspring than do the male parents of [[Precociality|precocial]] species, since reproductive success would otherwise suffer.

The benefits of parental investment to the offspring are large and are associated with the effects on condition, growth, survival, and ultimately on reproductive success of the offspring. For example, in the cichlid fish ''[[Tropheus moorii#Buccal feeding|Tropheus moorii]]'', a female has very high parental investment in her young because she [[mouthbrood]]s the young and while mouthbrooding, all nourishment she takes in goes to feed the young and she effectively starves herself. In doing this, her young are larger, heavier, and faster than they would have been without it. These benefits are very advantageous since it lowers their risk of being eaten by predators and size is usually the determining factor in conflicts over resources.&lt;ref name="Schürch&amp;Taborsky"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schürch, Roger|last-author-amp=yes|title=The Functional Significance of Buccal Feeding in the Mouthbrooding Cichlid ''Tropheus moorii''|journal=Behaviour|year=2005|volume=142|issue=3|pages=265–281|jstor=4536244|doi=10.1163/1568539053778274|first1=Roger|last2=Taborsky|first2=Barbara}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such benefits can come at the cost of parent's ability to reproduce in the future e.g., through increased risk of injury when defending offspring against predators, loss of mating opportunities whilst rearing offspring, and an increase in the time interval until the next reproduction.

A special case of parental investment is when young do need nourishment and protection, but the genetic parents do not actually contribute in the effort to raise their own offspring. For example, in ''[[Bombus terrestris]]'', oftentimes sterile female workers will not reproduce on their own, but will raise their mother's brood instead. This is common in social [[Hymenopteran|Hymenoptera]] due to [[haplodiploidy]], whereby males are haploid and females are diploid. This ensures that sisters are more related to each other than they ever would be to their own offspring, incentivizing them to help raise their mother's young over their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Davies, Nicholas B.| author2= John R. Krebs| author3= Stuart A. West| last-author-amp= yes |year = 2012| title = An Introduction to Behavioral Ecology| publisher = Wiley-Blackwell|pages=367–371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, parents are selected to maximize the difference between the benefits and the costs, and parental care will be likely to evolve when the benefits exceed the costs.

== Parent-offspring conflict ==
Reproduction is costly. Individuals are limited in the degree to which they can devote time and resources to producing and raising their young, and such expenditure may also be detrimental to their future condition, survival, and further reproductive output.
However, such expenditure is typically beneficial to the offspring, enhancing their condition, survival, and reproductive success. These differences may lead to [[parent–offspring conflict|parent-offspring conflict]]. Parents are naturally selected to maximize the difference between the benefits and the costs, and parental care will tend to exist when the benefits are substantially greater than the costs.

Parents are equally related to all offspring, and so in order to optimize their fitness and chance of reproducing their genes, they should distribute their investment equally among current and future offspring. However, any single offspring is more related to themselves (they have 100% of their DNA in common with themselves) than they are to their siblings (siblings usually share 50% of their DNA), it is best for the offspring's fitness if the parent(s) invest more in them. To optimize fitness, a parent would want to invest in each offspring equally, but each offspring would want a larger share of parental investment. The parent is selected to invest in the offspring up until the point at which investing in the current offspring is costlier than investing in future offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Barett, L., Dunbar, R. &amp; Lycett, J. (2002). Human Evolutionary Psychology. Palgrave Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Semelparity and iteroparity|iteroparous]] species, where individuals may go through several reproductive bouts during their lifetime, a tradeoff may exist between investment in current offspring and future reproduction. Parents need to balance their offspring's demands against their own self-maintenance. This potential negative effect of parental care was explicitly formalized by Trivers in 1972, who originally defined the term ''parental investment'' to mean ''any investment by the parent in an individual offspring that increases the offspring's chance of surviving (and hence [[reproductive success]]) at the cost of the parent's ability to invest in other offspring''.&lt;ref name="Trivers1972" /&gt;
[[File:King penguin and a chick.JPG|left|thumb|King penguin and a chick]]
Penguins are a prime example of a species that drastically sacrifices their own health and well-being in exchange for the survival of their offspring. This behavior, one that does not necessarily benefit the individual, but the genetic code from which the individual arises, can be seen in the King Penguin. Although some animals do exhibit altruistic behaviors towards individuals that are not of direct relation, many of these behaviors appear mostly in parent-offspring relationships. While breeding, males remain in a fasting-period at the breeding site for five weeks, waiting for the female to return for her own incubation shift. However, during this time period, males may decide to abandon their egg if the female is delayed in her return to the breeding grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olsson|first1=Olof|title=Clutch abandonment: a state-dependent decision in king penguins|journal=Journal of Avian Biology|volume=28|pages=264–267|doi=10.2307/3676979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It shows that these penguins initially show a trade-off of their own health, in hopes of increasing the survivorship of their egg. But there comes a point where the male penguin's costs become too high in comparison to the gain of a successful breeding season. Olof Olsson investigated the correlation between how many experiences in breeding an individual has and the duration an individual will wait until abandoning his egg. He proposed that the more experienced the individual, the better that individual will be at replenishing his exhausted body reserves, allowing him to remain at the egg for a longer period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olsson|first1=Olof|title=Clutch abandonment: a state-dependent decision in king penguins|journal=Journal of Avian Biology|volume=28|pages=264–267|doi=10.2307/3676979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The males' sacrifice of their body weight and possible survivorship, in order to increase their offspring's chance of survival is a trade-off between current reproductive success and the parents' future survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olsson|first1=Olof|title=Clutch abandonment: a state-dependent decision in king penguins|journal=Journal of Avian Biology|volume=28|pages=264–267|doi=10.2307/3676979}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trade-off makes sense with other examples of kin-based altruism and is a clear example of the use of altruism in an attempt to increase overall fitness of an individual's genetic material at the expense of the individual's future survival.

=== Maternal-offspring conflict ===
The maternal-offspring conflict has also been studied in animals species and humans. One such case has been documented in the mid-1970s by ethologist [[Wulf Schiefenhövel]]. Eipo women of West New Guinea engage in a cultural practice in which they give birth just outside of the village. Following the birth of their child, each woman weighed whether or not she should keep the child or leave the child in the brush nearby, leaving it to die &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Family Relationships: An Evolutionary Perspective|last1=Salmon|first1=Catherine A.|last2=Shackelford|first2=Todd K.|date=September 2007|publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online|isbn=9780195320510}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmon2007" /&gt;
. Likelihood of survival and availability of resources within the village were factors that played into the decision of keeping the child. During one illustrated birth, the mother felt the child was too ill and would not survive, so she wrapped the child up, preparing to leave the child in the brush; however, after seeing the child moving, the mother unwrapped the child and brought it into the village, demonstrating the shift from a state of not able to be a villager to a state of being welcomed into the community &lt;ref name="Salmon2007" /&gt;
. This conflict between the mother and the child resulted in detachment behaviors in Brazil, seen in Scheper-Hughes work as "many Alto abies remain[ed] not only unchristened but unnamed until they begin to walk or talk" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Scheper-Hughes|first1=Nancy|date=December 1985|title=Culture, Scarcity, and Maternal Thinking: Maternal Detachment and Infant Survival in a Brazilian Shantytown|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/eth.1985.13.4.02a00010|journal=Ethos|language=en|volume=13|issue=4|pages=291–317|doi=10.1525/eth.1985.13.4.02a00010|issn=0091-2131}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or if a medical crisis arose and the baby needed an emergency [[baptism]]. This conflict between survival, both emotional and physical, prompted a shift in cultural practices, thus resulting in new forms of investment from the mother towards the child.

==Offspring and situation direction==
Parental investment behavior enhances the chances of survival of offspring, and it does not require underlying mechanisms to be compatible with empathy applicable to adults, or situations involving unrelated offspring, and it does not require the offspring to reciprocate the altruistic behavior in any way.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, C. L. (1894). ''An introduction to comparative psychology''. London: W. Scott.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, R. (1984). The principle of parsimony and some applications in psychology. ''Journal of Mind and Behavior, 5''&lt;/ref&gt; Parentally investing individuals are not more vulnerable to being exploited by other adults.

==Trivers' parental investment theory==
Parental investment as defined by Trivers in 1972&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Trivers, R. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. Sexual Selection &amp;  the Descent of Man, Aldine de Gruyter, New York, 136-179.&lt;/ref&gt; is the investment in offspring by the parent that increases the offspring's chances of surviving and hence [[reproductive success]] at the expense of the parent's ability to invest in other offspring. A large parental investment largely decreases the parents' chances of investing in other offspring. Parental investment can be split into two main categories: mating investment and rearing investment. 
Mating investment consist of the sexual act and the sex cells invested. The rearing investment is the time and energy expended to raise the offspring after conception. 
Women's parental investment in both mating and rearing efforts greatly surpasses that of the male. In terms of sex cells (egg and sperms cells), the female's investment is a lot larger, while males produce thousands of [[sperm cells]] which are supplied at a rate of twelve million per hour.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Buss, D. M., Larsen, R. J., Westen, D., &amp; Semmelroth, J. (1992). Sex differences in jealousy:  Evolution, physiology, and psychology. Psychological science, 3(4), 251-255.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Women have a fixed supply of around 400 [[Egg cell|ova]]. Also, the acts of [[fertilization]] and [[gestation]] occur in the women, which compared to the male's investment of just one cell outweighs it. Furthermore, each intercourse could result in a nine-month commitment such as gestation (the act of [[breastfeeding]]) for the woman. From Trivers' theory of parental investment several implications follow. The first is that women are often but not always the more investing sex. The fact that they are the more investing sex has meant that evolution has favored females who are more selective of their mates to ensure that intercourse would not result in unnecessary costs. The third implication is that because women invest more and are essential for the reproductive success of their offspring they are a valuable resource for men; as a result, males often compete for sexual access to them.

===Females as the more investing sex===

Due to the heavy investment that women engage in after conception, [[evolution]] has favored women who are more selective of their partners. Therefore, generally speaking, women are more discriminating about their partners. Their mate preferences usually include males which are of good financial status, and could therefore invest more resources; who are more committed, and would therefore dedicate more time and energy; who are more athletic, as they would be better at protecting and defending the female and her offspring; and who are healthier, again with the prospect in mind that they would ensure healthy offspring.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, M. D. (1999). Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the mind. (2nd ed.). United States: Pearson Education, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's preferences for mates, however, vary depending on their context. There are two contexts which have been identified to affect preferences. The first is women's personal resources, also referred to as the "structural powerlessness hypothesis".&lt;ref&gt;David, M. B., &amp; Barnes, M. (1986). Preferences in Human Mate Selection. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 3, 559-570&lt;/ref&gt; According to this hypothesis women strive to find mates which have access to resources mainly because they themselves are excluded from them and they are usually largely controlled by men. Therefore, women see finding a mate with a lot of resources as a channel to gain access to these resources. However, this hypothesis has been disproved by studies such as the one done by Buss &lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. M. (1989). Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses testing in 37 cultures. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 12, 1-49&lt;/ref&gt; which found that successful women place even greater importance on financial and societal status as well as on professional degrees. Another way to look at female choosing male based on their resource is in the nonhuman kingdom.  A great example of this is in polygynous mating, where males will compete with other males for territories with rich resources. When one male is able to take control of a spot then he will be able to drawn in females and mate with them based on the fact that they are in control of the territory. &lt;ref&gt; Kerr, S. (2018). Biology 1520: Animal Reproductive Strategies. Georgia Tech Biological Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another context which is known to alter female’s preferences for mates is temporal boundaries. Studies by Buss and Schmitt &lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. M., &amp; Schmitt, D. P. (1993). [https://www.academia.edu/download/1616706/sexual_strategies_theory_1993.pdf Sexual strategies theory: An evolutionary perspective on human mating]. Psychological Review, 100, 204-232.&lt;/ref&gt; have found that women put great emphasis on career-orientation, ambition and devotion only when considering a long-term partner. When marriage is not involved often females would put greater emphasis on looks.&lt;ref&gt;Scheib, J. E. (1997, June). Context-specific mate choice criteria: Women’s trade-offs in the contexts of long-term and extra-pair mateships. Paper presented to the Annual Meeting of the Human Behavior and Evolution Society, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.&lt;/ref&gt; This could be explained through parental investment theory because when women expect to have offspring from a particular mate they employ a more demanding criteria as they know it will affect the reproductive success of their offspring, however when looking at short-term mating which would not involve long-term commitments, females are less selective. Of course, this alternation is only possible for humans with birth control technology which was not available in the past.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, M. D. (1999). Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of the mind. (2nd ed.). United States: Pearson Education, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Males as the more investing sex===
For many species the only type of male investment received is that of sex cells. In those terms, the female investment greatly exceeds that of male investment as previously mentioned. However, there are other ways in which males invest in their offspring.  For example, the male can find food as in the example of balloon flies.&lt;ref&gt;Kessel, E. L. (1955). The mating activities of balloon flies. Systematic Zoology, 4, 97-104.&lt;/ref&gt; He may find a safe environment for the female to feed or lay her eggs as exemplified in many birds.&lt;ref&gt;Royama, T. (1966). A re-interpretation of courtship feeding. Bird Study, 13(2), 116-129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, A. W., &amp; Williams, H. W. (1971). Courtship feeding in gallinaceous birds. The Auk, 543-559.Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; 

He may also protect the young and provide them with opportunities to learn as in many young as in wolves. Overall, the main role that males overtake is that of protection of the female and their young. That often can decrease the discrepancy of investment caused by the initial investment of sex cells. There are some species such as the Mormon cricket, pipefish seahorse and Panamanian poison arrow frog males invest more. Among the species where the male invests more, the male is also the pickier sex, placing higher demands on their selected female. For example, the female that they often choose usually contain 60% more eggs than rejected females.&lt;ref&gt;Trivers, R. (1985). Social evolution. Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This links Parental Investment Theory (PIT) with [[sexual selection]]: where  parental investment is bigger for a male than a female, it's usually the female who competes for a mate, as shown by Phalaropidae and polyandrous bird species. In these species females are usually more aggressive, brightly colored, and larger than males,&lt;ref&gt;Lack, D. L. (1968). Ecological adaptations for breeding in birds.&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting the more investing sex has more choice while selecting a mate compared to the sex engaged in intra-sexual selection.

===Females as a valuable resource for males===
The second prediction that follows from Trivers' theory is that the fact that women invest more heavily in offspring makes them a valuable resource for males as it ensures the survival of their offspring which is the driving force of [[natural selection]]. Therefore, the sex that invests less in offspring will compete among themselves to breed with the more heavily investing sex. In other words, males will compete for females. 
It has been argued that [[jealousy]] has developed to avert the risk of potential loss of parental investment in offspring.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; 

If a male redirects his resources to another female it is a costly loss of time, energy and resources for her offspring. However, the risks for males are higher because although women invest more in their offspring, they have bigger maternity certainty because they themselves have carried out the child. However, males can never have 100% paternal certainty and therefore risk investing resources and time in offspring that is genetically unrelated. [[Evolutionary psychology]] views jealousy as an [[adaptive]] response to this problem.

===Application of Trivers' theory in real life===

Trivers' theory has been very influential as the predictions it makes correspond to differences in sexual behaviors of men and women, as demonstrated by a variety of research. [[Cross-cultural]] study from [[David Buss|Buss]] (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. M. (1989). Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses  tested in 37 cultures. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 12(01), 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt; shows that males are tuned into physical attractiveness as it signals youth and fertility and ensures male reproductive success, which is increased by copulating with as many fertile females as possible. Women on the other hand are tuned into resources provided by potential mates, as their reproductive success is increased by ensuring their offspring will survive, and one way they do so is by getting resources for them. Alternatively, another study shows that men are more promiscuous than women, giving further support to this theory. Clark and Hatfield&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R. D., &amp; Hatfield, E. (1989). Gender differences in receptivity to sexual offers.  Journal of Psychology &amp; Human Sexuality, 2(1), 39-55.&lt;/ref&gt; found that 75% of men were willing to have sex with a female stranger when propositioned, compared to 0% of women. On the other hand, 50% of women agreed to a date with a male stranger. This suggests males seek short term relationships, while women show a strong preference for long-term relationships.

However, these preferences (male promiscuity and female choosiness) can be explained in other ways. In Western cultures, male promiscuity is encouraged through the availability of pornographic magazines and videos targeted to the male audience. Alternatively, both Western and Eastern cultures discourage female promiscuity through social checks such as [[slut-shaming]].&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, E. A., Hamilton, L. T., Armstrong, E. M., &amp; Seeley, J. L. (2014). “Good Girls” Gender, Social Class, and Slut Discourse on Campus. Social Psychology Quarterly, 77(2), 100-122&lt;/ref&gt;

PIT (Parental Investment Theory) also explains patterns of [[sexual jealousy]].&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt; He found males are more likely to show a stress response when imagining their partners showing sexual infidelity (having sexual relations with someone else), and women showed more stress when imagining their partner being emotionally unfaithful (being in love with another woman). PIT explains this, as woman's sexual infidelity decreases the male's paternal certainty, thus he will show more stress due to fear of [[cuckoldry]]. On the other hand, the woman fears losing the resources her partner provides. If her partner has an emotional attachment to another female it's likely that he won't invest into their offspring as much, thus a greater stress response is shown in this circumstance.

A heavy criticism of the theory comes from Thornhill and Palmer's analysis of it in ''[[A Natural History of Rape: Biological Bases of Sexual Coercion]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Thornhill, R., &amp; Palmer, C. T. (2001). A natural history of rape: Biological bases of sexual  coercion. MIT press.&lt;/ref&gt; as it seems to rationalise rape and [[sexual coercion]] of females. Thornhill and Palmer claimed rape is an evolved technique for obtaining mates in an environment where women choose mates. As PIT claims males seek to copulate with as many fertile females as possible, the choice women have could result in a negative effect on the male's reproductive success. If women didn't choose their mates, Thornhill and Palmer claim there would be no rape. This ignores a variety of sociocultural factors, such as the fact that not only fertile females are raped – 34% of underage rape victims are under 12,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rainn.org/statistics/children-and-teens|title=Children and Teens: Statistics - RAINN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means they are not of fertile age, thus there is no evolutionary advantage in raping them. 14% of rapes in England are committed on males,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapecrisis.org.uk/statistics.php|title=Rape statistics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who cannot increase a man's reproductive success as there will be no conception. Thus, what Thornhill and Palmer called an 'evolved machinery' might not be very advantageous.

===Versus sexual strategies===

Trivers' theory overlooks that women do have short-term relationships such as one-night stands, while not all men behave promiscuously. An alternative explanation to PIT (Parental Investment Theory) and mate preferences would be Buss and Schmitt's sexual strategies theory.&lt;ref name="Buss, D. M. 1993"&gt;Buss, D. M., &amp; Schmitt, D. P. (1993). Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary  perspective on human mating. Psychological Review, 100(2), 204.&lt;/ref&gt; SST argues that both sexes pursue short-term and long-term relationships, but seek different qualities in their short- and long-term partners. For a short-term relationship women will prefer an attractive partner, but in a long-term relationship they might be willing to trade-off that attractiveness for resources and commitment. On the other hand, men might be accepting of a sexually willing partner in a short-term relationships, but to ensure their paternal certainty they will seek a faithful partner instead.

===International politics===
Parental investment is not only used to explain evolutionary phenomena and human behavior but describes recurrences in international politics as well. Specifically, parental investment is referred to when describing competitive behaviors between states and determining aggressive nature of foreign policies. The parental investment hypothesis states that the size of coalitions and the physical strengths of its male members determines whether its activities with its foreign neighbors are aggressive or amiable.&lt;ref name="Lopez,McDermott,Petersen2011"&gt;Lopez,McDermott,Petersen.2011. "States in Mind: Evolution, Coalitional Psychology, and International Politics". International Security pg. 77-80&lt;/ref&gt; 
According to Triver, men have had relatively low parental investments, and were therefore forced into fiercer competitive situations over limited reproductive resources. [[Sexual selection]] naturally took place and men have evolved to address its unique reproductive problems. Among other adaptations, men's psychology has also developed to directly aid men in such intra-sexual competition.&lt;ref name="Lopez,McDermott,Petersen2011" /&gt;
 
One essential psychological developments involved decision-making of whether to take flight or actively engage in warfare with another rivalry group. The two main factors that men referred to in such situations were (1) whether the coalition they are a part of is larger than its opposition and (2) whether the men in their coalition have greater physical strength than the other. The male psychology conveyed in the ancient past has been passed on to modern times causing men to partly think and behave as they have during ancestral wars. According to this theory, leaders of international politics were not an exception. For example, the United States expected to win the [[Vietnam war]] due to its greater military capacity when compared to its enemies. Yet victory, according to the traditional rule of greater coalition size, did not come about because the U.S. did not take enough consideration to other factors, such as the perseverance of the local population.&lt;ref name="Lopez,McDermott,Petersen2011" /&gt;

The parental investment hypothesis contends that male physical strength of a coalition still determines the aggressiveness of modern conflicts between states. While this idea may seem unreasonable upon considering that male physical strength is one of the least determining aspects of today's warfare, human psychology has nevertheless evolved to operate on this basis. Moreover, although it may seem that mate seeking motivation is no longer a determinant, in modern wars sexuality, such as rape, is undeniably evident in conflicts even to this day.&lt;ref name="Lopez,McDermott,Petersen2011" /&gt;

==Sexual selection==
{{Main|Sexual selection}}
In many species, males can produce a larger number of offspring over the course of their lives by minimizing parental investment in favor of investing time impregnating any reproductive-age female who is fertile. In contrast, a female can have a much smaller number of offspring during her reproductive life, partly due to higher obligate parental investment. Females will be more selective ("choosy") of mates than males will be, choosing males with good fitness (e.g., genes, high status, resources, etc.), so as to help offset any lack of direct parental investment from the male, and therefore increase reproductive success. [[Robert Trivers]]' theory of parental investment predicts that the [[sex]] making the largest investment in [[lactation]], nurturing, and protecting offspring will be more discriminating in [[mating]]; and that the sex that invests less in offspring will compete via [[intrasexual selection]] for access to the higher-investing sex (see [[Bateman's principle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bateman AJ|date=December 1948|title=Intra-sexual selection in Drosophila|journal=Heredity|volume=2|issue=3|pages=349–68|doi=10.1038/hdy.1948.21|pmid=18103134}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In species where both sexes invest highly in parental care, mutual choosiness is expected to arise. An example of this is seen in [[crested auklet]]s, where parents share equal responsibility in incubating their single egg and raising the chick. In crested auklets both sexes are ornamented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amundsen|first=Trond|date=1 April 2000|title=Why are female birds ornamented|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=15|issue=4|pages=149–55|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(99)01800-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parental investment in humans ==
Humans have evolved increasing levels of parental investment, both biologically and behaviorally. The fetus requires high investment from the mother, and the altricial newborn requires high investment from a community.

=== Maternal Investment ===
Trivers (1972)&lt;ref name="Trivers1972" /&gt; hypothesized that greater biologically obligated investment will predict greater voluntary investment. Mothers invest an impressive amount in their children before they are even born. The time and nutrients required to develop the fetus, and the risks associated with both giving these nutrients and undergoing childbirth, are a sizable investment. To ensure that this investment is not for nothing, mothers are likely to invest in their children after they are born, to be sure that they survive and are successful.

The other placental phenotypes are separated from the maternal bloodstream by at least one layer of tissue. The more invasive placenta allows for a more efficient transfer of nutrients between the mother and fetus, but it comes with risks as well. The fetus is able to release hormones directly into the mother’s bloodstream to “demand” increased resources. This can result in health problems for the mother, such as [[pre-eclampsia]]. During childbirth, the detachment of the placental chorion can cause excessive bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahmoud F.

Relative to most other species, human mothers give more resources to their offspring at a higher risk to their own health, even before the child is born. This is associated with the evolution of a slower life history, in which fewer, larger offspring are born after longer intervals, requiring increased parental investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garratt|first=M.|last2=Gaillard|first2=J.-M.|last3=Brooks|first3=R.

==== Obstetrical dilemma ====
{{Main|Obstetrical dilemma}}{{See also|Altriciality}}Humans have evolved both bipedalism and large brain size. The evolution of bipedalism altered the shape of the pelvis, and shrunk the birth canal at the same time brains were evolving to be larger. The decreasing birth canal size meant that babies were born earlier in development, when they have smaller brains. Humans give birth to babies with brains 25% developed, while other primates give birth to offspring with brains 45-50% developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/669122326|title=Human birth : an evolutionary perspective|last=Wenda.|first=Trevathan,|date=2011|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=9781412815024|location=New Brunswick|oclc=669122326}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second possible explanation for the early birth in humans is the energy required to grow and sustain a larger brain. Supporting a larger brain gestationally requires energy the mother may be unable to invest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wells|first=Jonathan C.K.|last2=DeSilva|first2=Jeremy M.|last3=Stock|first3=Jay T.|date=2012|title=The obstetric dilemma: An ancient game of Russian roulette, or a variable dilemma sensitive to ecology?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ajpa.22160|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=149|issue=S55|pages=40–71|doi=10.1002/ajpa.22160|issn=0002-9483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species whose newborn young are unable to move on their own and require parental care have a high degree of [[altriciality]]. Human children are born unable to care for themselves and require additional parental investment post-birth in order to survive.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=Karen|last2=Trevathan|first2=Wenda|date=2002-11|title=Birth, obstetrics and human evolution|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1471-0528.2002.00010.x|journal=BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|volume=109|issue=11|pages=1199–1206|doi=10.1046/j.1471-0528.2002.00010.x|issn=1470-0328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birth attendance and sociality====
{{See also|Birth attendant|Sociality|Evolution of eusociality}}
The obstetrical dilemma makes birth challenging, and a distinguishing trait of humans is the need for assistance during childbirth. The altered shape of the bipedal pelvis requires that babies leave the birth canal facing away from the mother, contrary to all other primate species. This makes it more difficult for the mother to clear the baby’s breathing passageways, to make sure the umbilical cord isn’t wrapped around the neck, and to pull the baby free without bending its body the wrong way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trevathan|first=Wenda R.|date=June 1996|title=The Evolution of Bipedalism and Assisted Birth|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1525/maq.1996.10.2.02a00100|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|volume=10|issue=2|pages=287–290|doi=10.1525/maq.1996.10.2.02a00100|issn=0745-5194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human need to have a birth attendant also requires [[sociality]]. In order to guarantee the presence of a birth attendant, humans must aggregate in groups. It has been controversially claimed that humans have [[eusociality]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gintis|first=Herbert|date=2012-11|title=Clash of the Titans|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/62/11/987/263161|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=62|issue=11|pages=987–991|doi=10.1525/bio.2012.62.11.8|issn=1525-3244}}&lt;/ref&gt; like ants and bees, in which there is relatively high parental investment, cooperative care of young, and division of labor.

[[File:Baby Mother Grandmother and Great Grandmother.jpg|thumb|A baby, mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother. In humans, grandparents often help to raise a child.]]

==== Grandmother hypothesis ====
{{Main|Grandmother hypothesis}}
As female primates age, their ability to reproduce decreases. The grandmother hypothesis describes the evolution of menopause, which may or may not be unique to humans among primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Margaret L.|last2=Herndon|first2=James G.|date=2008-09-01|title=Menopause in Nonhuman Primates?1|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod.108.068536|journal=Biology of Reproduction|volume=79|issue=3|pages=398–406|doi=10.1095/biolreprod.108.068536|issn=0006-3363}}&lt;/ref&gt; As women age, the costs of investing in additional reproduction increase and the benefits decrease. At menopause, it is more beneficial to stop reproduction and begin investing in grandchildren. Grandmothers are certain of their genetic relation to their grandchildren, especially the children of their daughters, because maternal certainty of their own children is high, and their daughters are certain of their maternity to their children as well. It has also been theorized that grandmothers preferentially invest in the daughters of their daughters because X chromosomes carry more DNA and their granddaughters are most closely related to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Molly|last2=Johow|first2=Johannes|last3=Knapp|first3=Leslie A.|date=2011|title=The Selfish Grandma Gene: The Roles of the X-Chromosome and Paternity Uncertainty in the Evolution of Grandmothering Behavior and Longevity|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4061/2011/165919|journal=International Journal of Evolutionary Biology|volume=2011|pages=1–9|doi=10.4061/2011/165919|issn=2090-052X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Paternal investment ===
{{See also|Paternal care}}
As altriciality increased, investment from individuals other than the mother became more necessary. High sociality meant that female relatives were present to help the mother, but paternal investment increased as well. Paternal investment increases as it becomes more difficult to have additional children, and as the effects of investment on offspring fitness increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tattersall|first=Ian|date=2010-08-10|title=Paleoanthropology: Two New Offerings|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12052-010-0263-8|journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach|volume=3|issue=3|pages=464–465|doi=10.1007/s12052-010-0263-8|issn=1936-6426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The effect of father absence====
{{Main|Father absence}}
Men are more likely than women to give no parental investment to their children, and the children of low-investing fathers are more likely to give less parental investment to their own children.

=== Investment as predictor of mating strategies ===
[[File:Pregnancy chance by day near ovulation.jpg|left|thumb|Chance of [[Human fertilization|fertilization]] by [[menstrual cycle]] day relative to [[ovulation]], with data from two different studies.]]

==== Concealed ovulation ====
{{Main|Concealed ovulation}}
Women can only get pregnant while ovulating. Human ovulation is concealed, or not signaled externally. Concealed ovulation decreases paternity certainty because men are unsure when women ovulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sillen-Tullberg|first=Birgitta|last2=Moller|first2=Anders P.|date=1993-01|title=The Relationship between Concealed Ovulation and Mating Systems in Anthropoid Primates: A Phylogenetic Analysis|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/285458|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=141|issue=1|pages=1–25|doi=10.1086/285458|issn=0003-0147}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution of concealed ovulation has been theorized to be a result of altriciality and increased need for paternal investment. There are two ways this could be true. First, if men are unsure of the time of ovulation, the best way to successfully reproduce would be to repeatedly mate with a woman throughout her cycle, which requires pair bonding, which in turn increases paternal investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=BENSHOOF|first=L|last2=THORNHILL|first2=R|date=1979-04|title=The evolution of monogamy and concealed ovulation in humans|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0140-1750(79)90001-0|journal=Journal of Social and Biological Systems|volume=2|issue=2|pages=95–106|doi=10.1016/0140-1750(79)90001-0|issn=0140-1750}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second theory states that decreased paternity certainty would increase paternal investment in polygamous groups, because more men may invest in the offspring. The second theory is better regarded today, because all mammals with concealed ovulation are promiscuous, and men display relatively low mate-guarding behavior, as monogamy and the first theory require.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/793342018|title=Sex at dawn : how we mate, why we stray, and what it means for modern relationships|last=1962-|first=Ryan, Christopher,|date=[2012]|publisher=Harper|others=Jethá, Cacilda.|isbn=9780062207944|location=New York|oclc=793342018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Mating orientations ====
{{See also|Human mating strategies}}
[[Sociosexual orientation|Sociosexuality]] was first described by [[Alfred Kinsey]] as a willingness to engage in casual and uncommitted sexual relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinsey|first=Alfred C.|last2=Pomeroy|first2=Wardell R.|last3=Martin|first3=Clyde E.|date=June 2003|title=Sexual Behavior in the Human Male|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2105/ajph.93.6.894|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=93|issue=6|pages=894–898|doi=10.2105/ajph.93.6.894|issn=0090-0036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociosexual orientation describes sociosexuality on a scale from unrestricted to restricted.

Parental investment theory, as proposed by Trivers, argues that the sex with higher obligatory investment will be more selective in choosing sex partners, and the sex with lower obligatory investment will be less selective and more interested in "casual" mating opportunities. The more investing sex cannot reproduce as frequently, causing the less investing sex to compete for mating opportunities.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wade, M. J., &amp; Shuster, S. M. (2002).

==== Sexual dimorphism ====
{{See also|Sexual dimorphism in humans}}
Sexual dimorphism is the difference in body size between male and female members of a species as a result of intrasexual selection, which is [[sexual selection]] that acts within a sex. High sexual dimorphism and larger body size in males is a result of male-male competition for females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lande|first=Russell|date=1980-03|title=Sexual Dimorphism, Sexual Selection, and Adaptation in Polygenic Characters|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2407393|journal=Evolution|volume=34|issue=2|pages=292|doi=10.2307/2407393|issn=0014-3820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primate species in which groups are formed of many females and one male have higher sexual dimorphism than species that have both multiple females and males, or one female and one male.

=== The Demographic Transition ===
{{See also|Demographic transition}}
The [[demographic transition]] describes the modern decrease in both birth and death rates. From a Darwinian perspective, it does not make sense that families with more resources are having fewer children. One explanation for the demographic transition is the increased parental investment required to raise children who will be able to maintain the same level of resources as their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borgerhoff Mulder|first=Monique|date=1998-07|title=The demographic transition: are we any closer to an evolutionary explanation?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0169-5347(98)01357-3|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=13|issue=7|pages=266–270|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(98)01357-3|issn=0169-5347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephanus Johannes Paulus''' "'''Paul'''" '''Kruger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|uː|g|ər}}; {{IPA-nl|ˈkryɣər|lang}}; 10 October 1825 – 14 July 1904) was one of the dominant political and military figures in 19th-century [[South Africa]], and [[President of the South African Republic|President]] of the [[South African Republic]] (or Transvaal) from 1883 to 1900. Nicknamed ''Oom Paul'' ("Uncle Paul"), he came to international prominence as the face of the [[Boer]] cause—that of the Transvaal and its neighbour the [[Orange Free State]]—against Britain during the [[Second Boer War]] of 1899–1902. He has been called a personification of [[Afrikaner]]dom, and remains a controversial and divisive figure; admirers venerate him as a tragic folk hero, and critics view him as the obstinate guardian of an unjust cause.

Born near the eastern edge of the [[Cape Colony]], Kruger took part in the [[Great Trek]] as a child during the late 1830s. Kruger had almost no education apart from the Bible, and through his interpretation believed the [[Flat Earth|Earth was flat]]. A protégé of the [[Voortrekker]] leader [[Andries Pretorius]], he witnessed the signing of the [[Sand River Convention]] with Britain in 1852 and over the next decade played a prominent role in the forging of the South African Republic, leading its [[Boer Commando|commandos]] and resolving disputes between the rival Boer leaders and factions. In 1863 he was elected [[Commandant-General]], a post he held for a decade before he resigned soon after the election of President [[Thomas François Burgers]].

Kruger was appointed [[Vice State President of the South African Republic|Vice-President]] in March 1877, shortly before the South African Republic was annexed by Britain as the Transvaal. Over the next three years he headed two deputations to London to try to have this overturned and became the leading figure in the movement to restore the South African Republic's independence, culminating in the Boers' victory in the [[First Boer War]] of 1880–81. Kruger served until 1883 as a member of an executive [[triumvirate]], then was [[Transvaal presidential election, 1883|elected]] President. In 1884 he headed a third deputation that brokered the [[London Convention (1884)|London Convention]], under which Britain recognised the South African Republic as a fully independent state.

Following the influx of thousands of predominantly British settlers with the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] of 1886, "[[uitlander]]s" (out-landers) provided almost all of the South African Republic's tax revenues but lacked civic representation; Boer [[Burgher (Boer republics)|burghers]] retained control of the government. The uitlander problem and the associated tensions with Britain dominated Kruger's attention for the rest of his presidency, to which he was re-elected in [[Transvaal presidential election, 1888|1888]], [[Transvaal presidential election, 1893|1893]] and [[Transvaal presidential election, 1898|1898]], and led to the [[Jameson Raid]] of 1895–96 and ultimately the Second Boer War. Kruger left for Europe as the war turned against the Boers in 1900 and spent the rest of his life in exile, refusing to return home following the British victory. After he died in Switzerland at the age of 78 in 1904, his body was returned to South Africa for a state funeral, and buried in the [[Heroes' Acre (South Africa)|Heroes' Acre]] in [[Pretoria]].

==Early life==

===Family and childhood===
Stephanus Johannes Paulus Kruger was born on 10 October 1825 at Bulhoek, a farm in the [[Steynsburg]] area of the [[Cape Colony]], the third child and second son of Casper Jan Hendrik Kruger (1801-1852), a farmer, and his wife Elsje (Elisa; ''née'' Steyn)(1806-1834).{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 1–4}} The family was of Dutch-speaking [[Afrikaner]] or [[Boer]] background, of German, French [[Huguenot]] and Dutch stock.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=1–4}}{{sfn|Kruger|1902|p=3}} His paternal ancestors had been in South Africa since 1713, when Jacob Krüger, from [[Berlin]], arrived in [[Cape Town]] as a 17-year-old soldier in the [[Dutch East India Company]]'s service. Jacob's children dropped the [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] from the family name, a common practice among South Africans of German origin, and over the following generations Kruger's paternal forebears moved into the interior.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 1–4}} His mother's family, the Steyns, had lived in South Africa since 1668 and were relatively affluent and cultured by Cape standards.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=1–4}} Kruger's great-great-uncle Hermanus Steyn had been president of the self-declared Republic of [[Swellendam]] that revolted against Company rule in 1795.{{sfn|Meintjes|1969|p=2}}

Bulhoek, Kruger's birthplace, was the Steyn family farm and had been Elsie's home since early childhood; her father Douw Gerbrand Steyn had settled there in 1809. The Kruger and Steyn families were acquainted and Casper occasionally visited Bulhoek as a young man. He and Elsie married in [[Cradock, Eastern Cape|Cradock]] in 1820, when he was 19 and she was 14.{{#tag:ref|As Elsie was below [[marriageable age]], the union required written approval from both sets of parents and the bride herself. Such early marriages were not uncommon among rural Boers at that time.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p=3}}|group = "n"|name = "elsieage"}} A girl, Sophia, and a boy, Douw Gerbrand, were born before Paul's arrival in 1825.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=1–4}} The child's first two names, Stephanus Johannes, were chosen after his paternal grandfather, but rarely used—the provenance of the third name Paulus "was to remain rather a mystery", [[Johannes Meintjes]] wrote in his 1974 biography of Kruger, "and yet the boy was always called Paul."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=1–4}}

Paul Kruger was baptised at Cradock on 19 March 1826,{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 1–4}} and soon thereafter his parents acquired a farm of their own to the north-west at Vaalbank, near [[Colesberg]], in the remote north-east of the Cape Colony.{{sfn|Kruger|1902|pp=3–5}} His mother died when he was eight; Casper soon remarried and had more children with his second wife, Heiletje (''née'' du Plessis).{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=4–5}} Beyond reading and writing, which he learned from relatives, Kruger's only education was three months under a travelling tutor, Tielman Roos, and [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] religious instruction from his father.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 4–5}} In adulthood Kruger would claim to have never read any book apart from the Bible.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p = 76}}

===Great Trek===
[[File:Great Trek map full.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Map showing the routes taken by the [[Voortrekkers]] during the [[Great Trek]] of the 1830s and 1840s|alt=A map. See description]]
In 1835 Casper Kruger, his father and his brothers Gert and Theuns moved their families east and set up farms near the [[Caledon River]], on the Cape Colony's far north-eastern frontier. The Cape had been under British sovereignty since 1814, when the Netherlands ceded it to Britain with the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Convention of London]]. Boer discontent with aspects of British rule, such as the institution of English as the sole official language and the abolition of slavery in 1834, led to the [[Great Trek]]—a mass migration by Dutch-speaking "[[Voortrekkers]]" north-east from the Cape to the land over the [[Orange River|Orange]] and [[Vaal River]]s.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 3–5}} Many Boers had been voicing displeasure with the British Cape administration for some time, but the Krugers were comparatively content—they had always co-operated with the British, and had not owned slaves. They had given little thought to the idea of leaving the Cape.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 7}}

A group of emigrants under [[Hendrik Potgieter]] passed through the Krugers' Caledon encampments in early 1836. Potgieter envisioned a [[Boer republic]] with himself in a prominent role; he sufficiently impressed the Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 7–8}} Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey classrooms were improvised from reeds and grass and the more educated emigrants took turns in teaching.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 10}}

[[File:G.S. Smithard; J.S. Skelton (1909) - The Voortrekkers.jpg|thumb|left|[[Voortrekkers]]; a 1909 depiction|alt=A romantic depiction of settlers in covered wagons, driving lifestock]]
The Voortrekkers faced competition for the area they were entering from [[Mzilikazi]] and his [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] (or Matabele) people, a recent offshoot from the [[Zulu Kingdom]] to the south-east. On 16 October 1836 the 11-year-old Kruger took part in the [[Battle of Vegkop]], where Potgieter's [[laager]], a circle of wagons chained together, was unsuccessfully attacked by Mzilikazi and around 4,000–6,000 Matabele warriors.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 74–75}}{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 10–11}} Kruger and the other small children assisted in tasks such as [[cast bullet|bullet-casting]] while the women and larger boys helped the fighting men, of whom there were about 40. Kruger could recall the battle in great detail and give a vivid account well into old age.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 10–11}}

During 1837 and 1838 Kruger's family was part of the Voortrekker group under Potgieter that trekked further east into Natal. Here they met the American missionary [[Daniel Lindley]], who gave young Paul much spiritual invigoration.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 14}} The Zulu King [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona|Dingane]] concluded a land treaty with Potgieter, but then promptly reconsidered and massacred first [[Piet Retief]]'s party of settlers, then [[Weenen massacre|others at Weenen]].{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 74–75}} Kruger would recount his family's group coming under attack from Zulus soon after the Retief massacre, describing "children pinioned to their mothers' breasts by spears, or with their brains dashed out on waggon wheels"—but "God heard our prayer", he recalled, and "we followed them and shot them down as they fled, until more of them were dead than those of us they had killed in their attack&amp;nbsp;... I could shoot moderately well for we lived, so to speak, among the game."{{sfn|Davenport|2004}}

These developments impelled the Krugers' return to the highveld, where they took part in Potgieter's campaign that compelled Mzilikazi to move his people north, across the [[Limpopo River]], to what became [[Matabeleland]]. Kruger and his father thereupon settled at the foot of the [[Magaliesberg]] mountains in the Transvaal.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 74–75}} In Natal [[Andries Pretorius]] defeated more than 10,000 of Dingane's Zulus at the [[Battle of Blood River]] on 16 December 1838, a date subsequently marked by the Boers as ''Dingaansdag'' ("Dingane's Day") or the [[Day of the Vow]].{{#tag:ref|Outnumbered about twenty-to-one, Pretorius won at Blood River without losing a single man—he suffered only three lightly wounded—while the Zulus sustained around 3,000 fatalities.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp=171–172}} This was widely interpreted by the trekkers as a miraculous event demonstrating divine support for the Boers.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p=13}}|group = "n"|name = "bloodriver"}}

===Burgher===

Boer tradition of the time dictated that men were entitled to choose two {{convert|6000|acre|km2|adj=on}} farms—one for crops and one for grazing—upon becoming enfranchised [[Burgher (Boer republics)|burghers]] at the age of 16. Kruger set up his home at [[Waterkloof]], near [[Rustenburg]] in the Magaliesberg area.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 74–75}} This concluded, he wasted little time in pursuing the hand of Maria du Plessis, the daughter of a fellow Voortrekker south of the Vaal; she was only 14 years old when they married in [[Potchefstroom]] in 1842.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 17}} The same year Kruger was elected a deputy [[field cornet]]—"a singular honour at seventeen", Meintjes comments.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 21}} This role combined the civilian duties of a local magistrate with a military rank equivalent to that of a junior [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]].&lt;ref name="fieldcornet" /&gt;

Kruger was already an accomplished frontiersman, horseman and [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighter.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 74–75}} In addition to his native Dutch he could speak basic English and several African languages, some fluently.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 6, 31–32}} He had shot a lion for the first time when he was a boy—in old age he recalled being 14, but Meintjes suggests he may have been as young as 11.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 15}} During his many hunting excursions he was nearly killed on several occasions.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 74–75}} In 1845, while he was hunting rhinoceros along the [[Steelpoort River]], his four-pounder [[elephant gun]] exploded in his hands and blew off most of his left thumb.{{sfn|Kruger|1902|pp = 31–32}} Kruger wrapped the wound in a handkerchief and retreated to camp, where he treated it with [[turpentine]]. He refused calls to have the hand amputated by a doctor, and instead cut off the remains of the injured thumb himself with a pocketknife. When [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] marks appeared up to his shoulder, he placed the hand in the stomach of a freshly-killed goat, a traditional Boer remedy.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 19}} He considered this a success—"when it came to the turn of the second goat, my hand was already easier and the danger much less."{{sfn|Kruger|1902|pp = 33–34}} The wound took more than six months to heal, but he did not wait that long to start hunting again.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 19}}

[[File:Andries Pretorius portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Andries Pretorius]], a great influence on the young Kruger|alt=A man in a dark suit with a white hat. His left arm seems to be in a sling. In his right hand he grasps the barrel of a rifle.]]
Britain annexed the Voortrekkers' short-lived [[Natalia Republic]] in 1843 as the [[Colony of Natal]]. Pretorius briefly led Boer resistance to this, but before long most of the Boers in Natal had trekked back north-west to the area around the Orange and Vaal Rivers. In 1845 Kruger was a member of Potgieter's expedition to [[Maputo Bay|Delagoa Bay]] in [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] to negotiate a frontier with Portugal; the [[Lebombo Mountains]] were settled upon as the border between Boer and Portuguese lands.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 21–23}} After Maria and their first child died of fever in January 1846,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kruger|1902|pp=13–14}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2007|pp=74–75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Kruger married her cousin Gezina du Plessis, from the Colesberg area, in 1847. Their first child, Casper Jan Hendrik, was born on 22 December that year.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 22}}

Concerned by the exodus of so many whites from the Cape and Natal, and taking the view that they remained [[British subject]]s, the British Governor [[Sir Harry Smith, 1st Baronet|Sir Harry Smith]] in 1848 annexed the area between the Orange and Vaal rivers as the "[[Orange River Sovereignty]]". A [[Boer commando]] led by Pretorius against this was defeated by Smith at the [[Battle of Boomplaats]]. Pretorius also lived in the Magaliesberg mountains and often hosted the young Kruger, who greatly admired the elder man's resolve, sophistication and piety. A warm relationship developed.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 24–26}} "Kruger's political awareness can be dated from 1850", Meintjes writes, "and it was in no small measure given to him by Pretorius."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 26}} Like Pretorius, Kruger wanted to centralise the emigrants under a single authority and win British recognition for this as an independent state. This last point was not due to hostility to Britain—neither Pretorius nor Kruger was particularly anti-British—but because they perceived the emigrants' unity as under threat if the Cape administration continued to regard them as British subjects.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 26}}

The British [[Resident (title)|resident]] in the Orange River area, [[Henry Douglas Warden]], advised Smith in 1851 that he thought a compromise should be attempted with Pretorius. Smith sent representatives to meet him at the [[Sand River (Free State)|Sand River]]. Kruger, aged 26, accompanied Pretorius and on 17 January 1852 was present at the conclusion of the [[Sand River Convention]],{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 26–27}} under which Britain recognised "the Emigrant Farmers" in the Transvaal—the ''[[South African Republic|Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek]]'' ("South African Republic"), they called themselves—as independent. In exchange for the Boers' pledge not to introduce slavery in the Transvaal, the British agreed not to ally with any "coloured nations" there.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 6–7}} Kruger's uncle Gert was also present; his father Casper would have been as well had he not been ill.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 26–27}}

===Field cornet===
[[File:Kruger c1852.jpg|thumb|upright|Kruger as a [[field cornet]], photographed c.&amp;nbsp;1852|alt=A bearded man, apparently about 30 years old]]
The Boers and the local [[Tswana people|Tswana]] and [[Sotho people|Basotho]] chiefdoms were in near-constant conflict, mainly over land.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 6–7}} Kruger was elected field cornet of his district in 1852,&lt;ref name="fieldcornet"&gt;{{harvnb|Kruger|1902|p=37}}; {{harvnb|Meintjes|1974|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in August that year he took part in the [[Battle of Dimawe]], a raid against the Tswana chief [[Sechele I]]. The Boer commando was headed by Pretorius, but in practice he did not take much part as he was suffering from [[dropsy]]. Kruger narrowly escaped death twice—first a piece of shrapnel hit him in the head but only knocked him out, then later a Tswana bullet swiped across his chest, tearing his jacket without wounding him.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 30}} The commando wrecked [[David Livingstone]]'s mission station at [[Kolobeng Mission|Kolobeng]], destroying his medicines and books. Livingstone was away at the time.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p = 75}} Kruger's version of the story was that the Boers found an armoury and a workshop for repairing firearms in Livingstone's house and, interpreting this as a breach of Britain's promise at the Sand River not to arm tribal chiefs, confiscated them.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 30}} Whatever the truth, Livingstone wrote about the Boers in strongly condemnatory terms thereafter, depicting them as mindless barbarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meredith|2007|p=75}}; {{harvnb|Meintjes|1974|p=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One  charge  levelled by Livingstone and many others against the Boers was that when attacking tribal settlements they abducted women and children and took them home as slaves.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 31}} The Boer argument was that these were not slaves but ''[[Inboekstelsel|inboekelings]]''—[[indentured servant|indentured]] "apprentices" who, having lost their families, were given bed, board and training in a Boer household until reaching adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feinstein|2005|p=53}}; {{harvnb|Meintjes|1974|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2007|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholarship widely dismisses this as a ruse to create inexpensive labour while avoiding overt slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feinstein|2005|p=53}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2007|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The Boers contended that given the heavy casualties among their enemies this was a better way to treat the widows and orphans than to leave them alone.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p=36}} ''Inboekelings'' were sometimes obtained in exchange for land, food or other goods. Under the laws passed in the Transvaal males were supposed to be let go at the age of 25 and females at 21, but this was not always observed in the more remote districts. Even when they were released, many chose to stay with the Boers.{{sfn|Feinstein|2005|p=53}}|group = "n"|name = "inboekelings"}} Gezina Kruger had an ''inboekeling'' maid for whom she eventually arranged marriage, paying her a [[dowry]].{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 36}}

Having been promoted to the rank of lieutenant (between field cornet and [[commandant]]), Kruger formed part of a commando sent against the chief Montshiwa in December 1852 to recover some stolen cattle. Pretorius was still sick, and only nominally in command.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 31–32}} Seven months later, on 23 July 1853, Pretorius died, aged 54. Just before the end he sent for Kruger, but the young man arrived too late.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 33}} Meintjes comments that Pretorius "was perhaps the first person to recognise that behind [Kruger's] rough exterior was a most singular person with an intellect all the more remarkable for being almost entirely self-developed."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 26}}

==Commandant==

Pretorius did not name a successor as [[Commandant-General]]; his eldest son [[Marthinus Wessel Pretorius]] was appointed in his stead.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 33}} The younger Pretorius elevated Kruger to the rank of commandant.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 35}} Pretorius the son claimed power over not just the Transvaal but also the Orange River area—he said the British had promised it to his father—but virtually nobody, not even supporters like Kruger, accepted this.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 40}} Following [[George Cathcart|Sir George Cathcart]]'s replacement of Smith as governor in Cape Town, the British policy towards the Orange River Sovereignty changed to the extent that the British were willing to pull out and grant independence to a second Boer republic there. This was in spite of the fact that in addition to the Boer settlers there were many English-speaking colonists who wanted rule from the Cape to continue.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 36–37}} On 23 February 1854 [[George Russell Clerk|Sir George Russell Clerk]] signed the [[Orange River Convention]], ending the sovereignty and recognising what the Boers dubbed the ''[[Orange Free State|Oranje-Vrijstaat]]'' ("Orange Free State").{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 37}}

[[Bloemfontein]], the former British garrison town, became the Free State's capital; the Transvaal seat of government became [[Pretoria]], named after the elder Pretorius.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 37}} The South African Republic was in practice split between the south-west and central Transvaal, where most of Pretorius's supporters were, and regionalist factions in the [[Zoutpansberg]], [[Lydenburg]] and [[Utrecht, KwaZulu-Natal|Utrecht]] districts that viewed any central authority with suspicion.{{sfn|Bhebe|2000|pp = 159–161}} Kruger's first campaign as a commandant was in the latter part of 1854, against the chiefs Mapela and Makapan near the [[Waterberg Biosphere|Waterberg]]. The chiefs retreated into what became called the [[Makapansgat|Caves of Makapan]] ("Makapansgat") with many of their people and cattle, and a siege ensued in which thousands of the defenders died, mainly from starvation. When Commandant-General Piet Potgieter of Zoutpansberg was shot dead, Kruger advanced under heavy fire to retrieve the body and was almost killed himself.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 35–36}}

===Mediator===
[[File:M W Pretorius.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Marthinus Wessel Pretorius|M W Pretorius]], who became the Transvaal's first President in 1857|alt=A moustachioed man in a dark three-piece suit]]
Marthinus Pretorius hoped to achieve either federation or amalgamation with the Orange Free State, but before he could contemplate this he would have to unite the Transvaal. In 1855 he appointed an eight-man constitutional commission, including Kruger, which presented a draft constitution in September that year. Lydenburg and Zoutpansberg rejected the proposals, calling for a less centralised government. Pretorius tried again during 1856, holding meetings with eight-man commissions in Rustenburg, Potchefstroom and Pretoria, but [[Stephanus Schoeman]], Zoutpansberg's new Commandant-General, repudiated these efforts.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 37–39}}

The constitution settled upon formalised a national [[volksraad]] (parliament) and created an executive council, headed by a president. Pretorius was sworn in as the first president of the South African Republic on 6 January 1857. Kruger successfully proposed Schoeman for the post of national Commandant-General, hoping to thereby end the factional disputes and foster unity, but Schoeman categorically refused to serve under this constitution or Pretorius. With the Transvaal on the verge of civil war, tensions also rose with the Orange Free State after Pretorius's ambitions of absorbing it became widely known. Kruger had strong personal reservations about Pretorius, not considering him his father's equal, but nevertheless remained steadfastly loyal to him.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 39–41}}

After the Free State government dismissed an ultimatum from Pretorius to cease what he regarded as the marginalisation of his supporters south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to the border, prompting President [[Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff]] of the Free State to do the same. Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting their fellow Boers. When he learned that Boshoff had called on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough and that they would have to make terms.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 41–42}}

With Pretorius's approval, Kruger met Boshoff under a [[white flag]]. Kruger made clear that he personally disapproved of Pretorius's actions and the situation as a whole, but defended his president when the Free Staters began to speak harshly of him. A commission of 12 men from each republic, including Kruger, reached a compromise whereby Pretorius would drop his claim on the Free State, and a treaty was concluded on 2 June 1857.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 42–43}}{{#tag:ref|When two Free State burghers who had taken Pretorius's side were soon thereafter sentenced to hang for [[high treason]], Kruger went to Bloemfontein at Pretorius's request and persuaded the Free State government to commute the death sentences to fines, which he then even had reduced.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=42–43}}|group = "n"|name = "fines"}} Over the next year Kruger helped to negotiate a peace agreement between the Free State and [[Moshoeshoe I]] of the Basotho,{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 74–76}} and persuaded Schoeman to take part in successful talks regarding constitutional revisions, after which Zoutpansberg accepted the central government with Schoeman as commandant-general.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 44–45}} On 28 June 1858 Schoeman appointed Kruger Assistant Commandant-General of the South African Republic.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 47}} "All in all", Kruger's biographer T&amp;nbsp;R&amp;nbsp;H Davenport comments, "he had shown a loyalty to authority in political disputes, devotion to duty as an officer, and a real capacity for power play."{{sfn|Davenport|2004}}

===Forming the "Dopper Church"===

Kruger considered [[Divine providence|Providence]] his guide in life and referred to scripture constantly; he knew large sections of the Bible by heart.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p = 76}} He understood the biblical texts literally and inferred from them that the [[Flat Earth|Earth was flat]], a belief he retained firmly to his dying day.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p = 76}} At mealtimes he said [[Grace (prayer)|grace]] twice, at length and in formal Dutch rather than the South African dialect that was to become [[Afrikaans]].{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p = 168}} In late 1858, when he returned to Waterkloof, he was mentally and physically drained following the exertions of the past few years and in the midst of a spiritual crisis. Hoping to establish a personal relationship with God,{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 47–48}} he ventured into the Magaliesberg and spent several days without food or water. A search party found him "nearly dead from hunger and thirst", Davenport records.{{sfn|Davenport|2004}} The experience reinvigorated him and greatly intensified his faith, which for the rest of his life was unshakeable and, according to Meintjes, perceived by some of his contemporaries as like that of a child.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 47–48}}

Kruger belonged to the "Doppers"—a group of about 6,000 that followed an extremely strict interpretation of traditional Calvinist doctrine.{{sfn|Hexham|Poewe|1997|p = 126}} They based their theology almost entirely on the [[Old Testament]] and, among other things, wished to eschew hymns and organs and read only from the [[Psalms]].{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 76–77}} When the 1859 [[synod]] of the ''[[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NHK)|Nederduits Hervormde Kerk van Afrika]]'' (NHK), the main church in the Transvaal, decided to enforce the singing of modern hymns, Kruger led a group of Doppers that denounced the NHK as "deluded" and "false" and left its Rustenburg congregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hexham|Poewe|1997|p=126}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2007|pp=76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; They formed the ''[[Reformed Churches in South Africa|Gereformeerde Kerke van Zuid-Afrika]]'' (GK),{{sfn|Hexham|Poewe|1997|p = 126}} thereafter known informally as the "Dopper Church",{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 76–77}} and recruited the Reverend [[Dirk Postma]], a like-minded traditionalist recently arrived from the Netherlands, to be their minister.{{sfn|Hexham|Poewe|1997|p = 126}} This act also had secular ramifications as according to the 1858 constitution only NHK members could take part in public affairs.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 47–48}}

===Civil war; Commandant-General===
In late 1859 Pretorius was invited to stand for president in the Orange Free State, where many burghers now favoured union, partly as a means to overcome the Basotho. The Transvaal constitution he had just enacted made it illegal to simultaneously hold office abroad, but nevertheless he readily did so and won. The Transvaal volksraad attempted to side-step the constitutional problems surrounding this by granting Pretorius half a year's leave, hoping a solution might come about during this time, and the President duly left for Bloemfontein, appointing [[Johannes Hermanus Grobler]] to be acting president in his absence. Pretorius was sworn in as president of the Free State on 8 February 1860; he sent a deputation to Pretoria to negotiate union the next day.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 49–51}}

[[File:Stephanus Schoeman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Stephanus Schoeman]], a fierce opponent of Kruger during the 1860s|alt=An elderly man with a magnificent white beard]]
Kruger and others in the Transvaal government disliked Pretorius's unconstitutional dual presidency, and worried that Britain might declare the Sand River and Orange River Conventions void if the republics joined.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 49–51}} Pretorius was told by the Transvaal volksraad on 10 September 1860 to choose between his two posts—to the surprise of both supporters and detractors he resigned as President of the Transvaal and continued in the Free State.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 49–51}} After Schoeman unsuccessfully attempted to forcibly supplant Grobler as Acting President, Kruger persuaded him to submit to a volksraad hearing, where Schoeman was censured and relieved of his post. [[Willem Cornelis Janse van Rensburg]] was appointed Acting President while a new election was organised for October 1862. Having returned home, Kruger was surprised to receive a message urgently requesting his presence in the capital, the volksraad having recommended him as a suitable candidate; he replied that he was pleased to be summoned but his membership in the Dopper Church meant he could not enter politics. Van Rensburg promptly had legislation passed to give equal political rights to members of all Reformed denominations.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 52–53}}

Schoeman mustered a commando at Potchefstroom, but was routed by Kruger on the night of 9 October 1862. After Schoeman returned with a larger force Kruger and Pretorius held negotiations where it was agreed to hold a special court on the disturbances in January 1863, and soon thereafter fresh elections for president and commandant-general.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 54–56}} Schoeman was found guilty of rebellion against the state and banished. In May the election results were announced—Van Rensburg became president, with Kruger as commandant-general. Both expressed disappointment at the low turnout and resolved to hold another set of elections. Van Rensburg's opponent this time was Pretorius, who had resigned his office in the Orange Free State and returned to the Transvaal. Turnout was higher and on 12 October the volksraad announced another Van Rensburg victory. Kruger was returned as commandant-general with a large majority.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 56–57}} The [[Transvaal Civil War|civil war]] ended with Kruger's victory over Jan Viljoen's commando, raised in support of Pretorius and Schoeman, at the [[Crocodile River (Limpopo)|Crocodile River]] on 5 January 1864. Elections were held yet again, and this time Pretorius defeated Van Rensburg. Kruger was re-elected as commandant-general with over two-thirds of the vote.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 58–60}}

The civil war had led to an economic collapse in the Transvaal, weakening the government's ability to back up its professed authority and sovereignty over the local chiefdoms,{{sfn|Davenport|2004}} though Lydenburg and Utrecht did now accept the central administration.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 44}} By 1865 tensions had risen with the Zulus to the east and war had broken out again between the Orange Free State and the Basotho. Pretorius and Kruger led a commando of about 1,000 men south to help the Free State. The Basotho were defeated and Moshoeshoe ceded some of his territory, but President [[Johannes Brand]] of the Free State decided not to give any of the conquered land to the Transvaal burghers. The Transvaal men were scandalised and returned home en masse, despite Kruger's attempts to maintain discipline.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 61–63}} The following February, after a meeting of the executive council in Potchefstroom, Kruger capsized his cart during the journey home and broke his left leg. On one leg he righted the cart and continued the rest of the way. This injury incapacitated him for the next nine months, and his left leg was thereafter slightly shorter than his right.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 61–63}}

[[File:ThFBurgers CHM VA0897.jpg|thumb|upright|President [[Thomas François Burgers]], whose election dismayed Kruger|alt=A dark-haired man with a scruffy beard]]
In 1867, Pretoria sent Kruger to restore law and order in Zoutpansberg. He had around 500 men but very low reserves of ammunition, and discipline in the ranks was poor. On reaching [[Schoemansdal, Limpopo|Schoemansdal]], which was under threat by the chief Katlakter, Kruger and his officers resolved that holding the town was impossible and ordered a general evacuation, following which Katlakter razed the town. The loss of Schoemansdal, once a prosperous settlement by Boer standards, was considered a great humiliation by many burghers. The Transvaal government formally exonerated Kruger over the matter, ruling that he had been forced to evacuate Schoemansdal by factors beyond his control, but some still argued that he had given the town up too readily.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 64–65}} Peace returned to Zoutpansberg in 1869, following the intervention of the republic's  [[Swazi people|Swazi]] allies.{{sfn|Davenport|2004}}

Pretorius stepped down as president in November 1871. In the [[Transvaal presidential election, 1872|1872 election]] Kruger's preferred candidate, William Robinson, was decisively defeated by the Reverend [[Thomas François Burgers]], a church minister from the Cape who was noted for his eloquent preaching but controversial for some because of his liberal interpretation of the scriptures. He did not believe in the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]], for example.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 68–71}}{{#tag:ref|The Doppers despised Burgers, denouncing him as "Godless"; some even called him the [[Antichrist]].{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=73–74}}|group = "n"|name = "antichrist"}} Kruger publicly accepted Burgers's election, announcing at his inauguration that "as a good republican" he submitted to the vote of the majority, but he had grave personal reservations regarding the new president.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 68–71}} He particularly disliked Burgers's new education law, which restricted children's religious instruction to outside school hours—in Kruger's view an affront to God.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 73–74}} This, coupled with the sickness of Gezina and their children with malaria, caused Kruger to lose interest in his office. In May 1873 he requested an honourable discharge from his post, which Burgers promptly granted. The office of commandant-general was abolished the following week. Kruger moved his main residence to [[Boekenhoutfontein]], near Rustenburg, and for a time absented himself from public affairs.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 68–71}}{{#tag:ref|Kruger had owned Boekenhoutfontein since 1860.

==Diamonds and deputations==

===Under Burgers===

[[File:The Cape Colony - 1878.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A map of South Africa in 1878, showing the Transvaal or [[South African Republic]] (''purple''), the [[Orange Free State]] (''yellow''), the [[Cape Colony]] (''red''), [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] (''orange'') and neighbouring territories|alt=A map. See description]]
Burgers busied himself attempting to modernise the South African Republic along European lines, hoping to set in motion a process that would lead to a united, independent South Africa. Finding Boer officialdom inadequate, he imported ministers and civil servants en masse from the Netherlands. His ascent to the presidency came shortly after the realisation that the Boer republics might stand on land of immense mineral wealth. Diamonds had been discovered in [[Griqua people|Griqua]] territory just north of the Orange River on the western edge of the Free State, arousing the interest of Britain and other countries; mostly British settlers, referred to by the Boers as [[uitlander]]s ("out-landers"), were flooding into the region.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 72–75}} Britain began to pursue [[federation]] (at that time often referred to as "confederation") of the Boer republics with the Cape and Natal and in 1873, over Boer objections, annexed the area surrounding the huge [[Big Hole|diamond mine]] at [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], dubbing it [[Griqualand West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blake|1967|pp=666–672}}; {{harvnb|Meintjes|1974|pp=72–75}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|This followed the annexation of [[Basutoland]] to the Cape Colony in 1868.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=81}}|group = "n"|name = "basutoland"}}

Some Doppers preferred to embark on another trek, north-west across the [[Kalahari Desert]] towards Angola, rather than live under Burgers. This became the [[Dorsland Trek]] of 1874. The emigrants asked Kruger to lead the way, but he refused to take part. In September 1874, following a long delay calling the volksraad due to sickness, Burgers proposed a railway to Delagoa Bay and said he would go to Europe to raise the necessary funds. By the time he left in February 1875 opposition pressure had brought about an amendment to bring religious instruction back into school hours, and Kruger had been restored to the executive council.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 72–75}}

In 1876 hostilities broke out with the [[Pedi people|Bapedi]] people under [[Sekhukhune]]. Burgers had told the Acting President [[Piet Joubert]] not to fight a war in his absence, so the Transvaal government did little to combat the Bapedi raids. On his return Burgers resolved to send a commando against Sekhukhune; he called on Kruger to lead the column, but much to his surprise the erstwhile commandant-general refused. Burgers unsuccessfully asked Joubert to head the commando, then approached Kruger twice more, but to no avail. Kruger was convinced that God would cause any military expedition organised by Burgers to fail—particularly if the President rode with the commando, which he was determined to do.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 75–78}} "I cannot lead the commando if you come", Kruger said, "for, with your merry evenings in laager and your Sunday dances, the enemy will even shoot me behind the wall; for God's blessing will not rest on your expedition."{{sfn|Kruger|1902|p = 110}} Burgers, who had no military experience, led the commando himself after several other prospective generals rebuffed him. After being routed by Sekhukhune, he hired a group of "volunteers" under the German Conrad von Schlickmann to defend the country, paying for this by levying a special tax. The war ended, but Burgers became extremely unpopular among his electorate.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 75–78}}

With Burgers due to stand for re-election the following year, Kruger became a popular alternative candidate, but he resolved to stand by the President after Burgers privately assured him that he would do his utmost to defend the South African Republic's independence. The towns of the Transvaal were becoming increasingly British in character as immigration and trade gathered apace, and the idea of annexation was gaining support both locally and in the British government. In late 1876 [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]], [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] under [[Benjamin Disraeli]], gave [[Theophilus Shepstone|Sir Theophilus Shepstone]] of Natal a special commission to confer with the South African Republic's government and, if he saw fit, annex the country.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 78–81}}

===British annexation; first and second deputations===
Shepstone arrived in Pretoria in January 1877. He outlined criticisms expressed by Carnarvon regarding the Transvaal government and expressed support for federation. After a joint commission of inquiry on the British grievances—Kruger and the State Attorney [[E. J. P. Jorissen|E&amp;nbsp;J&amp;nbsp;P Jorissen]] refuted most of Carnarvon's allegations, one of which was that Pretoria tolerated slavery—Shepstone stayed in the capital, openly telling Burgers he had come to the Transvaal to annex it. Hoping to stop the annexation by reforming the government, Burgers introduced scores of bills and revisions to a bewildered volksraad, which opposed them all but then passed them, heightening the general mood of discord and confusion. One of these reforms appointed Kruger to the new post of vice-president.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 81–83}}

The impression of Kruger garnered by the British envoys in Pretoria during early 1877 was one of an unspeakably vulgar, bigoted backveld peasant.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 76–79}} Regarding his austere, weather-beaten face, greying hair and simple Dopper dress of a short-cut black jacket, baggy trousers and a black top hat, they considered him extremely ugly. Furthermore, they found his personal habits, such as copious spitting, revolting. Shepstone's legal adviser William Morcom was one of the first British officials to write about Kruger: calling him "gigantically horrible", he recounted a public luncheon at which Kruger dined with a dirty [[pipe smoking|pipe]] protruding from his pocket and such greasy hair that he spent part of the meal combing it.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 78–79}} According to [[Martin Meredith]], Kruger's unsightliness was mentioned in British reports "so often that it became shorthand for his whole personality, and indeed, his objectives".{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 78–79}} They did not consider him a major threat to British ambitions.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 78–79}}

[[File:Jorissen, E J P.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[E. J. P. Jorissen|E J P Jorissen]], Kruger's colleague in the first deputation to London, pictured in 1897|alt=A grey-haired man with a dark jacket and a tie]]
Shepstone had the Transvaal's annexation as a British territory formally announced in Pretoria on 11 April 1877. Burgers resigned and returned to the Cape to live in retirement—his last act as president was to announce the government's decision to send a deputation, headed by Kruger and Jorissen, to London to make an official protest. He exhorted the burghers not to attempt any kind of resistance to the British until these diplomats returned.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 83–85, 89}} Jorissen, one of the Dutch officials recently imported by Burgers, was included at Kruger's request because of his wide knowledge of European languages (Kruger was not confident in his English); a second Dutchman, [[Willem Eduard Bok]], accompanied them as secretary.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 6, 85}} They left in May 1877, travelling first to Bloemfontein to confer with the Free State government, then on to Kimberley and [[Worcester, Western Cape|Worcester]], where the 51-year-old Kruger boarded a train for the first time in his life. In Cape Town, where his German ancestor had landed 164 years before, he had his first sight of the sea.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 85–86}}

During the voyage to England Kruger encountered a 19-year-old law student from the Orange Free State named [[Martinus Theunis Steyn]].{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 85–87}} Jorissen and Bok marvelled at Kruger, in their eyes more suited to the 17th century than his own time. One night, when Kruger heard the two Dutchmen discussing celestial bodies and the structure of the universe, he interjected that if their conversation was accurate and the Earth was not flat, he might as well throw his Bible overboard.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 85–87}} At the [[Colonial Office]] in [[Whitehall]], Carnarvon and Kruger's own colleagues were astonished when, speaking through interpreters, he rose to what Meintjes calls "remarkable heights of oratory", averring that the annexation breached the Sand River Convention and went against the popular will in the Transvaal.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 87–88}} His arguments were undermined by reports to the contrary from Shepstone and other British officials, and by a widely publicised letter from a Potchefstroom vicar claiming that Kruger only represented the will of "a handful of irreconcilables".{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 87–88}} Carnarvon dismissed Kruger's idea of a general plebiscite and concluded that British rule would remain.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 87–88}}

Kruger did not meet [[Queen Victoria]], though such an audience is described in numerous anecdotes, depicted in films and sometimes reported as fact.{{#tag:ref|The statement in Manfred Nathan's ''Paul Kruger: His Life and Times'' (1941) that the deputation received a royal audience at [[Windsor Castle]] is specifically refuted in the first volume of D&amp;nbsp;W Krüger's ''Paul Kruger'' (1961). Meintjes agrees with D&amp;nbsp;W Krüger that no audience occurred.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=87–88}}|group = "n"|name = "victoria"}} Between August and October he visited the Netherlands and Germany, where he aroused little general public interest, but made a potent impact in the Reformed congregations he visited. After a brief sojourn back in England he returned to South Africa and arrived at Boekenhoutfontein shortly before Christmas 1877.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 88–89}} He found a national awakening occurring. "Paradoxically", John Laband writes, "British occupation seemed to be fomenting a sense of national consciousness in the Transvaal which years of fractious independence had failed to elicit."{{sfn|Laband|2014|p = 23}} When Kruger visited Pretoria in January 1878 he was greeted by a procession that took him to a mass gathering in [[Church Square, Pretoria|Church Square]]. Attempting to stir up the crowd, Kruger said that since Carnarvon had told him the annexation would not be revoked he could not see what more they could do. The gambit worked; burghers began shouting that they would sooner die fighting for their country than submit to the British.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 89–90}}

[[File:Pjjoubert.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Piet Joubert]], Kruger's associate in the second deputation|alt=A man with a huge beard and a dark jacket]]
According to Meintjes, Kruger was still not particularly anti-British; he thought the British had made a mistake and would rectify the situation if this could be proven to them.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 89–90}} After conducting a poll through the former republican infrastructure—587 signed in favour of the annexation, 6,591 against—he organised a second deputation to London, made up of himself and Joubert with Bok again serving as secretary.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 90–91}} The envoys met the British [[High Commissioner for Southern Africa|High Commissioner]] in Cape Town, [[Henry Bartle Frere|Sir Bartle Frere]],{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 90–91}} and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a censorious letter from Shepstone waiting for them, along with a communication that since Kruger was agitating against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council.{{#tag:ref|Kruger had remained in the executive under the British and accepted a salary, even successfully requesting a raise, though he did not take the new oath of allegiance. This was in stark contrast to Joubert (outside the government at the time of the annexation), who refused to have anything to do with the British authorities. Some burghers denounced Kruger's actions as hypocritical.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=91–92}}|group = "n"|name = "salaryunderbritish"}}

Carnarvon had been succeeded as colonial secretary by [[Michael Hicks Beach, 1st Earl St Aldwyn|Sir Michael Hicks Beach]], who received the deputation coldly. After Bok gave a lengthy opening declaration, Hicks Beach muttered: "Have you ever heard of an instance where the British Lion has ever given up anything on which he had set his paw?" Kruger retorted: "Yes. The Orange Free State."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 92–93}} The deputation remained in London for some weeks thereafter, communicating by correspondence with Hicks Beach, who eventually reaffirmed Carnarvon's decision that the annexation would not be revoked. The deputation attempted to rally support for their cause, as the first mission had done, but with the [[Eastern Question]] dominating the political scene few were interested.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 92–93}} One English sympathiser gave Kruger a gold ring, bearing the inscription: "Take courage, your cause is just and must triumph in the end."{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p = 81}} Kruger was touched and wore it for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p = 81}}

Like its predecessor, the second deputation went on from England to continental Europe, visiting the Netherlands, France and Germany.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 93}} In [[Paris]], where the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 ''Exposition Universelle'']] was in progress, Kruger saw a [[hot air balloon]] for the first time and readily took part in an ascent to view the city from above. "High up in mid-air", he recalled, "I jestingly asked the aeronaut, as we had gone so far, to take me all the way home."{{sfn|Kruger|1902|p = 132}} The pilot asked who Kruger was and, on their descent, gave him a medal "to remind me of my journey through the air".{{sfn|Kruger|1902|p = 132}} The deputation composed a long reply to Hicks Beach, which was published as an [[open letter]] in the British press soon before they sailed for home on 24 October 1878. Unless the annexation were revoked, the letter stated, the Transvaal Boers would not co-operate regarding federation.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 94}}

===Drive for independence===

Kruger and Joubert returned home to find the British and the Zulus were close to war. Shepstone had supported the Zulus in a border dispute with the South African Republic, but then, after annexing the Transvaal, changed his mind and endorsed the Boer claim.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 94–95}} Meeting Sir Bartle Frere and [[Frederic Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] at [[Pietermaritzburg]] on 28 November 1878, Kruger happily gave tactical guidance for the British campaign—he advised the use of Boer tactics, making laagers at every stop and constantly scouting ahead—but refused Frere's request that he accompany one of the British columns, saying he would only help if assurances were made regarding the Transvaal.{{#tag:ref|Kruger also refused a subsequent request from Shepstone to raise a Boer commando to help the British in Zululand.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=94–96}}|group = "n"|name = "commandoforbritish"}} Chelmsford thought the campaign would be a "promenade" and did not take Kruger's advice.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 94–96}} Soon after he entered Zululand in January 1879, starting the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], his unlaagered central column was surprised by [[Cetshwayo kaMpande|Cetshwayo]]'s Zulus at [[Battle of Isandlwana|Isandlwana]] and almost totally destroyed.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 94–96}}

[[File:Garnet Joseph Wolseley, 1874.png|thumb|upright|[[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Sir Garnet Wolseley]], who headed the British Transvaal administration from 1879 to 1880|alt=A moustachioed man with closely cropped hair and a chest covered in military medals]]
The war in Zululand effectively ended on 4 July 1879 with Chelmsford's decisive [[Battle of Ulundi|victory]] at the Zulu capital [[Ulundi]]. Around the same time the British appointed a new Governor and High Commissioner for the Transvaal and Natal, [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Sir Garnet Wolseley]], who introduced a new Transvaal constitution giving the Boers a limited degree of self-government.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 96–100}} Wolseley blunted the Zulu military threat by splitting the kingdom into 13 chiefdoms, and crushed Sekhukhune and the Bapedi during late 1879. He had little success in winning the Boers over to the idea of federation; his defeat of the Zulus and the Bapedi had the opposite effect, as with these two long-standing threats to security removed the Transvaalers could focus all their efforts against the British.{{sfn|Laband|2014|p = 22}} Most Boers refused to co-operate with Wolseley's new order;{{sfn|Laband|2014|p = 23}} Kruger declined a seat in the new executive council.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 100}}

At Wonderfontein on 15 December 1879, 6,000 burghers, many of them bearing the republic's ''[[Flag of Transvaal|vierkleur]]'' ("four-colour") flag, voted to pursue a restored, independent republic.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 101}} Pretorius and Bok were imprisoned on charges of [[high treason]] when they took this news to Wolseley and [[Owen Lanyon|Sir Owen Lanyon]] (who had replaced Shepstone),{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 101}} prompting many burghers to consider rising up there and then—Kruger persuaded them not to, saying this was premature.{{sfn|Laband|2014|p = 23}} Pretorius and Bok were swiftly released after Jorissen telegraphed the British [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician [[William Ewart Gladstone]], who had met Kruger's first deputation in London and had since condemned the annexation as unjust during his [[Midlothian campaign]].{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 88, 101–102}}

In early 1880 Hicks Beach forwarded a scheme for South African federation to the [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Parliament]].{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 102–103}} Kruger travelled to the Cape to agitate against the proposals alongside Joubert and Jorissen; by the time they arrived the Liberals had won an [[United Kingdom general election, 1880|election victory]] in Britain and Gladstone was prime minister.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 102–103}} In Cape Town, [[Paarl]] and elsewhere Kruger lobbied vigorously against the annexation and won much sympathy.{{#tag:ref|He spoke of the kind of self-government the British were offering in derisory terms: "They say to you, 'First put your head quietly in the noose, so that I can hang you up: then you may kick your legs about as much as you please!'

Kruger concluded that they had done all they could to try to regain independence peacefully, and over the following months the Transvaal burghers prepared for rebellion.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 102–105}} Wolseley was replaced as governor and high commissioner by [[George Pomeroy Colley|Sir George Pomeroy Colley]].{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 102–105}}

In the last months of 1880, Lanyon began to pursue tax payments from burghers who were in arrears.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 105}} [[Piet Cronjé]], a farmer in the Potchefstroom district, gave his local [[landdrost]] a written statement that the burghers would pay taxes to their "legal government"—that of the South African Republic—but not to the British "usurper" administration. Kruger and Cronjé knew each other; the writer Johan Frederik van Oordt, who was acquainted with them both, suggested that Kruger may have had a hand in this and what followed.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 105}} In November, when the British authorities in Potchefstroom were about to auction off a burgher's wagon that had been seized amid a tax dispute, Cronjé and a group of armed Boers intervened, overcame the presiding officers and reclaimed the wagon.{{sfn|Laband|2014|p = 50}} On hearing of this from Cronjé, Kruger told Joubert: "I can no longer restrain the people, and the English government is entirely responsible for the present state of things."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 106}}

Starting on 8 December 1880 at [[Krugersdorp|Paardekraal]], a farm to the south-west of Pretoria, 10,000 Boers congregated—the largest recorded meeting of white people in South Africa up to that time. "I stand here before you", Kruger declared, "called by the people. In the voice of the people I have heard the voice of God, the King of Nations, and I obey!"{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 106}} He announced the fulfilment of the decision taken at Wonderfontein the previous year to restore the South African Republic government and volksraad, which as the vice-president of the last independent administration he considered his responsibility.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 106–107}} To help him in this he turned to Jorissen and Bok, who respectively became State Attorney and State Secretary, and Pretorius and Joubert, who the reconstituted volksraad elected to an executive [[triumvirate]] along with Kruger.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 106–107}} The assembly approved a proclamation announcing the restoration of the South African Republic.{{sfn|Laband|2014|p = 51}}

At Kruger's suggestion Joubert was elected Commandant-General of the restored republic, though he had little military experience and protested he was not suited to the position.{{sfn|Laband|2014|p = 51}} The provisional government set up a temporary capital at [[Heidelberg, Gauteng|Heidelberg]], a strategically placed town on the main road from Natal, and sent a copy of the proclamation to Lanyon along with a written demand that he surrender the government offices in Pretoria.{{sfn|Laband|2014|p = 52}} Lanyon refused and mobilised the British garrison.{{sfn|Laband|2014|p = 52}}

Kruger took part in the [[First Boer War]] in a civilian capacity only, playing a diplomatic and political role with the aid of Jorissen and Bok.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 109–111}} The first major clash, a successful Boer ambush, took place on 20 December 1880 at [[Battle of Bronkhorstspruit|Bronkhorstspruit]].{{sfn|Castle|1996|pp = 23–27}} By the turn of the year the Transvaalers had all six British garrison outposts, including that in Pretoria, under siege.{{sfn|Castle|1996|p = 21}}  Colley assembled a [[Natal Field Force|field force]] in Natal, summoned reinforcements from India, and advanced towards the Transvaal.{{sfn|Castle|1996|pp = 27–30}} Joubert moved about 2,000 Boers south to the [[Drakensberg]] and repulsed Colley at [[Battle of Laing's Nek|Laing's Nek]] on 28 January 1881.{{sfn|Castle|1996|pp = 31–43}} After Colley retreated to Schuinshoogte, near [[Ingogo]], he was attacked by Joubert's second-in-command [[Nicolaas Smit]] on 8 February and again [[Battle of Schuinshoogte|defeated]].{{sfn|Castle|1996|pp = 46–56}}

Understanding that they could not hold out against the might of the British Empire indefinitely, Kruger hoped for a solution at the earliest opportunity.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 111}} The triumvirate wrote to Colley on 12 February that they were prepared to submit to a royal commission. Colley liaised by telegraph with Gladstone's Colonial Secretary [[John Wodehouse, 1st Earl of Kimberley|Lord Kimberley]], then wrote to Kruger on 21 February that if the Boers stopped fighting he would cease hostilities and send commissioners for talks. Kruger received this letter on 28 February and readily accepted, but by now it was too late. Colley had been killed at the [[Battle of Majuba Hill]] the day before, another decisive victory for the Boers under Smit.&lt;ref name="humiliation"&gt;{{harvnb|Meintjes|1974|pp=113–114, 141}}; {{harvnb|Castle|1996|pp=82–83, 87}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This progressive humiliation of the Imperial forces in South Africa by a ragtag collection of farmers, to paraphrase Meintjes and the historian Ian Castle, stunned the Western world.&lt;ref name="humiliation" /&gt;

Colley's death horrified Kruger, who feared it might jeopardise the peace process.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 113–114}} His reply to Colley's letter was delivered to his successor [[Evelyn Wood (British Army officer)|Sir Evelyn Wood]] on 7 March 1881, a day after Wood and Joubert had agreed to an eight-day truce.{{sfn|Castle|1996|pp = 86–87}} Kruger was outraged to learn of this armistice, which in his view only gave the British opportunity to strengthen their forces—he expected a British attempt to avenge Majuba, which indeed Wood and others wanted{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 115–116}}—but Gladstone wanted peace, and Wood was instructed to proceed with talks.{{sfn|Castle|1996|pp = 86–87}} Negotiations began on 16 March. The British offered amnesty for the Boer leaders, [[cession|retrocession]] of the Transvaal under British [[suzerainty]], a British resident in Pretoria and British control over foreign affairs.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 115–116}} Kruger pressed on how the British intended to withdraw and what exactly "suzerainty" meant.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 117}} Brand arrived to mediate on 20 March and the following day agreement was reached; the British committed to formally restore the republic within six months.{{#tag:ref|Kruger was briefly incensed when Wood held that no written agreement to this effect was necessary, the [[minutes]] being in his view sufficient, but Wood ultimately relented and put his signature to the terms along with the Boer triumvirate.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=118–119}}|group = "n"|name = "signingtreaty"}} The final treaty was concluded on 23 March 1881.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 118–119}}

===Pretoria Convention===

Kruger presented the treaty to the volksraad on the triumvirate's behalf at Heidelberg on 15 April 1881. "With a feeling of gratitude to the God of our fathers", he said, "who has been near us in battle and danger, it is to me an unspeakable privilege to lay before you the treaty&amp;nbsp;... I consider it my duty plainly to declare before you and the whole world, that our respect for Her Majesty the Queen of England, for the government of Her Majesty, and for the English Nation, has never been greater than at this time, when we are enabled to show you a proof of England's noble and magnanimous love for right and justice."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 119}} This statement was to be ignored by many writers,{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 119}} but Manfred Nathan, one of Kruger's biographers, stresses it as one of his "most notable utterances".{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 119}} Kruger reaffirmed his faith in the royal commission of Wood, [[Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead|Sir Hercules Robinson]] and the Cape's Chief Justice [[John de Villiers, 1st Baron de Villiers|Sir Henry de Villiers]], who convened for the first time in Natal on 30 April, Brand with them as an adviser. The commissioners held numerous sessions in Pretoria over the following months with little input from Kruger, who was bedridden with [[pneumonia]].{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 119–122}}

Kruger was largely happy with the terms under which the republic would regain its sovereignty, but two points offended him. The first of these was that the British would recognise them as the "Transvaal Republic" and not the South African Republic; the second was that it was still not clear to him what British "suzerainty" was. The commission, in which De Villiers emerged as the dominant figure, defined it primarily as British purview over the Transvaal's external affairs. The final [[Pretoria Convention]] was signed on 3 August 1881 by Joubert, Pretorius and the members of the royal commission. Kruger was absent due to his illness, but he did attend the official retrocession five days later in Church Square. Kruger felt well enough to give only a short speech, after which Pretorius addressed the crowd and the ''vierkleur'' was raised.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 122–123}}

[[File:Krugerhouse.jpg|thumb|[[Kruger House, Pretoria|Kruger House]], the family home in [[Pretoria]] ''(2008 photograph)''|alt=A Dutch colonial-style house with the flag of the South African Republic flying outside.]]
By now aged nearly 56, Kruger resolved that he could no longer travel constantly between Boekenhoutfontein and the capital, and in August 1881 he and Gezina moved to Church Street, Pretoria, from where he could easily walk to the government offices on Church Square. Also around this time he shaved off his moustache and most of his facial hair, leaving the [[chinstrap beard]] he kept thereafter. His and Gezina's permanent home on Church Street, what is now called [[Kruger House, Pretoria|Kruger House]], would be completed in 1884.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 124–125}}

A direct consequence of the end of British rule was an economic slump; the Transvaal government almost immediately found itself again on the verge of bankruptcy.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 127–128}} The triumvirate spent two months discussing the terms of the Pretoria Convention with the new volksraad—approve it or go back to Laing's Nek, said Kruger{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 127–128}}—before it was finally ratified on 25 October 1881. During this time Kruger introduced tax reforms, announced the triumvirate's decision to grant industrial [[monopoly|monopolies]] to raise money and appointed the Reverend [[Stephanus Jacobus du Toit|S&amp;nbsp;J du Toit]] to be Superintendent of Education.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 127–128}} To counteract the influx of uitlanders, the residency qualification to vote was raised from a year to five years.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p = 294}} In July 1882 the volksraad decided to elect a new president the following year; Joubert and Kruger emerged as candidates. Kruger campaigned on the idea of an administration in which "God's Word would be my rule of conduct"—as premier he would prioritise agriculture, industry and education, revive Burgers's Delagoa Bay railway scheme, introduce an immigration policy that would "prevent the Boer nationality from being stifled", and pursue a cordial stance towards Britain and "obedient native races in their appointed districts".{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 130–131}} He [[Transvaal presidential election, 1883|defeated]] Joubert by 3,431 votes to 1,171,{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 130–131}} and was inaugurated as president on 9 May 1883.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 134}}

Kruger became president soon after the discovery of gold near what was to become [[Barberton, Mpumalanga|Barberton]], which prompted a fresh influx of uitlander diggers. "This gold is still going to soak our country in blood", said Joubert—a prediction he would repeat many times over the coming years.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 135}} Joubert remained commandant-general under Kruger and also became vice-president.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 135}} A convoluted situation developed on the Transvaal's western frontier, where burghers had crossed the border defined in the Pretoria Convention and formed two new Boer republics, [[Stellaland]] and [[State of Goshen|Goshen]], on former Tswana territory in 1882.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 136–138}} These states were tiny but they occupied land of potentially huge importance—the main road from the Cape to Matabeleland and the African interior.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 136–138}}

Kruger and the volksraad resolved to send yet another deputation to London to renegotiate the Pretoria Convention and settle the western border issue. The third deputation, comprising Kruger, Smit and Du Toit with Jan Eloff as secretary, left the Transvaal in August 1883 and sailed from Cape Town two months later. Kruger spent part of the voyage to Britain studying the English language with a Bible printed in Dutch and English side by side. Talks with the new Colonial Secretary [[Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby|Lord Derby]] and Robinson progressed smoothly—apart from an incident when Kruger, thinking himself insulted, nearly punched Robinson—and on 27 February 1884 the [[London Convention (1884)|London Convention]], superseding that of Pretoria, was concluded. Britain ended its suzerainty, reduced the Transvaal's [[national debt]] and once again recognised the country as the South African Republic. The western border question remained unresolved, but Kruger still considered the convention a triumph.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 136–140}}{{#tag:ref|While in London the deputation ran short of cash and had trouble paying their accommodation costs.

[[File:Graf v. Bismarck.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], one of the many European leaders Kruger met in 1884|alt=A balding man with a large moustache]]
The deputation went on from London to mainland Europe, where according to Meintjes their reception "was beyond all expectations&amp;nbsp;... one banquet followed the other, the stand of a handful of Boers against the British Empire having caused a sensation".{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 141–145}} During a grand tour Kruger met [[William III of the Netherlands]] and his son the [[Alexander, Prince of Orange|Prince of Orange]], [[Leopold II of Belgium]], President [[Jules Grévy]] of France, [[Alfonso XII of Spain]], [[Luís I of Portugal]], and in Germany Kaiser [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] and his Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]]. His public appearances were attended by tens of thousands.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 141–145}} The deputation discussed the bilateral aspects of the proposed Delagoa Bay railway with the Portuguese, and in the Netherlands laid the groundwork for the [[Netherlands-South African Railway Company]], which would build and operate it.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 141–145}} Kruger now held that Burgers had been "far ahead of his time"{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 141–145}}—while reviving his predecessor's railway scheme, he also brought back the policy of importing officials from the Netherlands, in his view a means to strengthen the Boer identity and keep the Transvaal "Dutch". [[Willem Johannes Leyds]], a 24-year-old Dutchman, returned to South Africa with the deputation as the republic's new State Attorney.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 141–145}}

By late 1884 the [[Scramble for Africa]] was well underway. Competition on the western frontier rose after Germany annexed [[German South-West Africa|South-West Africa]]; at the behest of the mining magnate and Cape MP [[Cecil Rhodes]], Britain proclaimed a [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|protectorate]] over Bechuanaland, including the Stellaland–Goshen corridor. While Joubert was in negotiations with Rhodes, Du Toit had Kruger proclaim Transvaal protection over the corridor on 18 September 1884. Joubert was outraged, as was Kruger when on 3 October Du Toit unilaterally hoisted the ''vierkleur'' in Goshen. Realising the implications of this—it clearly violated the London Convention—Kruger had the flag stricken immediately and retracted his proclamation of 18 September. Meeting Rhodes personally in late January 1885, Kruger insisted the "flag incident" had taken place without his consent and conceded the corridor to the British.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 145–150}}

===Gold rush; burghers and uitlanders===
[[File:FERREIRA GOLD MINING CO. - Three hundred feet underground (stope).jpg|thumb|Gold mining at [[Johannesburg]] in 1893|alt=Inside a gold mine; men stand in a rough underground passage.]]
In July 1886 an Australian prospector reported to the Transvaal government his discovery of an unprecedented gold reef between Pretoria and Heidelberg. The South African Republic's formal proclamation of this two months later prompted the [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]] and the founding of [[Johannesburg]], which within a few years was the largest city in southern Africa, populated almost entirely by uitlanders.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 151–153}} The economic landscape of the region was transformed overnight—the South African Republic went from the verge of bankruptcy in 1886 to a fiscal output equal to the Cape Colony's the following year.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 201–202}} The British became anxious to link Johannesburg to the Cape and Natal by rail, but Kruger thought this might have undesirable geopolitical and economic implications if done prematurely and gave the Delagoa Bay line first priority.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 151–153}}

The President was by this time widely nicknamed ''Oom Paul'' ("Uncle Paul"), both among the Boers and the uitlanders, who variously used it out of affection or contempt.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 153–156}} He was perceived by some as a despot after he compromised the independence of the republic's judiciary to help his friend [[Alois Hugo Nellmapius]], who had been found guilty of [[embezzlement]]—Kruger rejected the court's judgement and granted Nellmapius a full [[pardon]], an act Nathan calls "completely indefensible".{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 151–152}} Kruger defeated Joubert again in the [[Transvaal presidential election, 1888|1888 election]], by 4,483 votes to 834, and was sworn in for a second time in May. Nicolaas Smit was elected vice-president, and Leyds was promoted to state secretary.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 156–159}}

[[File:FWReitz VA0947.jpg|thumb|left|upright|President [[Francis William Reitz]] of the Orange Free State|alt=A man with a huge black beard]]
Much of Kruger's efforts over the next year were dedicated to attempts to acquire a sea outlet for the South African Republic. In July Pieter Grobler, who had just negotiated a treaty with King [[Lobengula]] of Matabeleland, was killed by [[Mangwato tribe|Ngwato]] warriors on his way home; Kruger alleged that this was the work of "Cecil Rhodes and his clique".{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 156–159}} Kruger despised Rhodes, considering him corrupt and immoral—in his memoirs he called him "capital incarnate" and "the curse of South Africa".{{sfn|Kruger|1902|pp = 192–194}} According to the editor of Kruger's memoirs, Rhodes attempted to win him as an ally by suggesting "we simply take" Delagoa Bay from Portugal; Kruger was appalled.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 156–159}} Failing to make headway in talks with the Portuguese, Kruger switched his attention to [[Kosi Bay]], next to Swaziland, in late 1888.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 156–159}}

In early 1889 Kruger and the new Orange Free State President [[Francis William Reitz]] enacted a common-defence pact and a  customs treaty waiving most import duties.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 159–160}} The same year the volksraad passed constitutional revisions to remove the ''Nederduits Hervormde Kerk'''s official status, open the legislature to members of other denominations and make all churches "sovereign in their own spheres".{{sfn|Davenport|2004}} Kruger proposed to end the lack of higher education in the Boer republics by forming a university in Pretoria; enthusiastic support emerged for this but the [[VU University Amsterdam|Free University of Amsterdam]] expressed strong opposition, not wishing to lose the Afrikaner element of its student body.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 161–163}} No university was built.{{#tag:ref|Higher education came to the Transvaal only following Kruger's death; the [[University of Pretoria]] was established in 1908.{{sfn|Lulat|2005|p=299}}|group = "n"|name = "universityofpretoria"}}

Kruger was obsessed with the South African Republic's independence,{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 124}} the retention of which he perceived as under threat if the Transvaal became too British in character. The uitlanders created an acute predicament in his mind. Taxation on their mining provided almost all of the republic's revenues, but they had very limited civic representation and almost no say in the running of the country. Though the English language was dominant in the mining areas, only Dutch remained official.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 294–296}} Kruger expressed great satisfaction at the new arrivals' industry and respect for the state's laws,{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 153–156}} but surmised that giving them full burgher rights might cause the Boers to be swamped by sheer weight in numbers, with the probable result of absorption into the British sphere.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 294–296}} Agonising over how he "could meet the wishes of the new population for representation, without injuring the republic or prejudicing the interests of the older burghers",{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 159–160}} he thought he had solved the problem in 1889 when he tabled a "second volksraad" in which the uitlanders would have certain matters devolved to them.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 159–160}} Most deemed this inadequate, and even Kruger's own supporters were unenthusiastic.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 159–160}}

Rhodes and other British figures often contended that there were more uitlanders in the Transvaal than Boers.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 184–187}} Kruger's administration recorded twice as many Transvaalers as uitlanders, but acknowledged that there were more uitlanders than enfranchised burghers.{{#tag:ref|Figures released by the Transvaal government in 1896 counted 150,308 Boers born in the South African Republic (including women and children), and 75,720 (mostly adult male) uitlanders, of whom 41,275 were British subjects.{{sfn|Van der Walt et al.|1951|p=509}} Estimates of the ratio between uitlanders and enfranchised burghers were often exaggerated and ranged from near-parity to ten-to-one. Kruger's government made policy on the assumption that there were roughly 30,000 burghers and 60,000 adult male uitlanders.{{sfn|Marais|1961|pp=1–2}}|group = "n"|name = "numbers"}} According to the British Liberal politician [[James Bryce, 1st Viscount Bryce|James Bryce]], most uitlanders saw the country as "virtually English" and perceived "something unreasonable or even grotesque in the control of a small body of persons whom they deemed in every way their inferiors."{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p = 307}} On 4 March 1890, when Kruger visited Johannesburg, men sang British patriotic songs, tore down and trampled on the ''vierkleur'' at the city landdrost's office, and rioted outside the house where the President was staying.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meintjes|1974|pp=161–163}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2007|p=294}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the agitators accused him of treating the uitlanders with contempt; Kruger retorted: "I have no contempt for the new population, only for people like yourself."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 161–163}} The riot was broken up by police and the [[South African Chamber of Mines|Chamber of Mines]] issued an apology, which Kruger accepted, saying only a few of the uitlanders had taken part. Few Boers were as conciliatory as Kruger; Meintjes marks this as "the point where the rift between the Transvaalers and the uitlanders began."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 161–163}}

===Early 1890s===

In mid-March 1890 Kruger met the new British High Commissioner and Governor [[Henry Loch, 1st Baron Loch|Sir Henry Brougham Loch]], Loch's legal adviser [[William Philip Schreiner]], and Rhodes, who had by now attained a dominant position in the Transvaal's mining industry and a [[royal charter]] for his [[British South Africa Company]] to [[Company rule in Rhodesia|occupy and administer]] Matabeleland and [[Mashonaland]].{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 164–165}} A group of Transvaalers planned to emigrate to Mashonaland—the so-called Bowler Trek—and Rhodes was keen to stop this lest it interfere with his own plans.{{sfn|Rotberg|1988|p = 298}} He and Loch offered to support Kruger in his plan to acquire a port at Kosi Bay and link it to the Transvaal through Swaziland if in return the Transvaal would enter a South African customs union and pledge not to expand northwards. Kruger made no commitments, thinking this union might easily turn into the federation Britain had pursued years before, but on his return to Pretoria forbade any Boer trek to Mashonaland.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 164–165}}

Rhodes became prime minister of the Cape Colony in July 1890.{{sfn|Rotberg|1988|p = 339}} A month later the British and Transvaalers agreed to joint control over Swaziland (without consulting the Swazis)—the South African Republic could build a railway through it to Kosi Bay on the condition that the Transvaal thereafter supported the interests of Rhodes's [[Chartered Company]] in Matabeleland and its environs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meredith|2007|p=243}}; {{harvnb|Meintjes|1974|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Two more conventions over Swaziland followed, the latter of which in December 1894 made it a protectorate of the South African Republic.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=180–181}}|group = "n"|name = "finalagreement"}} Kruger honoured the latter commitment in 1891 when he outlawed the Adendorff Trek, another would-be emigration to Mashonaland, over the protests of Joubert and many others. This, along with his handling of the economy and the civil service—now widely perceived as overloaded with Dutch imports—caused opposition to grow.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 166–168}} The industrial monopolies Kruger's administration granted became widely derided as corrupt and inefficient, especially the dynamite concession given to Edouard Lippert and a French consortium, which Kruger was forced to revoke in 1892 amid much scandal over misrepresentation and [[price gouging]].{{sfn|Meredith|2007|pp = 298–300}}{{#tag:ref|The same year Kruger cheerfully accepted an invitation to inaugurate a synagogue in Johannesburg.

Kruger's second volksraad sat for the first time in 1891. Any resolution it passed had to be ratified by the first volksraad; its role was in effect largely advisory. Uitlanders could vote in elections for the second volksraad after two years' residency on the condition they were [[naturalization|naturalised]] as burghers—a process requiring the renunciation of any foreign allegiance. The residency qualification for naturalised burghers to join the first volksraad electorate was raised from five to 14 years, with the added criterion that they had to be at least 40 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meredith|2007|pp=294–295}}; {{harvnb|Meintjes|1974|pp=168–171}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the close-run campaign for the [[Transvaal presidential election, 1893|1893 election]], in which Kruger was again challenged by Joubert with the Chief Justice [[John Gilbert Kotzé]] as a third candidate, the President indicated that he was prepared to lower the 14-year residency requirement so long as it would not risk the subversion of the state's independence.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 171–172}} The electoral result was announced as 7,854 votes for Kruger, 7,009 for Joubert, and 81 for Kotzé. Joubert's supporters alleged procedural irregularities and demanded a recount; the ballots were counted twice more and although the results varied slightly each time, every count gave Kruger a majority. Joubert conceded and Kruger was inaugurated for the third time on 12 May 1893.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 171–172}}

===Rising tensions: raiders and reformers===

By 1894 the Kosi Bay scheme had been abandoned and the Delagoa Bay line was almost complete, and the railways from Natal and the Cape had reached Johannesburg.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 174–176}}{{#tag:ref|Kruger allowed the British railways to enter first in return for Rhodes's help funding the Delagoa Bay line's final sections.{{sfn|Davenport|2004}}|group = "n"|name = "railwaytimings"}} Chief Malaboch's [[Malaboch War|insurgency]] in the north compelled Joubert to call up a commando and the [[Transvaalse Staatsartillerie|State Artillery]] in May 1894. Those drafted included British subjects, the large majority of whom indignantly refused to report, feeling that as foreigners they should be exempted.{{#tag:ref|The Commando Law of 1883 identified all residents as eligible for military service, but the South African Republic had since made agreements with the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Belgium and Switzerland not to draft their nationals.

Protesters waited for Kruger and Loch to enter the presidential coach at the railway station, then unharnessed the horses, attached a [[Union Jack]] and raucously dragged the carriage to Loch's hotel. Embarrassed, Loch complied with Kruger's request that he should not go on to Johannesburg.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 177–180}} Kruger announced that "the government will, in the meantime, provisionally, no more commandeer British subjects for personal military service".{{sfn|Makhura|1995|pp = 260–261}} In his memoirs, he alleged that Loch secretly conferred with the uitlanders' [[Johannesburg Reform Committee|National Union]] at this time about how long the miners could hold Johannesburg by arms without British help.{{#tag:ref|Meintjes upholds this claim, citing a letter written by the magnate [[Lionel Phillips]] on 1 July 1894 making reference to such discussions.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=177–180}}|group = "n"|name = "lochconfer"}}

[[File:Joseph Chamberlain.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Chamberlain]], the British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]]|alt=A man in a light suit with a hat in his hand]]
The following year the National Union sent Kruger a petition bearing 38,500 signatures requesting electoral reform.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 184}} Kruger dismissed all such entreaties with the assertion that enfranchising "these new-comers, these disobedient persons" might imperil the republic's independence.{{sfn|Makhura|1995|p = 266}} "Protest!" he shouted at one uitlander deputation; "What is the use of protesting? I have the guns, you haven't."{{sfn|McKenzie|Du Plessis|Bunce|1900|p = 64}} The Johannesburg press became intensely hostile to the President personally, using the term "Krugerism" to encapsulate all the republic's perceived injustices.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 184}} In August 1895, after gauging burghers' views from across the country, the first volksraad rejected the opposition's bill to give all uitlanders the vote by 14 ballots to 10.{{sfn|Makhura|1995|p = 266}} Kruger said this did not extend to those who had "proved their trustworthiness", and conferred burgher rights on all uitlanders who had served in Transvaal commandos.{{sfn|Makhura|1995|p = 266}}

The Delagoa Bay railway line was completed in December 1894—the realisation of a great personal ambition for Kruger, who tightened the final bolt of "our national railway" personally.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 180–181}} The formal opening in July 1895 was a gala affair with leading figures from all the neighbouring territories present, including Loch's successor Sir Hercules Robinson.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 180–181}} "This railway changed the whole internal situation in the Transvaal", Kruger wrote in his autobiography. "Until that time, the Cape railway had enjoyed a monopoly, so to speak, of the Johannesburg traffic."{{sfn|Kruger|1902|p = 225}} Difference of opinion between Kruger and Rhodes over the distribution of the profits from customs duties led to the [[Drifts Crisis]] of September–October 1895: the Cape Colony avoided the Transvaal railway fees by using wagons instead. Kruger's closure of the drifts ([[Ford (crossing)|fords]]) in the Vaal River where the wagons crossed prompted Rhodes to call for support from Britain on the grounds that the London Convention was being breached. The Colonial Secretary [[Joseph Chamberlain]] told Kruger if he did not reopen the drifts Britain would do so by force; Kruger backed down.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 181–182}}

[[File:Dr. Leander Starr Jameson.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Leander Starr Jameson]], leader of the eponymous [[Jameson Raid|raid]] into the Transvaal in 1895–96|alt=A man with a moustache and a dark suit]]
Understanding that renewed hostilities with Britain were now a real possibility, Kruger began to pursue armament. Relations with Germany had been warming for some time; when Leyds went there for medical treatment in late 1895, he took with him an order from the Transvaal government for rifles and munitions.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 184}}  Conferring with the Colonial Office, Rhodes pondered the co-ordination of an uitlander revolt in Johannesburg with British military intervention, and had a force of about 500 marshalled on the Bechuanaland–Transvaal frontier under [[Leander Starr Jameson]], the Chartered Company's administrator in Matabeleland.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 184–187}} On 29 December 1895, ostensibly following an urgent plea from the Johannesburg Reform Committee (as the National Union now called itself), these troops crossed the border and rode for the Witwatersrand—the [[Jameson Raid]] had begun.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|pp = 264–266}}

Jameson's force failed to cut all of the telegraph wires, allowing a rural Transvaal official to raise the alarm early, though there are suggestions Kruger had been tipped off some days before.{{#tag:ref|The President always denied such claims, but Meintjes suggests he "must have known", citing the two prior warnings Joubert received.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p=188}} The fact remains that most of the Transvaal government and citizenry were caught by surprise.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p=188}}|group = "n"|name = "priorknowledge"}} Joubert called up the burghers and rode west to meet Jameson.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 189}} Robinson publicly repudiated Jameson's actions and ordered him back, but Jameson ignored him and pushed on towards Johannesburg; Robinson wired Kruger offering to come immediately for talks. The Reform Committee's efforts to rally the uitlanders for revolt floundered, partly because not all of the mine-owners (or "[[Randlord]]s") were supportive, and by 31 December the conspirators had raised a makeshift ''vierkleur'' over their headquarters at the offices of Rhodes's [[Gold Fields]] company, signalling their capitulation. Unaware of this, Jameson continued until he was forced to surrender to Piet Cronjé on 2 January 1896.{{sfn|Davidson|1988|pp = 266–271}}

A congratulatory [[Kruger telegram|telegram]] to Kruger from Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] on 3 January prompted a storm of anti-Boer and [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German feeling]] in Britain, with Jameson becoming lionised as a result.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 190–194}} Kruger shouted down talk of the death penalty for the imprisoned Jameson or a campaign of retribution against Johannesburg, challenging his more bellicose commandants to depose him if they disagreed, and accepted Robinson's proposed mediation with alacrity.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 190–194}} After confiscating the weapons and munitions the Reform Committee had stockpiled, Kruger handed Jameson and his troops over to British custody and granted amnesty to all the Johannesburg conspirators except for 64 leading members, who were charged with high treason.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 190–194}} The four main leaders—[[Lionel Phillips]], [[John Hays Hammond]], [[Sir George Farrar, 1st Baronet|George Farrar]] and [[Frank Rhodes (British Army officer)|Frank Rhodes]] (brother of Cecil)—pleaded guilty in April 1896 and were sentenced to hang, but Kruger quickly had this commuted to fines of [[Pound sterling|£]]25,000 each.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 194–197}}

===Resurgence===
The Jameson Raid ruined Rhodes's political reputation in the Cape and lost him his longstanding support from the [[Afrikaner Bond]]; he resigned as prime minister of the Cape Colony on 12 January.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 190}} Kruger's handling of the affair made his name a household word across the world and won him much support from Afrikaners in the Cape and the Orange Free State, who began to visit Pretoria in large numbers.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 199}} The President granted personal audiences to travellers and writers such as [[Olive Schreiner]] and [[Frank Harris]],{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 199}} and wore the knightly orders of the Netherlands, Portugal, Belgium and France on his sash of state.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 205}} Jameson was jailed by the British but released after four months. The republic made armament one of its main priorities, ordering huge quantities of rifles, munitions, [[field gun]]s and [[howitzer]]s, primarily from Germany and France.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 199–200}}

[[File:Marthinus Theunis Steyn.jpg|thumb|left|upright|President [[Marthinus Theunis Steyn]] of the Orange Free State|alt=A man with an enormous dark beard wearing a sash of state]]
In March 1896 Marthinus Theunis Steyn, the young lawyer Kruger had encountered on the ship to England two decades earlier, became President of the Orange Free State.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 202}} They quickly won each other's confidence; each man's memoirs would describe the other in glowing terms.{{#tag:ref|Steyn is described in Kruger's autobiography as "one of the greatest and noblest men that have seen the light of South Africa."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p=203}} Working alongside Kruger, Steyn wrote, was "one of my greatest privileges".{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p=203}}|group = "n"|name = "memoirssteyn"}} Chamberlain began to take exception to the South African Republic's diplomatic actions, such as joining the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]], which he said breached Article IV of the London Convention (which forbade extraterritorial dealings except ''vis-a-vis'' the Orange Free State). Chamberlain asserted that the Transvaal was still under British suzerainty, a claim Kruger called "nonsensical".{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 195, 203–204}} Kruger and Steyn concluded a treaty of trade and friendship in Bloemfontein in March 1897, along with a fresh military alliance binding each republic to defend the other's independence.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 206–207}} Two months later [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Sir Alfred Milner]] became the new high commissioner and governor in Cape Town.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 207–208}}

Kruger developed a habit of threatening to resign whenever the volksraad did not give him his way. In the 1897 session there was much surprise when the new member [[Louis Botha]] reacted to the usual proffered resignation by leaping up and moving to accept it.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 209–210}} A constitutional crisis developed after the judiciary under Chief Justice Kotzé abandoned its prior stance of giving volksraad resolutions legal precedence over the constitution. "This decision would have upset the whole country", Kruger recalled, "for a number of rules concerning the goldfields, the franchise and so on depended on resolutions of the volksraad."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 208–209}} Chief Justice De Villiers of the Cape mediated, sided with Kruger and upheld the volksraad decrees.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 208–209}}{{#tag:ref|In late 1897 [[Joshua Slocum]], who was attempting to become the first to [[Around the world sailing record|sail single-handedly around the globe]], disembarked in Cape Town and was presented to Kruger in Pretoria.

Kruger was never more popular domestically than during the 1897–98 [[Transvaal presidential election, 1898|election]] campaign, and indeed was widely perceived to be jollier than he had been in years. He won his most decisive election victory yet—12,853 votes to Joubert's 2,001 and [[Schalk Willem Burger]]'s 3,753—and was sworn in as president for the fourth time on 12 May 1898. After a three-hour inauguration address, his longest speech as president, his first act of his fourth term was to sack Kotzé, who was still claiming the right to test legislation in the courts. To Kruger's critics this lent much credence to the notion that he was a tyrant.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 211–213}}  Milner called Kotzé's dismissal "the end of real justice in the Transvaal" and a step that "threatened all British subjects and interests there".{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 211–213}}{{#tag:ref|Kotzé's replacement as Chief Justice was [[Reinhold Gregorowski]].{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=211–213}}|group = "n"|name = "gregorowski"}}

Kruger's final administration was, Meintjes suggests, the strongest in the history of the republic.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 216}} He had the former Free State President F&amp;nbsp;W Reitz as State Secretary from June 1898 and Leyds, who set up an office in [[Brussels]], as [[Envoy (title)|Envoy Extraordinary]] in Europe.

===Road to war===
[[File:Lord Milner.jpg|upright|left|thumb|[[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Sir Alfred Milner]], the British [[High Commissioner for Southern Africa]]|alt=A moustachioed man in a dark three-piece suit]]
Anglo-German relations warmed during late 1898, with Berlin disavowing any interest in the Transvaal; this opened the way for Milner and Chamberlain to take a firmer line against Kruger.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 218–219}} The so-called "Edgar case" of early 1899, in which a [[South African Republic Police]]man was acquitted of [[manslaughter]] after shooting a British subject dead during an attempted arrest, prompted outcry from the British element in the Transvaal and is highlighted by Nathan as "the starting point of the final agitation which led to war."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 221–222}}

The South African League, a new uitlander movement, prepared two petitions, each with more than 20,000 signatures, that appealed to Queen Victoria for intervention against the Transvaal government, which they called inefficient, corrupt and oppressive.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 223}} Other uitlanders produced a counter-petition in which about as many affirmed their satisfaction with Kruger's government.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 223}} Attempting to address the main point of contention raised by Milner and Chamberlain, Kruger spoke of reducing the residency qualification for foreigners to nine years or perhaps less.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 223}} In May and June 1899 he and Milner met in Bloemfontein, with Steyn taking on the role of mediator. "You ''must'' make concessions on the franchise issue", Steyn counselled. "Franchise after a residence of 14 years is in conflict with the first principles of a republican and democratic government. The Free State expects you to concede&amp;nbsp;... Should you not give in on this issue, you will lose all sympathy and all your friends."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 225}} Kruger answered that he had already indicated his willingness to lower the franchise and was "prepared to do anything"—"but they must not touch my independence", he said.

[[File:El último discurso de Chamberlain, de Xaudaró.jpg|thumb|Spanish press depiction of Kruger and Chamberlain|alt=]]
Milner wanted full voting rights after five years' residence, a revised naturalisation oath and increased legislative representation for the new burghers. Kruger offered naturalisation after two years' residence and full franchise after five more (seven years, effectively) along with increased representation and a new oath similar to that of the Free State.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 226–228}} The High Commissioner declared his original request an "irreducible minimum" and said he would discuss nothing else until the franchise question was resolved.{{sfn|Kruger|1902|p = 275}} On 5 June Milner proposed an advisory council of non-burghers to represent the uitlanders, prompting Kruger to cry: "How can strangers rule my state? How is it possible!"{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 226–228}} When Milner said he did not foresee this council taking on any governing role, Kruger burst into tears, saying "It is our country you want".{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 226–228}} Milner ended the conference that evening, saying the further meetings Steyn and Kruger wanted were unnecessary.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 226–228}}

Back in Pretoria Kruger introduced a draft law to give the mining regions four more seats in each volksraad and fix a seven-year residency period for voting rights. This would not be retroactive, but up to two years' prior residence would be counted towards the seven, and uitlanders already in the country for nine years or more would get the vote immediately.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 228–230}}{{#tag:ref|Under this bill the enfranchisement of individual uitlanders would depend on conditions such as never having been "guilty of any crime against the independence of the country", and on "the personal acquaintance of the field cornets and landdrosts of the wards and districts in which they lived".{{sfn|Ash|2014|pp=120–121}} These officials would be asked to attest to the prospective voter's domicile, uninterrupted registration and obedience to the law.{{sfn|Ash|2014|pp=120–121}} Alternatively two "more than respectable" burghers could recommend an uitlander of seven years' residence for the franchise if they had both known him as long as he had lived in the country.{{sfn|Ash|2014|pp=120–121}}|group="n"|name="qualifications"}} [[Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr (Onze Jan)|Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr]] of the Afrikaner Bond persuaded Kruger to make this fully retrospective (to immediately enfranchise all white men in the country seven years or more), but Milner and the South African League deemed this insufficient.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 228–230}} After Kruger rejected the British proposal of a joint commission on the franchise law, Smuts and Reitz proposed a five-year retroactive franchise and the extension of a quarter of the volksraad seats to the Witwatersrand region, on the condition that Britain drop any claim to suzerainty.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 228–230}} Chamberlain issued an ultimatum in September 1899 in which he insisted on five years without conditions, else the British would "formulate their own proposals for a final settlement."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 230}}

Kruger resolved that war was inevitable, comparing the Boers' position to that of a man attacked by a lion with only a pocketknife for defence. "Would you be such a coward as not to defend yourself with your pocketknife?" he posited.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 228–230}} Aware of the deployment of British troops from elsewhere in the Empire, Kruger and Smuts surmised that from a military standpoint the Boers' only chance was a swift [[pre-emptive strike]]. Steyn was anxious that they not be seen as the aggressors and insisted they delay until there was absolutely no hope of peace. He informed Kruger on 9 October that he also now thought war unavoidable; that afternoon the Transvaal government handed the British envoy [[Conyngham Greene]] an ultimatum advising that if Britain did not withdraw all troops from the border within 48 hours, a state of war would exist. The British government considered the conditions impossible and informed Kruger of this on 11 October 1899.

The outbreak of war raised Kruger's international profile even further.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 232–233}} In countries antagonistic to Britain he was idolised; Kruger expressed high hopes of German, French or Russian military intervention, despite the repeated despatches from Leyds telling him this was a fantasy.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 232–233}} Kruger took no part in the fighting, partly because of his age and poor health—he turned 74 the week war broke out—but perhaps primarily to prevent his being killed or captured.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 232–233}} His personal contributions to the military campaign were mostly from his office in Pretoria, where he oversaw the war effort and advised his officers by telegram.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 232–233}} The Boer commandos, including four of Kruger's sons, six sons-in-law and 33 of his grandsons, advanced quickly into the Cape and Natal, won a series of victories and by the end of October were besieging [[Siege of Kimberley|Kimberley]], [[Siege of Ladysmith|Ladysmith]] and [[Siege of Mafeking|Mafeking]].

The British relief of Kimberley and Ladysmith in February 1900 marked the turning of the war against the Boers.{{sfn|Knight|2000|p = 35}} Morale plummeted among the commandos over the following months, with many burghers simply going home; Kruger toured the front in response and asserted that any man who deserted in this time of need should be shot.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 235–236}} He had hoped for large numbers of Cape Afrikaners to rally to the republican cause, but only small bands did so,{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 235–236}} along with a few thousand [[Boer foreign volunteers|foreign volunteers]] (principally Dutchmen, Germans and Scandinavians).{{sfn|Knight|2000|p = 11}} When British troops entered Bloemfontein on 13 March 1900 Reitz and others urged Kruger to destroy the gold mines, but he refused on the grounds that this would obstruct rehabilitation after the war.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 238–240}} Mafeking was relieved two months later and on 30 May [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|Lord Roberts]] took Johannesburg.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp = 36–37}} Kruger left Pretoria on 29 May, travelling by train to [[Machadodorp]],{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 242}} and on 2 June the government abandoned the capital. Roberts entered three days later.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp = 36–37}}

With the major towns and the railways under British control, the conventional phase of the war ended; Kruger wired Steyn pondering surrender, but the Free State President insisted they fight "to the bitter end".{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 243}} Kruger found new strength in Steyn and telegrammed all Transvaal officers forbidding the laying down of arms.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 243}} ''[[Bittereinder]]s'' ("bitter-enders") under Botha, [[Christiaan de Wet]] and [[Koos de la Rey]] took to the veld and waged a guerrilla campaign. The British under [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]] applied [[scorched earth]] policy in response, burning the farms of Boers still in the field;{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp = 39–41}} non-combatants (mostly women and children) were put into what the British Army dubbed [[concentration camp]]s.{{#tag:ref|The British commanders asserted humanitarian motives, saying the camps were meant to house Boer dependants who would otherwise roam the veld as unprotected refugees.{{sfn|Knight|2000|pp=39–41}} Kitchener considered the internment of the Boer women desirable from a tactical standpoint, arguing that they made "every farm&amp;nbsp;... an intelligence agency and a supply depot",{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=453}} and might, by their absence, induce a Boer surrender.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=453}} Separate camps housed black Africans.{{sfn|Meredith|2007|p=453}} By the end of the war over 26,000 Boer women and children had died in these overcrowded, insanitary and badly run camps from disease.&lt;ref name=camps&gt;{{harvnb|Knight|2000|p=40}}; {{harvnb|Meredith|2007|pp=9, 452–456}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group = "n"|name = "camps"}} Kruger moved to [[Waterval Onder]], where his small house became the "Krugerhof", in late June.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 244–245}} After Roberts announced the annexation of the South African Republic to the British Empire on 1 September 1900—the Free State had been annexed on 24 May—Kruger proclaimed on 3 September that this was "not recognised" and "declared null and void".{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 246}} It was decided in the following days that to prevent his capture Kruger would leave for [[Maputo|Lourenço Marques]] and there board ship for Europe. Officially he was to tour the continent, and perhaps America too, to raise support for the Boer cause.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 246–247}}{{#tag:ref|The South African Republic government continued with [[Schalk Willem Burger]] as Acting President.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=246–247}}|group = "n"|name = "burgeractingpresident"}}

==Exile and death==
[[File:Kruger's Last View of Africa.jpg|thumb|upright|Kruger leaving for Europe in 1900—he would never return. At right is his secretary Madie Bredell.|alt=Kruger viewed in silhouette from behind, Bredell to his right. Kruger is wearing his top hat.]]

Kruger left the Transvaal by rail on 11 September 1900—he wept as the train crossed into Mozambique. He planned to board the first outgoing steamer, the ''Herzog'' of the [[Deutsche Ost-Afrika Linie|German East Africa Line]], but was prevented from doing so when, at the behest of the local British Consul, the Portuguese Governor insisted that Kruger stay in port under [[house arrest]].{{#tag:ref|Kruger did not comment on this treatment by the Portuguese, but his secretary Madie Bredell noticed that he never again wore his Portuguese decoration.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp=247–250}}|group = "n"|name = "portuguese"}} About a month later [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands]] concluded a deal with Britain to extricate Kruger on a Dutch warship, [[HNLMS Gelderland (1898)|HNLMS ''Gelderland'']], and convey him through non-British waters to [[Marseille]]. Kruger was delighted to hear of this, but dismayed that Gezina, still in Pretoria, was not well enough to accompany him. ''Gelderland'' departed on 20 October 1900.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 247–250}}

He received a rapturous welcome in Marseille on 22 November—60,000 people turned out to see him disembark.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 250–252}} Accompanied by Leyds, he went on to an exuberant reception in Paris, then continued to [[Cologne]] on 1 December. Here the public greeted him with similar excitement, but Kaiser Wilhelm II refused to receive him in Berlin. Having apparently still harboured hopes of German assistance in the war, Kruger was deeply shocked. "The Kaiser has betrayed us", he told Leyds.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 252–254}} They went on to the Netherlands, which was strictly neutral and could not assist militarily, but would feel more like home. After another buoyant reception from the general public Kruger was cordially received by Wilhelmina and her family in [[The Hague]], but it soon became clear to Leyds that it embarrassed the Dutch government to have them staying in the capital. The Kruger party moved to [[Hilversum]] in April 1901.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 254–256}}

Gezina, with whom Kruger had had 16 children—nine sons, seven daughters (of whom some died young){{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 22}}—had eight sickly grandchildren transferred to her from the concentration camp at [[Krugersdorp]], where their mother had died, in July 1901. Five of the eight children died within nine days, and two weeks later Gezina also died.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 256}}{{#tag:ref|It was said by this time that the Kruger children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren together totalled over 200.{{sfn|McKenzie|Du Plessis|Bunce|1900|p=36}}|group = "n"|name = "childrengrandchildren"}} Meintjes writes that a "strange silence" enveloped Kruger thereafter.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 256}} By now partially blind and almost totally deaf, he dictated his memoirs to his secretary Hermanus Christiaan "Madie" Bredell and Pieter Grobler during the latter part of 1901,{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 256–257}} and the following year they were published.{{sfn|Kruger|1902|pp = v–vi}}{{#tag:ref|The original text was in Dutch, but the first edition of the memoirs to appear was that in German, edited by the Reverend Dr A&amp;nbsp;Schowalter. The Dutch version and an English translation by [[Alexander Teixeira de Mattos]] shortly followed.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p=18}}|group = "n"|name = "memoirs"}} Kruger and his entourage relocated in December 1901 to [[Utrecht]], where he took a comfortable villa called "Oranjelust" and was joined by his daughter Elsje Eloff and her family.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 258}}

[[File:Oranjelust - Utrecht - 20235970 - RCE.jpg|thumb|left|Oranjelust, Kruger's home in [[Utrecht]], photographed in 1963|alt=An elegant white two-storey house of European appearance, "ORANJELUST" written over the door.]]
Rhodes died in March 1902, bequeathing [[Groote Schuur]] to be the official residence for future premiers of a unified South Africa. Kruger quipped to Bredell: "Perhaps I'll be the first."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 259}} The war formally ended on 31 May 1902 with the [[Treaty of Vereeniging]]; the Boer republics became the [[Orange River Colony|Orange River]] and [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal Colonies]]. Kruger accepted it was all over only when Bredell had the flags of the South African Republic and the Orange Free State removed from outside Oranjelust two weeks later. In reply to condolences from Germany, Kruger would only say: "My grief is beyond expression."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 260}}

Kruger would not countenance the idea of returning home, partly because of personal reluctance to become a British subject again, and partly because he thought he could better serve his people by remaining in exile.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 260}} Steyn similarly refused to accept the new order and joined Kruger in Europe, though he was later to return.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 264}} Botha, De Wet and De la Rey visited Oranjelust in August 1902 and, according to hearsay, were berated by Kruger for "signing away independence"—rumours of such a scene were widespread enough that the generals issued a statement denying them.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 261}}

After passing October 1902 to May 1903 at [[Menton]] on the [[French Riviera]],{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 262}} Kruger moved back to Hilversum, then returned to Menton in October 1903. In early 1904 he moved to [[Clarens, Switzerland|Clarens]], a small village in the canton of [[Vaud]] in western Switzerland where he spent the rest of his days looking over [[Lake Geneva]] and the Alps from his balcony.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 265}} "He who wishes to create a future must not lose track of the past", he wrote in his final letter, addressed to the people of the Transvaal. "Thus; seek all that is to be found good and fair in the past, shape your ideal accordingly and try to realise that ideal for the future. It is true: much that has been built is now destroyed, damaged, levelled. But with unity of purpose and unity of strength that which has been pulled down can be built again."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 266}} After contracting pneumonia, Paul Kruger died in Clarens on 14 July 1904 at the age of 78. His Bible lay open on a table beside him.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = 267}}

Kruger's body was initially buried in The Hague, but was soon repatriated with British permission. After ceremonial [[lying in state]], he was accorded a state funeral in Pretoria on 16 December 1904, the ''vierkleur'' of the South African Republic draped over his coffin, and buried in what is now called the [[Heroes' Acre (South Africa)|Heroes' Acre]] in the Church Street Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davenport|2004}}; {{harvnb|Meintjes|1974|p=vii}}; {{harvnb|Picton-Seymour|1989|p=164}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appraisal and legacy==
[[File:Krugerstandbeeld, Kerkplein, a, Pretoria.jpg|thumb|[[Statue of Paul Kruger]] in Church Square, Pretoria|alt=An impressive monument. A statue of Kruger stands on a tall plinth; he is wearing his top hat. Each of the plinth's four sides has a statue of a crouching Boer next to it.]]

Academic opinion on Kruger is divided.{{sfn|Davenport|2004}} To admirers he was an astute reader of people, events and law who faithfully defended a maligned nation and became a tragic folk hero;{{sfn|Davenport|2004}} to critics he was "an anachronistic throwback", the stubborn, slippery guardian of an unjust cause and an oppressor of black Africans.{{sfn|Davenport|2004}} "More nonsense has been written about him than anybody I know of", writes Meintjes, in whose view the true figure has been obscured by conflicting attempts to sabotage or whitewash his image—"a veritable bog of hostility and sentiment, prejudice and deification",{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = vii–viii}} depicting Kruger as anything "from saint to stuffy mendacious savage".{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 131–134}} Rights and wrongs aside, Meintjes asserts, Kruger is the central figure of Boer history and one of the "most extraordinary" of South Africans.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = vii–viii}}

Following the [[Union of South Africa]] under Botha in 1910, Kruger remained "a vital force in South African politics and Afrikaner culture".{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p = viii}} The government wildlife reserve he had proclaimed in 1898 was expanded and dubbed [[Kruger National Park]] in 1926.{{sfn|Briggs|2012|p = 139}} In 1954, over half a century after its construction by [[Anton van Wouw]], a bronze [[Statue of Paul Kruger|statue of Kruger]] in his characteristic [[Dopper suit]] and top hat was erected in Church Square, Pretoria; Kruger stands atop a plinth surrounded by four crouching Boers from different time periods.{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 205–206}} Thirteen years later the [[South African Mint]] put his likeness on the [[Krugerrand]], a gold [[bullion coin]] still produced and exported in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weston|2012|pp=67–69}}; {{harvnb|Grendon International Research|2014}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His home in Pretoria and farm at Boekenhoutfontein are [[Provincial heritage site (South Africa)|provincial heritage sites]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|SAHRA a}}; {{harvnb|SAHRA b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the former of which is preserved to appear as in his time.{{sfn|Briggs|2012|p = 120}}

Kruger gives his name to the town of Krugersdorp,{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|p= 176}} and to many streets and squares in South Africa and other countries, especially the Netherlands and Belgium. This has, on occasion, led to controversy; in 2009 local authorities in [[St Gallen]], Switzerland renamed ''Krügerstrasse'' "because of racist associations".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neue Zürcher Zeitung|2009}}; {{harvnb|Reuters|2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clarens, Free State]] is named after Kruger's last home in Switzerland.{{sfn|Olivier|Olivier|2005|p=112}} During the Second World War Kruger's life story and image were appropriated by propagandists in [[Nazi Germany]], who produced the biographical film  ''[[Ohm Krüger]]'' ("Uncle Krüger", 1941) to attack the British, with [[Emil Jannings]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meintjes|1974|p=275}}; {{harvnb|Fox|2007|pp=166–171}}; {{harvnb|Welch|2001|pp=229–230}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The underdevelopment of [[South African administrative law]] until the late 20th century was, Davenport asserts, the direct result of Kruger's censure and dismissal of Chief Justice Kotzé in 1898 over the question of judicial review.{{sfn|Davenport|2004}}

"Paul Kruger's name and fame he made himself", Leyds said. "It is sometimes said that he was illiterate. This is of course nonsense&amp;nbsp;... He was certainly not learned, but he had a thorough knowledge of many things."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|pp = 131–134}} "In the lower spheres of diplomacy Mr Kruger was a master", E&amp;nbsp;B Iwan-Müller asserted. "He was quick in detecting the false moves made by his opponents, and an adept&lt;!--a noun--&gt; in turning them to his own advantage; but of the large combinations he was hopelessly incapable. To secure a brilliant and conspicuous success today he was ready to squander the prospects of the future, if, indeed, he had the power of forecasting them. He was what I believe soldiers would call a brilliant tactician, but a hopeless strategist."{{sfn|Iwan-Müller|1902|p = 454}} Soon after Kruger's death, Smuts told the British humanitarian campaigner [[Emily Hobhouse]]: "He typified the Boer character both in its brighter and darker aspects, and was no doubt the greatest man—both morally and intellectually—whom the Boer race has so far produced. In his iron will and tenacity, his 'never say die' attitude towards fate, his mystic faith in another world, he represented what is best in all of us."{{sfn|Meintjes|1974|loc = Epigraph}}

'''Peripatopsidae''' is one of the two living [[velvet worm]] families.&lt;ref name="OW"&gt;{{cite web|author=Oliveira, I.|author2=Hering, L.|author3=Mayer, G.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Updated Onychophora checklist|url=http://www.onychophora.com/list.htm|website=Onychophora Website|accessdate=24 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ITIS - Peripatopsidae  (Bouvier, 1907)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=154433|title=Peripatopsidae  (Bouvier, 1907)|publisher=[[Integrated Taxonomic Information System]]|accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Peripatopsidae exhibit relatively many characteristics that are perceived as original or "primitive" with respect to the [[Peripatidae]]. They have between 13 and 25 pairs of legs, behind or between the last of which is the genital opening (gonopore). Both oviparous and ovoviviparous, as well as genuinely viviparous, species exist, although the Peripatopsidae essentially lack a placenta.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Distribution==
The distribution of the Peripatopsidae is circumaustral; in particular, they inhabit [[Australasia]], [[South Africa]] and [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oliveira|first1=I.

==History==
Permindex was described as a [[holding company]] built with Canadian, Italian, Swiss, and United States [[capital (economics)|capital]].&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=William |date=September 17, 1960 |title=Rome's Trade Center—How It Came to Be |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1960/09/17/page/25/article/romes-trade-center-how-it-came-to-be |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |volume=CXIX |issue=224 |at= Sports/Finance, p. 5 |access-date=June 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1960, it had 20 [[stockholders]].&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; In 1959, former [[Prime Minister of Hungary]] [[Ferenc Nagy]], said to be the president of Permindex, outlined the group's plans to build "Europe's first international shopping centre for businessmen" within the previously unfinished [[Esposizione Universale Roma]].&lt;ref name="The Age"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ryan/&gt; Permindex occupied 400,000 square feet within the four "palaces" under a nine-year [[lease]] with another nine-year [[lease-option|option]].&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; The project was modeled after and designed to compete with the [[International Trade Mart]] in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name="The Age"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ryan/&gt; The centre opened on January 16, 1960.&lt;ref name="Design Council"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Exhibitions: Trade centre in Rome|journal=Design|year=1960|issue=133|author=Design Council|authorlink=Design Council|editor1-first=John E.|editor1-last=Blake|page=73|publisher=Design Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations==
Businessman [[Clay Shaw]], head of the International Trade Mart in New Orleans, represented the United States on the [[board of directors]] for Permindex.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holland&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holland|first=Max|title=The Lie That Linked CIA to the Kennedy Assassination|journal=Studies in Intelligence|year=2001|issue=Fall-Winter 2001; 11|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/fall_winter_2001/article02.html|accessdate=February 8, 2013|authorlink=Max Holland|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency: Center for the Study of Intelligence|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1, 1967, Shaw was arrested and charged with conspiring to [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinate President John F. Kennedy]] by New Orleans District Attorney [[Jim Garrison]].&lt;ref name=Holland/&gt; Three days later on March 4, the Italian [[left-wing]] newspaper ''Paese Sera'' published a story alleging that Shaw was linked to the CIA through his involvement in the Centro Mondiale Commerciale, a [[subsidiary]] of Permindex in which Shaw was also said to be a board member.&lt;ref name=Holland/&gt; According to ''Paese Sera'', the CMC had been a [[front organization]] developed by the CIA for transferring funds to Italy for "illegal political-espionage activities" and had attempted to [[deposition (politics)|depose]] [[France|French]] President [[Charles de Gaulle]] in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=Holland/&gt; On March 6, the newspaper printed other allegations about individuals it said were connected to Permindex, including [[Louis Bloomfield]] whom it described as "an American agent who now plays the role of a businessman from Canada (who) established secret ties in Rome with Deputies of the Christian Democrats and neo-Fascist parties."&lt;ref name=Dorril&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dorril|first=Steve|authorlink=Stephen Dorril|title=PERMINDEX: The International Trade in Disinformation|journal=Lobster|year=1983|issue=2|url=http://www.8bitmode.com/rogerdog/lobster/lobster02.pdf|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations were retold in various newspapers associated with the [[Communist party|Communist parties]] in Italy (''[[l'Unità]]''), France (''[[L'Humanité]]''), and the Soviet Union (''[[Pravda]]''), as well as leftist papers in Canada and Greece, prior to reaching the American press eight weeks later.&lt;ref name=Holland/&gt; American journalist [[Max Holland]] stated that ''Paese Sera'''s allegations connecting Shaw to the CIA eventually led to Garrison implicating the [[CIA Kennedy assassination conspiracy theory|CIA in a conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=Holland/&gt;

According to Holland, an internal investigation by the CIA's [[counterintelligence]] staff found that Clay Shaw had volunteered information to the agency's Domestic Contact Service from 1948 to 1956, but that the substance of the allegations were not true.&lt;ref name=Holland/&gt; It concluded that neither Permindex nor Centro Mondiale Commerciale were a front to channel fund to anti-communists, and that the agency had not solicited Shaw to use his relationship with CMC for [[clandestine operation|clandestine purposes]].&lt;ref name=Holland/&gt;

The '''Red Thread of Fate''' ({{zh|s=姻缘红线|zh|t=姻緣紅線|p=Yīnyuán hóngxiàn}}), also referred to as the '''Red Thread of Marriage''', and other variants, is an [[East Asia]]n belief originating from [[Chinese mythology|Chinese legend.]] According to this myth, the gods tie an invisible red cord around the ankles of those that are destined to meet one another in a certain situation or help each other in a certain way. Often, in Japanese and Korean culture, it is thought to be tied around the [[little finger]]. According to Chinese legend, the deity in charge of "the red thread" is believed to be ''[[Yue-Laou|Yuè Xià Lǎorén]]'' (月下老人), often abbreviated to ''Yuè Lǎo'' (月老), the old lunar matchmaker god, who is in charge of marriages.

The two people connected by the red thread are destined lovers, regardless of place, time, or circumstances. This magical cord may stretch or tangle, but never break. This myth is similar to the Western concept of [[soulmate]] or a destined flame.

== Folklore ==
One story featuring the red thread of fate involves a young boy.  Walking home one night, a young boy sees an old man (Yue Xia Lao) standing beneath the moonlight. The man explains to the boy that he is attached to his destined wife by a red thread. Yue Xia Lao shows the boy the young girl who is destined to be his wife. Being young and having no interest in having a wife, the young boy picks up a rock and throws it at the girl, running away. Many years later, when the boy has grown into a young man, his parents arrange a wedding for him. On the night of his wedding, his wife waits for him in their bedroom, with the traditional veil covering her face. Raising it, the man is delighted to find that his wife is one of the great beauties of his village. However, she wears an adornment on her eyebrow. He asks her why she wears it and she responds that when she was a young girl, a boy threw a rock at her that struck her, leaving a scar on her eyebrow. She self-consciously wears the adornment to cover it up. The woman is, in fact, the same young girl connected to the man by the red thread shown to him by Yue Xia Lao back in his childhood, showing that they were connected by the red thread of fate.

The '''reproductive system''' or '''genital system''' is a system of [[sex organs]] within an [[organism]] which work together for the purpose of [[sexual reproduction]]. Many non-living substances such as fluids, [[hormone]]s, and [[pheromone]]s are also important accessories to the reproductive system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://training.seer.cancer.gov/module_anatomy/unit12_1_repdt_intro.html  Introduction to the Reproductive System], Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024151454/http://training.seer.cancer.gov/module_anatomy/unit12_1_repdt_intro.html |date=October 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most [[organ system]]s, the [[sex]]es of [[sexual differentiation|differentiated]] [[species]] often have significant differences. These differences allow for a combination of genetic material between two individuals, which allows for the possibility of greater [[genes|genetic]] [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the [[offspring]].&lt;ref name=Adam&gt;[http://www.besthealth.com/besthealth/bodyguide/reftext/html/repr_sys_fin.html  Reproductive System 2001] Body Guide powered by Adam&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animals==
{{see also|Sexual reproduction#Animals}}
In mammals, the major organs of the reproductive system include the external [[genitalia]] (penis and vulva) as well as a number of internal organs, including the [[gamete]]-producing [[gonad]]s (testicles and ovaries). Diseases of the human reproductive system are very common and widespread, particularly [[Infectious disease|communicable]] [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdcnpin.org/scripts/std/std.asp#2 STD's Today] National Prevention Network, Center for Disease Control, United States Government, retrieving 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Most other [[vertebrate]] animals have generally similar reproductive systems consisting of gonads, ducts, and openings. However, there is a great diversity of physical [[adaptation]]s as well as [[Reproduction|reproductive strategies]] in every group of vertebrates.

===Vertebrates===
[[Vertebrate]] [[animal]]s all share key elements of their reproductive systems. They all have gamete-producing organs or [[gonad]]s. In females, these gonads are then connected by [[oviduct]]s to an opening to the outside of the body, typically the cloaca, but sometimes to a unique pore such as a [[vagina]] or [[intromittent organ]].

==== Humans{{anchor|Human reproductive system}} ====
{{main|Human reproductive system}}
The [[human reproductive system]] usually involves [[internal fertilization]] by [[sexual intercourse]].  During this process, the male inserts his [[erect penis]] into the [[female|female's]] [[vagina]] and [[ejaculate]]s [[semen]], which contains [[sperm]]. The sperm then travels through the vagina and cervix into the [[uterus]] or [[fallopian tube]]s for fertilization of the [[ovum]]. Upon successful [[human fertilization|fertilization]] and implantation, [[gestation]] of the [[fetus]] then occurs within the female's uterus for approximately nine months, this process is known as [[pregnancy]] in humans. Gestation ends with [[birth]], the process of birth is known as labor. Labor consists of the [[muscle]]s of the uterus contracting, the [[cervical dilation|cervix dilating]], and the baby passing out the vagina (the female genital organ). Human's babies and children are nearly helpless and require high levels of [[parental care]] for many years. One important type of parental care is the use of the [[mammary gland]]s in the female [[breast]]s to [[lactation|nurse]] the baby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/S/Sexual_Reproduction.html Sexual Reproduction in Humans.] 2006. John W. Kimball. Kimball's Biology Pages, and online textbook.&lt;/ref&gt;

The female reproductive system has two functions: The first is to produce egg cells, and the second is to protect and nourish the offspring until birth. The male reproductive system has one function, and it is to produce and deposit sperm. Humans have a high level of [[sexual differentiation]]. In addition to differences in nearly every reproductive organ, numerous differences typically occur in [[secondary sexual characteristic]]s.

=====Male=====
{{main|Male reproductive system}}
The male reproductive system is a series of organs located outside of the body and around the pelvic region of a [[male]] that contribute towards the reproduction process. The primary direct function of the male reproductive system is to provide the male sperm for fertilization of the ovum.

The major reproductive organs of the male can be grouped into three categories. The first category is sperm production and storage. Production takes place in the [[testes]] which are housed in the temperature regulating [[scrotum]], immature sperm then travel to the [[epididymis]] for development and storage. The second category are the ejaculatory fluid producing glands which include the [[seminal vesicles]], [[prostate]], and the [[vas deferens]]. The final category are those used for copulation, and deposition of the [[spermatozoa]] ([[sperm]]) within the male, these include the [[penis]], [[urethra]], [[vas deferens]], and [[Cowper's gland]].

Major secondary sexual characteristics includes: larger, more muscular stature, deepened voice, [[facial hair|facial]] and [[body hair]], broad shoulders, and development of an [[adam's apple]]. An important sexual hormone of males is [[androgen]], and particularly [[testosterone]].

The testes release a hormone that controls the development of sperm. This hormone is also responsible for the development of physical characteristics in men such as facial hair and a deep voice.

=====Female=====
{{main|Female reproductive system}}

The human female reproductive system is a series of organs primarily located inside of the body and around the [[pelvis|pelvic]] region of a [[female]] that contribute towards the [[Reproduction|reproductive]] process. The human female reproductive system contains three main parts: the [[vulva]], which leads to the vagina, the vaginal opening, to the uterus; the [[uterus]], which holds the developing fetus; and the [[Ovary|ovaries]], which produce the female's ova. The [[breast]]s are involved during the parenting stage of reproduction, but in most classifications they are not considered to be part of the female reproductive system.

The vagina meets the outside at the [[vulva]], which also includes the [[labia (genitalia)|labia]], [[clitoris]] and [[urethra]]; during intercourse this area is lubricated by mucus secreted by the [[Bartholin's glands]]. The vagina is attached to the uterus through the [[cervix]], while the uterus is attached to the ovaries via the [[fallopian tubes]]. Each ovary contains hundreds of egg cells or ova (singular ''[[ovum]]'').

Approximately [[Menstrual cycle|every 28 days]], the [[pituitary gland]] releases a [[hormone]] that stimulates some of the ova to develop and grow. One ovum is released and it passes through the fallopian tube into the uterus. Hormones produced by the ovaries prepare the uterus to receive the ovum. It sita her and awaits the sperm for fertilization to occur. When this does not occur i.e. no sperm for fertilization,  the lining of the uterus, called the [[endometrium]], and unfertilized ova are shed each cycle through the process of [[menstruation]]. If the ovum is fertilized by sperm, it attaches to the endometrium and the fetus develops.

==== Other mammals{{anchor|Mammals}} ====
{{main|Mammalian reproductive system}}
[[File:Joey in pouch.jpg|thumb|A newborn [[Joey (marsupial)|joey]] [[suckles]] from a [[teat]] found within its mother's [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]]]]
[[File:Didactic model of a mammal urogenital system-FMVZ USP-17.jpeg|thumb|[[Educational toy|Didactic model]] of a mammal urogenital system.]]
Most [[mammal]] reproductive systems are similar, however, there are some notable differences between the non-human mammals and humans. For instance, most male mammals have [[mammal penis|a penis]] which is [[Penile sheath|stored internally until erect]], and most have a penis bone or [[baculum]]. Additionally, males of most species do not remain continually [[sexually fertile]] as humans do. Like humans, most groups of mammals have descended testicles found within a scrotum, however, others have descended testicles that rest on the ventral body wall, and a few groups of mammals, such as elephants, have undescended testicles found deep within their body cavities near their [[kidney]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Werdelin L, Nilsonne A |title=The evolution of the scrotum and testicular descent in mammals: a phylogenetic view |journal=J. Theor. Biol. |volume=196 |issue=1 |pages=61–72 |date=January 1999 |pmid=9892556 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.1998.0821 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Marsupial#Reproductive system|reproductive system of marsupial]]s is unique in that the female has two vaginae, both of which open externally through one orifice but lead to different compartments within the uterus; males usually have a [[Marsupial penis|two-pronged penis]], which corresponds to the females' two vaginae. Marsupials typically develop their offspring in an external [[Pouch (marsupial)|pouch]] containing [[teat]]s to which their newborn young ([[Joey (marsupial)|joey]]s) attach themselves for post uterine development. Also, marsupials have a unique prepenial scrotum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Renfree, Marilyn |author2=Tyndale-Biscoe, C. H. |title=Reproductive physiology of marsupials |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1987 |pages= |isbn=0-521-33792-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HpjovN0vXW4C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=marsupial+scrotum }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 15mm (5/8 in) long newborn joey instinctively crawls and wriggles the several inches (15&amp;nbsp;cm), while clinging to fur, on the way to its mother's pouch.

The uterus and vagina are unique to mammals with no homologue in birds, reptiles, amphibians, or fish.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In place of the uterus the other [[vertebrate]] groups have an unmodified oviduct leading directly to a [[cloaca]], which is a shared exit-hole for gametes, [[urine]], and [[feces]]. Monotremes (i.e. [[platypus]] and [[echidna]]s), a group of egg-laying mammals, also lack a uterus and vagina, and in that respect have a reproductive system resembling that of a reptile.

=====Dogs=====
{{main|Canine reproduction}}
In domestic canines, sexual maturity (puberty) occurs between the ages of 6 to 12 months for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years of age for some large breeds.

=====Horses=====
{{main|Equine anatomy#Reproductive system}}
The mare's reproductive system is responsible for controlling gestation, birth, and lactation, as well as her estrous cycle and mating behavior. The stallion's reproductive system is responsible for his sexual behavior and secondary sex characteristics (such as a large crest).

====Birds====
{{Main|Bird anatomy#Reproductive system}}
Male and female birds have a [[cloaca]], an opening through which eggs, sperm, and wastes pass. Intercourse is performed by pressing the lips of the cloacae together, which is sometimes known as [[intromittent organ]] which is known as a phallus that is [[analogous]] to the [[mammal penis|mammals' penis]]. The female lays [[amniote|amniotic]] eggs in which the young fetus continues to develop after it leaves the female's body.  Unlike most vertebrates female birds typically have only one functional ovary and [[oviduct]].&lt;ref&gt;Ritchison. BIO 554/754 Ornithology. Eastern Kentucky University.&lt;/ref&gt; As a group, birds, like mammals, are noted for their high level of parental care.

==== Reptiles ====
{{Main|Reptiles#Reproduction}}
[[Reptiles]] are almost all [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]], and exhibit internal fertilization through the cloaca. Some reptiles lay [[egg (biology)|egg]]s while others are viviparous (animals that deliver live young). Reproductive organs are found within the cloaca of reptiles. Most male reptiles have copulatory organs, which are usually retracted or inverted and stored inside the body. In turtles and crocodilians, the male has a single median penis-like organ, while male snakes and lizards each possess a pair of penis-like organs.

[[File:Frog in frogspawn.jpg|thumb|right|A male [[common frog]] in nuptial colors waiting for more females to come in a mass of [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]]]]

==== Amphibians ====
{{main|Amphibian#Reproduction}}
Most [[amphibian]]s exhibit external fertilization of eggs, typically within the water, though some amphibians such as [[caecilian]]s have internal fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grzimek |first=B. |year=1974 |title=Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia: Volume 5 Fishes II &amp; Amphibians. |location=New York |publisher=Van Nostrand Reihnhold Co. |asin=B000HHFY52|pages=301–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; All have paired, internal gonads, connected by ducts to the cloaca.

==== Fish ====
{{main|Fish reproduction}}

[[Fish]] exhibit a wide range of different reproductive strategies. Most fish, however, are [[oviparous]] and exhibit external fertilization. In this process, females use their cloaca to release large quantities of their gametes, called [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] into the water and one or more males release "milt", a white fluid containing many sperm over the unfertilized eggs. Other species of fish are oviparous and have internal fertilization aided by pelvic or anal [[fin]]s that are modified into an [[intromittent organ]] analogous to the human penis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lookd.com/fish/reproduction.html Fish Reproduction]&lt;/ref&gt; A small portion of fish species are either viviparous or [[ovoviviparous]], and are collectively known as [[livebearer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advancedaquarist.com/issues/june2002/breeder.htm Science, Biology, and Terminology of Fish reproduction: Reproductive modes and strategies-part 1]. 2002. MARTIN MOE. THE BREEDER'S NET Online Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Fish gonads are typically pairs of either ovaries or testes. Most fish are sexually dimorphic but some species are [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] or [[unisexual]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buschgardens.org/infobooks/BonyFish/reproduction.html Bony Fish Reproduction] 2002. SeaWorld/Busch Gardens Animal Information Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invertebrates===
{{See also|Reproductive system of gastropods|Reproductive system of planarians}}

[[Invertebrate]]s have an extremely diverse array of reproductive systems, the only commonality may be that they all lay eggs. Also, aside from [[cephalopod]]s and [[arthropod]]s, nearly all other invertebrates are [[hermaphroditic]] and exhibit [[external fertilization]].

====Cephalopods====
{{main|Cephalopod#Reproduction and life cycle}}
All [[cephalopod]]s are [[sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]] and reproduce by laying [[egg (biology)|egg]]s. Most cephalopods have semi-internal fertilization, in which the male places his gametes inside the female's mantle cavity or [[pallial cavity]] to fertilize the [[Ovum|ova]] found in the female's single [[ovary]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weichtiere.at/Mollusks/Kopffuesser/haupt.html Cephalopods.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020065950/http://www.weichtiere.at/Mollusks/Kopffuesser/haupt.html |date=2007-10-20 }} The Living World of Molluscs. Robert Nordsieck.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, male cephalopods have only a single [[testicle]]. In the female of most cephalopods the [[nidamental gland]]s aid in development of the egg.

The "penis" in most unshelled male cephalopods ([[Coleoidea]]) is a long and muscular end of the gonoduct used to transfer spermatophores to a modified arm called a [[hectocotylus]]. That in turn is used to transfer the spermatophores to the female. In species where the hectocotylus is missing, the "penis" is long and able to extend beyond the mantle cavity and transfer the spermatophores directly to the female.

====Insects====
{{main|Insect reproductive system}}
Most [[insect]]s reproduce [[oviparous]]ly, i.e. by laying [[egg]]s. The eggs are produced by the female in a pair of [[ovaries]]. [[Sperm]], produced by the male in one [[testis]] or more commonly two, is transmitted to the female during [[mating]] by means of external [[genitalia]]. The sperm is stored within the female in one or more [[spermatheca]]e. At the time of [[fertilization]], the eggs travel along [[oviduct]]s to be fertilized by the sperm and are then expelled from the body ("laid"), in most cases via an [[ovipositor]].

====Arachnids====
{{main|Arachnids#Reproduction}}
{{see also|Opiliones penis}}
Arachnids may have one or two [[gonad]]s, which are located in the abdomen. The genital opening is usually located on the underside of the second abdominal segment. In most species, the male transfers sperm to the female in a package, or [[spermatophore]]. Complex courtship rituals have evolved in many arachnids to ensure the safe delivery of the sperm to the female.&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert D. Barnes |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 596–604|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arachnids usually lay yolky [[egg (biology)|eggs]], which hatch into immatures that resemble adults. Scorpions, however, are either [[ovoviviparous]] or [[viviparous]], depending on species, and bear live young.

==Plants==
{{main|Plant reproductive morphology}}
Among all living organisms, [[flower]]s, which are the reproductive structures of [[flowering plants|angiosperms]], are the most varied physically and show a correspondingly great diversity in methods of reproduction.&lt;ref name=Barr02&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barrett |first=S.C.H. |year=2002 |title=The evolution of plant sexual diversity |url=http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/barrett/pdf/schb_189.pdf |journal=Nature Reviews Genetics |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=274–284 |doi=10.1038/nrg776}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants that are not flowering plants ([[green alga]]e, [[moss]]es, [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s, [[hornworts]], [[fern]]s and [[gymnosperm]]s such as [[conifer]]s) also have complex interplays between morphological adaptation and environmental factors in their sexual reproduction. The breeding system, or how the sperm from one plant fertilizes the ovum of another, depends on the reproductive morphology, and is the single most important determinant of the genetic structure of nonclonal plant populations. [[Christian Konrad Sprengel]] (1793) studied the reproduction of flowering plants and for the first time it was understood that the [[pollination]] process involved both [[Biotic component|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] interactions.

==Fungi==
{{Main|Fungi#Reproduction}}
Fungal reproduction is complex, reflecting the differences in lifestyles and genetic makeup within this diverse kingdom of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Alexopoulos ''et al''., pp. 48–56.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that a third of all fungi reproduce using more than one method of propagation; for example, reproduction may occur in two well-differentiated stages within the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] of a species, the [[teleomorph]] and the [[anamorph]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirk ''et al''., p. 633.&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental conditions trigger genetically determined developmental states that lead to the creation of specialized structures for sexual or asexual reproduction. These structures aid reproduction by efficiently dispersing spores or spore-containing [[propagule]]s.

|sa     = [[Moses Isserles|Rema]]: [[Yoreh De'ah]] 265:12

A '''Shalom Zachar''' (also: ''Sholom Zochor'', ''Shulem Zucher'', {{lang-he|שלום זכר}}; [[translation|trans.]] ''Welcoming the male''; [[Literal translation|lit.]] ''Peace be upon the male''), is a gathering which takes place in [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] circles on the first [[Shabbat|Friday night]] after a baby boy is born. Although intended to "console" the newborn, the get-together is treated as a happy occasion.

==Sources==
The source for this practice is the ruling of the [[Moses Isserles|Rema]] in the [[Shulchan Aruch]], [[Yoreh De'ah]] 265:12:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is customary to make a festive meal on the Friday night after the birth of a baby boy. People go to the house where the baby is, to taste something [there], and this [eating] is also [considered] a [[seudat mitzvah]].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[David HaLevi Segal|Taz]], a major commentator on the Rema, finds the source for the Rema's statement in the [[Talmud]]ic tractate of [[Niddah]] (30b). Here the Talmud states that while a baby develops within the womb, "he is taught the entire Torah. However, as soon as he enters the air of this world, an angel comes and strikes him on his mouth, causing him to forget the entire Torah" (Taz, Yoreh Deah 265:13). Because the baby forgot all the Torah he learned, he is likened to a mourner. Just as people visit a mourner in his home to comfort him during the [[Shiva (Judaism)|mourning period]], people visit the home of the newborn to console him for the Torah he has forgotten.

Rabbi [[Yaakov Emden]] writes that this meal is called a ''Seudat Zachar'' (Meal of Remembrance), and is held specifically on Shabbat because that day is also connected with remembrance, as the [[Torah]] states, "Remember the Shabbat day to sanctify it" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 20:8).

The ''[[Israel Isserlin|Terumat HaDeshen]]'' and ''[[Shlomo Ganzfried|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]] Chapter 163:8'' consider the Shalom Zachar a [[Seudat mitzvah]].

==Customs==
In current practice, the Shalom Zachar is an informal, drop-in gathering which takes place after the Friday night meal. The location of the gathering is determined by where the father of the new baby spends Shabbat, since he presides over the event. Thus, a Shalom Zachar usually takes place in the home of the newborn (even if the newborn is still in the hospital), although it may also take place at the home of grandparents, in-laws, or even friends with whom the father is spending Shabbat.

Typically, mainly men and boys drop by to convey their congratulations, to have a bite to eat, to share words of Torah, and to sing songs welcoming the newborn and thanking God for the birth. If the mother is already back home with the baby, female relatives or friends will usually drop by to visit her as well.

Typical light refreshments include cake, cookies, popcorn, pretzels, nuts and seeds, soft drinks, and beer. In addition, [[chickpeas]] are customarily served because they are a round-shaped food eaten by mourners (as they symbolize the cyclical nature of life). Beer is served as it is cheap and most can afford to buy it.

A Shalom Zachar is not held when this Friday night coincides with the night of [[Yom Kippur]] or the night of the [[Passover Seder]]. Yom Kippur is a fast day, and therefore all eating and drinking is forbidden. On the night of the Passover Seder, it is forbidden to eat anything after eating the [[afikomen]], which is eaten at the end of the meal. If the Shalom Zachar falls on a Friday night during any other day of [[Passover]], [[matzah]] cakes and [[flour#Other flours|potato-flour]] cookies will be served instead of regular flour cakes and cookies.

==Brit Yitzchak==
[[Sephardic Jews]] do not hold a Shalom Zachar. Instead, their custom is to conduct a gathering called a [[Vach Nacht|Brit Yitzchak]] on the evening preceding the newborn boy's [[brit milah]].

'''Spiritual transformation''' is a fundamental change in a person's sacred or [[spirituality|spiritual]] life.

In [[psychology]], spiritual transformation is understood within the context of an individual's ''[[meaning (psychology)|meaning system]]'',&lt;ref name=silbmean&gt;
Israela Silberman (2005). [https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-4560.2005.00425.x Religion as a meaning system: Implications for the new millennium]. ''Journal of Social Issues'', v61 n4, pp641-663. {{doi|10.1111/j.1540-4560.2005.00425.x}}
&lt;/ref&gt; especially in relation to concepts of the sacred or [[Conceptions of God#The Ultimate|ultimate concern]].&lt;ref name=ucemmons&gt;Robert A. Emmons (1999). The psychology of ultimate concerns: Motivation and spirituality in personality. New York: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the fuller treatments of the concept in psychology come from [[Kenneth Pargament]] and from [[Raymond Paloutzian]]. Pargament says that "at its heart, spiritual transformation refers to a fundamental change in the place of the sacred or the character of the sacred in the life of the individual. Spiritual transformation can be understood in terms of new configurations of strivings" (p.&amp;nbsp;18).&lt;ref name=stparg&gt;Kenneth I. Pargament. (2006). The meaning of spiritual transformation. In Joan D. Koss-Chioino &amp; Philip Hefner (Eds.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=J-eLj6_hO7IC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=pargament+koss+spiritual+transformation&amp;ots=6buwBhmOTJ&amp;sig=GNnF-aX7kI83nop9iw7BnmGgbZQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pargament%20the%20meaning%20of%20spiritual%20transformation&amp;f=false Spiritual transformation and healing: Anthropological, theological, neuroscientific, and clinical perspectives]'' (pp. 10-39), Walnut Creek, CA: AltaMira Press. {{ISBN|0-7591-0867-6}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Paloutzian says that "spiritual transformation constitutes a change in the meaning system that a person holds as a basis for self-definition, the interpretation of life, and overarching purposes and ultimate concerns" (p.&amp;nbsp;334).&lt;ref name=stpaloutz&gt;
Raymond F. Paloutzian. (2005). Religious conversion and spiritual transformation: A meaning-system analysis. In Raymond F. Paloutzian &amp; Crystal L. Park (Eds.), ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=mGscSLMA_P4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA331&amp;dq=paloutzian+spiritual+transformation&amp;ots=JOgGmhk6ko&amp;sig=AIy9dNmA2LuHtDpQk2JXxVvJCdE#v=onepage&amp;q=paloutzian%20spiritual%20transformation&amp;f=false Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality]'' (pp. 331-347), New York: Guilford. {{ISBN|1-57230-922-9}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3870">'''Taotao Mo'na''', also commonly written as '''taotaomona''' or '''taotaomo'na''' ([[Chamorro language|Chamoru]] ''taotao'', "person/people" and ''mo'na'' "precede", loosely translated as "people before history" or "ancient people"), are spirits of ancient inhabitants believed to haunt the mountains and wild places of the [[Mariana Islands]], which include [[Rota (island)|Luta]], [[Saipan]], [[Tinian]] and [[Guam]], in [[Micronesia]]. Belief in Taotao Mo'na is present throughout these islands.

== Academic accounts==
With the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest of Guam in the 17th and 18th centuries, and the resultant destruction of the old way of life of the native [[Chamorros]], went also the practice of [[ancestor veneration]]. Early Spanish accounts of Chamorros did not include any mention of Taotao Mo'na. The concept of Taotao Mo'na therefore appears to have emerged during the Spanish occupation and was created by the Chamorros who "turned to the memory of their Before Time Ancestors for pride and comfort." The modern stories of Taotao Mo'na tend to be simple superstitions in which Taotao Mo'na are mischievous or monstrous, rather than the complex myths of pre-Contact Chamorros, such as the creation story of the gods [[Puntan]] and [[Fu'una]] or the Three Feats of Strength by Chief [[Gadao]].&lt;ref name=Torres&gt;Robert Tenorio Torres, {{cite web |url= http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Pre-Contact_Marianas_Folklore,_Legends,_and_Literature.pdf |title= "Pre-Contact Marianas Folklore, Legends, and Literature: A Critical Commentary" |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080910054004/http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Pre-Contact_Marianas_Folklore,_Legends,_and_Literature.pdf |archivedate= 2008-09-10 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(203&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, ''[[Micronesian Journal of the Humanities and Sciences]]'', [[University of Hawaii]], December 2003, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior of Taotao Mo'na==
Despite the modernity of most [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]]s, there is still a healthy respect for Taotao Mo'na. It is thought that if they are offended, they can cause bad influences in a particular location or towards a particular person.  Taotao Mo'na are believed to inhabit any secluded natural place on the island particularly in the south of the island. Locals and "traditional" Chamorros claim that one must request permission from the Taotao Mo'na before entering the jungle or taking fruit or wood from it. Another enduring superstition is their dislike of pregnant women. Pregnant Chamorro women are often told to use perfume to mask their scent or to wear their husband's clothing, and to stay indoors at night to keep taotaomo'na away.

Some Taotao Mo'na are described as being headless and malicious if their land is not respected, while some are said to be gentler spirits who aid local witch doctors, called suruhanas or suruhanus. Taotao Mo'na have been known to pinch, bruise, imitate voices and kidnap children for short periods of time. People also claim taotaomon'a can become attached to certain people they like, making them ill - and only a visit to a suruhana can make the spirit go away.

The Taotao Mo'na were investigated in a segment of the [[Syfy]] television show ''[[Destination Truth]]'' entitled "Guam Zombies," where they were (incorrectly)&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=1724713|title="Destination Truth" Guam Zombies/Fangalobolo}}&lt;/ref&gt; said to appear as [[zombie]]-like; however, the Taotao Mo'na are not zombies, but ancestral spirits that are said to live within banyan trees. The trees themselves are said to have moving roots that change direction every night.

"'''The Last Defender of Camelot'''" is the second segment of the twenty-fourth episode of the first season (1985–86) of the American television series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''. It was based on the [[The Last Defender of Camelot (short story)|short story of the same name]] written by [[Roger Zelazny]], and was adapted by [[George R. R. Martin]].

==Plot==
London, 1986. An elderly gentleman packs his car to go on a trip and he is accosted by three young thugs. He turns the tables on them and forces one of the thugs whose name is Tom to reveal that a woman paid them to perpetrate the attack. The old man forces Tom to take him to the woman and they enter a fortune teller's shop, where a woman is sitting in the dark. She reveals that she is [[Morgan le Fay]] of legend and that she knows the elderly man is [[Lancelot]]. [[Merlin]], she says, is hiding in a cave in [[Cornwall]] and Lancelot is planning to meet with him. She warns that Merlin is dangerous and is not to be trusted. She casts a spell that sends Lancelot and Tom to the cave entrance, where Lancelot enters alone.

Merlin questions Lancelot about the state of the world and then insists that they work together to make Merlin king. Lancelot explains that the world has changed and that kings are mere figureheads and the people elect their own leaders now. He also tries to explain the modern dangers of war but Merlin is unconvinced. Instead, he demonstrates his power by animating an empty suit of armor to make a champion. They depart and join Tom outside. Lancelot finds they are now at Stonehenge and Merlin insists upon sacrificing Tom to completely restore his magic but Lancelot intercedes and Morgan le Fay arrives.

Magically summoning his armor, Lancelot does battle with the hollow knight. Meanwhile, Morgan le Fay stops Merlin from interfering with the duel but she is mortally wounded, and Lancelot prevails against the hollow knight. Merlin then points his staff at Lancelot and attempts to destroy him but Lancelot's shield staves off the attack and Merlin's staff is destroyed. Merlin then requests that Lancelot kill him but Lancelot refuses. Merlin ages rapidly and vanishes.

As she dies in Lancelot's arms, Morgan Le Fay tells him how to return to London via a magic portal. As he and Tom approach the portal, Lancelot sees a beautiful castle in the distance decides to head there instead and Tom follows.

==Closing narration==
{{cquote|Once upon a time, there was a realm of myth and magic&amp;mdash;a high, bright dream that shimmered briefly and then was gone, leaving only memories and one ageless, weary, slightly tarnished hero who proved at last that wisdom and valor go hand in hand, on Earth, in Camelot, and...in the Twilight Zone.}}

'''Timothy E. Quill''' is an American physician specialising in [[palliative care]] at the [[University of Rochester Medical Center]] in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He is also a board member of the [[Death with Dignity National Center]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Quill was the lead plaintiff in a case that eventually reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1997, ''[[Vacco v. Quill]]'', in which the Court decided that a state law against [[physician-assisted suicide]] was [[Constitutionality|constitutional]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr Timothy E. Quill: Making choices about the end of your life|url=http://smu.edu/newsinfo/stories/quill-qa-13feb2007.asp|publisher=Southern Methodist University|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quill earned his [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] degree from [[Amherst College]] in 1971, and his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from the [[University of Rochester]] School of Medicine and Dentistry in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/people/?u=23067752 Timothy E.

She shortly thereafter decided that she wanted to kill herself rather than have a "lingering death" which doctors had told her may be a matter of weeks or months away. Quill describes in the article how he referred her to the [[Hemlock Society]] and a week later she requested barbiturates to help with "insomnia". He gave her a prescription and told her the amount required to treat both insomnia and the dose required to bring about death. Some time after getting the prescription, she said her final goodbyes to Quill and her family and took the barbiturates alone. Patricia's husband reported the death to Quill who reported the cause of death as acute leukemia but left off mention of the suicide in reporting it to the medical examiner. When interviewed by the ''New York Times'' in 1991, Quill stated that he had not helped anyone else to die before or since.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Altman|first=Lawrence K.|title=Doctor Says He Gave Patient Drug to Help Her Commit Suicide|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/07/us/doctor-says-he-gave-patient-drug-to-help-her-commit-suicide.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=7 November 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=7 March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; No charges or indictments were brought against Quill.

Quill has subsequently been active in arguing for legalization of physician-assisted suicide, including during the controversial trials of [[Jack Kevorkian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Timothy Quill, M.D.|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kevorkian/medicine/quill1.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and regarding the case of [[Terri Schiavo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quill|first=Timothy E.|title=Terri Schiavo — A Tragedy Compounded|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=April 2005|volume=352|pages=1630–1633|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp058062|accessdate=7 November 2011|doi=10.1056/NEJMp058062}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Quill has argued against the [[principle of double effect]] in bioethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critique of the Double Effect|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/death/971211.death.html|publisher=NPR All Things Considered|accessdate=7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fictional world of the [[television series]] ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and its spin-off series ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', a '''vampire''' is a unique variety of [[demon]] that can only exist on the earthly plane by inhabiting and animating a human corpse. In ''[[Fray (comics)|Fray]]'', a ''Buffy'' comic book spin-off set about a century in the future, vampires are also called '''lurks'''.

==Description==
[[Image:Vampire1992.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The vampire Amilyn in the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|non-canonical film]].]]

The vampires in the canonical Buffyverse differ greatly from those that appear in the 1992 ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' movie. The movie's vampires are able to fly, look pale but relatively human, and do not crumble to dust when killed. The canonical vampires, introduced in the [[Welcome to the Hellmouth|first episode]] of the television series, are demonic spirits that inhabit human corpses.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Lie to Me (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Lie to Me]]", Season 2 episode 7&lt;/ref&gt; 
Because of their partly human nature, vampires are considered impure by other demons who sometimes call them "blood rats".

According to [[Rupert Giles]], when the ancient race of demons called the [[Old Ones (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Old Ones]] were banished from Earth, the last one fed on a human and mixed their blood, creating the first vampire.&lt;ref name="buffypilot"&gt;"[[Welcome to the Hellmouth]]", pilot episode&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Illyria (Angel)|Illyria]], vampires existed during her time as an Old One{{mdash}}long before the rest were banished from the realm. Vampires possess all the memories and skills of their human predecessors. They also retain much of their host's personality, including any mental illnesses or emotional instabilities. For example, [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] (unlike most vampires) retained his love for his dying mother and [[Harmony Kendall|Harmony]] kept her vain, shallow [[valley girl]] personality and her love of unicorns. [[Darla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Darla]] tells the newly turned [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Liam/Angelus]] that "what we were informs what we become"; after her resurrection as a human she says that the darkness he unleashed as Angelus was always in him as a human, long before they met.

Vampires possess superhuman abilities, such as increased strength, heightened senses, and accelerated healing{{mdash}}all of which increase as they grow older or when they drink the blood of powerful supernatural creatures. They can drain animals{{mdash}}including humans{{mdash}}of their blood in a few seconds. Vampires are immortal and can live indefinitely without any signs of aging, though extremely old vampires acquire demonic features such as cloven hooves for hands, and lose their resemblance to humans. Vampires{{mdash}}except those who are skilled with powerful magic such as [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#Dracula|Count Dracula]]{{mdash}}cannot shape-shift.

Vampires in the Buffyverse live on a diet of blood, preferring fresh human blood; they can distinguish the blood of different animals by flavor, and those who do not drink human blood enjoy that of otters. They require no other food or drink, and although they can ingest it they generally find it bland. Prolonged deprivation of blood can impair a vampire's higher brain functions and they become "living skeletons",&lt;ref&gt;"[[Pangs (Buffy episode)|Pangs]]", Season 4, episode 8&lt;/ref&gt; but lack of blood will not result in a vampire's death. They do not need to breathe air{{mdash}}although they can breathe to speak or smoke{{mdash}}and they cannot pass breath on to others via CPR. They are affected by drugs, poisons, and electricity and they can be sedated and [[taser]]ed. Some vampires enjoy both alcoholic and caffeinated beverages, and tobacco.

Vampires can change at will between human appearance and a monstrous form with a pronounced [[brow ridge]], yellow eyes, and sharp teeth. They make a roaring sound when angered. In human form, they can be detected by their lack of heartbeat and lower body temperature. They do not cast reflections, although they can be photographed and filmed. They are largely immune to mind-reading,&lt;ref&gt;[[Earshot (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Earshot]]&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Willow Rosenberg]] can telepathically communicate with vampires such as Spike.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Gift (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Gift]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vampires can be killed by beheading, burning with fire or sunlight, or by penetration of the heart by a wooden object. When killed, a vampire rapidly turns to dry dust. They heal quickly from most injuries but do not regrow lost limbs (although Spike was able to use his hands when they were reattached after being amputated by a mentally disturbed Slayer) and can acquire scars. Their flesh burns in direct sunlight, and on contact with blessed objects such as [[holy water]], a [[Bible]], recently consecrated ground or a Christian cross. They can enter consecrated buildings but appear to feel ill at ease. Vampires are attracted to bright colors and are said to dislike [[garlic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[The Wish (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Wish]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Vampires cannot enter a human residence without having been invited once by a living resident; however, once given, such an invitation can only be revoked by a magic ritual. If all living residents die, vampires can enter freely. Areas open to the public and the homes of other vampires, demons, and non-humans are not protected.

To reproduce, vampires must drain a human being of most of his or her blood, then force the victim to drink some of the vampire's blood.&lt;ref name="buffypilot"/&gt; This process is known as "siring", and the vampire who does so is called a "sire". Sires often act as mentors to their 'children' and form small covens of related vampires for various purposes. Some vampires can be telepathically linked to those that they have sired.&lt;ref&gt;''Angel'' season 1 episode "[[Somnambulist (Angel)|Somnambulist]]"&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of time it takes for a new vampire to rise seems to vary; Buffy often kills vampires as they rise from their graves but other vampires rise after only a few hours. There is no explanation given for this in the series. They cannot normally reproduce sexually, but [[Jasmine (Angel)|Jasmine]] manipulates events that allow Angel and Darla to conceive a son, [[Connor (Angel)|Connor]], who has a human soul with vampire-like abilities, but none of their weaknesses or need to drink blood.

Vampires in the Buffyverse do not have human souls, but Giles in "The Harvest" says the human corpse a vampire is born into is infected with a demon soul via vampiric blood, and therefore lacks a conscience. [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] and [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]]{{mdash}}vampires who have had their human souls restored to them{{mdash}}feel remorse for their previous actions. However, soulless vampires are capable of feeling human emotions such as love, though these tend to be expressed as twisted and obsessive behavior.

Variations of vampires are seen on both ''Buffy'' and ''Angel''. In the ''Angel'' season two episode "[[Through the Looking Glass (Angel)|Through the Looking Glass]]", Angel and his team travel to a parallel world, Pylea, where he becomes a "Van-Tal" demon with green skin, spines and a bestial appearance. This form is described by Wesley as the vampire (specifically the demon that creates the vampire) in its purest form. While in this form, Angel lacks the ability to reason, possessing neither the compassion his soul gives him nor the sadism he possesses as Angelus.

The seventh season of ''Buffy'' introduces the [[Turok-Han]], an ancient species of vampire analogous to [[Neanderthal]] man.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Never Leave Me]]" Season 7 episode 9&lt;/ref&gt;  These Turok-Han, colloquially referred to as "über-vamps", are stronger and harder to kill than common vampires, can usually withstand a stake to the chest without dusting and show only minor burns when doused with holy water, but can still be killed by beheading or sunlight. The Turok-Han show very little intelligence and cannot speak.

At the end of [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight|Season Eight]], Buffy destroys the Seed of Wonder, affecting the magical world but not active demons and vampires on Earth. All new vampires sired after the Seed's destruction rise as mindless, feral creatures that [[Xander Harris]] dubs "zompires". However, at the end of [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine|Season Nine]], after rogue slayer Simone Doffler's experiment to create an ultimate vampire upon the slayers who followed her, one slayer, Vicki, has risen as a vampire after Doffler's death who exhibits the abilities of immunity to sunlight and shape shifting. During the beginning of [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten|Season Ten]], Vicki and the new breed of vampires she sired are shown to be as strong and able withstand a stake to the chest as Turok-Han, however exhibiting a new vulnerability to silver as [[werewolf|werewolves]].

==Creation==
[[Image:Vamp Dusted.JPG|left|thumb|A vampire "dusting". The writers felt that having vampires disintegrate after death would be convenient for the story.]]
The idea of the "vamp faces" — to have vampires' human features distort to become more demonic — was implemented because Whedon wanted to have high school students that the other characters could interact with normally. these would turn out be vampires, creating a sense of paranoia.&lt;ref name="Welcomecomm"/&gt; He also wanted to make the vampires look demonic, stating, "I didn't think I really wanted to put a show on the air about a high school girl who was stabbing normal-looking people in the heart. I thought somehow that might send the wrong message, but when they are clearly monsters, it takes it to a level of fantasy that is safer."

In early episodes, the vampires appeared "very white-faced, very creepy, very ghoulish". This was changed in later seasons to make the vampires look more human because of the sympathetic vampire character Angel and because elaborate make-up was time-consuming. Whedon said that people thought the white faces were "funny looking" but found it creepy, comparing it to the monsters in zombie movies such as ''[[Day of the Dead (1985 film)|Day of the Dead]]'' and ''[[The Evil Dead]]''.&lt;ref name=Welcomecomm&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Joss Whedon]]|title=Commentary for [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] episode "[[Welcome to the Hellmouth]]"|medium=DVD (Region 2)|location=United States|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of the [[Master (Buffyverse)|Master]] was designed to be in permanent vamp face to highlight his age and make him appear animalistic. Make-up artist John Vulich based the Master's appearance on a bat, saying that the character has devolved to a more primal, demonic state over the years.&lt;ref name=Harvestcomm&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Joss Whedon]]|title=Commentary for [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]] episode "[[The Harvest (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Harvest]]"|medium=DVD (Region 2)|location=United States|publisher=[[20th Century Fox]]|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was decided that vampires and their clothes would turn to dust after they died. The introduction to one episode, "[[The Wish (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Wish]]", parodied this vampiric trait; when Buffy kills a non-humanoid demon, Willow wonders why the demon corpse "doesn't go poof" and must be buried. Joss Whedon had the vampires explode into dust because it was practical, it demonstrates that they are monsters, he did not want a high school girl killing bad guys every episode and have them clean up bodies for 20 minutes, and it also "looks really cool".{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In the first episode, vampires' clothes reflect the era in which they died. Joss Whedon felt this concept was a "charming notion" but rejected it because he believed that if every vampire in the show were dressed in old-fashioned clothes they would cease to be scary.&lt;ref name=Welcomecomm/&gt;

When creating the vampire "rules" that they would use in the show, the writers used elements from existing vampire lore. They decided the vampires would not fly as in the ''Buffy'' movie because they could not make flying vampires look convincing on a television budget. Garlic is mentioned or used as vampire repellent in a few episodes, but its effect on vampires is never stated. Some established rules, such as a vampire's inability to enter a home uninvited, both helped and hindered the storytelling. Whedon said that whereas shows such as ''[[The X-Files]]'' spend time explaining the science behind the supernatural and making it as real as possible, ''Buffy'' and ''Angel'' are more concerned with the emotion resulting from these creatures and events than justifying how they could conceivably exist. The shows therefore tend to gloss over the details of vampire and demon lore, simply using the Hellmouth as a [[MacGuffin|plot device]] to explain unexplainable things.&lt;ref name=Harvestcomm/&gt;
