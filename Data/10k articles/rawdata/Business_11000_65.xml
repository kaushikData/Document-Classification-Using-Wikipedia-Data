      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5632">In [[marketing]], '''abandonment rate''' is a term associated with the use of virtual [[Shopping cart software|shopping carts]]. Also known as "shopping cart abandonment". Although shoppers in [[brick and mortar]] stores rarely abandon their carts, abandonment of virtual shopping carts is quite common. Marketers can count how many of the shopping carts used in a specified period result in completed sales versus how many are abandoned. The abandonment rate is the ratio of the number of abandoned shopping carts to the number of initiated transactions&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics&gt;Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). ''Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance.'' Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|0-13-705829-2}}. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in ''Marketing Metrics'' as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt; or to the number of completed transactions.&lt;ref name=AMA&gt;[[American Marketing Association]] Dictionary. {{cite web|url=http://www.marketingpower.com/_layouts/Dictionary.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121033809/http://www.marketingpower.com/_layouts/dictionary.aspx |archivedate=2012-11-21 }}. Retrieved 2012-11-29. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses this definition as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt; The typical shopping cart abandonment rate for online retailers varies between 60% and 80%, with an average of 67.91%.&lt;ref&gt;Baymard Institute. http://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate Retrieved 2014-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
There are various reasons behind the high cart abandonment rate. In general, these reasons can be categorized as different risks that affect the user's decision to ultimately complete the purchase. Below are reasons that were identified in an empirical study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kukar-Kinney|first=Monika|last2=Close|first2=Angeline G.|date=2010-04-01|title=The determinants of consumers’ online shopping cart abandonment|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11747-009-0141-5|journal=Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science|language=en|volume=38|issue=2|pages=240–250|doi=10.1007/s11747-009-0141-5|issn=0092-0703}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Complicated checkout process.
* Hidden prices that come out at the time of checkout like taxes or high shipping charge.
* Tough or lengthy registration process. No option to check out without signing up.
* Limited payment options.
* Decision to purchase from a land-based store (as opposed to online)
* Entertainment value (e.g. placing items for fun or because of boredom)
* Utilization as a research and organization tool
* Desire to wait for a lower/sale price
* Privacy/security concerns
* Non-delivery fear (e.g. product is lost in delivery)
* Difference in product description versus actual product

Another problem is that people have too many [[password]]s. A [[MasterCard]] and [[University of Oxford]] study in 2017 showed about a third of purchases were not made because the person could not remember a password.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/article156636084.html|title=Forgot your password? You have too many and stores are losing business over it|last=Johnson|first=Tim|work=[[Kansas City Star]]|date=June 16, 2017|accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
As a result, there are some implications that can be applied to online retails.
* Organizational use of cart
** Users often abandonment not because of dissatisfaction but as an organizational method. Even abandoned carts serve as a source of useful information for both consumers and retailers. Retailers can collect interest info of shopper's and use that information to better present purchases and improve throughput in the future. 
* Entertainment Value
** Consumers who use carts for fun or to alleviate boredom may still spread positive words about the online retailer and their experience, despite not completing the purchase.
* Concerns about price and overall cost
** Concerns about cost may not necessarily equate a lost sale, but rather an opportunity to make the sale in the future by offering a discount reminder whenever possible. A flat shipping rate may also positively influence the throughput versus a variable rate. Users will be more inclined to purchase more in one sitting as they no longer fear the need to pay excessive shipping.

==Purpose==
Abandonment rate as a marketing metric which helps marketers to understand website user behavior. Specifically, abandonment rate is defined as "the percentage of shopping carts that are abandoned" prior to the completion of the purchase.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;  This information is generally not used on a facility reservation report.

==Construction==
As an example, an online comics retailer found that of the 25,000 customers who loaded items into their electronic baskets, only 5,000 actually purchased:
* Purchases not completed = purchases initiated less purchases completed = 25,000 − 5,000 = 20,000.
* Abandonment rate = Not completed / Customer Initiation = 20,000 / 25,000 = 80% abandonment rate.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

'''Ayrton Senna da Silva''' ({{IPA-pt|aˈiʁtõ ˈsẽnɐ dɐ ˈsiwvɐ|br|ayrton senna da silva.ogg}}; 21 March 1960 – 1 May 1994) was a Brazilian [[racing driver]] who won three [[Formula One]] [[List of Formula One World Drivers' Champions|world championships]] for [[McLaren]] in [[1988 Formula One season|1988]], [[1990 Formula One season|1990]] and [[1991 Formula One season|1991]], and is widely regarded as one of the greatest Formula One drivers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/89217406|title=Alonso, Massa, Schumacher say Senna is "greatest" on Top Gear}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/formula1/20324109|title=Murray Walker lists Senna as number one}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/ayrton-senna-brazilian-takes-his-place-among-our-10-best-f1-drivers-9206007.html#gallery|title=Ayrton Senna: Brazilian takes his place among our 10 best F1 drivers}}&lt;/ref&gt; He [[Death of Ayrton Senna|died in an accident]] while leading the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix]] for [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-ayrton-senna-1433227.html|title=Obituary: Ayrton Senna|date=2 May 1994|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senna began his motorsport career in [[karting]], moved up to [[Open wheel car|open-wheel]] racing in 1981, and won the [[1983 British Formula Three Championship]]. He made his Formula One debut with [[Toleman|Toleman-Hart]] in [[1984 Formula One season|1984]], before moving to [[Team Lotus|Lotus-Renault]] the [[1985 Formula One season|following year]] and winning six Grands Prix over the next three seasons. In [[1988 Formula One season|1988]], he joined Frenchman [[Alain Prost]] at [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]]-[[Honda Racing F1|Honda]]. Between them, they won all but one of the 16 Grands Prix that year, and Senna claimed his first [[Formula One World Championship|World Championship]]. Prost claimed the championship in 1989, and Senna his second and third championships in [[1990 Formula One season|1990]] and [[1991 Formula One season|1991]]. In [[1992 Formula One season|1992]], the [[WilliamsF1|Williams]]-[[Renault F1|Renault]] combination began to dominate Formula One. Senna nonetheless managed to finish the [[1993 Formula One season|1993 season]] as runner-up, winning five races and negotiating a move to Williams in [[1994 Formula One season|1994]].

Senna has often been voted as the best and most influential &lt;!-- The point of whether or not he is "one" of the greatest drivers in history, already has been cited in the first paragraph. Therefore is redundant. The title as "greatest" is consensus of the polls, and fellow drivers themselves. Including Alonso and Schumacher. This text does not define him as the greatest. Only that he has been named often as mentioned. Numbers are not needed.--&gt; Formula One driver of all time in various motorsport polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://f1greatestdrivers.autosport.com/?driver=1 |title=Formula 1's Greatest Drivers – AUTOSPORT.com – Ayrton Senna |publisher=F1greatestdrivers.autosport.com |date= |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/80517 |title=Drivers vote Senna the greatest ever – F1 news |publisher=Autosport.Com |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/sports/alonso-voted-best-driver-news-news-khxqOjgjchi.html |title=Alonso voted best driver |publisher=Sify.com |date=23 July 2010 |accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbctop20"&gt;{{cite web|last=talent|first=Formula|title=Formula 1's greatest drivers.

He was also acclaimed for his wet weather performances, such as the [[1984 Monaco Grand Prix]], the [[1985 Portuguese Grand Prix]], and the [[1993 European Grand Prix]]. He holds a record six victories at the [[Monaco Grand Prix]], and is the fifth-most successful driver of all time in terms of [[Most Grand Prix wins|race wins]]. Senna courted controversy throughout his career, particularly during his turbulent rivalry with Prost. In the Japanese Grands Prix of [[1989 Japanese Grand Prix|1989]] and [[1990 Japanese Grand Prix|1990]], each of which decided the championship of that year, collisions between Senna and Prost determined the eventual winner.

== Early life and career ==
[[File:Ayrton_Senna_-_3_Years_Old.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Senna at age 3.]]
Senna was born in the Pro-Matre Maternity Hospital of [[Santana (São Paulo)|Santana]], a neighbourhood of [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://senna.globo.com/institutoayrtonsenna/br/noticias_interna.asp?cod_Noticia=128 |title=Gafisa presta homenagem a Ayrton Senna: "morador ilustre a gente não esquece" |publisher=Senna.globo.com |accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle child of wealthy Brazilian landowner and factory owner Milton da Silva and his wife Neide Senna da Silva, he had an older sister, Viviane and a younger brother, Leonardo.&lt;ref name=champion&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayrton Senna: Tragic Hero|url=http://www.f1-grandprixhistory.net/Senna.html#Introduction|publisher=History and Legends of Grand Prix Racing|accessdate=30 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001080432/http://www.f1-grandprixhistory.net/Senna.html#Introduction|archivedate=1 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[left-handedness|left-handed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Do left-handers make better drivers?|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/262406-do-left-handers-make-better-drivers|publisher=Metro|date=12 August 2008|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house where Senna spent the first four years of his life belonged to Neide's father, João Senna. It was located on the corner of Avenida Aviador Guilherme with Avenida Gil Santos Dumont, less than 100 meters from Campo de Marte, a large area where they operated the Aeronautics Material park and an airport. Senna was highly athletic, excelling in gymnastics and other sports, and developed an interest in cars and motor racing at the age of four. He also suffered from poor motor coordination and had trouble climbing stairways by the age of three. An [[electroencephalogram]] (EEG) found that Senna was not suffering from any problems. His parents gave Senna the [[nickname]] "Beco".&lt;ref name=child&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Richard|title=The Death of Ayrton Senna|year=2010 |origyear=1995|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of seven, Senna first learned to drive a Jeep around his family's farm and gained the advantage of changing gears without the use of a clutch.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|title=Formula One: The Story of Grand Prix Racing|last=Kapadia|first=Behram|year=2004|publisher=Silverdale Books|isbn=1-85605-899-9|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senna attended Colegio Rio Branco in the São Paulo neighbourhood of [[Higienópolis]] and graduated in 1977 with a grade 5 in physics along with other grades in mathematics, chemistry, and English. He later enrolled in a college that specialised in business administration, but dropped out after three months.&lt;ref name=veja&gt;{{cite web|title=100 years in 34|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/especiais/extras/fechado/senna04.html|publisher=Veja|date=3 May 1994|accessdate=24 August 2012|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, his grades amounted up to 68%.&lt;ref name=child /&gt;

[[File:Ayrton Senna Karting.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Senna began racing [[go-kart]]s in Brazil at the age of 13.]]
Senna's first kart was built by his father using a small 1-[[Horsepower|HP]] lawnmower engine. Senna started racing at [[Autódromo José Carlos Pace|Interlagos]] and entered a [[karting]] competition at the age of 13.&lt;ref name=video&gt;"Ayrton Senna – The Right to Win (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; He started his first race on pole position, facing rivals who were some years older than him; despite this, he managed to lead most of the race before retiring after colliding with a rival. His father supported his son and Lucio Pascal Gascon soon managed the developing talent.&lt;ref&gt;''Ayrton Senna: Racing in My Blood, Official Video Biography'' (Kultur Video, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

Senna went on to win the South American Kart Championship in 1977. He contested the [[Karting World Championship]] each year from 1978 to 1982, finishing runner-up in 1979 and 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsportsetc.com/info/senna.htm|title=Ayrton Senna – Racing Career|publisher=MotorSports Etc}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, he was the teammate of [[Terry Fullerton]], from whom Senna later felt was the rival he got the most satisfaction racing against also because of the lack of money and politics at that level.&lt;ref name=asenna&gt;{{cite news|last=Calkin|first=Jessamy|title=Senna: the driver who lit up Formula One|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/8524259/Senna-the-driver-who-lit-up-Formula-One.html|publisher=The Telegraph|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=15 August 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Senna moved to England to begin [[Open wheel car|single-seater]] racing, winning the [[RAC plc|RAC]] and [[Townsend Thoreson|Townsend-Thoreson]] [[Formula Ford]] 1600 Championships that year with the [[Van Diemen]] team.

[[File:Ayrton Senna Beginning - Formula Ford 1981, Van Diemen.jpg|thumb|right|200px|21-year old Senna in his British Formula Ford 1600 single seater.]]
Despite this, Senna initially did not believe he would continue in motorsport. At the end of that season, under pressure from his parents to take up a role in the family business, Senna announced his retirement from Formula Ford and returned to Brazil.&lt;ref name=child /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilton 1999 pp. 38–40&lt;/ref&gt; Before leaving England, however, Senna was offered a drive with a Formula Ford 2000 team for £10,000. Back in Brazil, he decided to take this offer and returned to live in England. As da Silva is the most common [[Brazilian name|Brazilian surname]], he instead adopted his mother's maiden name, Senna.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton (2005), pp. 9, 33–43, 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Senna went on to win the 1982 British and European Formula Ford 2000 championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=From the Vault: F1 is robbed one of its most dazzling talents|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/apr/30/formulaone|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=30 April 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080505113059/http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/apr/30/formulaone| archivedate= 5 May 2008 | deadurl= no| date=30 April 2008| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that season, Senna arrived with sponsorship from Banerj and Pool.&lt;ref name=child /&gt;

In [[1983 British Formula Three season|1983]], Senna drove in the [[British Formula 3 International Series|British Formula Three Championship]] for the [[West Surrey Racing]] team. He dominated the first half of the season until [[Martin Brundle]], driving a similar car for [[Jordan Grand Prix#Early history|Eddie Jordan Racing]], closed the gap in the second part of the championship. Senna won the title at the final round after a closely fought and, at times, acrimonious battle with the Briton.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, Christopher, ''Ayrton Senna&amp;nbsp;– The Complete Story'' (2004), pp. 99–116.&lt;/ref&gt; In November that year, Senna also triumphed at the inaugural [[Macau Grand Prix|Macau Formula 3 Grand Prix]] with [[Teddy Yip (businessman)|Teddy Yip]]'s [[Toyota]]-powered [[Theodore Racing Team]].&lt;ref&gt;Hilton (2005), pp. 43–47, 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Greg Girard]], Ian Lambot, and Philip Newsome, ''Macau Grand Prix: The Road To Success'' (Watermark Surrey, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Senna tested for Formula One teams [[WilliamsF1|Williams]], [[McLaren (racing)|McLaren]], [[Brabham]], and [[Toleman]]. [[Peter Warr]] of [[Team Lotus|Lotus]], [[Ron Dennis]] of McLaren, and [[Bernie Ecclestone]] of Brabham made offers for testing in 1984 and presented long-term contracts that tied Senna to driving later on. During his test for Williams at the 3.149-km (1.957-mi) [[Donington Park]] circuit, Senna completed 40 laps and was quicker than the other drivers, including Williams's reigning World Champion [[Keke Rosberg]].&lt;ref name=senna&gt;

Neither Williams nor McLaren had a vacancy for the [[1984 Formula One season|1984 season]].&lt;ref name=senna/&gt; Both Williams boss [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] and McLaren boss Ron Dennis noted that Senna insisted that he got to run their cars before anyone else (other than their regular drivers such as Rosberg) so that he would have the best chance of a good showing by having a fresh car.

Peter Warr actually wanted to replace [[Nigel Mansell]] with Senna at Lotus, but their British-based title sponsor, [[Imperial Tobacco]] ([[John Player &amp; Sons]]), wanted a British driver. Senna, however, was determined to drive that season and certainly on his own terms. Senna's test for Brabham occurred at [[Circuit Paul Ricard]] in November 1983, Senna impressed the Brabham team and was linked to their second seat. However, the team's main sponsor, Italian dairy company [[Parmalat]], wanted an Italian driver. Brabham's second car was eventually shared by brothers [[Teo Fabi|Teo]] and [[Corrado Fabi]], while Piquet convinced Ecclestone to sign his friend [[Roberto Moreno]] as the test driver.&lt;ref&gt;

During 1984, Senna hired Nuno Cobra to assess his physical condition. Senna had been worried about his condition due to low weight.&lt;ref name=video/&gt;

Senna made his debut at the [[1984 Brazilian Grand Prix]] in [[Autódromo Internacional Nelson Piquet|Rio de Janeiro]], where he qualified 17th, but had the dubious honour of being the first retirement of the season when the [[Hart (racing)|Hart 415T]] engine blew its turbo on lap 8. He scored his first [[List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems|World Championship point]] in his second race at the [[1984 South African Grand Prix|South African Grand Prix]] at [[Kyalami]] with severe muscle spasms, replicating that result two weeks later at the [[1984 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]].

A combination of tyre issues and a fuel-pressure problem resulted in his failure to qualify for the [[1984 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]], the only time this happened during his career. Toleman decided not to run both cars during Friday qualifying at [[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari|Imola]] due to a dispute with tyre supplier [[Pirelli]] (Toleman were in the process of switching from Pirelli to [[Michelin]]). Senna then suffered a fuel-pressure problem in the wet Saturday session at Tosa (the furthest point on the circuit from the pits) and did not have enough time for it to be fixed to allow him to make the grid.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton (2004), p 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Senna's best result of the season came at the [[1984 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]], the first wet-weather race of the season. Qualifying 13th on the grid, he made steady progress in climbing through the field, passing [[Niki Lauda]] for second on lap 19. He quickly began to cut the gap to race leader [[Alain Prost]], but before he could attack Prost, the race was stopped on lap 31 for safety reasons, as the rain had grown even heavier. At the time the race was stopped, Senna was catching Prost by about 4 seconds per lap (while the [[Tyrrell 012|Tyrrell]]-[[Cosworth DFV|Ford]] of [[Stefan Bellof]] was catching both at the same rate, although he was later disqualified due to weight restrictions broken by Tyrrell).&lt;ref&gt;Mark Hughes and Simon Arron, ''The Complete Book of Formula One'' (Motorbooks International, 2003), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

Renowned throughout his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long before the advent of telemetry, this characteristic  led Senna's first F1 race engineer, [[Pat Symonds]], to regard the [[1984 Dallas Grand Prix|US Grand Prix]] in Dallas as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of the more popular Monaco, where Senna and Toleman scored their first podium finish. This is by reference to the following recollection given by Symonds in an interview in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vasconcelos|first=Luis|title=Pat Symonds remembers Senna: Ayrton moved the goal posts!|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft27905.html=Grandprix.com|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=10 October 2014}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said "I'm sure that the wall moved!" and even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him, after the race, to have a look at the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened – we could see it from the tyre marks – was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when I saw what had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Eröffnungsrennen 1984-05-12.jpg|thumb|left|Senna won the [[saloon (automobile)|saloon]] exhibition race to celebrate the opening of the new [[Nürburgring]] in 1984.]] 
That season, Senna took two more podium finishes—third at the [[1984 British Grand Prix|British]] and [[1984 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese]] Grands Prix—and placed 9th in the Drivers' Championship with 13 points overall. He did not take part in the [[1984 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] after he was suspended by Toleman for being in breach of his contract by signing for [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] for 1985 without informing the Toleman team first.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton (2004), pp. 149–152.&lt;/ref&gt; Senna became the first driver Lotus had signed not personally chosen by team founder [[Colin Chapman]], who had died in 1982.

Senna also raced in two high-profile non-Formula One races in 1984: the [[1984 1000 km of Nürburgring|ADAC 1000-km Nürburgring]] where, alongside [[Henri Pescarolo]] and [[Stefan Johansson]], he co-drove a [[Joest Racing]] [[Porsche 956]] to finish 8th, as well as an exhibition race to celebrate the opening of the new [[Nürburgring]] before the [[1984 European Grand Prix|European Grand Prix]]. Notably, this race involved several past and present Formula 1 drivers, including [[Stirling Moss]] and past World Champions [[Jack Brabham]], [[Denny Hulme]] and [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]], driving identical [[Mercedes-Benz W201#190 E 2.3-16 &amp; 2.5-16 "Cosworth"|Mercedes 190E 2.3–16]] sports cars. [[Alain Prost]] started from pole position, but Senna took the lead in the first corner of the first lap, winning ahead of [[Niki Lauda]] and [[Carlos Reutemann]].&lt;ref name="1000kmNürburgring"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsrp.ic.cz/wsc1984.html#4 |title=FIA World Endurance Championship 1984 |publisher=wsrp.ic.cz |accessdate=14 January 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230194431/http://wsrp.ic.cz/wsc1984.html |archivedate=30 December 2006 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the race, Senna was quoted as saying, "Now I know I can do it."&lt;ref&gt;Hilton (2004), p 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Senna was a last-minute inclusion in the Mercedes race, taking over from [[Emerson Fittipaldi]].

===Lotus (1985–1987)===
;1985
[[File:1985 European GP Senna.jpg|thumb|Senna driving the [[Team Lotus]] [[Lotus 97T|97T]] at the [[1985 European Grand Prix]].]]
Senna was partnered in his first year at [[Team Lotus|Lotus-Renault]] by Italian driver [[Elio de Angelis]]. At the second round of the season, the [[1985 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portuguese Grand Prix]], Senna took the first pole position of his Formula 1 career. He converted it into his first victory in the race, which was held in very wet conditions, winning by over a minute from [[Michele Alboreto]]&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Collings and Sarah Edworthy, ''The Formula One Years: A Season-by-Season Account of the World's Premier Motor Racing Championship from 1950 to the Present Day'' (Carlton Books, 2002), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; and lapping everyone up to and including 3rd placed [[Patrick Tambay]]. The race was the first 'Grand Slam' of Senna's career, as he also set the fastest lap of the race.

He would not finish in the points again until coming second at the [[1985 Austrian Grand Prix|Austrian Grand Prix]], despite taking pole three more times in the intervening period. (His determination to take pole at the [[1985 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]] had infuriated Alboreto and Niki Lauda; Senna had set a fast time early and was accused of deliberately baulking the other drivers by running more laps than necessary, a charge he rejected, though the accusations would continue in [[1985 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]] when drivers accused him of running on the racing line when on his slow down lap forcing others on qualifiers to move off line and lose time).&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Maurice (ed.) (1985) ''Autocourse 1985&amp;nbsp;– 1986'' Hazleton publishing pp.74 &amp; 104 {{ISBN|0-905138-38-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two more podiums followed in [[1985 Dutch Grand Prix|the Netherlands]] and [[1985 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]], before Senna added his second victory, again in wet conditions, at the [[Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps]] in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton (2004), p 427&lt;/ref&gt; Senna's relationship with De Angelis soured over the season, as both drivers demanded top driver status within Lotus and, after spending six years at the team, De Angelis departed for Brabham at the end of the year, convinced that Lotus were becoming focused around the Brazilian.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton (2004), p 163&lt;/ref&gt;  Senna and De Angelis finished the season 4th and 5th respectively in the driver rankings, separated by five points in the quick but unreliable [[Lotus 97T|97T]]. In terms of qualifying, however, Senna had begun to establish himself as the quickest in the field: his tally of seven poles that season was far more than that of any of the other drivers (Renault's [[V6 engine|V6]] qualifying engines were reported to be producing over {{Convert|1000|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mansell after Grand Prix mark|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4h1NAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mDQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1280,421147&amp;dq=ayrton+senna&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Rome News-Tribune|date=3 November 1985|page=15B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1986
[[File:Senna Brands 1986.jpg|thumb|Senna driving the [[Lotus 98T]] at the [[1986 British Grand Prix]].]]
De Angelis was replaced at Lotus by [[Scotland]]'s [[Johnny Dumfries]] after Senna vetoed Derek Warwick from joining the team, saying that Lotus could not run competitive cars for two top drivers at the same time. Senna allegedly pushed for his former flatmate and fellow Brazilian [[Maurício Gugelmin]] to join the team as a pure number two driver, but the team's major sponsor [[John Player &amp; Sons]] (JPS) insisted on a British driver which led to the signing of Dumfries. Senna later admitted "It was bad, bad. Until then I had a good relationship with Derek."&lt;ref&gt;Hilton (2004), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Senna started the season well, coming second in [[1986 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]] behind the [[Williams FW11|Williams]]-[[Honda F1|Honda]] of Nelson Piquet, and winning the [[1986 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]] by just 0.014s from Piquet's teammate Nigel Mansell in one of the closest finishes in Formula One history to find himself leading the World Championship after two races.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton (2004), p 428&lt;/ref&gt; However, poor reliability, particularly in the second half of the season, saw him drift behind the Williams pairing of Mansell and Piquet, as well as defending and eventual champion, Alain Prost. Nonetheless, Senna was once more the top qualifier with eight poles, with a further six podium finishes included another win at the [[1986 Detroit Grand Prix|Detroit Grand Prix]], thus finishing the season fourth in the driver's standings again, with a total of 55 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayrton Senna, Lotus 98T|url=http://www.thomsonstudio.com/node/62|publisher=Thomson Studio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning the [[1986 Detroit Grand Prix|Detroit Grand Prix]] – which took place one day after Brazil was eliminated from the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] – Senna asked a trackside supporter for the [[Brazilian flag]] and he drove one lap waving it. Thereafter, he repeated this ritual every time he won a race.&lt;ref name=asenna /&gt; Senna also had a brief foray into rallying where he tried out a [[Vauxhall Nova]], a [[Austin Metro|MG Metro 6R4]], a [[Ford Sierra RS Cosworth]] and a [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] on a stretch of land closed to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrc.com/news/features-archive/senna-%A1piloto-de-rallye/?fid=14986 |title=Senna: The rally driver!|publisher=wrc.com|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1987
[[File:Lotus 99T front-left 2012 Autosport International.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Lotus 99T]] raced by Senna in {{F1|1987}}.]]
[[Team Lotus]] had a new engine deal in 1987, running the same turbocharged Honda V6 engines as Williams had used to win the previous year's Constructors' Championship, and with them came a new teammate, 34-year-old Japanese driver, [[Satoru Nakajima]]. The team guaranteed Senna contractually preferential treatment over Nakajima in the allocation of equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Fábio Seixas: [http://fabioseixas.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2013/07/10/o-contrato-de-senna-em-1987/ ''O contrato de Senna em 1987''], ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'', 10 July 2013, retrieved 13 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Senna started the season with mixed fortunes: a podium at the [[1987 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]] was tempered by controversy at the following [[1987 Belgian Grand Prix|race]] at Spa-Francorchamps, where he collided with Mansell, and afterward in the pits an angered Englishman grabbed Senna by the throat and had to be restrained by Lotus mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-testy-times-for-senna-and-schumacher-1533774.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Motor Racing: Testy times for Senna and Schumacher | date=17 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hilton (2004), p 432&lt;/ref&gt; Senna then won two races in a row, which helped him take the lead in the World Championship: the ensuing [[1987 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]] (the first of his record six victories at the [[Monaco|Principality]]) and the [[1987 Detroit Grand Prix|Detroit Grand Prix]], his second victory in two years at the [[Michigan]] street circuit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones F.|first=Robert|title=Street Smart In Motown|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066128/2/index.htm|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=29 June 1987|accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first ever for an [[active suspension]] F1 car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/2007/05/17/banned-active-suspension|title=Banned!

Senna became dissatisfied with his chances at Lotus and at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]] it was announced that he would be joining McLaren for 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton (2004), p 186&lt;/ref&gt; Senna finished the season strongly, coming second in the final two races in [[1987 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]] and [[1987 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], however post-race scrutineering at the final race found the brake ducts of his Lotus to be wider than permitted by the rules and he was disqualified, bringing his last and most successful season with Lotus to a sour end.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton (2004), p 188&lt;/ref&gt; Senna was classified third in the final standings, with 57 points, with six podium finishes and only one pole position. This season marked a turning point in Senna's career as, throughout the year, he built a deep relationship with Honda, one which would pay big dividends, as McLaren had secured Williams's supply of Honda's V6 turbo engines for 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/eng-honda.html |title=Engines: Honda Motor Company |publisher=grandprix.com |accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===McLaren (1988–1993)===

====1988====
[[File:Senna 1988.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Senna won his first world title in {{F1|1988}} driving that season's dominant [[McLaren MP4/4]].]]
In 1988, due to the relationship he had built up with Honda throughout the 1987 season with Lotus, and with the approval of McLaren's number-one driver and then-double world champion, Alain Prost, Senna joined the McLaren team.&lt;ref name="prostfan.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prostfan.com/senna2.htm |title=Ayrton Senna by Alain Prost |publisher=prostfan.com |accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation for a fierce competition between Senna and Prost was laid, culminating in a number of dramatic race incidents between the two over the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes and Arron (2003), p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the experienced pair also quickly realized, despite their personal rivalry, they had to work together, especially in testing, to keep ahead of their main opposition from [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]], [[WilliamsF1|Williams]], [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]], Lotus, and [[March Engineering|March]].

One notable incident of the year was at the [[1988 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco Grand Prix]], where Senna outqualified Prost by 1.4 seconds and led for most of the race before crashing on lap 67.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McGowan|first=Tom|title=The fast and the furious: Ayrton Senna's greatest F1 moments|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/SPORT/motorsport/05/06/motorsport.f1.senna.greatest/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=25 May 2011|accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of returning to the pit lane, Senna went back to his apartment and did not contact the team until he walked into the pit garage as they were packing up later that night. As the television cameras had not captured his crash, team boss [[Ron Dennis]] did not know what had caused his DNF until then, though Prost speculated that judging from the tyre marks, it appeared as though Senna had clipped the inside barrier at Portiers, which pitched him into the outside guard rail. At the [[1988 Portuguese Grand Prix]], Prost made a slightly faster start than Senna, but the Brazilian dived into the first corner ahead. Prost responded and went to pass Senna at the end of the first lap. Senna swerved to block Prost, forcing the Frenchman to nearly run into the pit wall at {{convert|290|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Prost kept his foot down and soon edged Senna into the first corner and started pulling away. Though Prost was angered by Senna's manoeuvre, the Brazilian got away with a warning from the FIA. At the postrace team debrief, Prost voiced his anger at the move which prompted Senna to apologize to Prost for the incident. Ultimately, the pair won 15 of 16 races in the [[McLaren MP4/4]] in 1988 with Senna coming out on top, winning his first Formula One world championship title by taking eight wins to Prost's seven. Prost scored more points over the season, but had to drop three second places as only the 11 best scores counted.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Jones, ed. ''50 Years of the Formula One World Championship'' (Carlton, 1999). pp. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the biggest incident of the year happened at the [[1988 Italian Grand Prix|Italian Grand Prix]] at [[Autodromo Nazionale Monza|Monza]]. With two laps remaining, Senna held a five-second lead over the [[Ferrari F1/87#F1/87/88C|Ferrari]]s of [[Gerhard Berger]] and [[Michele Alboreto]], who were closing in on the [[McLaren MP4/4|McLaren]] (Prost had earlier retired with a badly misfiring engine). Going into the Rettifilo Chicane, Senna closed on the [[Williams FW12|Williams]] of [[Jean-Louis Schlesser]] (standing in for a sick Nigel Mansell). Schlesser steered wide, attempting to give Senna room to lap him, losing then regaining control to avoid going into the sand trap. Unfortunately, Senna did not give the Williams room and took his normal racing line. Subsequently, Senna's McLaren was T-boned and ended up beached on a curb with broken rear suspension. [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] would go on to an emotional 1–2 finish, the first in an [[Italian Grand Prix]] since the death of the team's founder [[Enzo Ferrari]]. This would prove to be the only race McLaren did not win in 1988.

During the season, Senna rewrote the record books. His eight wins beat the old record of seven jointly held by [[Jim Clark]] ({{f1|1963}}) and Prost (1984). His 13 pole positions also beat the record of nine held by Nelson Piquet (1984).

====1989====
[[File:Mclaren mp4 5.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Senna driving the [[McLaren MP4/5]] in {{F1|1989}}.]]
The following year, the rivalry between Senna and Prost intensified into numerous battles on the track and a psychological war off it.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Hilton, ''Ayrton Senna: The Whole Story'' (Haynes, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Tension and mistrust between the two drivers increased when Senna overtook Prost at the restart of the [[1989 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]], a move which Prost claimed violated a prerace agreement (Senna denied the existence of any agreement, though Prost's story was backed up by John Hogan of the team's major sponsor, [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]]). Senna took an early lead in the championship with victories in San Marino, [[1989 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], and [[1989 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]]. Senna also achieved the feat of leading every lap of those races which was not equalled until [[Sebastian Vettel]] in {{f1|2012}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tremayne|first=David|title=Sebastian Vettel wins Ayrton Senna-style to extend title advantage|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/sebastian-vettel-wins-ayrton-sennastyle-to-extend-title-advantage-8229982.html|publisher=The Independent|date=29 October 2012|accessdate=29 October 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senna also managed to win in [[1989 German Grand Prix|Germany]], [[1989 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgium]], and [[1989 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]]. However, unreliability in [[1989 United States Grand Prix|Phoenix]], [[1989 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], [[1989 French Grand Prix|France]], [[1989 British Grand Prix|Britain]], and [[1989 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]], together with collisions in [[1989 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]] and [[1989 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]], swung the title in Prost's favour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Fame – Ayrton Senna 1989–1994|url=http://marshallgp.com/2011/10/18/hall-of-fame-ayrton-senna-1989-1994/|publisher=Marshall GP|accessdate=18 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140324110920/http://marshallgp.com/2011/10/18/hall-of-fame-ayrton-senna-1989-1994/|archivedate=24 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prost took the 1989 world title after a collision with Senna at the [[Suzuka Circuit]] in Japan, [[1989 Japanese Grand Prix|the penultimate race of the season]], which Senna needed to win to remain in contention for the title. Prost had managed to leave the grid faster than Senna by removing the [[gurney flap]] from his car, which was unbeknownst to Senna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senna Journalists Special – Maurice Hamilton's commentary|url=http://www1.skysports.com/f1/news/22058/9291619/the-world-saw-him-as-a-mclaren-man-maurice-hamilton-on-his-new-senna-book|publisher=SpySportsF1|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduction in aerodynamic downforce made Prost's car faster on the straights, but slower through corners- a clever choice to make it even harder for Senna to pass on a circuit already difficult on which to pass. On lap 46, Senna had finally come next to Prost and attempted a pass on the inside at the last chicane. Prost turned right into the upcoming corner, cutting Senna off and tangling wheels with him. The collision caused both McLarens to slide to a standstill into the escape road ahead. Prost abandoned the race at that point, whereas Senna urged marshals for a push-start, which he received, then proceeding with the race after a pit stop to replace the damaged nose on his car. He took the lead from the [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]] of [[Alessandro Nannini]] and went on to claim victory, only to be disqualified following a stewards meeting after the race. Senna was disqualified for receiving a push start, cutting the chicane after the collision with Prost, and for crossing into the pit lane entry which was not part of the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&amp;dat=19891023&amp;id=G1pPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=IZADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6594,2083754|title=Drama in Suzuka: Senna disqualified, Prost 'wins' world title|newspaper=New Straits Times|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ed.

Senna claimed that Balestre had forced the race stewards to disqualify him so his fellow Frenchman Prost could win the championship, though the stewards of the meeting denied that Balestre forced their decision, claiming that he was not present when the decision was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00018.html |title=F1 – Grandprix.com &amp;gt; Features &amp;gt; News Feature &amp;gt; McLaren versus Jean-Marie Balestre |publisher=Grandprix.com |date=1 December 1989 |accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senna finished the season second with six wins and one second place.

====1990====
[[File:McLaren MP4-5B 2009 Japan.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[McLaren MP4/5B]] raced by Senna in {{F1|1990}}.]]
In 1990, Senna took a commanding lead in the championship with six wins, two second places, and three thirds. With Prost gone to Ferrari, he also had a new teammate in Austrian driver Gerhard Berger. Among his victories were the opening round in [[1990 United States Grand Prix|Phoenix]], in which he diced for the lead for several laps with a then-unknown [[Jean Alesi]] before coming out on top, and in [[1990 German Grand Prix|Germany]], where he fought Benetton driver Alessandro Nannini throughout the race for the win. As the season reached its final quarter, however, Alain Prost in his Ferrari rose to the challenge with five wins, including a crucial victory in [[1990 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] where he and teammate [[Nigel Mansell]] finished 1–2 for the Scuderia. Senna had gone out with a damaged radiator, and the gap between Senna and Prost was now reduced to 9 points with two races remaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1990 – Senna's Revenge|url=http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/f1-information/seasons/1990-formula-one-season-history-sennas-revenge/|publisher=F1 Fanatic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the penultimate round of the championship in [[1990 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]] at Suzuka, where Senna and Prost collided the previous year, Senna took pole ahead of Prost. Before qualifying, Senna had sought assurances from the organisers to move pole position left onto the clean side of the racetrack. After qualifying, FIA president Balestre denied Senna's request, leaving Senna to start on the dirty right side, thus favouring Prost on the left. In addition, as revealed by F1 journalist Maurice Hamilton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senna Journalists Special |url=http://www1.skysports.com/f1/news/22058/9291619/the-world-saw-him-as-a-mclaren-man-maurice-hamilton-on-his-new-senna-book|publisher=SpySportsF1|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the FIA had warned that crossing the yellow line of the pit exit on the right to better position oneself at the first corner would have not been appropriate, further infuriating Senna. At the beginning of the race, Prost pulled ahead of Senna, who immediately tried to repass Prost at the first corner. While Prost turned in, Senna kept his foot on the accelerator and the cars collided at 270&amp;nbsp;km/h (170&amp;nbsp;mph) and spun out of the race, making Senna world champion.&lt;ref&gt;Menard and Vassal (2003), pp. 106–107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prostfan.com/senna2.htm |title=Ayrton Senna at Suzuka revisited |publisher=Motorsport magazine |accessdate=18 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the second championship-deciding collision in two years, [[Jackie Stewart]] interviewed Senna at the [[1990 Australian Grand Prix]] (where Senna won pole and led for 61 laps before gearbox trouble forced him to slide off into a tyre barrier) and brought up a number of controversial collisions in which Senna had been involved over the last few years, stating that Senna had made more contact with other cars and drivers in the last four years than all the champions before him. An irritated Senna questioned how someone like Stewart, himself a triple world champion, could ask questions like he did, knowing the pressure under which drivers raced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgSe1CUa3SA |title=Ayrton Senna's Famous interview with Jackie Stewart |publisher=YouTube |date=21 September 2013 |accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later, after taking his third world championship, Senna explained to the press his actions of the previous year in Suzuka. He maintained that prior to qualifying fastest, he had sought and received assurances from race officials that pole position would be changed to the left, clean side of the track (where the racing line was), only to find this decision reversed by [[Jean-Marie Balestre]] after he had taken pole.&lt;ref&gt;Menard and Vassal(2003), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Senna said that he was not going to accept what he saw as unfair decision-making by Balestre, including his 1989 disqualification and the incorrect pole position in 1990 (though some in the F1 paddock noted that the pole position at Suzuka was actually on the same side of the track it had been since F1 returned to Japan in 1987, and many privately wondered why Senna was suddenly making a fuss about it, considering he had been on pole there in both 1988 and 1989, when he was also fighting Prost for the championship).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senna blows his top at Suzuka|url=http://www.autosport.com |accessdate=30 May 2007|publisher=autosport.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senna stated that no matter what happened, he would not yield the corner and that Prost taking his normal racing line would result in an accident. Prost would later go on record criticising Senna's actions as "disgusting", saying that he seriously considered retiring from the sport after that incident.&lt;ref name="prostfan.com"/&gt;

====1991====
[[File:Ayrton Senna during the race in Spa-Francorchamps on 25 August 1991.jpg|thumb|Ayrton Senna during the race in Spa-Francorchamps on 25 August 1991]]
In {{f1|1991}}, Senna became the youngest ever three-time world champion, taking seven wins and increasing his pole position record to 60 from 127 events. Prost, because of the downturn in performance at Ferrari, the likes of which littered the team's history, was no longer a serious competitor. In preseason testing, Senna made public misgivings about the car's competitiveness with the new Honda V12, stating that the engine was not as powerful as the prior year's V10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Codling |first1=Stuart|last2=Mann|first2=James|last3=Windsor|first3=Peter|last4=Murray|first4=Gordon|title=Art of the Formula 1 Race Car |authorlink= |publisher=Motorbooks |location= |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-7603-3731-8 |pages= |page=177 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senna won the first four races as his rivals struggled to match his pace and reliability. By midseason, Nigel Mansell in the Williams-Renault was able to put up a challenge. Before the [[1991 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexican Grand Prix]], Senna was injured in a jet-skiing accident near São Paulo for which he required stitches on the back of his head. During qualifying for that Grand Prix, he attempted to take the banked 180-degree Peraltada corner (Mexico City circuit's fastest corner) faster than normal, ending up spinning off the track and rolling over the car after crashing into a tyre barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senna returns to the front of the pack|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vYJUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EpADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5472,2118430&amp;dq=ayrton+senna+mexico&amp;hl=en|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=6 July 1991|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1991 British Grand Prix|British Grand Prix]] at Silverstone, Senna's car had come to a halt on the final lap, but he was not left stranded out on the circuit, as race-winner Mansell pulled over on his parade lap and allowed the Brazilian to ride on the Williams side-pod back to the pits. During the [[1991 Spanish Grand Prix|Spanish Grand Prix]], Senna and Mansell went wheel-to-wheel with only centimetres to spare, at over 320&amp;nbsp;km/h (200&amp;nbsp;mph) down the main straight, a race which the Briton eventually won.

Though Senna's consistency, the car's competitiveness and the Williams's unreliability at the beginning of the season gave him an early advantage, Senna insisted that Honda step up their engine development program and demanded further improvements to the car before it was too late. These modifications enabled him to make a late-season push, and he won three more races to secure the championship, which was settled in [[1991 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]] when Mansell (who needed to win), went off at the first corner while running third and beached his Williams in the gravel trap. Senna finished second, handing the victory to teammate Gerhard Berger at the last corner as a thank-you gesture for his support over the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=o_ROAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=m4wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5769,2993516&amp;dq=ayrton+senna&amp;hl=en|title=Senna gives up win for driver's title|newspaper=Boca Raton News|date=21 October 1991|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senna was planning to move to the Williams team for the 1992 season, but Honda's CEO, [[Nobuhiko Kawamoto]], personally requested that he remain at McLaren-Honda, which Senna did out of a sense of loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Rodrigues, ''Ayrton: The Hero Revealed'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, as had been the case in 1988 and 1990, Senna won the prestigious [[Autosport Awards|"International Racing Driver Award"]] granted by British magazine ''[[Autosport]]'' annually. The award was presented by [[Stirling Moss]] and Senna was interviewed on stage by Formula 1 commentator, [[Murray Walker]]. During the interview, Senna confirmed that at the [[Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile]] (FISA) gala dinner in [[Paris]] the day before, under the auspices of Jackie Stewart, Senna had gifted one of his helmets to his renowned foe, Jean-Marie Balestre, because of the sincere atmosphere that presented itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EXCLUSIVE: Watch Ayrton Senna at the 1991 AUTOSPORT Awards |url=http://plus.autosport.com/free/feature/3941/exclusive-watch-ayrton-senna-at-the-1991-autosport-awards/|publisher=[[Autosport]]|date=31 October 2011|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1992====
[[File:Ayrton Senna 1992 Monaco.jpg|thumb|Senna won the [[1992 Monaco Grand Prix]] in his [[McLaren MP4/7A]].]]
In 1992, Senna's determination to win manifested itself in dismay at McLaren's inability to challenge Williams's all-conquering [[Williams FW14|FW14B]] car.&lt;ref&gt;Menard and Vassal (2003), pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt; McLaren's new car for the season had several shortcomings. A delay occurred in getting the new model running (it debuted in the third race of the season, the Brazilian Grand Prix) and in addition to lacking active suspension, the new car suffered from reliability issues and was unpredictable in fast corners, while its Honda V12 engine was no longer the most powerful on the circuit.&lt;ref&gt;Menard and Vassal (2003), pp. 128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; During practice for the second race of the season in [[1992 Mexican Grand Prix|Mexico]] on a circuit Senna was heavily critical of, his car hit a bump that caused a loss of downforce and hard crash into a concrete retaining wall. He had to be extricated from the car by circuit doctors; although he raced the next day, albeit retiring from the race due to gearbox failure. Senna scored wins in [[1992 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], [[1992 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], and [[1992 Italian Grand Prix|Italy]] that year. During qualifying for the [[1992 Belgian Grand Prix|Belgian Grand Prix]], French driver [[Érik Comas]] crashed heavily and Senna was the first to arrive at the scene. He got out of his car and ran across the track to help the Frenchman, disregarding his own safety in an effort to aid a fellow driver. He later went to visit Comas in the hospital. His actions won universal praise from those in Formula One and seemed to soften his hard-nosed image. Senna finished fourth overall in the championship, behind the Williams duo of Mansell and [[Riccardo Patrese]], and Benetton's [[Michael Schumacher]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones (1999), pp. 253, 257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collings and Edworthy (2002), pp. 244–247.&lt;/ref&gt;

Senna's relationship with Schumacher had deteriorated throughout {{f1|1992}}. At the [[1992 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]], Schumacher accused Senna of 'playing around' while attempting to overtake Senna, who had a problem with his engine. At the [[1992 French Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]], Schumacher collided with Senna, resulting in Senna's retirement. Senna later confronted Schumacher, who admitted responsibility for the accident. At a test session for the [[1992 German Grand Prix|German Grand Prix]], Senna and Schumacher had a confrontation in the pits, with Senna grabbing Schumacher by the collar and accusing him of endangering him by blocking him on the track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Motor Racing: Testy times for Senna and Schumacher|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-testy-times-for-senna-and-schumacher-1533774.html|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=17 July 1992|accessdate=14 October 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions about Senna's intentions for the upcoming {{f1|1993}} season lingered throughout 1992, as he did not have a contract with any team by the end of that year. Ferrari had offered him a contract which Senna discussed with [[Niki Lauda]], but decided to decline the offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ferrari fail in attempt to recurit Senna|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=21 August 1992|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt the McLaren cars were becoming less competitive than in previous years, especially given Honda's decision to abandon the sport at the end of 1992 and McLaren's lack of active suspension relating to rival Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1blog.com/f1-biography/f1-biography-senna-gets-penske-test/|title=F1 Biography: Senna Gets Penske Test|publisher=f1b|date=4 October 2011|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given this scenario, Senna secured an [[Champ Car|IndyCar]] testing session with the support of conpatriot and [[Team Penske|Penske]] driver, [[Emerson Fittipaldi]]. In December 1992, in fact, Senna visited [[Firebird International Raceway]] in [[Chandler, Arizona]],&lt;ref&gt;Menard and Vassal (2003), p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; to test a 1992 [[Penske PC-21]] racer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ayrtonsenna.com.br/en/historias/dentro-das-pistas/provas-especiais/o-teste-com-a-penske-na-formula-indy/|title=Penske test in Indy|publisher=Ayrton Senna Official|accessdate=9 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225145543/http://www.ayrtonsenna.com.br/en/historias/dentro-das-pistas/provas-especiais/o-teste-com-a-penske-na-formula-indy|archivedate=25 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the more advanced F1 cars, this IndyCar was powered by a turbo [[Chevrolet]]-[[Ilmor]] V8, had a traditional transmission with clutch pedal and iron brakes, and was markedly heavier due to its bigger physical size in comparison to a smaller Formula One car. To familiarise himself, Senna initially ran 14 relatively slow laps before completing a further 10 laps on the same tyres and setting a best time of 49.09 seconds. By comparison, Fittipaldi had set a best time of 49.70 seconds, which he later improved to 48.5 seconds, only by using the new 1993 [[Penske PC-22]] at his disposal during this test session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fagnan|first=René|url=http://www.auto123.com/en/racing-news/penske-engineer-recalls-the-day-ayrton-senna-drove-an-indy-car?artid=147013|title=Penske engineer recalls the day Ayrton Senna drove an Indy Car|publisher=Auto123.com|date=27 August 2012|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1993====
[[File:Senna 1993 European GP.jpg|thumb|Senna won the [[1993 European Grand Prix]] in changing conditions, in what many considered one of the best drives of his career.]]
For {{f1|1993}}, attempts by McLaren boss [[Ron Dennis]] to secure a supply of the dominant Renault V10 engines failed.&lt;ref&gt;Menard and Vassal (2003), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Senna's offers to drive for [[WilliamsF1|Williams]]-[[Renault F1|Renault]] for free also failed, given that Alain Prost (who was returning to the sport after a sabbatical year) succeeded in obtaining the inclusion of a clause in his contract with Williams vetoing Senna from joining as a teammate. Faced with this, during a press conference at the season-opening test session at the [[Estoril Circuit]] on the [[Portuguese Riviera]], an infuriated Senna called Prost a coward, leading to some commentators stating that what Prost had done was no different from Senna vetoeing Derek Warwick from joining Lotus in 1986, but they did not take into account that Senna's chances of winning the championship were much higher in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Menard and Vassal (2003), pp. 129–132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collings and Edworthy (2002), p. 239, 250.&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, McLaren was forced to take a customer supply of [[Cosworth#HB|Ford]] V8 engines, which were two specifications behind that of Ford's then factory team, [[Benetton Formula|Benetton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constructors: McLaren International|work= GP Encyclopedia|url=http://www.grandprix.com |accessdate=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLaren hoped to make up for the inferior horsepower with mechanical sophistication, including an effective active suspension system – though the system itself proved difficult at times, especially for new teammate [[Michael Andretti]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of McLaren: Time Line – the 1990s|url= http://www.mclaren.com |accessdate=30 May 2007|publisher=mclaren.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this plan, Dennis finally persuaded Senna to stay with McLaren. The Brazilian, however, agreed to do so only for the first race in [[1993 South African Grand Prix|South Africa]], where he would assess whether McLaren's equipment was competitive enough for him to put in a good season. After driving McLaren's 1993 car, the [[McLaren MP4/8]], Senna concluded that the new car had a surprising potential, albeit with a Ford V8 engine down on power relative to Prost's Renault V10.&lt;ref&gt;Menard and Vassal (2003), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Senna thus extended his deal with McLaren on a race-by-race basis instead of a full-year contract, ending up staying for the whole of 1993 in any event.&lt;ref&gt;Collings and Edworthy (2002), p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, this engagement was on a $1 million per race basis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fangio: all-time great and gentleman|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/fangio-alltime-great-and-gentleman-1592066.html|publisher=The Independent|date=18 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, despite midseason testing with a [[Lamborghini V12]] proved encouraging, with McLaren then signing an engine supply deal with [[Peugeot]] for the {{f1|1994}} season, it all proved insufficient to continue to retain Senna past 1993.
[[File:AyrtonSennaAtHockheimGP1993-2.jpg|thumb|left|Senna came from the back of the field to finish fourth at the [[1993 German Grand Prix]] at [[Hockenheim]] on his [[McLaren MP4/8]].]]
In the opening race in South Africa, Senna finished in second place after surviving a collision with Schumacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grand Prix Results: South African GP, 1993|work= GP Encyclopedia |url=http://www.grandprix.com |accessdate=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senna won in changing conditions in [[1993 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]] and [[1993 European Grand Prix|Donington]]. The latter has often been regarded as one of Senna's greatest victories,&lt;ref&gt;Collings and Edworthy (2002), p. 250&lt;/ref&gt; in the process setting a record for the fastest lap in an F1 race driving through the then speed-unrestricted pit lane. He was fifth at the first corner and led the race at the end of the first lap going on to lap all but second place in a race where up to seven pit stops were required by some drivers for rain or [[slick tyres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/results/season/1993/86/ |title=1993 European Grand Prix |publisher=Formula 1 |accessdate=16 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606050843/http://www.formula1.com/results/season/1993/86/ |archivedate=6 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menard and Vassal (2003), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; Senna then scored a second-place finish in [[1993 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] and a record-breaking sixth win at [[1993 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ian |last=Thomsen|title=Senna, Hill and Monaco: Roaring Through the Ghost of a Winner Past|publisher= ''International Herald Tribune''|date= 24 May 1993|url=http://www.iht.com |accessdate=28 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Monaco, the sixth race of the season, Senna unexpectedly led the championship from Prost in the Williams-Renault.&lt;ref&gt;Menard and Vassal (2003), pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; As the season progressed, Alain Prost and [[Damon Hill]] asserted the superiority of their [[Williams FW15C|Williams-Renault cars]], while Senna suffered mechanical failures in [[1993 San Marino Grand Prix|Imola]], [[1993 Canadian Grand Prix|Canada]], [[1993 British Grand Prix|Britain]], [[1993 Hungarian Grand Prix|Hungary]], and [[1993 Portuguese Grand Prix|Portugal]]. Senna won the penultimate race of the season in [[1993 Japanese Grand Prix|Japan]], which was marked by an incident involving [[Jordan Grand Prix|Jordan's]] rookie [[Eddie Irvine]], twice unlapping himself against Senna. Immediately after the race, Senna attended at Jordan's garage and, following a lengthy and heated discussion, punched the Irishman in the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ayrton-senna.com/senna/suzuka.html |title=Ayrton Senna Suzuka 1993 |publisher=ayrton-senna.com |accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The season concluded in [[1993 Australian Grand Prix|Australia]], with what would be Senna's 41st and last F1 career win, as well as the last win for an active-suspension F1 car (ironically, 1987 had the first victory for such cars also at the hands of Senna in Monaco). The win in Adelaide was an emotional one due to Senna ending his successful career with McLaren and defeating his biggest rival, Prost, for the last time. Because of the Frenchman's imminent retirement from the sport, Senna surprised the F1 community by openly welcoming Prost on the top step of the podium, which many considered a sign of pacification between the duo. Overall, Senna finished the championship second to Prost.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collings and Edworthy (2002), pp. 251–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Tina Turner]]'s after-race concert in [[Adelaide]], Senna surprised everyone, including Turner, when he appeared on-stage midway through the night. With the crowd cheering, Turner admitted she was a fan of the Brazilian and resang her hit "[[The Best (song)|The Best]]" as a tribute to Senna and his Australian Grand Prix win earlier in the day.

===Williams (1994)===
[[File:Williams FW16 front-left 2017 Williams Conference Centre 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Williams FW16]] was the last car raced by Senna.]]
For 1994, Senna was able to finally join the Williams team given the retirement of Prost&lt;ref name=senna94&gt;{{cite web|last=Lopes|first=Rafael|last2=Murgel|first2=Leonardo|last3=Grünwald|first3=Alexander|title=Ayrton Senna: o período na Williams|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/Esportes/Noticias/0,,MUL1105495-17078,00-AYRTON+SENNA+O+PERIODO+NA+WILLIAMS.html|publisher=Globo|date=1 May 2009|accessdate=21 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was reportedly paid a $20 million salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Bruce|title=The Last Ride|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1005161/index.htm|publisher=Sports Illustrated|date=9 May 1994|accessdate=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Prost's retirement at the end of 1993, and Williams's consequential lack of a defending World Champion carrying race number 1 for a second year running, Senna would race in 1994 with number 2 and teammate Damon Hill would race with number 0 for the second year in a row.

Rule changes for 1994 had banned active suspension, traction control, and ABS. During preseason testing, the new [[Williams FW16]] car exhibited none of the superiority of the [[Williams FW15C|FW15C]] and [[Williams FW14B|FW14B]] cars that preceded it, and Senna found himself in close running with the [[Benetton B194]] of Schumacher. Senna expressed his discomfort with the handling of his car, stating, "I have a very negative feeling about driving the car and driving it on the limit and so on&amp;nbsp;... Some of that is down to the lack of electronic change. Also, the car has its own characteristics which I'm not fully confident in yet."&lt;ref&gt;Autosport 24 January 1994 Vol 134 No. 4 p.28&lt;/ref&gt; Senna further added, "It's going to be a season with lots of accidents, and I'll risk saying that we'll be lucky if something really serious doesn't happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayrton Senna 1960–1994: In his own words|url=http://www.espn.co.uk/espn/sport/story/13315.html#|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first race of the season was at Interlagos in [[1994 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazil]], where Senna took pole position. He took an early lead, but Schumacher's Benetton was never far behind. Schumacher took the race lead for good after passing Senna in the pits. While trying for a win, he pushed too hard and spun the car coming out of Junção on lap 56, stalling it and retiring from the race.&lt;ref name=senna94 /&gt; The second race was the inaugural [[1994 Pacific Grand Prix|Pacific Grand Prix]] at Aida, where Senna again placed the car on the pole. However, after being beaten to the first corner by second-qualifier Schumacher, he was hit from behind in the first corner by [[Mika Häkkinen]] and his race came to a definitive end when, while spinning backwards into the first corner's gravel trap, the Ferrari driven by [[Nicola Larini]] T-boned the Williams. Both drivers retired with front-suspension damage.

====Season controversies and end====
The 1994 season was the subject of sweeping rule changes, most notably banning the use of electronic "driver aids" such as active suspension, anti-lock brakes, traction control and launch control. From the start, suspicion of foul play mainly involving the Benetton team was said to have troubled Senna. For example, instead of returning to the pit area after his first lap retirement at the Pacific Grand Prix, Senna opted to stand near the first corner and watch the cars complete the race to see if he could detect whether any now banned traction control system was being used.&lt;ref name="grandprix-pacific94"&gt;{{cite web | title = Grand Prix Results: Pacific GP, 1994 | url = http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr550.html | work = GrandPrix.com | publisher = Inside F1 | accessdate = 2008-08-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080905180229/http://www.grandprix.com/gpe/rr550.html| archivedate= 5 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to the Williams box after the race suspicious that the Benetton car was illegal.&lt;ref name=saward&gt;{{cite web | title = Globetrotter: Rocking the boat | url = http://www.grandprix.com/gt/gt00044.html | first = Joe | last = Saward | authorlink = Joe Saward | work = GrandPrix.com | publisher = Inside F1 | date = 1994-08-11 | accessdate = 2008-08-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080929033558/http://www.grandprix.com/gt/gt00044.html| archivedate= 29 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in an interview for the 20th anniversary of Ayrton Senna's death, his then teammate, Damon Hill, revealed that Senna had "concluded that there was, what he regarded, as unusual noises from the engine" with "special tweak" giving Benetton an advantage.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite video|title=The Last Teammate (1994 San Marino Grand Prix's 20th Anniversary documentary) @ 8'25"|url=http://www1.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/f1/9293944/|publisher=SkySportsF1|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The season ended at the [[1994 Australian Grand Prix|Australian Grand Prix]] in Adelaide, where the first-corner chicane at the [[Adelaide Street Circuit]] was renamed the "Senna Chicane". Schumacher went on to win the driver's world championship title controversially after a collision that forced his retirement and that of his rival, and Senna teammate, Damon Hill. At the official FIA conference after the race, the German dedicated his title to Senna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=1994 Australian Grand Prix Press Conference with Michael Schumacher|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVX-kgy6oCQ|publisher=FIA|date=13 November 1994|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
{{Main|Death of Ayrton Senna|1994 San Marino Grand Prix}}

Senna died aged 34 after succumbing to fatal injuries sustained during his final race at the [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|San Marino Grand Prix]], on 1 May 1994.

===Racing crash===
The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was held on the "[[Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari]]" circuit located in Imola, Italy, between 28 April, and 1 May 1994. Senna stayed in room no. 200 at the Hotel Castello in Castel San Pietro Terme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hotel Castello Suite 200, where Senna stayed in his last night|url=http://www.motorsport.com/f1/photo/main-gallery/hotel-castello-suite-200-where-ayrton-senna-stayed-in-his-last-night-1692458/|publisher=motorsport.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European leg of the F1 season, starting at Imola, was traditionally considered the beginning of the yearly competition. Senna, who did not finish the two opening races of the season, declared that this was where his season would start, with 14 races, as opposed to 16, in which to win the title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayrton Senna's interview by Murray Walker, 28 May 1994|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iErwQ9Y0q-Y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams brought modified FW16s to Imola in an attempt to improve the car's handling.

On Friday, Senna placed the car on the pole for a then-record 65th and final time, but he was upset by events unfolding that race weekend. Senna complained about the FW16's handling and reported that the car's performance was generally worse after the engineers' latest adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;''Senna'' film (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; During the afternoon qualifying session, Senna's compatriot and protégé [[Rubens Barrichello]] was involved in a serious accident when his Jordan became airborne at the Variante Bassa chicane and hit the tyre-wall and fence. Barrichello suffered a broken nose and arm, and withdrew from the event. Barrichello reported that Senna was the first person he saw upon regaining consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton (2004), p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;

During Saturday qualifying, Austrian rookie [[Roland Ratzenberger]] was killed after the front wing of his Simtek-Ford broke entering the {{convert|310|km/h|mph|adj=on|abbr=on}} Villeneuve corner, sending the car into a concrete wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The incredible journey of F1 legend Ayrton Senna is released in UK cinemas|url=http://duncanblog.dailymail.co.uk/2011/06/the-incredible-journey-of-f1-legend-ayrton-senna-is-released-in-uk-cinemas-.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=3 June 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senna immediately visited the accident scene and medical centre. There he was met by FIA Medical Chief Professor [[Sid Watkins]], who suggested to a tearful Senna that he should retire from racing and go [[fishing]] (a hobby they both shared), to which Senna replied that he could not stop racing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayrton, Prof &amp; Me |url=http://www.institutequarterly.com/IQ-ISSUE02-article-03.html |publisher=Institute Quarterly |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126073259/http://www.institutequarterly.com/IQ-ISSUE02-article-03.html |archivedate=26 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senna was later called in front of the stewards for commandeering an official car and climbing the medical centre fence, and a row ensued, although Senna was not punished.&lt;ref name=hours&gt;{{cite web|last=Jones |first=Dylan |title=The last 96 hours of Ayrton Senna |url=http://8w.forix.com/senna1994.html |publisher=8wforix |date=22 April 2011 |accessdate=9 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031101710/http://8w.forix.com/senna1994.html |archivedate=31 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senna spent his final morning on the Sunday talking to former teammate and rival [[Alain Prost]] to discuss the re-establishment of the [[Grand Prix Drivers' Association]], with the aim of improving safety in Formula One. Prost had retired from the sport at the end of the 1993 season, and was now a media presenter. As the most senior driver in competition, Senna offered to take the role of leader, starting from the next race in Monaco. During the drivers' briefing, concerns had been raised about the mainly promotional use of a Porsche 911 lead car for the warm-up lap, with organizers agreeing to abandon the practice.&lt;ref name="hours" /&gt; It is said that [[WilliamsF1|Williams]] Chief Engineer [[Patrick Head]] had pranked Senna on the grid by advising him that the lead car would not be excluded from the warm-up lap after all.

At the start of the Grand Prix, Senna retained the lead from Schumacher, but proceedings soon became interrupted by a startline accident. [[JJ Lehto]]'s Benetton-Ford had stalled and was hit by the Lotus-Mugen Honda of [[Pedro Lamy]]. A wheel and debris landed in the main grandstand, injuring eight fans and a police officer. The safety car, a sporty version of the [[Opel Vectra]] medium family saloon, was deployed for several laps. The Vectra's slow pace was later questioned because of the consequential drop in tyre pressures on the Formula One cars. Senna had pulled alongside the Vectra and gestured to the driver, [[Max Angelelli]], to increase his speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enterf1.com/news/049-the-bite-point.asp |title=History of the F1 Safety Car |publisher=enterF1.com |date=21 April 2009 |accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On lap 6, the race resumed and Senna immediately set a quick pace with the third-quickest lap of the race, followed by Schumacher.

As Senna rounded the high-speed Tamburello corner on lap 7, his car left the racing line at around {{convert|307|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, ran in a straight line off the track, and hit the concrete retaining wall at around {{convert|233|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, after what telemetry showed to be an application of the brakes for around two seconds. The red flag was shown as a consequence of the accident.

Within two minutes of crashing, Senna was extracted from his race car by Watkins and his medical team, including intensive care anaesthetist Giovanni Gordini. Initial treatment took place by the side of the car, with Senna having a weak heartbeat and significant blood loss (around 4.5 liters). Because of Senna's poor neurological condition, Watkins performed an on-site [[tracheotomy]] and requested the immediate airlifting of Senna to Bologna's Maggiore Hospital under the supervision of Gordini.

At 18:40, the head of the hospital's emergency department, Maria Teresa Fiandri&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lorenzini|first=Tommaso|url=http://www.liberoquotidiano.it/news/sfoglio/11599274/Ayrton-Senna--il-racconto-della.html|title=Ayrton Senna, il racconto della dottoressa: "Così mi morì in braccio"|publisher=Libero Quotidiano|date=23 April 2014|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; made the announcement that Senna had died, but said the official time of death under Italian law was 14:17, which is when he impacted the wall and his brain stopped working.&lt;ref name="hours" /&gt; Watkins later said that as soon as he saw Senna's fully dilated pupils, he knew that his [[brainstem]] was inactive and that he would not survive.&lt;ref name=asenna /&gt;

The right-front wheel and [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] are believed to have been sent back into the cockpit, striking Senna on the right side of his helmet, forcing his head back against the headrest. In addition, a piece of the upright assembly, most likely a [[tie rod]], penetrated the helmet visor, which was a new, thinner version, above his right eye. Senna sustained fatal [[basilar skull fracture|skull fractures]], [[traumatic brain injury|brain injuries]] and a ruptured [[Superficial temporal artery|temporal artery]].&lt;ref&gt;Hilton (1994), p. 386&lt;/ref&gt;

As later revealed, when the medical staff examined Senna, a furled [[Austrian flag]] was found in his car—a flag that he had intended to raise in honour of Ratzenberger after the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first = Andrew|last = Longer|title = Ayrton Senna: The Last Hours|url = http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:UKNB:LTIB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F9242ED73BC537B&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated4&amp;req_dat=63FF7C9CECF24CA8828B27BFD2B2546B|publisher=The Times|page=30|date=31 October 1994|quote=Back at the track, in the shattered remains of Senna's car, they discovered a furled Austrian flag Senna had intended to dedicate his 42nd Grand Prix victory to Ratzenberger's memory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photographs of Senna being treated on the track by emergency medical personnel were taken by Senna's friend and ''Autosprint''{{'}}s picture editor, Angelo Orsi. Out of respect, those photographs have never been made public.&lt;ref name="hours" /&gt;

On 27 April 2014, as part of commemorating Senna on the 20th anniversary of his death, a three-journalist panel composed of Murray Walker, Maurice Hamilton, and David Tremayne and interviewed by [[Sky Sports]]' Simon Lazenby, concurred that, at [[1994 San Marino Grand Prix|his final F1 Grand Prix race]], Senna was under extreme pressure due to: 
* the serious crash of his young compatriot, [[Rubens Barrichello]], during Friday practice, whom Senna visited in hospital;
* the death of F1 rookie Roland Ratzenberger during Saturday qualifying;
* being 20 points behind in the [[1994 Formula One season|Drivers' Championship]];
* suspicion of the rival [[Benetton B194]] car using an illegal traction control system;
* the poor performance of his [[Williams FW16]];
* family disapproval of his girlfriend, [[Adriane Galisteu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Senna – Journalist Special|url = http://www1.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/f1/9294240/the-f1-show-senna-tribute|publisher=SkySportF1|date=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senna's death was considered by many of his Brazilian fans to be a national tragedy, and the Government of Brazil declared three days of national mourning. The [[Italian Air Force]] offered to fly the coffin back to Brazil, but the Senna family wished that it return home in a Brazilian plane. Contrary to airline policy and out of respect, Senna's coffin was allowed to be flown back to his home country in the passenger cabin of a [[VARIG]] [[McDonnell-Douglas MD-11]] airliner, accompanied by his distraught younger brother, Leonardo, and close friends.  The plane was escorted by fighter jets into [[São Paulo–Guarulhos International Airport]] on 4 May 1994, where it was met by the Mayor of São Paulo, [[Paulo Maluf]], and the state's governor, Luís Antônio Fleury. The coffin was carried by soldiers from the Air Force Police to a [[fire engine]], where eight cadets from the Military Police Academy mounted guard as it carried the coffin on the 20-mile journey into the city. Leading the motorcade were 17 police motorbikes, and 2,500 policemen lined the route to keep the crowds at bay.&lt;ref&gt;Rubython (2004), p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated three million people flocked to the streets of Senna's hometown of São Paulo to offer him their salute. This is widely accepted as the largest recorded gathering of mourners in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Margolis|first=Mac|title=Death of Speeding Star Pains a Nation Looking for Heroes : Ayrton Senna's fatal crash shattered Brazil, fueling anger and sadness|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=10 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 200,000 people filed past as his body lay in state at the Legislative Assembly building in [[Ibirapuera Park]].  After the public viewing, a [[21-gun salute]] was fired by the 2nd Artillery Brigade and seven [[Brazilian Air Force]] jets flew in a diamond formation as the funeral procession made its way to [[Cemiterio do Morumbi|Morumbi Cemetery]].  Many prominent motor-racing figures attended Senna's state funeral, such as team managers [[Ken Tyrrell]], Peter Collins, Ron Dennis, and Frank Williams, and driver Jackie Stewart.  The [[pallbearer]]s included drivers [[Gerhard Berger]], [[Michele Alboreto]], [[Alain Prost]], [[Thierry Boutsen]], [[Damon Hill]], [[Rubens Barrichello]], [[Roberto Moreno]], [[Derek Warwick]], [[Maurício Gugelmin]], [[Hans-Joachim Stuck|Hans Stuck]], [[Johnny Herbert]], [[Pedro Lamy]], [[Maurizio Sandro Sala|Maurizio Sala]], [[Raul Boesel]], [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], [[Wilson Fittipaldi]], and [[Christian Fittipaldi]]. Neither [[Sid Watkins]] nor [[Jo Ramírez]], the McLaren team coordinator, could bear to attend because they were so grief-stricken. Senna's family did not allow [[Formula One Management|FOM]] president Bernie Ecclestone, a friend of Senna's, to attend the ceremony, after an altercation between Ecclestone and Senna's brother Leonardo at Imola regarding Ecclestone's misconstrued reaction to the news of Ayrton's death and the fact that the race had not been abandoned after his accident.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing/senna-would-have-beaten-schumacher-in-equal-cars-560807.html |title=Senna would have beaten Schumacher in equal cars |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=22 April 2004 |accessdate=24 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; FIA President [[Max Mosley]] instead attended the funeral of Ratzenberger, which took place on 7 May 1994, in [[Salzburg]], Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Track Topics |author1=David Tremayne |author2=Mark Skewis |author3=Stuart Williams |author4=Paul Fearnley | work=Motoring News | publisher=News Publications Ltd. |date=5 April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosley said in a press conference 10 years later, "I went to his funeral because everyone went to Senna's.

A testament to the adulation he inspired among fans worldwide was the scene at the Tokyo headquarters of Honda, where the McLaren cars were typically displayed after each race. Upon his death, so many floral tributes were received, they overwhelmed the large exhibition lobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:アイルトン・セナの去った夜|url=http://www.honda.co.jp/collection-hall/episodes_old/motor/mp44/index.html|language=Japanese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20110711133916/http://www.honda.co.jp/collection-hall/episodes_old/motor/mp44/index.html|archivedate=11 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was despite the fact Senna no longer drove for McLaren and that McLaren in the preceding seasons did not use Honda power.

For the next race at [[1994 Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]], the FIA decided to leave the first two grid positions empty and painted them with the colours of the Brazilian and the Austrian flags, to honour Senna and Ratzenberger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Auto Racing: Schumacher captures Monaco Grand Prix|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Dk8eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=JccEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3245,2389394&amp;dq=monaco+grand+prix&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Times Daily|date=16 May 1994|page=2C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italian prosecution===
Italian law requires that accidents resulting in a fatality must be investigated for any criminal culpability, with the associated scene of the accident secured and the activities that led to the fatality, suspended forthwith. Senna's death was thus the subject of criminal proceedings in Italy, which saw key Williams team members investigated and charged with [[manslaughter]]. The original trial in 1997 concluded with acquittals on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove its case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/4587195.stm|work=BBC News|title=Top designers acquitted on Senna| date=27 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prosecution culminated with verdict no. 15050 handed down by the Italian [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Supreme Court of Cassation]] on 13 April 2007, which stated: "It has been determined that the accident was caused by a  [[steering column]] failure. This failure was caused by badly designed and badly executed modifications. The responsibility of this falls on [[Patrick Head]], culpable of omitted control". Head, however, was never arrested because the Italian statute of limitation for manslaughter is 7 years and 6 months, and the final verdict was pronounced 13 years after the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Gazzetta dello Sport|title= Senna, Head Responsabile |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Motori/Formula1/Primo_Piano/2007/04_Aprile/13/senna.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The criminal charges focused on the car's steering column, which was found to have sheared off at a point where a modification had been made. The prosecution alleged that the column had failed causing the accident and the Williams team conceded to this failure, but only as caused by the impact at the Tamburello corner. Senna had not liked the position of his [[Williams FW16|FW16]]'s steering wheel relative to the seating position and had asked for the former to be changed. Head and [[Adrian Newey]] satisfied Senna's request by having the existing column cut and extended with a smaller-diameter piece of tubing, which was welded together with reinforcing plates. The modification was carried out in this manner as there was no time to manufacture a new longer steering column in time for the race.

== Personal life ==
[[File:Ayrton Senna with a Dog.jpg|thumb|left|Senna at home in his native Brazil.]]

Senna was a devout [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]], once saying: "Just because I believe in God, just because I have faith in God, it doesn't mean that I'm immune. It doesn't mean that I'm immortal" (1989).&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/manish-pandey/ayrton-senna_b_909096.html |title=Ayrton Senna: The Faith Of The Man Who Could Drive On Water |website=The Huffington Post |date=1 August 2011 |first=Manish |last=Pandey}}&lt;/ref&gt; He often read the Bible on long flights from São Paulo to Europe.&lt;ref name="Philip"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2323502/Spirit-of-Ayrton-Senna-is-Lewis-Hamiltons-spur.html|title=Spirit of Ayrton Senna is Lewis Hamilton's spur|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK|first=Robert|last=Philip|date=17 October 2007|accessdate=27 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100713182200/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/2323502/Spirit-of-Ayrton-Senna-is-Lewis-Hamiltons-spur.html| archivedate= 13 July 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/racing/f1/news/story?id=4565293|title=Hamilton visits Senna's grave|publisher=ESPN |date=16 October 2009|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to sister Viviane, Senna had sought strength from the Bible on the morning of his death: "On that final morning, he woke and opened his Bible and read a text that he would receive the greatest gift of all, which was God himself."&lt;ref name="The Huffington Post"/&gt;

As his profile rose, Senna expressed concern over the poor in Brazil. After his death,  he was discovered to have quietly donated millions of his personal fortune to help poor children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/championship/drivers/hall-of-fame/Ayrton_Senna.html |title=Hall of Fame – Ayrton Senna |publisher=Formula1.com |accessdate=2018-05-28 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20180504010851/https://www.formula1.com/en/championship/drivers/hall-of-fame/Ayrton_Senna.html | archivedate=2018-05-04 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before his death, he created the framework for an organisation dedicated to Brazilian children, which later became the [[Instituto Ayrton Senna]] (IAS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Widdows |first=Rob |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/motorsport/2750524/Instituto-Ayrton-Senna-Gone-but-not-forgotten.html |title=Instituto Ayrton Senna: Gone but not forgotten |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=2 February 2008 |accessdate=24 June 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senna was often quoted as using driving as a means for self-discovery and racing as a metaphor for life: "The harder I push, the more I find within myself. I am always looking for the next step, a different world to go into, areas where I have not been before. It's lonely driving a Grand Prix car, but very absorbing. I have experienced new sensations, and I want more. That is my excitement, my motivation."&lt;ref&gt;Collings and Edworthy (2002), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of his career, Senna became increasingly preoccupied with the dangers of his profession. On the morning of his death, he initiated the reformation of the [[Grand Prix Drivers' Association|GPDA]] safety organisation, with which he had intended to work to improve the safety of his sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The F1 FAQ|url=http://atlasf1.autosport.com/2000/bel/faq.html|publisher=Atlas F1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senna owned several properties, including an [[organic farming|organic]] farm in [[Tatuí]], Brazil (where he built a go-kart track in 1991), a beach house in [[Angra dos Reis]], Brazil, an apartment in [[São Paulo]], Brazil, an apartment in [[Monaco]], an estate in [[Sintra]], on the [[Portuguese Riviera]], and a house in [[Algarve]], Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Europe House of the Day|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704828104576021633581862742|website=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=23 December 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110125063543/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704828104576021633581862742.html| archivedate= 25 January 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the latter residence is where Senna let his last girlfriend, Adriane Galisteu, stay for the start of the European leg of the F1 season. The pair had met the year before at an hospitality event by McLaren sponsor, [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]], as part of the [[1993 Brazilian Grand Prix|Brazilian Grand Prix]] for which Galisteu had to audition through a model agency, to work as a hostess.&lt;ref name=child /&gt;

He also had several hobbies, such as flying real and [[model aircraft|model planes and helicopters]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Remembering Ayrton': His biggest hobby&amp;nbsp;...|url=http://richardsf1.com/2011/07/30/remembering-ayrton-his-biggest-hobby/|publisher=richardsf1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407072107/http://richardsf1.com/2011/07/30/remembering-ayrton-his-biggest-hobby/|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[boating]], fishing, and riding his favourite [[Ducati]] motorbikes.

Senna was close friends with McLaren teammate Gerhard Berger, and the two were always playing practical jokes on each other.&lt;ref&gt;Menard and Vassal (2003), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=June 2013}} Berger is quoted as saying, "He taught me a lot about our sport, I taught him to laugh."&lt;ref&gt;Rubython, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=June 2013}} In the documentary film ''The Right to Win'', made in 2004 as a tribute to Senna, Frank Williams notably recalls that as good a driver as Senna was, ultimately "he was an even greater man outside of the car than he was in it."

Senna was married to Lilian de Vasconcelos Souza from 1981 until 1982. Vasconcelos, whom he had known since childhood, had difficulty adapting to her husband's racing life in England. Vasconcelos later said: "I was his second passion. His first passion was racing... There was nothing more important in the world for him, not family, not wife, nothing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kleber Tomaz Do G1 SP |url=http://g1.globo.com/sao-paulo/noticia/2010/12/primeira-mulher-de-senna-lamenta-nao-aparecer-em-filme-sobre-piloto.html |title=G1 – Primeira mulher de Senna lamenta não aparecer em filme sobre piloto – notícias em São Paulo |publisher=G1.globo.com |date= |accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he did not have much of an income early in his racing career, Senna insisted on supporting his wife with no help from his father out of a sense of pride.&lt;ref name=vbrazil&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayrton, the Hero Revealed – a biography of the Brazilian pilot|url=http://www.v-brazil.com/culture/Brazilian-celebrities/ayrton-biography.html|publisher=V-Brazil}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage ended in divorce. Senna then courted Adriane Yamin, daughter of an entrepreneur from São Paulo, who was 15 years old when they began the relationship in 1985 and often chaperoned by her mother during meetings with Senna. They were briefly engaged, but the relationship was broken off by Senna in late 1988.&lt;ref name=Rodrigues&gt;{{cite book|last= Rodrigues |first= Ernesto |title= Ayrton: o herói revelado |publisher=Objetiva |year= 2004 |language= Portuguese |page= 639 |isbn= 978-85-7302-602-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senna dated Brazilian TV star [[Xuxa]] from late 1988 until 1990.

One of the most extravagant claims involving Senna's past partners was made by Edilaine de Barros, a former model better known as Marcella Praddo. She alleged that the couple dated from 1992 to 1994. Weeks after Senna's death, de Barros' child, Victoria, was born and claims that Senna was the father were soon made but abandoned following rejection of those claims by the Senna family. Years later, after joining a religious sect, the former model was convinced to sue against the estate of Senna. In 2000, DNA tests of hair and saliva samples given by Senna's parents conclusively proved that he was not the father of de Barros' child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.autosport.com/news/atlasf1-report.php/id/2772/|title=Senna Cleared by DNA Tests in Patrimony Case|author=Atlas F1|publisher=Autosport.com|date=11 August 2000|accessdate=6 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early years in Formula One, Senna was the subject of a smear campaign orchestrated by [[Nelson Piquet]], ranging from Senna being regarded a taxi driver to being homosexual given his failed marriage.&lt;ref name="Jalopnik"&gt;{{cite web|title=Formula One's Greatest Driver Lost His Virginity To A Prostitute When He Was 13|url=http://jalopnik.com/5977119/formula-ones-greatest-driver-lost-his-virginity-to-a-prostitute-when-he-was-13|publisher=Jalopnik|accessdate=18 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1990 interview by [[Playboy (Brazil)|Brazilian edition]] of ''[[Playboy]]'', Senna declared that he lost his virginity at 13 years of age to a prostitute arranged by his cousin, and he also insinuated having had a relationship with Piquet's would-be wife (hence Piquet's acrimony).&lt;ref name="Jalopnik"/&gt;

Former Formula One driver [[Bruno Senna]] is the nephew of Senna (being his sister Viviane's son) of whom he said in 1993: "If you think I'm fast, just wait until you see my nephew Bruno."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.formula1.com/news/features/2009/11/10214.html |title=Bruno Senna – more than just a famous name? |publisher=Formula1.com |date=12 November 2009 |accessdate=2 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091115235850/http://www.formula1.com/news/features/2009/11/10214.html |archive-date=15 November 2009 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the death of his uncle, Bruno initially gave up motor racing at his family's insistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Miranda, Charles|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/motor-sport/the-two-decades-since-the-death-of-ayrton-senna-have-passed-quickly-says-the-f1-legends-nephew/story-fni2fu80-1226895994629|title=The two decades since the death of Ayrton Senna have passed quickly, says the F1 legend's nephew|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=25 April 2014|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually raced in F1 between 2010 and 2012, in the latter year for the Williams team, which was a decision that, reportedly, had a significant emotional impact on the Senna family and was seen by some as a signing only resulting from Bruno's big name and the money it could bring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Phelps, James|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/motor-sport/the-two-decades-since-the-death-of-ayrton-senna-have-passed-quickly-says-the-f1-legends-nephew/story-fni2fu80-1226895994629|title=Ayrton Senna's nephew Bruno reunites two of Formula One's most famous names|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=15 March 2012|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, to take advantage of the close relationship Honda had formed with Senna, the Japanese company asked him to help fine-tune the [[Honda NSX]]'s suspension setting during its final development stages. Test runs were conducted at various circuits, including five sessions with prototypes at the Suzuka Circuit where chief NSX engineer [[Shigeru Uehara]] and his team were present to gather Senna's direct input.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Honda's NSX shows why Ayrton was the greatest|url=http://www.nsxprime.com/FAQ/Media/2002-09-01-sundaytimes.jpg|work=The Sunday Times|first=Andrew|last=Frankel|date=1 September 2002|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senna found the prototype NSX initially lacked chassis stiffness to the level to which he was accustomed, so the final production version was further reinforced to his satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Honda NSX: Cult favourite resurrected|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/motoring/news/article.cfm?c_id=9&amp;objectid=10773432|publisher=New Zealand Herald|date=17 December 2011|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senna reportedly had access to three of these cars: a black 1993 NSX in Brazil, which he ordered to his specifications, bearing license plate BSS-8888, which represents his initials for "Beco" – his childhood nickname – "Senna da Silva" and 8 to commemorate his first F1 championship in 1988; a red one with licence plate SX-25-59, which was loaned to him by Honda Portugal; a black one purchased by Antonio Carlos de Almeida Braga, who was a close personal friend, manager, and mentor of Ayrton Senna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ayrton Senna|url=https://sennamcf.wordpress.com|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senna was also instrumental in bringing [[Audi]] cars into his native country, both as an import and manufacturing business.  Audi entered Brazil in 1994 via Senna's company, Senna Import, founded in 1993. Sales began in April that year, just a month before his untimely death. In 1999, [[Audi Senna]] was created as a joint venture of Audi with Senna Import.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audi.com.br/br/brand/pt/company/audi_no_brasil.html |title=Audi Brasil &amp;gt; Companhia &amp;gt; Audi no Brasil |publisher=Audi.com.br |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=2 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101006064625/http://www.audi.com.br/br/brand/pt/company/audi_no_brasil.html| archivedate= 6 October 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the black NSX mentioned above, Senna's other personal car in 1994 was a silver [[Audi S4#C4|Audi 100 S4]] Avant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/classificados/veiculos/ult1670u1406.shtml |title=Folha Online – Classificados – Veículos – Audi expõe S4 de Ayrton Senna no Salão do Automóvel – 20/10/2004 |publisher=.folha.uol.com.br |date=20 October 2004 |accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senna: aceleramos os carros do campeão|url=http://caranddriverbrasil.uol.com.br/carros/carros/especial/senna-aceleramos-os-carros-do-campeao/8013|publisher=Car and Driver (Portugal)|date=11 June 2014|accessdate=9 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208181855/http://caranddriverbrasil.uol.com.br/carros/carros/especial/senna-aceleramos-os-carros-do-campeao/8013|archive-date=8 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Senna developed his own merchandise brand represented by a logo with a double S, after his full surname, "Senna da Silva".&lt;ref name="Rubython 2004, p. 497"&gt;Rubython (2004), p. 497&lt;/ref&gt;  This logo is meant to represent an S [[chicane]] on a racing circuit.

Many safety improvements were made in the sport following Senna's and Ratzenberger's deaths and Barrichello's crash. These include improved crash barriers, redesigned tracks, higher crash safety standards (such as larger sills along the driver cockpit) and major cuts to engine power. The Tamburello corner and other parts of the Imola circuit were altered for 1995. This was despite calls for action in 1989, after a serious high-speed crash in which Senna's friend, Gerhard Berger, suffered burns to his hand. No action took place after that crash because, following an inspection by Senna and Berger, they ended up siding with officials who had, for years, claimed that the wall could not be moved further back due to a river nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alsop|first=Derick|title=Motor Racing: Hill confronts life on the track after Senna|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/motor-racing-hill-confronts-life-on-the-track-after-senna-after-the-double-tragedy-at-imola-it-is-back-to-the-wheel-derick-allsop-reports-from-monte-carlo-1435486.html|work=The Independent|date=12 May 1994|accessdate=16 August 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Revised on-track medical procedures also saw personnel hold up curtains at crash sites, to prevent the public from viewing distressing images as had occurred on live television with Senna.

A few months before his death, Senna had discussed with his sister the foundation of a charitable organization, based on a desire to contribute to those less fortunate in a more organised and effective manner.  After his death, Viviane Senna set up the [[Instituto Ayrton Senna]] in his honor, which has invested nearly US$80&amp;nbsp;million over the last 12 years in social programs and actions in partnership with schools, government, [[Non governmental organization|NGOs]], and the private sector, aimed at offering children and teenagers from low-income backgrounds the skills and opportunities they need to develop their full potential as persons, citizens, and future professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senna.globo.com/institutoayrtonsenna/ |title=Instituto Ayrton Senna |publisher=Senna.globo.com |accessdate=2 October 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101009155058/http://senna.globo.com/institutoayrtonsenna/| archivedate= 9 October 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation is officially advised by [[Bernie Ecclestone]], Frank Williams, Alain Prost, and Gerhard Berger. The [[Senninha]] ("Little Senna") cartoon character, born in 1993/94, was another means by which Senna extended his role-model status in favour of Brazilian children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senna's World:SENNINHA|url=http://www.sennaworld.com/senninha.html|publisher=Senna's World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monum -Senna 05.JPG|thumb|right|A monument dedicated to Senna's Formula 1 racing, located at the entrance of the tunnel under [[Ibirapuera Park]] in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].]]In his home country of Brazil, the main freeway from the international airport to São Paulo and a tunnel along route to the heart of the city are named in his honour. Also, one of the most important freeways of Rio de Janeiro is named after Senna ("Avenida Ayrton Senna"). The main road in Senna's Portuguese resort at [[Quinta do Lago]], Algarve, was also dedicated to him, because his villa there was very near (but not on) this road. A portion of the [[Autódromo José Carlos Pace|Interlagos Circuit]] in São Paulo is named the "Senna Esses Chicane" in his honor and decorated with commissioned art from beloved Brazilian artist Luciana Bermelho. In the English town of [[Reading, Berkshire]], where Senna lived for a short period of time, an avenue in the suburb of Tilehurst was named after him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/2095008_ayrton_senna_a_legend_but_not_in_the_garden 'Ayrton Senna a legend... but not in the garden'] "Ayrton Senna Road, Tilehurst, Berkshire, RG41 4JQ"&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2000, Senna was inducted into the [[International Motorsports Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Motorsports Hall of Fame adds Andretti|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HDgfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0s8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2027,265093&amp;dq=ayrton+senna+international+hall+of+fame&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Herald-Journal|date=2 November 1999|page=D2}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year,  the UK public also voted Senna's opening lap of the 1993 European Grand Prix, the 43rd in the list of the [[100 Greatest (UK TV series)|100 Greatest Sporting Moments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest_sporting/results.html|title=100 Greatest sporting moments – results|work=[[Channel 4]]|accessdate= 28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a book called ''Ayrton: The Hero Revealed'' (original title: ''Ayrton: O Herói Revelado''&lt;ref&gt;written by Ernesto Rodrigues, [http://www.objetiva.com.br Editora Objetiva]&lt;/ref&gt;) was published in Brazil for the 10th anniversary of his death. Senna remains a national hero in Brazil and his grave attracts more visitors than the graves of John F. Kennedy, Marilyn Monroe, and Elvis Presley combined.&lt;ref name="Philip"/&gt;

In addition, to mark the 10th anniversary of Senna's death, on 21 April 2004, over 10,000 people attended a charity match in a football stadium near Imola. The game was organised by several devoted Italian and Canadian fans of Senna, bringing the Brazil team that won the 1994 World Cup to face the "Nazionale Piloti", an exhibition team composed exclusively of top race car drivers. Senna had been a part of the latter in 1985. Michael Schumacher, [[Jarno Trulli]], Rubens Barrichello, [[Fernando Alonso]], and many others faced the likes of [[Dunga]], [[Careca]], [[Cláudio Taffarel|Taffarel]], and several of the team that won the FIFA World Cup in the United States 10 years earlier. The match finished 5–5 and the money was donated to the IAS. Viviane Senna, the president of the IAS, was also involved in the kick-off of this match. That same weekend, Bernie Ecclestone revealed that he still believed Senna was and remained the best F1 driver he had ever seen.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

Since his death, Senna has been the subject of several songs (either wholly dedicated to him or simply referring to him) including by: Italian singer-songwriter [[Lucio Dalla]] (song titled "Ayrton"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilfoglio.it/im-with-the-band/2014/04/27/il-mistico-e-la-belva-ayrton-senna-secondo-lucio-dalla___1-v-90063-blog_c350.htm|title=Il mistico e la belva.

Between 1996 and 1998, to pay tribute to Senna, the Italian motorcycle manufacturer Ducati produced three special "Senna" editions of their [[Ducati 916|916]] superbike. Ducati was at the time owned by Claudio Castiglioni, a personal friend of Senna who was an avid Ducati owner and endorsed the release of this 916 in March 1994.

==Helmet design==
[[File:AyrtonSennasFullFaceHelmet.jpg|thumb|upright|Senna's helmet bearing the colours of the [[Flag of Brazil|Brazilian national flag]].]]
In his karting days, Senna's helmet consisted of a plain white background with notable features absent. He experimented with several designs to satisfy him, such as a white, yellow, and green helmet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rubens Barrichello shares an early helmet design for Ayrton Senna|url=http://www.anchorfan.com/image/rubens-barrichello-shares-an-early-helmet-design-for-ayrton-senna|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130116215506/http://www.anchorfan.com/image/rubens-barrichello-shares-an-early-helmet-design-for-ayrton-senna|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 January 2013|publisher=Anchor Fan|date=24 October 2011|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; before settling on a design by Sid Mosca that included a yellow background with a green stripe surrounding the upper visor and a light metallic blue stripe surrounding the lower visor (both stripes are delineated in the other stripe's color) that was first seen in 1979; Mosca also painted helmets for Emerson Fittipaldi and Nelson Piquet.

According to Mosca, the blue and green stripes symbolised movement and aggression, while the overall yellow colour symbolised youth;&lt;ref name=video /&gt; the three colors were also identifiable with the [[Flag of Brazil]]. The helmet never had significant changes, apart from sponsorship. One such change was that Senna would occasionally alter the stripe from blue to black. The tone of yellow changed a number of times, while usually a rich sunburst yellow, in 1985 and 1986 in some races, he used a fluorescent neon yellow colour. In 1994, the helmet was a lighter, paler yellow to complement the blue and white of the Williams car. He used a number of helmet brands throughout his career. From 1977 to 1989, he used Bell (Star – '77 to '82, XFM-1 – '83 to '89), from 1990 to 1991 Honda's own Rheos brand, 1992 to 1993 he used Shoei (X-4) and for 1994 he returned to using Bell (M3 Kevlar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remembering Ayrton: That iconic helmet|url=http://richardsf1.com/2011/07/18/remembering-ayrton-that-iconic-helmet/|publisher=richardsf1|date=8 July 2011|accessdate=16 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707074936/http://richardsf1.com/2011/07/18/remembering-ayrton-that-iconic-helmet/|archivedate=7 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The helmet worn by Senna in the fatal race was returned to Bell in 2002 and was incinerated while family members watched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morrison|first1=Mac|title=The Helmet|journal=[[Autoweek]]|date=28 April 2014|volume=64|issue=9|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-party adaptations===
[[File:Bruno Senna demonstrating Lotus 97T 2010 Japan.jpg|thumb|upright|Bruno Senna's helmet design is an adaptation of his uncle's (seen here parading the 1985 Lotus 97T at the [[2010 Japanese Grand Prix]]).]]
His nephew [[Bruno Senna|Bruno]] wore a modified version of his helmet design (a yellow helmet with a green and blue stripe) during his Formula One career, but the stripes are shaped after an S rather than being straight, under the chin area it has a green stripe, and it has a blue rounded rectangle in the top area. Bruno sported a modified helmet design for the final three races of the 2011 season to honour the 20th anniversary of Ayrton winning his last world championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senna wearing special helmet for anniversary|url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/269710/senna-wearing-special-helmet-for-anniversary/|publisher=gpupdate.net|date=13 October 2011|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1995 Brazilian Grand Prix]], Rubens Barrichello incorporated part of Senna's helmet design into his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Richard|title=Spirit of Senna in the air|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/spirit-of-senna-in-the-air-1613061.html|work=The Independent|date=27 March 1995|accessdate=16 August 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[2011 Brazilian Grand Prix]], another variant of Senna's helmet was used by Lewis Hamilton and by Barrichello too. Hamilton used the design with permission from Senna's sister Viviane and the helmet was later sold in support of the IAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Friday practice – selected team and driver quotes|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2011/11/12833.html|publisher=Formula1.com|date=25 November 2011|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2015 Brazilian Grand Prix]], Hamilton again varied his helmet design (this time, the rear only given FIA restrictions on design changes in force from 2015) accompanied with a [[Twitter]] announcement stating "Just for you, Brazil!! A tribute to the greatest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Just for you, Brazil! Lewis Hamilton unveils Ayrton Senna tribute helmet|url=http://zeenews.india.com/sports/motorsports/just-for-you-brazil-lewis-hamilton-unveils-ayrton-senna-tribute-helmet_1821632.html|publisher=Zee News|date=13 November 2015|accessdate=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of motor racing, Brazilian cyclist [[Murilo Fischer]] wore a helmet based on Senna's helmet colour scheme of yellow with green and blue stripes on stage 11 of the [[2015 Giro d'Italia]], which finished on the Imola circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/news-shorts-kng-shines-in-the-rain-fischer-honours-senna |title=News Shorts: Küng shines in the rain, Fischer honours Senna |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=22 May 2015 |website=[[cyclingnews.com]] |access-date=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Central Park Place''' is a 56-story [[condominium]] building in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="ctbuh"/&gt; The building was completed in 1988, and is located at 301 West 57th Street (between [[Eighth Avenue (Manhattan)|Eighth Avenue]] &amp; [[Ninth Avenue (Manhattan)|Ninth Avenue]]).&lt;ref name="emporis"/&gt;" It is [[Tallest buildings in New York City|one of the one hundred tallest buildings in New York City]], standing at {{Convert|628|ft|m|0}} tall.

In 1987, during the construction of Central Park Place, a piece of lumber was dislodged from one of the higher floors during wind storm and hit a 37-year-old man in the head while he was walking on the east side of 8th Avenue opposite the building. He sustained massive brain trauma and died. The City of New York halted construction to investigate the incident. The builder, losing money because of the work stoppage, sued the city. The consequence of this tragedy was a new requirement that all tall building construction projects were required to place netting over any open areas to prevent the accidental loss of debris from the higher floors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/03/nyregion/record-is-poor-at-fatality-site-on-8th-avenue.html NY Times Record is Poor at Fatality Site on 8th Avenue]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The architectural firm responsible for the building is [[Davis Brody Bond]] and was developed by [[William Zeckendorf, Jr.|William Zeckendorf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://streeteasy.com/nyc/building/central-park-place|title=Building: Central Park Place at 301 West 57th Street in Clinton|publisher=Street Easy|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Wellington Fisher''' (August 4, 1866&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Footz (2006) 263&lt;/ref&gt; – May 5, 1919)&lt;ref name="pf271" /&gt; was a Canadian politician who served as the first [[Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta]].

== Biography ==

Born in [[Hyde Park, Ontario]], Fisher came to [[Cochrane, Alberta|Cochrane]] from [[Ontario]] in 1899, and became the town's leading merchant. In 1907 he married a niece of the Carling family (of [[Carling]] Brewery fame), and promised her that they would live in a castle. By way of fulfilling that promise, he built a mansion in Cochrane in 1908 (which became the Just Home Guest Ranch in 1931 and was donated to a [[Franciscan]] order in 1948).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stmaryscochrane.ca/history.php |title=The History of St. Mary's Parish |publisher=St. Mary's Parish |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cochrane"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.shaw.ca/ruffbear/Resources.htm |title=Neighboring parks and trails |publisher=Sunterra Ridge/Cochrane Heights Community Association |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1903, [[Arthur Sifton]], the Member of the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories]] for [[Banff (N.W.T. electoral district)|Banff]] resigned to become territorial chief justice.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 23&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing by-election, held February 4, Fisher defeated H. J. Richardson to replace him. He served until the district left the Northwest Territories to become part of the new province of [[Alberta]] in 1905.&lt;ref name="by-election" /&gt;  He subsequently ran in [[Banff (provincial electoral district)|Banff]] in Alberta's [[Alberta general election, 1905|inaugural election]]. Though politics in the Northwest Territories had been conducted on a non-partisan basis, this was not the case in Alberta, and Fisher aligned himself with the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]]. In the election, he faced [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Conservative]] [[Robert Brett]], who had been Sifton's predecessor as Banff MLA from 1891 until 1899.&lt;ref name="by-election" /&gt;  He more than doubled Brett's vote count on his way to an easy victory.&lt;ref name="1905 results" /&gt;

Fisher was part of a Liberal majority of 23 seats in the 25 seat [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], and was one of only seven members with previous legislative experience. In deference to this experience, and as a reward for having beaten Brett, considered a strong opponent, he was elected the first [[Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] on March 15, 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 34&lt;/ref&gt; He was re-elected in each of the next three elections, in the new riding of [[Cochrane (provincial electoral district)|Cochrane]], and was re-elected Speaker after each of them. As Speaker, he presided over the tumultuous [[Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal]], when he ruled future premier [[Charles Stewart (Canadian politician)|Charles Stewart]] out of order in his attempt to report a scandalous rumour about fellow Liberal [[John R. Boyle]] in the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisher died May 5, 1919, a victim of the [[1918 flu pandemic]]. His death left his Cochrane seat vacant, and in the ensuing by-election the [[United Farmers of Alberta]] (UFA) ran a candidate, [[Alexander Moore (politician)|Alexander Moore]], for the first time in their history. He won, and two years later the UFA won a majority government.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 195&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Fisher is buried in Calgary's Union Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Erin |last=Carpenter |url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/oncampus/weekly/april22-05/grave-history.html |title=A grave history |publisher=[[University of Calgary]] |work=OnCampus Weekly |date=April 22, 2005 |accessdate=2009-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''citizen enterprise''' started to be used in the United States in 2008 to describe businesses that practice [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR).

==Information==
In some countries, such as Papua New Guinea, the term is used to describe companies owned by citizens of that country, rather than by foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipa.gov.pg/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=149&amp;Itemid=128 The Papua New Guinea Investment Promotion Agency - Citizen, National and Foreign Enterprises]&lt;/ref&gt;

It should not be confused with [[social enterprise]], which is a more complex notion involving origin, ownership and participation as well as objectives, activities and the use of profits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1986">The '''Corps of Military Accountants''' was a short-lived [[corps]] of the [[British Army]]. It was formed in November 1919 and disbanded in July 1925. Its members handled financial matters, although matters relating to [[Payroll|pay]] continued to be handled by the [[Royal Army Pay Corps]].

All personnel serving as Military Accountant Officers and Military Accountant Clerks transferred to the new corps.&lt;ref name=new&gt;"New Corps Of Military Accountants", ''[[The Times]]'', 25 November 1919&lt;/ref&gt; On the disbandment of the corps most of its personnel who chose to stay in the Army either reverted to their previous regiments and corps or transferred to the RAPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|house=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1925/dec/01/corps-of-military-accountants#S5CV0188P0_19251201_HOC_85|date=1 December 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appointments==
Officers, who held a minimum rank of Captain and were mostly qualified [[accountant]]s, held appointments depending on rank, although they continued to use their normal ranks in day-to-day military life.&lt;ref name=new /&gt;

*[[Colonel]] = Accountant Officer 1st Class
*[[Lieutenant-Colonel]] = Accountant Officer 2nd Class
*[[Major]] = Accountant Officer 3rd Class
*[[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] = Accountant Officer 4th, 5th or 6th Class

[[Warrant Officer]]s and [[Other ranks (UK)|Other Ranks]] held appointments as follows:&lt;ref name=new /&gt;

*[[Warrant Officer Class I]] = Accountant Sergeant Major
*[[Warrant Officer Class II]] = Accountant Quartermaster Sergeant
*[[Staff Sergeant]] = Accountant Staff Sergeant
*[[Sergeant]] = Accountant Sergeant
*[[Corporal]] = Writer Corporal
*[[Lance-Corporal]] = Writer Lance-Corporal
*[[Private (rank)|Private]] = Writer Private

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1393">The '''Daniel Pennock Democracy School''' teaches citizens and activists how to use democratic processes through people’s constitutional rights to confront corporate wrongdoing (such as by opposing [[toxic]] dumps, quarries, [[intensive animal farming|factory farms]], etc.). In addition it explores the limits of conventional regulatory organizing and offers a new organizing model that helps citizens confront the usurpation by corporations of the rights of communities, people, and the earth.

It is dedicated to the memory of Daniel Pennock, a 17-year-old boy from [[Berks County, Pennsylvania]], who died in 1995 after being exposed involuntarily to land applied [[sewage sludge]].

'''Desmond John Schonegevel''' (born 9 October 1934) is a former [[cricketer]] who played 100 matches of [[first-class cricket]] in [[South Africa]] between 1954 and 1977.

==For Orange Free State==
A solid middle-order batsman and off-spin bowler, Des Schonegevel made his first-class debut for [[Free State cricket team|Orange Free State]] in the 1954-55 season and played regularly for Orange Free State until the end of the 1964-65 season. His highest score for Orange Free State was 151 against [[Border cricket team|Border]] in 1963-64, made in a little over six hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/26/26572.html | title = Border v Orange Free State 1963-64| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate = 16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his best figures were 6 for 103 against [[Griqualand West cricket team|Griqualand West]] in 1958-59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/23/23352.html | title = Griqualand West v Orange Free State 1958-59| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate = 16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He [[Captain (cricket)|captained]] Orange Free State from 1962-63 to 1964-65. Against [[Gauteng cricket team|Transvaal B]] in 1959-60 he scored 115, adding 280 for the third wicket with his captain, [[Clive Richardson]], and setting a Currie Cup third-wicket record.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Cricketer]]'', Spring Annual, 1960, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

==For Griqualand West==
He moved to [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] in 1965 and played for [[Griqualand West cricket team|Griqualand West]] from 1965-66 until 1975-76, captaining them in 1968-69. In his third match for Griqualand West he top-scored in each innings with 79 not out and 138 not out against [[KwaZulu-Natal cricket team|Natal B]]; in the second innings he and the number 11 batsman put on an unbroken partnership of 87 to avoid defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/27/27945.html | title = Griqualand West v Natal B 1965-66| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate = 17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966-67 his 112 against Orange Free State helped Griqualand West achieve their first victory since 1959-60.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack|Wisden]]'' 1968, pp. 926–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Against the [[Australian cricket team in South Africa in 1969–70|Australians in 1969-70]] he top-scored in each innings, scoring 49 and 85, defying the Australian spin bowlers "with dour concentration", but this time Griqualand West lost by an innings.&lt;ref&gt;''Wisden'' 1971, pp. 890–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

His highest score for Griqualand West was 138 not out against Natal B, as above, and his best bowling figures were 6 for 29 against Border in 1967-68.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/29/29156.html| title = Griqualand West v Border 1967-68| publisher = CricketArchive| subscription = yes | accessdate = 17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
He co-founded Desnics Planet Sport, a sporting goods business, in Kimberley in the 1960s, and continued to manage or co-manage the business until his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Sports Trader| title=A family store that serves the whole community|date=1 April 2006|url=http://www.sportstrader.co.za/Pages/Retailers%20showcase/DesnicsSports.php|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Digital Invoice Customs Exchange (DICE)''' is a revenue protection idea developed to prevent tax evasion methods such as sales suppression in [[domestic trade]] and [[missing trader fraud]], [[transfer pricing]] in cross-[[border trade]]. As such, the implementation of this idea enables Revenue Authority to have advance notice of every commercial transaction.

Definition of the term "DICE" is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A technology-intensive tax compliance regimen for VAT/GST that utilizes invoice encryption to safeguard transactional data exchanged between seller and buyer in both domestic and import/export contexts while simultaneously notifying concerned jurisdictions of the transaction details.[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2314478]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==How it works==
A seller produces digital invoice containing minimum requirements as follows:
* Name of the seller with unique [[Taxpayer Identification Number]];
* Name of the purchaser with unique [[Taxpayer Identification Number]];
* Description of good/service;
* Unit price;
* Quantity;
* Tax rate;
* Total price with tax.

Such prepared invoice, along with proper authentication of the seller, is uploaded to the Revenue Authority server (seller's jurisdiction) using DICE protocol for safekeeping and signature processing. Based on the information provided by the seller, system will apply verifiable electronic signature and send it back in the same manner as it was received. Seller will include electronic signature received in return to finalize invoice before dispatching it to customer who may verify the content of the invoice at any time by checking the signature using Revenue Authority's or DICE's web portal.

In case customer is registered outside of the seller's jurisdiction, before signing the invoice Revenue Authority will provide notice to the other jurisdiction announcing the customer's identity and content of the invoice using DICE protocol. Given the fact that DICE is being used in another jurisdiction (meaning there is an agreement between two jurisdictions to use DICE protocol and exchange digital keys for the purpose of secure communication), the received information will be processed to acknowledge positively that customer is registered in accordance with the applicable Laws, thus the transaction is considered legal. If customer is not registered in the database of the receiving jurisdiction, invoice will not be completed with valid electronic signature.

==Benefits==
* DICE platform is based on [[open standard]];
* Secure communication between jurisdictions;
* Transparency in trade between legal entities;
* Disabling tax refund based on invalid documents;
* Verification of original invoice content available at any time;
* Taxpayer's [[audit trail]] is available at the Revenue Authority.

==Death==
[[File:112407-Harrods-DiannaDodiMemorial1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''[[Innocent Victims]]'', the second of two memorials in [[Harrods]].]]

In the early-morning hours of 31 August 1997, Diana and Fayed [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|died in a car crash]] in the [[Pont de l'Alma]] underpass, in Paris. They had stopped in Paris ''en route'' to London, after having spent nine days together on holiday in the [[French Riviera|French]] and [[Italian Riviera]]s aboard his family's yacht, the ''Jonikal''. Neither Fayed nor Diana were wearing their [[seat belt]].

Investigations by French and British police concluded that their [[chauffeur]], [[Henri Paul]], was driving under the influence of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and prescription drugs; [[paparazzi]] chasing the couple are also believed to have contributed to the accident.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Webster and Stuart Millar [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/sep/04/monarchy.paulwebster "Diana verdict sparks Fayed appeal"], ''The Guardian'', 4 September 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=Diana jury blames paparazzi and Henri Paul for her 'unlawful killing' | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1584160/Diana-jury-blames-paparazzi-and-Henri-Paul-for-her-unlawful-killing.html | accessdate=12 October 2013 | work=Daily Telegraph | date=7 April 2008 | location=London | first=Gordon | last=Rayner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fayed's father, [[Mohamed Al-Fayed]], has claimed that the couple were executed by [[MI6]] agents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article3033375.ece ''Mohamed al-Fayed: The outsider''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221135615/http://news.independent.co.uk/people/profiles/article3033375.ece |date=21 December 2007 }} The Independent, 6 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Fayed's former spokesman, [[Michael Cole (public relations)|Michael Cole]], has claimed that the couple had become engaged before their deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7182228.stm Diana and Dodi 'were engaged'] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 he co-founded the local branch of the Norwegian Fascist party [[Nasjonal Samling]] in [[Hamar]]. He became the city leader ([[Führer]]), whereas townsman [[Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie (Nazi)|Wilhelm Frimann Koren Christie]] became county leader. Compared to elsewhere in Norway, the party was relatively successful in Hamar, winning two [[municipal council (Norway)|city council]] seats in its first election outing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gjerdåker|first=Brynjulv|title=Stiftstad og bygdeby.

On 9 April 1940 Norway was [[Operation Weserübung|invaded by Nazi Germany]]. During the [[German occupation of Norway|subsequent occupation]], Fasting was installed by the Germans as mayor of Hamar on 1 January 1941. In July 1941 he was installed as chairman of [[Hamar, Vang og Furnes Kommunale Kraftselskap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandberg|first=Per-Øivind|title=Hamar-regionen Energiverk 1913–1988|year=1988|publisher=Hamar-regionen Energiverk|location=Hamar|language=Norwegian|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second World War, Fasting was removed from his positions, and was arrested in May 1945. In the post-war [[Legal purge in Norway after World War II|Norwegian legal purge]] he was tried for treason, and in [[Hamar District Court|Hamar City Court]] he was sentenced to nine years of prison in October 1946. His case was finally decided in the [[Supreme Court of Norway]] in December 1948, where his sentence was reduced to seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Gjerdåker 1998, pp. 99-100&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 1958.&lt;ref name=disn/&gt;

The '''FAO Major Fishing Areas''' are areas in the world in what the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] has divided the [[fishery]]. This definition is required for the statistical data-gathering, the management of fisheries and jurisdictional purposes. The boundaries of the areas were determined on various considerations with consulting international fishery agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/fishery/geoinfo/profiles/en FAO: Geographic profiles]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4344">A '''ghost restaurant''' (also known as a '''delivery-only restaurant''' or '''online-only restaurant''') is a food service business that serves customers exclusively through [[online food delivery]]. Without the need to interact with customers directly on the premises, ghost restaurants can offset the high cost of a delivery system with cheaper real estate and operations. 

Although restaurants typically earn more from customers who dine at the restaurant, due to the expense of operating a delivery service or the fees charged by third party delivery companies like [[Grubhub]] and Caviar, ghost restaurants have significantly lower overhead. Operating a dining room, with the real estate it requires, staff, amenities, insurance, and other expenses, is a significant cost.&lt;ref name=eater30september2016/&gt; Even restaurants with considerable to-go business traditionally dedicate the majority of their space to seating.&lt;ref name=fastcompany/&gt; As visibility, [[curb appeal]], foot traffic, and accessibility are not concerns, the kitchen can be housed in an inexpensive location that would not typically be considered desirable for a restaurant.

A single company may operate several ghost restaurants, and a single location's kitchen and staff can function as multiple branded restaurants.&lt;ref name=crains/&gt; Without a brick-and-mortar location to renovate, companies can also try out new brands and cuisines with little effort, to appeal to changing tastes and trends.&lt;ref name=crains/&gt;&lt;ref name=fastcompany/&gt;

Most of the restaurants utilize existing delivery services. For example, Green Summit, which owns several ghost restaurants in New York City and partners with Grubhub.&lt;ref name=fastcompany/&gt; Some companies incorporate their own delivery system into the business model, like the New York-based company Maple.&lt;ref name=fastcompany/&gt;&lt;ref name=kessler/&gt; Maple, which is backed by restaurateur [[David Chang]], is able to orient its business around productivity in terms of meals per hour per kitchen &amp;mdash; a metric more typical of [[fast food]] restaurants.&lt;ref name=kessler/&gt;

Several 2015 news articles exposed a sub-segment of operations they termed "ghost restaurants", which operate as unregulated, unlicensed standalone entities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelosangelesbeat.com/2015/07/have-you-missed-starry-kitchens-balls-us-too-uber-eats-is-here-to-save-us/|title=Have You Missed Starry Kitchen’s Balls?

'''Henry Adolph Frost''' (26 June 1844 – 21 July 1909) was a German-born saddler and businessman known for his association with the company which eventually produced the [[Holden]] automobile. His name may have been originally Heinrich Friedrich Adolphe Frost, but he evidently preferred "Adolph Frost".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article41029970 |title=Rhynie |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |volume=XXX, |issue=6033 |location=South Australia |date=5 March 1866 |accessdate=27 February 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}} He is early referred to as "A. Frost", and later frequently as "H. Adolph Frost"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Adolph was born in [[Hamburg]], Germany the only son of Johann Joachim Domenicus ( John ) Frost ( 31 MAR 1813 - 14 Dec 1865) and his wife Catharina Maria Louisa Juncken (March 1821 – 11 February 1905), who emigrated to South Australia on the ''Steinwaerder'' (''Steinwärder'') from Hamburg, arriving on the 12th January 1849.

They settled at [[Lyndoch, South Australia|Lyndoch]], and on completion of his schooling learned the skills of the saddler, after which he followed his trade at [[Rhynie, South Australia|Rhynie]], then around 1869 to [[Port Wakefield, South Australia|Port Wakefield]] then [[Yorketown, South Australia|Yorketown]], where he ran a lucrative business, and for a time served as mayor.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article88298261 |title=Death of Mr. H.

[[File:Holden &amp; Frost.jpg|thumb|Holden &amp; Frost, 100 Grenfell Street c. 1915]]
Around 1879 he moved to Adelaide to take a position with [[J. A. Holden]], who on 1 May 1884&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39819489 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |volume=XXXIX, |issue=8590 |location=South Australia |date=28 May 1874 |accessdate=27 February 2016 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; took him on as partner in J. A. Holden &amp; Co., which was in a precarious position financially. In August 1885 J. A. Holden sold to his son [[H. J. Holden]] and H. A. Frost his interest in the retail arm of the company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article44949108 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |volume=L, |issue=12,092 |location=South Australia |date=15 August 1885 |accessdate=28 February 2016 |page=1 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in November 1885 became '''Holden &amp; Frost'''. He sold the wholesale business and his Kensington Park mansion with its extensive grounds. Under the terms of the voluntary liquidation the company continued to operate in the premises at 100 Grenfell Street.

Under the new management the company progressed from the world of saddles and harness to motor vehicle bodies and upholstery.

'''Heat setting''' is a term used in the [[textile industry]] to describe a thermal process taking place mostly in either a steam atmosphere or a [[dry heat]] environment.  The effect of the process gives [[fiber]]s, [[yarn]]s or fabric dimensional stability and, very often, other desirable attributes like higher volume, wrinkle resistance or temperature resistance. Very often, heat setting is also used to improve attributes for subsequent processes. Yarns tend to have increased torquing just after spinning, cabling or twisting. Heat setting can influence or even eliminate this tendency to undesirable torquing. At the winding, twisting, weaving, [[tufting]] and knitting processes, an increased tendency to torquing can cause difficulties in processing the yarn. When using heat setting for carpet [[yarn]]s, desirable results include not only the diminishing of torquing but also the stabilization or fixing of the fiber thread.  Both twist stabilization and stabilization of frieze effect are results of the heat setting process.  Heat setting benefits staple yarns as well as bulked continuous filament (BCF) yarns. Heat setting often causes synthetic fibers to gain volume as well.  This volume growth is commonly described as "bulk development".  All processes using temperature and/or moisture to give textiles one of the above-mentioned attributes are known as heat setting. The term "thermal fixation" is used less frequently. In the carpet industry, the process is exclusively called "heat setting".

== Crinkling tendency ==

The crinkle tendency is due to the technological conditions of the spun [[yarn]] production
and the physical [[fiber]] properties. Above all, the "technological conditions of the
spun yarn production" means the turning moment of the thread. A twisted thread will always
try to twist when it hangs freely between two fixed points in the form of a loop. In doing this, it gives up a part of its original twist which becomes spirals whose twisting direction is opposite to the original twist direction. This development of twist in the opposite direction occurs as the twisted yarn attempts to reach equilibrium.
[[File:Power-Heat-Set-2Fadenspannun-e.jpg|thumb|diagram by Müller]]

Twisting in the opposite direction is due to the tensions resulting from the yarn twisting that Mueller indicated in the diagram of tension and pressure. The total tension acting against the twisting is increased in relation to increased
twisting due to the increasing tension and pressure of the bundle of fibres in the yarn. It may become so strong that the thread core buckles when it can no longer withstand the compressive strains. The yarn curls, meaning that the yarn tries to reach a state of equilibrium in which twists in the opposite direction from the original twist direction balance the yarn's torque.These twists are also called negative twists. In this state of equilibrium, the inner torsional tensions cancel each other out. The thread always buckles at a spot where the cross section is small due to the unevenness of the thread. During the spinning process this spot took up more twists and is therefore subjected to higher inner tensions, which ultimately break the thread core. Although thicker yarns are less twisted than fine ones, the inner tension rises opposite to the yarn size. Smaller yarn is more weakened by steaming. Further positive aspects of steaming are the reduction of curling and, at the same time, the setting of the physical properties of closeness and extension imparted to the yarn by twisting.

== The chemical process ==

There are completely different behaviors depending on the kind of yarn material. Much is known about the steaming of woolen yarns but more research is needed on the steaming behaviour of artificial fibers and cotton.

=== Wool ===

As soon as steam enters, the [[yarns]] quantity of moisture rises at once, caused by the heating of the yarn and by steam condensation. According to Speakmann the following phenomena can be seen in the stretched woolen fiber: The cystine side chains are subjected to a hydrolysis at the sulphur bridge, where cystine is dissolved into cysteine and a not yet isolated sulphonic acid.

1. Hydrogen bridges between peptide groups (polar bond)&lt;br/&gt;
2. Cystine bridge (covalent bond)&lt;br/&gt;
3. Salt bridge between two amino acids (ionic bond)&lt;br/&gt;
4. Hydrophobic bond between a valine and an isolyeine rest (non-polar bond)&lt;br/&gt;
The broken ellipse shows the part where water is displaced.]]
An ionization can be seen at the bridges that were produced from salt liberation. Due to the increase of temperature in the fibers during steaming an oscillation of the molecules is produced which leads to the bursting of the hydrogen bridges; now residual valencies are set free which are able to saturate with the dipole water. The water then acts like a lubrication between the individual molecules. Thus the bonds of the main chains between each other are dissolved by the side chains, the individual polypeptide chains can shift against each other and the tensions find their equilibrium (see illustration 4). When the steaming of the yarn is continued, new side chains are formed between the individual components of the main chains. When finally the yarn is dried, i.e. the moisture balance occurring within the yarn, salt is liberated again and hydrogen bridges are formed. Now the individual polypeptide chains can no longer be shifted against each other and the fibers regained their former closeness, however without having remarkable tensions inside.

The yarn or doubled yarn twist is set. Of course, the morphological structure of the fibers must be considered when equalizing the tensions by steaming. Since the woolen fiber very quickly gets the temperature for breaking up the hydrogen bridges and the steam for hydrolysing the cystine bridges, a relatively quick twist modification is possible which roughly corresponds to the values of an autoclave moderated yarn; however, the steaming quality of the Steamatic steaming process is much better with reference to the evenness of moisture absorption.

=== Synthetic fiber ===

[[File:Power-Heat-SettingFestigkei.svg|thumb|Fiber strength and elongation&lt;br/&gt;1. amorphous fiber domains&lt;br/&gt;2. crystalline fiber domains&lt;br/&gt;3. bonding force]]Synthetic fibers can be divided up into two fiber domains, the crystalline (organized) domain and the amorphous (unorganized) domain. In crystalline domains physical forces of attraction are acting between the closely parallel lines of [[polymer]]s. These forces acting transversely to the fiber axis make up the closeness of a fiber. If tension is applied to the fiber, these forces hinder the fiber from breaking.

In contrast, the amorphous fiber domains act like links of the fibers. They are responsible for the flexional strength of the fibers. Additionally, the amorphous fiber domains make it possible for water or dye to enter.
[[File:Power-Heat-Set-Amorphe-Fase-e.jpg|left|Properties of amorphous and crystalline fiber domains]]
During steaming, the heating of the fiber causes  its molecules to start oscillating. The increase of oscillation that can be influenced by the degree and the period of heating dissolves the electric bond forces in the fiber; at first in the amorphous domains, later in the crystalline ones and at last in the polymers. As with wool, the tensions brought in by [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] are set free. During drying or cooling of the [[fiber]], the binding forces are rebuilt without having tensions in the inner part.

The problem of [[synthetic fiber]]s is that the reduction of the binding forces only takes place between the so-called deformation point (start of changing the firm  solidified – amorphous fiber domains into a visco-elastic – easily deformable state) and the distortion point (the crystalline fiber domains change into a visco-elastic state, too) which is in a relatively high temperature range.

This is also an explanation for the fact that wool mixed with synthetic fibers is more difficult to set than pure wool. Setting synthetic fibers is only possible beyond a temperature range of 85 to 95 °C. In contrast, pure wool can set very well at these temperatures.

=== Cotton ===

In in-line steaming, cotton plays a more or less subordinate role. The exact physical or chemical process in the fiber are not well known.

== Applications in the carpet industry ==

The quality of cut pile carpets is improved significantly by a reduction of inner tensions in the yarn.  This essential benefit results from the effects of steaming and heatsetting.

=== Carpet classification ===

Carpet styles are divided into two basic types. These types are loop pile carpets and cut pile carpets. Especially for cut-pile and its variations (Saxony, shag, frieze) the heat setting process is of highest importance.

=== Tip definition (pinpoint tip definition) ===

[[File:Power-Heat-Set Tip Definition2.jpg|thumb|"Pinpoint tip definition" after Heatsetting]]
Usually, when yarn is cut, the ends fray similar to the way the ends of a braid or rope would fray when they are cut and a kind of a brush forms. This fraying must be avoided in cut-pile carpets by all means. A cut pile carpet with frayed yarn ends would have a poor appearance, a shorter life cycle and ergonomic disadvantages for the "walker" as scientific research has proven. The carpet is less elastic and doesn't absorb the steps of the user as well as a heat set carpet would. A carpet manufactured from heat set yarn is more attractive, durable and comfortable for the user.  The added value of heatset carpet is significant. Normally a heat set carpet can be identified by its grainy structure, which is called "pinpoint tip definition" in the industry. The appearance of the cut pile ends is similar to pin points.

== Current heat setting processes ==

Several different heat setting processes are known in the textile industry. The most important are presented here.

=== Autoclave heat setting ===
[[File:Autoclav 2.jpg|thumb|right|Autoclave Heatsetting]]
The oldest heat setting process is autoclave heat setting. Mostly, it is a discontinuous process.Autoclave installations use vacuum and/or pressure. Textile material is brought into the autoclave either on bobbins, in skeins or loose in a container. As nearly all autoclaves are exposed to certain pressures they are usually built in cylindrical shape and mounted horizontally. Most commonly, autoclaves are loaded and unloaded from the end of the cylinder but some may be loaded from one end and unloaded from the other end. Autoclaves mounted vertically exist but are less common.
They are mostly used for the synthetic yarns like polyester, polyethylene, poly propylene and nylons.

=== Steamatic process ===
For automation in link spinning/winding there is the so-called "in-line steamer". The first known process of this type is the Steamatic process by Resch. In this case the heat setting process happens in between the ring spinning and the winding machines. As soon as the ring spinning frame has finished spinning, the loaded bobbins are transported into the in-line steamer. Those bobbins are steamed there with a vacuum method and dried again within seconds. After steaming and drying, the bobbins are transported on to the winding machine where they are re-wound onto a cross-wound package.

The carpet industry currently utilizes two continuous processes, the Power-Heat-Set process and the TVP process which was derived from the autoclave technology.

=== Power-Heat-Set technology ===
The Power-Heat-Set process, formerly known as Suessen process, was developed in the beginning of the 1970s and was the first continuous heat setting system worldwide. The process itself was revolutionary in that it was the first system not operated with saturated steam and pressure, but with a superheated steam/airmix at atmospheric pressure. Using this innovative technology, completely new carpet collections were created. In the Power-Heat-Set process, the yarns and filaments oxidize slightly on the surface due to the existing oxygen in the surrounding atmosphere and the higher temperatures. This capillary oxide film causes the complete carpet later to be more stain resistant. Dirt particles adhere less to the fibers.

=== SUPERBA TVP process ===

In addition to the Power-Heat-Set technology there is the SUPERBA TVP3 process which is also a continuous process. In the TVP3 process yarn is placed on a conveyor belt and inserted through a lock into a pressure tunnel that could be up to 15 m long.  Inside the tunnel, it undergoes a heat setting process with saturated steam. At the end of the tunnel the yarn is taken out through a second lock. The yarn which is still hot and moist is dried and cooled after heat setting and fed to the winding process. Up to 72 yarn ends can be processed at the same time.

== Process description (exemplary with the Power-Heat-Set process) ==

[[File:Power-Heat-Set-GVA-Auslauf.jpg|thumb|Frieze and straight Yarn after Power-Heat-Setting]]
In the Power-Heat-Set process yarn is heat set with superheated steam in an open system at atmospheric pressure. All the materials normally used in the carpet industry such as polyamide 6, polyamide 6.6, polypropylene, Acrylic, PET, polyester and wool can be processed.

The unprocessed yarn is provided on packages in a creel (up to 72 packages). At a speed of up to 700 m/min, the yarn is pulled off the packages and entered into the heat setting process. There are two basic ways of transportation of the yarn through the process. One way is to place the yarn in coils or a "figure 8 pattern on a belt or to wrap it onto ropes arranged as a polygon in order to convey it through the process. With Frieze yarns only belt conveying is utilized. Frieze is produced by a special stuffer box, the so-called Twinroll-Box (TRB).
The heat setting process takes place at temperatures between 110 °C and 200 °C in a steam-air-mix. After heat setting, the yarn is cooled and wound onto packages again at the winder. In general a heat setting machine consists of six lines at eight ends (fibers) each. A daily production of up to 10.5 tons is possible.

'''Irénée du Pont I''' (December 21, 1876 – December 19, 1963) was a U.S. businessman, former president of the [[DuPont]] company and head of the Du Pont trust.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born on December 21, 1876, in [[New Castle, Delaware]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He was a descendant of [[Eleuthère Irénée du Pont]]. He graduated from [[Andover Academy]] in 1894 and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1897. While at MIT, he was a member of the [[Phi Beta Epsilon]] fraternity, where he was one of the first brothers, in the course of his lifetime, contributing over $4,000,000.

===Career===
He worked for [[Fenn's Manufacturing Contracting Company]] for a number of years before he joined DuPont. He was president of DuPont from 1919 to 1925.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; He oversaw DuPont at a time when eight workers were fatally poisoned with [[tetraethyl lead]] while he issued statements about there being "slight difficulties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bent |first=Silas |author-link=Silas Bent |date=June 22, 1925 |title=Tetraethyl Lead Fatal to Makers |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from the [[board of directors]] of [[DuPont]] in 1958.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

===Personal life===
He built a mansion in [[Varadero]], [[Cuba]], which he named ''[[Shangdu#Popular culture|Xanadu]]''. In 1957, ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' estimated his wealth at between $200 million and $400 million, making him one of the two richest members of the [[Du Pont family]] at that time, and one of the twenty richest Americans (see [[Wealthiest Americans (1957)]]). In the 1930s, he was a proponent of [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Scott Christianson]]  |coauthors= |title=The Last Gasp: The Rise and Fall of the American Gas Chamber |year=2010 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |page= |quote=Prior to 1926 DuPont was run by the U.S. industrialist Irénée du Pont, a strong supporter of eugenics, right-wing political groups, and IG Farben. ... | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIzaoHoggUwC&amp;pg=PA97 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jürg Marquard''' (born 13 July 1945 in [[Zürich]]) is a [[Swiss]] publisher. He attended school in Zürich, where he became involved in journalism at a young age. Having done his leaving certificate (Matura) at the “Kantonsschule” for Economics in Zürich, he launched the youth magazine “POP” with SFR 2'000., which he borrowed from school friends. This founded the basis of his journalistic and entrepreneurial career.

At that time Jürg Marquard already sensed that the flourishing pop and rock culture was not just a fly-by-night phenomenon, but also a strong youth movement with revolutionary potential. He sensed this movement would embrace a large spectrum beyond the music and entertainment industry, such as fashion, lifestyle, culture and that it would even penetrate politics.

At the same time as putting his magazine “POP” on the map, Jürg Marquard was also working as a radio and TV presenter, specialising in pop music. He was the first presenter of the Radio-Hit-Parade to achieve great popularity in Switzerland.

==A successful entry into the German-speaking magazine market==

After the eventful early days, in which Jürg Marquard himself edited the magazine with a lot a passion, the magazine became a commercial success. After various mergers with other German youth magazines, POP became POP/ROCKY, which was Germany's second largest youth magazine for many years. POP/ROCKY maintained this status for decades until it was eventually merged with POPCORN in 1998. POPCORN was one of Marquard Media’s international [[umbrella brand]]s.

His big breakthrough in the German-speaking magazine market was achieved with the takeover of COSMOPOLITAN in 1981. Before then the German version of COSMOPOLITAN had been dragging its feet without any noticeable success. With radical editorial changes he turned COSMOPOLITAN into a huge success in less than a year. COSMOPOLITAN led the way for a new type of women's magazine. When taking over COSMOPOLITAN on October 14, 1981, Jürg Marquard said: "I believe in the future of this brand because recent years have brought about deep changes with regards to the self-image and the role behaviour of women. COSMOPOLITAN is the journalistic answer to these changes. The success is therefore pre-determined." COSMOPOLITAN subsequently became the most successful premium women’s magazine in the German-speaking market and therefore the basis for the expansion of the premium lifestyle segment of the Marquard Media Group.

==The internationalisation of Marquard Media==

In 1988 Jürg Marquard launched the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] versions of POPCORN and MÄDCHEN (Girl). With these launches he became the first western publisher of periodical magazines behind the then still existing “Iron Curtain”. The big success as well as the positive perspectives after the political change made Jürg Marquard invest dynamically in Central European markets and expand his activities – including the acquisition of daily newspapers in Hungary and Poland, as well as launching new magazines. In 1999, during the process of a strategic re-orientation, Jürg Marquard focused his activities on the premium magazine segment and therefore streamlined his portfolio: The youth and music titles were sold to Axel Springer, the Hungarian newspapers to Ringier and the Polish printing house to Baring Private Equity Partners. Following this phase of consolidation Marquard Media again expanded by launching various new magazines as well as taking over and integrating VIPress (PLAYBOY und VOYAGE) in [[Poland]]. In summer 2005, Marquard Media with a successful public offer, secured a 91,4% stake in Computec Media AG, a stock exchange listed publisher of various consumer magazines in the area of Electronic Entertainment and Multi-Media.

In 2005 Jürg Marquard was the co-producer and protagonist of the TV show „Traumjob“, a licensed version of Donald Trumps „The Apprentice“. This was a top-rated show on Kanal 1 on Swiss television.

===Marquard Media today===

In 2012, Marquard Media published 41 magazines in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Hungary and Poland. It is currently active with license editions in many other countries. The ever-growing online business encompasses 25 websites in the German-speaking markets.

In Hungary, Marquard Media is the leading publisher of premium magazines in the women’s as well as the men’s segment with a wide-ranging portfolio: JOY, EVA, INSTYLE, SHAPE, JOY CELEBRITY, FITT MAMA, PLAYBOY, PLAYBOY EXCLUSIVE, CKM and DESIGN ROOM.

Marquard Media continues to expand in the premium magazine segment in Poland. With CKM and PLAYBOY, it is the leading publisher in the men’s segment and also holds a top position in the women’s premium segment with COSMOPOLITAN, JOY, OLIVIA and SHAPE as well as with the travel magazine VOYAGE. Marquard Media is also successfully represented in the segment of weekly women’s magazines and true-stories magazines in Poland with PANI DOMU, CIENIE I BLASKI und SEKRETY SERCA.

Jürg Marquard plans to keep expanding his company. Further expansion is occurring via new launches, as well as further acquisitions.

The '''Kohler strikes''' at the [[Kohler Company]], just west of [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin]] in 1934 and 1954 are landmarks in the history of both business and labor in the United States. Labor leaders have often cited the warfare at the giant plumbing supply company in their contention that workers need unions. Industrial leaders have pointed to the [[Strike action|strike]]s as examples of union belligerence and indifference toward the true welfare of their employees.

==Strike of 1934==
The Kohler Company was founded in Sheboygan, Wisconsin in 1873, when [[John Michael Kohler]] II (1844–1900) took over his father-in-law's steel and iron factory. During the late 19th century it prospered as the producer of plumbing products and enamelware. In 1912, land around a new factory just west of Sheboygan became the Village of [[Kohler, Wisconsin]]. From 1905 until his death, John Michael's son [[Walter J. Kohler, Sr.]] (1875–1940) led the highly successful business. In the early 1920s, he built a family mansion, Riverbend, and was welcomed in high society in [[Chicago]] and elsewhere. In 1928, he became [[Governor of Wisconsin]] for a single term.

In the Great Depression, company profits plummeted. The [[American Federation of Labor]] turned its attention on Kohler in the spring of 1934, demanding that the AFL replace the [[company union]], the Kohler Workers Association, which had been formed a year earlier, with an independent [[labor union]]. In June, AFL leaders called for a 62.5% wage increase and a 25% reduction in hours. Walter strongly opposed this bid for power and closed the plant. On July 16, a strike began.

Violence quickly erupted and the entire Village was closed to traffic. Special deputies hired by the company clashed with pickets, and huge crowds began to assemble. On July 27, purportedly in response to vandalism against company property, the special deputies attacked with guns and tear gas.  Two strikers named Lee Wakefield and Harry Englemann were killed, and 47 "men, women and boys were wounded, gassed, and injured".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Troops Restore Peace"|url=http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/ref/collection/tp/id/64315|accessdate=24 March 2016|agency=Sheboygan Press|date=June 28, 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On July 29, in response to appeals by Walter and the local sheriff, 250 members of the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] arrived on the scene. Walter, who had been trapped in the main office building for 12 days, blamed the violence on outsiders and people with "communistic affiliations."

In September, the [[National Labor Relations Board]] ruled against the Kohler Company and demanded secret, supervised elections at the plant to determine who would represent the workers, which the company union won. The Kohler victory was short-lived, however, for in 1935 the [[US Supreme Court]] declared the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] unconstitutional. Congress soon, however, passed the [[Wagner Act]], giving organized labor the right to organize and bargain collectively without employer interference. A majority of workers could now determine who would represent them; this "[[union shop]]" was the chief goal of the AFL. Still, the company union and the principle of "[[open shop]]" remained in effect at the Kohler Company until 1952, when the [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW) won an election.

==Strike of 1954==
During the Second World War, [[Herbert V. Kohler, Sr.]] (1891–1968) gained control of the Kohler Company. He was a physically and mentally powerful man best known for his supreme self-confidence and iron will. He had played a key role in the strike of 1934 and was a staunch opponent of organized labor.

The [[United Auto Workers]] Local 833 was determined to organize Kohler employees, and it won a certified election in 1952. Herbert V. Kohler refused to grant union demands during contract negotiations, and a strike began on April 5, 1954. Some 2,800 of the Company's 3,300 employees joined the picket lines. The plant essentially ceased operations for two months. Herbert then resumed production with non-union labor. Six years of sporadic violence ensued between strikers and strike breakers. In time, the company would charge opponents with more than a thousand acts of vandalism. At one point, more than 300 people were arrested. Calls for a national boycott of Kohler products were vociferous and sometimes effective, and UAW provided $12 million to strikes over the years. Herbert resisted all efforts to compromise, even sharply rejecting a public appeal from his nephew, Governor [[Walter J. Kohler, Jr.]].

In 1960, the National Labor Relations Board decided against the Kohler Company, ruling that it had refused to bargain in good faith after the strike broke out. Herbert was ordered to reinstate 1,700 workers. It took lawsuits by both sides and two more years for management and labor to work out a contract. The bitter issue of compensation for strikers remained unresolved. In December 1965, the Kohler Company agreed to pay $3 million in back wages to some 1,400 former employees and hand over $1.5 million in pension-fund contributions. The union agreed to make no further charges stemming from the strike. The longest major strike in American history had ended.&lt;ref name="Reeves"&gt;Thomas C. Reeves, Distinguished Service: The Life of WisconsinGovernor Walter J. Kohler, Jr. (Marquette University Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Uphoff"&gt;Walter H.

After Herbert's death, his son [[Herbert Kohler, Jr.|Herbert V. Kohler, Jr.]] (1939-) headed the family-owned company and took a more positive approach to labor relations. In 2002, for example, a five-year labor contract was signed.&lt;ref name="Kohler.com"&gt;http://www.kohler.com/pr/news/contract.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, the long and often bloody struggle scarred thousands of lives throughout the Sheboygan-Kohler area and elsewhere for more than three decades.&lt;ref name="Wisconsin History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/turningpoints/search.asp?id=1525 |title="All my life my Daddy's been on Strike to make my future better:" The Kohler Worker's Story - Wisconsin Historical Society |publisher=Wisconsinhistory.org |date=1954-04-05 |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Strike of 1983==
The third strike, which occurred in 1983 and lasted 16 days, saw car windows smashed by demonstrators and two union members injured by a motorist who drove his vehicle through a picket line.

==Strike of 2015==

On November 15, 2015, 94% of the UAW Union Local 833 membership rejected the contract proposal and voted to strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kohler Company Strike, Day 1|url=http://www.publicsafety.photos/KohlerStrike/Day1/|website=Wisconsin Public Safety Photo Library|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=94% vote in favor: Union workers at Kohler Company are now on strike|url=http://fox6now.com/2015/11/15/94-vote-in-favor-union-workers-at-kohler-company-are-now-on-strike/|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=WITI-FOX6 News|date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strike, the first at the company since 1983, was declared after paper-ballot voting by an estimated 1,800 union members attending a meeting at [[Sheboygan South High School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kohler workers reject offer, OK first union strike at company since 1983|url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/kohler-workers-appear-to-reject-offer-setting-up-first-union-strike-since-1983-b99616441z1-349915121.html|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=November 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At issue is a two-tiered employee system that was established in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kohler seeks two-tier wage system, more use of 'flexible' workers|url=http://www.jsonline.com/business/104284268.html|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=October 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Libertarian management''' is participative and/or non-authoritarian self-management, which typically emphasizes repetition of proven successes, institutional learning, and earmarking funds to project investment. Libertarian consultants generally focus on management and system productivity, not worker productivity.  Libertarian management exponents believe the method can be applied beyond industrial settings in areas such as alternate family arrangements, [[co-housing]], and the [[cooperative]] movement.

While no text on the subject exists, libertarian management has been highly influential as a guiding concept among American Libertarian founders of [[intentional communities]] and American management productivity [[consultant]]s. Noted proponents of libertarian management include [[W. Edwards Deming]] and [[Peter Drucker]]. Many companies use the concepts and techniques of libertarian management, some of which are listed below.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Libertarian management and the US Libertarian Party==

The last three chairs{{which?|date=April 2014}} of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|United States Libertarian Party]] have worked as management consultants. Members of the Party often{{quantify|date=April 2014}} refer to organizations using Libertarian management as "do-cracies" - systems which emphasize decision-making by the initiators and implementers (i.e. doers) of a [[project]].  Typically, decisions in such a do-ocracy come about through a [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]] process.

==Concepts of libertarian management==

* Desirable definition processes
* User [[co-operatives]]
* Building quality in
* [[Learning circles]]
* Thinking squares
* Emoting trapezoids
* Philosophizing ellipses
* [[Gainsharing]]
* [[Modular businesses]]
* [[Open source]]
* [[Business process reengineering|Re-engineering]]
* Bottom-up [[strategic planning]]
* Tactical [[best practices]]
* [[Open-book management]] and learning
* Detailed activity and task lists and standards
* [[Outcome metrics]]
* Short interval check scheduling and control
* Management by worker created objectives
* Self-managing task creation and assignment
* [[Goal analysis]]
* [[Management engineering]]
* Re-[[privatization]] of government services
* Standards definition and organization
* [[Prototyping]]
* [[Internal markets]]

==History==

===  MUFG Bank, Ltd.===
[[File:UnionBank of California.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The former Union Bank logo used from 1996 prior to the 2008 rebranding.]]
In 1914, [[Kaspare Cohn]] founded Kaspare Cohn Commercial &amp; Savings Bank in [[Los Angeles]]. It was renamed Union Bank &amp; Trust Company of Los Angeles in 1918. In 1979, Union Bank was purchased by [[Standard Chartered]]. Meanwhile, the [[Bank of Tokyo]] established the Bank of Tokyo California in 1953 in [[San Francisco]]. In 1975, Bank of Tokyo California purchased San Diego's Southern California First National Bank, shortening its name to California First. Four years later Bank of Tokyo California, via California First, took over Union Bank and adopted its name. 

In May 1996, [[Mitsubishi Bank]] and the [[Bank of Tokyo]] merged in Japan. In San Francisco, the [[Bank of California]] and Union Bank consolidated into UnionBanCal Corporation, a bank holding company, and its primary subsidiary Union Bank of California, N.A. With the merger, Union Bank could now trace its history back to the founding of the Bank of California 132 years before. In 1999, UnionBanCal Corporation became a publicly traded company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE:UB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unionbank.com/company_information/company_information/company_profile/history_and_timeline.jsp|title=Corporate Profile - History and Timeline |publisher=Union Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 19, 2004, the Federal Reserve Board announced that Union Bank had entered into a written agreement to avoid criminal prosecution for money-laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/enforcement/2004/20041019/default.htm|title=FRB: Press Release--Written agreement with Union Bank of California International--October 19, 2004|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, Union Bank was again accused of money-laundering and in September, 2007, the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department announced that Union Bank had agreed to pay $31.6 million in penalties and forfeitures to settle government claims that it had been implicated in an elaborate drug money laundering scheme involving Mexican exchange houses known as casas de cambio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/09/17/banking-money_laundering-biz-wall-cz_nv_0917laundering.html|title=UnionBanCal's Drug Money Problem - Forbes|first=Nathan|last=Vardi|date=17 September 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, Mitsubishi UFJ offered to buy the 35 percent of Union Bank it did not already own, which Union Bank accepted.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Economist]] August 23, 2008 edition. U.S. edition. Page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
On November 4, 2008, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (BTMU), a wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), announced that BTMU had successfully acquired all of the outstanding shares of UnionBanCal Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/business/worldbusiness/19bank.html?emc=rss&amp;partner=rssnyt | work=The New York Times | title=Japanese Bank Buys Rest of UnionBanCal | date=August 19, 2008 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, MUFG integrated the U.S. operations of its subsidiary The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (BTMU) with those of San Francisco-based Union Bank, N.A.&lt;ref name="MUFGAmericas"&gt;[http://mufg-americas.com/who-we-are Welcome to MUFG Americas]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (BTMU) was renamed to MUFG Bank, Ltd.&lt;ref name="MUFGAmericas"&gt;[http://mufg-americas.com/who-we-are Welcome to MUFG Americas]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ND-NOTIS''' was a tightly integrated yet modular office automation suite by [[Norsk Data]] introduced in the early 80s, running on the [[SINTRAN III]] platform on both [[ND-100]] and [[ND-500]] architectures. It was also available on MS Windows running in networks of Norsk Data servers.

It was very successful, and was the main product line of the company for quite a while, cementing its position in the Norwegian government [[office automation]] market. It was also very popular in Germany and in the UK (local municipality, DHSS etc.) 

The NOTIS family of products was presented to the British Computing Society by Jeremy Salter. Roger Tagg et al. (BCS, End User SG, 1985) and endorsed as the BCS model for user interface. The same endorsement was awarded to NOTIS-IR as a model for information storage and retrieval. the European Commission published in 1985 NOTIS-IR as reference model for document and information search and retrieval.

Where it was offered it had no real competitors. There are still features and functionality that no other system supports - such as multilingual input and search.

Norsk Data also sold custom-made [[Tandberg Data]] [[TDV-2200]] terminals as "NOTIS terminals" with special keys for text editing. Other terminals were "endorsed", provided new keycaps and branded as "NOTIS Terminals" - including the Facit "Twist" - that would show a page standing.

Components included:
; NOTIS-WP
: '''NOTIS''' '''W'''ord '''P'''rocessor, a full text editing environment optimized for word processing.
; NOTIS-DS
: '''NOTIS''' '''D'''ocument '''S'''tore, a database of documents based on the [[SIBAS]] database.
; NOTIS-BS
: '''NOTIS''' '''B'''ackup '''S'''ystem, an advanced system used for automated and incremental backups of a DS document store.
; NOTIS-ID
: '''NOTIS''' mail system. Proprietary e-mail system. It was later interfaced to Notis-Mail (see below).
; NOTIS-Mail
: '''NOTIS''' full [[X.400]] e-mail system, including a [[X.500]] based directory service (implemented using [[SIBAS]]) and TCP/IP based SMTP mail. This provided HTML formatted messages in from 1985.
; NOTIS-TF
: '''NOTIS''' '''T'''ext '''F'''ormatter, a text formatting system.
; NOTIS-RG
: '''NOTIS''' '''R'''eport '''G'''enerator, a powerful data extracting and modifying system. Often used together with database systems like SIBAS, Mimer or Oracle.
; NOTIS-RP
: '''NOTIS''' '''R'''eport '''P'''roducer, closely integrated with NOTIS-RG.
; NOTIS-CALC
: '''NOTIS''' Spreadsheet program, similar to VisiCalc and later successors like Microsoft Excel
; NOTIS-ENCRYPT
: '''NOTIS''' Encryption software.
; NOTIS-IR
: '''NOTIS''' '''I'''nformation '''R'''etrieval, a document database with free text search allowing full multi-site search.
; NOTIS-QL
: '''NOTIS''' Database query and application generation program, also called "Access-1" predecessor to MS Access.

==General==

'NOTIS''&lt;ref&gt;NOTIS=http://www.ndwiki.org/wiki/Virtual_library&lt;/ref&gt;''' was unique then and still is. It captured the notion of different user interfaces, or terminals; and managed a common user interface for all applications that used the platform. So a key on the keyboard would in all applications "mean" the same. 

It relied on an interface system "User Environment" to hold in one place all user profile and preferences. That is everything from log-in name and password, language preference, application skills and user rights to see, edit and change document - or data in applications. It came as a full "Document management" package, with full support for workflow - which was used by 3rd party application software. 

Another first was multi-lingual support, - also part of the user interface. Regardless of where you logged on, the system would know of your preferences, and allow you to resume last task. The system also supported full editing from right to left. All deliveries to the Norwegian public sector required capability to use three language, and that in the same office, all three languages would be used, even in the same document. So to sell in its main market, it need multilingual support. That included all messages, error messages and user interaction. The error messages could also be adapter from "novice" to "expert".

An important "first" was the full support for SGML - or "S-code". This allow the text editor to be used to edit and view the first HTML documents created - on hardware running NOTIS. The alternate character set - "T-code" was the CCITT, now ITU T.56 standard character set - used in all television sets to show teletext/"Text TV". So, the systems had full support for semi-graphical input and display, but just a few terminals supported this. Beware that an important customer was CERN, where they at the end of the 1980s worked on what you are now using - the WWW. ND-NOTIS had full support for HTML at that time. 

The main "first" - WYSIWYG - What you see is what you get. In 1983, most text editors used "codes" that had to be inserted in the text, like "^p" meaning "paragraph.Even in the early days of text editors on Windows, most text systems were like that. However, NOTIS-WP, would show where the line ended and a new page started for a long time. The "Symbolic Graphic Markup Language" was developed as an international standard, and version 2 of this is the "Extended SGML" or XML that is approved by ODMA. 

The "back-end" to all these modules were also flexible. You had direct file system exposure - that included network mounted files. However, with ''NOTIS-DS'' it included "Document Storage" and management - a full Electronic Document Management System (as found in systems such as Documentum and OpenText's Livelink today). The EDMS was based on a generic software interface, but only SIBAS was used commercially. This allowed fully localisation transparent document storage and retrieval. That of course demanded NOTIS-IR to search in all the documents. Software today used to power both Google and Altavista.

NOTIS-ID was a "special" NOTIS-DS, with restricted functionality, in that this would interface to "mail" exchanges only. So if you stored a document to an email-recipient, you sent an email. Likewise, if you received an email, this would appear in your mail-count, and you could read it in NOTIS-WP like any other document.

Norsk Data needed ''NOTIS'' to avoid duplicating applications. So the software was used in professional text production systems, for newspaper and magazine production - by "NORTEXT". It was reviewed a number of times here and found to be "best of breed" by e.g. the Seybold Report on newspaper systems. Hence demanding users were close to the developers - which may explain the success.

==Applications beside Text and Document Management==

The list here will become endless since '''NOTIS''' was linked to three application generators - beside the Query part. All of these were fully capable of making large applications system, that could also update databases. The most successful link was to "Unique" - an application package developed outside Norsk Data to support SIBAS but later was enhanced to interface to a number of RDBMS. Unique was successful in the UK, implementing systems for the DHSS and local municipalities. The other platforms were "BIM" (Business Information Systems) and "ABM" (Application Building and Maintenance). A full interface was made to "Systemator" to provide full support to newspaper systems generated by this. Norsk Data marketed and sold the system as integrated with their offerings for the medical sector ("Infomedica") and hospital systems;- for local community in Scandinavia and the UK based on Unique(i.e.DIALOGUE-1); - for engineering documentation in Europe: CAD/CAM as Technovision and even to the F-16 Flight Simulator.

NOTIS-QL - also marketed by Norsk Data as "Access-1" (and presented to Microsoft under this name - so you wonder with very good reason), is still commercially available as "[http://www.sysdeco.no/default.aspx?Main=Products&amp;Sub=QBEVision QBEvision]". It has also been licensed under several names with full product sold by CA.

'''The NOTIS family was fully ported to Microsoft Windows''', but was incredibly difficult to move with its huge customer base. For a time there were plans to include "Ami" into the family, to gain some market momentum - but its very difficult to move when your users do not want to make the change and are so happy with the way things are.

The ''NOTIS'' family was ported to Norsk Data NDIX [[Unix]] line, but here suffered because Unix had problems with coping with the key sequences required ([[terminfo]]/[[termcap]] was incomplete compared to the proprietary "VTM".). This is still used in [http://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-T.55/en telecommunication], all SMS messages use this character set.

==External==

The NOTIS way of sorting was included in the first version of Sybase, which was acquired by Microsoft as DS1. This taught Microsoft to arrange sort sequences in Windows according to national character sets ("codepage").

NOTIS-WP was the testbed for SGML and HTML. A very visible remedy of NOTIS-WP is the font size parameter in HTML today: 1 for tiny 5 for huge right out of NOTIS-WP.

There is still no other system available that will grant you "only one user interface and make all into one system". You have to fill in the expense report in Oracle HR and type the letter summarising the reason for the expense in some other text editor. With Notis, you clicked on field for providing the information, and WP would fire up, allowing you to write the letter - not as in Wikipedia where you have to supply own mark-up, but with the document template ready. The complete document would then be stored in the application database, with the expense report data.

'''Lert Sreshthaputa''' ({{lang-th|เลิศ เศรษฐบุตร}}), or '''Nai Lert''' ({{lang|th|นายเลิศ}}, literally "Mr. Lert"), was known as a Thailand’s first and foremost developer, investor as well as preserver of Bangkok’s environment. He was royally bestowed a title “Beloved Millionaire” by [[King Rama VI]] and became known as [[Phraya]] Bhakdi Noraset.

==Early life==
Nai Lert was born at his family’s home near the foot of Wat Bophitphimook Bridge at the mouth of Klong Ong Ang on June 22, 1872. He came from a distinguished background; his father, Chuen Sreshthaputra, was one of the sons of [[Thai royal and noble titles|Luang]] Prasertwanit and a nephew of [[Phra]] Prasertwanit, who was the founder of the Sresthatputra family. After an education at Suan Ananta School that included a study of the English language Nai Lert started working for various firms and ended up becoming partner at the Singapore Strait Company (later to become [[Fraser and Neave]]) by the age of 20.

==Business ventures==
At the age of 22, Nai Lert started an imported goods business called Nai Lert Store and among other products offered the first ice to be made in Thailand. The site for Nai Lert's Ice works which faced the original canal that subsequently was filled in to become Krungthep-Samut Prakan Road in 1939  is now in the area of Sukhumvit Rd between Soi 5 &amp; 7 (for which both Sois bear the name Soi Nai Lert).. Parts of the original ice works dating back to the early 1900s form part of the back wall of The Copacabana club (built in 1957) which was one of the original multi-story buildings in the Wattana area. The original doors and cellar entrances were re-discovered in 2016 during renovations to the well known nightclub which was renamed Checkinn99.  The distinguished Scholar [[Phraya]] Anuman Rajdhon would later on describe the exciting novelty of ice as "Most people who had never seen it refused to believe that there was such a thing as frozen water. Ice had to be put on a tray and exhibited for the people to see at a museum which was then in the Sala Sahathai building. Some people even asked to take small cubes of ice for those at home to see. The old saying 'to make a solid shape out of water,' had been proved possible."

Though Nai Lert continued to make his headquarters near the original shop, he soon expanded into other businesses in other parts of the city. One was a guesthouse called the Hotel de la Paix thereby creating the first hotel property of the family business. Nai Lert also expanded his business into a transportation and real estate empire. He introduced the first bus services in Thailand in 1907 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmta.co.th/en/about_history.php Credit to Nai Lert on Bangkok Mass Transit Authority website]&lt;/ref&gt; to serve Bangkok commuters and later expanded the business into the first taxi service using imported cars, the White Boat company operating pleasure boats, seagoing vessels and a public transportation service along the Klong Saen Saep from Pratunam. He is also credited for creating the first Bangkok bus service launching an even more innovative venture, the White Bus Company. The first route
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2bangkok.com/2bangkok/Tram/writers.shtml Yotse line described in Bangkok Tramway and buses accounts from famous writers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106144714/http://www.2bangkok.com//2bangkok/Tram/writers.shtml |date=2009-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ran between Pratunam and Yotse Bridge near Wat Thepsirin on Klong Padung Krung Kasem; later several other routes were added, including one to Silom Road. A novel convenience to commuters from the countryside was the fact that passengers travelling by ferry could use the same ticket when transferring to the bus at Pratunam.

Nai Lert was also at the origin of the development of the [[Ploenchit]] area where he acquired a large piece of land in 1915 and created one of the first developments in Bangkok by master planning the area and selling off parts of the land as individual plots including the existing British Embassy site on Ploenchit which was sold to the British Government in 1922

== Business career ==

Soon after his retirement from the law enforcement, Nikolai Brykin became the founder of the "Southern Breeze" LLC (TIN 2302055962), registered on October 12, 2007, in Krasnodar Krai &lt;ref&gt;Information [http://infobroker.ru/organisations/1487126 from the infobroker.ru website (In Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;. According to the official list of activities, the company works in the real estate, construction, and other related business fields, including railway communication  &lt;ref&gt;Information [https://egrul.nalog.ru/ of the Federal Tax Service (EGRUL) (In Russian) ]&lt;/ref&gt;. As of 2013, this company owned 98 lots of land&lt;ref&gt; Decision [http://kad.arbitr.ru/PdfDocument/72fdfd3d-551d-42f0-8ffb-5196b704e56c/414134c0-4779-4e59-bef1-78656cd47ff1/A32-7642-2013_20130906_Reshenija_i_postanovlenija.pdf  of the Arbitration Court of Krasnodar Krai (In Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt; near Novorossiysk, Krasnodar Krai. It is known that the said land property was the subject of legal disputes between the Southern Breeze LLC and the local authorities &lt;ref&gt; File [http://kad.arbitr.ru/Card/72fdfd3d-551d-42f0-8ffb-5196b704e56c of the case in the registry of Arbitration Affairs of the Russian Federation (In Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In October 2015, Brykin acted as the co-founder of the newly-established Bahus LLC (INN 2315985475), also registered in the Krasnodar Krai. The registration documents of the company specify 81 various activities, including grape farming, construction, woodworking, retail and wholesale trade of the various goods, etc. &lt;ref&gt;Information [https://egrul.nalog.ru/ of the Federal Tax Service (EGRUL) (In Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In May 2016, Brykin sold his business assets to his daughter. &lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.kompromatural.ru/volodin-kreml-genprokuratura-deputat-bryikin-rassledovanie … Коммерческие следы и интересы представителя Госдумы в Верховном суде Николая Брыкина (In Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt; Later he announced his decision to participate in the primaries of United Russia in the Tyumen region, and the elections into the State Duma. 

== Criticism ==

The most controversial incident was reflected by the numerous publications both in mainstream media and in blogs. According to the information available in the media, Nikolai Brykin, with the help of his son-in-law Sergei Kiryanov, tried to capture a share in a company owned by the businessman and the opposition member [[Konstantin Dyulgerov]] &lt;ref&gt;A set of publications [https://dyulgerov.info/ru/press-ru on Konstantin Dyulgerov’s case]&lt;/ref&gt;. Dyulgerov claims that he was forced to pay Brykin and his accomplices for "protection" for quite a long time. As soon as he decided to refuse the "protection", they initiated the criminal proceedings against him, with investigation lasting several years &lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.moscow-post.com/politics/pod_krylom_prokurorskix_mozhno_tvorit_chto_ugodno20933/ by moscow-post.com (In Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 2004 to 2006, Brykin was the head of the Economic Tax Crime Bureau of the Far Eastern Federal District. In 2006, the Presidential Decree removed him from his post. He retired with the rank of Major General. According to one of the theories available in the media, the true reason for Brykin's dismissal was his personal interest in one of the high-profile cases of large-scale fraud. Brykin's subordinates carried out the investigation negligently and contributed to its collapse &lt;ref&gt;The news about [http://www.1sn.ru/6973.html the N. G. Brykin' dismissal on IA SakhaNews (In Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Brykin, being the general director of Russian Fuel Company (OJSC Rostopprom), by virtue of the position held, directly participated in its bankruptcy. His actions as the general director of OJSC Rostopprom, as well as the surety documents signed by him, ultimately led to the bankruptcy of a previously successful state-owned company. Several powerful clans showed interest in seizing control over Rostoprom at that time &lt;ref&gt;Article [http://www.business-vector.info/?p=10095 «Миллиарды в угольной корзине Ростоппрома» by АДН «Бизнес-вектор» (In Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2016, during the pre-election period, Brykin, according to available information, used various methods to negotiate a deal with major media companies in the region. He wanted to remove any negative information regarding his life and activities, as well as to provide exclusively positive news about him, even concerning minor events. Some media outlets received "warnings" when they refused to cooperate. As a result of this, the regional information field was partially "cleaned up". However, some of the publications on the Internet remained &lt;ref&gt;[https://rusevik.ru/news/348628 Article «Кандидат Н.Брыкин препятствует работе СМИ?» by rusevik.ru (In Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In September 2017, passed the year since Nikolay Brykin became the member of the State Duma. The output of his legislative activities was analyzed, based on official sources. According to the information of the State Duma, Nikolai Brykin participated in the development of 29 draft laws, however, he joined the development only after the draft laws have been already submitted for the discussion. Brykin acted as one of the primary initiators only once, as one of 11 co-authors of the amendment to one of the paragraphs of the federal law. In addition, according to the transcript of the State Duma, Brykin gave only 33 speeches per year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duma.gov.ru/structure/deputies/1756768/ Information about deputy N. Brykin on the State Duma of Russia website. (In Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt; And most of them were remarks from a place, which lasted for 10-20 seconds, and mostly expressed the opinion of the committee in which he participates ("the committee recommends acceptance", or "the committee recommends rejecting the bill”).&lt;ref&gt;Video [http://www.video-duma.ru/deputy/show/?id=1267 of N. Brykin's speeches on "Video-Duma" website. (In Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt; Deputy Brykin also did not participate in the voting on more than a thousand issues. And when he participated, he only voted "for" the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Article [https://www.pravda.ru/news/politics/authority/22-09-2017/1349111-deputat-0/ by pravda.ru (In Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt; These factors determined the low evaluation of Brykin's work as a deputy, given by the media.

Since August 2017, Nikolay Brykin used his deputy powers to protect the interests of Bank Yugra, which had its licence suspended and later withdrawn by the Central Bank of Russia. Brykin's lobbyism included sending the deputy requests to various instances, including the General Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation and frequent public statements. Some media viewed this as an attempt to exert pressure on the court and the Central Bank .&lt;ref&gt;Detailed [https://dyulgerov.info/ru/news-ru/121-biografiya-brykin-nikolaj-gavrilovich biography of Nikolai Brykin]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017, the Moscow Arbitration Court adopted a decision on the complaint of Bank Yugra in which the decision of the supervisory authority to revoke the license was disputed &lt;ref&gt;News [https://www.rbc.ru/finances/18/12/2017/5a37eb909a7947796ead2794) on RBC website. (In Russian)]&lt;/ref&gt;. In accordance with the court decision &lt;ref&gt;The decision [http://kad.arbitr.ru/Card/be007594-a028-46be-abdf-b83111e76b92 in the registry of Arbitration Affairs of the Russian Federation (In Russian) ]&lt;/ref&gt;, the stance of the Central Bank was recognized as lawful and justified, and the claims of Yugra were not a subject to satisfaction.

In the late 2011, Pedro Noel along with other journalists started the [[Associated Whistleblowing Press]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Andersen|first=Anna|title=Shine a light|url=http://grapevine.is/Home/ReadArticle/Shine-A-Light|publisher=Reykavik Grapevine|accessdate=19 May 2013|location=Reykjavik}}&lt;/ref&gt; a media agency focused on the defense of human rights by promoting transparency, freedom of information and speech, whistleblowing and investigative journalism, conceived as a global network made up of cooperative local platforms and actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Veal|first=Lowana|title=Alternative to Wikileaks Arises in Iceland|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/09/alternative-to-wikileaks-arises-in-iceland/|publisher=IPS International Press News|accessdate=19 May 2013|location=Reykjavik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the editor of AWP, Pedro Noel took part in more than 50 revelations of wrongdoing, corruption and abuse in [[Spain]], [[Mexico]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]] and [[Iceland]], since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=AWP - Publications |url=https://data.awp.is|publisher=AWP|accessdate=1 Jan 2016|location=Brussels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Denouncing freedom of expression violations in Ecuador and Latin America ==

In a controversial session at 32nd [[Chaos Communication Congress]] in Hamburg in 2015, Noel held a talk with Canadian journalist [[Bethany Horne]] denouncing violations of free speech standards by the Ecuadorian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noel|first=Pedro|title=Ecuador: how an authoritarian government is fooling the entire world |url=https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7134-ecuador_how_an_authoritarian_government_is_fooling_the_entire_world|publisher=CCC|accessdate=28 Dec 2015|location=Hamburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the talk, Pedro Noel released documents providing evidence that press and media coverage of critical issues were considered by Ecuadorian government as risk factors for democratic stability&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noel|first=Pedro|title=Reporte de la Inteligencia Ecuatoriana (SENAIN) sobre factores de riesgo y amenazas a la estabilidad democrática |url=https://ecuadortransparente.org/publicaciones/senain/amenazas/|publisher=Associated Whistleblowing Press (AWP)|accessdate=28 Dec 2015|location=Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the local platform [[Ecuador Transparente]], operated by [[Associated Whistleblowing Press]]. The publication followed previous denounces, also performed by [[Ecuador Transparente]], of physical and on-line surveillance and spying against activists, journalists and politicians in Ecuador, performed by the local government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=SENAIN llevó a cabo espionaje sistemático a políticos y activistas |url=https://ecuadortransparente.org/publicaciones/senain/vigilancia/|publisher=Associated Whistleblowing Press (AWP)|accessdate=5 Aug 2015|location=Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, Noel also took part in the publication of alleged proofs of illegal Internet censorship performed by Ecuadorian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=El gobierno ecuatoriano y la Asociación de Proveedores de Internet trabajan juntos para bloquear el acceso a páginas web |url=https://ecuadortransparente.org/publicaciones/censura-movistar/|publisher=Associated Whistleblowing Press (AWP)|accessdate=14 Apr 2016|location=Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rodriguez|first=Katitza|title=Leaked Documents Confirm Ecuador’s Internet Censorship Machine |url=https://www.eff.org/nl/node/91232|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)|accessdate=14 Apr 2016|location=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, Pedro Noel also participated in the release of the [[Godwin Papers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Los papeles de Godwin |url=https://ecuadortransparente.org/papeles-godwin/|publisher=Associated Whistleblowing Press (AWP)|accessdate=14 Nov 2016|location=Belgium}}&lt;/ref&gt; which showed on-line harassment and discredit campaigns managed by the Ecuadorian government against local journalists, media outlets and the [[Inter-American Commission of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Filtración revela que gobierno ecuatoriano pagó campaña contra la CIDH y Fundamedios|url=http://www.fundamedios.org/alertas/filtracion-revela-que-gobierno-ecuatoriano-pago-campana-contra-la-cidh-y-fundamedios/|publisher=Fundamedios|accessdate=16 Nov 2016|location=Ecuador}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social networks ==

In 2011, along with other Internet activists and researchers, Pedro Noel started&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roos|first=Jerome|title=Virality: international media coverage of The Global Square|url=http://roarmag.org/2012/02/global-square-wikileaks-media-social-network/|publisher=RoarMag.org|accessdate=19 March 2012|location=Online magazine.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|title=Redes sociais sem censura e com privacidade|url=http://www.fne.org.br/fne/index.php/fne/jornal/edicao_121_junho_2012/redes_sociais_sem_censura_e_com_privacidade|publisher=Jornal do Engenheiro|accessdate=1 June 2012|location=Brasilia, Brazil}}&lt;/ref&gt; the project TheGlobalSquare in partnership with [[Delft University of Technology|TU Delft]] and its project [[Tribler]]. The social network is focused on attack and censorship resilient P2P information broadcasting and social systems.

== Spanish Indignados ==

Along with Santiago Carrion, Noel founded the news portal EuropeanRevolution.net [http://europeanrevolution.net], a portal conceived as an informative platform for activists, having as  first goal to translate into English what was happening with the 15 May movement and in the squares occupations around Europe in order to expand its impact worldwide.

This led Noel to collaborate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hérard|first=Pascal|title=Les indignés européens marchent sur Paris|url=http://www.tv5.org/cms/chaine-francophone/info/Les-dossiers-de-la-redaction/Mouvement-des-indignes-2011/p-17709-Les-indignes-europeens-marchent-sur-Paris.htm|publisher=TV5 Monde|accessdate=15 September 2011|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; with TakeTheSquare.net [http://TakeTheSquare.net]

The project was aimed to create a task-force seeking structured change of the worldwide political reality- designed to bring the May 15th ideals to a global context.

Noel and other were the responsible&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zoltan|first=Petru|title=Omul care a scos 700.000 de spanioli în stradă: &lt;&lt;În statul român, represiunile şi supravegherea sunt mai puternice&gt;&gt;|url=http://www.jurnalul.ro/special/proteste-spania-romania-607400.htm|publisher=Jornalul|accessdate=19 March 2012|location=Bucharest}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the worldwide online campaign which culminated in the global day of action on [[15 October 2011 global protests|October 15th 2011]] in more than 950 cities in 82 countries and its main website 15October.net [https://web.archive.org/web/20110923151059/http://15october.net/].

'''Peter Kurer''' (born June 28, 1949)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ubs.com/1/e/investors/corporategovernance/boardofdirectors/Kurer.html?isPopup=yes]{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] manager and lawyer. He was [[Chairman]] of [[UBS AG]] from April 23, 2008 until his dismissal in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=4916067&amp;symbol=UBS |title=Peter Kurer Biography |website=Businessweek.com|accessdate=2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He chaired the Corporate Responsibility Committee and the Strategy Committee of [[UBS AG]].

==Education==
Kurer graduated with a [[licenciate]] in law from the law school of the [[University of Zürich]] and also holds a [[doctorate]] in law from the same school and an [[LL.M.]] degree from the [[University of Chicago School of Law]]. He clerked at the District Court of [[Zürich]] and was admitted as an attorney-at-law in the Canton of Zürich.

==Career==
From 1980 to 1990, Kurer practiced as an attorney with the Zürich office of the international law firm [[Baker and McKenzie]], first as an associate and later as a partner. From 1991 to 2001, Kurer was a partner at the Swiss law firm Homburger (now: Homburger AG) in Zürich.

In 2001, Kurer was appointed Group General Counsel and Member of the Group Managing Board of [[UBS AG]] and in 2002, he was appointed Member of the Executive Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sheikha Mozah Bint Nasser Al-Missned |url=https://people.forbes.com/profile/peter-kurer/81867 |title=Sheikha Mozah Bint Nasser Al-Missned - Forbes |website=People.forbes.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 2008, UBS announced that he would become Chairman of the Board of Directors, replacing Marcel Ospel. On 4 March 2009, UBS announced that Kurer would step down as Chairman of the Board in April and that [[Kaspar Villiger]] would be nominated to succeed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/wirtschaft/aktuell/ubs-praesident_kurer_wird_durch_kaspar_villiger_abgeloest_1.2137949.html |title=Peter Kurer tritt an Generalversammlung nicht zur Wiederwahl an: Kaspar Villiger wird neuer UBS-Verwaltungsratspräsident - NZZ |website=Nzz.ch |date=2009-03-04 |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kurer is now widely seen as a driver behind many of the risk decisions that ultimately led to huge losses for UBS, though he also deserves credit for taking swift action in terms of recapitalising the Bank in 2008.

==Awards and honours==
Kurer is a member of the Visiting Committee to the Law School of The University of Chicago. He is also a member of the Board of Trustees of a foundation that acts as an advisory board to the [[University of St. Gallen]] Program for Law and Economics, and a member of the Committee of Continuing Education, Executive School of Management, Technology and Law, at the University of St. Gallen.

The political terms "[[Left-wing politics|Left]]" and "Right" were first used during the [[French Revolution]] (1789–1799) and referred to seating arrangements in the [[French parliament]]: those who sat to the right of the chair of the parliamentary president were broadly supportive of the institutions of the monarchist [[Ancien Régime|Old Regime]].&lt;ref name="Parliaments 1988 pp. 287–302"&gt;Goodsell, Charles T., "The Architecture of Parliaments: Legislative Houses and Political Culture", British Journal of Political Science, Vol. 18, No. 3 (July 1988), pp. 287–302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linski, Gerhard, ''Current Issues and Research In Macrosociology'' (Brill Archive, 1984) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Barry ''Political Economy: A Comparative Approach'' (Praeger Paperback, 1998), pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; The original Right in France was formed as a reaction against the "Left" and comprised those politicians supporting hierarchy, tradition and [[clericalism]].&lt;ref name="Carlisle"/&gt;{{rp|693}} The use of the expression {{lang|fr|la droite}} ("the right") became prominent in France after the [[Bourbon Restoration#Second Restoration|restoration of the monarchy in 1815]], when it was applied to the [[Ultra-royalist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gauchet, Marcel, "Right and Left" in Nora, Pierre, ed., ''Realms of Memory: Conflicts and Divisions'' (1996) pp. 247–248.&lt;/ref&gt; The people of English-speaking countries did not apply the terms "right" and "left" to their own politics until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;''The English Ideology: Studies in the Language of Victorian Politics'', George Watson Allen Lane, London, 1973, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the right-wing originated with [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditional conservatives]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]] and reactionaries, the term extreme right-wing has also been applied to movements including [[fascism]], [[nazism]] and [[racial supremacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', ''Right(-wing)...and for extreme right parties racism and fascism.'', p. 465, Oxford, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-19-920780-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1830s to the 1880s, there was a shift in the [[Western world]] of [[social class]] structure and the economy, moving away from [[nobility]] and [[aristocracy]] towards [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan S. Kahan. ''Mind Vs. Money: The War Between Intellectuals and Capitalism''. New Brunswick, New Jersey: [[Transaction Publishers]], 2010. p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; This general economic shift toward capitalism affected [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] movements such as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]], which responded by becoming supportive of [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Adams. ''Political Ideology Today''. Manchester, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: [[Manchester University Press]], 2001. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the Right includes both economic and [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerome L. Himmelstein, ''To the right: The transformation of American conservatism'' (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, economic conservatives are usually considered liberal and the Right includes [[Nationalism|nationalists]], [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] [[opposition to immigration]], religious conservatives and historically a significant presence of right-wing movements with [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] sentiments including conservatives and fascists who opposed what they saw as the selfishness and excessive [[materialism]] inherent in contemporary capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard V. Kaplan, Rudy Koshar, ''The Weimar Moment: Liberalism, Political Theology, and Law'' (2012) p 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan S. Kahan, ''Mind Vs.

==History==
{{See also|Left–right politics}}
[[File:Estatesgeneral.jpg|thumb|5 May 1789, opening of the Estates-General in Versailles in 1789, as the conservatives sat on the right]]

The political term right-wing was first used during the [[French Revolution]], when [[Liberalism|liberal]] deputies of the [[Estates-General of 1789|Third Estate]] generally sat to the left of the president's chair, a custom that began in the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] of 1789. The nobility, members of the [[Estates General (France)|Second Estate]], generally sat to the right. In the successive [[Legislative Assembly (France)|legislative assemblies]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]] who supported the [[Ancien Régime|Old Regime]] were commonly referred to as rightists because they sat on the right side. A major figure on the right was [[Joseph de Maistre]], who argued for an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] form of [[conservatism]]. Throughout the [[France in the 19th century|19th century]], the main line dividing [[Politics of France|Left and Right in France]] was between supporters of the republic (often secularists) and supporters of the monarchy (often Catholics).&lt;ref name="Knapp"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Knapp and Vincent Wright|url=https://books.google.com/?id=67ttjXHhT3wC&amp;dq=the+government+and+politics+of+france&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=|title=The Government and Politics of France|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-35732-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the right, the [[Legitimists]] and [[Ultra-royalist]]s held [[counter-revolutionary]] views, while the [[Orléanist]]s hoped to create a [[constitutional monarchy]] under their preferred branch of the royal family, a brief reality after the 1830 [[July Revolution]]. The centre-right Gaullists in post-World War II France advocated considerable social spending on education and infrastructure development as well as extensive economic regulation, but limited the wealth redistribution measures characteristic of [[social democracy]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In British politics, the terms "right" and "left" came into common use for the first time in the late 1930s in debates over the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Loch Mowat]], ''Britain Between the Wars: 1918–1940'' (1955), p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Right has gone through five distinct historical stages: (I) the reactionary right sought a return to aristocracy and established religion; (II) the moderate right distrusted intellectuals and sought limited government; (III) the radical right favored a romantic and aggressive nationalism; (IV) the extreme right proposed anti-immigration policies and implicit racism; and (V) the [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] right sought to combine a market economy and economic deregulation with the traditional right-wing beliefs in patriotism, elitism and law and order.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Ball, T. and R.

The meaning of right-wing "varies across societies, historical epochs, and political systems and ideologies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Augoustinos|first1=Martha|last2=Walker|first2=Iain|last3=Donaghue|first3=Ngaire|title=Social Cognition: An Integrated Introduction|date=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London|isbn=9780761942191|page=320|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYjEwFRPEQgC&amp;pg=PA230}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics'', in liberal democracies, the political right opposes socialism and social democracy. Right-wing parties include conservatives, Christian democrats, classical liberals, nationalists and on the far-right; racists and fascists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McLean|first1=Iain|last2=McMillan|first2=Alistair|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics|page=465|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199205165|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Eatwell and Neal O'Sullivan divide the right into five types: reactionary, moderate, radical, extreme and new.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Chip Berlet argues that each of these "styles of thought" are "responses to the left", including liberalism and socialism, which have arisen since the 1789 French Revolution.&lt;ref name="Berlet, p. 117"&gt;Berlet, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The reactionary right looks toward the past and is "aristocratic, religious and authoritarian".&lt;ref name="Berlet, p. 117"/&gt; The moderate right, typified by the writings of [[Edmund Burke]], is tolerant of change, provided it is gradual and accepts some aspects of liberalism, including the rule of law and capitalism, although it sees radical ''laissez-faire'' and individualism as harmful to society. The moderate right often promotes nationalism and social welfare policies.&lt;ref&gt;Eatwell: 1999, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Radical right is a term developed after World War II to describe groups and ideologies such as [[McCarthyism]], the [[John Birch Society]], [[Thatcherism]] and the [[Republikaner Party]]. Eatwell stresses that this use has "major typological problems" and that the term "has also been applied to clearly democratic developments".&lt;ref&gt;Eatwell: 2004, pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The radical right includes [[right-wing populism]] and various other subtypes.&lt;ref name="Berlet, p. 117"/&gt; Eatwell argues that the extreme right' has four traits: "1) anti-democracy; 2) nationalism; 3) racism; and 4) the strong state".&lt;ref&gt;Eatwell: 2004, p. 8, "Today four other traits feature most prominently in definitions: 1) anti-democracy; 2) nationalism; 3) racism; 4) the strong state".&lt;/ref&gt; The New Right consists of the liberal conservatives, who stress small government, free markets and individual initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vincent|first1=Andrew|title=Modern Political Ideologies|date=1995|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-631-19507-8|edition=2nd|quote=Who to include under the rubric of the New Right remains puzzling.

Other authors make a distinction between the centre-right and the far-right.&lt;ref&gt;Betz &amp; Immerfall 1998; Betz 1994; Durham 2000; Durham 2002; Hainsworth 2000; Mudde 2000; Berlet &amp; Lyons, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Parties of the centre-right generally support liberal democracy, capitalism, the market economy (though they may accept government regulation to control monopolies), private property rights and a limited welfare state (for example, government provision of education and medical care). They support conservatism and economic liberalism and oppose socialism and communism. By contrast, the phrase "far-right" is used to describe those who favor an absolutist government, which uses the power of the state to support the dominant ethnic group or religion and often to criminalize other ethnic groups or religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YYdTvMmSYpEC&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=The Routledge Companion to Fascism and the Far Right|publisher=Books.google.ca|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010|isbn=978-0-415-21495-7|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ual1NR2WPasC&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPR7,M1|title=The Christian Right, the Far Right and the Boundaries of American Conservatism|publisher=Books.google.ca|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010|isbn=978-0-7190-5486-0|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sVZ8EUvJjJ4C&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPR5,M1|title=Right-wing Extremism in the Twenty-first Century|publisher=Books.google.ca|date=30 June 2000|accessdate=13 May 2010|isbn=978-0-7146-5182-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JcJ5nr2MZfUC&amp;dq=%22far+right%22&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Western Democracies and the New Extreme Right Challenge|publisher=Books.google.ca|date=|accessdate=13 May 2010|isbn=978-0-415-36971-8|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1857918.stm|title=Pim Fortuyn: The far-right Dutch maverick|publisher=BBC News|date=7 March 2002|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical examples of leaders to whom the far-right label is often applied are: [[Francisco Franco]] in [[Spain]], [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Italy]], [[Adolf Hitler]] in [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Augusto Pinochet]] in [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6069233|title=A Dictator's Legacy of Economic Growth|date=14 September 2006|accessdate=15 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald|first=Glenn|url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2007/05/04/politico_funding/|title=Glenn Greenwald|publisher=Salon.com|date=31 May 2012|accessdate=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Canovan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Canovan|first1=Margaret|title=Populism|date=1981|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=978-0151730780|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Betz|first=Hans-Georg|title=Radical Right-Wing Populism in Western Europe|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1994|isbn=978-0-312-08390-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael E.

The [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] defines right-wing extremism in the United States as "broadly divided into those groups, movements, and adherents that are primarily hate-oriented (based on hatred of particular religious, racial or ethnic groups), and those that are mainly anti-government, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely. It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/eprint/rightwing.pdf|title=Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment|publisher=United States Department of Homeland Security|format=PDF|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social stratification===
Right-wing politics involves in varying degrees the rejection of some [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] objectives of [[left-wing politics]], claiming either that [[Social inequality|social]] or [[economic inequality]] is natural and inevitable or that it is beneficial to society.&lt;ref name="autogenerated68"&gt;''Left and right: the significance of a political distinction'', Norberto Bobbio and Allan Cameron, pg. 68, [[University of Chicago Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing ideologies and movements support [[social order]]. The original French right-wing was called "the party of order" and held that France needed a strong political leader to keep order.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; British conservative scholar R. J. White, who rejects egalitarianism, wrote: "Men are equal before God and the laws, but unequal in all else; hierarchy is the order of nature, and privilege is the reward of honourable service".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Moyra Grant. ''Key Ideas in Politics''. Cheltenham, England, UK: Nelson Thornes, Ltd., 2003. p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; American conservative [[Russell Kirk]] also rejected egalitarianism as imposing sameness, stating: "Men are created different; and a government that ignores this law becomes an unjust government for it sacrifices nobility to mediocrity".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; Kirk took as one of the "canons" of conservatism the principle that "civilized society requires orders and classes".&lt;ref name="heritage.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=John|first=David C.|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/HL811.cfm|title=The Origins of the Modern American Conservative Movement|publisher=heritage.org|date=21 November 2003|accessdate=13 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308173749/http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/HL811.cfm|archivedate=8 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Right-libertarianism|Right libertarians]] reject collective or state-imposed equality as undermining reward for personal merit, initiative and enterprise.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; In their view, it is unjust, limits personal freedom and leads to social uniformity and mediocrity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

===Anti-communism===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The original use of "right-wing" in reference to communism had the conservatives on the right, the liberals in the centre and the communists on the left. Both the conservatives and the liberals were strongly anti-communist. The history of the use of the term "right-wing" to mean anti-communist is a complicated one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hendershot|first1=Cyndy|title=Anti-Communism and Popular Culture in Mid-Century America|date=2003|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=978-0786414406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Marxist movements were at odds with the traditional monarchies that ruled over much of the [[Europe]]an continent at the time. Many European monarchies outlawed the public expression of communist views and the ''[[The Communist Manifesto|Communist Manifesto]]'', which began "[a] spectre [that] is haunting Europe", stated that monarchs feared for their thrones. Advocacy of communism was illegal in the [[Russian Empire]], the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], the three most powerful monarchies in continental Europe prior to [[World War I]]. Many monarchists (except [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional monarchists]]) viewed inequality in wealth and political power as resulting from a divine natural order. The struggle between monarchists and communists was often described as a struggle between the Right and the Left.

By [[World War I]], in most European monarchies, the divine right of kings had become discredited and replaced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movements. Most European monarchs became figureheads or accepted a lesser degree of powers while elected governments held the day-to-day power. The most conservative European monarchy, the Russian Empire, was replaced by the communist Soviet Union. The Russian Revolution inspired a series of other communist revolutions across Europe in the years 1917–1922. Many of these, such as the [[German Revolution]], were defeated by nationalist and monarchist military units. In this period, nationalism began to be considered right-wing, especially when it opposed the internationalism of the communists.

The 1920s and 1930s saw the fading of traditional right-wing politics. The mantle of conservative anti-communism was taken up by the rising [[Fascism|fascist]] movements on the one hand and by [[United States|American]]-inspired [[Liberal conservatism|liberal conservatives]] on the other. When communist groups and political parties began appearing around the world, their opponents were usually [[Colonialism|colonial authorities]] and the term right-wing came to be applied to [[colonialism]].

After [[World War II]], communism became a global phenomenon and anti-communism became an integral part of the domestic and foreign policies of the [[United States]] and its [[NATO]] allies. Conservatism in the post-war era abandoned its monarchist and aristocratic roots, focusing instead on patriotism, religious values and nationalism. Throughout the [[Cold War]], colonial governments in [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] turned to the United States for political and economic support. Communists were also enemies of capitalism, portraying [[Wall Street]] as the oppressor of the masses. The United States made anti-communism the top priority of its foreign policy and many American conservatives sought to combat what they saw as communist influence at home. This led to the adoption of a number of domestic policies that are collectively known under the term "[[McCarthyism]]". While both liberals and conservatives were anti-communist, the followers of Senator McCarthy were called right-wing and those on the right called liberals who favored free speech, even for communists; leftist.

===Economics===
In France after the French Revolution, the Right fought against the rising power of those who had grown rich through commerce and sought to preserve the rights of the hereditary nobility. They were uncomfortable with capitalism, the Enlightenment, individualism and industrialism and fought to retain traditional social hierarchies and institutions.&lt;ref name="Parliaments 1988 pp. 287–302"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Appleby"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marty|first1=Martin E.|last2=Appleby|first2=R. Scott|title=Fundamentalisms Observed|date=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-50878-1|page=91|edition=2nd|quote=Reactionary right-wing themes emphasizing authority, social hierarchy, and obedience, as well as condemnations of liberalism, the democratic ethos, the "rights of man" associated with the legacy of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution, and the political and cultural ethos of modern liberal democracy are especially prominent in the writings and public statements of Archbishop Lefebere.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe's history, there have been strong [[Collectivism|collectivist]] right-wing movements, such as in the [[Catholic social teaching|social Catholic right]] that has exhibited hostility to all forms of [[liberalism]] (including [[economic liberalism]]) and has historically advocated for paternalist class harmony involving an organic-hierarchical society where workers are protected while hierarchy of classes remain.&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Catholic Social Teaching: The Popes Confront the Industrial Age'', 1740–1958. Paulist Press, 2003, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, the Right had shifted to support the newly rich in some European countries (particularly England) and instead of favouring the nobility over industrialists, favoured capitalists over the working class. Other right-wing movements, such as [[Carlism]] in Spain and nationalist movements in France, Germany and Russia, remained hostile to capitalism and industrialism. However, there are still a few right-wing movements today, notably the French [[Nouvelle Droite]], [[CasaPound]] and American [[paleoconservatives]], that are often in opposition to capitalist ethics and the effects they have on society as a whole, which they see as infringing upon or causing the decay of social traditions or hierarchies that they see as essential for social order.&lt;ref name="Fascism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Payne|first1=Stanley G.|title=Fascism: Comparison and Definition|date=1983|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, Wisc.|isbn=978-0-299-08064-8|page=19|quote=Right radicals and conservative authoritarians almost without exception became corporatists in formal doctrines of political economy, but the fascists were less explicit and in general less schematic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, "right-wing" is sometimes used to describe [[Laissez-faire|''laissez-faire'' capitalism]]. In Europe, capitalists formed alliances with the Right during their conflicts with workers after 1848. In France, the Right's support of capitalism can be traced to the late-nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; The so-called [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] Right, popularised by [[US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[UK Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], combines support for [[free markets]], [[privatisation]] and [[deregulation]] with traditional right-wing support for social conformity.&lt;ref name="Lukes"/&gt; [[Right-libertarianism|Right-wing libertarianism]] (sometimes known as [[libertarian conservatism]] or [[conservative libertarianism]]) supports a decentralised economy based on [[economic freedom]] and holds [[property rights]], [[free markets]] and [[free trade]] to be the most important kinds of freedom. Russell Kirk believed that freedom and property rights were interlinked.&lt;ref name="heritage.org"/&gt; Anthony Gregory has written that right-wing libertarianism "can refer to any number of varying and at times mutually exclusive political orientations". Gregory holds that the issue is neither right or left, but "whether a person sees the state as a major hazard or just another institution to be reformed and directed toward a political goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/gregory/gregory127.html|title=Left, Right, Moderate and Radical by Anthony Gregory|publisher=Archive.lewrockwell.com|date=21 December 2006|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative authoritarians and those on the [[Far-right politics|far-right]] have supported [[fascism]] and [[corporatism]].&lt;ref name="Fascism"/&gt;

===Nationalism===
In France, [[nationalism]] was originally a left-wing and Republican ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Doyle|first1=William|title=The Oxford History of the French Revolution|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-19-925298-5|edition=2nd|quote="An exuberant, uncompromising nationalism lay behind France's revolutionary expansion in the 1790s...", "The message of the French Revolution was that the people are sovereign; and in the two centuries since it was first proclaimed it has conquered the world."}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Georges Ernest Boulanger|the period of ''boulangisme'']] and the [[Dreyfus Affair]], nationalism became a trait of the right-wing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Winock|Winock, Michel]] (dir.), ''Histoire de l'extrême droite en France'' (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing nationalists sought to define and defend a "true" national identity from elements deemed to be corrupting that identity.&lt;ref name="Knapp"/&gt; Some were [[Supremacism|supremacists]], who in accordance with [[social Darwinism]] applied the concept of "[[survival of the fittest]]" to nations and races.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Ian ''Political Ideology Today'' (2nd edition), Manchester University Press, 2002, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing nationalism was influenced by [[Romantic nationalism]], in which the state derives its political legitimacy from the organic unity of those it governs. This generally includes the language, race, culture, religion and customs of the nation, all of which were "born" within its culture. Linked with right-wing nationalism is [[cultural conservatism]], which supports the preservation of the heritage of a nation or culture and often sees deviations from cultural norms as an existential threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramet|first1=Sabrina|last2=Griffin|first2=Roger|title=The Radical Right in Central and Eastern Europe since 1989|date=1999|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press|location=University Park|isbn=978-0271018119}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

===Natural law and traditionalism===
Right-wing politics typically justifies a hierarchical society on the basis of [[natural law]] or [[tradition]].&lt;ref name="T. Alexander Smith 2003. p. 30"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allan Cameron pg. 37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fuchs, D. 1990. p. 203"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lukes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref name="autogenerated68"/&gt;

Traditionalism was advocated by a group of United States university professors (labeled the "New Conservatives" by the popular press) who rejected the concepts of [[individualism]], [[liberalism]], [[modernity]] and [[social progress]], seeking instead to promote what they identified as cultural and educational renewal&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Frohnen, Jeremy Beer and Jeffrey O. Nelson, ed. (2006) ''American Conservatism: An Encyclopedia'' Wilmington, DE: ISI Books, p. 870.&lt;/ref&gt; and a revived interest in what [[T. S. Eliot]] referred to as "the permanent things" (concepts perceived by traditionalists as truths that endure from age to age alongside basic institutions of western society such as the church, the family, the state and business).

===Populism===
{{Main article|Right-wing populism}}
[[File:TeaPartyByFreedomFan.JPG|thumb|Tea Party protesters walk towards the [[United States Capitol]] during the [[Taxpayer March on Washington]], 12 September 2009]]
[[Right-wing populism]] is a combination of civic/ethno-nationalism with [[anti-elitism]], using populist rhetoric to provide a radical critique of existing political institutions. According to Margaret Canovan, a right-wing populist is "a charismatic leader, using the tactics of politicians' populism to go past the politicians and intellectual elite and appeal to the reactionary sentiments of the populace, often buttressing his claim to speak for the people by the use of referendums".&lt;ref name="Canovan"/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

In Europe, right-wing populism often takes the form of distrust of the [[European Union]] and of politicians in general combined with anti-immigrant rhetoric and a call for a return to traditional, national values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hayward|first1=Jack|title=Elitism, Populism, and European Politics|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0198280354}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} In the United States, the [[Tea Party movement]] states that the core beliefs for membership are the primacy of individual liberties as defined in the Constitution of the United States, small federal government and respect for the rule of law. Some policy positions include an opposition to illegal immigration, a strong national military force, the right to individual gun ownership, cutting taxes, reducing government spending and balancing the budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teaparty.org/about-us/|title=About Us|publisher=Tea Party|date=2 September 2004|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Government support for an established religion was associated with the original French Right.&lt;ref name="Appleby"/&gt; [[Joseph de Maistre]] argued for the indirect authority of the [[Pope]] over temporal matters. According to Maistre, only governments founded upon a Christian constitution, implicit in the customs and institutions of all European societies and especially in [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Europe]]an monarchies, could avoid the disorder and bloodshed that followed the implementation of [[Rationalism|rationalist]] political programs, as in the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Church of England]] was established by [[Henry VIII]] and some churchmen are given seats in the [[House of Lords]], but are considered politically neutral rather than being specifically right or left-wing.

Religious fundamentalists frequently feel that governments should enact laws supporting their religious tenets.&lt;ref name="Appleby"/&gt; The [[Christian right]] is a major force in North America. They generally support laws upholding what they consider religious values, such as [[pro-life movement in the United States|opposition to abortion]], contraception,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hannah Groch-Begley|url=http://mediamatters.org/blog/2014/03/26/this-conservative-myth-about-birth-control-coul/198623|title=This Conservative Myth About Birth Control Could Sway A Supreme Court Case|publisher=Mediamatters.org|date=26 March 2014|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; sex outside marriage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adn.com/article/20110323/sex-outside-marriage-should-be-illegal-says-parnell-nominee|title=Sex outside marriage should be illegal, says Parnell nominee|work=Alaska Dispatch News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to same-sex marriage and reject scientific positions on [[evolution]] and other matters where science disagrees with the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Diana|last=DeGette|title=Sex, Science, and Stem Cells: Inside the Right Wing Assault on Reason|publisher=[[The Lyons Press]]|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59921-431-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chris Mooney, ''The Republican War on Science: Revised and Updated'', ASIN: B001OQOIPM&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the West, some other religious and ethnicity based political groups are considered right-wing.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In India, [[Hindu nationalism]] is sometimes considered a part of the Right.

== History ==
International traders in London, including those from France, Germany and the Netherlands, the Baltic, Hungary, the Mediterranean and the United States, founded the [[Grain and Feed Trade Association|London Corn Trade Association]] in 1878 in order to standardize shipping documents for exporting nations and to clarify procedures and disputes relating to the quality of imported grain.

In the same year, SGS was founded in [[Rouen, France]], by  Henri Goldstuck, a young Latvian immigrant who, having seen the opportunities at one of the country’s largest ports, began to inspect French grain shipments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SGS - E- Story|url = http://www.swiss-ships.ch/reeder/reederei-berichte/sgs-geneve/sgs-story_e.html|website = www.swiss-ships.ch|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the aid of Captain Maxwell Shafftington, he borrowed money from an Austrian friend to start inspecting the shipments arriving in Rouen as, during transit, losses showed in the volume of grain as a result of shrinkage and theft. The service inspected and verified the quantity and quality of the grain on arrival with the importer.

Business grew rapidly; the two [[entrepreneurs]] went into business together in December 1878 and, within a year, had opened offices in Le Havre, Dunkirk and Marseilles.

In 1915, during the First World War, the company moved its headquarters from Paris to [[Geneva, Switzerland]] and on July 19, 1919 the company adopted the name Société Générale de Surveillance.

During the mid-20th century, SGS started offering inspection, testing and verification services across a variety of sectors, including industrial, minerals and oil, gas and chemicals, among others. In 1981, the company went public and in 1985 joined the [[Swiss Market Index]].

== Operations ==
The company works in the following industries: agriculture and food, automotive, aviation, chemical, construction, consumer goods and retail, energy, finance, industrial manufacturing, life sciences, logistics, mining, oil and gas, and public sector.

'''Saudization'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dole.gov.ph/fndr/bong/files/Question%20and%20Answer%20on%20Saudization%20Policy.pdf|title=Saudization|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, officially known as Saudi nationalization scheme, or Nitaqat system in Arabic, is the newest policy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia implemented by its Ministry of Labor, whereby Saudi companies and enterprises are required to fill up their workforce with Saudi nationals up to certain levels.

As part of the Vision 2030 reforms, announced in 2016, reducing the number of unemployed Saudi nationals is a key element of the plan. Previously the private sector was largely dominated by [[expatriate]] workers from Pakistan, India, Philippines and Arab countries such as Lebanon or Egypt.

The Saudi Government took the decision to reduce unemployment among native Saudis, under the slogan 'Let's Put the Saudi in Saudization'.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Al-Omran, Arab News, 22 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

in 2017, updates to the Saudization percentages were announced, differing the number of Saudi nationals required depending on industry and company &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9D7ZOd8TYRFQlNndm5qQjhvcWc/view|title=2017 Saudization rates|last=|first=|date=|website=Proven SA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;size.

==History==
While many Saudi native men found employment with the government, there were not enough government jobs as over 65% of the population is of working age&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stats.gov.sa/sites/default/files/en-demographic-research-2016_2.pdf|title=Saudi stats|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
"Saudization" the workforce has been a goal of the kingdom since at least the Fourth Development Plan (1985-1989) which called for replacing foreign workers with Saudi natives as one of its objectives. Immigration was tightened and many undocumented foreign workers were deported, but the program was only a marginal success.&lt;ref name=Wynbrandt-252&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wynbrandt|first1=James|title=A Brief History of Saudi Arabia|publisher=Infobase Publishing.|page=252|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eZkIXdsZpPsC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=history+of+saudization&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aF3eVIOBLIaGyQSrpYDIAw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20saudization&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Saudization goal for 2003 was that at least 30% of employees of companies with 20 or more workers should be Saudi natives, (although only 300,000 people were employed by companies of this size).&lt;ref name=Wynbrandt-298&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wynbrandt|first1=James|title=A Brief History of Saudi Arabia|publisher=Infobase Publishing.|page=298|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eZkIXdsZpPsC&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=history+of+saudization&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aF3eVIOBLIaGyQSrpYDIAw&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20saudization&amp;f=false|accessdate=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, negotiations between business executives and senior government leaders, including [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia|King Abdullah]], led to reductions of Saudization targets in some work sectors from 30 percent to 10 percent, and full waivers from Saudization in the case of two Chinese companies, according to discussions between [[United States|US]] ambassador [[James C. Oberwetter]] and Saudi executives.&lt;ref name="06RIYADH4543" /&gt;

In 2014 the ''Saudi Gazette'' reported that one of the targets of the kingdom's Ninth Development Plan (2010-2015) -- to "bring down the unemployment rate to 5.5 percent and revive the Saudization strategy"—had not been realized.&lt;ref name="ML-2014"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20140830216374|title=The Ministry of Labor has failed to meet its goals|last1=Al-Amri|first1=Tarad|date=August 29, 2014|accessdate=13 February 2015|agency=''Saudi Gazette''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the plan targets Saudi youths as well as the women workers for the growth of the kingdom's economy. The Shura council (a consultative body) dictated that as of 2007, 70 percent of the work force were Saudi. Between 2011 and 2013, the transportation and communication sectors recorded the highest improvement in Saudization rates from 9 percent to 20 percent. Manufacturing also underwent a notable improvement in Saudization rates (from 13 percent to 19.3 percent). 

Saudization rates in the retail and construction sectors also improved from 12.9 percent and 7.2 percent to 18.4 percent and 10.3 percent respectively, said the report.
Taking average growth for the period between 2011 and 2013, improved Saudization rates in the transportation sector came mainly as a result of a significant 59 percent growth in employment of Saudis. Average Saudi employment growth in the manufacturing and wholesale and retail sectors was also high, at 25 percent each. 
Meanwhile, employment growth for non-Saudis averaged just 4 percent and 7 percent respectively. 

The construction sector — the most labor-intensive part of the private sector — recorded an impressive 34 percent average growth in employment of Saudis, while employment of non-Saudis in the sector grew by 14 percent. 
The higher growth in Saudi employment in the construction sector is impressive given the particularly high wage differential from non-Saudis. Saudis in the construction sector earned a monthly average of SR3,330 in 2013, while non-Saudis earned only SR1,029.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arabnews.com/economy/news/687596|title= Saudi employment in construction sector impressive|newspaper=Arab News|date=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==
For companies in Saudi Arabia, there are a number of challenges with implementing Saudization. Firstly, there are a lack of recruitment companies specializing in Saudi talent so when it comes to hiring for a role and going through the Nitaqat &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://proven-sa.com/2017/04/what-is-nitaqat/|title=Nitaqat|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; process, companies don't have the knowledge or the support they require. 

The turnover for Saudi talent is high as companies widely recognize and value the skills and abilities of Saudi nationals and can easily offer a candidate a more attractive package. A solution for this is to ensure that you are offering not only competitive packages for the role but also long term training plans to support Saudi nationals in their careers. Saudi graduates are often western educated, choosing to complete their university degrees in the UK, US and Europe. 

Saudi women are a key element to teams and companies have long seen their value, the previous challenge of women not being allowed to transport themselves around the Kingdom is coming to an end with women being allowed to drive from 2018.

The first phase of Saudization went into effect from September 2018, wherein car dealerships and sellers of clothing, furniture and household utensils would employ locals in approximately 70% of sales job. The reform is expected to create 60,000 jobs for Saudis. However, the demand is of 700,000 positions by 2020. The Saudi private sector is still in a very difficult phase, being dominated mostly by foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-19/jobs-for-saudis-plan-tests-retailers-used-to-cheap-foreign-labor|title=Saudi Businesses Are Struggling to Hire Saudi Workers|publisher=Bloomberg News|accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nitaqat==

=== What is Nitaqat ===
Nitaqat is a program of Saudization, increasing the employment of Saudi nationals in the private sector. The program classifies the country's private firms into six categories: Platinum, High Green, Mid Green, Low Green, Yellow and Red.  Platinum is the highest percentage category followed by High Green and so on, the Yellow and Red categories being the lowest. 

Nitaqat requires employers in the private sector with over 9 employees to hire a certain percentage of Saudi nationals, depending on the company’s industry and the number of employees in the company. Companies with less than 10 employees are exempt from the zoning system but are still required to hire at least one Saudi national.

The classification of other companies is based on the Saudization percentage (% of Saudi employees) and the total number of employees.  The companies with less than 10 employees are exempt from the program, but still need to employ at least one Saudi citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlapiper.com/files/Publication/8013ec0e-9213-4de5-93b1-769e55e29b70/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/c8a4d367-e2f0-4df4-83c4-8b94cf0e0e88/Be_Aware_Middle_East_June_2012.pdf Be Aware – Focus on Kingdom of Saudi Arabia]. June 2012. DLA Piper.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rapid visa services are available only to businesses that are in the platinum category of the Nitaqat system to improve employment for Saudis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://en-maktoob.news.yahoo.com/businessmen-tells-ministry-solve-labor-market-issues-090912528.html|title=Nitaqat system to improve employment for Saudis|date=2014-12-31|newspaper=Saudi Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initiative was announced in June 2011, when the Ministry of Labour passed Ministerial Resolution no. (4040).  The implementation deadline for the program was in 2013.  Nearly 90,000 Indians left Saudi by the end of October 2013.  About 466,689 Indian workers have renewed their iqamas (resident permit) over the last five months of the grace period, 359,997 workers have transferred their sponsorship and 355,035 workers changed their job titles to legalize their status (e.g.: profession change, sponsorship change etc.) reports the Financial Express.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oneindia.com/india/nitaqat-many-keralites-stranded-in-saudi-1335986.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  More than 200,000 private firms were closed down in 2014 for failing to meet the conditions set within the Nitaqat nationalization program aimed at reducing unemployment among Saudis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arabnews.com/news/611896|title=200,000 firms closed down|date=2014-08-05|newspaper=Arab News|accessdate=2015-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The companies receive incentives or penalties depending on the category they belong to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://proven-sa.com/2017/11/saudization-ratio-updates/|title=Saudization ratio updates 2017|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=Proven SA|accessdate=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a full list of percentage breakdown by industry and company size is available&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9D7ZOd8TYRFQlNndm5qQjhvcWc/view|title=Saudization ratio 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=Proven SA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Male and female are now equal when being taken into consideration for Saudization percentages. Previously a female Saudi employee was counted as two male Saudis for Saudization purposed but this is no longer the case. Also taken into consideration for Saudization percentages is a non Saudi national employee, male or female, who is currently married to a Saudi national.

An official at the Ministry of Labour said inspection teams from the ministry are closely monitoring companies who have been exploiting people with disabilities in order to encourage their Saudization rates. The officials check on employees with disabilities during inspection rounds to identify the nature of the work, their presence at the job, and the type of arrangements and services provided to them, noting that the number of people with disabilities employed at a facility cannot exceed 10 percent. If employees with disabilities in a firm exceed more than 10 percent of the total number of Saudi employees, then each disabled worker is calculated like any other Saudi. “It is unfortunate that there are some companies and individuals who exploit people with disabilities to pump up their Saudization rates,”and Saudi workers with disabilities who are able to work are counted as four employees in the Saudization ratio. They must be paid a minimum monthly wage of 3,000 riyals and should not be counted as part of the Saudization ratio of another establishment. To recent reports which reveal that companies have been hiring Saudis with disabilities in order to boost Saudization rates as these disabled employees count as 4 employees, thus saving the company from hiring able-bodied Saudi employees at higher salaries. An executive at a private company said there are some people with disabilities who present themselves to the companies for employment in return for salaries, bonuses, and benefits. Companies are thus paying less to a disabled employee who is equal to four Saudis than they would if they hired four Saudis with salaries of more than SR 20,000 each. They offer their services. Some companies accept, refuse, others added. The Ministry of Labour and other agencies work together regarding the issue of employees with disabilities, noting that the Ministry of Labor determines the nature of disability upon interviewing the employee. They currently posted a draft to the disability employment legislation on the “Together We Improve” portal for discussion before making a decision to amend the definition of disability work and conditions for employment stipulated in Article 13. Disabled employee to count as more than one employee in Nitaqat, the individual must hold a license or identification card from the Ministry of Social Affairs or Ministry of Labor indicating the type and degree of disability. Further, work conditions and systems must be acceptable and suitable for employees based on the type of disability, and establishments should ensure all services are in place before the employee begins work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.arabnews.com/saudi-arabia/news/668001 | title = Companies misuse nitaqat concession | newspaper = Arabnews | date = 2014-12-01 | accessdate = 2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Four million expatriates regularise their status===

==Early life==
Matsui was born in 1963 and started training in Kyokushin karate at age 13.&lt;ref name="SOKK"/&gt; In 1976, he joined the Kita Nagare-Yama Dojo in [[Chiba Prefecture]] and attained the rank of 1st ''dan'' [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in a little over one year.&lt;ref name="IKO"/&gt;

==Later years==
Matsui completed the [[100-man kumite]] in 1987, when ranked 4th ''dan''.&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;[http://www.shihancollins.com/nyhemsida/sosaistory.html Shihan Collins: 100 men kumite] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329092322/http://www.shihancollins.com/nyhemsida/sosaistory.html |date=2009-03-29 }} Retrieved on 23 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1992, Matsui opened his own ''dojo'' in [[Asakusa]], Tokyo,&lt;ref name="HabersetzerHabersetzer2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IKO"/&gt; and was later appointed as a Branch Chief by Oyama.&lt;ref name="IKO"/&gt;

Near the end of his life, some say that Oyama named Matsui (then ranked 5th ''dan'', and clearly junior in rank to several senior instructors) to succeed him in leading the IKO. However this has been disputed with his family and Matsui.&lt;ref name="SOKK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IKO"/&gt; Reportedly, a letter by senior Kyokushin instructor [[Peter Chong (karateka)|Peter Chong]] noted that Matsui was surprised to hear that he had been appointed to succeed Oyama, but also that Oyama had earlier named Matsui before several other people as the leading candidate to succeed him.&lt;ref name="KKC"&gt;[http://www.kyokushincanada.com/LegalMatter_Kyokushin.htm Kyokushin Karate Canada: What has happened with the Kyokushin organization?] Retrieved on 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Matsui then became ''Kancho'' (Director). Following a dispute over the veracity of Oyama's will, Kyokushin karate as an organization divided into three main groups, led by Matsui, [[Kenji Midori]], and Yoshikazu Matsushima.&lt;ref name="Yussof2006"&gt;Yussof, S. (2006): [http://www.australiankyokushin.com/flavours.shtml Flavours of Kyokushin: Mas Oyama's children] Retrieved on 26 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Matsui is currently ranked 8th ''dan'',&lt;ref name="SOKK"/&gt; and leads one of the IKO groups, supported by Yuzo Goda,Bijan Fard, [[Bobby Lowe (karateka)|Bobby Lowe]], [[Peter Chong (karateka)|Peter Chong]], and Seiji Isobe.&lt;ref name="IKO"/&gt; [[Loek Hollander]] had previously supported Matsui, but withdrew his support in August 2010.&lt;ref name="Hollander2010"&gt;[http://www.europeankyokushin.org/news/ European Kyokushin] (17 August 2010).

'''TIBCO Spotfire''' is an analytics platform. It was a [[business intelligence]] company based in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]] that was bought by [[Tibco Software|TIBCO]] in 2007.  The new A(X) experience was launched in November 2018 and includes natural language search and AI-powered insights, reimagined user interface, automated data flows, and real-time data streams.

==History==
Spotfire's origins trace back to the [[University of Maryland Human-Computer Interaction Lab]] at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] where, a visiting student from Sweden in the early 1990s, [[Christopher Ahlberg]], worked with [[Ben Shneiderman]] to develop applications of dynamic queries. Ahlberg returned to Sweden and developed an enhanced [[UNIX]] implementation of his visual data analysis tool, the Information Visualization and Exploration Environment (IVEE). Spotfire was launched in mid-1996 by IVEE Development, which was renamed Spotfire Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/spotfire/ Dynamic queries, starfield displays, and the path to Spotfire] (By Ben Shneiderman, February 4, 1999, updated July 26, 2007) Accessed May 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Wall Street Transcript''''' is a paid subscription publication and Web site that publishes bi-weekly [[industry]] reports that feature [[Financial analyst|equity analyst]], [[Investment management|money manager]] and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] interviews. Reports typically cover two to three industries and express money managers' and analysts' views on each of the various industry sectors, as well as interviews with CEOs whose companies operate within the covered industries.

In publication since 1963, ''The Wall Street Transcript'' is a publication in the finance community, which has interviewed the CEOs and senior executives of public companies, money managers handling billions of dollars of assets, and equity analysts from leading investment banks around the world and publishing these interviews verbatim. ''The Wall Street Transcript'' does not endorse the views of those interviewed, nor does it make stock recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_mOEIN/is_2000_Nov_16/ai_66999745/|title=FindArticles.com - CBSi|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Wall Street Transcript'' highlights micro-cap and [[market capitalization|small-cap]] stocks that may go overlooked by many investors, while its CEO interviews often offer commentary to investors in larger-cap stocks as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seekingalpha.com/author/the-wall-street-transcript|title=The Wall Street Transcript's Articles|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large investment houses such as Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs contribute their opinions on various market topics regularly to ''The Wall Street Transcript''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-wall-street-transcript-to-interview-rhino-enterprises-group-inc-71803982.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.twst.com/interviewees|title=Interviewees - The Wall Street Transcript|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=November 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Wall Street Transcript'' has been awarded various awards and accolades, as well as having been cited by ''Forbes'' as the Best Web Site Publication for Stock Picking. It has around 200,000 readers every month, 5,000 readers who choose to receive publications in print; furthermore 67 percent of these readers invest more than $75,000 annually and 71 percent of the readers have annual incomes greater than $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-wall-street-transcript-to-interview-rhino-enterprises-group-inc-71803982.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Seeking Alpha]], a free provider of financial and stock analysis from blogs, newsletters and money managers, publishes excerpts of ''Wall Street Transcript'' reports on its Web site.

Notable CEOs who have interviewed with ''The Wall Street Transcript'' include [[William P. Lauder]], executive chairman and chairman of The [[Estee Lauder Companies]]' board of directors,&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/European-Community-Internet-twst-3730340950.html?x=0&amp;.v=1 Yahoo Finance]&lt;/ref&gt; [[MGM Mirage]] Chairman and CEO [[James Murren|James J.

Analysts and money managers from investment firms such as [[Goldman Sachs]] &amp; Co., [[UBS AG|UBS]], [[Credit Suisse]] and [[RBC Capital Markets]] have also appeared in interviews with ''The Wall Street Transcript''.

==Founder==
Richard Holman (1923–2000) was the founder, owner and CEO of the ''Wall Street Transcript'' from 1963 to 1998. After a brief career in investment banking, Holman founded the ''Transcript'', believing that investment professionals and casual investors would be willing to pay for information that would help them pick stocks.

From the late 1960s through late 1970s, Holman was involved in a series of court cases with the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (S.E.C.), focused around whether the ''Wall Street Transcript'' published investment news or investment advice. The case ultimately ended in 1978 with ''S.E.C. v. Wall Street Transcript'', in which the publication was determined to be a legitimate news organization and not an investment adviser.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Holman was born in [[New York City]], son of former New York state assemblyman Abraham Goodman. He graduated from [[Cornell University]] and served in the Army during World War II in Japan and the Philippines.

A '''trade union''', also called a '''labour union''' or '''labor union''' ([[American English|US]]), is an [[Political organisation#Labour unions|organization of workers]] who have come together to achieve many common goals, such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, and attaining better wages, benefits (such as vacation, health care, and retirement), and [[working conditions]] through the increased bargaining power wielded by the creation of a monopoly of the workers.&lt;ref name=Union_Anti-Trust_Clayton_Act_Exemption&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2885&amp;context=californialawreview | title=Labor's Antitrust Exemption | last=Frost | first=Daniel | publisher=California Law Review | date=1 April 1967 | accessdate=2017-12-15 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216003433/http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2885&amp;context=californialawreview | archive-date=2017-12-16 | dead-url=no | pages= | quote=&lt;blockquote&gt;...the United States Supreme Court again undertook the delicate task of defining the antitrust exemption granted labor unions by section six of the Clayton Act.&lt;/blockquote&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members ([[wikt:rank and file|rank and file]] members) and negotiates [[Labour and employment law|labour contracts]] ([[collective bargaining]]) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is "maintaining or improving the conditions of their [[employment]]".&lt;ref name="webb"&gt;{{cite book |last=Webb |first=Sidney |last2=Webb|first2= Beatrice |title=History of Trade Unionism |publisher=Longmans and Co. London |year=1920}} ch. I&lt;/ref&gt; This may include the negotiation of [[wage]]s, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing and promotion of workers, benefits, [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] and policies.

Unions may organize a particular section of skilled workers ([[craft unionism]]),&lt;ref name="Poole, M. 1986"&gt;Poole, M., 1986. Industrial Relations: Origins and Patterns of National Diversity. London UK: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; a cross-section of workers from various trades ([[general union]]ism), or attempt to organize all workers within a particular industry ([[industrial unionism]]). The agreements negotiated by a union are binding on the rank and file members and the employer and in some cases on other non-member workers. Trade unions traditionally have a constitution which details the governance of their bargaining unit and also have governance at various levels of government depending on the industry that binds them legally to their negotiations and functioning.

Originating in Great Britain, trade unions became popular in many countries during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Trade unions may be composed of individual workers, [[professional]]s, [[Retiree|past workers]], students, [[apprentice]]s or the unemployed. Trade union density, or the percentage of workers belonging to a trade union, is highest in the [[Nordic countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TUD] OECD.

== Definition ==
Since the publication of the ''[[History of Trade Unionism]]'' (1894) by [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], the predominant historical view is that a trade union "is a continuous association of wage earners for the purpose of maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment."&lt;ref name="webb" /&gt; [[Karl Marx]] described trade unions thus: "The value of labour-power constitutes the conscious and explicit foundation of the trade unions, whose importance for the […] working class can scarcely be overestimated. The trade unions aim at nothing less than to prevent the reduction of wages below the level that is traditionally maintained in the various branches of industry. That is to say, they wish to prevent the price of labour-power from falling below its value" (''Capital'' V1, 1867, p.&amp;nbsp;1069).

A modern definition by the Australian Bureau of Statistics states that a trade union is "an organization consisting predominantly of employees, the principal activities of which include the negotiation of rates of pay and conditions of employment for its members."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trade Union Census |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/0/9FCBBF538897395ACA2570EC001A6CED?OpenDocument |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet historian R.A. Leeson, in ''United we Stand'' (1971), said:
{{quote|Two conflicting views of the trade-union movement strove for ascendancy in the nineteenth century: one the defensive-restrictive guild-craft tradition passed down through journeymen's clubs and friendly societies, ... the other the aggressive-expansionist drive to unite all 'labouring men and women' for a 'different order of things'.}}

Recent historical research by Bob James in ''Craft, Trade or Mystery'' (2001) puts forward the view that trade unions are part of a broader movement of [[benefit society|benefit societies]], which includes medieval guilds, [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], [[independent Order of Odd Fellows|Oddfellows]], [[Friendly Society|friendly societies]], and other [[fraternal organisation|fraternal organizations]].

The 18th century [[economist]] [[Adam Smith]] noted the imbalance in the rights of workers in regards to owners (or "masters"). In ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', [[s:Chapter 8: Of the Wages of Labour|Book I, chapter 8]], Smith wrote:

{{quote|We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combination of masters, though frequently of those of workmen. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject. Masters are always and everywhere in a sort of tacit, but constant and uniform combination, not to raise the wages of labor above their actual rate[.]

When workers combine, masters ... never cease to call aloud for the assistance of the civil magistrate, and the rigorous execution of those laws which have been enacted with so much severity against the combination of servants, labourers and journeymen.}}

As Smith noted, unions were illegal for many years in most countries, although Smith argued that it should remain illegal to fix wages or prices by employees or employers. There were severe penalties for attempting to organize unions, up to and including execution. Despite this, unions were formed and began to acquire [[political power]], eventually resulting in a body of labour law that not only legalized organizing efforts, but codified the relationship between employers and those employees organized into unions.

==History==
[[File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg|thumb|Early 19th century workplace militancy manifested in the [[Luddism|Luddite riots]], when unemployed workers destroyed labour saving machines]]
The origins of trade unions can be traced back to 18th century Britain, where the [[Industrial Revolution|rapid expansion of industrial society]] then taking place, drew women, children, rural workers and immigrants into the work force in large numbers and in new roles. This pool of unskilled and semi-skilled labour spontaneously organized in fits and starts throughout its beginnings,&lt;ref name="webb"/&gt; and would later be an important arena for the development of trade unions. Trade unions have sometimes been seen as successors to the [[guild]]s of [[medieval Europe]], though the relationship between the two is disputed, as the masters of the guilds employed workers (apprentices and journeymen) who were not allowed to organize.&lt;ref&gt;(1928).

''The Age''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kautsky|first=Karl|title=Trades Unions and Socialism|journal=International Socialist Review |date=April 1901 |volume=1 |issue=10 |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1901/04/unions.htm|accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade unions and collective bargaining were outlawed from no later than the middle of the 14th century when the [[Ordinance of Labourers]] was enacted in the [[Kingdom of England]]. As collective bargaining and early worker unions grew with the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the government began to clamp down on what it saw as the danger of popular unrest at the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. In 1799, the [[Combination Act]] was passed, which banned trade unions and collective bargaining by British workers. Although the unions were subject to often severe repression until 1824, they were already widespread in cities such as [[London]]. Workplace militancy had also manifested itself as [[Luddism]] and had been prominent in struggles such as the [[1820 Rising]] in Scotland, in which 60,000 workers went on a [[general strike]], which was soon crushed. Sympathy for the plight of the workers brought repeal of the acts in 1824, although the [[Combination Act 1825]] severely restricted their activity.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

By the 1810s, the first labour organizations to bring together workers of divergent occupations were formed. Possibly the first such union was the General Union of Trades, also known as the Philanthropic Society, founded in 1818 in [[Manchester]]. The latter name was to hide the organization's real purpose in a time when trade unions were still illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YaBzZXueFFYC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Attempts at General Union|author=G. D. H. Cole|year=2010|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National general unions===
[[File:London Trades Demonstration.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster issued by the London Trades Council, advertising a demonstration held on 2 June 1873]]
The first attempts at setting up a national [[general union]] were made in the 1820s and 30s. The [[National Association for the Protection of Labour]] was established in 1830 by [[John Doherty (trade unionist)|John Doherty]], after an apparently unsuccessful attempt to create a similar national presence with the National Union of Cotton-spinners. The Association quickly enrolled approximately 150 unions, consisting mostly of textile related unions, but also including mechanics, blacksmiths, and various others. Membership rose to between 10,000 and 20,000 individuals spread across the five counties of [[Lancashire]], [[Cheshire]], [[Derbyshire]], [[Nottinghamshire]] and [[Leicestershire]] within a year.{{Ref|Webb}} To establish awareness and legitimacy, the union started the weekly ''Voice of the People'' publication, having the declared intention "to unite the productive classes of the community in one common bond of union."{{Ref|Webb2}}

In 1834, the [[Welsh People|Welsh]] [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Robert Owen]] established the [[Grand National Consolidated Trades Union]]. The organization attracted a range of socialists from Owenites to revolutionaries and played a part in the protests after the [[Tolpuddle Martyrs]]' case, but soon collapsed.

More permanent trade unions were established from the 1850s, better resourced but often less radical. The [[London Trades Council]] was founded in 1860, and the [[Sheffield Outrages]] spurred the establishment of the [[Trades Union Congress]] in 1868, the first long-lived [[national trade union center]]. By this time, the existence and the demands of the trade unions were becoming accepted by [[liberalism|liberal]] [[middle class]] opinion. In ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1871) [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If it were possible for the working classes, by combining among themselves, to raise or keep up the general rate of wages, it needs hardly be said that this would be a thing not to be punished, but to be welcomed and rejoiced at. Unfortunately the effect is quite beyond attainment by such means. The multitudes who compose the working class are too numerous and too widely scattered to combine at all, much more to combine effectually. If they could do so, they might doubtless succeed in diminishing the hours of labour, and obtaining the same wages for less work. They would also have a limited power of obtaining, by combination, an increase of general wages at the expense of profits.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' (1871)[http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/mill/book5/bk5ch10 Book V, Ch.10], para. 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Legalization and expansion===
[[File:1912 Lawrence Textile Strike 1.jpg|thumb|Labour union demonstrators held at bay by soldiers during the 1912 [[Lawrence textile strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]]]]
Trade unions were finally legalized in 1872, after a ''[[Royal Commission on Trade Unions]]'' in 1867 agreed that the establishment of the organizations was to the advantage of both employers and employees.

This period also saw the growth of trade unions in other industrializing countries, especially the United States, Germany and France.

In the United States, the first effective nationwide labour organization was the [[Knights of Labor]], in 1869, which began to grow after 1880. Legalization occurred slowly as a result of a series of court decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1357701/trade-union|title=Trade union|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions]] began in 1881 as a federation of different unions that did not directly enrol workers. In 1886, it became known as the [[American Federation of Labor]] or AFL.

In Germany the [[Free Association of German Trade Unions]] was formed in 1897 after the [[conservativism|conservative]] [[Anti-Socialist Laws]] of Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] were repealed.

In France, labour organization was illegal until 1884. The Bourse du Travail was founded in 1887 and merged with the Fédération nationale des syndicats (National Federation of Trade Unions) in 1895 to form the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)]].

==Trade Union Prevalence Worldwide==
The prevalence of unions in various countries can be measured by the concept of "union density", which is expressed as a percentage of the total number of workers in a given location who are trade union members.&lt;ref name="ILO Stats"&gt;{{cite web |title=Industrial relations |url=https://www.ilo.org/ilostat-files/Documents/description_IR_EN.pdf |publisher=International Labour Organisation |accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trade union density around the world shows great variation.

==Trade unions by country==
===Australia===
Supporters of unions, such as the [[ACTU]] or [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP), often credit trade unions with leading the [[labour movement]] in the early 20th century. This generally sought to end [[child labour]] practices, improve [[worker safety]], increase wages for both union workers and non-union workers, raise the entire society's [[standard of living]], reduce the hours in a work week, provide public education for children, and bring other benefits to [[working class]] families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://actu.com.au/AboutACTU/HistoryoftheACTU/default.aspx History of the ACTU.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121190936/http://www.actu.com.au/AboutACTU/HistoryoftheACTU/default.aspx |date=21 November 2008 }} Australian Council of Trade Unions.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melbourne Trades Hall]] was opened in 1859 with [[Labour council|Trades and Labour Councils]] and [[Trades Hall]]s opening in all cities and most regional towns in the following forty years. During the 1880s [[Trade unions]] developed among [[Sheep shearer|shearers]], [[miner]]s, and [[stevedore]]s (wharf workers), but soon spread to cover almost all [[blue-collar]] jobs. Shortages of labour led to high wages for a prosperous skilled working class, whose unions demanded and got an [[eight-hour day]] and other benefits unheard of in Europe.

[[File:Melbourne eight hour day march-c1900.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eight-hour day]] march circa 1900, outside Parliament House in Spring Street, [[Melbourne]].]]

Australia gained a reputation as "the working man's paradise." Some employers tried to undercut the unions by importing Chinese labour. This produced a reaction which led to all the colonies restricting Chinese and other Asian immigration. This was the foundation of the [[White Australia Policy]]. The "Australian compact", based around centralised industrial arbitration, a degree of government assistance particularly for primary industries, and White Australia, was to continue for many years before gradually dissolving in the second half of the 20th century.

In the 1870s and 1880s, the growing [[Australian labour movement|trade union]] movement began a series of protests against foreign labour. Their arguments were that Asians and Chinese took jobs away from white men, worked for "substandard" wages, lowered working conditions and refused unionisation.&lt;ref name="Markey"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objections to these arguments came largely from wealthy land owners in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Markey"/&gt; It was argued that without Asiatics to work in the tropical areas of the [[Northern Territory]] and Queensland, the area would have to be abandoned.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these objections to restricting immigration, between 1875 and 1888 all Australian colonies enacted legislation which excluded all further Chinese immigration.&lt;ref name="Griffiths" /&gt; Asian immigrants already residing in the Australian colonies were not expelled and retained the same rights as their Anglo and Southern compatriots.

The [[Barton Government]] which came to power following the first elections to the Commonwealth parliament in 1901 was formed by the [[Protectionist Party]] with the support of the [[Australian Labor Party]]. The support of the Labor Party was contingent upon restricting non-white immigration, reflecting the attitudes of the [[Australian Workers Union]] and other labour organisations at the time, upon whose support the Labor Party was founded.

===Baltic states===
In the Baltic states trade unions were the part of the [[Soviet Union]] trade union system and closely connected with the [[party]] in the state. [[Industrial action]]s were not a part of their activities. After [[1990]] trade unions in the [[Baltic states]] have experienced rapid loss of membership and [[economic power]], while employers’ organisations increased both power and membership. Low financial and organisational capacity caused by declining membership adds to the problem of interest definition, aggregation and [[protection]] in [[negotiations]] with employers’ and state organisations. Even the difference exists in the way of organization trade union and density. Starting from 2008 the union density slightly decrease in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]. In case of [[Estonia]] this indicator is lower than in [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] but stays stable average 7 percent from total number of [[employment]]&lt;ref&gt;Dvorak, J., Karnite, R., Guogis, A.

===Belgium===
{{Main|List of trade unions in Belgium}}

With 65% of the workers belonging to a union [[Belgium]] is a country with one of the highest percentages of labour union membership. Only the Scandinavian countries have a higher labour union density. The biggest union with around 1.7 million members is the Christian democrat [[Confederation of Christian Trade Unions]] (ACV-CSC) which was founded in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/957/Binnenland/article/detail/1166041/2010/10/05/Aantal-leden-christelijke-vakbond-neemt-jaar-na-jaar-toe.dhtml|title=Aantal leden christelijke vakbond neemt jaar na jaar toe|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the union can be traced back to the "Anti-Socialist Cotton Workers Union" that was founded in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acv-online.be/acv-online/het-acv/Wie-zijn-we/Geschiedenis/Geschiedenis.html|title=130 jaar ACV-geschiedenis|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second biggest union is the socialist [[General Federation of Belgian Labour]] (ABVV-FGTB) which has a membership of more than 1.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vlaamsabvv.be/art/pid/13618/Hoeveel-leden-telt-het-ABVV.htm|title=Hoeveel leden telt het ABVV? - Vlaams ABVV - Socialistische vakbond in Vlaanderen - Algemeen Belgisch Vakverbond ABVV|website=www.vlaamsabvv.be|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ABVV-FGTB traces its origins to 1857, when the first Belgian union was founded in [[Ghent]] by a group of [[weaving|weavers]]. The socialist union, in its current form, was founded in 1898. The third 'big' union in Belgium is the liberal [[General Confederation of Liberal Trade Unions of Belgium]] (ACLVB-CGSLB) which is relatively small in comparison to the first two with a little under 290 thousand members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclvb.be/over-aclvb/structuurkerncijfers/|title=Structuur en kerncijfers van de ACLVB|date=12 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ACLVB-CGSLB was founded in 1920 in an effort to unite the many small liberal unions. Back then the liberal union was known as the "Nationale Centrale der Liberale Vakbonden van België". In 1930, the ACLVB-CGSLB adopted its current name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclvb.be/over-aclvb/historiek/|title=Geschiedenis van de ACLVB|date=12 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides these "big three" there is a long list of smaller unions, some more influential then others. These smaller unions tend to specialize in one profession or economic sector. Next to these specialized unions there is also the [[:nl:Neutrale en Onafhankelijke Vakbond|Neutral and Independent Union]] that reject the [[pillarization]] that, according to them, the "big three" represent. There is also a small [[Flanders|Flemish]] nationalist union that exists only in the [[Flemish language|Flemish]]-speaking part of Belgium, called the [[:nl:Vlaamse Solidaire Vakbond|Vlaamse Solidaire Vakbond]].

Labour unions have existed in Canada since the early 1800s. There is a record of skilled tradesmen in [[the Maritimes]] having a union organization during the [[War of 1812]]. Canadian unionism had early ties with [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]]. Tradesmen who came from Britain brought traditions of the British trade union movement, and many British unions had branches in Canada. Canadian unionism ties with the United States eventually replaced those with Britain.

Collective bargaining was first recognized in 1945, following a strike by the [[United Auto Workers]] at the [[General Motors]]' plant in [[Oshawa, Ontario]].
Justice [[Ivan Rand]] issued a landmark legal decision following a strike in [[Windsor, Ontario]], involving 17,000 [[Ford]] workers. He granted the union the compulsory check-off of union dues. Rand ruled that all workers in a bargaining unit benefit from a union-negotiated contract. Therefore, he reasoned they must pay union dues, although they do not have to join the union.

The post-[[World War II]] era also saw an increased pattern of unionization in the public service. Teachers, nurses, social workers, professors and cultural workers (those employed in museums, orchestras and art galleries) all sought private-sector collective bargaining rights. The [[Canadian Labour Congress]] was founded in 1956 as the [[national trade union center]] for Canada.

In the 1970s the federal government came under intense pressures to curtail labour cost and inflation. In 1975, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government of [[Pierre Trudeau]] introduced mandatory price and wage controls. Under the new law, wages increases were monitored and those ruled to be unacceptably high were rolled back by the government.

Pressures on unions continued into the 1980s and '90s. Private sector unions faced plant closures in many manufacturing industries and demands to reduce wages and increase productivity. Public sector unions came under attack by federal and provincial governments as they attempted to reduce spending, reduce taxes and balance budgets. Legislation was introduced in many jurisdictions reversing union collective bargaining rights, and many jobs were lost to contractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mapleleafweb.com/old/education/spotlight/issue_51/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727111519/http://www.mapleleafweb.com/old/education/spotlight/issue_51/history.html |archivedate=27 July 2013 |df= }} Retrieved 14 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the Trade Union movement is generally divided on political lines. According to provisional statistics from the Ministry of Labour, trade unions had a combined membership of 24,601,589 in 2002.

A trade union with nearly 2,000,000 members is the Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) which protects the rights of Indian women working in the informal economy.

===Mexico===
Before the 1990s, unions in Mexico had been historically part of a state institutional system. From 1940 until the 1980s, worldwide spread of [[neo-liberalism]] through the [[Washington Consensus]], the Mexican unions did not operate independently, but instead as part of a state institutional system, largely controlled by the ruling party.&lt;ref name="BotzJay01052010"/&gt;

During these 40 years, the primary aim of the labour unions was not to benefit the workers, but to carry out the state's economic policy under their cosy relationship with the ruling party. This economic policy, which peaked in the 1950s and 60s with the so-called "[[Mexican Miracle]]", saw rising incomes and improved standards of living but the primary beneficiaries were the wealthy.&lt;ref name="BotzJay01052010"/&gt;

In the 1980s, Mexico began adhering to Washington Consensus policies, selling off state industries such as railroad and telecommunications to private industries. The new owners had an antagonistic attitude towards unions, which, accustomed to comfortable relationships with the state, were not prepared to fight back. A movement of new unions began to emerge under a more independent model, while the former institutionalized unions had become very corrupt, violent, and led by gangsters. From the 1990s onwards, this new model of independent unions prevailed, a number of them represented by the National Union of Workers / Unión Nacional de Trabajadores.&lt;ref name="BotzJay01052010"&gt;[[Dan La Botz]] ''[http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=5059 U.S.-supported Economics Spurred Mexican Emigration, pt.1]'', interview at ''[[The Real News]]'', 1 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Current old institutions like the Oil Workers Union and the [[National Education Workers' Union]] (''Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de la Educación'', or SNTE) are examples of how the use of government benefits are not being applied to improve the quality in the investigation of the use of oil or the basic education in Mexico as long as their leaders show publicly that they are living wealthily. With 1.4 million members, the teachers' union is [[Latin America]]'s largest; half of Mexico's government employees are teachers. It controls school curriculums, and all teacher appointments. Until recently, retiring teachers routinely "gave" their lifelong appointment to a relative or "sell" it for anywhere in between $4,700 and $11,800.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexico Takes On Teachers Over School Control|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323777204578193882792320310?mod=googlenews_wsj|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=21 December 2012|author=Juan Montes|author2=José de Córdoba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scandinavia===
[[File:Striking workers organised in the Norwegian labour union UNIO.JPG|thumb|Workers on strike in Oslo, Norway, 2012]]
Trade unions (Danish: ''Fagforeninger'', Swedish: ''Fackföreningar'') have a long tradition in [[Scandinavia]]n society. Beginning in the mid-19th century, they today have a large impact on the nature of employment and workers' rights in many of the [[Nordic countries]]. One of the largest trade unions in [[Sweden]] is the [[Swedish Confederation of Trade Unions]], (LO, ''Landsorganisationen''), incorporating unions such as the Swedish Metal Workers' Union (''IF Metall'' = ''Industrifacket Metall''), the Swedish Electricians' Union (Svenska Elektrikerförbundet) and the Swedish Municipality Workers' Union (''Svenska Kommunalarbetareförbundet'', abbreviated ''Kommunal''). One of the aims of IF Metall is to transform jobs into "good jobs", also called "developing jobs".&lt;ref&gt;Anders Bruhn, Anders Kjellberg and Åke Sandberg (2013) [http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/19441202/Nordic_lights_kapitel_4_Bruhn_Kjellberg_Sandberg_Correct.pdf "A New World of Work Challenging Swedish Unions"] in Åke Sandberg (ed.)

Today, the world's highest rates of union membership are in the [[Scandinavia]]n countries. In 2010, the percentage of workers belonging to a union (labour union density) was 68.3% in Sweden and 54.8% in [[Norway]], while it was 34.9% in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and 18.4% in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TUD "Trade Union Density"] OECD StatExtracts. 2010.

Moderate [[New Model Union]]s dominated the union movement from the mid-19th century and where trade unionism was stronger than the political labour movement until the formation and growth of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the early years of the 20th century.

Trade unionism in the United Kingdom was a major factor in some of the economic crises during the 1960s and the 1970s, culminating in the "[[Winter of Discontent]]" of late 1978 and early 1979, when a significant percentage of the nation's public sector workers went on strike. By this stage, some 12,000,000 workers in the United Kingdom were trade union members. However, the election of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] led by [[Margaret Thatcher]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|general election]] in May 1979, at the expense of Labour's [[James Callaghan]], saw substantial trade union reform which saw the level of strikes fall. The level of trade union membership also fell sharply in the 1980s, and continued falling for most of the 1990s. The long decline of most of the industries in which manual trade unions were strong&amp;nbsp;– e.g. steel, coal, printing, the docks&amp;nbsp;– was one of the causes of this loss of trade union members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3526917.stm|title=The trade unions' long decline|date=8 March 2004|accessdate=16 January 2014|work=[[BBC News]]|first=Steve|last=Schifferes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 there were 6,135,126 members in TUC-affiliated unions, down from a peak of 12,172,508 in 1980.

===United States===
{{Main|Labor unions in the United States|Labor history of the United States}}

Labour unions are legally recognized as representatives of workers in many industries in the United States. In the United States, trade unions were formed based on power with the people, not over the people like the government at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kazin|first1=Michael|title=The Populist Persuasion|date=1995|publisher=BasicBooks|page=154|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their activity today centres on [[collective bargaining]] over wages, benefits and working conditions for their membership, and on representing their members in disputes with management over violations of contract provisions. Larger unions also typically engage in lobbying activities and supporting endorsed candidates at the state and federal level.

Most unions in America are aligned with one of two larger umbrella organizations: the [[AFL-CIO]] created in 1955, and the [[Change to Win Federation]] which split from the AFL-CIO in 2005. Both advocate policies and legislation on behalf of workers in the United States and Canada, and take an active role in politics. The AFL-CIO is especially concerned with global trade issues.

In 2010, the percentage of workers belonging to a union in the United States (or total labour union "density") was 11.4%, compared to 18.3% in Japan, 27.5% in Canada and 70% in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TUD Trade Union Density] OECD.

Unions allege that employer-incited opposition has contributed to this decline in membership.

The most prominent unions are among [[public sector]] employees such as teachers, police and other non-managerial or non-executive federal, state, county and municipal employees.

The economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] has asserted that, "Strong unions have helped to reduce inequality, whereas weaker unions have made it easier for [[CEO]]s, sometimes working with market forces that they have helped shape, to increase it." The decline in unionization since the [[Second World War]] in the United States has been associated with a pronounced rise in [[income inequality in the United States|income]] and [[wealth inequality in the United States|wealth inequality]] and, since 1967, with loss of [[American middle class|middle class]] income.&lt;ref&gt;Doree Armstrong (12 February 2014).

Unions may organize a particular section of skilled workers ([[craft unionism]], traditionally found in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US&lt;ref name="Poole, M. 1986"/&gt;), a cross-section of workers from various trades ([[general union]]ism, traditionally found in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Netherlands, the UK and the US), or attempt to organize all workers within a particular industry ([[industrial unionism]], found in Australia, Canada, Germany, Finland, Norway, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the UK and the US). These unions are often divided into "[[Local union|locals]]", and united in national [[List of federations of trade unions|federations]]. These federations themselves will affiliate with [[International]]s, such as the [[International Trade Union Confederation]]. However, in Japan, union organization is slightly different due to the presence of enterprise unions, i.e. unions that are specific to a specific plant or company. These enterprise unions, however, join industry-wide federations which in turn are members of [[RENGO|Rengo]], the Japanese national trade union confederation.

In [[Western Europe]], professional associations often carry out the functions of a trade union. In these cases, they may be negotiating for white-collar or professional workers, such as physicians, engineers or teachers. Typically such trade unions refrain from politics or pursue a more liberal politics than their blue-collar counterparts.

A '''union''' may acquire the status of a "[[juristic person]]" (an artificial legal entity), with a mandate to negotiate with employers for the workers it represents. In such cases, unions have certain legal rights, most importantly the right to engage in [[collective bargaining]] with the employer (or employers) over wages, working hours, and other [[employment contract|terms and conditions of employment]]. The inability of the parties to reach an agreement may lead to [[industrial action]], culminating in either [[strike action]] or management [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]], or binding arbitration. In extreme cases, violent or illegal activities may develop around these events.

[[File:Great Railway Strike 1886 - E St Louis.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Great Southwest Railroad Strike of 1886]] was a trade union strike involving more than 200,000 workers&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2011/08/09/10-biggest-strikes-in-american-history/ The 10 Biggest Strikes in American History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223030/http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2011/08/09/10-biggest-strikes-in-american-history/ |date=2 December 2013 }}". Fox Business. 9 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In other circumstances, unions may not have the legal right to represent workers, or the right may be in question. This lack of status can range from non-recognition of a union to political or criminal prosecution of union activists and members, with many cases of violence and deaths having been recorded historically.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr23/031/2005/en/ Amnesty International report 23 September 2005] – fear for safety of [[SINALTRAINAL]] member José Onofre Esquivel Luna&lt;/ref&gt;

Unions may also engage in broader political or social struggle. [[Social Movement Unionism|Social Unionism]] encompasses many unions that use their organizational strength to advocate for social policies and legislation favourable to their members or to workers in general. As well, unions in some countries are closely aligned with [[political party|political parties]].

Unions are also delineated by the [[service model]] and the [[organizing model]]. The service model union focuses more on maintaining worker rights, providing services, and resolving disputes. Alternately, the organizing model typically involves full-time [[union organizer]]s, who work by building up confidence, strong networks, and leaders within the workforce; and confrontational campaigns involving large numbers of union members. Many unions are a blend of these two philosophies, and the definitions of the models themselves are still debated.

In Britain, the perceived left-leaning nature of trade unions has resulted in the formation of a reactionary right-wing trade union called [[Solidarity&amp;nbsp;– The Union for British Workers|Solidarity]] which is supported by the far-right [[British National Party|BNP]]. In Denmark, there are some newer apolitical "discount" unions who offer a very basic level of services, as opposed to the dominating Danish pattern of extensive services and organizing.&lt;ref&gt;See the website of the Danish discount union "Det faglige Hus" at http://www.detfagligehus.dk/ (website in Danish)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Unison strike rally Oxford 20060328.jpg|thumb|right|A rally of the trade union [[UNISON]] in [[Oxford]] during a strike on 28 March 2006]]
In contrast, in several European countries (e.g. Belgium, Denmark, the [[Netherlands]] and [[Switzerland]]), religious unions have existed for decades. These unions typically distanced themselves from some of the doctrines of orthodox [[Marxism]], such as the preference of atheism and from rhetoric suggesting that employees' interests always are in conflict with those of employers. Some of these Christian unions have had some ties to centrist or conservative political movements and some do not regard strikes as acceptable political means for achieving employees' goals.&lt;ref name="Poole, M. 1986"/&gt; In [[Poland]], the biggest trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] emerged as an [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] movement with [[religious nationalism|religious nationalist]] overtones&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxist.com/revolt-polish-workers101001.htm|title=The economic and social processes that led to the revolt of the Polish workers in the early eighties|first=Professor Jacek Tittenbrun of Poznan University,|last=Poland|website=www.marxist.com|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and today it supports the right-wing [[Law and Justice]] party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.money.pl/artykul/solidarnosc;popiera;kaczynskiego;jak;kiedys;walese,177,0,615857.html Solidarność popiera Kaczyńskiego jak kiedyś Wałęsę] at news.money.pl {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although their political structure and autonomy varies widely, union leaderships are usually formed through democratic [[election]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See E McGaughey, 'Democracy or Oligarchy? Models of Union Governance in the UK, Germany and US' (2017) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2995297 ssrn.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Some research, such as that conducted by the Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acirrt.com/pubs/Trainingwagesupdate.pdf |title=Australian Centre for Industrial Relations Research and Training report |publisher=Acirrt.com |accessdate=2011-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722154704/http://www.acirrt.com/pubs/Trainingwagesupdate.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that unionized workers enjoy better conditions and wages than those who are not unionized.

==Shop types==
Companies that employ workers with a union generally operate on one of several models:
* A '''[[closed shop]]''' (US) or a "pre-entry closed shop" (UK) employs only people who are already union members. The compulsory [[hiring hall]] is an example of a closed shop – in this case the employer must recruit directly from the union, as well as the employee working strictly for unionized employers.
* A '''[[union shop]]''' (US) or a "post-entry closed shop" (UK) employs non-union workers as well, but sets a time limit within which new employees must join a union.
* An '''[[agency shop]]''' requires non-union workers to pay a fee to the union for its services in negotiating their contract. This is sometimes called the [[Rand formula]]. In certain situations involving state public employees in the United States, such as [[California]], "fair share laws" make it easy to require these sorts of payments.
* An '''[[open shop]]''' does not require union membership in employing or keeping workers. Where a union is active, workers who do not contribute to a union may include those who approve of the union contract ([[free riders]]) and those who do not. In the United States, state level [[right-to-work law]]s mandate the open shop in some states. In Germany only open shops are legal; that is, all discrimination based on union membership is forbidden. This affects the function and services of the union.

An EU case concerning Italy stated that, "The principle of trade union freedom in the Italian system implies recognition of the right of the individual not to belong to any trade union ("negative" freedom of association/trade union freedom), and the unlawfulness of discrimination liable to cause harm to non-unionized employees."&lt;ref&gt;Eurofound website "FREEDOM OF ASSOCIATION/TRADE UNION FREEDOM", {{cite web |url=http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/ITALY/FREEDOMOFASSOCIATIONTRADEUNIONFREEDOM-IT.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417233015/http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/emire/ITALY/FREEDOMOFASSOCIATIONTRADEUNIONFREEDOM-IT.htm |archivedate=17 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, previous to this EU jurisprudence, a series of laws introduced during the 1980s by Margaret Thatcher's government restricted closed and union shops. All agreements requiring a worker to join a union are now illegal. In the United States, the [[Taft-Hartley Act]] of 1947 outlawed the closed shop.

In 2006, the European Court of Human Rights found Danish closed-shop agreements to be in breach of Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. It was stressed that Denmark and [[Iceland]] were among a limited number of contracting states that continue to permit the conclusion of closed-shop agreements.&lt;ref&gt;Eurofound, http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2006/01/feature/dk0601104f.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diversity of international unions==
Union law varies from country to country, as does the function of unions. For example, German and Dutch unions have played a greater role in management decisions through participation in corporate boards and [[co-determination]] than have unions in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bamberg|first=Ulrich|url=http://hesa.etui-rehs.org/uk/newsletter/files/BTS012EN_12-15.pdf|title=The role of German trade unions in the national and European standardisation process|journal=TUTB Newsletter|date=June 2004|volume=24–25|accessdate=27 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726035804/http://hesa.etui-rehs.org/uk/newsletter/files/BTS012EN_12-15.pdf|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the United States, collective bargaining is most commonly undertaken by unions directly with employers, whereas in Austria, Denmark, Germany or Sweden, unions most often negotiate with employers associations.

Concerning labour market regulation in the EU, Gold (1993)&lt;ref&gt;Gold, M., 1993. ''The Social Dimension – Employment Policy in the European Community''. Basingstroke England UK: Macmillan Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; and Hall (1994)&lt;ref&gt;Hall, M., 1994. ''Industrial Relations and the Social Dimension of European Integration: Before and after Maastricht'', pp. 281–331 in Hyman, R. &amp; Ferner A., eds.: ''New Frontiers in European Industrial Relations'', Basil Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; have identified three distinct systems of labour market regulation, which also influence the role that unions play:
* "In the '''Continental European System''' of labour market regulation, the government plays an important role as there is a strong legislative core of employee rights, which provides the basis for agreements as well as a framework for discord between unions on one side and employers or employers' associations on the other. This model was said to be found in EU core countries such as Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Italy, and it is also mirrored and emulated to some extent in the institutions of the EU, due to the relative weight that these countries had in the EU until the EU expansion by the inclusion of 10 new [[Eastern Europe]]an member states in 2004.
* In the '''Anglo-Saxon System''' of labour market regulation, the government's legislative role is much more limited, which allows for more issues to be decided between employers and employees and any union or employers' associations which might represent these parties in the decision-making process. However, in these countries, collective agreements are not widespread; only a few businesses and a few sectors of the economy have a strong tradition of finding collective solutions in labour relations. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the UK belong to this category, and in contrast to the EU core countries above, these countries first joined the EU in 1973.
* In the '''Nordic System''' of labour market regulation, the government's legislative role is limited in the same way as in the Anglo-Saxon system. However, in contrast to the countries in the Anglo-Saxon system category, this is a much more widespread network of collective agreements, which covers most industries and most firms. This model was said to encompass Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. Here, Denmark joined the EU in 1973, whereas Finland and Sweden joined in 1995."&lt;ref&gt;Wagtmann, M.A. (2010): Module 3, Maritime &amp; Port Wages, Benefits, Labour Relations. International Maritime Human Resource Management textbook modules. Available at: https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=f90c069a3e6bb729&amp;id=F90C069A3E6BB729%21107#cid=F90C069A3E6BB729&amp;id=F90C069A3E6BB729%21182&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States takes a more [[laissez-faire]] approach, setting some minimum standards but leaving most workers' wages and benefits to collective bargaining and market forces. Thus, it comes closest to the above '''Anglo-Saxon''' model. Also, the Eastern European countries that have recently entered into the EU come closest to the '''Anglo-Saxon''' model.

In contrast, in Germany, the relation between individual employees and employers is considered to be asymmetrical. In consequence, many working conditions are not negotiable due to a strong legal protection of individuals. However, the German flavor or works legislation has as its main objective to create a balance of power between employees organized in unions and employers organized in employers associations. This allows much wider legal boundaries for collective bargaining, compared to the narrow boundaries for individual negotiations. As a condition to obtain the legal status of a trade union, employee associations need to prove that their leverage is strong enough to serve as a counterforce in negotiations with employers. If such an employees association is competing against another union, its leverage may be questioned by unions and then evaluated in a court trial. In Germany, only very few professional associations obtained the right to negotiate salaries and working conditions for their members, notably the medical doctors association Marburger Bund and the pilots association Vereinigung Cockpit. The engineers association [[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure]] does not strive to act as a union, as it also represents the interests of engineering businesses.

Beyond the classification listed above, unions' relations with political parties vary. In many countries unions are tightly bonded, or even share leadership, with a political party intended to represent the interests of the working class. Typically this is a [[left-wing]], [[socialist]], or [[social democrat]]ic party, but many exceptions exist, including some of the aforementioned Christian unions.&lt;ref name="Poole, M. 1986" /&gt; In the United States, trade unions are almost always aligned with the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] with a few exceptions. For example, the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]] has supported [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidates on a number of occasions and the [[Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (1968)|Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization]] (PATCO) endorsed [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1980. In Britain trade union movement's relationship with the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] frayed as party leadership embarked on [[privatization]] plans at odds with what unions see as the worker's interests. However, it has strengthened once more after the Labour party's election of [[Ed Miliband]], who beat his brother [[David Miliband]] to become leader of the party after Ed secured the trade union votes. Additionally, in the past, there was a group known as the [[Conservative Trade Unionists]], or CTU, formed of people who sympathized with right wing Tory policy but were Trade Unionists.

Historically, the [[Republic of Korea]] has regulated collective bargaining by requiring employers to participate, but collective bargaining has only been legal if held in sessions before the [[Korean New Year|lunar new year]].

==International unionization==
The largest trade union federation in the world is the [[Brussels]]-based [[International Trade Union Confederation]] (ITUC), which has approximately 309 affiliated organizations in 156 countries and territories, with a combined membership of 166 million. The ITUC is a federation of national trade union centres, such as the AFL-CIO in the United States and the Trades Union Congress in the United Kingdom. Other global trade union organizations include the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]].

National and regional trade unions organizing in specific industry sectors or occupational groups also form [[global union federation]]s, such as [[Union Network International]], the [[International Transport Workers Federation]], the [[International Federation of Journalists]], the International Arts and Entertainment Alliance or [[Public Services International]].

==Criticisms==
{{Main|Opposition to trade unions}}

In the United States, the outsourcing of labour to Asia, Latin America, and Africa has been partially driven by increasing costs of union partnership, which gives other countries a [[comparative advantage]] in labour, making it more profitable to purchase disorganized, low-wage labour from these regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kramarz |first=Francis |title=Outsourcing, Unions, and Wages: Evidence from data matching imports, firms, and workers |date=19 October 2006|url=http://www.eco.uc3m.es/temp/agenda/wage102006.pdf |accessdate=2007-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milton Friedman]], [[economist]] and advocate of [[laissez-faire capitalism]], sought to show that unionization produces higher wages (for the union members) at the expense of fewer jobs, and that, if some industries are unionized while others are not, wages will tend to decline in non-unionized industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman|first=Milton|title=Price theory|year=2007|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick, NJ|isbn=978-0-202-30969-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EhcI5-D9wREC&amp;pg=PA164|edition=[New ed.], 3rd printing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, several studies have emphasized so-called revitalization strategies where trade unions attempt to better represent labour market outsiders, such as the unemployed and precarious workers. Thus, for instance, trade unions in both Nordic and southern European countries have devised collective bargaining agreements that improved the conditions of temporary agency workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Union inclusiveness and temporary agency workers|last=Vlandas|first=Timothee|last2=Benassi|first2=Chiara|publisher=European Journal of Industrial Relations|year=2016|url=http://ejd.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/06/30/0959680115589485.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Union publications==
Several sources of current news exist about the trade union movement in the world. These include [[LabourStart]] and the official website of the international trade union movement [[Global Unions]]. A source of international news about unions is RadioLabour which provides daily (Monday to Friday) news reports.

''[[Labor Notes]]'' is the largest circulation cross-union publication remaining in the United States. It reports news and analysis about union activity or problems facing the labour movement. Another source of union news is the ''Workers Independent News'', a news organization providing radio articles to independent and syndicated radio shows in the United States.

== Film ==
* The 2010 British film ''[[Made in Dagenham]]'', starring [[Sally Hawkins]], dramatizes the [[Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968]] that aimed for equal pay for women.
* Trade unions were often portrayed in the scripts of [[Jim Allen (playwright)|Jim Allen]].  Examples include ''[[The Big Flame]]'', ''[[The Rank and File]]'' and ''[[Days of Hope]]''.  These films all depict union leaders as untrustworthy and prone to betraying the striking workers.
* The British [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] has been portrayed in numerous films such as ''[[Brassed Off]]'', ''[[Billy Elliot]]'' and ''[[Pride (2014 film)|Pride]]''.
* ''[[Bastard Boys]]'', a 2007 dramatization of the [[1998 Australian waterfront dispute]].
* The 2000 film [[Bread and Roses (2000 film)|''Bread and Roses'']] deals with the struggle of poorly paid janitorial workers in [[Los Angeles]] and their fight for better working conditions and the right to unionize.
* ''[[Hoffa]]'', a 1992 American [[biographical film]] directed by [[Danny DeVito]] and based on the life of [[Teamsters Union]] leader [[Jimmy Hoffa]].
* [[Matewan]] is a 1987 American drama film written and directed by [[John Sayles]] that dramatizes the events of the [[Battle of Matewan]], a coal miners' strike in 1920 in Matewan, a small town in the hills of West Virginia. [[Haskell Wexler]] was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography.
* The 1985 documentary film ''[[Final Offer]]'' by [[Sturla Gunnarsson]] and Robert Collision shows the 1984 union contract negotiations with [[General Motors]].
* The 1979 film ''[[Norma Rae]]'', directed by [[Martin Ritt]] and starring [[Sally Field]], is based on the true story of [[Crystal Lee Sutton|Crystal Lee Jordan]]'s successful attempt to unionize her textile factory.
* The 1978 film ''[[F.I.S.T.]]'', directed by [[Norman Jewison]] and starring [[Sylvester Stallone]], is loosely based on the Teamsters Union and their former President Jimmy Hoffa.
* The 1959 film ''[[I'm All Right Jack]]'', a comedy with [[Peter Sellers]] playing the [[shop steward]] Fred Kite.
* The 1954 film ''[[On the Waterfront]]'', directed by [[Elia Kazan]], concerns union violence among longshoremen.
* Other documentaries: ''[[Made in L.A. (2007 film)|Made in L.A.]]'' (2007); ''[[American Standoff]]'' (2002); ''The Fight in the Fields'' (1997); ''[[With Babies and Banners: Story of the Women's Emergency Brigade]]'' (1979); ''[[Harlan County, USA]]'' (1976); ''The Inheritance'' (1964)

'''William Cullen "Bill" Battle''' (October 9, 1920 – May 31, 2008) was an American diplomat, lawyer, businessman, [[United States Ambassador to Australia]], and president of the [[United States Golf Association]].

==Early and family life==
Battle was born in [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. He was the son of [[John S. Battle]], former [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] of [[Virginia]] (1950–54). While attending the [[University of Virginia]], Battle played on the varsity [[golf]] team, until his graduation in 1941.

Battle served in the [[U.S. Navy]] during [[World War II]] and was awarded the [[Silver Star]]. He was in the same squadron in the South Pacific as [[John F. Kennedy]] and participated in Kennedy's rescue from the island on which he and his crew were marooned.

After the war, he returned to the University of Virginia, earned a law degree in 1947, and was admitted to the Virginia bar.

==Career==
Battle worked in his father's law firm, as well as helped his father win election as Governor of Virginia in 1950. During the [[Massive Resistance]] crisis, both Battles represented the Albemarle County Public Schools, who were being sued by the [[NAACP]] on behalf of parents who wanted their children to attend integrated schools. After joint decisions of the [[Virginia Supreme Court]] and three-judge federal panel on January 19, 1959, undercut the Massive Resistance laws known as the Stanley Plan (which, among other provisions, proposed closing any public school acceding to a court desegregation order), Battle ultimately negotiated a settlement with the NAACP, and Charlotteville public schools reopened.

The younger Battle later worked on Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign and was appointed Ambassador to Australia, serving from 1962 to 1964.

In 1969, in an election that became known for the crumbling of the last vestiges of Massive Resistance and the [[Byrd Organization]], Battle (the Democrats' gubernatorial candidate) lost to Republican [[A. Linwood Holton, Jr.]]. Holton, who put his (white) children in Richmond's (mostly African-American) public schools, became the first Republican governor of the Commonwealth since the end of the [[Reconstruction Era]]. While Senator [[Harry F. Byrd]] had died several years previously, Virginia's other long-term Senator [[A. Willis Robertson]] also lost in this election, and when Senator [[Harry F. Byrd Jr.]] ran for re-election the following year, he did so as an "independent".

Battle later became president and CEO of [[Cannon Mills Company#Fieldcrest|Fieldcrest Mills]], a [[textile]] manufacturer, where he served as president from 1971 to 1981.

In 1978, Battle was elected to the executive committee of the [[United States Golf Association]] where he served until 1989. He served as USGA President from 1988 to 1989. He had also been president of the Mid-Atlantic Golf Association in 1953.

==Family==
Battle died in Charlottesville, Virginia after suffering a stroke. He was survived by his wife Barry (née Webb) Battle, three children, Cullen Battle, Robert Battle and Janie Battle Richards, and six grandchildren
