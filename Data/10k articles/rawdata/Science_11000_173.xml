[[File:Chaucer Astrolabe BM 1909.6-17.1.jpg|thumb|So-called Chaucer Astrolabe dated 1326, similar to the one Chaucer describes, [[British Museum]]]]

'''''A Treatise on the Astrolabe''''' is a [[medieval]] instruction manual on the [[astrolabe]] by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]].  It is notable for being written in prose, in English and for describing a scientific instrument.

==Significance==

The ''Treatise'' is considered the "oldest work in [[English language|English]] written upon an elaborate scientific instrument".{{sfn|Gunther|1929}}  It is admired for its clarity in explaining difficult concepts—although modern readers lacking an actual astrolabe may find the details of the astrolabe difficult to understand.  Robinson believes that it indicates that had Chaucer written more freely composed prose it would have been superior to his translations of [[Boece (Chaucer)|Boece]] and [[The Tale of Melibee|Melibee]].{{sfn|Robinson|1983|p=545}}

Chaucer’s exact source is undetermined but most of his ‘conclusions’ go back, directly or indirectly, to ''Compositio et Operatio Astrolabii'', a Latin translation of [[Mashallah ibn Athari|Messahala]]'s Arabic treatise of the 8th century.  His description of the instrument amplifies Messahala’s and Chaucer’s indebtedness to Messahala was recognised by [[John Selden]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/completeworksofm01dray#page/n49 Drayton's Polyolbion, Drayton's Works, London 1876, I, xliii]&lt;/ref&gt; and established by [[Walter William Skeat]].   Mark Harvey Liddell held Chaucer drew on ''De Sphaera''&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/sphaeramundi00sacr_0 Joannes de Sacro Bosco, ''Sphaera Mundi'']&lt;/ref&gt; of [[John de Sacrobosco]] for the substance of his astronomical definitions and descriptions, but the non-correspondence in language suggests the probable use of an alternative compilation.  A collotype facsimile of the second part of Messahala’s Latin text&lt;ref&gt;[MS. Camb. Univ. Lib.Ii.3.3. p.74] quoted by {{harvnb|Skeat|1872|pp=88 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the portion which is parallel to Chaucer's) is found in Skeat’s ''Treatise On The Astrolabe''.{{sfn|Skeat|1872|pp=88 ff}} and in Gunther's ''Chaucer and Messahalla on the Astrolabe''.{{sfn|Gunther|1929}}{{sfn|Robinson|1983|p=867}}

===Language===

The work is written in free flowing contemporary (1391) English, today commonly referred to as [[middle English]]. Chaucer explains this departure from the norm thus:
:"This treatis, ..., wol I shewe the ... in Englissh, for Latyn ne canst thou yit but small"{{sfn|Robinson|1983|loc=Prologue lines 25–27}}{{efn|Line numbers are taken from the edition of Robinson (1983) and they refer to this edition only.}}{{efn|"This treatise, ..., will I show you ... in English, for Latin you can only as yet [understand] a little"}}

Chaucer proceeds to labour the point somewhat:
:"Grekes ... in Grek; and to Arabiens in Arabik, and to Jewes in Ebrew, and to Latyn folk in Latyn; whiche Latyn folk had hem [conclusions] first out of othere dyverse languages, and writtem hem in her owne tunge, that is to seyn, in Latyn.".{{sfn|Robinson|1983|loc=Prologue lines 30-36}}{{efn|"Greeks ... in Greek; and to Arabians in Arabic, and to Jews in Hebrew, and to Latin people in Latin.  Latin people had them [results] first out of other diverse languages and wrote them in their own tongue, that is to say, in Latin."}}

He continues to explain that it easier for a child to understand things in his own language than struggle with unfamiliar grammar, a commonplace idea today but radical in the fourteenth century. Finally, he appeals to Royalty  (his wife was a lady-in-waiting to [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]'s queen and sister to [[John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster|John of Gaunt]]'s wife) in an early version of the phrase "the King's English":
:"And preie God save the King, that is lord of this language, ..."{{sfn|Robinson|1983|loc=Prologue lines 56–57}}{{efn|preie &lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; pray}}

===Manuscripts===
[[Walter William Skeat|Skeat]] identifies 22 manuscripts of varying quality.  The best he labels ''A'', ''B'' and ''C'' which are MS. Dd. 3.53 (part 2) in the [[Cambridge University Library]],  MS. E Museo 54 in the [[Bodleian Library]] and MS. Rawlinson, Misc. 1262 also in the Bodleian.{{sfn|Skeat|1900|loc=Introduction, sections 2-4}}  ''A'' and ''B'' were apparently written by the same scribe, but ''A'' has been corrected by another hand.  Skeat observes that the errors are just those described in "Chaucers Wordes unto Adam, His Owne Scriveyn": 
:"So ofte a-daye I mot thy werk renewe,
:"It to correcte and eek to rubbe and scrape;
:"And al is thorough thy negligence and rape."{{efn|"Often, I must redo your day's work,
:"Correct it and even rubout and scrape [the ink off the surface];
:"All due to your negligence and corruption [of the text]."}}

''A'' has indeed been rubbed and scraped then corrected by another hand.  This latter scribe Skeat believes to be a better writer than the first.  To this second writer was the insertion of diagrams entrusted.{{sfn|Skeat|1900|loc=Introduction section 2}}  ''A'' and ''B'' were apparently written in London about the year 1400, that is some 9 years after the original composition.{{sfn|Skeat|1900|loc=Introduction section 2}}  Manuscript ''C'' is also early, perhaps 1420 and closely agrees with ''A''.{{sfn|Skeat|1900|loc=Introduction section 4}}

==Audience==

Chaucer opens with the words "Lyte Lowys my sone".{{sfn|Robinson|1983|loc=Prologue line 1}}{{efn|"Little Lewis, my son"}}  In the past a question arose whether the Lowys was Chaucer's son or some other child he was in close contact with.  Kittredge suggested that it could be Lewis Clifford, a son of a friend and possible a godson of Chaucer's.  As evidence he advanced that Lewis Clifford died in October 1391, the year of the composition, which could explain its abandonment.{{sfn|Robinson|1983|p=545}}  Robinson reports though the finding of a document by Professor Manly "recently" (to 1957) which links one Lewis Chaucer with Geoffrey's eldest child Thomas Chaucer.  The likelihood therefore is that the dedication can be taken at face value.{{sfn|Robinson|1983|p=545}}

Chaucer had an eye to the wider public as well.  In the prologue he says:
:Now wol I preie mekely every discret persone that redith or herith this litel tretys..."{{sfn|Robinson|1983|loc=Prologue lines 41–42}}{{efn|"Now I would meekly ask every individual person that reads or hears this little treatise..."}}

==Structure==
The work was planned to have an introduction and five sections:
#A description of the astrolabe
#A rudimentary course in using the instrument
#Various tables of [[longitude]]s, [[latitude]]s, [[declination]]s, etc.
#A "theorike" ([[theory]]) of the motion of the [[celestial bodies]], in particular a table showing the "very moving of the [[moon]]"
#An introduction to the broader field of "astrologie," a word which at the time referred to the entire span of what we now divide into [[astrology and astronomy]].

Part 1 is complete and extant.  Part 2 is also extant with certain caveats described below.  Part 3, if it ever existed, is not extant as part of the Treatise.  Part 4 was, in the opinion of Skeat, probably never written.{{sfn|Skeat|1900|loc=Introduction section 24}}  Part 5 also was probably never written which Skeat approves of.  Indeed, he draws attention to Chaucer's comment at the end of conclusion 4:
:"Natheles these ben observaunces of judicial matere and rytes of payens, in whiche my spirit hath no feith, no knowing of her horoscopum."{{sfn|Skeat|1900|loc=Introduction section 24}}{{efn|"Nevertheless, these are observances of judicial matters and pagan rites, in which my spirit has no faith, nor knowledge of its horoscope."}}

===Part 1===
{{main|Astrolabe}}
The whole of this section describes the form of an astrolabe.  The astrolabe is based on a large plate ("The moder" or "mother") which is arranged to hang vertically from a thumb ring.  It has "a large hool, that resceiveth in hir wombe the thin plates".{{sfn|Robinson|1983|loc=Part I, itme 3}}{{efn|"a large hole that can have thin plates inserted into its womb"}}  The back of the astrolabe is engraved with various scales (see Skeat's sketch below).  Mounted on the back is a sighting rule (Skeat's fig 3, below) "a brod rule, that hath on either end a square plate perced with certein holes".{{sfn|Robinson|1983|loc=Part I, item 13}}{{efn|"a broad rule that has on each end a square plate pierced with a number of holes"}}  To hold it all together there is a "pyn" with a "littel wegge" (wedge) as shown below at Skeat's fig 7.{{sfn|Robinson|1983|loc=Part I, item 14}}  Into the "womb" various thin plates can be inserted which are designed for a particular place: "compowned after the latitude of Oxenforde".{{sfn|Robinson|1983|loc=Introduction, line 10}}{{efn|"constructed for the latitude of Oxford"}}  These plates show the star map.  Surmounting them is a "riet" or "rete" which is a pierced framework carrying the major stars shown at fig 9.  Outside all is another rule, this time not with sighting holes, mounted on the common pivot, see fig 6.

===Part 2===
Part 2 consists of around 40 propositions or descriptions of things that can be done with the astrolabe.  The exact number is uncertain since of the later propositions some are of disputed or doubtful authenticity.  Skeat accepts that propositions 1-40 are unambiguously genuine.  Robinson generally follows Skeat's reasoning.  These first 40 propositions form the cannon of part 2, the propositions that follow are usually labeled "Supplementary Propositions".

==The astrolabe==
{{Details|Astrolabe}}

The astrolabe was a sophisticated precision instrument.  With it one could determine the date, time (when the sky was clear), the position of stars, the passage of the zodiac, latitude on the earth's surface, tides and basic surveying.  Care must be taken not to dismiss the [[astrology|astrological]] aspects; as well as any mystical interpretation astrological terminology was used for what today would be recognized as astronomy.  Determining when the sun entered a house (or sign) of the [[zodiac]] was a precise determination of the calendar.

Skeat produced a number of sketches to accompany his edition:

The '''Aeronautical/Astronautical Research Laboratory''' (AARL) is an [[aerospace engineering]] research facility operated by [[Ohio State University]]. It is the principal research facility of the College of Engineering's Department of Aerospace and Astronautical Engineering. It is located on the grounds of [[Ohio State University Airport]], in [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://aerospace.osu.edu/research-facilities |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327073152/http://aerospace.osu.edu/research-facilities |archivedate=2010-03-27 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

==Facilities==
The research activities conducted at AARL are based around a compressed air system that is capable of holding 1500 cubic feet (42.5 m&lt;small&gt;3&lt;/small&gt;) of air at 2560 psia (17.65MPa), a 2 MW on site DC power station, and vacuum system capable of holding suction at .15 psia (1.01 kPa).&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://aerospace.osu.edu/aeronauticalastronautical-research-laboratory |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327072904/http://aerospace.osu.edu/aeronauticalastronautical-research-laboratory |archivedate=2010-03-27 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; 
The AARL houses four active [[wind tunnels]] (dimensions of test section given in name):

:-3'x5'(.9m x 1.5m) Subsonic Wind Tunnel, an open circuit, Eiffel wind tunnel with top speeds of 150 ft/s (45m/s)&lt;ref&gt; https://aerospace.osu.edu/subsonic-wind-tunnels{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

:-6"x22" (15cm x 56cm) Transonic Windtunnel, a blowdown wind tunnel used specifically for airfoil research&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aerospace.osu.edu/transonic-wind-tunnel |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623102634/https://aerospace.osu.edu/transonic-wind-tunnel |archivedate=2010-06-23 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; 

:-6"x3" (15cm x 6cm) Transonic Wind Tunnel, a small wind tunnel used to research heat transfer in the high subsonic range&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; 

:-6" (15cm) Hypersonic Wind Tunnel a blowdown wind tunnel capable of sustaining speeds of M=6&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://aerospace.osu.edu/mach-6-hypersonic-wind-tunnel |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623101939/https://aerospace.osu.edu/mach-6-hypersonic-wind-tunnel |archivedate=2010-06-23 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Computers complement wind tunnel and all other experimentation at AARL. [[LabVIEW]] is extensively used for experiment documentation and control, while [[FLUENT]] and the [[Ohio Supercomputer Center]] are used for [[computational fluid dynamics]] experimentation.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.star-tech-inc.com/id79.html &lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent area of research at AARL is jet engine test cell design. Under the patronage of [[GE Aviation]], Ohio State Engineering has been at the forefront of jet engine test cell design for over 25 years.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://aerospace.osu.edu/jet-engine-cell |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623072534/https://aerospace.osu.edu/jet-engine-cell |archivedate=2010-06-23 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  To test jet engine test cell designs, scale models of the interior of the building proposed to hold the test cell, as well as the test cell itself are reconstructed at AARL. The models are incredibly detailed, going as far as to contain scale furniture. Any number of scale jet engines can then be placed in the model, including a 1/12 scale model of the [[GE90]], the largest jet engine ever built.

The AARL houses numerous other research facilities, including the Mechanical Engineering Department's Gas Dynamics and Turbulence Laboratory(GDTL) and Gas Turbine Lab. GDTL works cooperatively with [[NASA Glenn]] Research Center and [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]] researching [[aeroacoustics]] and high [[reynolds number]] flow related to propulsion.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.mecheng.osu.edu/gdtl/research-overview |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621143009/http://www.mecheng.osu.edu/gdtl/research-overview |archivedate=2010-06-21 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The Gas Turbine Lab is an [[R&amp;D]] laboratory that focuses on the development of gas turbine aircraft engines and has an annual budget of over $4 million. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=https://aerospace.osu.edu/gas-turbine-lab |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622101950/http://aerospace.osu.edu/gas-turbine-lab |archivedate=2010-06-22 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astronomical rings''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: '''annuli astronomici'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Annulus Astronomicus |url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/students/98to99/Inst/Instpgs/2a.Gemmasrings.html |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Gemma's rings''', are an early [[astronomical]] instrument. The instrument consists of three rings, each representing the [[celestial equator]], [[declination]], and the [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]].

It can be used as a [[sun dial#Universal equinoctial ring dial|sun dial]] to tell time, if the approximate [[latitude]] and [[season]] is known, or to tell latitude, if the time is known or observed (at [[solar noon]]). It may be considered to be a simplified, portable [[armillary sphere]], or a more complex form of [[astrolabe]].

==History==
Parts of the instrument go back to instruments made and used by [[Greek astronomy|ancient Greek astronomers]]. [[Gemma Frisius]] combined several of the instruments into a small, portable, astronomical-ring instrument. He first published the design in 1534,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sorgeloos|first=Claude |authorlink=  |year= 2001 |title= Un post-incunable retrouvé : L'Usus annuli astronomici de Gemma Frisius, Louvain et Anvers, 1534

&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Petrus Apianus]]'s  ''Cosmographia'' in 1539. These ring instruments combined terrestrial and celestial calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wallis|first=Helen|date=1984|title=England's Search for the Northern Passages in the Sixteenth and Early Seventeenth Centuries|jstor=40510308|journal=Arctic|volume=37|issue=4|pages=453–472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
===Fixed astronomical rings===
[[File:Basel 2012-10-06 Batch Part 5 (118).JPG|thumb|right|Equinoctal sun dial]]
Fixed astronomical rings are mounted on a plinth, like [[armillary sphere]]s, and can be used as [[sundials]].

===Traveller's sundial or universal equinoctal ring dial===
The dial is suspended from a cord or chain; the suspension point on the vertical meridian ring can be changed to match the local latitude. The time is read off on the equatorial ring; in the example below, the center bar is twisted until a sunray passes through a small hole and falls on the horizontal equatorial ring.

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Ringsundial displayV.jpg|Traveller's sundial, in use, with position of light beam (inside highlighting square) being read off to tell the time. See [[:Commons:File:Ringsundial displayV.jpg|annotations for how to read the sundial]].
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Sun ring===
A sunring or farmer's ring is a latitude-specific simplification of astronomical rings. On one-piece sunrings, the time and month scale is marked on the inside of the ring; a sunbeam passing through a hole in the ring lights a point on this scale. Newer sunrings are often made in two parts, one of which slides to set the month; they are usually less accurate.

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Sonnenring.JPG|A simpler sundial ring, not in use
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Sea ring===
In 1610, [[Edward Wright (mathematician)|Edward Wright]] created the '''sea ring''', which mounted a universal ring dial over a magnetic compass.  This permitted mariners to determine the time and [[magnetic variation]] in a single step.&lt;ref name="may"&gt;May, William Edward, ''A History of Marine Navigation'', G. T. Foulis &amp;amp; Co. Ltd., Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, 1973, {{ISBN|0-85429-143-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and function==
The three rings are oriented with respect to the local [[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]], the planet's equator, and a celestial object. The instrument itself can be used as a [[plumb bob]] to align it with the vertical. The instrument is then rotated until a single light beam passes through two points on the instrument. This fixes the orientation of the instrument in all three [[axis of rotation|axes]].

The angle between the vertical and the light beam gives the [[solar elevation]]. The [[solar elevation]] is a function of latitude, time of day, and season. Any one of these variables can be determined using astronomical rings, if the other two are known.

The altitude of the sun does not change much in a single day at the poles (where the sun rises and sets once a year), so rough measurements of solar altitude don't vary with time of day at high latitudes.

===Use as a calendar sundial===

When the solar time is exactly noon, or known from another clock, the instrument can be used to determine the time of year.

The meridional ring can function as the [[gnomon]], when the rings are used as a [[sundial]]. A horizontal line aligned on a meridian with a gnomon facing the noon-sun is termed a meridian line and does not indicate the time, but instead the day of the year. Historically they were used to accurately determine the length of the solar year. A fixed meridional ring on its own can be used as a [[commons:File:Leicester University analemma sundial.jpg|analemma calendar sundial]], which can be read only at noon.

When the shadow of the rings are aligned so that they appear to be in the same, or nearly the same, place, the meridian identifies itself.{{clarify|date=December 2016}}

===Meridional ring===
The ''[[meridian (astronomy)|meridian]]'' ring is placed vertically, then rotated (relative to the celestial object) until it is parallel to the local north-south line. The whole ring is thus parallel to the circle of longitude passing through the place where the user is standing.

Because the instrument is often supported by the meridional ring, it is often the outermost ring, as it is in the traveller's rings illustrated above. There, a sliding suspension shackle is attached to the top of the meridional ring, from which the whole device can be suspended. The meridional ring is marked in degrees of latitude (0-90, for each hemisphere). When properly used, the pointer on the support points to the latitude of the instrument's location. This tilts the equatorial ring so that it lies at the same angle to the vertical as the local equator.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?partid=1&amp;assetid=494614&amp;objectid=55055 Retrieved 2013-11-10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gilai.com/product_848/Mid-18th-Century-Brass-Astronomical-ring-dial.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equatorial ring===
The ''[[equatorial ring]]'' occupies a plane parallel to the celestial equator, at right angles to the meridian. It is aligned by

*being attached to the meridional ring at the marking for latitude zero (see above)
*being aligned to the declension ring, which is aligned to the celestial object.

Often equipped with a graduated scale, it can be used to measure [[right ascension]]. On the traveller's sundial shown above, it is the inner ring.

This ring is sometimes engraved with the months on one side and corresponding zodiac signs on the outside; very similar to an astrolabe. 
Others have been found to be engraved with two twelve-hour time scales. Each twelve-hour scale is stretched over 180 degrees and numbered by hour with hashes every 20 minutes and smaller hashes every four minutes. The inside displays a calendrical scale with the names of the months indicated by their first letters, with a mark to show every 5 days and other marks to represent single days. On these, the outside of the ring is engraved with the corresponding symbols of the zodiac signs. The position of the symbol indicates the date of the entry of the sun into this particular sign. The vernal equinox is marked at March 15 and the autumnal equinox is marked at September 10.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=55055&amp;partId=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declination ring===
[[File:Astronomical Ring of an unusual type Wellcome M0017340.jpg|thumb|Astronomical ring with an [[alidade]] on the declination ring (folded closed).]]
The ''[[declination]] ring'' is moveable, and rotates on pivots set in the meridian ring. An imaginary line connecting these pivots is parallel to the Earth's axis. The declination "ring" of the traveller's sundial above is not a ring at all, but an oblong loop with a slider for setting the season.

This ring is often equipped with vanes and pinholes for use as the [[alidade]] of a [[dioptra]] (see image). It can be used to measure [[declination]].

This ring is also often marked with the zodiac signs and twenty-five stars, similar to the [[astrolabe]].

'''Bravo Glacier''' is a glacier on [[Greenwich Island]] in the [[South Shetland Islands]], [[Antarctica]] extending 2.1&amp;nbsp;km in northwest-southeast direction and 2.3&amp;nbsp;km in southwest-northeast direction and draining the south slopes of [[Dryanovo Heights]] to flow southeastwards into [[Shopski Cove]].

The feature was probably named after an officer in the Chilean ship ''Lientur'' that took part in the 1952-53 Chilean survey of [[Yankee Harbour]].

==Location==
The glacier is centred at {{coord|62|30|20|S|59|49|20|W|type:glacier}} (Bulgarian mapping in 2005 and 2009).

'''''Brief Candle in the Dark: My Life in Science''''' is the second volume of the autobiographical memoir by British [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]]. It was published in English in September 2015.&lt;ref name=Candle&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=Brief Candle in the Dark: My Life in Science |publisher=[[Bantam Press]] |year=2015 |isbn=978-0-59307-256-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The first volume, titled ''[[An Appetite for Wonder|An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist]]'', tells the first thirty-five years of his life, until the publication of ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' in 1976. In ''Brief Candle in the Dark'', Richard Dawkins continues his autobiography until an academic party for and "... on my seventieth birthday,....".&lt;ref name=Candle/&gt;&lt;!-- At pages 437 and (re it being both for and on) p. 442 in the credit for the final picture  --&gt; He explains his inspirations, ideas, encounters and history. He mentions some of his 'heroes' such as [[Charles Darwin]], [[Peter Medawar]], [[Nikolaas Tinbergen|Niko Tinbergen]], [[W. D. Hamilton|Bill Hamilton]], [[John Maynard Smith]], [[Douglas Adams]], [[Carl Sagan]] and [[David Attenborough]].&lt;ref name=Candle/&gt;

He develops subjects such as his scientific work, travels and conferences, his [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] (''[[Growing Up in the Universe]]'', in 1991), his work as [[Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science|Professor for the Public Understanding of Science]] in [[New College, Oxford|Oxford]], his documentaries (such as ''[[The Root of All Evil?]]'') as well as his personal life and his books.

== Reviews ==
''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' found the book "an impressive overview".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Kirkus Reviews]]|title=''Brief Candle in the Dark''|date=2015-06-15|accessdate=2015-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]] wrote that the book "presents a public life more than a private one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dwight |last=Garner |authorlink=Dwight Garner (critic)  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/books/review-brief-candle-in-the-dark-by-richard-dawkins-puts-intellect-over-intimacy.html |title=Review: ‘Brief Candle in the Dark,’ by Richard Dawkins, Puts Intellect Over Intimacy |work=The New York Times |date=7 October 2015 |accessdate=1 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Shapin]] wrote that the book is "a loose and multiply digressive collection of reminiscences, anecdotes, addenda, quotes from admirers, and extended quotes from himself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Shapin |authorlink=Steven Shapin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/26/brief-candle-in-the-dark-richard-dawkins-science-review |title=Brief Candle in the Dark: My Life in Science by Richard Dawkins – review |work=The Guardian |date=26 August 2015 |accessdate=3 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burke and Wills Plant Camp''' is a heritage-listed [[campsite]] near [[Betoota, Queensland|Betoota]], [[Shire of Diamantina]], [[Queensland]], Australia. It is also known as Return Camp 46 and Burke and Wills Camp R46. It was added to the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 11 December 2008.&lt;ref name="qhr"&gt;{{cite QHR|23825|Burke and Wills "Plant Camp"|645622|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Burke and Wills Plant Camp on [[Durrie Station]] is associated with explorers [[Robert O'Hara Burke]] and [[William John Wills]]. On the 3 April 1861, on their return trip from the [[Gulf of Carpentaria]], the [[Burke and Wills expedition]] were approximately {{convert|100|km|mi}} north of the present day [[Birdsville]]. That evening Wills made his last astronomical observations and then "planted" his instruments and associated equipment, presumably in a shallow hole, on an unnamed creek near return camp XLVI (also known Camp R46 or Plant Camp). This return trip was a desperate race to reach their depot camp number LXV - the site of the famous [[Burke and Wills expedition#The Dig Tree|Dig Tree]] located close to the border with South Australia and near the present [[Nappa Merrie]] Homestead.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Burke, the leader of the expedition, was born in 1821 in [[County Galway]], Ireland, of Protestant gentry. Following an education at the [[Woolwich Academy]], the young Burke served as a lieutenant in the Austrian cavalry and later the Irish Mounted Constabulary, before emigrating to Australia in 1853. After several postings with the [[Victorian Police]], Burke was appointed to lead the Victorian Exploring Expedition, a position he had anxiously and diligently pursued. Wills, born in [[Devon]] England in 1834, trained in medicine. He migrated to Australia in 1853 and after a short stint working as a shepherd at [[Deniliquin]], New South Wales, Wills assisted his father with his medical practice at [[Ballarat]], Victoria. Wills later studied surveying and astronomy, and accompanied the expedition as astronomer, surveyor, and third-in-command, behind camel master George Landells.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Victorian Exploring Expedition was undertaken in the spirit of previous epics such as [[Edward Eyre]]'s journey between Western Australia and South Australia in 1840, and [[Ludwig Leichhardt]]'s 1844-1845 trek from the [[Darling Downs]] in Queensland to Port Essington near [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]]. Organised by the [[Royal Society of Victoria]] and supported by the government, the expedition's objectives were hazy, beyond the desire to make the already-prosperous colony mightier by taking the lead in exploration efforts. The expedition would prove extremely expensive both financially and in lives, yet was ultimately successful in its bid to beat South Australia's [[John McDouall Stuart]] to the first north-south crossing of the continent.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

On 20 August 1860, a large crowd in Melbourne provided a farewell for the explorers. The party comprised fifteen men, twenty-six Indian camels with their drivers, packhorses, wagons, food and supplies. In early October the party reached [[Menindee]] on the [[Darling River]]. Burke had already begun to shed baggage, determined to travel light and fast, leaving behind much of the equipment and some provisions at [[Balranald]]. Burke left more provisions at Menindee. He also quarrelled with Landells, who subsequently resigned. Burke promoted Wills to second-in-charge and engaged local man William Wright as third officer. Despite having received clear instructions that he was to establish his main base camp at Cooper's Creek, Burke pressed on quickly with an advance party of eight, leaving the remainder of the men and stores under the charge of Wright. Wright lingered at Menindee for three months, contrary to Burke's orders to proceed to Coopers' Creek as soon as possible, and Wright failed to arrive at Cooper's Creek with the reserve provisions and transport before Burke returned from the Gulf of Carpentaria. On 6 December 1860 Burke and his seven men established Camp LXV (65) at Cooper's Creek, having halted at several other spots along the Creek during the preceding three-and-a-half weeks while searching for the best location for a longer-term depot. Here Burke split his party once again, and on 16 December pressed on to the Gulf. This northern party was made up of Burke as party leader, Wills as second-in-command and astronomer, navigator and meteorologist, King as attendant to the party's camels, and Gray as camp organizer. Brahe, Thomas McDonough, William Patten and Dost Mahomet were instructed by Burke to wait for at least three months (the more cautious Wills preferred four months), before retracing their steps homewards via the Darling River. During their stay at Camp LXV, Brahe's party erected a timber [[stockade]] to protect themselves and their supplies from the unwanted interest of local Aborigines.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Following a line to the northeast of Stuart's proposed track, Burke and his team arrived at the Little Bynoe River on 11 February 1861. By this time, they were 57 days out from Cooper's Creek and 13 days over that planned. As they were running low on stores and concerned about meeting the remainder of the exploration party at Cooper's Creek, Burke and Wills left Gray and King at Camp 119 and pushed further north through the mangroves in an attempt to reach the Gulf of Carpentaria coast. However, after three days of difficult travel, they returned south picking up Gray and King.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The return trip from the Gulf of Carpentaria became a desperate race to reach the depot camp on Cooper's Creek on low rations and with failing camels. On 3 April 1861, the Burke and Wills Expedition were approximately {{convert|100|km|mi}} north of present-day Birdsville. Burke on that day gave an order "for leaving behind everything but the grub and just what we carry on our backs." That evening Wills made his last astronomical observations and then, according to the notes in his astronomical journal, "planted" his equipment in a shallow hole on an unnamed creek near Camp RXLVI (Camp R46).&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Between February 14 and April 21, the four men, with Gray sickening, continued to struggle back towards Cooper's Creek. Gray became increasingly ill suffering from "pain in his head and limbs". His condition continued to deteriorate until he died on the morning of April 17.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

On the morning of 21 April 1861, William Brahe and his party of three others including the seriously-injured Patten, left for Menindee. Burke's party reached Camp LXV that same evening with his two surviving though exhausted camels and with perilously low stores. Brahe had left messages carved into the Dig Tree pointing to the cache of supplies. Subsequent events would prove to be a litany of missed opportunities and failure to communicate. A week after their departure from Camp LXV, Brahe met with Wright's party, heading north and finally en route to Cooper's Creek. Brahe and Wright then returned to the camp, but having noticed no evidence of Burke's return on 21 April, left no further messages or indications and retraced their steps southwards. Brahe arrived in Melbourne late in June 1861 to report on the missing men. On April 23 Burke's trio began the {{convert|150|mi|adj=on}} westward journey to Blanchewater Station, near [[Mount Hopeless (Queensland)|Mount Hopeless]] in South Australia, preferring to take this direction over the longer, but known, journey to Menindee. Twice they were forced back to Cooper's Creek due to lack of water to the west. They then remained along the Creek throughout June. On 30 May 1861 Wills had returned to Camp LXV. He found no evidence of Brahe's return in early May, and placed his journals and a new note in the buried cache for fear of accidents, and returned to his companions waiting further along Cooper's Creek. After surviving on ground nardoo, which was slowly poisoning them due to their lack of expertise in its preparation in leaching out the toxins, Wills died alone on the banks of Cooper's Creek on 27 or 28 June. He had insisted that his companions head further down the creek to seek assistance from the Aborigines. A day or two later, Burke also succumbed, having sent King on to look for help. With the assistance of Aborigines, King survived along the watercourse until found on 15 September 1861 by [[Alfred William Howitt]]'s search party.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

When it became known that the well-publicised [[Burke and Wills expedition]] had foundered, a number of search parties were quickly organised. Howitt left from Melbourne, [[John McKinlay]] from [[Adelaide]], [[Frederick Walker (native police commandant)|Frederick Walker]] from [[Rockhampton]], and [[William Landsborough]] from [[Brisbane]]. Howitt's party, which included Brahe and King, arrived at Camp LXV on 13 September 1861. The Royal Commission was told that they found the depot as Mr Brahe had left it, the plant untouched, and nothing removed of the useless things lying about, but a piece of leather. The party located Wills' remains where his body had been covered by King, some miles downstream of Camp LXV. They buried Wills on 18 September 1861, and inscribed a tree. Field books, notebooks and various small articles were recovered. Three days later and approximately {{convert|7|mi}} away, Howitt found Burke's remains near Innamincka Waterhole, {{convert|2|mi}} north of [[Innamincka, South Australia|Innamincka]]) in South Australia. Burke was buried wrapped in a [[Union Jack]], under a box tree on the south-eastern bank of Cooper's Creek. Howitt blazed this tree at the head of Burke's grave. The [[Royal Geographical Society]], organised to promote exploration, awarded Burke a posthumous RGS Founder's Medal in 1862. Wills was awarded nothing, as the Society's policy was to award only one medal to an exploration party. King received a gold watch, as did McKinlay, Landsborough and Walker for leading their various search parties. These search parties helped open up vast areas of inland Australia for settlement, as a result of the increased knowledge of the country they brought back with them.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

A Commission of Enquiry was organised to investigate the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Burke and Wills. The enquiry was held in Melbourne in November and December 1861. The commissioners interviewed thirteen people connected to the expedition, including the only survivor John King, and examined a range of evidence including Wills' journal. The findings of the enquiry were published in a report released at the end of January 1862. While critical of Brahe's decision to leave the depot camp before he was rejoined by Burke, Wills and King, the commission reported that the many of the calamities that befell the expedition might have been averted, including their deaths, if expedition leader Burke kept a regular [[Diary|journal]] and gave written orders to his men.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

In 2010, a student of the [[University of Queensland]], Nick Hadnutt, published his PhD thesis which undertook a detailed analysis of artefacts found at the site when compared with the known dates of the expedition using primary and secondary sources to confirm the authenticity of the site. The thesis concluded that the site was indeed Burke and Wills Camp 46R.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Identifying Camp 46r, the Burke and Wills 'Plant Camp'|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/191742168|publication-date=2011-06-25|author1=Hadnutt, Nick; School of Social Science, The University of Queensland|publisher=Australian Archaeological Association Inc|accessdate=10 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Burke and Wills Plant Camp boundary map, 2015.jpg|thumb|Boundary map, 2015]]
The Burke and Wills Plant Camp site is located on an unnamed creek on Durrie station, approximately two hours drive north of Birdsville. The archaeological record of the Plant Camp has two key components in two different locations. The majority of the European artefacts found to date were located at the terminus of the intermittent unnamed creek and a [[claypan]]. Artefacts have been found all along the unnamed creek in varying concentrations. All artefacts are located within the influence of the drainage pattern of the unnamed creek, however artefacts are mostly found on the high points within this local environment. The depth of the artefacts also varies with the majority being found close to the surface or within the top {{convert|10|–|20|mm}} of soil.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

A number of artefacts have been collected by a number of researchers who have visited the site including canvas/leather sewing kit needles, thrust block, duck bill leather sewing pliers, percussion cap, nipples and bullets consistent with the calibre, vintage and make of weapons taken on the Burke and Wills Expedition. These artefacts have been compared with the "List of Stores III" from the expedition and found to be consistent with goods that were officially supplied.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The remainder of the site consists of two scarred trees located {{convert|2|km|mi}} and {{convert|2.7|km|mi}} east along the creek from the main artefact concentration. The origin of the scars on these trees remains unknown, but it is possible that these are the remains of blazes associated with the Burke and Wills expedition, providing a visible marker for the location of the Plant Camp for other explorers, or in the case of this expedition, to any potential rescuers.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Evidence of indiscriminate looting of archaeological artefacts is visible throughout the Plant Camp site. More extensive excavations have also been undertaken at the base of the two scarred trees thought to be associated with the Burke and Wills expedition. Both tree locations show evidence of extensive shovel testing or turning of soil - presumably the digger was searching for buried instruments of other artefacts. Ongoing disturbance is a key threat facing Plant Camp as the process of retrieving surface artefacts without sufficient concern for their provenance and the indiscriminate digging up of artefacts removes them from their archaeological context and thus limits our ability to obtain reliable information about the Burke and Wills expedition.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
Burke and Wills "Plant Camp" was listed on the [[Queensland Heritage Register]] on 11 December 2008 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Burke and Wills Plant Camp is significant in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history as evidence of the nineteenth century interest in scientific exploration. The Burke and Wills expedition, and the subsequent search parties sent to find the lost explorers, contributed to the opening up of Queensland and large portions of inland Australia to pastoralism. The process of pastoral expansion commenced soon after the expedition concluded. Expansion into the largely unknown areas of western Queensland and the gulf forever changed these regions.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Plant Camp is significant as a representation of the past in the present, providing tangible evidence of the first overland north-south crossing of the continent from settled areas in Victoria through Queensland to the Gulf of Carpentaria covering a distance of around {{convert|2800|km}}. The place was the final camp established by the explorers and is representative of a key stage in the expedition when Burke and Wills decided to abandon most of their equipment.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Plant Camp is significant for its potential to contain additional archaeological artefacts associated with the Burke and Wills expedition, particularly equipment associated with Wills' decision to "plant" or bury his astronomical equipment and Burke's order to leave behind everything except food and whatever they could carry on their backs. The Plant Camp has been identified through the presence of archaeological artefacts and two blazed trees situated along an unnamed ephemeral creek line on Durrie Station. Artefacts located to date include percussion caps, nipples, buckles, canvas/leather sewing kit needles, thrust block and duck bill leather sewing pliers a number of the brass fittings, including a clasp, escutcheon, latch and hinge all suggestive of a possible instrument case. These artefacts date to the same period ({{circa|1850}}s-1860s) as the Burke and Wills expedition and are consistent with items listed in the detailed "List of Stores III" of goods officially supplied to the expedition.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

Plant Camp is significant for its research potential, especially future comparative analysis of archaeological artefacts with others documented at other Burke and Wills campsites. Comparative analysis could provide new and important information on the decisions made by the explorers throughout the expedition, including the rationing of supplies and the value placed on certain objects and items in their possession. For example, scientific analysis may reveal evidence as to why the explorers kept certain scientific instruments and abandoned more practical and useful items which could have increased their chances of success and ultimately survival. Comparative analysis of Plant Camp archaeological artefacts with other early exploration sites across Queensland may also benefit our understanding and knowledge of the conduct of those exploration events.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Plant Camp has potential to substantiate or challenge documented accounts and myths surrounding the final days of the Burke and Wills expedition. Documentary evidence is limited to that provided in William Wills' journals and to that recorded by the Commission of Enquiry for the expedition held in 1862. Additional archaeological research at the Plant Camp may lead to a greater understanding of the reasons behind the ultimate failure of the expedition and enable a better understanding of the hardships endured by the explorers during the expedition.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

The Plant Camp is significant for its special association with prominent Australian explorers Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills, who both died during the return journey in 1861.&lt;ref name=qhr/&gt;

== Description ==

=== Apollo 11 ===
{{main|Apollo 11 lunar sample display}}
The California Apollo 11 lunar sample display commemorative plaque display consists of four "moon rock" rice-size particle specimens that were collected by Apollo 11 astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] in 1969 and a small [[Flag of California|California state flag]] that was taken to the moon and back on Apollo 11.&lt;ref name = "moon rocks Apollo 11"/&gt;

The 4 "moon rocks" weigh about 0.05 grams total and are entirely enveloped in a clear plastic button the size of a coin which is mounted to a wooden board approximately a foot square on a small [[podium]] pedestal display. The small podium plaque display also has mounted on it a small California state flag that had been taken to the moon and back, which lies directly below the "moon rocks". The California Apollo 11 lunar plaque display was given to the people of the state of California as a gift by President Richard Nixon. Similar lunar sample displays were distributed to all the other states of the United States and all the countries (at the time) of the world.&lt;ref name = "moon rocks Apollo 11"/&gt;

=== Apollo 17 ===
{{main|Apollo 17 lunar sample display}}

The California Apollo 17 lunar sample display commemorative style plaque, measuring 10 by 14 inches, consists of one "moon rock" particle specimen that was cut from [[lunar basalt 70017]] and a California state flag. The [[basalt]] 70017 was collected by Apollo 17 astronaut [[Harrison Schmitt]] on the moon in 1972. Once lunar basalt 70017 was brought back to earth from the moon, the basalt moon rock was cut up into small fragments of approximately 1 gram. The specimen was encased in a plastic ball and mounted on the wooden plaque along with the California state flag which had been taken to the moon and back by the crew of Apollo 17. The plaque was then distributed in 1973 by President Richard Nixon to the state of California, as he did that year to the other 49 states (the same as for the Apollo 11 plaque gifts). This was done as a goodwill gesture to promote peace and harmony.&lt;ref name = "Apollo 17 moon rock"/&gt;

== History ==
The California Apollo 17 lunar sample display was housed in the San Diego Aero-Space Museum. On February 22&amp;ndash;23, 1978, the museum, which is part of the Panama-California Exposition Buildings (then called the Electric Building) in [[Balboa Park (San Diego)|Balboa Park]], San Diego, burned down. No one was injured, although a transient who sometimes lodged at the museum was missing. Two youths were seen in the area just before the fire broke out, who are believed to be connected to the start of the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-DwpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jWUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2466,3480492&amp;dq=san+diego+1977+fire+space+museum&amp;hl=en |title=Fire Destroys San Diego Aero-Space Museum |work=[[Lewiston Evening Journal]] |location=San Diego, California|publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=February 23, 1978 |accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 24, 1978 |pages=Part 1, 3 &amp; 22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiego.gov/fire/about/majorfires/1978balboa.shtml |title=1978 - Balboa Park Fires/ Aerospace Museum Fire |publisher=[[San Diego, California|City of San Diego, California]], [[San Diego Fire and Rescue Department]] |year=2011 |accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several one-of-a-kind aircraft were destroyed, including a reproduction of the [[Spirit of St. Louis]], built in 1967. The loss of all the valuable artifacts was estimated at $4 million. Space-related objects that were lost included [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and Apollo spacecraft and space-related memorabilia and mementos. The California Apollo 17 lunar samples plaque display burned, but the 1 gram basalt "moon rock" stone in the Lucite ball that was mounted on the plaque survived, along with the small California flag that was mounted to the display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.balboaparkhistory.net/casadebalboa.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |title=History of the Casa de Balboa Building in Balboa Park |first1=Richard |last1=Amero |accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damaged California Apollo 17 lunar samples plaque is now in storage at the [[San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum]].&lt;ref name = "Apollo 17 moon rock"/&gt;

According to moon rocks researcher [[Robert Pearlman]], the California Apollo 11 lunar samples display is also housed in the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.&lt;ref name = "moon rocks Apollo 11"/&gt;

'''Class (locomotive)''' refers to a group of locomotives built to a common design for a single railroad.  Often members of a particular class had detail variations between individual examples, and these could lead to subclasses.  Sometimes technical alterations (especially [[rebuilding]], superheating, re-engining, etc.) move a locomotive from one class to another. Different railways had different systems, and sometimes one railway (or its successors) used different systems at different times and for different purposes, or applied those classifications inconsistently. Sometimes therefore it is not clear where one class begins and another ends. The result is a classic example of the [[lumpers and splitters|Lumper splitter problem]].

==Development==
As locomotives became more numerous the need arose to deal with them in groups of similar engines rather than as named or numbered individuals. These groups were named "classes" and at first tended to reflect capability rather than design. For example, the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] grouped its roster into four classes before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], though they had by that point dozens of different designs.

Later classes were based on design. A group of locomotives built off the same blueprints constituted a class, and if some of the locomotives in the class were sufficiently modified, a new class might be established for the modified examples. When electric locomotives were introduced, the same scheme was applied to them.

Since steam and early electric locomotives were usually custom built, classes were assigned by the railroad, and each railroad had its own system. Mergers of lines and sales of locomotives brought about changes of class. Early diesels were often fitted into the locomotive class system, but since they were generally not custom built the use of manufacturer model designations overtook the class system and made it irrelevant, except for historical discussion.

==Class system organization==
Usually the class system for a railroad was built on a simply hierarchy which assigned each class a code.

==First level: Wheel arrangement==
The first level was usually for the [[wheel arrangement]] and was usually coded by a letter of the alphabet. Different railroads used different codes, so that "J" on the [[New York Central Railroad]] meant a [[4-6-4]] (Hudson), while on the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] it mean a [[4-8-4]] (Northern), and on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] it denoted a [[4-4-0]] with a [[Wootten firebox]].

[[Articulated locomotives]] were handled through two different methods. On many railroads each wheel arrangement was assigned its own unique letter, due to the limited number of arrangements that had to be represented. On other railroads this was insufficient, and commonly articulated locomotives were represented with a two letter code, one letter for the arrangement of each half. Therefore, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad GG1]] ([[International Union of Railways|UIC]] 2Co+Co2) is represented as if it were two ten-wheelers ([[4-6-0]]) coupled tail-to-tail.

==Second level: Sequential model==
A sequence number was often added to distinguish different designs of the same wheel arrangement. As a rule the first design for a given arrangement had no sequence number, so that numbering stated at 1 with the second design for the wheel arrangement. For example, there were two main classes of [[2-10-2]] locomotives on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&amp;O]], labelled "S" and "S-1".

==Third level: Variants==
Letter suffixes were often used to indicate variants in a basic design. Sometimes these also referred to specific characteristics; for example, for many years the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] used a "s" suffix to indicate [[superheater|superheating]], while on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B&amp;O]] a "t" suffix indicated an engine with an oversize [[Tender locomotive|tender]].

==Sub-Classes==
Sub-classes are groups of locomotives that many have different mechanical characteristics between the sub-class of locomotives and the original design of those locomotives.
For example: when [[New South Wales C30 class|NSWGR C30 class]] suburban tank engines where displaced because of the electrification of Sydney suburban railways, many were converted to tender engines adding the prefix of “t” to C30. Some were even converted to superheighted engines, adding another prefix of “s” to either C30 or C30T to become C30S or C30TS.

==Class names==
Most locomotives were given simple codes, but some classes were named, formally or not.
*The [[Union Pacific Big Boy]] class was said to have been given that name when it was scrawled on the smokebox of one at the factory.
*The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] P-7 class was referred to as the "President" class because initially each locomotive had the name of a [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] on the cab.
*Also on the B&amp;O, the S and S-1 classes were referred to as "Big Sixes" because the road numbers began with 6.

==British practice==
* For recent practice see: [[British Rail locomotive and multiple unit numbering and classification]]

The old railway companies had various systems of classification. Taking the "Big Four" companies which operated from 1923 to 1947:

===Great Western Railway===
The class number was usually taken from the first member of each class, e.g. "5700 Class" or "57XX Class" for locomotives in the number series beginning 5700.
* See: [[GWR locomotive numbering and classification]]

==Southern Railway==
Each class was given a letter or number but these were not very meaningful. For example, "700" Class locomotives were [[0-6-0]]s, but so were "Q" Class engines. See:
* [[SR locomotive numbering and classification]]
* [[SR multiple unit numbering and classification]]

==London, Midland and Scottish Railway==
Each locomotive was given a [[power classification]], e.g. "3F".  However, many different classes would have the same power classification so this was not helpful for identifying classes.
* See: [[LMS locomotive numbering and classification]]

==London and North Eastern Railway==
The LNER's classification system was the most helpful to railway enthusiasts. Each [[Whyte notation|wheel arrangement]] was given a letter (e.g. A for 4-6-2, B for 4-6-0, etc.) and this was followed by a number denoting the class (e.g. A1, B1, etc.).
* See: [[LNER locomotive numbering and classification]]

In [[politics]], '''dual loyalty''' is loyalty to two separate interests that potentially conflict with each other.

==Inherently controversial==
While nearly all examples of alleged "dual loyalty" are considered highly controversial, these examples point to the inherent difficulty in distinguishing between what constitutes a "danger" of dual loyalty – i.e., that there exists a pair of ''misaligned'' interests – versus what might be more simply a pair of ''partially aligned'' or even, according to the party being accused, a pair of ''fully aligned'' interests. For example, immigrants who still have feelings of loyalty to their country of origin will often insist that their two (or more) loyalties do not conflict. As Stanley A. Renshon at the Center for Immigration Studies notes,
{{quote|Lan Samantha Chang (1999), a novelist writing in response to the Wen Ho Lee case, could say in a ''New York Times'' op-ed piece entitled ''Debunking the Dual Loyalty Myth'', "True, many immigrants have strong ties to their countries of birth.&amp;nbsp;... But cultural or familial loyalties are on a different level from political allegiances&amp;nbsp;... I love China, but I am a citizen of the United States." Ms. Chang appears to want to distinguish a love for one's "home" country from being willing to commit treason against one's adopted one. This is obviously a fair, reasonable, and appropriate distinction.

Yet, in the process of making such a distinction, she acknowledges the duality of her feelings. The issue is not between love of one's country of origin and treason, but rather the multiple loyalties that appear to be part of many immigrants' psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Renshon|Stanley A. Renshon]]. "[http://www.cis.org/articles/2001/paper20/renshon1812.html Dual Citizenship and Conflict: The War of 1812 Redux?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060417080312/http://www.cis.org/articles/2001/paper20/renshon1812.html |date=April 17, 2006}}" Center for Immigration Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Transnationalist interpretations===
Some scholars refer to a growing trend of [[transnationalism]] and suggest that as societies become more [[heterogeneous]] and [[multi-cultural]], the term "dual loyalty" increasingly becomes a meaningless [[Bromide (language)|bromide]]. According to the theory of transnationalism, migration (as well as other factors including improved global communication) produces new forms of identity that transcend traditional notions of physical and cultural space. Nina Glick Schiller, Linda Basch, and Cristina Blanc-Szanton define a process by which immigrants "link together" their country of origin and their country of settlement.

The transnationalist view is that "dual loyalty" is a potentially ''positive'' expression of multi-culturalism, and can contribute to the diversity and strength of civil society. While this view is popular in many academic circles, others are skeptical of this idea. As one paper describes it,
{{quote|On occasion, these imagined communities conform to the root meaning of transnational, extending beyond loyalties that connect to any specific place of origin or ethnic or national group. Yet what immigration scholars describe as transnationalism is usually its opposite ... highly particularistic attachments antithetical to those by-products of globalization denoted by the concept of "transnational civil society" and its related manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Waldinger |first=Roger |last2=Fitzgerald |first2=David |date=March 2004 |title=Transnationalism in Question |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/soc/faculty/waldinger/pdf/B7.pdf |journal=American Journal of Sociology |volume=109 |issue=5 |page=1178 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Beyond its usage in particular instances, the term "dual loyalty" versus "transnationalism" continues to be the subject of much debate. As one academic writes:
{{quote|Although the events of September 11th may have shaken some assumptions – at least in the United States – about the nature of transnational networks and their capacity to facilitate flows of people, goods, and ideas across borders, the terms "globalization" and "transnationalism" remain relatively stable, albeit frustratingly imprecise additions to the language of social sciences, including anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Wagner |first=Sarah |year=2002 |title=Putting a Face on Transnationalism: Migration, Identity, and Membership in the Transnational City of Johannesburg |page=2 |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~sewagner/johannesburg.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408221056/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~sewagner/johannesburg.pdf |archivedate=April 8, 2005 |postscript=. |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Historical accusations==
Other historical examples of actual or perceived "dual loyalty" include the following:
* During [[World War II]], a number of [[United States]] citizens of [[Japanese Americans|Japanese]], [[German Americans|German]], and [[Italian Americans|Italian]] [[ancestry]], including some born in the U.S., were confined to [[internment]] camps (see [[Japanese internment in the United States]]).
* [[Roman Catholic]]s are subject to the [[Pope]] on religious matters. This has often perceived as dual loyalty by powers opposed to the [[Holy See]].
** During the [[English Reformation]], many important English and Scottish figures, such as [[Thomas More]], [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] and [[Edmund Campion]], were tried and executed for their alleged double loyalty to the Papacy and infidelity to the Crown.
** During the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] in 19th-century France, citizens were routinely divided between ''clericals'' and ''anticlericals'' because of long-lasting loyalty related conflicts between the French secularist government and the Holy See.
** During [[John F. Kennedy]]'s campaign for and brief [[Timeline of the presidency of John F. Kennedy|tenure as U.S. President]], some opponents questioned whether a Roman Catholic President of the United States had a divided loyalty with respect to the [[Papacy]] and [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanpresident.org/history/johnfkennedy/biography/theamericanfranchise.common.shtml AmericanPresident.org article on John F. Kennedy]&lt;/ref&gt;
** The [[Roman Catholicism in China|Chinese Catholics]] have been forced by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] to substitute the Roman Catholic Church in China by the [[Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association]].
* [[Jewish people|Jews]] in the [[Jewish Diaspora]] have been accused of dual loyalty by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in the 1st century, by the [[French people|French]] in the [[Dreyfus Affair]] in the late 19th century, in [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin-era]] [[Soviet Union]] in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Zakim"&gt;[[Leonard P.

[[File:Fotografi av Conte Mattei - Hallwylska museet - 103008.tif|thumb|Count Cesare Mattei]]
'''Electrohomoeopathy''' (or '''Mattei cancer cure''') is a derivative of [[homeopathy]] invented in the 19th century by Count Cesare Mattei. The name is derived from a combination of ''electro'' (referring to an electric [[energy (esotericism)|bio-energy]] content supposedly extracted from plants and of therapeutic value, rather than [[electricity]] in its conventional sense) and ''homeopathy'' (referring to an alternative medicinal philosophy developed by [[Samuel Hahnemann]] in the 18th century). Electrohomeopathy has been defined as the combination of electrical devices and homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturowatch.org/hx/fishbein.html|title=Naturopathy and Its Professors (1932)|work=naturowatch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucrative for its inventor and popular in the late nineteenth century, electrohomoeopathy has been described as "utter idiocy". Like all homeopathy, it is regarded by the [[modern medicine|medical]] and [[scientific community|scientific communities]] as [[pseudoscience]] and its practice as [[quackery]].

==History and criticism==
Electrohomeopathy was devised by Cesare Mattei (1809–1896) in the latter part of the 19th century. Mattei, a nobleman living in a castle in the vicinity of [[Bologna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.italiaplease.it/eng/megazine/giroditalia/rocchetta|title=Arabian Nights in the Apennines|work=italiaplease.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied natural science, anatomy, physiology, pathology, chemistry and botany. He ultimately focused on the supposed therapeutic power of "electricity" in botanical extracts. Mattei made bold, unsupported claims for the efficacy of his treatments, including the claim that his treatments offered a nonsurgical alternative to [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciper.org/print/RR1-3-1-3.html|title=Science in the 19th Century Periodical|work=sciper.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; His treatment regimens were met with scepticism by mainstream medicine:&lt;blockquote&gt;The electrohomeopathic system is an invention of Count Mattei who prates of "red", "yellow" and "blue", "green" and "white" electricity, a theory that, in spite of its utter idiocy, has attracted a considerable following and earned a large fortune for its chief promoter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1692368|year=1906|last1=Kempf|first1=EJ|title=European Medicine: A Résumé of Medical Progress During the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|volume=3|issue=4|pages=231–48|journal=Journal of the Medical Library Association|pmid=18340885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Notwithstanding criticisms, including a challenge by the British medical establishment to the claimed success of his cancer treatments,&lt;ref&gt;GW Potter, "Matteism: An Exposure", ''[[British Medical Journal|British Med J]]'', 13 August 1892&lt;/ref&gt; electrohomeopathy (or Matteism, as it was sometimes known at the time) had adherents in Germany, France, the USA and the UK by the beginning of the 20th century; electrohomeopathy had been the subject of approximately 100 publications and there were three journals dedicated to it.&lt;ref name=baylen&gt;{{cite journal
|first=J. O
|last=Baylen
|title=The Mattei cancer cure: a Victorian nostrum
|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society
|year=1969
|volume=7
|issue=169
|page=397
|jstor=1624730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Remedies are derived from what are said to be the active micro nutrients or mineral salts of certain plants. One contemporary account of the process of producing electrohomeopathic remedies was as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;As to the nature of his remedies we learn ... that ... they are manufactured from certain herbs, and that the directions for the preparation of the necessary dilutions are given in the ordinary jargon of homeopathy. The globules and liquids, however, are "instinct with a potent, vital, electrical force, which enables them to work wonders". This process of "fixing the electrical principle" is carried on in the secret central chamber of a Neo-[[Moorish]] castle which Count Mattei has built for himself in the Bolognese [[Apennines]] ... The "red electricity" and "white electricity" supposed to be "fixed" in these "vegetable compounds" are in their very nomenclature and suggestion poor and miserable fictions.&lt;ref&gt;The Mattei Fable, ''British Med J'' Jan 17, 1891&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Mattei's own ideas however, every disease originates in the change of [[blood]] or of the [[lymphatic system]] or both, and remedies can therefore be mainly divided into two broad categories to be used in response to the dominant affected system. Mattei wrote that having obtained plant extracts, he was "able to determine in the liquid vegetable electricity". Allied to his theories and therapies were elements of Chinese medicine, of medical [[humours]], of apparent Brownianism, as well as modified versions of [[Samuel Hahnemann]]'s homeopathic principles.&lt;ref&gt;Alberto Lodispoto, 'L'Electromiopathie du Comte Cesare Mattei', ''Zeitschrift für Klassische Homöopathie'' (English abstract) 1971; 15: 130-135&lt;/ref&gt; Electrohomeopathy has some associations with [[Spagyric medicine]], a [[holistic]] medical philosophy claimed to be the practical application of alchemy in medical treatment, so that the principle of modern electrohomeopathy is that disease is typically multi-organic in cause or effect and therefore requires holistic treatment that is at once both complex and natural.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Modern usage==
A symposium took place in Bologna in 2008 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Cesare Mattei,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesaremattei.com cesaremattei.com]&lt;/ref&gt; with attendees from [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Germany]], UK, and the USA.

[[File:EscolArtOlot.JPG|thumb|left|265px|School's building]]
'''Escola d'Art i Superior de Disseny d'Olot''' is the main Design and Arts &amp; Crafts school of the region of [[Province of Girona|Girona]] ([[Catalonia]], Spain). Since its foundation, it has maintained an active participation in the social, educational, economic and cultural life. The school is in [[Olot]], a city with a population of over 34,000 inhabitants.

==History==
The School was founded as '''Fine Arts School''' on 1 July 1783 by Bishop Tomas Lorenzana. In 1891 was renamed as '''Minor Fine Arts' School''', and during the period 1934–1938 was designed as '''Landscape's School''', depending on the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]].

During the 1986–87 academic year the official teaching of applied arts and crafts began, according to the official plan for 1963 schools; the school at this time depended on Olot's City Council.

On 20 June 1990 the school became part of the Catalonia official network of art schools with the name of '''Escola d'Arts Applicades i Oficis Artístics d'Olot'''; human resources and management switched to the Generalitat de Catalunya.

Since the 2003–2004 academic year the school has become '''Escola d'Art i Superior de Disseny d'Olot''', by completing the training with a Bachelor in Interior Design. Since the 2007–08 academic year the school also teaches a Bachelor of Graphic Design. Since 2010–11 it became one of seven ESDAP (Escola Superior de Disseny i Arts Plàstiques) and began to teach undergraduate Design (adapted to the [[European Higher Education Area]]).

==Location==

The institution is at the "Claustres del Carme" building, the Carmelite Cloisters, which date back to the Renaissance.

'''FOSS Movement in India''' refers to the campaign across the country during the 1990s and 2000s in particular, to promote Free and Open Source Software. It was marked by the existence of many [[Indian Linux User Groups]] (ILUGs) groups and [[Free Software User Groups]] (FSUGs) in different cities, town and other areas.

The prominent members of the campaign include the late [[Atul Chitnis]], Prof [[Nagarjuna G.]] and others.

==Timeline of the campaign==
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Date !! Event
|-
| 1990s || Computer magazines like [[PC-Quest]] boost interest in [[FOSS]] (or [[Linux]]) by regularly writing articles, and sharing software on CDs and DVDs from this field. Among the early writers are the late [[Atul Chitnis]]. 
|-
| 1993-94 || The [[not-for-profit]]/[[NGO]] [[Centre for Education and Documentation]], based at Bombay (now Mumbai) and Bangalore (now Bengaluru) promotes the use of [[FOSS]] (or [[Linux]], as it was then widely called) among the non-profit and alternate journalist community, through installing it on their computers, in its rather early shape. CED also used some [[FOSS]] tools while granting early access to non-profits to their email systems at ILBOM and ILBAN (IndiaLink) service. 
|-
| 1997 || '''[[Linux India]]''', a loose network of mailing lists is founded around this time by Arun Sharma and [[Karra Dakshinamurthy]] to help propagate and learn the [[GNU/Linux]] operating system and associated tools. In the early days, the electronic mailing lists were under the adminship of [[Sudhakar Chandrasekharan]] ''aka'' [[Thaths]].
|-
| 2013 || '''October:''' Free Software Foundation (India) responds to the proposed Government of India framework. Urges government to recognise citizens as primary stakeholders; seeks replacement of "OSS" with "FLOSS"; and other concerns over the total cost of ownership, bidding to create FLOSS solutions, licenses, recommended stacks, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSF India's Response to the Proposed Framework by Govt of India|url=http://fsf.org.in/fsf-indias-response-to-the-proposed-framework-by|website=fsf.org.in|publisher=Free Software Foundation (India)|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3135">[[Image:Flux Transfer Event.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's impression of a flux transfer event.]]A '''flux transfer event (FTE)''' occurs when a magnetic portal opens in the [[Earth]]'s [[magnetosphere]] through which high-energy particles flow from the [[Sun]]. This connection, while previously thought to be permanent, has been found to be brief and very dynamic. The [[European Space Agency]]'s four [[Cluster mission|Cluster spacecraft]] and [[NASA]]'s five [[THEMIS]] probes have flown through and surrounded these FTEs, measuring their dimensions and identifying the particles that are transferred between the magnetic fields.

==Formation==
Earth's magnetosphere and the [[Sun#Magnetic field|Sun's magnetic field]] are constantly pressed against one another on the [[Daytime (astronomy)|dayside]] of Earth. Approximately every eight minutes, these fields briefly merge, forming a temporary "portal" between the Earth and the Sun through which high-energy particles such as [[solar wind]] can flow. The portal takes the shape of a magnetic cylinder about the width of Earth. Current observations place the portal at up to 4 times the size of Earth.

==Simulations==
Since Cluster and THEMIS have directly sampled FTEs, scientists can [[simulation|simulate]] FTEs on computers to predict how they might behave. Jimmy Raeder of the [[University of New Hampshire]] told his colleagues simulations show that the cylindrical portals tend to form above Earth's [[equator]] and then roll over Earth's winter pole. In December, FTEs roll over the [[north pole]]; in July they roll over the [[south pole]].

== Flux transfer events beyond Earth ==

Magnetic fields similar to Earth's are common throughout known space and many undergo similar flux transfer events.  During its second flyby of the planet on October 6, 2008, the NASA probe [[MESSENGER]] discovered that [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]’s magnetic field shows a magnetic reconnection rate ten times higher than Earth's. Mercury's proximity to the Sun only accounts for about a third of the reconnection rate observed by MESSENGER and the cause of this discrepancy is not currently known.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/multimedia/magnetic_tornadoes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, it has been found that the same phenomenon, also known as a 'magnetic rope', can be observed at [[Saturn]]. The findings prove that at times Saturn "behaves and interacts with the Sun in much the same way as Earth". &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-physical-sciences/maps-news-publication/saturn-sun-magnetic-rope&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GeoModeller''' (old names include 3DWEG, Geomodeller3D) is a methodology and associated software tool for 3D [[geologic modelling]] developed by [[BRGM]] and [[Intrepid Geophysics]] over the last 20 years. The software is written using [[Open CASCADE]] in [[C++]] for the engine (geometry, topology, viewers, data management, ...), [[Java (programming language)|Java]] for the [[GUI]] and data are stored in extensible mark-up language [[XML]]. GeoModeller has started to revolutionise the working practices, data standards and products of a [[geological survey]] as a whole. The software takes into account all [[structural geology]] data such as dip, dip directions, strike, hingelines and axialtrace to build the geometry of geological units.

== A brief outline of the methodology ==
GeoModeller utilizes a Digital Terrain Model, surface geological linework, cross-sections, geophysical interpretation and drillhole [[borehole]] data to enable the geologist to construct cross sections, or 3D models. 3D [[Geostatistics|Geostatistical]] interpolation (co-kriging) using all the data (location of interface, dip, direction, ...) produces a 3D [[implicit function]] representing a solid model. The model build may take in account if necessary a network of [[geologic faults]]. The model could be represented by [[triangulated]] objects each corresponding to one of the geological units present. Geologists can draw the model in their sections to obtain a fence diagram. The geologist can use their knowledge to add information in the 3D space until he obtain a 'right' model.

== Inversion of the 3D model ==
In geological and mining or oil exploration applications, [[Seismic wave|seismic]] profiles as well as [[Gravitation|gravity]] and [[Magnetism|magnetic]] data are often available. Interpreted seismic cross-sections directly provide data that can be processed directly as geometric constraints for 3D modelling. On the other hand, gravity and magnetic data provide indirect constraints. Presently, a 3D geological model is considered as the initial state of a constrained [[Inverse problem|inverse]] modelling of this data. That inversion is based on an iterative method, which is applied to a discrete version of the domain under study. This inversion formulation allows separate inversion of either gravity or magnetic data or simultaneous inversion of both datasets and [[tensor]] components of [[gravity]] and [[magnetic field]] . The final result is a probabilistic 3D geological model.

'''Georges Philippe Friedmann''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁidman|lang}}; 13 May 1902 – 15 November 1977), was a French sociologist and philosopher, known for his influential work on the effects of industrial labor on individuals and his criticisms of the uncontrolled embrace of technological change in twentieth-century Europe and the United States.

== Biography ==
Friedmann was the last child of Adolphe Friedmann (1857-1922), a Berlin merchant, and Elizabeth Nathan (1871-1940). He was born in Paris, where his parents moved after their marriage in Berlin in 1882. They acquired French nationality in 1903.

After a brief period studying industrial chemistry, Friedmann prepared for the philosophy ''[[agrégation]]'' at the prestigious [[Lycée Henri-IV|Lycée Henri IV]] in Paris. He studied philosophy at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] from 1923-1926. He served as an assistant to the sociologist [[Célestin Bouglé]] at the Centre de documentation sociale, a social science research center at the ENS funded by the banker [[Albert Kahn (banker)|Albert Kahn]] and, later, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].

Upon the death of his father in 1929, Friedmann inherited a fortune of 2.6 million francs, which enabled him to finance several of his young classmates' intellectual journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lallement|first=Michel|date=2014|title=Georges Friedmann au Cnam (1946-1959)|url=http://technique-societe.cnam.fr/medias/fichier/chc1-2014-1_1422283474502-pdf?pk_campaign=chc|journal=Cahiers du CNAM|volume=1|pages=43–74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friedmann eventually donated a large part of the fortune to the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Fondation Curie]] for cancer research. After his death, Degas paintings Friedmann had inherited from his father's collection were donated to the [[Louvre]].

Friedmann married his first wife, Hania Olszweska, a Polish Catholic, in 1937. The couple had one daughter, Liliane, born in 1941 in Toulouse. After Hania's death in 1957, Friedmann married Marcelle Rémond in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reynaud|first=Jean-Daniel|date=1994|title=FRIEDMANN, Georges (1902-1977). Professeur d'Histoire du travail (1946-1959)|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/inrp_0298-5632_1994_ant_19_1_8449|journal=Bibliothèque Historique de l'Éducation|volume=19|pages=544–549|via=Persée}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking his family to Toulouse, Friedmann joined the [[French Resistance]] during [[World War II]], when he was hunted by the Nazi [[Gestapo]] due to his Jewish heritage. He later wrote that he escaped the [[Gestapo]] in 1943, and was hidden in a school in [[Dordogne]] by a pair of young schoolteachers.&lt;sup&gt;[[Georges Friedmann#cite note-2|[2]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Friedmann's journals from the war, published posthumously in 1987, recounted his experiences as a member of the resistance.

He received his ''Doctorat d'état'' in 1946, with his major thesis on mechanization in industrial production and minor thesis on Leibniz and Spinoza, both published as monographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/en/about-isa/history-of-isa/isa-past-presidents/list-of-presidents/georges-friedmann/|title=Georges Friedmann|last=|first=|date=|website=International Sociological Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scholarly work ==
At the ENS, Friedmann was close to the Philosophies group that opposed the influence of [[Henri Bergson]] and was influential in bringing Marx’s earlier philosophical texts to France, and included [[Georges Politzer]], [[Norbert Guterman]]n, [[Paul Nizan]], and [[Henri Lefebvre]]. The group's initial journal, ''Esprit,'' and its successor, ''Philosophies'', were funded by Friedmann's personal wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=French Marxism Between the Wars: Henri Lefebvre and the Philosophies|last=Burkhard|first=Bud|publisher=Humanity Books|year=2000|isbn=|location=Amherst, NY|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, Friedmann made several trips to the [[Soviet Union]], where observed the Soviet industry and technology. His 1938 book, ''De la Sainte Russie à l’U.R.S.S.'' established him as an authority on Soviet society in France. But even his moderate criticisms of the U.S.S.R. and [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] caused bitter conflict with members of the [[French Communist Party]] and began Friedmann’s move away from political activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gouarné|first=Isabelle|title=Engagement philosoviétique et posture sociologique dans l'entre-deux-guerres : le rôle politico-intellectuel de Georges Friedmann|journal=Sociologie du Travail|volume=54|issue=3|pages=356–374|doi=10.1016/j.soctra.2012.06.002|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedmann’s doctoral thesis, published after the end of the war in 1946, examined the "human problems" of automation and mechanization European industrial production. A critical, historical overview of paradigms of industrial management, particularly [[scientific management]], [[Industrial and organizational psychology|industrial psychology]], and [[Human relations movement|human relations]], ''Problèmes humains du machinisme industriel'' examined social scientists’ efforts to "humanize" industrial labor that had been fragmented and [[Deskilling|de-skilled]] by industrialization and Taylorism. Friedmann argued that while these efforts were an improvement on the "technicist ideology" of management engineering, social science would not lead to significant changes in labor practices without class conflict and the transformation of the capitalist economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Problèmes humains du machinisme industriel|last=Friedmann|first=Georges|publisher=Gallimard|year=1946|isbn=978-2070225897|location=Paris|pages=381–388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedmann’s book is considered a founding text of French ''sociologie du travail'', and his seminar influenced a number of younger sociologists, historians, and philosophers, including [[Edgar Morin]] and [[Alain Touraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Servants of post-industrial power? : sociologie du travail in Modern France|last=1937-|first=Rose, Michael,|date=1979|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=9780333236499}}&lt;/ref&gt; While holding various professorships and serving as the head of the French [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS), Friedmann continued to travel extensively around the world, observing and publishing on labor practices and industrial models in the United States, Israel, and South America. His analysis of the nature of the Jewish people and Israeli society in ''The End of the Jewish People''?, one of his few works to be translated into English, attracted media attention in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9905E7D7113AE63ABC4152DFB166838C679EDE&amp;legacy=true|title=Victory, or Defeat?|last=Lask|first=Thomas|date=July 19, 1967|work=The New York Times|access-date=June 6, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedmann gradually shifted from emphasis on labor to a broader concern with "technical civilization." His final book, ''La Puissance et la Sagesse'', a mixture of autobiography and reflection on contemporary society, modified his earlier Marxism and emphasized the importance of interiority and morality on humanizing postwar consumer society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.openedition.org/editionscnrs/1669|title=Georges Friedmann : Un sociologue dans le siècle, 1902-1977|last=Segrestin|first=Denis|publisher=CNRS Editions|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Grémion|editor-first=Pierre|location=Paris|pages=141–152|chapter=«La Puissance et la Sagesse» : Georges Friedmann face à la civilisation technicienne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gobar Times''''' is a monthly environmental education magazine for the young adult, published by the [[Centre for Science and Environment]]. It is published along with ''[[Down to Earth (magazine)|Down to Earth]]'' as a supplement. The magazine was first published in May, 1998 and has widespread circulation across India and abroad. The icon of the magazine, Pandit Gobar Ganesh, the pondering panditji is an Indian elderly who takes the reader through current issues, subjects and ideas relating to the environment. He is the icon whose brains can be picked for anything on earth. The current editor of the magazine is Sumita Dasgupta.

"[[Gobar]]" is the [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and  [[Nepali language|Nepali]] word for "cow dung". It was chosen to capture the eco-philosophy and tradition of generating wealth from waste. Waste gobar serves as an [[insecticide]] and is used to plaster mud houses and is a waterproof coating for walls. It is also used to plaster floors to keep them cool. Gobar is the energy source for rural India. It is used as cooking fuel where people have no access to fuels like [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]]. The greatest use of cow dung in India is in farming where it is used as natural manure for farmers' crops. In short, it's a mainstay of rural India, and an appropriate symbol for eco-friendly technology.

[[Anil Agarwal (environmentalist)|Anil Agarwal]] the founder-director of Centre for Science and Environment, India’s leading environmental NGO, aptly called ‘Gobar’ the symbol that embodies the spirit of the Indian environmental movement. As he correctly reflected, the widespread and diverse use of gobar in Indian society stands up to every principle of good environmentalism.

== History ==
In May 1992, the Society for Environmental Communications started India’s only science and environment fortnightly, ''Down To Earth'' (DTE). Over the years the magazine has informed and inspired people about environmental threats facing India and the world - a dimension underplayed in mainstream media. In May, 1998, ''Gobar Times'' was first published as a supplement to ''DTE''. ''Gobar Times'' reaches out to the young, encouraging them to take the lead and make a difference. It informs them and encourages them to save the environment by becoming an action-oriented, knowledgeable and aware community. The tone of the magazine is light-hearted, simple and thought-provoking. Every month the magazine comes up with an activity related center spread which can be pulled out and put up as a poster to encourage readers to become active participants. The magazine has recently entered into a partnership with the leading newspaper ''[[Hindustan Times]]''. Readers can now get a glimpse of what Pandit Gobar Ganesh has to say as they read HTNext.

== Green Schools Program ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:GSP-logo.gif|thumb|left|GSP logo]] --&gt;Conceptualized by the [[New Delhi]]–based Centre for Science and Environment(CSE), The ''Gobar Times'' Green Schools Program allows self-assessment of the environmental practices of a school by its students, using the "Green Schools Manual". This inspection or survey of environmental practices at schools&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gdsalwan.com/Environment.html G D Salwan Public School, Green Schools Program]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kfirural.org/Green_sch.html The Rural centre]&lt;/ref&gt; is a way for them to audit their immediate environment across the key areas of water, air, land, energy and waste.

*'''Water''': To make the school water literate and teach ways of [[rainwater harvesting]] and recycling of waste water.
*'''Air''': Students check out the transport system of the school and understand how people commute to school. This further enables them to understand how transport policies affect air quality and how they can innovate and find ways of reducing [[Air pollution|emissions]].
*'''Land''': The different plant and animal species on the school campus are identified by the students and a survey done on the use of [[pesticides]] in the school. Understanding the concept of carrying capacity.
*'''Energy''': The students study electricity and other forms of energy consumption on the school campus and explore ways in which it can be minimized.
*'''Waste''': Students find out how much and what type of waste the school is producing? Learn [[composting]] and waste segregation methods in the process.

By the end of it all the program gives the students an opportunity to give a report card to the school on its environmental performance and practices. They conduct the audit with the help of an interesting handbook called the 'Green Schools Program Manual' (2007 Edition). This manual gives them step by step guidelines on how to conduct an environmental audit in the school.

The purpose of the Green Schools Program is to encourage and support schools to build up an environmentally aware, active and skilled community&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2007/01/09/stories/2007010902810800.htm Opinion, Director - NCERT]&lt;/ref&gt; of teachers, students and parents. The schools may use the manual as part of their environmental studies program or to conduct activities in eco-clubs. The data collected by students is compiled and rated such that it becomes a self-assessment tool of environmental practices followed by the school. The aim of the rating is, to understand what can be done to improve the schools performance on its environmental sustainability index and to implement changes over the coming years.

=== Awards ===
The ''Gobar Times'' Green Schools Awards is a platform to acknowledge and reward  schools which have adopted the most innovative and effective practices to manage [[natural resources]] within their own premises. Schools send in their green reports to CSE. These reports undergo rigorous verification and selection and the best schools are awarded annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.outlookindia.com/item.aspx?650467 Outlook Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/news/delhi-schools-awarded-for-green-initiatives/582368/ Indian Express - Green Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2010/02/21/stories/2010022158190300.htm The Hindu - Elite 'Delhi' schools fail 'green test']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Award GSP.jpg|thumb|left|Award ceremony for Green Schools Program]]

The top 10 schools of the country which have been working and have implemented tremendous improvement in their environmental practices are awarded the 'Change Makers' award. Schools participating for the first time are considered in the 'New Schools' category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stpauls-delhi.com/parents%20corner.html St Pauls, Delhi]&lt;/ref&gt; They are judged basis involvement of students and teachers, and the quality of the reports submitted. Also schools which do not necessarily audit all areas but do exceptionally well in a single specific area of water, energy, land, air or waste apply for the coveted 'Best Managers' award.

=== Partners ===
The [[National Green Corps]]&lt;ref&gt;[[National Green Corps#External links|National Green Corps]]&lt;/ref&gt; is a program of the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forest]], Government of India). State nodal offices and CSE partner in many states across India. As the Green Schools network is expanding, the awards are now also organized at the state level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pscst.com/en/about/CSE%20green%20school%20award.htm Punjab State, Green Schools Program]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikenvis.nic.in/archives.htm Sikkim, Green Schools Training]&lt;/ref&gt; The highest rank holders at the state level in different categories are nominated by state nodal agencies to compete for national awards with CSE in Delhi.

==History==

===Early years===
IBT was founded in 1953 by Dr. Joseph C. Calandra, an [[Italian American]] professor of [[pathology]] and [[biochemistry]] at [[Northwestern University]].&lt;ref name='Gribbin 1960'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gribbin | first1 = John H. | last2 = Krogfus | first2 = Sue Singer | editor1-first=Dina E. | editor1-last=Van Bavel | editor2-first=Walter M. | editor2-last=Whitlow | editor3-first=Lee | editor3-last=Michelson | editor4-first=Frank M. |display-editors = 3 | editor4-last=Holz | title = Industrial research laboratories of the United States | volume = Publication 844 | edition = 11 | publisher = National Academy of Sciences—National Research Council | year = 1960 | location = Washington, D.C. | pages = 256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Kapos 2002-03-12'&gt;{{cite news | first = Shia | last = Kapos | title = Dr. Joseph C.

Described by his colleagues as a "man of high scientific standards who also knew how to make a dollar", Calandra was an effective entrepreneur; his laboratory was contracted by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to evaluate [[Food irradiation|irradiationally]] [[food preservation|preserved food]] within its first year of operation.&lt;ref name='Schneider 1983-05-11 (a)'&gt;{{cite news | first = Keith | last = Schneider | title = The rise and fall of IBT | date = 1983-05-11 | url = http://www.unz.org/Pub/InTheseTimes-1983may11-00003 | work = In These Times | pages = 3 | accessdate = 2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='SP 1986'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Whose Studies Should You Believe? | journal = Science for the People | date = March–April 1986 | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 15 | url = http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~schwrtz/SftP/MagazineArchive/SftPv18n2s.pdf | accessdate = 2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1960, IBT reported that its professional staff included 12 biologists, five chemists, a mathematician, four physicians and a veterinarian, and that it employed 16 technicians. Calandra was president and director and John H. Kay was the associate director. At that time, it listed its research areas as "industrial toxicology, food, drugs, cosmetics, pharmacology, radioisotopes, medical, dental, and veterinary products".&lt;ref name='Gribbin 1960'/&gt;

By the early 1960s, IBT had attained a significant reputation for producing quality work at a reasonable price.&lt;ref name="AJ Spring 1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Broad 1983-05-22'&gt;{{cite news | first = William J. | last = Broad | title = Who Tests the Product-Testing Labs? | date = 1983-05-22 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/weekinreview/who-tests-the-product-testing-labs.html | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
As of mid-decade, it had annual revenue estimated at nearly $2 million US.&lt;ref name="AJ Spring 1983"/&gt;

===1966–1970: Nalco acquisition, expansion===
[[Nalco Holding Company|Nalco Chemical]] acquired IBT in 1966 for an estimated $4.5 million.&lt;ref name="AJ Spring 1983"/&gt; Utilizing the company's new financial prowess, Calandra oversaw considerable expansion of the company and constructed two new facilities.&lt;ref name="AJ Spring 1983"/&gt; IBT began conducting tests on [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)]] in 1969.&lt;ref name='Steyer 1991-10-29'&gt;{{cite news | first = Robert | last = Steyer | title = Lab Falsified Monsanto PCB Data, Witness Says | date = 1991-10-29 | work = St. Louis Post-Dispatch }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Calandra began construction of a large $2 million laboratory and made two executive appointments: Dr. Moreno Keplinger as Manager of Toxicology and James Plank as Group Lead of Rat Toxicology.&lt;ref name="AJ Spring 1983"/&gt;

===1971–1976: Eminence===
In March 1971, IBT hired Dr. Paul L. Wright, one of [[Monsanto]]'s [[toxicologist]]s, to oversee its PCB testing.&lt;ref name='Steyer 1991-10-29' /&gt;&lt;ref name='Kimery 07-1987'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Weed Killer | journal = The Progressive | date = July 1987 | first = Kimery | last = Anthony L. | pages = 20–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Donovan E. Gordon joined IBT as a [[pathologist]] in August 1971, and IBT finalized its safety analysis of PCBs in November 1971.&lt;ref name='Steyer 1991-10-29' /&gt;

Irregularities in IBT's data were discovered in April 1976 by Adrian Gross, an investigator at the [[Food and Drug Administration]], whose aide retrieved one of the laboratory's [[naproxen]] studies that had been conducted for [[Syntex]], a pharmaceutical company recently outed by a [[whistleblower]].&lt;ref name='Marshall 1983-06-10'/&gt;&lt;ref name='NYT 1983-05-16'&gt;Laboratory Accused of Fudging [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/28/weekinreview/ideas-trends-in-summary-laboratory-official-accused-of-fudging.html?scp=216&amp;sq=Deodorant&amp;st=nyt NY Times]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Merrell 1981'&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Industrial Bio-Test Caper | journal = NCAP News | date = Winter 1981 | first = Paul | last = Merrell | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 2–4 | url = http://www.pesticide.org/get-the-facts/ncap-publications-and-reports/journal-of-pesticide-reform/jpr-vol.2-3-winter-1981.pdf | accessdate = 2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Poisoned Research'/&gt; Gross nonetheless continued to read IBT's study, which would ineluctably strike him as being unrealistic and pique his interest.&lt;ref name='Merrell 1981'/&gt; The FDA proceeded to probe IBT, and Gross personally inspected its facilities on April 11 and July 12, 1976.&lt;ref name="AJ Spring 1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name='CEN 1977-07-11'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Lab admits to defects in toxicity studies | journal = Chemical &amp; Engineering News | date = 1977-07-11 | volume = 55 | issue = 28 | pages = 7  | doi=10.1021/cen-v055n028.p007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='7th Cir. 1983-05-03'&gt;{{cite court | litigants = United States of America, Plaintiff-appellee, v.

===1977–1983: Investigation, indictment, notoriety===
Revelations of suspected scientific misconduct would go on to be presented in March 1977 at [[United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions|Senate Subcommittee on Health and Scientific Research]] hearings held by [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Ted Kennedy]] (D-MA), in which the integrity of safety data produced by IBT, as well as [[G.

IBT was criminally implicated in 1977 for producing fraudulent studies on widely used household and industrial products, including Nemacur, [[Sencor]], [[naproxen|Naprosyn]], and [[trichlorocarbanilide]].&lt;ref name="AJ Spring 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Faking It: The Case against Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories |journal=The Amicus Journal |date=Spring 1993 |first=Keith |last=Schneider |publisher=[[Natural Resources Defense Council]] |url=http://planetwaves.net/contents/faking_it.html |accessdate=2012-07-14 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69A19G61r?url=http://planetwaves.net/contents/faking_it.html |archivedate=2012-07-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='NYT 1983-05-15'&gt;{{cite news | title = Former Lab Worker Queried on Altered Data | date = 1983-05-15 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/15/us/former-lab-worker-queried-on-altered-data.html | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnitude of IBT's [[scientific misconduct]] was considered to have been extensive: 618 of 867 (71%) of studies audited by the FDA were invalidated for having "numerous discrepancies between the study conduct and data."&lt;ref name='JDC essay'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Schneider 1983-05-11 (b)'&gt;{{cite news | first = Keith | last = Schneider | title = IBT Labs' trial reveals faked data | date = 1983-05-11 | url = http://www.unz.org/Pub/InTheseTimes-1983may11-00003 | work = In These Times | pages = 3, 6 | accessdate = 2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, IBT would later be described as being "at the center of one of the most far-reaching scandals in modern science, as thousands of its studies were revealed through EPA and FDA investigations to be fraudulent or grossly inadequate."&lt;ref name='Coppolino 1994'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Pandora's poison | journal = Sierra | date = September–October 1994 | first = Eric Francis | last = Coppolino | authorlink = Eric Francis | editor-first=Paul | editor-last=Rauber | editor-link = Paul Rauber |author2=Hilary Lanner |author3=Brenda Shawley  | volume = 79 | issue = 5 | pages = 40 | url = http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/200103/conspiracy.asp | accessdate = 2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the criminal case against IBT and its employees was proceeding, information about which chemicals were "suspect" because of IBT's misconduct was kept confidential by the Canadian and American government agencies responsible to regulating them.&lt;ref name='von Stackelberg 1980-11'&gt;{{cite news | first = Peter| last = von Stackelberg| title = The Toxic Mist: The Use and Abuse of Pesticides | date = November 1980 | publisher = [[Regina Leader-Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=February 2013}}

In October 1983, three former officials of the company were convicted by a US federal jury of fabricating key product safety tests used to gain government approval for marketing two popular pesticides and two commonly used drugs.&lt;ref name='AJ Winter 1983'&gt;{{cite journal|title=IBT – Guilty |journal=Amicus Journal |date=Winter 1983 |first=Keith |last=Schneider |url=http://planetwaves.net/contents/ibt_guity.html |accessdate=2012-07-19 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69H25Lrgw?url=http://planetwaves.net/contents/ibt_guity.html |archivedate=2012-07-19 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were convicted after one of the longest criminal trials in US history, involving six months of testimony and nearly eleven days of jury deliberation.

==Federal trial==
Following the 1981 [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] indictment of several key IBT officials, a federal trial began on April 4, 1983 to evaluate whether IBT had in fact committed scientific fraud.&lt;ref name="Broad 1983-05-22"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Stankovic 2004-01-05'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Pulp Fiction: Reflections on Scientific Misconduct | journal = Wisconsin Law Review | date = 2004-01-05 | first = Bratislav | last = Stankovic | volume = 2004 | issue = 3 | pages = 1002–1010 | ssrn = 2051465 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='WMS 1983-05-27'&gt;{{cite news | title = Lab hid facts, ex-worker says | date = 1983-05-27 | publisher = [[Wilmington Morning Star]] | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JsgsAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2715,3051837 | work = Associated Press | accessdate = 2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='NYT 1983-07-12 (b)'&gt;{{cite news | title = Illinois Case Mistrial Declared | date = 1983-07-12 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/12/us/illinois-case-mistrial-declared.html | work = The New York Times | pages = A15 | accessdate = 2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testimony included that of an attorney retained by Nalco to defend IBT, Merrill Thompson, who refused to participate during earlier investigations of the laboratory. "As I got into it and worked on these things more, and found out more, and worked with IBT people more, and looked at the evidence of other practices in the industry, I decided I couldn't defend IBT's practices," Thompson testified.&lt;ref name='NYT 1983-09-25'&gt;{{cite news | title = Trial Ending for 3 over Lab Safety Research | date = 1983-09-25 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/25/us/trial-ending-for-3-over-lab-safety-research.html | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 2012-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testimony drew to a close on September 22.&lt;ref name='NYT 1983-09-25' /&gt;

The [[Law Commission of Canada|Law Reform Commission of Canada]] noted in a 1987 report that [[Agriculture in Canada|Canadian agriculture]]'s increasing dependence on pesticides had led to inaction against many of those approved on the basis of IBT's research data.&lt;ref name='HEF 1987-12-31'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Ottawa Accepts Invalid Pesticide Data, Law Commission Says | journal = HEF Canada Quarterly | publisher = Winnipeg Free Press, Human Ecology Foundation | date=1987-10-29 | publication-date = 1987-12-31 | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = 34–35 | url = http://ages.ca/sites/default/files/quarterlydec1987ocr.pdf | accessdate = 2012-07-19 | quote=Many pesticides registered as a result of invalid IBT data are still used in Canada, the study says, because the federal government refused to take them off the market until retesting could be done.

==Clientele==
According to various reports, IBT's clientele included a wide variety of companies such as [[3M]], [[American Cyanamid]], American Seed, Avitrol Corp, BFC, Black Leaf Chemical, [[Buckman (company)|Buckman]], [[Casoron]], Chemagro, [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], [[Novartis|Ciba‑Geigy]], Conrel, [[Valero Energy Corporation|Diamond Shamrock]], [[Dow Corning]], [[DuPont]], [[FMC Corporation|FMC]], Glyco, [[Gulf Oil|Gulf]], MGK, [[Mobay]], [[Mobil]], [[Monsanto]], [[Edison (company)|Montedison]], [[Nissan Motor Company|Nissan]], Noram, [[Olin Corporation|Olin]], Penwalt, [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], PPG, [[Sandoz]], [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]], Thompson-Hayward, [[United States Rubber Company|Uniroyal]], [[Upjohn]], [[Pacific Coast Borax Company|US Borax]], [[Genovique Specialties Corporation|Velsicol Chemical Company]], Vertac Chemical Corporation, and Zoecon, as well as the [[United States Army]], the Department of Defense, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, the [[National Cancer Institute]], and the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name='Richards 1977-09-08'&gt;{{cite news | first = Bill | last = Richards | title = Wide Errors, Possible Fraud Found in Private Lab Testing | date = 1977-09-08 | work = The Washington Post | pages = 1, A11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='OPTS July 1983'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=91014ULV.txt | title = Summary of the IBT Review Program | accessdate = 2012-07-17 | date = July 1983 | work = Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances | publisher = [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Jensen-PC 1997'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Jensen | first1 = Carl | author2= Project Censored| authorlink2 = Project Censored | title = 20 Years of Censored News | chapter = Fraudulent Safety Tests Deceive the American People | publisher = Seven Stories Press | year = 1997 | pages = 124 | isbn = 978-1888363524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated substances==

===Polychlorinated biphenyls===
[[Eric Francis]] and [[Marie-Monique Robin]] have cited IBT's research into the safety of [[polychlorinated biphenyl]], which was not investigated, as also being potentially fraudulent.&lt;ref name='Coppolino 1994'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Robin 2010'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Robin | first1 = Marie-Monique | title = The World According to Monsanto: Pollution, Corruption, and the Control of the World's Food Supply | chapter = PCBs: White-Collar Crime | publisher = The New Press | year = 2010 | pages = 22 | isbn = 978-1595584267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- temporary author divider --&gt;
Philip Smith later testified on October 28, 1991, during a court case against Monsanto, that he had observed PCB data falsification during his employment as an assistant toxicologist at IBT.&lt;ref name='Steyer 1991-10-29'/&gt;

''[[The Ecologist]]'' claimed in a 2007 article that IBT had provided [[expert witness|expert testimony]] against Douglas Gowan during a court case in which Monsanto allegedly sought to [[Defamation|discredit]] and [[Censorship|silence]] him over the wanton disposal of PCBs and other [[toxic waste]] at [[Brofiscin Quarry, Groes Faen]].&lt;ref name='Hughes 2007-10-11'&gt;{{cite news | first = Jon | last = Hughes |author2=Pat Thomas | title = Burying The Truth, the original Ecologist investigation into Monsanto and Brofiscin Quarry | date = 2007-10-11 | url = http://www.theecologist.org/The_Brofiscin_Monsanto_Files/777777/burying_the_truth.html | work = The Ecologist | accessdate = 2012-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
In April, 1980 the Regina Leader-Post obtained and published a Canadian government list of more than 97 chemicals tested by IBT for which studies were considered "suspect". In June, 1980 an additional nine chemicals were added.&lt;ref name="von Stackelberg 1980-11"/&gt;

The '''International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature''' ('''ICZN''') is an organization dedicated to "achieving stability and sense in the scientific naming of animals". Founded in 1895, it currently comprises 27 members from 19 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iczn.org/content/about-iczn|title=About the ICZN - International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly practicing zoological [[taxonomist]]s.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iczn.org/content/about-iczn|title=About the ICZN - International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The ICZN is governed by the "Constitution of the ICZN", which is usually published together with the [[ICZN Code]].&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?nfv=&amp;booksection=constitution|title=International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members are elected by the Section of Zoological Nomenclature,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp ICZN Code] Art. 77.3.1, [http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/includes/page.jsp?nfv=&amp;booksection=constitution ICZN Constitution] Art. 3.1.1., 4.4.1, 4.5, 11.1.2, 16.1.3&lt;/ref&gt; established by the [[International Union of Biological Sciences]] (IUBS).

The regular term of service of a member of the Commission is 6 years. Members can be re-elected up to a total of three full six-year terms in a row. After 18 continuous years of elected service, a break of at least 3 years is prescribed before the member can stand again for election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp?nfv=&amp;booksection=constitution ICZN Constitution] Art. 3.1, 3.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Since 2014, the work of the Commission is supported by a small secretariat based at the [[National University of Singapore]], in [[Singapore]]. Previously, the secretariat was based in London and funded by the '''International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://iczn.org/content/international-trust-zoological-nomenclature |title= International Trust for Zoological Nomenclature  |publisher=ICZN |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission assists the zoological community "through generation and dissemination of information on the correct use of the scientific names of animals".&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

The ICZN publishes the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (usually referred to as  "the Code" or "the ICZN Code"), a widely accepted [[Convention (norm)|convention]] containing the rules for the formal [[scientific name|scientific naming]] of all [[organism]]s that are treated as [[animal]]s. New editions of the Code are elaborated by the Editorial Committee appointed by the Commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted-sites/iczn/code/index.jsp ICZN Constitution] Art. 16.2&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th edition of the Code (1999) was edited by seven people.&lt;ref&gt;W. D. L. Ride, H. G. Cogger, C. Dupuis, O. Kraus, A. Minelli, F. C. Thompson, P. K. Tubbs, as given in the ICZN Code 4th edition (printed version) p. IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission also provides rulings on individual problems brought to its attention, as arbitration may be necessary in contentious cases, where strict adherence to the Code would interfere with stability of usage (e.g., see [[conserved name]]). These rulings are published in the '''''Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature'''''.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; Starting in 2017, volumes 65 (2008) onwards of the ''Bulletin'' will be available online to subscribers in the [[BioOne]] journal database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bioone.org/page/resources/institutions/new |title=Title additions &amp; departures |publisher=BioOne |accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19400">The '''International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units''' is an obsolete system of units used for measuring electrical and magnetic quantities. It was proposed as a system of practical international units by unanimous recommendation at the [[International Electrical Congress]] (Chicago, 1893), discussed at other Congresses, and finally adopted at the International Conference on Electric Units and Standards in London in 1908&lt;ref name=eb11-p742/&gt;. It was rendered obsolete by the inclusion of electromagnetic units in the [[International System of Units]] (SI) at the 9th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] in 1948.

==Earlier systems==
The link between electromagnetic units and the more familiar units of [[length]], [[mass]] and [[time]] was first demonstrated by [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] in 1832 with his measurement of the Earth's magnetic field,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = C.

[http://www.21stcenturysciencetech.com/translations/gaussMagnetic.pdf English translation].&lt;/ref&gt; and the principle was extended to electrical measurements by [[Franz Ernst Neumann|Neumann]] in 1845.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = F.

The development of the electric telegraph (an invention of Gauss and Weber) demonstrated the need for accurate electrical measurements.

However these units were both difficult to [[Realisation (metrology)|realize]] and (often) impractically small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | contribution = Units, Physical | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | volume = 27 | year = 1911 | edition = 11th |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri27chisrich#page/740/mode/1up| pages = 743}}&lt;/ref&gt; To overcome these handicaps, the B.A. also proposed a set of "practical" or "reproduceable" units, which were not directly linked to the CGS system but which were, as near as experimental accuracy allowed, equal to multiples of the corresponding CGS units.&lt;ref name=eb11-p741&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | contribution = Units, Physical | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | volume = 27 | year = 1911 | edition = 11th |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri27chisrich#page/741/mode/1up| pages = 741}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The B.A. had developed ''two'' sets of CGS units. The practical units were based on the [[Centimetre gram second system of units#Electromagnetic units (EMU)|electromagnetic set of units]] rather than the [[electrostatic units|electrostatic set]].&lt;ref name=eb11-p741/&gt;

==1893 system==
The B.A. system of practical units gained considerable international support, and was adopted – with one important modification – by the [[International Exposition of Electricity|First International Conference of Electricians]] (Paris, 1881). The British Association had constructed an artefact representation of the ohm (a standard length of resistance wire which had a resistance of 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;CGS&amp;nbsp;units of electric resistance, that is one ohm) whereas the international conference preferred a method of [[Realisation (metrology)|realization]] that could be repeated in different laboratories in different countries. The chosen method was based on the [[resistivity]] of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], by measuring the resistance of a column of mercury of specified dimensions (106&amp;nbsp;cm&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;): however, the chosen length of column was almost 3&amp;nbsp;millimetres too short, leading to a difference of 0.28% between the new practical units and the CGS units which were supposedly their basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = ohm | url = http://www.sizes.com/units/ohm.htm | publisher = sizes.com | accessdate = 2010-08-11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anomaly was resolved at another international conference, in Chicago in 1893, by a correction in the definition of the ohm. The units agreed at this conference were termed "international" units, to distinguish them from their predecessors.

The 1893 system had three base units: the international [[ampere]], the international [[ohm]] and the international [[volt]].

The international units did not have the same formal legal status as the [[metre]] and the [[kilogram]] through the [[Metre Convention]] (1875), although several countries adopted the definition within their national laws (e.g., the United States, through Public Law&amp;nbsp;105 of July&amp;nbsp;12, 1894&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=T.C. Mendenhall  |date=1895 |title=Legal Units of Electric Measure |journal=Science |volume=1 |issue= |pages=9-15 |jstor=1623949 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Overdefinition and the 1908 modification==
The 1893 system of units was overdefined, as can be seen from an examination of [[Ohm's law]]:
:[[Electric potential difference|''V'']] = [[Electric current|''I'']][[Electric resistance|''R'']]
By Ohm's law, knowing any two of the physical quantities ''V'', ''I'' or ''R'' (potential difference, current or resistance) will define the third, and yet the 1893 system defines the units for all three quantities. With improvements in measurement techniques, it was soon recognised that

:1&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≠ 1&amp;nbsp;A&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;Ω&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;.

The solution came at an international conference in London in 1908. The essential point was to reduce the number of base units from three to two by redefining the international volt as a derived unit. There were several other modifications of less practical importance:&lt;ref name=eb11-p742&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | contribution = Units, Physical | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | volume = 27 | year = 1911 | edition = 11th |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri27chisrich#page/742/mode/1up| pages = 742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*the international ampere and the international ohm were formally defined in terms of the corresponding [[Centimetre gram second system of units#Electromagnetic units (EMU)|CGS electromagnetic units]], with the 1893 definitions retained as preferred [[Realisation (metrology)|realizations]];
*the preferred realization of the international volt was in terms of the electromotive force of a [[Weston cell]] at 20&amp;nbsp;°C (1.0184&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;), as this type of cell has a lower temperature coefficient than the Clark cell;
*several other derived units for use in electrical and magnetic measurements were formally defined:&lt;ref group="Note" name="update"/&gt;
;International [[Coulomb]]:the [[electric charge]] transferred by a current of one international ampere in one second;&lt;ref group="Note" name="CF"&gt;The [[coulomb]] and the [[farad]] had been used in earlier B.A. systems of electrical units with slightly different definitions, hence the need to add the qualifier "international".&lt;/ref&gt;
;International [[Farad]]:the [[capacitance]] of a [[capacitor]] charged to a potential of one international volt by one international coulomb of electricity;&lt;ref group="Note" name="CF"/&gt;
;[[Joule]]:10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; units of [[work (physics)|work]] in the CGS system, represented sufficiently well for practical use by the energy expended in one second by an international ampere in an international ohm;
;[[Watt]]:10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; units of [[power (physics)|power]] in the CGS system, represented sufficiently well for practical use by the work done at the rate of one joule per second;
;[[Henry (unit)|Henry]]:the [[inductance]] in a circuit when an electromotive force induced in this circuit is one international volt, while the inducing current varies at the rate of one ampere per second.

==SI units==
With advances in the theory of [[electromagnetism]] and in [[quantity calculus]], it became apparent that a coherent absolute system of units could only include one electromagnetic [[Base unit (measurement)|base unit]]. The first such system was proposed by [[Giovanni Giorgi|Giorgi]] in 1901:&lt;ref name="EB11"&gt;{{citation | contribution = Units, Physical | title = Encyclopædia Britannica | volume = 27 | year = 1911 | edition = 11th | pages = 738–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IEC"&gt;{{citation | title = Giovanni Giorgi | url = http://www.iec.ch/about/history/figures/giovanni_giorgi.htm | publisher = International Electrotechnical Commission | accessdate = 2014-02-21}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Giorgi | first = G. | authorlink = Giovanni Giorgi | title = Rational Units of Electromagnetism}}. [http://www.iec.ch/about/history/documents/documents_giovanni.htm Original manuscript with handwritten notes by Oliver Heaviside].&lt;/ref&gt; it used the [[ohm]] as the additional base unit in the [[MKS system]], and so is often referred to as the MKSΩ system or the Giorgi system.

An additional problem with the CGS system of electrical units, pointed out as early as 1882 by [[Oliver Heaviside]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Heaviside | first = O. | authorlink = Oliver Heaviside | title = The Relations between Magnetic Force and Electric Current | journal = The Electrician | issue = 18 November |page=6 | year = 1882 |url=https://archive.org/stream/electricalpapers01heavuoft#page/194/mode/2up}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was that they were not "rationalized", that is they failed to properly take account of [[permittivity]] and [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] as properties of a medium. Giorgi was also a great proponent of rationalization of the electrical units.&lt;ref name="IEC"/&gt;

The choice of electrical unit for the base unit in a rationalized system depends only on practical considerations, particularly the ability to [[Realisation (metrology)|realize]] the unit accurately and reproducibly. The [[ampere]] rapidly gained support over the ohm, as many national standards laboratories were already realizing the ampere in absolute terms using [[ampere balance]]s.&lt;ref name="EB11"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = R. T. | last = Glazebrook | authorlink = Richard Glazebrook | title = The fourth unit of the Giorgi system of electrical units | year = 1936 | journal = Proc. Phys. Soc. | volume = 48 | pages = 452 | doi = 10.1088/0959-5309/48/3/312}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) adopted the Giorgi system with the ampere replacing the ohm in 1935, and this choice of base units is often called the MKSA system.&lt;ref name="IEC"/&gt;

The [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) approved a new set of definitions for electrical units, based on the rationalized MKSA system, in 1946, and these were internationally adopted under the [[Metre Convention]] by the 9th&amp;nbsp;[[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|page=144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this system, which would become the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the ohm is a derived unit.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The ohm is the electric resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of 1&amp;nbsp;volt, applied to these points, produces in the conductor a current of 1&amp;nbsp;ampere, the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force.&lt;/ref&gt;

The SI definitions of the electrical units are formally equivalent to the 1908 international definitions, and so there should not have been any change in the size of the units. Nevertheless, the international ohm and the international volt were not usually realized in absolute terms but by reference to a standard resistance and a standard electromotive force respectively. The realizations recommended in 1908 are not exactly equivalent to the absolute definitions: recommended conversion factors&lt;ref&gt;{{GreenBook2nd|page=114}}.&lt;/ref&gt; are
:1 Ω&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 1.000 49 Ω
:1 V&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 1.000 34 V
although slightly different factors may apply for individual standards in national measurement laboratories.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Conversion factors for the U.S. national standards (NIST) are 1&amp;nbsp;Ω&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|1.000 495&amp;nbsp;Ω}} and 1&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= {{nowrap|1.000 330&amp;nbsp;V}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As the international ampere was usually realized by means of an ampere balance rather than electrolytically,&lt;ref name="EB11"/&gt; 1&amp;nbsp;A&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 1&amp;nbsp;A. The conversion factor for the "electrolytic" ampere (A&lt;sub&gt;elec&lt;/sub&gt;) can be calculated from modern values of the [[atomic weight]] of [[silver]] and the [[Faraday constant]]:
:1 A&lt;sub&gt;elec&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.000 022(2) A

'''Intuitive statistics''', or '''folk statistics''', refers to the cognitive phenomenon where organisms use data to make generalizations and predictions about the world. This can be a small amount of sample data or training instances, which in turn contribute to [[Inductive reasoning|inductive inferences]] about either population-level properties, future data, or both. Inferences can involve revising hypotheses, or beliefs, in light of probabilistic data that inform and motivate future predictions. The informal tendency for cognitive animals to intuitively generate statistical inferences, when formalized with certain [[Probability axioms|axioms of probability]] theory, constitutes [[statistics]] as an academic discipline.

Because this capacity can accommodate a broad range of informational domains, the subject matter is similarly broad and overlaps substantially with other cognitive phenomena. Indeed, some have argued that "cognition as an intuitive statistician" is an apt companion metaphor to the computer metaphor of cognition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cognition as intuitive statistics |last=Gigerenzer |first=Gerd |last2=Murray |first2=David J. |isbn=9781138950221 |location=London |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2015 |oclc=918941179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others appeal to a variety of statistical and probabilistic mechanisms behind theory construction&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gopnik |first=Alison |last2=Tenenbaum |first2=Joshua B. |date= May 2007 |title=Bayesian networks, Bayesian learning and cognitive development |journal=Developmental Science|volume=10|issue=3|pages=281–287|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2007.00584.x|issn=1363-755X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gopnik|first=Alison|date= August 2011 |title=The Theory Theory 2.0: Probabilistic Models and Cognitive Development |journal=Child Development Perspectives |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=161–163 |doi=10.1111/j.1750-8606.2011.00179.x |issn=1750-8592}}&lt;/ref&gt; and category structuring.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Research in this domain commonly focuses on generalizations relating to number, relative frequency, risk, and any systematic signatures in inferential capacity that an organism (e.g., humans, or non-human primates) might have.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cognition and chance : the psychology of probabilistic reasoning |last=Nickerson |first=Raymond S. |date=2004 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |isbn=9780805848991 |location=Mahwah, N.J. |oclc=56115142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and theory ==
Intuitive inferences can involve generating hypotheses from incoming sense data, such as [[categorization]] and [[concept]] structuring. Data are typically probabilistic and uncertainty is the rule, rather than the exception, in learning, perception, language, and thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |book-title=Concepts and conceptual development : ecological and intellectual factors in categorization |publication-date=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |editor-last=Neisser |editor-first=Ulric |conference=First Emory Cognition Project Conference, Oct. 11-12, 1984, Emory University |isbn=0521322197 |location=Cambridge |oclc=14905937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite book |first=N.D. |last=Goodman |first2=J.B. |last2=Tenenbaum |year=2016 |title=Probabilistic Models of Cognition |edition=2nd |access-date=2018-04-24 |url=https://probmods.org/ |via=https://probmods.org/|dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511214910/https://probmods.org/ |archive-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, researchers have drawn from ideas in [[probability theory]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[computer science]], and [[psychology]] to model cognition as a predictive and generative system of probabilistic [[Mental representation|representations]], allowing information structures to support multiple inferences in a variety of contexts and combinations.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This approach has been called a probabilistic [[Language of thought hypothesis|language of thought]] because it constructs representations probabilistically, from pre-existing concepts to predict a possible and likely state of the world.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/tger/www/papers/Concepts%20in%20a%20probabilistic%20language%20of%20thought%20(Goodman,%20Tenenbaum,%20Gerstenberg,%202014).pdf |last=Goodman |first=N.D. |last2=Tenenbaum |first2=J.B. |last3=Gerstenberg |first3=T. |date=February 15, 2014 |title=Concepts in a Probabilistic Language of Thought |access-date=2018-07-24 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427003350/https://web.mit.edu/tger/www/papers/Concepts%20in%20a%20probabilistic%20language%20of%20thought%20(Goodman,%20Tenenbaum,%20Gerstenberg,%202014).pdf |archive-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Probability ===
Statisticians and probability theorists have long debated about the use of various tools, assumptions, and problems relating to inductive inference in particular.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[David Hume]] famously considered the [[problem of induction]], questioning the logical foundations of how and why people can arrive at conclusions that extend beyond past experiences - both spatiotemporally and [[Epistemology|epistemologically]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A treatise of human nature |last=Hume |first=David |date=2005 |publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble |last2=Levine |first2=Michael P. |isbn=0760771723 |location=New York, N.Y. |oclc=404025944}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, theorists have considered the problem by emphasizing techniques for arriving from data to hypothesis using formal content-independent procedures, or in contrast, by considering informal, content-dependent tools for inductive inference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=An introduction to probability and inductive logic |last=Hacking |first=Ian |date=2001 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521772877 |location=Cambridge, U.K. |oclc=44969631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Savage | first = Leonard J. | year = 1954 | title = The Foundations of Statistics | location = New York | publisher = Wiley }}&lt;/ref&gt; Searches for formal procedures have led to different developments in statistical inference and probability theory with different assumptions, including [[Frequentist inference|Fisherian frequentist statistics]], [[Bayesian inference]], and [[Neyman–Pearson lemma|Neyman-Pearson statistics]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Gerd Gigerenzer]] and David Murray argue that twentieth century psychology as a discipline adopted probabilistic inference as a unified set of ideas and ignored the controversies among probability theorists. They claim that a normative but incorrect view of how humans "ought to think rationally" follows from this acceptance. They also maintain, however, that the intuitive statistician metaphor of cognition is promising, and should consider different formal tools or [[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|heuristics]] as specialized for different problem domains, rather than a content- or context-free toolkit. Signal detection theorists and object detection models, for example, often use a Neyman-Pearson approach, whereas Fisherian frequentist statistics might aid cause-effect inferences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Frequentist inference ====
[[Frequentist inference]] focuses on the relative proportions or frequencies of occurrences to draw probabilistic conclusions. It is defined by its closely related concept, [[frequentist probability]]. This entails a view that "probability" is nonsensical in the absence of pre-existing data, because it is understood as a relative frequency that long-run samples would approach given large amounts of data.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Probability, statistics, and truth|last=Von Mises |first=Richard |date=1981 |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=0486242145 |edition=2nd |location=New York |oclc=8320292}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]] have argued that it is not possible to derive a probability without reference to some frequency of previous outcomes, and this likely has [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary origins]]: Single-event probabilities, they claim, are not observable because organisms evolved to intuitively understand and make statistical inferences from frequencies of prior events, rather than to "see" probability as an intrinsic property of an event.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cosmides |first=L |last2=Tooby |first2=J |title=Are humans good intuitive statisticians after all? Rethinking some conclusions from the literature on judgment under uncertainty |journal=Cognition |volume=58 |issue=1 |date=January 1996 |pages=1–73 |doi=10.1016/0010-0277(95)00664-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bayesian inference ====
[[Bayesian inference]] generally emphasizes the [[Bayesian probability|subjective probability]] of a hypothesis, which is computed as a posterior probability using [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes' Theorem]]. It requires a "starting point" called a prior probability, which has been contentious for some frequentists who claim that frequency data are required to ''develop'' a prior probability, in contrast to taking a probability as an ''a priori'' assumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Bayesian models have been quite popular among psychologists, particularly learning theorists, because they appear to emulate the iterative, predictive process by which people learn and develop expectations from new observations, while giving appropriate weight to previous observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Causality : models, reasoning, and inference |last=Pearl |first=Judea |date=2000 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781139649360 |location=Cambridge, U.K. |oclc=834142635}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andy Clark]], a cognitive scientist and philosopher, recently wrote a detailed argument in support of understanding the brain as a constructive Bayesian [[Inference engine|engine]] that is fundamentally action-oriented and [[Predictive coding|predictive]], rather than passive or reactive.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; More classic lines of evidence cited among supporters of Bayesian inference include conservatism, or the phenomenon where people modify previous beliefs ''toward'', but not all the way to, a conclusion implied by previous observations.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This pattern of behavior is similar to the pattern of posterior probability distributions when a Bayesian model is conditioned on data, though critics argued that this evidence had been overstated and lacked mathematical rigor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Edwards W | veditors = Kleinmuntz B | series = Symposium on Cognition | year = 1968 | chapter = Conservatism in human information processing | title = Formal representation of human judgment | publisher = Wiley | location = New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alison Gopnik]] more recently tackled the problem by advocating the use of [[Bayesian network]]s, or directed [[Graph theory|graph]] representations of conditional dependencies. In a Bayesian network, edge weights are conditional dependency strengths that are updated in light of new data, and nodes are observed variables. The graphical representation itself constitutes a model, or hypothesis, about the world and is subject to change, given new data.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

==== Error management theory ====
[[Error management theory]] (EMT) is an application of Neyman-Pearson statistics to cognitive and [[evolutionary psychology]]. It maintains that the possible [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] costs and benefits of type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) [[Type I and type II errors|errors]] are relevant to adaptively rational inferences, toward which an organism is expected to be biased due to [[natural selection]]. EMT was originally developed by Martie Haselton and [[David Buss]], with initial research focusing on its possible role in sexual overperception bias in men and sexual underperception bias in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haselton|first=Martie G.|last2=Buss|first2=David M.|date=2000|title=Error management theory: A new perspective on biases in cross-sex mind reading. |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=78|issue=1|pages=81–91|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.1.81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is closely related to a concept called the "smoke detector principle" in evolutionary theory. It is defined by the tendency for immune, affective, and behavioral defenses to be hypersensitive and overreactive, rather than insensitive or weakly expressed. [[Randolph M. Nesse|Randolph Nesse]] maintains that this is a consequence of a typical payoff structure in [[Detection theory|signal detection]]: In a system that is invariantly structured with a relatively low cost of false positives and high cost of false negatives, naturally selected defenses are expected to err on the side of hyperactivity in response to potential threat cues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nesse|first=R.

=== Heuristics and biases ===
[[Heuristics in judgment and decision-making|Heuristics]] are efficient rules, or computational shortcuts, for producing a judgment or decision. The intuitive statistician metaphor of cognition&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; led to a shift in focus for many psychologists, away from emotional or motivational principles and toward computational or inferential principles.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Gigerenzer, G. (1991). How to make cognitive illusions disappear: Beyond “heuristics and biases”. ''European review of social psychology'', ''2''(1), 83-115.&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical studies investigating these principles have led some to conclude that human cognition, for example, has built-in and systematic errors in inference, or [[cognitive bias]]es. As a result, cognitive psychologists have largely adopted the view that intuitive judgments, generalizations, and numerical or probabilistic calculations are systematically biased. The result is commonly an error in judgment, including (but not limited to) recurrent logical fallacies (e.g., the conjunction fallacy), innumeracy, and emotionally motivated shortcuts in reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Heuristics and biases : the psychology of intuitive judgment |date=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |last=Gilovich |first=Thomas |last2=Griffin |first2=Dale W. |last3=Kahneman |first3=Daniel |isbn=9780521796798 |location=Cambridge, U.K. |oclc=47364085}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |last2=Tversky |first2=Amos |date=1979 |title=Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk |jstor=1914185 |journal=Econometrica |volume=47|issue=2|pages=263–291|doi=10.2307/1914185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":99"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tversky |first=Amos |last2=Kahneman |first2=Daniel |date=1983 |title=Extensional versus intuitive reasoning: The conjunction fallacy in probability judgment |journal=Psychological Review|volume=90|issue=4|pages=293–315|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.90.4.293}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":98"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gilovich |first=Thomas |last2=Vallone |first2=Robert |last3=Tversky |first3=Amos |date=July 1985 |title=The hot hand in basketball: On the misperception of random sequences |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=295–314 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(85)90010-6 |issn=0010-0285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social and cognitive psychologists have thus considered it "paradoxical" that humans can outperform powerful computers at complex tasks, yet be deeply flawed and error-prone in simple, everyday judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Human inference : strategies and shortcomings of social judgment |last=Nisbett |first=Richard E. |last2=Ross |first2=Lee |date=1980 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |isbn=0134451309 |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. |oclc=5411525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of this research was carried out by [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] as an expansion of work by [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] on [[bounded rationality]] and [[satisficing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Simon |first=H.A. |date=March 1956 |title=Rational choice and the structure of the environment |journal=Psychological Review |volume=63 |issue=2 |pages=129–138 |doi=10.1037/h0042769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tversky and Kahneman argue that people are regularly biased in their judgments under uncertainty, because in a speed-accuracy tradeoff they often rely on fast and intuitive heuristics with wide margins of error rather than slow calculations from statistical principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |last2=Tversky |first2=Amos |year=1973 |title=On the psychology of prediction |journal=Psychological Review |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=237–251 |doi=10.1037/h0034747}}&lt;/ref&gt; These errors are called "cognitive illusions" because they involve systematic divergences between judgments and accepted, normative rules in statistical prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ajzen |first=Icek |year=1977 |title=Intuitive theories of events and the effects of base-rate information on prediction |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=303–314 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.35.5.303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gigerenzer has been critical of this view, arguing that it builds from a flawed assumption that a unified "normative theory" of statistical prediction and probability exists. His contention is that cognitive psychologists neglect the diversity of ideas and assumptions in probability theory, and in some cases, their mutual incompatibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Logic of Statistical Inference |last=Hacking |date=1965 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521051651 |oclc=704034945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Consequently, Gigerenzer argues that many cognitive illusions are not violations of probability theory ''per se'', but involve some kind of experimenter confusion between subjective probabilities with degrees of confidence and long-run outcome frequencies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Cosmides and Tooby similarly claim that different probabilistic assumptions can be more or less normative and rational in different types of situations, and that there is not general-purpose statistical toolkit for making inferences across all informational domains. In a review of several experiments they conclude, in support of Gigerenzer,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; that previous heuristics and biases experiments did not represent problems in an [[Ecological validity|ecologically valid]] way, and that re-representing problems in terms of frequencies rather than single-event probabilities can make cognitive illusions largely vanish.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Tversky and Kahneman refuted this claim, arguing that making illusions disappear by manipulating them, whether they are cognitive or visual, does not undermine the initially discovered illusion. They also note that Gigerenzer ignores cognitive illusions resulting from frequency data, e.g., illusory correlations such as the [[Hot-hand fallacy|hot hand]] in basketball.&lt;ref name=":98" /&gt; This, they note, is an example of an illusory positive autocorrelation that cannot be corrected by converted data to natural frequencies.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |last2=Tversky |first2=Amos |date=1996 |title=On the reality of cognitive illusions |journal=Psychological Review |volume=103 |issue=3 |pages=582–591 |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.103.3.582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Adaptationism|adaptationists]], EMT can be applied to inference under any informational domain where risk or uncertainty are present, such as predator avoidance, [[Agent detection|agency detection]], or [[foraging]]. Researchers advocating this adaptive rationality view argue that evolutionary theory casts heuristics and biases in a new light, namely, as computationally efficient and [[Ecological rationality|ecologically rational]] shortcuts, or instances of adaptive error management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = Martie | last1 = Haselton | first2 = Gregory A. | last2 = Bryant | first3 = Andreas | last3 = Wilke | first4 = David | last4 = Frederick | first5 = Andrew | last5 = Galperin | first6 = Willem E. | last6 = Frankenhuis | first7 = Tyler | last7 = Moore | year = 2009 | title = Adaptive rationality: An evolutionary perspective on cognitive bias | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 733–763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Base rate neglect ====
People often neglect [[Base rate fallacy|base rates]], or true actuarial facts about the probability or rate of a phenomenon, and instead give inappropriate amounts of weight to specific observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|date=1973|title=On the psychology of prediction. |journal=Psychological Review|volume=80|issue=4|pages=237–251|doi=10.1037/h0034747 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bar-Hillel|first=Maya|date=May 1980|title=The base-rate fallacy in probability judgments|journal=Acta Psychologica|volume=44|issue=3|pages=211–233|doi=10.1016/0001-6918(80)90046-3|issn=0001-6918}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Bayesian model of inference, this would amount to an underweighting of the prior probability,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; which has been cited as evidence against the appropriateness of a normative Bayesian framework for modeling cognition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Frequency representations can resolve base rate neglect, and some consider the phenomenon to be an experimental artifact, i.e., a result of probabilities or rates being represented as mathematical abstractions, which are difficult to intuitively think about.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Gigerenzer speculates an ecological reason for this, noting that individuals learn frequencies through successive trials in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Gigerenzer, G. (1994). Why the distinction between single-event probabilities and frequencies is important for psychology (and vice versa). In G. Wright &amp; P. Ayton (Eds.), ''Subjective probability'' (pp. 129-161). Oxford, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Tversky and Kahneman refute Gigerenzer's claim, pointing to experiments where subjects predicted a disease based on the presence vs. absence of pre-specified symptoms across 250 trials, with feedback after each trial.&lt;ref&gt;Gluck, M., &amp; Bower, G. H. (1988). From conditioning to category learning: An adaptive network model. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General. 117. 227-247&lt;/ref&gt; They note that base rate neglect was still found, despite the frequency formulation of subject trials in the experiment.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==== Conjunction fallacy ====
Another popular example of a supposed cognitive illusion is the [[conjunction fallacy]], described in an experiment by Tversky and Kahneman known as the "Linda problem." In this experiment, participants are presented with a short description of a person called Linda, who is 31 years old, single, intelligent, outspoken, and went to a university where she majored in philosophy, was concerned about discrimination and social justice, and participated in anti-nuclear protests. When participants were asked if it were more probable that Linda is (1) a bank teller, or (2) a bank teller and a feminist, 85% responded with option 2, even though it option 1 cannot be less probable than option 2. They concluded that this was a product of a [[representativeness heuristic]], or a tendency to draw probabilistic inferences based on property similarities between instances of a concept, rather than a statistically structured inference.&lt;ref name=":99" /&gt;

Gigerenzer argued that the conjunction fallacy is based on a single-event probability, and would dissolve under a frequentist approach. He and other researchers demonstrate that conclusions from the conjunction fallacy result from ambiguous language, rather than robust statistical errors or cognitive illusions.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fiedler|first=Klaus|date= September 1988 |title=The dependence of the conjunction fallacy on subtle linguistic factors |journal=Psychological Research|volume=50|issue=2|pages=123–129|doi=10.1007/bf00309212 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an alternative version of the Linda problem, participants are told that 100 people fit Linda's description and are asked how many are (1) bank tellers and (2) bank tellers and feminists. Experimentally, this version of the task appears to eliminate or mitigate the conjunction fallacy.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Computational models ===
There has been some question about how concept structuring and generalization can be understood in terms of brain architecture and processes. This question is impacted by a neighboring debate among theorists about the nature of thought, specifically between [[Connectionism|connectionist]] and [[Language of thought hypothesis|language of thought]] models. Concept generalization and classification have been modeled in a variety of connectionist models, or [[Artificial neural network|neural networks]], specifically in domains like language learning and categorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Rethinking innateness : a connectionist perspective on development |date=1996 |publisher=MIT Press |last=Elman |first=Jeffrey L. |isbn=0585020345 |location=Cambridge, Mass. |oclc=42854159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Computational explorations in cognitive neuroscience : understanding the mind by simulating the brain |last=O'Reilly |first=Randall C. |date=2000 |publisher=MIT Press |last2=Munakata |first2=Yuko |isbn=0262650541 |location=Cambridge, Mass. |oclc=43083232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some emphasize the limitations of pure connectionist models when they are expected to generalize future instances after training on previous instances. [[Gary Marcus]], for example, asserts that training data would have to be completely exhaustive for generalizations to occur in existing connectionist models, and that as a result, they do not handle novel observations well. He further advocates an integrationist perspective between a language of thought, consisting of symbol representations and operations, and connectionist models than retain the distributed processing that is likely used by neural networks in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The algebraic mind : integrating connectionism and cognitive science |last=Marcus |first=Gary F. |date=2001 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0262133792 |location=Cambridge, Mass. |oclc=43954048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evidence in humans ==
In practice, humans routinely make conceptual, linguistic, and probabilistic generalizations from small amounts of data.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Surfaces and essences : Analogy as the fuel and fire of thinking |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas R. |date=2012 |publisher=Basic Books |last2=Sander |first2=Emmanuel |isbn=9780465018475 |location=New York |oclc=841172513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Women, fire, and dangerous things : what categories reveal about the mind |last=Lakoff |first=George |date=1987 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226468044 |location=Chicago |oclc=14001013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Griffiths |first=Thomas L. |last2=Tenenbaum |first2=Joshua B. |date=September 2006 |title=Optimal predictions in everyday cognition |journal=Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=9 |pages=767–773 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01780.x |issn=0956-7976 |pmid=16984293}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate about the utility of various tools of statistical inference in understanding the mind, but it is commonly accepted that the human mind is ''somehow'' an exceptionally apt prediction machine, and that action-oriented processes underlying this phenomenon, whatever they might entail, are at the core of cognition.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Andy|date= June 2013 | title=Whatever next?

=== Infant studies ===
[[Developmental psychology|Developmental psychologists]] such as [[Jean Piaget]] have traditionally argued that children do not develop the general cognitive capacities for probabilistic inference and hypothesis testing until concrete operational (age 7–11 years) and formal operational (age 12 years-adulthood) [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|stages of development]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Origin of the Idea of Chance in Children |last=Piaget |first=Jean |date=1976 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co |last2=Inhelder |first2=Bärbel |isbn=9780393008036 |location=New York |oclc=753479728 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Piaget |first=J. |chapter=Piaget’s Theory |editor=P.

This is sometimes contrasted to a growing preponderance of empirical evidence suggesting that humans are capable generalizers in infancy. For example, looking-time experiments using expected outcomes of red and white ping pong ball proportions found that 8-month-old infants appear to make inferences about population characteristics from which the sample came, and vice versa when given population-level data.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Xu |first=Fei |last2=Garcia |first2=Vashti |date=April 1, 2008 |title=Intuitive statistics by 8-month-old infants |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=105 |issue=13 |pages=5012–5015 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0704450105|pmc=2278207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other experiments have similarly supported a capacity for probabilistic inference with 6- and 11-month-old infants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Denison |first=Stephanie |last2=Xu |first2=Fei |date=July 2010 |title=Integrating Physical Constraints in Statistical Inference by 11-Month-Old Infants |journal=Cognitive Science |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=885–908 |doi=10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01111.x |issn=1551-6709}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not in 4.5-month-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Denison |first=Stephanie |last2=Reed |first2=Christie |last3=Xu |first3=Fei |date=February 2013 |title=The emergence of probabilistic reasoning in very young infants: Evidence from 4.5- and 6-month-olds |journal=Developmental Psychology |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=243–249 |doi=10.1037/a0028278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colored ball paradigm in these experiments did not distinguish the possibilities of infants' inferences based on quantity vs. proportion, which was addressed in follow-up research where 12-month-old infants seemed to understand proportions, basing probabilistic judgments - motivated by preferences for the more probable outcomes - on initial evidence of the proportions in their available options.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Denison |first=Stephanie |last2=Xu |first2=Fei |date= March 2014 |title=The origins of probabilistic inference in human infants |journal=Cognition |volume=130 |issue=3 |pages=335–347 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2013.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the effectiveness of looking-time tasks allowed infants to search for preferred objects in single-sample probability tasks, supporting the notion that infants can infer probabilities of single events when given a small or large initial sample size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Denison |first=Stephanie |last2=Xu |first2=Fei |date=September 2010 |title=Twelve- to 14-month-old infants can predict single-event probability with large set sizes |journal=Developmental Science |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=798–803 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00943.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers involved in these findings have argued that humans possess some statistically structured, inferential system during preverbal stages of development and prior to formal education.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

It is less clear, however, how and why generalization is observed in infants: It might extend directly from detection and storage of similarities and differences in incoming data, or frequency representations. Conversely, it might be produced by something like general-purpose Bayesian inference, starting with a knowledge base that is iteratively conditioned on data to update subjective probabilities, or beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gerken |first=LouAnn |date=May 2010 |title=Infants use rational decision criteria for choosing among models of their input |journal=Cognition |volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=362–366 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2010.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gopnik |first=A. |last2=Meltzoff |first2=A.N. |year=1997 |title=Words, thoughts, and theories |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=9780262571265 |oclc=438680292 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ties together questions about the statistical toolkit(s) that might be involved in learning, and how they apply to infant and childhood learning specifically.

Gopnik advocates the hypothesis that infant and childhood learning are examples of inductive inference, a [[Domain-general learning|general-purpose mechanism]] for generalization, acting upon specialized information structures ("[[Theory-theory|theories]]") in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last-author-amp=yes |author1=Gopnik, A. |author2=Wellman, H. |year=1994 |chapter=The theory theory |editor1=A.

In contrast to the general-purpose mechanistic view, some researchers advocate both [[Domain specificity|domain-specific]] information structures and similarly specialized inferential mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The shape of thought : how mental adaptations evolve |last=Barrett |first=H.

Infants use form similarities and differences to develop concepts relating to objects, and this relies on multiple trials with multiple patterns, exhibiting some kind of common property between trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quinn|first=Paul C.|last2=Bhatt|first2=Ramesh S.|date=July 2005|title=Learning perceptual organization in infancy |journal=Psychological Science|volume=16|issue=7|pages=511–515|doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.01567.x|issn=0956-7976|pmid=16008781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants appear to become proficient at this ability in particular by 12 months,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gomez|first=Rebecca L.|last2=Lakusta|first2=Laura|date= November 2004|title=A first step in form-based category abstraction by 12-month-old infants |journal=Developmental Science|volume=7|issue=5|pages=567–580|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2004.00381.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; but different concepts and properties employ different relevant principles of [[Gestalt psychology]], many of which might emerge at different stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Quinn|first=Paul C.|last2=Bhatt|first2=Ramesh S.|last3=Brush|first3=Diana |last4=Grimes|first4=Autumn|last5=Sharpnack |first5=Heather|date=July 2002|title=Development of form similarity as a Gestalt grouping principle in infancy |journal=Psychological Science|volume=13|issue=4|pages=320–328 |doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00459|issn=0956-7976|pmid=12137134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, infant categorization at as early as 4.5 months involves iterative and interdependent processes by which exemplars (data) and their similarities and differences are crucial for drawing boundaries around categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Needham|first=Amy|last2=Dueker|first2=Gwenden|last3=Lockhead|first3=Gregory|date= January 2005 |title=Infants' formation and use of categories to segregate objects |journal=Cognition|volume=94|issue=3|pages=215–240|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2004.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These abstract rules are statistical by nature, because they can entail common co-occurrences of certain perceived properties in past instances and facilitate inferences about their structure in future instances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gómez|first=Rebecca L.|date=September 2002|title=Variability and detection of invariant structure |journal=Psychological Science|volume=13|issue=5|pages=431–436|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00476|issn=0956-7976|pmid=12219809}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Thiessen |first=Erik D. |date=5 January 2017 |title=What's statistical about learning?

==== Language learning ====
Infants and small children are not only capable generalizers of trait quantity and proportion, but of abstract rule-based systems such as [[language]] and [[music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Marcus|first=Gary F. |last2=Fernandes |first2=Keith J. |last3=Johnson |first3=Scott P. |date=May 2007 |title=Infant rule learning facilitated by speech |journal=Psychological Science |volume=18 |issue=5 |pages=387–391 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01910.x |pmid=17576276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gerken |first=LouAnn |last2=Wilson |first2=Rachel |last3=Lewis |first3=William |date=May 2005 |title=Infants can use distributional cues to form syntactic categories |journal=Journal of Child Language |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=249–268 |doi=10.1017/S0305000904006786 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These rules can be referred to as “algebraic rules” of abstract informational structure, and are representations of rule systems, or [[grammar]]s.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; For language, creating generalizations with Bayesian inference and similarity detection has been advocated by researchers as a special case of concept formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tenenbaum |first=J.B. |last2=Griffiths |first2=T.L. |date=August 2001 |title=Generalization, similarity, and Bayesian inference |journal=The Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=629–640; discussion 652–791 |issn=0140-525X |pmid=12048947}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Xu |first=Fei |last2=Tenenbaum |first2=Joshua B. |date=April 2007 |title=Word learning as Bayesian inference |journal=Psychological Review |volume=114 |issue=2 |pages=245–272 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.114.2.245 |pmid=17500627}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants appear to be proficient in inferring abstract and structural rules from streams of linguistic sounds produced in their developmental environments,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gerken |first=L. |date=October 2004 |title=Nine-month-olds extract structural principles required for natural language |journal=Cognition |volume=93 |issue=3 |pages=B89–B96 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2003.11.005 |issn=0010-0277 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and to generate wider predictions based on those rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gerken |first=L. |last2=Bollt |first2=A. |year=2008 |title=Three Exemplars Allow at Least Some Linguistic Generalizations: Implications for Generalization Mechanisms and Constraints |journal=Language Learning and Development |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=228–248 |doi=10.1080/15475440802143117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, 9-month-old infants are capable of more quickly and dramatically updating their expectations when repeated syllable strings contain surprising features, such as rare [[phoneme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gerken |first=LouAnn |last2=Dawson |first2=Colin |last3=Chatila |first3=Razanne |last4=Tenenbaum |first4=Joshua |date=April 2014 |title=Surprise!

== Evidence in non-human animals ==

=== Grey parrots ===
Multiple studies by [[Irene Pepperberg]] and her colleagues suggested that [[Grey parrot]]s (''Psittacus erithacus'') have some capacity for recognizing numbers or number-like concepts, appearing to understand ordinality and [[cardinality]] of numerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pepperberg |first=Irene M. |last2=Carey |first2=Susan |date=November 2012 |title=Grey parrot number acquisition: The inference of cardinal value from ordinal position on the numeral list |journal=Cognition |volume=125 |issue=2 |pages=219–232 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2012.07.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pepperberg |first=Irene M. |date=February 2013 |title=Abstract concepts: Data from a Grey parrot |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=93 |pages=82–90 |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2012.09.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pepperberg |first=Irene M. |last2=Gordon |first2=Jesse D. |date=May 2005 |title=Number Comprehension by a Grey Parrot (''Psittacus erithacus''), Including a Zero-Like Concept |journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology |volume=119 |issue=2 |pages=197–209 |doi=10.1037/0735-7036.119.2.197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent experiments also indicated that, given some language training and capacity for referencing recognized objects, they also have some ability to make inferences about probabilities and hidden object type ratios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Clements |first=Katherine A. |last2=Gray |first2=Suzanne L. |last3=Gross |first3=Brya |last4=Pepperberg |first4=Irene M. |date=May 2018 |title=Initial evidence for probabilistic reasoning in a grey parrot (''Psittacus erithacus'') |journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|doi=10.1037/com0000106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-human primates ===
Experiments found that when reasoning about preferred vs. non-preferred food proportions, [[capuchin monkey]]s were able to make inferences about proportions inferred by sequentially sampled data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Tecwyn |first=Emma C. |last2=Denison |first2=Stephanie |last3=Messer |first3=Emily J.E. |last4=Buchsbaum |first4=Daphna |date=March 2017 |title=Intuitive probabilistic inference in capuchin monkeys |journal=Animal Cognition |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=243–256 |doi=10.1007/s10071-016-1043-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rhesus macaque|Rhesus monkeys]] were similarly capable of using probabilistic and sequentially sampled data to make inferences about rewarding outcomes, and neural activity in the parietal cortex appeared to be involved in the decision-making process when they made inferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Yang |first=Tianming |last2=Shadlen |first2=Michael N. |date=28 June 2007 |title=Probabilistic reasoning by neurons |journal=Nature |volume=447 |issue=7148 |pages=1075–1080 |doi=10.1038/nature05852 |issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of 7 experiments using a variety of relative frequency differences between banana pellets and carrots, [[orangutan]]s, [[bonobo]]s, [[chimpanzee]]s, and [[gorilla]]s also appeared to guide their decisions based on the ratios favoring the banana pellets after this was established as their preferred food item.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rakoczy |first=Hannes |last2=Clüver |first2=Annette |last3=Saucke |first3=Liane |last4=Stoffregen |first4=Nicole |last5=Gräbener |first5=Alice |last6=Migura |first6=Judith |last7=Call |first7=Josep |date=April 2014 |title=Apes are intuitive statisticians |journal=Cognition |volume=131 |issue=1 |pages=60–68 |doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2013.12.011 |issn=0010-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Reasoning in medicine ===
Research on reasoning in medicine, or clinical reasoning, usually focuses on cognitive processes and/or decision-making outcomes among physicians and patients. Considerations include assessments of risk, patient preferences, and [[Evidence-based medicine|evidence-based medical]] knowledge.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Principles and Practice of Case-based Clinical Reasoning Education A Method for Preclinical Students |year=2011 |editor1=ten Cate, Olle |editor2=Custers, Eugène J.F.M. |editor3=Durning, Steven J. |isbn=9783319648286 |location=Cham |publisher=Springer International |oclc=1017833633}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a cognitive level, clinical inference relies heavily on interplay between [[abstraction]], [[Abductive reasoning|abduction]], [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Cambridge handbook of thinking and reasoning |date=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |editor1=Holyoak, Keith James |editor2=Morrison, Robert G. |isbn=9780521824170 |location=New York |oclc=56011371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intuitive "theories," or knowledge in medicine, can be understood as [[Prototype theory|prototypes]] in concept spaces, or alternatively, as semantic networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Custers|first=Eugène J. F. M.|date=May 2015|title=Thirty years of illness scripts: Theoretical origins and practical applications |journal=Medical Teacher|volume=37|issue=5|pages=457–462 |doi=10.3109/0142159X.2014.956052 |pmid=25180878}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Custers|first=E.

==== Communication of patient risk ====
Statistical literacy and risk judgments have been described as problematic for physician-patient communication.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite conference |conference=Ernst Strüngmann Forum 2009: Frankfurt am Main, Germany |book-title=Better doctors, better patients, better decisions : envisioning health care 2020 |publication-date=2011 |publisher=MIT Press |editor1=Gigerenzer, Gerd |editor2=Gray, J. A. Muir |isbn=9780262298957 |location=Cambridge, Mass. |oclc=733263173}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, physicians frequently inflate the perceived risk of non-treatment,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wegwarth |first=Odette |last2=Wagner |first2=Gert G. |last3=Gigerenzer |first3=Gerd |date=August 23, 2017 |title=Can facts trump unconditional trust?

==== Base rates in clinical judgment ====
In studies of [[Base rate fallacy|base rate neglect]], the problems given to participants often use base rates of disease prevalence. In these experiments, physicians and non-physicians are similarly susceptible to base rate neglect, or errors in calculating conditional probability. Here is an example from an empirical survey problem given to experienced physicians: Suppose that a hypothetical cancer had a prevalence of 0.3% in the population, and the true positive rate of a screening test was 50% with a false positive rate of 3%. Given a patient with a positive test result, what is the probability that the patient has cancer? When asked this question, physicians with an average of 14 years experience in medical practice ranged in their answers from 1-99%, with most answers being 47% or 50%. (The correct answer is 5%.)&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; This observation of clinical base rate neglect and conditional probability error has been replicated in multiple empirical studies.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Casscells|first=W.|last2=Schoenberger|first2=A.|last3=Graboys|first3=T. B.|date= November 1978 |title=Interpretation by physicians of clinical laboratory results |journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|volume=299|issue=18|pages=999–1001|doi=10.1056/NEJM197811022991808|issn=0028-4793|pmid=692627}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians' judgments in similar problems, however, improved substantially when the rates were re-formulated as natural frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffrage|first=U.|last2=Gigerenzer|first2=G.|date=May 1998|title=Using natural frequencies to improve diagnostic inferences |journal=Academic Medicine|volume=73|issue=5|pages=538–540|pmid=9609869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Coventry''' (1735–1812) was an English constructor of [[scientific instrument]]s. He made a reputation through the accuracy of his instruments.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Coventry, John|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Coventry was born in [[Southwark]]. He worked with [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[William Henly]] on electrical experiments, in the capacity of assistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=6480|title=Coventry, John|first=Gloria|last=Clifton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
He was the inventor of a new [[hygrometer]], more accurate than any which had been previously in use. This instrument was generally employed by the [[chemist]]s and other scientific men of his day. His [[telescope]]s were found to be more accurately adjusted than those usually employed, and the lenses with which they were fitted were more truly ground. His graduations were especially correct.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

'''Kenneth Pike Emory''' (November 23, 1897 – January 2, 1992) was an American [[anthropologist]] who played a key role in shaping modern anthropology in [[Oceania]]. In the tradition of [[A. L. Kroeber]] and other pioneering anthropologists who trained him, Emory's works span all four major fields of anthropology: [[archaeology]], [[physical anthropology]], [[ethnography]], and [[linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirch 1992, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

With fellow scientist Gerrit P. Wilder, Honolulu botanist, and Mrs. Wilder, historian; Dr. Armstrong Sperry and Dr. Stanley Ball, he was part of the Bishop Museum scientific research party who sailed to the South Pacific on Mr. and Mrs. Kellum schooner Kaimiloa. 
== Biography ==
Kenneth Pike Emory was born November 23, 1897 in [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts]]. He moved to Hawaii when he was two and grew up there, traveling first to Dartmouth and then continued his education afterward at Harvard then received his Phd. from Yale. While he was a high-school student, several archaeological digs in the [[Honolulu]] area piqued his interest in Polynesian [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and [[culture]]. Proselytizing in the first half of the nineteenth century by Roman Catholic, Protestant, and Mormon missionaries had been so successful that by the 1920s Polynesians had abandoned their ancestral gods in all but a few isolated places. When Emory realized this, he dedicated his life to finding and documenting as much pre-Christian Polynesian culture as he could. After attending [[Dartmouth College]], he became associated with the [[Bishop Museum]].

In 1924, with a group of Hawaiian scientists (including Gerrit P. Wilder, botanist; Mrs. Wilder, historian; Dr. [[Armstrong Sperry]], writer and illustrator;  Dr. Stanley Ball), he joined the four masted 170-foot 512 tons vessel Kaimiloa in Honolulu for a five-year expedition, reaching many of the then inaccessible spots of the Pacific. The vessel was a complete floating laboratory, possibly the most complete of any craft that has undertaken a similar trip. Bottles, crates, and boxes are stowed below along with gallons of preservatives for insects and plant specimens for the Bishop Museum.
He then spent the next 60 years roaming the Pacific, seeking out Polynesian settlement sites, excavating relics, and photographing [[petroglyph]]s. He sought out Polynesians who remembered the pre-Christian chants and rituals, and recorded them on film. By the 1950s, he had become the world's foremost expert on Polynesian culture.

Emory theorized that Polynesians were descended&lt;!--?--&gt; from the [[Māori people|Māori]] of New Zealand, and that Polynesian culture originated in [[Tonga]] and [[Samoa]] and migrated eastward through the Pacific to [[Tahiti]], the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], and [[Hawaii]]. Emory believed, but did not attempt to prove, that Polynesians were capable of sailing great distances to all points of the compass. He argued that when the population of an island exceeded its capacity, a king or noble would outfit a large oceangoing vessel and set off to verify rumors of other habitable islands, sending back word of his discovery. Emory believed the [[Hawaiian Islands]] had been colonized by [[Society Islands|Society Islanders]] (Tahitians) in this way. With [[Kon-Tiki]], [[Thor Heyerdahl]] proved that ancient mariners could have sailed westward across the Pacific; Emory replied that Peruvians might have gotten as far west as Easter Island, but its culture was overwhelmingly Polynesian. Others argued that even if Tahitians had found a new land mass such as Hawaii, they would have been unable to return to their point of origin. Emory disagreed, pointing out that contemporary [[copra]] schooners relied on wave direction, ocean currents, and seabirds to guide them to land, and Polynesian legends made frequent reference to celestial navigation. Besides: "If they sailed south they were bound to hit islands whose inhabitants would know where the Society Islands lay."&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, p. 368.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Emory's parents were from Massachusetts. By the time of his birth, Honolulu offered every amenity that could be found in any American city, and regular steamship service connected the city with San Francisco and other Pacific ports.&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaiians accepted the inevitable presence of [[haole]] (Anglos) on their islands, partly because "It is now much easier for (Hawaiians) to live . . . than in the old strenuous days when famine and war were never far off."&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; In Hawaii intermarriage was relatively rare, but in Taiti intermarriage between French and Tahitians was quite common. Emory married a woman whose mother's family was Tahitian and whose father's was French; she considered Paris her second home.&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Emory spent time on [[Kapingamarangi]], a remote Micronesian atoll, which, from his description, approached Rousseau's ideal society: "This traditional lifestyle supported five hundred people on land . . . that did not total more than six-tenths of a square mile. There was no crime. . . . The people . . . were courteous, hospitable, hard-working, . . . and superbly adjusted to their environment.&lt;ref&gt;Krauss, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emory died January 2, 1992 in [[Honolulu]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15247">{{Trigonometry}}
These following is a list of [[integral]]s ([[antiderivative]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]s) of [[trigonometric functions]]. For antiderivatives involving both exponential and trigonometric functions, see [[List of integrals of exponential functions]]. For a complete list of antiderivative functions, see [[Lists of integrals]]. For the special antiderivatives involving trigonometric functions, see [[Trigonometric integral]].

Generally, if the function &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; is any trigonometric function, and &lt;math&gt;\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt; is its derivative,

: &lt;math&gt;\int a\cos nx\,dx = \frac{a}{n}\sin nx+C&lt;/math&gt;

In all formulas the constant ''a'' is assumed to be nonzero, and ''C'' denotes the [[constant of integration]].

Most [[nation-states]] have [[anthem]]s, defined as "a song, as of praise, devotion, or patriotism";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-06-26|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/anthem|title=Anthem |publisher=Lexico Publishing Group|work=[[Reference.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; most anthems are either [[March (music)|marches]] or [[hymn]]s in style. A hymn can become a [[national anthem]] by a provision in the state's constitution, by a law enacted by its legislature, or simply by tradition.&lt;ref name="brit"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=National anthem|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[royal anthem]] is a patriotic song similar to a national anthem, but it specifically praises or prays for a monarch or royal [[dynasty]]. Such anthems are usually performed at public appearances by the monarch or during other events of royal importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/godsave_e.cfm |title=Royal anthem "God Save The Queen" |publisher=[[Department of Canadian Heritage]] |date= |accessdate=2008-04-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080808013133/http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/cpsc-ccsp/sc-cs/godsave_e.cfm |archivedate=2008-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states use the royal anthem as the national anthem, such as the [[The Royal Anthem of Jordan|anthem of Jordan]].

National anthems are usually written in the most common language of the state, whether ''[[De facto#National languages|de facto]]'' or [[Official language|official]]. States with multiple national languages may offer several versions of their anthem. For instance, Switzerland's national anthem has different lyrics for each of the country's four official languages: French, German, Italian, and [[Romansh language|Romansh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-17|url=http://www.ch.ch/schweiz/01063/01065/index.html?lang=en|title=Facts and figures|publisher=[[Government of Switzerland]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611082541/http://www.ch.ch/schweiz/01063/01065/index.html?lang=en|archivedate=2008-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of New Zealand's [[National anthems of New Zealand|two national anthems]] is commonly sung with the first verse in [[Māori language|Māori]] ("Aotearoa") and the second in [[English language|English]] ("God Defend New Zealand"). The tune is the same but the lyrics have different meanings. [[National anthem of South Africa|South Africa's national anthem]] is unique in that it is two different songs put together with five of the country's eleven official languages being used, in which each language comprises a [[stanza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-17|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jan/17/kosovo.serbia|title=There are great national anthems – now we need an international one |publisher="[[The Guardian]]"|date=2008-01-17|author=Ash, Timothy Garton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MPTA-098.jpg|thumb|Main Propulsion Test Article being lifted onto its test stand in 1977.]]
The '''Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA-098)''' was built by [[Rockwell International]] as a testbed for the definitive propulsion and fuel delivery systems for the U.S. [[Space Shuttle|Space Shuttle Program]].

==Description==
Never intended for actual spaceflight, the MPTA consisted of the internal structure of a [[Space Shuttle]] orbiter aft-[[fuselage]], a truss structure that simulated the basic structure and shape of an orbiter mid-fuselage and a complete [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]] (SSME) assembly, including all main propulsion system plumbing and the associated electrical systems.

Later, the very different STA (Structural Test Article) was converted into a flightworthy orbiter, re-designated OV-099, and christened [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']].  Rockwell and [[NASA]] thus retroactively re-designated the MPTA as MPTA-098, though it was never christened with a name.

==History==
On June 24, 1977, MPTA-098 was delivered by Rockwell International to the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]], in [[Hancock County, Mississippi]], where it was mated with the Main Propulsion Test Article External Tank ([[MPTA-ET]]), mounted in a launch orientation and used for static engine tests.

On July 2, 1979, MPTA-098 suffered major structural damage due to a fractured fuel valve on Space Shuttle Main Engine number 2002. The fracture allowed hydrogen to leak into the enclosed aft compartment, raising the pressure to beyond the structural capability of the heat shield supports, severely damaging the structure.

After extensive repairs were completed, testing resumed in September, but on November 4, a high-pressure oxidizer [[turbopump]] failed 9.7 seconds into a scheduled 510-second test. Finally, on December 17, 1979, a complete static firing was accomplished that included all three Space Shuttle Main Engines running at up to 100 percent of rated thrust for 554 seconds, exceeding the predicted maximum time that the SSMEs would burn during an operational shuttle launch.

===Flight certification===
The preliminary flight certification (PFC) program, which would clear the way for the SSMEs to be flown aboard manned vehicles, began in early 1980. A number of setbacks, including an overheating high-pressure turbopump that shut down an engine 4.6 seconds into a 544-second test on April 16, 1980, in July, the burn-through of a hydrogen preburner cancelled a 581-second test after 105 seconds and the [[structural failure]] of a flight-rated nozzle shut down a November 1980 test after 20 seconds, slowed progress dramatically. These failures led to a number of critical changes to the SSMEs and their associated systems.

In June 1980, due to the number of changes in the SSME design since the SSME installation on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']], the three flight-rated SSMEs (numbers 2005, 2006 and 2007) which had performed successful individual 520-second mission demonstration test firings on the NSTL SSME test stand in early 1979, were removed from [[OV-102]], shipped to NSTL, and  successfully recertified. The engines were then shipped back to [[Kennedy Space Center]] and reinstalled on ''Columbia.''

[[Image:MPTA main engines.jpg|thumb|Close-up of three Space Shuttle Main Engines mounted on MPTA-098]]
On January 17, 1981, with less than three months remaining before the scheduled [[STS-1]] launch date, MPTA-098 successfully demonstrated a 625-second firing that included simulated abort profiles, completing the final PFC test and allowing the SSME design to be fully certified for flight, clearing the way for the launch of STS-1 on April 12, 1981.

===Shuttle-C===
From 1981 until 1988, the MPTA-098 and MPTA-ET remained ''in-situ'' on the NSTL test stand, unused. In late 1988, the Essex Corporation used the thrust structure of the MPTA as the basis for an engineering development model for the proposed [[Shuttle-C]] launch vehicle. The model was used by NASA and Boeing at [[Kennedy Space Center]] and the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] to conduct fit-checks and manufacturing engineering studies. The Shuttle-C program was cancelled by the [[United States Congress]] in 1990 and the model was disassembled.

===Present status===
The Main Propulsion Test Article, without truss work, is on display at the [[U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center]], Visitor Information Center for NASA's [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], alongside the MPTA-ET which is mounted under the refurbished ''[[Space Shuttle Pathfinder|Pathfinder]]'' orbiter simulator.

The '''Manhattan Project''' was a research and development undertaking during [[World War II]] that produced the first [[nuclear weapon]]s. It was led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. From 1942 to 1946, the project was under the direction of [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie Groves]] of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]. Nuclear physicist [[Robert Oppenheimer]] was the director of the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] that designed the actual bombs. The Army component of the project was designated the '''Manhattan District'''; ''[[Manhattan]]'' gradually superseded the official codename, '''Development of Substitute Materials''', for the entire project. Along the way, the project absorbed its earlier British counterpart, [[Tube Alloys]]. The Manhattan Project began modestly in 1939, but grew to employ more than 130,000 people and cost nearly US$2&amp;nbsp;billion (about ${{format price|{{Inflation|US-GDP|2000000000|1945|r=-9}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US-GDP}} dollars). Over 90% of the cost was for building factories and to produce [[fissile material]], with less than 10% for development and production of the weapons. Research and production took place at more than 30 sites across the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada.

Two types of atomic bombs were developed concurrently during the war: a relatively simple [[gun-type fission weapon]] and a more complex [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]]. The [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]] gun-type design proved impractical to use with [[plutonium]], and therefore a simpler gun-type called [[Little Boy]] was developed that used [[uranium-235]], an [[isotope]] that makes up only 0.7 percent of natural [[uranium]]. Chemically identical to the most common isotope, [[uranium-238]], and with almost the same mass, it proved difficult to separate the two. Three methods were employed for [[uranium enrichment]]: [[calutron|electromagnetic]], [[gaseous diffusion|gaseous]] and [[thermophoresis|thermal]]. Most of this work was performed at the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] at [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee]].

In parallel with the work on uranium was an effort to produce plutonium. After the feasibility of the world's [[Chicago Pile-1|first artificial nuclear reactor]] was demonstrated in Chicago at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]], it designed the [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]] at Oak Ridge and the production reactors in [[Hanford Site|Hanford, Washington]], in which uranium was irradiated and [[nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] into plutonium. The plutonium was then chemically separated from the uranium, using the [[bismuth phosphate process]]. The [[Fat Man]] plutonium implosion-type weapon was developed in a concerted design and development effort by the Los Alamos Laboratory.

The project was also charged with gathering intelligence on the [[German nuclear weapon project]]. Through [[Operation Alsos]], Manhattan Project personnel served in Europe, sometimes behind enemy lines, where they gathered nuclear materials and documents, and rounded up German scientists. Despite the Manhattan Project's tight security, Soviet [[atomic spies]] successfully penetrated the program.

The first nuclear device ever detonated was an implosion-type bomb at the [[Trinity test]], conducted at New Mexico's [[White Sands Missile Range|Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range]] on 16 July 1945. Little Boy and Fat Man bombs were used a month later in the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], respectively. In the immediate postwar years, the Manhattan Project conducted weapons testing at [[Bikini Atoll]] as part of [[Operation Crossroads]], developed new weapons, promoted the development of the network of [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|national laboratories]], supported medical research into [[radiology]] and laid the foundations for the [[nuclear navy]]. It maintained control over American atomic weapons research and production until the formation of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] in January 1947.

== Origins ==
The discovery of [[nuclear fission]] by German chemists [[Otto Hahn]] and [[Fritz Strassmann]] in 1938, and its theoretical explanation by [[Lise Meitner]] and [[Otto Frisch]], made the development of an [[atomic bomb]] a theoretical possibility. There were fears that a [[German atomic bomb project]] would develop one first, especially among scientists who were refugees from [[Nazi Germany]] and other [[fascist]] countries.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=12}} In August 1939, Hungarian-born physicists [[Leó Szilárd]] and [[Eugene Wigner]] drafted the [[Einstein–Szilárd letter]], which warned of the potential development of "extremely powerful bombs of a new type". It urged the United States to take steps to acquire stockpiles of [[uranium ore]] and accelerate the research of [[Enrico Fermi]] and others into [[nuclear chain reaction]]s. They had it signed by [[Albert Einstein]] and delivered to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt called on [[Lyman Briggs]] of the [[National Bureau of Standards]] to head the [[Advisory Committee on Uranium]] to investigate the issues raised by the letter. Briggs held a meeting on 21 October 1939, which was attended by Szilárd, Wigner and [[Edward Teller]]. The committee reported back to Roosevelt in November that uranium "would provide a possible source of bombs with a destructiveness vastly greater than anything now known."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=16–20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Advisory Committee on Uranium became the [[National Defense Research Committee]] (NDRC) Committee on Uranium when that organization was formed on 27 June 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rhodes|1986|pp=337–338}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Briggs proposed spending $167,000 on research into uranium, particularly the [[uranium-235]] isotope, and the recently discovered [[plutonium]].&lt;ref name="Hewlett&amp;Anderson, pp. 40-41" /&gt; On 28 June 1941, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8807, which created the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=16137 |title=Executive Order 8807 Establishing the Office of Scientific Research and Development |date=28 June 1941 |accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Vannevar Bush]] as its director. The office was empowered to engage in large engineering projects in addition to research.&lt;ref name="Hewlett&amp;Anderson, pp. 40-41"&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=40–41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The NDRC Committee on Uranium became the S-1 Section of the OSRD; the word "uranium" was dropped for security reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=33}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, Frisch and [[Rudolf Peierls]] at the [[University of Birmingham]] had made a breakthrough investigating the [[critical mass]] of uranium-235 in June 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rhodes|1986|pp=322–325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their calculations indicated that it was within an [[order of magnitude]] of {{convert|10|kg|lb|0}}, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day.&lt;ref name="Hewlett, p. 42"&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their March 1940 [[Frisch–Peierls memorandum]] initiated the British atomic bomb project and its [[Maud Committee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=39–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb.&lt;ref name="Hewlett, p. 42" /&gt; In July 1940, Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research,{{sfn|Phelps|2010|pp=126–128}} and the [[Tizard Mission]]'s [[John Cockcroft]] briefed American scientists on British developments. He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British, and not as far advanced.{{sfn|Phelps|2010|pp=282–283}}

As part of the scientific exchange, the Maud Committee's findings were conveyed to the United States. One of its members, the Australian physicist [[Mark Oliphant]], flew to the United States in late August 1941 and discovered that data provided by the Maud Committee had not reached key American physicists. Oliphant then set out to find out why the committee's findings were apparently being ignored. He met with the Uranium Committee and visited [[Berkeley, California]], where he spoke persuasively to [[Ernest O. Lawrence]]. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. He in turn spoke to [[James B. Conant]], [[Arthur H. Compton]] and [[George B. Pegram]]. Oliphant's mission was therefore a success; key American physicists were now aware of the potential power of an atomic bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rhodes|1986|pp=372–374}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=43–44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 October 1941, President Roosevelt approved the atomic program after he convened a meeting with Vannevar Bush and Vice President [[Henry A. Wallace]]. To control the program, he created a Top Policy Group consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]], and the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief of Staff of the Army]], [[General (United States)|General]] [[George C. Marshall]]. Roosevelt chose the Army to run the project rather than the Navy, because the Army had more experience with management of large-scale construction projects. He also agreed to coordinate the effort with that of the British, and on 11 October he sent a message to Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]], suggesting that they correspond on atomic matters.&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 30-32"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=30–32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compton]], [[Vannevar Bush]], [[James B. Conant]], [[Karl T. Compton]], and [[Alfred Lee Loomis|Alfred L. Loomis]]|alt=Six men in suits sitting on chairs, smiling and laughing]]
The S-1 Committee held its meeting on 18 December 1941 "pervaded by an atmosphere of enthusiasm and urgency"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the wake of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the subsequent [[United States declaration of war upon Japan]] and [[United States declaration of war upon Germany (1941)|then on Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Williams|1960|pp=3–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Work was proceeding on three different techniques for [[isotope separation]] to separate uranium-235 from the more abundant [[uranium-238]]. Lawrence and his team at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], investigated [[electromagnetic separation]], while [[Eger Murphree]] and [[Jesse Wakefield Beams]]'s team looked into [[gaseous diffusion]] at [[Columbia University]], and [[Philip Abelson]] directed research into [[Thermophoresis|thermal diffusion]] at the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] and later the [[Naval Research Laboratory]].&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 37-39" /&gt; Murphree was also the head of an unsuccessful separation project using [[gas centrifuge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|pp=32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, there were two lines of research into [[nuclear reactor technology]], with [[Harold Urey]] continuing research into [[heavy water]] at Columbia, while Arthur Compton brought the scientists working under his supervision from Columbia, California and [[Princeton University]] to join his team at the [[University of Chicago]], where he organized the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] in early 1942 to study plutonium and reactors using [[nuclear graphite|graphite]] as a [[neutron moderator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=35–36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Briggs, Compton, Lawrence, Murphree, and Urey met on 23 May 1942 to finalize the S-1 Committee recommendations, which called for all five technologies to be pursued. This was approved by Bush, Conant, and [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Wilhelm D. Styer]], the chief of staff of [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Brehon B. Somervell]]'s [[Services of Supply]], who had been designated the Army's representative on nuclear matters.&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 37-39" /&gt; Bush and Conant then took the recommendation to the Top Policy Group with a budget proposal for $54&amp;nbsp;million for construction by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], $31&amp;nbsp;million for research and development by OSRD and $5&amp;nbsp;million for contingencies in fiscal year 1943. The Top Policy Group in turn sent it to the President on 17 June 1942 and he approved it by writing "OK FDR" on the document.&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 37-39"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=37–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bomb design concepts ===
[[File:Los Alamos Primer assembly methods.png|thumb|upright|Different fission bomb assembly methods explored during the July 1942 conference|alt=A series of doodles]]
Compton asked theoretical physicist [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] of the University of California, Berkeley, to take over research into [[fast neutron calculations]]—the key to calculations of critical mass and weapon detonation—from [[Gregory Breit]], who had quit on 18 May 1942 because of concerns over lax operational security.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rhodes|1986|p=416}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John H. Manley]], a physicist at the Metallurgical Laboratory, was assigned to assist Oppenheimer by contacting and coordinating experimental physics groups scattered across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=103}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Oppenheimer and [[Robert Serber]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]] examined the problems of [[neutron]] diffusion—how neutrons moved in a nuclear chain reaction—and [[hydrodynamics]]—how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave. To review this work and the general theory of fission reactions, Oppenheimer and [[Fermi]] convened meetings at the University of Chicago in June and at the University of California, Berkeley, in July 1942 with theoretical physicists [[Hans Bethe]], [[John Van Vleck]], Edward Teller, [[Emil Konopinski]], Robert Serber, [[Stan Frankel]], and Eldred C. Nelson, the latter three former students of Oppenheimer, and [[experimental physicist]]s [[Emilio Segrè]], [[Felix Bloch]], [[Franco Rasetti]], [[John Henry Manley]], and [[Edwin McMillan]]. They tentatively confirmed that a fission bomb was theoretically possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=42–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were still many unknown factors. The properties of pure uranium-235 were relatively unknown, as were those of plutonium, an element that had only been discovered in February 1941 by [[Glenn Seaborg]] and his team. The scientists at the Berkeley conference envisioned creating plutonium in nuclear reactors where uranium-238 atoms absorbed neutrons that had been emitted from fissioning uranium-235 atoms. At this point no reactor had been built, and only tiny quantities of plutonium were available from [[cyclotron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=33–35}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even by December 1943, only two [[milligram]]s had been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There were many ways of arranging the fissile material into a critical mass. The simplest was shooting a "cylindrical plug" into a sphere of "active material" with a "tamper"—dense material that would focus neutrons inward and keep the reacting mass together to increase its efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Serber|Rhodes|1992|p=21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They also explored designs involving [[spheroid]]s, a primitive form of "[[implosion nuclear weapon|implosion]]" suggested by [[Richard C. Tolman]], and the possibility of [[autocatalysis|autocatalytic methods]], which would increase the efficiency of the bomb as it exploded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=54–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the idea of the fission bomb theoretically settled—at least until more experimental data was available—the Berkeley conference then turned in a different direction. Edward Teller pushed for discussion of a more powerful bomb: the "super", now usually referred to as a "[[hydrogen bomb]]", which would use the explosive force of a detonating fission bomb to ignite a [[nuclear fusion]] reaction in [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rhodes|1986|p=417}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Teller proposed scheme after scheme, but Bethe refused each one. The fusion idea was put aside to concentrate on producing fission bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teller also raised the speculative possibility that an atomic bomb might "ignite" the atmosphere because of a hypothetical fusion reaction of nitrogen nuclei.{{refn|The reaction Teller was most concerned with was: {{nuclide|nitrogen|14}} + {{nuclide|nitrogen|14}} → {{nuclide|magnesium|24}} + {{nuclide|helium|4}} (alpha particle) + 17.7 MeV.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bethe|1991|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} Bethe calculated that it could not happen,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rhodes|1986|p=419}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a report co-authored by Teller showed that "no self-propagating chain of nuclear reactions is likely to be started."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=Emil Konopinski |last=Konopinski |first=E.

It somehow got into a document that went to Washington" and was "never laid to rest".{{refn|In Bethe's account, the possibility of this ultimate catastrophe came up again in 1975 when it appeared in a magazine article by H.C. Dudley, who got the idea from a report by [[Pearl Buck]] of an interview she had with [[Arthur Compton]] in 1959. The worry was not entirely extinguished in some people's minds until the [[Trinity test]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bethe|1991|pp=xi, 30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}

== Organization ==

=== Manhattan District ===
The [[Chief of Engineers]], Major General [[Eugene Reybold]], selected [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[James C. Marshall]] to head the Army's part of the project in June 1942. Marshall created a liaison office in Washington, D.C., but established his temporary headquarters on the 18th floor of [[Tower 270|270 Broadway]] in New York, where he could draw on administrative support from the Corps of Engineers' [[North Atlantic Division]]. It was close to the Manhattan office of [[Stone &amp; Webster]], the principal project contractor, and to Columbia University. He had permission to draw on his former command, the Syracuse District, for staff, and he started with [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Kenneth Nichols]], who became his deputy.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news |last=Broad |first=William J. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/science/30manh.html |title=Why They Called It the Manhattan Project |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 41-44"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=41–44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manhttan Project Organization Chart.gif|thumb|left|Manhattan Project Organization Chart, 1 May 1946|alt=Organization chart of the project, showing project headquarters divisions at the top, Manhattan District in the middle, and field offices at the bottom]]
Because most of his task involved construction, Marshall worked in cooperation with the head of the Corps of Engineers Construction Division, Major General [[Thomas M. Robbins]], and his deputy, Colonel [[Leslie Groves]]. Reybold, Somervell, and Styer decided to call the project "Development of Substitute Materials", but Groves felt that this would draw attention. Since engineer districts normally carried the name of the city where they were located, Marshall and Groves agreed to name the Army's component of the project the Manhattan District. This became official on 13 August, when Reybold issued the order creating the new district. Informally, it was known as the Manhattan Engineer District, or MED. Unlike other districts, it had no geographic boundaries, and Marshall had the authority of a division engineer. Development of Substitute Materials remained as the official codename of the project as a whole, but was supplanted over time by "Manhattan".&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 41-44" /&gt;

Marshall later conceded that, "I had never heard of atomic fission but I did know that you could not build much of a plant, much less four of them for $90&amp;nbsp;million."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=652}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A single [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] plant that Nichols had recently built in Pennsylvania had cost $128&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=174}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nor were they impressed with estimates to the nearest order of magnitude, which Groves compared with telling a caterer to prepare for between ten and a thousand guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A survey team from Stone &amp; Webster had already scouted a site for the production plants. The [[War Production Board]] recommended sites around [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], an isolated area where the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] could supply ample electric power and the rivers could provide cooling water for the reactors. After examining several sites, the survey team selected one near [[Elza, Tennessee]]. Conant advised that it be acquired at once and Styer agreed but Marshall temporized, awaiting the results of Conant's reactor experiments before taking action.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=76–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the prospective processes, only Lawrence's electromagnetic separation appeared sufficiently advanced for construction to commence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=654}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall and Nichols began assembling the resources they would need. The first step was to obtain a high priority rating for the project. The top ratings were AA-1 through AA-4 in descending order, although there was also a special AAA rating reserved for emergencies. Ratings AA-1 and AA-2 were for essential weapons and equipment, so Colonel [[Lucius D. Clay]], the deputy chief of staff at Services and Supply for requirements and resources, felt that the highest rating he could assign was AA-3, although he was willing to provide a AAA rating on request for critical materials if the need arose.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=57–61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols and Marshall were disappointed; AA-3 was the same priority as Nichols' TNT plant in Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name="Fine 1972 657"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=657}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush became dissatisfied with Colonel Marshall's failure to get the project moving forward expeditiously, specifically the failure to acquire the Tennessee site, the low priority allocated to the project by the Army and the location of his headquarters in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=81}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bush felt that more aggressive leadership was required, and spoke to [[Harvey Bundy]] and Generals Marshall, Somervell, and Styer about his concerns. He wanted the project placed under a senior policy committee, with a prestigious officer, preferably Styer, as overall director.&lt;ref name="Fine 1972 657" /&gt;

Somervell and Styer selected Groves for the post, informing him on 17 September of this decision, and that General Marshall ordered that he be promoted to brigadier general,&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 74-77"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=74–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as it was felt that the title "general" would hold more sway with the academic scientists working on the Manhattan Project.&lt;ref name="Groves, pp. 4-5"&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=4–5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Groves' orders placed him directly under Somervell rather than Reybold, with Colonel Marshall now answerable to Groves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=659–661}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Groves established his headquarters in Washington, D.C., on the fifth floor of the [[Harry S. Truman Building|New War Department Building]], where Colonel Marshall had his liaison office.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=27–28}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He assumed command of the Manhattan Project on 23 September. Later that day, he attended a meeting called by Stimson, which established a Military Policy Committee, responsible to the Top Policy Group, consisting of Bush (with Conant as an alternate), Styer and [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[William R. Purnell]].&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 74-77" /&gt; Tolman and Conant were later appointed as Groves' scientific advisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=44–45}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 September, Groves went to [[Donald M. Nelson|Donald Nelson]], the chairman of the War Production Board, and asked for broad authority to issue a AAA rating whenever it was required. Nelson initially balked but quickly caved in when Groves threatened to go to the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=22–23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Groves promised not to use the AAA rating unless it was necessary. It soon transpired that for the routine requirements of the project the AAA rating was too high but the AA-3 rating was too low. After a long campaign, Groves finally received AA-1 authority on 1 July 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=80–82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Groves, "In Washington you became aware of the importance of top priority. Most everything proposed in the Roosevelt administration would have top priority. That would last for about a week or two and then something else would get top priority".{{sfn|Ermenc|1989|p=238}}

One of Groves' early problems was to find a director for [[Project Y]], the group that would design and build the bomb. The obvious choice was one of the three laboratory heads, Urey, Lawrence, or Compton, but they could not be spared. Compton recommended Oppenheimer, who was already intimately familiar with the bomb design concepts. However, Oppenheimer had little administrative experience, and, unlike Urey, Lawrence, and Compton, had not won a [[Nobel Prize]], which many scientists felt that the head of such an important laboratory should have. There were also concerns about Oppenheimer's security status, as many of his associates were [[Communism|Communists]], including his brother, [[Frank Oppenheimer]]; his wife, Kitty; and his girlfriend, [[Jean Tatlock]]. A long conversation on a train in October 1942 convinced Groves and Nichols that Oppenheimer thoroughly understood the issues involved in setting up a laboratory in a remote area and should be appointed as its director. Groves personally waived the security requirements and issued Oppenheimer a clearance on 20 July 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=61–63}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|pp=72–73}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collaboration with the United Kingdom ===
{{Main|British contribution to the Manhattan Project}}
The British and Americans exchanged nuclear information but did not initially combine their efforts. Britain rebuffed attempts by Bush and Conant in 1941 to strengthen cooperation with its own project, codenamed [[Tube Alloys]], because it was reluctant to share its technological lead and help the United States develop its own atomic bomb.&lt;ref name="Bernstein 1976 206–207"&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|1976|pp=206–207}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An American scientist who brought a personal letter from Roosevelt to Churchill offering to pay for all research and development in an Anglo-American project was poorly treated, and Churchill did not reply to the letter. The United States as a result decided as early as April 1942 that if its offer was rejected, they should proceed alone.&lt;ref name="villa1981"&gt;{{harvnb|Villa|1981|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British, who had made significant contributions early in the war, did not have the resources to carry through such a research program while fighting for their survival. As a result, Tube Alloys soon fell behind its American counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|1976|pp=206–208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 30 July 1942, Sir [[John Anderson, 1st Viscount Waverley|John Anderson]], the minister responsible for Tube Alloys, advised Churchill that: "We must face the fact that&amp;nbsp;... [our] pioneering work&amp;nbsp;... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger.' Soon we shall have little or none."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|1976|p=208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; That month Churchill and Roosevelt made an informal, unwritten agreement for atomic collaboration.{{r|stacey1970}}

[[File:Groves and Chadwick 830308.jpg|thumb|left|Groves confers with [[James Chadwick]], the head of the British Mission.|alt=A large man in uniform and a bespectacled thin man in a suit and tie sit at a desk.]]
The opportunity for an equal partnership no longer existed, however, as shown in August 1942 when the British unsuccessfully demanded substantial control over the project while paying none of the costs. By 1943 the roles of the two countries had reversed from late 1941;{{r|villa1981}} in January Conant notified the British that they would no longer receive atomic information except in certain areas. While the British were shocked by the abrogation of the Churchill-Roosevelt agreement, head of the Canadian [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] C. J. Mackenzie was less surprised, writing "I can't help feeling that the United Kingdom group [over] emphasizes the importance of their contribution as compared with the Americans."&lt;ref name="stacey1970"&gt;{{harvnb|Stacey|1970|p=517}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Conant and Bush told the British, the order came "from the top".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|1976|p=211}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British bargaining position had worsened; the American scientists had decided that the United States no longer needed outside help, and they wanted to prevent Britain exploiting post-war commercial applications of atomic energy. The committee supported, and Roosevelt agreed to, restricting the flow of information to what Britain could use during the war—especially not bomb design—even if doing so slowed down the American project. By early 1943 the British stopped sending research and scientists to America, and as a result the Americans stopped all information sharing. The British considered ending the supply of Canadian uranium and heavy water to force the Americans to again share, but Canada needed American supplies to produce them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|1976|pp=209–212}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They investigated the possibility of an independent nuclear program, but determined that it could not be ready in time to affect the outcome of the [[European Theatre of World War II|war in Europe]].&lt;ref name="fakley1983"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.atomicarchive.com/History/british/index.shtml |title=The British Mission |author=Fakley, Dennis C. |journal=Los Alamos Science |date=Winter–Spring 1983 |issue=7 |pp=186–189 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 1943 Conant decided that British help would benefit some areas of the project. [[James Chadwick]] and one or two other British scientists were important enough that the bomb design team at Los Alamos needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|1976|pp=213}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1943 Churchill and Roosevelt negotiated the [[Quebec Agreement]], which resulted in a resumption of cooperation&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gowing|1964|pp=168–173}}.&lt;/ref&gt; between scientists working on the same problem. Britain, however, agreed to restrictions on data on the building of large-scale production plants necessary for the bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|1976|pp=216–217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent Hyde Park Agreement in September 1944 extended this cooperation to the postwar period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gowing|1964|pp=340–342}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quebec Agreement established the [[Combined Policy Committee]] to coordinate the efforts of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. Stimson, Bush and Conant served as the American members of the Combined Policy Committee, Field Marshal Sir [[John Dill]] and Colonel [[John Jestyn Llewellin, 1st Baron Llewellin|J. J. Llewellin]] were the British members, and [[C. D. Howe]] was the Canadian member.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=296}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Llewellin returned to the United Kingdom at the end of 1943 and was replaced on the committee by Sir [[Ronald Ian Campbell]], who in turn was replaced by the British Ambassador to the United States, [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], in early 1945. Sir John Dill died in Washington, D.C., in November 1944 and was replaced both as Chief of the [[British Defence Staff – US|British Joint Staff Mission]] and as a member of the Combined Policy Committee by Field Marshal Sir [[Henry Maitland Wilson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gowing|1964|p=234}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When cooperation resumed after the Quebec agreement, the Americans' progress and expenditures amazed the British. The United States had already spent more than $1 billion (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US-GDP|1000000000|1943|r=-8}}}} today), while in 1943, the United Kingdom had spent about £0.5 million. Chadwick thus pressed for British involvement in the Manhattan Project to the fullest extent and abandon any hopes of a British project during the war.{{r|fakley1983}} With Churchill's backing, he attempted to ensure that every request from Groves for assistance was honored.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gowing|1964|pp=242–244}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Mission that arrived in the United States in December 1943 included [[Niels Bohr]], Otto Frisch, [[Klaus Fuchs]], Rudolf Peierls, and [[Ernest William Titterton|Ernest Titterton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunner|2004|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; More scientists arrived in early 1944. While those assigned to gaseous diffusion left by the fall of 1944, the 35 working with Lawrence at Berkeley were assigned to existing laboratory groups and stayed until the end of the war. The 19 sent to Los Alamos also joined existing groups, primarily related to implosion and bomb assembly, but not the plutonium-related ones.{{r|fakley1983}} Part of the Quebec Agreement specified that nuclear weapons would not be used against another country without mutual consent. In June 1945, Wilson agreed that the use of nuclear weapons against Japan would be recorded as a decision of the Combined Policy Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gowing|1964|p=372}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Combined Policy Committee created the [[Combined Development Trust]] in June 1944, with Groves as its chairman, to procure uranium and [[thorium#Occurrence|thorium ores]] on international markets. The [[Belgian Congo]] and Canada held much of the world's uranium outside Eastern Europe, and the [[Belgian Government in Exile|Belgian government in exile]] was in London. Britain agreed to give the United States most of the Belgian ore, as it could not use most of the supply without restricted American research.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bernstein|1976|pp=223–224}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the Trust purchased {{convert|3440000|lb|kg}} of uranium oxide ore from companies operating mines in the Belgian Congo. In order to avoid briefing US Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]] on the project, a special account not subject to the usual auditing and controls was used to hold Trust monies. Between 1944 and the time he resigned from the Trust in 1947, Groves deposited a total of $37.5&amp;nbsp;million into the Trust's account.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=90, 299–306}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Groves appreciated the early British atomic research and the British scientists' contributions to the Manhattan Project, but stated that the United States would have succeeded without them.{{r|fakley1983}} He also said that Churchill was "the best friend the atomic bomb project had [as] he kept Roosevelt's interest up ... He just stirred him up all the time by telling him how important he thought the project was."{{sfn|Ermenc|1989|p=238}}

The British wartime participation was crucial to the success of the United Kingdom's [[High Explosive Research|independent nuclear weapons program]] after the war when the [[McMahon Act]] of 1946 temporarily ended American nuclear cooperation.{{r|fakley1983}}

The day after he took over the project, Groves took a train to Tennessee with Colonel Marshall to inspect the proposed site there, and Groves was impressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=116–117}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=25–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 September 1942, [[United States Under Secretary of War]] [[Robert P.

About 1,000 families were affected by the condemnation order, which came into effect on 7 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=78}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Protests, legal appeals, and a 1943 Congressional inquiry were to no avail.&lt;ref name="Johnson &amp; Jackson, pp. 39-43"&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Jackson|1981|pp=39–43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-November [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] were tacking notices to vacate on farmhouse doors, and construction contractors were moving in.&lt;ref name="Fine&amp;Remington, pp. 663-664"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=663–664}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some families were given two weeks' notice to vacate farms that had been their homes for generations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oak Ridge National Laboratory Review, Vol. 25, Nos. 3 and 4, 2002 |url=http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev25-34/chapter1.shtml |publisher=ornl.gov |accessdate=9 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825162412/http://www.ornl.gov/info/ornlreview/rev25-34/chapter1.shtml |archivedate=25 August 2009 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; others had settled there after being evicted to make way for the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] in the 1920s or the [[Norris Dam]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Johnson &amp; Jackson, pp. 39-43" /&gt; The ultimate cost of land acquisition in the area, which was not completed until March 1945, was only about $2.6&amp;nbsp;million, which worked out to around $47 an acre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=327–328}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When presented with Public Proclamation Number Two, which declared Oak Ridge a total exclusion area that no one could enter without military permission, the [[Governor of Tennessee]], [[Prentice Cooper]], angrily tore it up.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Jackson|1981|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially known as the Kingston Demolition Range, the site was officially renamed the [[Clinton Engineer Works]] (CEW) in early 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|Jackson|1981|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Stone &amp; Webster concentrated on the production facilities, the architectural and engineering firm [[Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill]] designed and built a residential community for 13,000.

=== Los Alamos ===
{{Main|Project Y}}
{{Wikisource|Los Alamos Ranch School Seizure Letter}}
The idea of locating Project Y at Oak Ridge was considered, but in the end it was decided that it should be in a remote location. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search for a suitable site was narrowed to the vicinity of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], where Oppenheimer owned a ranch. In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Project was sent to survey the area, and he recommended a site near [[Jemez Springs, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=83–84}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers were concerned with the possibility of flooding. The party then moved on to the vicinity of the [[Los Alamos Ranch School]]. Oppenheimer was impressed and expressed a strong preference for the site, citing its natural beauty and views of the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]], which, it was hoped, would inspire those who would work on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|pp=664–665}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lanl.gov/history/road/school-arsenal.shtml |publisher=Los Alamos National Laboratory |title=50th Anniversary Article: Oppenheimer's Better Idea: Ranch School Becomes Arsenal of Democracy |accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The engineers were concerned about the poor access road, and whether the water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that it was ideal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=66–67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Patterson approved the acquisition of the site on 25 November 1942, authorizing $440,000 for the purchase of the site of {{convert|54000|acre|ha}}, all but {{convert|8900|acre|ha}} of which were already owned by the Federal Government.&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 328-331" /&gt; [[Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Claude R.

M. Sundt Company of [[Tucson, Arizona]], with [[Willard C. Kruger and Associates]] of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], as architect and engineer. Work commenced in December 1942. Groves initially allocated $300,000 for construction, three times Oppenheimer's estimate, with a planned completion date of 15 March 1943. It soon became clear that the scope of Project Y was greater than expected, and by the time Sundt finished on 30 November 1943, over $7&amp;nbsp;million had been spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunner|2004|pp=31–32}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Los Alamos map.gif|thumb|upright=1.6|Map of Los Alamos site, New Mexico, 1943–45]]

Oppenheimer went so far as to order himself a lieutenant colonel's uniform, but two key physicists, [[Robert Bacher]] and [[Isidor Rabi]], balked at the idea. Conant, Groves and Oppenheimer then devised a compromise whereby the laboratory was operated by the University of California under contract to the War Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=230–232}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chicago ===
{{Main|Metallurgical Laboratory}}
An Army-OSRD council on 25 June 1942 decided to build a [[pilot plant]] for plutonium production in [[Red Gate Woods]] southwest of Chicago. In July, Nichols arranged for a lease of {{convert|1025|acre|ha}} from the [[Cook County Forest Preserve District]], and Captain James F. Grafton was appointed Chicago area engineer. It soon became apparent that the scale of operations was too great for the area, and it was decided to build the plant at Oak Ridge, and keep a research and testing facility in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=67–71}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Red Gate Woods" /&gt;

Delays in establishing the plant in Red Gate Woods led Compton to authorize the Metallurgical Laboratory to construct the first nuclear reactor beneath the [[bleacher]]s of [[Stagg Field]] at the University of Chicago. The reactor required an enormous amount of [[graphite]] blocks and uranium pellets. At the time, there was a limited source of pure [[uranium]]. [[Frank Spedding]] of [[Iowa State University]] were able to produce only two [[short ton]]s of pure uranium. Additional three short tons of uranium metal was supplied by [[Westinghouse Lamp Plant]] which was produced in a rush with makeshift process. A large square balloon was constructed by [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear Tire]] to encase the reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=FRONTIERS Research Highlights 1946–1996|publisher=Officeof PublicAffairs, ArgonneNational Laboratory|page=11|osti=770687|doi=10.2172/770687|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walsh|first=John|title=A Manhattan Project Postscript|journal=Science|date=19 June 1981|volume=212|pp=1369–1371|url=http://pbadupws.nrc.gov/docs/ML0533/ML053340429.pdf|accessdate=23 March 2013|issn=0036-8075|doi=10.1126/science.212.4501.1369|pmid=17746246|issue=4501|bibcode= 1981Sci...212.1369W}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 December 1942, a team led by Enrico Fermi initiated the first artificial{{refn|[[Natural nuclear fission reactor|Natural self-sustaining nuclear reactions]] have occurred in the distant past.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Libby|1979|pp=214–216}}.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction in an experimental reactor known as [[Chicago Pile-1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CP-1 (Chicago Pile 1 Reactor)|url=http://www.ne.anl.gov/About/reactors/early-reactors.shtml|publisher=Argonne National Laboratory; U.S. Department of Energy|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The point at which a reaction becomes self-sustaining became known as "going critical".

In January 1943, Grafton's successor, Major Arthur V.

=== Hanford ===
{{Main|Hanford Site}}
By December 1942 there were concerns that even Oak Ridge was too close to a major population center (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited [[DuPont]] in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard [[cost-plus contract|cost plus fixed-fee contract]], but the President of the company, [[Walter S. Carpenter, Jr.]], wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=58–59}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hanford workers.jpg|thumb|Hanford workers collect their paychecks at the Western Union office.|alt=A large crowd of sullen looking workmen at a counter where two women are writing. Some of the workmen are wearing identify photographs of themselves on their hats.]]
DuPont recommended that the site be located far from the existing uranium production facility at Oak Ridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=68–69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1942, Groves dispatched Colonel [[Franklin Matthias]] and DuPont engineers to scout potential sites. Matthias reported that [[Hanford Site]] near [[Richland, Washington]], was "ideal in virtually all respects". It was isolated and near the [[Columbia River]], which could supply sufficient water to cool the reactors that would produce the plutonium. Groves visited the site in January and established the Hanford Engineer Works (HEW), codenamed "Site W".&lt;ref name="Jones 1987 108–111" /&gt;

Under Secretary Patterson gave his approval on 9 February, allocating $5&amp;nbsp;million for the acquisition of {{convert|40000|acre|ha}} of land in the area. The federal government relocated some 1,500 residents of [[White Bluffs, Washington|White Bluffs]] and [[Hanford, Washington|Hanford]], and nearby settlements, as well as the [[Wanapum]] and other tribes using the area. A dispute arose with farmers over compensation for crops, which had already been planted before the land was acquired. Where schedules allowed, the Army allowed the crops to be harvested, but this was not always possible.&lt;ref name="Jones 1987 108–111"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=108–111}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The land acquisition process dragged on and was not completed before the end of the Manhattan Project in December 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=342}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute did not delay work. Although progress on the reactor design at Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont was not sufficiently advanced to accurately predict the scope of the project, a start was made in April 1943 on facilities for an estimated 25,000 workers, half of whom were expected to live on-site. By July 1944, some 1,200 buildings had been erected and nearly 51,000 people were living in the construction camp. As area engineer, Matthias exercised overall control of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=452–457}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak, the construction camp was the third most populous town in Washington state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thayer|1996|p=16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Hanford operated a fleet of over 900 buses, more than the city of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=401}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Los Alamos and Oak Ridge, Richland was a gated community with restricted access, but it looked more like a typical wartime American boomtown: the military profile was lower, and physical security elements like high fences, towers, and guard dogs were less evident.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=463–464}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canadian sites ===
{{Main|Montreal Laboratory}}

==== British Columbia ====
[[Cominco]] had produced electrolytic hydrogen at [[Trail, British Columbia]], since 1930. Urey suggested in 1941 that it could produce heavy water. To the existing $10&amp;nbsp;million plant consisting of 3,215 cells consuming 75&amp;nbsp;MW of hydroelectric power, secondary electrolysis cells were added to increase the deuterium concentration in the water from 2.3% to 99.8%. For this process, Hugh Taylor of Princeton developed a platinum-on-carbon [[catalyst]] for the first three stages while Urey developed a nickel-[[chromium(III) oxide|chromia]] one for the fourth stage tower. The final cost was $2.8&amp;nbsp;million. The Canadian Government did not officially learn of the project until August 1942. Trail's heavy water production started in January 1944 and continued until 1956. Heavy water from Trail was used for [[Chicago Pile 3]], the first reactor using heavy water and natural uranium, which went critical on 15 May 1944.&lt;ref name="Waltham, pp. 8-9"&gt;{{harvnb|Waltham|2002|pp=8–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ontario ====
The [[Chalk River Laboratories|Chalk River, Ontario]], site was established to rehouse the Allied effort at the [[Montreal Laboratory]] away from an urban area. A new community was built at [[Deep River, Ontario]], to provide residences and facilities for the team members. The site was chosen for its proximity to the industrial manufacturing area of Ontario and Quebec, and proximity to a rail head adjacent to a large military base, [[Camp Petawawa]]. Located on the Ottawa River, it had access to abundant water. The first director of the new laboratory was [[Hans von Halban]]. He was replaced by John Cockcroft in May 1944, who in turn was succeeded by [[Bennett Lewis]] in September 1946. A pilot reactor known as [[ZEEP]] (zero-energy experimental pile) became the first Canadian reactor, and the first to be completed outside the United States, when it went critical in September 1945, ZEEP remained in use by researchers until 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/whatson/zeep.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306233719/http://www.sciencetech.technomuses.ca/english/whatson/zeep.cfm |archivedate=6 March 2014 |title=ZEEP – Canada's First Nuclear Reactor |publisher=Canada Science and Technology Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; A larger 10&amp;nbsp;MW [[NRX]] reactor, which was designed during the war, was completed and went critical in July 1947.&lt;ref name="Waltham, pp. 8-9" /&gt;

==== Northwest Territories ====
The [[Eldorado Mine (Northwest Territories)|Eldorado Mine]] at [[Port Radium]] was a source of uranium ore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=8, 62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heavy water sites ===
{{Main|P-9 Project}}
Although DuPont's preferred designs for the nuclear reactors were helium cooled and used graphite as a moderator, DuPont still expressed an interest in using heavy water as a backup, in case the graphite reactor design proved infeasible for some reason. For this purpose, it was estimated that {{convert|3|ST}} of heavy water would be required per month. The ''[[P-9 Project]]'' was the government's code name for the heavy water production program. As the plant at Trail, which was then under construction, could produce {{convert|0.5|ST}} per month, additional capacity was required. Groves therefore authorized DuPont to establish heavy water facilities at the Morgantown Ordnance Works, near [[Morgantown, West Virginia]]; at the [[Newport Chemical Depot|Wabash River Ordnance Works]], near [[Dana, Indiana|Dana]] and [[Newport, Indiana]]; and at the [[Alabama Army Ammunition Plant|Alabama Ordnance Works]], near [[Childersburg, Alabama|Childersburg]] and [[Sylacauga, Alabama]]. Although known as Ordnance Works and paid for under [[Ordnance Department]] contracts, they were built and operated by the Army Corps of Engineers. The American plants used a process different from Trail's; heavy water was extracted by distillation, taking advantage of the slightly higher boiling point of heavy water.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=107–108}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=201–202}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uranium ==
=== Ore ===
The key raw material for the project was uranium, which was used as fuel for the reactors, as feed that was transformed into plutonium, and, in its enriched form, in the atomic bomb itself. There were four known major deposits of uranium in 1940: in Colorado, in northern Canada, in [[Joachimsthal]] in Czechoslovakia, and in the [[Belgian Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; All but Joachimstal were in allied hands. A November 1942 survey determined that sufficient quantities of uranium were available to satisfy the project's requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nichols arranged with the [[State Department]] for export controls to be placed on [[uranium oxide]] and negotiated for the purchase of {{convert|1200|ST}} of uranium ore from the Belgian Congo that was being stored in a warehouse on [[Staten Island]] and the remaining stocks of mined ore stored in the Congo. He negotiated with [[Eldorado Mining and Refining|Eldorado Gold Mines]] for the purchase of ore from its refinery in Port Hope, Ontario, and its shipment in 100-ton lots. The Canadian government subsequently bought up the company's stock until it acquired a controlling interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=85–86}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While these purchases assured a sufficient supply to meet wartime needs, the American and British leaders concluded that it was in their countries' interest to gain control of as much of the world's uranium deposits as possible. The richest source of ore was the [[Shinkolobwe]] mine in the Belgian Congo, but it was flooded and closed. Nichols unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate its reopening and the sale of the entire future output to the United States with [[Edgar Sengier]], the director of the company that owned the mine, [[Union Minière du Haut Katanga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=295}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The matter was then taken up by the Combined Policy Committee. As 30 percent of Union Minière's stock was controlled by British interests, the British took the lead in negotiations. Sir John Anderson and Ambassador [[John Winant]] hammered out a deal with Sengier and the Belgian government in May 1944 for the mine to be reopened and {{convert|1720|ST}} of ore to be purchased at $1.45 a pound.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=285–288}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid dependence on the British and Canadians for ore, Groves also arranged for the purchase of US Vanadium Corporation's stockpile in [[Uravan, Colorado]]. [[Uranium mining in Colorado]] yielded about {{convert|800|ST}} of ore.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=291–292}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mallinckrodt Incorporated]] in St. Louis, Missouri, took the raw ore and dissolved it in [[nitric acid]] to produce [[uranyl nitrate]]. [[Ether]] was then added in a [[liquid–liquid extraction]] process to separate the impurities from the uranyl nitrate. This was then heated to form [[uranium trioxide]], which was reduced to highly pure [[uranium dioxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruhoff|Fain|1962|pp=3–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1942, Mallinckrodt was producing a ton of highly pure oxide a day, but turning this into uranium metal initially proved more difficult for contractors [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse]] and Metal Hydrides.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production was too slow and quality was unacceptably low. A special branch of the Metallurgical Laboratory was established at [[Iowa State College]] in [[Ames, Iowa]], under Frank Spedding to investigate alternatives. This became known as the [[Ames Project]], and its [[Ames process]] became available in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=87–88}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isotope separation ===
Natural uranium consists of 99.3% uranium-238 and 0.7% uranium-235, but only the latter is [[fissile]]. The chemically identical uranium-235 has to be physically separated from the more plentiful isotope. Various methods were considered for [[uranium enrichment]], most of which was carried out at Oak Ridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|pp=154–156}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most obvious technology, the centrifuge, failed, but electromagnetic separation, gaseous diffusion, and thermal diffusion technologies were all successful and contributed to the project. In February 1943, Groves came up with the idea of using the output of some plants as the input for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=157}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clinton Engineer Works.png|thumb|center|upright=3.2|Oak Ridge hosted several uranium separation technologies. The Y-12 electromagnetic separation plant is in the upper right.

There is a river to the south, while the township is in the north.]]

==== Centrifuges ====
The centrifuge process was regarded as the only promising separation method in April 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=22–23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jesse Beams]] had developed such a process at the [[University of Virginia]] during the 1930s, but had encountered technical difficulties. The process required high rotational speeds, but at certain speeds harmonic vibrations developed that threatened to tear the machinery apart. It was therefore necessary to accelerate quickly through these speeds. In 1941 he began working with [[uranium hexafluoride]], the only known gaseous compound of uranium, and was able to separate uranium-235. At Columbia, Urey had Karl Cohen investigate the process, and he produced a body of mathematical theory making it possible to design a centrifugal separation unit, which Westinghouse undertook to construct.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=30}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scaling this up to a production plant presented a formidable technical challenge. Urey and Cohen estimated that producing a kilogram (2.2&amp;nbsp;lb) of uranium-235 per day would require up to 50,000 centrifuges with {{convert|1|m|adj=on|sp=us}} rotors, or 10,000 centrifuges with {{convert|4|m|adj=on|sp=us}} rotors, assuming that 4-meter rotors could be built. The prospect of keeping so many rotors operating continuously at high speed appeared daunting,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and when Beams ran his experimental apparatus, he obtained only 60% of the predicted yield, indicating that more centrifuges would be required. Beams, Urey and Cohen then began work on a series of improvements which promised to increase the efficiency of the process. However, frequent failures of motors, shafts and bearings at high speeds delayed work on the pilot plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=96–97}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1942 the centrifuge process was abandoned by the Military Policy Committee following a recommendation by Conant, Nichols and August C. Klein of Stone &amp; Webster.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Electromagnetic separation ====
{{Main|Y-12 Project}}
Electromagnetic isotope separation was developed by Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. This method employed devices known as [[calutron]]s, a hybrid of the standard laboratory [[mass spectrometer]] and cyclotron. The name was derived from the words ''California'', ''university'' and ''cyclotron''.&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 117-119"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=117–119}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the electromagnetic process, a magnetic field deflected charged particles according to mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|pp=164–165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient.&lt;ref name="Fine &amp; Remington, p. 684"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|Remington|1972|p=684}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and rapidly reach industrial capacity.&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 117-119" /&gt;

[[File:Alpha 1 racetrack, Uranium 235 electromagnetic separation plant, Manhattan Project, Y-12 Oak Ridge.jpg|thumb|left|Alpha I racetrack at Y-12|alt=A large oval-shaped structure]]
Marshall and Nichols discovered that the electromagnetic isotope separation process would require {{convert|5000|ST|abbr=off}} of copper, which was in desperately short supply. However, silver could be substituted, in an 11:10 ratio. On 3 August 1942, Nichols met with [[United States Deputy Secretary of the Treasury|Under Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Daniel W. Bell]] and asked for the transfer of 6,000 tons of silver bullion from the [[West Point Bullion Depository]]. "Young man," Bell told him, "you may think of silver in tons but the Treasury will always think of silver in [[troy ounce]]s!"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, {{convert|14700|ST|t ozt|abbr=off}} were used.&lt;ref name="Jones, p. 133" /&gt;

The {{convert|1000|ozt|kg|adj=on}} silver bars were cast into cylindrical billets and taken to [[Phelps Dodge]] in Bayway, New Jersey, where they were extruded into strips {{convert|0.625|in}} thick, {{convert|3|in}} wide and {{convert|40|ft}} long. These were wound onto magnetic coils by [[Allis-Chalmers]] in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After the war, all the machinery was dismantled and cleaned and the floorboards beneath the machinery were ripped up and burned to recover minute amounts of silver. In the end, only 1/3,600,000th was lost.&lt;ref name="Jones, p. 133"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=133}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=153}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The last silver was returned in May 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Responsibility for the design and construction of the electromagnetic separation plant, which came to be called [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12]], was assigned to Stone &amp; Webster by the S-1 Committee in June 1942. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. Construction began in February 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=126–132}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because of the power of the magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.&lt;ref name="Fine &amp; Remington, p. 684" /&gt; The second Alpha I was not operational until the end of January 1944, the first Beta and first and third Alpha I's came online in March, and the fourth Alpha I was operational in April. The four Alpha II racetracks were completed between July and October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=138–139}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Y12 Calutron Operators.jpg|thumb|[[Calutron Girls]] were young women who monitored calutron control panels at Y-12.

[[Tennessee Eastman]] was contracted to manage Y-12 on the usual cost plus fixed-fee basis, with a fee of $22,500 per month plus $7,500 per racetrack for the first seven racetracks and $4,000 per additional racetrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The calutrons were initially operated by scientists from Berkeley to remove bugs and achieve a reasonable operating rate. They were then turned over to trained Tennessee Eastman operators who had only a high school education. Nichols compared unit production data, and pointed out to Lawrence that the young "[[hillbilly]]" girl operators were outperforming his PhDs. They agreed to a production race and Lawrence lost, a morale boost for the Tennessee Eastman workers and supervisors. The girls were "trained like soldiers not to reason why", while "the scientists could not refrain from time-consuming investigation of the cause of even minor fluctuations of the dials."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=131}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Y-12 initially enriched the uranium-235 content to between 13% and 15%, and shipped the first few hundred grams of this to Los Alamos in March 1944. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the uranium feed emerged as final product. Much of the rest was splattered over equipment in the process. Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10% of the uranium-235 feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4%) feed from the new S-50 thermal diffusion plant. The next month it received enhanced (5%) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By August K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=143–148}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gaseous diffusion ====
{{Main|K-25}}
The most promising but also the most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. [[Graham's law]] states that the rate of [[effusion]] of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its [[molecular mass]], so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, [[Karl P. Cohen]], and [[John R. Dunning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=30–32, 96–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:K-25 aerial view.jpg|thumb|left|Oak Ridge K-25 plant|alt=Oblique aerial view of an enormous U-shaped building]]
In November 1942 the Military Policy Committee approved the construction of a 600-stage gaseous diffusion plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=108}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 December, [[M. W. Kellogg]] accepted an offer to construct the plant, which was codenamed K-25. A cost plus fixed-fee contract was negotiated, eventually totaling $2.5&amp;nbsp;million. A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project, headed by Percival C. Keith, one of Kellogg's vice presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=150–151}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The process faced formidable technical difficulties. The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride would have to be used, as no substitute could be found, and the motors and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas. The biggest problem was the design of the barrier, which would have to be strong, porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride. The best choice for this seemed to be nickel. Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel. A six-stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process, but the Norris-Adler prototype proved to be too brittle. A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex, the [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] and the [[Bakelite]] Corporation. In January 1944, Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=154–157}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=126–127}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kellex's design for K-25 called for a four-story {{convert|0.5|mi|km|adj=on|sp=us}} long U-shaped structure containing 54 contiguous buildings. These were divided into nine sections. Within these were cells of six stages. The cells could be operated independently, or consecutively within a section. Similarly, the sections could be operated separately or as part of a single cascade. A survey party began construction by marking out the {{convert|500|acre|km2|adj=on}} site in May 1943. Work on the main building began in October 1943, and the six-stage pilot plant was ready for operation on 17 April 1944. In 1945 Groves canceled the upper stages of the plant, directing Kellex to instead design and build a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27. Kellex transferred the last unit to the operating contractor, [[Union Carbide]] and Carbon, on 11 September 1945. The total cost, including the K-27 plant completed after the war, came to $480&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=158–165}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The production plant commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, the quality of the product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment and the output of the S-50 thermal diffusion plant began being used as feed. Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7% enrichment. In August, the last of the 2,892 stages commenced operation. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other production plants and became the prototypes for a new generation of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=167–171}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thermal diffusion ====
{{Main|S-50 Project}}
The thermal diffusion process was based on [[Sydney Chapman (mathematician)|Sydney Chapman]] and [[David Enskog]]'s [[Chapman–Enskog theory|theory]], which explained that when a mixed gas passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter one at the warm end. Since hot gases tend to rise and cool ones tend to fall, this can be used as a means of isotope separation. This process was first demonstrated by [[Klaus Clusius]] and Gerhard Dickel in Germany in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|pp=161–162}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed by US Navy scientists, but was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project. This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=172}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:S50plant.jpg|thumb|The S-50 plant is the dark building to the upper left behind the Oak Ridge powerhouse (with smoke stacks).|alt=A factory with three smoking chimneys on a river bend, viewed from above]]
The Naval Research Laboratory continued the research under Philip Abelson's direction, but there was little contact with the Manhattan Project until April 1944, when [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William S. Parsons]], the naval officer in charge of ordnance development at Los Alamos, brought Oppenheimer news of encouraging progress in the Navy's experiments on thermal diffusion. Oppenheimer wrote to Groves suggesting that the output of a thermal diffusion plant could be fed into Y-12. Groves set up a committee consisting of [[Warren K. Lewis]], Eger Murphree and Richard Tolman to investigate the idea, and they estimated that a thermal diffusion plant costing $3.5&amp;nbsp;million could enrich {{convert|50|kg|lb|0}} of uranium per week to nearly 0.9% uranium-235. Groves approved its construction on 24 June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=175–177}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Groves contracted with the H. K. Ferguson Company of [[Cleveland, Ohio]], to build the thermal diffusion plant, which was designated S-50. Groves's advisers, Karl Cohen and W. I. Thompson from [[Esso|Standard Oil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=170–172}}.&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that it would take six months to build. Groves gave Ferguson just four. Plans called for the installation of 2,142 {{convert|48|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} diffusion columns arranged in 21 racks. Inside each column were three concentric tubes. Steam, obtained from the nearby K-25 powerhouse at a pressure of {{convert|1000|psi}} and temperature of {{convert|545|F|C}}, flowed downward through the innermost {{convert|1.25|in|adj=on}} nickel pipe, while water at {{convert|155|F|C}} flowed upward through the outermost iron pipe. Isotope separation occurred in the uranium hexafluoride gas between the nickel and copper pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=178–179}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Work commenced on 9 July 1944, and S-50 began partial operation in September. Ferguson operated the plant through a subsidiary known as Fercleve. The plant produced just {{convert|10.5|lb}} of 0.852% uranium-235 in October. Leaks limited production and forced shutdowns over the next few months, but in June 1945 it produced {{convert|12730|lb}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=180–183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By March 1945, all 21 production racks were operating. Initially the output of S-50 was fed into Y-12, but starting in March 1945 all three enrichment processes were run in series. S-50 became the first stage, enriching from 0.71% to 0.89%. This material was fed into the gaseous diffusion process in the K-25 plant, which produced a product enriched to about 23%. This was, in turn, fed into Y-12,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=300–302}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which boosted it to about 89%, sufficient for nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name="Hansen, p. 112"&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|1995b|p=V-112}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aggregate U-235 production ===
About {{convert|50|kg}} of uranium enriched to 89% uranium-235 was delivered to Los Alamos by July 1945.&lt;ref name="Hansen, p. 112" /&gt; The entire 50&amp;nbsp;kg, along with some 50%-enriched, averaging out to about 85% enriched, were used in [[Little Boy]].&lt;ref name="Hansen, p. 112" /&gt;

== Plutonium ==
The second line of development pursued by the Manhattan Project used the fissile element plutonium. Although small amounts of plutonium exist in nature, the best way to obtain large quantities of the element is in a nuclear reactor, in which natural uranium is bombarded by neutrons. The uranium-238 is [[nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] into [[uranium-239]], which rapidly decays, first into [[neptunium-239]] and then into [[plutonium-239]].&lt;ref name="Smyth, pp. 130-132" /&gt; Only a small amount of the uranium-238 will be transformed, so the plutonium must be chemically separated from the remaining uranium, from any initial impurities, and from [[fission products]].&lt;ref name="Smyth, pp. 130-132"&gt;{{harvnb|Smyth|1945|pp=130–132}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== X-10 Graphite Reactor ===
{{Main|X-10 Graphite Reactor}}
[[File:X10 Reactor Face.jpg|thumb|Workers load uranium slugs into the X-10 Graphite Reactor.|alt=Two workmen on a movable platform similar to that used by window washers, stick a rod into one of many small holes in the wall in front of them.]]
In March 1943, DuPont began construction of a plutonium plant on a {{convert|112|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} site at Oak Ridge. Intended as a pilot plant for the larger production facilities at Hanford, it included the air-cooled [[X-10 Graphite Reactor]], a chemical separation plant, and support facilities. Because of the subsequent decision to construct water-cooled reactors at Hanford, only the chemical separation plant operated as a true pilot.&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 204-206"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=204–206}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The X-10 Graphite Reactor consisted of a huge block of graphite, {{convert|24|ft|m}} long on each side, weighing around {{convert|1500|ST}}, surrounded by {{convert|7|ft|m}} of high-density concrete as a radiation shield.&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 204-206" /&gt;

The greatest difficulty was encountered with the uranium slugs produced by Mallinckrodt and Metal Hydrides. These somehow had to be coated in aluminum to avoid corrosion and the escape of fission products into the cooling system. The Grasselli Chemical Company attempted to develop a [[tinning#Hot-dipping|hot dipping process]] without success. Meanwhile, [[Alcoa]] tried canning. A new process for flux-less welding was developed, and 97% of the cans passed a standard vacuum test, but high temperature tests indicated a failure rate of more than 50%. Nonetheless, production began in June 1943. The Metallurgical Laboratory eventually developed an improved welding technique with the help of [[General Electric]], which was incorporated into the production process in October 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=208–210}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Watched by Fermi and Compton, the X-10 Graphite Reactor went critical on 4 November 1943 with about {{convert|30|ST}} of uranium. A week later the load was increased to {{convert|36|ST}}, raising its power generation to 500&amp;nbsp;kW, and by the end of the month the first 500&amp;nbsp;mg of plutonium was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=211}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Modifications over time raised the power to 4,000&amp;nbsp;kW in July 1944. X-10 operated as a production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities.&lt;ref name="Jones 1985 209"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=209}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hanford reactors ===
{{Main|Hanford Site}}
Although an air-cooled design was chosen for the reactor at Oak Ridge to facilitate rapid construction, it was recognized that this would be impractical for the much larger production reactors. Initial designs by the Metallurgical Laboratory and DuPont used helium for cooling, before they determined that a water-cooled reactor would be simpler, cheaper and quicker to build.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=78–82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The design did not become available until 4 October 1943; in the meantime, Matthias concentrated on improving the Hanford Site by erecting accommodations, improving the roads, building a railway switch line, and upgrading the electricity, water and telephone lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=210}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As at Oak Ridge, the most difficulty was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944. They were [[pickling (metal)|pickled]] to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and [[silumin|aluminum-silicon alloy]], canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using [[arc welding]] under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they were subjected to a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output of only a handful of canned slugs per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs would be available to start [[B-Reactor|Reactor B]] on schedule in August 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=222–226}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Work began on Reactor B, the first of six planned 250&amp;nbsp;MW reactors, on 10 October 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thayer|1996|p=139}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The reactor complexes were given letter designations A through F, with B, D and F sites chosen to be developed first, as this maximised the distance between the reactors. They would be the only ones constructed during the Manhattan Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanford Cultural and Historic Resources Program|2002|p=1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some {{convert|390|ST}} of steel, {{convert|17400|cuyd}} of concrete, 50,000 concrete blocks and 71,000 concrete bricks were used to construct the {{convert|120|ft|m|adj=on}} high building.

Construction of the reactor itself commenced in February 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=216–217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's [[Crawford Greenewalt]], [[Leona Woods]] and Fermi, who inserted the first slug, the reactor was powered up beginning on 13 September 1944. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the [[control rod]]s to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The cooling water was investigated to see if there was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor started up again, only to shut down once more.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=304–307}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 220-223"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=220–223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fermi contacted [[Chien-Shiung Wu]], who identified the cause of the problem as [[neutron poison]]ing from [[xenon-135]], which has a [[half-life]] of 9.2 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howes|Herzenberg|1999|p=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Fermi, Woods, [[Donald J. Hughes]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler]] then calculated the [[nuclear cross section]] of xenon-135, which turned out to be 30,000 times that of uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Libby|1979|pp=182–183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; DuPont engineer George Graves had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added an additional 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this overengineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thayer|1996|p=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Reactor D was started on 17 December 1944 and Reactor F on 25 February 1945.&lt;ref name="Thayer 1996 141"&gt;{{harvnb|Thayer|1996|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Separation process ===

The bottom red square is the 300 area.|alt=A contour map showing the fork of the Columbia and Yakima rivers and the boundary of the land, with seven small red squares marked on it]]
Meanwhile, the chemists considered the problem of how plutonium could be separated from uranium when its chemical properties were not known. Working with the minute quantities of plutonium available at the Metallurgical Laboratory in 1942, a team under Charles M. Cooper developed a [[fluoride selective electrode|lanthanum fluoride process]] for separating uranium and plutonium, which was chosen for the pilot separation plant. A second separation process, the [[bismuth phosphate process]], was subsequently developed by Seaborg and Stanly G. Thomson.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=184–185}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This process worked by toggling plutonium between its +4 and +6 [[oxidation state]]s in solutions of bismuth phosphate. In the former state, the plutonium was precipitated; in the latter, it stayed in solution and the other products were precipitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanford Cultural and Historic Resources Program|2002|pp=2–4.15-2-4.18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenewalt favored the bismuth phosphate process due to the corrosive nature of lanthanum fluoride, and it was selected for the Hanford separation plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=204–205}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Once X-10 began producing plutonium, the pilot separation plant was put to the test. The first batch was processed at 40% efficiency but over the next few months this was raised to 90%.&lt;ref name="Jones 1985 209" /&gt;

At Hanford, top priority was initially given to the installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. Notwithstanding the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=214–216}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early plans called for the construction of two separation plants in each of the areas known as 200-West and 200-East. This was subsequently reduced to two, the T and U plants, in 200-West and one, the B plant, at 200-East.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=212}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Each separation plant consisted of four buildings: a process cell building or "canyon" (known as 221), a concentration building (224), a purification building (231) and a magazine store (213). The canyons were each {{convert|800|ft}} long and {{convert|65|ft}} wide. Each consisted of forty {{convert|17.7|by|13|by|20|ft|adj=on}} cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thayer|1996|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Work began on 221-T and 221-U in January 1944, with the former completed in September and the latter in December. The 221-B building followed in March 1945. Because of the high levels of radioactivity involved, all work in the separation plants had to be conducted by remote control using closed-circuit television, something unheard of in 1943. Maintenance was carried out with the aid of an overhead crane and specially designed tools. The 224 buildings were smaller because they had less material to process, and it was less radioactive. The 224-T and 224-U buildings were completed on 8 October 1944, and 224-B followed on 10 February 1945. The purification methods that were eventually used in 231-W were still unknown when construction commenced on 8 April 1944, but the plant was complete and the methods were selected by the end of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=219–222}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 February 1945, Matthias hand-delivered the first shipment of 80&amp;nbsp;g of 95%-pure plutonium nitrate to a Los Alamos courier in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Thayer 1996 141" /&gt;

=== Weapon design ===
{{Main|Project Y}}
[[File:Thin Man plutonium gun bomb casings.jpg|thumb|A row of Thin Man casings. Fat Man casings are visible in the background.|alt=Long, tube-like casings. In the background are several ovoid casings and a tow truck.]]
In 1943, development efforts were directed to a [[gun-type fission weapon]] with plutonium called [[Thin Man (nuclear bomb)|Thin Man]]. Initial research on the properties of plutonium was done using cyclotron-generated plutonium-239, which was extremely pure, but could only be created in very small amounts. Los Alamos received the first sample of plutonium from the Clinton X-10 reactor in April 1944 and within days Emilio Segrè discovered a problem: the reactor-bred plutonium had a higher concentration of plutonium-240, resulting in up to five times the spontaneous fission rate of cyclotron plutonium.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=226–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seaborg had correctly predicted in March 1943 that some of the plutonium-239 would absorb a neutron and become plutonium-240.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=250–252}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

This made reactor plutonium unsuitable for use in a gun-type weapon. The plutonium-240 would start the chain reaction too quickly, causing a [[predetonation]] that would release enough energy to disperse the critical mass with a minimal amount of plutonium reacted (a [[fizzle (nuclear test)|fizzle]]). A faster gun was suggested but found to be impractical. The possibility of separating the isotopes was considered and rejected, as plutonium-240 is even harder to separate from plutonium-239 than uranium-235 from uranium-238.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=242–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work on an alternative method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun earlier under the direction of the physicist [[Seth Neddermeyer]]. Implosion used explosives to crush a subcritical sphere of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and the mass becomes a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=312–313}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Neddermeyer's 1943 and early 1944 investigations into implosion showed promise, but also made it clear that the problem would be much more difficult from a theoretical and engineering perspective than the gun design.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=129–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1943, [[John von Neumann]], who had experience with [[shaped charge]]s used in armor-piercing shells, argued that not only would implosion reduce the danger of predetonation and fizzle, but would make more efficient use of the fissionable material.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=246}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed using a spherical configuration instead of the cylindrical one that Neddermeyer was working on.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Implosion Nuclear weapon.svg|thumb|left|An implosion-type nuclear bomb|alt=Diagram showing fast explosive, slow explosive, uranium tamper, plutonium core and neutron initiator]]
By July 1944, Oppenheimer had concluded plutonium could not be used in a gun design, and opted for implosion. The accelerated effort on an implosion design, codenamed [[Fat Man]], began in August 1944 when Oppenheimer implemented a sweeping reorganization of the Los Alamos laboratory to focus on implosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=245–248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two new groups were created at Los Alamos to develop the implosion weapon, X (for explosives) Division headed by explosives expert [[George Kistiakowsky]] and G (for gadget) Division under Robert Bacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new design that von Neumann and T (for theoretical) Division, most notably Rudolf Peierls, had devised used [[explosive lens]]es to focus the explosion onto a spherical shape using a combination of both slow and fast high explosives.&lt;ref name="Hoddeson et al, pp. 294-296" /&gt;

The design of lenses that detonated with the proper shape and velocity turned out to be slow, difficult and frustrating.&lt;ref name="Hoddeson et al, pp. 294-296"&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=294–296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various explosives were tested before settling on [[composition B]] as the fast explosive and [[baratol]] as the slow explosive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final design resembled a soccer ball, with 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal lenses, each weighing about {{convert|80|lb}}. Getting the detonation just right required fast, reliable and safe electrical [[detonator]]s, of which there were two for each lens for reliability.&lt;ref name="Hansen. p. V-123" /&gt; It was therefore decided to use [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s, a new invention developed at Los Alamos by a group led by [[Luis Walter Alvarez|Luis Alvarez]]. A contract for their manufacture was given to [[Raytheon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=301–307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To study the behavior of converging [[shock wave]]s, Robert Serber devised the [[RaLa Experiment]], which used the short-lived [[radioisotope]] [[lanthanum-140]], a potent source of [[gamma radiation]]. The gamma ray source was placed in the center of a metal sphere surrounded by the explosive lenses, which in turn were inside in an [[ionization chamber]]. This allowed the taking of an X-ray movie of the implosion. The lenses were designed primarily using this series of tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=148–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his history of the Los Alamos project, [[David Hawkins (philosopher)|David Hawkins]] wrote: "RaLa became the most important single experiment affecting the final bomb design".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hawkins|Truslow|Smith|1961|p=203}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the explosives was the {{convert|4.5|inch|adj=on}} thick aluminum pusher, which provided a smooth transition from the relatively low density explosive to the next layer, the {{convert|3|inch|adj=on}} thick tamper of natural uranium. Its main job was to hold the critical mass together as long as possible, but it would also reflect neutrons back into the core. Some part of it might fission as well. To prevent predetonation by an external neutron, the tamper was coated in a thin layer of boron.&lt;ref name="Hansen. p.

The ultimate task of the metallurgists was to determine how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple [[allotropes of plutonium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=244–245}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The brittle α phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic β phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable δ phase that normally exists in the 300&amp;nbsp;°C to 450&amp;nbsp;°C range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with [[alpha particles]], which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a [[plutonium-gallium alloy]], which stabilized the δ phase and could be [[hot pressing|hot pressed]] into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|Hecker|Harbur|1983|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work proved dangerous. By the end of the war, half the experienced chemists and metallurgists had to be removed from work with plutonium when unacceptably high levels of the element appeared in their urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=288}}&lt;/ref&gt; A minor fire at Los Alamos in January 1945 led to a fear that a fire in the plutonium laboratory might contaminate the whole town, and Groves authorized the construction of a new facility for plutonium chemistry and metallurgy, which became known as the DP-site.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hemispheres for the first plutonium [[pit (nuclear weapon)|pit]] (or core) were produced and delivered on 2 July 1945. Three more hemispheres followed on 23 July and were delivered three days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=330–331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trinity ===
{{Main|Trinity (nuclear test)}}
Because of the complexity of an implosion-style weapon, it was decided that, despite the waste of fissile material, an initial test would be required. Groves approved the test, subject to the active material being recovered. Consideration was therefore given to a controlled fizzle, but Oppenheimer opted instead for a full-scale [[nuclear test]], codenamed "Trinity".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=465}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trinity device readied.jpg|thumb|left|The explosives of "the gadget" were raised to the top of the tower for the final assembly.|alt=Men stand around a large oil-rig type structure. A large round object is being hoisted up.]]
In March 1944, planning for the test was assigned to [[Kenneth Bainbridge]], a professor of physics at Harvard, working under Kistiakowsky. Bainbridge selected the [[Alamogordo Bombing Range|bombing range]] near [[Alamogordo Army Airfield]] as the site for the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=318–319}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bainbridge worked with Captain Samuel P. Davalos on the construction of the Trinity Base Camp and its facilities, which included barracks, warehouses, workshops, an explosive magazine and a commissary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=478–481}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Groves did not relish the prospect of explaining the loss of a billion dollars worth of plutonium to a Senate committee, so a cylindrical containment vessel codenamed "Jumbo" was constructed to recover the active material in the event of a failure. Measuring {{convert|25|ft|m}} long and {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide, it was fabricated at great expense from {{convert|214|ST}} of iron and steel by [[Babcock &amp; Wilcox]] in Barberton, Ohio. Brought in a special railroad car to a siding in Pope, New Mexico, it was transported the last {{convert|25|mi}} to the test site on a trailer pulled by two tractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=174–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time it arrived, however, confidence in the implosion method was high enough, and the availability of plutonium was sufficient, that Oppenheimer decided not to use it. Instead, it was placed atop a steel tower {{convert|800|yd}} from the weapon as a rough measure of how powerful the explosion would be. In the end, Jumbo survived, although its tower did not, adding credence to the belief that Jumbo would have successfully contained a fizzled explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=365–367}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones, p. 512"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=512}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A pre-test explosion was conducted on 7 May 1945 to calibrate the instruments. A wooden test platform was erected {{convert|800|yd}} from Ground Zero and piled with {{convert|100|ST}} of TNT spiked with [[nuclear fission product]]s in the form of an irradiated uranium slug from Hanford, which was dissolved and poured into tubing inside the explosive. This explosion was observed by Oppenheimer and Groves's new deputy commander, Brigadier General [[Thomas Farrell (general)|Thomas Farrell]]. The pre-test produced data that proved vital for the Trinity test.&lt;ref name="Jones, p. 512" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=360–362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the actual test, the weapon, nicknamed "the gadget", was hoisted to the top of a {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} steel tower, as detonation at that height would give a better indication of how the weapon would behave when dropped from a bomber. Detonation in the air maximized the energy applied directly to the target, and generated less [[nuclear fallout]]. The gadget was assembled under the supervision of [[Norris Bradbury]] at the nearby [[McDonald Ranch House]] on 13 July, and precariously winched up the tower the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=367–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers included Bush, Chadwick, Conant, Farrell, Fermi, Groves, Lawrence, Oppenheimer and Tolman. At 05:30 on 16 July 1945 the gadget exploded with an [[TNT equivalent|energy equivalent]] of around 20 kilotons of TNT, leaving a crater of [[Trinitite]] (radioactive glass) in the desert {{convert|250|ft}} wide. The shock wave was felt over {{convert|100|mi}} away, and the [[mushroom cloud]] reached {{convert|7.5|mi}} in height. It was heard as far away as [[El Paso, Texas]], so Groves issued a cover story about an ammunition magazine explosion at Alamogordo Field.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=372–374}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=514–517}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trinity Detonation T&amp;B.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] of the Manhattan Project was the first detonation of a [[nuclear weapon]].]]
Oppenheimer later recalled that, while witnessing the explosion, he thought of a verse from the [[Hindu]] holy book, the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' (XI,12):
{{quote|कालोऽस्मि लोकक्षयकृत्प्रवृद्धो लोकान्समाहर्तुमिह प्रवृत्तः। ऋतेऽपि त्वां न भविष्यन्ति सर्वे येऽवस्थिताः प्रत्यनीकेषु योधाः॥११- ३२॥

If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one&amp;nbsp;...{{sfn|Jungk|1958|p=201}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asitis.com/11/12.html |title=Bhagavad Gita As It Is, 11: The Universal Form, Text 12 |access-date=July 19, 2013  |publisher=A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Years later he would explain that another verse had also entered his head at that time:
{{quote|We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the ''Bhagavad Gita''; [[Vishnu]] is trying to persuade the [[Arjuna|Prince]] that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on [[Vishvarupa|his multi-armed form]] and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.&lt;ref name="The Decision to Drop the Bomb" /&gt;{{efn|1=Oppenheimer spoke these words in the television documentary ''[http://www.atomicarchive.com/Movies/Movie8.shtml The Decision to Drop the Bomb]'' (1965).&lt;ref name="The Decision to Drop the Bomb"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.atomicarchive.com/Movies/Movie8.shtml | title = J. Robert Oppenheimer on the Trinity test (1965) |access-date=May 23, 2008 | publisher = Atomic Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oppenheimer read the original text in [[Sanskrit]], "{{IAST|kālo'smi lokakṣayakṛtpravṛddho lokānsamāhartumiha pravṛttaḥ}}" (XI,32),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |access-date=24 October 2012 |url=http://www.asitis.com/11/32.html |title=Chapter 11. The Universal Form, text 32|publisher=Bhagavad As It Is}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he translated as "I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds". In the literature, the quote usually appears in the form ''shatterer'' of worlds, because this was the form in which it first appeared in print, in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] on November 8, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 8, 1948 |title=The Eternal Apprentice |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,853367-8,00.html |access-date=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later appeared in Robert Jungk's ''Brighter than a Thousand Suns: A Personal History of the Atomic Scientists'' (1958),{{sfn|Jungk|1958|p=201}} which was based on an interview with Oppenheimer. See Hijiya, ''The Gita of Robert Oppenheimer''{{sfn|Hijiya|2000|pp=123–124}}}}}}

== Personnel ==
In June 1944, the Manhattan Project employed some 129,000 workers, of whom 84,500 were construction workers, 40,500 were plant operators and 1,800 were military personnel. As construction activity fell off, the workforce declined to 100,000 a year later, but the number of military personnel increased to 5,600. Procuring the required numbers of workers, especially highly skilled workers, in competition with other vital wartime programs proved very difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=344}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, Groves obtained a special temporary priority for labor from the [[War Manpower Commission]]. In March 1944, both the War Production Board and the War Manpower Commission gave the project their highest priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=353}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Groves at Oak Ridge.jpg|thumb|Major General Leslie R.

Tolman and Conant, in their role as the project's scientific advisers, drew up a list of candidate scientists and had them rated by scientists already working on the project. Groves then sent a personal letter to the head of their university or company asking for them to be released for essential war work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=349–350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], [[Stanislaw Ulam]] gave one of his students, [[Joan Hinton]], an exam early, so she could leave to do war work. A few weeks later, Ulam received a letter from Hans Bethe, inviting him to join the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ulam|1976|pp=143–144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Conant personally persuaded Kistiakowsky to join the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=350}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

One source of skilled personnel was the Army itself, particularly the [[Army Specialized Training Program]]. In 1943, the MED created the [[Special Engineer Detachment]] (SED), with an authorized strength of 675. Technicians and skilled workers drafted into the Army were assigned to the SED. Another source was the Women's Army Corps (WAC). Initially intended for clerical tasks handling classified material, the WACs were soon tapped for technical and scientific tasks as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=358}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 February 1945, all military personnel assigned to the MED, including all SED detachments, were assigned to the 9812th Technical Service Unit, except at Los Alamos, where military personnel other than SED, including the WACs and Military Police, were assigned to the 4817th Service Command Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=361}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Associate Professor of [[Radiology]] at the [[University of Rochester School of Medicine]], [[Stafford L. Warren]], was commissioned as a colonel in the [[United States Army Medical Corps]], and appointed as chief of the MED's Medical Section and Groves' medical advisor. Warren's initial task was to staff hospitals at Oak Ridge, Richland and Los Alamos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=123}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Medical Section was responsible for medical research, but also for the MED's health and safety programs. This presented an enormous challenge, because workers were handling a variety of toxic chemicals, using hazardous liquids and gases under high pressures, working with high voltages, and performing experiments involving explosives, not to mention the largely unknown dangers presented by radioactivity and handling fissile materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=410}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet in December 1945, the [[National Safety Council]] presented the Manhattan Project with the Award of Honor for Distinguished Service to Safety in recognition of its safety record. Between January 1943 and June 1945, there were 62 fatalities and 3,879 disabling injuries, which was about 62 percent below the rate of private industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=430}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1945 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' article estimated that before the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings "probably no more than a few dozen men in the entire country knew the full meaning of the Manhattan Project, and perhaps only a thousand others even were aware that work on atoms was involved." The magazine wrote that the more than 100,000 others employed with the project "worked like moles in the dark". Warned that disclosing the project's secrets was punishable by 10 years in prison or a $10,000 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US-GDP|10000|1945|r=-3}}}} today) fine, they saw enormous quantities of raw materials enter factories with nothing coming out, and monitored "dials and switches while behind thick concrete walls mysterious reactions took place" without knowing the purpose of their jobs.&lt;ref name="life1945082091"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA91#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=Manhattan Project: Its Scientists Have Harnessed Nature's Basic Force |newspaper=Life |date=20 August 1945 |accessdate=25 November 2011 |author=Wickware, Francis Sill |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|life1945082094}}&lt;ref name="owens"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/infocus/2012/06/the-secret-city/100326/#img06 |title=The Secret City/ Calutron operators at their panels, in the Y-12 plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, during World War II. |magazine=The Atlantic |date=25 June 2012 |accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|wellerstein20120416}}{{r|wickware19460909}}

Oak Ridge security personnel considered any private party with more than seven people as suspicious, and residents—who believed that US government agents were secretly among them—avoided repeatedly inviting the same guests. Although original residents of the area could be buried in existing cemeteries, every coffin was reportedly opened for inspection.&lt;ref name="wickware19460909"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UEkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=Oak Ridge |magazine=Life |date=9 September 1946 |accessdate=17 December 2014 |last=Wickware |first=Francis Sill |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone, including top military officials, and their automobiles were searched when entering and exiting project facilities. One Oak Ridge worker stated that "if you got inquisitive, you were called on the carpet within two hours by government secret agents. Usually those summoned to explain were then escorted bag and baggage to the gate and ordered to keep going".{{r|warren19450807}}

Despite being told that their work would help end the war and perhaps all future wars,&lt;ref name="warren19450807"&gt;{{cite news |title=Atomic Bomb Secrecy Related By Ex-Worker |newspaper=The Miami News |date=7 August 1945 |author=Warren, Cecil |pp=1–A}}&lt;/ref&gt; not seeing or understanding the results of their often tedious duties—or even typical side effects of factory work such as smoke from smokestacks—and the war in Europe ending without the use of their work, caused serious morale problems among workers and caused many rumors to spread. One manager stated after the war:{{quote|Well it wasn't that the job was tough&amp;nbsp;... it was confusing. You see, no one knew what was being made in Oak Ridge, not even me, and a lot of the people thought they were wasting their time here. It was up to me to explain to the dissatisfied workers that they were doing a very important job. When they asked me what, I'd have to tell them it was a secret. But I almost went crazy myself trying to figure out what was going on.{{r|wellerstein20120416}}}}

Another worker told of how, working in a laundry, she every day held "a special instrument" to uniforms and listened for "a clicking noise". She learned only after the war that she had been performing the important task of checking for radiation with a [[geiger counter]]. To improve morale among such workers Oak Ridge created an extensive system of intramural sports leagues, including 10 baseball teams, 81 softball teams, and 26 football teams.&lt;ref name="wellerstein20120416"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2012/04/16/oak-ridge-confidential-or-baseball-for-bombs/ |title=Oak Ridge Confidential, or Baseball for Bombs |publisher=Restricted Data |date=16 April 2012 |accessdate=7 April 2013 |last=Wellerstein |first=Alex |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117023813/http://nuclearsecrecy.com/blog/2012/04/16/oak-ridge-confidential-or-baseball-for-bombs/# |archive-date=17 January 2013 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Censorship ===
[[File:Are your drawers closed? Manhattan Project security poster.png|thumb|Security poster, warning office workers to close drawers and put documents in safes when not being used]]
Voluntary censorship of atomic information began before the Manhattan Project. After the start of the European war in 1939 American scientists began avoiding publishing military-related research, and in 1940 scientific journals began asking the [[National Academy of Sciences]] to clear articles. [[William L. Laurence]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', who wrote an article on atomic fission in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' of 7 September 1940, later learned that government officials asked librarians nationwide in 1943 to withdraw the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sweeney|2001|pp=196–198}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets noticed the silence, however. In April 1942 nuclear physicist [[Georgy Flyorov]] wrote to [[Josef Stalin]] on the absence of articles on nuclear fission in American journals; this resulted in the Soviet Union establishing its own atomic bomb project.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holloway|1994|pp=76–79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manhattan Project operated under tight security lest its discovery induce Axis powers, especially Germany, to accelerate their own nuclear projects or undertake covert operations against the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=253–255}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The government's [[Office of Censorship]], by contrast, relied on the press to comply with a voluntary code of conduct it published, and the project at first avoided notifying the office. By early 1943 newspapers began publishing reports of large construction in Tennessee and Washington based on public records, and the office began discussing with the project how to maintain secrecy. In June the Office of Censorship asked newspapers and broadcasters to avoid discussing "atom smashing, atomic energy, atomic fission, atomic splitting, or any of their equivalents. The use for military purposes of radium or radioactive materials, heavy water, high voltage discharge equipment, cyclotrons." The office also asked to avoid discussion of "polonium, uranium, ytterbium, hafnium, protactinium, radium, rhenium, thorium, deuterium"; only uranium was sensitive, but was listed with other elements to hide its importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sweeney|2001|pp=198–200}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ap19450808"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8CZdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0loNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1159%2C1605869 |title=No News Leaked Out About Bomb |newspaper=Lawrence Journal-World |date=8 August 1945 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=15 April 2012 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soviet spies ===
{{Main|Atomic spies}}
The prospect of sabotage was always present, and sometimes suspected when there were equipment failures. While there were some problems believed to be the result of careless or disgruntled employees, there were no confirmed instances of Axis-instigated sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=263–264}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 10 March 1945, a Japanese [[fire balloon]] struck a power line, and the resulting power surge caused the three reactors at Hanford to be temporarily shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=267}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With so many people involved, security was a difficult task. A special [[Counter Intelligence Corps]] detachment was formed to handle the project's security issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=258–260}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1943, it was clear that the Soviet Union was attempting to penetrate the project. Lieutenant Colonel [[Boris T. Pash]], the head of the Counter Intelligence Branch of the [[Western Defense Command]], investigated suspected Soviet espionage at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. Oppenheimer informed Pash that he had been approached by a fellow professor at Berkeley, [[Haakon Chevalier]], about passing information to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=261–265}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most successful Soviet spy was [[Klaus Fuchs]], a member of the British Mission who played an important part at Los Alamos.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=142–145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=312–314}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of [[Harry Gold]], [[David Greenglass]], and [[Ethel and Julius Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=472}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other spies like [[George Koval]] and [[Theodore Hall]] remained unknown for decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Broad |first=William J.|date=12 November 2007|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/12/us/12koval.html |title=A Spy's Path: Iowa to A-Bomb to Kremlin Honor|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|pp=1–2|accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The value of the espionage is difficult to quantify, as the principal constraint on the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]] was a shortage of uranium ore. The consensus is that espionage saved the Soviets one or two years of effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holloway|1994|pp=222–223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foreign intelligence ==
{{Main|Alsos Mission}}
In addition to developing the atomic bomb, the Manhattan Project was charged with gathering intelligence on the [[German nuclear energy project]]. It was believed that the [[Japanese nuclear weapons program]] was not far advanced because Japan had little access to uranium ore, but it was initially feared that Germany was very close to developing its own weapons. At the instigation of the Manhattan Project, a [[Norwegian heavy water sabotage|bombing and sabotage campaign]] was carried out against heavy water plants in German-occupied Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=191–192}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A small mission was created, jointly staffed by the [[Office of Naval Intelligence]], OSRD, the Manhattan Project, and Army Intelligence (G-2), to investigate enemy scientific developments. It was not restricted to those involving nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=187–190}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chief of Army Intelligence, Major General [[George V. Strong]], appointed Boris Pash to command the unit,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=281}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which was codenamed "Alsos", a Greek word meaning "grove".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=191}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:German Experimental Pile - Haigerloch - April 1945.jpg|thumb|left|Allied soldiers dismantle the German experimental nuclear reactor at [[Haigerloch]].|alt=Soldiers and workmen, some wearing steel helmet, clamber over what looks like a giant manhole.]]
The Alsos Mission to Italy questioned staff of the physics laboratory at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] following the capture of the city in June 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=282}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Pash formed a combined British and American Alsos mission in London under the command of Captain Horace K. Calvert to participate in [[Operation Overlord]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=194–196}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Groves considered the risk that the Germans might attempt to disrupt the [[Normandy landings]] with radioactive poisons was sufficient to warn General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and send an officer to brief his chief of staff, Lieutenant General [[Walter Bedell Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=200–206}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the codename [[Operation Peppermint]], special equipment was prepared and [[Chemical Warfare Service]] teams were trained in its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=283–285}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following in the wake of the advancing Allied armies, Pash and Calvert interviewed [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]] about the activities of German scientists. They spoke to officials at Union Minière du Haut Katanga about uranium shipments to Germany. They tracked down 68 tons of ore in Belgium and 30 tons in France. The interrogation of German prisoners indicated that uranium and thorium were being processed in [[Oranienburg]], 20 miles north of Berlin, so Groves [[Auergesellschaft#Russian Alsos|arranged for it to be bombed]] on 15 March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=286–288}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An Alsos team went to [[Stassfurt]] in the [[Soviet Occupation Zone]] and retrieved 11 tons of ore from [[WIFO (Nazi company)|WIFO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=237}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1945, Pash, in command of a composite force known as T-Force, conducted [[Operation Harborage]], a sweep behind enemy lines of the cities of [[Hechingen]], [[Bisingen]], and [[Haigerloch]] that were the heart of the German nuclear effort. T-Force captured the nuclear laboratories, documents, equipment and supplies, including heavy water and 1.5 tons of metallic uranium.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=289–290}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goudsmit|1947|pp=174–176}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alsos teams rounded up German scientists including [[Kurt Diebner]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Walther Gerlach]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], and [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], who were taken to England where they were interned at [[Farm Hall]], a bugged house in [[Godmanchester]]. After the bombs were detonated in Japan, the Germans were forced to confront the fact that the Allies had done what they could not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=333–340}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparations ===
Starting in November 1943, the [[Air Force Materiel Command|Army Air Forces Materiel Command]] at [[Wright Field]], Ohio, began [[Silverplate]], the codename modification of B-29s to carry the bombs. Test drops were carried out at [[Edwards Air Force Base|Muroc Army Air Field]], California, and the [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake|Naval Ordnance Test Station at Inyokern, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=380–381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groves met with the Chief of [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF), General [[Henry H. Arnold]], in March 1944 to discuss the delivery of the finished bombs to their targets.&lt;ref name="Groves, pp. 253-255"&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=253–255}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The only Allied aircraft capable of carrying the {{convert|17|ft|m|adj=on}} long Thin Man or the {{convert|59|in|cm|adj=on}} wide Fat Man was the British [[Avro Lancaster]], but using a British aircraft would have caused difficulties with maintenance. Groves hoped that the American [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] could be modified to carry Thin Man by joining its two [[bomb bay]]s together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=379–380}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arnold promised that no effort would be spared to modify B-29s to do the job, and designated Major General [[Oliver P. Echols]] as the USAAF liaison to the Manhattan Project. In turn, Echols named Colonel [[Roscoe C. Wilson]] as his alternate, and Wilson became Manhattan Project's main USAAF contact.&lt;ref name="Groves, pp. 253-255" /&gt; President Roosevelt instructed Groves that if the atomic bombs were ready before the war with Germany ended, he should be ready to drop them on Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=184}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CGP-JPAP-112.jpg|thumb|Silverplate B-29 ''[[Straight Flush (B-29)|Straight Flush]]''. The tail code of the [[444th Bombardment Group]] is painted on for security reasons.|alt=A shiny metal four-engined aircraft stands on a runway. The crew pose in front of it.]]
The [[509th Composite Group]] was activated on 17 December 1944 at [[Wendover Army Air Field]], Utah, under the command of Colonel [[Paul W. Tibbets]]. This base, close to the border with [[Nevada]], was codenamed "Kingman" or "W-47". Training was conducted at Wendover and at [[Batista Army Airfield]], Cuba, where the [[393d Bomb Squadron|393d Bombardment Squadron]] practiced long-distance flights over water, and dropping dummy [[pumpkin bomb]]s. A special unit known as [[Project Alberta]] was formed at Los Alamos under Navy Captain [[William S. Parsons]] from Project Y as part of the Manhattan Project to assist in preparing and delivering the bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=259–262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Commander [[Frederick L. Ashworth]] from Alberta met with Fleet Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]] on [[Guam]] in February 1945 to inform him of the project. While he was there, Ashworth selected [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field]] on the Pacific Island [[Tinian]] as a base for the 509th Composite Group, and reserved space for the group and its buildings. The group deployed there in July 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=386–388}}&lt;/ref&gt; Farrell arrived at Tinian on 30 July as the Manhattan Project representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=311}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the components for Little Boy left San Francisco on the cruiser {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}} on 16 July and arrived on Tinian on 26 July. Four days later the ship was sunk by a Japanese submarine. The remaining components, which included six uranium-235 rings, were delivered by three [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster|C-54 Skymasters]] of the 509th Group's 320th Troop Carrier Squadron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Campbell|2005|pp=39–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two Fat Man assemblies travelled to Tinian in specially modified 509th Composite Group B-29s. The first [[plutonium core]] went in a special C-54.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=341}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A joint targeting committee of the Manhattan District and USAAF was established to determine which cities in Japan should be targets, and recommended [[Kokura]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Niigata (city)|Niigata]], and [[Kyoto]]. At this point, [[Secretary of War]] Henry L. Stimson intervened, announcing that he would be making the targeting decision, and that he would not authorize the bombing of Kyoto on the grounds of its historical and religious significance. Groves therefore asked Arnold to remove Kyoto not just from the list of nuclear targets, but from targets for conventional bombing as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=268–276}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Kyoto's substitutes was [[Nagasaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|p=308}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bombings ===
In May 1945, the [[Interim Committee]] was created to advise on wartime and postwar use of nuclear energy. The committee was chaired by Stimson, with [[James F. Byrnes]], a former US Senator soon to be [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], as President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s personal representative; [[Ralph A. Bard]], the Under Secretary of the Navy; [[William L. Clayton]], the Assistant Secretary of State; Vannevar Bush; Karl T. Compton; James B. Conant; and [[George L. Harrison]], an assistant to Stimson and president of [[New York Life Insurance Company]]. The Interim Committee in turn established a scientific panel consisting of Arthur Compton, Fermi, Lawrence and Oppenheimer to advise it on scientific issues. In its presentation to the Interim Committee, the scientific panel offered its opinion not just on the likely physical effects of an atomic bomb, but on its probable military and political impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=530–532}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Potsdam Conference]] in Germany, Truman was informed that the Trinity test had been successful. He told Stalin, the leader of the [[Soviet Union]], that the US had a new superweapon, without giving any details. This was the first official communication to the Soviet Union about the bomb, but Stalin already knew about it from spies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holloway|1994|pp=116–117}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the authorization to use the bomb against Japan already given, no alternatives were considered after the Japanese rejection of the [[Potsdam Declaration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/potsdam_decision.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122185554/http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/potsdam_decision.htm|archivedate=22 November 2010|title= Potsdam and the Final Decision to Use the Bomb|publisher=US Department of Energy, Office of History and Heritage Resources |work=The Manhattan Project: An Interactive History |accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Atomic bombing of Japan.jpg|thumb|left|Little Boy explodes over [[Hiroshima]], Japan, 6 August 1945 (left);&lt;br /&gt;Fat Man explodes over [[Nagasaki]], Japan, 9 August 1945 (right).|alt=Two mushroom clouds rise vertically.]]
On 6 August 1945, a Boeing B-29 Superfortress (''[[Enola Gay]]'') of the 393d Bombardment Squadron, piloted by Tibbets, lifted off from North Field, and Little Boy in its bomb bay. Hiroshima, the headquarters of the [[2nd General Army]] and [[5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|Fifth Division]] and a port of embarkation, was the primary target of the mission, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternatives. With Farrell's permission, Parsons, the weaponeer in charge of the mission, completed the bomb assembly in the air to minimize the risks during takeoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=315–319}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The bomb detonated at an altitude of {{convert|1750|ft}} with a blast that was later estimated to be the equivalent of 13 kilotons of TNT.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=392–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; An area of approximately {{convert|4.7|sqmi|km2}} was destroyed. Japanese officials determined that 69% of Hiroshima's buildings were destroyed and another 6–7% damaged. About 70,000 to 80,000 people, of whom 20,000 were Japanese combatants and 20,000 were Korean slave laborers, or some 30% of the population of Hiroshima, were killed immediately, and another 70,000 injured.&lt;ref name="USSBS"&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=[[Harry S.

On the morning of 9 August 1945, a second B-29 (''[[Bockscar]]''&lt;!-- yes, it is "Bockscar" not "Bock's Car". This is ''not'' a typo! --&gt;), piloted by the 393d Bombardment Squadron's commander, Major [[Charles W. Sweeney]], lifted off with Fat Man on board. This time, Ashworth served as weaponeer and Kokura was the primary target. Sweeney took off with the weapon already armed but with the electrical safety plugs still engaged. When they reached Kokura, they found cloud cover had obscured the city, prohibiting the visual attack required by orders. After three runs over the city, and with fuel running low, they headed for the secondary target, Nagasaki. Ashworth decided that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured, but a last-minute break in the clouds over Nagasaki allowed a visual approach as ordered. The Fat Man was dropped over the city's industrial valley midway between the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works in the south and the Mitsubishi-Urakami Ordnance Works in the north. The resulting explosion had a blast yield equivalent to 21 kilotons of TNT, roughly the same as the Trinity blast, but was confined to the [[Urakami]] Valley, and a major portion of the city was protected by the intervening hills, resulting in the destruction of about 44% of the city. The bombing also crippled the city's industrial production extensively and killed 23,200–28,200 Japanese industrial workers and 150 Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nuke-Rebuke: Writers &amp; Artists Against Nuclear Energy &amp; Weapons (The Contemporary anthology series) |pp=22–29 |date=1 May 1984 |publisher=The Spirit That Moves Us Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, an estimated 35,000–40,000 people were killed and 60,000 injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=343–346}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoddeson et al., pp. 396-397"&gt;{{harvnb|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=396–397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groves expected to have another atomic bomb ready for use on 19 August, with three more in September and a further three in October.&lt;ref name="Briefing book"&gt;{{cite web |title= The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II, A Collection of Primary Sources |publisher=[[George Washington University]] |date= 13 August 1945 |work=National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 162 |url= http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/72.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two more Fat Man assemblies were readied, and scheduled to leave [[Kirtland Air Force Base|Kirtland Field]] for Tinian on 11 and 14 August.&lt;ref name="Hoddeson et al., pp. 396-397" /&gt; At Los Alamos, technicians worked 24 hours straight to cast [[Demon core|another plutonium core]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manhattanprojectvoices.org/oral-histories/lawrence-litzs-interview-2012 |title=Lawrence Litz's Interview (2012) |publisher=Manhattan Project Voices |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although cast, it still needed to be pressed and coated, which would take until 16 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/08/16/the-third-cores-revenge/ |title=The Third Core's Revenge |publisher=Restricted Data |first=Alex |last=Wellerstein |date=16 August 2013 |accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could therefore have been ready for use on 19 August. On 10 August, Truman secretly requested that additional atomic bombs not be dropped on Japan without his express authority.&lt;ref name="Eclipsed by Hiroshima and Nagasaki"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Eclipsed by Hiroshima and Nagasaki: Early Thinking about Tactical Nuclear Weapons |first=Barton J. |last=Bernstein |journal=[[International Security]] |issn=0162-2889 |volume=15 |issue=4 |date=Spring 1991 |pp=149–173 |jstor=2539014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groves suspended the third core's shipment on his own authority on 13 August.&lt;ref name="Eclipsed by Hiroshima and Nagasaki" /&gt;

On 11 August, Groves phoned Warren with orders to organize a survey team to report on the damage and radioactivity at Hiroshima and Nagasaki. A party equipped with portable Geiger counters arrived in Hiroshima on 8 September headed by Farrell and Warren, with Japanese Rear Admiral Masao Tsuzuki, who acted as a translator. They remained in Hiroshima until 14 September and then surveyed Nagasaki from 19 September to 8 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahnfeldt|1966|pp=886–889}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This and other scientific missions to Japan would provide valuable scientific and historical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Home|Low|1993|p=537}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The necessity of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki became a [[debate over the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|subject of controversy among historians]]. Some questioned whether an "atomic diplomacy" would not have attained the same goals and disputed whether the bombings or the [[Soviet–Japanese War (1945)|Soviet declaration of war]] on Japan was decisive.&lt;ref name="Briefing book" /&gt; The [[Franck Report]] was the most notable effort pushing for a demonstration but was turned down by the Interim Committee's scientific panel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frisch|1970|pp=107–115}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Szilárd petition]], drafted in July 1945 and signed by dozens of scientists working on the Manhattan Project, was a late attempt at warning President Harry S.

Seeing the work they had not understood produce the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs amazed the workers of the Manhattan Project as much as the rest of the world; newspapers in Oak Ridge announcing the Hiroshima bomb sold for $1 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US-GDP|1|1945|r=0}}}} today}).&lt;ref name="life1945082094"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hkgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;pg=PA94#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=Mystery Town Cradled Bomb: 75,000 in Oak Ridge, Tenn.

I don't know anything about it, and there's nothing to say". Many residents continued to avoid discussion of "the stuff" in ordinary conversation despite it being the reason for their town's existence.{{r|wickware19460909}}

In anticipation of the bombings, Groves had [[Henry DeWolf Smyth]] prepare a history for public consumption. ''[[Smyth Report|Atomic Energy for Military Purposes]]'', better known as the "Smyth Report", was released to the public on 12 August 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=348–362}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Groves and Nichols presented [[Army–Navy "E" Award]]s to key contractors, whose involvement had hitherto been secret. Over 20 awards of the [[Presidential Medal for Merit]] were made to key contractors and scientists, including Bush and Oppenheimer. Military personnel received the [[Legion of Merit]], including the commander of the [[Women's Army Corps]] detachment, Captain Arlene G. Scheidenhelm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=226}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At Hanford, plutonium production fell off as Reactors B, D and F wore out, poisoned by fission products and swelling of the graphite moderator known as the [[Wigner effect]]. The swelling damaged the charging tubes where the uranium was irradiated to produce plutonium, rendering them unusable. In order to maintain the supply of polonium for the urchin initiators, production was curtailed and the oldest unit, B pile, was closed down so at least one reactor would be available in the future. Research continued, with DuPont and the Metallurgical Laboratory developing a [[redox]] solvent extraction process as an alternative [[nuclear reprocessing|plutonium extraction]] technique to the bismuth phosphate process, which left unspent uranium in a state from which it could not easily be recovered.&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 592-593"&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|pp=592–593}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bomb engineering was carried out by the Z Division, named for its director, Dr. [[Jerrold R. Zacharias]] from Los Alamos. Z Division was initially located at Wendover Field but moved to [[Oxnard Field]], New Mexico, in September 1945 to be closer to Los Alamos. This marked the beginning of [[Sandia Base]]. Nearby Kirtland Field was used as a B-29 base for aircraft compatibility and drop tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|1995b|p=V-152}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By October, all the staff and facilities at Wendover had been transferred to Sandia.&lt;ref name="Hewlett 1962 625"&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=625}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As reservist officers were demobilized, they were replaced by about fifty hand-picked regular officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|pp=225–226}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nichols recommended that S-50 and the Alpha tracks at Y-12 be closed down. This was done in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|pp=216–217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although performing better than ever,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=624}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Alpha tracks could not compete with K-25 and the new K-27, which had commenced operation in January 1946. In December, the Y-12 plant was closed, thereby cutting the Tennessee Eastman payroll from 8,600 to 1,500 and saving $2&amp;nbsp;million a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=630, 646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Atomic Energy Act of 1946 signing.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Harry S. Truman]] signs the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]], establishing the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]].|alt=A man in a suit is seated at a desk, signing a document. Seven men in suits gather around him.]]
Nowhere was demobilization more of a problem than at Los Alamos, where there was an exodus of talent. Much remained to be done. The bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were like laboratory pieces; work would be required to make them simpler, safer and more reliable. Implosion methods needed to be developed for uranium in place of the wasteful gun method, and composite uranium-plutonium cores were needed now that plutonium was in short supply because of the problems with the reactors. However, uncertainty about the future of the laboratory made it hard to induce people to stay. Oppenheimer returned to his job at the University of California and Groves appointed Norris Bradbury as an interim replacement. In fact, Bradbury would remain in the post for the next 25 years.&lt;ref name="Hewlett 1962 625" /&gt; Groves attempted to combat the dissatisfaction caused by the lack of amenities with a construction program that included an improved water supply, three hundred houses, and recreation facilities.&lt;ref name="Jones, pp. 592-593" /&gt;

Two Fat Man–type detonations were conducted at [[Bikini Atoll]] in July 1946 as part of [[Operation Crossroads]] to investigate the effect of nuclear weapons on warships.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|p=234}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Able was detonated on 1 July 1946. The more spectacular Baker was detonated underwater on 25 July 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=594}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a number of Manhattan Project physicists founded the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'', which began as an emergency action undertaken by scientists who saw urgent need for an immediate educational program about atomic weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grodzins|Rabinowitch|1963|p=vii}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of the destructiveness of the new weapons and in anticipation of the [[nuclear arms race]] several project members including Bohr, Bush and Conant expressed the view that it was necessary to reach agreement on international control of nuclear research and atomic weapons. The [[Baruch Plan]], unveiled in a speech to the newly formed [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]] (UNAEC) in June 1946, proposed the establishment of an international atomic development authority, but was not adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gosling|1994|pp=55–57}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a domestic debate over the permanent management of the nuclear program, the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) was created by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1946]] to take over the functions and assets of the Manhattan Project. It established civilian control over atomic development, and separated the development, production and control of atomic weapons from the military. Military aspects were taken over by the [[Armed Forces Special Weapons Project]] (AFSWP).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Groves|1962|pp=394–398}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Manhattan Project ceased to exist on 31 December 1946, the Manhattan District was not abolished until 15 August 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1985|p=600}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project expenditure through 1 October 1945 was $1.845&amp;nbsp;billion, equivalent to less than nine days of wartime spending, and was $2.191&amp;nbsp;billion when the AEC assumed control on 1 January 1947. Total allocation was $2.4&amp;nbsp;billion. Over 90% of the cost was for building plants and producing the fissionable materials, and less than 10% for development and production of the weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nichols|1987|pp=34–35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ej19450807"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yuVkAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=KoENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5621%2C2841878 |title=Atomic Bomb Seen as Cheap at Price |newspaper=Edmonton Journal |date=7 August 1945 |accessdate=1 January 2012 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of four weapons (the Trinity gadget, Little Boy, Fat Man, and an unused bomb) were produced by the end of 1945, making the average cost per bomb around $500&amp;nbsp;million in 1945 dollars. By comparison, the project's total cost by the end of 1945 was about 90% of the total spent on the production of US small arms (not including ammunition) and 34% of the total spent on US tanks during the same period.&lt;ref name="Schwartz" /&gt; Overall, it was the second most expensive weapons project undertaken by the United States in World War II, behind only the design and production of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Brien|2015|pp=47–48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political and cultural impacts of the development of nuclear weapons were profound and far-reaching. [[William Laurence]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'', the first to use the phrase "[[Atomic Age]]",&lt;ref name="laurence19450926"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fpLSlthuEMC&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;ots=vv5mTfKJUM&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;f=false |title=Drama of the Atomic Bomb Found Climax in July 16 Test |newspaper=The New York Times |date=26 September 1945 |accessdate=1 October 2012 |last=Laurence |first=William L. |author-link=William Laurence}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the official correspondent for the Manhattan Project in spring 1945. In 1943 and 1944 he unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Office of Censorship to permit writing about the explosive potential of uranium, and government officials felt that he had earned the right to report on the biggest secret of the war. Laurence witnessed both the Trinity test&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sweeney|2001|pp=204–205}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the bombing of Nagasaki and wrote the official press releases prepared for them. He went on to write a series of articles extolling the virtues of the new weapon. His reporting before and after the bombings helped to spur public awareness of the potential of nuclear technology and motivated its development in the United States and the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Holloway|1994|pp=59–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wartime Manhattan Project left a legacy in the form of the network of [[United States Department of Energy national laboratories|national laboratories]]: the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], [[Argonne National Laboratory]], and [[Ames Laboratory]]. Two more were established by Groves soon after the war, the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] at [[Upton, New York]], and the [[Sandia National Laboratories]] at Albuquerque, New Mexico. Groves allocated $72&amp;nbsp;million to them for research activities in fiscal year 1946–1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=633–637}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They would be in the vanguard of the kind of large-scale research that [[Alvin Weinberg]], the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, would call [[Big Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weinberg|1961|p=161}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Naval Research Laboratory had long been interested in the prospect of using nuclear power for warship propulsion, and sought to create its own nuclear project. In May 1946, Nimitz, now [[Chief of Naval Operations]], decided that the Navy should instead work with the Manhattan Project. A group of naval officers were assigned to Oak Ridge, the most senior of whom was Captain [[Hyman G. Rickover]], who became assistant director there. They immersed themselves in the study of nuclear energy, laying the foundations for a [[nuclear navy|nuclear-powered navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=74–76}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar group of Air Force personnel arrived at Oak Ridge in September 1946 with the aim of developing [[nuclear aircraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=72–74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion|Nuclear Energy for the Propulsion of Aircraft]] (NEPA) project ran into formidable technical difficulties, and was ultimately cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=490–493, 514–515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of the new reactors to create radioactive isotopes in previously unheard-of quantities sparked a revolution in [[nuclear medicine]] in the immediate postwar years. Starting in mid-1946, Oak Ridge began distributing radioisotopes to hospitals and universities. Most of the orders were for [[iodine-131]] and [[phosphorus-32]], which were used in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In addition to medicine, isotopes were also used in biological, industrial and agricultural research.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=252–253}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On handing over control to the Atomic Energy Commission, Groves bid farewell to the people who had worked on the Manhattan Project:{{quote|Five years ago, the idea of Atomic Power was only a dream. You have made that dream a reality. You have seized upon the most nebulous of ideas and translated them into actualities. You have built cities where none were known before. You have constructed industrial plants of a magnitude and to a precision heretofore deemed impossible. You built the weapon which ended the War and thereby saved countless American lives. With regard to peacetime applications, you have raised the curtain on vistas of a new world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=655}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2014, the [[United States Congress]] passed a law providing for a national park dedicated to the history of the Manhattan Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://energy.gov/management/office-management/operational-management/history/manhattan-project/manhattan-project-0 |title=Manhattan Project National Historical Park |publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] |accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Manhattan Project National Historical Park]] was established on 10 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Manhattan Project National Historical Park |url=https://www.energy.gov/management/office-management/operational-management/history/manhattan-project/manhattan-project-0 |publisher=Department of Energy |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''New Horizons 2''''' (also '''''New Horizons II''''', '''NHII''', or '''NH2''') was a proposed mission to the [[trans-Neptunian object]]s by [[NASA]]. It was conceived as a [[planetary flyby]] mission in 2002, based on the ''[[New Horizons]]'' spacecraft, which was in development at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526152209/https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/05/new-horizons-ii-2004-2005/|title=New Horizons II (2004-2005) {{!}} Wired Science {{!}} Wired.com|date=2012-05-26|access-date=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/new_horizons2.pdf|title=New Horizons 2|last=Stern|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Stern|display-authors=2|author2=Binzel, Rick |author3=Levison, Hal |author4=Lopes, Rosaly |author5=Millis, Bob |author6= Moore, Jeff |publisher=[[Lunar and Planetary Institute]]|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005, the proposal was not selected for further development because of a shortage of [[plutonium-238]] needed for the [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/nh2_final_report.pdf New Horizons II Final Report - March 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New Horizons 2'' study was funded out of the [[New Frontiers program]], and was delivered to the U.S. Congress in June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/opag/meetings/jun2005/presentations/NH2_Decadal_API.pdf|title=Presentation: SSE Decadal Survey and New Horizons: A Rough Start|date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''New Horizons 2'' was included in the tentative budget for the [[New Frontiers program]] missions.&lt;ref name=CzyszBruno2009/&gt; In 2004 the United States Senate Appropriations Committee provided additional funding for ''New Horizons 2'', a new [[Kuiper belt]] mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/outerplanets-04h.html|title=New Horizons For Planetary Exploration|last=Stern|first=Alan|date=October 5, 2004|accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 2004 there was a conference on how to make the most use of ''New Horizons 2''{{'s}} Uranus flyby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=14354Revolution Afoot-- Cheaper, More Frequent Outer Planets Missions - New Horizons II Workshop]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''odor amplifier''' is a fictional invention that is described in the 1970 novel ''Principles of American Nuclear Chemistry: A Novel'', by mechanical engineer [[Thomas A. McMahon]]. In the novel, it is invented by a character modeled on the real-life [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] [[Richard Feynman]].

== Physical appearance and mechanisms ==
It is described as a device that looks like a medicine dropper suspended above a beaker.  Small drops of metallic [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] fall from the dropper into the beaker below.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. McMahon, Principles of American Nuclear Chemistry: A Novel (1970), Little, Brown and Company, {{ISBN|0-226-56110-0}}, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"The growing drop adsorbs the faint odors of the room on its surface,...but when it falls into the beaker it gives up most of its surface area.  Most of the odor is then released back into the air, but it stays in the beaker above the surface of the mercury, because odors are heavier than air."}}

== Odor amplifier in reality ==
The odor amplifier, as described in the novel, is not feasible in real life. The metallic mercury droplets are not exposed in flight for long enough to acquire any perceptible odors, and, if small enough, they tend to bounce off of the liquid surface and out of the beaker. Other attempts to have similar devices (see Related devices, below) have been successful. Any device which could identify an odor and then generate more of it would also be plausible, given that the odor molecules in question were [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] enough to be easily detectable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cf.ac.uk/biosi/staffinfo/jacob/teaching/sensory/olfact1.html University page on olfaction]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pratiwi Pujilestari Sudarmono''' (born 31 July 1952) is an [[Indonesia]]n scientist. She is currently  professor of microbiology at the [[University of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]].

Pratiwi Sudarmono received a master's degree from the University of Indonesia in 1977, and the Ph.D. in Molecular Biology from the [[University of Osaka]], Japan, in 1984. She then started her scientific career as WHO grantee researching the molecular biology of ''[[Salmonella typhi]]''. From 1994 to 2000, she was head of the Department of Microbiology of the Medical Faculty of the University of Indonesia. From 2001 to 2002, she was a scholar in the [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] New Century Scholars Program.

==Space Shuttle Mission STS-61-H==
In October 1985, she was selected to take part in the [[NASA]] Space Shuttle mission [[STS-61-H]] as a [[Payload specialist|Payload Specialist]]. [[Taufik Akbar]] was her backup on the mission. However, after the [[STS-51-L|Challenger disaster]] the deployment of commercial satellites like the Indonesian [[Palapa B-3]] planned for the STS-61-H mission was canceled, thus the mission never took place. The satellite was later launched with a [[Delta rocket]].

'''Proteomyxa''' is a name given by E. Ray Lankester to a group of [[Sarcodina]].&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Proteomyxa |volume=22 |page=471 |first=Marcus Manuel |last=Hartog |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an obsolete group.

Many of the species are [[endoparasites]] in living cells, mostly of [[alga]]e or [[fungus|fungi]], but not exclusively. At least two species of [[Pseudospora]] have been taken for reproductive stages in the life history of their hosts—whence indeed the generic name. Plasmodiophora brassicae gives rise to the disease known as Hanburies or fingers and toes in Cruciferae; Lymphosporidium causes a virulent epidemic among the American [[brook trout]] (Salvelinus fontinalis). Archerina boltoni is remarkable for containing a pair of [[chlorophyll]] corpuscles in each cell; no nucleus has been made out, but the chlorophyll bodies divide previous to fission. It is a fresh-water form. The cells of this species form loose aggregates or filoplasmodia, like those of Mikrogromia or Leydenia.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

'''Reactive transport modeling in porous media''' refers to the creation of [[computer models]] integrating [[chemical reaction]] with [[Transport phenomena|transport]] of fluids through the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]]. Such models predict the distribution in space and time of the chemical reactions that occur along a flowpath. Reactive transport modeling in general can refer to many other processes, including reactive flow of chemicals through tanks, reactors, or membranes; particles and species in the atmosphere; gases exiting a smokestack; and migrating magma.

== Overview ==
Reactive transport models are constructed to understand the composition of natural waters; the origin of [[Ore|economic mineral deposits]]; the formation and dissolution of rocks and [[minerals]] in geologic formations in response to injection of industrial wastes, steam, or [[carbon dioxide]]; and the generation of acidic waters and leaching of [[Heavy metals|metals]] from [[Environmental impact of mining|mine wastes]]. They are often relied upon to predict the migration of contaminant plumes; the mobility of [[radionuclide]]s in [[Deep geological repository|waste repositories]]; and the [[biodegradation]] of chemicals in [[landfill]]s. When applied to the study of contaminants in the environments, they are known as fate and transport models.&lt;ref name="GBRM"&gt;Bethke, C.M., 2008, ''Geochemical and Biogeochemical Reaction Modeling''. Cambridge University Press, 547 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of reactive transport modeling ==
Modern reactive transport modeling has arisen from several separate schools of thought.&lt;ref name= "Steefel, DePaolo, and Lichtner"&gt;Steefel, C.I., D.J. DePaolo, and P.C. Lichtner, 2005, Reactive transport modeling: An essential tool and a new research approach for the Earth sciences. ''Earth and Planetary Science Letters'' '''240''', 539-558&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hydrologists]] primarily concerned with the physical nature of mass transport assumed relatively simple reaction formulations, such as linear distribution coefficients or linear decay terms, which could be added to the [[Convection diffusion equation|advection-dispersion equation]]. By assuming linear, equilibrium [[sorption]], for example, the advection-dispersion equation can be modified by a simple [[retardation factor]] and solved [[Closed-form expression|analytically]]. Such analytical solutions are limited to relatively simple flow systems and reactions.

[[Geochemical modeling|Geochemical models]], on the other hand, have been developed to provide [[Chemical thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] descriptions of multicomponent systems without regard to transport. Reaction path models were created, for instance, to describe the sequence of chemical reactions resulting from [[chemical weathering]] or [[hydrothermal alteration]] in [[Batch reactor|batch systems]], in terms of the overall reaction progress. By adopting the reference frame of a packet of fluid and treating reaction progress as travel time (or distance along a flowpath), however, a batch reaction path model could be thought of as describing advective transport through an [[aquifer]].&lt;ref&gt;Lichtner, P.C., 1988, The quasi-stationary state approximation to coupled mass transport and fluid-rock interaction in a porous medium. ''Geochemica et Cosmochemica Acta'' '''52''', 143-165&lt;/ref&gt;

The most sophisticated multi-component reactive transport models considered both reaction and transport.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtner, P.C., 1985, Contiuum model for simultaneous chemical reactions and mass transport in hydrothermal systems. ''Geochemica et Cosmochemica Acta'' '''49''', 779-800&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Gharasoo2012"&gt;Gharasoo, M., Centler, F., Regnier, P., Harms, H., Thullner, M., 2012.

Environmental Modelling &amp; Software 30, 102-114.&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies developed the theoretical basis of reactive transport models, and the numerical tools necessary to solve them, and applied them to problems of reactive contaminant transport&lt;ref&gt;Yeh, G.T. and V.S. Tripathi, 1989, A critical evaluation of recent developments in hydrogeochemical transport models of reactive multi-chemical components. ''Water Resources Research'' '''25''', 93-108&lt;/ref&gt; and flow through reacting hydrothermal systems.&lt;ref name = "Steefel and Lasaga"&gt;Steefel, C.I. and A.C. Lasaga, 1994, A coupled model for transport of multiple chemical species and kinetic precipitation/dissolution reactions with application to reactive flow in single phase hydrothermal systems. ''American Journal of Science'' '''294''', 529-592&lt;/ref&gt;

Reactive transport models have found increased application in recent years with improvements in the power of personal computers and [[#Software programs in common use|modeling software]].&lt;ref name = "Gharasoo2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brady, P.V. and C.M. Bethke, 2000, Beyond the Kd approach. ''Ground Water'' '''38''', 321-322&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes considered in reactive transport models ==
Reactive transport models couple a large number chemical reactions with mass transport. Certain applications, such as [[geothermal energy]] production and [[ore deposit]] modeling, require the additional calculation of [[heat transfer]]. In modeling [[carbon sequestration]] and [[hydraulic fracturing]], moreover, it may be necessary to describe rock deformation resulting from mineral growth or abnormally high fluid pressure. Description of transport through the [[unsaturated zone]] and [[multiphase flow]] modeling, as applied to transport of [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]]; non-aqueous phase liquids ([[DNAPL]] or [[LNAPL]]); and [[supercritical carbon dioxide]] requires increasingly complex models which are prone to considerable uncertainty.

In many cases the processes simulated in reactive transport models are highly related. Mineral dissolution and precipitation, for example, can affect the [[porosity]] and [[Permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] of the domain, which in turn affect the flow field and groundwater velocity. Heat transport greatly affects the [[viscosity]] of water and its ability to flow. Below are many of the physical and chemical processes which can be simulated with reactive transport models.

== Solving reactive transport models ==
Some of the simplest reactive transport problems can be solved analytically. Where equilibrium sorption is described by a linear distribution coefficient, for example, the sorbing solute's velocity is retarded relative to that of a nonreactive tracer; the relative velocities can be described with a retardation factor. Analytical solutions are exact solutions of the governing equations. 

Complex reactive transport problems are more commonly solved numerically. In this case, the governing equations are approximated so that they can be solved by computer algorithms. The governing equations, including both reaction and transport terms, can be solved simultaneously using a one-step or global implicit simulator. This technique is straightforward conceptually, but computationally very difficult.&lt;ref name ="Steefel and MacQuarrie"&gt;Steefel, C.I. and K.T.B. MacQuarrie, 1996, Approaches to modeling of reactive transport in porous media. In P.C. Lichtner, C.I. Steefel, and E.H. Oelkers (eds.), 1996, Reactive Transport in Porous Media. ''Reviews in Mineralogy'' '''34''', 85-129&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of solving all the relevant equations together, the transport and chemical reaction equations can be solved separately. [[Operator splitting]], as this technique is known, uses appropriate numerical techniques to solve the reaction and transport equations at each time step.&lt;ref name="GBRM" /&gt; Various methods exist, including the sequential non-iterative approach (SNIA), [[Strang splitting]], and sequential iterative approach (SIA).&lt;ref name ="Steefel and MacQuarrie" /&gt; Since the reaction and transport terms are handled separately, separate programs for batch reaction and transport can be linked together. Cross-linkable [[Reentrancy (computing)|re-entrant software]] objects designed for this purpose readily enable construction of reactive transport models of any flow configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aqueous Solutions launches ChemPlugin|url=http://www.researchpark.illinois.edu/news/aqueous-solutions-launches-chemplugin|work=Researchpark.illinois.edu|publisher=Research Park at the University of Illinois|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemplugin.org/|title=ChemPlugin.ORG|publisher=Aqueous Solutions LLC|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges ==
Reactive transport modeling requires input from numerous fields, including [[hydrology]], [[geochemistry]] and [[biogeochemistry]], [[microbiology]], [[soil physics]], and [[fluid dynamics]].&lt;ref name= "Steefel, DePaolo, and Lichtner" /&gt; The numerical formulation and solution of reactive transport problems can be especially difficult due to errors arising in the coupling process, beyond those inherent to the individual processes. Valocchi and Malmstead (1992), for example, reported on the potential errors arising from the operator splitting technique.&lt;ref&gt;Valocchi, A.J. and M. Malmstead, 1992, Accuracy of operator splitting for advection-dispersion-reaction problems. ''Water Resources Research'' '''28(5)''', 1471-1476&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in the absence of numerical difficulties, the general lack of knowledge available to practitioners creates uncertainty. Field sites are typically [[heterogeneous]], both physically and chemically, and sampling is often sparse. The prevailing assumption of [[Fick's laws of diffusion|Fickian]] [[Dispersive mass transfer|dispersion]] is often inadequate. [[Equilibrium constants]] and [[chemical kinetics|kinetic rate laws]] for relevant reactions are often poorly known. The complexity of many processes requires expertise in one or more of the above mentioned fields. Many processes, such as long-term nuclear waste storage, cannot be experimentally verified; reactive transport problems can only attempt to predict such long-term behavior. The current descriptions of multi-phase flow and mechanical deformation processes are still being developed.

'''Sheila Sen Jasanoff''' is an [[Indian American]] academic and significant contributor to the field of [[Science and Technology Studies]].

==Early life and education==
Born in India, Jasanoff attended [[Radcliffe College]], where she studied mathematics as an undergraduate, receiving her bachelor's degree in 1964.  She then studied linguistics, receiving her M.A. at the [[University of Bonn]] (then part of West Germany). She returned to Harvard to complete a Ph.D. in linguistics in 1973, and a J.D. at [[Harvard Law School]] in 1976. She practiced environmental law in Boston from 1976 to 1978. She and her husband then accepted positions at [[Cornell University]], where she became a pioneer in the newly emerging field of Science and Technology Studies. In 1998, Jasanoff joined the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] as a professor of public policy. In 2002, she became Pforzheimer Professor of Science and Technology Studies.&lt;ref name=Crimson2014&gt;{{cite news|last1=Le|first1=Quynh-Nhu|title=Sheila S.

==Work==
Jasanoff founded and directs the Program on Science, Technology, and Society at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=Director&gt;{{cite web|title=Director: Sheila Jasanoff|url=http://sts.hks.harvard.edu/people/director.html|website=Program on Science, Technology &amp; Society|publisher=Kennedy School of Government Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research focuses on science and the state in contemporary democratic societies.  Her work is relevant to science &amp; technology studies, comparative politics, law and society, political and legal anthropology, sociology and policy analysis.  Jasanoff's research has considerable empirical breadth, spanning the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, the European Union, and India, as well as emerging global regimes in areas such as climate and biotechnology.

One line of Jasanoff's work demonstrates how the political culture of different democratic societies influences how they assess evidence and expertise in policymaking.  Her first book (with Brickman and Ilgen), ''Controlling Chemicals'' (1985), examines the regulation of toxic substances in the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Brickman, Ilgen, and Jasanoff, ''Controlling Chemicals''.  Cornell University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  The book showed how the routines of decision making in these countries reflected different conceptions of what counts as evidence and of how expertise should operate in a policy context.  In ''Designs on Nature: Science and Democracy in Europe and the United States'' (2005), she has shown how different societies employ different modes of public reasoning when making decisions involving science and technology.&lt;ref name=Ezrahi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ezrahi|first1=Yaron|title=Controlling Biotechnology: Science, Democracy and 'Civic Epistemology'|journal=Metascience|date=7 May 2008|volume=17|issue=2|pages=177–198|doi=10.1007/s11016-008-9201-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasanoff, Sheila, ''Designs on Nature: Science and Democracy in Europe and the United States'', Princeton University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;   These differences, which in part reflect distinct "civic epistemologies," are deeply embedded in institutions and shape how policy issues are framed and processed by the bureaucratic machinery of  modern states.

Jasanoff has also contributed to scholarship on the interaction of science and law.

Jasanoff also has contributed to building Science and Technology Studies as a field.  Prior to moving to Harvard, she was the founding chair of the [http://sts.cornell.edu/ Department of Science &amp; Technology Studies] at Cornell University.  She is also the founder of the [http://www.hks.harvard.edu/sdn/ Science &amp; Democracy Network], a group of scholars interested in the study of science and the state in democratic societies that has met annually since 2002.   Her research has been recognized with many awards, including the Bernal Prize from the [[Society for Social Studies of Science]], a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Albert O. Hirschman Prize from the [[Social Science Research Council]].

The last scheduled flight of Atlantis before it is retired.--&gt;]]
The retirement of [[NASA]]'s [[Space Shuttle]] fleet took place from March to July 2011. ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'' was the first of the three active space shuttles to be retired, completing its [[STS-133|final mission]] on March 9, 2011; ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'' [[STS-134|did so]] on June 1. The [[STS-135|final shuttle mission]] was completed with the landing of ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' on July 21, 2011, closing the 30-year [[Space Shuttle program]].

The Shuttle was presented to the public in 1972 as a "space truck" which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in [[low earth orbit]] in the early 1990s and then be replaced by a new vehicle. When the concept of the U.S. space station evolved into that of the [[International Space Station]], which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed, the service life of the Space Shuttle was extended several times until 2011 when it was finally retired.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In 2010 the Shuttle was formally scheduled for retirement with ''Atlantis'' being taken out of service first after [[STS-132]] in May of that year, but the program was once again extended when the two final planned missions were delayed until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Malik, Tariq [http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/nasa-delays-shuttle-program-end-2011-100701.html "NASA Delays Space Shuttle Program's End to 2011"]. Space.com, July 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Later, one additional mission was added for ''Atlantis'' for July 2011, extending the program further. Counter-proposals to the shuttle's retirement were considered by Congress&lt;ref name="Orlando Sentinel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_politics/2010/03/shuttle-flights-would-continue-under-new-proposal.html|title=Shuttle flights would continue under new proposal|publisher=Orlando Sentinel|date=March 3, 2010|accessdate=March 4, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307012940/http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_politics/2010/03/shuttle-flights-would-continue-under-new-proposal.html|archivedate=March 7, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the prime contractor [[United Space Alliance]] as late as spring 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41397955/ns/technology_and_science-space/|title=NASA weighs plan to keep space shuttle until 2017|publisher=MSNBC|last=Coppinger|first=Rob|date=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardware developed for the Space Shuttle met various ends with conclusion of the program, including donation, disuse and/or disposal, or reuse. An example of reuse, is that [[Leonardo MPLM|one of the three]] [[Multi-Purpose Logistics Module]] (MPLM) was converted to a [[Permanent Multipurpose Module|permanent module]] for the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name=gebhardt&gt;[http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/10/pmm-leonardo-final-permanent-us-module-iss/ Chris Gebhardt – "PMM Leonardo: The Final Permanent U.S. Module for the ISS" (October 6, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Prior to its move to New York, ''Enterprise'' was displayed at the [[Udvar-Hazy Center]], Smithsonian Institution's [[National Air and Space Museum]], [[Chantilly, Virginia]], where ''Discovery'' has taken its place.
[[File:STS-135 being rolled out to be processed.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'']] towed back to the Orbiter Processing Facility for the last time at the end of the Shuttle program]]
Museums and other facilities not selected to receive an orbiter were disappointed. Elected officials representing Houston, Texas, location of the [[Johnson Space Center]]; and Dayton, Ohio, location of [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] called for Congressional investigations into the selection process, though no such action was taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nolan|first=John|title=No shuttle for Dayton; Air Force museum came close|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/dayton-news/no-shuttle-for-dayton-air-force-museum-came-close-1134589.html|newspaper=Dayton Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; While local and Congressional politicians in Texas questioned if partisan politics played a role in the selection, former JSC Director [[Wayne Hale]] wrote "Houston didn't get an orbiter because Houston didn't deserve it" pointing to weak support from area politicians, media and residents, describing a "sense of entitlement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Houston Did Not Get A Shuttle|url=https://waynehale.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/why-houston-did-not-get-a-shuttle/|website=Wayne Hale's Blog|date=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lost in space: Shuttle snub offers a warning that our Space City standing may be at risk|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/editorial/7518946.html|newspaper=Houston Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago media questioned the decision not to include the [[Adler Planetarium]] in the list of facilities receiving orbiters, pointing to Chicago's 3rd-largest population in the United States. The chair of the NASA committee that made the selections pointed to the guidance from Congress that the orbiters go to facilities where the most people could see them, and the ties to the space program of Southern California (home to [[Edwards Air Force Base]], where nearly half of shuttle flights have ended and home to the plants which manufactured the orbiters and the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]]s), the Smithsonian (curator of the nation's air and space artifacts), the [[Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex]] (where all shuttle launches have originated, and a large tourist draw) and the [[Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum]] (which served as the recovery ship for [[Project Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No space shuttle for Adler, but space-flight simulator on its way|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/4785109-418/no-space-shuttle-for-adler-but-space-flight-simulator-on-its-way.html|newspaper=Chicago Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011 the NASA Inspector General released an audit of the display selection process; it highlighted issues which led to the final decision. The [[Museum of Flight]] in Seattle, Washington, [[March Field Air Museum]], Riverside, California, [[Evergreen Aviation and Space Museum]], McMinnville, Oregon, [[National Museum of the U.S. Air Force]], Dayton, Ohio, [[San Diego Air and Space Museum]], San Diego, [[Space Center Houston]], Houston, Texas, [[Tulsa Air and Space Museum &amp; Planetarium]], Tulsa, Oklahoma and [[U.S. Space and Rocket Center]], Huntsville, Alabama scored poorly on international access. Additionally [[Brazos Valley Museum of Natural History]] and the Bush Library at Texas A&amp;M, in College  Station, Texas scored poorly on museum attendance, regional population and was the only facility found to pose a significant risk in transporting an orbiter there. Overall, the [[California Science Center]] scored first and [[Brazos Valley Museum of Natural History]] scored last. The two most controversial locations which were not awarded an orbiter, [[Space Center Houston]] and [[National Museum of the U.S. Air Force]], finished 2nd to last and near the middle of the list respectively. The report noted a scoring error, which if corrected would have placed the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in a tie with the Intrepid Museum and Kennedy Visitor Complex (just below the California Science Center), although due to funding concerns the same decisions would have been made.&lt;ref&gt;http://oig.nasa.gov/audits/reports/FY11/Review_NASAs_Selection_Display_Locations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Museum of Flight]] in Seattle, Washington was not selected to receive an orbiter but instead received the three–story Full Fuselage Trainer from the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility at [[Johnson Space Center]] in Houston, Texas.&lt;ref name=sstrnopsat&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2019631692_shuttle08m.html |newspaper=Seattle Times |title=Museum of Flight's Space Shuttle Trainer exhibit opens Saturday |last=Broom |first=Jack |date=Nov 7, 2012 |accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum officials, though disappointed, were able to allow the public to go inside the trainer, something not possible with an actual orbiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Broom|first=Jack|title=Seattle won't get shuttle – but will get full-size simulator|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2014751898_shuttledecision13m.html|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Discovery on display at Udvar-Hazy.JPG|right|thumb|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'' on display at the Udvar-Hazy Center for restorations]]
In addition to the challenge of transporting the large vehicles to the display site, placing the units on permanent display required considerable effort and cost. An article in the February 2012 issue of [[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;''Smithsonian'', February 2012, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; discussed the work performed on ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]''. It involved removing the three main engines (they were slated to be reused on NASA's new [[Space Launch System]]); the windows were given to project engineers for analysis of how materials and systems fared after repeated space exposure; the communications modules were removed due to national–security concerns; and hazardous materials such as traces of propellants were thoroughly flushed from the plumbing. The total cost of preparation and delivery via a modified [[Boeing 747]] was estimated at $26.5 million in 2011 dollars.

* Various space pallets used since STS-1: the fates of these objects range from space center storage to scrap to museum pieces

===Tiles===
NASA ran a program to donate [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]] tiles to schools and universities for $23.40 USD each (the fee for S&amp;H).&lt;ref name=tiles&gt;[http://www.cfnews13.com/article/news/2010/december/178743/NASA-offers-space-shuttle-tiles-to-school-and-universities Channel 13 News – "NASA offers space shuttle tiles to school and universities" (December 1, 2010)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708133214/http://www.cfnews13.com/article/news/2010/december/178743/NASA-offers-space-shuttle-tiles-to-school-and-universities |date=July 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 7000 tiles were available on a [[first-come, first-served]] basis, but limited to one per institution.&lt;ref name=tiles/&gt; Each orbiter incorporated over 24,000 tiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/space/orl-disaster0120203,0,7193918.story Michael Cabbage and Robyn Suriano Sentinel – "A stunned NASA searches for answers" (February 2, 2003) – orlandosentinel.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--This section is outdated and needs to be rewritten to reflect the use of the SSMEs on the SLS program.--&gt;
About 42 reusable [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|SSMEs]] (Pratt &amp; Whitney RS-25/26) have been part of the STS program, with three used per orbiter per mission.&lt;ref&gt;KSC booklet, Quote: "Since the first Space Shuttle launch on April 12, 1981, 42 different SSMEs have successfully demonstrated the performance, safety, and reliability of the world's only reusable liquid-fuel rocket engine.", [http://www.collectspace.com/ubb/Forum30/HTML/000409.html source]&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was made to retain all engines with plans to make use of them in future launch vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/608887main_T%26R.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====SSME nozzles====
Worn out engine nozzles are typically considered scrap, although nine nozzles were refurbished for display on the donated orbiters, so the actual engines can be retained by NASA.&lt;ref name=bergin&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/10/replica-engines-retired-orbiters-flown-ssmes-hlv/|first=Chris|last=Bergin|title=Replica engines recommended for retired orbiters – Flown SSMEs for HLV|date=October 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canadarm (SRMS) and OBSS===
[[File:STS-120 OBSS repair.jpg|thumb|Boom in use on STS-120]]
Three [[Canadarm|Shuttle arms]] were used by NASA; the arms of both ''Discovery'' and ''Atlantis'' will be left in place for their museum display.&lt;ref name=chrisg&gt;[http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2010/11/discoverys-retirement-provide-insight-fate-fleets-robotic-arms/ Chris Gebhardt – "Discovery’s retirement plans provide insight into the fate of the robotic arms" (November 17, 2010) – nasaspaceflight.com]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Endeavour'''s arm is to be removed from the orbiter for separate display in Canada.&lt;ref name=chrisg/&gt; The [[Orbiter Boom Sensor System|OBSS]] extension of ''Endeavour''{{'}}s arm was left on the International Space Station, for use with [[Canadarm2|the station's robotic arm]].&lt;ref name=chrisg/&gt;

===Information technology===
In December 2010, as NASA prepared for the STS program ending, an audit by the NASA [[Office of Inspector General]] (OIG) found that information technology had been sold or prepared for sale that still contained sensitive information.&lt;ref name=inspector&gt;[http://www.portaltotheuniverse.org/blogs/posts/view/86473/ Lead] – [http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=32206 NASA Office of Inspector General – "Preparing for the Space Shuttle Program's Retirement: A Review of NASA's Disposition of Information Technology Equipment" (December 7, 2010)]&lt;/ref&gt; NASA OIG recommended NASA be more careful in the future.&lt;ref name=inspector/&gt;

Three lightning towers were added to the pad and it was temporarily "re-activated" in April 2009 when ''Endeavour'' was placed on standby to rescue the [[STS-125]] crew (the STS-125 mission was the last to visit the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], which meant that the ISS was out of range) if needed; ''Endeavour'' was then moved over to LC-39A for STS-126. In October 2009 the prototype [[Ares I-X]] rocket was launched from 39B. The pad was then permanently deactivated and has since been dismantled and is being modified for the [[Space Launch System]] program, and possibly other launch vehicles. Like the Apollo structures before them, the shuttle structures were scrapped. 39A was deactivated in July 2011 after STS-135 was launched. On January 16, 2013, it was erroneously reported{{who|date=February 2014}} that NASA planned to abandon the pad, but the actual plan is to, like pad B, convert it for other rockets without dismantling it.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} If NASA did plan to permanently decommission the pads, they would have to restore them to their original Apollo-era appearance, as both pads are on the [[National Historic Register]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
In December 2013 NASA announced that SpaceX would be the new tenant of pad 39A. SpaceX has since converted the pad to launch Falcon Heavy and manned Crew Dragon Falcon 9 flights. Following the destruction of [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40|Space Launch Complex 40]] in an on-pad explosion in September 2016, SpaceX had to move all east coast launches to 39A while SLC-40 was being rebuilt. The first launch, [[SpaceX Dragon|Dragon]] resupply vehicle carried by a Falcon 9, occurred February 12, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=41932.msg1637565#msg1637565|title=SpaceX Falcon 9 - EchoStar 23 - NET Feb 28, 2017 - UPDATES|website=forum.nasaspaceflight.com|access-date=2017-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/NASASpaceflight/status/828973960238870528|title=Chris B - NSF on Twitter|newspaper=Twitter|access-date=2017-02-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This flight was the first unmanned launch from Complex 39 since Skylab was launched in 1973. Once SLC-40 is back in action, SpaceX will finish modifying the pad for Falcon Heavy. Due to SLC-40s destruction, 39A had to be rushed into service, and activities such as dismantling the RSS were put on hold.

====[[Vehicle Assembly Building]]====
After STS-135, the VAB was used as a storage shed for the decommissioned shuttles before they were sent to museums. High Bay 3 is now being gutted of all equipment and given upgraded platforms, to support the Space Launch System and potentially the SpaceX [[Falcon Heavy]] as well as other vehicles. After the shuttle was decommissioned, NASA opened the VAB for public tours, which ended on February 11, 2014 as NASA prepares the VAB for future launch vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forgione|first=Mary|title=Florida: Kennedy Space Center's Vehicle Assembly Building tour to end|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/la-trb-florida-kennedy-space-center-20140121,0,7849377.story#axzz2ssj6Etss|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=10 February 2014|date=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Mobile Launcher Platform]]s====
The twin launch platforms are currently being modified for the Space Launch System with a large tower resembling those used in the Apollo program. Work is expected to be complete by 2016.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

====[[Crawler-Transporter]]====
The Crawler-Transporters were used as the mobile part of the pad with the shuttles; the two vehicles were deactivated and are being upgraded for the SLS program. The crawlerways used for transporting launch vehicles from the VAB to the twin pads of KSC are also being extensively renovated for the SLS program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herridge|first=Linda|title=Upgrades Will Prepare Crawlerway for Space Launch System|url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/ground/crawlerway_upgrades.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=10 February 2014|date=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mate-Demate Devices====
Used to mate the shuttle on the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, the Mate-Demate Devices were dismantled and scrapped.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

====[[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]]====
Two modified [[Boeing 747]]s were used to fly the shuttles back to KSC when they landed at Edwards AFB. N911NA was retired on February 8, 2012 and is now a [[Cannibalization (parts)|parts hulk]] for the [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy]]. Beginning in September 2014, N911NA was loaned out to the Joe Davies Heritage Airpark, in Palmdale, CA, where it is on outdoor display next to a B-52. The other aircraft, N905NA was used to send ''Discovery'', ''Endeavour'' and ''Enterprise'' to their museums and in September 2012 was found to have few parts for SOFIA. It is currently a museum piece at the [[Johnson Space Center]].

====NASA recovery ships====
Used to retrieve the SRBs, [[MV Liberty Star|MV ''Liberty Star'']] and [[MV Freedom Star|''Freedom Star'']] are now separated. ''Liberty Star'' was renamed as TV ''Kings Pointer'' and was transferred to the Merchant Marine Academy in New York for use as a training vessel. It will remain on call in case NASA needs it for further missions. ''Freedom Star'' was transferred to the [[James River Reserve Fleet]] on September 28, 2012 and placed under ownership of the [[United States Department of Transportation]].

====[[Orbiter Processing Facility]]====
The buildings used to process the shuttles after each mission were decommissioned. OPF-1 was leased to [[Boeing]] in January 2014 for processing the [[X-37B]] spaceplane&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boeing Expands at KSC To Support X-37B Program|url=http://spaceref.biz/2014/01/boeing-expands-at-ksc-to-support-x-37b-program.html|publisher=SpaceRef Business|accessdate=10 February 2014|author=Boeing|date=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while OPF-3 is also used by Boeing for the manufacture and testing of the [[CST-100]] spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chow|first=Denise|title=Boeing to Build Private Space Taxis in Old NASA Shuttle Hangar|url=http://www.space.com/13453-nasa-leases-shuttle-hangar-boeing-space-taxi.html|publisher=Space.com|accessdate=10 February 2014|date=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; OPF-2 also currently remains under lease by Boeing for its X-37B spaceplane.

====[[Shuttle Landing Facility]]====
The runway at KSC is currently used as a normal runway for the center and neighboring Cape Canaveral's daily operations.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} It may be used to land the X-37B and [[Sierra Nevada Corporation|Sierra Nevada]] [[Dream Chaser]] spaceplanes.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
The SLF received its first landing since ''Atlantis'' in June 2017 when the USAF X-37B landed on it at the end of almost 2 years in orbit.

==Former planned Space Shuttle successors==
In the 1980s, a planned successor to STS was called "Shuttle II", which encompassed a number of different ideas and was influenced by the Challenger disaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/sld051.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; At one point before retirement, extension of the Space Shuttle program for an additional five years while a replacement could be developed, was considered by the U.S. government.&lt;ref name="Orlando Sentinel"/&gt; Some programs to provide access to space after the shuttle were the [[Lockheed Martin X-33]], [[VentureStar]], the [[Orbital Space Plane Program]], and [[Ares I]] launcher (part of, and cancelled with Constellation). Some program from the 1980s were the NASA ''Advanced Manned Launch System'' program as well as the ''Future Space Transportation System'' program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/sld052.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/sld050.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; There was a number of proposals for space access systems in the 1970s also, such as the Rockwell ''Star-raker'' &lt;ref name="pmview.com"&gt;[http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/sld047.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Star-raker was a large single-stage to orbit design that used both rockets and ramjet for propulision.&lt;ref name="pmview.com"/&gt; It was a contemporary to the Boeing ''Reusable Aerodynamic Space Vehicle'', which an all-rocket propulsion single-stage to orbit design.&lt;ref name="pmview.com"/&gt;

For comparison to an earlier retirement, when the [[Saturn IB]] was last flown in 1975 for the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]], the Shuttle development program was already well underway. However, the Shuttle did not fly until 1981, which left a six-year gap in U.S. manned spaceflight. Because of this and other reasons, in particular, higher than expected Solar activity that caused Skylab's orbit to decay faster than hoped, the U.S. space station [[Skylab]] burned up in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="edelson197901"&gt;Edelson, Edward. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=kQEAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;ots=t7hvCFHSBl&amp;dq=skylab%20shuttle&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;q=skylab%20shuttle&amp;f=false Saving Skylab: The untold story]" ''Popular Science'', January 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ares I]] was going to be NASA's manned spacecraft after STS, with Congress attempting to accelerate its development so it would be ready as early as 2016 for the ISS, in addition they attempted to delay retirement of the shuttle to reduce the time gap.&lt;ref name="nasaspaceflight.com"&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2009/02/extra-nasa-funds-initial-step-towards-gap-reduction/]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ares I was cancelled along with the rest of Constellation in 2010.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/offices/hsf/meetings/10_22_pressconference.html|title=Review of U.S. Human Spaceflight Plans Committee|date=22 October 2009|publisher=NASA|accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The successor to STS with the cancellation would be combination of yet-to-be developed commercial crew spacecraft and the Orion plus the SLS

===Constellation Program===
{{Main|Constellation program}}
[[File:CEV-ISS.jpg|thumb|right|Artist's rendition of the docking of Orion to the [[International Space Station|ISS]] . Orion capsule got resurrected from the ashes of Constellation, possibly for asteroid missions. As a backup for ISS crew rotation or other destinations remained an option, but it would need a man-rated launch vehicle]]
Following the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' disaster]], in early 2003 President [[George W. Bush]], announced his [[Vision for Space Exploration]] which called for the completion of the American portion of the International Space Station by 2010 (due to delays this would not happen until 2011), the retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet following its completion, to return to the moon by 2020 and one day to Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://history.nasa.gov/Bush%20SEP.htm|title=President Bush Announces New Vision for Space Exploration Program |last=Bush|first=George|date=14 January 2004|accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new vehicle would need to be developed, it eventually was named the [[Orion spacecraft]], a six-person variant would have serviced the ISS and a four-person variant would have traveled to the Moon. The [[Ares I]] would have launched Orion, and the [[Ares V]] heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) would have launched all other hardware. The [[Altair (spacecraft)|Altair lunar lander]] would have landed crew and cargo onto the moon. The Constellation program experienced many cost overruns and schedule delays, and was openly criticized by the subsequent U.S. President, [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/15614/problems-surface-for-constellation-program/|title=Problems Surface For Constellation Program|last=Atkinson|first=Nancy|date=17 July 2008|publisher=Universe Today|accessdate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, the Obama administration proposed eliminating public funds for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies.&lt;ref name=Achenbach&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/31/AR2010013101058.html|title=NASA budget for 2011 eliminates funds for manned lunar missions|work=Washington Post|date=February 1, 2010|accessdate=February 1, 2010|first=Joel|last=Achenbach}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a speech at the Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, President Obama proposed the design selection of the new HLV that would replace the Ares-V but would not occur until 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/news/media/trans/obama_ksc_trans.html|title=President Barack Obama on Space Exploration in the 21st Century|date=15 April 2010|publisher=Office of the Press Secretary|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] drafted the [[NASA Authorization Act of 2010]] and President Obama signed it into law on October 11 of that year.&lt;ref name=nasa2010/&gt; The authorization act officially cancelled the Constellation program.&lt;ref name=nasa2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/75522/president-signs-nasa-2010-authorization-act/|title=Today–President Signs NASA 2010 Authorization Act|publisher=Universetoday.com|accessdate=November 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of Ares I and Orion was predicted to cost about 50 billion dollars.&lt;ref name="thespacereview.com"&gt;[http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1481/1]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the issues with Ares I was the criticism of the second stage, which the post-cancellation [[Liberty (rocket)|Liberty]] proposal attempted to address by using a second stage from an Ariane 5.&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/home/spacenews/files/747d9888e4ccb0ca7ddbc8ee25ce6564-335.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberty proposal applied for but was not chosen for commercial crew.&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt; The other ongoing complaint was that it made more sense to make a man-rated version of the Atlas or Delta.&lt;ref name="thespacereview.com"/&gt; The first crewed flight for Ares I was scheduled for March 2015, and one of its priorities was crew safety.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.space.com/7126-dumping-nasa-ares-rocket-cost-billions.html]&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the emphasis on safety was that it was envisioned in the aftermath of the Colombia disaster.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Current and future Space Shuttle successors==
[[File:Soyuz 19 (Apollo Soyuz Test Project) spacecraft.jpg|thumb|NASA's first direct action with the Soyuz was in 1975, as part of the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] (''pictured''). As the ISS lifeboat spacecraft all participants needed to train on it in the event of an emergency, if they stayed after the Shuttle left. NASA used the Soyuz concurrently with STS system as far back as 2000, and many other ISS participants have also used this spacecraft to access the space station]]

===Soyuz===

U.S. astronauts have continued to access the [[International Space Station|ISS]] aboard the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]].&lt;ref name="Chow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/13664-nasa-future-space-exploration-progress.html|title=U.S. Human Spaceflight Program Still Strong, NASA Chief Says|last=Chow|first=Denise|date=17 November 2011|publisher=Space.com|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soyuz was chosen as the ISS lifeboat during the development of the International Space Station.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/soyuz/#.WF2NmxKeZ_4]&lt;/ref&gt; The first NASA astronaut to launch on a Soyuz rocket was [[Norman Thagard]], as part of the [[Shuttle-Mir]] program.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/iss-lessons-learned/docs/crew_NASA_Astronauts_on_Soyuz.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Launching on March 14, 1995 on [[Soyuz TM-21]], he visited the [[Mir Space Station]] however he returned to Earth on the Space Shuttle mission [[STS-71]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/iss-lessons-learned/docs/crew_NASA_Astronauts_on_Soyuz.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The start of regular use of the Soyuz began as part of the international space station program, with [[William Shepherd]] launching on [[Soyuz TM-31]] in October 2000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/iss-lessons-learned/docs/crew_NASA_Astronauts_on_Soyuz.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; NASA has continued to take regular flights in the following two decades.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/iss-lessons-learned/docs/crew_NASA_Astronauts_on_Soyuz.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; NASA is currently contracted to use Soyuz seats until at least 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/astronaut-cost-per-soyuz-seat-2016-9]&lt;/ref&gt;

The consideration of Soyuz as a lifeboat began in the aftermath of the dissolution of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/iss-lessons-learned/docs/crew_NASA_Astronauts_on_Soyuz.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Russia proposed using the Soyuz as a life boat for what was still Space Station Freedom in late 1991, leading to further analysis of this concept in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/iss-lessons-learned/docs/crew_NASA_Astronauts_on_Soyuz.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the milestones was in 1992, when after three months of negotiations the heads of the two Space Agencies agreed to study applications of the Soyuz spacecraft.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/iss-lessons-learned/docs/crew_NASA_Astronauts_on_Soyuz.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In March 1992, Russian and US space officials discussed the possibility of cooperation in manned space program, including ACRV.  On June 18, 1992, after three months of negotiations, NASA Administrator Daniel S.

In the course of a few decades NASA astronauts have flown on the following Soyuz versions:
*[[Soyuz-TM]]
*[[Soyuz-TMA]] (and  Soyuz TMA-M)
*[[Soyuz MS]] (which had its first flight in 2016)&lt;ref name=rsw-soyuzms01&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/soyuz-ms-01.html |title=First Soyuz MS enters orbit |last=Zak |first=Anatoly |publisher=Russian Space Web |date=2016-07-07 |access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA also purchased several space modules from Russia including [[Spektr]], [[Mir Docking Module|Docking Module]] (Mir), [[Priroda]], and [[Zarya]].

===Orion and the SLS===
[[File:EFT-1 launch - view from pad.jpg|thumb|left|[[Orion Spacecraft|Orion]] test launches on a [[Delta IV Heavy]], 2014]]

The [[NASA Authorization Act of 2010]] required a new heavy–lift vehicle design to be chosen within 90 days of its passing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacenews.com/policy/110331-obama-administration-pushing-back-congressionally-mandated-rocket.html|title=Holdren: NASA Law Doesn't Square with Budgetary Reality|last=Svitak|first=Amy|date=31 March 2011|publisher=Space News|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authorization act called this new [[Heavy-lift launch vehicle|HLV]] the [[Space Launch System]] (SLS). The [[Orion spacecraft]] was left virtually unchanged from its previous design. The Space Launch System will launch both Orion and other necessary hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/systems/sls/sls1.html|title=NASA Announces Design for New Deep Space Exploration System|date=14 September 2011|publisher=NASA|accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SLS is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions.

Although the Orion spacecraft is oriented towards deep-space missions such as NEO visitation, it can also be used retrieve crew or supplies from the [[ISS]] if that task is needed once the spacecraft is operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.space.com|title=Orion Possibility}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is expected that the [[Commercial Crew Program]] (CCP) will produce a functioning manned space vehicle as early as 2018, providing an alternative to Orion or Soyuz. The delay is longer than expected because the [[Ares I]] was cancelled in 2010, leaving little time before the STS retired for something new to be ready for flight.&lt;ref name="nasaspaceflight.com"/&gt;  U.S. Congress was aware a spaceflight gap could occur and accelerated funding in 2008 and 2009 in preparation for the retirement of the Shuttle.&lt;ref name="nasaspaceflight.com"/&gt; At that time the first crewed flight of the planned Ares I launcher would not have occurred until 2015, and its first use at ISS until 2016.&lt;ref name="nasaspaceflight.com"/&gt; Another option that has been analyzed is to adapt Orion to a man-rated heavy launch vehicle like the Delta IV Heavy.&lt;ref name="thespacereview.com"/&gt; (see also [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle]]) Another spacecraft evaluated by NASA, and also for commercial crew, was the [[Liberty (rocket)|ATK Liberty]] rocket, which looked similar to Ares I and was based on [[Space Shuttle]] (SRB) and [[Ariane 5]] (core stage) components.&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"/&gt;

====Commercial Resupply Services====
{{Main|Commercial Resupply Services}}

In [[literary criticism]] and [[rhetoric]], a '''tautology''' is a statement which repeats the same idea, using near-synonymous morphemes, words, or phrases, that is, "saying the same thing twice".&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tautology and [[pleonasm]] are not consistently differentiated in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan Szymanek, "Remarks on Tautology in Word-Formation" in Laurie Bauer, ''et al.'', ''Semantics of Complex Words'', ''Studies in Morphology'' '''3''', 2015, {{isbn|3319141023}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XLkPBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146 p. 142]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[pleonasm]], it is often considered a fault of [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]] when unintentional. On the other hand, an intentional repetition may be an effective way to emphasize a thought, or help the listener or reader understand a point.&lt;ref name="bascom"&gt;John Bascom, ''Philosophy of Rhetoric'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y54CAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA241 p. 241]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sometimes [[tautology (logic)|logical tautologies]] like "Boys will be boys" are conflated with language tautologies, but in general, a rhetorical tautology is not inherently true.&lt;ref name="bascom"/&gt;

==Etymology==

The word was coined in Hellenistic Greek from ταὐτός ("the same") plus λόγος ("word/idea"), and transmitted through 3rd-century Latin ''tautologia'' and French ''tautologie''. It first appears in English in the 16th century. The use in the term [[tautology (logic)|logical tautology]] was introduced in English by [[Wittgenstein]] in 1919, perhaps following [[Auguste Comte]]'s usage in 1835.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 3rd edition, 2014, [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/198205 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* "With malice toward none, with charity for all," from [[Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Ament, "Glossary of Rhetorical Terms" [https://mcl.as.uky.edu/glossary-rhetorical-terms]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
Intentional repetition of meaning intends to amplify or emphasize a particular, usually significant, fact about what is being discussed. For example, a [[gift]] is, by definition, free of charge; using the phrase "free gift" might emphasize that there are no hidden conditions or [[fine print]], be it the expectation of money or reciprocation, or that the gift is being given by [[volition (psychology)|volition]].

This is related to the [[rhetoric]]al device of [[hendiadys]], where one concept is expressed through the use of two descriptive words or phrases.  For example, "goblets and gold" meaning wealth, or "this day and age" meaning the present time. Superficially these expressions may seem tautological, but they are stylistically sound because the repeated meaning is just a way to emphasize the same idea.

The use of tautologies is, however, usually unintentional. For example, the phrases "mental telepathy", "planned conspiracies", and "small dwarfs" imply that there are such things as "physical telepathy, spontaneous conspiracies, and giant dwarfs."&lt;ref name=Kallan&gt;{{cite book|last=Kallan|first=Richard|title=Armed Gunmen, True Facts, and Other Ridiculous Nonsense: A Compiled Compendium of Repetitive Redundancies|year=2005|publisher=Pantheon Books|isbn=0-375-42352-4|page=x}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[Parallelism (rhetoric)|Parallelism]] is not tautology, but rather a particular stylistic device. Much [[Old Testament]] [[poetry]] is based on [[Parallelism (rhetoric)|parallelism]]: the same thing said twice, but in slightly different ways (Fowler&lt;ref name="Fowler"/&gt; puts it as [[pleonasm]]). However, modern biblical study emphasizes that there are subtle distinctions and developments between the two lines, such that they are usually not truly the "same thing." Parallelism can be found wherever there is poetry in the Bible: [[Psalms]], the [[Books of the Prophets]], and in other areas as well.

'''Toddler's fractures''' or '''childhood accidental spiral tibial (CAST) fractures''' are [[bone fracture]]s of the [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|distal]] (lower) part of the shin bone ([[tibia]]) in toddlers (aged 9 months-3 years) and other young children (less than 8 years).&lt;ref name="pmid10532655"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mellick LB, Milker L, Egsieker E |title=Childhood accidental spiral tibial (CAST) fractures |journal=Pediatr Emerg Care |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=307–9 |date=October 1999 |pmid=10532655 |doi= 10.1097/00006565-199910000-00001|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fracture is found in the distal two thirds of the tibia in 95% of cases,&lt;ref name="pmid10532655"/&gt; is undisplaced and has a spiral pattern. It occurs after low-energy [[Physical trauma|trauma]], sometimes with a rotational component.

==Pathophysiology==
The proposed mechanism involves [[shear stress]] and lack of displacement due to the [[periosteum]] that is relatively strong compared to the elastic bone in young children.&lt;ref name="pmid7763080"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sarmah A |title='Toddler's fracture'?

==Diagnosis==
Typical symptoms include [[pain]], refusing to walk or bear weight and [[limping]] -[[bruising]] and deformity are absent. On [[clinical examination]], there can be warmth and swelling over the fracture area, as well as pain on bending the foot upwards ([[dorsiflexion]]). The initial [[Radiography|radiographical images]] may be inconspicuous (a faint oblique line) and often even completely normal.&lt;ref name="pmid11242240"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halsey MF, Finzel KC, Carrion WV, Haralabatos SS, Gruber MA, Meinhard BP |title=Toddler's fracture: presumptive diagnosis and treatment |journal=J Pediatr Orthop |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=152–6 |year=2001 |pmid=11242240 |doi= 10.1097/00004694-200103000-00003|url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0271-6798&amp;volume=21&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1–2 weeks however, [[Fibrocartilage callus|callus]] formation develops. The condition can be mistaken for [[osteomyelitis]], [[transient synovitis]] or even [[child abuse]]. Contrary to CAST fractures, [[non-accidental injury]] typically affect the upper two-thirds or midshaft of the tibia.

Other possible fractures in this area, occurring in the [[cuboid bone|cuboid]], [[calcaneus]], and [[fibula]], can be associated or can be mistaken for a toddler's fracture.&lt;ref name="pmid10954515"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Donnelly LF |title=Toddler's fracture of the fibula |journal=AJR Am J Roentgenol |volume=175 |issue=3 |pages=922 |date=September 2000 |pmid=10954515 |doi= 10.2214/ajr.175.3.1750922|url=http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10954515}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, an internal oblique radiography and [[radionuclide imaging]] can add information to anterior-posterior and lateral views.&lt;ref name="pmid2044585"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=De Boeck K, Van Eldere S, De Vos P, Mortelmans L, Casteels-Van Daele M |title=Radionuclide bone imaging in toddler's fracture |journal=Eur.

==Treatment==

Some notable historical examples include [[anti-lock braking system]]s,&lt;ref name="Braunstein"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-12-13/topic/9012120066_1_anti-lock-braking-traction-control-abs |title=Anti-lock Brakes No Longer A Luxury Limited To Luxury Cars |newspaper=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=1990-12-13  |author= Braunstein, Janet |accessdate= April 14, 2015| quote=Once exclusively for buyers of ultra-expensive, usually imported luxury cars, anti-lock brakes are filtering down into more affordable models.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[electronic stability control]]&lt;ref name="MyUser_Autobytel.com_April_14_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autobytel.com/car-ownership/stabilitrak-general-motors-stability-control-104048/ |title=StabiliTrak |publisher=[[Autobytel]]|year=2007 |author= |accessdate= April 14, 2015| quote=StabiliTrak is the trademark name for General Motors' electronic stability control system.

A more recent example is the [[Apple watch]] which is initially offered as a luxury item, but if the Varian Rule holds, it will be more accessible in the near future according to [[Paul Krugman]], Nobel Laureate, and blogger and columnist for ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Newitz"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://gizmodo.com/wearables-are-all-about-giving-you-a-rich-person-exper-1697505261 |title=Wearables Are All About Giving You a "Rich Person Experience" |publisher=[[gizmodo.com]] |date= 2015-04-13|author= Newitz, Annalee|accessdate= April 14, 2015 | quote = Over the weekend, economist Paul Krugman ... explains why Apple is emphasizing wealth and luxury in its Apple Watch campaigns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9475">'''Wind engineering''' is a subsets of [[mechanical engineering]], [[structural engineering]], [[meteorology]], and [[applied physics]] to analyze the  effects of [[wind]] in the natural and the [[built environment]] and studies the possible damage, inconvenience or benefits which may result from wind. In the field of engineering it includes strong winds, which may cause discomfort, as well as extreme winds, such as in a [[tornado]], [[hurricane]] or [[Superstorm|heavy storm]], which may cause widespread destruction. In the fields of [[wind energy]] and [[air pollution]] it also includes low and moderate winds as these are relevant to electricity production resp. dispersion of contaminants.

Wind engineering draws upon [[meteorology]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[mechanics]], [[geographic information system]]s and a number of specialist [[engineering]] disciplines including [[aerodynamics]], and [[structural dynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hewitt|first=Sam|last2=Margetts|first2=Lee|last3=Revell|first3=Alistair|date=2017-04-18|title=Building a Digital Wind Farm|journal=Archives of Computational Methods in Engineering|volume=25|issue=4|language=en|pages=1–21|doi=10.1007/s11831-017-9222-7|issn=1134-3060}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tools used include [[atmospheric model]]s, atmospheric boundary layer [[wind tunnel]]s, and [[computational fluid dynamics]] models.

Wind engineering involves, among other topics:
* Wind impact on structures (buildings, bridges, towers).
* Wind comfort near buildings.
* Effects of wind on the ventilation system in a building.
* Wind climate for wind energy.
* Air pollution near buildings.

Wind engineering may be considered by structural engineers to be closely related to [[earthquake engineering]] and [[explosion protection]].

Some sports stadiums such as [[Candlestick Park]] and [[Arthur Ashe Stadium]] are known for their strong, sometimes swirly winds, which affect the playing conditions.

==History==
Wind engineering as a separate discipline can be traced to the UK in the 1960s, when informal meetings were held at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]], the Building Research Establishment and elsewhere.

==Wind loads on buildings==
The design of buildings must account for wind loads, and these are affected by [[wind shear]].
&lt;!-- Note that although Wind loading exists, but is only a redirect back to this page. --&gt;
For engineering purposes, a power law wind-speed profile may be defined as follows:&lt;ref name=Crawley&gt;{{cite book | last = Crawley | first = Stanley | title = Steel Buildings | publisher = Wiley | location = New York | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-471-84298-9 | pages = 272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gupta&gt;{{cite book | last = Gupta | first = Ajaya Kumar and Peter James Moss| title = Guidelines for Design of Low-Rise Buildings Subjected to Lateral Forces | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-8493-8969-6 | pages = 49|url=http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9780849389696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ v_z = v_g \cdot \left( \frac {z} {z_g} \right)^ \frac {1} {\alpha}, 0 &lt; z &lt; z_g
&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\ v_z&lt;/math&gt; = speed of the wind at height &lt;math&gt;\ z&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ v_g&lt;/math&gt; = gradient wind at gradient height &lt;math&gt;\ z_g &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ \alpha&lt;/math&gt; = exponential coefficient
&lt;br /&gt;
Typically, buildings are designed to resist a strong wind with a very long return period, such as 50 years or more. The design wind speed is determined from historical records using [[extreme value theory]] to predict future extreme wind speeds.

==Wind comfort==
The advent of high rise [[tower blocks]] led to concerns regarding the wind nuisance caused by these buildings to pedestrians in their vicinity.

A number of wind comfort and wind danger criteria were developed from 1971, based on different pedestrian activities such as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://sts.bwk.tue.nl/urbanphysics/pdf/2013_BAE_WD_BB_TvH_Preprint.pdf Pedestrian wind comfort around buildings: comparison of wind comfort criteria. Table 3]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sitting for a long period of time
* Sitting for a short period of time
* Strolling
* Walking fast
Other criteria classified a wind environment as completely unacceptable or dangerous.

Building geometries consisting of one and two rectangular buildings have a number of well-known effects:&lt;ref&gt;[http://sts.bwk.tue.nl/urbanphysics/pdf/2013_BAE_WD_BB_TvH_Preprint.pdf Pedestrian wind comfort around buildings: comparison of wind comfort criteria. Figure 6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkisc.org/proceedings/2006421/6_Johnny_Yu%20Wind%20Effect%20on%20Pedestrians.pdf Wind Effects On Pedestrians. Figure 3]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Corner streams, also known as corner jets, around the corners of buildings
* Through-flow, also known as a passage jet, in any passage through a building or small gap between two buildings due to pressure short-circuiting
* Vortex shedding in the wake of buildings

For more complex geometries, pedestrian wind comfort studies are required.  These can use an appropriately scaled model in a boundary layer [[wind tunnel]], or more recently there has been increased use of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) techniques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aij.or.jp/jpn/publish/cfdguide/JWEIAguide.pdf AIJ guidelines for practical applications of CFD to pedestrian wind environment around buildings]&lt;/ref&gt; The pedestrian level wind speeds for a given exceedance probability are calculated to allow for regional wind speeds statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cmff.hu/oktatas/tantargy/NEPTUN/BMEGEATMW08/2010-2011-1/ea_lecture/blocken_pedestrianWindEnvironment.pdf Pedestrian Wind Environment Around Buildings. p112]&lt;/ref&gt;

The vertical wind profile used in these studies varies according to the terrain in the vicinity of the buildings (which is may differ by wind direction), and is often grouped in categories such as:&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.resource.org/pub/nz/ibr/as-nzs.1170.2.2011.pdf AS/NZS 1170.2:2011 Structural Design Actions Part 2 – Wind actions. Section 4.2]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exposed open terrain with few or no obstructions and water surfaces at serviceability wind speeds.
* Water surfaces, open terrain, grassland with few, well-scattered obstructions having heights generally from 1.5 m to 10m.
* Terrain with numerous closely spaced obstructions 3 m to 5 m high, such as areas of suburban housing.
* Terrain with numerous large, high (10 m to 30 m high) and closely spaced obstructions, such as large city centres and well-developed industrial complexes.

==Wind turbines==

[[Wind turbine]]s are affected by wind shear. Vertical wind-speed profiles result in different wind speeds at the blades nearest to the ground level compared to those at the top of blade travel, and this in turn affects the turbine operation.&lt;ref name=Heier&gt;{{cite book | last = Heier | first = Siegfried | title = Grid Integration of Wind Energy Conversion Systems | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-470-86899-7 | pages = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wind gradient can create a large bending moment in the shaft of a two bladed turbine when the blades are vertical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Harrison | first = Robert | title = Large Wind Turbines | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | location = Chichester | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-471-49456-0 | pages = 30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduced wind gradient over water means shorter and less expensive wind turbine towers can be used in shallow seas.&lt;ref name=Lubosny&gt;{{cite book | last = Lubosny | first = Zbigniew | title = Wind Turbine Operation in Electric Power Systems: Advanced Modeling | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-3-540-40340-1 | pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For wind turbine engineering, wind speed variation with height is often approximated using a power law:&lt;ref name=Heier/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ v_w(h) = v_{ref} \cdot \left( \frac {h} {h_{ref}} \right)^ a
&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;\ v_w(h)&lt;/math&gt; = velocity of the wind at height &lt;math&gt; h&lt;/math&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[m/s]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ v_{ref}&lt;/math&gt; = velocity of the wind at some reference height &lt;math&gt; h_{ref} &lt;/math&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;[m/s]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ a&lt;/math&gt; = Hellman exponent (aka power law exponent or shear exponent) (~= 1/7 in neutral flow, but can be &gt;1)

==Significance==
The knowledge of wind engineering is used to analyze and design all [[high rise]] buildings, cable [[suspension bridge]]s and [[cable-stayed bridge]]s, electricity transmission towers and [[telecommunication tower]]s and all other types of towers and chimneys. The wind load is the dominant load in the analysis of many tall buildings. So wind engineering is essential for the analysis and design of tall buildings. Again, wind load is a dominant load in the analysis and design of all long-span [[cable bridge]]s.

'''Ângelo Moreira da Costa Lima''' (1887–1964) was the foremost Brazilian entomologist of his time, and his still-consulted works continue to assure his place in the history of science as the "Father" of Brazilian entomology.

==Life==
Costa Lima, as he is called in Brazil, was born on June 29, 1887, in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], to Valeriano Moreira da Costa Lima and Rosa Delfina Brum de Lima.

==Works==
*  The legacy of Costa Lima rests on his many contributions to Brazilian entomology. His ''Terceiro Catálogo'' was for many years the most consulted work on Brazilian plant-insect associations. It has since been replaced by the ''Quarto Catálogo'' that was directly based on Costa Lima's earlier work.
*  Costa Lima’s ''Insetos do Brasil'' in eleven volumes is a valuable resource on Brazilian entomology and is regularly consulted even today.
*  Honorary Fellow of the [http://www.tropicalbio.org Association for Tropical Biology (and Conservation)] 1963,
