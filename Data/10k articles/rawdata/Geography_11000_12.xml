{{refimprove|date=November 2016}}
[[File:Herodotus world map-en.svg|thumb|350px|The [[ecumene|inhabited]] world according to [[Herodotus]]: ''Libya'' (Africa) is imagined as extending no further south than the Horn of Africa, terminating in uninhabitable desert. All peoples inhabiting the southernmost fringes of the inhabitable world are known as ''Ethiopians'' (after their dark skin). At the extreme south-east of the continent are the [[Macrobians]], so called for their longevity.]]
Ancient '''Aethiopia''' ({{lang-gr|Αἰθιοπία}} ''Aithiopia'') first appears as a geographical term in classical documents in reference to the upper [[Nile]] region, as well as all certain areas south of the [[Sahara]] desert and south of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Its earliest mention is in the works of [[Homer]]: twice in the ''[[Iliad]]'',&lt;ref name=Homer1/&gt; and three times in the ''[[Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name=Homer2/&gt; The Greek historian [[Herodotus]] specifically uses the appellation to refer to such parts of [[Africa]] as were then known within the [[Ecumene|inhabitable world]].&lt;ref name=Herodotus1/&gt; 

In classical antiquity, ''Africa'' (or ''[[Ancient Libya]]'') referred to what is now known as the [[Maghreb]] and south of the [[Libyan Desert]] and [[Western Sahara]], including all the desert land west of the southern Nile river. Geographical knowledge of the continent gradually grew, with the first century AD Greek travelogue the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' describing areas along the [[Red Sea]] (Erythraean Sea). The [[Greek language|Greek]] name Αἰθιοπία (from {{lang|grc|Αἰθίοψ}}, ''Aithiops'', 'an Ethiopian') is a compound word, derived from the two Greek words, from {{lang|grc|αἴθω}} + {{lang|grc|ὤψ}}  (''aitho'' "I burn" + ''ops'' "face"). According to the Perseus Digital Library, the designation properly translates as ''Burnt-face'' in noun form and ''red-brown'' in adjectival form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%232329&amp;redirect=true |contribution=Aithiops|first1=Henry George|last1=Liddell|first2=Robert|last2=Scott|title=A Greek-English Lexicon|publisher=Perseus|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used as a vague term for dark-skinned populations since the time of [[Homeric Greek|Homer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*ai%29qi%2Foy Αἰθίοψ] in Liddell, Scott, ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]'': "Αἰθίοψ , οπος, ὁ, fem. Αἰθιοπίς , ίδος, ἡ (Αἰθίοψ as fem., A.Fr.328, 329): pl. 'Αἰθιοπῆες' Il.1.423, whence nom. 'Αἰθιοπεύς' Call.Del.208: (αἴθω, ὄψ):— properly, Burnt-face, i.e. Ethiopian, negro, Hom., etc.; prov., Αἰθίοπα σμήχειν 'to wash a blackamoor white', Luc.Ind. 28." Cf. ''[[Etymologicum Genuinum]]'' s.v. {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:Αἰθίοψ|]]}}, ''Etymologicum Gudianum'' s.v.v. {{lang|grc|Αἰθίοψ}}. {{cite book|title=Etymologicum Magnum|language=Greek|chapter=Αἰθίοψ|url=https://archive.org/stream/etymologikontome00etymuoft#page/n34/mode/1up|place=Leipzig|year=1818}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fage2526"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fage|first1=John|title=A History of Africa|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317797272|pages=25–26|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=mXa4AQAAQBAJ|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was applied to such dark-skinned populations as came within the range of observation of the ancient geographers i.e. primarily in what was then [[Nubia]], and with the expansion of geographical knowledge, successively extended to certain other areas below the Sahara.

==Before Herodotus==
[[Homer]] (c. 8th century BC) is the first to mention "Aethiopians" (Αἰθίοπες, Αἰθιοπῆες); he mentions that they are to be found at the east and west extremities of the world, divided by the sea into "eastern" (at the sunrise) and "western" (at the sunset). In Rhapsody A of the [[Iliad]], [[Thetis]] visits [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to meet [[Zeus]], but the meeting is postponed, as Zeus and other gods are absent, visiting the land of the Aethiopians. [[Hesiod]] (c. 8th century BC) speaks of [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]] as the "king of Aethiopia".{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 515 BC, [[Scylax of Caryanda]], on orders from [[Darius I]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], sailed along the [[Indus River]], [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Red Sea]], circumnavigating the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. He mentioned "Aethiopians", but his writings on them have not survived. [[Hecataeus of Miletus]] (c. 500 BC) is also said to have written a book about Aethiopia, but his writing is now known only through quotations from later authors. He stated that Aethiopia was located to the east of the Nile, as far as the Red Sea and Indian Ocean; he is also quoted as relating a myth that the [[Monopod (creature)|Skiapods]] ("Shade feet") lived there, whose feet were supposedly large enough to serve as shade.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

==In Herodotus==
In his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' (c. 440 BC) Herodotus presents some of the most ancient and detailed information about "Aethiopia".&lt;ref name=Herodotus1/&gt; He relates that he personally traveled up the Nile to the border of Egypt as far as [[Elephantine]] (modern [[Aswan]]); in his view, "Aethiopia" is all of the inhabited land found to the south of Egypt, beginning at Elephantine. He describes a capital at [[Meroë]], adding that the only deities worshipped there were [[Zeus]] ([[Amun]]) and [[Dionysus]] ([[Osiris]]). He relates that in the reign of Pharaoh [[Psamtik I]] (c. 650 BCE), many Egyptian soldiers deserted their country and settled amidst the Aethiopians. 

Herodotus tells us that king [[Cambyses II]] (c. 570 BC) of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] sent spies to the Aethiopians "who dwelt in that part of [[Ancient Libya|Libya]] (Africa) which borders upon the southern sea." They found a strong and healthy people. Although Cambyses then campaigned toward their country, by not preparing enough provisions for the long march, his army completely failed and returned quickly.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In Book 3, Herodotus defines "Aethiopia" as the farthest region of "Libya" (i.e. Africa): "Where the south declines towards the setting sun lies the country called Aethiopia, the last inhabited land in that direction. There [[gold]] is obtained in great plenty, huge [[elephant]]s abound, with wild trees of all sorts, and [[ebony]]; and the men are taller, handsomer, and longer lived than anywhere else."&lt;ref name=Herodotus2/&gt;

==Other Greco-Roman historians==
The Egyptian priest [[Manetho]] (c. 300 BC) listed Kushite (25th) dynasty, calling it the "Aethiopian dynasty". Moreover, when the [[Hebrew Bible]] was translated into Greek (c. 200 BC), the Hebrew appellation "Kush, Kushite" became in Greek "Aethiopia, Aethiopians", appearing as "Ethiopia, Ethiopians" in the English ''[[King James Version]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+12%3A1-10&amp;version=KJV KJV: Book of Numbers 12 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agatharchides]] provides a relatively detailed description of the gold mining system of Aethiopia. His text was copied almost verbatim by virtually all subsequent ancient writers on the area, including [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]].&lt;ref name="Jotras"&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland|date=1892|publisher=Cambridge University Press for the Royal Asiatic Society|page=823|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=Y2mFAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the Ethiopians, [[Strabo]] indicates that they looked similar to Indians, remarking "those who are in Asia (South India), and those who are in Africa, do not differ from each other."&lt;ref name="Turner480482"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Sharon|title=The Sacred History of the World, as Displayed in the Creation and Subsequent Events to the Deluge: Attempted to be Philosophically Considered, in a Series of Letters to a Son, Volume 2|date=1834|publisher=Longman|pages=480–482|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=hpc5AAAAcAAJ|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in turn asserts that the place-name "Aethiopia" was derived from one "Aethiop, a son of Vulcan"&lt;ref name="Turner480482"/&gt; [the smith-god [[Hephaestus]]&lt;ref name=Plinius1/&gt;]. He also writes that the "Queen of the Ethiopians" bore the title [[Kandake]], and avers that the Ethiopians had conquered ancient [[Syria]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. Following Strabo, the Greco-Roman historian [[Eusebius]] notes that the Ethiopians had emigrated into the [[Red Sea]] area from the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]] and that there were no people in the region by that name prior to their arrival.&lt;ref name="Turner480482"/&gt;

The first century AD Greek travelogue known as the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' first describes the [[Horn of Africa]] littoral, based on its author's intimate knowledge of the area. The ''Periplus'' does not mention any dark-skinned "Ethiopians" among the area's inhabitants. They only later appear in [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'', but in a region far south, around the "Bantu nucleus" of northern [[Mozambique]]. According to [[John Donnelly Fage]], these early Greek documents altogether suggest that the original inhabitants of [[Azania]], the "Azanians", were of the same ancestral stock as the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]]-speaking populations to the north of them in the ancient [[Barbara (region)|Barbara]] region along the Red Sea. Subsequently, by the tenth century, these original "Azanians" had been replaced by early waves of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] settlers.&lt;ref name="Fage2526"/&gt;

==Greek and medieval literature==
Several notable personalities in Greek and medieval literature were identified as Aethiopian, including several rulers, male and female: [[Memnon (mythology)|Memnon]] and his brother [[Emathion]], King of [[Arabia]]. [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and [[Cassiopeia (mythology)|Cassiopeia]], parents of [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]], were named as king and queen of Aethiopia. Homer in his description of the Trojan War mentions several other Aethiopians. In some cults of the youngest Olympian god, [[Dionysus]], his maternal origins are believed to be Aethiopia.{{fact|date=January 2018}} [[Ptolemy]] the geographer and other ancient Greek commentators believed that the "Aethiopian [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]]" was where the gods lived when they were not in Greece.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

He lived during the Islamic Golden Age, which promoted astronomy and encouraged all scholars to work on their research.&lt;ref name="The Science of Al-Biruni" /&gt; Al-Biruni spent the first twenty-five years of his life in Khwarezm where he studied [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], theology, grammar, [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[medicine]], philosophy and also dabbled in the field of physics and most other sciences as well.&lt;ref name="EirLife" /&gt; The [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Khwarezmian language]], which was the language of Biruni,{{sfn|Strohmaier|2006|p=112|quote="Although his native Khwarezmian was also an [[Iranian language]], he rejected the emerging neo-Persian literature of his time (Firdawsi), preferring Arabic instead as the only adequate medium of science."}}{{sfn|MacKenzie|2011}} survived for several centuries after [[Islam]] until the Turkification of the region, and so must some at least of the culture and lore of ancient [[Khwarezm]], for it is hard to see the commanding figure of Biruni, a repository of so much knowledge, appearing in a cultural vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bosworth |first=C.E. |title=Ḵh̲ W Ārazm}} in {{harvnb|Bearman|Bianquis|Bosworth|2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sympathetic to the [[Afrighids]], who were overthrown by the rival dynasty of [[Ma'munids]] in 995. He left his homeland for [[Bukhara]], then under the [[Samanid]] ruler Mansur II the son of Nuh.

In 998, he went to the court of the [[Ziyarid]] amir of Tabaristan, [[Shams al-Mo'ali Abol-hasan Ghaboos ibn Wushmgir]]. There he wrote his first important work, ''al-Athar al-Baqqiya 'an al-Qorun al-Khaliyya'' (literally: "The remaining traces of past centuries" and translated as "Chronology of ancient nations" or "Vestiges of the Past") on historical and scientific chronology, probably around 1000 A.D., though he later made some amendments to the book. He also visited the court of the [[Bavandid]] ruler [[Al-Marzuban]]. Accepting the definite demise of the Afrighids at the hands of the Ma'munids, he made peace with the latter who then ruled [[Khwarezm]].  Their court at Gorganj (also in Khwarezm) was gaining fame for its gathering of brilliant scientists.

In 1017, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] took Rey. Most scholars, including al-Biruni, were taken to Ghazni,  the capital of the Ghaznavid dynasty.&lt;ref name="The Exact Sciences 1999" /&gt; Biruni was made court astrologer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=fUFhtQEACAAJ |page=68}} |title=The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization |last=Hodgson |first=Marshall G.

Ninety-five of 146 books known to have been written by Bīrūnī were devoted to astronomy, mathematics, and related subjects like mathematical geography.{{sfn|Saliba|1989}} His religion contributed to his research of astronomy, as in Islam, worship and prayer require knowing the precise directions of sacred locations, which can only be accurately found using astronomical data.&lt;ref name="The Science of Al-Biruni" /&gt; Biruni's major work on astrology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=

In discussing speculation by other Muslim writers on the possible motion of the Earth, Biruni acknowledged that he could neither prove nor disprove it, but commented favourably on the idea that the Earth rotates.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas ([[#CITEREFDouglas1973|1973, p.210]])&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote an extensive commentary on [[Indian astronomy]] in the ''Tahqiq ma li-l-hind'' mostly translation of Aryabhatta's work, in which he claims to have resolved the matter of Earth's rotation in a work on astronomy that is no longer extant, his ''Miftah-ilm-alhai'a (Key to Astronomy)'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[T]he rotation of the earth does in no way impair the value of astronomy, as all appearances of an astronomic character can quite as well be explained according to this theory as to the other. There are, however, other reasons which make it impossible. This question is most difficult to solve. The most prominent of both modern and ancient astronomers have deeply studied the question of the moving of the earth, and tried to refute it. We, too, have composed a book on the subject called ''Miftah-ilm-alhai'a (Key to Astronomy)'', in which we think we have surpassed our predecessors, if not in the words, at all events in the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Biruni, trans. by [[Eduard Sachau|Edward C. Sachau]] (1888), Alberuni's India: an account of the religion, philosophy, and literature, p.277&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his description of [[Sijzi#Astronomy|Sijzi's astrolabe]] he hints at contemporary debates over the movement of the earth. He carried on a lengthy correspondence and sometimes heated debate with [[Ibn Sina]], in which Biruni repeatedly attacks [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotle's celestial physics]]: he argues by simple experiment that vacuum must exist;{{sfn|Berjak|2005|loc=part 5}} he is "amazed" by the weakness of Aristotle's argument against elliptical orbits on the basis that they would create vacuum;{{sfn|Berjak|2005|loc=part 3}} he attacks the immutability of the celestial spheres;{{sfn|Berjak|2005|loc=part 8}} and so on.

In his major extant astronomical work, the ''Mas'ud Canon'', Biruni utilizes his observational data to disprove Ptolemy's immobile solar [[apogee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1974JHA.....5..135R&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=0&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_VIEW&amp;classic=YES |title=Book review of ''Life and Works of al-Buruni'' by P.

== Physics ==
"Al-Biruni contributed to the introduction of the [[experiment]]al [[scientific method]] to [[mechanics]], unified [[statics]] and [[Dynamics (physics)|dynamics]] into the science of mechanics,{{sfn|Alikuzai|2013|quote="Al-Biruni contributed to the introduction of the experimental scientifique method to mechanics.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Dy897SeErOQC|page=642}}|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science|editor-first=Rāshid|editor-last=Rushdī|date=1996|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780415124119|language=en|first1= Mariam |last1=Rozhanskaya |first2=I. S. |last2=Levinova |title=Statics| p= 642|quote=
Using a whole body of mathematical methods (not only those inherited from the antique theory of ratios and infinitesimal techniques, but also the methods of the contemporary algebra and fine calculation techniques), Muslim scientists raised statics to a new, higher level. The classical results of Archimedes in the theory of the centre of gravity were generalized and applied to three-dimensional bodies, the theory of ponderable lever was founded and the 'science of gravity' was created and later further developed in medieval Europe. The phenomena of statics were studied by using the dynamic approach so that two trends – statics and dynamics – turned out to be inter-related within a single science, mechanics. The combination of the dynamic approach with Archimedean hydrostatics gave birth to a direction in science which may be called medieval hydrodynamics. [...] Numerous fine experimental methods were developed for determining the specific weight, which were based, in particular, on the theory of balances and weighing. The classical works of al-Biruni and al-Khazini can by right be considered as the beginning of the application of experimental methods in medieval science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and combined the fields of [[hydrostatics]] with dynamics to create [[hydrodynamics]].{{sfn|Alikuzai|2013|quote="Al-Biruni contributed to the introduction of the experimental scientifique method to mechanics, unified statics and dynamics into the science of mechanics and combined the fields of hydrostatics with dynamics to create hydrodynamics."}} He came up with different methods for exploring densities, weight, and even gravity. Along with those methods, Biruni went so far as to describe instruments that go along with each of those areas as well. Although he never entirely focuses just on physics in any of his books, the study of physics is present throughout many of his various works. Biruni also came up with different hypotheses about heat and light.&lt;ref name="The Science of Al-Biruni" /&gt;

== Geography ==
{{See also|History of geodesy#Al-Biruni}}

[[File:AzerbazkanBiruni.JPG|thumb|250px|Four directions and Political divisions of Iran by Abū Rayḥān al-Bīrūnī]]
Bīrūnī devised a method of determining the earth's radius by means of the observation of the height of a mountain. He carried it out at [[Nandana]] in [[Pind Dadan Khan]] in [[Pakistan]].{{sfn|Pingree|1989}} He was heavily interested in the workings of the earth and included research about the planet in many of his works. The result of his discovery of radius measurement was due to Biruni's arduous research about the earth.&lt;ref name="The Science of Al-Biruni" /&gt;

In his ''Codex Masudicus'' (1037), Al-Biruni theorized the existence of a landmass along the vast ocean between [[Asia]] and [[Europe]], or what is today known as the [[Americas]]. He deduced its existence on the basis of his accurate estimations of the [[Earth's circumference]] and [[Afro-Eurasia]]'s size, which he found spanned only two-fifths of the Earth's circumference, and his discovery of the concept of [[specific gravity]], from which he deduced that the geological processes that gave rise to [[Eurasia]] must've also given rise to lands in the vast ocean between Asia and Europe. He also theorized that the landmass must be inhabited by human beings, which he deduced from his knowledge of humans inhabiting the broad north-south band stretching from [[Russia]] to [[South India]] and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], theorizing that the landmass would most likely lie along the same band.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/s-frederick-starr/so-who-did-discover-america|date= 12 December 2013|title=So, Who Did Discover America? {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2018-07-06|first=S. Frederick |last=Starr|authorlink=S. Frederick Starr |volume =63 |issue =12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pharmacology and mineralogy ==

Biruni's most important work was a major [[pharmacopoeia]], the "Kitab al-saydala fi al-tibb" (Book on the Pharmacopoeia of Medicine), describing essentially all the medicines known in his time. It lists synonyms for drug names in Syriac, Persian, Greek, Baluchi, Afghan, Kurdi, and some Indian languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kujundzić, E. |author2=Masić, I. |title=[Al-Biruni—a universal scientist]|journal=Med.

Due to an apparatus he constructed himself, he succeeded in determining the [[specific gravity]] of a certain number of metals and minerals with remarkable precision.{{sfn|Anawati|1989}}

== History and chronology ==
Biruni's main essay on political history, ''Kitāb al-musāmara fī aḵbār Ḵᵛārazm'' (Book of nightly conversation concerning the affairs of Ḵᵛārazm) is now known only from quotations in Bayhaqī's Tārīkh-e masʿūdī. In addition to this various discussions of historical events and methodology are found in connection with the lists of kings in his al-Āthār al-bāqiya and in the Qānūn as well as elsewhere in the Āthār, in India, and scattered throughout his other works.{{sfn|Pingree|2010}}
Al-Biruni's study of history was not limited to the aforementioned topics, he also touched upon the topic of the earth's creation. He elaborated upon the fact that the earth was created from the elements and not solely through divine creation. Even though Islam did influence his study, he did acknowledge the role of the elements.&lt;ref name="The Science of Al-Biruni" /&gt;

== History of religions ==

Bīrūnī is one of the most important Muslim authorities on the history of religion.{{sfn|de Blois|2010}} Al-Biruni was a pioneer in the study of comparative religion. He studied [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Christianity]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]], and other religions. He treated religions objectively, striving to understand them on their own terms rather than trying to prove them wrong. His underlying concept was that all cultures are at least distant relatives of all other cultures because they are all human constructs. "What al-Biruni seems to be arguing is that there is a common human element in every culture that makes all cultures distant relatives, however foreign they might seem to one another."{{sfn|Rosenthal|1976|p=10}}

Al-Biruni divides [[Hindus]] into an educated and an uneducated class. He describes the educated as monotheistic, believing that God is one, eternal, and omnipotent and eschewing all forms of idol worship. He recognizes that uneducated Hindus worshipped a multiplicity of idols yet points out that even some Muslims (such as the Jabiriyya) have adopted [[anthropomorphic]] concepts of God.{{sfn|Ataman|2005}}

== Anthropology ==

Al-Biruni wrote about the peoples, customs and religions of the Indian subcontinent.
According to Akbar S. Ahmed, like modern anthropologists, he engaged in extensive participant observation with a given group of people, learnt their language and studied their primary texts, presenting his findings with objectivity and neutrality using cross-cultural comparisons.
Akhbar S. Ahmed concluded that Al-Biruni can be considered as the first Anthropologist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Akbar S.|date=1984|title=Al-Beruni: The First Anthropologist|jstor=3033407|journal=RAIN|issue=60|pages=9–10|doi=10.2307/3033407}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, others argue that he hardly can be considered an anthropologist in the conventional sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tapper|first=Richard|date=1995|title="Islamic Anthropology" and the "Anthropology of Islam"|jstor=3318074|journal=Anthropological Quarterly|volume=68|issue=3|pages=185–193|doi=10.2307/3318074}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indology ==
Bīrūnī's fame as an Indologist rests primarily on two texts.{{sfn|Lawrence|1989}} Al-Biruni wrote an encyclopedic work on India called ''Taḥqīq mā li-l-hind min maqūlah maqbūlah fī al-ʿaql aw mardhūlah'' (variously translated as "Verifying All That the Indians Recount, the Reasonable and the Unreasonable"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica|title=Al-Bīrūnī|author=George Saliba|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/al-Biruni|access-date=Aug 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "The book confirming what pertains to India, whether rational or despicable"{{sfn|Lawrence|1989}}) in which he explored nearly every aspect of Indian life, including religion, history, geography, geology, science, and mathematics. During his journey through India, military and political histories were not of Al-Biruni's main focus. Instead, he decided to document the more civilian and scholarly areas of Hindu life such as culture, science, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khan|first1=M.S.|title=Al-biruni and the Political History of India|journal=Oriens|date=1976|volume=25/26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explores religion within a rich cultural context.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khan|first1=M.S.|title=Al-Biruni and the Political History of India|journal=Oriens|date=1976|volume=25/26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expresses his objective with simple eloquence: He also translated the works of Indian sage [[Patanjali]] with the title  ''Tarjamat ketāb Bātanjalī fi’l-ḵalāṣ men al-ertebāk''.

{{quote|I shall not produce the arguments of our antagonists in order to refute such of them, as I believe to be in the wrong. My book is nothing but a simple historic record of facts. I shall place before the reader the theories of the Hindus exactly as they are, and I shall mention in connection with them similar theories of the Greeks in order to show the relationship existing between them. (1910, Vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;7;1958, p.&amp;nbsp;5)}}

An example of Al-Biruni's analysis is his summary of why many Hindus hate Muslims. Biruni notes in the beginning of his book how the Muslims had a hard time learning about Hindu knowledge and culture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; He explains that Hinduism and Islam are totally different from each other. Moreover, Hindus in 11th century India had suffered waves of destructive attacks on many of its cities, and Islamic armies had taken numerous Hindu slaves to Persia, which—claimed Al-Biruni—contributed to Hindus becoming suspicious of all foreigners, not just Muslims. Hindus considered Muslims violent and impure, and did not want to share anything with them. Over time, Al-Biruni won the welcome of Hindu scholars. Al-Biruni collected books and studied with these Hindu scholars to become fluent in Sanskrit, discover and translate into Arabic the mathematics, science, medicine, astronomy and other fields of arts as practiced in 11th-century India. He was inspired by the arguments offered by Indian scholars who believed earth must be globular in shape, which is the only way to fully explain the difference in daylight hours by latitude, seasons and earth's relative positions with moon and stars. At the same time, Al-Biruni was also critical of Indian scribes who he believed carelessly corrupted Indian documents while making copies of older documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last= Bīrūnī |first=Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad | date = 1910 | title = Alberuni's India: An Account of the Religion, Philosophy, Literature, Geography, Chronology, Astronomy, Customs, Laws and Astrology of India about A.D. 1030 | chapter = On the Hindus in General, as an Introduction to Our Account of Them | volume = 1 |page = 17 | publisher = Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner | place = London | url = http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_001/ | accessdate =  | postscript = see also Vol 2 of Al-Biruni's India.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticized the Hindus on what he saw them do and not do, like their deficiencies in curiosity about history and religion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

One of the specific aspects of Hindu life that Al-Biruni studied was the Hindu calendar. His scholarship on the topic exhibited great determination and focus, not to mention the excellence in his approach of the in-depth research he performed. He developed a method for converting the dates of the Hindu calendar to the dates of the three different calendars that were common in the Islamic countries of his time period, the Greek, the Arab/Muslim, and the Persian. Biruni also employed astronomy in the determination of his theories, which were complex mathematical equations and scientific calculation that allows one to convert dates and years between the different calendars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kennedy |last2=Engle |last3=Wamstad|first1=E.S. |first2=Susan |first3=Jeanne|title=The Hindu Calendar as Described in Al-Biruni's Masudic Canon|url=
{{google books |plainurl=y |id=_OLYMgEACAAJ}}|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|date=1965|volume=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book does not limit itself to tedious records of battle because Al-Biruni found the social culture to be more important. The work includes research on a vast array of topics of Indian culture, including descriptions of their traditions and customs. Although he tried to stay away from political and military history, Biruni did indeed record important dates and noted actual sites of where significant battles occurred. Additionally, he chronicled stories of Indian rulers and told of how they ruled over their people with their beneficial actions and acted in the interests of the nation. But, his details are brief and mostly just list rulers without referring to their real names. He did not go on about deeds that each one carried out during their reign, which keeps in line with Al-Biruni's mission to try to stay away from political histories. Al-Biruni also described the geography of India in his work. He documented different bodies of water and other natural phenomena. These descriptions are useful to today's modern historians because they are able to use Biruni's scholarship to locate certain destinations in modern-day India. Historians are able to make some matches while also concluding that certain areas seem to have disappeared and been replaced with different cities. Different forts and landmarks were able to be located, legitimizing Al-Biruni's contributions with their usefulness to even modern history and archeology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

The dispassionate account of Hinduism given by Al-Biruni was remarkable for its time. He stated that he was fully objective in his writings, remaining unbiased like a proper historian should. Biruni documented everything about India just as it happened. But, he did note how some of the accounts of information that he was given by natives of the land may not have been reliable in terms of complete accuracy, however, he did try to be as honest as possible in his writing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Mohammad Yasin compares it to "a magic island of quiet, impartial research in the midst of a world of clashing swords, burning towns, and plundered temples.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yasin|first1=Mohammad|title=Reading in Indian history|date=1988|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distri,|location=New Delhi, India|isbn=978-8-1715-6120-9|pages=19|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hz4LJu1EqJIC|page=5}}|accessdate=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Biruni's writing was very poetic, which may diminish some of the historical value of the work for modern times. The lack of description of battle and politics makes those parts of the picture completely lost. However, Many have used Al-Biruni's work to check facts of history in other works that may have been ambiguous or had their validity questioned.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

== Works ==

Most of the works of Al-Biruni are in [[Arabic]] although he wrote one of his masterpieces, the ''Kitab al-Tafhim'' apparently in both Persian and Arabic, showing his mastery over both languages.&lt;ref name="Nasr"&gt;S.H. Nasr, "An introduction to Islamic cosmological doctrines: conceptions of nature and methods used for its study by the Ikhwān al-Ṣafāʾ, al-Bīrūnī, and Ibn Sīnā", 2nd edition, Revised.  SUNY press, 1993. pp 111: "Al-Biruni wrote one of the masterpieces of medieval science, Kitab al-Tafhim, apparently in both Arabic and Persian, demonstrating how conversant he was in both tongues.  The Kitab al-Tafhim is without doubt the most important of the early works of science in Persian and serves as a rich source for Persian prose and lexicography as well as for the knowledge of the Quadrivium whose subjects it covers in a masterly fashion"&lt;/ref&gt;
Bīrūnī's catalogue of his own literary production up to his 65th lunar/63rd solar year (the end of 427/1036) lists 103 titles divided into 12 categories: astronomy, mathematical geography, mathematics, astrological aspects and transits, astronomical instruments, chronology, comets, an untitled category, astrology, anecdotes, religion, and books he no longer possesses.{{sfn|Pingree|2010}}

=== Persian work ===
Biruni wrote most of his works in Arabic, as the scientific language of his age, however, his Persian version of the Al-Tafhim&lt;ref name="Nasr" /&gt; is one of the most important of the early works of science in the [[Persian language]], and is a rich source for Persian prose and lexicography.&lt;ref name="Nasr" /&gt; The book covers the [[Quadrivium]] in a detailed and skilled fashion.&lt;ref name="Nasr" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
After Al-Biruni's death, in the Ghaznavid dynasty and following centuries his work was not built on, nor referenced.  It was only hundreds of years later in the West, that his books became read and referenced again, especially his book on India which became relevant to the British Empire's activity in India from the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00smnlk|title=BBc Radio: In our Time – Al-Biruni}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alliance to Rescue Civilization''' is an organization devoted to the establishment of an off-Earth "backup" of human civilization.  This facility, or group of facilities, would serve to repopulate the Earth after a worldwide disaster or war, preserving as much as possible of both the sciences and the arts. The organization is currently calling for such a backup facility to be built on the Moon in lieu of NASA's plan to return there by 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/0,1518,502736,00.html|title=Armageddon Insurance: Scientist Call for Earth 'Backup' on Moon|date=29 August 2007|publisher=|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded by the author and journalist [[William E. Burrows]] and the biochemist [[Robert Shapiro (chemist)|Robert Shapiro]].

The '''Canadian Association of Geographers''' ('''CAG'''; {{lang-fr|L'Association canadienne des géographes}}) is an educational and [[learned society|scientific society]] in [[Canada]] aimed at advancing the understanding of, study of, and importance of [[geography]] and related fields. CAG publishes the quarterly [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal|journal]] ''[[The Canadian Geographer]]''.

The association was founded on May 30, 1951 at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada with [[James Wreford Watson]] as the organization's first president. The first national meeting of CAG members took place in 1952 at the [[Université Laval]] in [[Quebec City]]. CAG's 1996 national meeting was held in [[Saskatoon]] as a joint meeting with the Geomorphological Research Group of the Canadian Federation of Earth Sciences.&lt;ref name="cfes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cfes-fcst.ca/1996/cag1996.html|title=THE CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS|publisher=cfes-fcst.ca|accessdate=2009-03-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043547/http://www.cfes-fcst.ca/1996/cag1996.html#|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:West Of Miami River Survey.png|thumb|The Congress Lands West of Miami River|350px]]

The '''Congress Lands West of Miami River''' was a land tract in southwest [[Ohio]] that was established by the Congress late in the 18th century.  It is located south of the [[Greenville Treaty Line]], east of [[Indiana]], and north of the [[Great Miami River]].  The original survey in 1798 contained a triangular shaped slice of land, now located in Indiana, that extended to the Greenville line as it ran from [[Fort Recovery]] to opposite the mouth of the [[Kentucky River]].

==History==

In 1787, lands in the [[Ohio Country]] east of the Great Miami River were sold by the [[Continental Congress]] to Judge [[John Cleves Symmes]] of [[New Jersey]], known as [[Symmes Purchase]].  With the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795, lands west and north of the Miami, and south and east of the Greenville Treaty Line were ceded by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]], and open to settlement.

==The survey==
The survey commenced in 1798.  Land was to be systematically surveyed into square [[Survey township|"townships"]], six miles (9.656&amp;nbsp;km) on a side created by lines running north-south intersected by east-west lines.  Townships were to be arranged in north-south rows called ranges. These townships were sub-divided into thirty-six [[Section (United States land surveying)|"sections"]] of one square mile (2.59&amp;nbsp;km²) or 640 [[acres]]. These ranges, townships, and sections were to be systematically numbered.{{sfn|Knepper|p=42-43}} The [[First Principal Meridian]] was established to run northward from the confluence of the Great Miami River and the [[Ohio River]].  Ranges were numbered east and west from this [[Meridian (geography)|meridian]].  Townships east of the meridian were numbered from south to north, starting at the Great Miami River.  Townships west of the meridian were numbered from south to north starting at the Ohio River.  Thus, townships in adjacent ranges rarely have the same number.{{sfn|Peters|p=164}} Sections in each township are numbered according to the plan adopted in the Act of May 18, 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|1|464}} - Text of Act of May 18, 1796 [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Enabling Act of 1802|Ohio Enabling Act]] of 1802 established the western boundary of the state along the First Principal Meridian.{{sfn|Knepper|p=42-43}}&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|2|173}} - Text of Act of April 30, 1802 [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Theoreticaltownshipmap.gif|thumb|alt=six mile square divided into 36 mile square sections numbered starting with one in the northeast proceeding westward to six in the northwest corner then to seven south of six eastward to twelve south of one then thirteen to twenty four in like manner and finally twenty five to thirty six in the southwest corner |[[General Land Office]] plan for numbering sections of a standard [[survey township]], adopted May 18, 1796|350px]]

==Land sales==

Section 4 of the Land Act of May 18, 1796 provided that the lands in the survey area be sold at [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]].  The Land Act of May 10, 1800&lt;ref&gt;{{USStat|2|73}} - Text of Act of May 10, 1800 [[Library of Congress]]&lt;/ref&gt; established a '''Federal Land Office''' at Cincinnati for sales of these lands.  Sales were also conducted from the nation’s capital at the [[General Land Office]].  Local offices were eventually closed.  The State of Ohio also eventually sold lands granted to them by the federal government, such as [[School Lands|section 16 of each township]].

==College Township==

Congress declared in September, 1803 that 23,321 acres (36.4 square miles) located in the Congress Lands West of Miami River were to be set aside for “an academy, other public schools and seminaries of learning.”  It benefited [[Miami University]], chartered in 1809 by the state legislature in a town the legislature named [[Oxford, Ohio|Oxford]].{{sfn|Knepper|p=68}} The [[College Township]] is in township 5 of range 1 east, now the civil township called [[Oxford Township, Butler County, Ohio]].

==Modern times==
The survey in Ohio in modern times includes all or parts of nine counties: [[Butler County, Ohio|Butler]], [[Darke County, Ohio|Darke]], [[Hamilton County, Ohio|Hamilton]], [[Logan County, Ohio|Logan]], [[Mercer County, Ohio|Mercer]], [[Miami County, Ohio|Miami]], [[Montgomery County, Ohio|Montgomery]], [[Preble County, Ohio|Preble]], and [[Shelby County, Ohio|Shelby]]

In '''[[Panama]]''', a '''[[corregimiento]]''' is a subdivision of a [[Districts of Panama|district]], which in turn is a subdivision of a [[Provinces of Panama|province]]. It is the smallest administrative division level in the country; which is further subdivided into populated places/centres. As of 2012, Panama is subdivided into a total of 666 corregimientos, since several of these were created in the province of [[Bocas del Toro Province|Bocas del Toro]] and the indigenous region (''comarca indígena'') of [[Ngäbe-Buglé Comarca|Ngäbe-Buglé]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.organojudicial.gob.pa/cendoj/wp-content/blogs.dir/cendoj/ley-33-de-2012.pdf Ley 33 del 10 de mayo de 2012 que crea dos distritos y seis corregimientos en la Comarca Ngäbe-Buglé].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gacetaoficial.gob.pa/pdfTemp/27801_A/51095.pdf Ley 39 de 8 de junio de 2015 que crea el distrito de Almirante, y los corregimientos Barrio Francés, Barriada Guaymí, Barriada 4 de Abril, Finca 30, Finca 6, Finca 60 y El Silencio].&lt;/ref&gt; Here is a list of the following corregimientos, by province (and indigenous region) and by district:

[[Image:Israel population density 2014.png|right|thumb|Population density by geographic region, sub-district and district (thicker border indicates higher tier).]]
There are six main administrative '''districts of [[Israel]]''', known in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as '''''mehozot''''' (מחוזות; singular: ''mahoz'' {{Hebrew |מָחוֹז}}) and Arabic as ''[[mintaqah]]'' and fifteen sub-districts (also referred to as counties) known as '''''nafot''''' ({{Hebrew|נפות}}; singular: ''nafa'' {{Hebrew|נָפָה}}). Each sub-district is further divided into [[List of cities in Israel |cities]], [[Local council (Israel) |municipalities]], and [[Regional council (Israel) |regional councils]] it contains.

The figures in this article are based on numbers from the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics and so include all places under Israeli civilian rule including those [[Israeli-occupied territories]] where this is the case. Therefore, the [[Golan Heights|Golan sub-district]] and its four natural regions are included in the number of sub-districts and natural regions even though it is not recognized by the [[United Nations]] or the international community as Israeli territory.  Similarly, the population figure below for the Jerusalem District was calculated including [[East Jerusalem]] whose annexation by Israel is similarly [[Positions on Jerusalem|not recognized]] by the United Nations and the international community. The Judea and Samaria Area, however, is not included in the number of districts and sub-districts as Israel has not applied its civilian jurisdiction in that part of the [[West Bank]].

The name ''Judea and Samaria'' for this geographical area is based on terminology from the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew]] and other sources relating to ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]/[[Judea]]. The territory has been under Israeli control since the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] but not annexed by Israel, pending negotiations regarding its status. It is part of [[Land of Israel|historic Israel]], which leads to politically contentious issues. However, it is not recognized as part of the [[State of Israel]] by the UN and most nations.

__NOTOC__
'''Duat''' ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:dwꜣt#Egyptian|dwꜣt]]}}, [[Egyptological pronunciation]] "do-aht", {{lang-cop|ⲧⲏ}}, also appearing as ''Tuat'', ''Tuaut'' or ''Akert'', ''Amenthes'', ''Amenti'', or ''Neter-khertet'') was the [[underworld|realm of the dead]] in ancient [[Egyptian mythology]]. It has been represented in hieroglyphs as a star-in-circle: &amp;#x131FD;&lt;!--or &lt;hiero&gt;N15&lt;/hiero&gt;--&gt;. The [[Ancient Egyptian deities|god]] [[Osiris]] was believed to be the lord of the underworld since he personified rebirth and life after death, being the first mummy as depicted in the [[Osiris myth]]. The underworld was also the residence of various other gods along with Osiris. The ''Duat'' was the region through which the sun god [[Ra]] traveled from west to east each night, and it was where he battled [[Apep|Apophis]], who embodied the primordial chaos which the sun had to defeat in order to rise each morning and bring order back to the earth. It was also the place where people's souls went after death for judgement, though that was not the full extent of the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; Burial chambers formed touching-points between the mundane world and the ''Duat'', and the [[ancient Egyptian concept of the soul#ꜣḫ|ꜣḫ]] (Egyptological pronunciation: "akh") "the effectiveness of the dead", could use tombs to travel back and forth from the ''Duat''.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch, pp. 33–35&lt;/ref&gt;

Each night through the Duat the sun god Ra travelled, signifying revivification as the main goal of the dead. [[Ra]] travelled under the world upon his [[Atet]] barge from west to east, and was transformed from its aged [[Atum]] form into [[Khepri]], the new dawning sun. The dead king, worshiped as a god, was also central to the mythology surrounding the concept of Duat, often depicted as being one with Ra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Weigal|first1=Arthur Edward Pearse Brome|title=A guide to the antiquities of Upper Egypt from Abydos to the Sudan Frontier|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780710310026|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the sun god the dead king had to travel through the Kingdom of Osiris, the Duat, using the special knowledge he was supposed to possess, which was recorded in the ''[[Coffin Texts]]'', that served as a guide to the hereafter not just for the king but for all deceased. According to the ''[[Amduat]]'', the underworld consists of twelve regions signifying the twelve hours of the sun god's journey through it, battling Apep in order to bring order back to the earth in the morning; as his rays illuminated the Duat throughout the journey, they revived the dead who occupied the underworld and let them enjoy life after death in that hour of the night when they were in the presence of the sun god, after which they went back to their sleep waiting for the god’s return the following night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=John H.|title=Death and the Afterlife in Ancient Egypt|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226791645|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just like the dead king, the rest of the dead journeyed through the various parts of the Duat, not to be unified with the sun god but to be judged. If the deceased was successfully able to pass various demons and challenges, then he or she would reach the &lt;i&gt;weighing of the heart&lt;/i&gt;. In this ritual, the heart of the deceased was weighed by Osiris against the feather of Maat, which represents truth and justice. Any heart that is heavier than the feather was rejected and eaten by [[Ammit]], the devourer of souls, as these people were denied existence after death in the Duat. The souls that were lighter than the feather would pass this most important test, and would be allowed to travel toward [[Aaru]], the "Field of Rushes", an ideal version of the world they knew of, in which they would plough, sow, and harvest abundant crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=John H.|title=Death and the Afterlife in Ancient Egypt|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226791645|pages=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is known of the ''Duat'' derives principally from funerary texts such as the ''[[Book of Gates]]'', the ''[[Book of Caverns]]'', the ''[[Coffin Texts]]'', the ''[[Amduat]]'', and the ''[[Book of the Dead]]''. Each of these documents fulfilled a different purpose and give a different conception of the ''Duat'', and different texts could be inconsistent with one another. Surviving texts differ in age and origin, and there likely was never a single uniform conception of the ''Duat'', as is the case of many theological concepts in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Egypt.Papyrus.01.jpg|thumb|300px|left|A section of the Egyptian [[Book of the Dead]] that is written on papyrus, showing the [[Weighing of the Heart]] in the Duat, where [[Anubis]] can be seen on the far right. The scales are shown with the feather balance, and [[Ammit]] awaits hearts that she must devour. The presence of Osiris at the gateway to the paradise of [[Aaru]] dates the papyrus to a late tradition of the myth.]]

The geography of ''Duat'' is similar in outline to the world the Egyptians knew. There are realistic features like rivers, islands, fields, lakes, mounds and caverns, however, there were also fantastic lakes of fire, walls of iron and trees of turquoise. In the ''Book of Two Ways'', one of the ''[[Coffin Texts]]'', there is even a map-like image of the ''Duat''.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' and ''[[Coffin Texts]]'' were intended to guide people who had recently died through the ''Duat''{{'}}s dangerous landscape and to a life as an ''ꜣḫ''. Emphasized in some these texts are mounds and caverns, inhabited by [[Cavern deities of the underworld|gods, demons or supernatural animals]], which threatened the deceased along their journey. The purpose of the books is not to lay out a geography, but to describe a succession of rites of passage which the dead would have to pass to reach eternal life.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, pp. 138–140&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the many demon-like inhabitants of the ''Duat'', it is not equivalent to the Abrahamic conceptions of Hell in which souls are condemned with fiery torment; the absolute punishment for the wicked, in ancient Egyptian thought, was the denial of an afterlife to the deceased, ceasing to exist in ''ꜣḫ'' form. The grotesque spirits of the underworld were not evil, but under the control of the gods, being present as various ordeals that the deceased had to face.&lt;ref&gt;Pinch, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Duat'' was also a residence for various gods, including Osiris, [[Anubis]], [[Thoth]], [[Horus]], [[Hathor]], and [[Maat]], who all appear to the dead soul as it makes its way toward judgement.

'''Ecological engineering''' uses [[ecology]] and [[engineering]] to predict, design, construct or restore, and manage [[ecosystem]]s that integrate "[[human society]] with its [[natural environment]] for the benefit of both".&lt;ref name = "Mi 98"&gt;W.J. Mitsch &amp; S.E. Jorgensen (1989), "Introduction to Ecological Engineering", In: W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (Editors), ''Ecological Engineering: An Introduction to Ecotechnology''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp. 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins, key concepts, definitions, and applications ==
Ecological engineering emerged as a new idea in the early 1960s, but its definition has taken several decades to refine, its implementation is still undergoing adjustment, and its broader recognition as a new paradigm is relatively recent. Ecological engineering was introduced by [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] and others&lt;ref name = "Od 63"&gt;H.T. Odum et al. (1963), ''Experiments with Engineering of Marine Ecosystems'', in: ''Publication of the Institute of Marine Science of the University of Texas'', 9: 374-403.&lt;/ref&gt; as utilizing [[renewable energy|natural energy]] sources as the predominant input to manipulate and control environmental systems. The origins of ecological engineering are in Odum's work with ecological modeling and ecosystem simulation to capture holistic macro-patterns of energy and material flows affecting the efficient use of resources. 

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; summarized five basic concepts that differentiate ecological engineering from other approaches to addressing problems to benefit society and nature: 1) it is based on the self-designing [[carrying capacity|capacity of ecosystems]]; 2) it can be the field (or acid) test of ecological theories; 3) it relies on system approaches; 4) it conserves [[non-renewable energy]] sources; and 5) it supports ecosystem and [[biological conservation]].

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 89"&gt;W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (1989), "Introduction to Ecological Engineering" In: W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (Editors), ''Ecological Engineering: An Introduction to Ecotechnology''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp. 3-12.&lt;/ref&gt; were the first to define ecological engineering as designing societal services such that they benefit society and nature, and later noted&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Mitsch (1993), "Ecological Engineering - A Cooperative Role with the Planetary Life Support Systems" in: ''Environmental Science &amp; Technology'', 27: 438-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Mitsch (1996), "Ecological Engineering: a new paradigm for engineers and ecologists", In: P.C. Schulze (Editor), ''Engineering Within Ecological Constraints''. National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., pp. 114-132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "MJ 03"&gt;W.J. Mitsch &amp; S.E. Jørgensen (2003), "Ecological engineering: A field whose time has come", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 20(5): 363-377.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name = "MJ 04"&gt;W.J. Mitsch and S.E. Jorgensen (2004), "Ecological Engineering and Ecosystem Restoration". John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York&lt;/ref&gt; the design should be systems based, sustainable, and integrate society with its natural environment.  

Bergen et al.&lt;ref name = "Be 01"&gt;S.D. Bergen et al. (2001), "Design Principles for Ecological Engineering", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 18: 201-210.&lt;/ref&gt; defined ecological engineering as: 1) utilizing ecological science and theory; 2) applying to all types of ecosystems; 3) adapting engineering design methods; and 4) acknowledging a guiding value system.  

Barrett (1999)&lt;ref name = "Ba 99"&gt;{{cite journal|author=K. R. Barrett|year=1999|title=Ecological engineering in water resources: The benefits of collaborating with nature|journal=Water International|volume=24|pages=182–188|doi=10.1080/02508069908692160}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers a more literal definition of the term: "the design, construction, operation and management (that is, engineering) of landscape/aquatic structures and associated plant and animal communities (that is, ecosystems) to benefit humanity and, often, nature."  Barrett continues: "other terms with equivalent or similar meanings include [[ecotechnology]] and two terms most often used in the [[erosion control]] field: soil bioengineering and biotechnical engineering.  However, ecological engineering should not be confused with '[[biotechnology]]' when describing genetic engineering at the cellular level, or '[[bioengineering]]' meaning construction of artificial body parts."

The applications in ecological engineering can be classified into 3 spatial scales: 1) mesocosms (~0.1 to 100s of meters); 2) ecosystems (~1 to 10s of km); and 3) regional systems (&gt;10s of km). The complexity of the design likely increases with the spatial scale. Applications are increasing in breadth and depth, and likely impacting the field's definition, as more opportunities to design and use ecosystems as interfaces between society and nature are explored.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Wetlands, ''Ecological Engineering'', webtext 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Implementation of ecological engineering has focused on the creation or restoration of ecosystems, from [[Land degradation|degraded]] [[wetlands]] to multi-celled tubs and [[greenhouse]]s that integrate microbial, fish, and plant services to process human [[wastewater]] into products such as fertilizers, flowers, and [[drinking water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=N.J Todd &amp; J. Todd|year=1994|title=From Eco-Cities to Living Machines: Principles of Ecological Design|location=Berkeley|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=978-1556431500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of ecological engineering in cities have emerged from collaboration with other fields such as [[landscape architecture]], [[urban planning]], and [[urban horticulture]],&lt;ref name = "Be 01"/&gt; to address human health and biodiversity, as targeted by the UN [[Sustainable Development Goals]], with holistic projects such as [[stormwater management]]. Applications of ecological engineering in rural landscapes have included wetland treatment&lt;ref&gt;A.M. Nahlik and W.J. Mitsch. (2006), "Tropical Treatment Wetlands Dominated by Free-Floating Macrophytes for Water Quality Improvement in Costa Rica", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 28: 246-257.&lt;/ref&gt; and community [[reforestation]] through traditional ecological knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;S.A.W. Diemont and others (2006), "Lancandon Maya Forest Management: Restoration of Soil Fertility using Native Tree Species", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 28: 205-212.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Permaculture]] is an example of broader applications that have emerged as distinct disciplines from ecological engineering, where [[David Holmgren]] cites the influence of [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] in development of permaculture.

== Design guidelines, functional classes, and design principles ==

Ecological engineering design will combine [[systems ecology]] with the process of [[engineering design]]. [[Engineering design]] typically involves problem formulation (goal), problem analysis (constraints), alternative solutions search, decision among alternatives, and specification of a complete solution.&lt;ref&gt;E.V. Krik&lt;/ref&gt; A temporal design framework is provided by Matlock et al.,&lt;ref name = "Ma 01"&gt;M.D. Matlock and others (2001), "Ecological Engineering: A Rationale for Standardized Curriculum and Professional Certification in the United States", in: ''Ecological Engineering'', 17: 403-409.&lt;/ref&gt; stating the design solutions are considered in ecological time. In selecting between alternatives, the design should incorporate [[ecological economics]] in design evaluation&lt;ref name = "Ma 01"/&gt; and acknowledge a guiding value system which promotes biological conservation, benefiting society and nature.&lt;ref name = "MJ 03"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Be 01"/&gt; 

Ecological engineering utilizes [[systems ecology]] with engineering design to obtain a holistic view of the interactions within and between society and nature. Ecosystem simulation with [[Energy Systems Language]] (also known as energy circuit language or energese) by [[Howard T. Odum|Howard Odum]] is one illustration of this systems ecology approach &lt;ref&gt;Brown, M.T. (2004) A picture is worth a thousand words: energy systems language and simulation. Ecological Modelling 178(1-2), 83-100.&lt;/ref&gt;. This holistic model development and simulation defines the system of interest, identifies the system's boundary, and diagrams how energy and material moves into, within, and out of, a system in order to identify how to use renewable resources through ecosystem processes and increase sustainability. The system it describes is a collection (i.e., group) of components (i.e., parts), connected by some type of interaction or interrelationship, that collectively responds to some stimulus or demand and fulfills some specific purpose or function. By understanding systems ecology the ecological engineer can more efficiently design with ecosystem components and processes within the design, utilize renewable energy and resources, and increase sustainability.

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; identified five Functional Classes for ecological engineering designs:
# Ecosystem utilized to reduce/solve pollution problem. Example: phytoremediation, wastewater wetland, and bioretention of stormwater to filter excess nutrients and metals pollution
# Ecosystem imitated or copied to address resource problem. Example: forest restoration, replacement wetlands, and installing street side rain gardens to extend canopy cover to optimize residential and urban cooling
# Ecosystem recovered after disturbance. Example: mine land restoration, lake restoration, and channel aquatic restoration with mature riparian corridors
# Ecosystem modified in ecologically sound way. Example: selective timber harvest, biomanipulation, and introduction of predator fish to reduce planktivorous fish, increase zooplankton, consume algae or phytoplankton, and clarify the water.
# Ecosystems used for benefit without destroying balance. Example: sustainable agro-ecosystems, multispecies aquaculture, and introducing agroforestry plots into residential property to generate primary production at multiple vertical levels.

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; identified 19 Design Principles for ecological engineering, yet not all are expected to contribute to any single design:
# Ecosystem structure &amp; function are determined by forcing functions of the system;
# Energy inputs to the ecosystems and available storage of the ecosystem is limited;
# Ecosystems are open and dissipative systems (not thermodynamic balance of energy, matter, entropy, but spontaneous appearance of complex, chaotic structure);
# Attention to a limited number of governing/controlling factors is most strategic in preventing pollution or restoring ecosystems;
# Ecosystem have some homeostatic capability that results in smoothing out and depressing the effects of strongly variable inputs;
# Match recycling pathways to the rates of ecosystems and reduce pollution effects;
# Design for pulsing systems wherever possible;
# Ecosystems are self-designing systems;
# Processes of ecosystems have characteristic time and space scales that should be accounted for in environmental management;
# Biodiversity should be championed to maintain an ecosystem's self design capacity;
# Ecotones, transition zones, are as important for ecosystems as membranes for cells; 
# Coupling between ecosystems should be utilized wherever possible;
# The components of an ecosystem are interconnected, interrelated, and form a network; consider direct as well as indirect efforts of ecosystem development;
# An ecosystem has a history of development;
# Ecosystems and species are most vulnerable at their geographical edges;
# Ecosystems are hierarchical systems and are parts of a larger landscape;
# Physical and biological processes are interactive, it is important to know both physical and biological interactions and to interpret them properly;
# Eco-technology requires a holistic approach that integrates all interacting parts and processes as far as possible;
# Information in ecosystems is stored in structures.

Mitsch and Jorgensen&lt;ref name = "MJ 04"/&gt; identified the following considerations prior implementing an ecological engineering design: 
* Create conceptual model of determine the parts of nature connected to the project;
* Implement a computer model to simulate the impacts and uncertainty of the project;
* Optimize the project to reduce uncertainty and increase beneficial impacts. 

== Academic curriculum (colleges)==

An academic curriculum has been proposed for ecological engineering,&lt;ref name = "Ma 01"/&gt; and institutions around the world are starting programs. Key elements of this curriculum are: [[environmental engineering]]; [[systems ecology]]; [[restoration ecology]]; [[ecological modeling]]; quantitative ecology; economics of ecological engineering, and technical [[Course (education)#Elective and required courses|electives]]. &lt;ref&gt;Diemont, S.W., T.J. Lawrence, and T.A. Endreny. "Envisioning Ecological Engineering Education: An International Survey of the Educational and Professional Community", Ecological Engineering, 36(4): 570-578, 2010. DOI: 10.1016/j.ecoleng.2009.12.004 &lt;/ref&gt;

Complementing this set of courses are prerequisites courses in physical, biological, and chemical subject areas, and integrated design experiences.

'''Emilia''' ({{lang-egl|Emîlia}}) is a historical region of northern [[Italy]] which approximately corresponds to the western and north-eastern portions of today’s [[Emilia-Romagna]] [[Regions of Italy|region]], of which [[Romagna]] forms the remainder.

==Etymology==
It takes its name from the [[Via Aemilia]], a [[Roman road]] constructed by the [[consul]] [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (consul 187 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]] in 187 BCE to connect [[Rimini]] with [[Piacenza]].

==Boundaries==
The eastern boundary is formed by the rivers [[Sillaro]] and [[Reno (river)|Reno]], which divide it from [[Romagna]]. To the north the river [[Po (river)|Po]] forms its border with [[Veneto]] and [[Lombardy]]. To the west and south the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennine]] [[drainage divide]] separates it from [[Liguria]] and [[Tuscany]]. Administratively it comprises the [[Provinces of Italy|provinces]] of [[Piacenza (province)|Piacenza]], [[Parma (province)|Parma]], [[Reggio Emilia (province)|Reggio Emilia]], [[Modena (province)|Modena]], [[Bologna (province)|Bologna]] (except for the [[comuni|communes]] of [[Imola]] and [[Dozza]], and the valley of the [[Santerno]]) and [[Ferrara (province)|Ferrara]].

The region corresponds approximately to the ancient [[Cisalpine Gaul|Cispadane Gaul]] which, under the [[Augustus|Augustan]] [[Italia (Roman Empire)#Under the Republic and Augustan organization|territorial organisation]] of [[Italia]] c. 7 CE, became [[Regio VIII Aemilia]].

==Language==
{{See also|Italian language|Emilian language}}

Although [[Italian language|Italian]] is today the most widely, it is the [[Emilian language|Emilian dialect]] which is specific to the region, although it is spoken in hybrid form in neighbouring provinces.

'''France Planina''' (29 September 1901 – 14 January 1992) was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[geographer]] and  [[Cartography|cartographer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdloka.si/slo/main.asp?id=29622A7F Škofja Loka Museum Society site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Planina was born in [[Škofja Loka]] in 1901. He graduated from the [[University of Ljubljana]] in 1925 and taught in secondary schools in [[Otočac]], [[Kranj]] and [[Ljubljana]]. During the [[Second World War]] he was interred in the [[Gonars concentration camp]]. After the war he continued to teach and also worked at the [[Natural History Museum of Slovenia]]. He retired in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gorenjci.si/osebe/planina-france/17/ Web Biographical Lexicon of Famous People from Upper Carniola]&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Ljubljana in 1992. In 2001 a bronze [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] to Planina was unveiled in Škofja Loka.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skofjaloka.si/default.aspx?Tip=1551651&amp;KeyID=68&amp;Naslov=Aleja_znamenitih_Locanov Škofja Loka Municipality site, Monuments to Famous Locals]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 he won the [[Levstik Award]] for his book ''Jugoslavija'' (Yugoslavia).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mladinska.com/knjige/knjizne_nagrade/levstikove__nagrade The Levstik Award on the Mladinska Knjiga Publishing House site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Moldova]] is bordered on the west and southwest by [[Romania]] and on the north, south, and east by [[Ukraine]]. Most of its territory lies between the area's two main rivers, the [[Dniester]] and the [[Prut]]. The Dniester forms a small part of Moldova's border with Ukraine in the northeast and southeast, but it mainly flows through the eastern part of the country, separating [[Bessarabia]] and [[Transnistria]]. The [[Prut River]] forms Moldova's entire western boundary with Romania. The [[Danube]] touches the Moldovan border at its southernmost tip, and forms the border for {{convert|200|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

== Climate ==
Moldova's proximity to the [[Black Sea]] gives it a mild and sunny climate.

Moldova's [[climate]] is moderately continental: the summers are warm and long, with temperatures averaging about {{convert|20|°C}}, and the winters are relatively mild and dry, with January temperatures averaging {{convert|−4|°C}}. Annual rainfall, which ranges from around {{convert|6|cm|in|1|sp=us}} in the north to {{convert|4|cm|in|1|sp=us}} in the south, can vary greatly; long dry spells are not unusual. The heaviest rainfall occurs in early summer and again in October; heavy showers and thunderstorms are common. Because of the irregular terrain, heavy summer rains often cause erosion and river silting.

'''Weather records'''.
The highest temperature ever recorded: {{convert|+41.5|°C}} on July 21, 2007 (Camenca).
The lowest temperature ever recorded: {{convert|−35.5|°C}} on January 20, 1963 (Brătuşeni, Edineţ county).

== Topography ==
{{Moldavian Plateau}}
[[Image:MoldRelief.jpg|thumb|left|Topography of Moldova]]
Most of Moldova's territory is a moderate hilly plateau cut deeply by many streams and rivers. Geologically, Moldova lies primarily on deep sedimentary rock that gives way to harder crystalline outcroppings only in the north. Moldova's hills are part of the [[Moldavian Plateau]], which geologically originate from the [[Carpathian Mountains]].

The northern landscape of Moldova is characterized by gently rolling uplands of the [[Dniester Hills]] (up to {{convert|300|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}, in [[elevation]]) interlaced with small flat plains in the valleys of the numerous [[Stream|creeks]] (at {{convert|150|m|ft|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} elevation). These hills, which have an average altitude of {{convert|240|m|ft|0|sp=us}} and a maximum altitude of {{convert|320|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, can be divided into the [[Northern Moldavian Hills]] and the [[Dniester Ridge]], and continue further occupying the northern part of the [[Chernivtsi oblast]] in [[Ukraine]]. The eastern slopes of the Dniester Ridge (average {{convert|250|m|ft|0|sp=us|disp=or}}, max {{convert|347|m|ft|0|sp=us|disp=or}}), form the high right bank of the Dniester River.

The [[Moldavian Plain]] has an average of {{convert|200|m|ft|0|sp=us}} and a maximum altitude of {{convert|250|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, and can be divided into the [[Bălți Steppe]] and the [[Middle Prut Valley]]. Originally [[forest]]ed, it has been extensively de-forested for [[agriculture]] during the 19th and 20th centuries. In contrast to the region to the north and south, which is smore slant, this area is referred to as ''plain'', although it has [[Terrain|relief]] very different from that of a [[flatlands|flatland]], and vegetation different from that of the [[steppe]].
[[Image:MoldGeologica.jpg|thumb|Geology of Moldova]]
The hills of central Moldova, the [[Central Moldavian Plateau]], at an average elevation of about {{convert|350|to|400|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, are ridges interlaced by deep, flat valleys, ravines, and landslide-scoured depressions. Steep forest-clad slopes account for much of the terrain, where the most common trees are hornbeam, oak, linden, maple, wild pear, and wild cherry. The term ''[[Codri]]'' refers more generally to all the forests between the Carpathians and the [[Dniester]] river, and even more generally to all forests in the area of the [[Carpathians]], yet since in Moldova most of them were preserved in the central part, Codri sometimes can colloquially refer to the remaining forests in the hills west and north of [[Chişinău]]. The Dniester Ridge border Central Moldavian Plateau to the north along the river [[Răut]].

The plateau can be divided into 5 parts: [[Ciuluc-Soloneţ Hills]] ({{lang-ro|Dealurile Ciuluc-Soloneţ}}), alongated in the north along the right side of the [[Răut river]], {{convert|1690|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}, [[Corneşti Hills]] ({{lang-ro|Dealurile Corneştilor}}), also known as Cordi Hills ({{lang-ro|Dealurile Codrilor}}), {{convert|4740|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}, [[Lower Dniester Hills]] ({{lang-ro|Dealurile Nistrului Inferior}}), alongated to the south of the Botna river, {{convert|3040|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}, [[Tigheci Hills]] ({{lang-ro|Dealurile Tigheciului}}), alongated in the south along the left side of the [[Prut river]], {{convert|3550|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}, and between the latter and the Prut river, the [[Lower Prut Valley]] ({{lang-ro|Valea Prutului Inferior}}), {{convert|1810|km2|mi2|0|abbr=on}}.

The country's highest point, [[Bălăneşti Hill]], which reaches {{convert|1407|or|1410|ft|m|1|abbr=on}}, depending on the source, is situated in the Corneşti Hills, the western part of the Central Moldavian Plateau. Northwest of it are the [[Ciuluc-Soloneţ Hills]] (average {{convert|250|m|ft|0|sp=us|disp=or}}, max {{convert|388|m|ft|0|sp=us|disp=or}}). In the south, the [[Tigheci|Tigheci Hills]] (average {{convert|200|m|ft|0|sp=us|disp=or}}, max {{convert|301|m|ft|0|sp=us|disp=or}}) are a prolongation, and run to the south parallel to the Lower Prut Valley.

To the south-east, the southern part of the Central Moldavian Plateau, which averages {{convert|150|-|200|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, max {{convert|250|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, and has numerous ravines and gullies, gradually vanishs into the extensive Bugeac Plain, with most of the [[Budjak]] region already in Ukraine.

[[Transnistria]] (the left bank of the Dniester) has spurs of the [[Podolian Plateau]] ({{lang-ro|Podişul Podoliei}}, {{lang-uk|Volyno-Podil's'ka vysochyna}}), (average {{convert|180|m|ft|0|sp=us|disp=or}}, max {{convert|275|m|ft|0|sp=us|disp=or}}), which are cut into by tributaries of the Dniester River. The southern half of Transnistria, the ''Lower Dniester Plain'', can be regarded as the western end of the [[Eurasian steppe]]''',''' and has an average elevation of {{convert|100|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, with a maximum of {{convert|170|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. The high right bank and low left bank of the Dniester are in sharp contrast here, where visibility is not impeded by forests.

About 75 percent of Moldova is covered by a soil type called [[Chernozem|black earth]] or [[chernozem]]. In the northern hills, more clay textured soils are found; in the south, red-earth soil is predominant. The soil becomes less fertile toward the south but can still support grape and sunflower production. The hills have woodland soils, while a small portion in southern Moldova is in the [[steppe]] zone, although most steppe areas today are cultivated. The lower reaches of the Prut and Dniester rivers and the southern river valleys are saline marshes.

Drainage in Moldova is to the south, toward the Black Sea lowlands, and eventually into the Black Sea, but only eight rivers and creeks extend more than 100 kilometers. Moldova's main river, the [[Dniester]], is navigable throughout almost the entire country, and in warmer winters it does not freeze over. The [[Prut]] river is a tributary of the [[Danube]], which it joins at the far southwestern tip of the country. Over 95% of the water circulation in Moldova flows into one of the two rivers - the Prut or Dniester. Of Moldova's well-developed network of about 3,000 creeks and streams, all draining south to the Black Sea, only 246 exceed {{convert|6|mi|km|1|abbr=on}} in length, and only 8 exceed {{convert|60|mi|km|1|abbr=on}}.

Underground water, extensively used for the country's water supply, includes about 2,200 natural springs. The terrain favours construction of reservoirs of various size.

== Natural habitat ==
[[Image:MoldVeget.jpg|thumb|Natural habitat of Moldova]]
[[Image:Dniester in Moldova, 2004.jpg|thumb|A [[Nistru]] valley view.]]
Moldova's natural habitat is characterized by [[forest steppe]]s, a temperate-climate habitat type composed of [[grassland]] interspersed with areas of [[woodland]] or [[forest]]. A belt of forest steppes cross [[Eurasia]] from eastern Europe to Eastern Siberia, forming a transition between [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] and [[temperate grasslands]]. In the 19th century Moldova witnessed a sharp decrease in the forested areas, sacrificed for agriculture due to rich soil.

===Historical references===

* In the 5th century BC, [[Herodotus]] visited the countryside between the rivers Dnister and Prut and described the place as "a plain with deep black earth, rich in grass and well irrigated".
* Lithuanian Prince [[Jogaila]] spoke of [[Moldavia]] as "a rich and fructiferous country".
* According to the testimony of [[Venetian Mateus de Murano]], "the country was very well located, reach with cattle and all kinds of fruits, pastures are perfect".
* Rich natural resources of Moldavia always attracted nomads. Fleeing their devastating incursions, inhabitants of Moldavia left the brooded places and hid in forests. French knight [[Guilbert de Lannoy]], who visited these places in 1421, has mentioned insignificant population of the region: "we moved through large deserts".
* Counsellor of Hungarian King [[George Reihersdorf]] (middle of 16th century) was complaining of travel through "empty, uninhabited lands". In 1541, he produced the first geographical map (preserved to this day) of the [[Principality of Moldavia]], with rivers [[Dnister]] and [[Prut]] shown, as well as cities and other localities, but also highlighted large steppes.
* A map of Moldavia was drawn by the German diplomat [[Sigismund von Herberstein]]. On his map one can see woodless spaces - [[Bălți steppe]] in the north, and [[Bugeac Steppe]] in the south.
* In the 17th century, pilgrims [[Pavel Aleppskii]] (a Syrian deacon) and [[Ioan Lukianov]] (a Russian preast) traveled on their way to the [[Holy land]] through Moldavia. These two travellers were struck by the disastrous state of the land that used to blossom: "It better be not ravaged, as no other such can be found, it may yield any kind".
* English traveller [[John Bell (traveller)|John Bell]], who also visited Moldavia, and wrote about fecund soils and "small nice towns" situated next to [[Răut]].
* Russian geographer [[K. Laksman]] described Bălți steppe in the beginning of the 19th century: "To the north is located a steppe with almost no trees at all. To the north-west the steppe is not as woodless".
* Scientist [[K. Arseniev]] mentioned that the north of [[Bessarabia]] is "a genuine mix of arid steppes with most fertile pastures, rich meadows and gardens".
* Travelers and scholars were amazed by the contrast between rich natural resources of Moldavia/Bălți steppe and its low population in war torned 18th century, pitiful state of agriculture, as well as the poverty of the local population.
* "Desert, waste, naked steppe... The settling among limitless expanses of Bălți steppe happened not "in accordnace" with logic, but "against" it. The life of remote ancestors of Bălțiers was full of difficulties and crosses, but they managed to resist."{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}
* "Moldavian fields, as described by both ancient and contemporary writers, are great in their fertility, by far surpassing the richness of the mountains" ([[Dimitrie Cantemir]], ''[[:s:la:Descriptio Moldaviae|Descriptio Moldaviae]]'')
* "Will someone describe Bessarabian steppes, indeed, they do merit a description. However for this, one needs the talent of unforgettable [[Gogol]], who has so beautifully depicted us the steppes of his homeland. And Bessarabian steppes are not less beautiful." ([[Constantin Stamati-Ciurea]])

=== Current issues ===
Moldova's communist-era environmental legacy, like that of many other former Soviet republics, is one of environmental degradation. [[Agriculture|Agricultural]] practices such as overuse of [[pesticide]]s and artificial fertilizers were intended to increase agricultural output at all costs, without regard for the consequences. As a result, Moldova's soil and groundwater were contaminated by lingering chemicals, some of which (including [[DDT]]) have been banned in the West.

Such practices continue in Moldova to the present day. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_98881.htm|title=Destroying dangerous pesticides in Moldova|last=NATO|website=NATO|access-date=2016-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, use of pesticides in Moldova averaged approximately twenty times that of other former Soviet republics and Western nations. In addition, poor farming methods, such as destroying forests to plant vineyards, have contributed to the extensive soil erosion to which the country's rugged topography is already prone.

==Stratigraphy, Tectonics and Geologic History==
Precambrian formations include highly metamorphosed crystalline rocks and are distinguished as Pelagonian Horst Anticlinorium (also known as the Pelagon) together with some blocks in the Vardar Zone. They are widely distributed in the Serbian-Macedonian Massif. The lower part of the segment includes [[gneiss]], [[biotite]], [[muscovite]], magmatized and [[augen]] gneiss, metagabbro, [[eclogite]], [[amphibolite]], amphibolite [[shale]] and micaceous [[marble]]. In the upper segment are different types of mica [[schist]], granite, [[kyanite]] and [[staurolite]]. The upper Precambrian of Pelagon Horst Anticlinorium include mixed series of gneiss, mica schist, [[barite]], [[cipolem]], marble and metarhyolite together with [[calcite]] and [[dolomite]] up to three kilometers thick. Other parts of the Precambrian complex have widely distributed [[granitoids]] which in some cases have merged with surrounding gneiss. There are [[pegmatite]] and [[aplite]] bodies and veins. Granitoids have been dated as one billion to 800 million years old by [[potassium-argon dating]] methods and appear to date to the [[Grenville orogeny]] period.

The Precambrian complex in the Serbo-Macedonian Massif is made up of gneiss, mica schist and gabbro amphibolite with small masses of marble and metarhyolite. Gneiss is connected to the lower part of the massif and includes minerals such as muscovite, biotite and augen. Mica schist tends to occur in thin bands while gabbro amphibolites represent the metamorphosed magma intrusions and basic rocks with meta-tuff sometimes interspersed with gneiss and mica schist in bands and lenses. In the Pelagon, rocks have Barrovian-type regional metamorphism up to [[greenschist]] grade on the sequence of [[metamorphic facies]]. In the Serbo-Macedonian Massif, rocks also reach greenschist facies and exhibit Barrovian-type metamorphism. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=519}}
 
===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
[[Paleozoic]] rocks are widespread in Macedonia, particularly in the west, including [[phyllite]], volcanic formations and evidence of [[Riphean (stage)|Riphean]] through [[Cambrian]], [[Ordovician]], [[Devonian]] and [[Silurian]] formations based on fossil [[cephalopods]], corals, [[brachiopods]], [[trilobites]] and [[goniatites]]. Riphean-Cambrian rocks are particularly common in the Serbo-Macedonian Massif, representing sedimentary-volcanic sequences of [[albite]], [[epidote]] and [[chlorite]] shales, albite-quartz-sericite shales, amphibole metagabbro, and metadiabase, such as the Vlasina Complex in Serbia. Metarhyolites also dominate in the Riphean-Cambrian segment of the Vardar Zone, including phyllite, [[spilite]] and keratophyre, epidote-chlorite, spilite-mica schist and low-grade metamorphic shales. 
Ordovician rocks are represented by metasediments such as phyllite, sandy phyllite, quartzite sandstone and some shales. The Silurian also has phyllite-like rocks but has a greater proportion of volcanic and quartz porphyry rocks. The Devonian is western Macedonia is also defined by phyllites, together with graphite shale, [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerate]], quartzite and carbonaceous shales, along with [[marble]] containing [[crinoid]] fossils. Paleozoic formations in different zones indicate that the lower units are most complex in eastern Macedonia, while the Ordovician and Devonian formations tend to be less numerous in the Vardar Zone and are generally more present in the west. The Kraistides, a volcanic complex spanning into neighboring Bulgaria dominates some parts of the country, with greenschist, metadiabase and spilite in its lower levels, and phyllite schists in its upper levels. 

Paleozoic magma formations include granitoid intrusions in both the west and the east, such as the Pelister Massif, in the west, which is well known to geologists because it breaks through [[Caledonian orogeny]] age Paleozoic formations, forming 456 million years ago. It includes biotite, alkali granites and [[adamellite]]. The Kruschevo granodiorite is associated with the [[Hercynian orogeny]] 289 million years ago representing biotite granite that was impacted by intense metamorphism. The granite here tends to be cataclastic while biotite has largely been transformed into secondary minerals. The Kraistide area in the east has some additional intrusions, including laminated granites and rose-colored granites, together with aplite and quartz porphyry. 

Regional metamorphism of Paleozoic rocks in western Macedonia is characterized by low temperatures and high pressures, particularly Paleozoic rocks during the [[Alpine orogeny]] period went through a single period of intense cataclastic metamorphism. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=520-521}}

===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
[[Triassic]] rocks are mostly found in western Macedonia, although less in the Vardar Zone, covering only a small area in the Delchevo border zone near Bulgaria. They are mainly volcanic rocks in the lower units overlain by carbonaceous dolomite. [[Jurassic]] rocks are particularly common in the Vardar Zone, particularly in the west. In this area, rocks are extremely varied due to [[ophiolite]] formations and massifs. The ophiolites are found in serpentinized ultra-mafic masses or sometimes as more complete ophiolite complexes. Apart from ultrabasic rocks, there is also [[diabase]], gabbro, peridotite and basalt. In the Vardar Zone, a series of faults and diapirs are laminated and highly serpentinized. The Radusha Massif is the most significant ophiolite massif, covering an area of 60 square kilometers northwest of [[Skopje]]. Chromium ore was extracted from the massif for decades and it also hosts [[dunite]], [[harzburgite]], veins and lenses of gabbro and [[rodingite]]. Gabbro-diorites of the ophiolite suite include the Demir Kapija-Gevgelija, Klepa and Skopska Crna Gora massifs in the central part of the Vardar Zone. The Demir Kapija-Gevgelija Massif extends over an area of 400 square kilometers. 

Basal conglomerate in the Demir Kapija area are overlain by massive limestones from the [[Tithonian]]. Ophiolite-gabbro cumulates are identified as oceanic-type gabbros and basalts are believed to have formed from up to 20 percent pre-existing crustal rock. Among the acidic magmatic intrusive bodies in the area are granites and granodiorites. In the west, in the vicinity of Korab Mountain, is a limestone formation with layers of [[chert]] and a [[flysch]] formation dominating the sub-soil, made up of claystone, limestone and siltstone. Toward the south is an additional ophiolite complex with similar rocks to the Vardar Zone. 

[[Cretaceous]] rocks include examples from the [[Turonian]] and [[Senonian]]. Albian rocks are only found around the southeastern city of Shtip. Flysch is the most common remnant of the Senonian, particularly in the western Vardar Zone (up to three kilometers of alternating conglomerates, sandstones, [[arkose]], [[marl]], limestone and [[rudist]] fossils—shifting more toward siltstone in the east). Along the Radika River and Drim River in western Macedonia flysch, a carbonaceous sandbar limestone and [[olistolith]] limestone blocks outcrop. Cretaceous intrusive bodies include small granite bodies along the Pelagon fault zone, dating to 118 million years ago. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=521-522}}

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
The [[Cenozoic]] is represented by [[Eocene]] continental and marine deposits, along with volcanic formations from the [[Neogene]] and the last 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]]. Eocene rocks are mainly found in the Vardar Zone, especially close to Delchevo along the Bulgarian border and Debar. Red or violet conglomerate and sandstone make up the lower layers along with [[molasse]] formations. They are overlain by alternating sequences of sand and clay flysch with limestone layers rich in Eocene fossils. The [[Oligocene]] along the Bulgarian border has quartz [[latite]] and [[dacite]] rocks. Continental molasse deposited during the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] with sand, clay, tuff, volcanic ash, although there are some layers of diatomaceous earth and limestone in the Pelagon area. Marl, 1.5 kilometers thick fills the Skopje valley. Pliocene sands are covered by limestone and [[travertine]] which resulted from lake beds and hydrothermal waters. The Zletovo-Kratovo volcanic formation is also from the same period. Small basalt eruptions at the edge of the Vardar Zone in the early Quaternary produced some of the youngest rocks in the country. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=522-523}}

==Natural resource geology==
In the past, iron, chromium, [[diatomite]], marble, [[perlite]] and other resources have been mined in Macedonia. Lead, zinc, copper, decorative stone and quartzite were mined on a small scale in the 1990s.

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles – [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] – and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system – the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components – it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid – a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

'''''Gone Home''''' is a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] [[Exploration game|exploration]] and [[Adventure game#Walking simulators|walking simulator]] [[video game]] developed and published by [[Fullbright (company)|The Fullbright Company]]. ''Gone Home'' was first released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], and [[Linux]] computers in August 2013, followed by console released for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in January 2016 and the [[Nintendo Switch]] in September 2018.

Set in the year 1995, ''Gone Home'' puts the player in the role of a young woman returning from overseas to her rural Oregon family home to find her family currently absent and the house empty, leaving her to piece together recent events. She comes to learn that her younger sister had recently come out as a [[lesbian]] to her family, creating strife with their parents that led to the current state of the house. Atypical of most video games, ''Gone Home'' does not feature much interactivity, but instead has the player explore the house at their own pace and determine what has transpired by examining items, journals, and other items left around the various rooms. The Fullbright team, having had previously worked on ''[[BioShock 2: Minerva's Den]]'', took concepts and ideas from that game to craft an exploration game to engage the player into uncovering the narration by non-linear progression in their searching of the house, while keeping the project manageable for their small team.

''Gone Home'' was critically praised at release. Several outlets used the game as an example of [[Video games as an art form|video games as art]], as its non-standard gameplay format demonstrates progression of the video game industry into more artistic forms. However, this also raised the question of whether ''Gone Home'' should be considered a game, and led to the derogatory term "walking simulators" to describe exploration games with little interactivity, though since then, the industry has come to embrace the term. ''Gone Home''{{'}}s characters story was praised for addressing [[LGBT]] issues with which some players could identify.

== Gameplay ==
The player takes the role of Katie in the [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] view, who can move around the house and view and interact with objects. There are no defined goals in the game; however, the game encourages and rewards the player when they explore new areas of the house and search for new messages. Much of the interactivity rests upon looking at objects and notes within the house. In order to progress in the game, the player must find certain objects that unlock access to other parts of the house.

== Plot ==
[[File:Gone Home - Launch Trailer.webm|thumb|left|thumbtime=69|320px|The launch trailer sets the scene for the game]]
On 7 June 1995, 21-year-old Katie Greenbriar returns home from overseas to her family's new home in fictional Boon County, Oregon: her father, Terry, a failed writer who makes a living reviewing home electronics; her mother, Janice, a [[wildlife conservation]]ist who recently got promoted to director; and her 17-year-old sister Samantha. Upon arriving, she finds the house deserted, much of their possessions still in moving boxes, and a note on the door from Sam imploring Katie not to investigate what happened.&lt;ref name=ign-2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gone Home transports players back to 1995|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-15-gone-home-preview-an-authentic-look-back-at-1995|first=Jeffrey|last=Matulef|date=15 November 2012|work=[[Eurogamer]]|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searching the house, Katie begins to piece together what happened during her absence: After moving in, Samantha found it difficult to adjust to her new high school, but eventually made friends with another girl, Yolanda "Lonnie" DeSoto, a [[Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps|JROTC]] cadet. The two bonded over ''[[Street Fighter]]'', [[punk rock]], [[grunge]] and the burgeoning [[riot grrrl]] movement, and after sneaking off to a concert, the two became romantically involved. After various incidents at school, Sam's parents found out about her relationship, forbade Sam to close her bedroom door while Lonnie was over, and are in denial that their daughter is a lesbian. As Lonnie was set to eventually ship out to begin her service, Sam was left distraught.

Two days after her farewell show, which coincides with the day of Kaitlin's homecoming, and the week when Sam's parents are going on vacation (which is revealed to actually be a counseling trip instead of being a camping trip, like they told others) Lonnie departs to her station, but eventually calls Sam from a payphone to tell her that she got off the bus in [[Salem, Oregon|Salem]] and she wants them to be together. Sam's final journal entry to Katie explains that she packed up her things and took her car to find Lonnie, hoping to start a new life with her outside of Oregon.

Optionally, Katie can find various other clues that provide information on additional events that happened during the time: it is implied that Janice was beginning to have romantic feelings towards a subordinate, and that Terry was abused by Oscar Masan, his uncle and former owner of the house.

== Development ==
[[File:The_Fullbright_Company_-_Game_Developers_Choice_Awards_2014.jpg|thumb|right|The Fullbright Company at the [[Game Developers Choice Awards]] in 2014. From left, Kate Craig, Steve Gaynor, Johnnemann Nordhagen and Karla Zimonja]]
[[Fullbright (company)|Fullbright]] was founded by Steve Gaynor, Karla Zimonja, and Johnnemann Nordhagen as "The Fullbright Company". The three had previously worked together at [[2K Games]] on ''[[BioShock 2: Minerva's Den]]''. All three were drawn by the prospect of developing an exploration game influenced by ''Minerva's Den'' through a small [[independent video game development|independent team]] rather than a large company, and subsequently left 2K Games to form Fullbright.&lt;ref name="polygon fullbright"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgamer 2013"/&gt; To reduce costs, the team moved into a house together in [[Portland, Oregon]], and set up the office in the basement, with ''Gone Home'' being their first game.&lt;ref name="polygon fullbright"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EdgeProfile/&gt; Gaynor considered their previous work on the ''BioShock'' games as effectively the pre-production stage for ''Gone Home'', allowing them to complete it within seventeen months.&lt;ref name="pcgamersn 2017"/&gt; The rapid development was aided by first prototyping the game in ''[[Amnesia: The Dark Descent]]''{{'}}s [[HPL Engine 2]] (which Gaynor had prior experience with), before completing the game in the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity 4]] [[game engine]].&lt;ref name=JoystiqEngine&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/10/24/gone-home-began-as-an-amnesia-mod-and-you-can-play-it/| title=Gone Home began as an Amnesia mod, and you can play it| author=Danny Cowen| work=[[Joystiq]]| date=24 October 2013| accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The initial concept for ''Gone Home'' was for the player to explore a [[Home automation|smart house]] that including a central [[artificial intelligence]] running everything with robots running around to complete tasks. The player would have been able to change the state of the house through their actions; Gaynor compared this idea to a non-combative ''[[System Shock]]'' game. As they explored this idea, and recognizing the small size of their team, they considered what would change if they made the house more like a regular household without any other characters visibly present, which significantly simplified the development into something more manageable for the team. This created the focus of the game as being "no other people, no other characters, [just] you in a single environment".&lt;ref name=EdgeProfile&gt;{{cite journal| title=Studio Profile: The Fullbright Company| author=Edge staff| journal=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]| issue=259| date=November 2013| pages=114–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduced scope allows them to complete the game with the three of them for programming, narrative, and 2D art assets, along with remote work from Kate Craig for the game's 3D modeling. Particularly, the smaller scope eliminated the need for any type of character modeler or animator.&lt;ref name="pcgames 2015"&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/gone-home/the-making-of-gone-home | title = The making of: Gone Home | first = Joe | last = Donnelley | date = 2 October 2015 | accessdate = 15 August 2018 | work = [[PCGamesN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig's wife [[Emily Carroll]], a comic artist whom Gaynor was a fan of, also assisted by designing some of the game's art asset and logos.&lt;ref name="polygon fullbright"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2013/8/13/4568900/the-fullbright-company-gone-home | title = Meet Me In Portland: The Fullbright Company's Journey Home | first = Mike | last = Mahardy | date = 13 August 2013 | accessdate = 16 August 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narratively, ''Gone Home'' was designed around family; Gaynor had stated that for all the science fiction trappings of ''Minerva's Den'', its core narrative was about a man, his wife, and how the man's past was affecting that relationship, and used the same approach for ''Gone Home''. They placed the player as one of the members of the family to remove any type of morality of exploring a house that did not belong to them. Additionally, they established that the family had only recently moved into the home; Gaynor had worried that the player would have difficulty identifying key elements that would be present among all the other objects within a well lived-in home, while within a recent move, only objects of immediate importance would have been unpacked, making it easy for the player to focus on these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://gamasutra.com/view/news/198340/How_Gone_Homes_design_constraints_lead_to_a_powerful_story.php | title = How Gone Home's design constraints lead to a powerful story | first= Leigh  |last = Alexander | date =15 August 2013 | accessdate = 15 August 2018 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fullbright set the game in 1995 because they considered it the most recent year in which technology had not made the majority of communication digital in nature, so that they did not have to account for how digital communication would affect their storytelling, while still keeping elements of the game familiar to players.&lt;ref name=ign-2012&gt;{{cite news|title=Gone Home is Undiluted Adventure|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2012/11/15/gone-home-is-undiluted-adventure|first=Charles|last=Onyett|date=15 November 2012|work=[[IGN]]|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgames 2015"/&gt; Another source of inspiration was [[urban exploration]], particularly Japanese ''haikyo'', homes long abandoned due to industrialization. Gaynor said there were mysteries about its residents that people could put together from examining the state of the abandoned home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://kotaku.com/5935262/how-modern-japanese-ruins-inspired-a-computer-game/ | title = How Modern Japanese Ruins Inspired a Computer Game | first = Brian | last= Ashcroft | date = 16 August 2012 | accessdate = 16 August 2018 | work = [[Kotaku]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaynor statesd that ''Minerva's Den'' was more focused on environmental storytelling than action-driven gameplay, and set the approach and necessary design elements they needed for ''Gone Home''.&lt;ref name="pcgamersn 2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamesn.com/bioshock-infinite/gone-home-tacoma | title = The BioShock games were pre-production for Gone Home | first = Jeremy | last = Peel | date = 9 August 2017 | accessdate = 9 August 2017 | work = [[PCGamesN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements that informed ''Gone Home'' from their ''BioShock'' experience was non-linear levels to explore, and discovering narrative elements through audio logs that the player would have to actively seek out, both which supported the exploration elements of the game.&lt;ref name="pcgamer 2013"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.pcgamer.com/gone-home-steve-gaynor-interview/ | title = Gone Home interview with Steve Gaynor: BioShock, the '90s, and what makes a "game" | first = Tyler | last=  Wilde | date =5 April 2013 | accessdate = 15 August 2018 | work = [[PC Gamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaynor also considered the approach that [[Looking Glass Studios]] used for developing [[immersive sim]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/features/2015/4/6/8315901/looking-glass-gone-home |title = The Looking Glass Philosophy Behind Gone Home | first = Mike | last = Mahardy | date = 6 April 2018 | accessdate =  17 August 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; One challenge that Fullbright considered was that not every player would necessarily find every narrative clue for the various plot elements, and so it was necessary for them to make the story flexible enough that the player could understand these narratives without necessarily seeing every element they designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/arts/video-games/in-gone-home-a-family-mystery-unfolds.html | title = Student’s Trip Ends; A Mystery Just Begins | first = Chris | last = Sullentop | date = 18 August 2013 | accessdate= 16 August 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaynor was aware this approach to a game would be considered unconventional, so they did not set out to make something avant-garde but instead more as a proof of concept that such games could be immersive to draw the player into to fully explore and come to understand the narrative themselves.&lt;ref name=ign-2012/&gt;

The game features music from the [[riot grrrl]] bands [[Heavens to Betsy]] and [[Bratmobile]]; Fullbright knew of their Portland-based label [[Kill Rock Stars]], and worked early on with them to secure the rights to the music once they had settled on the locale and time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/03/21/gone-home-trailer-announces-music-from-90s-riot-grrrl-bands/ | author=Wilde, Tyler | title=Gone Home trailer announces music from ’90s riot grrrl bands Heavens to Betsy and Bratmobile | work=[[PC Gamer]] | date=21 March 2013 | accessdate=5 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/gone-home-women-in-video-games/ | title = Why This Indie Game Studio Chose a Feminist Drama Over Guns and Zombies | first = Matt | last = Connelly | date = 20 September 2013 | accessdate = 16 August 2018 | work = [[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; After showing the game at Grrrl Front Fest, a Portland riot grrrl music festival, it attracted the attention of a local band, The Youngins, who went on to provide the music for Girlscout, the fictional band in the game.&lt;ref name=EdgeProfile/&gt;&lt;ref name=music&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thefullbrightcompany.com/2013/08/14/the-music-of-gone-home/ | author=Gaynor, Steve | title=The Music of Gone Home | publisher=The Fullbright Company | date=14 August 2013 | accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's original musical score was composed by [[Chris Remo]], Gaynor's friend and co-host from the ''[[Idle Thumbs]]'' podcast, and featuring over 30 minutes of music that accompany the game's main exploration gameplay, with unique music also scored to each of the game's audio logs.&lt;ref name=music/&gt;

''Gone Home'' received very positive reviews from game journalists. At [[Metacritic]], the game holds an 86/100 score based on 56 critic reviews.&lt;ref name="MCPC" /&gt;

Emily Morganti for ''[[Adventure Gamers]]'' commented that ''Gone Home'' had a "realistic, engrossing story that's beautifully told through environmental clues and audio narration" and that "many people read books for the opportunity to see life through someone else’s eyes, but it’s rare for a game to do it as well as this one does."&lt;ref name="AdventureGamers"/&gt; The ''[[Financial Post]]''{{'}}s Matthew Braga also noted that "This is a game that some will hold up as forward-thinking evidence in the ongoing debate of games-as-art", adding that the game was made to "plumb the depths of experience outside of gaming's typically targeted white, male, youthful core."&lt;ref name="FinancialPost"/&gt; However, ''[[Eurogamer]]'' editor Oli Welsh stated "The Fullbright Company has built a fine house for intimate storytelling in games, but it hasn't found the story to live in it yet."&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt;

The game's LGBT themes were praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2013/8/19/4627606/opinion-finding-someone-like-me-in-gone-home | title = Opinion: Finding someone like me in Gone Home | first=   Danielle | last = Riendeau  |date = 19 August 2013 | accessdate =15 August 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/outward/2013/11/12/video_games_embrace_gay_romance_from_the_ballad_of_gay_tony_to_the_last.html | title = The Gaying of Video Games | first = Terry | last = Mulcahy | date = 12 November 2013 | accessdate = 15 August 2018 | work = [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fullbright reported receiving numerous feedback not only from LGBT players of the game that appreciated how they told the story and how such people have to do deal with rejection by their family, but also from players who had opposed LGBT rights who found the game presented the issues related to LGBT to change their mind on the subject.&lt;ref name="pcgames 2015"/&gt; Fullbright also received some criticism from players from focusing on LGBT themes at the expense of other story elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/apr/10/sharing-joysticks-how-video-games-are-opening-up-to-lgbt-themes | title=

Some reporters have considered the question of whether ''Gone Home'' should be considered a video game, as it lacks the normal interactivity one would normally have with a video game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2013/08/gone-home-review/ | title= Gone Home: A Videogame, Without All That Pesky Videogame In The Way | first=  Chris | last= Kohler | date= 15 August 2013 | accessdate = 15 August 2018 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaynor asserted that ''Gone Home'' was specifically developed for the video game medium, stating that they considered it an "edited discussion" between Fullbright and the player, as "[t]he content that you encounter appears differently than for someone else. It is unique to each user and their interpretation. The interactivity of it makes the experience unique to yourself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/31/5566098/gone-home-is-it-a-game | title = When is a game not a game? | first = Brian | last = Crecente | date = 31 March 2014 | accessdate = 15 August 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgamer 2013"/&gt; Gaynor used the example of the ability to turn lights on or off in any room in the house as an example of this. They included this interactivity as they had developed the game, they found that this gave a means for players to track if they had been within a room before or not, since the house starts otherwise dark, so he considered this one method by which they know what players would likely want to do and providing them means for them to do that, thus making the experience interactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/213612/What_makes_Gone_Home_a_game.php | title = What makes Gone Home a game? | first = Brandon | last = Sheffield | date = 20 March 2014 | accessdate = 15 August 2018 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of interactivity led to ''Gone Home'' to be derogatorily called "walking simulators" at its release, though since then, the industry has come to accept "walking simulators" to describe similarly contemplative narrative games with little direct interactivity, like ''[[The Stanley Parable]]'', ''[[Firewatch]]'', and ''[[What Remains of Edith Finch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/06/28/walking-simulator-proteus-ed-key-ricky-haggett/ | title = Self-Interviewing Devs: Proteus And "Walking Simulators" | first = Alice | last = O'Conner | date = 28 June 2014 | accessdate = 15 August 2018 | work = [[Rock Paper Shotgun]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.salon.com/2017/11/11/a-brief-history-of-the-walking-simulator-gamings-most-detested-genre/ | title = A brief history of the "walking simulator," gaming’s most detested genre | first = Nicole | last =Clark | date = 11 November 2017 | accessdate = 15 August 2018 | work = [[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gone Home''{{'}}s approach to exploratory storytelling was a point of influence for parts of ''[[Uncharted 4: A Thief's End]]'' and ''[[Prey (2017 video game)|Prey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2016/4/4/11358228/uncharted-4-preview-single-player-story-hands-on-madagascar-ps4 | title = Uncharted 4 shines by making time for the quiet moments | first =Samit | last =Sarkar | date = 4 April 2016 | accessdate =  16 August 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://waypoint.vice.com/en_us/article/8x4j5b/how-the-queer-indie-game-gone-home-influenced-prey | title = How the Queer Indie Game 'Gone Home' Influenced 'Prey' | first = Danielle | last = Riendeau | date = 24 May 2017 | accessdate = 16 August 2018 | work = [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to both the atypical nature of ''Gone Home'' and its narrative centered around LGBT issues, it became a central point of discussion at the onset of the [[Gamergate controversy]] in August 2014. A small portion of video game players that supported the apparent Gamergate movement criticized games like ''Gone Home'' and ''[[Depression Quest]]'' for lacking the qualities of normal video games and yet gained critical praise from the gaming press, as well as forcing players to accept topics like LGBT issues. Critics countered that these elements are part of considering [[video games as an art form]], demonstrating how the medium is changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/10/29/gamergate-reopens-the-debate-over-video-games-as-art | title = Gamergate reopens the debate over video games as art | first = Alyssa | last = Rosenberg | date = 29 October 2014 | accessdate = 15 August 2018 | work = [[The Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/26/opinion/sunday/the-disheartening-gamergate-campaign.html | title= Can Video Games Survive? | first = Chris | last =Sullentop | date = 26 October 2014 | accessdate = 15 August 2018 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/7/17827216/gone-home-nintendo-switch-steve-gaynor-interview | title = As Gone Home turns five, we look back at its polarizing legacy | first=  Allegra | last=  Frank  |date = 7 September 2018 | accessdate = 7 September 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hawkeye State''' is a nickname for the state of [[Iowa]].  According to the state's tourism web site, "Two Iowa promoters from [[Burlington, Iowa|Burlington]] are believed to have popularized the name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traveliowa.com/aspx/general/dynamicpage.aspx?id=37|title=State Symbols: Iowa Tourism Map, Travel Guide, Things to Do: Travel Iowa|accessdate=2013-10-12|publisher=Iowa Economic Development|author=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nickname was given approval by [[Iowa Territory|territorial officials]] in 1838, eight years before Iowa became a state.

The men responsible for the promotion of this nickname are thought to be Judge [[David Rorer]] of Burlington and newspaper publisher [[James G. Edwards]]. The city of Burlington had been established in 1833 after the previous year's [[Black Hawk War]]. Edwards changed the name of his Burlington newspaper, ''The Iowa Patriot'', to ''The Hawk-Eye and Iowa Patriot'' in tribute to friend [[Chief Black Hawk]], a [[Sauk people|Sauk]] leader. Edwards proposed the nickname "Hawk-eyes" in 1838 to "...rescue from oblivion a memento, at least, of the name of the old chief", Black Hawk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cYQUAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22at%20least%20of%20the%20name%20of%20the%20old%20chief%22&amp;pg=PA425#v=onepage&amp;q=%22at%20least%20of%20the%20name%20of%20the%20old%20chief%22&amp;f=false | title=The history of Des Moines County, Iowa | year=1879 | pages=425}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Iowa]]'s athletic teams are nicknamed the [[Hawkeyes]] and feature a mascot named [[Herky the Hawk]]. 

The University of Iowa borrowed its athletic nickname from the state of Iowa. The name Hawkeye was originally applied to a hero in a fictional novel, [[The Last of the Mohicans]], written by [[James Fenimore Cooper]]; the author had the [[Lenape|Delaware Indians]] bestow the name on a white scout who lived and hunted with them.

In 1838, 12 years after the book was published, people in the territory of Iowa acquired the nickname, chiefly through the efforts of Judge David Rorer of Burlington and James G. Edwards of Fort Madison. Edwards, editor of the Fort Madison Patriot, moved his newspaper to Burlington in 1843 and renamed it the Burlington Hawkeye. The two men continued their campaign to popularize the name and were rewarded when territorial officials gave it their formal approval.

The Hawkeye nickname gained a tangible symbol in 1948 when a cartoon character, later to be named [[Herky the Hawk]], was hatched. The creator was Richard Spencer III, instructor of journalism. The impish hawk was an immediate hit and he acquired a name through a statewide contest staged by the UI Athletic Department. John Franklin, a Belle Plaine alumnus, was the man who suggested Herky.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawkeyesports.com/trads/herky.html University of Iowa Athletics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019050234/http://www.hawkeyesports.com/trads/herky.html |date=2012-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Japan Radio Co., Ltd.'''|日本無線株式会社|Nihon Musen Kabushiki-gaisha}} is a [[Japan]]ese company specialising in the field of [[wireless]] electronics for the communications industry.

== History ==
Established in 1915, the company has produced a wide variety of products including [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[electronics]], measuring equipment for [[telecommunication]], [[radio broadcasting]] equipment, and [[amateur radio]] equipment, including the JST-145dx/JST-245dx HF transceivers, which were the last amateur radio transceivers produced by JRC, ending in 2002.

Even though these transceivers have been out of production {{As of|April 2015|alt=over 10 years}}, they still compete in performance with current{{When|date=April 2015}} high-end amateur transceivers available from other amateur radio manufacturers today,{{When|date=April 2015}} and have become prized possessions of the hams that are fortunate enough to own one. JRC still supports these radios through 2015, per information on their Web site.

'''La Rampa''' (also known as Calle 23) is a street in the [[Vedado]] district of [[Havana]], [[Cuba]].

La Rampa runs from the [[Malecón, Havana|Malecón]] to Calle L, and passes by airline offices, cinemas, nightclubs, and office buildings. La Rampa, which means “the slope” in Spanish, is the last stretch of the famous Calle 23, leading up to the center of [[Vedado]]. Built in 1930, the location previously was used for a battery of canons that protected the city from attack. In the 1950s, this was the area where many of the city's highest buildings were built, including Someillán and the Mountain Lopez. Many hotels, clubs and shops also crowded along this stretch, such as [[Hotel Tryp Habana Libre|Habana Libre]], the former site of the Hilton Hotel, the [[Hotel Capri]] and the [[Hotel Nacional]]. The country’s most famous ice cream shop [[Coppelia (ice cream parlor)|Coppelia]] is also close to the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.havanainsider.com/la-rampa/|title=La Rampa|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the corner of 23rd and L is the [[Radiocentro CMQ Building]] and further down the block is the [[Edificio del Seguro Médico, Havana|Edificio del Seguro Médico]] by Antonio Quintana.

'''Milton Almeida dos Santos''' (born May 3, 1926 – June 24, 2001) was a Brazilian [[geographer]] who had a degree in [[law]]. He became known for pioneer works in various fields in [[geography]], notably [[urban development]] in [[developing countries]]. He is considered the father of [[Critical geography|Critical Geography]] in Brazil.

==Biography==
Santos was born in [[Brotas de Macaúbas]], [[Bahia]], [[Brazil]] on May 3, 1926.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-124a.htm Revista Scripta Nova - University of Barcelona&lt;/ref&gt; Santos' parents were elementary school teachers and taught him at home how to read and write. By the time he was eight, he had already completed the equivalent of an elementary school education. Milton's father was a descendant from slaves, which gave Santos motivation to study. From 1934 to 1936, he lived in [[Alcobaça (Bahia)|Alcobaça]], learning [[French language|French]] and good manners.

Santos taught geography to high school students to finance university classes in [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-124a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated majoring in law yet he did not practice it. He instead took and passed a public examination for secondary teacher and went to teach geography in [[Ilhéus]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-124a.htm Revista Scripta Nova - University of Barcelona&lt;/ref&gt;

Santos went on to study and teach in [[Europe]], [[Americas|America]], and [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-124a.htm Revista Scripta Nova - University of Barcelona&lt;/ref&gt; Although he is considered exiled by the military government, he was actually forbidden to leave the country and could only do so after a negotiation between the French ambassador and the government. He turned the painful exile that the [[military dictatorship]] had imposed on him for thirteen years into benefits. Milton Santos wrote more than forty books in several languages. His works became a reference for all those who intended to understand the world in a critical way, that is to say, not in a negative way necessarily, but applying concepts of Critical Geography and the [[Frankfurt School]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-124a.htm Revista Scripta Nova - University of Barcelona&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his works include "Por Uma Geografia Nova" (1978) and "A Natureza do Espaço" (1996). His work "O Espaço Dividido", in which Santos develops a theory on urban development in underdeveloped countries, is considered a geography classic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-124a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://educacao.uol.com.br/biografias/milton-santos.jhtm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibe.usp.br/index.php/pt/noticias/26-universidade-reflete-sobre-legado-do-geografo-milton-santos&lt;/ref&gt;

Milton Santos went on to win the [[Vautrin Lud International Geography Prize]] - the highest award that can be gained in the field of geography. The award is modeled after the [[Nobel Prize]] and is considered and colloquially called the Nobel Prize for geography.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ub.edu/geocrit/sn/sn-124a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://educacao.uol.com.br/biografias/milton-santos.jhtm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibe.usp.br/index.php/pt/noticias/26-universidade-reflete-sobre-legado-do-geografo-milton-santos&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Milton Santos died in [[São Paulo]], on June 24, 2001, at age 75,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A obra de Milton Santos | website=GGN | date=22 January 2013 | url=https://jornalggn.com.br/blog/iv-avatar-do-rio-ooooooooo/a-obra-de-milton-santos| language=Portuguese |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of [[prostate cancer]] diagnosed about seven years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Professor Milton Santos morre de câncer na próstata aos 75 anos | website=Folha De S.

A nearest neighbor function can be contrasted with a [[spherical contact distribution function]], which is not defined in reference to some initial point but rather as the probability distribution of the radius of a sphere when it first encounters or makes contact with a point of a point process.

==Point process notation==
{{Main|Point process notation}}

Point processes are mathematical objects that are defined on some underlying [[mathematical space]]. Since these processes are often used to represent collections of points randomly scattered in space, time or both, the underlying space is usually ''d''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] denoted here by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \textbf{R}^{ d}&lt;/math&gt;, but they can be defined on more [[Abstraction (mathematics)|abstract]] mathematical spaces.&lt;ref name="daleyPPII2008"/&gt;

Point processes have a number of interpretations, which is reflected by the various types of [[point process notation]].&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB2"&gt;F. Baccelli and B. Błaszczyszyn. ''Stochastic Geometry and Wireless Networks, Volume II – Applications'', volume 4, No 1–2 of ''Foundations and Trends in Networking''. NoW Publishers, 2009.

&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a point &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x&lt;/math&gt; belongs to or is a member of a point process, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt;, then this can be written as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x\in {N},&lt;/math&gt;

and represents the point process being interpreted as a random [[Set (mathematics)|set]]. Alternatively, the number of points of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; located in some [[Borel set]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt; is often written as:&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"&gt;{{cite doi|10.1201/9780203496930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}(B), &lt;/math&gt;

which reflects a [[random measure]] interpretation for point processes. These two notations are often used in parallel or interchangeably.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB1"&gt;{{cite doi|10.1561/1300000006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==

===Nearest neighbor function===

The nearest neighbor function, as opposed to the [[spherical contact distribution function]], is defined in relation to some point of a point process already existing in some region of space. More precisely, for some point in the point process &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt;, the nearest neighbor function is the probability distribution of the distance from that point to the nearest or closest neighboring point.

To define this function for a point located in &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \textbf{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; at, for example, the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle o&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle b(o,r)&lt;/math&gt; of radius &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r&lt;/math&gt; centered at the [[Origin (mathematics)|origin]] ''o'' is considered. Given a point of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; existing at &lt;math&gt;\textstyle o&lt;/math&gt;, then the '''nearest neighbor function''' is defined as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; D_o(r)=1-P({N}(b(o,r))=1\mid o). &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle P({N}(b(o,r))=1\mid o)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the conditional probability that there is one point of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; located in &lt;math&gt;\textstyle b(o,r)&lt;/math&gt; given there is a point of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; located at &lt;math&gt;\textstyle o&lt;/math&gt;.

The reference point need not be at the origin, and can be located at an arbitrary point &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x\in\textbf{R}^d&lt;/math&gt;. Given a point of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; existing at &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x&lt;/math&gt;, then the '''nearest neighbor function''', is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; D_x(r)=1-P({N}(b(x,r))=1\mid x). &lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

Mathematical expressions of the nearest neighbor distribution only exist for a few point processes.

===Poisson point process===

For a [[Poisson point process]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \textbf{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; with [[Moment measure#First moment measure|intensity measure]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Lambda&lt;/math&gt; the nearest neighbor function is:

:&lt;math&gt; D_x(r)=1-e^{-\Lambda(b(x,r))}, &lt;/math&gt;

which for the homogeneous case becomes

:&lt;math&gt; D_x(r)=1-e^{-\lambda |b(x,r)|}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |b(x,r)|&lt;/math&gt; denotes the volume (or more specifically, the [[Lebesgue measure]]) of the (hyper) ball of radius &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r&lt;/math&gt;. In the plane &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \textbf{R}^2&lt;/math&gt; with the reference point located at the origin, this becomes

:&lt;math&gt; D_x(r)=1-e^{-\lambda \pi r^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Relationship to other functions==

===Spherical contact distribution function===

In general, the [[spherical contact distribution function]] and the corresponding nearest neighbor function are not equal. However, these two functions are identical for Poisson point processes.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; In fact, this characteristic is due to a unique property of Poisson processes and their Palm distributions, which forms part of the result known as the ''Slivnyak–Mecke''&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt; or ''Slivnyak's theorem''.&lt;ref name="baddeley2007spatial"/&gt;

==={{mvar|J}}-function===

The fact that the spherical distribution function ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') and nearest neighbor function ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''o''&lt;/sub&gt;(''r'') are identical for the Poisson point process can be used to statistically test if point process data appears to be that of a Poisson point process. For example, in spatial statistics the {{mvar|J}}-function is defined for all {{mvar|r}}&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; J(r)=\frac{1-D_o(r)}{1-H_s(r)} &lt;/math&gt;

For a Poisson point process, the {{mvar|J}} function is simply {{math|''J''(''r'')}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, hence why it is used as a [[Non-parametric statistics|non-parametric]] test for whether data behaves as though it were from a Poisson process. It is, however, thought possible to construct non-Poisson point processes for which {{math|''J''(''r'')}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&lt;ref name="bedford1997remark"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Bedford, T, Van den Berg, J| title=A remark on the Van Lieshout and Baddeley J-function for point processes| journal=Advances in Applied Probability| year=1997| pages=19–25| publisher=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; but such counterexamples are viewed as somewhat 'artificial' by some and exist for other statistical tests.&lt;ref name="foxall2002nonparametric"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Foxall, Rob, Baddeley, Adrian| title=Nonparametric measures of association between a spatial point process and a random set, with geological applications| journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C| year=2002| volume=51| number=2| pages=165–182| publisher=Wiley Online Library| doi=10.1111/1467-9876.00261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, {{mvar|J}}-function serves as one way (others include using [[factorial moment measure]]s&lt;ref name="baddeley2007spatial"/&gt;) to measure the interaction between points in a point process.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3435">{{Refimprove|date=March 2017}}
A '''nectar source''' is a flowering plant that produces [[nectar (plant)|nectar]] as part of its reproductive strategy. These plants create [[nectar]], which attract pollinating [[insects]] and sometimes other animals such as [[birds]].

Nectar source plants are important for [[beekeeping]], as well as in [[agriculture]] and [[horticulture]]. Their use is particularly important for [[organic agriculture]] and [[organic horticulture]], where they serve not only to attract pollinators for crops, but also provide habitat for [[beneficial insects]] and other animals that provide pest control.

In gardens, nectar sources are often provided to attract [[butterflies]] and [[hummingbirds]] as well.

==For honey bees==
{{See also|List of Northern American nectar sources for honey bees}}
While many plants produce nectar, [[beekeepers]] prefer to place their hives near certain plants, for the qualities of the [[honey]] produced. Certain agricultural crops, such as [[clover]] and [[buckwheat]], are used to make [[Monofloral honey|specific honeys]], which often command a premium price.

Some plants are avoided by some beekeepers (and sought out by others) due to substances found in the nectar. For example, honey made from the nectar of [[rhododendron]]s ("[[mad honey]]") contains chemicals that cause light-headedness, hallucinations and are believed by some to improve sexual performance. In slightly larger quantities "mad honey" is toxic, and shopkeepers are careful how they sell it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://modernfarmer.com/2014/09/strange-history-hallucinogenic-mad-honey/|title=The Strange History of 'Mad Honey'|work= Modern Farmer|date=4 September 2014|publisher=|author=Bryce, Emma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==For pollinators==
Pollinating insects, including honey bees and many other insects, are a necessary element when growing most crops (though cereal grain crops are wind-pollinated). By maintaining a constant supply of nectar in areas adjacent to a field or vegetable garden throughout the growing season, farmers and gardeners ensure that their crops can be pollinated when they flower.

==For beneficial insects==
Particularly [[organic horticulture]] and [[organic farming]], nectar sources are maintained to attract and maintain a population of [[beneficial insects]]. Insects such as predatory wasps, [[hoverflies]] and [[Chrysopidae|lacewings]] feed on nectar as adults, while their larval forms are predatory and feed on garden pests.

==For butterflies and hummingbirds==
In gardens, the presence of butterflies and hummingbirds is often encouraged. Butterflies are attracted by most good nectar sources, though there are particular plants they seem to prefer. Certain plants are also grown as a food source for their caterpillars.

Hummingbirds feed on tubular flowers, using their long, siphoning beaks. Many plants in the mint family, [[Lamiaceae]], are used to attract hummingbirds.

A '''river''' is a natural flowing [[watercourse]], usually [[freshwater]], flowing towards an [[ocean]], [[sea]], [[lake]] or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as [[stream]], creek, brook, rivulet, and [[rill]]. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to  [[Geographical feature|geographic features]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm |title= GNIS FAQ |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate= 26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are "run" in some parts of the United States, "[[burn (topography)|burn]]" in Scotland and northeast England, and "beck" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = WordNet Search: River | publisher = The Trustees of Princeton University | accessdate = 2 October 2009 | url = http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=river&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;h=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not always: the language is vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Domestic Names: Frequently Asked Question (FAQs), #17 | publisher = United States Geological Survey | accessdate = 2 October 2009 | url = http://geonames.usgs.gov/domestic/faqs.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rivers are part of the [[hydrological cycle]]; water generally collects in a river from [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] through a [[drainage basin]] from [[surface runoff]] and other sources such as [[groundwater recharge]], [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]], and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (e.g., from [[glacier]]s). Potamology is the scientific study of rivers, while [[limnology]] is the study of inland waters in general.

==Topography==
[[File:Melting Toe of Athabasca Glacier.jpg|thumb|right|Melting toe of Athabasca Glacier, [[Jasper National Park]], [[Alberta|Alberta, Canada]]]]
[[File:Loboc river.png|thumbnail|The Loboc River in [[Bohol]], [[Philippines]]]]
[[File:Horseshoe_Bend_TC_27-09-2012_15-34-14.jpg|thumbnail|The Colorado River at [[Horseshoe Bend (Arizona)|Horseshoe Bend]], [[Arizona]]]]

A river begins at a [[river source|source]] (or more often several sources), follows a path called a course, and ends at a [[river mouth|mouth]] or mouths. The water in a river is usually confined to a [[stream channel|channel]], made up of a [[stream bed]] between [[stream bank|banks]]. In larger rivers there is often also a wider [[floodplain]] shaped by [[flood]]-waters over-topping the channel. Floodplains may be very wide in relation to the size of the river channel. This distinction between river channel and floodplain can be blurred, especially in urban areas where the floodplain of a river channel can become greatly developed by housing and industry.

Rivers can flow down mountains, through [[valleys]] ([[depression (geology)|depressions]]) or along [[plain]]s, and can create [[canyons]] or gorges.

The term upriver (or upstream) refers to the direction towards the source of the river, i.e. against the direction of flow. Likewise, the term downriver (or downstream) describes the direction towards the mouth of the river, in which the [[current (stream)|current]] flows.

The term left bank refers to the left bank in the direction of flow, right bank to the right.

The river channel typically contains a single stream of water, but some rivers flow as several interconnecting streams of water, producing a [[braided river]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dWMqaOTqSqcC&amp;pg=PA308|title=Earth's Natural Resources|last=Walther|first=John V.|date=15 February 2013|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers|isbn=978-1-4496-3234-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive braided rivers are now found in only a few regions worldwide,{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} such as the [[South Island]] of [[New Zealand]]. They also occur on [[peneplain]]s and some of the larger [[river delta]]s. [[Anastomosing stream|Anastamosing rivers]] are similar to braided rivers and are quite rare. They have multiple sinuous channels carrying large volumes of sediment. There are rare cases of [[river bifurcation]] in which a river divides and the resultant flows ending in different seas. An example is the [[bifurcation of Nerodime River]] in [[Kosovo]].

A river flowing in its channel is a source of energy which acts on the river channel to change its shape and form. In 1757, the German hydrologist [[Albert Brahms]] empirically observed that the submerged weight of objects that may be carried away by a river is proportional to the sixth power of the river flow speed.&lt;ref name="Garde, 1995, 14"/&gt; This formulation is also sometimes called Airy's law.&lt;ref name="Garde, 1995, 19"/&gt; Thus, if the speed of flow is doubled, the flow would dislodge objects with 64 times as much submerged weight. In mountainous torrential zones this can be seen as erosion channels through hard rocks and the creation of sands and gravels from the destruction of larger rocks. A river valley that was created from a U-shaped [[glaciated]] valley, can often easily be identified by the V-shaped channel that it has carved. In the middle reaches where a river flows over flatter land, [[meander]]s may form through erosion of the river banks and deposition on the inside of bends. Sometimes the river will cut off a loop, shortening the channel and forming an [[oxbow lake]] or [[billabong]]. Rivers that carry large amounts of [[sediment]] may develop conspicuous deltas at their mouths. Rivers whose mouths are in saline [[tide|tidal]] waters may form [[estuary|estuaries]].

Throughout the course of the river, the total volume of water transported downstream will often be a combination of the free water flow together with a substantial volume flowing through sub-surface rocks and gravels that underlie the river and its [[floodplain]] (called the [[hyporheic zone]]). For many rivers in large valleys, this unseen component of flow may greatly exceed the visible flow.

===Subsurface streams===
Most but not all rivers flow on the surface. [[Subterranean river]]s flow underground in [[cave]]s or caverns. Such rivers are frequently found in regions with [[limestone]] [[geologic formation]]s. [[Subglacial stream]]s are the braided rivers that flow at the beds of glaciers and [[ice sheet]]s, permitting meltwater to be discharged at the front of the glacier. Because of the gradient in [[pressure]] due to the overlying weight of the glacier, such streams can even flow uphill.

===Permanence of flow===
{{Main|Intermittent river}}
An intermittent river (or [[ephemeral]] river) only flows occasionally and can be dry for several years at a time. These rivers are found in regions with limited or highly variable rainfall, or can occur because of geologic conditions such as a highly permeable river bed. Some ephemeral rivers flow during the summer months but not in the winter. Such rivers are typically fed from chalk aquifers which recharge from winter rainfall. In England these rivers are called ''bournes'' and give their name to places such as [[Bournemouth]] and [[Eastbourne]]. Even in humid regions, the location where flow begins in the smallest tributary streams generally moves upstream in response to precipitation and downstream in its absence or when active summer vegetation diverts water for [[evapotranspiration]]. Normally-dry rivers in arid zones are often identified as [[Arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] or other regional names.

The meltwater from large hailstorms can create a [[slurry]] of water, hail and sand or soil, forming temporary rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabayreview.com/news/sand-river-in-iraq/1211/ "Sand River" in Iraq is actually a rapid movement of ice blocks].

Rivers have been classified by many criteria including their [[topography]], their [[biotic component|biotic]] status, and their relevance to white water [[rafting]] or [[canoe]]ing activities.

===Topographical classification===
Rivers can generally be classified as either [[alluvial river|alluvial]], [[bedrock river|bedrock]], or some mix of the two. Alluvial rivers have channels and floodplains that are self-formed in unconsolidated or weakly consolidated sediments. They [[bank erosion|erode]] their [[streambank|bank]]s and deposit material on [[bar (river morphology)|bars]] and their [[floodplain]]s. Bedrock rivers form when the river downcuts through the modern sediments and into the underlying bedrock. This occurs in regions that have experienced some kind of uplift (thereby steepening river gradients) or in which a particular hard [[lithology]] causes a river to have a steepened reach that has not been covered in modern [[alluvium]]. Bedrock rivers very often contain alluvium on their beds; this material is important in eroding and sculpting the channel. Rivers that go through patches of bedrock and patches of deep alluvial cover are classified as mixed bedrock-alluvial.

Alluvial rivers can be further classified by their [[channel pattern]] as meandering, braided, wandering, anastomose, or straight. The morphology of an alluvial river reach is controlled by a combination of sediment supply, substrate composition, discharge, vegetation, and bed [[aggradation]].

At the start of the 20th century [[William Morris Davis]] devised the "[[cycle of erosion]]" method of classifying rivers based on their "age". Although Davis's system is still found in many books today, after the 1950s and 1960s it became increasingly criticized and rejected by geomorphologists. His scheme did not produce testable hypotheses and was therefore deemed non-scientific.&lt;ref name="Castree2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Castree|first=Noel|title=Questioning geography: fundamental debates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nrbzXM_woFQC&amp;pg=PA84|year=2006|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-1-4051-0192-9|pages=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of Davis's river "ages" include:

*'''Youthful river''': A river with a steep gradient that has very few tributaries and flows quickly. Its channels erode deeper rather than wider. Examples are the [[Brazos River|Brazos]], [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity]] and [[Ebro River|Ebro]] rivers.
*'''Mature river''': A river with a gradient that is less steep than those of youthful rivers and flows more slowly. A mature river is fed by many tributaries and has more discharge than a youthful river. Its channels erode wider rather than deeper. Examples are the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint Lawrence]], [[Danube River|Danube]], [[Ohio River|Ohio]], [[River Thames|Thames]] and [[Paraná River|Paraná]] rivers.
*'''Old river''': A river with a low gradient and low erosive energy. Old rivers are characterized by flood plains. Examples are the [[Yellow River|Yellow]], lower [[Ganges]], [[Tigris]], [[Euphrates]], [[Indus River|Indus]] and lower [[Nile]] rivers.
*'''Rejuvenated river''': A river with a gradient that is raised by [[tectonics|tectonic]] uplift. Examples are the [[Rio Grande]] and [[Colorado River]].

The ways in which a river's characteristics vary between its upper and lower course are summarized by the [[Bradshaw model]]. Power-law relationships between channel slope, depth, and width are given as a function of discharge by "[[river regime]]".

===Biotic classification===
There are several systems of classification based on biotic conditions typically assigning classes from the most [[oligotrophic]] or unpolluted through to the most [[eutrophic]] or polluted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120620161237/http://www.sepa.org.uk/science_and_research/classification_schemes/river_classifications_scheme.aspx River Classification scheme]. sepa.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Other systems are based on a whole eco-system approach such as developed by the New Zealand Ministry for the Environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100522192903/http://www.maf.govt.nz/mafnet/publications/rmupdate/rm14/rm14-04.htm NZ’s River Environment Classification system (REC)]. maf.govt.nz&lt;/ref&gt;
In Europe, the requirements of the [[Water Framework Directive]] has led to the development of a wide range of classification methods including classifications based on fishery status&lt;ref&gt;Noble, Richard and Cowx, Ian et al. (May 2002) [http://fame.boku.ac.at/downloads/D1_2_typology_and%20species_classification.pdf Compilation and harmonisation of fish species classification]. University of Hull, UK. A project under the 5th Framework Programme Energy, Environment and Sustainable Management. Key Action 1: Sustainable Management and Quality of Water&lt;/ref&gt;
A system of river zonation used in [[francophone]] communities&lt;ref name=IlliesBotosaneanu1963 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkes1975 /&gt;  divides rivers into three primary zones:
* The ''crenon'' is the uppermost zone at the source of the river. It is further divided into the eucrenon (spring or boil zone) and the hypocrenon (brook or headstream zone). These areas have low temperatures, reduced oxygen content and slow moving water.
* The ''rhithron'' is the upstream portion of the river that follows the crenon. It has relatively cool temperatures, high oxygen levels, and fast, turbulent, swift flow.
* The ''potamon'' is the remaining downstream stretch of river. It has warmer temperatures, lower oxygen levels, slow flow and sandier bottoms.

===Whitewater classification===
The  [[International Scale of River Difficulty]] is used to rate the challenges of navigation—particularly those with rapids. Class I is the easiest and Class VI is the hardest.

===Stream order classification===
The [[Strahler Stream Order]] ranks rivers based on the connectivity and hierarchy of contributing tributaries. Headwaters are first order while the [[Amazon River]] is twelfth order. Approximately 80% of the rivers and streams in the world are of the first and second order.

In certain languages, distinctions are made among rivers based on their stream order. In French, for example, rivers that run to the sea are called ''fleuve'', while other rivers are called ''rivière''. For example, in [[Canada]], the [[Churchill River (Hudson Bay)|Churchill River]] in [[Manitoba]] is called ''la rivière Churchill'' as it runs to [[Hudson Bay]], but the [[Churchill River (Atlantic)|Churchill River]] in [[Labrador]] is called ''le fleuve Churchill'' as it runs to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. As most rivers in France are known by their names only without the word ''rivière'' or ''fleuve'' (e.g. ''la [[Seine]]'', not ''le fleuve Seine'', even though the Seine is classed as a ''fleuve''), one of the most prominent rivers in the [[Francophonie]] commonly known as ''fleuve'' is ''le fleuve Saint-Laurent'' (the [[Saint Lawrence River]]).

Since many ''fleuves'' are large and prominent, receiving many tributaries, the word is sometimes used to refer to certain large rivers that flow into other ''fleuves''; however, even small streams that run to the sea are called ''fleuve'' (e.g. ''[[:fr:Fleuve côtier|fleuve côtier]]'', "coastal ''fleuve''").

Rivers have been used as a source of water, for obtaining food, for [[navigation|transport]], as a defensive measure, as a source of [[hydropower]] to drive machinery, for bathing, and as a means of disposing of waste.

Rivers have been used for navigation for thousands of years. The earliest evidence of navigation is found in the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], which existed in northwestern India around 3300 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panda.org/about_our_earth/about_freshwater/rivers/ "WWF – The World's Rivers"]. ''panda.org''.&lt;/ref&gt; Riverine navigation provides a cheap means of transport, and is still used extensively on most major rivers of the world like the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], the [[Ganges River|Ganges]], the [[Nile]], the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], and the [[River Indus|Indus]]. Since river boats are often not regulated, they contribute a large amount to global [[greenhouse gas]] [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emission]]s, and to local cancer due to inhaling of [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] emitted by the transports.&lt;ref name=Meybeck1993 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Albrecht2003 /&gt;

In some heavily forested regions such as [[Scandinavia]] and [[Canada]], [[lumberjack]]s use the river to float felled trees downstream to lumber camps for further processing, saving much effort and cost by transporting the huge heavy logs by natural means.

Rivers have been a source of food since pre-history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.nmp.gov.tw/park01-2.html "National Museum of Prehistory-The Peinan Site-Settlements of the Prehistoric Times&lt;/strong&gt;"]. ''nmp.gov.tw''.&lt;/ref&gt; They are often a rich source of fish and other edible aquatic life, and are a major source of fresh water, which can be used for drinking and [[irrigation]]. Most of the major cities of the world are situated on the banks of rivers. Rivers help to determine the [[urban design|urban form]] of cities and neighbourhoods and their corridors often present opportunities for [[urban renewal]] through the development of [[foreshoreway]]s such as river walks. Rivers also provide an easy means of disposing of waste water and, in much of the less developed world, other [[wastes]].

[[File:Braine-le-Château JPG02.jpg|thumb|right|Watermill in Belgium]]
Fast flowing rivers and waterfalls are widely used as sources of energy, via [[watermill]]s and [[hydroelectric plant]]s. Evidence of watermills shows them in use for many hundreds of years, for instance in [[Orkney]] at [[Dounby Click Mill]]. Prior to the invention of steam power, watermills for grinding [[cereal]]s and for processing [[wool]] and other textiles were common across [[Europe]]. In the 1890s the first machines to generate power from river water were established at places such as [[Cragside]] in [[Northumberland]] and in recent decades there has been a significant increase in the development of large scale power generation from water, especially in wet mountainous regions such as [[Norway]].

The coarse sediments, [[gravel]], and [[sand]], generated and moved by rivers are extensively used in construction. In parts of the world this can generate extensive new lake habitats as gravel pits re-fill with water. In other circumstances it can destabilise the river bed and the course of the river and cause severe damage to spawning fish populations which rely on stable gravel formations for egg laying.

In upland rivers, [[rapid]]s with [[whitewater]] or even [[waterfall]]s occur. Rapids are often used for recreation, such as [[whitewater kayaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0qLSsxFZxqIC&amp;pg=PA25|title=Adventure Sport Physiology|last=Draper|first=Nick|last2=Hodgson|first2=Christopher|date=2008-11-20|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-31913-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rivers have been important in determining political boundaries and defending countries. For example, the [[Danube]] was a long-standing border of the [[Roman Empire]], and today it forms most of the border between [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]. The Mississippi in [[North America]] and the [[Rhine]] in Europe are major east-west boundaries in those continents. The [[Orange River|Orange]] and [[Limpopo River|Limpopo]] Rivers in [[southern Africa]] form the boundaries between provinces and countries along their routes.

==Ecosystem==
{{Main|River ecosystem}}

The organisms in the [[riparian zone]] respond to changes in river channel location and patterns of flow. The ecosystem of rivers is generally described by the [[river continuum concept]], which has some additions and refinements to allow for dams and waterfalls and temporary extensive flooding. The concept describes the river as a system in which the physical parameters, the availability of food particles and the composition of the ecosystem are continuously changing along its length. The food (energy) that remains from the upstream part is used downstream.

The general pattern is that the first order streams contain particulate matter (decaying leaves from the surrounding forests) which is processed there by shredders like [[Plecoptera]] larvae. The products of these shredders are used by collectors, such as [[Hydropsychidae]], and further downstream algae that create the [[primary production]] become the main food source of the organisms. All changes are gradual and the distribution of each species can be described as a [[normal curve]], with the highest density where the conditions are optimal. In rivers [[Ecological succession|succession]] is virtually absent and the composition of the ecosystem stays fixed in time.

==Chemistry==
{{Main|River chemistry}}
The chemistry of rivers is complex and depends on inputs from the atmosphere, the geology through which it travels and the inputs from man's activities. The chemical composition of the water has a large impact on the ecology of that water for both plants and animals and it also affects the uses that may be made of the river water. Understanding and characterising river water chemistry requires a well designed and managed sampling and analysis.

==Brackish water==
{{Further|Brackish water}}
Some rivers generate brackish water by having their river mouth in the ocean. This, in effect creates a unique environment in which certain species are found.

== Flooding ==
{{main|Flood}}
[[File:Trapped woman on a car roof during flash flooding in Toowoomba 2.jpg|thumb|[[Flash flood]]ing caused by a large amount of rain falling in a short amount of time]]

Flooding is a natural part of a river's cycle. The majority of the erosion of river channels and the erosion and deposition on the associated floodplains occur during the [[flood stage]]. In many developed areas, human activity has changed the form of river channels, altering magnitudes and frequencies of flooding. Some examples of this are the building of [[levee]]s, the straightening of channels, and the draining of natural [[wetland]]s. In many cases human activities in rivers and floodplains have dramatically increased the risk of flooding. Straightening rivers allows water to flow more rapidly downstream, increasing the risk of flooding places further downstream. Building on flood plains removes flood storage, which again exacerbates downstream flooding. The building of levees only protects the area behind the levees and not those further downstream. Levees and flood-banks can also increase flooding upstream because of the back-water pressure as the river flow is impeded by the narrow channel banks.

==Flow==
Studying the flows of rivers is one aspect of [[hydrology]].&lt;ref name=Cave /&gt;

===Direction===
[[File:RiverMeanderingCourse.jpg|thumb|River meandering course]]
Rivers flow downhill with their power derived from gravity. The direction can involve all directions of the compass and can be a complex meandering path.&lt;ref name=Rosenberg2006 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosenberg1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rydell1997 /&gt;

Rivers flowing downhill, from river source to river mouth, do not necessarily take the shortest path. For alluvial streams, straight and braided rivers have very low sinuosity and flow directly down hill, while meandering rivers flow from side to side across a valley. Bedrock rivers typically flow in either a [[fractal]] pattern, or a pattern that is determined by weaknesses in the bedrock, such as [[fault (geology)|faults]], [[fracture (geology)|fractures]], or more erodible layers.

===Rate===
{{main|Streamflow}}

[[Volumetric flow rate]], also known as discharge, volume flow rate, and rate of water flow, is the volume of water which passes through a given cross-section of the river channel per unit time. It is typically measured in [[cubic metres per second]] (cumec) or [[cubic feet per second]] (cfs), where 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s = 35.51&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s; it is sometimes also measured in [[litre]]s or [[gallon]]s per second.

Volumetric flow rate can be thought of as the mean velocity of the flow through a given cross-section, times that cross-sectional area. Mean velocity can be approximated through the use of the [[Law of the Wall]]. In general, velocity increases with the depth (or [[hydraulic radius]]) and slope of the river channel, while the cross-sectional area scales with the depth and the width: the double-counting of depth shows the importance of this variable in determining the discharge through the channel.

== Fluvial erosion ==
In the youthful stage;

When the river is subject to [[vertical erosion]], deepening the valley. [[Hydraulic action]] loosens and dislodges the rock. The rivers load further erodes its banks and the river bed. Over time, this will deepen the river bed and create steeper sides which are then weathered.

The steepened nature of the banks causes the sides of the valley to move downslope causing the valley to become [[Valley|V-shaped]].

[[Waterfall]]s also form in the youthful river valley.

Waterfalls usually form where a band of hard rock lies next to a layer of soft rock (easier to erode). [[Weathering|Differential erosion]] occurs as the river can erode the soft rock easier than the hard rock, this leaves the hard rock more elevated and stands out from the river below. [[Hydraulic action]] and [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]] are what erodes the soft rock and the water to fall down to the river bed. A plunge pool forms at the bottom and deepens as a result of hydraulic action and abrasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coolgeography.co.uk/GCSE/Year%2010/PhysicalWorld/Upper%20valley/upper_valley.htm|title=Landforms of the upper valley -|website=www.coolgeography.co.uk|access-date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sediment yield ==
Sediment yield is the total quantity of particulate matter (suspended or bedload) reaching the outlet of a drainage basin over a fixed time frame. Yield is usually expressed as kilograms per square kilometre per year. Sediment delivery processes are affected by a myriad of factors such as drainage area size, basin slope, climate, sediment type (lithology), vegetation cover, and human land use / management practices. The theoretical concept of the 'sediment delivery ratio' (ratio between yield and total amount of sediment eroded) captures the fact that not all of the sediment is eroded within a  certain catchment that reaches out to the outlet (due to, for example, deposition on floodplains). Such storage opportunities are typically increased in catchments of larger size, thus leading to a lower yield and sediment delivery ratio.

==Management==
[[File:River bank repair on the River Avon, Saltford.jpg|thumb|right|River bank repair]]
{{Main|River engineering}}
Rivers are often managed or controlled to make them more useful, or less disruptive, to human activity.
* [[Dam]]s or [[weir]]s may be built to control the flow, store water, or extract energy.
* [[Levee]]s, known as dikes in Europe, may be built to prevent river water from flowing on floodplains or floodways.
* [[Canal]]s connect rivers to one another for [[Aqueduct (water supply)|water transfer]] or [[navigation]].
* River courses may be modified to improve navigation, or straightened to increase the flow rate.

River management is a continuous activity as rivers tend to 'undo' the modifications made by people. Dredged channels silt up, [[sluice|sluice mechanisms]] deteriorate with age, levees and dams may suffer seepage or catastrophic failure. The benefits sought through managing rivers may often be offset by the social and economic costs of mitigating the bad effects of such management. As an example, in parts of the developed world, rivers have been confined within channels to free up flat flood-plain land for development. Floods can inundate such development at high financial cost and often with loss of life.

Rivers are increasingly managed for [[habitat conservation]], as they are critical for many [[aquatic plant|aquatic]] and [[riparian zone|riparian]] plants, [[freshwater fish|resident]] and [[fish migration|migratory fish]]es, [[waterfowl]], [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], [[bird migration|migrating bird]]s, and many [[mammal]]s.

'''Prince Roland Napoléon Bonaparte''' (19 May 1858 – 14 April 1924) was a French prince and president of the [[Société de Géographie]] from 1910 until his death. He was the last direct descendant of [[Lucien Bonaparte]], the genetically senior branch of the family since 1844.

==Biography==
Bonaparte was born in [[Paris]] on 19 May 1858, the son of Prince [[Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte]] and [[Justine Eleanore Ruflin]]. He was a grandson of [[Lucien Bonaparte]], Emperor [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]]'s brother.

Prince Roland was married in [[Paris]] on 18 November 1880, to [[Marie Blanc]] (1859–1882), the daughter of [[François Blanc]]. They had one daughter, [[Princess Marie Bonaparte]] (1882–1962).

In 1886, Bonaparte was part of a scientific expedition that photographed and anatomically measured the [[Sami people|Sami]] inhabitants of Northern Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cwfp.biz/cgi-bin/se/bonaparte_lapons/tm.pl?intro Special Exhibit: Laplander Studies by Roland Bonaparte]. Retrieved August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bonaparte-groupshot.jpg|thumb|300px| Bonaparte in center measuring a Sami woman's head]]

Bonaparte was the President of the [[Société astronomique de France|Société astronomique de France (SAF)]], the French astronomical society, from 1921-1923.&lt;ref name=BSAF1937&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k96721072/f536.item''Bulletin de la Société astronomique de France'', November 1937, plates X-IX]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the death of his cousin Prince [[Prince Napoléon Bonaparte of Canino|Napoléon Charles Bonaparte]] in 1899, he succeeded him as the 6th [[Prince of Canino and Musignano]], but he never assumed the title. With Prince Roland's death in Paris on 14 April 1924, the senior line of the [[House of Bonaparte]] descending from [[Lucien Bonaparte]] became extinct in the male line.

==Legacy==
[[Bonaparte Point]] in [[Antarctica]] was named after him by [[Jean-Baptiste Charcot]]. There is also a small lake on the mountains above the [[Sami people|Coast Sámi]]/[[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] village [[Kvalsund]] which is called Bonapartesjøen - Lake Bonaparte - after his abovementioned visit to the region.

[[File:Shebaa Farms.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the Shebaa Farms]]

{{use dmy dates|date=December 2012}}

'''Shebaa Farms''', also spelled '''Sheba'a Farms''' ({{lang-ar|مزارع شبعا}}, ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Mazāri‘ Šib‘ā}}''; {{lang-he|חוות שבעא}}, ''Havot Sheba‘a'' or הר דוב, ''Har Dov'') is a small strip of disputed land  at the intersection of the [[Lebanese-Syrian border]] and the Israeli-occupied [[Golan Heights]]. The territory is about {{convert|11|km|mi|0}} long and {{convert|2.5|km|mi|0}} wide.

The dispute over ownership of Shebaa Farms resulted in part from the failure of the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate]] administrations, and later the Lebanese and Syrian governments, to demarcate the border between [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]]. Documents from the 1920s and 1930s indicate that inhabitants paid taxes to the Lebanese government. However, from the early 1950s until  [[Israel]]'s occupation of the Golan Heights in the [[Six-Day War]], Syria was the de facto ruling power.&lt;ref name="Kaufman-pij"/&gt; In 1978 [[1978 South Lebanon conflict|Israel invaded and occupied Southern Lebanon]], and in 1981, the Golan Heights, including the Shebaa Farms, were [[annexed]] by Israel, a move not recognized by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/5281178.stm Israeli views on Shebaa Farms harden, [[BBC]]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The territory has been a flashpoint for violence since [[South Lebanon conflict (1985–2000)|Israel withdrew from Lebanon in May 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/29/world/middleeast/29mideast.html?_r=0 Israel and Militants Trade Fire Across Lebanese Border [[New York Times]]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hezbollah]] claimed that the withdrawal was not complete because Shebaa was on Lebanese – not Syrian – territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3289532,00.html Shebaa Farms – nub of conflict]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Israeli withdrawal, the United Nations Secretary General issued a statement proposing the area for the operations of the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]]; in the statement the controversy was described, with 81 different maps being studied; the UN concluded that there is no evidence of the abandoned farmlands being Lebanese, but proposed to maintain the existing boundaries of the [[United Nations Disengagement Observer Force]] in Syria (which had included the Shebaa Farms since 1967) "without prejudice" to any future agreement between Syria and Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Har-Dov-withdrawal-not-on-the-table Har Dov withdrawal not on the table]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN-S-2000-460"/&gt; 

Low level conflict continued in the area, in particular [[2000–06 Shebaa Farms conflict|during 2000-06]] and [[January 2015 Shebaa farms incident|in early 2015]]. In August 2008, the  president of Lebanon, [[Michel Suleiman]] stated: "The countdown for liberating the rest of our lands has begun. And today I confirm the [use] of all available and legitimate means to achieve this goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metimes.com/International/2008/08/01/lebanon_to_release_statement_on_national_resistance_hezbollah_weapons/7538 |title=Lebanon to Release Statement on National Resistance, Hezbollah Weapons |author=Sana Abdallah |date=1 August 2008 |publisher=Middle East Times |accessdate=1 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006204714/http://www.metimes.com/International/2008/08/01/lebanon_to_release_statement_on_national_resistance_hezbollah_weapons/7538/ |archivedate=6 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Shebaa Farms is an area of about 9&amp;nbsp;km (5.5&amp;nbsp;mi) in length, and 2.5&amp;nbsp;km (1.5&amp;nbsp;mi) in width, coming to about 22&amp;nbsp;km² (8&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi; 5,400&amp;nbsp;acres). It is located about 3 to 12&amp;nbsp;km (2 to 7.5&amp;nbsp;mi) southwest of the Lebanese village of [[Shebaa, Lebanon|Shebaa]], and about 5 to 7&amp;nbsp;km (3 to 4&amp;nbsp;mi) northwest of the [[Druze]] village of [[Majdal Shams]]. Shebaa Farms is situated on the southeastern side of a long, broad [[ridge]] descending to the southwest from [[Mount Hermon]].  The northwestern edge of the area corresponds to the international Lebanese-Syrian border recognized by the [[United Nations]] along that ridge.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The southeastern edge follows Wadi al-Asal (Nahal Si'on), a 16&amp;nbsp;km long [[wadi]] that flows into Israel, draining a portion of the relatively precipitation-rich Hermon ridge in the northern Golan Heights.  These "edges" are connected by the Shebaa Farms' northeastern limit 2.5&amp;nbsp;km east of IDF military camp at Har Dov as defined by a 2007 UN report.&lt;ref name="UN641"&gt;[https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/2007/641], paragraph 58&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=March 2014}}

The same report defines the southwestern limit as a line roughly following the foot of the ridge and starting at just over a kilometer northwest of [[Banias]], then running northwest to the international Lebanon-Syrian border's sharp turning point 3.4&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Ghajar]] and 1.0&amp;nbsp;km "south of the (Lebanese) village of El Majidiye."  This southwestern limit of Shebaa Farms comes within about 1&amp;nbsp;km of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|1949 Armistice Line]], international border between Israeli and Syria. The only overland route between Lebanon and Syria south of the [[Mount Hermon]] ridge used to run between these two lines. The small farms in this area have not been used since the [[Six-Day War]]. The area includes heights overlooking parts of southern Lebanon and Israel to the west. Elevations range from about 250 to about 1,500&amp;nbsp;m (825–4,940&amp;nbsp;ft).

==Terminology==
&lt;!-- Surely the name "Shebaa Farms" comes from the name of the town Shebaa just over the border.  Add this with a reference. --&gt;

Lebanese press and officials often refer to the northern, higher part of the Shebaa Farms, just southeast of the Lebanese village of Kafr Shuba, as the Kafr Shuba Hills.{{Citation needed| date=October 2013}}  The wide mountainous ridge in that part is called Jabel Rus (the mountain of the heads) in Arabic.&lt;ref name=Dar&gt;{{cite book | title = Settlements and Cult Sites on Mount Hermon, Israel | author = Shimon Dar | publisher = TEMPVS REPARATVM | series = BAR International Series 589 | year = 1993 | page = 192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel refers to this northern, higher part as ''Har Dov'' (Mount Dov) after Dov Rodberg, an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] officer killed there in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erlich|first=Reuven|title=Raising the issue of the Sheba’a Farms in the proposed American-French Security Council draft resolution for ending the fighting: background information and significance|publisher=Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Center for Special Studies|date=9 August 2006|url=http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/pdf/sheba_farms_e.pdf|format=PDF|page=7|accessdate=29 September 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830154022/http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia/English/eng_n/pdf/sheba_farms_e.pdf|archivedate=30 August 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Documents from the 1920s and 1930s indicate that some local inhabitants regarded themselves as part of Lebanon, but after the French mandate ended in 1946 the land was administered by Syria, and represented as such on maps of the time,&lt;ref name="Kaufman-mej-page590"/&gt; including 1949 Armistice Agreement maps&lt;ref name="Kaufman-mej-page590"/&gt; and Syrian and Lebanese military maps.&lt;ref name="Kaufman-mej-page590"/&gt;  Shebaa Farms were then occupied by Israel in the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. According to [[BBC]], Syria agrees with Lebanon that Shebaa farms  is part of Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Kaufman-pij"/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc_763504/&gt; Syria accepts the Lebanese claim but refuses any binding demarcation.&lt;ref name=tds2986&gt;{{cite news|title=Khaddam reiterates charge that Damascus killed Hariri|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/Aug/29/Khaddam-reiterates-charge-that-Damascus-killed-Hariri.ashx#axzz2G6VK16GY|accessdate=26 December 2012|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=29 August 2006|location=Beirut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Israel captured the Golan Heights in 1967, Shebaa Farms was considered Syrian territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/about%20the%20ministry/mfa%20spokesman/2002/the%20legal%20status%20of%20the%20shabaa%20farms%20-%208-apr-2002|
title=The Legal Status of the Shabaa Farms| date=8 April 2002|publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=8 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lebanon]] was not an active participant in the war. In 1981 Israel extended [[Israeli law]] to the region under its [[Golan Heights Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golan Heights Law| url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace+Process/Guide+to+the+Peace+Process/Golan+Heights+Law.htm|publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs|date=14 December 1981|accessdate=16 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Security Council]] declared this extension of "[Israeli] laws, jurisdiction and administration... null and void and without international legal effect" in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 497|Resolution 497]], which was not passed with [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VII]] enforcement powers.

A controversy arose following the [[South Lebanon conflict (1982–2000)#2000: Israeli withdrawal|withdrawal of Israeli troops]] from [[Southern Lebanon]] on 24 May 2000. On 18 June 2000, the United Nations affirmed that Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon, in accordance with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 425|Resolution 425]].&lt;ref name="SC/6878"/&gt; Syria and Lebanon disputed the [[United Nations]] certification that Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon was complete. [[Hezbollah]] cites the occupation of Shebaa farms as one reason for its continued attacks on Israel.

Between 2000–2005, Hezbollah attacked the IDF at Shebaa/Har Dov 33 times, resulting in seven Israeli soldiers killed in action, three taken prisoner, and dozens wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:4AJZ6vrvBIQJ:www.terrorism-info.org.il/malam_multimedia//ENGLISH/IRAN/PDF/FEB14_05.PDF+nahal+sion&amp;hl=en&amp;sig=AHIEtbT7NcZfmwD4jNeQdWovXuxErsb6bw Hezbollah attacks at Har Dov]&lt;/ref&gt;

For decades the international diplomatic community has requested that Syria and Lebanon take steps to determine the exact boundary and officially register the demarcated border with the United Nations. However, President [[Bashar al-Assad]] of Syria has refused to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=82088|

===Territorial dispute===
{{main|French Mandate of Lebanon}}

The dispute over the sovereignty of Shebaa Farms resulted in part from the failure of the French [[League of Nations mandate|Mandate]] administrations, and subsequently the Lebanese and Syrian governments, to demarcate the border between Lebanon and Syria. Documents from the 1920s and 1930s indicate that local inhabitants paid taxes to the Lebanese government, while  French officials expressed confusion as to the actual location of the border.&lt;ref name="Kaufman-pij"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Understanding the Sheeba Farms dispute|url=http://www.pij.org/details.php?id=9|first=Asher|last=Kaufman| journal=Palestine-Israel Journal|volume=11|issue=1|year=2004|accessdate=22 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One French official in 1939 declared that the uncertainty was sure to cause trouble in the future.&lt;ref name="Kaufman-pij"/&gt;

The region continued to be represented in the 1930s and 1940s as Syrian territory, under the French Mandate.  Detailed maps showing the border were produced by the French in 1933, and again in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;"[[Beyrouth]]" 1:200,000 sheet NI36-XII available in the U.S. [[Library of Congress]] and French archives.&lt;/ref&gt; After the French Mandate ended in 1946, the land was administered by Syria and represented as such on maps of the time.&lt;ref name="Kaufman-mej-page590"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Who owns the Shebaa Farms?

The maps of the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Syria and Israel also designated the area as Syrian. However, border disputes erupted from time to time, also with respect to land ownership in other border villages. Syria and Lebanon formed a joint Syrian-Lebanese border committee in the late 1950s to demarcate a border between the two nations. In 1964,  the committee suggested  that the area be deemed the property of Lebanon and recommended that the international border be reestablished consistent with its suggestion. However, neither Syria nor Lebanon adopted the committee's suggestion, and neither country took any action along the suggested lines. Thus, maps of the area continued to reflect the area as being in Syria.&lt;ref name="Kaufman-mej-page590"/&gt; Even maps of both the Syrian and Lebanese armies continued to demarcate the region within Syrian territory.&lt;ref name="Kaufman-mej-page590"/&gt;

[[File:Shebaafarms.png|thumb|250px|right|A Lebanese military map, published in 1966, showing  Shebaa Farms on the Syrian side of the border]]

A number of local residents regarded themselves as Lebanese but the Lebanese government showed little interest in their views. The Syrian government administered the region, and on the eve of the 1967 war, the region was under effective Syrian control.

In 1967 most Shebaa Farms land owning farmers lived outside the Syrian-controlled region, across the Lebanon-Syrian border, in the Lebanese village of Shebaa.  After the Six-Day War, the landowners were no longer able to farm it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The key to Shebaa|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/717FD283-592E-44BA-8A22-9D46B441C304.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813193722/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/717FD283-592E-44BA-8A22-9D46B441C304.htm|archivedate=13 August 2006|date=25 April 2005|last=Nasser|first=Cilina|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|accessdate=23 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operation Litani===
In 1978 Israel invaded southern Lebanon in [[Operation Litani]]. The UN Security Council passed [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 425|Resolution 425]], calling on Israel "to withdraw forthwith its forces from all Lebanese territory". The phrase "all territory" was used in Resolution 425, in contrast to the language in [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|Resolution 242 (1967)]], which led to semantic disputes.

On 22 May 2000, Israel completed its withdrawal from southern Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 425.&lt;ref name="domino.un.org"&gt;{{cite web|date=19 March 1978|publisher=United Nations Security Council|title=Resolution 425 (1978) of March 19, 1978| url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/d744b47860e5c97e85256c40005d01d6/e25dae8e3ce54fb5852560e50079c708!OpenDocument| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006142108/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/d744b47860e5c97e85256c40005d01d6/e25dae8e3ce54fb5852560e50079c708!OpenDocument|archivedate=6 October 2006|accessdate=29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN certified the completion of Israel's pullout.&lt;ref name="SC/6878"&gt;{{cite web|date=18 June 2000|publisher=United Nations Security Council|title=Security council endorses secretary-general's conclusion on Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon as of June 16| url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2000/20000618.sc6878.doc.html|accessdate=29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lebanese claims==
In 2000, Lebanon disputed Israel's compliance with Resolution 425.  Lebanon claimed that the Shebaa Farms area was actually Lebanese and demanded that the Israelis should therefore withdraw from there as well. Lebanon asserted that the UN certification of the Israeli withdrawal was "invalid", because of Lebanon's claim to the farms.&lt;ref name=UNreport2&gt;{{cite journal|title=Report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of Security Council resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978)| url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.nsf/b86613e7d92097880525672e007227a7/736411af9bc6369585256903004f90c1!OpenDocument| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828225429/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.nsf/b86613e7d92097880525672e007227a7/736411af9bc6369585256903004f90c1!OpenDocument|archivedate=28 August 2006|date=16 June 2000|publisher=[[United Nations Security Council]]|author=[[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]]|version=S/2000/590|accessdate=28 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lebanese officials point to land [[deed]]s, stamped by the Lebanese government, that were held by a number of area residents in the 1940s and 1950s. The Lebanese claim to this area is asserted by Hezbollah for its hostilities with Israel and its cross-border attacks after the Israeli withdrawal. Senior Lebanese officials also linked the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Shebaa to Hezbollah’s disarmament. "If the U.S. and friendly countries help us achieve the withdrawal of Israel from Shebaa farms, this would make it possible for the Lebanese forces to be the sole owner of weapons and arms in the country", Lebanese Prime Minister Foaud Seniora said. Those comments were echoed by Lebanese President Émile Lahoud who said that "the resistance should be kept until a just and comprehensive peace is achieved in the region", adding that "if the Lebanese army were deployed along the borders (with Israel) ... it would be turned into a police force to protect Israel's borders, and this is not acceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shebaa farmers view Hezbollah as their savior |url=http://www.islamonline.com/cgi-bin/news_service/middle_east_full_story.asp?service_id=11286|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092426/http://www.islamonline.com/cgi-bin/news_service/middle_east_full_story.asp?service_id=11286|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 March 2016|date=27 May 2006|publisher=[[islamonline]]|accessdate=23 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walid Jumblatt]], a Lebanese [[Druze]] politician and leader of the [[Progressive Socialist Party]], stated that Lebanon has no claims to the Shebaa Farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waked|first=All|title=Lebanese leader: Mount Dov not ours|work=[[Ynetnews]]|date=15 March 2005|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3058858,00.html|accessdate=29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prime minister and president stated that Lebanon has a claim to the area.

Maps published on the [[Lebanese army]] website show different versions of the Lebanese southern border. The Shebaa Farms are not marked on the maps but it is evident from one map that the border runs north of the Shebaa Farms, while another map marks the border south of the farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/Arabic/popup.htm?/images/pics/geographic/1sur50000.jpg|publisher=[[Lebanese Armed Forces|Lebanese Army]]| title=Political map of Lebanon|accessdate=17 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lebarmy.gov.lb/Arabic/popup.htm?/images/pics/geographic/1sur100000.jpg|publisher=Lebanese Armed Forces| title=Carte du Liban|accessdate=17 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Arab newspaper, ''Al-Hayat'', "The issue over these farms was created to justify resistance operations from Lebanon after the UN had created the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|Blue Line]] following Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon. The Shebaa farms were placed inside Syrian territory. It should be noted that Syria, which claims that the farms are Lebanese, has not presented a single document to the UN to prove it. Moreover, Syria refuses to demarcate its borders with Lebanon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dergham|first=Raghida|title=Only Constructive Negotiations Can Bring about a Ceasefire|publisher=Dar Al Hayat|date=28 July 2006|url=http://english.daralhayat.com/opinion/OPED/07-2006/Article-20060728-b49960a1-c0a8-10ed-01ce-4de8b0ca56ad/story.html| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820231706/http://english.daralhayat.com/opinion/OPED/07-2006/Article-20060728-b49960a1-c0a8-10ed-01ce-4de8b0ca56ad/story.html|archivedate=20 August 2006|accessdate=29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syrian claims==
Syria has at times supported Lebanon's claim that the Shebaa Farms are part of Lebanon and not Syrian territory, at the UN and in official government press releases. But at other times it has made contrary statements. In August 1972, Syrian president [[Hafez al-Assad]] said, "Syria and Lebanon are a single country."&lt;ref name="rubinm781"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meforum.org/article/781|accessdate=11 August 2006|title=Lebanon's Tenuous Transformation|publisher=Middle East Form|last=Rubin|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Rubin (historian)}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May 2000, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouq al-Shara, indicated to UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] in a telephone conversation that Syria supported Lebanon's claim.&lt;ref name="UN-S-2000-460"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of Security Council resolutions 425 (1978) and 426 (1978)|url=http://domino.un.org/unispal.NSF/5ba47a5c6cef541b802563e000493b8c/97bad2289146f58a852568e9006d99bd|date=22 May 2000|publisher=[[United Nations Security Council]]|author=[[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Kofi Annan]]|version=S/2000/460|accessdate=8 August 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622044631/http://domino.un.org/unispal.NSF/5ba47a5c6cef541b802563e000493b8c/97bad2289146f58a852568e9006d99bd|archivedate=22 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was made public in the UN Press Release SC/6878 of 18 June 2000 which stated "Concerning the Shab'a farmlands, both Lebanon and Syria state that this land belongs to Lebanon."&lt;ref name="SC/6878"/&gt;

However, on 21 January 2006, the President of Syria [[Bashar al-Assad]] stated in a speech before the convention of the Arab Lawyers Union in [[Damascus]] and translated into English  by SANA, the official state news agency of Syria, that there are two legal requirements for demarcating the border: first, the complaint must be registered with the UN; and second, engineers must precisely define the border.  As neither Syria nor Lebanon have access to the area, Assad argues that resolution is waiting on Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=al-Assad|first=Bashar|authorlink=Bashar al-Assad|title=President Bashar Assad's speech before the annual convention of the Arab Lawyers Union, Damascus|publisher=[http://www.cggl.org/ Campaign for Good Governance in Lebanon]|date=21 January 2006|url=http://www.cggl.org/scripts/document.asp?id=46253|accessdate=29 September 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070130041147/http://www.cggl.org/scripts/document.asp?id=46253|archivedate=30 January 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Assad reported by SANA on 24 August 2006, Assad flatly refused demarcation of the Syrian/Lebanese border near Shebaa Farms before a withdrawal of Israeli troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=President Bashar al-Assad Gives an interview to Dubai Satellite TV.

Former Vice President of Syria [[Abdel-Halim Khaddam]], in an interview with the Lebanese [[Future Television]] on 27 August 2006, said: "Saying that the farms are occupied, and hence cannot be demarcated, is nothing but a pretext. The demarcation would not take more than an hour if there was a political will."&lt;ref name=tds2986/&gt;

==Israeli claims==
Israel claims that the area is not covered by UN Security Council Resolution 425, which governed Israel's withdrawal from  Lebanon, stating that the Farms were not Lebanese territory.  In support of that view, Israel points to the fact that the UN certified Israel's pullout from Lebanon as having been completed.&lt;ref name="SC/6878"/&gt;

Israel says the land was Syrian when it was captured during the [[Six-Day War]], and the dispute is being used by [[Hezbollah]] to continue its attacks on Israel.

==US position==
[[John R. Bolton|John Bolton]], former United States [[United States Ambassadors to the United Nations|Ambassador to the United Nations]], said on 26 April 2006: "I think the overwhelming preponderance of the evidence is that Shebaa Farms is Syrian territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|last=Bolton |first=John R |subjectlink=John R.

Former US president [[Jimmy Carter]] suggested in ''the [[Washington Post]]'' on 1 August 2006, that: "Israel should withdraw from all Lebanese territory, including Shebaa Farms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Carter, Jimmy|title=Stop the Band-Aid Treatment|publisher=The Washington Post|date=1 August 2006|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/31/AR2006073100923.html|accessdate=29 September 2006|authorlink=Jimmy Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, 2008, [[US Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] visited [[Beirut]], stating that "the United States believes that the time has come to deal with the Shebaa Farms issue ... in accordance with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701|[U.N.

==UN position==
[[File:BlueLine.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A map showing the [[Blue Line (Lebanon)|Blue Line]], a rough delineation of the Shabaa Farm area and the UNIFIL deployment area]]
The [[United Nations]] certified Israel's pullout under Resolution 425 as conforming to the "withdrawal line" it had laid down in accordance with the maps at its disposal&lt;ref name="SC/6878"/&gt; "for the practical purpose of confirming the Israeli withdrawal".&lt;ref name="UN-S-2000-460"/&gt; At the same time the UN noted that its decision was "without prejudice to future border agreements between the Member States concerned," referring to Israel, Syria, and Lebanon. The UN stated:
:"On May 15, 2000, the United Nations received a map, dated 1966, from the Government of Lebanon which reflected the Government's position that these farmlands were located in Lebanon. However, the United Nations is in possession of 10 other maps issued after 1966 by various Lebanese government institutions, including the Ministry of Defense and the army, all of which place the farmlands inside the Syrian Arab Republic. The United Nations has also examined six maps issued by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic, including three maps since 1966, which place the farmlands inside the Syrian Arab Republic."&lt;ref name="UN-S-2000-460"/&gt;

In an 18 June 2000 statement, the [[Security Council]] noted that Israel and Lebanon had confirmed to the Secretary General, that identification of the withdrawal line was solely the responsibility of the UN and that both sides would respect the line as identified. On a fact-finding visit to the region, [[Terje Rød-Larsen]], the UN special envoy to the Middle East, noted that both 1923 Anglo-French maps and the 1949 Armistice agreement place the area in Syria.&lt;ref name="meib-vol3nr5hezb"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Gambill|first=Gary C|title=Syria and the Shebaa Farms Dispute|journal=[[Middle East Forum|Middle East Intelligence Bulletin]]|date=May 2001|volume=3|issue=5|url=http://www.meib.org/articles/0105_l1.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710205159/http://www.meib.org/articles/0105_l1.htm|archivedate=10 July 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2002, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, said:
:"With reference to the disturbances along the Blue Line emanating from Lebanese territory, I call on the Government of Lebanon and all relevant parties to condemn and prevent such violations. The Security Council itself confirmed in June 2000 that Israel had withdrawn from southern Lebanon in compliance with UN Security Council resolutions 425 and 426. Attacks at any point along the Blue Line, including in the Shebaa Farms area in the occupied Golan Heights, are violations of Security Council resolutions. Respect for decisions of the Security Council is the most basic requirement of international legitimacy."

On 20 January 2005, UN Secretary-General's report on Lebanon stated:
:"The continually asserted position of the Government of Lebanon that the Blue Line is not valid in the Shab'a farms area is not compatible with Security Council resolutions. The Council has recognized the Blue Line as valid for purposes of confirming Israel’s withdrawal pursuant to resolution 425 (1978). The Government of Lebanon should heed the Council’s repeated calls for the parties to respect the Blue Line in its entirety."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=28 January 2005|publisher=United Nations Security Council|title=Security Council condemns violence along blue line between Israel and Lebanon, extends mandate of UNIFIL until July 31| url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/sc8299.doc.htm|accessdate=29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC]] quoted Timur Goksel, then spokesman for the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon]] ([[UNIFIL]]) as saying that "no-one disputed that the village of Shebaa itself was in Lebanon, but most of the farms fell into an undefined area that may be either in Lebanon or Syria" and although the UN was not a "boundary marking authority [...] on all maps the UN has been able to find, the farms are seen on the Syrian side [of the border]."&lt;ref name=bbc_763504&gt;{{cite news|title=In focus: Shebaa farms| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/763504.stm|work=BBC|date=25 May 2000|accessdate=29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Terje Rød-Larsen]], the UN special envoy on implementation of Resolution 1559, declared that "the Shaba Farms area is not part of Lebanon. Therefore, any Lebanese 'resistance' to 'liberate' the area from continued Israeli occupation cannot be considered legitimate." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Har-Dov-withdrawal-not-on-the-table Har Dov Withdrawal Not on the Table, [[Jerusalem Post]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Israeli war against Hezbollah in 2006, U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701 called for the "Delineation of the international borders of Lebanon, especially in those areas where the border is disputed or uncertain, including in the Shebaa farms area."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishpolicycenter.org/831/syria-and-the-shebaa-farms-dispute&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arab League==
The [[Arab League]] backed Lebanon's claim with a communique issued at Arab League's 13th session in 2001, asking for "complete Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Palestinian territory, including Jerusalem, from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights to the line of 4 June 1967 and from the remaining occupied Lebanese territory up to the internationally recognized borders, including the Shab`a farmlands".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=10 April 2001|publisher=United Nations Security Council|title=Letter dated April 6, 2001 from the Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United Nations addressed to the Secretary-General| url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/docs/55/a55892.pdf |accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research findings==
In 2002, Asher Kaufman of the Harry S. Truman Research Institute at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], discovered previously unknown documents in French government [[archives]].  In one, French litigants in a private dispute entered into a private commercial agreement that suggested that the border should put the Farms in Lebanon.  Two other documents, from 1937 and 1939, were reports from the administrative councilor of south Lebanon and the head of the Services Spéciaux in the Syrian town of [[Quneitra]].  They noted a discrepancy between the border, as determined by the 1:200,000 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] map, and their view of the "reality" in the region.  Collecting "unofficial information" from "various sources," they concluded that in their view the area was Lebanese.  Their conclusion was based on the facts that:  a) some area residents paid taxes to Lebanon; and b) three or four sheep pens in the Farms belonged to residents of the Lebanese village of Shaba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Pearlman | first=Jonathan | title=Long-forgotten papers may offer a new road map for peace | publisher=[[The Age]] | date=3 August 2006 | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/longforgotten-papers-may-offer-a-new-road-map-for-peace/2006/08/02/1154198206054.html | accessdate=29 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book published in 1988, Moshe Braver, an Israeli geographer, mentions two French maps published in 1932 and 1946, the former shows the farm area as being part of Lebanon while the latter shows the area as a Syrian territory.&lt;ref&gt;Braver, Moshe (1988).

The maps mentioned are: (1) Carte du Liban (1932), Bureau Topographique des Troupes Françaises de Levant, Beyrouth; (2) Carte du Levant (1946), Service Géographique de FFL, Institut Géographique National, Paris&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''spatial reference system''' ('''SRS''') or '''coordinate reference system''' ('''CRS''') is a [[Coordinate system|coordinate-based]] local, regional or global system used to locate geographical entities.  A spatial reference system defines a specific [[map projection]], as well as transformations between different spatial reference systems. Spatial reference systems are defined by the [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]]'s [[Simple feature access]] using [[well-known text]], and support has been implemented by several [[Technical standard|standards-based]] [[geographic information system]]s. Spatial reference systems can be referred to using a [[SRID]] [[integer]], including EPSG codes defined by the [[International Association of Oil and Gas Producers]].
It is specified in ISO 19111:2007 Geographic information—Spatial referencing by coordinates, prepared by [[ISO/TC 211]], also published as [[Open Geospatial Consortium|OGC]] Abstract Specification, Topic 2: Spatial referencing by coordinate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/as]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Some systems are:

*[[Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system]]
*[[British national grid reference system]]
*[[Hellenic Geodetic Reference System 1987]]
*[[Irish grid reference system]]
*[[Irish Transverse Mercator]]
*[[Israeli Transverse Mercator]]
*[[Israeli Cassini Soldner]]
*[[Jordan Transverse Mercator]]
*[[Lambert conformal conic projection]]
*[[MapCode|International mapcode system]]
*[[Military Grid Reference System]]
*[[United States National Grid]]

==Identifiers{{anchor|Identifier}}==
A '''Spatial Reference System Identifier''' ('''SRID''') is a unique value used to unambiguously identify projected, unprojected, and local spatial coordinate system definitions. These coordinate systems form the heart of all [[Geographic information system|GIS]] applications.

Virtually all major spatial vendors have created their own SRID implementation or refer to those of an authority, such as the [[EPSG|European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG)]]. (NOTE: As of 2005 the EPSG SRID values are now maintained by the International Association of [http://www.epsg.org/ Oil &amp; Gas Producers (OGP) Surveying &amp; Positioning Committee]).

SRIDs are the primary key for the [[Open Geospatial Consortium|Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)]] '''spatial_ref_sys''' metadata table for the [[Simple Features|Simple Features for SQL Specification, Versions 1.1 and 1.2]],  which is defined as follows:
&lt;source lang=sql&gt;
CREATE TABLE SPATIAL_REF_SYS
(
    SRID      INTEGER   NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    AUTH_NAME CHARACTER VARYING(256),
    AUTH_SRID INTEGER,
    SRTEXT    CHARACTER VARYING(2048)
)
&lt;/source&gt;
In spatially enabled databases (such as [[IBM DB2]], [[IBM Informix]], [[Ingres (database)|Ingres]], [[Microsoft SQL Server]], [[MySQL]], [[Oracle RDBMS]], [[Teradata]], [[PostGIS]] and [[SQL Anywhere]]), SRIDs are used to uniquely identify the coordinate systems used to define columns of spatial data or individual spatial objects in a spatial column (depending on the spatial implementation).  SRIDs are typically associated with a well known text (WKT) string definition of the coordinate system (SRTEXT, above).  From the [[Well-known text#Spatial reference systems|Well Known Text]] Wikipedia page, “A WKT string for a spatial reference system describes the [[Datum (geodesy)|datum]], [[geoid]], [[coordinate system]], and [[map projection]] of the spatial objects”.
Here are two common coordinate systems with their EPSG SRID value followed by their well known text:

UTM, Zone 17N, NAD27 — SRID 2029:
&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;

    PARAMETER["false_northing",0],
    AUTHORITY["EPSG","2029"],
    AXIS["Easting",EAST],
    AXIS["Northing",NORTH]]
&lt;/source&gt;

[[WGS84]] — SRID 4326  
&lt;source lang=javascript&gt;
GEOGCS["WGS 84",
    DATUM["WGS_1984",
        SPHEROID["WGS 84",6378137,298.257223563,
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","7030"]],
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","6326"]],
    PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],
    UNIT["degree",0.01745329251994328,
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","9122"]],
    AUTHORITY["EPSG","4326"]]
&lt;/source&gt;

SRID values associated with spatial data can be used to constrain spatial operations — for instance, spatial operations cannot be performed between spatial objects with differing SRIDs in some systems, or trigger coordinate system transformations between spatial objects in others.

'''Spent mushroom compost''' is the residual [[compost]] waste generated by the [[mushroom production]] industry. It is readily available (bagged, at nursery suppliers), and its formulation generally consists of a combination of [[wheat]] straw, dried blood, [[horse manure]] and ground chalk, composted together. It is an excellent source of [[humus]], although much of its [[nitrogen]] content will have been used up by the composting and growing mushrooms. It remains, however, a good source of general nutrients (0.7% [[Nitrogen|N]], 0.3% [[Phosphorus|P]], 0.3% [[Potassium|K]] plus a full range of [[trace element]]s), as well as a useful [[soil conditioner]]. However, due to its [[chalk]] content, it may be [[alkaline]], and should not be used on acid-loving plants, nor should it be applied too frequently, as it will overly raise the soil's [[Soil pH|pH]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vegetable Gardening: Growing and Harvesting Vegetables
|first=Steve|last= Bradley|publisher=Murdoch Books|year=2004|isbn=1-74045-519-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mushroom compost may also contain [[pesticide]] residues, particularly [[organochloride]]s used against the [[fungus gnat]]. If the compost pile was stored outside, it may contain grubs or other insects attracted to decaying matter. Chemicals may also have been used to treat the straw, and also to sterilize the compost. Therefore, the [[Organic gardening|organic gardener]] must be careful regarding the sourcing of mushroom compost; if in doubt, samples can be analyzed for contamination &amp;ndash; in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] is able to advise regarding this issue.

Commercially available 'spent' mushroom compost is not always truly spent. It is sold by mushroom farms when it is no longer producing commercially viable yields of mushrooms. It can be used to grow further smaller crops of mushrooms before final use on the garden.

'''Tetas de Maria Guevara''' are twin hills located near [[Laguna de la Restinga]] in central [[Isla Margarita]], [[Venezuela]].

These hills are used as a landmark by local fishermen. They were declared a Natural Monument in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Tetas_De_Maria_Guevara_Natural_Monument Tetas De Maria Guevara Natural Monument]&lt;/ref&gt; The western hill, the higher, is only 75 m high, but they stand out in the surrounding flat arid plain and are easily seen from the ferry. One of the local legends say that these [[breast-shaped hill]]s were named and given to a [[mestiza]] woman from [[Cumaná]] called Maria Guevara who fought in the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]] and breast fed soldiers. She had two sons of whom she breast fed as adults which is thought to be the reason of why they were such great warriors, hence the hills were named after her breasts. The estate was lost after her death and the Guevara family were never able to claim it their own , as the deeds of the island, documenting Marias possession of it were hidden in a papaya fruit. However, her tomb lies beneath the hills of the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turismoporvenezuela.com/?go=estados&amp;do=leer&amp;id=65 Turismo por Venezuela - Las Tetas de María Guevara]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trophic State Index (TSI)''' is a classification system designed to rate bodies of water based on the amount of biological activity they sustain.&lt;ref name="USFWaterAtlas"&gt;{{cite web |last1=University of Southern Florida Water Institute |title=Trophic State Index (TSI) |url=http://www.lake.wateratlas.usf.edu/shared/learnmore.asp?toolsection=lm_tsi |website=Learn More About Trophic State Index (TSI) - Lake.WaterAtlas.org |publisher=University of Southern Florida |accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the term "trophic index" is commonly applied to lakes, any surface body of water may be indexed.

The TSI of a body of water is rated on a scale from zero to one hundred.&lt;ref name="USFWaterAtlas" /&gt; Under the TSI scale, bodies of water may be defined as:&lt;ref name="USFWaterAtlas" /&gt; 

* '''oligotrophic''' (TSI 0–40, having the least amount of biological productivity, "good" water quality);
* '''mesoeutrophic''' (TSI 40–60, having a moderate level of biological activity, "fair" water quality); or
* '''eutrophic''' to '''hypereutrophic''' (TSI 60–100, having the highest amount of biological activity, "poor" water quality).

The quantities of [[nitrogen]], [[phosphorus]], and other biologically useful nutrients are the primary determinants of a body of water's TSI. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus tend to be [[limiting resource]]s in standing water bodies, so increased concentrations tend to result in increased plant growth, followed by corollary increases in subsequent [[trophic level]]s.{{efn|Note that this use of trophic levels refers to feeding dynamics, and has a much different meaning than a body of water's ''trophic index''.}} Consequently, a body of water's trophic index may sometimes be used to make a rough estimate of its biological condition.&lt;ref name="USEPA"&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency (2007) Carlson's Trophic State Index. ''Aquatic Biodiversity''. http://www.epa.gov/bioindicators/aquatic/carlson.html ''accessed 17 February 2008''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carlson's Trophic State Index==
Carlson's index was proposed by Robert Carlson in his 1977 seminal paper, "A trophic state index for lakes".&lt;ref name="Carlson1977" /&gt; It is one of the more commonly used trophic indices and is the trophic index used by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt; The ''trophic state'' is defined as the total weight of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in a given water body at the time of measurement. Because they are of public concern, the Carlson index uses the algal biomass as
an objective classifier of a lake or other water body's trophic status.&lt;ref name="Carlson1977"&gt;Carlson,  R.E. (1977) A trophic state index for lakes. ''Limnology and Oceanography''. 22:2 361–369.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the US EPA, the Carlson Index should only be used with lakes that have relatively few rooted plants and non-algal turbidity sources.&lt;ref name="USEPA" /&gt;

===Index variable===
Because they tend to correlate, three independent variables can be used to calculate the Carlson Index: ''[[chlorophyll|chlorophyll pigments]]'', ''total phosphorus'' and ''[[Secchi depth]]''. Of these three, chlorophyll will probably yield the most accurate measures, as it is the most accurate predictor of biomass. Phosphorus may be a more accurate estimation of a water body's summer trophic status than
chlorophyll if the measurements are made during the winter. Finally, the Secchi depth is probably the least accurate measure, but also the most affordable and expedient one. Consequently, citizen monitoring programs and other volunteer or large-scale surveys will often use the Secchi depth. By translating the Secchi transparency values to a log base 2 scale, each successive doubling of biomass is represented as a whole integer index number.&lt;ref name="Carlson1996"&gt;Carlson R.E. and J. Simpson (1996) A Coordinator's Guide to Volunteer Lake Monitoring Methods. ''North American Lake Management Society''. 96 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The Secchi depth, which measures water transparency, indicates the concentration of dissolved and particulate material in the water, which in turn can be used to derive the biomass. This relationship is expressed in the following equation:

: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac 1 z \right)\left(\ln \frac{I_0}{I_z}\right) = k_w + \alpha C&lt;/math&gt;
:where ''z'' = the depth at which the disk disappears,
:''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the intensity of light striking the water's surface,
:''I''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; is about 10% of ''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and is considered a constant,
:''k''&lt;sub&gt;''w''&lt;/sub&gt; is a coefficient for the attenuation of light by water and dissolved substances,
:''&amp;alpha;'' is treated as a constant with the units of square meters per milligram and
:''C'' is the concentration of particulate matter in units for milligrams per cubic meter.&lt;ref name="Carlson1977" /&gt;

==Trophic classifications==
A lake is usually classified as being in one of three possible classes: ''oligotrophic'', ''mesotrophic'' or ''eutrophic''. Lakes with extreme trophic indices may also be considered ''hyperoligotrophic'' or ''hypereutrophic''. The table below demonstrates how the index values translate into trophic classes.

Oligotrophic lakes generally host very little or no [[aquatic plant|aquatic vegetation]] and are relatively clear, while eutrophic lakes tend to host large quantities of organisms, including algal blooms. Each trophic class supports different types of fish and other organisms, as well. If the algal biomass in a lake or other water body reaches too high a concentration (say &gt;80 TSI), massive [[fish die-off]]s may occur as decomposing biomass deoxygenates the water.

===Oligotrophic===
[[File:20161001 Kurtkowiec i Czerwone Stawy Gąsienicowe 1730.jpg|thumb|[[Kurtkowiec Lake]], an oligotrophic lake in the [[Tatra Mountains]] of southern [[Poland]]]]

An oligotrophic lake is a lake with low [[primary productivity]], as a result of low [[nutrient]] content. These lakes have low [[algal]] production, and consequently, often have very clear waters, with high [[drinking water|drinking-water]] quality. The bottom waters of such lakes typically have ample [[oxygen]]; thus, such lakes often support many [[fish]] species such as [[lake trout]], which require cold, well-[[Oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenated]] waters. The oxygen content is likely to be higher in deep lakes, owing to their larger [[hypolimnion|hypolimnetic]] volume.

Ecologists use the term [[oligotroph]]ic to distinguish unproductive lakes, characterised by nutrient deficiency, from productive, eutrophic lakes, with an ample or excessive nutrient supply. Oligotrophic lakes are most common in cold regions underlain by resistant [[igneous]] rocks (especially [[granitic]] bedrock).

===Mesotrophic===
Mesotrophic lakes are lakes with an intermediate level of productivity. These lakes are commonly clear water lakes and ponds with beds of submerged aquatic plants and medium levels of nutrients.

The term mesotrophic is also applied to terrestrial habitats. Mesotrophic soils have moderate nutrient levels.

===Eutrophic===
{{Main|Eutrophication}}
[[Image:River algae Sichuan.jpg|thumb|upright|Algal bloom in a village river in the mountains near [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]], China]]

A eutrophic body of water, commonly a lake or pond, has high biological productivity. Due to excessive nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus, these water bodies are able to support an abundance of aquatic plants. Usually, the water body will be dominated either by aquatic plants or algae. When aquatic plants dominate, the water tends to be clear. When algae dominate, the water tends to be darker. The algae engage in photosynthesis which supplies oxygen to the fish and biota which inhabit these waters. Occasionally, an excessive algal bloom will occur and can ultimately result in fish death, due to respiration by algae and bottom-living bacteria. The process of [[eutrophication]] can occur naturally and by [[human impact on the environment]].

Eutrophic comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''eutrophos'' meaning "well-nourished", from ''eu'' meaning good and ''trephein'' meaning "to nourish"&lt;ref&gt;Definition of [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/eutrophic eutrophic] at [[dictionary.com]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypereutrophic===
Hypereutrophic lakes are very nutrient-rich lakes characterized by frequent and severe nuisance [[algal blooms]] and low transparency. Hypereutrophic lakes have a visibility depth of less than 3 feet, they have greater than 40 micrograms/litre total [[chlorophyll]] and greater than 100 micrograms/litre [[phosphorus]].

The excessive algal blooms can also significantly reduce oxygen levels and prevent life from functioning at lower depths creating dead zones beneath the surface.

Likewise, large algal blooms can cause [[biodilution]] to occur, which is a decrease in the concentration of a pollutant with an increase in [[trophic level]]. This is opposed to [[biomagnification]] and is due to a decreased concentration from increased algal uptake.

==Trophic index drivers==
Both natural and [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] factors can influence a lake or other water body's trophic index. A water body situated in a nutrient-rich region with high [[net primary productivity]] may be naturally eutrophic. Nutrients carried into water bodies from [[non-point sources]] such as agricultural runoff, residential fertilisers, and sewage will all increase the algal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], and can easily cause an oligotrophic lake to become hypereutrophic.

==Management targets==
Often, the desired trophic index differs between stakeholders. Water-fowl enthusiasts (e.g. duck hunters) may want a lake to be eutrophic so that it will support a large population of waterfowl. Residents, though, may want the same lake to be oligotrophic, as this is more pleasant for swimming and boating. Natural resource agencies are generally responsible for reconciling these conflicting uses and determining what a water body's trophic index should be.
