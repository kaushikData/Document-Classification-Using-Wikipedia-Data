The '''1981 Handsworth riots''' were three days of [[riot]]ing that took place in the [[Handsworth, West Midlands|Handsworth]] area of [[Birmingham]], England in July 1981.&lt;ref name="Waddington"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waddington|first=David P.|title=Contemporary issues in public disorder: a comparative and historical approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=61XZdjCj9PMC&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=24 September 2011|year=1992|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-07913-6|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major outbreak of violence took place on the night of Friday 10/11 July, with smaller disturbances on the following two nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Southgate|first=Peter|editor=Field, Simon |editor2=Southgate, Peter|title=Public disorder: a review of research and a study in one inner city area|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ls_wAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=25 August 2011|series=Home Office Research Studies|year=1982|publisher=H.M.S.O.|location=London|isbn=0-11-340767-X|page=42|chapter= "Abstract: Disturbances of July 1981 in Handsworth, Birmingham - A Survey of the Views and Experiences of Male Residents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The riots were characterised by the [[Scarman report]] into the [[1981 England riots|1981 riots in England]] as "copycat riots" – taking place after the [[1981 Brixton riot|Brixton riots]] in London, and around the same time as the [[1981 Toxteth riots|Toxteth riots]] in [[Liverpool]] and the [[1981 Moss Side riot|Moss Side riots]] in [[Manchester]] – though some have argued that this is an oversimplification.&lt;ref name="Waddington" /&gt; The immediate flashpoint was an attack on a locally well-known [[Superintendent (police)|Police Superintendent]] who was trying to calm rumours of an impending march by the right-wing [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]].&lt;ref name="Waddington" /&gt; The following disturbances resulted in 121 arrests and 40 injuries to police officers, alongside widespread damage to property.&lt;ref name="ncjrs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=84135|title=Abstract: Disturbances of July 1981 in Handsworth, Birmingham - A Survey of the Views and Experiences of Male Residents (From Public Disorder, P 41-73, 1982, by Simon Field and Peter Southgate)|accessdate=24 September 2011|work=National Criminal Justice Reference Service|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the riots Handsworth had been considered to be a good example of successful [[community policing]], though local [[Black British]] youths later disputed the claim that relations between them and the police had been amicable: around 40% of them had been [[Stop and search|stopped and searched]] over the previous 12 months.&lt;ref name="Waddington" /&gt; Handsworth had a mixed population of [[White British|white]], [[Black British|black]] and [[British Asian|Asian]] residents, but surveys after the riots showed little evidence of significant [[Racism|racial tension]].&lt;ref name="ncjrs" /&gt; A week before the riots, during the weekend that saw [[CS gas]] used against rioters for the first time on the British Mainland in [[Toxteth]], [[Liverpool]], a reporter from ''[[The Times]]'' had visited a festival in [[Handsworth Park]] and found "8,000 people, black and white" in "a spirit as amiable and peaceful as a rural village fete".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Arthur|last=Osman|author2=Timmins, Nicholas|author3= Tendler, Stewart. |title=3am: Residents begin Toxteth evacuation Police use CS gas after admitting riot is out of control|work=The Times|publisher=Times Newspapers|page=1|date=6 July 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common reasons for the riots reported by participants were unemployment, boredom and the imitation of events elsewhere.&lt;ref name="ncjrs" /&gt;

'''The Aboriginal Protection Act''', enacted in 1869 by the [[colony]] of [[Victoria, Australia]] gave extensive powers over the lives of [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal people]] to the government's [[Aboriginal Protection Board|Board for the Protection of Aborigines]], including regulation of residence, employment and marriage.&lt;ref name=dd&gt;{{cite web

==History==
Victoria enacted the Aboriginal Protection Act   while democratic reforms were being introduced for the  population, such as the extension of the [[suffrage|franchise]] from the wealthy to all adult males and the provision of free [[public education]].  In contrast, Aboriginal people were losing their freedom. In 1871 the Board developed controls over where people could live and work, what they could do and who they could meet or marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In 1886, Victoria's parliament passed what became known as the [[Half-Caste Act]] and started to remove Aboriginal people of mixed descent, known as "[[half-caste]]s", from the Aboriginal stations or reserves to force them to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] into white society.  These expulsions separated families and communities, causing distress and leading to protest.  Nevertheless, the Board refused to assist the expelled people. It was assumed that the expulsions would lead to the decline in the population of the reserves and their eventual closure.  The failure of this policy and its inhumanity led to Victoria's ''Aborigines Act'' of 1910 and ''Aboriginal Lands Act'' of 1970, which abandoned this policy.&lt;ref name=dd/&gt;

Benda is best known as the author of the ''Geschichte der Stadt Gablonz und ihrer Umgebung'' (''History of the Town of Jablonec nad Nisou''), which was published in 1876-77.

==Biography==
Benda was born on 27 November 1845 as a German-speaking Bohemian in the town of [[Jablonec nad Nisou]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).&lt;ref name="kk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://krkonose.krnap.cz/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9485&amp;Itemid=27|title=Časopis Krkonoše - Jizerské hory|publisher=''Krkonoše - Jizerské hory''|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Machačová|first1=Jana|last2=Matějček|first2=Jiří|title=Studie k sociálním dějinám 19. století|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFfFAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=19 February 2012|year=2004|publisher=Slezský ústav ČSAV v Opavě|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most sources indicate he was born in 1845 and died in 1878 but several sources say he was born in 1841 and died in 1876.&lt;ref name="Rohr1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rohr|first=Robert|title=Unser klingendes Erbe: Beiträge zur Musikgeschichte der Deutschen und ihrer Nachbarn in und aus Südosteuropa unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der Donauschwaben : von den Anfängen bis 1918|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VogXAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=19 February 2012|year=1988|publisher=Verlag Passavia|isbn=978-3-87616-134-1|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="věd)vědy1982"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ústav hudební vědy (Československá akademie věd)|author2=Ústav teorie a dějin umění (Československá akademie věd).

In 1866, he was sent with the Imperial Army to participate in the [[Austro-Prussian War]].&lt;ref name="kk"/&gt; After returning, he began extensive research in local historical studies.&lt;ref name="Pazaurek1923"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pazaurek|first=Gustav Edmund|title=Gläser der Empire-und Biedermeierzeit. o.O. 1923. 412 S.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Y0wAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 February 2012|year=1923|publisher=Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Benda became a prominent figure in public and social life in Jablonec, a member of several associations and served on the council.&lt;ref name="kk"/&gt; He was particularly involved in the Industrial and Educational Support Association (''Industrieller Bildungs und Unterstützungsverein'') and saw the importance of education in promoting economic development.&lt;ref name="kk"/&gt;  From 1872, he was responsible for the federal library and in 1875 he became president of the Pindter Heinrich Association, until his death.&lt;ref name="kk"/&gt;  Well connected politically, Benda was a noted [[Social liberalism|liberal]] activist in the region and also served on the board of directors of the Duchcov-Podmokly Railway along with [[Herbert Gutman]], Dr. [[Moriz Aron]], and [[Richard Lederer (Bohemian)|Richard Lederer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Machačová|first1=Jana|last2=Matějček|first2=Jiří|title=Studie k sociálním dějinám 19. století|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bFfFAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=19 February 2012|year=2004|publisher=Slezský ústav ČSAV v Opavě|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Jews of Czechoslovakia: historical studies and surveys"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Jews of Czechoslovakia: historical studies and surveys|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X61tAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=19 February 2012|year=1968|publisher=Jewish Publication Society of America|page=428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arab Liberation Front''' ({{lang-ar|جبهة التحرير العربية}} ''Jabhet Al-Tahrir Al-'Arabiyah'') is a minor [[Palestinian territories|Palestinian]] political party, previously controlled by the [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Iraqi-led Ba'ath Party]], formed in 1969 by [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] and then headed by [[Saddam Hussein]]. ALF is a member of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO).

==History and background==
The ALF was founded in April 1969, as a front of the [[Ba'ath Party (Iraqi-dominated faction)|Iraqi-led faction]] of the [[Ba'ath Party]], then led by [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]]. The ALF has always followed Iraqi government policy on all matters. In line with the [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab ideology]] of the Ba'ath Party, the ALF was initially opposed to "Palestinization" of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]], preferring to argue in terms of the wider [[Arab world]]'s war with Israel, which it regarded as under the natural leadership of Iraq.

The ALF was the main group active in Iraq's small Palestinian population of approximately 34,000, but a very minor group in all other Palestinian communities. It has maintained a small following in the [[Palestinian refugee camps|refugee camps]] of [[Lebanon]], and has a minuscule presence in the Palestinian territories. Samir Sanunu is the representative of ALF in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alwatanvoice.com/arabic/lastnews.php?go=show&amp;id=78828|title=مسيرة جماهيرية حاشدة في مخيم عين الحلوه لمناسبة الذكرى السنوية الثالثه لاستشهاد القائد القومي والوطني ابو العباس - دنيا الوطن|publisher=|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first leader of ALF was its secretary-general, Zeid Heidar. Heidar was born in Syria in the 1930s into a family of [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalists]]. In 1956 he joined the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Ba'ath Party]] in [[Syria]]. In 1968 he went to [[Iraq]] after the [[17 July Revolution|coup]] and was a part of the Ba'ath Party in Iraq. In 1969, he was appointed by the government of Iraq secretary-general of the Ba'ath Party in Palestine, the ALF. In June 1969 the ALF became a member of the newly formed PLO, a device for Iraq to be able to influence the PLO and the events in Palestine. In 1974, the ALF joined the [[Rejectionist Front]], initially strongly backed by Iraq, which was formed by hard-line Palestinian factions which rejected what they perceived as the increasing moderation of the PLO.

After the PLO entered into the [[Oslo Accords]] with Israel, the ALF opposed the accords, in line with Iraqi government policy. This brought about a split in the ALF in 1993, with a pro-Arafat Oslo faction becoming the [[Palestinian Arab Front]] and re-locating to the [[Palestinian territories]];&lt;ref name=Guidere&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=p5FWkN6B09YC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=Zeid+Heidar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Utxf5zbMhe&amp;sig=HNfI7Ui7_7UoK5wLyNA7bz1xPY8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g00SVJ3NKYnjuQTy0IHQAw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Zeid%20Heidar&amp;f=false Historical Dictionary of Islamic Fundamentalism]. By Mathieu Guidère. p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; while the remainder of the ALF remaining in the Rejectionist Front.

Other leaders of ALF have included [[Munif al-Razzaz]], Abd al-Wahhab al-Kayyali and Abd al-Rahim Ahmad. al-Kayyali became secretary-general in at least 1972-74, and served on the PLO Executive Council from January 1973. He was assassinated in Beirut in 1981 by unidentified gunmen.&lt;ref&gt;Arab Gateway: [http://www.al-bab.com/arab/countries/palestine/biogCM.htm PALESTINE WHO'S WHO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715105102/http://al-bab.com/arab/countries/palestine/biogCM.htm |date=2012-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad was the secretary-general from 1975 (possibly 1974) until his death in 1991, and was a member of PLO Executive Council from 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Arab Gateway: [http://www.al-bab.com/arab/countries/palestine/biogAB.htm PALESTINE WHO'S WHO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925084554/http://www.al-bab.com/arab/countries/palestine/biogAB.htm |date=September 25, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The present secretary-general is [[Rakad Salem]] (Abu Mahmoud) who was held in Israeli jail between 2001 and 2006.&lt;ref name=safa&gt;{{cite web|url=http://safaimages.photoshelter.com/image/I0000GJ4qMZW0Ofo|title=Rakad Salem, one of 57 Palestinian released by Israel from its prisons, welcomed by his supporters - safaimages|website=safaimages.photoshelter.com|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ALF gained some significance during the [[Second Intifada|al-Aqsa Intifada]], which started in 2000, as a distributor of financial contributions from the Iraqi government to families of "[[martyr]]s" with extra grants for the families of suicide bombers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intelligence.org.il/eng/eng_n/saddam.htm How Saddam Hussein’s régime transferred funds from Iraq to the West Bank and Gaza Strip to encourage Palestinian terrorism] Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Center for Special Studies (C.S.S) August, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/03/25/1017004765039.html Iraq pays suicide bonus to entice new bombers] Paul McGeough, ''The Age'', March 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 American invasion of Iraq]], the fall of the Saddam Hussein's [[Ba'athist Iraq|Ba'athist government]], and dissolution of the Ba'ath Party, large numbers of the Palestinian refugees who had been living in Iraq were forced to flee Iraq, and many ALF members fled the country for security reasons for Lebanon and the West Bank.&lt;ref name=Guidere/&gt;&lt;ref name=electronicintifada&gt;electronicintifada: [http://electronicintifada.net/content/palestinian-refugees-iraq/6801 Palestinian Refugees of Iraq]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present situation==
Today, the secretary-general of ALF continues to be Rakad Salem, who holds Iraqi citizenship. He was imprisoned by Israel in 2001 for distributing Iraqi funds to families of suicide bombers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/rakad-salem-general-secretary-of-the-arab-liberation-front-news-photo/1464824|title=FILE PHOTO  General Sect.

What the status and position of the ALF is since the 2003 end of Iraqi support is uncertain.

The headquarters of ALF are in [[Ramallah]], [[West Bank]]. The ALF published a monthly newspaper, ''[[Sawt al-Jamahir]]'' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''Voice of the Masses''), which was edited by Rakad Salem. The newspaper was financed by the Iraqi government until 2003, and it is uncertain whether the paper has continued to be published since then.

ALF has not been involved in armed attacks on Israel since at least the early 1990s,&lt;ref name=Guidere /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/search/Results.aspx?page=1&amp;casualties_type=&amp;casualties_max=&amp;perpetrator=3229&amp;charttype=line&amp;chart=overtime&amp;ob=GTDID&amp;od=desc&amp;expanded=yes#results-table|title=GTD Search Results|website=www.start.umd.edu|accessdate=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is no longer believed to possess any significant military capabilities. It is not designated a [[United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|Foreign Terrorist Organization]] by the [[United States]], and is not on the [[terrorism|terrorist]] lists of the [[United Nations|UN]], the [[European Union|EU]] or any other country.

The '''Baigong pipes''', which are also known as '''白公山鐵管''' ('''Bai Gongshan Iron Pipes''') and '''Delingha pipes''', are a series of pipe-like features identified by some as fossil trees or tree roots,&lt;ref&gt;"Alien Ruins Show" ''Xinmin Weekly''. October 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; found on and near White Mountain (白公山), transliterated as Mount Baigong (Báigōngshān), about {{convert|40|km|mi|adj=on|sp=us}} southwest of the city of [[Delingha]], in the [[Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]], [[Qinghai]] Province, [[China]].

==White Mountain (白公山)==
Some of the Baigong pipes are reported to be associated with three caves in White Mountain. These caves are reported to occur within the front face of White Mountain. The mouths of the two smaller caves have collapsed. Only the largest cave, which is 6 meters (18&amp;nbsp;feet) high, can be entered. The vague resemblance of the top of White Mountain to a pyramid has been the focus of speculation.&lt;ref name="xin1"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title= Chinese Scientists Head for Suspected ET Relics |work= |pages= |language= |publisher=Xinhua News Agency |date=June 19, 2002 |url= http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2002-06/19/content_448113.htm |access-date=November 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2016|reason=WP:FRINGE}}&lt;ref name=li1&gt;{{cite news |last=Li |first=Heng |title=Mysterious Pipes Left by 'ET' Reported from Qinghai |work=People's Daily Online |pages= |language= |publisher= |date=June 25, 2002 |url= http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200206/25/eng20020625_98530.shtml |access-date=November 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2016|reason=WP:FRINGE}}

Two pipe-like structures have been reported from the largest cave. One of these is described as being 40&amp;nbsp;cm (16&amp;nbsp;in) in diameter, one only preserved as a reddish-brown half-pipe formation. Dozens of upright pipe-like features, about 10 to 40&amp;nbsp;cm (4 to 16&amp;nbsp;inches) in diameter, were also found protruding from White Mountain above the largest cave.&lt;ref name="xin1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=li1/&gt;

==Tuosu Lake (Lake Toson)==
Similar formations were found on shore and within [[Tuosu Lake]], also transliterated as ''Lake Toson,'' which lies 80 meters (260&amp;nbsp;feet) from the mouth of the largest cave. On the beach of the lake, about 40 meters (130&amp;nbsp;feet) from the mouth of the largest cave, apparently flat-lying, hollow, pipe-like features were found, reddish-brown, and ranging in diameter from 2 to 4.5&amp;nbsp;cm (0.8 to 1.8&amp;nbsp;inch) and have an east–west orientation. Another group of similar features, presumably vertical, either protrude from or lie just below the surface of the lake, but the reports are unclear.&lt;ref name="xin1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="li1" /&gt; Tuosu Lake is a saline and alkaline lake&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Xiangzhong|last2=Zhou|first2=Xin|last3=Liu|first3=Weiguo|last4=Wang|first4=Zheng|last5=He|first5=Yuxin|last6=Xu|first6=Liming|title=Carbon and oxygen isotopic records from Lake Tuosu over the last 120  years in the Qaidam Basin, Northwestern China: The implications for paleoenvironmental reconstruction|journal=Global and Planetary Change|date=2016|volume=141|pages=54–62|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2016.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a dominant bacterial population made of ''[[Halomonas]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Long |first1=Qifu|last2=Feng|first2= Xiyuan|last3= Liu|first3= Jing|last4= Zhang |first4=Xin| last5=Shen|first5= Guoping|last6= Zhu |first6=Derui|url=http://english.gyig.cas.cn/pu/Papers_of_EE/201707/t20170725_181254.html |title=Microbial Diversity of Keluke-Tuosu Lake Wetland Reserve in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau|journal= Earth and Environment|volume=45|issue= 4|date=2017|pages=399–407}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar features==
Similar features have been found elsewhere, e.g. naturally occurring sandstone [[Liesegang rings (geology)|Liesegang-ring]] ''pipes'' in [[Arkansas]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://arkansasgeological.wordpress.com/2013/07/ ''Liesegang Band resembling an Iron Pipe.''], 2013, ''Arkansas Geological Survey'', Little Rock, Arkansas.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arkansasgeological.wordpress.com/2015/02/19/geopic-of-the-week-sandstone-pipe/ "Geopic of the Week: Sandstone Pipe"], 2015, ''Arkansas Geological Survey'', Little Rock, Arkansas.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arkansasgeological.wordpress.com/2015/02/20/more-views-of-sandstone-pipes/ "More Views of Sandstone Pipes"], 2015, ''Arkansas Geological Survey'', Little Rock, Arkansas.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''hematite pipes'' and ''hematite columns'' found sandstones in [[Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beitler|first1=B.|last2=Parry|first2=W.

==Investigation==
Associated with these pipe-like features are objects that were described as "rusty scraps" and "strangely shaped stones". Analysis of the former by Liu Shaolin at a local [[smeltery]] reportedly found that they consist of 30 percent [[ferric oxide]] (oxidized iron) and large amounts of [[silicon dioxide]] and [[calcium oxide]].&lt;ref name="li1" /&gt;  Because any metallurgical analysis reports the composition of a material analyzed not in terms of the actual minerals comprising it, but only in terms of percentages of the oxides of the specific elements present, the calcium present in the analyzed material could have been in the form of [[calcite]], a mineral that naturally forms [[concretion]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

According to news stories,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} the pipes were first discovered by a group of scientists from the United States who were seeking dinosaur fossils. The scientists are said to have reported the formations to local authorities in [[Delingha]]. However, the pipes did not attract attention until a later report, possibly one of six made by [[Ye Zhou]], appeared in the ''Henan Dahe Bao'' (河南大河报 'Henan Great River News') in June 2002. Quin Jianwen, a local official, discussed the pipe-like features with journalists of the [[Xinhua News Agency]] on June 16, 2002. The local government now promotes the features as a tourist attraction, to which road signs and tourist guides lead visitors.&lt;ref name="lusby1"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lusby |first1=J. |last2=Wan |first2=A. |title=1998 Discovery of Millennia-old Spacecraft Launch Pad in China? |work=City Weekend |pages= |language= |publisher= |date=July 18, 2002 |url= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2016|reason=WP:FRINGE}}

According to a 2003 article in the ''Xinmin Weekly'', Chinese scientists using atomic emission spectroscopy found the Baigong Pipes to contain organic matter of plant origin. In addition, the news article also stated that tree rings were found in sections of these rock formations and, as a result, they were judged to be fossil trees or tree roots.&lt;ref&gt;"Alien Ruins Show" ''Xinmin Weekly''. October 13, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The state-run newspaper ''[[People's Daily]]'' reported on a 2007 investigation in which a research fellow from the Chinese Earthquake Administration reported they had found some of the pipes to be highly radioactive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Peoples Daily|title=Probing into the "ET relic site" in China's Qinghai |url= http://english.people.com.cn/200705/25/eng20070525_378028.html|date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=June 2016|reason=WP:FRINGE}}

A '''Bohemian track''' ({{lang-de|Böhmischer Steig}}, {{lang-cz|Česká stezka}}) or '''Bohemian way''' (''Böhmweg'') refers to various communication routes over the ridges of the [[Vogtland]], the [[Ore Mountains]], the [[Elbe Sandstone Mountains]] and the [[Lusatian Mountains]], which linked the region of the [[March of Meissen]] and [[Upper Lusatia]] with [[Bohemia]] from the late 11th century. In 1118 there is the first indirect reference to the existence of such a link in a document in which there is mention of a customs post in the vicinity of the present-day town of [[Zwickau]]. 

The first direct reference is in 1143 when a document records a ''semita bohemica'' that ran from [[Altenburg]] via [[Waldenburg, Saxony|Waldenburg]] and [[Zschopau]] to Bohemia. Another reference appears in 1185. In the description of the border of the territory of [[Altzella Abbey]] we read: " ... ab illo per antiquam Boemie semitam ...".  This was a route that went from Waldheim via [[Sayda]] and the saddle near [[Deutscheinsiedel]] to [[Most (Czechia)|Most]] (now Brüx). 
Colloquially many of these Bohemian trails were also called [[salt road]]s. One example ran from [[Leipzig]] past present-day Neuhausen and over the [[Ore Mountain passes|Deutscheinsiedler Saddle]] towards [[Prague]].

* '''1317''' (''{{transl|ja|Bunpō gannen}}'' {{lang|ja|文保元年}}): The new era name was created to mark an event or series of events. The previous era ended and the new one commenced in ''Shōwa'' 6.

==Events of the ''Bunpō'' era==
During this era, Negotiations between the [[Shogunate|Bakufu]] and the two lines resulted in an agreement to alternate the throne between the two lines every 10 years (the [[Bunpō Agreement|''Bunpō'' Agreement]]). This agreement did not last very long, being broken by Emperor Go-Daigo.
* '''1317''' (''Bunpō 1, 9th month''): Former-[[Emperor Fushimi]] died at age 53 years.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1318''' (''Bunpō 2, 2nd month''): In the 11th year of Hanazono''-tennō'' 's reign (花園天皇11年), the emperor abdicated; and the succession (''senso'') was received by his cousin, the second son of former-Emperor Go-Uda. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Go-Daigo is said to have acceded to the throne (''sokui'').&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, p. 281; Varley, p. 44; n.b, a distinct act of ''senso'' is unrecognized prior to [[Emperor Tenji]]; and all sovereigns except [[Empress Jitō|Jitō]], [[Emperor Yōzei|Yōzei]], [[Emperor Go-Toba|Go-Toba]], and [[Emperor Fushimi|Fushimi]] have ''senso'' and ''sokui'' in the same year until the reign of [[Emperor Go-Murakami]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1319''' (''Bunpō 3, 4th month''): Emperor Go-Daigo caused the ''[[nengō]]'' to be changed to ''[[Gen'ō]]'' to mark the beginning of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;Varley, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ChristophHelwig1581.jpg|right|thumb|Christoph Helvig (1581&amp;ndash;1617)]]
'''Christoph Helvig'''&lt;ref&gt;Helwig, Hellwig, Christopher Helwich, Heiwich, Christophorus Helvicus, Helwigius.&lt;/ref&gt;  (1581&amp;ndash;1617) was a German chronologist and historian, theologian and linguist.

Helvig was born at [[Dreieich|Sprendlingen]].  In chronology he generally was a follower of [[Joseph Scaliger]]. He is mentioned by [[Sir Thomas Browne]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/pseudodoxia/pseudo61.html Sir Thomas Browne's Vulgar Errors VI.i: The Age of the World&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Locke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/Locke0154/Works/HTMLs/0128-02_Pt05_Reading.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501003948/http://oll.libertyfund.org/Texts/Locke0154/Works/HTMLs/0128-02_Pt05_Reading.html |archivedate=2007-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He remained an authority cited well into the eighteenth century; [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''General Plan of Education'' described a course in this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The technical part of chronology, or the art of computing and adjusting time, as it is very difficult, so it is not of absolute necessity, but should, however, be taught, so far as it can be learned without the loss of those hours which are required for attainments of nearer concern. The student may join with this treatise Le Clerc's Compendium of History; and afterwards may, for the historical part of chronology, procure Helvicus's and [[Henry Isaacson (chronologist)|Isaacson]]'s Tables; and, if he is desirous of attaining the technical part, may first peruse [[William Holder|Holder]]'s Account of Time, Hearne's Ductor Historicus, [[Aegidius Strauch II|Strauchius]], the first part of [[Petavius]]'s Rationarium Temporum; and, at length, Scaliger de Emendatiene Temporum. And, for instruction in the method of his historical studies, he may consult Hearne's Ductor Historicus, [[Degory Wheare|Wheare]]'s Lectures, [[Richard Rawlinson|Rawlinson]]'s Directions for the Study of History; and, for ecclesiastical history, Cave and Dupin, Baronius and Fleury.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11768/11768-8.txt&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His ''Theatrum historicum et chronologicum'' was published in 1609.
&lt;ref&gt;English translation as ''The Historical and Chronological Theatre of Christopher Helvicus, Distributed into Equal Intervals of Tens, Fifties, and Hundreds: With an Assignation of Empires, Kingdoms, Governments'', 1687.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Compendiosa Institutio Linguæ Ebraicae'' was a Hebrew grammar. He became professor of Greek and Oriental languages and of theology at the [[University of Giessen]].

{{Chinese name|[[Zhuang (surname)|Chuang]]}}

'''Chuang Chi-fa''' (also known as Zhuang Jifa; {{zh|莊吉發}}; born 24 May 1936) is a Taiwanese historian who studies Chinese history, in particular [[Manchuria|Manchu]] history. Chuang is one of the few linguistics researchers with a mastery of the [[Manchu language]].

His 1982 book "Qing Gaozong shiquan wugong yanjiu" (researching the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s "[[Ten Great Campaigns]]") was called a ''tour de force'' by Yingcong Dai of William Paterson University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dai|first=Yingcong|year=2004|title=A Disguised Defeat: The Myanmar Campaign of the Qing Dynasty|journal=Modern Asian Studies|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=38|pages=145–189|doi=10.1017/S0026749X04001040|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=190987|quote=In 1982, Zhuang Jifa (Chuang Chi-fa) of the National Palace Museum of Taipei published his tour de force, Qing Gaozong shiquan wugong yanjiu, which has a chapter on the Myanmar campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Ch’en Chieh-hsien]] he was one of the first historians to research the Manchu language documents in the Qing dynasty archives at the National Palace Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elliott|first=Mark C.|date=June 2001|title=The Manchu-Language Archives of the Qing Dynasty and the Origins of the Palace Memorial System Late Imperial China|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|volume=22|issue=1|pages=1–70|issn=1086-3257|doi=10.1353/late.2001.0002|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/late_imperial_china/v022/22.1elliott.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Chuang was born in [[Nanzhuang, Miaoli|Nanzhuang]] [[Township (Republic of China)|township]] of [[Miaoli County]], [[Taiwan]]. His parents died when he was young, and he was adopted by a family and taught under strict doctrines that made him into the person he is today. He graduated in 1956 from the [[National Taipei University of Education]] and in 1969 from the [[National Taiwan University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://r8.ntue.edu.tw/elite/01/01-43.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Chuang teaches and studies modern Chinese history, Chinese minorities history, and Manchu history (his main focus).&lt;ref&gt;http://r8.ntue.edu.tw/elite/01/01-43.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He was a researcher at the [[National Palace Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrc.ntu.edu.tw/thci/Author.aspx?id=73413 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722235807/http://www.hrc.ntu.edu.tw/thci/Author.aspx?id=73413 |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Beatrice S|title=Monarchs and Ministers: The Grand Council in Mid-Ch'ing China, 1723-1820|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft287004wt;chunk.id=0;doc.view=print|year=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has sought to demonstrate in several of his books that [[British colonialism]] in India played a major role in how [[Europe]]an scientific fields developed. ''Science and the Raj: A study of British India'' is one of the pioneer contribution in the field of history of [[science in India]]. His latest work '''The Trishanku Nation''' encapsulates his reflections on contemporary India.

[[File:Shahbanu Farah Pahlavi, 1975.png|thumb|150px|[[Farah Pahlavi]] wearing a printed silk draped turban in 1975]]
A '''draped turban''' or '''turban hat''' is a millinery design in which fabric is draped to create headwear closely moulded to the head. Sometimes it may be stiffened or padded, although simpler versions may just comprise wound fabric that is knotted or stitched. It may include a peak, feather or other details to add height. It generally covers most or all of the hair.

In fashion, the draped turban has a history dating back to at least the late 18th century, and had revivals in most decades of the 20th century. Notably, it rose to popularity in the 1910s as a symbol of eastern glamour, while in the 1940s it was worn by everyone from Hollywood stars to [[Land Girl|land girls]]. In the 1960s and 1970s, it was revived by designers including [[Biba]] in the UK and [[Halston]] in the US – and worn by royalty and hippies alike. More recently, new designs began appearing on the fashion catwalks and in the second ''[[Sex and the City]]'' movie.

==18th and 19th centuries==

[[File:Eléonore de Montmorency.jpg|thumb|150px|Portrait of Eléonore de Montmorency wearing a turban, c.1810]]
While earlier portraits show examples of the turban in women's dress – notably Vermeer's 1665 portrait ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' – the draped turban is first recorded as a widespread fashion in Britain in the late 18th century, rising to even greater popularity during the [[Regency era]]; this was a fashion said to be inspired by increased trade with India for the import of cottons.&lt;ref name="VGG Walford"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walford|first1=Jonathan|title=History of hats for women|url=http://vintagefashionguild.org/fashion-history/the-history-of-womens-hats/|website=vintagefashionguild.org|publisher=Vintage Fashion Guild|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion may also have been partly inspired by growing interest in, and knowledge of, the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Turkey]]. The writings of [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]] on Turkey are also said to have been an influence. There are several portraits of her in turban style headgear and the turban was also sometimes known as the ''turk'' or ''chiffonet''.&lt;ref name="The Duchess of Devonshire"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Duchess of Devonshire's Gossip Guide to the 18th century|url=http://georgianaduchessofdevonshire.blogspot.co.uk/2009/03/turbans.html|website=georgianaduchessofdevonshire.blogspot.co.uk|publisher=georgianagossip|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of turban was initially simple, in keeping with the drape of gowns of the time, but as its popularity developed it tended to follow the fashion in hair and became progressively larger as hairstyles became more elaborate.&lt;ref name="Making a Regency ballgown"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Hope|title=It's All in the Details: Making a Regency Ball Gown|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~hag/regency/tips/|website=uvm.edu|publisher=University of Vermont|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turbans might be lavishly decorated with plumes for balls and functions, but also for daywear – as satirised in a 1796 [[James Gillray]] cartoon, ''High Change in Bond Street''. The fashion remained during the early decades of the 19th century, with examples of Paris and London fashions from the 1830s showing ornate turban headdresses topped with tall plumes.&lt;ref name="1831 costumes parisiens"&gt;{{cite web|title=1831 Costumes Parisiens plate|url=http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/fpc/id/218/rec/1|website=libraries.claremont.edu|publisher=Claremont Colleges|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fashions and bonnets 1837"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashions and bonnets, winter 1837|url=http://ccdl.libraries.claremont.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/fpc/id/200/rec/2|website=libraries.claremont.edu|publisher=Claremont Colleges Libraries|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early 20th century==

[[Paul Poiret]], the so-called 'Sultan de la mode', included the turban in his revival of '[[Orientalism|oriental]]' styles in the early 1910s.&lt;ref name="Kyoto CI, Poiret costumes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Collections 1910s |url=http://www.kci.or.jp/archives/digital_archives/detail_126_e.html |website=kci.or.jp |publisher=Kyoto Costume Institute |accessdate=29 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029142726/http://www.kci.or.jp/archives/digital_archives/detail_126_e.html |archivedate=29 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his research Poiret visited the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in order to study its collection of antique Indian turbans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kalinina |first1=Aline |title=Paul Poiret: King of Fashion|url=http://www.passportmagazine.ru/article/2344/|accessdate=3 November 2014 |work=Passport Magazine|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blum |first1=Dilys |title=Ahead of fashion: hats of the 20th century |journal=Bulletin |date=1993 |volume=89 |issue=377-378 |page=36 |publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; declaring "I admired unwaveringly the diversity of their so logical and so elegant forms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Poiret |first1=Paul |last2=Guest |first2=Stephen Haden |title=King of fashion : the autobiography of Paul Poiret |date=1931|publisher=V &amp; A, (2009 reprint) |location=London |isbn=9781851775644 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turbans continued gaining in popularity from the early 1920s. Some of this may have been due to the increasing availability of the [[Vintage car|motor car]], since the close-fitting design helped to protect the hair and head from the elements. A 1923 fashion report in ''[[The Times]]'' described the arrival of neat leather caps and new turban designs, adding that the turban is: "seen in many embroidered and swathed varieties, some of which are built on 'beret', others on Russian designs, turning right off the face, and some on close-fitting lines."&lt;ref name="The Times 43486"&gt;{{cite news|title=London fashions: some new millinery|issue=43486|publisher=The Times|date=31 October 1923|ref=pg. 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its popularity survived the decade, a 1929 newspaper report on the autumn Paris fashions noted that the [[cloche hat]] had given way to the [[Basque people|Basque]] [[beret]] and the turban trimmed with ribbon bows.&lt;ref name="The Times 45018"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paris fashions: an autumn show|issue=45018|publisher=The Times|date=8 October 1928|ref=pg.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designs were typically made of silk, felt or velvet and could be finished with additional details such as feathers or brooches.

In 1937, the turban hat was tipped as one of the "smartest models in the new millinery", with new designs being shown in heavier fabrics such as velvet.&lt;ref name="The Daily Times 141037"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1996&amp;dat=19371014&amp;id=UUAyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=nq8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1345,2318995|title=Draped turban smart|accessdate=28 October 2014|publisher=The Daily Times Beaver and Rochester|date=14 October 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London, ''The Times'' reported on a Paris ensemble of [[Karakul sheep|astrakhan fur]] coat with velvet dress and draped velvet turban to match.&lt;ref name="The Times 47824"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paris fashions: seasonal colours|issue=47824|publisher=The Times|date=25 October 1937|ref=pg17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, it featured a high draped turban with attached veil as being among the latest bridal fashions.&lt;ref name="The Times 47995"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bridal fashions: romantic styles and lovely materials|issue=47995|publisher=The Times|date=16 May 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime and post-war popularity==
[[File:How a British Woman Dresses in Wartime- Utility Clothing in Britain, 1943 D14780.jpg|thumb|A turban photographed by the [[Ministry of Information (UK)|Ministry of Information]] to promote wartime chic]]

The hat remained popular in Europe throughout [[World War II|wartime]] – it may have been helped by the fact that women were working in manual jobs in factories and farms. It was a design that could be created with minimal sewing skills and helped to conceal the hair when access to hairdressers, shampoo, and even water, might be limited. Simple patterns for draped turbans had been published from the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Midvale draped turban pattern"&gt;{{cite web|title=Home Sewing Tips from the 1920s - Sew Yourself a Draped Turban!|url=http://midvalevintagepost.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/home-sewing-tips-from-1920s-sew.html|website=midvalevintagepost.blogspot.co.uk|publisher=Midvale Cottage Post|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]] in the UK showcased a turban as part of a series of photographs to promote possibilities for wartime chic during a period when [[utility clothing]] and rationing were interrupting the traditional fashion industry. While DIY turbans were easy to construct – a wartime [[Pathe News|British Pathé]] film even demonstrated how to make a selection of designs with a couple of knotted scarves as part of its ''Ways and Means'' series – many materials used for making hats were excluded from the worst rationing strictures during the war, and this may help to explain the rise in whimsical hat styles for those who could afford them.&lt;ref name="VGG Walford"/&gt;

===Hollywood-style glamour===
[[File:Carmen Miranda - Grauman's Chinese Theatre, 1941.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carmen Miranda]] wearing a turban, 1941]]
While the fashion for the turban was partly borne of necessity in Europe, it became chic when it appeared on the heads of Hollywood icons. The French milliner [[Madame Paulette]] (Pauline Adam de la Bruyère) is often credited with reviving the turban and claimed to have been inspired by the designs she saw on French girls cycling the streets of Paris during the war. She went on to create hats worn by [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Marlene Dietrich]] and [[Greta Garbo]].&lt;ref name="Another Represa"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Represa|first1=Marta|title=Hats by Madame Paulette|url=http://www.anothermag.com/current/view/3583/Hats_by_Madame_Paulette|accessdate=28 October 2014|publisher=Another|date=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glamourdaze&gt;{{cite web|title=A Short History of Women's Fashion – 1900 to 1969 |url=http://glamourdaze.com/history-of-womens-fashion|website=glamourdaze.com |publisher=Glamourdaze|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she would also create designs for fashion houses such as [[Chanel S.A.|Chanel]] and [[Emanuel Ungaro|Ungaro]]&lt;ref name="VFG Paulette"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bramlett|first1=Lizzie|title=Paulette|url=http://vintagefashionguild.org/label-resource/paulette/|website=vintagefashionguild.org|publisher=Vintage Fashion Guild|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Madame Agnès]], who had trained under [[Caroline Reboux]], was also designing turbans and a black fabric creation with ornate padded top-piece and scarf draping carried under the chin is part of the museum collection of the [[Fashion Institute of Design &amp; Merchandising|FIDM]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="FIDM Agnés turban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Agnés turban, c. 1940-42|url=http://blog.fidmmuseum.org/museum/2011/04/agn%C3%A9s-turban-c-1940-42.html|website=blog.fidmmuseum.org|publisher=FIDM|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Lana Turner]] created an iconic image of femme fatale in turban in ''[[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1946 film)|The Postman Always Rings Twice]]'', the growing US popularity of South American stars such as [[Carmen Miranda]] also raised the profile of the draped turban as glamour wear  – Miranda wore hers in a variety of extreme permutations in her films.&lt;ref name=Glamourdaze/&gt;

==1950s and beyond==
Versions of the draped turban started to gain in popularity again from the mid 1950s; in 1955, ''The Times'' reported on a [[Christian Dior S.A.|Dior]] ensemble taking in the eastern trend and comprising [[sheath dress]] in brocaded silk, matching jacket trimmed with [[sable]] fur and brocaded silk draped turban.&lt;ref name="The Times  53314"&gt;{{cite news|title=Picture Gallery|issue=53314|publisher=The Times|date=1 September 1955|ref=pg.10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turban styles were adapted to accommodate more bouffant hair styles.&lt;ref name="VGG Walford"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howell|first1=Frances S.|last2=Weill|first2=Ruth|title=History of American Dress from the 15th and 16th Century Through 1965|date=2010|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|isbn=1450547389|page=185|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pv0cXVk8YMoC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=draped+turban&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rbY95vVRvs&amp;sig=iEIQ02I8UBLGPeiplSg1hW-Q9iI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F3VPVIX5CLOQ7Ab8_YHwCg&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&amp;q=draped%20turban&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milliner [[Claude Saint-Cyr]] – who designed hats for the [[Elizabeth II|Queen]] – featured a new supple felt turban in 1956 that covered the ears and rose to a draped peak at the back of the head.&lt;ref name="The Times 53596."&gt;{{cite news|title=The Shape of Things to Come|issue=53596|publisher=The Times|date=30 July 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1970s, the London boutique Biba featured turbans, often paired with kaftans or diaphanous blouses – a look in keeping with the prevailing trends for both 1920s/30s and eastern styles. Often turbans were created as part of eveningwear; an example of a Biba evening coat and matching turban in [[rayon]] and [[Lurex]] knit is now part of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] archive.&lt;ref name="V&amp;A Biba"&gt;{{cite web|title=Evening coat and hat|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O365709/evening-coat-and-biba/|website=vam.ac.uk|publisher=Victoria &amp; Albert Museum|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; American designer Halston also featured the turban for eveningwear, and dressed fashion icons such as [[Bianca Jagger]].&lt;ref name="Glamour Jagger"&gt;{{cite news|title=70s fashion icons|url=http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/fashion/celebrity-fashion/2011/03/70s-fashion-style-icons#!image-number=2|accessdate=28 October 2014|publisher=Glamour|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fashion for draped turbans also spread beyond disco glamour – [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Joan Collins]] and the Queen all wore them with daywear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A LILAC SILK JERSEY DRAPED TURBAN|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/textiles-costume/a-lilac-silk-jersey-draped-turban-labeled-5500778-details.aspx|accessdate=29 October 2014|publisher=Christie's|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian Chilvers"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chilvers|first1=Simon|title=Joan Collins does glamour: how to dress like a style icon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2009/apr/23/tv-joan-collins-style|accessdate=29 October 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Royal Hats turban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hat types: The Turban|url=http://royalhats.wordpress.com/2013/09/26/hat-types-the-turban/|website=Royal Hats|publisher=Royal Hats|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern revivals===
[[File:Viktoria Sekrier crop.jpg|thumb|150px|Turban style headgear by Michon Schur, [[New York Fashion Week]] 2007]]
Turbans were tipped as a potential eveningwear accessory in 2006, as part of a [[1970s in fashion|1970s disco revival]].&lt;ref name="The Times 68843"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lazard|first1=Clare|title=Out There Seventies|issue=68843|publisher=The Times|date=28 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began appearing on the fashion catwalks in 2007 and made an appearance in ''[[Sex and the City 2]]''  – including a gold model from [[Ralph Lauren]]'s 2009 collection.&lt;ref name="Daily Telegraph 2010"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sex and the City 2: get the look|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/galleries/TMG7748814/Sex-and-the-City-2-get-the-look.html|accessdate=29 October 2014|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elle Hebert"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hebert|first1=Emily|title=Hair secrets: Sex and the City 2|url=http://www.elle.com/beauty/hair/hair-secrets-sex-the-city-2-446062|accessdate=29 October 2014|publisher=Elle|date=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3403">'''Enrique de Gandía''' ([[Buenos Aires]], February 1, 1906 - July 18, 2000) was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[historian]], author of over a hundred books.

He taught, as a professor of [[Instituto Universitario Nacional del Arte|School of Fine Arts]] (1948), the [[University of Morón]] (1960) and the [[University of Belgrano]] (1967), being co-founder of the latter two. He also held the chair of Political Science at the [[Universidad Argentina John F. Kennedy|Kennedy University]] (1991). In 1948 he was director of the Buenos Aires Municipal Museum (now the Historical Museum of Buenos Aires "Cornelio de Saavedra").

His career was recognized with the designation as a full member of the National Academies of History (1930), Moral and Political Sciences (1938 ), Geography (1985), and the National Academy of Sciences (1987). In 1933 he co-founded the [[National Institute of San Martin]]. In 1930 he co-founded the [[Paraguayan Institute of Historical Research]], this institution and the [[Institute of History and Geography of Paraguay]] it would appoint an honorary member. He received numerous awards, including Konex 1984, the appointment of Government of Portugal as Commander of the Order of Prince Henry the Navigator (1991), ''honorary doctorates'' of the [[National University of Asuncion]] and [[University of the Basque Country]].

He was considered by [[Paul Gallez]], member and initiator of the [[Argentine School of Protocartography]].
He was the first to theorise that the fourth [[peninsula]] of [[Asia]] (called sometimes [[Cattigara Peninsula]]) in ancient maps was [[South America]] in his book "Primitivos navegantes vascos".

{{nihongo|'''''Genbun'''''|元文}} was a {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]|年号|''nengō''|"year name"}}  after ''[[Kyōhō]]'' and before ''[[Kanpō]].''  This period spanned the years from April 1736 through February 1741.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005).

==Change of era==
* '''1736''' {{nihongo|''Genbun gannen''|元文元年}}: To mark the enthronement of Sakuramachi, the era was changed to ''Genbun'' (meaning "Original civility"). The previous era ended and the new one commenced in ''Kyōhō'' 21, on the 21st day of the 4th month.

==Events of the ''Genbun'' era==
* '''1736''' (''Genbun 1''): The shogunate published an edict declaring that henceforth, the sole, authorized coinage in the empire would be those copper coins which were marked on the obverse with the character '''文''' (pronounced ''bun'' in Japanese or pronounced ''wen'' in Chinese—which is to say, the same character which is found in this era name of ''Genbun'').&lt;ref name="t418"&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA418,M1  p. 418.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1737''' (''Genbun 2, 11th month''): A comet is noticed in the western part of the sky.&lt;ref name="t418"/&gt;
* '''1738''' (''Genbun 3''): Esoteric Shinto rituals {{nihongo|Daijō-ye|大嘗會,|ダイジヤウヱ,|''Daijō-sai''|}} were performed by the emperor.&lt;ref name="t418"/&gt;
* '''1739''' (''Genbun 4''):  Some foundrymen in Edo are commanded to create iron coins for use across the empire.&lt;ref name="t418"/&gt;
* '''1739''' (''Genbun 4''): Hosokawa Etchū-no-kami of Higo was killed in Edo castle by Itakura Katsukane, and the killer was ordered to commit suicide as just punishment; however, Shōgun [[Tokugawa Yoshimune|Yoshimune]] personally intervened to mitigate the adverse consequences for the killer's ''fudai'' family.&lt;ref&gt;Screech, Timon.

[[Image:Georg Ebers.jpg|thumb|Georg Ebers]]
[[Image:ebers7766.jpg|thumb|Ebers medical papyrus, giving treatment for cancer]]

'''Georg Moritz Ebers''' ([[Berlin]], 1 March 1837 – [[Tutzing]], [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], 7 August 1898), German [[Egyptologist]] and novelist, discovered the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] medical papyrus, of ''ca.'' 1550 BCE, named for him (see ''[[Ebers Papyrus]]'') at [[Luxor]] ([[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]]) in the winter of 1873–74. Now in the [[Leipzig University Library|Library of the University of Leipzig]], the ''Ebers Papyrus'' is among the most important [[History of ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian]] [[medicine|medical]] [[papyrus|papyri]]. It is one of two of the oldest preserved medical documents anywhere—the other being the ''[[Edwin Smith Papyrus]]'' (''ca.'' 1600 BCE).

==Life==
At [[Göttingen]] he studied jurisprudence, and at Berlin Oriental languages and archaeology. Having made a special study of Egyptology, he became in 1865 ''[[Dozent]]'' in Egyptian language and antiquities at [[Jena]], becoming professor in 1868. In 1870 he was appointed professor in these subjects at [[Leipzig]]. He had made two scientific journeys to Egypt, and his first work of importance, ''Ägypten und die Bücher [[Moses]],'' appeared in 1867–1868. In 1874 he edited the celebrated medical papyrus (''Papyrus Ebers'') which he had discovered in Thebes (translation by H. Joachim, 1890).

Ebers early conceived the idea of popularising Egyptian lore by means of historical romances. ''Eine ägyptische Königstochter'' was published in 1864 and obtained great success. His subsequent works of the same kind—''Uarda'' (1877), ''Homo sum'' (1878), ''Die Schwestern'' (1880), ''Der Kaiser'' (1881), of which the scene is laid in Egypt at the time of [[Hadrian]], ''Serapis'' (1885), ''Die Nilbraut'' (1887), and ''[[Cleopatra VII of Egypt|Kleopatra]]'' (1894), were also well received, and did much to make the public familiar with the discoveries of Egyptologists. Ebers also turned his attention to other fields of historical fiction—especially the 16th century (''Die Frau Bürgermeisterin,'' 1882; ''Die Gred,'' 1887)—without, however, attaining the success of his Egyptian novels.

His other writings include a descriptive work on Egypt (''Aegypten in Wort und Bild,'' 2nd ed., 1880); ''[[Palestine in Picture and Word]]'' (''{{lang|de|Palästina in Bild und Word}}''), an 1884 translation of the English series ''[[Picturesque Palestine, Sinai, and Egypt]]''; a life (1885) of his old teacher, the Egyptologist [[Karl Richard Lepsius]]; and a guide to Egypt (1886). In 1889, the state of his health led him to retire from his chair at Leipzig on a pension.

Ebers's ''Collected Works'' appeared in 25 volumes at [[Stuttgart]] (1893–1895). Many of his books have been translated into English. For his life, see his ''Die Geschichte meines Lebens'' (Stuttgart, 1893); also R. Gosche, ''G. Ebers, der Forscher und Dichter'' (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1887).

'''Ignaz Aurelius Fessler''', aka '''Feßler''' ({{lang-hu|'''Fessler Ignác Aurél'''}}; May 18, 1756 – December 15, 1839) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] ecclesiastic, politician, historian and [[freemason]].

== Biography ==
Fessler was born in the village of [[Zurndorf]] in the hungarian [[Moson County]]. In 1773, he joined the order of [[Capuchin friars]], and in 1779 was ordained priest. He had meanwhile continued his [[Classics|classical]] and [[philological]] studies, and his [[Liberalism|liberal]] views brought him into frequent conflict with his superiors.

In 1784, while at the monastery of [[Mödling]], near [[Vienna]], he wrote to the emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], making suggestions for the better education of the clergy and drawing his attention to the irregularities of the monasteries. The searching investigation which followed raised up against him many implacable enemies. In 1784 he was appointed professor of Oriental languages and [[hermeneutics]] in the university of [[Lviv|Lemberg]], when he took the degree of doctor of divinity; and shortly afterwards he was released from his [[monastic vows]] on the intervention of the emperor.

In 1788 he brought out his [[tragedy]] of ''Sidney'', an exposé of the tyranny of [[James II of England|James II]] and of the fanaticism of the Roman Catholics in [[England]]. This was attacked so violently as profane and revolutionary that he was compelled to resign his office and seek refuge in [[Silesia]]. In [[Breslau]] he met with a cordial reception from G. W. Komn, the publisher, and was, moreover, subsequently employed by the prince of Carolath-Schbnaich as tutor to his sons. In 1791 Fessler was converted to [[Lutheranism]] and next year contracted an unhappy marriage, which was dissolved in 1802, when he married again.

In 1796 he went to [[Berlin]], where he founded a humanitarian society. In April 1800, through his introduction, the philosopher [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] was initiated into [[freemasonry]] in a Berlin lodge. Fessler was commissioned by the freemasons to assist Fichte in reforming the statutes and ritual of their lodge. At first Fichte was the warm admirer of Fessler, and was disposed to aid Fessler in his proposed reform.  But later he became Fessler's bitter opponent. Their controversy attracted much attention among freemasons.&lt;ref name="Mackey"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Mackey's National Freemason|title=Fichte as a Freemason|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ip5bF1xtRB0C&amp;pg=PA430|page=430|date=October 1872 to September 1873|editor=Albert G. Mackey|isbn=9780766157170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after this, Fessler obtained a government appointment in connection with the newly acquired [[Poland|Polish]] provinces, but in consequence of the [[battle of Jena]] (1806) he lost this office, and remained in very needy circumstances until 1809, when he was summoned to [[St. Petersburg]] by [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]], to fill the post of court councillor, the professorship of oriental languages and philosophy at the Alexander-Nevski Academy, and finally minister to the Court of St. James (Britain). This office, however, he was soon obliged to resign, owing to his alleged [[atheist]]ic tendencies, but he was subsequently nominated a member of the legislative commission by the Emperor.

In 1815 he went with his family to [[Sarepta]], where he joined the [[Moravia]]n community and again became strongly orthodox. This cost him the loss of his salary, but it was restored to him upon his return in 1817. In November 1820, he was appointed [[consistory (Protestantism)|consistorial]] president of the evangelical communities at Saratov and subsequently became chief [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|superintendent]] of the Lutheran communities in St. Petersburg. In recognition of his important services to [[Hungary]] as a historian, he was in 1831 elected a corresponding member of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]]. He died at St. Petersburg.

==Writings==
Fessler was a voluminous writer, and during his life exercised great influence; but, with the possible exception of the history of Hungary, none of his books has any value now. He did not pretend to any critical treatment of his materials, and most of his historical works are practically historical [[novel]]s. He did much, however, to make the study of history popular. His works are all written in [[German language|German]].

His most important works are:
* ''Die Geschichten der Ungarn und ihrer Landsassen'' (10 vols., Leipzig, 1815-1825)
* ''[[Marcus Aurelius]]'' (3 vols., Breslau, 1790-1792; 3rd edition, 4 vols., 1799)
* ''Aristides und Themistokles'' (2 vols., Berlin, 1792; 3rd edition, 1818)
* ''[[Attila]], König der Hunnen'' (Breslau, 1794)
* ''[[Matthias Corvinus]]'' (2 vols., Breslau, 1793-1794)
* ''Die drei grossen Könige der Hungarn aus dem [[Árpád-Arpad]]ischen Stamme'' (Breslau, 1808)
* ''Rückblick auf meine Siebzigjährige Pilgerschaft'' (2nd ed., Leipzig 1851)

[[Captain (naval)|Captain]] '''John Perkins''' (died 27 January 1812), nicknamed '''Jack Punch''', was a British [[Royal Navy]] officer. Perkins was perhaps the first [[mulatto]] commissioned officer in the Royal Navy. He rose from obscurity to be one of the most successful ship captains of the [[Georgian era|Georgian]] navy. He captained a 10-gun schooner during the [[American War of Independence]] and in a two-year period captured at least 315 enemy ships.

Later in his career Perkins acted for the navy as a [[Espionage|spy]] and undertook missions to [[Cuba]] and [[Saint-Domingue]] (modern day [[Haiti]]). At the start of the [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt in Saint-Domingue]] he was captured in [[Cap-Haïtien|Cap-Français]] and sentenced to death for supplying the rebel slave army with weapons.

After his rescue he was promoted commander in 1797 and then [[post-captain]] in 1800. Perkins went on to cause an international incident with the [[Denmark|Danes]] when he fired on two of their ships during peacetime. Toward the end of his career he participated in capture of the islands of [[Sint Eustatius|Saint Eustatia]] and [[Saba]] from the French.  Perkins also attacked a [[74-gun]] [[ship-of-the-line]] with a 32-gun [[frigate]].

==Early life and career==
John Perkins was probably born in [[Kingston, Jamaica]] in the middle of the 18th century. Very little is known of his birth or early life. One account written 30 years after his death described him as of mixed race. &lt;ref&gt;Donnithorne.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1775 Perkins first appears in the records of the Royal Navy when he was appointed to the 50-gun {{HMS|Antelope|1703|6}}, the [[flagship]] of the commander-in-chief of the [[Jamaica Station (Royal Navy)|Jamaica station]] as an extra [[maritime pilot|pilot]]. "His knowledge of the different ports, &amp;C. in the West Indies was, perhaps, seldom equalled, and never surpassed."&lt;ref name="NC27"&gt;Naval Chronicle, 27 (1812), pp. 351–352&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1778 he was placed in command of the [[schooner]] ''Punch'', a ship probably armed with ten 2 or 4-pounder guns, though no detailed records survive. At this time he received his nickname Jack Punch, most probably earned because of the name of his command. During the next two years Perkins claimed to have captured 315 ships, an average of three per week, a claim that was later endorsed by the Jamaican [[House of Assembly]].&lt;ref name="JJHA8"&gt;Journals of the Jamaican house of assembly, 8&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Admiral [[Sir Peter Parker, 1st Baronet|Sir Peter Parker]], and subsequent admirals, used Perkins in clandestine missions against the French at Cap-Français, a province in the South West of [[Saint-Domingue]], and the Spanish in [[Havana]], Cuba. Parker eventually commissioned Perkins as a [[lieutenant]] and gave him command of {{HMS|Endeavour|1781|2}}.&lt;ref name="END1"&gt;ADM 51/4181 Captains' logs Endeavour 31 May 1776 – 21 Feb 1781&lt;/ref&gt; The 12-gun ''Endeavour''&lt;ref name="JJC114"&gt;Ships of the Royal Navy, Colledge, p.114.&lt;/ref&gt; was an American-built schooner with a [[keel]] of 60 feet and [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of 20.&lt;ref name="LBOB230"&gt;Letter-Books and Order-Books of George, Lord Rodney, Admiral of the White Squadron, Volume 1. Page 230&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Archibald Campbell (British Army officer)|Archibald Campbell]] stated in a letter of recommendation that "By the gallant exertions of this officer some hundred vessels were taken, burnt, or destroyed, and above three thousand men added to the list of prisoners of war in favour of Britain; in short, the character and conduct of Captain Perkins were not less admired by his superior officers in Jamaica, than respected by those of the enemy."&lt;ref name="JJHA8"/&gt;
 
In 1782 Perkins captured a much larger vessel containing several important French officers.&lt;ref name="JJHA8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LBOB490"&gt;Letter-Books and Order-Books of George, Lord Rodney, Admiral of the White Squadron, Volume 1. Page 490&lt;/ref&gt; The commander of the Jamaica station, Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|George Rodney]], promoted Perkins to master and commander of ''Endeavour'', and added two guns to her raising her armament to fourteen guns, thus putting her on the official Navy List as a [[sloop-of-war]].&lt;ref name="LAR344"&gt;The Life and Correspondence of the Late Admiral Rodney. Godfrey Basil Mundy, p. 344,345&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LBOB511"&gt;Letter-Books and Order-Books of George, Lord Rodney, Admiral of the White Squadron, Volume 1. Page 511&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2LBOB685"&gt;Letter-Books and Order-Books of George, Lord Rodney, Admiral of the White Squadron, Volume 2. 685&lt;/ref&gt; Rodney's promotion of Perkins was disallowed.&lt;ref name="LAR344"/&gt; Rodney wrote later to [[Sir Philip Stephens, 1st Baronet|Philip Stephens]], [[Secretary to the Admiralty|First Secretary to the Admiralty]], in an attempt to confirm the promotion. "I must therefore desire you will please represent to their Lordships, that on my arrival at Jamaica, I found Mr. Perkins lieutenant and commander of the Endeavour schooner – that he bore an excellent character, and had done great service."&lt;ref name="LAR344"/&gt; Despite his request Perkins was demoted back to the rank of lieutenant and the guns ordered to be removed. At the end of the American War of Independence he was "on the beach" (meaning that he was without a posting on a ship) as a [[half-pay]] lieutenant. 
 
For several years between 1783 and 1790 Perkins disappeared from the books of the Royal Navy. It may be during this time that he turned to [[piracy]] as there is a French source and several English records that describe him as such.&lt;ref name="LN311"&gt;Lady Nugent's Journal of Her Residence in Jamaica from 1801 to 1805, Shepherd, p. 311,312&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CKH303"&gt;Christophe: King of Haiti, Cole, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, fifteen years after he had first joined the navy, Perkins made an application to the Jamaican House of Assembly for their assistance in achieving his promotion. After presenting his certificates to the assembly, the assembly investigated Perkins’ claim and resolved to make an application to the [[Admiralty]] for his promotion to [[post-captain]].&lt;ref name="JJHA8"/&gt;

==Capture on Saint-Domingue==
In 1790 Perkins volunteered once more and served under Admiral [[Philip Affleck (Royal Navy officer)|Philip Affleck]]. For several years there is no record that he held an official command but in 1792 Captain [[Thomas McNamara Russell]] of the 32-gun frigate {{HMS|Diana|1757|6}}, on a relief mission to the authorities on Saint-Domingue, was informed that a British officer was under arrest and due to be executed in [[Jérémie]] for supplying arms to the rebel slaves. Officially Britain and France were not at war and Russell requested that Perkins be released. The French authorities promised that he would be and then later refused. After numerous letters had been exchanged Russell determined that the French had no intention to release Perkins. Russell sailed around Cap-Français to Jérémie and met with the 12-gun {{HMS|Ferret|1784|6}} under Captain Nowell. It was agreed that Nowell's first lieutenant, an officer named Godby, would go ashore and recover Perkins whilst the two ships remained offshore within cannon shot, ready to land an invasion force if need be.&lt;ref name="NC27"/&gt; Lieutenant Godby landed and after negotiations Perkins was released.&lt;ref name="NC17"&gt;Naval Chronicle, 17 (1807), pp. 458–462&lt;/ref&gt; Perkins then disappears once more from the records for a short time.

==Return to service==
In September 1793 Perkins returned to the books of the Navy. Perkins is listed as commanding {{HMS|Spitfire|1793|6}}, a 4-gun schooner.&lt;ref name="ADM8/69"&gt; ADM 8/69 Admiralty Records held at the National Archives, Kew&lt;/ref&gt; He accompanied Commodore [[John Ford (Royal Navy officer)|John Ford's]] squadron when the British, at the request of French Royalists mounted a campaign against Saint-Domingue.&lt;ref name="WLC214"&gt;The Royal Navy. A History from the Earliest Times to 1900, William Clowes, Volume 4, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; On arrival Ford's squadron captured amongst other vessels a schooner belonging to the French Navy named ''Convention Nationale''.&lt;ref name="JJC216"&gt;Ships of the Royal Navy, Colledge, p.216&lt;/ref&gt; She was renamed {{HMS|Marie Antoinette|1793|6}} and Ford gave command of her to Perkins. Ford described Perkins as "an Officer of Zeal, Vigilance and Activity."&lt;ref name="LG13600"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=13600|date=10 December 1793|page=1096}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1794 ''Marie Antoinette'' made up part of the squadron commanded by the newly promoted Rear-Admiral Ford that accompanied [[Brigadier-General]] [[John Whyte (British Army officer)|John Whyte]] that briefly captured [[Port-au-Prince]]. At the time some forty five vessels lay in harbour and these were all made prizes.&lt;ref name="LG13684"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=13684|date=17 July 1794|pages=723–725}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1796 ''Marie Antoinette'' made up part of a small squadron that captured the schooner ''Charlotte'' and brig ''Sally''.&lt;ref name="LG15717"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15717|date= 7 July 1804|page=841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perkins remained with her until he was promoted master and commander.

===Promotion to commander===
The circumstances of his promotion are unrecorded, but in 1797 Admiral [[Hyde Parker (admiral)|Sir Hyde Parker]] promoted Perkins to commander of {{HMS|Drake|1779|6}},&lt;ref name="RW313"&gt;British Warships in the Age of Sail 1714–1792, Winfield, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JJC102"&gt;Ships of the Royal Navy, Colledge, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAK3"&gt;National Archives, Kew: ADM 36/14999 Admiralty: Royal Navy Ships' Musters (Series I) 1795 May – 1798 Aug HMS Drake&lt;/ref&gt; a [[brig]] of 14 guns. Subsequently, HMS ''Drake'', in company with a squadron under Captain [[Hugh Pigot (Royal Navy captain)|Hugh Pigot]], consisting of the 32-gun frigates {{HMS|Hermione|1782|6}} and {{HMS|Quebec|1781|6}}, and the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Penelope|1794|6}}, were involved in the cutting out of eight enemy ships at [[Port-de-Paix]] on 20 April 1797.&lt;ref name="WLC334"&gt;The Royal Navy. A History from the Earliest Times to 1900, William Clowes, p. 334, 335&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WJ2113"&gt;Naval History of Great Britain Vol. 2, James, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 October 1798 ''Drake'' captured the French [[privateer]] ''La Favorite''. The [[prize money]] for Perkins (amounting to 2/8 of the total value of the vessel) was 53 [[pounds sterling|pounds]] 13 [[shillings]] and 9 [[pence]].&lt;ref name="LG18729"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=18729|date= 24 September 1830|page=2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Archive visit 5 4 07 009.JPG|left|thumb|100px|The front page of the HMS ''Arab'' logbook 1800 from the National Archives, Kew]] In inflation-adjusted terms this would be approximately £{{Formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|53.69|1797|r=-2}}}} as of 20{{CURRENTYEARYY}}.{{Inflation-fn|UK}}

In ''Drake'', in company with {{HMS|Solebay|1785|2}}, Captain Poyntz, Perkins captured four French [[corvettes]], the 18-gun ''Egyptienne'', the 16-gun ''Eole'', the 12-gun ''Levrier'' and the 8-gun ''Vengeur'' on 24 November 1799 off Cape Tiburon.&lt;ref name="LG15872"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15872|date= 14 December 1805|page=1570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RW214"&gt;British Warships in the Age of Sail 1714–1792, Winfield, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotion to post-captain===
Perkins was promoted on 6 September 1800 to [[post-captain]]&lt;ref name="ISV5378"&gt;{{cite book|title=Naval chronology; or, An historical summary of naval &amp; maritime events, from the time of the Romans, to the Treaty of Peace, 1802| year=1802|author=Isaac Schomberg|publisher=C, Rowarth, Bell Lane, Fleet Street|url= https://archive.org/details/navalchronologyo05schoiala|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 32-gun frigate {{HMS|Meleager|1785|6}}.&lt;ref name="JJC222"&gt;Ships of the Royal Navy, Colledge, p.222&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1801 Perkins moved to the 22-gun {{HMS|Arab|1798|6}}.&lt;ref name="JJC18"&gt;Ships of the Royal Navy, Colledge, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:HMS Arab Privateer Experiment and Danish Brig Lougen 1801.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Battle of West Key 1801 courtesy of the [[National Maritime Museum]], Greenwich, London.]]

====Battle of West Key====
In March 1801, ''Arab'', in company with the 18-gun British privateer ''Experiment'', caught and challenged two Danish vessels, the [[brig]] {{HDMS|Lougen|1791|2}}, under the command of Captain [[Carl Wilhelm Jessen]], and the [[schooner]] ''Den Aarvaagne''.&lt;ref name="JEB1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navalhistory.dk/english/History/1801_1814/Lougen_WestKay_1801.htm |title=Battle of West Kay 1801 |author=Johnny Erik Balsved |date=17 February 2003 |work= |publisher=Copyright © 2009&amp;ndash;2011 Johnny E. Balsved |accessdate=30 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817175819/http://www.navalhistory.dk/english/history/1801_1814/Lougen_WestKay_1801.htm |archivedate=17 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Arab'' approached the two Danish vessels and, according to Danish accounts, without warning, fired several broadsides at ''Lougen'' before the Danish ship was able to return fire. ''Lougen'', which had escaped serious damage, began to return fire steadily. ''Experiment'' initially attempted to capture ''Aarvaagne'', but ''Aarvaagne'' obeyed orders to stay out of the fight and instead escaped south to [[Christiansted, United States Virgin Islands|Christiansted]] on [[Saint Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands|St Croix]] with its intelligence on British actions. ''Experiment'' then joined ''Arab'' in the attack on ''Lougen'', with the two British ships sandwiching the Danish ship. During the engagement, which lasted for over an hour, one of ''Lougen{{'}}''s shots struck the ''Arab{{'}}''s [[cathead]] and loosed the bower anchor. (Perkin's reported that it was the first shot from ''Lougen'' that loosed the bower anchor.) ''Arab{{'}}''s crew was unable to cut the anchor free, leaving ''Arab'' unable to manoeuvre effectively. This allowed Jessen to steer a course that brought him under the protection of the shore batteries and then into [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St Thomas]]. Captain Jessen of the ''Lougen'' was awarded a presentation sword made of gold, a medal and 400 [[rixdollar]]s (the equivalent of a whole year's salary for a Captain in the Danish Navy) by the Danish government for his actions.&lt;ref name="JEB1"/&gt;

On 13 April 1801 ''Arab'' captured the Spanish privateer ''Duenda''.&lt;ref name="LG16027"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=16027|date= 9 May 1807|page=621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capture of Saint Eustatia and Saba Islands===
On 16 April 1801 Perkins, in company with [[Colonel]] Richard Blunt and a detachment of the [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)]], laid siege to and captured the wealthy islands of [[Sint Eustatius]] and [[Saba]], capturing their French garrisons, forty-seven [[cannon]] and 338 barrels of [[gunpowder]].&lt;ref name="WLC471"&gt;The Royal Navy. A History from the Earliest Times to 1900, William Clowes, p. 471&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WJ3150"&gt;Naval History of Great Britain Vol. 3, James, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Eustatia had been the most profitable of the islands in the [[Dutch West Indies]].

After several further cruises Perkins was transferred in 1802 into the 32-gun frigate {{HMS|Tartar|1801|6}}.&lt;ref name="JJC345"&gt;Ships of the Royal Navy, Colledge, p.345&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
Between 20 November and 4 December 1803 ''Tartar'' was in company with Commodore [[John Loring (d. 1808)|John Loring's]] squadron when the squadron captured the French ships of war ''Le Decouverte'', [[French frigate Clorinde (1801)|''La Clorinde'']], [[French frigate Surveillante (1802)|''La Surveillante'']], ''La Vertu'', and ''Le Cerf''.&lt;ref name="LG15935"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15935|date= 8 July 1806|page=861}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Surveillante'' and ''La Clorinde'' were bought into British service. ''La Surveillante'' had on board at her surrender [[Donatien-Marie-Joseph de Vimeur, vicomte de Rochambeau|General Rochambeau]] the commander of the French forces on Saint-Domingue.&lt;ref name="LG15672"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15672|date= 4 February 1804|pages=165–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July 1804, while in company with {{HMS|Vanguard|1787|6}} under Captain [[James Walker (Royal Navy officer)|James Walker]], ''Tartar'' was involved in the capture of the French 74-gun ship of the line [[French ship Duquesne (1787)|''Duquesne'']], and two 16-gun brigs sailing with her. ''Tartar'' outsailed her larger companions and kept the ''Duquesne'' and her consorts engaged until the larger British ships came up and the French squadron surrendered.&lt;ref name="WJ3186"&gt;Naval History of Great Britain Vol. 3, James, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NAK2"&gt;National Archives, Kew: ADM 51/1447 Captains' logs Tartar 16 Apr 1802 – 30 Apr 1804&lt;/ref&gt; A seaman's share of the [[prize money]] aboard the ''Tartar'' for the capture was 6 [[shillings]] and 8 [[pence]]. A [[petty officer| petty officer's]] share was 1 [[Pound sterling|pound]], 13 [[shillings]] and 11 [[pence]].&lt;ref name="LG15889"&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15889|date= 11 February 1806|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final mission to Haiti==
In January 1804 [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines]], the commander of the slave rebellion in [[Haiti]] declared independence from France. Perkins was sent by Admiral [[John Thomas Duckworth|Duckworth]] and Governor [[Sir George Nugent, 1st Baronet|Nugent]] in ''Tartar'' as a British observer to the island. Perkins was accompanied by Edward Corbet. Corbet was a government advisor appointed by Nugent.&lt;ref name="LN"&gt;Lady Nugent's Journal of Her Residence in Jamaica from 1801 to 1805, Shepherd&lt;/ref&gt; Perkins described the situation on Haiti in his official letters to the Admiral. "I assure you that it is horrid to view the streets in different places stained with the Blood of these unfortunate people, whose bodies are now left exposed to view by the river and sea side. In hauling the seine the evening we came to our anchor several bodies got entangled in it, in fact such scenes of cruelty and devastation have been committed as is impossible to imagine or my pen describe."&lt;ref name="CKH140"&gt;Christophe: King of Haiti, Cole, pp. 140–143&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and death==
In March 1804 Perkins resigned his commission on health grounds. It is rumoured that Perkins finally visited England in 1805 although there is no supporting evidence for this. There is no further record of his involvement with the Navy or Haiti. Perkins died on 27 January 1812 at his home in Jamaica.&lt;ref name="NC27"/&gt; According to his obituary he suffered for many years with a condition described as "[[asthma]]" and that this was the cause of his demise.

There is no record of a wife and the records concerning his estate have disappeared.
 
His obituary in the Naval Chronicle described his actions while in command of the schooner ''Punch'': {{cquote|he annoyed the enemy more than any other officer, by his repeated feats of gallantry, and the immense number of prizes he took.&lt;ref name="NC27"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2316">'''John of Hexham''' (c. 1160–1209) was an [[England|English]] [[chronicler]], known to us merely as the author of a work called the ''Historia XXV. annorum'', which continues the ''[[Historia regum]]'' attributed to [[Symeon of Durham]], and contains an account of English events from 1130 to 1153.

From the title, as given in the only manuscript, we learn John's name and the fact that he was prior of [[Hexham Abbey|Hexham]]. It must have been between 1160 and 1209 that he held this position; but the date at which he lived and wrote cannot be more accurately determined. Up to the year 1139 he follows closely the history written by his predecessor, [[Richard of Hexham|Prior Richard]]; thenceforward he is an independent though not a very valuable authority. He is best informed as to the events of the north country; his want of care, when he ventures farther afield, may be illustrated by the fact that he places in 1145 King [[Stephen of England|Stephen's]] siege of [[Oxford]], which really occurred in 1142.

Even for northern affairs his chronology is faulty; from 1140 onwards his dates are uniformly one year too late. Prior Richard is not the only author to whom John is indebted; he incorporates in the annal of 1138 two other narratives of the [[Battle of the Standard]], one in verse by the monk [[Serlo of Wilton]],&lt;ref&gt;Jan Öberg (ed.). ''Serlon de Wilton: Poèmes latins''. Stockholm, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; another in prose by Abbot [[Aelred of Rievaulx]]; and also a poem, by a [[Glasgow]] clerk, on the death of [[Somerled]].

The one manuscript of John's chronicle is a late 12th-century copy; [[Cambridge, Corpus Christi College, MS 139]]. The best edition is that of Thomas Arnold in ''Symeonis monachi opera'', vol. 2 ([[Rolls Series]], 1885). There is an English translation in [[Joseph Stevenson]]'s ''Church Historians of England'', vol. 4 (London, 1856).

[[File:Juan Menéndez Pidal.jpg|thumb|175px|Juan Menéndez Pidal]]
'''Juan Menéndez Pidal''' (1858, [[Madrid]] &amp;ndash; 1915) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[archivist]], [[jurisconsult]], [[historian]], and [[poet]], brother of [[Luis Menéndez Pidal|Luis]] and [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal]].  He was long a director of the [[Archivo Histórico Nacional]] at Madrid, and a director of the ''Revista de Archivos, Bibliotecas, y Museos''.

Born in [[Madrid]], he studied law until he obtained his title, and then devoted himself to [[journalism]]. His ''Dios y César'', an [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] and legal study of the relation of church and state, attracted much attention.  In 1914 he was elected a member of the [[Real Academia Española|Spanish Royal Academy of the Language]].

'''Kirk Yetholm''' is a village in the [[Scottish Borders]] region of [[Scotland]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} south east of [[Kelso, Scotland|Kelso]] and less than {{convert|1|mi|km}} west of the [[Anglo-Scottish Border|border]]. The first mention is of its church in the 13th century.  Its sister town is [[Town Yetholm]] which lies half a mile across the [[Bowmont Water]].  The population of the two villages was recorded as 591 in the 2001 census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scrol.gov.uk/scrol/browser/profile.jsp?profile=Population&amp;mainLevel=Locality&amp;mainText=Kirk+Yetholm&amp;mainTextExplicitMatch=null&amp;compLevel=CountryProfile&amp;compText=&amp;compTextExplicitMatch=null Scotland's Census Result OnLine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322053807/http://www.scrol.gov.uk/scrol/browser/profile.jsp?profile=Population&amp;mainLevel=Locality&amp;mainText=Kirk+Yetholm&amp;mainTextExplicitMatch=null&amp;compLevel=CountryProfile&amp;compText=&amp;compTextExplicitMatch=null |date=2012-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The village is notable for being the northern terminus of the [[Pennine Way]], and to a lesser extent the southern terminus of the [[Scottish National Trail]]. The Border Hotel [[public house]] is the official end of the Pennine Way. 

Kirk Yetholm was for centuries the headquarters of the [[Romani people]] (Gypsies) in Scotland. The last king of the Gypsies was crowned in 1898 and the Gypsies have been integrated and are no longer a separate ethnic minority. A memorial stone can be found on the village green.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discovertheborders.co.uk/places/213.html The Gypsy Memorial, Kirk Yetholm, Scotland&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A song referring to Kirk Yetholm called ‘Yetholm Day’ was written and composed by Frankie Mallen of Kelso for the ‘Kelso Civic Week’ celebrations in 2008. It was later covered by local man Gary Cleghorn.

==Place-name meanings==
Yetholm means either:
* the goats' island from [[Old English]] ''gat'' '[[goat]]' and Old Norse ''holmr'' (island, ''holme'')
* village with a gate - from [[Old English]] ''geat-ham'' ‘gate village’

==Hostel==
In 1942 the village school building was converted into a [[Scottish Youth Hostels Association]] hostel. It now continues in use as an affiliate hostel named the Kirk Yetholm Friends of Nature House.  It provides accommodation for tourists, particularly walkers and cyclists, being located on [[St Cuthbert's Way]], the [[Pennine Way]], the [[Scottish National Trail]], the [[Sustrans]] [[National Cycle Route 1]] and Scottish Borders Loop.&lt;ref name="SYHA Hostelling Scotland"&gt;{{cite web | title=Kirk Yetholm | website=SYHA Hostelling Scotland | url=https://www.syha.org.uk/where-to-stay/lowlands/kirk-yetholm.aspx | accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lekhubu Island''' is a rock outcrop in [[Botswana]]. It is located in the Southern campus{{clarify|reason=what is meant here?|date=June 2017}} of the large natural topographic depression within the Makgadikgadi region of Botswana called the [[Sua Pan]], which is the largest pan in Botswana.&lt;ref name="Lekhubu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lekhubu Monument|url=http://www.gov.bw/en/Visitors/Topics/Monuments/Lekhubu/|website=Republic of Botswana, Government portal|publisher=Govt of Botswana|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;

==History==
Lekhubu is a rock outcrop which was covered with water of the tremendous [[Lake Makgadikgadi]], which is one of the largest lakes in Africa. Lekhubu means the rock outcrop.''Kubu'' is a Setswana name that refers to the [[hippopotamus]].

About 10,000 years ago, the Lake Makgadikgadidried up and only Lekhubu Island remained with a lot of salt in it. All this was caused by the climatic changes that took place many years ago. Initiation used to take place there and people were marked musing the stones called the cairns that made sure that people got initiated.{{clarify|reason=confusing sentence - "musing"?|date=June 2017}}

==Location==
Lekhubu is located in the Southern campus of the large natural topographic depression within the Makgadikgadi region of Botswana called the [[Sua Pan|Sua pan]], which is the largest pan in Botswana. Lekhubu site is off the track in between the  [[Gweta]] village, Nata and Letlhakane, therefore people who visit the site are encouraged to be in touch with the villagers to get more information on how to get there or visit the  [[Mmatshumo]] village and the veterinary gates. Mmatshumo is just 42km away from Lekhubu and roughly 100km away from Gweta village.

== Biography ==

Manfred Pohl was born on 26 May 1944 in the town of [[:de:Bliesransbach|Bliesransbach]], near [[Saarbrücken]] in the [[Saarland]] region of Germany.

In 1972 he was awarded a doctorate for his thesis on the history of banking in the [[Saarland]].

Between 1972 and 2001, Manfred Pohl led the Historical Institute of [[Deutsche Bank]]. From 1981 he lectured at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]], Germany, leading courses on Corporate History and Corporate Culture. In 1992 he was awarded an honorary professorship by the university's School of Finance.

In addition to his academic position and his work at Deutsche Bank, Manfred Pohl has founded numerous [[nonprofit organizations]] including ''[[eabh]]'' (The European Association for Banking and Financial History), founded in 1990, the [[Institute for Corporate Culture Affairs]], founded in 2001 and the Frankfurter Zukunftsrat, founded in 2008.

In 1998 he founded Europoint, which supported the introduction of the [[Euro]] currency in the twelve EU countries that originally adopted the currency in 1999/2001. Activities of note included the "Euro-World" project, a competition where over 1000 children suffering from cancer painted designs for the forthcoming Euro coins. Fourteen winning designs were purchased by the [[European Central Bank]], of which two remain on display at the Bank, with the other twelve being donated back to the hospitals of the children who created the designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Central Bank Annual Report 2000|url=http://www.ecb.eu/pub/pdf/annrep/ar2000en.pdf/|publisher=European Central Bank|accessdate=17 March 2011|page=xi|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Europoint also commissioned the illuminated Euro sign that stands outside the [[European Central Bank]] in Frankfurt. After Europoint was dissolved in 2002, ownership of the sign was transferred to the then newly formed Frankfurter Kultur Komitee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kultur im Fokus|url=http://www.frakk.de/frakk/kulturimfokus/|publisher=Frankfurter Kultur Komitee|accessdate=17 March 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manfred Pohl has written numerous histories of German companies and business ventures, among them [[Deutsche Bank]], [[Hochtief]] and [[Baghdad Railway|the Baghdad Railway]]. He has also authored and edited works on economic and social themes, especially related to [[corporate social responsibility]] and [[business history]] (see publications list below).

'''Maxine Hammond''' (born 1950), known professionally as '''Max Dashu''', is an American feminist historian, author and artist. Her areas of expertise include female [[iconography]], [[matriarchy|mother-right]] cultures and the origins of [[patriarchy]].

In 1970, Dashu founded the Suppressed Histories Archives to research and document women's history and to make the full spectrum of women's history and culture visible and accessible.&lt;ref name="love"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author-link= |editor-last= Love|editor-first= Barbara J.|editor-link= |encyclopedia= Feminists Who Changed America, 1963-1975|title= Max Dashu|trans-title= |url= |access-date= |language= |edition= |date= |year= 2006|publisher= University of Illinois Press|series= |volume= |location= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |pages= 108|quote= |ref=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WLW"&gt;Women Library Workers (1983), volume 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection includes 15,000 slides and 30,000 digital images.&lt;ref name="About Max Dashu"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.suppressedhistories.net/aboutmax.html|title= About Max Dashu|last= Dashu|first= Max|date= |website= Suppressed Histories Archive|publisher= |access-date= January 16, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="matrifocus1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.matrifocus.com/Bios/bio-mdashu.htm|title= Max Dashu|last= |first= |date= |website= MatriFocus|publisher= |access-date= January 16, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1970s, Dashu has delivered visual presentations on women's history throughout North America, Europe and Australia.&lt;ref name="About Max Dashu"/&gt;

Dashu is the author of ''Witches and Pagans: Women in European Folk Religion, 700–1100'' (2016), the first volume of a planned 16-volume series called ''Secret History of the Witches.''&lt;ref name="witches"&gt;{{cite book |last= Dashu|first= Max|date= 2016|title= Witches and Pagans: Women in European Folk Religion, 700-1100|url= |location= Richmond, CA|publisher= Veleda Press|page= |isbn=978-0-692-74028-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Dashu grew up in [[West Chicago, Illinois]]. In 1968, she earned a scholarship to [[Harvard University]], where she began her research in women's history.&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oob"/&gt; Facing "entrenched resistance" to feminist scholarship, she chose to leave the university to become an independent scholar.&lt;ref name="oob"&gt;{{cite magazine |last= Dashu|first= Max|date= 1 September 2003|volume = 33|issue= 9|title= Women's studies beyond academia|url= https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-109668699.html|magazine= off our backs|location= |publisher= |access-date= October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After founding the Suppressed Histories Archives in 1970, she began presenting on women's history in 1973, sharing slides of her research at feminist bookstores, cafe and women's centers.&lt;ref name="love"/&gt;&lt;ref name="l"&gt;{{cite book |last= Morris|first= Bonnie J.|date= July 29, 2016|title= The Disappearing L: Erasure of Lesbian Spaces and Culture|url= |location= |publisher= SUNY Press |page= 146|isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dashu's slide presentations offered visual history at a time when lesbian history and art was not easily accessible.&lt;ref name="out"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harper |first= Jorjet|editor-last= Baim|editor-first= Tracy|title= Out and Proud in Chicago: An Overview of the City's Gay Movement|publisher=Surrey Books |date=2008 |pages= 123|chapter= Lesbian Writers' Conferences: Sharing Words|isbn=9781572841000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Dashu was involved in the [[Inez García]] defense committee.&lt;ref name="love"/&gt; In the early 1980s, Dashu worked in the Household Workers' Rights organization,&lt;ref name="love"/&gt; a Union WAGE project established in 1979 for working women.&lt;ref name="OAC"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf3h4n99t9/entire_text/|title= Finding Aid to the Household Workers' Rights Records, 1982-1996|last= |first= |date= |website= Online Archive of California|publisher= |access-date= January 16, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wage"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://socialarchive.iath.virginia.edu/ark:/99166/w6qs07bn|title= Union WAGE (Organization)|last= |first= |date= |website= Social Networks and Archival Context|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Historian===
Dashu's decades-long work has focused on women's history around the world, including Europe, Asia and Africa.&lt;ref name="About Max Dashu"/&gt; Areas of focus include women [[shamanism|shamans]] and priestesses, witches and the witch trials, folk religion and pagan European traditions. Her work has cited evidence in support of egalitarian matrilineages, and she authored a critique of Cynthia Eller's ''[[The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory]]'' (2000). Her article ''Knocking Down Straw Dolls: A Critique of Cynthia Eller's The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory'' was reprinted in the journal ''Feminist Theology'' in 2005.&lt;ref name="About Max Dashu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eller"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.suppressedhistories.net/articles/strawdolls.html | title =Knocking Down Straw Dolls | last =Dashu | first =Max | date =2000 | website =Suppressed Histories Archives | access-date =March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sage"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Dashu| first = Max| date = January 2005| title = Knocking Down Straw Dolls: A Critique of Cynthia Eller's The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory| url  = http://fth.sagepub.com/content/13/2/185.extract| journal = Feminist Theology| publisher = SAGE Publications| volume = 13| issue = 2| pages = 185–216

The next volume, under the working title ''Pythias, Melissae and Pharmakides'',&lt;ref name="witches"/&gt; will focus on Greece.

Presenting materials from the Suppressed Histories Archives, Dashu has given talks at hundreds of universities, conferences and festivals around the world.

==History==
{{main|History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt}}

=== Under the monarchy ===
{{main|History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1928-1938)}}
The Muslim Brotherhood was founded in 1928 by [[Hassan al-Banna]], an Egyptian schoolteacher, who preached implementing traditional Islamic [[Sharia]] law in all aspects of life, from everyday problems to the organization of the government.&lt;ref name=Kuntzel&gt;Küntzel, 2002, pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Islamic reformers [[Muhammad Abduh]] and [[Rashid Rida]], he believed that Islam had lost its social dominance to corrupt Western influences and [[British Empire|British imperial rule]].
{{main|History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1939-1954)}}

The organisation initially focused on educational and charitable work, but quickly grew to become a major political force as well. (Sources disagree as to whether the Brotherhood was hostile to independent working-class and popular organisations,&lt;ref name="Kuntzel"/&gt; or supported efforts to create trades unions and unemployment benefits.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Modern Middle East,'' William Cleveland, p.200&lt;/ref&gt;) It championed the cause of poor Muslims, and played a prominent role in the Egyptian nationalist movement, fighting the British, Egypt's occupier/dominator. It engaged in espionage and sabotage, as well as support for terrorist activities orchestrated by [[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] in British Mandate Palestine, and up to and during World War II some association with Britain's enemy, the German Nazis,&lt;ref&gt;See: Ian Johnson, ''A Mosque in Munich: Nazis, the CIA and Rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in the West'' (New York: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2010);&lt;br&gt; Matthias Küntzel, ''Jihad and Jew-hatred: Islamism, Nazism and the Roots of 9/11''  (New York: Telos Press, 2007);&lt;br&gt; Klaus-Michael Mallmann and Martin Cüppers, ''Halbmond und Hakenkreuz: Das 'Dritte Reich', die Araber und Palästina'' (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 2006),&lt;br&gt; and Klaus Gensicke, ''Der Mufti von Jerusalem und die Nationalsocialisten: Eine politische Biographie Amin el-Husseinis'' (Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; dissemination of anti-Jewish, and anti-Western propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the studies listed in the previous note, see the detailed and richly documented analysis by Jeffrey Herf, ''Nazi Propaganda for the Arab World'' (New Haven, London: Yale University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, the Brotherhood spread to other Muslim countries, including Syria&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Yacoub Oweis [https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/06/us-syria-brotherhood-idUSBRE84504R20120506 "Syria's Muslim Brotherhood rise from the ashes,"] Reuters (6 May 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=29851 "Syria Muslim Brotherhood Issues Post-Assad State-for-All Commitment Charter,"] ikhwanweb.com (The Muslim Brotherhood's Official English web site) (7 April 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Jordan, Tunisia, etc. as well as countries where Muslims are in the minority. These groups are sometimes described as "very loosely affiliated" with the Egyptian branch and each other.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/syrias-muslim-brotherhood-is-gaining-influence-over-anti-assad-revolt/2012/05/12/gIQAtIoJLU_story.html Syria's Muslim Brotherhood is gaining influence over anti-Assad revolt] [[Liz Sly]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 12 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1948, following several bombings and assassination attempts, the government arrested 32 leaders of the Brotherhood's "secret apparatus" and banned the Brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;Chamieh, Jebran, Traditionalists, Militants and Liberal in Present Islam, Research and Publishing House, [1994?], p.140&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the Brotherhood was estimated to have 2000 branches and 500,000 members or sympathizers.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robin, ''Sacred Rage'' 1985, p.179&lt;/ref&gt; In succeeding months Egypt's prime minister was assassinated by Brotherhood member, and following that Al-Banna himself was assassinated in what is thought to be a cycle of retaliation.

In 1952, members of the Muslim Brotherhood are accused of taking part in an event that marked the end of Egypt's "liberal, progressive, cosmopolitan" era – an arson [[Cairo Fire|fire]] that destroyed some "750 buildings" in downtown Cairo – mainly night clubs, theatres, hotels, and restaurants frequented by British and other foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/02/080602fa_fact_wright?currentPage=all "The Rebellion Within, An Al Qaeda mastermind questions terrorism. by Lawrence Wright"]. ''The New Yorker'', 2 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===After the 1952 revolution===
{{main|History of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt (1954-present)}}
In 1952 the monarchy was [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|overthrown]] by nationalist military officers of the [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers Movement]]. While the Brotherhood supported the coup it vigorously opposed the secularist constitution that the coup leaders were developing. In 1954 another unsuccessful assassination was attempted against Egypt's prime minister ([[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]), and blamed on the "secret apparatus" of the Brotherhood. The Brotherhood was again banned and this time thousands of its members were imprisoned, many of them held for years in prisons and sometimes tortured.

One of them was the very influential theorist, [[Sayyid Qutb]], who before being executed in 1966, issued a [[Ma'alim fi al-Tariq|manifesto]] proclaiming that Muslim society had become ''[[jahiliyya]]'' (no longer Islamic) and that Islam must be restored by the overthrow of Muslim states by an Islamic vanguard, also revitalising the ideal of Islamic universalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mura|first=Andrea |year=2014|title=[https://www.academia.edu/5611020/The_Inclusive_Dynamics_of_Islamic_Universalism_From_the_Vantage_Point_of_Sayyid_Qutbs_Critical_Philosophy The Inclusive Dynamics of Islamic Universalism: From the Vantage Point of Sayyid Qutb's Critical Philosophy]|journal=Comparative Philosophy|volume=5 |issue=1|pages=29–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Qutbism|Qutb's ideology]] became very influential outside of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, but the Brotherhood's leadership distanced itself from Qutb and adhered to nonviolent [[reformist]] posture.

Imprisoned Brothers were gradually released after [[Anwar Sadat]] became president of Egypt in 1970, and were sometimes enlisted to help fight Sadat's leftist opposition. Brethren were allowed to publish the magazine Da'wa, though the organization remained illegal. During this time, more radical Qutb-inspired Islamist groups blossomed, and after Sadat signed a peace agreement with [[Israel]] in 1979, the Muslim Brotherhood became confirmed enemies of Sadat. Sadat was assassinated by a violent Islamist group [[Tanzim al-Jihad]] on 6 October 1981, shortly after he had Brotherhood leaders (and many other opposition leaders) arrested.

===Mubarak era===
Again with a new president, ([[Hosni Mubarak]]), Brotherhood leaders (Supreme Guide [[Umar al-Tilmisani]] and others) were released from prison. Mubarak cracked down hard against radical Islamists but offered an "olive branch" to the more moderate Brethren. The brethren reciprocated, going so far as to endorse Mubarak's candidacy for president in 1987.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;[http://hir.harvard.edu/perspectives-on-the-united-states/egypt-s-muslim-brotherhood  John Walsh. Harvard International Review: Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood.] Perspectives on the United States, Vol. 24 (4) Winter 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brotherhood dominated the professional and student associations of Egypt and was famous for its network of social services in neighborhoods and villages.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; However, the government did not approve of the Brotherhood's renewed influence (it was still technically illegal), and resorted to repressive measures starting in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Francis|title=The Islamic world in the age of western dominance|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-83826-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2000|2000 parliamentary elections]], the Muslim Brotherhood won 17 parliamentary seats.&lt;ref&gt;Shenker, Jack; Whitaker, Brian (8 February 2011). [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/08/egypt-muslim-brotherhood-uncovered "The Muslim Brotherhood uncovered"]. ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2005|2005]], it won 88 seats (20% of the total compared to 14 seats for the legally approved opposition parties) to form the largest opposition bloc, despite the arrest of hundreds of Brotherhood members. It lost almost all but one of these seats in the much-less-free [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2010|2010 election]], which was marred by massive arrests of both Brethren and polling place observers.&lt;ref&gt;Bayoumi, Alaa (29 November 2010).

Al Jazeera.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Egypt's emergency law Brethren could only stand as independents, but were easily identified since they campaigned under the slogan – 'Islam Is the Solution'.&lt;ref&gt;''Inside Egypt: The Land of the Pharaohs on the Brink of a Revolution'' by John R. Bradley, Palgrave MacMillan, 2008, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after the 2005 election the Brethren launched what some have called a "charm offensive." Its leadership talked about its "responsibility to lead reform and change in Egypt." It addressed the `[[Persecution of Copts#Modern era|Coptic]] issue', insinuating that the Brethren would do away with Egypt's decades-old church [[Persecution of Copts#Modern era|building-permit system]] that Coptic Christians felt was discriminatory.&lt;ref name=Osman.p101&gt;Osman, Tarek, ''Egypt on the Brink'', (Yale University Press, 2010) p.101&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally the Brethren launched an English-language website and some of the Muslim Brotherhood's leaders participated in an Initiative to 'Re-Introduc[e] the Brotherhood to the West', "listing and addressing many 'Western misconceptions about the Brotherhood.'"&lt;ref name=Osman.p101/&gt;

Seeing this campaign as a direct threat to its position as an indispensable ally of the west against radical Islamism, the Egyptian government introduced an amendment to the constitution that removed the reference to Islam as 'the religion of the state,` and would have allowed women and Christians to run for the presidency. Brotherhood MPs responded by walking out of parliament rather than voting on the bill.&lt;ref name=Osman.p102&gt;Osman, Tarek, ''Egypt on the Brink'', (Yale University Press, 2010) p.102&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the movement has also reportedly played into the government's hands provoking non-Islamist Egyptians by staging a militia-style march by masked Brotherhood students at Cairo's Al Azhar University,&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;YAROSLAV TROFIMOV.

According to another observer: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;after a number of conciliatory engagements and interactions with the West", the Brotherhood retreated into its comfort zone of inflammatory rhetoric intended for local consumption: all suicide bombers are `martyrs`; `Israel` regularly became `the Jews`; even its theological discourse became more confrontational and oriented to social conservatism.&lt;ref name=Osman.p113&gt;Osman, Tarek, ''Egypt on the Brink'', (Yale University Press, 2010) p.113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two years later the Egyptian government amended the constitution, skewing future representation against independent candidates for parliament, which are the only candidates the Brotherhood can field. The state delayed local council elections from 2006 to 2008, disqualifying most Muslim Brotherhood candidates. The Muslim Brotherhood boycotted the election. The government incarcerated thousands of rank-and-file Muslim Brotherhood members in a wave of arrests and military trials, the harshest such security clampdown on the Brotherhood "in decades." &lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

Egyptian author Ezzedine C. Fishere worried that the Brotherhood had 

&lt;blockquote&gt;managed to alienate its revolutionary and democratic partners and to scare important segments of society, especially women and Christians. Neither the Brotherhood nor the generals showed willingness to share power and both were keen on marginalising the revolutionary and democratic forces. It is as if they were clearing the stage for their eventual showdown.&lt;ref name=Fishere&gt;{{cite web|last=Fishere|first=Ezzedine C.|date=18 June 2012|title=Egypt's soft coup is following my dispiriting script|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c2270c32-b86e-11e1-a2d6-00144feabdc0.html|website=Financial Times|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In late November 2012, he issued a temporary constitutional declaration granting himself the power to [[legislate]] without judicial oversight or review of his acts, on the grounds that he needed to "protect" the nation from the Mubarak-era power structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hendawi|first=Hamza |url=http://www.salon.com/2012/11/28/egyptian_courts_suspend_work_to_protest_morsi_decrees/singleton/|title=Egyptian courts suspend work to protest Morsi decrees|newspaper=Salon|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://mideast.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2012/11/28/power_grab_on_egypts_unions|title=Egyptian Labor between Morsi and Mubarak|author=Dina Bishara|publisher=Foreign Policy|date=28 November 2012|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also put a draft constitution to a referendum that opponents complained was "an Islamist coup."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=El Rashidi|first=Yasmine|title=Egypt: The Rule of the Brotherhood|journal=New York Review|date=7 February 2013|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/feb/07/egypt-rule-brotherhood/?pagination=false|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These issues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's Mursi annuls controversial decree, opposition says not enough|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/12/09/254059.html|accessdate=9 December 2012|newspaper=Al Arabiya|date=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;—and concerns over the prosecutions of journalists, the unleashing of pro-Brotherhood gangs on nonviolent demonstrators; the continuation of military trials; and new laws that permitted detention without judicial review for up to 30 days,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams,|first=Daniel|title=Muslim Brotherhood abuses continue under Egypt's military|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-15/opinions/41412548_1_muslim-brotherhood-human-rights-watch-military-trials|accessdate=22 August 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and impunity given to Islamist radical attacks on Christians and other minorities&lt;ref name=misunderstood&gt;{{cite journal|last=El Rashidi|first=Yasmine|title=Egypt: The Misunderstood Agony|journal=New York Review|date=26 September 2013|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/sep/26/egypt-misunderstood-agony/?pagination=false|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;—brought hundreds of thousands of [[2012–13 Egyptian protests|protesters]] to the streets starting in November 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David D.

By April 2013, Egypt had "become increasingly divided" between President Mohamed Morsi and "Islamist allies" and an opposition of "moderate Muslims, Christians and liberals".

===After the July 2013 overthrow of Mohamed Morsi===

On 3 July, the head of the Egyptian Armed Forces, General [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]] responded to the demands of the protesters in Tahrir Square during the 30 June Demonstration and after discussing the issue with the main political parties and religious leaders of the country and removed President Mohamed Morsi and suspended  the constitution. Brotherhood supporters staged sit-ins throughout the country, setting up camps and shutting down traffic.

The crackdown that followed has been called the worst for the Brotherhood's organization "in eight decades".&lt;ref name=run/&gt; On 14 August, the military declared a month-long state of emergency in response to their violence after removing the camps. In retaliation Brotherhood supporters looted and burned police stations and dozens of churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Allam|first=Hisham|title=As Egypt Smoulders, Churches Burn|url=http://original.antiwar.com/hisham-allam/2013/08/20/as-egypt-smoulders-churches-burn/|website=Inter Press Service|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sit-in dispersal lead to clashes, resulting in the deaths of 638 people and injury of some 4000.&lt;ref name="ahram1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/79160/Egypt/Politics-/Death-toll-from-Egypt-violence-rises-to--Health-mi.aspx|title=Death toll from Egypt violence rises to 638: Health ministry|newspaper=Al-Ahram|date=15 August 2013|accessdate=19 August 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz59yzxP|archivedate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/16/world/middleeast/egypt.html|title=Islamists Debate Their Next Move in Tense Cairo|author =Kirkpatrick, David D.|newspaper=The New York Times|date=15 August 2013|accessdate=19 August 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Iz5NjzyN|archivedate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 19 August, [[al Jazeera]] reported that "most" of the Brotherhood's leaders were in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More top Brotherhood members arrested by Egypt prosecutors|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/75681/Egypt/Politics-/More-top-Brotherhood-members-arrested-by-Egypt-pro.aspx|publisher=Ahram Online|accessdate=4 July 2013|date=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt police arrest top Brotherhood leaders |url=http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Egypt-police-arrest-top-Brotherhood-leaders-318651|website=The Jerusalem Post|accessdate=4 July 2013|date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that day Supreme Leader Mohammed Badie was arrested,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egyptian military police arrest Brotherhood supreme guide|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/egyptian-military-police-arrest-brotherhood-supreme-guide|publisher=Egypt Independent|accessdate=4 July 2013|date=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; crossing a "red line", as even [[Hosni Mubarak]] had never arrested him.&lt;ref name=badie&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt arrests Muslim Brotherhood's top leader|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2013/08/2013819235957279126.html|website=20 August 2013|accessdate=25 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some question whether the military and security services can effectively crush the Brotherhood. Unlike the last major crackdown in the 1950s, when Egypt's "public sphere and information space" was tightly-controlled, the Brotherhood has a larger and broader international presence beyond the reach of Egypt's government to sustain itself.&lt;ref name=amro&gt;{{cite web|last=Ali|first=Amro|title=Not My Brotherhood's Keeper: The Fallacy of Crushing Egypt's Chief Islamist Group|url=http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/egyptsource/not-my-brotherhood-s-keeper-the-fallacy-of-crushing-egypt-s-chief-islamist-group|website=October 01, 2013|publisher=Atlantic Council|accessdate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others—such as Hussein Ibish and journalist [[Peter Hessler]]—believe its "unlikely" that the Brotherhood will return to political prominence soon, because of its aggressive but incompetent performance while in power.&lt;ref name=Hessler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ibish3/&gt;  According to Hessler, the group antagonized the powerful entrenched government institutions, the news media and millions of non-supporters, acting "with just enough aggression to provoke an outsized response", while not having nearly enough military resources to defend itself against that response.&lt;ref name=Hessler&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hessler|first=Peter|title=Keeping the Faith|journal=New Yorker|date=7 October 2013|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/10/07/131007fa_fact_hessler|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It "no longer leads the anti-government movement," and has even lost its "religious credibility", such that "at mosques, even staunch opponents of the coup told me that they wouldn't vote for the Brotherhood again."&lt;ref name=Hessler/&gt; Hessler also argues that "the strong showing for the party in post-revolution elections exaggerated MB strength, noting that in one Upper Egytpian district ([[El-Balyana]]), the MB party had dominated the Presidential vote and nearly won a parliamentary seat, but the Brotherhood itself had only ten local members in a district of approximately six hundred thousand. Since then its support has declined drastically.".&lt;ref name=NYER-7-March-2016&gt;{{cite journal |journal=New Yorker |date=7 March 2016 |last1=Hessler |first1=Peter |title=Letter from El-Balyana |accessdate=21 March 2016 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/03/07/egypts-singular-stay-at-home-campaigns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hussein Ibish believes the Brotherhood is being challenged by the [[Salafi]] movement, and is undergoing a crisis so severe that "what ultimately emerges from the current wreckage [may] be unrecognisably different" from the traditional Brotherhood.&lt;ref name=Ibish3&gt;{{cite web|last=Ibish|first=Hussein|title=Is this the end of the failed Muslim Brotherhood project?|url=http://www.thenational.ae/thenationalconversation/comment/is-this-the-end-of-the-failed-muslim-brotherhood-project|website=October 5, 2013|publisher=The National|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division===
In 2015, a split appeared in the Brotherhood between an old guard afraid that resorting to violence could mean the annihilation of the Brotherhood, and a new leadership, joined by the rank and file, that believed that "only by bleeding" the regime could it "be brought to its knees."&lt;ref name="EAR-2015"/&gt; 
In May, Mahmoud Hussein, the (former) secretary general of the Muslim Brotherhood, reported on his Facebook page that Mahmoud Ezzat had "taken over" the Muslim Brotherhood. On the official Brotherhood website a spokesperson replied: "We affirm that the group's institutions, which was elected by its base last February, manages its affairs and that only the official spokesman of the group and its official outlets represent the group and its opinion."&lt;ref name="EAR-2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tadros|first1=Samuel|title=The Muslim Brotherhood Divided – Analysis|journal=Eurasia Review|date=20 August 2015|issn=2330-717X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observers attribute the dispute to a number of factors. Robert Worth notes the disastrous situation into which the old leadership had led the MB, the disruption of the MB hierarchy by the "decapitation" of the leadership through arrests and imprisonment, and the dislocation of exile (often to Turkey and Qatar) of much of the rank and file.&lt;ref name=worth-166-9&gt;{{cite book|last1=Worth|first1=Robert F.|title=A Rage for Order: The Middle East in Turmoil, from Tahrir Square to ISIS|date=2016|publisher=Pan Macmillan |pages=166–9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PNOLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP7&amp;dq=rage+for+order+worth#v=onepage&amp;q=rage%20for%20order%20worth&amp;f=false |accessdate=31 July 2016|ref=RFWRfO2016|isbn=9780374710712}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Samuel Tadros credits changes in the MB to the influence of Revolutionary Salafists, many of whom allied with the Brotherhood in the year before the As-Sisi coup. When Islamists broke through security barriers to join the Brotherhood at Nahda and Rab'a squares, "ideas flowed freely and bonds were created", with the Salafists influencing MB more than vice versa.&lt;ref name="EAR-2015"/&gt; Salafist joined the anti-coup alliance of the MB, and its youth moved from using molotov cocktails in self-defense to offense. The MB structure broken, young members are now influenced by "[[takfiri]] sheikhs" on satellite channels.&lt;ref name="EAR-2015"/&gt;

Members blamed President Morsi not for alienating non-members with his non-inclusive rule, but for being insufficiently revolutionary and not crushing the state institutions that would later overthrow him. The slogan, "Our peacefulness is stronger than bullets," has been replaced by "All that is below bullets is peacefulness."&lt;ref name="EAR-2015"/&gt; A new body, the Administrative Office for Egyptians Abroad, clashed with the Old Guard of  Ibrahim Mounir, Deputy Supreme Guide Mahmoud Ghozlan and others.

At the same time as the split,&lt;ref name="EAR-2015"/&gt; a statement titled ''Nidaa al-Kinana'' (Egypt Call) signed by 159 international MB and Egyptian Salafist Islamic scholars and endorsed by the Brotherhood was released.&lt;ref name="memri-17-6-2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pro-Muslim Brotherhood Clerics Call To Overthrow Al-Sisi Regime In Egypt, Restore Mursi To Presidency|url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/63/0/8612.htm|website=MEMRI|accessdate=13 October 2016|date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It declared the As-Sisi regime criminal and murderous and stated that the current regime was an enemy of Islam, and it was the religious duty of Muslims to "eliminate it by all legitimate means. ...

In June 2015, the "Revolutionary Punishment" movement celebrated six months of attacks, including the killing of 157  and wounding of 452 security personal, the destruction of 162 military cars and 53 buildings.&lt;ref&gt;"The Harvest of Punishment … What is coming is more sour," el3qab.wordpress.com, 14 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==

===Stated platform and goals===
The Brotherhood itself describes the "principles of the Muslim Brotherhood" as including firstly the introduction of the Islamic [[Sharia]] as "the basis controlling the affairs of state and society;" and secondly work to unify "Islamic countries and states, mainly among the Arab states, and liberating them from foreign [[imperialism]]". It denounces the "catchy and effective terms and phrases" like "[[Islamic fundamentalism|fundamentalist]]" and "[[Islamism|political Islam]]" which it claims are used by "Western Media" to pigeonhole the group, and points to its "15 Principles" for an Egyptian National Charter, including "freedom of personal conviction... opinion... forming political parties... public gatherings... free and fair elections..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=813|title=The Principles of The Muslim Brotherhood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, the Muslim Brotherhood issued a detailed political platform. Amongst other things it called for a board of Muslim clerics to oversee the government, and for limiting the office of the presidency to Muslim men. In the 'Issues and Problems' chapter of the platform, it declared that a woman was not suited to be president because the post's religious and military duties 'conflict with her nature, social and other humanitarian roles.'   While underlining 'equality between men and women in terms of their human dignity,` the document warned against 'burdening women with duties against their nature or role in the family.'&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, John R., ''Inside Egypt'', Palgrave MacMillan, (p.65)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political strategy===
In his writing, Hassan Al-Banna outlined a strategy for achieving power of three stages: 
* the initial propaganda stage (preparation),
* the organization stage (in which the people would be educated by the Muslim Brotherhood), and
* finally, the action stage (where power would be taken or seized).&lt;ref&gt;''Inside Egypt: The Land of the Pharaohs on the Brink of a Revolution'' by John R. Bradley, Palgrave MacMillan, 2008, p.229&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political viewpoints===
The Brotherhood's self-description as moderate and rejecting violence has created disagreement among observers.&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/05/egypts-muslim-brotherhood-sticks-with-bin-laden/238218/ Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood Sticks With Bin Laden]. ''The Atlantic''. 3 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Political moderation is a contested concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Faith in Moderation: Islamist Parties in Jordan and Yemen|last=Schwedler|first=Jillian|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780521851138|location=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and various authors have a put forth a range of opinions on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsourapas|first=Gerasimos|year=2013|title=A Review of Mariz Tadros, The Muslim Brotherhood in contemporary Egypt: democracy redefined or confined?, (London: Routledge, 2012), pp. 196|url=https://www.soas.ac.uk/research/rsa/journalofgraduateresearch/edition-5/file84478.pdf|journal=Polyvocia, the SOAS Journal of Graduate Research|volume=5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, this is a question of using violence or not: a Western author, (Eric Trager), interviewing 30 current and former members of the Brotherhood in 2011 and found that the Brethren he talked to emphasised "important exceptions" to the position of non-violence, namely conflicts in [[Afghanistan]], [[Bosnia]], [[Chechnya]], [[Iraq]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].&lt;ref name=Trager/&gt; Trager quotes the former Supreme Guide [[Mohammed Mahdi Akef]] as telling him 

&lt;blockquote&gt;We believe that [[Zionism]], the United States, and England are gangs that kill children and women and men and destroy houses and fields. .... Zionism is a gang, not a country. So we will resist them until they don't have a country.&lt;ref name=Trager/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Trager and other have also noted the MB's use of the honorific "[[sheikh]]" to refer to [[Osama bin Laden]].&lt;ref name=Trager/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/on-bin-laden-muslim-brotherhood-makes-different-statements-in-english-and-in-arabic/ On Bin Laden, Muslim Brotherhood Makes Different Statements in English and in Arabic], 2 May 2011, Sami al-Abasi&lt;/ref&gt; While the Brotherhood differs with bin Laden and [[al-Qaeda]], it has not condemned them for the [[September 11 attacks|9-11]] attacks because it does not believe they were responsible. A recent statement by the Brotherhood on the issue of violence and assassinations condemned the killing of "Sheikh Osama bin Laden" by the United States, saying: "The whole world, and especially the Muslims, have lived with a fierce media campaign to brand Islam as terrorism and describe the Muslims as violent by blaming the September 11th incident on al-Qaeda."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt;

Al-Qaeda was supported by Mohammed Mahdi Akef, the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood and Osama Bin Laden was praised by Akef.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=عبد الرحيم|first=محمود|date=23 May 2008 |title=عاكف: أسامة بن لادن مجاهد لا أشك في صدقه |url=http://elaph.com/ElaphWeb/AkhbarKhasa/2008/5/332823.htm |newspaper=Elaph |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=|first=|date=25 May 2008 |title=THE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD |url=http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim_Brotherhood.pdf |website=www.investigativeproject.org|publisher=Investigative Project on Terrorism|location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to authors writing in the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] magazine [[Foreign Affairs]]:  "At various times in its history, the group has used or supported violence and has been repeatedly banned in Egypt for attempting to overthrow Cairo's secular government. Since the 1970s, however, the Egyptian Brotherhood has disavowed violence and sought to participate in Egyptian politics."&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/9248/|title=Does the Muslim Brotherhood Have Ties to Terrorism|last=Crane|first=Mary|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Bowen, [[BBC]] Middle East editor, calls the Brotherhood "conservative and non-violent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12325128|publisher=BBC News|title=Egypt unrest: What if Mubarak goes?|date=31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Israeli-affiliated media-watchdog group [[Memri]], the Arabic language (but not the English language) website of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood has displayed much anti-Semitic and anti-Israel content. A report by Memri found articles engaging in [[Holocaust denial]], praising [[jihad]] and martyrdom, condemning the [[Camp David Accords|Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty]], calling for the destruction of Israel, and condemning negotiations with non-Muslims to regain lands lost by Islam. A "common motif" of the website is [[Antisemitic conspiracy theories]] warning Muslims against "the covetous and exploitative nature of the 'Jewish character'".&lt;ref name="Rife with"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=254240|title=Muslim Brotherhood site rife with anti-Semitism|website=The Jerusalem Post|date=19 January 2012|accessdate=29 September 2012|author=Kessler, Oren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2013, the Muslim Brotherhood released a statement opposing the UN declaration 'End Violence against Women' on the grounds that it would "undermine Islamic ethics and destroy the family", and "would lead to complete disintegration of society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=30731|title=Muslim Muslim Brotherhood Statement Denouncing UN Women Declaration for Violating Sharia Principles|publisher=Ikhwan Web|date=13 March 2013|accessdate=19 March 2013|author=Muslim Brotherhood}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/15/muslim-brotherhood-backlash-un-womens-rights|title=Muslim Brotherhood backlash against UN declaration on women rights|website=The Guardian| date=15 March 2013|accessdate=19 March 2013|author=Patrick Kingsley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Secret of the Temple'', written by Tharwat al-Khirbawy, a former member of the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt, Khirbawy  "explores the ideology of Mursi and the small group of leaders at the top of the movement, examining their devotion to [[Sayyid Qutb]], a radical ideologue executed in 1966 for plotting to kill president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]."&lt;ref name="book zyawya"&gt;{{cite web|last=Saleh|first=Yasmine|title=Egypt book blasts Brotherhood, becomes best-seller|url=http://www.zawya.com/story/Egypt_book_blasts_Brotherhood_becomes_bestseller-TR20130305nL6N0BTAU62/|publisher=Zawya|accessdate=21 March 2013|author2=Tom Perry|date=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been "dismissed by Brotherhood leaders as part of a smear campaign."&lt;ref name="book zyawya"/&gt;

===Relations with non-Muslims===
Talking to television channel [[France 24]] shortly before he was elected president, Mohammed Morsi stated: "The majority of the people are Muslims and the non-Muslims, our brothers, are citizens with full responsibilities and rights and there is no difference between them. If any Muslim says anything other than this, he is not understanding Sharia."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20110616-interview-mohammed-morsy-president-freedom-justice-party-egypt-elections-muslim-brotherwood Interview. Dr. Mohammed Morsy, president of Egypt's 'Freedom and Justice' party], France 24, 19 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after he became president critics complained that attitudes of and actions by Brotherhood leaders concerning non-Muslims changed. In late April 2013 a [[fatwa]] issued by a member of the MB general guide's office -- 'Abd Al-Rahman Al-Barr (who is often referred to as the movement's mufti) -- forbade Muslims from greeting Christians on their [[Easter]] holiday,&lt;ref&gt;It also noted some Salafi leaders forbade Muslims to greet Christians on any Christian holiday, but that the Egyptian Muslim establishment opposed these fatwas and stated greetings were allowed.&lt;/ref&gt; explaining that Easter and resurrection were contrary to the Muslim faith. "Jesus did not die and was not crucified, but rather Allah gave him protection from the Jews and raised [Jesus] up to Him... which is why we do not greet anyone for something we strongly believe is wrong. ..."&lt;ref name=greeting/&gt; The Israeli-affiliated media-watchdog group Memri quoted Coptic and opposition leaders attacking the fatwa and noting that in the past MB leaders and even Al-Barr himself had not only allowed but practiced the greeting of Christians on Easter. Columnist A'la Al-'Aribi in the daily [[Al-Wafd]] attacked the fatwa as "politics disguised as shari'a..." Al-Barr's previous "view reflected the position of the MB at that time – but now that circumstances have changed [and the MB is in power], he has changed his position..."&lt;ref name=greeting&gt;{{cite web|title=In Advance of Orthodox Easter in Egypt, Muslim Brotherhood And Salafis Issue Fatwas Forbidding Greeting Copts on Their Holidays|url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/7165.htm|date=3 May 2013|publisher=MEMRI|accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another article in newsobserver.com noted President and former MB official [[Mohammed Morsi]] "has done little to assuage concerns" of Christians by being "slow to condemn the latest round of sectarian violence" in April 2013, not attend the naming of the [[Pope Tawadros II of Alexandria|new Coptic pope]], and having no plans to attend Coptic Easter services – an annual custom of the [[Hosni Mubarak|former Egyptian President]].&lt;ref name=debate&gt;{{cite news|last=Youssef|first=Nancy A.|title=Debate over Easter greetings roil Egypt's sensitive religious tension|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/05/03/2868697/debate-over-easter-greetings-roil.html|accessdate=4 May 2013|newspaper=News Observer|date=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, following the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|3 July 2013 Coup]] and clashes between the military and Morsi supporters, there were [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état#Violence against Coptic Christians|widespread attacks]] on Christian Coptic churches and institutions. ''[[USA Today]]'' reported that "forty churches have been looted and torched, while 23 others have been attacked and heavily damaged". The Facebook page of the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party was "rife with false accusations meant to foment hatred against Copts", according to journalist Kirsten Powers. The party's page claimed that the Church had declared "war against Islam and Muslims". Despite the Christians relatively minor role in the campaign against President Morsi, the page justified the attacks by saying: "After all this people ask why they burn the churches." Later it posted: "For every action there is a reaction" and "The Pope of the Church is involved in the removal of the first elected Islamist president. The Pope of the Church alleges Islamic Sharia is backwards, stubborn, and reactionary."&lt;ref name=helwan&gt;{{cite web|title=FJP Helwan Facebook page on church attacks|url=http://mbinenglish.wordpress.com/2013/08/16/fjp-helwan-facebook-page-on-church-attacks/| date=16 August 2013|publisher=mbinenglish|accessdate=22 August 2013}}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MB-war&gt;{{cite web|last=Powers|first=Kirsten|title=The Muslim Brotherhood's War on Coptic Christians|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/22/the-muslim-brotherhood-s-war-on-coptic-christians.html|website=The Daily Beast| date=22 Aug 2013|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egyptianstreets.com/2013/08/16/coptic-churches-burn-amid-violence-in-egypt/|title=Coptic churches burn amid violence in Egypt &amp;#124; Egyptian Streets شوارع مصر |publisher=Egyptianstreets.com|date=16 August 2013|accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 15 August, nine Egyptian human rights groups under the umbrella group "Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights", released a statement saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;In December … Brotherhood leaders began fomenting anti-Christian sectarian incitement. The anti-Coptic incitement and threats continued unabated up to the demonstrations of June 30 and, with the removal of President Morsi … morphed into sectarian violence, which was sanctioned by … the continued anti-Coptic rhetoric heard from the group's leaders on the stage … throughout the sit-in.&lt;ref name=MB-war/&gt;&lt;ref name=personal&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Press Release: Non-peaceful assembly does not justify collective punishment – Rights groups condemn lethal violence against those in sit-in and terrorist acts of the Muslim Brotherhood|url=http://eipr.org/en/pressrelease/2013/08/15/1782|website=15 August 2013|publisher=Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights|accessdate=22 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Organization ==
The Brotherhood applies a highly selective membership process which gives its "internal cohesiveness and ideological rigidity" and is unique among Egyptian political/social organizations in its "breadth" and "depth" of networks.&lt;ref name=Trager/&gt; The long (typically at least four and a half years) and closely monitored membership process is thought to have prevented infiltration by state security during the presidencies of [[Sadat era|Anwar Sadat]] and [[Mubarak era|Hosni Mubarak]].&lt;ref name=Trager/&gt; Its structure bears some similarity to a similar Islamist party, [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]], in having a hierarchical organization where many supporters do not reach the level of full members. Potential members are recruited by recruiters who do not at first identify themselves as Brothers to prospective members.

Estimates of the Brotherhood's membership and supporters vary between 600,000 and 100,000. According to anthropologist [[Scott Atran]], while the Brotherhood has 600,000 dues paying members in Egypt it can count on only 100,000 militants in a population of more than 80&amp;nbsp;million Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/opinion/03atran.html|title=Egypt's Bumbling Brotherhood | work=The New York Times | first=Scott|last=Atran|date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' describes it as having drawing on "support from hundreds of thousands of members and millions of affiliates and sympathizers throughout" Egypt.&lt;ref name=FAHIM&gt;{{cite news|last=FAHIM|first=KAREEM|title=The Muslim Brotherhood, Back in a Fight to Survive|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/06/world/middleeast/the-muslim-brotherhood-back-in-a-fight-to-survive.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=0&amp;hp&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=6 January 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How unified and powerful the Brotherhood is, is disputed. Former deputy chairman, Muhammad Habib has said, "there are fissures" in the Brotherhood, "and they may be to the very core. There is concern among the younger members that the leadership does not understand what's going on around it."&lt;ref name="Glain"/&gt; Another high-ranking member, [[Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh]], who was recently expelled from the Brotherhood, warned of the possibility of "an explosion."&lt;ref name="Glain" /&gt; Other observers (Eric Trager) have described the Brotherhood as "Egypt's most cohesive political movement, with an unparalleled ability to mobilize its followers ..."&lt;ref name=Trager/&gt;

Following the 2013 crackdown, the "most leaders" of the top rank (the Brotherhood's Guidance Office), second rank (Shura Council) and third rank (heads of municipalities and administrative bureaus) are "either in prison, exile or hiding", according to Khalil al-Anani of Al-Monitor.&lt;ref name=al-Anani-MB&gt;{{cite news|last1=al-Anani|first1=Khalil|title=Future remains unclear for Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2014/04/egypt-muslim-brotherhood-challenges-future.html#|accessdate=21 April 2015|agency=Al Monitor|date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Kareem Fahim, describes the group as having "fallen back on the organizational structure that sustained it for decades" when it was banned.&lt;ref name=FAHIM/&gt; He reports that the Brotherhood is "becoming more decentralized, but also more cohesive and rigid".&lt;ref name=FAHIM/&gt;

===Supporter levels===
* ''muhib'' ("lover" or "follower"). The lowest level of the Brotherhood is the ''muhib''. One is typically a muhib for six months, but the period can be as long as four years. A muhib is part of an ''usra'' ("family") which closely monitors the muhib's piety and ideological commitment, working to "improve the morals" of the muhib. An usras meets at least once a week and "spends much of its time discussing members' personal lives and activities."  The usra usually has four or five members and is headed by a ''naqib'' ("captain").
* ''muayyad'' ("supporter"). A muhib graduates to muayyad after confirmation that the muhib prays regularly and possesses basic knowledge of major Islamic texts. This stage lasts from one to three years. A muayyad is a nonvoting member of the brotherhood. Their duties include carrying out tasks such as preaching, recruiting, teaching in mosques assigned to them by superiors. They also follow a "rigorous curriculum of study", memorizing sections of the [[Quran]] and studying the teachings of [[Hasan Al Banna]], the founder of the Brotherhood.
* ''muntasib'' ("affiliated"). This process lasts a year and is the first step toward full membership. As one Brother put it, a muntasib "is a member, but his name is written in pencil." A muntasib continues to study Islam ([[hadith]] and [[Tafsir]]) and now [[tithe]]s the brotherhood, (typically giving 5% to 8% of their earning).
* ''muntazim'' ("organizer"). This stage typically lasts another two years. A muntazim must continue memorizing [[hadith]] and complete memorization of the [[Quran]] and "can assume a lower-level leadership role, such a forming an usra or heading a chapter" of usras.
* ''ach'amal'' ("working brother"). This final level is reached after the subject loyalty is "closely probed." "An ach'amal can vote in all internal elections, participate in all of the Brotherhood's working bodies, and compete for higher office within the group's hierarchy."&lt;ref name=Trager/&gt;

===Offices and organs===
* ''Murshid'' ("Supreme Guide"). Head of the Brotherhood (and of its ''Maktab al-Irshad'')&lt;ref name=Trager/&gt;
* ''Maktab al-Irshad'' ("Guidance Office"). Maktab al-Irshad consists of approximately 15 longtime Muslim Brothers including the ''Murshid'', who heads the office. Each member of the office oversees a portfolio on an issue such as university recruitment, education, politics, etc. The office execute decisions made by the ''Majlis al-Shura'' and passes down orders through a chain of command, consisting of "its deputies in each regional sector, who call their deputies in each subsidiary area, who call their deputies in each subsidiary populace, who call the heads of each local ''usra'', who then transmit the order to their members."&lt;ref name=Trager/&gt;
* ''Majlis al-Shura'' ("Consultative Council"). This consists of approximately 100 Muslim Brothers. Debates and votes on important decisions, such as whether to participate in national elections. Elects members of the Maktab al-Irshad.&lt;ref name=Trager/&gt;

===Social services===
The brotherhood operates 21 hospitals throughout Egypt, providing modern medical care at subsidized prices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/world/july-dec11/egypt_09-14.html Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood Flexes Potent Political Force]| 14 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It also operates job-training programmes,&lt;ref name=IRIN&gt;[http://www.irinnews.org/report.aspx?reportid=26150 EGYPT: Social programmes bolster appeal of Muslim Brotherhood], IRIN, 22 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; schools in every [[Governorates of Egypt|governorate]] in the country&lt;ref name=IRIN/&gt; and programs to support widows and orphans.&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;Nadine Farag, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/revolution-in-cairo/inside-muslim-brotherhood/piety-and-politics.html#ixzz1YzoPHX1Z Between Piety and Politics: Social Services and the Muslim Brotherhood], PBS&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 1,000 of the roughly 5,000 legally registered NGOs and associations in Egypt are run by the Brotherhood according to Abul Futouh, a leading brotherhood member.&lt;ref name=IRIN/&gt; Its clinics are reputed to have more available basic supplies and more up-to-date equipment.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; However, the Brotherhood's network of organizations is complex, sometimes operate under different names, and is difficult to track.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

The Brotherhood's response to the [[1992 Cairo earthquake|1992 earthquake in Cairo]], where 50,000 people were made homeless, was an example of the group's effectiveness, compared to that of the Egyptian government. It quickly mobilized to provide victims with food and blankets and setting up makeshift medical clinics and tents for shelter.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;

According to Kareem Fahim, following the 2013 crackdown members have started to abandon "activities like preaching and social work" as they focus on "resistance to the military-backed government".&lt;ref name=FAHIM/&gt;

=== Muslim Sisterhood ===
The ''Muslim Sisterhood'' is the female division of the Muslim Brotherhood. The members of the Muslim Sisterhood have been traditionally more involved in charitable activities than other members of Muslim Brotherhood. They are credited with keeping the Brotherhood together during the dark days of the 1950s and 1960s when many male members were intentionally dispersed across Egypt's prisons in order to cripple the apparatus, but the sisters "acted as an informal prison support network, carrying ideas and messages from prison to prison to sustain the Brotherhood, and were vital to their rebirth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ali|first=Amro|title=Not My Brotherhood's Keeper: The Fallacy of Crushing Egypt's Chief Islamist Group|url=http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/egyptsource/not-my-brotherhood-s-keeper-the-fallacy-of-crushing-egypt-s-chief-islamist-group|website=October 01, 2013|publisher=Atlantic Council|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the Muslim Sisterhood has help to attract new members to the Muslim Brotherhood. Many of these members come from university campuses, mosques and trade unions. During the Egyptian revolution of 2011, members of the Muslim Sisterhood have become more politically active, and they participated in the founding of the [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]] by the Muslim Brotherhood in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=CNN|last=Amin|first=Shahira|title=The feminine face of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood|date=3 August 2011|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/08/03/egypt.muslim.sisterhood/index.html?&amp;hpt=hp_c2|accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not an auxiliary group, they intend to play an equal role in the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Der Spiegel|last=Krahe|first=Dialika|title=The Muslim Sisterhood: Visions of Female Identity in the New Egypt|date=1 April 2011|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-muslim-sisterhood-visions-of-female-identity-in-the-new-egypt-a-754250.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Straße von gibraltar.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Pillars of Hercules from Mediterranean Sea: left the Jebel Musa, right the Rock of Gibraltar]]
The '''Pillars of Hercules''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Columnae Herculis'', [[Greek language|Greek]]: Ἡράκλειαι Στῆλαι, [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: أعمدة هرقل / ''Aʿmidat Hiraql'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Columnas de Hércules'') was the phrase that was applied in [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] to the [[promontory|promontories]] that flank the entrance to the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. The northern Pillar, Calpe Mons, is the [[Rock of Gibraltar]]. A corresponding North African peak not being predominant, the identity of the southern Pillar, Abila Mons, has been disputed throughout history,&lt;ref&gt;Strabo summarizes the dispute in ''Geographia'' 3.5.5.&lt;/ref&gt; with the two most likely candidates being [[Monte Hacho]] in [[Ceuta]] and [[Jebel Musa (Morocco)|Jebel Musa]] in [[Morocco]].

==History==
[[Image:PillarsHerculesPeutingeriana.jpg|thumb|120px|Modern conjectural depiction of the lost western section of the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]], showing a representation of the Pillars of Hercules (''Columne Ercole'').]]
According to [[Greek mythology]] adopted by the [[Etruscans]] and Romans, when [[Hercules]] had to perform [[Labours of Hercules|twelve labours]], one of them (the tenth) was to fetch the Cattle of [[Geryon]] of the far West and bring them to [[Eurystheus]]; this marked the westward extent of his travels. A lost passage of [[Pindar]] quoted by [[Strabo]] was the earliest traceable reference in this context: "the pillars which Pindar calls the 'gates of Gades' when he asserts that they are the farthermost limits reached by [[Heracles]]."&lt;ref&gt;Strabo, 3.5.5; the passage in Pindar has not been traced.&lt;/ref&gt; Since there has been a one-to-one association between Heracles and [[Melqart]] since [[Herodotus]], the "Pillars of Melqart" in the temple near Gades/Gádeira (modern [[Cádiz]]) have sometimes been considered to be the true ''Pillars of Hercules''.&lt;ref name="Burkert1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Burkert|title=Greek Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxurBtx6shoC&amp;pg=PA210|accessdate=2 November 2012|year=1985|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-36281-9|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Plato]]'s account, the lost realm of [[Atlantis]] was situated beyond the Pillars of Hercules, in effect placing it in the realm of the Unknown. Renaissance tradition says the pillars bore the warning ''Ne plus ultra'' (also ''Non plus ultra'', "nothing further beyond"), serving as a warning to sailors and navigators to go no further.

According to some Roman sources,&lt;ref&gt;Seneca, ''Hercules Furens'' 235ff.; Seneca, ''Hercules Oetaeus'' 1240; Pliny, ''Nat. Hist''. iii.4.&lt;/ref&gt; while on his way to the garden of the [[Hesperides]] on the island of [[Erytheia]], Hercules had to cross the mountain that was once [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]. Instead of climbing the great mountain, Hercules used his superhuman strength to smash through it. By doing so, he connected the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and formed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]. One part of the split mountain is [[Gibraltar]] and the other is either [[Monte Hacho]] or [[Jebel Musa (Morocco)|Jebel Musa]]. These two mountains taken together have since then been known as the Pillars of Hercules, though other natural features have been associated with the name.&lt;ref&gt;"Close to the Pillars there are two isles, one of which they call Hera's Island; moreover, there are some who call also these isles the Pillars." (Strabo, 3.5.3.); see also [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/3E*.html#note140 H. L. Jones' gloss on this line in the Loeb Classical Library].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diodorus Siculus]],&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus 4.18.5.&lt;/ref&gt; however, held that instead of smashing through an isthmus to create the Straits of Gibraltar, Hercules ''narrowed'' an already existing strait to prevent monsters from the Atlantic Ocean from entering the Mediterranean Sea. In some versions, Heracles instead built the two to hold the sky away from the earth, liberating Atlas from his damnation. {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Phoenician connection==
Beyond Gades, several important [[Mauretania]]n colonies (in modern-day [[Morocco]]) were founded by the [[Phoenicia]]ns as the Phoenician merchant navy pushed through the Pillars of Hercules and began constructing a series of bases along the Atlantic coast starting with [[Lixus (ancient city)|Lixus]] in the north, then [[Chellah]] and finally [[Mogador]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17926 C. Michael Hogan, ''Mogador, Megalithic Portal'', ed. Andy Burnham, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the eastern shore of the island of Gades/Gadeira (modern [[Cádiz]], just beyond the strait) [[Strabo]] describes&lt;ref&gt;([[Strabo]] 3.5.2–3&lt;/ref&gt; the westernmost temple of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] [[Heracles]], the god with whom Greeks associated the Phoenician and Punic [[Melqart]], by ''[[interpretatio graeca]]''. Strabo notes&lt;ref&gt;Strabo 3.5.5–6&lt;/ref&gt; that the two bronze pillars within the temple, each eight [[cubit]]s high, were widely proclaimed to be the true Pillars of Hercules by many who had visited the place and had sacrificed to Heracles there. But Strabo believes the account to be fraudulent, in part noting that the inscriptions on those pillars mentioned nothing about Heracles, speaking only of the expenses incurred by the Phoenicians in their making.  The [[Melqart#Cult|columns of the Melqart temple]] at [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] were also of religious significance.

[[File:Couly Nouailher - Hercules Carries the Two Columns - Walters 44265.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Limoges enamel]] depicting Hercules carrying the two columns, by Couly Nouailher, mid-16th century ([[Walters Art Museum]]).]]

==The Pillars in Syriac geography==
[[Syriac studies|Syriac]] scholars were aware of the Pillars through their efforts to translate Greek scientific works into their language as well as into Arabic. The Syriac compendium of knowledge known as ''Ktaba d'ellat koll 'ellan''. "The Cause of all Causes", is unusual in asserting that there were three, not two, columns&lt;ref&gt;[https://isawnyu.github.com/isaw-papers-awdl/5/preprint Adam C. McCollum. (2012). ''A Syriac Fragment from The Cause of All Causes on the Pillars of Hercules''. ISAW Papers, 5. ].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dante's ''Inferno''==
In ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' XXVI [[Dante Alighieri]] mentions [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] in the pit of the Fraudulent Counsellors and his voyage past the Pillars of Hercules. Ulysses justifies endangering his sailors by the fact that his goal is to gain knowledge of the unknown. After five months of navigation in the ocean, Ulysses sights the mountain of [[Purgatory]] but encounters a [[whirlwind]] from it that sinks his ship and all on it for their [[hubris|daring]] to approach Purgatory while alive, by their strength and wits alone.

==Pillars as a portal==
&lt;gallery style="float: right" width="120px"&gt;

File:Pillars of Hercules.svg|The columns as depicted in the [[Spanish coat of arms]].
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The Pillars appear as supporters of the [[coat of arms of Spain]], originating in the  [[personal device|impresa]] of Spain's sixteenth century king [[Charles I of Spain|Charles I]], who was also the Holy Roman Emperor as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. It was an idea of the Italian humanist [[Luigi Marliano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Diálogo delas empresas militares y amorosas, compuesto en lengua italiana|last=Giovio|first=Paolo|publisher=|date=1658|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=WDbIF2wnrUwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=di%C3%A1logo+de+las+empresas+militares+y+amorosas&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiM0dCT057cAhVDSBQKHZnJDewQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=marliano&amp;f=false|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It bears the motto ''[[Plus Ultra (motto)|Plus Ultra]]'', Latin for ''further beyond'', implying that the pillars were a gateway.This was modified from the phrase ''Nec plus ultra'', ''Nothing more beyond'' after the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovery of the Americas]], which laid to rest the idea of the Pillars of Hercules as the westernmost extremity of the inhabitable world which had prevailed since Antiquity.

==Sir Francis Bacon's ''Novum Organum''==
The Pillars appear prominently on the engraved title page of [[Sir Francis Bacon]]'s ''Instauratio Magna'' ("Great Renewal"), 1620, an unfinished work of which the second part was his influential ''[[Novum Organum]]''. The motto along the base says ''Multi pertransibunt et augebitur scientia'' ("Many will pass through and knowledge will be the greater").  The image was based on the use of the pillars in Spanish and Habsburg propaganda.

==In architecture==
On the Spanish coast at [[Los Barrios]] are [[Torres de Hercules]] which are twin towers that were inspired by the ''Pillars of Hercules''. These towers were the tallest in Andalusia until [[Cajasol Tower]] was completed in [[Seville]] in 2015.

The '''''Printers' International Specimen Exchange''''' was an influential annual subscription publication for the "technical education of the working printer"&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tuer in the ''Paper &amp; Printing Trades Journal'', September 1879, reprinted in Volume I of the ''Specimen Exchange''.&lt;/ref&gt; that ran from 1880 to 1898. Conceived around the time of the [[Caxton Celebration]] of 1877,&lt;ref&gt;Field &amp; Tuer sponsored an exhibit volume for the Caxton Celebration exhibition titled ''Specimens of American Letterpress Printing'', and in his introduction to Volume I Tuer cited the Caxton Celebration as the beginning of recent cooperation among printers that made such an experiment as the ''Specimen Exchange'' possible.&lt;/ref&gt; it was an ambitious expansion of a "Specimens" column then appearing in the ''[[Paper &amp; Printing Trades Journal]]'', a widely read trade publication issued by London printers and publishers Field &amp; Tuer and edited by [[Andrew White Tuer]]. 

The official proposal was made in a letter written in 1879 by Thomas Hailing of the Oxford Printing Works, Cheltenham, to Tuer, who replied that if 100 printers would participate, his firm would handle the arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;The proposal and reply were published in the''Paper &amp; Printing Trades Journal'' in September 1879 and reprinted in Volume I of the ''Specimen Exchange''.&lt;/ref&gt; Printers, and their employees and apprentices, were invited to send in examples of their work in the number of anticipated subscribers for each year. In return, they received a bound, collated set of all specimens accepted. The cost was one shilling (three shillings for American subscribers). For an additional cost, the finished volume was bound in half vellum laced with catgut. 

[[File:PISE-DeVinne.jpg|thumb|left|Contribution by T. L. De Vinne &lt;br&gt;to Volume VII (1886)]]Response to the call for specimens for the first issue exceeded all expectations, and publication, originally announced as biannual, was quickly changed to annual. [[John Ruskin]] praised the goals of the project in a letter quoted in the introduction to the first volume, and a copy of Volume VI was accepted by [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;Noted in the introduction to Volume VII.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially most of the contributions came from Great Britain and the United States, but by the mid-1880s the ''Exchange'' included as many as 400 specimens from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;The high point was Volume X, with 406 specimens.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first three years, Tuer and his editorial assistant, Robert Hilton, commented frankly and often amusingly on each specimen, but with the increase in both number and international participation, detailed critiques became burdensome and, perhaps, politically sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;Young, ''The Rise and Fall of the Printers' International Specimen Exchange'' (Oak Knoll Press, 2012), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Volumes I–VIII (1880–1887) were published by Field &amp; Tuer at the [[Leadenhall Press]], London, and the content represented both old-style and new "Artistic" printing. 

After Volume VIII, Tuer turned publication over to Hilton, who had moved on to become editor of a new journal, the ''British Printer'', published by the firm of Raithby &amp; Lawrence. The ''Exchange'' began to decline under Hilton's editorship,&lt;ref&gt;The farewell introduction to Volume XVI (the final volume) stated, "The last five or six vols. represent an amount of whipping-up and persevering hammering away at subscribers that only those closely connected with the publication can form an idea of."&lt;/ref&gt; leaning heavily toward the new "Leicester Free Style" of typography developed by the firm's foreman Robert Grayson, and the venture ended a few years after Raithby &amp; Lawrence sued Hilton for violating an agreement not to start a competing publication.&lt;ref&gt;''British Printer'', Sept.-Oct. 1895, 266.&lt;/ref&gt; The last two (much slimmer) volumes each covered two years, with the final one not issued until early 1898, containing only 123 specimens. 

At its best, the ''Printers' International Specimen Exchange'' taught a generation of printers how to examine learn from printed work, and it inspired similar ventures in Germany, France, and the United States.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6674">'''Protohistory''' is a period between [[prehistory]] and [[history]], during which a [[culture]] or [[civilization]] has not yet developed [[writing]] but other cultures have already noted its existence in their own writings. For example, in [[Europe]], the [[Celt]]s and the [[Germanic tribes]] are considered to have been protohistoric when they began appearing in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources.

Protohistoric may also refer to the transition period between the advent of [[literacy]] in a society and the writings of the first [[historians]]. The preservation of oral traditions may complicate matters as these can provide a secondary historical source for even earlier events. Colonial sites involving a literate group and a non-literate group are also studied as protohistoric situations.

It can also refer to a period in which fragmentary or external historical documents, not necessarily including a developed writing system, have been found. For instance, the [[Proto–Three Kingdoms of Korea]], the [[Yayoi]]&lt;ref&gt;Bahn, Paul (ed.) ''The Penguin Archaeology Guide'' Penguin Books Ltd (29 Nov 2001) {{ISBN|978-0-14-029308-1}} p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] groups recorded by early European explorers are protohistoric.

==Chronology==
As with prehistory, determining when a culture may be considered prehistoric or protohistoric is sometimes difficult for [[archaeology|archaeologist]]s. Data vary considerably from culture to culture, region to region, and even from one system of reckoning dates to another.

In its simplest form, protohistory follows the same chronology as prehistory, based on the technological advancement of a particular people with regard to [[metallurgy]]:

*The Copper Age or [[Chalcolithic]]
*The [[Bronze Age]]
*The [[Iron Age]]

==Civilizations and peoples==
The best known protohistoric civilizations and [[ethnic group]]s  are those for whom the term was originally coined: the [[barbarian]] tribes mentioned by European and Asian writers. Many of these peoples of course also experienced periods of prehistory and history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8877">'''Proximity of blood''', or '''proximity by degree''' of [[degree of kinship|kinship]], is one of the ways to determine [[Hereditary title|hereditary]] [[Order of succession|succession]] based on [[genealogy]]. In effect, the application of this rule is a refusal to recognize the [[per stirpes|right of representation]], a component of [[primogeniture]].{{sfn|Kidd|2014|p=88}}

In some feudal entities, proximity of blood was a generally accepted principle. For example, it is called the "ancient custom" ({{lang-fr|ancienne coutume}}) in the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], where a grandson could not take precedence over a son, and it was not even clear whether the ruler's grandson could claim precedence over the ruler's brother.{{sfn|Chattaway|2006|p=92}}

== Examples ==
Proximity of blood and primogeniture were at loggerheads in numerous medieval succession disputes.

===Successful applications===
*When [[Richard the Lionheart]] died in 1199, the succession to the English throne, as well as to [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]] and [[County of Anjou|Anjou]], was disputed between his fourth but sole surviving brother, [[John, King of England|John]], and his nephew [[Arthur I, Duke of Brittany|Arthur]] (the son of his second brother, [[Geoffrey II, Duke of Brittany|Geoffrey]]). The Angevin law favored primogeniture and thus Arthur, while the Norman law recognized the proximity of blood and gave precedence to John. Arthur's claim had been recognized by Richard in 1191, but just before his death Richard expressed support for John, who in the end prevailed.{{sfn|Barlow|1999|p=305}}

*[[Alfonso X of Castile]] wished to enforce primogeniture by the ''[[Siete Partidas]]'' in the late 1270s and bequeath his crown to [[Alfonso de la Cerda|Alfonso]], the son of his deceased eldest son, [[Ferdinand de la Cerda|Ferdinand]]. His second but eldest surviving son, [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho]], rebelled with the support of the nobility and successfully claimed the crown by degree of kinship.{{sfn|Previté-Orton|1975|p=831}}

*In 1307 a dispute erupted over the [[County of Artois]] between [[Mahaut, Countess of Artois|Mahaut]], who had succeeded her father, [[Robert II, Count of Artois|Robert II]], in 1302, and Mahaut's nephew, [[Robert III of Artois|Robert]]. Robert II had outlived his son, [[Philip of Artois|Philip]], and Mahaut put herself forward as "the closest relative to our said father at the time of his death, the reason of propinquity or proximity being notorious in custom". Her nephew, Philip's son, insisted on "representation of our aforesaid father who was the first born of our same grandfather". His appeal was rejected in 1309 on the basis that the established custom of Artois favored Mahaut, but he never relinquished his claim.{{sfn|Wood|1966|p=60}}

*[[Odo IV, Duke of Burgundy|Odo IV]], having outlived his son [[Philip I, Count of Auvergne|Philip]], decreed in his will in 1348 that he should be succeeded by his grandson, also named [[Philip I, Duke of Burgundy|Philip]], unless Odo fathered another son. Odo's grandson, however, should have precedence over any daughters Odo might have and over Odo's sisters. In case of Philip's death without issue, the duchy was to pass to Odo's youngest but sole surviving sister, [[Joan the Lame|Joan]], rather than to the descendants of his deceased older sisters.{{sfn|Chattaway|2006|p=92}} Odo IV had no further sons and was succeeded by his grandson, Philip I. Philip died childless in 1361, having outlived his grandfather's last sibling, Joan. The duchy would have gone to [[Charles II of Navarre]], grandson of Odo's older sister [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of France|Margaret]], according to primogeniture, but was successfully claimed by [[John II of France]], son of the younger sister Joan, according to proximity of blood. Since Charles was the grandson of a sister of Odo and John was the son of another, the latter was one degree closer to the dukes of Burgundy than Charles.{{sfn|Chattaway|2006|p=92}}

*During the reign of [[Charles XII of Sweden]] it was never resolved whether his heir should be his younger sister, [[Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden|Ulrika Eleonora]], or his nephew, [[Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp|Charles Frederick]] (the son of his deceased elder sister, [[Hedvig Sophia of Sweden|Hedwig Sophia]]).{{sfn|Hatton|1968|p=132, 393}} The sister was more closely related to the reigning king, but the nephew had precedence according to primogeniture.{{sfn|Hatton|1968|p=371}} Upon Charles XII's death in 1718 it was Ulrika Eleonora who successfully claimed the crown.{{sfn|Hatton|1968|p=}}

=== Unsuccessful applications ===

*In 1269, upon the death of [[Conrad III of Jerusalem]], [[Mary of Antioch]] and [[Hugh III of Cyprus]] both claimed the crown. She was the daughter of [[Melisende of Lusignan|Melisende]], fifth daughter of [[Isabella I of Jerusalem]], while he was the grandson of [[Alice of Champagne|Alice]], second daughter of Isabella I. Mary the only living grandchild of Isabella I and closer in kinship to Conrad III (first cousin twice removed) and the [[kings of Jerusalem]], while Hugh had precedence by [[primogeniture]] but was more distantly related to Conrad III (second cousin) and Isabella I (great-grandchild). The [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem|Haute Cour]] decided in favour of Hugh but Mary did not relinquish her claim.{{sfn|Runciman|1987|p=328-329}}

*[[Alexander III of Scotland]] drafted a treaty in 1281 in which he set out the rules of succession among his descendants. The provisions appeared to favor primogeniture for male heirs but proximity of blood for female heirs; the son of a deceased older son would take precedence over a surviving younger son but a younger daughter over a deceased older daughter's children.{{sfn|Duncan|2002|p=166-169}} Upon the death of his granddaughter and successor, [[Margaret, Maid of Norway|Margaret]], in 1290, the succession was [[Great Cause|unclear]]. [[Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale|Robert de Brus]] claimed the crown by proximity in degree of kinship to the [[kings of Scotland]],{{sfn|Stevenson|2014|p=}} while [[John Balliol]] made a claim based on primogeniture.{{sfn|Kidd|2014|p=88}} Robert and John were both descended from [[David, Earl of Huntingdon|David of Huntingdon]] (grandson of [[David I of Scotland]]); Robert was a grandson (son of [[Isobel of Huntingdon|Isobel]], second daughter of David of Huntingdon) while John was a great-grandson (grandson of [[Margaret of Huntingdon, Lady of Galloway|Margaret]], first daughter of David of Huntingdon).{{sfn|Kidd|2014|p=88}} Arbitration by [[Edward I of England]] awarded the throne to John, but Robert's grandson later successfully claimed the crown as [[Robert I of Scotland]].{{sfn|Stevenson|2014|p=}}

'''Qırmızı Qəsəbə''' ([[Help:IPA/Turkic dialects|/gɯɾmɯzɯ gæsæbæ/]], {{lang-ru|Красная Слобода}}, ''Krasnaya Sloboda'', {{lang-en|Red Town}}) is a village and municipality in [[Quba District (Azerbaijan)|Quba District]] of [[Azerbaijan]].

The village is located across the Qudiyalçay River (or Kudyal River) from the larger town of [[Quba]]. It is the primary settlement of Azerbaijan's population of highland, or [[mountain Jews]] who make up the population of approximately 4,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.il/books?id=oZCOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124|title=Ethnic Groups of North, East, and Central Asia: An Encyclopedia|first=James B.|last= Minahan|year=2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1610690184|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely spoken language in Qırmızı Qəsəbə is [[Juhuri]].

The settlement is sometimes referred to as the Red Town or the Red Village, possibly because of the red tiling used on many of the roofs.&lt;ref name=css/&gt; Other sources attribute the name to the protected status the town received during the Soviet period, when it was shielded from persecution during World War II.&lt;ref name=atlasob/&gt;

Initially spread throughout the mountainous region, the Jewish population of the highlands became centered around Qaba.&lt;ref name=atlasob&gt;{{cite web|title=Krasnaya Sloboda (Qırmızı QƏsƏbƏ)|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/krasnaya-sloboda-qirmizi-q-s-b|website=Atlas Obscura|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement is sometimes referred to as the Red Town or the Red Village, possibly because of the red tiling used on many of the roofs.&lt;ref name=css/&gt;

=== Quba ===
{{Main|Quba}}

Quba is one of the popular regions of Azerbaijan. In the past, the guests visiting Azerbaijan were invited to visit Quba because of its proximity to the capital city. [[Lezgins]], [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tats]], [[Khinalug people]], [[Budukh people]] and [[Kryts people]] were living in peace and friendship with Turks in Quba for centuries. Qırmızı, being located in Quba where the mountain Jews reside, is also important in promoting Quba.&lt;ref name=azerb&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerb.com/az-krasnaya.html|title=Krasnaya Sloboda|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Quba-Azerbaijan|title=Quba|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
Officially, Jews were registered with 213,138 people in 34 settlements of the Caucuses in 1881. Over the past hundred years, along with highland Jews, other ethnolinguistic groups or the regions - Ashkenazi, Krymchaks, Kurdish Jews, and Georgian Jews also lived in Azerbaijan. However, since the 19th century, the majority of Jewish population of republic is consisting of mountainous Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azernews.az/travel/67543.html|title=Krasnaya Sloboda – unique settlement of Jews in Azerbaijan|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/azerbaijan-virtual-jewish-history-tour|title=Azerbaijan Virtual Jewish History Tour|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Synagogue at Qırmızı Qəsəbə.jpg|thumb|left|Inside a renovated "Giləki" (Hilaki) Synagogue&lt;ref name="Qırmızı qəsəbə Giləki sinaqoqu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Qırmızı qəsəbə "Giləki" sinaqoqu|url=http://scwra.gov.az/structure/20/?Q%C4%B1rm%C4%B1z%C4%B1%20q%C9%99s%C9%99b%C9%99%20%E2%80%9CGil%C9%99ki%E2%80%9D%20sinaqoqu|website=scwra.gov.az|accessdate=12 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The first Jewish settlement in the area was named "Kulgat" on the left bank of the Gudjalchay, just a few kilometers from present day Qırmızı. The old grave stones in the Kulgat area and other evidences that partially had been destroyed during the attacks of the Nadir Shah proves that the Jews had lived here.

While the highland Jews had been in the area around Quba since at least the 13th century, the formal creation of Krasnaya Sloboda is traced back to the 18th century. In 1742 the Khan of Quba, [[Fatali Khan]], gave the Jews permission to set up a community free of persecution across the river from the city of Quba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jerusalem of the Caucasus|journal=Visions of Azerbaijan Magazine|url=http://www.visions.az/en/news/386/ad48cd0/|accessdate=9 March 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally referred to as Yevreiskaya ''[[Sloboda]]'' (Jewish Settlement), the name was changed to Krasnaya Sloboda (Red Settlement) under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] rule.

The Jews who moved here from different places lived in 9 settlements. The Jews from Gilan moved to the settlement in the 1780. The Gilaki settlement of the Gilani Jews located in the center of the Red settlement. People coming from [[Baku]] and Quba lived in the settlement of Mizrahi ("East"). Migration from different locations influenced the diversity of employment. For example, Jews moving from mountainous regions were engaged in various agricultural fields, and people who immigrated from Iran were engaged in trade.

The massive settlement in the Red town began in 1731. After the death of Huseynali Khan in 1758, his son Fatali Khan was leader of Quba khanate. Khan highly appreciating the loyalty, wisdom, and industriousness of the mountain Jews, gave them a great opportunity for engaging in agriculture, gardening, trade, and crafts. Favorable living conditions created for Jews in Quba caused the relocation of Jews from other villages, such as [[Qusar District|Qusar]], [[Uçgün|Ucgun]], [[Şuduq|Shudukh]], Griz, and even from [[Baku]], [[Iran]], [[Turkey]] and other places to Quba.

Finally, mountain Jews who escaped attacks and persecutions joined the shelter of heading Husseinanli Khan in Quba. The Quba Khanate, which were developing during the years of Hussein Khan (1722-1758) and his son Fatali Khan (1758-1789), consist of the northern lands of Azerbaijan and southern [[Dagestan]], from [[Derbent]] to [[Lankaran District|Lankaran]]. Since 1722, mountain Jews have settled in the territory of Gudyalchay.&lt;ref name=azerb/&gt;

Among Russian Jews, the town once was known as "little Jerusalem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jewish shtetl in Azerbaijan survives amid Muslim majority|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/jewish-shtetl-in-azerbaijan-survives-amid-muslim-majority/|website=The Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located at the intersection of East and West, more than 40 minorities and ethnic groups live in [[Azerbaijan]], including [[Talyshs]], [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]], [[Lezgins]], [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Georgians]], [[Poles]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visions.az/en/news/112/504c92fb/|title=JEWS IN AZERBAIJAN: A HISTORY SPANNING THREE MILLENNIA|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town has had an influx of financial support from relatives living in [[Israel]] and features the new Bet Knesset Synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's an all-Jewish town, but no, it's not in Israel|url=https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/features/it-s-an-all-jewish-town-but-no-it-s-not-in-israel-1.25044|website=www.thejc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after Azerbaijan's independence in 1991, many residents emigrated to [[Israel]], the [[United States]], and [[Europe]], and the population dropped from the roughly 18,000 that lived there during the era of Communism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JOURNEY INTO THE UNREAL|url=http://www.shalom-magazine.com/Article.php?id=470309|website=www.shalom-magazine.com|publisher=SHALOM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious practice ==
The Jewish residents continue their worship in the remaining synagogues. Only eight of the thirteen synagogues have been preserved in the settlement.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Two synagogues exist in Qırmızı Qəsəbə: "Altı günbəz" (Grand) synagogue which was built in 1888 and renovated in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Qırmızı qəsəbə "Altı günbəz" sinaqoqu|url=http://scwra.gov.az/structure/21/?Q%C4%B1rm%C4%B1z%C4%B1%20q%C9%99s%C9%99b%C9%99%20%E2%80%9CAlt%C4%B1%20g%C3%BCnb%C9%99z%E2%80%9D%20sinaqoqu|website=scwra.gov.az|accessdate=12 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Giləki" (Hilaki) synagogue which was built in 1896 and renovated recently.&lt;ref name="Qırmızı qəsəbə Giləki sinaqoqu"/&gt;

Synagogues do not have a special call during worship. People come and pray because they know the time of worship. Morning worship begins at 8am. The afternoon worship comes at 8:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. and at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. evening worship. Following tradition, women do not worship in the synagogue though may come to synagogues on holidays.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Residents speak in 3 language: [[Judeo-Tat]] which mountain Jews speak in daily life, Russian and Azerbaijan language. The majority of residents of this settlement have also mastered English. One of the two schools here is taught in Azerbaijani or Russian.&lt;ref name=css&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/en/services/digital-library/articles/article.html/52398/pdf|title=Azerbaijan’s Jewish enclave|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rua Tapunui Kenana''' (1869–1937) was a [[Māori people|Māori]] prophet, [[faith healer]] and [[land rights]] activist. He called himself Te Mihaia Hou, the New [[Messiah]], and claimed to be [[Te Kooti|Te Kooti Arikirangi]]'s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/1t45/te-kooti-arikirangi-te-turuki Te Ara: Te Kooti Arikirangi Te Turuki]&lt;/ref&gt; successor Hepetipa (Hephzibah) who would reclaim [[Ngāi Tūhoe|Tūhoe]] land that had been lost to [[Pākehā]] ownership. Rua's beliefs split the [[Ringatū]] Church,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/maori-prophetic-movements-nga-poropiti/page-3 Te Ara: Māori prophetic movements – ngā poropiti]&lt;/ref&gt; which Te Kooti had founded in around 1866/1868. In 1907 Rua formed a non-violent religious community at [[Maungapohatu|Maungapōhatu]], the sacred mountain of Ngāi Tūhoe, in the Urewera. By 1900, Maungapōhatu was one of the few areas that had not been investigated by the [[Māori Land Court|Native Land Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/page/native-land-court-created|title=Native Land Court created  - NZHistory, New Zealand history online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community, also known as [[New Jerusalem]], included a farming co-operative and a [[savings bank]]. Many Pākehā believed the community was subversive and saw Rua as a disruptive influence.&lt;ref name="heritageetal.blogspot.co.nz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heritageetal.blogspot.co.nz/2014/08/rua-kenana-maori-prophet.html|title=Heritage et AL: Rua Kēnana - Māori prophet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 police mounted an armed expedition, arriving at Maungapōhatu on 2 April to arrest Rua for [[sedition]].  He was found not guilty on this charge but imprisoned for resisting arrest.  Rua was released in April 1918 and returned to Maungapōhatu, the community was however in decline and by the early 1930s, most people had left to find work elsewhere. Rua moved on to Matahi in the eastern [[Bay of Plenty]] and lived there until his death in 1937.

In September 2017, the government committed to pardon him as part of a [[Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements|treaty settlement]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/339070/kenana-pardon-a-chance-to-move-forward-signatory|title=Kēnana pardon a chance to move forward - signatory|date=2017-09-09|work=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en-nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rua was born in 1869 at Maungapōhatu in the [[Urewera Ranges|Urewera Country]] New Zealand. He was the [[Posthumous birth|posthumous son]] of Kenana Tumoana, who was killed at Makaretu in November 1868 while fighting for [[Te Kooti]], and of Ngahiwi Te Rihi. Rua was a member of the Tamakaimoana [[hapū]] of the [[Ngāi Tūhoe|Tūhoe tribe]] and, although not a chief in his own right, was of high birth and could trace his descent from Potiki and Toroa of the [[Mataatua]] canoe.

In 1887 Rua left Maungapōhatu to learn farming. He worked on sheep stations in the [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]] and [[Bay of Plenty]] districts and was a member of a shearing gang on the East Coast. During this period he studied the [[Bible]]. In 1905 he returned to Maungapōhatu where he set himself up as a [[prophet]] of the [[New Testament]] type. Here he formed his new self-sufficient community at Maungapōhatu which he called the "[[New Jerusalem]]" with its eventual population of between 800–1000 followers.

== The prophet at Maungapōhatu ==
[[Image:Rua stands on a rock at the centre..jpg|thumb|225px|left|Rua standing on the rock in the centre]]
Te Kooti Arikirangi, the founder of the [[Ringatu]] religion, had predicted before he died that he would have successor.&lt;ref name="TipunaProfiles"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngaituhoe.com/Folders/TipunaProfiles.html|title=Prophet Rua Kenana|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rua's statement that he was the successor to Te Kooti was first announced through an experience that he underwent on Maungapōhatu, the sacred mountain of Tūhoe. The oral narratives tell how Rua and his first wife, [[Pinepine Te Rika]], were directed to climb the mountain by a [[supernatural]] [[Vision (spirituality)|apparition]], later revealed to be the [[archangel Gabriel]]. There they were shown a hidden diamond, the guardian-stone of the land, whose bright light was shielded by Te Kooti's shawl. Rua, in his turn, covered it again to protect it. In some versions of the narrative Rua met both Whaitiri, the ancestress of Tūhoe, and [[Jesus|Christ]] on the mountain. Rua would soon claim to be the [[Māori people|Māori]] brother of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/3r32/rua-kenana-hepetipa |title= Rua Kanara Hepetipa  |publisher=Te Ara (encyclopaedia) |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of three periods of settlement at Maungapōhatu, Rua arrived at this isolated outpost as the winter set in. Those who were there can still remember the harshness of that first year: the potato crop failed and there were no pigs to be had. Tatu, one of the Riwaiti, had to go back to Te Whaiti to collect 6 sows to start their own breeding colony. At least 50 people died that winter, most of them children, from the inadequacy of the houses, an outbreak of [[Typhoid fever|typhoid]] which came from the valley camps, and a [[measles]] [[epidemic]] which devastated the community. Sometimes there was nothing to eat but [[Huhu beetle|huhu]], and the coarse toi leaves, normally used only for clothing. But from this inauspicious beginning, the community struggled on to a first summer of great plenty.  Two groups had come together to build ‘te pa tapu o te atua’, the sacred [[pā (Māori)|pā]] of the Lord, the Tūhoe, about half the entire tribe, and the Whakatohea, who through confiscation were almost landless. To signify the union between these two Mataatua tribes, Rua constructed the house of the Lord, Hiruharama Hou, built with two gables. One side was for Tūhoe and the other for Whakatohea.&lt;ref&gt;Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu ([[Judith Binney]] with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace. Oxford University Press, 1979. pages 45–56).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maungapohatu, city of the mist 1908.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Maungapohatu, city of the mist]]
Rua claimed to be the new Christ, the son of [[Jehovah]], and said that no one who joined him would die. He called himself Te Mihaia Hou, the New [[Messiah]]. Rua owed his power to the great skill with which he applied the scriptures to the day today events in the lives of those who believed in him. His prophetic sayings (nga kupu whakari) gave meaning to a harsh existence, and offered hope to the future. He attempted to create a new system of land ownership and land usage. He organised a strong communal basis in all the settlements he founded but also emphasised the concept of family ownership of property. He cast aside all traditional Māori [[Tapu (Polynesian culture)|tapu]] practices and replaced them with new forms specifically associated with the faith in himself as the Promised Messiah. His followers vested their lands in Rua and he had these surveyed and sold back to them. The settlement was administered by the prophet's own parliament. He also formed a Māori mining company to exploit the mineral resources of the Urewera. At the prophet's command, 5 miles of forest were cleared and a prosperous farming community grew up under his leadership. Rua acted as his people's banker and took [[tithe]]s of all they earned. In return, he gave them a prosperity they had never before known.

Rua built a curious two-storied circular temple of worship at Maungapōhatu , called the Hīona ([[Zion]]) that also became his parliament from where the community affairs were administered. This circular meeting house, built in 1908, was decorated with a design of blue clubs and yellow diamonds, and stood within the inner sanctum of the pa. This was Rua's  “Council Chamber and Court House” – also known as “Rua's Temple”. Rua thought it was modelled on the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem Temple]] (even though his chamber was not to be a place of worship), but the actual model was the present day [[Dome of the Rock]] on Jerusalem's Temple Mount, a Muslim holy site and one of the most sacred of Islamic shrines.  Its unique cylinder shape would make it one of a kind&lt;ref name="TipunaProfiles"/&gt; He grew his hair long and affected a bushy beard in the patriarchal tradition fashioned on the Jewish [[Nazirite]]. As his reading of the Bible appeared to prescribe seven wives, Rua kept to this number and immediately replaced any who died or ran away. In all he had 12 wives and over 70 children.

From the King-ite tradition he inherited the idea that Māori possessed a separate nationality, and this, together with the success of his community, aroused the jealousy of local chiefs and incurred the Government's enmity. Through his personal vision his messianic religion promised the return of Māori lands and [[mana]] to Māori, and the end of their subjection to [[pākehā]] rule. He wanted to remove the Tūhoe people totally from European influence and induced many to sell all their stock and farming interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aotearoa.wellington.net.nz/he/rua.htm|title=Rua Kenana – Let the white man, fight the white mans war!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power==
By 1908 Rua's struggle for power had brought the Tūhoe to the brink of civil war and the Prime Minister Sir [[Joseph Ward]] intervened to curb the prophet's influence.  The Government had organised a meeting in March 1908 at [[Ruatoki]] of all the Tūhoe tribes in an attempt to sort out the political differences between the two main Tūhoe factions, that of Rua Kenana and Numai Kereru, chief of the Ngatirongo and the main opponent among the Tūhoe of Rua's [[Judeo-Christian|Christian-Judaic]] religious movement.  [[File:Rua Kenana and four of his wives.jpg|thumb|left|Rua and four of his wives]] Because conflict was expected, the New Zealand Prime Minister had decided to informally visit both parties before the conference.  At a dramatic encounter with Sir Joseph Ward on the [[Whakatane]] beach front on 23 March 1908, Rua and Joseph Ward exchanged words.  Rua, flanked by some of his wives and supporters while seated on a chair that had been borrowed from the pub, acknowledged Joseph Ward approaching. Ward addressed both parties publicly, asking for their assistance in reconciling the differences in the forthcoming meeting at Ruatoki.  To Rua's followers Ward said that he could not accept all that Rua had asked for. In particular, his request for his supporters to be placed on the European electoral role (presumably because they were outnumbered in the [[Eastern Maori|Eastern Maori electorate]]) was unacceptable, for Māori have "special representation of their own.”  To Rua's request to have a special Māori government, he said, “I told Rua... that in New Zealand [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|King Edward]] is king, and is represented here by his government or king. There can’t be two suns shining in the sky at the same time.” Rua replied to Ward, "Yes, there is only one sun in the heavens, but it shines on one side – the Pākehā side – and it darkens on the other.”&lt;ref&gt;Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu ([[Judith Binney]] with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace.  Oxford University Press, 1979. pages 45–56).&lt;/ref&gt;

Rua had become a political embarrassment, and there arose the need by the Government to make an example of this man widely seen as an agitator, hoping a crackdown would discourage other Māori activists.  The mainstream [[Anglican]] church encouraged the Government to suppress Rua Kenana. In 1907, the church passed a motion that supported "the recent action of the Government in the direction of the suppression of tohungism (traditional Māori healing), and trusts that it may be possible for the Church to make more aggressive action among the tribes which are specifically affected by this evil."  Authorities saw Rua Kenana as a disruptive influence and targeted him with the [[Tohunga Suppression Act 1907]], which banned traditional [[Tohunga|Māori healers]] from using herbs and other healing methods which were part of their traditional medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/hawkes-bay-today/news/headlines.cfm?c_id=1503462|title=Local, latest and breaking news from the Hawkes Bay region - Hawkes Bay Today|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tohunga Suppression Act was designed to neutralise powerful traditional Māori leaders and tailor-made as a political weapon specifically against Rua Kenana and his movement of dissenting Māori.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/nz/journals/VUWLRev/2001/17.html A Return to the Tohunga Suppression Act 1907 – [2001&amp;#93; VUWLRev 17; (2001) 32 VUWLR 437&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of a number of charges of obtaining alcohol in 1910, Rua was fined for [[Sly-grog shop|sly grogging]] and, in 1915, served a short gaol sentence for a similar offence. On his release he resumed his sly grogging.

Rua insisted that his people boycott military service, pertaining it was immoral to fight for a Pākehā King and Country given the injustice meted out on Māori under the British crown. Rua said, "I have 1400 men here and I am not going to let any of them enlist or go to war. You have no king now. The King of England he is no good. He is beat. The Germans will win. Any money I have I will give to the Germans. The English are no good. They have two laws. One for the Māori and one for the Pākehā. When the Germans win I am going to be king here. I will be king of the Māori and of the Pākehā."&lt;ref&gt;Sheehan, Mark (1989), Māori and Pākehā: Race Relations 1912–1980. MacMillan, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt; This was taken by the establishment as [[sedition]] and finally gave the Government and Rua's detractors the incentive to intervene against Kenana and the Maungapōhatu community.

==Arrest==
[[Image:Rua Kenana meets with NZ PM Joseph Ward.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Rua Kenana meets with New Zealand Prime Minister [[Joseph Ward]] on [[Whakatane]] Beach, 23 March 1908.]]
During the [[World War I|First World War]] the New Zealand Government had concerns that Rua opposed Tūhoe men enlisting for war, these concerns resulted in rumours that he openly supported Germany.  The Government arrested Rua after a 1915 hahunga, a bone cleansing ceremony, where he allegedly supplied liquor without a licence. He was summoned to appear before a magistrate on 19 January 1916, Rua said he would appear at the February court session as he was busy harvesting cocksfoot grass but his non-appearance was deemed to be contempt of court and preparations began for an armed police expedition to arrest him.&lt;ref name="heritageetal.blogspot.co.nz"/&gt;

On 2 April 1916 a 70-strong, and heavily armed, police party arrived at Maungapōhatu to arrest him for [[sedition]]. Because Rua's village was so remote, the police had to take a lot of equipment and camped on the way. They moved like a small army with wagons and pack-horses, and included [[The New Zealand Herald|''New Zealand Herald'']] photographer [[Arthur Breckon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Three Veteran Journalists Retire|last=|first=|date=June 12, 1940|work=The New Zealand Journalist|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; So as not to alert the Maungapōhatu village of their intention to spring an attack they did not wear their police uniforms till just before the raid. They were convinced that when they reached Maungapōhatu there would be an ambush.

There was no violent resistance from Rua personally,&lt;ref name="TipunaProfiles"/&gt; but his supporters fought a brisk half-hour gun battle with the police in which two Māori, including Rua's son Toko, were killed and two wounded. Four constables were also wounded. Rua was arrested and transported to [[Rotorua]], his hair and beard removed. From Rotorua, with six other Māori prisoners including Whatu, Rua was transferred to [[Auckland]] and sent directly to [[Mount Eden Prisons|Mount Eden Prison]]. Rua was held, at first, on a nine months sentence imposed for the 1915 charges and now increased by his default of fines. After a trial on sedition which lasted 47&amp;nbsp;days, New Zealand's longest until 1977, he was found not guilty; but sentenced to one year's imprisonment for resisting the police.&lt;ref&gt;Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu ([[Judith Binney]] with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace. Oxford University Press, 1979), page 119-124)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Police triumphant, parading before Hiona..jpg|thumb|200px|left|Police triumphant, parading before Hiona]] --&gt;
When he returned to the Urewera, the settlement at Maungapōhatu was broken, divided, and the lands overgrown and much of the community having relocated.  The [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Mission]] under Rev. John Laughton had moved into Maungapōhatu and was teaching Presbyterian Christianity and Pākehā value systems. This shocked Rua, as he had banned pākehā schools from the original community. The costs of defence at the various trials had ruined the community financially as it had to sell stock and land to meet the debt. The community was even ordered to pay the costs of the entire police operations and raid at Maungapōhatu . Even though the supreme court had found Rua's arrest illegal and a legal petition had been drafted to Parliament on 1 May 1917 on behalf of the Maungapōhatu people calling for a full public inquiry into the events of 2 April 1916, and the behaviour of the police there and later intimidating witnesses, no compensation was ever offered to Maungapōhatu.&lt;ref&gt;Mihaia : the prophet Rua Kenana and his community at Maungapohatu ([[Judith Binney]] with Gillian Chaplin and Craig Wallace. Oxford University Press, 1979, pages 131-132&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually Rua moved downstream to Matahi, a community he had founded on the [[Waimana River]] in the eastern Bay of Plenty in 1910, where he lived until his death on 20 February 1937. He was survived by five wives, nine sons, and 13 daughters. Belief in his divinity did not long survive him, however, as he failed to fulfill his promise to rise from the dead. Little now remains of Maungapōhatu, and his church (Te Wairua Tapu) boasts few followers. The Urewera Country is peaceful, a  contrast to what it was in the days of the Prophet Rua.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/R/RuaTapunuiHepetipaOrKenanaRuaHepetipa/RuaTapunuiHepetipaOrKenanaRuaHepetipa/en RUA TAPUNUI HEPETIPA, or KENANA RUA HEPETIPA – 1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Salzstraße Beschilderung.jpg|thumb|Sign for historic salt road in [[Bavaria]]]]

A '''salt road''' (also known as a '''salt route''', '''salt way''', '''saltway''', or '''salt trading route''') refers to any of the [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] and [[Recorded history|historical]] [[trade route]]s by which essential [[salt]] was transported to regions that lacked it.

From the [[Bronze Age]] (in the [[2nd millennium BC]]) fixed [[transhumance]] routes appeared, like the [[Liguria]]n ''drailles'' that linked the maritime Liguria with the ''alpages'', long before any purposely-constructed roadways formed the overland routes by which salt-rich provinces supplied salt-starved ones.

==Roads==
The ''[[Via Salaria]]'', an ancient [[Roman road]] in [[Italy]], eventually ran from [[Rome]] (from [[Porta Salaria]] in the [[Aurelian Walls]]) to ''Castrum Truentinum'' ([[Porto d'Ascoli]]) on the [[Adriatic coast]] - a distance of {{convert|242|km|mi}}. A modern road by this name, part of the SS4 highway, runs {{convert|51|km|mi}} from Rome to [[Osteria Nuova]] in [[Orvieto]].

The [[Old Salt Route]], about {{convert|100|km|mi}}, was a [[medieval]] route in northern [[Germany]], linking [[Lüneburg]] (in Lower Saxony) with the port of [[Lübeck]] (in Schleswig-Holstein), which required more salt than it could produce itself. Lüneburg, first mentioned in the 10th century, grew rich on the [[saltern]]s surrounding the town. Traders shipped salt via [[Lauenburg]], to Lübeck, which supplied all the coasts of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Lüneburg and its salt were major factors of power and wealth of the [[Hanseatic League]]. After a long period of prosperity, its importance declined after 1600. The last of the [[salt mine]]s was closed in 1980, ending the thousand-year tradition.

In [[France]], the salt route was longer than a [[portage]] between navigable streams. Salt unloaded at the ports of [[Nice]] and [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]] could travel by two salt roads leading away from the coastal area, from Nice up the [[Vésubie]] valley, via [[Saint-Martin-Vésubie]] at the head of the valley, or from Ventimiglia inland through the [[Roya (river)|Roya Valley]], over the [[Col de Tende]] pass and into [[Piedmont]].

[[File:ET Afar asv2018-01 img08 Lake Karum area.jpg|thumb|A [[camel train]] for salt transportation in Afar Region of Ethiopia]]
In [[Ethiopia]] blocks of salt, called ''[[amoleh]]'', were carved from the salt pans of the [[Afar Depression]], especially around [[Lake Afrera]], then carried by camel west to [[Atsbi]] and [[Ficho]] in the [[Ethiopian highlands|highland]], whence traders distributed them throughout the rest of Ethiopia, as far south as the [[Kingdom of Kaffa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pankhurst|1968|pp= 461ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before [[Incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China|the People's Republic of China annexed Tibet]] and closed the borders in the 1950s, salt trade between [[Nepal]] and [[Tibet]] crossed passes through the [[Himalayas]] such as the gorges of the upper [[Ghaghara|Karnali]] and [[Kali Gandaki Gorge|Gandaki]] rivers. Caravans of pack animals brought [[rice]] up from Nepal's [[Terai]] and lower hills in exchange for salt from [[Geography of Tibet#Regions|dry lakes]] on the [[Tibetan Plateau]].

==Rivers and ports==
The salt highways of [[Europe]] were the [[List of rivers of Europe|navigable rivers]], where by [[Middle Ages|medieval times]] shipments of salt coming upstream passed rafts and log-trains of timber, which could only be shipped downstream.&lt;ref&gt;In the tenth century along an established salt road mule trains brought firewood from the [[Rouergue]] to the deforested [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]] ports and returned laden with salt.&lt;/ref&gt; And even along Europe's coasts, once long-distance trade was revived in the 11th century, the hot and sunny south naturally outproduced the wet north. By the [[Late Middle Ages]] the expanding [[fishing]] fleets of the [[Low Countries]] required more salt than could be produced locally; the balance was made up with salt from the [[Iberian Peninsula]]: "The [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] could have been brought to their knees if their supplies of salt had been blocked at the end of the sixteenth century. [[Spain]] did no more than dream of this," Fernand Braudel has written.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Braudel|1982|p= 178}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]] [[China]], salt as well as rice was shipped from south to north, along the [[Grand Canal of China|Imperial Canal]] as far as [[Beijing]].

==Salterns and saltpans==
{{Main article|Salt evaporation pond|saltern}}

In France, a major source of marine salt with access to expansive hinterlands in need of it was the wetlands region in [[Languedoc]] called the [[Camargue]];  from the [[Dry lake|salt pan]]s called ''salines'', convoys of boatloads of salt could be carried up the [[Rhone]] to [[Seyssel, Ain|Seyssel]] where it had to be off-loaded and carried by [[mule]] train inland to the little village of Regonfle near Geneva, where it rejoined a waterway.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Braudel|1982|p= 353}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the [[early modern Europe|early modern period]] in Europe, [[Fernand Braudel]] remarked that in spite of the flux and reflux of economics:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"no salt mine was ever abandoned and the scale of the equipment needed put these mines in the hands of merchants from very early days. Salt-marshes on the other hand, were exploited by artisanal methods: the merchants took control only of transport and marketing, both in [[Setúbal]] in [[Portugal]] and in [[Aigues-Mortes|Peccais]] in [[Languedoc]]. Salt marketing was probably quite big business along the Atlantic seabord&lt;ref&gt;[[Brouage]] and [[Bourgneuf, Charente-Maritime|Bourgneuf]] were specialised in the mass production of sea salt, according to {{harvp|Braudel|1984|p= 208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Rhône]] valley."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Braudel|1982|pp=327f}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The vast interior of [[Poland]] was salt-starved, its maritime districts lying under rainy skies and fronting the [[Baltic Sea]]. By medieval times the process of mining for fossil salt supplemented the age-old techniques of evaporating [[sea salt]] in tidal pans. By the 14th century, at [[Wieliczka Salt Mine|Wieliczka]] near [[Kraków]], Braudel reports that peasant extraction of salt from brine evaporated in large shallow iron pans had been eliminated by the early industrialisation of salt mining. "Galleries and shafts were now dug to a depth of 300 metres, and enormous winches powered by teams of horses brought blocks of salt to the surface. At its peak, production stood at 40,000 tons a year and the mines employed 3,000 workers. By 1368, the cooperation of the Polish state had been obtained."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Braudel|1982|p=322}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1975">'''Sittacene''' was an ancient region of [[Babylonia]] and [[Assyria]] situated about the main city of [[Sittace]].  [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in his ''Natural History'', Book 6, §§ 205-206, places Sittacene between [[Chalonitis]], [[Persis]] and [[Characene|Mesene]] and also between [[Arbelitis]] and [[Timeline of the name "Palestine"|Palestine]] (or that it also bore those names, ''id.'', vi. 27. s. 31).  Besides Sittace, [[Sabata (city)|Sabata]], and [[Antiochia in Sittacene|Antiochia]] are identified as important cities.  The district of Sittacene appears to have been called in later times '''Apolloniatis''' ([[Strabo]] xi. p. 524), and which adjoined the province of [[Susis]] (xv. p. 732). It is probably the same country which [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]] calls '''Satrapene''' (v. 2).

[[Alexander the Great]]'s forces marched through Sittacene on their way from [[Babylon]] to [[Susa]]. Curtius and [[Diodorus]] place Alexander's major reorganization of his forces between their reinforcement at Babylon and the campaign against Susa in Sittacene. (Curt. v. 1. 40-42, v. 2. 1–7; Diod. xvii. 65)&lt;ref&gt;[[Arrian]] places these at Susa (iii. 16. 10)&lt;/ref&gt; A depiction of the games which were held to boost morale became the subject of a famous painting in the collection of the [[Getty Museum]].[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=5748]

When Alexander the Great visited the region, he found a settlement of Greek Boeotians established there since the time of Xerxes' campaign against Greece. (Diod. 17, 110, 4-5).

The '''[[South West Africa]]n''' [[pound (currency)|pound]] was issued between the 1930s and 1959 by the [[Standard Bank of South Africa Limited]], Barclays Bank (Dominion, Colonial and Overseas), and [[Volkskas Limited]]. These notes circulated along with the [[South African pound]] notes of the [[South African Reserve Bank]] until 1961, when they were withdrawn and replaced with [[South African rand|Rand]] notes only. The South West African pound was pegged at par with the South African pound, which had replaced the [[South West African mark]] in 1918.

Sverker Arnolsson, Swedish Historian and humanist.

He was one of the most important Historians and Hispanists of the 20th century.
He was born in Sundsvall, February the 17th 1908, and died in Gotemburg, November the 10th 1959.
He started his career interested in Swedish military History but quickly got interested in the History of the Spanish Empire. He is most recognized for his work regarding The Spanish [[The Black Legend|Black Legend]].&lt;ref&gt;http://elpaseoeditorial.com/es/58-sverker-arnoldsson&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bio==
Arnoldsson got his PhD from Gotemburg University in 1937. His thesis, Svensk-fransk krigs- och fresdapolitik i Tyskland 1634-1636 (“The policy of war and peace Swedish-German in Germany 1634-1636”. Gotemburg, 1937), was based around the [[Thirty Years War]]. Initially, his main interest was Swedish History, but through his thesis work he got fascinated with the [[Spanish Empire]].
Arnolsson was particularly interested in written expressions of history, such as archives, poems, and propaganda. His interest in Hispanic culture was mainly focussed on culture and literature. He is one of the authors that explored the Spanish [[Black Legend]].

In 1937 got a position as assistant professor on that same year. In 1946 he compaginated his job as professor in the Vasa Institute of Gotemburg, and his collaboration with the Ibero-American institute. 
He won a Rockefeller scholarship to study in the Argentinan, Mexican, and USA´s National Archives. This work was followed by various studies in Spain and Portugal in 1954 and 1958. 
His work during that time got him special recognition in Europe. In 1958 he was invited to Spain as a special Speaker during the celebration of the IV centenary of the death of Charles V.
He became member of the National Academy of History of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;Morner, Magnus. "Obituary Notes. Sverkel Arnoldsson." Jstor. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2509796?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thermoluminescence dating''' ('''TL''') is the determination, by means of measuring the accumulated [[radiation]] dose, of the time elapsed since material containing [[crystal]]line minerals was either [[heat]]ed ([[lava]], [[ceramic]]s) or exposed to sunlight ([[sediment]]s). As a crystalline material is heated during measurements, the process of  [[thermoluminescence]] starts. Thermoluminescence emits a weak light signal that is proportional to the radiation dose absorbed by the material. It is a type of [[luminescence dating]].

The technique has wide application, and is relatively cheap at some US$300–700 per object; ideally a number of samples are tested.  Sediments are more expensive to date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smah.uow.edu.au/sees/facilities/UOW002896.html Thermoluminescence (TL) dating] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402114336/http://smah.uow.edu.au/sees/facilities/UOW002896.html |date=2015-04-02 }}, University of Wollongong, Australia; [http://daybreaknuclear.us/bortolot_faq.html Daybreak Corporation, FAQs]; [http://www.arch.ox.ac.uk/luminescence.html Oxford University]; [http://www.oxfordauthentication.com/ Oxford Authentification], see different prices depending on type&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction of a relatively significant amount of sample material is necessary, which can be a limitation in the case of artworks. The heating must have taken the object above 500° C, which covers most ceramics, although very high-fired [[porcelain]] creates other difficulties.  It will often work well with stones that have been heated by fire. The clay core of bronze sculptures made by [[lost wax casting]] can also be tested.&lt;ref name="Bortolot 2001"&gt;[http://daybreaknuclear.us/tlpaper.pdf "Thermoluminescence dating of art objects"], V.J. Bortolot, Daybreak Corporation; [http://www.coupdefoudre.com/CurrentArticle/Thermo.html "The Limits of TL", Michel Brent, ''Archaeology Magazine'', Volume 54, Number 1, January/February 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

Different materials vary considerably in their suitability for the technique, depending on several factors.  Subsequent irradiation, for example if an x-ray is taken, can affect accuracy, as will the "annual dose" of radiation a buried object has received from the surrounding soil. Ideally this is assessed by measurements made at the precise findspot over a long period. For artworks, it may be sufficient to confirm whether a piece is broadly ancient or modern (that is, authentic or a fake), and this may be possible even if a precise date cannot be estimated.&lt;ref name="Bortolot 2001" /&gt;

== Functionality ==
Natural crystalline materials contain imperfections: impurity [[ion]]s, stress dislocations, and other phenomena that disturb the regularity of the [[electric field]] that holds the [[atom]]s in the crystalline lattice together.  These imperfections lead to local humps and dips in the crystalline material's [[electric potential]]. Where there is a dip (a so-called "[[electron]] trap"), a free [[electron]] may be attracted and trapped.

The flux of ionizing radiation&amp;mdash;both from [[cosmic radiation]] and from natural [[radioactivity]]&amp;mdash;excites electrons from atoms in the [[crystal lattice]] into the [[conduction band]] where they can move freely.  Most excited electrons will soon recombine with lattice ions, but some will be trapped, storing part of the [[energy]] of the radiation in the form of trapped [[electric charge]] ('''Figure 1''').

Depending on the depth of the traps (the energy required to free an electron from them) the storage time of trapped electrons will vary as ''some traps are sufficiently deep to store charge for hundreds of thousands of years''.

== In practical use ==
In thermoluminescence dating, these long-term traps are used to determine the age of materials: When irradiated crystalline material is again heated or exposed to strong light, the trapped electrons are given sufficient energy to escape. In the process of recombining with a lattice ion, they lose energy and emit [[photon]]s (light [[quantum|quanta]]), detectable in the [[laboratory]].

The amount of light produced is proportional to the number of trapped electrons that have been freed which is in turn proportional to the radiation dose accumulated. In order to relate the signal (the thermoluminescence&amp;mdash;light produced when the material is heated) to the radiation dose that caused it, it is necessary to [[calibrate]] the material with known doses of radiation since the [[density]] of traps is highly variable.

Thermoluminescence dating presupposes a "zeroing" event in the history of the material, either heating (in the case of pottery or lava) or exposure to sunlight (in the case of sediments), that removes the pre-existing trapped electrons. Therefore, at that point the thermoluminescence signal is zero.

As time goes on, the ionizing radiation field around the material causes the trapped electrons to accumulate ('''Figure 2'''). In the laboratory, the accumulated radiation dose can be measured, but this by itself is insufficient to determine the time since the zeroing event.

The ''Radiation Dose Rate'' - the dose accumulated per year-must be determined first. This is commonly done by measurement of the [[alpha particle|alpha radioactivity]] (the [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] content) and the [[potassium]] content (K-40 is a [[beta particle|beta]] and [[gamma ray|gamma]] emitter) of the sample material.

Often the [[gamma radiation]] field at the position of the sample material is measured, or it may be calculated from the alpha radioactivity and potassium content of the sample environment, and the [[cosmic ray]] dose is added in.  Once all components of the radiation field are determined, the accumulated dose from the thermoluminescence measurements is divided by the dose accumulating each year, to obtain the years since the zeroing event.

== Relation to radiocarbon dating ==
Thermoluminescence dating is used for material where [[radiocarbon dating]] is not available, like [[sediment]]s. Its use is now common in the authentication of old ceramic wares, for which it gives the approximate date of the last firing. An example of this can be seen in [http://www.antiquity.ac.uk/ant/079/ant0790390.htm Rink and Bartoll, 2005].

Thermoluminescence dating was modified for use as a ''passive sand migration analysis tool'' by [http://www.jcronline.org/perlserv/?request=get-abstract&amp;doi=10.2112%2F04-0406.1 Keizars, ''et al.'', 2008] ('''Figure 3'''), demonstrating the direct consequences resulting from the improper replenishment of starving beaches using fine sands, as well as providing a ''passive'' method of policing [[beach nourishment|sand replenishment]] and observing riverine or other sand inputs along shorelines ('''Figure 4''').

[[File:Quartz UV NET NTL Curve.svg|thumb|Typical quartz TL curve measured with a UV filter during routine TL dating.]]

== Relation to other luminescence dating methods==
[[Optically stimulated luminescence]] dating is a related measurement method which replaces heating with exposure to intense light.  The sample material is illuminated with a very bright source of green or blue light (for [[quartz]]) or [[infrared light]] (for [[potassium feldspars]]).  [[Ultraviolet light]] emitted by the sample is detected for measurement.

__NOTOC__

This is a '''timeline of Roman history''', comprising important legal and territorial changes and political events in the [[Roman Kingdom]] and [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]s.  To read about the background of these events, see [[Ancient Rome]] and [[History of the Byzantine Empire]].

Following tradition, this timeline marks the deposition of [[Romulus Augustulus]] and the [[Fall of Constantinople]] as the end of Rome in the west and east, respectively.  See [[Third Rome]] for a discussion of claimants to the succession of Rome.

This '''timeline of anti-Zionism''' chronicles the history of [[anti-Zionism]], including events in the history of anti-Zionist thought.

==1800–1896==
* 1828 – In London Edward Swaine published a Biblical exposition, ''Objections to the Doctrines of Israel's Future Restoration to Palestine, national pre-eminence, etc.''&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/objectionstodoc00swaigoog |title=Objections to the doctrines of Israel's future restoration to Palestine, national pre-eminence ... (1828) |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1880s – [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] regarded the emergence of Zionism as a threat, particularly for its secular character and redefinition of Jewishness. Through this decade, the Orthodox communities fought the Zionist idea of Jews as a people in search of a homeland, rather than being, for Judaism, a community awaiting redemption from the Messiah.

Failure to adopt the latter, or spiritual Zionism, meant compromising the Jewish ethical tradition.(pp.224-225). ‘I should much rather see the eternal people without a "National Home", because 'a Jewish Home in Palestine built up on bayonets and oppression is not worth having';(p.225) ‘one of his primary Zionist objectives' consisted in  'establishing the reputation of the Jewish nation as ethical.’(p.230); [[Edmond James de Rothschild|Baron Edmond de Rothschild]]  insisted to Magnes that 'We must hold them (the Arabs) down with a strong hand.'(p.235).&lt;/ref&gt;

** The French sociologist [[Georges Friedmann|Georges Philippe Friedmann]] (1902–1977) publishes ''The End of the Jewish People,'', in which he argues that the complete emancipation of the Jewish people signaled by both the creation of Israel and their assimilation of the West would lead to the demise of the Jewish people. Israel, he thought, challenging a basic assumption of both secular and religious Zionism, was a melting pot in which Israelization was bulldozing the differences of 102 Jewish subcultures.

Their focus on Israel is no evidence of double standards, but of where they feel their responsibilities lie." For Neumann, as for Rose these voices are needed more than every today, during the Jews' "dark night of the soul," as Rose calls it, because, in Neumann's words, "Israel's current policies are themselves a threat to Jews and Israelis everywhere."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2710">A '''vowel shift''' is a systematic [[sound change]] in the [[pronunciation]] of the [[vowel]] sounds of a [[language]].

The best-known example in the [[English language]] is the [[Great Vowel Shift]], which began in the 15th century. The [[Greek language]] also underwent a vowel shift near the beginning of the [[Common Era]], which included [[iotacism]]. Among the [[Semitic languages]], the [[Canaanite languages]] underwent a [[Canaanite shift|shift]] in which [[Proto-Semitic]] *ā became ō in Proto-Canaanite (a language likely very similar to [[Biblical Hebrew]]).

A vowel shift can involve a merger of two previously different sounds, or it can be a [[chain shift]].

==Examples==
One of the several major vowel shifts that is currently underway in the US is the [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]]. This change pattern is characterized by the longer and lower vowels moving forward and upward, while the shorter vowels move downward and backward. This vowel rotation, for example, is noticeable as the vowel sound in “coffee” is moving toward the vowel in “father.” While there are undoubtedly several other change patterns that define the shift in the Northern Cities, they are diffusing throughout the North in a unique manner, and are inherently different from dialect shifts taking place in other regions.

In addition to the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, the dialect change patterns that are taking place in the South also indicate undeniable pronunciation changes in the region. In contrast to the changes in the North, however, the Southern Cities Vowel Shift is characterized by the shorter, front vowels moving upward and adopting the characteristics of traditionally longer vowels. To exemplify this Southern vowel change, the vowel in the word “bed” is commonly used, as the “e” moves upward and gains a glide and causes the word to be pronounced more like “bayd.”

'''Walter Anthony Rodney''' (23 March 1942 &amp;ndash; 13 June 1980) was a prominent [[Guyana|Guyanese]] historian, political activist and academic. He was assassinated in 1980.

==Career==
{{Pan-African}}
Born into a [[working class|working-class]] family in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] in the then [[British Guiana]] (now [[Guyana]]), Walter Rodney was a bright student, attending [[Queen's College, Guyana|Queen's College]], where he became a champion debater and athlete, and then attending university on a scholarship at the [[University College of the West Indies]] (UCWI) in [[Jamaica]], graduating in 1963 with a first-class degree in History, thereby winning the Faculty of Arts prize.

Rodney earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in African History in 1966 at the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies]] in [[London]], [[England]], at the age of 24. His dissertation, which focused on the [[slave trade]] on the Upper [[Guinea]] Coast, was published by the [[Oxford University Press]] in 1970 under the title ''A History of the Upper Guinea Coast 1545-1800'' and was widely acclaimed for its originality in challenging the conventional wisdom on the topic.

Rodney traveled widely and became very well known internationally as an [[activist]], [[scholar]] and formidable orator. He taught at the [[University of Dar es Salaam]] in [[Tanzania]] during the period 1966-67 and later in Jamaica at his alma mater [[University of the West Indies]] in [[Mona, Jamaica|Mona]]. He was sharply critical of the [[middle class]] for its role in the [[History of the Caribbean#Independence|post-independence Caribbean]]. He was also a strong critic of [[capitalism]] and argued for a socialist development template.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

On 15 October 1968 the government of Jamaica, led by prime minister [[Hugh Shearer]], declared Rodney ''[[persona non grata]]''. The decision to ban him from ever returning to Jamaica and his subsequent dismissal by the University of the West Indies, Mona caused protests by students and the poor of [[West Kingston, Jamaica|West Kingston]] which escalated into a riot, known as the [[Rodney riots|Rodney Riots]], resulting in six deaths and causing millions of dollars in damages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The riots which started on 16 October 1968 triggered an increase in political awareness across the Caribbean, especially among the Afrocentric [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] sector of Jamaica, documented in Rodney's book ''The Groundings with my Brothers'' published by [[Bogle-L'Ouverture Publications]] in 1969.

In 1969, Rodney returned to the University of Dar es Salaam, where he served as a Professor of History until 1974.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal

 |title=Walter Rodney and Black Power: Jamaican Intelligence and US Diplomacy
 |author=Michael O. West
 |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodney became a prominent [[Pan-Africanist]], and was important in the [[Black Power]] movement in the [[Caribbean]] and North America. While living in [[Dar es Salaam]] he was influential in developing a new centre of African learning and discussion.

==Later life==

In 1974 Rodney returned to [[Guyana]] from Tanzania. He was due to take up a position as a professor at the [[University of Guyana]] but the Guyanese government prevented his appointment. Increasingly active in politics, he founded the [[Working People's Alliance]], a party that provided the most effective and credible opposition to the [[People's National Congress (Guyana)|PNC]] government. In 1979 he was arrested and charged with [[arson]] after two government offices were burned.

==Assassination==
On 13 June 1980, Rodney  was killed in Georgetown, at the age of thirty-eight, by a bomb in his car, a month after returning from celebrations during the [[History of Zimbabwe#Independence and the 1980s|independence in Zimbabwe]] in a time of intense political activism. He was survived by his wife, Patricia, and three children. His brother, Donald Rodney, who was injured in the explosion, said that a sergeant in the [[Guyana Defence Force]], named Gregory Smith, had given Walter the bomb that killed him. After the killing Smith fled to [[French Guiana]], where he died in 2002.

It is widely believed, but not proven, that the assassination was set up by then-President [[Linden Forbes Burnham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegrenadarevolutiononline.com/rodney.html "Walter Rodney &amp;#91;1942-1980&amp;#93;"], The [[Grenada Revolution]] Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/2012/06/16/the-grand-betrayals-of-walter-rodney/ "The grand betrayals of Walter Rodney",] ''[[Kaieteur News]]'', 16 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Rodney believed that the various ethnic groups that had been historically disenfranchised by the ruling colonial class should work together, which was in conflict with Burnham.&lt;ref&gt;Anon, 2002, [http://www.landofsixpeoples.com/news022/ns211247.htm "Gregory Smith dead, reports say"], ''[[Stabroek News]]'', 24 November 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2015, a Commission of Inquiry (COI) was held during which a new witness, Holland Gregory Yearwood, came forward claiming to be a longstanding friend of Rodney and a former member of the WPA. Yearwood testified that Rodney presented detonators to him weeks prior to the explosion asking for assistance in assembling a bomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://guyanachronicle.com/rodney-hearing-takes-dramatic-twist-new-witness-tells-of-attempted-cover-up-of-smiths-role-how-roopnaraine-kwayana-distorted-the-truth/ |work=Guyana Chronicle| title= Rodney hearing takes dramatic twist. New witness tells of attempted cover up|date=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic influence==
Rodney's most influential book was ''[[How Europe Underdeveloped Africa]]'', published in 1972. In it he described an [[Africa]] that had been consciously exploited by [[Europe]]an [[imperialism|imperialists]], leading directly to the modern [[underdevelopment]] of most of the continent. The book became enormously influential as well as controversial: it was groundbreaking in that it was among the first to bring a new perspective to the question of underdevelopment in Africa. Rodney's analysis went far beyond the previously accepted approach in the study of [[Third World]] underdevelopment.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Instead of being interested primarily in the inter-relations of African trade and politics, as many of us were at that time, Walter Rodney focused his attention on the agricultural basis of African communities, on the productive forces within them and on the processes of social differentiation. As a result, his research raised a whole set of fresh questions concerning the nature of African social institutions on the Upper Guinea coast in the sixteenth century and of the impact of the Atlantic slave trade. In doing so, he helped to open up a new dimension. Almost immediately he stimulated much further writing and research on West Africa, and he initiated a debate, which still continues and now extends across the whole range of African history.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When teaching at the Universities of Dar es Salaam and the West Indies, he launched and sustained a large number of discussion groups which swept up and embraced many who had had little or no formal education. As a writer, he reached out to contact thousands in ''The Groundings with my Brothers'' (1969) and in his influential ''How Europe Underdeveloped Africa'' (1972)." — Remarks by Professor John Richard Gray, ''[[History Today]]'', Vol. 49, Issue 9, 1980.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"When we think of Walter Rodney as a Revolutionary Scholar we are talking about two things, Radical Scholar and his revolutionary contribution to the study of History ie. History of Africa. Walter Rodney was a pioneering scholar who provided new answers to old questions and posed new questions in relation to the study of Africa." — Remarks by Professor Winston McGowan at the Walter Rodney Commemorative Symposium held at York College, USA, in June 2010.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Walter Rodney was no captive intellectual playing to the gallery of local or international radicalism. He was clearly one of the most solidly ideologically situated intellectuals ever to look colonialism and its contemporary heir black opportunism and exploitation in the eye" — Remarks by [[Wole Soyinka]], Oduduwa Hall, [[University of Ife]], [[Nigeria]], Friday, 27 June 1980.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rodney's community-grounded approach to mass education during the 1960s and his detailed descriptions of his pedagogical approach in ''Groundings'' (1969) document his role as an important critical pedagogue and contemporary of [[Paulo Freire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vaught|first=Seneca|title='Grounding' Walter Rodney in Critical Pedagogy: Toward Praxis in African History|journal=South|year=2015|volume=1|issue=1|pages=4–5|url=https://www.academia.edu/18277791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Yagutil Mishiev was born on March 29, 1927 in Qırmızı Qəsəbə (English: Red Town - a village and municipality in the [[Quba Rayon|Quba Rayon of Azerbaijan, USSR]]). In 1943 he finished school because of the need for teachers and was sent to complete teachers courses. In that same year, in September, at 16 years old, he started teaching in school.&lt;ref name="roots"&gt;Y.I. Mishiev - ''Our roots.'' ({{lang-ru|Я. И. Мишиев - «Наши корни»}}). Published in 2008, [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Russia]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, he completed a diploma program using methods of distance learning with a degree from The Kuban Pedagogical College, Kuba, Azerbaijan. In 1945, while working at a school, he started a math degree at the Kuban Pedagogical Institute. In 1947, he attained a diploma of a teacher of physics and mathematics.

From 1943 to 1951, he actively helped the board of the municipality of [[Quba|Kuba]], Azerbaijan to prepare documents to award a medal to those who worked on the labor front of [[World War II]]. The medal is called ''Doblisneye Trud'', valiant work during World War II from 1941–1945. In 1946, he was asked by the head of the [[Quba|Kuba]] military enlistment office to complete a census of veterans in order to be able to award them the medal entitled ''[[Medal For the Victory Over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945|For the Victory Over Germany in the Great Patriotic War 1941–1945]]''. In 1951, the Mishiev family moved to Derbent, a city in the Dagestan Republic of Russia. From 1954, Yagutil Mishiev worked as a teacher of mathematics in ''The School for Working Youth'', also titled School №1. In 1963, he got a master's degree of a math teacher from Dagestan State University. For many years, Mishiev worked as the director of the Museum of Regional Studies. Mishiev also collected unique materials of the history of the city. From 1976 to 1991, Mishiev worked as the principal of School №11 in Derbent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vatan.etnosmi.ru/one_stat.php?id=8256 M. Karina. —  M. Karina. - ''Dreams of [[Derbent]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; From 1991 to 1997, Yagutil Israelovich Mishiev worked as a chief specialist in the City Department of Education.

Since 1997, Mishiev resides in [[Rishon LeZion|Rishon Letzion]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stmegi.net/Common_Public/NewsPost.aspx?pst=597&amp;p=8&amp;c=15&amp;so=2 |title=Elkhan Shaul 07/28/2011 - '&amp;#39;Yagutil Mishiev'&amp;#39; |publisher=Stmegi.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vatan.etnosmi.ru/one_stat.php?id=6130 |title=Journal of Vatan.

Translated from Russian to Tat - May Boruhova |publisher=Vatan.etnosmi.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, Mishiev has written several books about the history and the historical architectural monuments of the city of Derbent. His titles include ''A Long Road of 5000 Years'' and ''Derbent and [[Civilization|World Civilization]]''. Also, he wrote a ''Russian-English Dictionary of Mathematical Terms''. That work was written for pupils, students, teachers and parents.&lt;ref&gt;2000 words and terms.&lt;/ref&gt; A book ''Our Roots'', Mishiev wrote a record of his family and their doings. His latest book, ''Only memory does not get old'' was devoted to the history of Jewish civilization.&lt;ref name="memory"&gt;Y.I. Mishiev - ''Only memory does not get old.'' ({{lang-ru|Я. И. Мишиев - «Только память не стареет»}}).  Published in 2014, [[Makhachkala]], [[Dagestan]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum of Regional Studies==

In 1952, the Commission of the Ministry of Culture of Russia ordered the closure of the museum of regional studies because the exhibits did not meet the minimum requirements for a particular historical period as laid out by the Ministry for a museum. Recommendations were made for certain changes, after which the museum could reopen.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;Y.I. Mishiev - ''Derbent and World Civilization.'' ({{lang-ru|Я. И. Мишиев - «Дербент и мировая цивилизация»}}). Published in 2005, [[Rostov-on-Don]], [[Russia]].&lt;/ref&gt; It was necessary for new leadership of the museum. The Department of Culture of the city of Derbent sent Mishiev to work on the museum. Mishiev started to create a new exposition. In 1953, the museum was able to re-open. Working for years in the museum, Mishiev traveled around the [[Derbentsky District|Derbent District]] to collect unique materials and information about the history of the city. He studied the archives of the city of Derbent as well as the [[Azerbaijan State Museum of History]] in [[Baku]] and also in The Regional Museum of Dagestan in [[Makhachkala]]. Soon, scholars of Dagestan, the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the USSR]] and the [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]] started to inquire on various issues related to the museum.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt; In the second half the 50s, the museum started to promote the history of the historic city of Derbent and educate people about it. Mishiev conducted lectures and regularly appeared in the pages of the city’s newspaper titled ''Znamya Kommunizma'', (The Banner of Communism) as well as in the regional newspaper titled Leninchi, written in the [[Azerbaijani language]]. The museum work that started in 1952 became a part of his life.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Zlatko Hasanbegović was born on 14 June 1973 in [[Zagreb]] to Zumreta Hasanbegović (née Prohić) from [[Gračanica, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Gračanica]] and Ibrahim Hasanbegović from [[Gradiška, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosanska Gradiška]]. His mother's side of the family moved from Gračanica (modern day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]) to the Croatian capital of Zagreb in 1941. His maternal grandfather, Sabrija Prohić, was a rich industrialist with properties across the former [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].

Deputy Parliament Speaker and professor of constitutional law [[Robert Podolnjak]] from the governing [[Bridge of Independent Lists]] party, among many others, posited that anti-fascism is founded in the Croatian Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/antifasizam-jest-temelj-ustava-a-registar-izdajnika-neprihatljiv-oni-ce-to-to-morati-objasniti-javnosti-1054335|title=Antifašizam jest temelj Ustava, a registar izdajnika je neprihatljiv. Oni će to&lt;!--sic erat scriptum--&gt; to morati objasniti javnosti|work=vecernji.hr|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hasanbegović said that his remarks about anti-fascism were related to the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] totalitarian legacy and [[Titoism]]:&lt;ref name=vecernji&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/hrvatska/zlatko-hasanbegovic-ako-na-internetu-pise-da-sam-ubio-kennedya-to-ne-znaci-da-je-to-istina-1054133|title=Hasanbegović: Ako na internetu piše da sam ubio Kennedyja, ne znači da je to istina|work=vecernji.hr|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "All who abuse the notion of anti-fascism, which can be fluid, as is well-known to historians, know that various meanings can be attributed to that notion. [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]], [[Pol Pot]] and also U.S. General [[George S. Patton|Patton]] were anti-fascists. Everyone knows that those were different persons. We are not talking about abstract anti-fascism but about the particular Yugoslav Communist totalitarian legacy."&lt;ref name="EBL News"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eblnews.com/news/croatia/culture-minister-nominee-says-exposed-ideological-lynching-7401|title=Culture Minister nominee says he is being exposed to an "ideological lynching"|work=EBL News|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Culture Minister===
On 22 January 2016, Hasanbegović was appointed as Minister of Culture by [[Prime Minister of Croatia|Prime Minister]] [[Tihomir Orešković]]. A part of the cultural workers expressed their dissatisfaction mainly due to his comments about anti-fascism and his lack of experience in management of culture. Civic initiative ''Platform 112'', which brings together 70 [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, held a protest in front of the Parliament on the day when the new Government was approved, urging MPs to vote against the [[Cabinet of Tihomir Orešković]] because of Hasanbegović.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrt.hr/318511/vijesti/platforma-112-uputila-otvoreno-pismo-mandataru-oreskovicu|title=Pred Saborom prosvjed protiv Hasanbegovića i Crnoje|work=hrt.hr|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Croatian Journalists' Association]] issued a statement in which they strongly opposed the nomination of Hasanbegovic as Minister of Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HND, Platform 112 against nomination of Hasanbegovic as culture minister|url=https://eblnews.com/news/croatia/hnd-platform-112-against-nomination-hasanbegovic-culture-minister-7352|website = EBL News|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Israel]]-based [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] urged the Croatian government to dismiss Hasanbegović, saying he took a disdainful attitude towards Croatian resistance to fascism during World War Two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Nazi centre urges dismissal of Croatia's culture minister|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-croatia-minister-idUKKCN0VE2MI|website=Reuters UK|accessdate=14 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Croatian Helsinki Committee]] (HHO) and the ''Initiative EU 1481'' of ''[[Matica hrvatska]]'' dismissed the accusations against Hasanbegović as unfounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eblnews.com/news/croatia/some-associations-against-some-ministers-culture-war-veterans-7406|title=Some associations against, some for ministers of culture, war veterans|work=EBL News|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eblnews.com/news/croatia/hho-dismisses-accusations-against-new-culture-minister-7848|title=HHO dismisses accusations against new culture minister|work=EBL News|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eblnews.com/news/croatia/corps-internet-journalists-backs-culture-ministers-decision-8441|title=Corps of Internet Journalists backs culture minister's decision|work=EBL News|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasanbegović stated that the protests against him were not supported by any facts but based on a selective use of his different statements.&lt;ref name="EBL News"/&gt;

As one of his first moves as minister, Hasanbegović announced that there is no need for the continuation of government funding of any non-profit media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eblnews.com/news/croatia/minister-says-no-need-nonprofit-media-commisison-9156|title=Minister says no need for nonprofit media commission|work=EBL News|accessdate=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Federation of Journalists|International]] and [[European Federation of Journalists|European Federations of Journalists]] joined their affiliates in Croatia, the HND and the Trade Union of Croatian Journalists (Sinoh) in condemning this decision, as well as the Hasanbegović's dissolution of the Expert Committee for non-profit media before the end of its mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Croatia: governmental attacks on Media Freedom|url=http://europeanjournalists.org/blog/2016/02/12/croatia-governmental-attacks-on-media-freedom|website=europeanjournalists.org|accessdate=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the new budget for 2016, the Croatian government stopped funding certain cultural projects and non-profit media, which Hasanbegović described as "racket money", adding that tax-payers' money will no longer be distributed in a non-transparent way for neither the left-wing nor right-wing media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eblnews.com/news/croatia/culture-minister-warns-srebrenica-genocide-negator-criticises-croatia-20217|title=Culture minister warns Srebrenica genocide negator criticises Croatia|work=EBL News|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, he signed a cooperation deal with [[Hungary]]'s Minister [[Zoltán Balog (politician)|Zoltán Balog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eblnews.com/news/culture/hungary-and-croatia-ink-cultural-cooperation-deal-22442|title=Hungary and Croatia ink cultural cooperation deal|work=EBL News|date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 17th electoral convention of the HDZ, Hasanbegović was elected to the HDZ Presidency and received most votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eblnews.com/news/croatia/hdz-gets-new-presidency-milijan-brkic-elected-karamarkos-deputy-23052|title=HDZ gets new presidency, Milijan Brkic elected Karamarko's deputy|work=EBL News|date=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Croatian Parliament supported motion of no confidence against Prime Minister Orešković, his whole Cabinet resigned while the Parliament dismissed itself which led to new election. On [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2016|2016 parliamentary election]], Hasanbegović was elected to the Parliament as HDZ's candidate. In the aftermath, newly elected president of HDZ [[Andrej Plenković]] formed a new government with new culture minister being [[Nina Obuljen Koržinek]] and not Hasanbegović for which he expressed his dissatisfaction.

===Later political career===
In May 2017, Hasanbegović decided to participate in the [[Zagreb local elections, 2017|Zagreb local elections]] on the independent list of [[Bruna Esih]], who ran against the official HDZ candidate. Hasanbegović also criticized the HDZ leader Andrej Plenković, saying that his path "is wrong and leads to moral quagmire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.total-croatia-news.com/politics/18790-path-chosen-by-plenkovic-is-wrong-and-leads-to-moral-quagmire|title=“Path Chosen by Plenković Is Wrong and Leads to Moral Quagmire”|work=Total Croatia News|date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HDZ soon announced that Hasanbegović was evicted from the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.total-croatia-news.com/politics/18796-hasanbegovic-evicted-from-hdz|title=Hasanbegović Evicted from HDZ|work=Total Croatia News|date=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The independent list won 8,23% of the vote in the local election and Hasanbegović became a member of the [[Zagreb Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dnevnik.hr/vijesti/hrvatska/lokalni-izbori-2017-ovdje-saznajte-prve-rezultate-izbora-za-grad-zagreb---477126.html|title=Bruna Esih slavi, otkrila hoće li dati podršku Milanu Bandiću|date=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the elections, Hasanbegović and Esih formed a new political party, the [[Independents for Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/globus/Globus-politika/osnivaci-nove-desne-stranke-iznose-svoj-plan-hasanbegovic-i-esih-mi-smo-autohtona-nacionalna-platforma-bit-cemo-ono-sto-je-hdz-trebao-biti/6245306|title=OSNIVAČI NOVE DESNE STRANKE IZNOSE SVOJ PLAN Hasanbegović i Esih: 'Mi smo autohtona nacionalna platforma, bit ćemo ono što je HDZ trebao biti'|publisher=Jutarnji list}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new party formed a majority in the assembly with the incumbent mayor [[Milan Bandić]], on condition that the name of Zagreb’s Marshal Tito Square was changed to [[Republic of Croatia Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vecernji.hr/zagreb/milan-bandic-pristao-je-na-uvjet-zlatka-hasanbegovica-i-brune-esih-1178914|title=Milan Bandić pristao je na uvjet Zlatka Hasanbegovića i Brune Esih|publisher=Večernji list|date=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
In 1996, Hasanbegović wrote at least two articles in the magazine "The Independent State of Croatia", named after the fascist [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH), in which he glorified the [[Ustashe]] as heroes and martyrs.&lt;ref name=about2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eblnews.com/news/croatia/minister-say-photo-yet-another-attempt-vilify-him-9801|title=Minister say photo yet another attempt to vilify him|work=EBL News|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was edited by the far-right [[Croatian Liberation Movement]] (HOP) and Hasanbegović was described as a young HOP member in it. Commenting on his texts from 1996 twenty years later, Hasanbegović said that the crimes of the Ustashe were "the biggest moral lapse" of the Croatian people in their history, adding: "Using totally peripheral statements I made as a student more than 20 years ago and taking them out of context is nothing but political manipulation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eblnews.com/news/croatia/hasanbegovic-ustasha-crimes-biggest-moral-lapse-history-croatian-people-9890|title=Hasanbegovic: Ustasha crimes biggest moral lapse in history of Croatian people|work=EBL News|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also denied that he was ever a member of the Croatian Liberation Movement.&lt;ref name="vecernji" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EBL News"/&gt;

In 1993, Hasanbegović posed for a photo in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] at an event of the 9th Battalion of the [[Croatian Defence Forces]] (HOS), the [[Croatian Party of Rights]]' paramilitary (1991-1992), wearing a cap with what is allegedly an [[Ustashe Militia]] badge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.total-croatia-news.com/politics/2435-croatian-minister-of-culture-hasanbegovic-s-perceived-past-ustasha-sympathies-dominate-national-media|title=Croatian Minister of Culture Hasanbegovic's Perceived Past Ustasha Sympathies Dominate National Media|work=Total Croatia News|date=11 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hockenos, Paul, [https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/05/06/croatias-far-right-weaponizes-the-past-ustase-hasanbegovic "Croatia’s Far Right Weaponizes the Past"], ''Foreign Policy'', 6 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph's resurfacing in 2016 and its circulation in the Croatian media caused major backlash. Hasanbegović denied he was wearing an Ustashe cap, claiming the photo had been manipulated and that he wore a black cap of the HOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.24sata.hr/news/fotografija-hasanbegovic-je-pozirao-s-ustaskom-kapom-460658|title=Hasanbegović: Na slici sam ja, kapa nije ustaška već HOS-ova|work=24sata.hr|date=10 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar or identical cap, with an Ustashe badge, was worn by some members of the 9th HOS Battalion during their gatherings in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portalnovosti.com/hos-ova-kapa|title=HOS-ova kapa|work=Novosti|date=13 Feb 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Čedomilj Mijatović''' (or '''Chedomille Mijatovich''', also spelled '''Mijatovitch''', '''Miyatovich''' and '''Miyatovitch'''. His first name was often abbreviated in his publications to '''Chedo''' or '''Cheda''', {{lang-sr-cyr|italic=yes|Чедомиљ Мијатовић}}, October 6/18, 1842 – May 14, 1932) was a Serbian [[politician|statesman]], economist, historian, writer, politician, diplomat and one of the leaders of the [[Serbian Progressive Party (historical)|Progressive Party]]. He was six times minister of Finance in the Principality/Kingdom of [[Serbia]], three time minister of foreign affairs and minister plenipotentiary in [[Serbia]] to the [[Court of St James's]] (1884–1885; 1895–1900, and 1902/1903), to [[Romania]] (1894), and the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1900). He is one of the most important liberals in history of Serbian politics. Mijatović's authority as a writer on [[Serbia]] is universally acknowledged, and he had contributed largely to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Ninth Edition (1875–1889) and Eleventh Edition (1911).

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

His father Milan (1805–1852) was a lawyer who came to [[Serbia]] from southern [[Austrian Empire]] and became a teacher of Latin, history and geography in [[Belgrade]]'s First Gymnasium (Grammar School). However, Čedomilj Mijatović was primarily influenced by his mother, Rakila Kristina (1826–1901), who was of mixed [[Serbs|Serbian]]-Spanish origin.

Mijatović studied a combination of economic courses and sciences in [[Munich]], Zurich and [[Leipzig]] between 1863 and 1865 and completed his education by gaining experience from the National Bank of Austria and Kredit Anstalt in [[Vienna]]. During his studies in Germany he met his future British wife [[Elodie Lawton]] (1825–1908), previously a dedicated abolitionist in [[Boston]], who influenced him significantly, and turned him into a devoted Anglophile. She was the first English-speaking female historian in [[Serbia]] and she published ''The History of Modern Serbia'' in 1872. Later she published a collection of Serbian folk short stories and a collection of Serbian epic poems.&lt;ref&gt;Elodie Lawton Mijatovics, ''The History of Modern Serbia'' (London: William Tweedie, 1872); (Elodie Lawton Mijatovics), ''Serbian Folk-lore. Popular tales selected and translated by Madam Csedomilj Mijatovics'' (London: W. Isbister &amp; Co, 1874); Madame Elodie Lawton Mijatovics, ''Kosovo: an Attempt to bring Serbian National Songs, about the Fall of the Serbian Empire at the Battle of Kosovo, into one Poem'' (London: W. Isbister, 1881).&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 23 he became a professor at the [[Belgrade Higher School|Belgrade's Grande École]], the highest educational institution in Serbia of that age. He taught political economy and wrote three very influential textbooks, two of which were based on [[Lorenz von Stein]]. In these works he demonstrated his affinity for liberal economy and influenced many later Serbian economists to take similar positions. As a professor he started campaigning in favour of building a railway through Serbia. He gained many supporters among merchants and educated men for this idea, but many opposed him in [[Serbia]] during this campaign. He was also the earliest critique of communist and socialist utopian ideas in [[Serbia]]. His translation of [[Henry Thomas Buckle]]'s book ''History of Civilisation in England'', was published in Serbian in 1871 and influenced several generations of pro-Western [[Serbs]].

===Efforts to reform the Serbian Orthodox Church===

Miјatović's wife was a member of the [[Wesleyan Methodist Church (Great Britain)|Wesleyan Church]] and was able to imbue her husband with nonconformist religious devotion. However, he always remained faithful to the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] but wanted to bring some religious zeal into it. That was not a very popular task in Serbia of his time. He found a collaborator in this endeavour in the person of a Belgrade priest Aleksa Ilić who established a religious monthly ''Hrishchanski Vesnik'' (''Christian Messenger'', in Serbian Cyrillic: ''Хришћански весник''), the first journal dedicated to religious revival in Serbia. A Scottish philanthropist [[Francis Mackenzie]] who settled in [[Belgrade]] helped this project materially and Miјatović remained one of the main contributors of the journal.

He was the most active and influential Serbian translator from English during the 19th century. The bibliography of his translations includes about a dozen titles. Most of them deal with religious topics. That was his effort to contribute to religious revival. His translations into Serbian include: sermons of well-known British preachers such as Dr. [[Charles Haddon Spurgeon]], Canon [[Henry Parry Liddon]] and Dr. Macduff. He also translated [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'' and Dr. David Brown's ''Commentaries to the Gospels''.

===Miјatović as cabinet minister===

At the age of thirty-one he was already Minister of Finance at the end of 1873. He started his career as a protégé of the leader of the subsequent Liberal Party, [[Jovan Ristić]], but soon joined the club of so-called young conservatives who turned into a kind of the personal party of the Serbian ruler, Prince [[Milan I of Serbia|Milan Obrenović]] (Prince from 1868, and King from 1882 till 1889). In the Government of Jovan Marinović, from November 1873 till December 1874 he was Minister of Finance for the second time and in that capacity he was instrumental in bringing important reforms. He introduced the metric system to Serbia. Serbia joined the Latin Monetary Union and he baptised the new domestic currency, the ''dinar'', after mediaeval Serbian silver coins. He always considered his most important achievement in this government the law stipulating the amount of property that had to be left to peasants, and could not be confiscated to cover their debts. This minimal amount included peasant's house, a yoke of oxen, the plough, and five acres of land. He was elected for the third time as Minister of Finance in the Government of Danilo Stefanović (Stefanović) in 1875.

The group of young conservatives he joined established the newspaper ''Videlo'' and soon came to power in October 1880. In the Government of Milan Piroćanac, Mijatović got two tenures. He was Minister of Foreign Affairs for the fourth time and Minister of Finance. Being a close friend of the ruler and in control of the two key ministries he was considered by many diplomats as the most influential person of this Cabinet. Prince Milan used him for the most significant missions. The two decisions that shaped Serbia's history for many years were carried out by Mijatović.
 [[File:Čedomilj Mijatović, Nova iskra 24 (1899).jpg|thumb|Photograph of Čedomilj Mijatović, published in ''Nova iskra'' 24 (1899).]]
When modern political parties were created in Serbia, in 1881, the Progressive Party turned out to be the only of the three Serbian parties (the other two being the mostly pro-Russian Liberal Party and very pro-Russian Radical Party) that was ready to make an agreement with Austria-Hungary, which became the most influential country in Serbia after the Congress of Berlin in 1878. The ruler decided to open a new page in Serbian foreign policy and arranged that a secret convention should be signed with the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. Mijatović was gradually entrusted by the ruler to complete this task and on June 28, 1881 he signed the Secret Convention by which Serbia got the diplomatic and political backing of the Habsburg Empire but abandoned her independence in the field of Foreign Policy. When the two other most prominent members of the Cabinet, Prime Minister Piroćanac and Home Minister Garašanin learned about the exact contents of the Convention they decided to resign but had to accept the new reality in the end. In return Mijatović had to resign his post as Minister of Foreign Affairs and kept only his tenure at the Ministry of Finance. His last act as Minister of Foreign Affairs was to sign a Consular Convention and a Commercial Agreement with the United States of America on October 14. 1881. During talks that preceded the signing of the Secret Convention Mijatović was well received in [[Vienna]] by the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Francis Joseph]] and other dignitaries of the Empire. The Emperor later decorated him with the first class of the Order of the Iron Crown, which entitled its bearer to become Austro-Hungarian count. Serbian citizens were banned by the Serbian constitution to accept any nobility titles. It is not clear if Mijatović ever officially submitted application to become an Austro-Hungarian count, yet he used this title openly since 1915, being the only Serb from the Kingdom of Serbia who did it.

===Affair with Union Général===

As the Minister of Finance Mijatović had to secure Serbia's commitments from the Berlin Treaty by which she undertook to build the part of the [[Vienna]]-[[Constantinople]] railway line that went through Serbia. Since Serbia could not finance the project herself a proper foreign creditor had to be found and a Parisian financial society called Union Général was selected in 1881. Unfortunately it faced bankruptcy as soon as the beginning of 1882, which brought the already shaky state of Serbian finances very close to complete disaster. Learning of the bankruptcy Mijatović urgently travelled to Paris and there supported by Austro-Hungarian diplomacy found a way out. Another financial house [[Comptoir National D'Escompte]] took on the projects without detriment to Serbia. In spite of this success the reputation of Mijatović's party suffered a serious blow and never recovered. It turned out that the agents of the Union Général in Belgrade had tried to bribe many MPs and politicians and the reputation of the Progressivists suffered the most from this. He took personal part in preparing a law on the establishment of the National Bank of Serbia that was passed by the Serbian Parliament in January 1883. He advocated establishment of such institution long before and had an opportunity to establish it during his tenure. The Government of the Progressivists resigned in October 1883.

===Negotiator of the Peace Treaty at Bucharest===

Being a lonely Serbian Anglophile Mijatović wished to be appointed as the first Serbian Minister in London, but had to wait until October 1884 when he became the second Serbian Minister at the [[Court of St James's]]. During this tenure he came into contact with many influential persons but his diplomatic post in London soon ended since he was appointed to be the sole Serbian negotiator in Bucharest where peace negotiations were scheduled following the Serbo-Bulgarian War. Serbia attacked Bulgaria on November 14, 1885 and within two weeks suffered a humiliating defeat. It was thanks to the Secret Convention signed with Austria-Hungary that Serbia was able to get out of the war without suffering more serious consequences. In [[Bucharest]] Miyatović and the Bulgarian representative [[Ivan Evstratiev Geshov]] concluded, on March 3, 1886, one of the shortest treaties in diplomatic history with one article only: „Article seul et unique. – L’état de paix qui a cessé d’exister entre le Royaume de Serbie et le Principauté du Bulgarie le 2–14 Novembre, 1885, est rétabli à partir de l’échange de ratification du present traité qui aura lieu à Bucharest.” Mijatović proved to be a peacemaker since he had ignored instructions from Belgrade that were prepared in such a way that he was supposed to find an excuse for new war. Apparently Mijatović was more worried about what sort of reputation he would have in England if negotiations failed than about criticism from Belgrade for his conciliatory approach.

===First self exile to London===

Having returned from Bucharest Mijatović became for the fifth time Finance Minister in the Government of Milutin Garašanin in 1886/1887. Finally in 1887/1889 he was for the second time Foreign Minister in the Government of Nikola Hristić (Hristić). In this capacity he signed renewal of the Secret Convention. However, the decision of King Milan to abdicate on March 6, 1889 effectively ended his special position at the Court. The new government encouraged persecution of the members of the Progressive Party. Faced with all these failures he decided to leave Serbia and withdrew to [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in September 1889.

He found refuge in London where he spent years between 1889 and 1894 and was committed to writing novels in Serbian based on gothic novels of [[Sir Walter Scott]] and historical works. Novels that he wrote in these years made him perhaps the most popular Serbian writer of his age. He added to his fame by publishing a book entitled ''On Conditions for Success'' [''О условима успеха''/''O uslovima uspeha''] in 1892 based on [[Samuel Smiles]]' bestseller ''Self-Help''. In Britain he became well known when he published a book on the last [[Byzantine]] Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Chedomil Mijatovich, ''Constantine the last Emperor of the Greeks; or the Conquest of Constantinople by the Turks (A. D. 1453). After the latest Historical Researches'' (London: Sampson Low, Marston and Co., 1892). The book was later translated into Russian and Spanish.&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to this book he was elected to be an honorary member of the [[Royal Historical Society]], being the first Serb to attain such a distinction. Some time earlier he had become the second President of the [[Serbian Royal Academy]], in 1888, but he resigned this post in 1889. It was in London, where Mijatović obtained introductions to the most celebrated writers in Britain, and became a contributor to the Encyclopædia Britannica.

===Diplomatic career===

In 1894 he returned from his self-exile to become Minister of Finance for the sixth and last time, but his tenure ended with the resignation of the whole Government after only two months in April 1894. He spent the rest of that year as a Serbian Minister in Bucharest but was recalled at the end of 1894. In April 1895 he got his favourite appointment. He became for the second time Serbian Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of St James's and kept this position until 1900. During this mandate he represented Serbia at the [[Hague Peace Conference]] in May–July 1899 where he advocated very progressive views, but both [[Aleksandar Obrenović]] and the Serbian Government did not share his enthusiasm for the instruments of international law and international arbitration. In 1900 he was put in the most important diplomatic place for Serbia. He became Serbian Minister in [[Constantinople]] but was recalled since he did not agree with the marriage of the Serbian King Alexander with a lady who was a commoner and a widow. He became Serbian senator in 1901 and stayed in London trying to establish a Serbian Commercial Agency. At the end of 1902 he was appointed for the third time to be Serbian Minister in London.

In the early morning of June 11, 1903 a conspiracy of Serbian officers killed King Alexander Obrenović and his unpopular wife Queen Draga. Having murdered them they threw their naked bodies out of window. The new government consisted of regicides and it appointed [[Peter I of Serbia|Petar Karađorđević]] to be new ruler of Serbia. The very event and composition of the new Cabinet caused widespread condemnation throughout Europe but only Britain and the Netherlands decided to break off diplomatic relations with Serbia. Mijatović was himself horrified and he was the only Serbian diplomat who resigned his post on June 22. This act was never forgiven to him by influential political circles in Belgrade.

Mijatović's name became known around the world thanks to a clairvoyant session that he attended together with a famous Victorian journalist [[William Thomas Stead]]. The result of the clairvoyant session that took place on the night of March 20, 1903, in Stead's opinion was that 'the bloody tragedy in the palace was seen clairvoyantly three months before it took place, and described in the hearing of at least a dozen credible witnesses'.&lt;ref&gt;W. T. Stead, 'A Clairvoyant Vision of the Assassination at Belgrade', ''[[Review of Reviews]]'', vol. 28 (1903), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all the British dailies, as well as the American and continental press, commented on the prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Westminster Gazette'', June 11, 1903, p. 7 b; ''The New York Times'', June 12, 1903, p. 2 c ('A Clairvoyant's Prediction').&lt;/ref&gt; Later he was very much influenced by Stead and became a leading Serbian adherent of spiritism.

After the May Coup Mijatović stayed in London until the end of his life. In 1908 he published his most popular book in English that went through three British and three American editions entitled Servia and the Servians.&lt;ref&gt;Chedo Mijatovich, ''Servia and the Servians'' (London: Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, 1908). The second British edition: Chedo Mijatovich, ''Servia of the Servians'' (London: Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, 1911). The third British edition: Chedo Mijatovich, ''Servia of the Servians'' (London, Bath, New York and Melbourne: Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, 1915). American editions: Chedo Mijatovich, ''Servia and the Servians'' (Boston: L.C. Page &amp; company, 1908); Chedo Mijatovich, ''Servia of the Servians'' (New edit., New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1913); Chedo Mijatovich, ''Servia of the Servians'' (New ed., New York: Scribner, 1914).&lt;/ref&gt; His reputation in Serbia after 1903 suffered greatly due to false rumours that he was implicated in a conspiracy to bring [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn]], beloved son of [[Queen Victoria]], to the throne of Serbia. In 1911 he met King Peter Karageorgević in Paris and from this moment he was fully reconciled with the new regime in Serbia. Therefore, it is not surprising that he was considered as an unofficial member of the Serbian delegation in London during the London Conference in December 1912. Being a widower from 1908 he was considered as a favourite candidate of both the Serbian Government and the King to become the Archbishop of [[Skopje]], which had two years earlier been incorporated to the Serbian state. But these efforts failed.

He became very active again at the beginning of the [[First World War]]. He wrote many letters and articles to British dailies but his most remarkable action in this field was his visit to the United States and Canada. He was accompanied by the most famous British suffragette, [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], who championed the causes of Britain's small allies (Belgium and Serbia) during [[World War I]]. A visit to the [[United States of America]] and [[Canada]] with such a well-known person caused such a sensation, brought crowds to Mijatović's lectures, and enabled him to have well attended lectures and to give interviews to the leading dailies.&lt;ref&gt;"Serbia's Aged Envoy talks of his Nation", ''The New York Times'', January 23, 1916, p. SM 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in London on May 14, 1932.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', Monday, May 16, 1932, стр. 12, d ("Count Miyatovitch. Thrice Serbian Minister in London."); ''The Times'', Saturday, May 21, 1932, стр. 13, b ("Funeral and Memorial Services. Count Miyatovitch"). ''Cf''. "Count Miyatovitch, Serb diplomat dies: wrote “World’s Shortest Peace Treaty” in 1886 ending war between Serbia and Bulgaria”, ''The New York Times'', May 15, 1932, p. N5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works in English==

He published 19 books in Serbian, and 6 books in English: ''Constantine, the Last Emperor of the Greeks or the Conquest of Constantinople by the Turks (A.D. 1453)'', the first Serbian contribution to Byzantine history in English; after the ''Latest Historical Researches'' (London: Sampson Low, Marston &amp; Company, 1892); Ancestors of the House of Orange (1892);&lt;ref&gt;No sample is known to have survived of the book: ''Ancestors of the House of Orange'', 1892. The title is known from biographical lexicons: S. v. “Mijatovich, Chedomille”, ''Who Was Who 1929–1940, A Companion to Who’s Who containing the Biographies of those who Died during the Period 1929–1940'' (London: Adam and Charles Black, 1980), vol. III, p. 939; S. v. “Mijatovich, Tjedomil”, ''Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europeo-Americana'', tomo XXXV, Madrid, 1958, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Royal Tragedy. Being the Story of the Assassination of King Alexander and Queen Draga of Servia'' (London: Eveleigh Nash, 1906); ''Servia and the Servians'' (London: Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, 1908); Sir Donald Mackenzie Wallace, Prince Kropotkin, C. Mijatović, J. D. Bourchier, ''A Short History of Russia and the Balkan States'' (London: The Encyclopædia Britannica Company, 1914), and ''The Memoirs of a Balkan Diplomatist'' (London, New York, Toronto and Melbourne: Cassel and Co., 1917).

His book ''Servia and the Servians'' together with his entries on Serbia in the Tenth and Eleventh editions of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' served a very important purpose of offering a favourable view of Serbia to the Anglo-American public at the beginning of the twentieth century in a very turbulent and decisive period for Serbia. He was arguably among the first Serbs to contribute to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' and some of his entries were reproduced up until 1973. The other was [[Prince Bojidar Karageorgevitch]].

==Assessment==

His long life in Britain made him a cultural bridge between two nations. His role in British-Serbian relations in unmatched in terms of his influence on mutual relations. Many British Balkan experts were aware of this and had a very high opinion of Mijatović. [[James David Bourchier]], a correspondent of ''[[The Times]]'', remarked that "he is generally regarded by his fellow-countrymen as the most learned man in Servia."&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Bourchier, "The Great Servian Festival,” ''The Fortnightly Review'', vol. 46 (1889), p. 219; cf. Lady Grogan, The Life of J. D. Bourchier (London: Hurst and Blackett Ltd., 1926), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William T. Stead]], who met him during the Peace Conference in The Hague, was so delighted with him that he wrote: “It was almost worth while creating the Kingdom Servia if only to qualify Čedomilj Mijatovitch for a seat in the Parliament of the Nations.”&lt;ref&gt;W. T. Stead, “Members of the Parliament of Peace,”'' The Review of Reviews'', vol. 19 (1899), p. 533.&lt;/ref&gt; Stead also had such a high opinion of Mijatović as a diplomat that in 1903 he remarked: “He is far and away the best known, the most distinguished, and the most respected diplomatist the Balkan Peninsula has yet produced.”&lt;ref&gt;W. T. Stead, “A Clairvoyant Vision of the Assassinations at Belgrade,” ''The Review of Reviews'', vol. 28 (July 1903), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The leading British daily ''The Times'' covered almost every step Mijatović took during the eighties, especially through its Vienna correspondents. There are almost 300 contemporary articles of ''The Times'' mentioning Mijatović. At no time before had any Serbian minister, or any Serb at all, enjoyed such sympathies from The Times as did Mijatović in the last two decades of the nineteenth century. When he resigned his tenure of the President of the Serbian Royal Academy The Times commented: “Of all the statesmen in Servia, M. Mijatovitch is probably the one who holds the highest character in foreign countries. He has filled the principal offices in Servia, not only those that are rewards for party services, by those conferred by public consent, if not by public acclamation, on men whose abilities are not judged by mere party conflicts.”&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', November 12, 1889, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

His whole working life was strongly influenced by the culture of Victorian Britain. In introducing Gothic novels into Serbian literature he was influenced by [[Sir Walter Scott]]. The inspiration for his religious pieces originated from [[Charles Haddon Spurgeon]] and Cannon [[Henry Parry Liddon]]. Even his policy was inspired by British statesmen, especially by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] and [[Lord Salisbury]]. In Britain he became familiar with spiritualism, a widespread habit during the Victorian era. Through the influence of [[William Thomas Stead]] and [[Sir Oliver Lodge]] he gradually became an ardent believer in spiritualism and supernatural phenomena. Another British influence came in the field of parliamentarianism. Mijatović wished to copy British budgetary debates but the Serbian parliament consisting mostly of peasant MPs did not quite understand this effort. Finally he wanted to transmit a Protestant vision of ethics of labour and capital as formulated in bestsellers of [[Samuel Smiles]] and in the works of some [[Presbyterians]]. For this reason he was called in a biography published on him in Serbian "a Victorian among Serbs".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3355">'''Ștefan Orășanu''' (7 January 1869&amp;ndash;12 November 1903) was a [[Romania]]n historian, literary critic and poet.

Born to a [[Romanian Orthodox]] priest in [[Bucharest]], he attended elementary and high school in his native city. In 1901, Orășanu graduated from the [[University of Bucharest]]'s literature and philosophy faculty. The following year, he obtained a scholarship to study modern and contemporary history in Germany, but was unable to benefit from this due to the disease that would soon claim his life. From 1895, he was a clerk at the [[Romanian Academy Library]]. In 1900, he joined the editorial committee of ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' magazine. He substituted for [[Nicolae Iorga]] at Bucharest's history faculty in 1901. His contributions also appeared in ''Economia națională'', ''Epoca'', ''Liga literară'', ''Literatorul'', ''Noua revistă română'', ''Revista independentă'', ''Revista societății "Tinerimea română"'', ''Revista poporului'', ''[[România Literară]]'' and ''Românul literar''. He sometimes used the pen names Polit and Z. Miron.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;

Orășanu wrote poetry, but most of his output consisted of studies on history and literary history, as well as reviews of theatre, music and fine arts. Several of these studies appeared in book form: ''Bibliografia cestiunii Orientului'', 1899; ''Cronicarii moldoveni din secolul al XVII-lea'', 1899; ''Istoria României contimporane. Note critice'', 1900; ''Botanica populară. Note critice'', 1900; ''Filosofia lui La Fontaine după d. Pompiliu Eliade. Note critice'', 1901.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;

In the latter book, he attacked the opinions of critic [[Pompiliu Eliade]], ridiculing his notion that the form of [[Mihai Eminescu]]'s poetry marked a "considerable regression" from that of [[Vasile Alecsandri]]. The author also took aim at Eliade's critical methodology, characterizing it as "strikingly similar" to what [[Jean-François de La Harpe]] was doing in the late 18th century, and noting that this approach had long been abandoned even in France. Orășanu went on to mock Eliade's observations about the length and phonetic structure of verses, and the diagrams he used for demonstration. After finding other "errors" and "aberrations", he concluded that Eliade had written "a pastiche of a Parisian conference, in which cheap paradoxes give the illusion of originality".&lt;ref&gt;Pompiliu Marcea, ''Lecturi fidele'', p. 122. Bucharest: Editura Cartea Românească, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[Ioan Bianu]], he prepared a Romanian edition of a book by [[Alexandre Maurice Blanc de Lanautte, Comte d'Hauterive]]; this appeared in 1902 as ''Memoriu asupra vechei și actualei stări a Moldovei prezentat lui Alexandru Vodă Ipsilante la 1787''.&lt;ref name="sasu"&gt;Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', vol. II, pp. 264-5. Pitești: Editura Paralela 45, 2004. {{ISBN|973-697-758-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
