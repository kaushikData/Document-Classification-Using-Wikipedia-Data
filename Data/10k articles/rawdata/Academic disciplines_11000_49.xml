      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3469">An '''audio signal''' is a representation of [[sound]], typically as an electrical [[voltage]] for [[analog signal]]s and a binary number for [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]]s. Audio signals have frequencies in the [[audio frequency]] range of roughly 20 to 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz (the [[Human hearing range|limits of human hearing]]). Audio signals may be [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] directly, or may originate at a [[transducer]] such as a [[microphone]], [[Pickup (music technology)|musical instrument pickup]], [[phonograph]] cartridge, or [[tape head]]. [[Loudspeaker]]s or [[headphones]] convert an electrical audio signal into sound.

[[Digital audio]] systems represent audio signals in a variety of digital formats.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, Jay (2010). ''Understanding Records'', p.1. {{ISBN|978-1-4411-5607-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''audio channel''' or '''audio track''' is an audio signal [[Channel (communications)|communications channel]] in a [[data storage device|storage device]] or [[mixing console]], used in operations such as [[multi-track recording]] and [[sound reinforcement]].

== Signal flow ==
[[Audio signal flow|Signal flow]] is the path an audio signal will take from source to the speaker or recording device. Signal flow may be short and simple as in a [[home audio]] system or long and convoluted in a [[recording studio]] and larger sound reinforcement system as the signal may pass through many sections of a large [[Mixing console|console]], external [[audio equipment]], and even different rooms.

==Parameters==
Audio signals may be characterized by parameters such as their [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[nominal level]], [[Electric power|power]] level in [[decibel]]s (dB), and voltage level. The relation between power and voltage is determined by the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the signal path, which may be [[Single-ended signalling|single-ended]] or [[Balanced line|balanced]].

Audio signals have somewhat standardized levels depending on application. Outputs of professional [[Mixing console|mixing consoles]] are most commonly at [[line level]]. Consumer audio equipment will also output at a lower line level. Microphones generally output at an even lower level, commonly referred to a ''mic level''.

== Digital equivalent ==
The digital form of an audio signal is used in [[audio plug-in]]s and [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) software. The digital information passing through the DAW (i.e. from an audio track through a plug-in and out a hardware output) is an audio signal.

A digital audio signal being sent through wire can use several formats including [[optical]] ([[ADAT]], [[TDIF]]), [[coaxial]] ([[S/PDIF]]), [[XLR connector|XLR]] ([[AES/EBU]]), and [[Audio over Ethernet|Ethernet]].

It arises from the bases of the flagella, sometimes projecting beyond the end of the cell, and is often flexible or contractile, and so may be involved in movement and provides support for the cell.  Axostyles originate in association with a flagellar microtubular root and occur in two groups, the [[oxymonad]]s and [[parabasalid]]s; they have different structures and are not [[homology (biology)|homologous]].

'''BabelNet''' is a [[Multilinguality|multilingual]] lexicalized [[semantic network]] and [[Ontology (information science)|ontology]] developed at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]], at  the Department of Computer Science Linguistic Computing Laboratory.&lt;ref name="NavigliPonzetto12"&gt;R. Navigli and S. P Ponzetto. 2012. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2012.07.001 BabelNet: The Automatic Construction, Evaluation and Application of a Wide-Coverage Multilingual Semantic Network]. Artificial Intelligence, 193, Elsevier, pp. 217-250.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Navigli, S. P. Ponzetto. [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P10/P10-1023.pdf BabelNet: Building a Very Large Multilingual Semantic Network]. Proc. of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2010), Uppsala, Sweden, July 11–16, 2010, pp. 216–225.&lt;/ref&gt; BabelNet was automatically created by linking Wikipedia to the most popular computational [[Dictionary|lexicon]] of the [[English language]], [[WordNet]]. The integration is done using an automatic mapping and by filling in lexical gaps in resource-poor [[language]]s by using [[statistical machine translation]]. The result is an "encyclopedic dictionary" that provides [[concept]]s and [[Named entity|named entities]] [[Lexicalization|lexicalized]] in many languages and connected with large amounts of [[Semantic relation#Relationships|semantic relations]]. Additional lexicalizations and definitions are added by linking to free-license wordnets, OmegaWiki, the English [[Wiktionary]], [[Wikidata]], [[FrameNet]], [[VerbNet]] and others. Similarly to WordNet, BabelNet groups [[word]]s in different languages into sets of [[synonyms]], called ''Babel [[synsets]]''. For each Babel synset, BabelNet provides short definitions (called [[Definition|glosses]]) in many languages harvested from both WordNet and Wikipedia.

[[File:The BabelNet structure.png|thumb|600px|BabelNet is a multilingual semantic network obtained as an integration of WordNet and Wikipedia.]]

==Statistics of BabelNet==

{{As of|2018|02}}, BabelNet (version 4.0) covers 284 [[language]]s, including all European languages, most [[Asian language]]s, and [[Latin]]. BabelNet 4.0 contains almost 16 million synsets and about 833 million [[word sense]]s (regardless of their language). Each Babel synset contains 2 synonyms per language, i.e., word senses, on average. The semantic network includes all the lexico-semantic relations from WordNet ([[Hyponymy|hypernymy and hyponymy]], [[meronymy]] and [[holonymy]], [[antonymy]] and [[synonymy]], etc., totaling around 364,000 relation edges) as well as an underspecified relatedness relation from Wikipedia (totaling around 1,3 bilion edges).&lt;ref name="NavigliPonzetto12" /&gt; Version 4.0 also associates about 53 million images with Babel synsets and provides a Lemon [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] encoding of the resource,&lt;ref&gt;M. Ehrmann, F. Cecconi, D. Vannella, J. McCrae, P. Cimiano, R. Navigli.

Proc. of the 9th Language Resources and Evaluation Conference (LREC 2014), Reykjavik, Iceland, 26–31 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; available via a [[SPARQL endpoint]]. 2.67 million synsets are assigned domain labels.

==Applications==

BabelNet has been shown to enable multilingual [[Natural Language Processing]] applications. The lexicalized [[knowledge]] available in BabelNet has been shown to obtain state-of-the-art results in:

'''Bay mud''' consists of thick deposits of soft, unconsolidated [[silt]]y [[clay]], which is saturated with [[water]]; these soil layers are situated at the bottom of certain [[estuary|estuaries]], which are normally in [[temperate region]]s that have experienced cyclical [[glacial]] cycles.  Example locations are [[Cape Cod Bay]], [[Chongming Dongtan]] Reserve in [[Shanghai]], [[China]],  [[Banc d'Arguin]]preserve in [[Mauritania]], The [[Bristol Channel]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Mandø Island]] in the [[Wadden Sea]] in [[Denmark]], [[Florida Bay]], [[San Francisco Bay]], [[Bay of Fundy]], [[Casco Bay]], [[Penobscot Bay]], and [[Morro Bay]].  Bay mud manifests low [[shear strength (soil)|shear strength]], high [[compressibility]] and low [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]], making it hazardous to build upon in [[seismic]]ally active regions like the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

Typical bulk density of bay mud is approximately 1.3&amp;nbsp;grams per cubic centimetre.  Bay muds often have a high [[organic matter|organic]] content, consisting of decayed organisms at lower depths, but may also contain living creatures when they occur at the upper soil layer and become exposed by low tides; then, they are called [[mudflat]]s, an important [[ecological]] zone for [[shorebird]]s and many types of marine organisms.  Great attention was not given to the incidence of deeper bay muds until the 1960s and 1970s when development encroachment on certain North American bays intensified, requiring geotechnical design of foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Farzad Naeim, ''The Seismic Design Handbook'', Kluwer Academic Publishers, (2003) {{ISBN|0-7923-7301-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bay mud has its own official geological abbreviation.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd Fusselman, ''Environmental Concerns: Learn the Acronyms'', Trafford Publishing, Victoria, B.C. (2002) {{ISBN|1-55369-461-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The designation for [[Quaternary]] older bay mud is '''Qobm''' and the acronym for Quaternary younger bay mud is '''Qybm'''.  An [[alluvial]] layer is often found overlying the older bay mud.

In relation to shipping channels, it is often necessary to dredge bay bottoms and barge the excavated material to an alternate location.  In this case [[chemical]] analyses are usually performed on the bay mud to determine whether there are elevated levels of [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s, [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s or other toxic substances known to accumulate in a [[benthic]] environment.  It is not uncommon to dredge the same [[Channel (geography)|channel]] repeatedly (over a span of ten to thirty years) since further settling sediments are prone to redeposit on an open estuarine valley floor.

==Depositional scenarios==

[[Image:Diatoms through the microscope.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Decomposed [[diatom]]s are one component of bay mud]]

Bay muds originate from two generalized sources.  First [[alluvial]] deposits of clays, silts and sand occur from streams tributary to a given bay.  The extent of these unconsolidated interglacial deposits typically ranges throughout a given bay to the extent of the historical perimeter [[marshland]]s.  Second, in periods of high glaciation, deposits of silts, sands and organic plus [[inorganic]] [[detritus]] (e.g. decomposition of estuarine [[diatom]]s) may form a separate distinct layer.  Thus bay muds are important time records of glacial activity and streamflow throughout the [[Quaternary]] period.

Some depositional formation is quite recent, such as in the case of Florida Bay, where much of the bay mud has accumulated since 2000 BC, and consists of primarily decayed organic material.&lt;ref&gt;R.B. Halley, E.J. Prager, R.P. Stumpf, K.K. Yates, and C.H. Holmes, ''Sea-Level Rise and the Future of Florida Bay in the Next Century'', [[U.S.Geological Survey]], (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of Florida Bay these bay muds can accrete as much as 0.5 to 2.0 centimeters per annum, although the dynamic equilibrium of [[erosion]], [[wave action]] redistribution and deposition complicate the net rate of layer growth. In the case of the [[Bristol Channel]] in the United Kingdom bay, mud formation has been occurring at least since the Eemian Stage (known as the [[Sangamonian Stage]] in [[North America]]), or about 130,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;R.Kirby and W.R.Parker, ''Settled mud deposits in Bridgewater Bay Bristol Channel'', Report no. 107, Institute of Oceanographic Sciences, Surrey, UK (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases such as with [[San Francisco Bay]], deposition has been interrupted by sea-level changes, and strata of vastly different vintages are found. In the San Francisco Bay Area, these are  called [[Young bay mud]] and [[Older bay mud]] by [[geologist]]s. Human activities can also affect deposition; close to half of the Young Bay Mud in San Francisco Bay was placed in the period 1855–1865, as a result of [[placer mining]] in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] foothills.

==Geotechnical factors==

[[Image:Dakinbldg.jpg|thumb|190px|left|[[Dakin Building]], a national [[headquarters]] use, built on driven [[Deep foundation|piles]] over bay mud]]

Construction on bay mud sites is difficult because of the soil's low strength and high compressibility. Very lightweight buildings can be constructed on bay mud sites if there is a thick enough layer of non-bay-mud soil above the bay mud, but buildings which impose significant loads must be supported on deep foundations bearing on stiffer layers below the bay mud, or obtaining support from friction in the bay mud. Even with deep foundations, difficulties arise because the surrounding ground will likely settle over time, potentially damaging utility connections to the building and causing the entryway to sink below street level.

A number of notable buildings have been constructed over bay muds, typically employing special mitigation designs to withstand seismic risks and settlement issues.  Complicating design issues, fill (beginning about 1850 AD) is sometimes found deposited on the surface level.   For example, the [[Dakin Building]] in [[Brisbane, California]] was designed in 1985&lt;ref&gt;''Judges praise innovative ideas'', San Francisco Examiner, Page F-6,  January 12, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; to sit on piles 150 feet deep, anchoring to the [[Franciscan formation]], below the bay muds and through an upper fill layer.  Furthermore, the structure’s entrance ramp has been set on a giant hinge to allow the surrounding land to settle, while the building absolute height remains constant.  The Crowne Plaza [[high-rise]] [[hotel]] in [[Burlingame, California]]&lt;ref&gt;C.M.Hogan, Kay Wilson, Ballard George, Marc Papineau et al., ''Environmental Impact Report for the Crowne Plaza Hotel'', prepared by Earth Metrics Inc and. published by the city of  Burlingame, California, circulated by the State of California Clearinghouse, (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; was also designed to sit over bay muds, as was the Westin Hotel in [[Millbrae, California]] and [[Trinity Church, Boston#Art and architecture|Trinity Church]] in Boston's Copley Square. Indeed, Boston's entire [[Back Bay]] district is named for the tidal bay that it now covers. [[Logan International Airport]] and the [[San Francisco International Airport]] are also constructed over bay mud.

[[Image:Bnstiltpair.jpg|thumb|210px|right|[[Black-necked stilt]]s foraging on [[Pickleweed Inlet]] mudflats]]

==Mudflats==
{{main|Mudflat}}
When the mud layer is exposed at the tidal fringe, mudflats result affording a unique [[ecotone]] that affords numerous shorebird [[species]] a safe feeding and resting habitat.  Because the muds function much like [[quicksand]], heavier [[mammal]]ian [[predator]]s not only cannot gain traction for pursuit, but would actually become trapped in the sinking muds. The muds are also an important substrate for primary [[marsh]] productivity including [[Zostera|eelgrass]], [[cordgrass]] and [[pickleweed]]. Furthermore, they are home to a large variety of [[mollusc]]s and estuarine [[arthropod]]s. Richardson Bay, for example, exposes one third of its areal extent as mudflat at low tide, which hosts a productive eelgrass expanse and also a large shorebird community.

Mammals such as the [[Harbor seal]] may use mudflats to haul out of estuary waters; however, larger mammals such as [[humpback whale]]s may become accidentally stranded at low tides. Note that normally humpback whales do not frequent estuaries containing mudflats, but at least one errant whale, publicized by the media as [[Humphrey the whale|Humphrey the humpback whale]], became stuck on a mudflat in San Francisco Bay at Sierra Point in Brisbane, California.

==Worldwide occurrences==

Bay muds occur in bays and estuaries throughout the temperate regions of the world.  In [[North America]], prominent instances are: (a) the Stellwagen Bank formed 16,000 to 9000 BC by glaciation of [[Cape Cod Bay]] in [[Massachusetts]], (b) Florida Bay,(c) in California Morro Bay and San Francisco Bay and (d) Knik &amp; Turnagain Arms in Anchorage, Alaska.  In the [[United Kingdom]] large bay mud occurrences are found at [[Morecambe Bay]], [[Bridgwater Bay]] and Bristol Bay.  Straddling [[Denmark]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Germany]] is the [[Wadden Sea]], a major formation underlain by bay muds.

In Asia the [[Chongming Dongtan]] Nature Reserve in [[Shanghai]], [[China]] is an example of a large scale bay mud formation.  The [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]] of [[Africa]] holds the [[Banc d'Arguin]], a [[World Heritage]] nature preserve in the country of [[Mauritania]].  Banc d'Arguin is a vast area underlain by bay mud.

==Regulatory issues and Actions==

When building on top of bay mud layers or when dredging estuary bottoms, a variety of [[regulatory]] frameworks may arise. Normally in the United States, an [[Environmental Impact Report]] as well as a geotechnical investigation are conducted precedent to any major construction over bay mud.  Combined, these reports have developed much of the data base extant on bay mud characteristics, frequently yielding original field data from soil borings.  These data have demonstrated that in many locations the shallower bay muds contain concentrations of [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[lead]], [[chromium]], petroleum [[hydrocarbon]]s, PCBs, [[pesticide]]s and other chemicals which exceed toxic limits: a geological record of human activities of the last century.  These data are particularly important to consider when dredging of bay muds is contemplated as part of a development project. Such dredging can have impacts to receiving lands as [[soil contamination]], but also [[water column]] impacts from sediment disturbance.

In the case of dredging within the [[United States]], a permit is almost always required from the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], after submission of extensive data on the project limits,  chemical properties of the bay muds to be disturbed, a dredge disposal plan and often a complete [[Environmental Impact Statement]] pursuant to the [[National Environmental Policy Act]].  Further review by the [[United States Coast Guard]] would normally be required.  Within individual state jurisdictions, such as [[California]], an Environmental Impact Report must be filed for dredging of any significance; furthermore, agency reviews by the [[California Coastal Commission]] and the [[Regional Water Quality Control Board]] would normally be mandated. All of these regulatory bodies serve an important role in deciding whether an area may be dredged or not. However, the most important body is [[CEQA]], or the California Environmental Quality Act. This guiding legislation is the reason for [[Environmental Impact Report]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, costly mitigation measures and arduous review processes. One of CEQA's main goals is to promote interagency cooperation in the review process of a project. This is one of the main reasons why it is the overseer of all projects in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide to California Planning 4th edition|last=Fulton|first=William|publisher=Solano Press Books|year=2012|isbn=978-1-938-166-02-0|location=Point Arena, California|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For buildings proposed over bay mud layers, typically the municipality involved will, in addition to the usual engineering and design review issues common to all building projects (which are more complicated because of the site conditions), require an Environmental Impact Report [https://web.archive.org/web/20060906222150/http://ceres.ca.gov/topic/env_law/ceqa/guidelines/].  This process would include reviews by that city’s building department, as well as applicable regional and state agencies such as those cited above for dredging projects, except that Coast Guard agencies would not typically be concerned. In developing in California, proposed development over bay mud layers would also have to go through a planning commission and a city council in order to be allowed. This process would respect the EIR, CEQA, and all the other bodies discussed above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Planning for Sustainability 2nd edition|last=Wheeler|first=Stephen|publisher=Routledge Taylor and Francis Group|year=2013|isbn=978-0-415-80988-7|location=New York, NY|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of San Francisco the project would have to get approved by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sfbos.org/about-board|title=About the Board|last=|first=|date=|website=Board of Supervisors|publisher=City and County of San Francisco|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to San Francisco, some interesting negative externalities are being experienced due to the dredging of land by the Bay. The Millennium Towers, which were completed in 2008, are currently sinking. This has had a negative impact on the residents of this building. In response to this subsidence, San Francisco's city attorney has decided to file a lawsuit against the developer, because the developer failed to inform the residents of the accelerated speed that the building was sinking at.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/us/san-francisco-files-lawsuit-against-sinking-millennium-tower.html?_r=0|title=San Francisco Files Lawsuit Against Sinking Millennium Tower|last=Fuller|first=Thomas|date=3 November 2016|website=|publisher=The New York Times|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this lawsuit results in success for San Francisco this could lead to policy changes being made in the future surrounding transparency between developers and potential buyers of the developed land.

== Sea Level Rise ==
Sea level rise in California will also have a huge impact on the ecosystems surrounding and within bays all across the globe. This phenomenon will completely engulf bay mud that makes up Bay Flats. In order to deal with sea level rise the California Coastal Commission has adopted policy guidelines to help California. Attached is a link to this policy document &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coastal.ca.gov/climate/slrguidance.html|title=Sea Level Rise Adopted Policy Guidance|last=|first=|date=12 August 2015|website=|publisher=California Coastal Commission|access-date=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioregionalism''' is a [[politics|political]], [[culture|cultural]], and [[Ecology|ecological]] system or set of views based on naturally defined areas called [[bioregion]]s, similar to [[ecoregion]]s. Bioregions are defined through physical and environmental features, including [[Drainage basin|watershed]] boundaries and [[soil]] and [[terrain]] characteristics. Bioregionalism stresses that the determination of a bioregion is also a [[culture|cultural]] phenomenon, and emphasizes local populations, knowledge, and solutions.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/view/260/385 Bioregionalism: The Need For a Firmer Theoretical Foundation]{{dead link|date=October 2017}}", Don Alexander, Trumpeter v13.3, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioregionalism asserts "that a bioregion’s environmental components (geography, climate, plant life, animal life, etc.) directly influence ways for human communities to act and interact with each other which are, in turn, optimal for those communities to thrive in their environment. As such, those ways to thrive in their totality—be they economic, cultural, spiritual, or political—will be distinctive in some capacity as being a product of their bioregional environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://towardscascadia.com/2015/11/15/bioregionalism-place-shapes-identity/|title=Bioregionalism: Place Shapes Identity|last=M|first=Ryan|date=2015-11-15|website=Towards Cascadia|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioregionalism is a concept that goes beyond [[national boundaries]]—an example is the concept of [[Cascadia (independence movement)|Cascadia]], a region that is sometimes considered to consist of most of [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], the [[Alaska Panhandle]], the far north of [[California]] and the [[West Coast of Canada]], sometimes also including some or all of [[Idaho]] and [[western Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cascadiaprospectus.org/2010/02/cascadia_the_new_frontier.php |title=Cascadia: The New Frontier |publisher=Cascadia Prospectus |date=2010-02-12 |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312125000/http://www.cascadiaprospectus.org/2010/02/cascadia_the_new_frontier.php |archivedate=2012-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of a bioregion, which does not cross national boundaries, but does overlap state lines, is [[the Ozarks]], a bioregion also referred to as the Ozarks Plateau, which consists of southern [[Missouri]], northwest [[Arkansas]], the northeast corner of [[Oklahoma]], southeast corner of [[Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|url=http://ozarkareacommunitycongress.org/|work=OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogregions are not synonymous with ecoregions as defined by bodies such as the [[World Wildlife Fund]] or the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]]; the later are scientifically based and focused on wildlife and vegetation. Bioregions, by contrast are human regions, informed by nature but with a social and political element. In this way bioregionalism is simply [[political localism]] with an ecological foundation.

==Overview==
The term was coined by Allen Van Newkirk, founder of the Institute for Bioregional Research, in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGinnis|first=Michael Vincent|title=Bioregionalism|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|location=London and New York|isbn=041515444-8|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; given currency by [[Peter Berg (bioregionalist)|Peter Berg]] and [[Raymond Dasmann]] in the early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Peter and Raymond Dasmann, "Reinhabiting California," ''The Ecologist'' 7, no. 10 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; and has been advocated by writers such as [https://books.google.ca/books?id=n42Rf_ibaMcC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=david+haenke&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1AM-OxjlTj&amp;sig=1LBacDKoY42fT8ZcHu5eDmfQ46A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiox6e2qevKAhVFsoMKHQU6DCIQ6AEIRTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=david%20haenke&amp;f=false David Haenke] and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Walter Truett. [https://archive.is/20120529125505/http://motherjones.com/print/16589 There's no going back to nature], ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' (September/October 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

The bioregionalist perspective opposes a homogeneous economy and consumer culture with its lack of stewardship towards the environment. This perspective seeks to:
*Ensure that political boundaries match ecological boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, S. (2007) "The Troubled Marriage of Deep Ecology and Bioregionalism," ''Environmental Values'', vol. 16(3): 313-332&lt;/ref&gt;
*Highlight the unique [[ecology]] of the bioregion.
*Encourage consumption of [[local food]]s where possible.
*Encourage the use of local [[natural resource|materials]] where possible.
*Encourage the cultivation of [[indigenous (ecology)|native plants]] of the region.
*Encourage [[sustainability]] in harmony with the bioregion.&lt;ref&gt;Bastedo, Jamie. ''Shield Country: The Life and Times of the Oldest Piece of the Planet'', Red Deer Press, 1994. {{ISBN|0-88995-191-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioregional mapping''' is a powerful tool to increase understanding, change the story and influence policy.  A good bioregional map shows layers of geology, flora, fauna, and inhabitation over time. All the interdisciplinary content that is integrated in this kind of map makes it a great communication tool to illustrate an ecological approach. One of the best examples of a richly communicative bioregional map is David McClosky's [http://cascadia-institute.org/ new map of Cascadia].

==Relationship to environmentalism==

Bioregionalism, while akin to [[environmentalism]] in certain aspects, such as a desire to live in harmony with [[nature]], differs in certain ways from classical, 20th century environmentalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainable-city.org/intervws/berg.htm |title=Peter Berg of Planet Drum |publisher=Sustainable-city.org |date=1998-02-12 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Peter Berg, bioregionalism is [[proactive]], and is based on forming a harmony between human culture and the natural environment, rather than being [[protest]]-based like the original environmental movement. Also, while classical environmentalists saw human industry as the [[enemy]] of nature and nature as a victim needing to be saved; bioregionalists see humanity and its culture as a part of nature, focusing on building a positive, sustainable relationship with the environment, rather than a focus on preserving and segregating the [[wilderness]] from the world of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainable-city.org/intervws/berg.htm |title=Peter Berg of Planet Drum |publisher=Sustainable-city.org |date=1998-02-12 |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
North American Bioregional Assemblies have been bi-annual gatherings of bioregionalists throughout North America since 1984 and have given rise to national level [[Green Parties]]. In addition, bioregionalism spawned the sustainability movement{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. The tenets of bioregionalism are often used by green movements, which oppose political organizations whose boundaries conform to existing electoral districts.  This problem is perceived to result in elected representatives voting in accordance with their constituents, some of whom may live outside a defined bioregion, and may run counter to the well-being of the bioregion.

At the local level, several bioregions have congresses that meet regularly. For instance, the Ozark Plateau bioregion hosts a yearly Ozark Area Community Congress, better known as OACC, which has been meeting every year since 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|url=http://ozarkareacommunitycongress.org/|work=OACC Ozark Area Community Congress|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; most often on the first weekend in October. The Kansas Area Watershed, "KAW" was founded in 1982 and has been meeting regularly since that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kansas Area Watershed Council History|url=http://kawcouncil.wordpress.com/about/history/|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; KAW holds a yearly meeting, usually in the spring.

The government of the Canadian province of Alberta has recently made major amendments to its land-use policies including a separate "land-use framework" document for each major [[river basin]] within the province.  This is supported by local initiatives such as the [[Beaver Hills (Alberta)|Beaver Hills]] Initiative, which seeks to create a large [[biosphere reserve]] encompassing [[Elk Island National Park]] and the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beaverhills.ca/|title=Home {{!}} Beaver Hills Initiative|website=www.beaverhills.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Buddhism}}
'''Buddhist art''' is the [[art|artistic practices]] that are influenced by [[Buddhism]]. It includes art media which depict [[Buddha]]s, [[bodhisattva]]s, and other entities; notable Buddhist figures, both historical and mythical; narrative scenes from the lives of all of these; [[mandala]]s and other graphic aids to practice; as well as physical objects associated with Buddhist practice, such as [[vajra]]s, bells, [[stupa]]s and [[Buddhist architecture|Buddhist temple architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=What is Buddhist Art? |url=http://buddhistartnews.wordpress.com/what-is-buddhist-art/ |publisher=Buddhist Art News |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist art originated on the [[Indian subcontinent]] following the historical life of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], 6th to 5th century BCE, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.

Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through [[Central Asia]] and into [[Eastern Asia]] to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art, and to the east as far as [[Southeast Asia]] to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art. In India, Buddhist art flourished and co-developed with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] art, with cave temple complexes built together, each likely influencing the other.&lt;ref name=blurton113&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 113-116, 160-162, 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-iconic phase (5th century – 1st century BCE)==
{{See also|Aniconism in Buddhism}}
[[File:Buddha-Footprint.jpeg|thumb|upright|right|Footprint of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. 1st century BCE, [[Gandhara]].]]
During the 2nd to 1st century BCE, sculptures became more explicit, representing episodes of the Buddha’s life and teachings. These took the form of votive tablets or [[frieze]]s, usually in relation to the decoration of stupas.
Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form, but only through [[Buddhist symbolism]]. This period may have been [[aniconism in Buddhism|aniconic]].

Artists were reluctant to depict the Buddha anthropomorphically, and developed sophisticated aniconic symbols to avoid doing so (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear). This tendency remained as late as the 2nd century CE in the southern parts of India, in the art of the [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district#Amaravati School|Amaravati School]] (see: [[Mara (demon)|Mara's assault on the Buddha]]).
It has been argued that earlier anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha may have been made of wood and may have perished since then. However, no related archaeological evidence has been found.

The earliest works of Buddhist art in India date back to the 1st century BCE The
[[Mahabodhi Temple]] at Bodh Gaya became a model for similar structures in Burma
and Indonesia. The frescoes at [[Sigiriya]] are said to be even older than the
[[Ajanta Caves]] paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontline.in/archives.htm Buddhist Art ]  Frontline Magazine 13–26 May 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconic phase (1st century CE – present)==
{{see also|Greco-Buddhist art|Mathura art}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Padmapani, cave 1, Ajanta, India.jpg|thumb|left|Over life-size figure of the [[bodhisattva]] [[Padmapani]], cave 1, [[Ajanta Caves]], 5th century]]
Anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha started to emerge from the 1st century CE in [[Northern India]]. The two main centers of creation have been identified as [[Gandhara]] in today’s [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]], in [[Pakistan]], and the region of [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]], in central northern India.

Hellenistic culture was introduced in Gandhara during the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in 332&amp;nbsp;BCE. [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (reign: 321–298 BCE), founder of the [[Mauryan Empire]], conquered the Macedonian satraps during the [[Seleucid-Mauryan War]] of 305–303 BCE. Chandragupta's grandson [[Ashoka]] (reign: 268-232 BCE), who formed the largest Empire in the Indian subcontinent, converted to Buddhism following the [[Kalinga War]]. Abandoning an expansionist ideology, Ashoka worked to spread the religion and philosophy throughout his empire as described in the [[edicts of Ashoka]]. Ashoka claims to have converted the Greek populations within his realm to Buddhism:
{{quote|Here in the king's domain among the Greeks, the [[Kambojas]], the Nabhakas, the Nabhapamkits, the Bhojas, the Pitinikas, the Andhras and the Palidas, everywhere people are following Beloved-of-the-Gods' instructions in [[Dharma]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Edicts of Ashoka|Rock Edict Nb13]]'' (S. Dhammika)&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

After the overthrow of the Mauryan Empire by the [[Shunga Empire]], the  [[Greco-Bactrian]] and subsequently the [[Indo-Greek]] Kingdoms invaded north-western India. They facilitated the spread of Greco-Buddhist art style to other parts of the subcontinent. The Indo-Greek King [[Menander I]] was renown as a great patron of Buddhism, attaining the title of an [[arhat]].&lt;ref&gt;"(In the Milindapanha) Menander is declared an arhat", McEvilley, p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile [[Pushyamitra Shunga]] persecuted Buddhism, presumably to further erase the legacy of the Mauryan Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Caleb; Sarao, K. T. S. (2010). "Pushyamitra Sunga, a Hindu ruler in the second century BCE, was a great persecutor of Buddhists". In Danver, Steven L. Popular Controversies in World History. ABC-CLIO. p. 89. {{ISBN|9781598840780}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the decline of Buddhist art east of Mathura.

Gandharan Buddhist sculpture displays [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|Hellenistic artistic influence]] in the forms of human figures and ornament. Figures were much larger than any known from India previously, and also more naturalistic, and new details included wavy hair, drapery covering both shoulders, shoes and sandals, and [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaf ornament.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
[[File:Inscribed Seated Buddha Image in Abhaya Mudra - Kushan Period - Katra Keshav Dev - ACCN A-1 - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 5972.JPG|thumb|Mathura school Buddha, [[Kushan Empire|Kushan period]]]]

The art of Mathura tends to be based on an Indian tradition, exemplified by the anthropomorphic representation of divinities such as the [[Yaksha|Yaksas]], although in a style rather archaic compared to the later representations of the Buddha. The Mathuran school contributed clothes covering the left shoulder of thin [[muslin]], the wheel on the palm, the lotus seat.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Mathura and Gandhara also influenced each other. During their artistic florescence, the two regions were even united politically under the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], both being capitals of the empire. It is still a matter of debate whether the anthropomorphic representations of Buddha was essentially a result of a local evolution of Buddhist art at Mathura, or a consequence of Greek cultural influence in Gandhara through the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] [[syncretism]].

This iconic art was characterized from the start by a realistic idealism, combining realistic human features, proportions, attitudes and attributes, together with a sense of perfection and serenity reaching to the divine. This expression of the Buddha as both man and God became the iconographic canon for subsequent Buddhist art.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Remains of early Buddhist painting in India are vanishingly rare, with the later phases of the [[Ajanta Caves]] giving the great majority of surviving work, created over a relatively short up to about 480 CE.  These are highly sophisticated works, evidently produced in a well-developed tradition, probably painting secular work in palaces as much as religious subjects.

Buddhist art continued to develop in India for a few more centuries. The pink [[sandstone]] sculptures of Mathura evolved during the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period (4th to 6th century CE) to reach a very high fineness of execution and delicacy in the modeling. The art of the Gupta school was extremely influential almost everywhere in the rest of Asia. At the end of the 12th century CE, Buddhism in its full glory came to be preserved only in the Himalayan regions in India. These areas, helped by their location, were in greater contact with Tibet and China - for example the art and traditions of [[Ladakh]] bear the stamp of Tibetan and Chinese influence.
[[File:Buddhist Expansion.svg|thumb|right|240px|Buddhist expansion throughout Asia.]]
As Buddhism expanded outside of India from the 1st century CE, its original artistic package blended with other artistic influences, leading to a progressive differentiation among the countries adopting the faith.
* A '''Northern route''' was established from the 1st century CE through [[Central Asia]], [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]], [[Bhutan]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]], in which [[Mahayana]] Buddhism prevailed.
* A '''Southern route''', where [[Theravada]] Buddhism dominated, went through [[Myanmar]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], and [[Laos]].

==Northern Buddhist art==
[[File:Wood Bodhisattva.jpg|left|thumb|A Chinese wooden [[Bodhisattva]] from the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279 CE)]]

The [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism]] to Central Asia, China and ultimately Korea and Japan started in the 1st century CE with a semi-legendary account of an embassy sent to the West by the Chinese Emperor [[Emperor Ming of Han China|Ming]] (58-75&amp;nbsp;AD). However, extensive contacts started in the 2nd century CE, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the [[Kushan Empire]] into the Chinese territory of the [[Tarim Basin]], with the missionary efforts of a great number of Central Asian Buddhist monks to Chinese lands. The first missionaries and translators of Buddhists scriptures into [[Chinese language|Chinese]], such as [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]], were either [[Parthia]]n, [[Kushan]], [[Sogdiana|Sogdian]] or [[Kuchean]].

Central Asian missionary efforts along the [[Silk Road]] were accompanied by a flux of artistic influences, visible in the development of [[Serindian art]] from the 2nd through the 11th century in the Tarim Basin, modern [[Xinjiang]]. Serindian art often derives from the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of the [[Gandhara]] district of what is now [[Pakistan]], combining Indian, Greek and [[Roman art|Roman]] influences. Silk Road Greco-Buddhist artistic influences can be found as far as Japan to this day, in architectural motifs, Buddhist imagery, and a select few representations of [[Kami|Japanese gods]].

The art of the northern route was also highly influenced by the development of [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, an inclusive branch of Buddhism characterized by the adoption of new texts, in addition to the traditional [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]], and a shift in the understanding of Buddhism. Mahāyāna goes beyond the traditional [[Early Buddhist schools|Early Buddhist]] ideal of the release from suffering ([[dukkha|duḥkha]]) of [[arhat]]s, and emphasizes the [[bodhisattva]] path. The Mahāyāna sutras elevate the Buddha to a transcendent and infinite being, and feature a pantheon of bodhisattvas devoting themselves to the [[Paramita|Six Perfections]], ultimate knowledge ([[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]]), enlightenment, and the liberation of all sentient beings. Northern Buddhist art thus tends to be characterized by a very rich and syncretic Buddhist pantheon, with a multitude of images of the various [[Buddhahood|buddhas]], bodhisattvas, and heavenly beings ([[deva (Buddhism)|devas]]).

===Afghanistan===
[[File:GBA1(trimmed).jpg|thumb|upright|Statue from a Buddhist monastery, 700&amp;nbsp;AD, Afghanistan]]
Buddhist art in [[Afghanistan]] (old [[Bactria]]) persisted for several centuries until the spread of Islam in the 7th century. It is exemplified by the [[Buddhas of Bamyan]]. Other sculptures, in [[stucco]], [[schist]] or [[clay]], display very strong blending of Indian post-[[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] mannerism and Classical influence, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] or possibly even [[Greco-Roman]].

Although Islamic rule was somewhat tolerant of other religions "[[People of the Book|of the Book]]", it showed little tolerance for Buddhism, which was perceived as a religion depending on "[[idolatry]]". Human figurative art forms also being prohibited under Islam, Buddhist art suffered numerous attacks, which culminated with the systematic destructions by the [[Taliban]] regime. The Buddhas of Bamyan, the sculptures of [[Hadda, Afghanistan|Hadda]], and many of the remaining artifacts at the Afghanistan museum have been destroyed.

The multiple conflicts since the 1980s also have led to a systematic pillage of archaeological sites apparently in the hope of reselling in the international market what artifacts could be found.

===Central Asia===
{{See also|Dunhuang|Mogao Caves|Kingdom of Khotan|Silk Road|Silk Road transmission of Buddhism}}
[[File:SerindianGroup.jpg|thumb|left|[[Serindian art]], 6th-7th century [[Terra cotta|terracotta]], Tumshuq (Xinjiang).]]
[[Central Asia]] long played the role of a meeting place between China, India and [[Iran|Persia]]. During the 2nd century BCE, the expansion of the [[Han Dynasty|Former Han]] to the West led to increased contact with the Hellenistic civilizations of Asia, especially the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]].

Thereafter, the expansion of Buddhism to the North led to the formation of Buddhist communities and even Buddhist kingdoms in the oasis of Central Asia. Some [[Silk Road]] cities consisted almost entirely of Buddhist stupas and monasteries, and it seems that one of their main objectives was to welcome and service travelers between East and West.

The eastern part of Central Asia  ([[Chinese Turkestan]] ([[Tarim Basin]], [[Xinjiang]]) in particular has revealed an extremely rich [[Serindian art]] ([[cave painting|wall paintings]] and [[relief]]s in numerous caves, portable paintings on canvas, sculpture, ritual objects), displaying multiple influences from Indian and Hellenistic cultures. Works of art reminiscent of the Gandharan style, as well as scriptures in the Gandhari script [[Kharoshti]] have been found. These influences were rapidly absorbed however by the vigorous Chinese culture, and a strongly Chinese particularism develops from that point.

===China===
{{see also|Chinese Buddhist sculpture}}
Buddhism arrived in [[China]] around the 1st century CE, and introduced new types of art into China, particularly in the area of [[statue|statuary]]. Receiving this distant religion, strong Chinese traits were incorporated into Buddhist art.

====Northern Dynasties====
In the 5th to 6th centuries, the [[Northern Dynasties]] developed rather symbolic and abstract modes of representation, with schematic lines. Their style is also said to be solemn and majestic. The lack of corporeality of this art, and its distance from the original Buddhist objective of expressing the pure ideal of enlightenment in an accessible and realistic manner, progressively led to a change towards more naturalism and realism, leading to the expression of Tang Buddhist art.

Sites preserving Northern Wei Dynasty Buddhist sculpture:
*[[Yungang Grottoes]], [[Shanxi]]
*[[Longmen Grottoes]], [[Henan]]
*[[Bingling Temple]], [[Gansu]]

====Tang Dynasty====
[[File:Tejaprabhā Buddha and the Five Planets by Chang Huai-hsing.jpg|thumb|right|''{{ill|Tejaprabhā Buddha and the Five Planets|yue|熾盛光佛並五星圖}}'', 897 A.D.]]
Following a transition under the [[Sui Dynasty]], Buddhist sculpture of the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] evolved towards a markedly lifelike expression. Because of the dynasty's openness to foreign influences, and renewed exchanges with Indian culture due to the numerous travels of Chinese Buddhist monks to India, Tang dynasty Buddhist sculpture assumed a rather classical form, inspired by the Indian art of the Gupta period. During that time, the Tang capital of [[Chang'an]] (today's [[Xi'an]]) became an important center for Buddhism. From there Buddhism spread to [[Korea]], and [[Japanese missions to Tang China]] helped it gain a foothold in Japan.

However, foreign influences came to be negatively perceived in China towards the end of the Tang dynasty. In the year 845, the Tang emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang China|Wuzong]] outlawed all "foreign" religions (including Christian [[Nestorianism]], [[Zoroastrianism]] and [[Buddhism]]) in order to support the indigenous religion, [[Taoism]]. He confiscated Buddhist possessions, and forced the faith to go underground, therefore affecting the development of the religion and its arts in China.

[[Chán]] Buddhism however, as the origin of Japanese [[Zen]], continued to prosper for some centuries, especially under the [[Song Dynasty]] (960-1279), when Chan monasteries were great centers of culture and learning.

[[File:Chinesischer Maler von 1238 001.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of the Chinese [[Zen]] Buddhist [[Wuzhun Shifan]], painted in 1238&amp;nbsp;AD, [[Song Dynasty]].]]

Early paintings by Chán monks tended to eschew the meticulous realism of [[Gongbi]] painting in favour of vigorous, monochrome paintings, attempting to express the impact of enlightenment through their brushwork.&lt;ref&gt;Cotterell, A; ''The imperial capitals of China: an inside view of the celestial empire'', Random House 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-84595-010-1}} p179&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[Neo-Confucianism]] under [[Zhu Xi]] in the twelfth century resulted in considerable criticism of the monk-painters. Connected as they were with the then-unpopular school of Chan Buddhism, their paintings were discarded and ignored. Some paintings survived after being transported to Japan by visiting Zen monks, but the school of Chan painting gradually diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Ortiz, Valérie Malenfer; ''Dreaming the southern song landscape: the power of illusion in Chinese painting'', BRILL 1999, {{ISBN|978-90-04-11011-3}} p161-2&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qing Dynasty====
During the Qing Dynasty, Manchu emperors supported Buddhist practices for a range of political and personal reasons. The [[Shunzhi Emperor]] was a devotee of Chan Buddhism, while his successor, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] promoted [[Tibetan Buddhism]], claiming to be the human embodiment of the bodhisattva [[Manjusri]].&lt;ref&gt;Weidner, Marsha Smith, and Patricia Ann Berger. Latter Days of the Law : Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850-1850. Lawrence, KS: Spencer Museum of Art, University of Kansas, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was under the rule of the third Qing ruler, the [[Qianlong Emperor]], that imperial patronage of the Buddhist arts reached its height in this period. He commissioned a vast number of religious works in the Tibetan style, many of which depicted him in various sacred guises.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.113&lt;/ref&gt;

Works of art produced during this period are characterized by a unique fusion of Tibetan and Chinese artistic approaches. They combine a characteristically Tibetan attention to iconographic detail with Chinese-inspired decorative elements. Inscriptions are often written in Chinese, Manchu, Tibetan, Mongolian and Sanskrit, while paintings are frequently rendered in vibrant colors.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114-118&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p.webm|thumb|Vairochana the Cosmic Buddha 720p]]
Additionally, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] initiated a number of large-scale construction projects; in 1744 he rededicated the [[Yonghe Temple]] as Beijing's main Tibetan Buddhist monastery, donating a number of valuable religious paintings, sculptures, textiles and inscriptions to the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Berger 1994, pg.114&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xumi Fushou Temple]], and the works housed within, is another project commissioned by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] that embodies the unique blend of Tibetan and Manchu artistic styles that characterized Buddhist art produced in China under Qianlong's reign.

After the [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s abdication in 1795, the popularity of Tibetan Buddhism at the Qing court declined. The motives behind the Qing emperors' promotion of Tibetan Buddhism have been interpreted as a calculated act of political manipulation, and a means of forging ties between Manchu, Mongolian, and Tibetan communities, though this has been challenged by recent scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Patricia Ann. Empire of Emptiness : Buddhist Art and Political Authority In Qing China. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legacy====
[[File:Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p.webm|thumb|Gathering of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas 720p]]
The popularization of Buddhism in China has made the country home to one of the richest collections of Buddhist arts in the world. The [[Mogao Caves]] near [[Dunhuang]] and the [[Bingling Temple]] caves near [[Yongjing County|Yongjing]] in [[Gansu]] province, the [[Longmen Grottoes]] near [[Luoyang]] in [[Henan]] province, the [[Yungang Grottoes]] near [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] province, and the [[Dazu Rock Carvings]] near [[Chongqing]] municipality are among the most important and renowned Buddhist sculptural sites. The [[Leshan Giant Buddha]], carved out of a hillside in the 8th century during the [[Tang Dynasty]] and looking down on the confluence of three rivers, is still the largest stone Buddha statue in the world.

===Korea===
{{see also|Buddhism in Korea|Korean Buddhist sculpture|Korean art}}
[[Korea]]n Buddhist art generally reflects an interaction between other Buddhist influences and a strongly original Korean culture. Additionally, the art of the steppes, particularly Siberian and [[Scythia]]n influences, are evident in early Korean Buddhist art based on the excavation of artifacts and burial goods such as [[Silla]] [[Crown of Silla|royal crowns]], belt buckles, daggers, and comma-shaped [[gogok]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Korea/koreaonline/crown.htm |title=Crown |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Arts of Korea |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The style of this indigenous art was geometric, abstract and richly adorned with a {{clarify span|characteristic "barbarian" luxury|date=November 2012}}. Although many other influences were strong, Korean Buddhist art, "bespeaks a sobriety, taste for the right tone, a sense of abstraction but also of colours that curiously enough are in line with contemporary taste" (Pierre Cambon, ''Arts asiatiques- Guimet''').

====Three Kingdoms of Korea====
[[File:Pensive Bodhisattva 02.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], semi-seated contemplative Maitreya probably from Silla circa early 7th century.]]
The first of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] to officially receive Buddhism was [[Goguryeo]] in 372.&lt;ref name=graysonp25&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Chinese records and the use of Buddhist motifs in Goguryeo murals indicate the introduction of Buddhism earlier than the official date.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baekje]] Kingdom officially recognized Buddhism in 384.&lt;ref name=graysonp25/&gt; The [[Silla]] Kingdom, isolated and with no easy sea or land access to China, officially adopted Buddhism in 535 although the foreign religion was known in the kingdom due to the work of Goguryeo monks since the early 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=The Encyclopedia of World History: ancient, medieval, and modern, chronologically arranged |author1=Peter N.

Particularly important in the transmission of sophisticated art styles to the Korean kingdoms was the art of the "barbarian" Tuoba, a clan of non-Han Chinese Xianbei people who established the [[Northern Wei]] Dynasty in China in 386. The Northern Wei style was particularly influential in the art of the Goguryeo and Baekje. Baekje artisans later transmitted this style along with Southern Dynasty elements and distinct Korean elements to Japan. Korean artisans were highly selective of the styles they incorporated and combined different regional styles together to create a specific Korean Buddhist art style.&lt;ref&gt;Grayson (2002), pp. 27 &amp; 33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture, 5th&amp;ndash;9th Century |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |work=Timeline of Arts History |accessdate=2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Goguryeo Buddhist art exhibited vitality and mobility akin with Northern Wei prototypes, the Baekje Kingdom was also in close contact with the [[Southern Dynasties]] of China and this close diplomatic contact is exemplified in the gentle and proportional sculpture of the Baekje, epitomized by Baekje sculpture exhibiting the fathomless smile known to art historians as the [[Baekje smile]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/kobs/hd_kobs.htm |title=Korean Buddhist Sculpture (5th–9th century) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=metmuseum.org |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Silla Kingdom also developed a distinctive Buddhist art tradition epitomized by the [[Gilt-bronze Maitreya in Meditation (National Treasure No. 83)|Bangasayusang]], a half-seated contemplative maitreya whose Korean-made twin, the Miroku Bosatsu, was sent to Japan as a proselytizing gift and now resides in the Koryu-ji Temple in Japan.&lt;ref name="kenyon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Reln275/Jap-Kor-art.htm |title=Japanese Art and Its Korean Secret |publisher=www2.kenyon.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism in the Three Kingdoms period stimulated massive temple-building projects, such as the [[Mireuksa]] Temple in the Baekje Kingdom and the [[Hwangnyongsa]] Temple in Silla.

Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Korean style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the Koryu-ji Miroku Bosatsu and the Chugu-ji Siddhartha statues. Although many historians portray Korea as a mere transmitter of Buddhism, the Three Kingdoms, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book |title=Korea: A Religious History |author=Grayson, J.H. |date=2002 |publisher=RoutledgeCurzon |isbn=9780700716050 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e1BzL2lwPqEC |page=33 |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unified Silla====
[[File:Goryeo Pagoda.jpg|thumb|160px|The Goryeo era [[Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda]] sits on the first floor of the [[National Museum of Korea]].]]
During the [[Unified Silla]] period, [[East Asia]] was particularly stable with China and Korea both enjoying unified governments. Early Unified Silla art combined Silla styles and Baekje styles. Korean Buddhist art was also influenced by new [[Tang Dynasty]] styles as evidenced by a new popular Buddhist motif with full-faced Buddha sculptures. Tang China was the cross roads of East, Central, and South Asia and so the Buddhist art of this time period exhibit the so-called international style. State-sponsored Buddhist art flourished during this period, the epitome of which is the [[Seokguram]] Grotto.

====Goryeo Dynasty====
The fall of the Unified Silla Dynasty and the establishment of the [[Goryeo]] Dynasty in 918 indicates a new period of Korean Buddhist art. The Goryeo kings also lavishly sponsored Buddhism and Buddhist art flourished, especially Buddhist paintings and illuminated sutras written in gold and silver ink. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/07/eak/ht07eak.htm]. The crowning achievement of this period is the carving of approximately 80,000 woodblocks of the [[Tripitaka Koreana]] which was done twice.

====Joseon Dynasty====
The [[Joseon Dynasty]] actively suppressed Buddhism beginning in 1406 and Buddhist temples and art production subsequently decline in quality in quantity although beginning in 1549, Buddhist art does continue to be produced.

[[File:ASURA detail Kohfukuji.JPG|thumb|left|200px|The ASURA in [[Kōfuku-ji]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] (734)]]
Before the introduction of Buddhism, [[Japan]] had already been the seat of various cultural (and artistic) influences, from the abstract linear decorative art of the indigenous Neolithic [[Jōmon]] from around 10500&amp;nbsp;BC to 300&amp;nbsp;BC, to the art during the [[Yayoi]] and [[Kofun]] periods, with developments such as [[Haniwa]] art.

The cultural exchange between India and Japan was not direct, as Japan received Buddhism through Korea, China, Central Asia and eventually India. The Japanese discovered Buddhism in the 6th century when missionary monks travelled to the islands together with numerous scriptures and works of art. The cultural contact between Indian Dharmic civilization and Japan through the adoption of Buddhist ideas and aesthetic has contributed to the development of a national cultural order in the subsequent century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Indian Influence on the Art of Japan | author = Sampa Biswas | publisher = Northern Book Centre | year = 2010 | isbn = 9788172112691 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=fLjcMfMGP10C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Japan&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwisg5jQrPrVAhWKMo8KHXxoBpEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Japan&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist religion was adopted by the state in the following century. Being geographically at the end of the [[Silk Road]], Japan was able to preserve many aspects of Buddhism at the very time it was disappearing in India, and being suppressed in Central Asia and China.

From 711, numerous temples and monasteries were built in the capital city of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], including a five-story [[pagoda]], the Golden Hall of the Horyuji, and the [[Kōfuku-ji]] temple. Countless paintings and sculptures were made, often under governmental sponsorship. Indian, Hellenistic, Chinese and Korean artistic influences blended into an original style characterized by realism and gracefulness. The creation of Japanese Buddhist art was especially rich between the 8th and 13th centuries during the periods of [[Nara period|Nara]], [[Heian period|Heian]] and [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]].
Japan developed an extremely rich figurative art for the pantheon of Buddhist deities, sometimes combined with [[Hinduism|Hindu]] and [[Shinto]] influences. This art can be very varied, creative and bold.

From the 12th and 13th, a further development was [[Zen]] art, and it faces golden days in [[Muromachi Period]], following the introduction of the faith by [[Dogen]] and [[Eisai]] upon their return from China. Zen art is mainly characterized by original paintings (such as [[sumi-e]]) and poetry (especially [[haiku]]s), striving to express the true essence of the world through impressionistic and unadorned "non-dualistic" representations. The search for enlightenment "in the moment" also led to the development of other important derivative arts such as the [[Chanoyu]] tea ceremony or the [[Ikebana]] art of flower arrangement. This evolution went as far as considering almost any human activity as an art with a strong spiritual and aesthetic content, first and foremost in those activities related to combat techniques ([[martial art]]s).

Buddhism remains very active in Japan to this day. Still around 80,000 Buddhist temples are preserved. Many of them are in wood and are regularly restored.

===Tibet and Bhutan===
{{See also|Bhutanese art|Tibetan art}}
[[File:Yama tibet.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]] 18th century, Tibet]]
[[Tantric Buddhism]] started as a movement in eastern India around the 5th or the 6th century. Many of the practices of Tantric Buddhism are derived from [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] (the usage of [[mantra]]s, [[yoga]], or the burning of sacrificial offerings). Tantrism became the dominant form of Buddhism in [[Tibet]] from the 8th century. Due to its geographical centrality in Asia, Tibetan Buddhist art received influence from Indian, [[Nepal]]i, Greco-Buddhist and Chinese art.

One of the most characteristic creations of Tibetan Buddhist art are the [[mandala]]s, diagrams of a "divine temple" made of a circle enclosing a square, the purpose of which is to help Buddhist devotees focus their attention through meditation and follow the path to the central image of the Buddha.
Artistically, Buddhist [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] art and Hindu art tend to be the two strongest inspirations of Tibetan art.

In 10th to 11th centuries, [[Tabo Monastery]] in [[Himachal Pradesh]], Northern India (at that time part of Western Tibet Kingdom) serves an important role as an intermediary between India and Tibet cultural exchange, especially Buddhist art and philosophy. Notable example of Tibetan Buddhist art in Tabo is its exquisite frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Tabo: a lamp for the kingdom : early Indo Tibetan Buddhist art in the western Himalaya, Archeologia, arte primitiva e orientale | author1 =Deborah E.

===Vietnam===
[[File:National Museum Vietnamese History 35 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|The boy Buddha rising up from lotus. Crimson and gilded wood, Trần-Hồ dynasty, Vietnam, 14th-15th century]]
Chinese influence was predominant in the north of [[Vietnam]] (Tonkin) between the 1st and 9th centuries, and [[Confucianism]] and Mahayana Buddhism were prevalent. Overall, the art of Vietnam has been strongly influenced by Chinese Buddhist art.

In the south thrived the former kingdom of [[Champa]] (before it was later overtaken by the Vietnamese from the north). [[Champa]] had a strongly Indianized art, just as neighboring [[Cambodia]]. Many of its statues were characterized by rich body adornments. The capital of the kingdom of Champa was annexed by Vietnam in 1471, and it totally collapsed in the 1720s, while [[Cham (Asia)|Cham people]] remain an abundant minority across [[Southeast Asia]].

==Southern Buddhist art==
The orthodox forms of Buddhism, also known as Southern Buddhism are still practised in Sri Lanka, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia. During the 1st century CE, the trade on the overland Silk Road tended to be restricted by the rise of the [[Parthia]]n empire in the [[Middle East]], an unvanquished enemy of [[Roman Empire|Rome]], just as Romans were becoming extremely wealthy and their demand for Asian luxury was rising. This demand revived the sea connections between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and China, with India as the intermediary of choice. From that time, through trade connections, commercial settlements, and even political interventions, India started to strongly influence [[Southeast Asia]]n countries. Trade routes linked India with southern [[Burma]], central and southern [[Thailand|Siam]], lower [[Cambodia]] and southern [[Vietnam]], and numerous urbanized coastal settlements were established there.

[[File:CambodianBuddha.JPG|thumb|upright|A Cambodian Buddha, 14th century]]
For more than a thousand years, Indian influence was therefore the major factor that brought a certain level of cultural unity to the various countries of the region. The [[Pāli|Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] languages and the Indian script, together with [[Mahayana]] and [[Theravada]] Buddhism, [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanism]] and [[Hinduism]], were transmitted from direct contact and through sacred texts and Indian literature such as the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]. This expansion provided the artistic context for the development of Buddhist art in these countries, which then developed characteristics of their own.

Between the 1st and 8th centuries, several kingdoms competed for influence in the region (particularly the Cambodian [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] then the Burmese [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdoms) contributing various artistic characteristics, mainly derived from the Indian [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] style. Combined with a pervading Hindu influence, Buddhist images, votive tablets and Sanskrit inscriptions are found throughout the area. Between 8th- and 12th-century, under the patronage of [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]], arts and ideas of Buddhism and Hinduism co-developed and became increasingly intermeshed.&lt;ref name=richardblurton202/&gt; However, with Muslim invasion and sacking of monasteries in India, states Richard Blurton,  "Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India".&lt;ref name=richardblurton202&gt;T. Richard Blurton (1994), Hindu Art, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674391895}}, pages 202-204, Quote: "Buddhism flourished in this part of India throughout the first millennium AD, especially under the patronage of Pala kings of the eighth and twelfth centuries. Towards the end of this period, popular Buddhism and Hinduism became increasingly intermeshed. However, when Muslim invaders from further west sacked the monasteries in the twelfth century, Buddhism collapsed as a major force in India."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buddha Mendut.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Dhyani Buddha [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]] inside the [[Mendut]] temple.]]

By the 8th to 9th century, [[Sailendra]]n Buddhist art were developed and flourished in [[Medang Kingdom|Medang Mataram]] kingdom of [[Central Java]], Indonesia. This period marked the renaissance of Buddhist art in Java, as numerous exquisite monuments were built, including [[Kalasan]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]], [[Mendut]] and [[Borobudur]] stone mandala. The traditions would continue to the 13th century [[Singhasari]] Buddhist art of East Java.

From the 9th to the 13th centuries, Southeast Asia had very powerful empires and became extremely active in Buddhist architectural and artistic creation. The [[Sri Vijaya]] Empire to the south and the [[Khmer Empire]] to the north competed for influence, but both were adherents of Mahayana Buddhism, and their art expressed the rich Mahayana pantheon of the [[Bodhisattva]]s.
The [[Theravada]] Buddhism of the Pali canon was introduced to the region around the 13th century from [[Sri Lanka]], and was adopted by the newly founded [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]]. Since in Theravada Buddhism of the period, Monasteries typically were the central places for the laity of the towns to receive instruction and have disputes arbitrated by the monks, the construction of temple complexes plays a particularly important role in the artistic expression of Southeast Asia from that time.

From the 14th century, the main factor was the spread of [[Islam]] to the maritime areas of Southeast Asia, overrunning [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], and most of the islands as far as the [[Southern Philippines]]. In the continental areas, Theravada Buddhism continued to expand into Burma, [[Laos]] and Cambodia.

===Sri Lanka===
[[File:Sri lanka aukana buddha statue.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Buddha statue in Sri Lanka.]]
According to tradition, Buddhism was introduced in Sri Lanka in the 3rd century BCE by Indian missionaries under the guidance of Thera [[Mahinda (Buddhist monk)|Mahinda]], the son of the Mauryan Emperor [[Ashoka]]. Prior to the expansion of Buddhism, the indigenous population of Sri Lanka lived in an animistic world full of superstition. The assimilation and conversion of the various pre-Buddhist beliefs was a slow process. In order to gain a foothold among the rural population, Buddhism needed to assimilate the various categories of spirits and other supernatural beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} The earliest monastic complex was the [[Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya|Mahāvihāra]] at [[Anuradhapura|Anurādhapura]] founded by [[Devanampiya Tissa of Anuradhapura|Devānampiyatissa]] and presented to Mahinda Thera. The Mahāvihāra became the centre of the orthodox Theravāda doctrine and its supreme position remained unchallenged until the foundation of the [[Abhayagiri Vihāra]] around BC 89 by [[Valagamba of Anuradhapura|Vaţţagāmaņĩ]].

The Abhayagiri Vihāra became the seat of the reformed Mahāyāna doctrines. The rivalry between the monks of the Mahāvihāra and the Abhayagiri led to a further split and the foundation of the [[Jetavanaramaya|Jetavanarama]] near the Mahāvihāra. The main feature of Sinhala Buddhism was its division into three major groups, or ''nikāyas'', named after the three main monastic complexes at Anurādhapura; the Mahāvihāra, the Abhayagiri, and the Jetavanārāma. This was the result in the deviations in the disciplinary rules ''(vinaya)'' and doctrinal disputes. All the other monasteries of Sri Lanka owed ecclesiastical allegiance to one of the three. Sri Lanka is famous for its creations of Buddhist sculptures made of stone and cast in bronze alloy.&lt;ref&gt;von Schroeder, Ulrich. 1990. ''Buddhist Sculptures of Sri Lanka''.

===Myanmar===
[[File:Buddha 00004.JPG|thumb|upright|A Mandalay-style statue of Buddha]]
A neighbor of India, [[Myanmar]] (Burma) was naturally strongly influenced by the eastern part of Indian territory. The [[Mon people|Mon]] of southern Burma are said to have been converted to Buddhism around 200&amp;nbsp;BC under the proselytizing of the Indian king [[Ashoka]], before the schism between [[Mahayana]] and [[Hinayana]] Buddhism.

Early Buddhist temples are found, such as Beikthano in central Myanmar, with dates between the 1st and the 5th centuries. The Buddhist art of the Mons was especially influenced by the Indian art of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] and post-Gupta periods, and their mannerist style spread widely in Southeast Asia following the expansion of the Mon Empire between the 5th and 8th centuries.

Later, thousands of Buddhist temples were built at [[Bagan]], the capital, between the 11th and 13th centuries, and around 2,000 of them are still standing. Beautiful jeweled statues of the Buddha are remaining from that period. Creation managed to continue despite the seizure of the city by the [[Mongols]] in 1287.
[[File:Bodleian MS. Burm. a. 12 Life of the Buddha 15-18.jpg|thumbnail|left|Scenes from the life of the Buddha in an 18th-century Burmese watercolour]]
During the [[Ava Kingdom|Ava period]], from the 14th to 16th centuries, the Ava (Innwa) style of the Buddha image was popular. In this style, the Buddha has large protruding ears, exaggerated eyebrows that curve upward, half-closed eyes, thin lips and a hair bun that is pointed at the top, usually depicted in the bhumisparsa [[mudra]].&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part1/post_pagan_period__part_1.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 1 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Konbaung dynasty]], at the end of the 18th century, the Mandalay style of the Buddha image emerged, a style that remains popular to this day.&lt;ref name="niu2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seasite.niu.edu/burmese/cooler/Chapter_4/Part3/post_pagan_period__part_3.htm |title=The Post Pagan Period - Part 3 |publisher=seasite.niu.edu |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a marked departure from the Innwa style, and the Buddha's face is much more natural, fleshy, with naturally-slanted eyebrows, slightly slanted eyes, thicker lips, and a round hair bun at the top. Buddha images in this style can be found reclining, standing or sitting.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/mandalay_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandalay-style Buddhas wear flowing, draped robes.

Another common style of Buddha images is the Shan style, from the [[Shan people]], who inhabit the highlands of Myanmar. In this style, the Buddha is depicted with angular features, a large and prominently pointed nose, a hair bun tied similar to Thai styles, and a small, thin mouth.&lt;ref name="buddhaartgallery2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhaartgallery.com/shan_buddha_statues.html |title=buddhaartgallery.com |publisher=buddhaartgallery.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cambodia===
{{See|Khmer art|Khmer sculpture}}
[[File:Bodhisattva Lokesvara statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Bodhisattva [[Avalokitesvara|Lokesvara]], [[Cambodia]] 12th century.]]
[[Cambodia]] was the center of the [[Kingdom of Funan|Funan]] kingdom, which expanded into Burma and as far south as Malaysia between the 3rd and 6th centuries. Its influence seems to have been essentially political, most of the cultural influence coming directly from India.

Later, from the 9th to 13th centuries, the Mahayana Buddhist and Hindu [[Khmer Empire]] dominated vast parts of the Southeast Asian peninsula, and its influence was foremost in the development of Buddhist art in the region. Under the Khmer, more than 900 temples were built in Cambodia and in neighboring Thailand. The royal patronage for Khmer Buddhist art reached its new height with the patronage of [[Jayavarman VII]], a Buddhist king that built [[Angkor Thom]] walled city, adorned with the smiling face of [[Lokeshvara]] in Angkor Thom ''dvaras'' (gates) and ''prasat'' towers [[Bayon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Monuments and Temples of Cambodia and Laos | author = W.

A great deal of Cambodian Buddhist sculpture is preserved at Angkor; however, organized looting has had a heavy impact on many sites around the country.

Often, Khmer art manages to express intense spirituality through divinely beaming expressions, in spite of spare features and slender lines.

===Thailand===

[[File:Wat Si Chum in Sukhothai.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Phra Atchana [[Wat Si Chum]], [[Sukhothai Province]], [[Thailand]]]]
The Thai Buddhist art encompasses period for more than a millennia, from pre Thai culture of Dvaravati and Srivijaya, to the first Thai capital of Thai 13th century Sukhothai, all the way to  succeeding Thai kingdoms of Ayutthaya and Rattanakosin.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"&gt;{{cite book | title = Thai Buddhist Art: Discover Thai Art | author = Dawn F.

From the 1st to the 7th centuries, Buddhist art in [[Thailand]] was first influenced by direct contact with Indian traders and the expansion of the [[Mon (ethnic group)|Mon]] kingdom, leading to the creation of Hindu and Buddhist art inspired from the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] tradition, with numerous monumental statues of great virtuosity.

From the 9th century, the various schools of Thai art then became strongly influenced by Cambodian [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] art in the north and [[Sri Vijaya]] art in the south, both of Mahayana faith. Up to the end of that period, Buddhist art is characterized by a clear fluidness in the expression, and the subject matter is characteristic of the [[Mahayana]] pantheon with multiple creations of [[Bodhisattva]]s.

From the 13th century, [[Theravada]] Buddhism was introduced from Sri Lanka around the same time as the [[Thai ethnic groups|ethnic Thai]] kingdom of [[Sukhothai kingdom|Sukhothai]] was established.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; The new faith inspired highly stylized images in Thai Buddhism, with sometimes very geometrical and almost abstract figures.

During the [[Ayutthaya kingdom|Ayutthaya]] period (14th-18th centuries), the Buddha came to be represented in a more stylistic manner with sumptuous garments and jeweled ornamentations. Many Thai sculptures or temples tended to be [[gilding|gilded]], and on occasion enriched with inlays.

The ensuing period of [[Thonburi Kingdom|Thonburi]] and [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] saw the further development of Thai Buddhist art.&lt;ref name="Thai Buddhist Art"/&gt; By the 18th century, [[Bangkok]] was established as the royal center of the kingdom of [[Siam]]. Subsequently, the Thai rulers filled the city with imposing Buddhist monuments to demonstrate their Buddhist piety as well as to showcase their authority. Among others are the celebrated [[Wat Phra Kaew]] which hosts the [[Emerald Buddha]]. Other Buddhist temples in Bangkok includes [[Wat Arun]] with ''prang'' style towers, and [[Wat Pho]] with its famous image of [[Reclining Buddha]].

[[File:Borobudur-perfect-buddha.jpg|thumb|upright|left|A Buddha in [[Borobudur]].]]
Like the rest of Southeast Asia, [[Indonesia]] seems to have been most strongly influenced by India from the 1st century CE. The islands of [[Sumatra]] and [[Java (island)|Java]] in western Indonesia were the seat of the empire of [[Sri Vijaya]] (8th-13th century), which came to dominate most of the area around the Southeast Asian peninsula through maritime power. The Sri Vijayan Empire had adopted Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism, under a line of rulers named the [[Sailendra]]. The Sailendras was the ardent temple builder and the devoted patron of Buddhism in Java.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"&gt;{{cite book | title = Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java | author1 = Jean Philippe Vogel | author2 = Adriaan Jacob Barnouw | publisher = Asian Educational Services | year = 1936 | isbn = 9788120612259 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=wQ2x0cbZkn0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Buddhist+art+of+Java&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLm_6o6PfVAhXKo48KHUc_DuEQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Buddhist%20art%20of%20Java&amp;f=false| pages = 90–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sri Vijaya spread Mahayana Buddhist art during its expansion into the Southeast Asian peninsula. Numerous statues of Mahayana [[Bodhisattva]]s from this period are characterized by a very strong refinement and technical sophistication, and are found throughout the region. One of the earliest Buddhist inscription in Java, the [[Kalasan inscription]] dated 778, mentioned about the construction of a [[Kalasan|temple]] for the goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]].&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt;

Extremely rich and refined architectural remains are found in Java and Sumatra. The most magnificent is the temple of [[Borobudur]] (the largest Buddhist structure in the world, built  around 780-850&amp;nbsp;AD), built by Sailendras.&lt;ref name="Buddhist Art in India, Ceylon, and Java"/&gt; This temple is modelled after the Buddhist concept of universe, the [[Mandala]] which counts 505 images of the seated Buddha and unique bell-shaped stupa that contains the statue of Buddha. Borobudur is adorned with long series of bas-reliefs narrated the holy Buddhist scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Borobudur: Golden Tales of the Buddhas | author = John Miksic | publisher = Tuttle Publishing | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781462909100 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=jwzQAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=borobudur+golden+tales+of+the+buddhas&amp;hl=id&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP45O7r_rVAhWJtY8KHcpuAfYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhist%20art&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Buddhist structure in Indonesia probably is the [[Batujaya Archaeological Site|Batujaya]] stupas at Karawang, West Java, dated from around the 4th century. This temple is some plastered brick stupas. However, Buddhist art in Indonesia reach the golden era during the [[Sailendra]] dynasty rule in Java. The bas-reliefs and statues of [[Boddhisatva]], [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]], and [[Kinnara]] found in [[Kalasan]], [[Candi Sewu|Sewu]], [[Candi Sari|Sari]], and [[Candi Plaosan|Plaosan]] temple is very graceful with serene expression, While [[Mendut]] temple near Borobudur, houses the giant statue of [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]].

In [[Sumatra]] Sri Vijaya probably built the temple of Muara Takus, and [[Muaro Jambi Temple Compounds|Muaro Jambi]]. The most beautiful example of classical Javanese Buddhist art is the serene and delicate statue of [[Prajnaparamita]] (the collection of National Museum Jakarta) the goddess of transcendental wisdom from [[Singhasari]] kingdom.&lt;ref name ="VCM"&gt;{{cite web|title = Prajnaparamita | publisher =Virtual Collections of Asian Masterpieces| url  =http://masterpieces.asemus.museum/masterpiece/detail.nhn?objectId=12147| accessdate=27 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indonesian Buddhist Empire of Sri Vijaya declined due to conflicts with the [[Chola]] rulers of India, then followed by [[Majapahit]] empire.

==Contemporary Buddhist art==
[[File:Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism (1916) (14779469804).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Illustration from the book "Buddha and the gospel of Buddhism" (1916).]]
Many contemporary artists have made use of Buddhist themes. Notable examples are [[Bill Viola]], in his video installations,&lt;ref&gt;Buddha Mind in Contemporary Art, University of California Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Connell]], in sculpture,&lt;ref&gt;ARTlines, April 1983&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Allan Graham]] in his multi-media "Time is Memory".&lt;ref&gt;The Brooklyn Rail, December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK [[The Network of Buddhist Organisations]] has interested itself in identifying Buddhist practitioners across all the arts. In 2005 it co-ordinated the UK-wide Buddhist arts festival, "A Lotus in Flower";&lt;ref&gt;a poster advertising one of the events is archived here - http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050824213345/http://www.nbo.org.uk/whats%20on/poster.pdf# |date=24 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 it helped organise the two-day arts conference, "Buddha Mind, Creative Mind".&lt;ref name="blogspot"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fwbo-news.blogspot.com/2009/07/report-from-buddha-mind-creative-mind.html |title=Triratna Buddhist Community News: Report from ‘Buddha Mind - Creative Mind?’ conference |author=Lokabandhu |publisher=fwbo-news.blogspot.com |accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the latter an association of Buddhist artists was formed.&lt;ref name="ning"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dharmaarts.ning.com/ |title=Dharma Arts Network - Launched at Buddha Mind - Creative Mind ? |publisher=dharmaarts.ning.com |accessdate=2014-12-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010000408/http://dharmaarts.ning.com/# |archive-date=10 October 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17390">The '''''Callanetics''''' exercise programme was created by [[Callan Pinckney]] in the early 1980s.  It is a system of exercise involving frequent repetition of small muscular movements and squeezes, designed to improve [[muscle tone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-definition/Callanetics|title=Callanetics definition - English definition dictionary - Reverso|website=dictionary.reverso.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme was developed by Pinckney from classical ballet exercises, to help ease a back problem that she was born with.

The theory of callanetics is that the surface muscles of the body are supported by deeper muscles, but popular exercise programmes often exercise only the surface muscles.  According to callanetics, deeper muscles are best exercised using small but precise movements.  Exercising the deeper muscles also leads to improved posture, which may result in the appearance of weight loss even if very little weight was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Book: Callanetics, by Callan Pinckney and Sallie Batson, 1984, inside page&lt;/ref&gt;

Pinckney also recommends exercising with clothing that highlights (not flatters) the body's natural shape, and exercising in bright light, to show up the body's imperfections to the exerciser.

The '''Centre for Polar Observation &amp; Modelling''' ('''CPOM''') is a centre for research into [[polar region]] processes which may affect: polar atmosphere and [[ocean circulation]]; the Earth's [[albedo]]; and global [[sea levels]]. It is funded by the [[Natural Environment Research Council]], a UK [[UK Research Councils|Research Council]].&lt;ref name=CPOM&gt;[http://www.cpom.org/ CPOM Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

CPOM comprises research groups from 3 Universities: [[University College London]], [[University of Bristol]], and [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name="CPOM"/&gt;

In 2006, research carried out by CPOM resulted in the press report "Secret rivers found in Antarctic".  The survey used the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[ERS-2]] satellite radar to measure a region in [[East Antarctica]] with some of the oldest, thickest ice on the continent. The survey revealed synchronous changes in ice surface height (both rise and falls) at locations hundreds of kilometres apart. According to CPOM Director, [[Duncan Wingham]], the only conceivable mechanism for the observations was the movement of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4908292.stm |author= Helen Briggs |title= Secret rivers found in Antarctic |publisher= BBC News |date= 19 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In August 1968, CAyC was established as a multidisciplinary workshop by [[Víctor Grippo]], [[Jacques Bedel]], [[Luis Fernando Benedit]], [[Alfredo Portillos]], [[Clorindo Testa]], [[Jorge Glusberg]], and [[Jorge González (artist)|Jorge González]].&lt;ref name=VictoriaAlbertMuseum-CAyC-2016&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ravilious|first1=Ella|title=Centro de Arte y Comunicación (CAyC)|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/factory-presents/centro-de-arte-y-comunicacion-cayc|work=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|date=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jorge Glusberg was the main leader associated with CAyC.&lt;ref name=ImageTextConceptualArt-2016 /&gt;

In 1971, the "Grupo de los Trece" was created by Polish theater director [[Jerzy Grotowski]]. There were 13 artists who made up the group: [[Jacques Bedel]], [[Luis Fernándo Benedit]], [[Gregorio Dujovny]], [[Carlos Ginsburg]], [[Jorge Glusberg]], [[Victor Grippo]], [[Jorge González Mir]], [[Vicente Lucas Marotta]], [[Luis Pazos]], [[Alfredo Portillos]], [[Juan Carlos Romero (artist)|Juan Carlos Romero]], [[Julio Teich]], and [[Horacio Zabala]]. Additional artists who later joined were [[Leopoldo Maler]] and [[Clorindo Testa]]. In 1975, the group were formally named the "Grupo CAyC."&lt;ref name=BuenosAiresHerald-GlusbergAffair-2003&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tortosa|first1=Alina|title=The Glusberg affair in focus|url=http://alinatortosa.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-glusberg-affair-in-focus-jorge_25.html|work=[[Buenos Aires Herald]]|date=14 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was centered around the concept of "Arte de Sistemas" or Systemic Art.&lt;ref name=BuenosAiresHerald-GlusbergAffair-2003 /&gt;

In 1972, the "Scuola de Altos Estudios del CAyC" aka "Escuela de Altos Estudios" / "Escuela de Altos Estudios del Centro de Arte y Comunicación" was founded.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

In the seventies CAyC became an international center for the [[Pop art]]-culture and the famous Museo de Arquitectura.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Well-known teachers at CAyC have included [[Justus Dahinden]] and [[Mario Botta]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}

From 1968 until his death in early 2012, [[Jorge Glusberg]] was the Director of CAyC.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Among the [[Aztecs]], the '''Cihuacalli''' was the name given to those controlled buildings where [[prostitution]] was permitted by political and religious authorities.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} "Cihuacalli" is a [[Nahuatl]] word which means "House of Women".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The Cihuacalli was a closed compound with rooms, all of which were looking into a central patio. At the center of the patio was a statue of [[Tlazolteotl]], the goddess of "filth".{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Religious authorities believed women should work as prostitutes, if they wish, only at such premises guarded by Tlazolteotl. It was believed Tlazolteotl had the power to incite [[sexual activity]] and, at the same time, do spiritual cleansing of such acts.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

There are stories that also refer to certain places, either inside the Cihuacalli or outside, where women would perform [[erotic dance]]s in front of men.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The poet [[Tlaltecatzin of Cuauhchinanco]] noted that special "Joyful Women" would perform erotic dances at certain homes outside of the compound.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The '''Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others''' was approved by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 2 December 1949&lt;ref&gt;General Assembly resolution 317(IV)&lt;/ref&gt; and entered into force on 25 July 1951. The preamble states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Whereas [[prostitution]] and the accompanying evil of the [[Human trafficking|traffic in persons]] for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and endanger the welfare of the individual, the family and the community"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As at December 2013, 82 states were party to the convention (see map). An additional 13 states had signed the convention, but had not yet ratified it.&lt;ref name=ratifications&gt;[https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=VII-11-a&amp;chapter=7&amp;clang=_en Signatories and ratifications status]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention supersedes a number of earlier conventions that covered some aspects of [[forced prostitution]]. Signatories are charged with three obligations under the 1949 Convention: prohibition of trafficking, specific administrative and enforcement measures, and social measures aimed at trafficked persons. The 1949 Convention presents two shifts in perspective of the trafficking problem in that it views prostitutes as victims of the procurers, and in that it eschews the terms "white slave traffic" and "women", using for the first time race- and gender-neutral language.&lt;ref name=entrepeneur&gt;[http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/90192936_2.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204041437/http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/90192936_2.html |date=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To fall under the provisions of the 1949 Convention, the trafficking need not cross international lines.&lt;ref name=entrepeneur/&gt;

==Provisions==
The Convention&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/trafficpersons.pdf Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others ]&lt;/ref&gt; requires state parties to punish any person who "procures, entices, or leads away, for purposes of prostitution, another person, even with the consent of that person", "exploits the prostitution of another person, even with the consent of that person" (Article 1), or runs a [[brothel]] or rents accommodations for prostitution purposes (Article 2). It also prescribes procedures for combating international traffic for the purpose of prostitution, including extradition of offenders.

Furthermore, state parties are required to abolish all regulations that subject prostitutes "to special registration or to the possession of a special document or to any exceptional requirements for supervision or notification" (Article 6). And also, they are required to take the necessary measure for the supervision of [[employment agency|employment agencies]] in order to prevent persons seeking employment, in particular women and children, from being exposed to the danger of prostitution (Article 20).

A dispute between the parties relating to the interpretation or application of the Convention may, at the request of any one of the parties to the dispute, be referred to the [[International Court of Justice]] (Article 22).

==Status==
A number of countries who have ratified the Convention expressed reservations in relation to the referral of disputes to the ICJ, and some countries have not ratified the Convention at all because of their objection to the presence of the article.

One of the main reasons the Convention has not been ratified by many countries is because it also applies to voluntary prostitution,&lt;ref name="Bantekas 2003 6"&gt;{{cite book |title= International Criminal Law 2/E |last= Bantekas |first= Ilias |author2=Susan Nash |year= 2003|publisher=Routledge |location= Cavendish |isbn= 1859417760 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MyP4tSaMA_IC&amp;vq=involuntary+prostitution&amp;dq=%22involuntary+prostitution%22+definition&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the presence of the term "even with the consent of that person" in Article 1. For example, in countries such as [[Germany]],&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_PTVTNVR|title=Prostitution: Sex is their business|date=2 September 2004|accessdate=15 December 2009|publisher=The Economist}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004" /&gt; [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref name="Economist-prostitution-2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TNVTGVRN|title=Policing prostitution: The oldest conundrum|publisher=The Economist|date=30 October 2008|accessdate=11 January 2010}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18368.htm US Department of State Report - Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkey]], and other countries, voluntary prostitution is legal and regulated as an "occupation".

The [[Trafficking protocol]] (2000) to the [[United Nations]] [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] has used a different definition of "trafficking" to that in the 1949 Convention,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antislavery.org/homepage/resources/Weissbrodt%20report%20final%20edition%202003.pdf Convention against Transnational Organized Crime] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050525114642/http://www.antislavery.org/homepage/resources/Weissbrodt%20report%20final%20edition%202003.pdf |date=2005-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been ratified by many more countries.

The [[Centre for Human Rights]], specifically the secretariat of the Working Group on Slavery, in close co-operation with the [[Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs]] of the Department of International Economic and Social Affairs, actively monitors the Convention.

The '''date of birth of [[Jesus]] ''' is not stated in the [[gospels]] or in any secular text but most scholars assume a date of birth between 6 BC and 4 BC.&lt;ref name=JDG324 &gt;{{Cite journal | first = James DG | last = Dunn | title = Jesus Remembered | publisher = Eerdmans Publishing | year = 2003 | page = 324}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical evidence is too incomplete to allow a definitive dating,&lt;ref&gt;Doggett. (2000). [http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEhelp/calendars.html "Calendars"] (Ch. 12), in P. Kenneth Seidelmann (Ed.) ''Explanatory supplement to the astronomical almanac.'' Sausalito, CA: University Science Books. {{ISBN|0-935702-68-7}}. p579: "Although scholars generally believe that Christ was born some years before AD 1, the historical evidence is too sketchy to allow a definitive dating".&lt;/ref&gt; but the date is estimated through two different approaches—one by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] accounts in the [[Gospel of Luke|Gospels of Luke]] and [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and the second by working backwards from the estimation of the start of the [[ministry of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul &gt;[[Paul L. Maier]] "The Date of the Nativity and Chronology of Jesus" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos: nativity and chronological studies'' by Jerry Vardaman, Edwin M. Yamauchi 1989 {{ISBN|0-931464-50-1}} pp. 113–129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Niswonger121 &gt;''New Testament History'' by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 {{ISBN|0-310-31201-9}} pp. 121–124&lt;/ref&gt;

==Estimation via the Nativity accounts==
The [[Nativity of Jesus|nativity]] accounts in the [[New Testament]] gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] do not mention a date or time of year for the birth of Jesus, and [[Karl Rahner]] states that the gospels do not, in general, provide enough details of dates to satisfy the demands of modern historians.&lt;ref name=Rahner732 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum Mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} p. 731&lt;/ref&gt; Mainstream scholars do not see the Luke and Matthew nativity stories as historically factual,&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Borg]], "The Meaning of the Birth Stories" in Marcus Borg, N T Wright, ''The Meaning of Jesus: Two Visions'' (Harper One, 1999) page 179: "I (and most mainline scholars) do not see these stories as historically factual."&lt;/ref&gt; and for this reason, they do not consider them a reliable method for determining Jesus' date of birth.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, E. P. ''The historical figure of Jesus''. Penguin, 1993, pages 85–88&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Rahner]] states that the authors of the gospels generally focused on theological elements rather than historical chronologies.&lt;ref name=Rahner731 &gt;''Encyclopedia of theology: a concise Sacramentum Mundi'' by [[Karl Rahner]] 2004 {{ISBN|0-86012-006-6}} page 731&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Luke and Matthew associate Jesus' birth with the time of [[Herod the Great]].&lt;ref name="Rahner731"/&gt; [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#2:1|Matthew 2:1]] states that "Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king". He also implies that Jesus could have been as much as two years old at the time of the visit of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]], because Herod ordered the murder of all boys up to the age of two years, "in accordance with the time he had learned from the Magi". [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Matthew#2:16|Matthew 2:16]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | first = Edwin D | last = Freed | title = Stories of Jesus' Birth | publisher = Continuum International | year = 2004 | page = 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars agree that Herod died in 4 BC, although a case has also been made that Herod died only in 1 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Timothy David|title=The Date of Herod's Death|journal=[[Journal of Theological Studies]]|issue=19|year=1968|pp=204–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bernegger|first=P.

[[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#1:5|Luke 1:5]] mentions the reign of Herod shortly before the birth of Jesus,&lt;ref name=Niswonger121 /&gt; but places the birth during the [[Census of Quirinius]], which only took place ten years later in AD 6 as described by the Jewish historian [[Josephus]].&lt;ref name=Rahner731 /&gt; He, in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (c. AD 93), indicates that Cyrenius/Quirinius' governorship of Syria began in AD 6, and Josephus mentions a census sometime between AD 6–7.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Josephus. [https://books.google.com/books?id=E5dCAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=josephus+antiquities+of+the+jews&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Antiquities of the Jews'', Book 18, Chapters 1–2]. Josephus indicates that the census under Cyrenius (i.e., Quirinius) occurred in the 37th year after Octavian's (i.e., Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus') victory over Marc Antony at Actium, which secular historical records date to 2 September 31 BC. Therefore 31 BC + 37 years = AD 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars believe Luke made an error in referring to the census.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Archer | first=Gleason Leonard | authorlink=Gleason Leonard Archer | title=Encyclopedia of Bible Difficulties |date=April 1982  | publisher=Zondervan Pub.

As far as the month of Jesus' birth, it can be inferred to be summer or fall. Combining inferences from when shepherds would likely be in the fields and working backward from Zechariah's priestly service (John the Baptist's father) and its connections to Jesus' birth, one arrives at a likely date of mid-September to early October. This would suggest the conception of Jesus might have been in December, but not his birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bibleinfo.com/en/questions/when-was-jesus-born|title=When was Jesus born? {{!}} Bibleinfo.com|website=www.bibleinfo.com|language=en|access-date=1 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://christinprophecy.org/articles/when-was-jesus-born/|title=When Was Jesus Born?|work=Lamb and Lion Ministries|access-date=1 December 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working backwards from when Jesus began preaching==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Pharisees Question Jesus (Les pharisiens questionnent Jésus) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|left|Dispute of Jesus and the Pharisees, by [[James Tissot]], c. 1890]]
Another approach to estimating the year of birth works backwards from when Jesus began preaching, based on the statement in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:23|Luke 3:23]] that he was "about 30 years of age" at that time.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 &gt;''The Cradle, the Cross, and the Crown: An Introduction to the New Testament'' by [[Andreas J. Köstenberger]], L. Scott Kellum 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-8054-4365-3}} page 114&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus began to preach after being baptised by [[John the Baptist]], and based on Luke’s gospel John only began baptising people in "the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar" ([[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#3:1|Luke 3:1–2]]), which scholars estimate would be in about AD 28–29.&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Eerdmans Dictionary of the Bible'' 2000 Amsterdam University Press {{ISBN|90-5356-503-5}} page 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1'' by Craig A. Evans 2003 {{ISBN|0-7814-3868-3}} pages 67–69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoehner 1978 29–37"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Chronological Aspects of the Life of Christ | last = Hoehner| first = Harold W | authorlink = Harold Hoehner|year= 1978|publisher=Zondervan |isbn= 0-310-26211-9|pages= 29–37| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6z-NcR7fVSIC&amp;dq=CHronological+Aspects+of+the+Life+of+Christ}}&lt;/ref&gt; By working backwards from this, it would appear that Jesus was probably born no later than 1 BC. However, if the phrase "about 30" is interpreted to mean 32 years old, this could fit a date of birth just within the reign of Herod, who died in 4 BC.&lt;ref name=ChronosPaul /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kostenberger140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Novak302 &gt;''Christianity and the Roman Empire: background texts'' by Ralph Martin Novak 2001 {{ISBN|1-56338-347-0}} pages 302–303&lt;/ref&gt;

This date is independently confirmed by John's reference in [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/John#2:20|John 2:20]] to the Temple being in its 46th year of construction during Passover when Jesus began his ministry, which corresponds to around 27–29 AD according to scholarly estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Jack V. Scarola, "A Chronology of the nativity Era" in ''Chronos, kairos, Christos 2'' by Ray Summers, Jerry Vardaman 1998 {{ISBN|0-86554-582-0}} pages 61–81&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christmas celebration==
Despite the celebration of Christmas in December, neither Luke nor Matthew mentions a season for when Jesus was born. However, scholarly arguments regarding the realism of shepherds grazing their flock during the winter have taken place, both challenging a winter birth for Jesus as well as defending it by relying on the mildness of winters in ancient Israel and [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic]] rules regarding sheep near Bethlehem before February.&lt;ref&gt;"New Testament History" by Richard L. Niswonger 1992 {{ISBN|0-310-31201-9}} pp. 121–124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Luke: an introduction and commentary'' by Leon Morris 1988 {{ISBN|0-8028-0419-5}} p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Stories of Jesus' Birth'' by Edwin D. Freed 2004 {{ISBN|0-567-08046-3}} pp. 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Murray of ''History Today'' says that the celebration of [[Christmas]] as the birth day of Jesus is based on a date of a pagan feast rather than historical analysis.&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;Murray, Alexander, [http://www.historytoday.com/alexander-murray/medieval-christmas "Medieval Christmas"], ''History Today'', December 1986, '''36''' (12), pp. 31–39.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saturnalia]], the Roman feast for Saturn, was associated with the [[winter solstice]]. Saturnalia was held on 17 December of the Julian calendar and later expanded with festivities through to 23 December. The holiday was celebrated with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn, in the Roman Forum, and a public banquet, followed by private gift-giving, continual partying, and a carnival atmosphere that overturned Roman social norms. It is likely that such a Christian feast was chosen for Christ's marked contrast and triumph over paganism; indeed, new converts who attempted to introduce pagan elements into the Christian celebrations were sharply rebuked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=7399|title=Library : History &amp; Origin: Feast of the Nativity|website=www.catholicculture.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

December 25 may have been selected due to its proximity to the winter solstice, because of its theological significance. After the solstice, the days begin to lengthen with more sunlight, which Christians see as representing the [[Light of Christ]] entering the world. This mirrors the celebration of the [[Nativity of Saint John the Baptist]] on June 24, near the [[summer solstice]]; John said of Jesus "He must increase, I must decrease." {{bibleref2|John 3:30|NRSV}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catholic.com/qa/why-do-we-celebrate-jesus-birth-on-december-25|title=Why do we celebrate Jesus' birth on December 25? - Catholic Answers|website=www.catholic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1st and 2nd centuries, the [[Lord's Day]] (Sunday) was the earliest Christian celebration and included a number of theological themes. In the 2nd century, the [[Resurrection of Jesus]] became a separate feast as [[Easter]] and in the same century [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] began to be celebrated in the Churches of the East on 6 January.&lt;ref&gt;''An introductory dictionary of theology and religious studies'' by Orlando O. Espín, James B. Nickoloff 2007 {{ISBN|0-8146-5856-3}} page 237&lt;/ref&gt; The festival of the Nativity which later turned into Christmas was a 4th-century feast in the [[Western Church]] notably in Rome and North Africa, although it is uncertain exactly where and when it was first celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;''Christian worship in Reformed Churches past and present'' by Lukas Vischer 2002 {{ISBN|0-8028-0520-5}} pages 400–401&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest source stating 25 December as the date of birth of Jesus is likely by [[Hippolytus of Rome]], written very early in the 3rd century, based on the assumption that the conception of Jesus took place at the [[Spring equinox]] which he placed on 25 March, and then added nine months – festivals on that date were then celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;''Mercer Dictionary'' of the Bible by Watson E. Mills, Edgar V. McKnight and Roger A. Bullard 2001 {{ISBN|0-86554-373-9}} page 142&lt;/ref&gt; 25 March would also roughly be the date of his crucifixion, which ancient Christians would have seen as confirming the date of his birth, since there was a notion that the great prophets were conceived into the afterlife on the same date they were conceived into the world.  [[John Chrysostom]] also argued for a 25 December date in the late 4th century, basing his argument on the assumption that the offering of incense in Luke 1:8–11 was the offering of incense by a high priest on [[Yom Kippur]] (early October), and, as above, counting fifteen months forward. However, this was very likely a retrospective justification of a choice already made rather than a genuine attempt to derive the correct birth date.&lt;ref&gt;Roger T. Beckwith (2001). Calendar and chronology, Jewish and Christian: biblical, intertestamental and patristic studies, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, 25 December might be a reference to the date of the Feast of the Dedication, which occurs on the 25 Kislev of the Jewish calendar.  This would require that early Christians simply translated Kislev directly to December.

In Islam, the Quran references a fruit branch which Mary shook as she gave birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=3YhpAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Quran+Jesus+19&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ4_H4_4_YAhWMNY8KHd1OAG8Q6AEIWzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20Jesus%2019&amp;f=false|title=Women in the Qur'an, Traditions, and Interpretation|last=Stowasser|first=Barbara Freyer|date=22 August 1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199761838|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fruit, the date, is known to ripen during the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dateland.com/how-are-dates-grown/|title=How are Dates Grown?

The '''Department of Mathematics and Statistics''' is an [[academic department]] at [[McGill University]]. It is located in [[Burnside Hall]] at McGill's downtown campus in [[Montreal]].

==History==
Mathematics was taught at McGill as early as 1848 when it was a discipline of [[Natural philosophy|Natural Philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Arts and Science|chapter-url=http://www.archives.mcgill.ca/resources/guide/vol1/rg32.htm|title=Guide to Archives Resources at McGill University|volume=1|year=1985|isbn=0-7717-0117-9|editor-first=Marcel|editor-last=Caya|publisher=McGill University Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematics at McGill was initially divided into two largely independent departments, one under the [[McGill University Faculty of Science|Faculty of Arts and Science]] and another under the [[McGill University Faculty of Engineering|Faculty of Engineering]]; the two departments merged in 1924 under the chairmanship of [[Daniel Murray (mathematician)|Daniel Murray]].{{r|genest|p=406}} Still, mathematics remained subsidiary to other programs, owing to McGill's emphasis on [[engineering]] and British-style [[applied mathematics]].{{r|mathcan|page=105}} Until 1945, Mathematics was almost wholly a service department with only seven faculty members. Though a small graduate program was shared with the Physics Department, most of the students in the program were headed for further graduate work in physics.{{r|learning|p=342}}

In 1945, Department members Lloyd Williams and Gordon Pall founded the [[Canadian Mathematical Society|Canadian Mathematical Congress]], which took the lead in persuading the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] to make funds available for the support of [[pure mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=1523|encyclopedia=Companion Encyclopedia of the History and Philosophy of the Mathematical Sciences|volume=2|editor-first=Ivor|editor-last=Grattan-Guiness|publisher=Routledge|location=London|date=1994|isbn=0-415-09239-6|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ZptYDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1523|title=Mathematics in Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, as chairman of the Department, A. H. S. Gillon initiated in 1945 an Applied Mathematics program and in 1948 recommended for appointment to a professorship [[Hans Zassenhaus]], a pure mathematician who began to attract a number of strong graduate students into his program. Zassenhaus, along with Professors Wacław Kozakiewicz, [[Charles Fox (mathematician)|Charles Fox]], Edward Rosenthall, and [[P. R. Wallace|Phil Wallace]], was instrumental in developing the Department's Graduate School.{{r|genest|p=409}} McGill's first mathematics [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] was awarded to [[Joachim Lambek]], who obtained his doctorate in 1950 under Zassenhaus's supervision.&lt;ref name=scimeeting&gt;{{cite conference|date=2 December 2014|conference=Faculty of Science: Meeting of Faculty|location=Montreal|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/science/files/science/facultyagendadocuments-december_2_2014-_one_file_combined_0.pdf|title=Resolution on the Death of Emeritus Professor Joachim (Jim) Lambek, Department of Mathematics and Statistics|first=Henri|last=Darmon|author-link=Henri Darmon|publisher=[[McGill University]]|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, as public funds came to the university and a larger budget became available, the newly appointment chairman, Edward Rosenthall, concentrated on building a balanced and well-qualified academic team, which could sustain a vigorous graduate program along with the demands made upon the Department in a service capacity. [[Mathematical analysis|Analysis]] and [[algebra]] became strong elements in the Department's program in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, and there was also a lively interest in [[statistics]] and in [[applied mathematics]].{{r|learning|page=343}} Research in [[category theory]] began in 1966, when Lambek decided to promote the subject at McGill.&lt;ref name=bunge&gt;{{cite journal|title=Category Theory at McGill, 1966-2006 (A Personal View)|first=Marta|last=Bunge|authorlink=Marta Bunge|location=Montreal|date=January 2006|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274635769_Category_Theory_at_McGill_1966-2006_A_personal_view}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of full-time staff in the Department had grown to 36 by 1960, and to 56 by 1970.{{r|learning|page=362}} 

The Departmental library was established in 1971, and dedicated in 1987 in honour of Edward Rosenthall.&lt;ref name=rosenthal&gt;{{cite web|title=Edward Rosenthall Mathematics and Statistics Library|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/historicalcollections/library-archival/edward-rosenthall|website=Historical Collections|publisher=McGill University|access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its closure in 2015, the Rosenthall Library held over 14,000 [[Scientific journal|mathematics journals]] dating from the nineteenth century, more than 10,000 [[monograph]]s, as well as a collection of rare mathematics books.{{r|rosenthal}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rosenthall Library|date=24 January 2016|first=Jason|last=Polak|website=Aleph Zero Categorical|url=http://blog.jpolak.org/?p=1647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multimedia instructional design principles==

Beginning with [[Cognitive load|cognitive load theory]] as their motivating scientific premise, researchers such as [[Richard E. Mayer]], [[John Sweller]], and Roxana Moreno established within the scientific literature a set of multimedia instructional design principles that promote effective learning.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R. E., &amp; Moreno, R., "Nine ways to reduce cognitive load in multimedia learning." Educational psychologist, 38(1), 43-52, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, R., &amp; Mayer, R, "Interactive multimodal learning environments." Educational Psychology Review, 19(3), 309-326, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R. C., Nguyen, F., &amp; Sweller, J., "Efficiency in learning: Evidence-based guidelines to manage cognitive load." John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these principles have been "field tested" in everyday learning settings and found to be effective there as well.&lt;ref&gt;Harskamp, E. G., Mayer, R. E., &amp; Suhre, C., "Does the modality principle for multimedia learning apply to science classrooms?" Learning and Instruction, 17(5), 465-477, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chang, C. C., &amp; Yang, F.

Y., Low, R., &amp; Sweller, J., "Reducing cognitive load by mixing auditory and visual presentation modes," Journal of educational psychology, 87(2), 319, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerven, P.

G., "The efficiency of multimedia learning into old age," British Journal of Educational Psychology, 73(4), 489-505, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Research using learners who have greater prior knowledge in the lesson material sometimes finds results that contradict these design principles. This has led some researchers to put forward the "expertise effect" as an instructional design principle unto itself.&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A. E., Wouters, P., Van Gog, T., &amp; Van Merriënboer, J. J. G., "An expertise reversal effect of segmentation in learning from animations," Computers in Human Behavior, 27, 46-52, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A., Wouters, P., Van Gog, T., &amp; Van Merrienboer, J. J., "An expertise reversal effect of segmentation in learning from animated worked-out examples," Computers in Human Behavior, 27(1), 46-52, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blayney, P., Kalyuga, S., &amp; Sweller, J. "Interactions between the isolated–interactive elements effect and levels of learner expertise: Experimental evidence from an accountancy class," Instructional Science, 38(3), 277-287, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalyuga, S., Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "Incorporating learner experience into the design of multimedia instruction," Journal of Educational Psychology, 92, 126–136, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The underlying theoretical premise, cognitive load theory, describes the amount of mental effort that is related to performing a task as falling into one of three categories: germane, intrinsic, and extraneous.&lt;ref&gt;Sweller, J (June 1988). "Cognitive load during problem solving: Effects on learning". Cognitive Science 12 (2): 257–285.&lt;/ref&gt; Germane cognitive load is the mental effort required to process the task's information, make sense of it, and access and/or store it in long-term memory (for example, seeing a math problem, identifying the values and operations involved, and understanding that your task is to solve the math problem). Intrinsic cognitive load is the mental effort required to perform the task itself (for example, actually solving the math problem). Extraneous cognitive load is the mental effort imposed by the way that the task is delivered, which may or may not be efficient (for example, finding the math problem you are supposed to solve on a page that also contains advertisements for books about math).

The multimedia instructional design principles identified by Mayer, Sweller, Moreno, and their colleagues are largely focused on minimizing extraneous cognitive load and managing intrinsic and germane loads at levels that are appropriate for the learner. Examples of these principles in practice include 
* Reducing extraneous load by eliminating visual and auditory effects and elements that are not central to the lesson, such as [[seductive details]] (the coherence principle)&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., Bove, W., Bryman, A., Mars, R., &amp; Tapangco, L., "When less is more: Meaningful learning from visual and verbal summaries of science textbook lessons." Journal of Educational Psychology, 88, 64–73, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harp, S.F., &amp; Mayer, R.E. "How seductive details do their damage: A theory of cognitive interest in science learning." Journal of Educational Psychology, 90, 414–434, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reducing germane load by delivering verbal information through audio presentation (narration) while delivering relevant visual information through static images or animations (the modality principle)&lt;ref&gt;Mousavi, S. Y., Low, R., &amp; Sweller, J., "Reducing cognitive load by mixing auditory and visual presentation modes." Journal of educational psychology, 87(2), 319, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., &amp; Moreno, R., "A split-attention effect in multimedia learning: Evidence for dual coding hypothesis." Journal of Educational Psychology, 83, 484–490, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Controlling intrinsic load by breaking the lesson into smaller segments and giving learners control over the pace at which they move forward through the lesson material (the segmenting principle).&lt;ref name="Moreno, R. 2007"&gt;Moreno, R., "Optimizing learning from animations by minimizing cognitive load: Cognitive and affective consequences of signaling and segmentation methods." Applied Cognitive Psychology, 21, 765–781, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A., van Gog, T., Wouters, P., &amp; van Merriënboer, J. J., "Explaining the segmentation effect in learning from animations: The role of pausing and temporal cueing." Computers &amp; Education, 59(2), 274-280, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florax, M., &amp; Ploetzner, R., "What contributes to the split-attention effect? Role of text segmentation, picture labeling, and spatial proximity." Learning and Instruction, 20, 216–224, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognitive load theory (and by extension many of the multimedia instructional design principles) is based in part on a model of [[working memory]] by [[Alan Baddeley]] and [[Graham Hitch]] who proposed that working memory has two largely independent, limited capacity sub-components that tend to work in parallel – one visual and one verbal/acoustic.&lt;ref name="Baddeley" /&gt; This gave rise to [[dual-coding theory]], first proposed by [[Allan Paivio]] and later applied to multimedia learning by [[Richard E. Mayer|Richard Mayer]]. According to Mayer,&lt;ref name=Mayer2001 /&gt; separate channels of working memory process auditory and visual information during any lesson. Consequently, a learner can use more cognitive processing capacities to study materials that combine auditory verbal information with visual graphical information than to process materials that combine printed (visual) text with visual graphical information. In other words, the multi-modal materials reduce the cognitive load imposed on working memory.

In a series of studies, Mayer and his colleagues tested Paivio's [[dual-coding theory]], with multimedia lesson materials. They repeatedly found that students given multimedia with animation and narration consistently did better on transfer questions than those who learn from animation and text-based materials. That is, they were significantly better when it came to applying what they had learned after receiving multimedia rather than mono-media (visual only) instruction. These results were then later confirmed by other groups of researchers.

The initial studies of multimedia learning were limited to logical scientific processes that centered on cause-and-effect systems like automobile braking systems, how a bicycle pump works or cloud formation. However, subsequent investigations found that the [[modality effect]] extended to other areas of learning.

===Empirically established principles===
* '''Multimedia principle:''' Deeper learning is observed when words and relevant graphics are both presented than when words are presented alone (also called the multimedia effect).&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Ruth C.|last2=Mayer|first2=Richard E.|title=E-learning and the science of instruction: Proven guidelines for consumers and designers of multimedia learning.|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply put, the three most common elements in multimedia presentations are relevant graphics, audio narration, and explanatory text. Combining any two of these three elements works better than using just one or all three.
* '''Modality principle:'''  native speakers of the narration language, or when only printed words appear on the screen.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; Generally speaking, audio narration leads to better learning than the same words presented as text on the screen. This is especially true for walking someone through graphics on the screen, and when the material to be learned is complex or the terminology being used is already understood by the student (otherwise see "pre-training"). One exception to this is when the learner will be using the information as a reference and will need to look back to it again and again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic principles for online and multimedia learning|url=http://www.edgurus.com/the-basics.html|website=www.edgurus.com|publisher=EdGurus.com|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Coherence principle:''' Avoid using unnecessary content (irrelevant video, graphics, music, stories, narration, etc.) in order to minimize cognitive load imposed on memory during learning by irrelevant and possibly distracting content.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; Basically, the less learners know about the lesson content, the easier it is for them to get distracted by anything shown that is not directly relevant to the lesson. For learners with greater prior knowledge, however, some motivational imagery may increase their interest and learning effectiveness just a bit.&lt;ref&gt;Park, B., Moreno, R., Seufert, T., &amp; Brü., "Does cognitive load moderate the seductive details effect? A multimedia study." Computers in Human Behavior, 27(1), 5-10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magner, U. I., Schwonke, R., Aleven, V., Popescu, O., &amp; Renkl, A., "Triggering situational interest by decorative illustrations both fosters and hinders learning in computer-based learning environments." Learning and Instruction, 29, 141-152, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Contiguity principle:''' Keep related pieces of information together. Deeper learning occurs when relevant text (for example, a label) is placed close to graphics or when spoken words and graphics are presented at the same time, or when feedback is presented next to the answer given by the learner.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt;
* '''Segmenting principle:''' Deeper learning occurs when content is broken into small chunks.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; Break down long lessons into several shorter lessons.  Break down long text passages into multiple shorter ones.
* '''Signalling principle:''' The use of visual, auditory, or temporal cues to draw attention to critical elements of the lesson. Common techniques include arrows, circles, highlighting or bolding text, and pausing or vocal emphasis in narration.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crooks, S. M., Cheon, J., Inan, F., Ari, F., &amp; Flores, R. "Modality and cueing in multimedia learning: Examining cognitive and perceptual explanations for the modality effect." Computers in Human Behavior, 28(3), 1063-1071, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Ending lesson segments after the critical information has been given may also serve as a signalling cue.&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim, M., Antonenko, P. D., Greenwood, C. M., &amp; Wheeler, D. "Effects of segmenting, signalling, and weeding on learning from educational video." Learning, Media and Technology, 37(3), 220-235, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Learner control principle: ''' Deeper learning occurs when learners can control the rate at which they move forward through segmented content.&lt;ref name="Moreno, R. 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hasler, B. S., Kersten, B., &amp; Sweller, J., "Learner control, cognitive load and instructional animation." Applied cognitive psychology, 21(6), 713-729, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Savoji 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Savoji|first1=A.P.|last2=Hassanabadi|first2=H.|last3=Fasihipour|first3=Z.|title=The modality effect in learner-paced multimedia learning.|journal=Procedia-Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=2011|volume=30|pages=1488–1493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learners tend to do best when the narration stops after a short, meaningful segment of content is given and the learner has to click a "continue" button in order to start the next segment. Some research suggests not overwhelming the learner with too many control options, however. Giving just pause and play buttons may work better than giving pause, play, fast forward, reverse buttons.&lt;ref name="Savoji 2011" /&gt; Also, high prior-knowledge learners may learn better when the lesson moves forward automatically, but they have a pause button that allows them to stop when they choose to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Khacharem, A., Spanjers, I. A., Zoudji, B., Kalyuga, S., &amp; Ripoll, H., "Using segmentation to support the learning from animated soccer scenes: An effect of prior knowledge." Psychology of Sport and Exercise, 14(2), 154-160, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spanjers, I. A., Wouters, P., Van Gog, T., &amp; Van Merrienboer, J. J., "An expertise reversal effect of segmentation in learning from animated worked-out examples." Computers in Human Behavior, 27(1), 46-52, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hatsidimitris, G., &amp; Kalyuga, S., "Guided self-management of transient information in animations through pacing and sequencing strategies." Educational Technology Research and Development, 61(1), 91-105, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Personalization principle:''' Deeper learning in multimedia lessons occur when learners experience a stronger social presence, as when a conversational script or learning agents are used.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; The effect is best seen when the tone of voice is casual, informal, and in a 1st person ("I" or "we") or 2nd person ("you") voice.&lt;ref&gt;Kartal, G., "Does language matter in multimedia learning? Personalization principle revisited." Journal of Educational Psychology, 102(3), 615, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, of the following two sentences, the second version conveys more of a casual, informal, conversational tone: 
::A. The learner should have the sense that someone is talking directly to them when they hear the narration.
::B. Your learner should feel like someone is talking directly to them when they hear your narration.
:Also, research suggests that using a polite tone of voice ("You may want to try multiplying both sides of the equation by 10.") leads to deeper learning for low prior knowledge learners than does a less polite, more directive tone of voice ("Multiply both sides of the equation by 10."), but may impair deeper learning in high prior knowledge learners.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, N., Johnson, W. L., Mayer, R. E., Rizzo, P., Shaw, E., &amp; Collins, H., "The politeness effect: Pedagogical agents and learning outcomes." International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, 66(2), 98-112, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, B.M., DeLeeuw, K.E., &amp; Mayer, R.E. (2011). A politeness effect in learning with web-based intelligent tutors. International Journal of Human Computer Studies, 69, 70–79, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, adding pedagogical agents (computer characters) can help if used to reinforce important content. For example, have the character narrate the lesson, point out critical features in on-screen graphics, or visually demonstrate concepts to the learner.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., Dow, G., &amp; Mayer, S., "Multimedia learning in an interactive self-explaining environment: What works in the design of agent-based microworlds?" Journal of Educational Psychology, 95, 806–813, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, R., Mayer, R.E., Spires, H., &amp; Lester, J., "The case for social agency in computer-based teaching: Do students learn more deeply when they interact with animated pedagogical agents?"

Journal of Media Psychology: Theories, Methods, and Applications, 22(2), 52-60, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Pre-training principle:''' Deeper learning occurs when lessons present key concepts or vocabulary prior to presenting the processes or procedures related to those concepts.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; According to Mayer, Mathias, and Wetzel,&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R.E., Mathias, A., &amp; Wetzell, K., "Fostering understanding of multimedia messages through pretraining: Evidence for a two-stage theory of mental model construction." Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, 8, 147–154, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; "Before presenting a multimedia explanation, make sure learners visually recognize each major component, can name each component and can describe the major state changes of each component. In short, make sure learners build component models before presenting a cause-and-effect explanation of how a system works." However, others have noted that including pre-training content appears to be more important for low prior knowledge learners than for high prior knowledge learners.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, E., Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "Assimilating complex information." Learning and Instruction, 12, 61–86, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, P., "Impact of reducing intrinsic cognitive load on learning in a mathematical domain." Applied Cognitive Psychology, 20(3), 287-298, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, T., Ayres, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "The impact of sequencing and prior knowledge on learning mathematics through spreadsheet applications." Educational Technology Research and Development, 53(3), 15-24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Redundancy principle:''' Deeper learning occurs when lesson graphics are explained by audio narration alone rather than audio narration and on-screen text.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt; This effect is stronger when the lesson is fast-paced and the words are familiar to the learners. Exceptions to this principle include: screens with no visuals, learners who are not native speakers of the course language, and placement of only a few key words on the screen (i.e., labelling critical elements of the graphic image).&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, R., &amp; Mayer, R.E., "Verbal redundancy in multimedia learning: When reading helps listening." Journal of Educational Psychology, 94, 156–163, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheiter, K., Schüler, A., Gerjets, P., Huk, T., &amp; Hesse, F. W., "Extending multimedia research: How do prerequisite knowledge and reading comprehension affect learning from text and pictures." Computers in Human Behavior, 31, 73-84, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J., "Cognitive load theory and the format of instruction." Cognition and Instruction, 8, 293-332, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Expertise effect:''' Instructional methods, such as those described above, that are helpful to domain novices or low prior knowledge learners may have no effect or may even depress learning in high prior knowledge learners.&lt;ref name="Clark and Mayer book 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kalyuga, S., Chandler, P., &amp; Sweller, J. "Incorporating learner experience into the design of multimedia instruction." Journal of Educational Psychology, 92, 126–136, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLaren, B.M., DeLeeuw, K.E., &amp; Mayer, R.E. "A politeness effect in learning with web-based intelligent tutors." International Journal of Human Computer Studies, 69, 70–79, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magner, U. I., Schwonke, R., Aleven, V., Popescu, O., &amp; Renkl, A. "Triggering situational interest by decorative illustrations both fosters and hinders learning in computer-based learning environments." Learning and Instruction, 29, 141-152, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such principles may not apply outside of laboratory conditions. For example, Muller found that adding approximately 50% additional extraneous but interesting material did not result in any significant difference in learner performance.&lt;ref name="Muller2008" /&gt; There is ongoing debate concerning the mechanisms underlying these beneficial principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tabbers, Martens, Merriënboer|title=The modality effect in multimedia instructions|url=http://ou.nl/Docs/Expertise/OTEC/Publicaties/huib%20tabbers/Cognitive%20Science%202001%20Huib%20Tabbers.pdf|publisher=[[Open University of the Netherlands]]|accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on what [[Boundary critique|boundary]] conditions may apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reinwein|title=Does the Modality Effect Exist? and if So, Which Modality Effect?|journal=Journal of Psycholinguistic Research|year=2012|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w155x19117733217/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Learning theories==

{{Main article|Learning theory (education)}}

Good pedagogical practice has a theory of learning at its core. However, no single best-practice [[e-learning]] standard has emerged. This may be unlikely given the range of learning and teaching styles, the potential ways technology can be implemented and the ways in which [[educational technology]] itself is changing.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, S. and B. Newton (2003). "Models of eLearning: Technology Promise vs Learner Needs Literature Review." The International Journal of Management Education 3(3).&lt;/ref&gt; Various [[pedagogical]] approaches or [[learning theories]] may be considered in designing and interacting with [[e-learning]] programs.

'''Social-[[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]]'''&amp;nbsp;– this pedagogy is particularly well afforded by the use of discussion forums, blogs, wiki and online collaborative activities. It is a collaborative approach that opens educational content creation to a wider group including the students themselves. The [[One Laptop Per Child|One Laptop Per Child Foundation]] attempted to use a constructivist approach in its project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Constructivism Wiki.Laptop.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laurillard's conversational model'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macs.hw.ac.uk/~rjr/dolweb/docs/laurillardmoddoc.htm Informal description of Laurillard's Model]&lt;/ref&gt; is also particularly relevant to eLearning, and [[Gilly Salmon]]'s Five-Stage Model is a pedagogical approach to the use of discussion boards.&lt;ref&gt;E-moderating: The Key to Teaching and Learning Online&amp;nbsp;– Gilly Salmon, Kogan Page, 2000, {{ISBN|0-7494-4085-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cognitive perspective''' focuses on the cognitive processes involved in learning as well as how the brain works.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, B. S., and D. R. Krathwohl. (1956). Taxonomy of Educational Objectives: Handbook 1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emotional perspective''' focuses on the emotional aspects of learning, like motivation, engagement, fun, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Bååth, J. A. (1982) "Distance Students' Learning&amp;nbsp;– Empirical Findings and Theoretical Deliberations"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Behavioural perspective''' focuses on the skills and behavioural outcomes of the learning process. Role-playing and application to on-the-job settings.&lt;ref&gt;Areskog, N-H. (1995) The Tutorial Process&amp;nbsp;– the Roles of Student Teacher and Tutor in a Long Term Perspective&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Contextual perspective''' focuses on the environmental and social aspects which can stimulate learning. Interaction with other people, collaborative discovery and the importance of peer support as well as pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Black, J. &amp; McClintock, R. (1995) "An Interpretation Construction Approach to Constructivist Design."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mode neutral''' Convergence or promotion of ‘transmodal’ learning where online and classroom learners can coexist within one learning environment thus encouraging interconnectivity and the harnessing of collective intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Smith B, Reed P &amp; Jones C (2008)  ‘Mode Neutral’ pedagogy. European Journal of Open, Distance and E-learning."&lt;/ref&gt;

For many theorists, it’s the interaction between student and teacher and student and student in the online environment that enhances learning (Mayes and de Freitas 2004). Pask’s theory that learning occurs through conversations about a subject which in turn helps to make knowledge explicit has an obvious application to learning within a  [[Virtual learning environment|VLE]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen, I. E., J. Seaman, et al. (2007). Blending In: The Extent and Promise of Blended Education in the United States. Needham, M.A., The Sloan Consortium.&lt;/ref&gt;

Salmon developed a five-stage model of e-learning and e-moderating that for some time has had a major influence where online courses and online discussion forums have been used.&lt;ref name="Salmon2005"&gt;Salmon, G. (2005). E-moderating, the key to teaching and learning online. Routledge Falmer.&lt;/ref&gt; In her five-stage model, individual access and the ability of students to use the technology are the first steps to involvement and achievement. The second step involves students creating an identity online and finding others with whom to interact; online socialisation is a critical element of the e-learning process in this model. In step 3 students are giving and sharing information relevant to the course to each other. Collaborative interaction amongst students is central to step 4. The fifth step in Salmon’s model involves students looking for benefits from the system and using resources from outside of it to deepen their learning. Throughout all of this, the tutor/teacher/lecturer fulfils the role of moderator or e-moderator, acting as a facilitator of student learning.

Some criticism is now beginning to emerge. Her model does not easily transfer to other contexts (she developed it with experience from an Open University distance learning course). It ignores the variety of learning approaches that are possible within computer mediated communication (CMC) and the range of learning theories that are available (Moule 2007).

===Self-regulation===
[[Self-regulated learning]] refers to several concepts that play major roles in learning, and which have significant relevance in e-learning. Zimmerman (1998){{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}&lt;!--recently added "citation" without adequate specifics; is this a reference that's being taken from the Peter Williams book, right below? --&gt; explains that in order to develop self-regulation, learning courses should offer opportunities for students to practice strategies and skills by themselves. Self-regulation is also strongly related to a student's social sources such as parents and teachers. Moreover, Steinberg (1996) found that high-achieving students usually have high-expectation parents who monitor their children closely.&lt;ref name="Williams2004"&gt;Peter E. Williams and Chan M. Hllman(Feb.,2004). Differences in self-regulation for online learning between first-and second-generation college students.''Research in Higher Education'', Vol. 45, No.1, pp. 71-82.https://www.jstor.org/stable/40197287&lt;/ref&gt;

With the academic environment, self-regulated learners usually set their academic goals and monitor and react themselves in process in order to achieve their goals. Schunk argues, "students must regulate not only their actions but also their underlying achievement-related cognitions, beliefs, intentions and effects"(p.&amp;nbsp;359). Moreover, academic self-regulation also helps students develop confidence in their ability to perform well in e-learning courses.&lt;ref name="Williams2004" /&gt;

=== Theoretical framework ===
E-learning literature identifies an ecology of concepts, from  a bibliometric study  were identified the most used concepts associated with the use of computers in learning contexts, e.g. computer assisted  instruction (CAI), computer assisted learning (CAL), computer-based education (CBE), e-learning, learning management systems (LMS), self-directed learning (SDL), and massive open online courses (MOOC). All these concepts have two aspects in common: learning and computers; except the SDL concept, which derives from psychology, and does not necessarily apply to computer usage. These concepts are yet to be studied in scientific research, and stand in contrast to MOOCs. Nowadays, e-learning can also mean massive distribution of content and global classes for all the Internet users. E-learning studies can be focused on three principal dimensions: users, technology, and services. According to Aparicio, Bacao &amp; Oliveira&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aparicio|first=M.|last2=Bacao|first2=F.|last3=Oliveira|first3=T.|date=|year=2016|title=An e-Learning Theoretical Framework|url=http://www.ifets.info/journals/19_1/24.pdf|journal=Educational Technology &amp; Society|publisher=IEEE|volume=19 |issue=1|pages=292–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; "''The e-learning systems' theoretical framework contains the three main components of information systems. These components are people, technologies, and services. People interact with e-learning systems. E-learning technologies enable the direct or indirect interaction of the different groups of users. Technologies provide support to integrate content, enable communication, and provide collaboration tools. E-learning services integrate all the activities corresponding to pedagogical models and to instructional strategies. The complex interaction combination is the direct or indirect action with e-learning systems. At the same time, systems provide services according to the specified strategies for activities. In other words, service specifications are e-learning activities aligned with the e-learning pedagogical models and the instructional strategies''".

==Teacher use of technology==

Computing technology was not created by teachers. There has been little consultation between those who promote its use in schools and those who teach with it. Decisions to purchase technology for education are very often political decisions. Most staff using these technologies did not grow up with them.&lt;ref&gt;Laurillard, D. (2006). Rethinking University Teaching: a framework for the effective use of learning technologies. Abingdon, Oxon., RoutledgeFalmer.&lt;/ref&gt; Training teachers to use computer technology did improve their confidence in its use, but there was considerable dissatisfaction with training content and style of delivery.&lt;ref name="Galanouli2004" /&gt; The communication element, in particular, was highlighted as the least satisfactory part of the training, by which many teachers meant the use of a VLE and discussion forums to deliver online training (Leask 2002). Technical support for online learning, lack of access to hardware, poor monitoring of teacher progress and a lack of support by online tutors were just some of the issues raised by the asynchronous online delivery of training (Davies 2004).

Newer generation [[web 2.0]] services provide customizable, inexpensive platforms for authoring and disseminating multimedia-rich e-learning courses, and do not need specialised [[information technology]] (IT) support.&lt;ref&gt;Tam CW, Eastwood A. Available, intuitive and free! Building e-learning modules using web 2.0 services.Med Teach. 2012;34(12):1078-80. {{DOI|10.3109/0142159X.2012.731105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pedagogical theory may have application in encouraging and assessing online participation.&lt;ref name="Ho2002" /&gt; Assessment methods for on-line participation have reviewed.&lt;ref name="Ho2002" /&gt;

== Mission and objectives ==
The East Stratcom Team is intended to develop dedicated communication material on priority issues, where EU [[strategic communication]] needs to be improved or the EU is subject to [[disinformation]] campaigns. Such products will be put at the disposal of the EU's political leadership, press services, EU [[delegation]]s and EU Member States and are intended for the widest possible public audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-Homepage/2116/questions-and-answers-about-east-stratcom-task-force_en|title=Questions and Answers about the East StratCom Task Force - EEAS - European External Action Service - European Commission|website=EEAS - European External Action Service|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Team is designated to develop communication campaigns, targeting key [[audience]]s and focused on specific issues of relevance to those audiences, including local issues. The actions of the East Stratcom Team are built on existing work and coherent with wider EU communication efforts, including activities of the EU institutions and EU Member States.&lt;ref name="ap" /&gt;

== Key Task Force products ==
The team's positive communications products are mainly focused on the countries of the Eastern Neighbourhood and produced in the local languages of those countries. They are distributed via social media channels of the EU Delegations in the region, and are also carried on television and via other media and public events.&lt;ref name="Q &amp; A"&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions and Answers about the East StratCom Task Force|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-Homepage/2116/questions-and-answers-about-east-stratcom-task-force_en|publisher=EEAS - European External Action Service|language=en}} Material has been copied from this source. Reuse is authorised, provided the source is acknowledged.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Task Force, in cooperation with the European Commission, led the EU's six month Eastern Partnership communications campaign culminating in the November 2017 Eastern Partnership Summit in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/36233/eastern-partnership-summit-24112017_en|title=Eastern Partnership summit, 24/11/2017 - EEAS - European External Action Service - European Commission|website=EEAS - European External Action Service|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team's main product to raise awareness of disinformation is the weekly Disinformation Review (in English and Russian languages). This can provide valuable data for analysts, journalists and officials dealing with this issue. The Disinformation Review also brings the latest news and analyses of pro-Kremlin disinformation.&lt;ref name="Q &amp; A"/&gt; Launched in November 2015, the Disinformation Review has been described as "the best weekly disinformation bulletin anywhere in the West"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|title=Lecture by Edward Lucas|date=2016-07-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx_cqNR3bJA%7Clanguage=en%7Caccessdate=2018-03-19|accessdate=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The full record of the Task Force's work on disinformation is available on its website [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/ EUvsDisinfo.eu] (in [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/news/ English], [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/ru/ Russian] and [https://euvsdisinfo.eu/de/ German] languages). The team also runs the European External Action Service's [https://eeas.europa.eu/ru/eu-information-russian_ru Russian language website]. It is also possible to follow the team on Twitter and Facebook. This communicates primarily about the EU's foreign policy by publishing information about EU activities, as well as EU statements and press releases with relevance to the Eastern Neighbourhood in particular.&lt;ref name="Q &amp; A"/&gt;

== Reception and criticism ==
EU Member State Governments have strongly supported the Task Force since its inception and provide the majority of its staff.

The European Parliament has consistently supported the Task Force and called for adequate staffing and resourcing. An EP preparatory action for 2018 – "StratCom Plus" - has allocated €1.1m for the team to focus on how to counter disinformation on the EU more systematically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/25/eu-anti-propaganda-unit-gets-1m-a-year-to-counter-russian-fake-news|title=EU anti-propaganda unit gets €1m a year to counter Russian fake news|last=Rankin|first=Jennifer|date=2017-11-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of its operation, East StratCom has identified over 3,500 disinformation cases (…) These statistics highlight the global nature of the problem, and the benefit of having a body working on disinformation beyond a single country’s borders. East StratCom’s supranational view also allows it to provide valuable insights into the broader strategy and goals of pro-Kremlin disinformation operations because it can see them as a cohesive whole, rather than isolated incidents in individual countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lawfareblog.com/european-union-steps-its-fight-against-fake-news|title=The European Union Steps Up its Fight Against Fake News|date=2017-11-14|work=Lawfare|access-date=2018-03-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism ===
An article published October 2016 on Kommunikations Forum analyses the sources East StratCom use for debunking alleged disinformation. It criticizes the top three sites, Ukrainian StopFake, EU and NATO, for not being objective credible sources in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kommunikationsforum.dk/artikler/Hvad-er-EU-s-anti-propaganda-task-forces-ideologiske-fundament|title=EU tilbageviser propaganda med objektiv sandhed|last=|first=|date=26 October 2016|work=Kommunikations Forum|access-date=28 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/29394520/Analysis_of_East_StratCom_sources_for_debunking_pro-Kremlin_misinformation|title=Analysis of East StratCom sources for debunking pro-Kremlin misinformation|last=Jesper|first=Larsen|date=24 October 2016|website=Academia|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An opinion piece written by Danish commentator, Iben Thranholm, published on Russia Insider October 2015, were listed by East StratCom as pro-Kremlin disinformation. Member of the Danish Parliament, Marie Krarup, upon discovery raised the issue in January 2017, demanding Foreign Minister, Anders Samuelsen, to take action and stop ‘black listing’ of opinions, which he declined as the listing in his view was correctly labeled 'disinformation in support for Russia'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.altinget.dk/eu/artikel/udenrigsminister-dansk-debattoer-er-korrekt-opfoert-paa-propaganda-liste|title=Minister: Dansk debattør er korrekt opført på propaganda-liste|last=|first=|date=12 January 2017|website=Altinget|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response 28 commentators wrote a joint critique stressing their concern that ‘anybody with a critical view on mass immigration could end up in the black book of EU’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b.dk/kommentarer/28-kommentatorer-udenrigsministeren-stoetter-sortlistning-af-iben-thranholm|title=28 kommentatorer: Udenrigsministeren støtter sortlistning af Iben Thranholm|last=|first=|date=16 January 2017|website=Berlingske Tidende|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published October 2016 on Folkets Avis, lists several instances, where East StratCom has labelled critique of non Western immigration to EU as pro-Kremlin disinformation, regardless that neither the media or the content has any relation to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.folkets.dk/c/russisk-propaganda-EU-islamkritik|title=EU's East Stratcom: Islamkritik er russisk propaganda|last=|first=|date=6 October 2016|website=Folkets Avis|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted by investigative journalists at Danish newspaper, Politiken, showed that East StratCom along with Western media falsely blamed separatists, not government forces, in Eastern Ukraine for initiating an offensive in the area of Avdiivka in January 2017. Sources used by East StratCom included [[Inform Napalm|InformNapalm]] which the article shows has ties to Ukrainian death list, [[Myrotvorets]] (Peacemaker) that lists people including journalists as 'traitors' for expressing certain opinions or visiting separatist controlled areas in Eastern Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://politiken.dk/udland/art5851073/EU-er-fanget-i-propaganda-krigens-t%C3%A5ger|title=EU er fanget i propaganda-krigens tåger|last=|first=|date=27 February 2017|work=Politiken|access-date=28 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Emigre''''' ({{ISSN|1045-3717}}) was a graphic design magazine published by [[Emigre (type foundry)|Emigre Graphics]] between 1984 and 2005; it was first published in 1984 in [[San Francisco, California]], United States. Art-directed by [[Rudy VanderLans]] using fonts designed by his wife, [[Zuzana Licko]], ''Emigre'' was one of the first publications to use [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers and had a large influence on graphic designers moving into [[desktop publishing]] (DTP). Its variety of layouts, use of guest designers, and opinionated articles also had an effect on other design publications.

The focus of ''Emigre'' was both redundant and wandering — both positive qualities as a journal produced by a tight and evolving group of designers and writers with Vanderlans at the center. Vanderlans was typically editor, though guest-editors also appeared ([[Gail Swanlund]], Anne Burdick, Andrew Blauvelt) and the work/writing of Zuzana Licko and [[Jeffery Keedy]] reappeared throughout the magazine's history.

The magazine began in 1984 with a focus on the [[émigré]]. The first eight issues were concerned with boundaries, international culture, travel accounts and alienation (as the issues' titles suggest). The first eight issues also incorporated a dynamic aesthetic that caught the attention of designers and led to the next stage in the magazine's evolution.

Beginning with Issue 9 — devoted to the art of [[Vaughan Oliver]] at [[4AD]] — the magazine explored design in itself, devoting issues to [[Cranbrook Educational Community|Cranbrook]], the [[Macintosh]], type design and individual graphic designers. In two issues in 1992 and 1993, the magazine chronicled the work of [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] and [[Ray Gun (magazine)|Raygun]].

Increasingly, ''Emigre'' became a platform for essays and writings on design. This aspect of ''Emigre'' came to the forefront with issues in 1994 and the magazine changed its format in 1995 from its oversized layout to a text-friendlier format that debuted with Issue 33. The magazine retained this character through Issue 59 in 2001.

Emigre then took a sharp turn with four re-formatted issues in 2001 and 2002 that included one DVD ("Catfish," an experimental documentary film on the work of designer and performance artist Elliott Earls) and three compact discs (featuring the music of [[Honey Barbara]], [[The Grassy Knoll (band)|The Grassy Knoll]] and Scenic.

In its fifth and final incarnation, the last six issues of ''Emigre'' were co-published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]] as small softcover books. The last issue, The End, was published in 2005.

==Formats==
The magazine changed formats several times: it was originally published quarterly in a large format where each page measures 285&amp;nbsp;mm x 425&amp;nbsp;mm (slightly shorter than 11" x 17" or US ledger/tabloid size); starting with issue 33, each page was about 8.5" x 11" (US letter size); it changed into a multimedia format (a booklet where each page was 133&amp;nbsp;mm x 210&amp;nbsp;mm, plus a [[CD]] or [[DVD]]) starting with issue 60; and finally, starting with issue 64, the magazine became a book format, published semi-annually, where each page measured 133&amp;nbsp;mm x 210&amp;nbsp;mm. The issues in the book format were co-published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]].

'''Erotic lactation''' is [[sexual arousal]] by [[breastfeeding]] on a woman's breast.  Depending on the context, the practice can also be referred to as adult suckling, adult nursing, and adult breastfeeding.  Practitioners sometimes refer to themselves as being in an '''adult nursing relationship''' ('''ANR''').&lt;ref name="forth133-136"&gt;(Forth ''et al.'' 2006, pp. 133–136)&lt;/ref&gt; Two persons in an exclusive relationship can be called a nursing couple.

"Milk fetishism" and "lactophilia" are medical, diagnostic terms for [[paraphilia|paraphilias]] and are used for disorders according to the precise criteria of [[ICD|ICD-10]] and [[DSM-IV]].&lt;ref&gt;Schöbl, Roland (2007). ''Erotische Laktation'', Denkholz Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiology ==
Breasts, and especially nipples, are highly [[erogenous zone]]s, for both men and women. Nipple and breast stimulation of women are a near-universal aspect of [[human sexuality]], though nipples in males are not as sexualized.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;  Humans are the only primates whose female members have permanently enlarged breasts after the onset of puberty; the breasts of other primate species are enlarged only during pregnancy and nursing. One hypothesis postulates that the breasts grew as a frontal counterpart to the buttocks as primates became upright to attracting mates, a model first developed in 1967.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt; Other hypotheses include that by chance breasts act as a cushion for infant heads, are a signal of fertility, or elevate the infant's head in breastfeeding to prevent suffocation.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;  Paradoxically, there is even a school that believes that they are an [[evolutionary flaw]], and can actually suffocate a nursing infant.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;
The association of pleasure and nutrition holds true as well for the lips, also erogenous zones, where pleasure may have led to "[[kiss feeding]]", in which mothers chew food before passing it on to the child.{{efn|name=kiss feeding}}

Unintended milk flow ([[galactorrhea]]) is often caused by nipple stimulation and it is possible to reach normal milk production exclusively by suckling on the breast.  Nipple stimulation of any sort is noted in reducing the incidence of breast cancer.&lt;ref name=levin&gt;Levin, Roy J. (May 2006), "The breast/nipple/areola complex and human sexuality". ''Sexual &amp; Relationship Therapy''. '''21''' (2):237–249&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women lose the ability to be aroused while breastfeeding, and thus would not find lactation with a sexual partner to be erotic.  This can be a result of physical reasons (soreness) or psychological reasons (conflicted about her breasts being used other than for an infant).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Mindy A. (2000), ''20 Common Problems in Women's Health Care''. McGraw-Hill Professional, {{ISBN|0-07-069767-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations ==
Because female breasts and nipples are generally regarded as an important part of sexual activity in most cultures, &lt;!-- ethnic ones, for instance; like ''Islamic law'' suggests. --&gt; it is not uncommon that couples may proceed from oral stimulation of the nipples to actual breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=BP133&gt;(Forth et al, p 133)&lt;/ref&gt; In lesbian partnerships, mutual breastfeeding has been regarded as a familiar expression of affection and tenderness.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Sexual Research, Vienna 1928–1932: Universallexikon der Sittengeschichte und Sexualwissenschaft (''Universal encyclopedia of moral history and sexual science''). Digital available as CD ROM "Bilderlexikon der Erotik", Digitale Bibliothek, Berlin/Germany 2004, volume 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its issue of March 13, 2005, the London weekly ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' gave a report of a scientific survey (composed of 1690 British men) revealing that in 25 to 33% of all couples, the male partner had [[Nipple sucking|suckled]] his wife's breasts. Regularly, the men gave a genuine emotional need as their motive.&lt;ref name=times&gt;Rogers, Lois (March 13, 2005), [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article426518.ece "Earth dads give breast milk a try"]. ''The Sunday Times''. Retrieved on 2008-01-14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social implications ==
The breasts have two main roles in human society: nutritive and sexual.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;  Breastfeeding in general is considered by some to be mildly exhibitionary, especially in Western societies (see [[breastfeeding in public]]).  Breastfeeding mothers have faced legal ramifications for nursing their children into toddlerhood or in public, or for photographing themselves while nursing.&lt;ref name=giles&gt;Giles, Fiona (November 2004), "'Relational, and Strange': a Preliminary Foray into a Project to Queer Breastfeeding." ''Australian Feminist Studies''. '''19''' (45):301–314&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Nikki Sullivan, in her book ''A Critical Introduction to Queer Theory'', calls erotic lactation a manifestation of "Queer."  She defines Queer as an ideology; that is, as a "sort of vague and indefinable set of practices and (political) positions that has the potential to challenge normative knowledges and identities." Drawing on a statement of David Halperin, she continues "since queer is a positionality rather than an identity in the humanist sense, it is not restricted to gays and lesbians but can be taken up by anyone who feels marginalised as a result of their sexual practices."  The heteronormative profile of breastfeeding assumes certain norms:
*an infant between zero and twelve months old;
*motivations of nutritional and developmental benefits for the child and physiological benefits for the mother;
*possible secondary motivations of convenience and cheapness;
*practice in private, domestic settings; and
*breast milk-consumption exclusivity to the youngest infant
Additionally, any relevant third party is assumed to be the mother's [[significant other]] and this person is regulated to a supportive role to maximise the breastfeeding mother's success.&lt;ref name="giles" /&gt;

== Varieties ==
The following are various methods people employ to practice erotic lactation. They are listed according to prevalence, in decreasing order:
; Lactation games: Any kind of sexual activity which includes the woman's milk. Such activity is widespread, and often unintentional, in the time after a woman gives birth, since many women experience a [[let-down reflex]] (releasing milk) when sexually aroused.&lt;ref name=times/&gt;
; Lactation pornography: While lactation does appear in [[pornography]], it is a specialty niche and is considered taboo by many because of its proximity to incest and children.&lt;ref name="forth133-136" /&gt;  Most breast representations are without milk, and abound in the media in an erotic way both in and out of pornography.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;
; &lt;span id="anr"&gt;Adult Nursing Relationship (ANR)&lt;/span&gt;: The suckling of milk from a female's breast on a regular basis from one or more partner(s). Successful ANRs depend on a stable and long-term relationship, as otherwise it is very difficult to maintain a steady milk flow. Couples may begin an ANR by transferring regular suckling from a child to a sexual partner (e.g. spouse). Such a relationship may form as an expression of close intimacy and mutual tenderness, and may even exist without sex.&lt;ref name="forth133-136" /&gt; Breastfeeding can have a strong stabilizing effect on the partnership.&lt;ref name="forth133-136" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buttenstedt, Carl: The "Marriage of happiness": the revelation of woman: A study in nature&lt;/ref&gt; The breastfeeding woman may experience orgasms or a pleasurable let-down reflex.
:ANRs have also been employed in cases where a mother may desire to breastfeed her child, but has to find an alternative to inducing lactation.&lt;ref&gt;(Harrison 1983, p. 158)&lt;/ref&gt;  She may have difficulty beginning lactation, so she supplements the infant's suckling with that of a partner.  Or there are cases where breastfeeding was interrupted for an extended period of time as a result of infant prematurity, infant absence, or mother's illness (taking prescription medication).&lt;ref&gt;(Budin 1907, p. 48)&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, adult nursing has often caused lactation to continue until it was possible for the child to resume breastfeeding. Others may want to nurse an adopted child, so use an ANR to stimulate breast milk production before the adoption occurs.  Though such scenarios do not have erotic motivations, erotic expression may be an additional aspect of the relationship.
; Pumping: Some women experience sensual pleasure from [[breast pump|pumping milk from their breasts]] or expressing milk manually—with or without a partner. In addition to the sensual pleasure, women have reported feeling more [[gender role|feminine]] while producing milk and continue with lactation for emotional or sensual reasons after weaning a baby.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Giles: Fresh Milk – The Secret Life of Breasts, NY: Simon and Schuster; Sydney: Allen and Unwin, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
; Lactation prostitution: This is the act of breastfeeding '''adults''' for pay (not to be confused with breastfeeding infants or babies for pay, i.e.: wet nursing).  In 2003, there was a report of New Zealand brothel that offered lactation services to its clients.&lt;ref name="giles"/&gt;  Though not strictly prostitution, a Beijing restaurant offered breast-milk-based dishes on its menu.&lt;ref name="giles"/&gt;
; [[Paraphilic infantilism|Infantilism]]: The non-lactating partner assumes the role of a baby in sexual role-play.&lt;ref name="forth133-136" /&gt; Breastfeeding might play a secondary role in this type of relationship; and being pampered by "mommy", wearing diapers, or a hidden incestuous character may be the predominant motivation in this kind of relationship.
; [[BDSM]]:
:# '''Breastfeeding as a reward (or surrogate pleasure)''': Breastfeeding of the [[Submissive (BDSM)|submissive]] partner can serve as a reward for his/her submission.
:# '''Milking''': Milking of the submissive woman, or commanding her to give milk for her dominant partner.
:# '''Force-feeding''': Commanding the submissive partner to '''receive''' milk '''from''' his/her dominant partner.

== Lactation, re-lactation and induced lactation ==
Erotic lactation between partners or an adult nursing relationship may develop from natural breastfeeding of a baby. During the lactation period the partner starts to suckle on the female breast, and continues after the baby is weaned off. Milk production is continually stimulated and the milk flow continues.  According to the book ''Body parts: critical explorations in corporeality'', adult nursing may occur when an "individual, usually a mother, may choose to continue lactating after weaning a child, so that she avoids the significant physical challenge that inducing lactation can entail."&lt;ref name="forth133-136" /&gt;

However, milk production can be "artificially" and intentionally induced in the absence of any pregnancy in the woman. This is called [[induced lactation]], while a woman who has lactated before and restarts is said to [[relactation|relactate]]. This can be done by regularly sucking on the nipples (several times a day), massaging and squeezing the female breasts, or with additional help from temporary use of milk-inducing drugs, such as the [[dopamine]] [[antagonist]] [[Domperidone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

It is not necessary that the woman has ever been pregnant, and she can be well in her post-menopausal period.  Once established, lactation adjusts to demand.  As long as there is regular breast stimulation, lactation is possible.&lt;ref name=BP133/&gt;

== Adult lactation historically and culturally ==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Suck.JPG|thumb|200px|A woman suckles milk from another woman's breast]] --&gt;
Though birth is the beginning of the separation between mother and child, breastfeeding slows this process, making the mother and infant connect physically continually, sometimes for years.&lt;ref name="giles"/&gt;  As a source of nourishment, the immediacy of this connection is intensified.  Breastfeeding has a sexual element as a result of physiological factors.  In a study conducted in 1999, approximately 33 to 50 percent of mothers found breast feeding erotic, and among them 25 percent felt guilty because of this.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;  This study corroborated a study in 1949 that found that in a few cases where the arousal was strong enough to induce orgasm, some nursing mothers abandoned breastfeeding altogether.&lt;ref name=levin/&gt; In a 1988 questionnaire on orgasm and pregnancy published in a Dutch magazine for women, when asked "Did you experience, while breastfeeding, a sensation of sexual excitement?", 34 percent (or 153 total) answered in the affirmative.  An additional 71 percent answered in the affirmative when asked "Did you experience, while breastfeeding, pleasurable contractions in the uterine region"&lt;ref name=levin/&gt;

== Adult lactation in history ==
{{Expand section|date=September 2008}}
Since the European [[Middle Ages]], a multitude of subliminally erotic, visionary experiences of saints have been passed on in which breastfeeding plays a major role. One prominent example is the Lactatio of Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux]].&lt;ref&gt;Panizza, Oskar &lt;1853-1921&gt;: Die Wallfahrt nach Andechs. – 1894.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Roman Charity ===
[[File:Cimon and Pero - Hans Sebald Beham.jpg|thumb|"Cimon and Pero" by Hans Sebald Beham]]
[[File:Roman Charity - Pieter Pauwel Reubens.jpg|thumb|"[[Roman Charity]]" by Peter Paul Rubens 1612]]

[[Roman Charity]] (or ''Caritas Romana'').&lt;ref&gt;Valerius Maximus: Facta et dicta memorabilia, chapter: 5,4 De pietate in parentes.; ''English translation: Valerius Maximus, Memorable Doings and Sayings, ed. by D. R. Shackleton Bailey (Harvard University Press, 2000), vol. 1, book v, no. 4, pp. 501–503''&lt;/ref&gt; is a story of a woman, Pero, who secretly breastfeeds her father, Cimon, after he is incarcerated and sentenced to death by starvation. She is found out by a jailer, but her act of selflessness impresses officials and wins her father's release. The story comes from the Roman writer [[Valerius Maximus]] in the years AD 14–AD 37. In about AD 1362 the story was retold by the famous writer [[Giovanni Boccaccio]].&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Boccaccio: De claris mulieribus, chapter: LXV. De romana iuvencula;'' English translation: Giovanni Boccaccio, Famous Women. Edited and translated by Virginia Brown. The I Tatti Renaissance Library. Cambridge, MA, and London, England: Harvard University Press, 2001''&lt;/ref&gt;  After Boccaccio, hundreds or possibly thousands of paintings were created, which tell the story.  A variant of this story can be found at the conclusion of [[John Steinbeck]]'s 1939 novel ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''. Primarily, the story tells of a conflict. An existing taboo (implied incest and adult breastfeeding of a woman's milk) ''or'' saving a life by breaking the taboo. In this aspect there is no erotic focus to the story.

Valerius Maximus tells another story about a woman breastfeeding her mother, which is followed by the very short story of a woman breastfeeding her father. The second, father-daughter story in fact consists of one sentence only. Thirteen hundred years later, Boccaccio retells the (first) mother-daughter story, and does not mention the father-daughter story, and the first is apparently forgotten, leading to nearly all "caritas romana" oil paintings and drawings showing only the father-daughter story.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== Pre-industrial England ===
Adult suckling was used to treat ailing adults and treat illnesses including eye disease and pulmonary tuberculosis{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}. The writer Thomas Moffat recorded one physician's use of a wet nurse in a tome first published in 1655.&lt;ref&gt;(Prior 1991, p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Boswell-Penc 2006, p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islamic law ===
In traditional [[Sharia|Islamic law]], someone who suckles the breast of a woman, who is less than 2 years old&lt;ref name="sistani.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sistani.org/local.php?modules=nav&amp;nid=2&amp;bid=59&amp;pid=3089 |accessdate=July 18, 2010|title=Islamic Laws : Marriage » Conditions of pronouncing Nikah |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100119121652/http://www.sistani.org/local.php?modules=nav&amp;nid=2&amp;bid=59&amp;pid=3089 |archive-date= 19 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (besides many strict rules like that the suckling should be of such quantity that it could be said that the bones of the child were strengthened and the flesh allowed to grow. And if that cannot be ascertained, then if a child suckles for one full day and night, or if it suckles fifteen times to its fill, it will be sufficient&lt;ref name="sistani.org"/&gt;), is that woman's child through a foster relationship (the woman is then called "milk mother"). However, according to the Jurist [[Abu's-Su`ud]] (c.1490–1574), this only applies to sucklings under the age of two and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;(Imber 1997, p. 195)&lt;/ref&gt; Also, according to Ayatollah Ali Sistani, a highly praised scholar for the Shia Muslims: "The child should not have completed two years of his age".&lt;ref name="sistani.org"/&gt; The same latter source states at least 8 conditions that should apply before that child is considered a son/daughter of the feeding woman. A modern Saudi Jurist, in 1983, upheld that if a man suckles from his wife, their marriage is nullified.&lt;ref&gt;(Abdella Doumato 2000, p. 273)&lt;/ref&gt;  The query remains a popular one into the 21st century, and has come up in Saudi advice columns.&lt;ref&gt;(Elhadj 2006, p. 125)&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Sunni]] cleric Sheik [[Ezzat Atiya]] (عزت عطية), President of the Hadith Department of Egypt's [[al-Azhar University]] issued a [[fatwa]] in 2007 encouraging women to breastfeed their male business colleagues so that the man could become symbolically related to the woman, thereby precluding any sexual relations and the need for both sexes to [[Sex segregation in Islam|observe modesty]]. "Breast feeding an adult puts an end to the problem of the private meeting" It was later denounced and declared defamatory to [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6681511.stm|title=Breastfeeding fatwa causes stir|work=BBC News|date=22 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In 2013 a domestic staff agency in China named Xinxinyu was reported to be providing wet nurses for the sick and other adults as well as for newborns. The agency's clients could choose to drink the breast milk directly from the breast or to drink it via a breast pump. The reports caused controversy in China, with one writer describing it as "adding to China's problem of treating women as consumer goods and the moral degradation of China's rich." The agency was forced to suspend its operations by Chinese authorities for a number of reasons, one of which was for missing three years of annual checks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2013/07/04/adult-breast-feeding-report-incenses-china-web-users/#ixzz2YGcidHEK | work=Fox News | title=Adult breast feeding report incenses China web users | date=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
In 1903, German philosopher Carl Buttenstedt published his marriage guidebook "''Die Glücksehe – Die Offenbarung im Weibe, eine Naturstudie''" (''The Marriage of Happiness – The Revelation in the Woman, a study from nature''), in which he described and recommended the [[lactational amenorrhea]] method (LAM) as a form of [[contraception]] and natural family planning that also deepens the relationship between wife and husband. He explicitly described erotic lactation as a source of great sexual pleasure for both partners, claiming that this is intended by nature especially on the part of the woman. This particular aspect of his broader general marriage philosophy gained a lot of attention and sparked wide debate. While some welcomed Buttenstedt's advice as inspirational for new ways to improve sexual satisfaction between marriage partners, others warned that this technique could "pathologically increase sexual sensation of both partners."&lt;ref&gt;E. Peters: Die Beschränkung der Kinderzahl aus hygienischer und sozialer Notwendigkeit, Cologne 1909, p. 69ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the book was [[List of authors banned during the Third Reich|banned by the Nazis]] in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berlin.de/rubrik/hauptstadt/verbannte_buecher/detail.php?referer=/rubrik/hauptstadt/verbannte_buecher/suche.php&amp;id=70788&amp;page=0&amp;suche=buttenstedt&amp;|title=Politik-Verwaltung-Bürger|date=27 April 2018|website=www.berlin.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
The ''Bonyu Bar'' (Mother’s Milk Bar), located in [[Tokyo]]’s entertainment and red-light district of [[Kabukichō, Tokyo|Kabukicho]], employs nursing women who provide customers with breast milk in a glass for 2,000 yen (about 15 euros) or directly from the nipple for 5000 yen (about 37.50 euros). In the latter case the women can run their fingers through the customers' hair, coo and say their name as they suckle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |language=fr|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Japon : vous prendrez bien un verre de lait… maternel|trans-title=Japan: Enjoy a glass of… Mother's Milk |url=http://www.atlantico.fr/atlantico-light/japon-prendrez-bien-verre-lait-maternel-1974264.html |newspaper=Atlantico |location=France |date=26 January 2015 |access-date=3 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |title=Cheers To This Beverage Shot Made With Human Breast Milk |url=http://www.dailyoffbeat.com/articles/5960/20150120/breast-milk-shot-lactation-bar-breast-milk-adults.htm |newspaper=Daily Offbeat |location= |date=20 January 2015 |access-date=3 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208080118/http://www.dailyoffbeat.com/articles/5960/20150120/breast-milk-shot-lactation-bar-breast-milk-adults.htm |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sewer overflow RI EPA.jpg|thumb|right|Excessive infiltration/inflow may cause sanitary sewer overflows during wet weather.]]'''Infiltration/Inflow''' ('''I/I''') causes dilution in [[sanitary sewer]]s.  Dilution of sewage decreases the efficiency of treatment, and may cause sewage volumes to exceed design capacity.  Although inflow is technically different from infiltration, it may be difficult to determine which is causing dilution problems in inaccessible sewers.  The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] defines the term infiltration/inflow as combined contributions from both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=e59aece1945f2c220e3474257ee2a251&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=40:1.0.1.2.32&amp;idno=40#40:1.0.1.2.32.4.142.4 40CFR35.905] Accessed 2010-12-29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Early [[combined sewer]]s used [[surface runoff]] to dilute waste from [[toilet]]s and carry it away from urban areas into natural waterways.  [[Sewage treatment]] can remove some [[pollutant]]s from toilet waste, but treatment of diluted flow from combined sewers produces larger volumes of treated sewage with similar pollutant concentrations.  Modern sanitary sewers are designed to transport domestic and industrial [[wastewater]] directly to treatment facilities without dilution.&lt;ref name="steel"&gt;Steel, E.W. and McGhee, Terence J. ''Water Supply and Sewerage'' (1979) McGraw-Hill {{ISBN|0-07-060929-2}} p.318&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infiltration==
[[Groundwater]] entering sanitary sewers through defective pipe joints and broken pipes is called ''infiltration''.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;King, James J. ''The Environmental Dictionary'' (1995) John Wiley &amp; Sons {{ISBN|0-471-11995-4}} p.335&lt;/ref&gt;  Pipes may leak because of careless installation; they may also be damaged after installation by differential ground movement, heavy vehicle traffic on roadways above the sewer, careless construction practices in nearby trenches, or degradation of the sewer pipe materials.  In general, volume of leakage will increase over time. Damaged and broken sewer cleanouts are a major cause of infiltration into municipal sewer systems.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www3.epa.gov/region1/sso/pdfs/PrivateSewerLaterals.pdf EPA Report June 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Infiltration will occur where local groundwater elevation is higher than the sewer pipe.  Gravel bedding materials in sewer pipe trenches act as a [[French drain]].  Groundwater flows parallel to the sewer until it reaches the area of damaged pipe.  In areas of low groundwater, sewage may exfiltrate into groundwater from a leaking sewer.&lt;ref name="eddy"&gt;Metcalf &amp; Eddy ''Wastewater Engineering'' (1972) McGraw-Hill pp.39-44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inflow==
Water entering sanitary sewers from inappropriate connections is called ''inflow''.&lt;ref name="king"/&gt;  Typical sources include sump pumps, roof drains, cellar drains, and yard drains where urban features prevent surface runoff, and storm drains are not conveniently accessible or identifiable.  Inflow tends to peak during precipitation events, and causes greater flow variation than infiltration. Peak flows caused by inflow may generate a [[foul flush]] of accumulated [[biofilm]] and sanitary solids scoured from the dry weather [[wetted perimeter]] of oversized sewers during peak flow [[turbulence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://netlab.cs.ucla.edu/rrr/wiki-internal/files/sediment%20control.pdf |title=Sewer-Sediment Control: Overview of an EPA Wet-Weather Flow Research Program |last1=Fan |first1=Chi-Yuan |last2=Field |first2=Richard |last3=Lai |first3=Fu-hsiung |website=[[University of California Los Angeles]] |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |accessdate=12 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sources of inflow can sometimes be identified by [[smoke testing (mechanical)|smoke testing]].  Smoke is blown into the sewer during dry weather while observers watch for smoke emerging from yards, cellars, or roof gutters.&lt;ref name="hammer"&gt;Hammer, Mark J. ''Water and Waste-Water Technology'' (1975) John Wiley &amp; Sons {{ISBN|0-471-34726-4}} pp.303-304&amp;441-442&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Dilution of sewage directly increases costs of pumping and [[Water chlorination|chlorination]], ozonation, or [[ultraviolet disinfection]].  Physical treatment structures including screens and pumps must be enlarged to handle the peak flow.  Primary clarifiers must also be enlarged to treat average flows, although [[primary treatment]] of peak flows may be accomplished in [[detention basin]]s.  Biological [[secondary treatment]] is effective only while the concentration of soluble and colloidal pollutants (typically measured as [[biochemical oxygen demand]] or BOD) remains high enough to sustain a population of microorganisms digesting those pollutants.  Secondary treatment is expected to remove 85 percent of soluble and colloidal organic pollutants from sewage containing 200&amp;nbsp;mg/L BOD;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Washington, DC. [http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_07/40cfr133_07.html "Secondary Treatment Regulation."] ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' 40 CFR Part 133.&lt;/ref&gt; but BOD removal by conventional biological secondary treatment becomes less effective with dilution and practically ceases as BOD concentrations entering the treatment facility are diluted below about 20&amp;nbsp;mg/L.  Unremoved organics are potentially converted to [[disinfection by-products]] by chemical disinfection prior to discharge.

High rates of infiltration/inflow may make the sanitary sewer incapable of carrying sewage from the design service area.  Sewage may back up into the lowest homes during wet weather, or street manholes may overflow.&lt;ref name="hammer"/&gt;

==Correction==
Smoke test results may not correlate well with flow volumes; although they can identify potential problem locations.  Where sewage flow is expected to be relatively uniform, significance of infiltration and inflow may be estimated by comparison of sewage flow at the same point during wet and dry weather or at two sequential points within the sewer system.  Small areas with large flow differences can be identified if the sewer system provides adequate measuring locations.  It may be necessary to replace a section of sewer line if flow differences cannot be corrected by removing identified connections.&lt;ref name="hammer"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3675">The '''Institute on Religion in an Age of Science''' (IRAS) is a [[non-denominational]] society that promotes and facilitates the ongoing dialectic between religion and science. The Institute has held annual week-long conferences at [[Star Island (New Hampshire)|Star Island]] in [[New Hampshire]] since 1954. The conference attracts about 250 members and non-members each year.

==Mission==
In its Constitution, the IRAS purpose is stated as follows: "The Institute on Religion in an Age of Science is established
* to promote creative efforts leading to the formulation, in the light of contemporary knowledge, of effective doctrines and practice for human welfare;
* to formulate dynamic and positive relationships between the concepts developed by science and the goals and hopes of humanity expressed through religion; and
* to state human values in such universal and valid terms that they be understood by all peoples, whatever their cultural background or experience, in such a way as to provide a basis for world-wide cooperation.

The IRAS Council adopted the following statement in 2003:
“We at IRAS take the natural world seriously as a primary source of meaning. Our quest is informed and guided by the deepening and evolving understandings fostered by scientific inquiry.

“From here, our quests for meaning take us in divergent directions. For some, the natural world and its emergent manifestations in human experience and creativity are the focus of exploration. Some go on to encounter and celebrate the sacred in such explorations. For some, understandings of the natural world are interwoven with understandings inherent in various religious traditions, generating additional paths of exploration and encounter. As a result, we articulate our emerging orientations with many voices that are harmonious in that we share a common sense of place and gratitude.

“We acknowledge as well a shared set of values and concerns pertaining to peace, justice, dignity, cultural and ecological diversity and planetary sustainability. Although we may differ and hence debate as to how these concerns are here addressed, we are committed to participating in their resolution.”

==History==
IRAS evolved from the ideas of two pioneer groups. The first was a group of scientists from the Committee on Science and Values of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. The second group was an interfaith, religious coalition which hoped to revitalize religion for today's needs. Members of both groups saw what some perceived as a battlefield of conflicting ideologies to be a place of opportunity for a constructive relationship to emerge.

In 1954 the scientists accepted an invitation to present their views to the religious group at a seven-day conference on Religion in an Age of Science on Star Island. On November 9, 1954, members of the two groups established the Institute on Religion in an Age of Science to work toward these goals.

Presidents of the Institute have included [[Harlow Shapley]], [[Philip Hefner]], [[Ursula Goodenough]], and [[Varadaraja V. Raman]].

'''Introspection''' is the examination of one's own [[conscious]] [[thought]]s and [[feeling]]s.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite book | first=D. P. | last=Schultz |author2=Schultz, S. E. | title= A history of modern psychology (10th ed.) | year=2012| publisher= Wadsworth, Cengage Learning | isbn=978-1-133-31624-4 | url= | location= Belmont, CA | pages= 67–77, 88–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychology]], the process of introspection relies exclusively on observation of one's [[Mental representation|mental state]], while in a [[Spirituality|spiritual]] context it may refer to the examination of one's [[soul]]. Introspection is closely related to [[human self-reflection]] and is contrasted with [[observation|external observation]].

Introspection generally provides a privileged access to one's own mental states,&lt;ref&gt;W. Seager,[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123738738000712, Encyclopedia of ''Consciousness' ']&lt;/ref&gt; not mediated by other sources of knowledge, so that individual experience of the mind is unique. Introspection can determine any number of mental states including: sensory, bodily, cognitive, emotional and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;W. Seager,[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123738738000712, Encyclopedia of ''Consciousness'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Introspection has been a subject of philosophical discussion for thousands of years. The philosopher [[Plato]] asked, "…why should we not calmly and patiently review our own thoughts, and thoroughly examine and see what these appearances in us really are?"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', 155&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Perner et al (2007). "''Introspection &amp; remembering''". Synthese. Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; While introspection is applicable to many facets of philosophical thought it is perhaps best known for its role in [[epistemology]], in this context introspection is often compared with [[perception]], [[reason]], [[memory]], and [[testimony]] as a source of [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;Epistemology.

===Wundt===
It has often been claimed that [[Wilhelm Wundt]], the father of modern psychology, was the first to adopt introspection to [[experimental psychology]]&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; though the methodological idea had been presented long before, as by 18th century German philosopher-psychologists such as [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten]] or [[Johann Nicolaus Tetens]].&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis, 2009), ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Wundt's views on introspection must be approached with great care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Danziger | first1 = Kurt | year = 1980 | title = The History of Introspection Reconsidered | url = | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 16 | issue = 3| pages = 241–262 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(198007)16:3&lt;241::aid-jhbs2300160306&gt;3.0.co;2-o}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wundt was influenced by notable [[physiology|physiologists]], such as [[Gustav Fechner]], who used a kind of controlled introspection as a means to study human [[sense|sensory]] organs. Building upon the pre-existing use of introspection in physiology, Wundt believed the method of introspection was the ability to observe an experience, not just the logical reflection or speculations which some others interpreted his meaning to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asthana|first=Hari Shanker|date=June 2015|title=Wilhelm Wundt|url=|journal=Psychological Studies|volume=60|pages=244–248|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wundt imposed exacting control over the use of introspection in his experimental laboratory at the [[University of Leipzig]],&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; making it possible for other scientists to [[reproducibility|replicate]] his experiments elsewhere, a development that proved essential to the development of psychology as a modern, [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] scientific discipline. Such exact purism was typical of Wundt and he instructed all introspection observations be performed under these same instructions "1) the Observer must, if possible, be in a position to determine beforehand the entrance of the process to be observed. 2) the introspectionist must, as far as possible, grasp the phenomenon in a state of strained attention and follow its course. 3) Every observation must, in order to make certain, be capable of being repeated several times under the same conditions and 4) the conditions under which the phenomenon appears must be found out by the variation of the attendant circumstances and when this was done the various coherent experiments must be varied according to a plan partly by eliminating certain stimuli and partly by grading their strength and quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asthana|first=Hari Shanker|date=June 2015|title=Wilhelm Wundt|url=|journal=Psychological Studies|volume=60|pages=244–248|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titchener===
[[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]] was an early pioneer in experimental psychology and student of Wilhelm Wundt.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; After earning his doctorate under the tutelage of Wundt at the University of Leipzig, he made his way to [[Cornell University]] where he established his own laboratory and research.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; When Titchener arrived at Cornell in 1894, psychology was still a fledgling discipline, especially in the United States, and Titchener was a key figure in bringing Wundt's ideas to America. However, Titchener misrepresented some of Wundt's ideas to the American psychological establishment, especially in his account of introspection which, Titchener taught, only served a purpose in the [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] analysis of [[consciousness]] into its various parts,&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; while Wundt saw it as a means to [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] measure the whole of conscious experience.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Titchener was exclusively interested in the individual components that comprise conscious experience, while Wundt, seeing little purpose in the analysis of individual components, focused on synthesis of these components. Ultimately Titchener's ideas would form the basis of the short-lived psychological theory of [[Structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]].&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;

===Historical misconceptions===
American [[historiography]] of introspection, according to some authors,&lt;ref name="Costal 2006 634–654"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Costal|first=A|title='Introspectionism' and the mythical origins of scientific psychology|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|year=2006|volume=15|issue=4|pages=634–654|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.09.008|pmid=17174788}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clegg 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clegg|first=Joshua|title=Self-observation in the social science|year=2013|publisher=Transaction|location=New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; is dominated by three misconceptions. In particular, historians of psychology tend to argue 1) that introspection once was the dominant method of psychological inquiry, 2) that behaviorism, and in particular [[John B. Watson]], is responsible for discrediting introspection as a valid method, and 3) that scientific [[psychology]] completely abandoned introspection as a result of those critiques.&lt;ref name="Costal 2006 634–654"/&gt; Yet, introspection has not been the dominant method. It is believed to be so because [[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]]'s student [[Edwin G. Boring]], in his influential historical accounts of experimental psychology privileged Titchener's views while giving little credit to original sources.&lt;ref name="Costal 2006 634–654"/&gt; Introspection has been critiqued by many other psychologists, including [[Wilhelm Wundt]], and [[Knight Dunlap]] who in his article "[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Dunlap/introspection.htm ''The Case Against Introspection'']", presents an argument against self-observation that is not primarily rooted in behaviorist epistemology. Introspection is still widely used in psychology, but under different names, such as self-report surveys, interviews and fMRIs.&lt;ref name="Clegg 2013"/&gt; It is not the method but rather its name that has been dropped from the dominant psychological vocabulary.

===Recent developments===
{{See also|Introspection illusion}}
Partly as a result of Titchener's misrepresentation, the use of introspection diminished after his death and the subsequent decline of structuralism.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Later psychological movements, such as [[functional psychology|functionalism]] and [[behaviorism]], rejected introspection for its lack of scientific [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] among other factors.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; Functionalism originally arose in direct opposition to structuralism, opposing its narrow focus on the elements of consciousness&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt; and emphasising the purpose of consciousness and other psychological behavior. Behaviorism's objection to introspection focused much more on its unreliability and [[objectivity (science)|subjectivity]] which conflicted with behaviorism's focus on measurable behavior.&lt;ref name="Schultz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences |editor-first=Robert Andrew |editor-last=Wilson |editor2=Keil, Frank C. | url = https://books.google.com/?id=-wt1aZrGXLYC&amp;printsec=frontcover | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780262731447 |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recently established [[cognitive psychology]] movement has to some extent accepted introspection's usefulness in the study of psychological phenomena, though generally only in experiments pertaining to internal thought conducted under experimental conditions. For example, in the "[[think aloud protocol]]", investigators cue participants to speak their thoughts aloud in order to study an active thought process without forcing an individual to comment on the process itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hayes | first1 = S. C. | year = 1986 | title = The case of the silent dog—Verbal reports and the analysis of rules: A review of Ericsson and Simon's Protocol Analysis: Verbal Reports as Data1 | url = | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 45 | issue = 3| pages = 351–363 | doi = 10.1901/jeab.1986.45-351 | pmc = 1348244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the 18th century authors had criticized the use of introspection, both for knowing one's own mind and as a method for psychology. [[David Hume]] pointed out that introspecting a mental state tends to alter the very state itself; a German author, [[Christian Gottfried Schütz]], noted that introspection is often described as mere "inner sensation", but actually requires also attention, that introspection does not get at unconscious mental states, and that it cannot be used naively - one needs to know what to look for. [[Immanuel Kant]] added that, if they are understood too narrowly, introspective experiments are impossible. Introspection delivers, at best, hints about what goes on in the mind; it does not suffice to justify knowledge claims about the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Thomas Sturm, ''Kant und die Wissenschaften vom Menschen'' (Paderborn: Mentis, 2009), ch.s 2 and 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the idea continued to be discussed between [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Auguste Comte]]. 
Recent psychological research on [[cognition]] and [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution]] has asked people to report on their mental processes, for instance to say why they made a particular choice or how they arrived at a judgment. In some situations, these reports are clearly [[confabulation|confabulated]].&lt;ref name="telling"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nisbett|first=Richard E.|author2=Timothy D. Wilson|year=1977|title=Telling more than we can know: Verbal reports on mental processes|journal=Psychological Review|volume=84|issue=3|pages=231–259|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.84.3.231 }}, reprinted in {{cite book|title=Social cognition: key readings|editor=David Lewis Hamilton|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-86377-591-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, people justify choices they have not in fact made.&lt;ref name="something"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Petter|last=Johansson|author2=Lars Hall |author3=Sverker Sikström |author4=Betty Tärning |author5=Andreas Lind |title=How something can be said about telling more than we can know: On choice blindness and introspection |year=2006 |journal= Consciousness and Cognition |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=673–692 |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2006.09.004|pmid=17049881 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such results undermine the idea that those verbal reports are based on direct introspective access to mental content. Instead, judgements about one's own mind seem to be [[inference]]s from overt behavior, similar to judgements made about another person.&lt;ref name="telling" /&gt; However, it is hard to assess whether these results only apply to unusual experimental situations, or if they reveal something about everyday introspection.&lt;ref name="knowing_more"&gt;{{cite journal|last=White |first=Peter A.|year=1988 |journal=British Journal of Psychology |volume=79| title=Knowing more about what we can tell: 'Introspective access' and causal report accuracy 10 years later|issue=1|pages=13–45|doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1988.tb02271.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of the [[adaptive unconscious]] suggests that a very large proportion of mental processes, even "high-level" processes like goal-setting and decision-making, are inaccessible to introspection.&lt;ref name="annreview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy D.|author2=Elizabeth W. Dunn|year=2004|title=Self-Knowledge: Its Limits, Value, and Potential for Improvement|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=55|pages=493–518|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141954|pmid=14744224}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Indeed, it is questionable how confident researchers can be in their own introspections.

One of the central implications of dissociations between consciousness and meta-consciousness is that individuals, presumably including researchers, can misrepresent their experiences to themselves. Jack and Roepstorff assert, '...there is also a sense in which subjects simply cannot be wrong about their own experiential states.' Presumably they arrived at this conclusion by drawing on the seemingly self-evident quality of their own introspections, and assumed that it must equally apply to others. However, when we consider research on the topic, this conclusion seems less self-evident. If, for example, extensive introspection can cause people to make decisions that they later regret, then one very reasonable possibility is that the introspection caused them to 'lose touch with their feelings'. In short, empirical studies suggest that people can fail to appraise adequately (i.e. are wrong about) their own experiential states.

Another question in regards to the veracious accountability of introspection is  if researchers lack the confidence in their own introspections and those of their participants, then how can it gain legitimacy? Three strategies  are accountable: identifying behaviors that establish credibility, finding common ground that enables mutual understanding, and developing a trust that allows one to know when to give the benefit of the doubt.
That is to say, that words are only meaningful if validated by one's actions; When people report strategies, feelings or beliefs, their  behaviors must correspond with these statements if they are to be believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(02)01970-8 | volume=6 | issue=9 | title=Establishing a legitimate relationship with introspection | journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences | pages=371–372| year=2002 | last1=Schooler | first1=Jonathan W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when their introspections are uninformative, people still give confident descriptions of their mental processes, being "unaware of their unawareness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Timothy D.|author2=Yoav Bar-Anan|date=August 22, 2008|title=The Unseen Mind|journal=Science|volume=321|pages=1046–1047|doi=10.1126/science.1163029|pmid=18719269|issue=5892 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon has been termed the ''introspection illusion'' and has been used to explain some [[cognitive bias]]es&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|date=January 2007|title=Perception and misperception of bias in human judgment|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=11|issue=1|pages=37–43|issn=1364-6613|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2006.11.001|pmid=17129749}}&lt;/ref&gt; and belief in some [[paranormal]] phenomena.&lt;ref name="selfismagic"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wegner|first=Daniel M.|title=Are we free?: psychology and free will|editor=John Baer |editor2=[[James C. Kaufman]] |editor3=[[Roy F. Baumeister]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=2008|chapter=Self is Magic|isbn=978-0-19-518963-6 |chapter-url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic67047.files/2_13_07_Wegner.pdf |accessdate=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; When making judgements about themselves, subjects treat their own introspections as reliable, whereas they judge other people based on their behavior.&lt;ref name="blindspot" /&gt; This can lead to [[Illusory superiority|illusions of superiority]]. For example, people generally see themselves as less [[conformity|conformist]] than others, and this seems to be because they do not introspect any urge to conform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|author2=Jonah Berger |author3=Sarah Molouki |year=2007|title=Alone in a Crowd of Sheep: Asymmetric Perceptions of Conformity and Their Roots in an Introspection Illusion|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=92|issue=4|pages=585–595|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.4.585|pmid=17469946 |url=https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1400&amp;context=marketing_papers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reliable finding is that people generally see themselves as [[bias blind spot|less biased than everyone else]], because they are not likely to introspect any biased thought processes.&lt;ref name="blindspot"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pronin|first=Emily|author2=Matthew B. Kugler|date=July 2007|title=Valuing thoughts, ignoring behavior: The introspection illusion as a source of the bias blind spot|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=43|issue=4|pages=565–578|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2006.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These introspections are misleading, however, because biases work [[unconscious mind|sub-consciously]].

One experiment tried to give their subjects access to others' introspections. They made audio recordings of subjects who had been told to say whatever came into their heads as they answered a question about their own bias.&lt;ref name="blindspot" /&gt; Although subjects persuaded themselves they were unlikely to be biased, their introspective reports did not sway the assessments of observers. When subjects were explicitly told to avoid relying on introspection, their assessments of their own bias became more realistic.&lt;ref name="blindspot" /&gt;

==In religion==

===Christianity===
In [[Eastern Christianity]] some concepts addressing human needs, such as sober introspection ''([[nepsis]]''), require watchfulness of the human heart and the conflicts of the human ''[[nous]]'', heart or mind. [[Noesis|Noetic]] understanding can not be achieved by rational or discursive thought (i.e. systemization).{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Jainism===
[[Jainism|Jains]] practise ''[[pratikraman]]'' ([[Sanskrit]] "introspection"), a process of repentance of wrongdoings during their daily life, and remind themselves to refrain from doing so again. Devout Jains often do Pratikraman at least twice a day.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== Hinduism ===
Introspection is encouraged in schools such as [[Advaita Vedanta]]; in order for one to know their own true nature, they need to reflect and introspect on their true nature -- which is what [[meditation]] is. Especially, [[Swami Chinmayananda]] emphasised the role of introspection in five stages, outlined in his book "Self Unfoldment."

==In fiction==
Introspection (also referred to as Rufus dialogue, interior monologue, self-talk) is the fiction-writing [[mode (literature)|mode]] used to convey a character's thoughts. As explained by Renni Browne and Dave King, "One of the great gifts of literature is that it allows for the expression of unexpressed thoughts…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Renni | last=Browne |author2=King, David | title= Self-Editing for Fiction Writers: How to Edit Yourself into Print | year=2004| publisher= HarperCollins Publishers Inc. | isbn=978-0-06-054569-7 | url= | location= New York, NY }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nancy Kress, a character's thoughts can greatly enhance a story: deepening characterization, increasing tension, and widening the scope of a story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kress|first=Nancy|year=2003|title=Make "Em Think|journal=Writer's Digest|volume=|issue=August|page=38|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As outlined by Jack M. Bickham, thought plays a critical role in both [[Scene (drama)|scene]] and [[sequel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jack M. | last=Bickham | title=Scene &amp; Structure | year=1993 | publisher=Writer's Digest Books | isbn=978-0-89879-551-6 | url= | location= Cincinnati, OH |pages= 12–22, 50–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lesbian Art Project was part of an ongoing effort by [[Arlene Raven]], co-founder of the [[Woman's Building|LA Woman's Building]], to incorporate lesbian-oriented programming into the [[Woman's Building#Feminist Studio Workshop|Feminist Studio Workshop]], which had already launched the Los Angeles League for the Advancement of Lesbianism in the Arts (LALALA) in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Lesbian Histories and Cultures|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136787515|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YTyBAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq|editor=Bonnie Zimmerman|accessdate=1 February 2014|date=2013-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics and artists influenced by the tenets of [[postmodernism]] dismissed much of the art work made in the 1970s from a lesbian feminist perspective. This has resulted in very little being known or written about this pioneering work. The activities and events associated with the Lesbian Art Project at the Woman’s Building in Los Angeles have played a larger role in lesbian [[art history]] than is often acknowledged. The project began with six women (started by Terry Wolverton) working collectively with a common goal of increasing opportunity for lesbian artists and writing a chapter of lesbian art.  This small group disbanded in less than a year but Wolverton and Raven continued in their pursuit of a Lesbian Art Movement.  As they continued their project they became astonishingly productive, and they were able to integrate the Lesbian Art Project with the curriculum of the Feminist Studio Workshop at the Woman’s Building.

At the Woman's Building they were able to organize a major performance event based on lesbian identities: ''The Oral Herstory of Lesbianism (Oral)''. Advertised as "Storytelling, Theater and Magic for Women Only",&lt;ref&gt;Broude, Norma, and [[Mary D. Garrard]]. "The power of feminist art: The American movement of the 1970s, history and impact." (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; the project was directed by Wolverton and its stories generated through a workshop for the thirteen performers.

Along with the major performance event, a database for lesbian artists was now in existence. Wolverton and Raven went their separate ways before completing the book they had planned but both continued to individually promote feminist and lesbian art.     
  
A partial successor to the LAP was the 1980 [[Great American Lesbian Art Show]] (GALAS), also at the Woman's Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = DIY Identity Kit: The Great American Lesbian Art Show|last = Thompson|first = Margo Hobbs|date = 20 April 2010|journal = Journal of Lesbian Studies|volume = 14|issue = 2–3|doi = 10.1080/10894160903196558|pmid = 20408014|pages=260–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For these animals, there is documented evidence of [[homosexual behavior in animals|homosexual]] behavior of one or more of the following kinds: [[Sexual intercourse|sex]], [[courtship]], [[affection]], [[pair bond]]ing, or [[parenting]], as noted in researcher and author [[Bruce Bagemihl]]'s 1999 book ''Biological Exuberance: Animal Homosexuality and Natural Diversity''.

Bagemihl writes that the presence of [[same-sex sexual behavior]] was not "officially" observed on a large scale until the 1990s due to possible [[Observer-expectancy effect|observer bias]] caused by social attitudes towards [[LGBT]] people, making the homosexual theme [[taboo]].&lt;ref name="Two Hundred Years "&gt;Bagemihl (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1,500 Animal Species Practice"&gt;News-medical.net (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Bagemihl devotes three chapters; ''Two Hundred Years at Looking at Homosexual Wildlife'', ''Explaining (Away) Animal Homosexuality'' and ''Not For Breeding Only'' in his 1999 book ''Biological Exuberance'' to the "documentation of systematic [[prejudice]]s" where he notes "the ''present ignorance'' of [[biology]] lies precisely in its single-minded attempt to find reproductive (or other) 'explanations' for homosexuality, transgender, and [[procreate|non-procreative]] and alternative [[heterosexual]]ities."&lt;ref name="Not For Breeding Only "&gt;Bagemihl (1999) page 213&lt;/ref&gt; Petter Bøckman, academic adviser for the ''[[Against Nature?]]'' exhibit stated "[M]any researchers have described homosexuality as something altogether different from sex. They must realize that animals can have sex with who they will, when they will and without consideration to a researcher's [[Ethics (philosophy)|ethical]] [[principle]]s." Homosexual behavior is found amongst social [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s, particularly the sea mammals and the [[primates]].&lt;ref name="1,500 Animal Species Practice"/&gt;

[[Animal sexual behavior]] takes many different forms, even within the same [[species]] and the motivations for and implications of their behaviors have yet to be fully understood. Bagemihl's research shows that homosexual behavior, not necessarily [[sex]], has been documented in about 500 species as of 1999, ranging from [[primates]] to [[Acanthocephala|gut worms]].&lt;ref name="Two Hundred Years "/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biological Exuberance: Animal"&gt;Harrold (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homosexuality in animals]] is seen as controversial by [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] because it asserts the naturalness of [[Human sexuality|homosexuality in humans]], while others counter that it has no implications and is nonsensical to equate natural animal behaviors to [[morality]].&lt;ref name="The Animal Homosexuality Myth"&gt;Solimeo (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Defending A Higher Law"&gt;Solimeo (2004b)&lt;/ref&gt; Animal preference and motivation is always inferred from behavior. Thus homosexual behavior has been given a number of terms over the years. The correct usage of the term ''homosexual'' is that an animal ''exhibits homosexual behavior'', however this article conforms to the usage by modern research,&lt;ref&gt;Bagemihl (1999) pages 122-166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughgarden (2004) pp.13-183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vasey (1995) pages 173-204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sommer &amp; Vasey (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; applying the term ''homosexuality'' to all sexual behavior ([[copulation]], [[genital stimulation]], [[mating|mating games]] and sexual [[Display (zoology)|display behavior]]) between animals of the same sex.

The all-female [[Whiptail lizard]] species ''[[Aspidoscelis neomexicanus]]'' (center), which reproduces via [[parthenogenesis]], is shown flanked by two sexual species having males, ''[[Aspidoscelis inornatus|A. inornatus]]'' (left) and ''[[Aspidoscelis tigris|A. tigris]]'' (right). Research has shown that simulated mating behavior increases fertility for ''Aspidoscelis neomexicanus''. One female lies on top of another, playing the role of the male, the lizard that was on bottom has larger eggs, in most cases. The lizards switch off this role each mating season.&lt;ref&gt;LeVay, (19 September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radiography==
[[File:Photon Mean Free Path.png|thumb|right|400px|Mean free path for photons in energy range from 1 keV to 20 MeV for elements with [[Atomic number|''Z'']] = 1 to 100.&lt;ref&gt;Based on data from {{cite web|url=http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/XrayNoteB.html |title=NIST: Note - X-Ray Form Factor and Attenuation Databases |publisher=Physics.nist.gov |date=1998-03-10 |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The discontinuities are due to low density of gas elements. Six bands correspond to neighborhoods of six [[w:noble gas|noble gases]]. Also shown are locations of [[w:en:absorption edge|absorption edges]].]]

In [[gamma-ray]] [[radiography]] the ''mean free path'' of a [[pencil beam]] of mono-energetic [[photon]]s is the average distance a photon travels between collisions with atoms of the target material. It depends on the material and the energy of the photons:

:&lt;math&gt;\ell = \mu^{-1} = ( (\mu/\rho) \rho)^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''μ'' is the [[linear attenuation coefficient]], ''μ/ρ'' is the [[mass attenuation coefficient]] and ''ρ'' is the [[density]] of the material. The [[mass attenuation coefficient]] can be looked up or calculated for any material and energy combination using the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) databases&lt;ref name=NIST1&gt;{{cite web

In [[X-ray]] [[radiography]] the calculation of the ''mean free path'' is more complicated, because photons are not mono-energetic, but have some [[Frequency distribution|distribution]] of energies called a [[spectrum]]. As photons move through the target material, they are [[attenuation|attenuated]] with probabilities depending on their energy, as a result their distribution changes in process called spectrum hardening. Because of spectrum hardening, the ''mean free path'' of the [[X-ray]] spectrum changes with distance.

Sometimes one measures the thickness of a material in the ''number of mean free paths''. Material with the thickness of one ''mean free path'' will attenuate 37% (1/[[e (mathematical constant)|''e'']]) of photons. This concept is closely related to [[half-value layer]] (HVL): a material with a thickness of one HVL will attenuate 50% of photons. A standard x-ray image is a transmission image, an image with negative logarithm of its intensities is sometimes called a ''number of mean free paths'' image.

==Electronics==
[[Electrical mobility]], a value directly related to [[electrical conductivity]], is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu = \frac{e \tau}{m} = \frac{e d}{m^* v_{\rm F}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''e'' is the [[elementary charge|charge]], &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mean free time]], ''m&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'' is the [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]], ''d'' is the mean free path, and ''v''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Fermi velocity]] of the charge carrier. The Fermi velocity can easily be derived from the [[Fermi energy]] via the non-relativistic kinetic energy equation. In [[thin film]]s, however, the film thickness can be smaller than the predicted mean free path, making surface scattering much more noticeable, effectively increasing the [[resistivity]].

==Optics==
If one takes a suspension of non-light-absorbing particles of diameter ''d'' with a [[volume fraction]] ''Φ'', the mean free path of the photons is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

:&lt;math&gt;l = \frac{2d}{3\Phi Q_\text{s}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the scattering efficiency factor. ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; can be evaluated numerically for spherical particles using [[Mie theory]].

==Acoustics==
In an otherwise empty cavity, the mean free path of a single particle bouncing off the walls is:

:&lt;math&gt;l = \frac{F V}{S},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' is volume of the cavity, ''S'' is total inside surface area of cavity and ''F'' a constant related to the shape of the cavity. For most simple cavity shapes ''F'' is approximately 4.&lt;ref name="YoungRW"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=Robert W.|title=Sabine Reverberation Equation and Sound Power Calculations|journal=The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date=July 1959|volume=31|issue=7|page=918|doi=10.1121/1.1907816|bibcode=1959ASAJ...31..912Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mean free path.png|frame|Slab of target]]

Imagine a beam of particles being shot through a target, and consider an infinitesimally thin slab of the target (see the figure).  The atoms (or particles) that might stop a beam particle are shown in red. The magnitude of the mean free path depends on the characteristics of the system. An expression for the MFP is

:&lt;math&gt;\ell = (\sigma n)^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|ℓ}} is the mean free path, {{mvar|n}} is the number of target particles per unit volume, and {{mvar|&amp;sigma;}} is the effective [[cross section (physics)|cross-sectional]] area for collision.

The area of the slab is {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, and its volume is {{math|''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''dx''}}.  The typical number of stopping atoms in the slab is the concentration {{mvar|n}} times the volume, i.e., {{math|''n L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''dx''}}.  The probability that a beam particle will be stopped in that slab is the net area of the stopping atoms divided by the total area of the slab:

:&lt;math&gt;P(\text{stopping within }dx) = \frac{\text{Area}_\text{atoms}}{\text{Area}_\text{slab}} = \frac{\sigma n L^{2}\, dx}{L^{2}} = n \sigma\, dx,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|&amp;sigma;}} is the area (or, more formally, the "[[scattering cross-section]]") of one atom.

The drop in beam intensity equals the incoming beam intensity multiplied by the probability of the particle being stopped within the slab:

:&lt;math&gt;dI = -I n \sigma \,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

This is an [[ordinary differential equation]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dI}{dx} = -I n \sigma \overset{\text{def}}{=} -\frac{I}{\ell},&lt;/math&gt;

whose solution is known as [[Beer-Lambert law]] and has the form &lt;math&gt;I = I_{0} e^{-x/\ell}&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|x}} is the distance traveled by the beam through the target, and {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the beam intensity before it entered the target; {{mvar|ℓ}} is called the mean free path because it equals the [[mean]] distance traveled by a beam particle before being stopped. To see this, note that the probability that a particle is absorbed between {{mvar|x}} and {{math|''x'' + ''dx''}} is given by

:&lt;math&gt;dP(x) = \frac{I(x)-I(x+dx)}{I_0} = \frac{1}{\ell} e^{-x/\ell} dx.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the [[expectation value]] (or average, or simply mean) of {{mvar|x}} is

:&lt;math&gt;\langle x \rangle \overset{\text{def}}{=} \int_0^\infty x dP(x) = \int_0^\infty \frac{x}{\ell} e^{-x/\ell} \, dx = \ell.&lt;/math&gt;

The fraction of particles that are not stopped ([[attenuation|attenuated]]) by the slab is called [[Transmittance|transmission]] &lt;math&gt;T = I/I_{0} = e^{-x/\ell}&lt;/math&gt;, where {{mvar|x}} is equal to the thickness of the slab {{math|''x {{=}} dx''}}.

==Kinetic theory==
In [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]] the ''mean free path'' of a particle, such as a [[molecule]], is the average distance the particle travels between collisions with other moving particles.  The formula &lt;math&gt;\ell = (n\sigma)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; still holds for a particle with a high velocity relative to the velocities of an ensemble of identical particles with random locations. If, on the other hand, the velocities of the identical particles have a [[Maxwell distribution]], the following relationship applies:&lt;ref&gt;S. Chapman and T. G. Cowling, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cbp5JP2OTrwC&amp;pg=PA88 ''The mathematical theory of non-uniform gases''], 3rd. edition, Cambridge University Press, 1990, {{ISBN|0-521-40844-X}}, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ell = (\sqrt{2}\, n\sigma)^{-1},&lt;/math&gt;

and using &lt;math&gt;n = N/V = p/(k_\text{B}T)&lt;/math&gt; ([[ideal gas law]]) and &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \pi (2r)^2 = \pi d^2&lt;/math&gt; (effective cross-sectional area for spherical particles with radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;), it may be shown that the mean free path is&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kinetic/menfre.html |title=Mean Free Path, Molecular Collisions |publisher=Hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\ell = \frac{k_\text{B}T}{\sqrt 2 \pi d^2 p},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k''{{sub|B}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

In practice, the diameter of gas molecules is not well defined. In fact, the [[kinetic diameter]] of a molecule is defined in terms of the mean free path. Typically, gas molecules do not behave like hard spheres, but rather attract each other at larger distances and repel each other at shorter distances, as can be described with a [[Lennard-Jones potential]]. One way to deal with such "soft" molecules is to use the Lennard-Jones σ parameter as the diameter. Another way is to assume a hard-sphere gas that has the same [[kinematic viscosity|viscosity]] as the actual gas being considered. This leads to a mean free path

:&lt;math&gt;\ell = \frac{\mu}{p} \sqrt{\frac{\pi k_\text{B} T}{2 m}},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the molecular mass, and ''&amp;mu;'' is the viscosity.

These different definitions of the molecular diameter can lead to slightly different values of the mean free path.

==Nuclear and particle physics==
In particle physics the concept of the mean free path is not commonly used, being replaced by the similar concept of [[attenuation length]].  In particular, for high-energy photons, which mostly interact by electron–positron [[pair production]], the [[radiation length]] is used much like the mean free path in radiography.

Independent-particle models in nuclear physics require the undisturbed orbiting of [[nucleon]]s within the [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] before they interact with other nucleons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.res.kutc.kansai-u.ac.jp/~cook/NVSIndex.html|title=Models of the Atomic Nucleus|last=Cook|first=Norman D.|date=2010|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=978-3-642-14736-4|edition=2|location=Heidelberg|page=324|chapter=The Mean Free Path of Nucleons in Nuclei|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=The effective mean free path of a nucleon in nuclear matter must be somewhat larger than the nuclear dimensions in order to allow the use of the independent particle model.

'''Men's studies''', often called '''men and masculinities''' in academic settings, is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[academic field]] devoted to topics concerning [[men]], [[masculinity]], [[feminism]], [[gender]], and [[politics]]. It draws upon [[feminist theory]] in order to analyze different ideologies  having to do with masculinity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Allan|first=Jonathan | title = Phallic affect, or why men's rights activists have feelings | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 22&amp;ndash;41 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1097184X15574338 |date= April 2016 |url= https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1097184X15574338 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and through such analysis to examine the multiple ''masculinities'' contained in the idea of masculinity itself. Men's studies also academically examine what it means to be a man in contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Bennett|first=Jessica |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/09/fashion/masculinities-studies-stonybrook-michael-kimmel.html?_r=0|title=A master's degree in...masculinity?|date=August 8, 2015|work=[[New York Times]]|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
As a relatively new field of study, men's studies was formed largely in response to, and as a critique of, an emerging [[men's rights]] movement, and as such, has been taught in academic settings only since the 1970s.  In many universities, men's studies is a correlation to [[women's studies]] or part of a larger [[gender studies]] program, and as such its faculty tends to be sympathetic to, or engaged in, advocacy of [[feminist]] politics. Men's studies works with feminist studies to question the relationship that men have with patriarchal power throughout different temporal and historical times.&lt;ref name="Gurfinkel"&gt;{{Cite web|last=Gurfinkel|first=Helena|title=Masculinity studies: what is it, and why would a feminist care?|url=https://siuewmst.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/masculinity-studies-what-is-it-and-why-would-a-feminist-care/|website=siuewmst.wordpress.com|publisher=[[Southern Illinois University|SIUE]] Women's Studies Program via [[WordPress]]|date=December 6, 2012|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of plural ''masculinities'' was proposed by [[R.W. Connell]] in her influential book ''Masculinities'' (1995);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R. W. | author-link = R.W. Connell | title = Masculinities | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge, UK | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780745614694 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus the academic field is today often known as ''men and masculinities''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aboim | first = Sofia | title = Plural masculinities: the remaking of the self in private life | page = 5 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2016 | isbn = 9781315600901 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In contrast to the discipline of [[masculine psychology]], men's studies programs and courses often include contemporary discussions of men's rights, [[feminist theory]], [[queer theory]], [[matriarchy]], [[patriarchy]], and more generally, what proponents describe as the social, historical, and cultural constructions of [[Man|men]]. They often discuss the issues surrounding [[male privilege]], seen as evolving into more subtle forms rather than disappearing in the modern era.

== Construction of Masculinity ==
When pursuing masculinity studies, many scholars began explaining how masculinity is a [[Social constructionism|social construction]]. [[Michael Kimmel]], a prominent scholar in the field of masculinity studies, writes extensively on manhood and its definition. He does this starting with the 19th century in America, when masculinity began to be defined through proving oneself as a man. As a result, the political arena, workplace, family, and whole world was changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kimmel |editor1-first=Michael | editor-link = Michael Kimmel |title= The politics of manhood |publisher= [[Temple University Press]] |location= Philadelphia |isbn= 9781566393652 |year=1995 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ksbyvqKZL2MC }}&lt;/ref&gt; This change constructed "[[hegemonic masculinity]]", or the "practice that allowed men's dominance over women to continue",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Laurie|first=Timothy | title = Masculinity studies and the jargon of strategy: ''hegemony, tautology, sense'' | journal = [[Angelaki|Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities]], special issue: Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 13&amp;ndash;30 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | date = 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/10912537/Masculinity_Studies_and_the_Jargon_of_Strategy_Hegemony_Tautology_Sense Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; or the stereotypical definition of masculinity that many think of initially. In unpacking masculinity, the construction is understood [[Intersectionality|intersectionally]], looking at the historical, cultural, temporal, political, and psychological ways in which the definition of masculinity is created.&lt;ref name="Gurfinkel" /&gt; Because of the intersectional lens used to study masculinity, it becomes clear that there are multiple masculinities because of the various experiences that different histories, cultures, and times produce.

== Organizations ==
The [[American Men's Studies Association]] (AMSA) traces the roots of an organized field of men's studies to the early 1980s and the work of scholars involved in an [[Sexism|anti-sexist]] organization called the Men's Studies Task Group (MSTG) of the National Organization for Changing Men (NOCM) which included Martin Acker, Shepherd Bliss, [[Harry Brod]], Sam Femiano, Martin Fiebert, and [[Michael Messner]]. However, men's studies classes also pre-date NOCM, and a small number were taught in various colleges across the United States throughout the 1970s. Conferences such as the Men and Masculinity conferences sparked the creation of newsletters and journals, such as the ''Men's Studies Newsletter'' (and its successor, ''Men’s Studies Review''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Men’s Studies Review (journal) | publisher = American Men's Studies Association (AMSA) | location = Harriman, Tennessee | lccn = 93648850 | issn = 0890-9741}}&lt;/ref&gt; pertaining to the growing field of men's studies. These became prime resources for those interested in the field, providing news, bibliographies, and firsthand experiences. Following the newsletters and journals came the [[Men's Studies Press]], thus moving the academic field of masculinity studies to books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Doyle|first=James. A|last2=Femiano|first2=Sam | title = A history of the Men's Studies Press and its Association with the American Men's Studies Association | journal = [[The Journal of Men's Studies]], special issue: AMSA at 20 | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 24&amp;ndash;33 | publisher = [[Sage Publishing|Sage]] | doi = 10.3149/jms.2101.24 | date = January 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.3149/jms.2101.24 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

When NOCM changed its name to the [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]] (NOMAS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Home page | url = http://www.nomas.org/ | website = nomas.org | publisher = [[National Organization for Men Against Sexism]] (NOMAS) }}&lt;/ref&gt; the MSTG became the Men's Studies Association (MSA). The MSA was an explicitly pro-feminist group, and those who felt this was too constraining split away several years later to form the American Men's Studies Association (AMSA).

== Criticism ==
A range of criticisms have been made of the separation between "men's studies" and "gender studies". For example, Timothy Laurie and Anna Hickey-Moody insist that "[any] atomisation of masculinity studies as distinct from gender studies, feminist inquiry or queer studies must be understood as provisional and hazardous rather than as the result of absolute differences in the phenomena being investigated or expertise required".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Laurie | first1 = Timothy | last2 = Hickey-Moody | first2 = Anna | title = Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | journal = [[Angelaki|Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities]], special issue: Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;10 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017359 | date = 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017359 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/10912564 Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Joyce E. Canaan and Christine Griffin described their suspicions of The New Men's Studies (TNMS): the emergence of conferences and books on men and masculinity during a time of political and financial cuts to further education and higher education in the UK, "Is it a coincidence that TNMS is being constructed in the present context as a source of potential research, publishing deals, and (even more) jobs for the already-well-paid boys holding prestigious positions?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Canaan | first1 = Joyce E. | last2 = Griffin | first2 = Christine | chapter = The new men's studies: part of the problem or part of the solution | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yC5HBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208 | editor-last1 = Morgan | editor-first1 = D.

==Work and care==
Men's studies are notably concerned with challenging gendered arrangements of work and care, and the male breadwinner role, and policies are increasingly targeting men as fathers, as a tool of changing gender relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bjørnholt | first = Margunn | authorlink1= Margunn Bjørnholt | title = Changing men, changing times; fathers and sons from an experimental gender equality study | journal = [[The Sociological Review]] | volume = 62 | issue = 2  | pages = 295&amp;ndash;315 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-954X.12156 | date = May 2014 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-954X.12156 }} [http://www.margunnbjornholt.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Changing-men-changing-times-fathers-and-sons-from-an-experimental-gender-equality-study.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Sharia]] (Islamic Law) '''niṣāb''' (نِصاب) is the minimum amount that a Muslim must have before being obliged to zakat. Several [[hadith]] have formulas for calculating niṣāb, the most prominent of which declares that ''No Zakāt is due on wealth until one year passes''. Zakat is determined based on the amount of wealth acquired; the greater one's assets, the greater the tax. Unlike [[income tax]] in [[Secularism|secular]] states niṣāb is not subject to special exemptions.

In Islam, niṣāb is 20 [[dinar|dinār]]s for gold and 200 [[dirham]]s for silver&lt;ref&gt;[http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1516&amp;CATE=5 The Minimum Zakatable Amount (Nisab)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624184320/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1516&amp;CATE=5 |date=2007-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the original 1 to 10 exchange rate.  The dinār is a gold coin weighing one [[mithqal]] (4.25 grams) and the dirḥam is a silver coin weighing 0.7 mithqal (2.975 grams). The niṣāb is applicable to the cumulative stock of dinārs, dirḥam and any other zakatable valuables, such as merchandise that has been in store for at least one year. As long as the total value of the zakatable valuables exceeds the value of the niṣāb, zakat must be paid.

==The value of the Niṣāb==
The value of the niṣāb is calculated in dinār coins and dirḥam coins. The relation between 20 dinārs and 200 dirḥams which is part of the definition of niṣāb reflects the contemporary exchange value between the dinār and the dirḥam of 1 to 10 in the early days of Islam. In later times the exchange rate between the two Sharia coins changed according to market values, and so exchange rates of 1 to 11 and 1 to 12 are seen in early fiqh literature. This exchange rate has varied even more in the last few centuries. The shift in exchange rate meant that in later times 20 dinārs became more expensive in market value than 200 dirḥams. Despite this the definition of niṣāb has not been altered throughout Islamic history, and therefore a choice is created between the value of 20 dinārs and the value of 200 dirḥams. Both values are accepted in Shariah, and so one can choose to pay the value of either of them.

==The value of the coins and the value of the metal==
The value of one dinār is not identical to the value of the gold content of one dinār, and likewise with the silver in a dirḥam. There is also difference in value between dinārs depending on their quality and their acceptability. Although all gold or silver coins and products must be exchanged by weight and not by value in order to prevent [[Riba#Riba_al-fadl|riba al-fadl]], different coins may have different market values as is reflected in the fiqh literature when it is said that some coins are not popular (makruhi)[See Imam Malik's al-Muwatta]. The value of the dinār and dirḥam are thus different from their respective gold and silver content. This represents a problem to modern Muslims because dinār and dirḥam coins are difficult to obtain.

==A practical approach to the lack of Dinār and Dirḥams==
Some modern scholars have accepted that since dinārs and dirḥams are no longer readily available the best solution is to calculate the niṣāb using a mithqal of pure gold as a reference. Although this is not an exact calculation it is considered a valid approximation given current circumstances.

In some countries Muslim communities have minted their own dinārs and dirḥams following the original standards. These coins are used both as a method for general payment and specifically to pay zakat.

==One year rule==
In order to be liable for zakat a Muslim must possess wealth in excess of the niṣāb level for one lunar year (354 days). This year begins on the date the wealth is obtained; so long as the assets are in its owner's possession at the beginning and end of the lunar year the zakat tax is applicable.  In many modern societies niṣāb is considered equivalent to a governmentally determined ''[[poverty threshold]].''

The '''PanCam''' (Panoramic Camera) assembly is a set of two wide angle cameras for multi-spectral stereoscopic panoramic imaging, and a high resolution camera for colour imaging that has been designed to search for textural information or shapes that can be related to the presence of microorganisms on [[Mars]]. This camera assembly is part of the science payload on board the [[European Space Agency]]{{'s}} [[ExoMars rover]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.space.com/34664-exomars-facts.html ExoMars: Searching for Life on Mars]. Elizabeth Howell, ''Space.com''. March 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; tasked to search for [[biosignature]]s and [[biomarker]]s on Mars. The rover is planned to be launched in July 2020 and [[Mars landing|land on Mars]] in March 2021.

== Overview ==

This instrument will provide stereo [[multispectral image]]s, of the terrain nearby. PanCam are the "eyes" of the rover and its primary navigation system. PanCam will also provide the geological context of the sites being explored and help support the selection of the best sites to carry out exobiology studies, as well as assist in some aspect of atmospheric studies.&lt;ref name='PanCam Home'&gt;[http://exploration.esa.int/mars/45103-rover-instruments/?fbodylongid=2127 PanCam - the Panoramic Camera]. [[ESA]]. Accessed 24 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  This system will also monitor the sample from the drill before it is crushed inside the rover, where the analytical instruments will perform a detailed chemical analysis.&lt;ref name='PanCam Home'/&gt;

The Principal Investigator is Andrew Coates of the [[University College London]] in United Kingdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5162">The '''Pat Roberts Intelligence Scholars Program''' (PRISP) is a program which "links undergraduate and graduate students with US security and intelligence agencies" by providing funding to selected US students entering university, in return for a commitment to join the agency for at least 18 months on graduation.&lt;ref name=counterpunch&gt;''[[CounterPunch]]'', 23 June 2009, [http://www.counterpunch.org/price06232009.html Son of PRISP: Obama's Classroom Spies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129210246/http://www.counterpunch.org/price06232009.html |date=2010-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PRISP is a decentralized program which funds students through various intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name=CPMar05/&gt; The program was established by the US Congress in 2004. In 2010 it became a permanent, authorized funded IC program. By 2011 most IC agencies participate in this program which is designated to recruit and train analysts and linguists. PRISP funding can be used to pay hiring incentives, such as a recruitment bonus or reimburse previous educational expenses for individuals who already possess the necessary skills (language, specialized scientific or geographical area expertise), or to provide additional education or training for those selected for the program. There is a service obligation of 18 months. IC agencies' websites should be consulted for specifics on any particular agency's PRISP program participation.

PRISP is named after Senator [[Pat Roberts]] (the then Chairman of the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]]). In April 2009, [[Citizens Against Government Waste]] gave PRISP a "Narcissist Award".&lt;ref&gt;''Fox News'', 14 April 2009, [http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/government/anti-pork-group-announces-pig-book-awards/ Anti-Pork Group Announces 'Pig Book' Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423233408/http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/markets/industries/government/anti-pork-group-announces-pig-book-awards/ |date=2009-04-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, following PRISP, an additional, similar program (Intelligence Community Scholars Program, ICSP) was approved.

It is used commercially as a form of [[waste treatment]] and has been tested for the gasification of [[municipal solid waste]], [[biomass]], [[industrial waste]], [[hazardous waste]], and solid [[hydrocarbons]], such as [[coal]], [[oil sands]], [[Petroleum coke|petcoke]] and [[oil shale]].&lt;ref name=kalinenko/&gt;

== Process ==
Small plasma torches typically use an [[inert gas]] such as [[argon]] where larger torches require [[nitrogen]]. The [[electrode]]s vary from [[copper]] or [[tungsten]] to [[hafnium]] or [[zirconium]], along with various other [[alloy]]s.  A strong electric current under high voltage passes between the two electrodes as an [[electric arc]]. Pressurized inert gas is [[Ionization|ionized]] passing through the plasma created by the arc. The torch's temperature ranges from {{convert|4000|to|25000|F|C|-2}}.&lt;ref name="recoveredenergy"&gt;

The waste is heated, melted and finally [[Vaporization|vaporized]]. Only at these extreme conditions can molecular [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] occur by breaking apart [[Covalent bond|molecular bonds]]. [[molecule|Complex molecules]] are separated into individual [[atoms]]. The resulting elemental components are in a gaseous phase ([[syngas]]). Molecular dissociation using plasma is referred to as "plasma [[pyrolysis]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Feedstocks ===
The feedstock for plasma waste treatment is most often [[municipal solid waste]], [[organic waste]], or both. Feedstocks may also include [[biomedical waste]] and [[Dangerous goods|hazmat]] materials.  Content and consistency of the waste directly impacts performance of a plasma facility. Pre-sorting and recycling useful material before gasification provides consistency. Too much inorganic material such as metal and construction waste increases slag production, which in turn decreases [[syngas]] production. However, a benefit is that the slag itself is chemically inert and safe to handle (certain materials may affect the content of the gas produced, however&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt;). Shredding waste before entering the main chamber helps to increase syngas production. This creates an efficient transfer of energy which ensures more materials are broken down.&lt;ref name=HSW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/plasma-converter.htm| title=How Stuff Works- Plasma Converter|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For improved processing steam is sometimes added into the plasma gasification process.

=== Yields ===

Pure highly calorific [[syngas|synthesis gas]] consists predominantly of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="synconversion"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inorganic compound]]s in the waste stream are not broken down but melted, which includes glass, ceramics, and various metals.

The high temperature and lack of oxygen prevents the formation of many toxic compounds such as [[furan]]s, [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]], or [[sulfur dioxide]] in the flame itself. However, dioxins are formed during cooling of the syngas.

Metals resulting from plasma [[pyrolysis]] can be recovered from the slag and eventually sold as a commodity. Inert slag produced from some processes is granulated and can be used in construction.  A portion of the syngas produced feeds on-site turbines, which power the plasma torches and thus support the feed system. This is self-sustaining electric power.&lt;ref name="synconversion"/&gt;

'''Productive aging''' refers to activities which older people engage in on a daily basis. Older adults have opportunities and constraints which are related to the productive aging process. The community and society need to develop more options for older adults to choose their way of being engaged in the community and contributing to others. Things such as policy changes and resource commitments are important to promote productive aging. One example of productive aging is retirement which moves older adults from paid forms of productivity to nonpaid activities. Many activities can give older adults opportunities and constraints related to the productive aging process. These activities include [[retirement]], employment, economic well-being, leisure, religious participation and [[spirituality]], membership in community associations and volunteerism, education, and political action. Older adults will find many opportunities to engage in activities which contribute to society or follow personal creative activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/productiveaging/productiveaging.html|title=CDC - Productive Aging and Work – What is Productive Aging? - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pyrolysis''' is the [[thermal]] [[Chemical decomposition|decomposition]] of materials at elevated temperatures in an inert atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/P/P04961.html |title=Compendium of Chemical Terminology |accessdate=2018-01-10 |year=2009 |page=1824 |publisher=[[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the change of [[chemical composition]] and is irreversible. The word is coined from the [[Greek language|Greek]]-derived [[morpheme|element]]s ''pyro'' "fire" and ''[[lysis]]'' "separating".

Pyrolysis is most commonly used to the treatment of [[organic compound|organic]] materials. It is one of the processes involved in [[charring]] wood.&lt;ref name=inno&gt;[http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/innofirewood/stateoftheart/database/burning/burning.html ''Burning of wood''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209095142/http://virtual.vtt.fi/virtual/innofirewood/stateoftheart/database/burning/burning.html |date=2010-02-09 }}, InnoFireWood's website. Accessed on 2010-02-06.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, pyrolysis of organic substances produces volatile products and leaves a solid residue enriched in carbon, [[char]]. Extreme pyrolysis, which leaves mostly [[carbon]] as the residue, is called [[carbonization]].

The process is used heavily in the [[chemical industry]], for example, to produce [[ethylene]], many forms of [[carbon]], and other chemicals from petroleum, coal, and even wood, to produce [[coke (fuel)|coke]] from [[coal]].  Aspirational applications of pyrolysis would convert [[biomass]] into [[syngas]] and [[biochar]],  waste plastics back into usable oil, or waste into safely disposable substances.

==Process terminology and mechanism==
Special cases of pyrolysis include [[dry distillation]], [[destructive distillation]], [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]], and [[thermal depolymerization]].  It generally involves the breaking of chemical bonds in molecules to give smaller molecules; but may also leave residues with larger molecular mass.  The phenomenon involves exceeding the [[decomposition temperature]] of the material.

Pyrolysis differs from other processes like [[combustion]] and [[hydrolysis]] in that it usually does not involve the addition of other reagents such as [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in combustion) or water (in hydrolysis).&lt;ref&gt;Cory A. Kramer, Reza Loloee, Indrek S. Wichman and Ruby N. Ghosh, 2009, [http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1638571 Time Resolved Measurements of Pyrolysis Products From Thermoplastic Poly-Methyl-Methacrylate (PMMA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106220719/http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1638571 |date=2014-11-06 }} ''ASME 2009 International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition''&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice, it is often not practical to achieve completely O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;- or water-free conditions, especially as pyrolysis is often conducted on complex mixtures.  The term has also been applied to the decomposition of organic material in the presence of [[superheated water]] or steam ([[hydrous pyrolysis]]), for example, in the [[Cracking (chemistry)|steam cracking]] of oil. Pyrolysis has been assumed to take place during [[catagenesis (geology)|catagenesis]], the conversion of [[kerogen|buried organic matter]] to [[fossil fuels]]. 

Conversely, the starting material may be heated in a [[vacuum]] to decrease the [[boiling point]] of the byproducts and avoid adverse chemical reactions. An example is the process of [[flash vacuum pyrolysis]] used in [[organic synthesis]].

Volatile pyrolysis byproducts can be [[Chemical analysis|analyzed]] through separation by [[gas chromatography]] and identification by [[mass spectrometry]], a process known as [[pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry|Py-GC-MS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Goodacre, R.; Kell, D. B.|title=Pyrolysis mass spectrometry and its applications in biotechnology|journal=Curr. Opin. Biotechnol.|year=1996|volume=7||pages= 20-28|doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(96)80090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Peacock, P. M.; McEwen, C. N.|title=Mass Spectrometry of Synthetic Polymers. Anal. Chem.|year=2006|volume=78|pages=3957-3964|doi=10.1021/ac0606249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrolysis is also used in [[carbon-14 dating]].

== Occurrence and uses ==
===Ethylene===
Pyrolysis is used to produce [[ethylene]], the chemical compound produced on the largest scale industrially (&gt;110 million tons/year in 2005).  In this process, hydrocarbons from petroleum are heated to around 600 °C in the presence of steam, i.e. [[steam cracking]].  The resulting ethylene is used to make antifreeze ([[ethylene glycol]]), PVC (via [[vinyl chloride]]), and many polymers, such as polyethylene and polystyrene.&lt;ref name=UllmannEthylene&gt;{{cite book |first1=Heinz |last1=Zimmermann |first2=Roland |last2=Walz |chapter=Ethylene |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2008 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a10_045.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coke, carbon, charcoals, and chars ===
Carbon and carbon-rich materials have desirable properties but are nonvolatile, even at high temperatures.  Consequently, pyrolysis is used to produce many kinds of carbon; these can be used for fuel, as reagents in steelmaking (coke), and as structural materials.

High temperature pyrolysis is used on an industrial scale to convert [[coal]] into [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] for [[metallurgy]], especially [[steelmaking]].  Volatile products are often useful, including [[benzene]] and [[pyridine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Ludwig Briesemeister, Andreas Geißler, Stefan Halama, Stephan Herrmann, Ulrich Kleinhans, Markus Steibel, Markus Ulbrich, Alan W. Scaroni, M. Rashid Khan, Semih Eser, Ljubisa R. Radovic|title=Coal Pyrolysis|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim| doi=10.1002/14356007.a07_245.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Coke can also be produced from the solid residue left from petroleum refining.
[[File:CoalPyrolysisProducts.png|thumb|290px|Typical organic products obtained by pyrolysis of coal (X = CH, N).]]
The coke-making or "coking" process consists of heating the material in "coking ovens" to very high temperatures (up to {{convert|900|C|F|disp=or|sigfig=2}}) so that those molecules are broken down into lighter volatile substances, which leave the vessel, and a porous but hard residue that is mostly carbon and inorganic ash. The amount of volatiles varies with the source material, but is typically 25–30% of it by weight.

The original [[xylem|vascular structure]] of the wood and the pores created by escaping gases combine to produce a light and porous material. By starting with a dense wood-like material, such as [[nutshell]]s or [[peach]] [[endocarp|stone]]s, one obtains a form of charcoal with particularly fine pores (and hence a much larger pore surface area), called [[activated carbon]], which is used as an [[adsorption|adsorbent]] for a wide range of chemical substances.

[[Biochar]] is the residue of incomplete organic pyrolysis, e.g., from cooking fires.  They are a key component of the [[terra preta]] soils associated with ancient [[indigenous peoples of Brazil|indigenous]] communities of the [[Amazon basin]].&lt;ref name="lehmann1"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Terra preta is much sought by local farmers for its superior fertility and capacity to promote and retain an enhanced suite of beneficial microbiota than the typical red soil of the region.  Efforts are underway to recreate these soils through [[biochar]], the solid residue of pyrolysis of various materials, mostly organic waste.

[[Carbon fiber]]s are filaments of carbon that can be used to make very strong yarns and textiles. Carbon fiber items are often produced by spinning and weaving the desired item from fibers of a suitable [[polymer]], and then pyrolyzing the material at a high temperature (from {{convert|1500|-|3000|°C|F|disp=or|sigfig=3}}).  The first carbon fibers were made from [[rayon]], but [[polyacrylonitrile]] has become the most common starting material.  For their first workable [[electric lamp]]s, [[Joseph Wilson Swan]] and [[Thomas Edison]] used carbon filaments made by pyrolysis of [[cotton]] yarns and [[bamboo]] splinters, respectively.

Pyrolysis is the reaction used to coat a preformed substrate with a layer of [[pyrolytic carbon]]. This is typically done in a fluidized bed reactor heated to {{convert|1000|-|2000|°C|F|disp=or|sigfig=3}}. Pyrolytic carbon coatings are used in many applications, including [[artificial heart valve]]s.&lt;ref name="ratner"&gt;Ratner, Buddy D. (2004). Pyrolytic carbon.

Other sources of [[organic matter]] as feedstock for pyrolysis include greenwaste, sawdust, waste wood, nut shells, straw, cotton trash, rice hulls. Animal waste including poultry litter, dairy manure, and potentially other manures are also under evaluation. Some industrial byproducts are also suitable feedstock including paper sludge and distillers grain.&lt;ref name=bestEnergiesBestPyrol&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;  Fuel bio-oil can also be produced by [[hydrous pyrolysis]].

=== Semiconductors ===
The process of [[metalorganic vapour phase epitaxy]] (MOCVD) entails pyrolysis of volatile organometallic compounds to give semiconductors, hard coatings, and other applicable materials.  The reactions entail thermal degradation of precursors, with deposition of the inorganic component and release of the hydrocarbons as gaseous waste. Since it is an atom-by-atom deposition, these atoms organize themselves into crystals to form the bulk semiconductor. Silicon chips are produced by the pyrolysis of silane:
:SiH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  →  Si  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
[[Gallium arsenide]], another semiconductor, forms upon co-pyrolysis of [[trimethylgallium]] and [[arsine]].

=== Recycling===
{{See also|Thermal Depolymerisation}}
Pyrolysis can also be used to treat plastic waste.  The main advantage is the reduction in volume of the waste.  In principle, pyrolysis will regenerate the monomers (precursors) to the polymers that are treated, but in practice the process is neither a clean nor an economically competitive source of monomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first1=Walter |last1=Kaminsky |title=Plastics, Recycling |encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=Weinheim |year=2000 |doi=10.1002/14356007.a21_057}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.J.

==Fine chemical synthesis==
Pyrolysis is used in the production of chemical compounds, mainly, but not only, in the research laboratory.  

The area of boron-hydride clusters started with the study of the pyrolysis of [[diborane]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) at ca. 200 °C.  Products include the clusters  [[pentaborane]] and [[decaborane]].  These pyrolyses involve not only cracking (to give H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), but also re[[condensation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}} gives Greenwood, Norman N.; Earnshaw, Alan (1997).

==History==
Pyrolysis has been used for turning wood into [[charcoal]] since ancient times. Many important chemical substances, such as [[phosphorus]] and [[sulfuric acid]], were first obtained by this process. In their embalming process, the ancient Egyptians used methanol, which they obtained from the pyrolysis of wood.  The dry distillation of wood remained the major source of methanol into the early 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authors=E. Fiedler, G. Grossmann, D. B. Kersebohm, G.

A '''riometer''' (commonly ''r''elative ''i''onospheric ''o''pacity meter, although originally: '''R'''elative '''I'''onospheric '''O'''pacity '''M'''eter for '''E'''xtra-'''T'''errestrial '''E'''missions of '''R'''adio noise&lt;ref name="little"&gt;{{cite journal | first=C.G. | last=Little | first2=H. | last2=Leinbach |date=February 1959 | title=The Riometer - A Device for the Continuous Measurement of Ionospheric Absorption | journal=Proceedings of the IRE | volume=47 | issue=2 | pages=315–320 | doi= 10.1109/JRPROC.1959.287299}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an instrument used to quantify the amount of electromagnetic-wave [[ionospheric absorption]] in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=R.D | last=Hunsucker |author2=J.K Hargreaves | year=2003 | title=The High-Latitude Ionosphere and its Effects on Radio Propagation|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the name implies, a riometer measures the "opacity" of the ionosphere to radio noise emanating from cosmic origin. In the absence of any ionospheric absorption, this radio noise, averaged over a sufficiently long period of time, forms a ''quiet-day curve.'' Increased ionization in the ionosphere will cause absorption of radio signals (both terrestrial and extraterrestrial), and a departure from the quiet-day curve. The difference between the quiet-day curve and the riometer signal is an indicator of the amount of absorption, and is measured in [[decibels]]. Riometers are generally passive radio [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] operating in the [[VHF]] radio frequency range (~30-40&amp;nbsp;MHz). Electromagnetic radiation of that frequency is typically Galactic [[synchrotron radiation]] and is absorbed in the Earth's D region of the ionosphere.

==Description==
The riometer was developed in the mid 1950s by scientists at the [[University of Alaska]] who were researching the radio propagation effects of [[aurorae]].&lt;ref name="little" /&gt; At times aurorae resulted in complete failure of long distance radio communication to planes in the Arctic - a matter of considerable concern to the US Air Force at a time of tension with the Soviet Union{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}. Riometers are still used today for ionospheric research and are typically located in polar and sub-polar areas.

Initially, riometers were single, wide-beam detectors and measured the cosmic noise absorption (CNA). Multi-beam riometers have also been developed, which have multiple narrow beams, typically formed by a Butler matrix on a phased antenna array. Each beam forms its own riometer and has its own quiet-day curve determination. These individual beams form [[pixels]] on the sky allowing simple images of cosmic noise absorption to be formed.&lt;ref name="HonaryMarple2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Honary|first1=F.|last2=Marple|first2=S.R.|last3=Barratt|first3=K.|last4=Chapman|first4=P.|last5=Grill|first5=M.|last6=Nielsen|first6=E.|title=Invited Article: Digital beam-forming imaging riometer systems|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|volume=82|issue=3|year=2011|pages=031301|issn=0034-6748|doi=10.1063/1.3567309}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, interferometry has been used to provide all-sky, spatially-continuous imaging of CNA.&lt;ref name="McKayFallows2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=D|last2=Fallows|first2=R.A.|last3=Norden|first3=M.|display-authors=etal|title=All-sky interferometric riometry|journal=Radio Science|volume=50|issue=10|year=2015|pages=1050–1061|issn=0048-6604|doi=10.1002/2015RS005709}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to use riometers to observe multiple frequencies (typically in the range 25-40&amp;nbsp;MHz). An inverse problem technique can be applied to the measurements to ascertain not just the absorption, but a model of the electron content as a function of sight distance.&lt;ref name="KeroVierinen2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kero|first1=A.|display-authors=etal|title=Ionospheric electron density profiles inverted from a spectral riometer measurement|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=41|issue=15|year=2014|pages=5370–5375|issn=0094-8276|doi=10.1002/2014GL060986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Seed trees''' are [[tree]]s left after reproduction cutting to provide [[seeds]] for natural regeneration in the [[Silviculture#Silvicultural_systems|seed-tree method]].  These trees serve as both the gene source for the new crop of regeneration and as a source of timber during future cuttings. Because of its importance, a '''seed tree''' should be carefully chosen based upon both economic and biological factors. Selected seed trees should be the desired species, [[phenotype|phenotypically]] superior, prolific in seeding and flowering, sturdy and healthy, free of damage, and of good growth form.

After the site has been successfully regenerated, seed trees may be commercially harvested or the trees may be retained for visual enhancement and as backup against catastrophic losses of regeneration due to agents such as fire or drought.  The presence of seed trees distinguishes the seed-tree method from [[clearcutting]].  Many people consider the seed-tree method  more aesthetically pleasing than clearcutting because some mature trees are retained on the site for at least until regeneration becomes well established.

Seed-tree method is usually applied to plants with a wind blown seed (Scots pine), rather not to those with hard seeds, like [[oak]] and [[beech]] that do not travel far from the originating tree.

'''Silvia Maciá''' (born 1972) is an American [[marine biologist]] and [[professor]] of [[biology]] at [[Barry University]] in [[Miami Shores, FL]].  Courses she has taught include [[marine biology]], [[oceanography]], [[marine ecosystems|tropical marine ecosystems]], [[ecology]], [[environmental science]] and [[botany]].

Her research interests include [[pipefish]] mating behavior, [[seagrass]] community ecology, [[coral reef]] grazing ecology and seagrass restoration. Her research involves both laboratory and field work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.barry.edu/biology/faculty/macia.html|title=Silvia Maciá, PhD : Faculty and Staff :  Biology : College of Arts and Sciences : Barry University, Miami Shores, Florida|website=www.barry.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maciá is perhaps best noted for her discovery that [[Caribbean reef squid]] (''Sepioteuthis sepioidea'') can fly. She and her biologist husband Michael Robinson were boating on the north coast of [[Jamaica]] when she spotted something fly out of the water. She initially thought they were [[flying fish]] but after watching for a few seconds, she realized they were squid.&lt;ref name=SA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-squid-fly/|title=''Fact or Fiction: Can a Squid Fly Out of Water?''|author=Ferris Jabr|publisher=[[Scientific American]]|date=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''south-pointing chariot''' (or '''carriage''') was an ancient Chinese two-wheeled vehicle that carried a movable pointer to indicate the [[south]], no matter how the chariot turned. Usually, the pointer took the form of a [[doll]] or figure with an outstretched arm. The chariot was supposedly used as a [[compass]] for [[navigation]] and may also have had other purposes.

The ancient Chinese invented a mobile-like armored cart used in from the 5th century BC called the [[Dongwu Che]] ({{zh|c=洞屋车}}). It was used for the purpose of protecting warriors on the battlefield. The Chinese war wagon was designed as a kind of mobile protective cart with a shed-like roof. It would serve to be rolled up to city fortifications to provide protection for [[sappers]] digging underneath to weaken a wall's foundation. The early Chinese war wagon became the basis of technologies for the making of ancient Chinese south-pointing chariots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fighting Techniques of the Oriental World 1200-1860 |last=Haskew |first= Michael E |last2=Jorgensen |first2= Christer |last3=McNab |first3= Chris |last4=Niderost |first4= Eric |publisher=Metro Books |year=2008 |isbn= 978-1905704965 |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A History of Chinese Science and Technology |last=Lu |first=	Yongxiang |publisher=Springer |year=2014 |isbn=978-3662441626 |volume=3 |publication-date=October 20, 2014 |page=516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are legends of earlier south-pointing chariots, but the first reliably documented one was created by the Chinese mechanical engineer [[Ma Jun]] (c. 200&amp;ndash;265 CE) of [[Cao Wei]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]]. No ancient chariots still exist, but many extant ancient Chinese texts mention them, saying they were used intermittently until about 1300 CE. Some include information about their inner components and workings.

There were probably several types of south-pointing chariot which worked differently. In most or all of them, the rotating road wheels mechanically operated a [[gear]]ed mechanism to keep the pointer aimed correctly. The mechanism had no magnets and did not automatically detect which direction was south. The pointer was aimed southward by hand at the start of a journey. Subsequently, whenever the chariot turned, the mechanism rotated the pointer relative to the body of the chariot to counteract the turn and keep the pointer aiming in a constant direction, to the south. Thus the mechanism did a kind of directional [[dead reckoning]], which is inherently prone to cumulative errors and uncertainties. Some chariots' mechanisms may have had [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears. If so, it was probably the first use of differentials anywhere in the world.

==Historical texts==

===Earliest sources===
[[File:指南車圖 (三才圖會).jpg|thumb|upright|An image of a south-pointing chariot from ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'' (first published 1609)]]

The south-pointing chariot, a mechanical-geared, wheeled vehicle used to discern the southern cardinal direction (without magnetics), was given a brief description by Ma's contemporary [[Fu Xuan]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 40"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary 3rd century CE source of the ''[[Weilüe]]'', written by the East Han Dynasty politician [[Yuan Huan]] also described the south-pointing chariot of belonging to the Chinese mechanical engineer and politician [[Ma Jun]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288" /&gt; The [[Jin Dynasty (265&amp;ndash;420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265&amp;ndash;420 CE) era text of the ''Shu Zheng Ji'' (Records of Military Expeditions), written by Guo Yuansheng, recorded that south-pointing chariots were often stored in the northern [[gatehouse]] of the Government Workshops (Shang Fang) of the capital city.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288" /&gt; However, the later written ''[[Book of Song|Song Shu]]'' (''Book of Song'') (6th century CE) recorded the south-pointing chariot's design and use in further detail, as well as creating the background legend of the device's (supposed) use long before Ma's time, in the [[Western Zhou Dynasty]] (1050&amp;ndash;771 BCE). The book also provided a description of the south-pointing chariot's re-invention and use in times after Ma Jun and the Three Kingdoms. The 6th century CE text, translated by the British scientist and historian [[Joseph Needham]], reads as follows (the south-pointing chariot is referred to as the south-pointing carriage):

{{cquote|The south-pointing carriage was first constructed by the Duke of Zhou (beginning of the 1st millennium [[Before Common Era|BC]]) as a means of conducting homewards certain envoys who had arrived from a great distance beyond the frontiers. The country to be traversed was a boundless plain, in which people lost their bearings as to east and west, so (the Duke) caused this vehicle to be made in order that the ambassadors should be able to distinguish north and south. The ''Gui Gu Zi'' book says that the people of the [[Zheng (state)|State of Zheng]], when collecting jade, always carried with them a 'south-pointer', and by means of this were never in doubt (as to their position). During the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han Dynasty|Former Han]] dynasties, however, nothing more was heard of the vehicle. In the [[Han Dynasty|Later Han]] period, [[Zhang Heng]] re-invented it, but owing to the confusion and turmoil at the close of the dynasty it was not preserved.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 286"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 286.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|In the State of Wei, (in the [[Three Kingdoms|San Guo]] period) Gaotong Long and Qin Lang were both famous scholars; they disputed about the south-pointing carriage before the court, saying that there was no such thing, and that the story was nonsense. But during the Qing-long reign period (233&amp;ndash;237 AD) the emperor Ming Di commissioned the scholar Ma Jun to construct one, and he duly succeeded. This again was lost during the troubles attending the establishment of the [[Jin Dynasty (265&amp;ndash;420)|Jin Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 286 287"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 286&amp;ndash;287.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|Later on, [[Shi Hu]] (emperor of the [[Jie (ethnic group)|Jie]] [[Later Zhao]] Dynasty) had one made by Xie Fei, and again Linghu Sheng made one for Yao Xing (emperor of the [[Later Qin]] dynasty). The latter was obtained by emperor An Di of the Jin in the 13th year of the Yi-xi reign-period (417 AD), and it finally came into the hands of emperor [[Emperor Wu of Liu Song|Wu Di]] of the [[Liu Song Dynasty]] when he took over the administration of [[Chang'an]]. Its appearance and construction was like that of a drum-carriage ([[odometer]]). A wooden figure of a man was placed at the top, with its arm raised and pointing to the south, (and the mechanism was arranged in such a way that) although the carriage turned round and round, the pointer-arm still indicated the south. In State processions, the south-pointing carriage led the way, accompanied by the imperial guard.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 287"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 287.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|These vehicles, constructed as they had been by barbarian ([[Qiang people|Qiang]]) workmen, did not function particularly well. Though called south-pointing carriages, they very often did not point true, and had to negotiate curves step by step, with the help of someone inside to adjust the machinery. The ingenious man from [[Fanyang]], Zi [[Zu Chongzhi]] frequently said, therefore, that a new (and properly automatic) south-pointing carriage ought to be constructed. So towards the close of the Sheng-Ming reign period (477&amp;ndash;479 AD) the emperor [[Emperor Shun of Liu Song|Shun Di]], during the premiership of the Prince of Qi, commissioned (Zi Zu Chongzhi) to make one, and when it was completed it was tested by Wang Seng-qian, military governor of Tanyang, and Liu Hsiu, president of the Board of Censors. The workmanship was excellent, and although the carriage was twisted and turned in a hundred directions, the hand never failed to point to the south. Under the Jin, moreover, there had also been a south-pointing ship.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 287"/&gt;}}

The last sentence of the passage is of great interest for navigation at sea, since the magnetic [[compass]] used for seafaring navigation was not used until the time of [[Shen Kuo]] (1031&amp;ndash;1095). Although the ''Song Shu'' text describes earlier precedents of the south-pointing chariot before the time of Ma Jun, this is not entirely credible, as there are no pre-Han or Han Dynasty era texts that describe the device.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 287 288"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 287&amp;ndash;288.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the first known source to describe stories of its legendary use during the Zhou period was the ''Gu Jin Zhu'' book of [[Cui Bao]] (c. 300 CE), written soon after the Three Kingdoms era.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 288&lt;/ref&gt; Cui Bao also wrote that the intricate details of construction for the device were once written in the ''Shang Fang Gu Shi'' (''Traditions of the Imperial Workshops''), but the book was lost by his time.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288"/&gt;

[[File:The Chinese-children instruction vehicle of Expo 2005 Aichi Japan.jpg|Children's instructive toy chariot in Chinese display at [[Expo 2005]] in Japan|thumb]]

===Japan===
The invention of the south-pointing chariot also made its way to [[Japan]] by the 7th century. The ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (The Chronicles of Japan) of 720 CE described the earlier Chinese [[Buddhist]] [[monk]]s [[Zhi Yu]] and [[Zhi You]] constructing several south-pointing Chariots for [[Emperor Tenji]] of Japan in 658 CE.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 289"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 289.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up by several more chariot devices built in 666 CE as well.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 289"/&gt;

===''Song Shi''===

The south-pointing chariot was also combined with the earlier Han Dynasty era invention of the [[odometer]] (also [[Greco-Roman]]), a mechanical device used to measure distance traveled, and found in all modern [[automobile]]s. It was mentioned in the [[Song Dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279 CE) historical text of the ''Song Shi'' (compiled in 1345) that the engineers [[Yan Su]] (in 1027 CE) and [[Wu Deren]] (in 1107 CE) both created south-pointing chariots, which it details as follows.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 291"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 291.&lt;/ref&gt; (In Needham's translation, inches and feet (ft) are used as units of distance. 1 inch is 25.4 millimetres. 1&amp;nbsp;ft is 12 inches or 304.8&amp;nbsp;mm.)

{{cquote|In the 5th year of the Tian-Sheng reign period of the [[Emperor Renzong of Song|emperor Renzong]] (1027 AD), Yan Su, a Divisional Director in the Ministry of Works, made a south-pointing carriage. He memorialised the throne, saying, [after the usual historical introduction]: 'Throughout the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms|Five Dynasties]] and until the reigning dynasty there has been, so far as I know, no one who has been able to construct such a vehicle. But now I have invented a design myself and have succeeded in completing it'.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 291"/&gt;}}

{{cquote|'The method involves using a carriage with a single pole (for two horses). Above the outside framework of the body of the carriage let there be a cover in two stories. Set a wooden image of a ''xian'' (immortal) at the top, stretching out its arm to indicate the south. Use 9 wheels, great and small, with a total of 120 teeth, i.e. 2 foot-wheels (i.e. road-wheels, on which the carriage runs) 6 ft. high and 18 ft. in circumference, attached to the foot wheels, 2 vertical subordinate wheels, 2.4 ft. in diameter and 7.2 ft. in circumference, each with 24 teeth, the teeth being at intervals of 3 inches apart.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 291"/&gt;}}

{{cquote|'...Then below the crossbar at the end of the pole, two small vertical wheels 3 inches in diameter and pierced by an iron axle, to the left 1 small horizontal wheel, 1.2 feet in diameter, with 12 teeth, to the right 1 small horizontal wheel, 1.2 ft. in diameter, with 12 teeth, in the middle 1 large horizontal wheel, of diameter 4.8 ft. and circumference 14.4 ft., with 48 teeth, the teeth at intervals of 3 inches apart; in the middle a vertical shaft piercing the center (of the large horizontal wheel) 8 ft. high and 3 inches in diameter; at the top carrying the wooden figure of the ''xian'''.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 291"/&gt;

After this initial description of Yan Su's device, the text continues to describe the work of Wu Deren, who crafted a wheeled device that would combine the odometer and south-pointing chariot:

{{cquote|It was ordered that the method should be handed down to the (appropriate) officials so that the machine might be made. In the first year of the Da-Guan reign period (1107 AD), the Chamberlain Wu Deren presented specifications of the south-pointing carriage and the carriage with the li-recording drum (odometer). The two vehicles were made, and were first used that year at the great ceremony of the ancestral sacrifice.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 292"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 292.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|The body of the south-pointing carriage was 11.15 ft. (long), 9.5 ft. wide, and 10.9 ft. deep. The carriage wheels were 5.7 ft. in diameter, the [[carriage pole]] 10.5 ft. long, and the carriage body in two stories, upper and lower. In the middle was placed a partition. Above there stood a figure of a ''xian'' holding a rod, on the left and right were tortoises and cranes, one each on either side, and four figures of boys each holding a tassel. In the upper story there were at the four corners [[trip-mechanism]]s, and also 13 horizontal wheels, each 1.85 ft. in diameter, 5.55 ft. in circumference, with 32 teeth at intervals of 1.8 inches apart. A central shaft, mounted on the partition, pierced downwards.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 292"/&gt;}}

{{cquote|In the lower story were 13 wheels. In the middle was the largest horizontal wheel, 3.8 ft. in diameter, 11.4 ft. in circumference, and having 100 teeth at intervals of 2.1 inches apart.

== Chariots with differential gears ==

===Background and explanation===
[[File:Transmission diagram.JPG|thumb|An illustration of a differential between the drive shaft (at bottom right) and driving wheels of an automobile]]

There is a widely believed hypothesis that most, if not all, south-pointing chariots worked by means of [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} A differential is an assembly of gears, nowadays used in almost all automobiles except some electric and hybrid-electric ones, which has three shafts linking it to the external world. They are conveniently labelled A, B, and C. The gears cause the rotation speed of Shaft A to be proportional to the ''sum'' of the rotation speeds of Shafts B and C. There are no other limitations on the rotation speeds of the shafts.

In an automobile, Shaft A is connected to the engine (through the transmission), and Shafts B and C are connected to two road wheels, one on each side of the vehicle. When the vehicle turns, the wheel going around the outside of the turning curve has to roll further and rotate faster than the wheel on the inside. The differential permits this to happen while both wheels are being driven by the engine. If the sum of the speeds of the wheels is constant, the speed of the engine does not change.

In a south-pointing chariot, according to the hypothesis, Shaft B was connected to one road wheel and Shaft C was connected ''through a direction-reversing gear'' to the other road wheel. This made Shaft A rotate at a speed that was proportional to the ''difference'' between the rotation speeds of the two wheels. The pointing doll was connected (possibly through intermediate gears) to Shaft A. When the chariot moved in a straight line, the two wheels turned at equal speeds, and the doll did not rotate. When the chariot turned, the wheels rotated at different speeds (for the same reason as in an automobile), so the differential caused the doll to rotate, compensating for the turning of the chariot.

The hypothesis that there were south-pointing chariots with differential gears originated in the 20th century. People who were familiar with modern (e.g. automotive) uses of differentials interpreted some of the ancient Chinese descriptions in ways that agreed with their own ideas. Essentially, they re-invented the south-pointing chariot, as it had previously been re-invented several times in antiquity. Working chariots that use differentials have been constructed in recent decades. Whether any such chariots existed previously is not known with certainty.

Although the [[Antikythera mechanism#Investigations and reconstructions|Antikythera mechanism]] is believed to have used differential gears, the first true differential gear definitely known to have been used was by Joseph Williamson in 1720.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 298"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; He used a differential for correcting the [[equation of time]] for a [[clock]] that displayed both [[Local mean time|mean]] and [[solar time]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 298" /&gt;

=== Geometrical properties ===
If the south-pointing chariot were built perfectly accurately, using a differential gear, and if it travelled on an Earth that was perfectly smooth, it would have interesting properties. It would be a mechanical compass that transports a direction, given by the pointer, along the path it travels. Mathematically the device performs [[parallel transport]] along the path it travels.

The chariot can be used to detect straight lines or [[geodesics]]. A path on a surface the chariot travels along is a geodesic if and only if the pointer does not rotate with respect to the base of the chariot.

Because of the [[curvature]] of the Earth's surface (due to it being curved around as a globe), the chariot would generally not continue to point due south as it moves. For example, if the chariot moves along a geodesic (as approximated by any [[great circle]]) the pointer should instead stay at a fixed angle to the path. Also, if two chariots travel by different routes between the same starting and finishing points, their pointers, which were aimed in the same direction at the start, usually do not point in the same direction at the finish. Likewise, if a chariot goes around a closed loop, starting and finishing at the same point on the Earth's surface, its pointer generally does not aim in the same direction at the finish as it did at the start. The difference is the [[holonomy]] of the path, and is proportional to the enclosed area. If the journeys are short compared with the radius of the Earth, these discrepancies are small and may have no practical importance. Nevertheless, they show that this type of chariot, based on differential gears, would be an imperfect compass even if constructed exactly and used in ideal conditions.

=== Lack of precision, and implications ===
Real machines are never built perfectly accurately. Simple geometry shows that if the chariot's mechanism is based on a differential gear and if, for example, the width of the track of the chariot (the separation between its wheels) is three metres, and if the wheels are intended to be identical but actually differ in diameter by one part in a thousand, then if the chariot travels one kilometre in a straight line, the "south-pointing" figure will rotate nearly twenty degrees. If it initially points exactly to the south, at the end of the one-kilometre trip it will point almost to the [[Cardinal direction|south-southeast]] or [[Boxing the compass|south-southwest]], depending on which wheel is the larger. If the chariot travels nine kilometres, the figure will end up pointing almost due north. Obviously, this would make it useless as a south-pointing compass. To be a useful navigational tool, the figure would have to rotate no more than a couple of degrees over a journey of a hundred kilometres, but this would require the chariot's wheels to be equal in diameter to within one part in a million. Even if the process of manufacturing the wheels were capable of this precision (which would not be possible with ancient Chinese methods), it is doubtful that the equality of the wheels could be maintained for long as they are subjected to the wear and tear of travelling across open country. Irregularity of the ground would add further errors to the device's functioning.

Considerable scepticism is therefore warranted as to whether this type of south-pointing chariot, using a differential gear for the whole time, was used in practice to navigate over long distances. Conceivably, the south-pointing doll was fixed to the body of the chariot while it was travelling in straight lines, and coupled to the differential only when the chariot was turning. The charioteer could have operated a control to do this just before and after making each turn, or maybe shouted commands to someone inside the chariot who connected and disconnected the doll and the differential. This could have been done without stopping the chariot. If turns were brief and rare, this would have greatly reduced the pointing errors, since they would have accumulated only during the short periods when the doll and differential were connected. However, it raises the problem of how the chariot could have been kept travelling in straight lines with sufficient accuracy without using the pointing doll.

If the real purposes of the chariot and the accounts of it were amusement and impressing visiting foreigners, rather than actual long-distance navigation, then its inaccuracy might not have been important.  Considering that a large mechanical wagon or chariot would be obligated to travel on roads, the destination in question would typically not be in an unknown direction.   The fact that the sources cited above mention that the chariot was placed at the front of processions, its high level of mechanical complexity and fragility, and that it was 'reinvented' several times contribute to the conclusion that it was not used for navigation, as a truly practical and useful navigational tool would not be forgotten or left unused.

== Chariots without differential gears ==

Although the hypothesis that the south-pointing chariot used differential gears has gained wide acceptance, it should be recognized that functional south-pointing chariots without differential gears are possible. The ancient descriptions are often unclear, but they suggest that the Chinese implemented several different designs, at least some of which did not include differentials.

=== Mechanical designs ===

Some of the ancient descriptions suggest that some south-pointing chariots could move in only three ways: straight ahead, or turning left or right with a fixed radius of curvature. A third wheel might have been used to fix the turning radius. If the chariot was turning, the pointing doll was connected by gears to one or other of the two main road wheels (e.g. whichever was on the outside of the curve around which the chariot was moving) so the doll rotated at a fixed speed, relative to the rate of the chariot's movement, to compensate for the predetermined rate of turn. The doll turned in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was connected to it, so its rotation compensated for the chariot turning left or right. This design would have been simpler than using a differential gear.

The chariots of Yan Su and Wu Deren appear to have used this type of mechanism. (See descriptions quoted from the ''Song Shi'', above.) Apart from the presence of components in Wu Deren's vehicle to make it function as an [[odometer]], there were only minor differences between them. In each chariot, the two main road wheels were attached to vertical gear wheels. A large horizontal gear wheel was linked (possibly via intermediate gearing) to the pointing doll, and was positioned so a diameter almost spanned the space between the uppermost points of the vertical gear wheels. When the chariot was moving straight ahead, there was no connection between these gears, but when the chariot turned, a small gear wheel was lowered into contact with the horizontal gear and one of the vertical gears, thus linking the doll to one of the road wheels. Two small gear wheels were available, one to connect the horizontal gear to each of the vertical ones. Of course, they were not used simultaneously. The small gear wheels were raised and lowered by an arrangement of weights, pulleys and cords which were attached to the pole to which the horses that pulled the chariot were harnessed. When the horses moved to one side or the other, in order to turn the chariot, the pole moved and the cords lowered the appropriate small gear wheel into its working position. When the horses returned to walking straight ahead, the small gear wheel was raised out of contact with the main horizontal and vertical gears. Thus the system functioned automatically. The mirror-symmetry of the vertical gears being linked by the small gears to the horizontal gear at diametrically opposite points caused the horizontal gear to rotate in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was linked to it, thus rotating the pointing doll in opposite directions when the chariot turned left and right.

The description does not mention a third road wheel to fix the turning radius, but it is possible that such a wheel was present. No gears would have been attached to it, so perhaps the author of the description did not mention it because he did not realize that it was an important part of the mechanism. Putting such a wheel on the chariot and making it function properly would not have been difficult. It might have been attached to the pole to which the horses were harnessed. Stops would have been provided to limit the motions of the pole to left and right.

If a third road wheel was included, this type of south-pointing chariot could have worked quite accurately as a compass when used for short journeys under good conditions, but if used for long journeys it would have been subject to cumulative errors, like chariots using the differential mechanism.

If in fact there was no third road wheel, the chariot might have functioned as a compass if turns were always made so that one of the two wheels was stationary and only the other rotated, with the pointing doll connected to it by gears. The charioteer could have kept the stationary wheel from turning by controlling the horses appropriately. (A [[brake]] would have helped, but there is no mention of one in the description.) The radius of the curve around which the rotating wheel moved would have equalled the track-width of the chariot, and the gears turning the doll would have been chosen accordingly. This design would have worked as a compass for short journeys, but would have suffered from cumulative errors if used for long ones. Also, the chariot would have been slow and awkward to turn. This might not have mattered if turns were rarely executed.

The ''Song Shi'' description of the gears in Yan Su's chariot, and the numbers of teeth on them, suggests that it worked this way, without a third road wheel. The gear ratios would have been correct if the pointing doll was attached directly to the large horizontal gear wheel, and the track-width of the chariot equalled the diameter of the road wheels. Wu Deren's chariot also appears to have been designed to work this way. The width of the chariot, and therefore presumably the track-width, was greater than the diameter of the wheels. The gear ratios were appropriate for these dimensions.

The charioteer would have had to use great skill to ensure that the radius of each turn of the chariot was correct to make one of the wheels exactly stop rotating. Unless he did this correctly, the pointing doll would not have kept aiming to the south. He would have been able to adjust the direction in which it aimed by making turns that were more or less sharp. This would sometimes have given him opportunities to use the chariot dishonestly. If it was being demonstrated to spectators, for example, and was being driven around in front of them, making many turns, the charioteer, who would have known which way was south, would have been able to make the chariot ''appear to'' work extremely accurately as a compass for long periods. The spectators could have been shown the machinery, and would have seen that the charioteer could not manipulate the doll. They would presumably have been impressed by the apparent accuracy of the mechanism. It is possible that this type of chariot was sometimes constructed with the prime purpose of fraudulently impressing spectators. Possibly, people who built these chariots deceived their own employers with them, which could have gained them fame and fortune provided nobody tried using the chariots for real navigation.

Other mechanical designs for the south-pointing chariot are also possible, including ones that employ a device that is used today, the [[gyrocompass]]. However, there is no indication that the ancient Chinese knew of these.

=== Non-mechanical possibilities ===

Some south-pointing chariots may not have been purely mechanical devices. Someone riding inside the chariot may have used some non-mechanical method of determining the compass directions, and turned the doll on top of the chariot accordingly. There are several methods that could have been used, for example:

* By using a [[Compass#Magnetic compass|magnetic compass]]. The Chinese were using this for navigation by the 11th century CE, when south-pointing chariots were still being made and used.
* By using astronomical observations of the Sun and/or stars, e.g. the [[Pole Star]]. [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomical knowledge]] was extensive.
* By using local knowledge. The person in the chariot may have known the area or had a map or description of it.
* By observing the polarization of light from the sky. Vikings used [[birefringent]] crystals of [[Iceland spar]] to navigate across the Atlantic Ocean by this method at about the same time.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Iceland spar is found in China, as well as in Iceland and some other places. Insects such as bees can respond to sky polarization and use it to find their way home. Whether the Chinese used it is hypothetical, but it is certainly possible.
* By observing light that had been refracted by the Earth's atmosphere. This is one of the techniques that were used by Polynesian navigators to steer ships among Pacific islands. When the surface of the Earth, ocean or ground, is colder than the air above it, a dense layer of air is formed near the surface, which refracts light downward. The result is that light can go around the curvature of the Earth, allowing things to be seen at much greater distances than simple geometry would predict. The images are very distorted, but they can be recognized by skilled navigators. Certain other Polynesian techniques can also be used on land and may have been employed by the Chinese.

Unlike mechanisms that rely on the rotation of road wheels, most of these methods can be used at sea. This may account for the mention (see "Earliest sources" above) that a marine version of the south-pointing chariot existed.

These methods can work accurately over long distances, unlike the mechanical designs for the chariot.

==Necessity of non-mechanical orientation==
[[File:South-pointing chariot, China Court, Ibn Battuta Mall, Dubai.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A wooden two-wheeled cart supporting a series of wooden peg gears and a metal statue pointing with one outstretched hand.|South-pointing chariot replica at the [[Ibn Battuta Mall]], Dubai]]

Some non-mechanical method of finding the south must have been used when a mechanical south-pointing chariot was [[wiktionary:initialize|initialized]], aiming its pointer to the south at the start of a journey. Any of the methods mentioned above in "Non-mechanical possibilities" could have been used.

If any south-pointing chariot was really used for long-distance navigation, it must have relied (after initialization) on a non-mechanical direction-finding method. It might have been operated non-mechanically by someone riding in it, as outlined above. Alternatively, if it had a mechanical mechanism, it must have been frequently re-initialized non-mechanically to eliminate accumulated errors and uncertainties.

The only chariots that might not have needed non-mechanical methods of finding the south would have been those that were never used for long-distance navigation. If some chariots were used only for amusement or fraud, they could have worked purely mechanically. Even initialization could have been avoided by simply declaring some arbitrary direction to be "south".

== Where they can be seen ==
While none of the historic south-pointing chariots remain, full sized replicas can be found.

The History Museum in [[Beijing]], [[China]], holds a replica based on the mechanism of Yen Su (1027).
The [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], holds a replica based on the Lanchester mechanism of 1932.

Referred to as the "southern pointing man", two replicas can also be seen (and physically experimented with) at the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto, Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3331">'''Theodore Bar Konai''' ({{lang-syr|ܬܐܕܘܪܘܣ ܒܪ ܟܘܢܝ}}) was a distinguished Assyrian exegete and apologist of the [[Church of the East]] who seems to have flourished at the end of the eighth century.  His most famous work was a book of ''Scholia'' on the Old and New Testaments.

== Life and works ==
Bar Konai appears to have lived during the reign of [[Timothy I (Nestorian patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780–823), [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Patriarch of the Church of the East]], though some scholars have placed him a century later. [[Assemani]] identified him with a bishop named Theodore, the nephew of the patriarch [[Yohannan IV]] (900–5), who was appointed to the diocese of Lashom in [[Beth Garmaï (East Syrian Ecclesiastical Province)|Beth Garmaï]] in 893, and his dating was followed by Wright.&lt;ref&gt;Assemani, ''BO'', ii. 440 and iii. 1, 198, Wright, ''Syriac Literature'', 222&lt;/ref&gt;  Chabot and Baum and Winkler, however, both place him at the end of the eighth century.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, ''Syriac Language and Literature''; Baum and Winkler, ''Church of the East'', 63&lt;/ref&gt;  

Theodore was the author of a book of ''[[Scholia]]'' (''Kṯāḇā d-ʾeskoliyon'') on both the Old and New Testaments (edited between 1908 and 1912 by the celebrated scholar [[Addai Scher]]), believed to have been written circa 792.  The ''Scholia'' offer an apologetic presentation in nine chapters, similar to a catechism, of East Syrian Christianity, and contain a valuable overview, in a tenth and eleventh chapter, of heretical doctrines and non-Christian religions such as [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Manichaeism]] and [[Islam]], with which Theodore sharply disagreed.&lt;ref&gt;Baum and Winkler, ''Church of the East'', 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodore was also the author of an ecclesiastical history, a treatise against [[Monophysitism]], a treatise against the [[Arianism]], a colloquy between a pagan and a Christian, and a treatise on heresies.&lt;ref&gt;Chabot, ''Syriac Language and Literature''&lt;/ref&gt;  His ''Church History'' contains some interesting details of the lives of the Patriarchs of the Church of the East.&lt;ref&gt;Baum and Winkler, ''Church of the East'', 63&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thermal runaway''' occurs in situations where an increase in temperature changes the conditions in a way that causes a further increase in temperature, often leading to a destructive result. It is a kind of uncontrolled [[positive feedback]].

In other words, "thermal runaway" describes a process which is accelerated by increased temperature, in turn releasing energy that further increases temperature. In [[chemistry]] (and [[chemical engineering]]), it is associated with strongly [[exothermic]] reactions that are accelerated by temperature rise. In [[electrical engineering]], thermal runaway is typically associated with increased current flow and power dissipation, although exothermic chemical reactions can be of concern here too. Thermal runaway can occur in [[civil engineering]], notably when the heat released by large amounts of [[Concrete#Curing|curing]] [[concrete]] is not controlled.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}  In [[astrophysics]], runaway [[nuclear fusion]] reactions in stars can lead to [[nova]] and several types of [[supernova]] explosions, and also occur as a less dramatic event in the normal evolution of solar mass stars, the "[[helium flash]]".

There are also concerns regarding [[global warming]] that a global average increase of [[4 Degrees and Beyond International Climate Conference|3–4 degrees Celsius]] above the preindustrial baseline could lead to a [[Runaway climate change|further unchecked increase]] in surface temperatures. For example, releases of [[Atmospheric methane|methane]], a [[greenhouse gas]] more potent than [[carbon dioxide#In Earth's atmosphere|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], from [[wetland]]s, melting [[permafrost]] and continental margin seabed [[Methane clathrate|clathrate]] deposits could be subject to [[Clathrate gun hypothesis|positive feedback]].&lt;ref name="ccsp abrupt climate change"&gt;

==Chemical engineering==
Thermal runaway is also called '''thermal explosion''' in [[chemical engineering]], or '''runaway reaction''' in [[organic chemistry]]. It is a process by which an [[exothermic reaction]] goes out of control: the [[reaction rate]] increases due to an increase in temperature, causing a further increase in temperature and hence a further rapid increase in the reaction rate. This has contributed to industrial [[chemical accidents]], most notably the 1947 [[Texas City disaster]] from overheated [[ammonium nitrate]] in a ship's hold, and the 1976 explosion of [[dinitolmide|zoalene]], in a drier, at [[King's Lynn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icheme.org/communities/special-interest-groups/safety%20and%20loss%20prevention/resources/~/media/Documents/Subject%20Groups/Safety_Loss_Prevention/HSE%20Accident%20Reports/The%20Explosion%20at%20Dow%20Kings%20Lynn.pdf|title=The explosion at the Dow chemical factory, King's Lynn 27 June 1976|date=March 1977|publisher=Health &amp; Safety Executive|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank-Kamenetskii theory]] provides a simplified analytical model for thermal explosion. [[Chain reaction|Chain branching]] is an additional positive feedback mechanism which may also cause temperature to skyrocket because of rapidly increasing reaction rate.

Chemical reactions are either endothermic or exothermic, as expressed by their change in enthalpy. Many reactions are highly exothermic, so many industrial-scale and [[oil refinery]] processes have some level of risk of thermal runaway. These include [[hydrocracking#Hydrocracking|hydrocracking]], [[hydrogenation]], [[alkylation]] (S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2), [[oxidation]], [[metalation]] and [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]]. For example, oxidation of [[cyclohexane]] into [[cyclohexanol]] and [[cyclohexanone]] and [[ortho-xylene]] into [[phthalic anhydride]] have led to catastrophic explosions when reaction control failed.

Thermal runaway may result from unwanted exothermic side reaction(s) that begin at higher temperatures, following an initial accidental overheating of the reaction mixture. This scenario was behind the [[Seveso disaster]], where thermal runaway heated a reaction to temperatures such that in addition to the intended 2,4,5-[[trichlorophenol]], poisonous [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin]] was also produced, and was vented into the environment after the reactor's [[rupture disk]] burst.&lt;ref name = "Kletz"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kletz | first = Trevor A. | authorlink = Trevor Kletz | title = Learning from Accidents | edition = 3rd | publisher = Gulf Professional | date = 2001 | location = Oxford U.K. | pages = 103–9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zulmgUi5_aEC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#PPA73,M1 | isbn = 978-0-7506-4883-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal runaway is most often caused by failure of the [[chemical reactor|reactor]] vessel's [[Coolant|cooling]] system. Failure of the mixer can result in localized heating, which initiates thermal runaway. Similarly, in [[flow chemistry|flow reactors]], localized insufficient mixing causes hotspots to form, wherein thermal runaway conditions occur, which causes violent blowouts of reactor contents and catalysts. Incorrect equipment component installation is also a common cause. Many chemical production facilities are designed with high-volume emergency venting, a measure to limit the extent of injury and property damage when such accidents occur.

At large scale, it is unsafe to "charge all reagents and mix", as is done in laboratory scale. This is because the amount of reaction scales with the cube of the size of the vessel (V ∝ r³), but the heat transfer area scales with the square of the size (A ∝ r²), so that the heat production-to-area ratio scales with the size (V/A ∝ r). Consequently, reactions that easily cool fast enough in the laboratory can dangerously self-heat at ton scale. In 2007, this kind of erroneous procedure caused an explosion of a {{convert|2400|gal|liter}}-reactor used to [[Metalation|metalate]] [[methylcyclopentadiene]] with metallic [[sodium]], causing the loss of four lives and parts of the reactor being flung {{convert|400|ft|m}} away.&lt;ref name="Lowe2009"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowe|first1=Derek|authorlink1=Derek Lowe (chemist)|title=175 Times.

Some laboratory reactions must be run under extreme cooling, because they are very prone to hazardous thermal runaway. For example, in [[Swern oxidation]], the formation of  [[sulfonium]] chloride must be performed in a cooled system (–30&amp;nbsp;°C), because at [[room temperature]] the reaction undergoes explosive thermal runaway.&lt;ref name="Lowe2008" /&gt;

The [[UK Chemical Reaction Hazards Forum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crhf.org.uk UK Chemical Reaction Hazards Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; publishes analysis of previously-unreported [[chemical accidents]] to assist the education of the scientific and engineering community, with the aim of preventing similar occurrences elsewhere.  Almost 150 such reports are available to view as of January 2009.

==Microwave heating==
[[Microwave]]s are used for [[microwaving|heating]] of various materials in cooking and various industrial processes. The rate of heating of the material depends on the energy absorption, which depends on the [[dielectric constant]] of the material. The dependence of dielectric constant on temperature varies for different materials; some materials display significant increase with increasing temperature. This behavior, when the material gets exposed to microwaves, leads to selective local overheating, as the warmer areas are better able to accept further energy than the colder areas—potentially dangerous especially for thermal insulators, where the heat exchange between the hot spots and the rest of the material is slow. These materials are called ''thermal runaway materials''. This phenomenon occurs in some [[ceramic materials|ceramics]].

==Electrical engineering==
Some electronic components develop lower resistances or lower triggering voltages (for nonlinear resistances) as their internal temperature increases. If circuit conditions cause markedly increased current flow in these situations, increased power [[dissipation]] may raise the temperature further by [[Joule heating]]. A [[vicious circle]] or [[positive feedback]] effect of thermal runaway can cause failure, sometimes in a spectacular fashion (e.g. electrical explosion or fire). To prevent these hazards, well-designed electronic systems typically incorporate current limiting protection, such as thermal fuses, circuit breakers, or [[temperature coefficient|PTC]] current limiters.

To handle larger currents, circuit designers may connect multiple lower-capacity devices (e.g. transistors, diodes, or [[Metal Oxide varistor|MOVs]]) in [[parallel circuits|parallel]].  This technique can work well, but is susceptible to a phenomenon called '''current hogging''', in which the current is not shared equally across all devices.  Typically, one device may have a slightly lower resistance, and thus draws more current, heating it more than its sibling devices, causing its resistance to drop further.  The electrical load ends up funneling into a single device, which then rapidly fails.  Thus, an array of devices may end up no more robust than its weakest component.

The current-hogging effect can be reduced by carefully matching the characteristics of each paralleled device, or by using other design techniques to balance the electrical load. However, maintaining load balance under extreme conditions may not be straightforward.  Devices with an intrinsic [[positive temperature coefficient]] (PTC) of electrical resistance are less prone to current hogging, but thermal runaway can still occur because of poor heat sinking or other problems.

Many electronic circuits contain special provisions to prevent thermal runaway. This is most often seen in transistor biasing arrangements for high-power output stages. However, when equipment is used above its designed ambient temperature, thermal runaway can still occur in some cases. This occasionally causes equipment failures in hot environments, or when [[air cooling]] vents are blocked.

===Semiconductors===
[[Silicon]] shows a peculiar profile, in that its [[electrical resistance]] increases with temperature up to about 160&amp;nbsp;°C, then starts ''decreasing'', and drops further when the melting point is reached. This can lead to thermal runaway phenomena within internal regions of the [[semiconductor junction]]; the resistance decreases in the regions which become heated above this threshold, allowing more current to flow through the overheated regions, in turn causing yet more heating in comparison with the surrounding regions, which leads to further temperature increase and resistance decrease. This leads to the phenomenon of [[current crowding]] and formation of [[current filament]]s (similar to current hogging, but within a single device), and is one of the underlying causes of many [[Failure modes of electronics|semiconductor junction failures]].

===Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs)===
[[Leakage (semiconductors)|Leakage current]] increases significantly in [[bipolar transistor]]s (especially [[germanium]]-based bipolar transistors) as they increase in temperature. Depending on the design of the circuit, this increase in leakage current can increase the current flowing through a transistor and thus the [[power dissipation]], causing a further increase in collector-to-emitter leakage current. This is frequently seen in a [[push&amp;ndash;pull output|push&amp;ndash;pull]] stage of a [[electronic amplifier#Class AB amplifier|class AB amplifier]]. If the pull-up and pull-down transistors are [[bipolar transistor biasing|biased]] to have minimal [[crossover distortion]] at [[room temperature]], and the biasing is not temperature-compensated, then as the temperature rises both transistors will be increasingly biased on, causing current and power to further increase, and eventually destroying one or both devices.

One rule of thumb to avoid thermal runaway is to keep the [[Biasing|operating point]] of a BJT so that V&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1/2V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt;

Another practice is to mount a thermal feedback sensing transistor or other device on the heat sink, to control the crossover bias voltage. As the output transistors heat up, so does the thermal feedback transistor.  This in turn causes the thermal feedback transistor  to turn on at a slightly lower voltage,  reducing the crossover bias voltage, and so reducing the heat dissipated by the output transistors.

If multiple BJT transistors are connected in parallel (which is typical in high current applications), a current hogging problem can occur.  Special measures must be taken to control this characteristic vulnerability of BJTs.

In power transistors (which effectively consist of many small transistors in parallel), current hogging can occur between different parts of the transistor itself, with one part of the transistor becoming more hot than the others. This is called [[second breakdown]], and can result in destruction of the transistor even when the average junction temperature seems to be at a safe level.

===Power MOSFETs===
Power [[MOSFET]]s typically increase their on-resistance with temperature. Under some circumstances, power dissipated in this resistance causes more heating of the junction, which further increases the [[junction temperature]], in a [[positive feedback]] loop. As a consequence, power MOSFETs have stable and unstable regions of operation.&lt;ref name="powerMOSFETstability"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferrara|first1=A.|last2=Steeneken|first2=P. G.|last3=Boksteen|first3=B. K.|last4=Heringa|first4=A.|last5=Scholten|first5=A. J.|last6=Schmitz|first6= J.|last7=Hueting|first7=R. J. E.|title=Physics-based stability analysis of MOS transistors|journal=Solid-State Electronics|volume=113|date=November 2015|pages=28–34|doi=10.1016/j.sse.2015.05.010|bibcode=2015SSEle.113...28F}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increase of on-resistance with temperature helps balance current across multiple MOSFETs connected in parallel, so current hogging does not occur. If a MOSFET transistor produces more heat than the [[heatsink]] can dissipate, then thermal runaway can still destroy the transistors. This problem can be alleviated to a degree by lowering the [[thermal resistance]] between the transistor die and the heatsink. See also [[Thermal Design Power]].

===Metal oxide varistors (MOVs)===
Metal oxide [[varistor]]s typically develop lower resistance as they heat up.  If connected directly across an AC or DC power bus (a common usage for protection against [[electrical transient]]s), a MOV which has developed a lowered trigger voltage can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway, possibly culminating in a small explosion or fire.&lt;ref name=Brown2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Kenneth|title=Metal Oxide Varistor Degradation|journal=IAEI Magazine|date=March 2004|url=http://www.iaei.org/magazine/2004/03/metal-oxide-varistor-degradation/|accessdate=2011-03-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719023317/http://www.iaei.org/magazine/2004/03/metal-oxide-varistor-degradation/|archivedate=2011-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   To prevent this possibility, fault current is typically limited by a thermal fuse, circuit breaker, or other current limiting device.

===Tantalum capacitors===
[[Tantalum capacitor]]s are under some conditions prone to self-destruction by thermal runaway. The capacitor typically consists of a [[sintering|sintered]] [[tantalum]] sponge acting as the [[anode]], a [[manganese dioxide]] [[cathode]], and a [[dielectric]] layer of [[tantalum pentoxide]] created on the tantalum sponge surface by [[anodizing]].  It may happen that the tantalum oxide layer has weak spots that undergo [[dielectric breakdown]] during a [[voltage spike]]. The tantalum sponge then comes into direct contact with the manganese dioxide, and increased leakage current causes localized heating; usually, this drives an [[endothermic]] chemical reaction that produces [[manganese(III) oxide]] and regenerates ([[self-healing material|self-heals]]) the tantalum oxide dielectric layer.

However, if the energy dissipated at the failure point is high enough, a self-sustaining [[exothermic]] reaction can start, similar to the [[thermite]] reaction, with metallic tantalum as fuel and manganese dioxide as oxidizer.  This undesirable reaction will destroy the capacitor, producing [[smoke]] and possibly [[flame]].&lt;ref name= "Vasina2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Vasina|first1= P.|last2= Zednicek|first2= T.|last3= Sikula|first3= J.|last4= Pavelka|first4= J.|title= Failure modes of tantalum capacitors made by different technologies|journal= Microelectronics Reliability|volume= 42|issue= 6|year= 2002|pages= 849–854|doi= 10.1016/S0026-2714(02)00034-3|url= http://avx.com/docs/techinfo/failure.pdf|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100923075150/http://avx.com/docs/techinfo/failure.pdf|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, tantalum capacitors can be freely deployed in small-signal circuits, but application in high-power circuits must be carefully designed to avoid thermal runaway failures.

===Digital logic===
The [[Leakage (semiconductors)|leakage current]] of logic switching transistors increases with temperature. In rare instances, this may lead to thermal runaway in digital circuits. This is not a common problem, since leakage currents usually make up a small portion of overall power consumption, so the increase in power is fairly modest — for an [[Athlon 64]], the power dissipation increases by about 10% for every 30 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostcircuits.com/cpu/amd_venice/ LostCircuits, CPU Guide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For a device with a [[Thermal Design Power|TDP]] of 100 W, for thermal runaway to occur, the heat sink would have to have a [[Thermal conductivity#Related terms|thermal resistivity]] of over 3 K/W (kelvins per watt), which is about 6 times worse than a stock Athlon 64 heat sink. (A stock Athlon 64 heat sink is rated at 0.34 K/W, although the actual thermal resistance to the environment is somewhat higher, due to the thermal boundary between processor and heatsink, rising temperatures in the case, and other thermal resistances.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}) Regardless, an inadequate heat sink with a thermal resistance of over 0.5 to 1 K/W would result in the destruction of a 100 W device even without thermal runaway effects.

===Batteries===
When handled improperly,  or if manufactured defectively, some [[rechargeable batteries]] can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Sealed cells will sometimes explode violently if safety vents are overwhelmed or nonfunctional.&lt;ref name= "Finegan:2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ncomms7924| title = In-operando high-speed tomography of lithium-ion batteries during thermal runaway| journal = Nature Communications| volume = 6| pages = 6924| year = 2015| last1 = Finegan | first1 = D.

One of the possible solutions is in using safer and less reactive anode (lithium titanates) and cathode ([[lithium iron phosphate]]) materials — thereby avoiding the [[Cobalt#Batteries|cobalt]] electrodes in many lithium rechargeable cells — together with non-flammable electrolytes based on ionic liquids.

==Astrophysics==
Runaway thermonuclear reactions can occur in stars when [[nuclear fusion]] is ignited in conditions under which the pressure exerted by overlying layers of the star greatly exceeds [[Kinetic theory of gases|thermal pressure]], a situation that makes possible rapid increases in temperature. Such a scenario may arise in stars containing [[degenerate matter]], in which [[electron degeneracy pressure]] rather than normal thermal pressure does most of the work of supporting the star against gravity, and in stars undergoing implosion. In all cases, the imbalance arises prior to fusion ignition; otherwise, the fusion reactions would be naturally regulated to counteract temperature changes and stabilize the star. When thermal pressure is in equilibrium with overlying pressure, a star will respond to the increase in temperature and thermal pressure due to initiation of a new exothermic reaction by expanding and cooling. A runaway reaction is only possible when this response is inhibited.

===Helium flashes in red giant stars===
When stars in the 0.8–2.0 [[solar mass]] range exhaust the hydrogen in their cores and become [[red giant]]s, the helium accumulating in their cores reaches degeneracy before it ignites. When the degenerate core reaches a critical mass of about 0.45 solar masses, [[helium fusion]] is ignited and takes off in a runaway fashion, called the [[helium flash]], briefly increasing the star's energy production to a rate 100 billion times normal. About 6% of the core is quickly converted into carbon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~infocom/The%20Website/end.html The End Of The Sun]&lt;/ref&gt; While the release is sufficient to convert the core back into normal [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] after a few seconds, it does not disrupt the star,&lt;ref&gt;[https://astro.uni-bonn.de/~nlanger/siu_web/ssescript/new/chapter9.pdf Chapter 9: Post-main sequence evolution through helium burning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DearbornLattanzio2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dearborn|first1=D.

The star then contracts, leaving the red giant phase and continuing its evolution into a [[Stellar evolution#Mid-sized stars|stable helium-burning phase]].

===Novae===
A [[nova]] results from runaway [[nuclear fusion#Astrophysical reaction chains|hydrogen fusion]] (via the [[CNO cycle#Hot CNO cycles|CNO cycle]]) in the outer layer of a carbon-oxygen [[white dwarf]] star. If a white dwarf has a companion star from which it can [[Accretion disc|accrete gas]], the material will accumulate in a surface layer made degenerate by the dwarf's intense gravity. Under the right conditions, a sufficiently thick layer of hydrogen is eventually heated to a temperature of 20 million K, igniting runaway fusion. The surface layer is blasted off the white dwarf, increasing luminosity by a factor on the order of 50,000. The white dwarf and companion remain intact, however, so the process can repeat.&lt;ref name = "Fermi_2010"&gt;{{cite web

===X-ray bursts===
Analogous to the process leading to novae, degenerate matter can also accumulate on the surface of a [[neutron star]] that is accreting gas from a close companion. If a sufficiently thick layer of hydrogen accumulates, ignition of runaway hydrogen fusion can then lead to an [[X-ray burster|X-ray burst]]. As with novae, such bursts tend to repeat and may also be triggered by helium or even carbon fusion.&lt;ref name = "Cumming"&gt;{{cite journal

===Type Ia supernovae===
A [[type Ia supernova]] results from [[Carbon detonation|runaway carbon fusion]] in the core of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf star. If a white dwarf, which is composed almost entirely of degenerate matter, can gain mass from a companion, the increasing temperature and density of material in its core will ignite [[Carbon-burning process|carbon fusion]] if the star's mass approaches the [[Chandrasekhar limit]]. This leads to an explosion that completely disrupts the star. Luminosity increases by a factor of greater than 5 billion. One way to gain the additional mass would be by [[Type Ia supernova#Single degenerate progenitors|accreting gas]] from a [[giant star]] (or even [[main sequence]]) companion.&lt;ref name="DildayHowell2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dilday|first1=B.|last2=Howell|first2=D.

===Pair-instability supernovae===
A [[pair-instability supernova]] is believed to result from runaway [[Oxygen-burning process|oxygen fusion]] in the core of a [[Hypergiant|massive]], 130–250 solar mass, low to moderate [[metallicity]] star.&lt;ref name="Gal-YamMazzali2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gal-Yam|first1=A.|last2= Mazzali|first2= P.|last3=Ofek|first3=E.

As the core heats further, the gamma rays eventually begin to pass the energy threshold needed for collision-induced decay into [[electron]]-[[positron]] pairs, a process called [[pair production]]. This causes a drop in the pressure within the core, leading it to contract and heat further, causing more pair production, a further pressure drop, and so on. The core starts to undergo [[gravitational collapse]]. At some point this ignites runaway oxygen fusion, releasing enough energy to obliterate the star. These explosions are rare, perhaps about one per 100,000 supernovae.

===Comparison to nonrunaway supernovae===
Not all supernovae are triggered by runaway nuclear fusion. [[Type Ib and Ic supernovae|Type Ib, Ic]] and [[type II supernova]]e also undergo core collapse, but because they have exhausted their supply of atomic nuclei capable of undergoing exothermic fusion reactions, they collapse all the way into [[neutron star]]s, or in the higher-mass cases, [[stellar black hole]]s, powering explosions by the release of [[gravitational potential energy]] (largely via release of [[neutrino]]s). It is the absence of runaway fusion reactions that allows such supernovae to leave behind [[Compact star|compact stellar remnants]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4165">In [[metrology]] and the fields that it serves (such as [[manufacturing]], [[machining]], and [[engineering]]), '''total indicator reading''' ('''TIR'''), also known by the newer name '''full indicator movement''' ('''FIM'''), is the difference between the maximum and minimum [[measurement]]s, that is, readings of an [[indicator (distance amplifying instrument)|indicator]], on the [[plane (geometry)|planar]], [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]], or contoured surface of a part,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engineersedge.com/engineering/Engineering_Terms_Glossary/T/total_indicator_reading_tir_4448.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729021818/http://www.engineersedge.com/engineering/Engineering_Terms_Glossary/T/total_indicator_reading_tir_4448.htm |archivedate=2012-07-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; showing its amount of deviation from flatness, roundness (circularity), cylindricity, concentricity with other cylindrical features, or similar conditions. The indicator traditionally would be a dial indicator; today dial-type and digital indicators coexist. 

The earliest expansion of "TIR" was '''total indicated run-out''' and concerned cylindrical or tapered (conical) parts, where "[[run-out]]" (noun) refers to any imperfection of form that causes a [[rotation around a fixed axis|rotating]] part such as a shaft to "run out" (verb), that is, to not rotate with perfect smoothness. These conditions include being out-of-round (that is, lacking sufficient [[roundness (object)|roundness]]); eccentricity (that is, lacking sufficient [[concentric|concentricity]]); or being bent axially (regardless of whether the surfaces are perfectly round and concentric at every cross-sectional point). The purpose of emphasizing the "total" in TIR was to duly maintain the distinction between per-side differences and both-sides-considered differences, which requires perennial conscious attention in [[lathe (metal)|lathe]] work. For example, all depths of cut in lathe work must account for whether they apply to the radius (that is, per side) or to the diameter (that is, total). Similarly, in shaft-straightening operations, where calibrated amounts of bending force are applied laterally to the shaft, the "total" emphasis corresponds to a bend of half that magnitude. If a shaft has 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm TIR, it is "out of straightness" by half that total, i.e., 0.05&amp;nbsp;mm. 

Today TIR in its more inclusive expansion, "total indicator reading", concerns all kinds of features, from round to flat to contoured. One example of how the "total" emphasis can apply to flat surfaces as well as round ones is in the topic of [[surface roughness]], where both peaks and valleys count toward an assessment of the magnitude of roughness. Statistical methods such as [[root mean square]] (RMS) duly address the "total" idea in this respect.

The newer name "full indicator movement" (FIM) was coined to emphasize the requirement of zero [[Indicator (distance amplifying instrument)#Dial test indicator tips|cosine error]]. Whereas dial test indicators will give a foreshortened reading if their tips are on an angle to the surface being measured (cosine error), a drawing callout of FIM is defined as referring to the distance traveled by the extremity of the tip—not by the lesser amount that its lever-like action moves the needle. Thus a FIM requirement is only met when the measured part itself is truly in geometric compliance—not merely when the needle sweeps a certain arc of the dial. 

The "TIR" abbreviation is still more widely known and used than "FIM". This is natural given that (1) many part designs that are still being manufactured are made from decades-old [[engineering drawing]]s, which still say "TIR"; and (2) generations of machinists were trained with the term "TIR", whereas only recent curriculum uses "FIM".

[[File:United-Nations-University-03.jpg|thumb|United Nations University in Tokyo]]

The {{nihongo|'''United Nations University'''|国際連合大学|Kokusai rengō daigaku}} ('''UNU'''), established in 1973, is the academic and research arm of the [[United Nations]]. It is headquartered in [[Shibuya, Tokyo]], [[Japan]], with diplomatic status as a UN institution. Since 2010, UNU has been authorized by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to grant degrees. It also provides a bridge between the UN and the international academic, policy-making and private sector communities.

==Organisation and leadership==

The university is headed by a rector, who holds the rank of [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations]].

To date, there have been six Rectors at UNU.  
The current Rector, since March 2013, is Dr. [[David M. Malone]] of Canada.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The University was established in 1973 and formally began its activities in 1976 following the signature of the permanent headquarters agreement between the United Nations and Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/showDetails.aspx?objid=0800000280102344|title=UNTC|work=un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of the United Nations University was set in motion by Secretary-General [[U Thant]] in 1969.&lt;ref name="UN_ARES2573XXIV"&gt;{{UN document |docid=A-RES-2573(XXIV) |type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=24 |resolution_number=2573 |accessdate=2008-05-02|date=13 December 1969|title=International university}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UNU Institutes and Vice-Rectorate===
Over the years, several Institutes of UNU were created to help with the research initiatives of the United Nations. Most notably, in 2007, a vice-rectorate was established in Bonn (UNU-ViE), Germany, as a way of strengthening UNU's presence in Europe. UNU-ViE is dedicated to developing knowledge-based sustainable solutions for global problems and is, therefore, an active organizer of international science policy dialogues for sustainability.

===UNU as a degree-granting institution===

In December 2009, the [[UN General Assembly]] amended the UNU Charter to make it possible for UNU to "grant and confer master's degrees and doctorates, diplomas, certificates and other academic distinctions under conditions laid down for that purpose in the statutes by the Council."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unu.edu/about/charter#ART-1|title=UNU Charter|work=unu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, UNU-ISP announced its intention to seek accreditation from the National Institution for Academic Degrees and University Evaluation (NIAD-UE) which is the Japanese accreditation agency for higher education institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isp.unu.edu/about/jobs/2013/programme_administrative_consultant.html|title=Jobs {{!}} UNU Institute for Sustainability and Peace|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|accessdate=14 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922084737/http://isp.unu.edu/about/jobs/2013/programme_administrative_consultant.html|archivedate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNU-IAS was formally accredited in April 2015, making it the first international organization to be recognized by the NIAD-UE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unu.edu/news/news/unu-ias-accredited-by-the-national-institution-for-academic-degrees-and-university-evaluation-japan.html|title=UNU-IAS Accredited by the National Institution for Academic Degrees and University Evaluation|last=|first=|date=May 1, 2015|website=unu.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
The university has several campuses spread over five continents. Its headquarters are located at the UNU Centre in Tokyo, Japan.

==Research ==

The role of the UN University is to generate new knowledge, educate, enhance individual and institutional capacities, and disseminate its useful information to relevant audiences. Within the scope of these five thematic clusters, the UN University undertakes:

*Cross-cultural, interdisciplinary research (utilizing innovative, science-based techniques and methodologies to study important global processes and elaborate forward-looking solutions) and targeted foresight and policy studies (aimed at developing policy-relevant prescriptions and evaluating the feasibility and comparative advantages of each option);
*Postgraduate-level education (degree-oriented programmes and specialized training focused on problems and solutions rather than academic disciplines) and capacity development activities (aimed at helping developing and transitional countries to enhance local potential to address current problems/confront emergent challenges); and
*Knowledge sharing and transfer (to deliver relevant information about UN University research, current scientific advances and best practices, in a timely manner and in a usable form, to those who most need it and can best utilize it).

As prescribed in the United Nations University Strategic Plan 2011–2014, the 26 major topics of focus of the UN University's academic work fall within five interdependent thematic clusters:
#Peace, Security and Human Rights; Peace building and peace keeping, Conflict resolution and human security, Fostering dialogue among civilizations, religions and cultures, Human rights and ethics, Gender equality and mainstreaming,
#Human and Socio-economic Development and Good Governance; Growth and economic development, Alleviating poverty and inequalities, Good governance, Enhancing educational capacities, Fair trade, Processes and consequences of regional integration and cooperation, Leadership, management and entrepreneurship.
#Global Health, Population and Sustainable Livelihoods; Global health, Safe water and sanitation, Food and nutrition for human and social development, Combating HIV/AIDS, Population changes and migration.
#Global Change and Sustainable Development; Climate change — adaptation and mitigation, Ecological health and biodiversity, New risk and vulnerabilities, Sustainable land, agriculture and natural resources management, Green economy.
#Science, Technology, Innovation and Society; Science, technology and innovation, Sustainable energy futures, Sustainable urban futures, Sustainable housing and construction.

Collectively, these thematic clusters define the programme space within which the UN University undertakes its academic activities. Some key perspectives (such as gender equality, human rights and sustainability) pervade all aspects of the UN University's work.

'''Urban acupuncture''' is a [[environmentalism|socio-environmental]] theory that combines contemporary [[urban design]] with [[Traditional Chinese medicine|traditional Chinese]] [[acupuncture]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://adamparsonsdesignthesis.blogspot.com/2010/12/urban-acupuncture-marco-casagrande.html Parsons, Adam.

"Urban Acupuncture: Marco Casagrande."] University of Portsmouth.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sps|date=October 2016|certain=y}} using small-scale interventions to transform the larger urban context. Sites are selected through analysis of aggregate social, economic and ecological factors, and are developed through a dialogue between designers and the community. Just as the practice of acupuncture is aimed at relieving stress in the human body, the goal of urban acupuncture is to relieve stress in the [[built environment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ "Urban Acupuncture,"] ''Urban Applications,'' 2013. {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416051344/http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ |date=16 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sps|date=October 2016|certain=y}} In Taipei, there was an urban acupuncture workshop that aimed to "produce small-scale but socially catalytic interventions" into the city's fabric.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.dk/books?id=QbY7on6asu8C&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=urban+acupuncture+casagrande&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gd8ozw3OLd&amp;sig=D0C58eXMpJuOZzsLtp6XftKyqnA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mZxxUcu4C8HRtQbIsICoDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=urban%20acupuncture%20casagrande&amp;f=false Ruin Academy – Casagrande Lab.] In ''Architectural Theories of the Environment: Posthuman Territory,'' ed.

==Urban organism==
Originally coined by Barcelonan architect and urbanist, Manuel de Sola Morales,&lt;ref&gt;Frampton, Kenneth. Megaform as urban landscape. University of Michigan, A. Alfred Taubman College of Architecture+ Urban Planning, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=October 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;i Rubió, Manuel de Solà-Morales. Progettare città. Vol. 23.

Structure Fabric and Topography Conference, Nanjing University. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|sure=y|reason=Conference paper.|date=October 2016}} the term has been recently championed and developed further by Finnish architect and [[Social theory|social theorist]] [[Marco Casagrande]], this school of thought eschews massive urban renewal projects in favour of a more localised and community approach that, in an era of constrained budgets and limited resources, could democratically and cheaply offer a respite to urban dwellers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/urban-acupuncture-community-localised-renewal-projects Could cities' problems be solved by urban acupuncture?] – ''Leon Kaye, The Guardian'' 21 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=This is an op-ed written by a proponent of the subject.|date=October 2016}}
Casagrande views cities as complex energy organisms in which different overlapping layers of energy flows are determining the actions of the citizens as well as the development of the city. By mixing environmentalism and urban design Casagrande is developing methods of punctual manipulation of the urban energy flows in order to create an ecologically sustainable urban development towards the so-called 3rd Generation City (postindustrial city). The theory is developed in the [[Tamkang University]] of [[Taiwan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbandevelopmentbergen.blogspot.com/2010/04/interview-witm-m-casagrande-on-urban.html INTERVIEW WITH M. CASAGRANDE ON URBAN ACUPUNTURE]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} – ''Laurits Elkjær, Bergen School of Architecture'' 4/2010{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sps|date=October 2016|certain=y}} and at independent multidisciplinary research center [[Ruin Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://issuu.com/ruin-academy/docs/anarchist_gardener_issue_two_hk_special Anarchist Gardener Issue Two HK special 安那其建築園丁港深建築雙城雙年展特別版] – ''Nikita Wu, Ruin Academy'' 2/2012&lt;/ref&gt; With focus on environmentalism and urban design, Casagrande defines urban acupuncture as a design tool where punctual manipulations contribute to creating sustainable urban development, such as the community gardens and urban farms in Taipei.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projekter.aau.dk/projekter/files/65227327/ParticipativeDesign_Planning.pdf PARTICIPATIVE DESIGN &amp; PLANNING IN CONTEMPORARY URBAN PROJECTS] – '' Christina Rasmussen, Urban Planning &amp; Management, Aalborg University'' 6/2012&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=This is an undergraduate thesis.|date=December 2016}}

Casagrande describes urban acupuncture as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''[a] cross-over architectural manipulation of the collective sensuous intellect of a city. City is viewed as multi-dimensional sensitive energy-organism, a living environment. Urban acupuncture aims into a touch with this nature.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ "Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal,"] – Kyle Miller, MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Sensitivity to understand the energy flows of the collective [[Qi|chi]] beneath the visual city and reacting on the hot-spots of this chi. Architecture is in the position to produce the acupuncture needles for the urban chi.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epifanio.eu/nr14/eng/ruin_academy.html "Ruin Academy,"] – Marco Casagrande, Epifanio 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''A weed will root into the smallest crack in the asphalt and eventually break the city.  Urban acupuncture is the weed and the acupuncture point is the crack. The possibility of the impact is total, connecting human nature as part of nature.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Casagrande utilized the tenets of acupuncture: treat the points of blockage and let relief ripple throughout the body. More immediate and sensitive to community needs than traditional institutional forms of large scale urban renewal interventions would not only respond to localized needs, but do so with a knowledge of how citywide systems operated and converged at that single node. Release pressure at strategic points, release pressure for the whole city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Urban Applications'' 2013 {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416051344/http://urbanapplications.org/urban-acupuncture/ |date=16 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participatory planning==

In theory, urban acupuncture opens the door for uncontrolled creativity and freedom.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Citizens are enabled to join the creative [[participatory planning]] process, feel free to use city space for any purpose and develop their environment according to their will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stadsbyggnad.lth.se/fileadmin/stadsbyggnad/images/_1_Sudes_Book/_1_B5_webversion1.pdf Compost City] – Guoda Bardauskaite'' p. 30-31, Sustainable Urban Design Journal 1 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This "new" post-industrialized city Casagrande, dubbed the Third Generation City, is driven by people who are concerned about the destruction that the modern machine is causing to nature including human nature. They want sustainable co-operation with the rest of the nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbaninteraction.net/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Raune Frankjær, Rethink: Urban Interaction'' 10/2012&lt;/ref&gt; In a larger context, a site of urban acupuncture can be viewed as communicating to the city outside like a natural sign of life in a city programmed to subsume it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/37444/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] – ''Kelly Chan, Architizer'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban acupuncture bears some similarities to the [[New Urbanism|new urbanist]] concept of Tactical Urbanism. The idea focuses on local resources rather than capital-intensive municipal programs and promotes the idea of citizens installing and caring for interventions. These small changes, proponents claim, will boost community morale and catalyze revitalization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newurbannetwork.com/news-opinion/links/15079/urban-acupuncture-touted-cash-strapped-cities 'Urban acupuncture' touted for cash-strapped cities] – ''David West, New Urban Network'' 7/2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2016}} Boiled down to a simple statement, "urban acupuncture" means focusing on small, subtle, bottom-up interventions that harness and direct community energy in positive ways to heal urban blight and improve the cityscape. It is meant as an alternative to large, top-down, mega-interventions that typically require heavy investments of municipal funds (which many cities at the moment simply don't have) and the navigation of yards of bureaucratic [[red tape]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thisoldstreet.wordpress.com/2011/08/06/londons-urban-acupuncture-the-urban-physic-garden/ London’s Urban Acupuncture: The Urban Physic Garden] – '' This Old Street'' 8/2011&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=December 2016}} The micro-scale interventions targeted by "urban acupuncture" appeal to both citizen-activists and cash-strapped communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/links/15079/urban-acupuncture-touted-cash-strapped-cities 'Urban acupuncture' touted for cash-strapped cities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415165829/http://bettercities.net/news-opinion/links/15079/urban-acupuncture-touted-cash-strapped-cities |date=15 April 2012 }} – '' David West, Better Cities &amp; Towns'' 7/2011&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mexico]] urban acupuncture converts temporary housing, like sheds in the slums, to simple homes that allow for "add-ons" later, based on need and affordability. This strategy transforms the slum zone, without relocating families that have been living together for generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goodtimes.my/index.php/Community/volunteer-group-builds-free-orang-asli-homes.html Star architect leaves it all to build homes for the poor] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112060231/http://www.goodtimes.my/index.php/Community/volunteer-group-builds-free-orang-asli-homes.html |date=12 January 2012 }} – ''  Yam Phui Yee, Good Times – The Conscience of the Nation''&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa Urban Acupuncture is viewed as a possibility to provide a means for people to unlock their creativity and the advantages thereof, for example, innovation and entrepreneurship concentrating on parts of the city, i.e. communities thereby providing opportunities to those areas which do not have the sort of infrastructure that is found in mainstream cities.  This approach can provide a more realistic and less costly method for city planners and citizens as an effective way to make minor improvements in the communities in order to achieve a greater good in the cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fluxtrends.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=51&amp;Itemid=111&amp;limitstart=5 Urban Acupuncture] – ''  Mariam Mahomed, Urban Spaces

[[Jaime Lerner]], the former mayor of [[Curitiba]], suggests urban acupuncture as the future solution for contemporary urban issues; by focusing on very narrow pressure points in cities, we{{Who|date=July 2012}} can initiate positive ripple effects for the greater society. Urban acupuncture reclaims the ownership of land to the public and emphasizes the importance of community development through small interventions in design of cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.davidson.edu/anthro16/space/urban-acupuncture/ Urban Acupuncture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425152838/http://forum.davidson.edu/anthro16/space/urban-acupuncture/ |date=25 April 2012 }} – '' Understanding Space'' 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It involves pinpointed interventions that can be accomplished quickly to release energy and create a positive ripple effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brazilmax.com/news.cfm/tborigem/pl_south/id/10 Curitiba: Jaime Lerner’s Urban Acupuncture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204151632/http://www.brazilmax.com/news.cfm/tborigem/pl_south/id/10 |date=4 December 2011 }} – ''Bill Hinchberger, Brazilmax'' 2/2006&lt;/ref&gt;
He described in 2007:&lt;br /&gt;
"I believe that some medicinal "magic" can and should be applied to cities, as many are sick and some nearly terminal. As with the medicine needed in the interaction between doctor and patient, in urban planning it is also necessary to make the city react; to poke an area in such a way that it is able to help heal, improve, and create positive chain reactions. It is indispensable in revitalizing interventions to make the organism work in a different way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal] – Kyle Miller'' MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Taiwanese architect and academic Ti-Nan Chi is looking with micro urbanism at the vulnerable and insignificant side of contemporary cities around the world identified as micro-zones, points for recovery in which micro-projects have been carefully proposed to involve the public on different levels, aiming to resolve conflicts among property owners, villagers, and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=16364 Chi Ti-Nan develops a project to preserve Hong Kong coastline Tai Long Sai Wan] – '' World Architecture News'' 4/2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A loosely affiliated team of architects [[Wang Shu]], Marco Casagrande, [[Hsieh Ying-chun]] and [[Roan Ching-yueh]] (sometimes called WEAK! Architecture) are describing the unofficial Instant City, or Instant Taipei, as architecture that uses the Official City as a ''growing platform and energy source, where to attach itself like a parasite and from where to leach the electricity and water… [The Instant City's] illegal urban farms or night markets is so widespread and deep rooted in the Taiwanese culture and cityscape that we could almost speak of another city on top of the "official" Taipei, a parallel city – or a para-city.'' WEAK! is calling urban acupuncture depending on the context as Illegal Architecture, Orchid Architecture, the People's Architecture, or Weak Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/18012/peoples-architecture-in-taipei/ Illegal Architecture in Taipei] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120526043446/http://www.architizer.com/en_us/blog/dyn/18012/peoples-architecture-in-taipei/ |date=26 May 2012 }} – Kelsey Campbell-Dollaghan'' Architizer 3/2011&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of urban acupuncture suggests that scores of small-scale, less costly and localized projects is what cities need in order to recover and renew themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/urban-design/marco-casagrande-cicada-installation-taipei.html Could Cities Benefit from Small-Scale, Local "Urban Acupuncture" Projects Like This?] – Kimberly Mok'' Treehugger 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award==
The winner of the Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award (DBUAA) Cape Town 2012 is the neighbourhood project "Mothers Unite" demonstrating the power of urban acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mothersunite.org.za/2012/04/deutsche-bank-urban-age-award-19-april-2012/ Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award – 19 April 2012] – '' Mothers Unite'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Mothers Unite was founded in 2007 and provides a safe haven from the gangsterism, drugs and violence that are part and parcel of street and home life in the area. Built with donated shipping containers, the village is made up of a library, kitchen, office, sheltered area, playground and food garden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.db.com/csr/en/social_investments/deutsche_bank_urban_age_award_2012_winner_announced.html Deutsche Bank Urban Age Award 2012 – winner announced] – '' Deutsche Bank Corporate Social Responsibility'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Edgar Pieterse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Durable urban change is often about carefully targeted micro interventions that can change the energies and dynamics of a surrounding neighbourhood. When one engages with the physical manifestations that the tenacity, blood, sweat, and tears of the protagonists of Mothers Unite and Masiphumelele Library (another of the eight finalists) have created, the power of urban acupuncture is apparent. These projects serve as reminders that through vision, commitment over the long haul, and principle-based partnerships, just about any problem can be confronted and addressed.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capetown2014.co.za/2012/04/mothers-unite-urban-acupuncture-for-an-urban-age/ Mothers Unite: Urban acupuncture for an urban age] – '' Cape Town 2014 Live Design. Transform Life.'' 4/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Urban ecological restoration==
In ecological restoration of industrial cities Urban Acupuncture can take form as spontaneous and often illegal urban farms and [[Community gardening|community gardens]] punctuating the more mechanical city and tuning it towards a more sustainable co-existence with the natural environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.p2pfoundation.net/the-community-gardens-of-taipei/2010/12/04 Taipei Organic Acupuncture] – ''Marco Casagrande, P2P Foundation'' 12/2010&lt;/ref&gt; 
Urban Acupuncture areas can receive, treat and [[recycle]] the waste from the surrounding city acting as eco-valleys within the urban fabric. In River Urbanism the Urban Acupuncture areas can include underground [[stormwater]] reservoirs and act as [[flood]] relief for the surrounding city as a [[sponge]] and they can act as [[Biofilter|biological filters]] purifying water originated from polluted rivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecture.org/internal/content/download.asp?wdoc=urbanecopuncture-marcocasagrande.doc Urban Ecopuncture] – ''Marco Casagrande, World Architecture'' 10/2011&lt;/ref&gt; Urban acupuncture is a point by point manipulation of the urban energy to create a sustainable town or city, which Marco Casagrande has dubbed '3rd Generation Cities'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainablecities.dk/en/city-projects/cases/amsterdam-urban-acupuncture-creates-new-life-in-the-suburbs Amsterdam: Urban Acupuncture creates new life in the suburbs] – ''Danish Architecture Centre, Sustainable Cities'' 6/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

American artist [[Gordon Matta-Clark]] is credited with developing a system for identifying pockets of disrepair in the built environment—the first step in the framework of urban acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kylemillermsis.wordpress.com/2011/09/25/urban-acupuncture-revivifying-our-cities-through-targeted-renewal/ Urban Acupuncture: Revivifying Our Cities Through Targeted Renewal] – Kyle Miller'' MSIS 9/2011&lt;/ref&gt; 
Artist [[Miru Kim]] explores industrial [[ruin]]s and structures making her look at the city as one living organism. She claims to feel not only the skin of the city, but also to penetrate the inner layers of its intestines and veins, which swarm with minuscule life forms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/zh-tw/miru_kim_s_underground_art.html Miru Kim] – ''TED Talks'' 2/2009&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to a public [[environmental art]] work, Cicada, Casagrande explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Cicada is urban acupuncture for Taipei city penetrating the hard surfaces of industrial laziness in order to reach the original ground and get in touch with the collective Chi, the local knowledge that binds the people of [[Taipei basin]] with nature. The [[Cocoon (silk)|cocoon]] of Cicada is an accidental mediator between the modern man and reality. There is no other reality than nature.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/urban-design/marco-casagrande-cicada-installation-taipei.html Could Cities Benefit from Small-Scale, Local "Urban Acupuncture" Projects Like This?] – Kimberley Mok ''Treehugeer'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Environmental art as urban acupuncture is an artistic way of injecting a healthy dose of natural elements and human scale into the mechanized urban grid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archetcetera.blogspot.com/2012/01/signs-of-life.html Signs of Life] – Phyllis Richardson ''Archetcetera'' 1/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11505">'''VIBOT''' is an abbreviation of '''VIsion and RoBOTics'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vibot.org vibot.org - Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a 2-year European Masters in Computer Vision and Robotics course, conducted by [[Heriot-Watt University]] in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]], [[Universitat de Girona]] in [[Girona]], [[Spain]] and [[Université de Bourgogne]] in [[Le Creusot]], [[France]]. It started in 2006 as part of the [[European Commission]]'s [[Erasmus Mundus]] programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/mundus/index_en.html EUROPA - Education and Training - Erasmus Mundus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
VIBOT is a two-year Master Program in [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[Visual perception|Vision]] and [[Robotics]] accredited in 2006 by the European Commission in the framework of the Erasmus Mundus program, a co-operation and mobility program of the [[European Commission]] in the field of higher education in order to promote the [[European Union]] as a centre of excellence in learning around the [[world]]. It is the only Erasmus Mundus Master Program in 3D Vision and Robotics among the 103 Erasmus Mundus Master Programs accredited since 2004 in all disciplines.

VIBOT Master students have courses in the three collaborating universities: [[Université de Bourgogne]] in France, [[University of Girona]] in [[Spain]] and Heriot-Watt University in Scotland. They spend one [[semester]] in each of these three universities and the fourth semester in training. The admission of the brightest students from all over the world, some of whom were already working in companies, allows to create an [[international]] and mobile educated workforce of high level for the [[European community]].

VIBOT Master courses are given by faculties and visiting [[professors]] who belong to well-known [[research]] [[laboratories]] that have long-standing reputation for high quality research. The courses start from a comprehensive coverage of the prerequisites in the field of [[digital imaging]] ([[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]]) and basic [[image processing]] algorithms, and end up with research level teaching of their applications in the fields of [[robotics]], [[medical imaging]] and 3D vision systems. The close location of research laboratories on campus allows the faculties to involve students at all stages of research and offer them many opportunities to participate in state-of-the-art research work.

== Course Structure ==
The Masters Course is divided in four semesters, each having a value of 30 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]. All the courses are taught in English in the three partner universities. However, the order in which the students attend the universities has changed from the first generation to the second generation of the program. Irrespective of the generation, the last semester consists of a training period, which is an introduction to research carried out in one of the laboratories of the (wider) network.

=== First Generation ===

The so-called VIBOT first generation comprises the first five promotions of the program (promotions starting from 2006 to 2010). For this primer generation, the mobility order was the following: Scotland, Spain, France.

The first semester was carried out on the campus of [[Heriot Watt University]] in [[Scotland]] ([[UK]]). Its constituting modules covered an introduction to [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] and [[image processing]], as well as the key related area of [[artificial intelligence]]. These subjects were supplemented by local culture studies, and training for drafting documents in [[English language|English]].

The second semester took place in the [[Universitat de Girona]], in [[Catalunya]], [[Spain]]. Topics were currently highly relevant to scientific and industrial communities like the [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]] strategies, [[object recognition]] and description, the acquisition of 3D information, and the application of hardware for specific real time applications.  This semester covered: fundamentals on [[robotics]], [[autonomous robots]], scene segmentation and interpretation, [[visual perception]], [[Real-time computer graphics|real time]] [[image processing]] and study of the local culture.

The third semester was hosted by the university Center Condorcet in [[Le Creusot]], which is a delocalization of the [[Université de Bourgogne]]. The subjects covered were: [[pattern recognition]], [[image analysis]] (including the problems of multiresolution analysis and deconvolution). These modules were supplemented by the study of various types of image modalities such as: [[infra-red]], [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]], radio-isotopique and [[X-ray]] imagery, with an emphasis on their application to medical imagery. A module of local culture was also provided.

=== Second Generation ===

The VIBOT second generation starts in 2011 with the sixth promotion and is expected to last at least for five promotions. The main changes consist in the mobility order. Unlike the first generation, the second generation spends the semesters in the following order: France, Spain, Scotland. The overall objective is to start from science fundamentals and low-level image processing, then to introduce mid-level image processing, computer vision and applications in medical imaging, and to end with robotics and high-level integration so that the main methods and algorithms in the state-of-art of computer vision and robotics (through both a theoretical and applied point of view) are covered.

The organization of the semesters is as follows. An induction week is organized starting the first semester, in September, in [[Le Creusot]] during which the enrolled students are informed about the program, the assessment and the rules. The induction week also permits new students to meet second-year students or former VIBOT students. The first semester is held at [[University of Burgundy|Universite de Bougogne]] (UB) where the modules of Fundamentals on [[image processing]], sensors and acquisition, as well as mathematics and computer science are taught. The second semester is hosted at [[Universitat de Girona]] (UdG) with subjects as improvements on [[image processing]] and [[pattern recognition]], complements on [[computer vision]] and [[medical imaging]] and an introduction to [[robotics]]. The third semester is developed at [[Heriot-Watt University]] (HWU), and more advanced courses related to methods and high-level processing for real-time implementation and integration of vision and robotics are taught.

=== Training Period ===

The training period in research corresponds to the fourth semester of the course. The laboratories belonging to the consortium of universities are the laboratories where the students are initially expected to do the training period. These laboratories are: Vision, Image and Signal Processing ([http://visp.eps.hw.ac.uk/ VISP]) and Ocean Systems Laboratory ([http://osl.eps.hw.ac.uk/ OSL]) in Heriot-Watt University, the laboratory for Computer Vision and Robotics ([http://vicorob.udg.es/ VICOROB]) at the Universitat de Girona, and the Laboratory of Electronics, Informatics and Image ([http://le2i.cnrs.fr/ Le2i]) in Le Creusot.
However, the training period can also take place in any validated host laboratory or research center throughout the [[world]]. The laboratories concerned belong to the worldwide research networks which the participating institutes have jointly developed through the international-class research activities of their laboratories. Some of the laboratories where some previous students have done their research fourth semester are: Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH (Offenbach am Main, Germany),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honda Research Institute Europe|url=http://www.honda-ri.org/intern/Welcome_to_HRI-EU/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erasmus University Rotterdam (Rotterdam, Netherlands),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam|url=http://www.bigr.nl/website/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory for Analysis and Architecture of Systems LAAS-CNRS (Toulouse, France),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LAAS - Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Group|url=http://www.laas.fr/2-29949-RIA.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control INRIA (Grenoble, France),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lear Group - INRIA|url=http://lear.inrialpes.fr/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toshiba Medical Visualization Systems Europe (Edinburgh, UK),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toshiba Medical Visualization Systems Europe|url=http://www.tmvse.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information and Communication Technologies (Queensland, Australia),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information and Communication Technologies|url=http://research.ict.csiro.au/}}&lt;/ref&gt; SeeByte,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SeeByte|url=http://www.seebyte.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's National Research Center for Aeronautics and Space DLR (Wessling, Germany),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DLR - Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics|url=http://www.dlr.de/rm/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-3757/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Computational Vision and Robotics Laboratory CVRL (Crete,Greece),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CVRL: Computational Vision and Robotics Laboratory|url=http://ics.forth.gr/cvrl/contact-info.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fraunhofer Institutes (Germany) among others.

== VIBOT Days ==
VIBOT Day 2008 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amcomputersystems.com/vibot/ Official VIBOT Day 2008 Website]&lt;/ref&gt; was held in Le Creusot, France, on September 9, 2008. It was a one-day event during which participants learned more about the VIBOT Master program and the collaborative opportunities that were offered to companies wishing to sponsor the program. Participants also attended several oral and poster presentations given by newly graduated students that raised their awareness of the academic excellence of the students as well as the high level of the courses taught in the program. Moreover, the one-day event also gave an opportunity for participants to meet and discuss with past, current and future international students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7588">{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Wagner's gene network model''' is a computational model of artificial gene networks, which explicitly modeled the developmental and evolutionary process of [[genetic regulatory networks]]. A [[population]] with multiple organisms can be created and evolved from generation to generation. It was first developed by [[Andreas Wagner]] in 1996&lt;ref name="Wagner1996" /&gt; and has been investigated by other groups to study the evolution of [[gene network]]s, [[gene expression]], [[mutational robustness|robustness]], [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]] and [[epistasis]].&lt;ref name="Bergman2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Azevedo2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HuertaSanchez2007"/&gt;

== Assumptions ==
The model and its variants have a number of simplifying assumptions.  Three of them are listing below.
#The organisms are modeled as gene regulatory networks.  The models assume that gene expression is regulated exclusively at the transcriptional level;
#The product of a gene can regulate the expression of (be a regulator of) that source gene or other genes.  The models assume that a gene can only produce one active transcriptional regulator;
#The effects of one regulator are independent of effects of other regulators on the same target gene.

== Genotype ==
[[File:WagnerModel.png|thumb|Network representation of the regulatory interactions between four genes (G1, G2, G3 and G4). Activations and repressions are denoted by arrows and bars, respectively. Numbers indicate the relative interaction strengths. Interaction matrix &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; on the right representing the network on the left.]]
The model represents individuals as networks of interacting transcriptional regulators. Each individual expresses &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; genes encoding transcription factors. The product of each gene can regulate the expression level of itself and/or the other genes through [[cis-regulatory element]]s.  The interactions among genes constitute a gene network that is represented by a &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; × &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; regulatory matrix &lt;math&gt;(R)&lt;/math&gt; in the model.  The elements in matrix ''R'' represent the interaction strength.  Positive values within the matrix represent the activation of the target gene, while negative ones represent repression. Matrix elements with value 0 indicate the absence of interactions between two genes.

== Phenotype==
[[File:GeneExpressionInWagnerModel.png|thumb|An example of how the gene expression pattern modeled in Wagner model and its variants. G1, G2, G3 and G4 represent genes in the network. Filled box means the gene expression of that particular gene is on; open box means off. Gene expression patterns are represented by the state vector &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; whose elements &lt;math&gt;s_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; describe the expression states of gene &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The phenotype of each individual is modeled as the [[gene expression]] pattern at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. It is represented by a state vector &lt;math&gt;S(t)&lt;/math&gt; in this model.

&lt;math&gt;S(t)\ :=\ (S_1(t),\  . . .,\ S_N(t))&lt;/math&gt;
 
whose elements &lt;math&gt;s_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the expression states of gene ''i'' at time ''t''.  In the original Wagner model,

&lt;math&gt;S(t)&lt;/math&gt; ∈ &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\} &lt;/math&gt;

where 1 represents the gene is expressed while -1 implies the gene is not expressed.  The expression pattern can only be ON or OFF.  The continuous expression pattern between -1 (or 0) and 1 is also implemented in some other variants.&lt;ref name="Bergman2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Azevedo2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HuertaSanchez2007"/&gt;

== Development ==
The development process is modeled as the development of gene expression states.  The gene expression pattern &lt;math&gt;S(0)&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t=0&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the initial expression state.  The interactions among genes change the expression states during the development process.  This process is modeled by the following differential equations

&lt;math&gt;S_l(t+&lt;/math&gt;τ&lt;math&gt;) = &lt;/math&gt;σ &lt;math&gt;[\sum_{j=1}^N w_{ij}S_j(t)]&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt; σ &lt;math&gt;[h_i](t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_l(t+&lt;/math&gt;τ) represents the expression state of &lt;math&gt;G_l&lt;/math&gt; at time t+τ.  It is determined by a filter function σ&lt;math&gt;(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;h_i(t)&lt;/math&gt; represents the weighted sum of regulatory effects (&lt;math&gt;w_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;) of all genes on gene &lt;math&gt;G_i&lt;/math&gt; at time t.  In the original Wagner model, the filter function is a step function

σ&lt;math&gt;(x)=-1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x&lt;0;\ 1 &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0;\ 0 &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;

In other variants, the filter function is implemented as a sigmoidal function

σ&lt;math&gt;(x)=2/(1+e^{-ax})-1&lt;/math&gt;

In this way, the expression states will acquire a continuous distribution.  The gene expression will reach the final state if it reaches a stable pattern.

== Evolution ==
Evolutionary simulations are performed by reproduction-mutation-selection life cycle. Populations are fixed at size N and they will not go extinct. Non-overlapping generations are employed. In a typical evolutionary simulation, a single random viable individual that can produce a stable gene expression pattern is chosen as the founder. Cloned individuals are generated to create a population of N identical individuals. According to the asexual or sexual reproductive mode, offsprings are produced by randomly choosing (with replacement) parent individual(s) from current generation. Mutations can be acquired with probability μ and survive with probability equal to their fitness. This process is repeated until N individuals are produced that go on to found the following generation.

== Fitness ==
Fitness in this model is the probability that an individual survives to reproduce. In the simplest implementation of the model, developmentally stable genotypes survive (i.e. their fitness is 1) and developmentally unstable ones do not (i.e. their fitness is 0).

== Mutation ==
Mutations are modeled as the changes in [[gene regulation]], i.e., the changes of the elements in the regulatory matrix &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;.

== Reproduction ==
Both [[Sexual reproduction|sexual]] and [[asexual reproduction]]s are implemented.  Asexual reproduction is implemented as producing the offspring's [[genome]] (the gene network) by directly copying the parent's genome.  Sexual reproduction is implemented as the recombination of the two parents' genomes.

== Selection ==
An organism is considered viable if it reaches a stable gene expression pattern.  An organism with oscillated expression pattern is discarded and cannot enter the next generation.

Waldsee is America's oldest and largest immersion program for German language and culture. Over 1,550 young people participate yearly, coming together from all 50 of the United States and many foreign countries. In 2009 Waldsee was recognized as a U.S. National Center of Excellence for its cultural immersion program by the [[American Association of Teachers of German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aatg.org/programs/kinder-lernen-deutsch/189-kld-centers-of-excellence.html|title= New Center of Excellence in 2010|work=AATG KLD Centers of Excellence|accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Waldsee was the brainchild of professors Gerald Haukebo and Erhard Friedrichsmeyer at [[Concordia College, Moorhead|Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, USA]]. In 1961, the first two-week session of "Camp Waldsee" was held for 72 villagers.&lt;ref name="clv history"/&gt; The tuition was $75 and Erhard Friedrichsmeyer served as the dean of the program. Over the next decade, Waldsee began to grow in both the number of villagers attending as well as the number of weeks that the camp ran each summer. Waldsee's first "adventure program," Alpenland, was held at the Rising Wolf Ranch in [[Montana]], where villagers learned German while enjoying [[hiking|hikes]] in the mountains and [[horseback riding]]. 

In 1970, the [[high school]] credit program was launched, providing a four-week intensive instruction for high-school students equivalent to a full year's instruction in a traditional classroom. In 1973, Waldsee launched its first [[study abroad]] program, offering [[backpacking (travel)|backpacking]] and [[biking]] trips to [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]]. 

In the early 1980s, the permanent Waldsee site began to be built on Turtle River Lake, near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. 

In 2010, Waldsee celebrated its 50th anniversary. Events in 2010 included a major "Waldseefest" on July 24, 2010 and six different alumni weekends.

===World connections===
Waldsee enjoys a continuing [[sister city]] relationship with the German town of [[Bad Waldsee]], located in [[Baden-Württemberg]]. 

[[Horst Köhler]], the former President of the Federal Republic of Germany, was the official patron (Schirmherr) of Waldsee, as was his predecessor, [[Roman Herzog]]. Many German Ambassadors and other dignitaries have visited Waldsee. World leaders have endorsed Concordia Language Villages, notably former [[United Nations]] Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]], and former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], whose daughter Chelsea attended Waldsee for six summers.&lt;ref name="clv history"&gt;{{cite web

Waldsee offers one-, two- and four-week living and learning experiences in German language and culture for beginning through advanced 7- to 18-year-olds.

The German Language Village has been cited as a model of innovative education by a wide variety of educators and organizations, including the [[American Association of Teachers of German]] and the [[Goethe Institut]] Inter Nationes. It has also been featured in such media as [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]], [[Basler Zeitung]], [[ZDF]] German Television, [[CBS]] American Television, ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[German Life Magazine]]'', ''Oskar's'' and ''[[Deutschland (magazine)|Deutschland]]'' magazines, and been the subject of award-winning journalistic essays and various doctoral dissertations. 

===Daily life===
[[Image:Waldsee, Bemidji Panorama.JPG|thumb|right|Waldsee ''Marktplatz.'' The ''Gasthof'' dining hall can be seen at left, and the ''Bahnhof'' is in the background.]]
Waldsee offers programs that serve youth (7–18 years old), families of all ages, and adults; one of the high school credit programs travels abroad. During the academic year, Waldsee also hosts school groups.

The Waldsee credit program offers traditional instruction as well as credit programs in environmental learning and German (''die Gruene Welle'') and in [[medieval history]] and [[theater]] (''der Maerchenwald''). In the German apprentice program, starting in 2010, participants work half-time in the village stores, in gardening and green roof maintenance, music, the arts and the kitchen and bakery, and also learn half-time in intensive German language groups. 

Waldsee's non-credit programs include programs that focus on producing [[FM radio]] broadcasts at a live [[radio station]], learning about [[Swiss culture]] in tandem with the nearby French village [[Lac du Bois (camp)|Lac du Bois]] and the Italian village [[Lago del Bosco]], learning about the [[Natural environment|environment]], performing [[improvisational theater]] based on medieval lore and legends, and exploring German grammar in depth. 

Villagers can choose different activities every day. Waldsee offers a wide range of European sports from [[soccer]] to [[fencing]]. There is also traditional American [[Summer camp|camp]] activities such as [[human swimming|swimming]] and [[canoeing]] at the beach. Waldsee also has a few giant [[chess]] sets and a giant Mühle ([[Nine Men's Morris]]) game.

===Locations ===
Waldsee is currently located at a culturally authentic site on Turtle River Lake north of [[Bemidji]], [[Minnesota]]. Since its founding in 1961, Waldsee has also leased numerous sites across Minnesota. It also offers a credit program that travels abroad.

====Permanent site====
[[Image:WaldseeBemidjiMarktplatzAtDusk.jpg|thumb|left|Waldsee ''Marktplatz'' near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. The culturally authentic ''Gasthof'' dining hall can be seen in the background.]]
The Waldsee permanent site, which opened in 1982, is located at {{Coord|47|33|33.78|N|94|44|19.36|W|type:landmark_region:US}} near [[Bemidji]], Minnesota on Turtle River Lake, along with six other [[Concordia Language Village]] sites. In all, Waldsee can house up to 240 people (typically, there are about 170 students and 40-50 counselors).

The site is styled after a typical German village and is centered around a ''Marktplatz'', which is the center of most activity at ''Waldsee''. The ''Bahnhof'' is a large building near the entrance of the village that houses class and administrative rooms. The ''Gasthof'' is another building that serves as a dining hall and houses most indoor activities. There is an artists' colony, named ''[[Worpswede]]'', which has about 6 small cabins and houses the arts and crafts activities. 

The first building on the campsite was "''Haus Katja''", which is a log cabin that was built by a group of villagers. The first professionally built building was the ''[[Schwarzwaldhaus]]'' or [[Black Forest house]], which can house 64 people in four units as well as several more in separate sleeping rooms on the first floor. A twin to the ''Schwarzwaldhaus'' is the ''Max Kade Haus'', which was built a few years after the SWH and is very similar in design. 

Two new medium-sized residences have been recently built. The ''Erich Markel Haus'' (Oberammergau and Unterammergau) has room for 24 people in two units. The ''Robert Bosch Haus'' houses the healthcare center (''Heilbronn'') and another residence (''Stuttgart''). The newest building at ''Waldsee'' is the ''BioHaus'', the first certified [[passive house]] in North America. The ''BioHaus'' is an integrated environmental learning center and residence for up to 30 people, including a small apartment upstairs. There is also ''Café Einbeck'', where villagers can sample candy, soft drinks, and other foods from Europe or listen to a jukebox playing German-language music. ''Waldsee'' also has a ''Laden'' at which villagers can make purchases using ''Euro''.

====Leased sites====
Waldsee has also operated at leased sites since its founding in 1961. Waldsee has been located in [[Alexandria, Minnesota]], [[Vergas, Minnesota]], Menagha, Minnesota, Hackensack, Minnesota, and [[Cass Lake, Minnesota]]. Waldsee departed from Vergas in the summer of 2006 to make room for [[Al-Wāḥa]], the [[Arabic]] language village, which was founded that year.

====Abroad====
Waldsee travels abroad to [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]] with smaller groups of high school students studying German in their summer for credit.


==BioHaus (Passive House)==
In 2006, Waldsee opened the ''BioHaus'', the first certified [[passive house]] in North America, on its permanent site near [[Bemidji, Minnesota]]. It is built to the German passive house standard for energy conservation and renewable energy use, and uses 85% less energy than a house built to the Minnesota Energy Code.&lt;ref name="greenline"/&gt;

The construction of the BioHaus was funded in part through a grant from the [[Deutsche Bundesstiftung Umwelt]] (DBU), which is the world's largest foundation dedicated to environmental practice, education and construction. The Waldsee passive house marked the first time that DBU had awarded such a grant in North America.&lt;ref name="standards"&gt;{{cite news

In 2007, the BioHaus won the [[Minnesota Environmental Initiative Award]] in the category of Air Quality and Climate Protection. It was a 2007 Nominee for the [[World Clean Energy Award]] in the construction category.&lt;ref name="initiative"&gt;{{cite web

===Cultural importance===
The fixtures are German, and the house helps to introduce students to the "new Germany" as well as preparing them for responsible and ecological citizenship in the global community, the mission of Concordia Language Villages. The modern house itself pays homage to the [[Bauhaus]] school of 1920s architecture, and floor-to-ceiling windows recall the symbolic transparency built into [[West German]] government buildings post-[[World War II]].&lt;ref name="germanyinfo"&gt;{{cite web

===Design===
The house was built using eight critical design strategies: Passive Solar Design, Superinsulation, Advanced Window Technology, Airtightness, Ventilation, Space Heating, Efficient Lighting and Electrical appliances.&lt;ref name="greenline"/&gt;

The building replaces 100% outside air; no air is recirculated through the system. Two underground tubes exchange outside and inside air eight feet beneath the ground, passively warming or cooling the air to match the temperature of the ground (~55°F year round). The house transfers heat between the outgoing air and the incoming air before it reaches the rooms, resulting in a difference of less than 10°F between the incoming fresh air and the desired room temperature, even in the midst of Minnesotan winter.&lt;ref name="greenline"/&gt;

Water in the house is heated by [[solar hot water|solar thermal heat panels]] on the roof, rather than [[photovoltaic]] solar cells, which would convert solar energy directly to electricity.&lt;ref name="germanyinfo"/&gt;

Low-growing plants make up the building's green roof, reducing rainwater runoff and adding another layer of insulation to the building.&lt;ref name="germanyinfo"/&gt; Additionally, the western half of the lower level of the structure is tucked into the slope, enabling natural insulation based on the soil.&lt;ref name="initiative"/&gt;
