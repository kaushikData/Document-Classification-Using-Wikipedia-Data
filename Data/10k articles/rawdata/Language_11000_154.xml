The [[Geography|geographical]] term '''alfoz''' (plural ''alfoces'') was used in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] during the [[Middle Ages]] to describe the [[rural]] territory, including villages and localities, belonging to a corresponding town, or ''villa'' in Spanish (not to be confused with [[villa]], a type of residence). The villa and its alfoz, under the authority of the town government (''concejo''), constituted what was called a ''Comunidad de Villa y Tierra'', an [[autonomous]] political division within the kingdom. At the center of this community, the villa (or sometimes a city) comprised an [[urban area]] and often a castle and a fortified wall.

By the 12th century, the alfoces had fiscal, judicial and military functions.&lt;ref name="O'Callaghan2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Callaghan|first=Joseph F.|title=A History of Medieval Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVMJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA269|accessdate=December 4, 2014|date=April 15, 2013|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-6871-1|pages=269–271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, they lent themselves to the communal use of land for [[Silvopasture|silvopastoral]] agriculture; however, in the year 1100, the Spanish kings began to allocate portions of land to the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[nobility]], an act that undermined the very purpose of the alfoz.

The alfoz and its villa formed what would later be known as a [[municipality]]. The word alfoz comes from the [[Arabic]] ''al-hawz'', meaning "rural district",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Estepa Díez|first= Carlos|date= 1984|title= El alfoz castellano en los siglos IX al XII.|url= http://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/ELEM/article/view/ELEM8484120305A|language= Spanish|journal= En la España Medieval|publisher= Universidad Complutense de Madrid|issue= 4|issn= 0214-3038|page= 310|accessdate=December 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remains to this day an element of many place names in Spanish geography.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3177">A '''back-to-back user agent''' ('''B2BUA''') is a logical network element in [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) applications.&lt;ref&gt;RFC 3261, ''SIP: Session Initiation Protocol'', IETF, The Internet Society (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; SIP is a signaling protocol to manage multimedia [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) telephone calls. A back-to-back user agent operates between both end points of a phone call or communications session and divides the communication channel into two call legs and mediates all SIP signaling between both ends of the call, from call establishment to termination. As all control messages for each call flow through the B2BUA, a service provider may implement value-added features available during the call.

In the originating call leg the B2BUA acts as a ''user agent server'' (UAS) and processes the request as a ''user agent client'' (UAC) to the destination end, handling the signaling between end points back-to-back. A B2BUA maintains complete state for the calls it handles. Each side of a B2BUA operates as a standard SIP network element as specified in RFC 3261. 

A B2BUA may provide the following functions:
* call management (billing, automatic call disconnection, call transfer, etc.)
* network interworking (perhaps with protocol adaptation)
* hiding of network internals (private addresses, network topology, etc.)

Often, B2BUAs are implemented in media gateways to also bridge the media streams for full control over the session.

A [[signaling gateway]], part of a [[session border controller]], is an example of a B2BUA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5183">The first [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] translation by Mirza Farrukh and Feliks Zaręba was the [[Gospel of Matthew]], published in 1842 in London by [[Basel]] Missionary Society. The complete New Testament was fully translated and published in 1878 in London and the Old Testament in 1891. 

In 1982, the [[Institute for Bible Translation]] in Stockholm, Sweden released a new modern Azerbaijani language translation of the New Testament made by [[Mirza Khazar]], which is currently used in Azerbaijan. [[Mirza Khazar]]'s translation being reprinted five times in subsequent years.  The most recent New Testament edition, the sixth, is of 1998, while the Old Testament's one is of 2004. Mirza Khazar's translation of The Old Testament was completed in 1984, but not printed. Azeris in Iran follow a slightly different translation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

'''Bledri ap Cydifor''' (fl. 1116-30) was a Welsh chieftain. According to a record in the 'Cartulary of Carmarthen Priory' he was a ‘Latemeri’ (interpreter), which would suggest that he (having the skills to negotiate with invaders) was a notable Welshman in the area. During the Welsh revolt of 1116 it is believed that the Normans entrusted him with the castle of Robert Courtemayn, near [[Carmarthen]]. His descendants were also prominent landowners, and may be traced to Cil Sant, Pwll Dyfach, Motlysgwm, and Picton.

'''Cape Breton Island''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|île du Cap-Breton}}—formerly ''{{lang|fr|[[Île-Royale (New France)|Île Royale]]}}''; {{lang-gd|Ceap Breatainn}} or ''{{lang|gd|Eilean Cheap Breatainn}}''; {{lang-mic|Unama'kik}}; or simply ''Cape Breton'') is an island on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast of North America and part of the province of [[Nova Scotia]], Canada.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The {{convert|10311|km2|abbr=on}} island accounts for 18.7% of Nova Scotia's total area. Although the island is physically separated from the [[Nova Scotia peninsula]] by the [[Strait of Canso]], the {{convert|1385|m|ft|abbr=on}} long rock-fill [[Canso Causeway]] connects it to mainland Nova Scotia. The island is east-northeast of the mainland with its northern and western [[coast]]s fronting on the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]; its western coast also forms the eastern limits of the [[Northumberland Strait]]. The eastern and southern coasts front the Atlantic Ocean; its eastern coast also forms the western limits of the [[Cabot Strait]]. Its landmass slopes upward from south to north, culminating in the [[highland]]s of its northern cape. One of the world's larger salt water lakes, {{lang|fr|[[Bras d'Or Lake|Bras d'Or]]}} ("Arm of Gold" in French), dominates the island's centre.

The island is divided into four of Nova Scotia's eighteen counties: [[Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness]], [[Richmond County, Nova Scotia|Richmond]], and [[Victoria County, Nova Scotia|Victoria]]. Their total population at the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 census]] numbered 132,010 "Cape Bretoners"; this is approximately 15% of the provincial population.&lt;ref name="Table from Statistics Canada"/&gt; Cape Breton Island has experienced a decline in population of approximately 2.9% since the 2011 census. Approximately 75% of the island's population is in the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]] (CBRM) which includes all of Cape Breton County and is often referred to as [[Industrial Cape Breton]], given the history of coal mining and steel manufacturing in this area, which was Nova Scotia's industrial heartland throughout the 20th century.

The island has five [[Indian reserve|reserves]] of the [[Mi'kmaq|Mi'kmaq Nation]]: {{lang|mic|[[Eskasoni First Nation|Eskasoni]]}}, {{lang|mic|[[Membertou First Nation|Membertou]]}}, {{lang|mic|[[Wagmatcook First Nation|Wagmatcook]]}}, {{lang|mic|[[Whycocomagh 2|Waycobah]]}}, and [[Potlotek First Nation|{{lang|mic|Potlotek|nocat=y}}/Chapel Island]]. {{lang|mic|Eskasoni}} is the largest in both population and land area.

==Toponymy==
Its name may derive from {{lang|fr|[[Capbreton]]}} near [[Bayonne]], or more probably from ''[[Cape (geography)|Cape]]'' and the word ''{{lang|fr|Breton}}'', the French [[demonym]] for ''{{lang|fr|[[Brittany|Bretagne]]}}'', the French historical region.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cape Breton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Cape Breton Island's first residents were likely [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic maritime natives]], ancestors of the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]]. These peoples and their progeny inhabited the island (known as Unama'ki) for several thousand years and continue to live there to this day. Their traditional lifestyle centred around hunting and fishing because of the unfavourable agricultural conditions of their maritime home. This ocean-centric lifestyle did, however, make them among the first indigenous peoples to discover European explorers and sailors fishing in the St Lawrence Estuary. [[John Cabot]] reportedly visited the island in 1497.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; However, European histories and maps of the period are of too poor quality to be sure whether Cabot first visited [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] or Cape Breton Island. This discovery is commemorated by Cape Breton's [[Cabot Trail]], and by the Cabot's Landing Historic Site &amp; Provincial Park, near the village of [[Dingwall, Nova Scotia|Dingwall]].

The local Mi'kmaq peoples began trading with European fishermen when the fishermen began landing in their territories as early as the 1520s. In about 1521–22, the Portuguese under [[João Álvares Fagundes]] established a fishing colony on the island. As many as two hundred settlers lived in a village, the name of which is not known, located according to some historians at what is now [[Ingonish, Nova Scotia|Ingonish]] on the island's northeastern peninsula. These fishermen traded with the local population but did not maintain a permanent settlement. This Portuguese colony's fate is unknown, but it is mentioned as late as 1570.&lt;ref&gt;de Souza, Francisco; ''Tratado das Ilhas Novas'', 1570&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Anglo-French War (1627–29)|Anglo-French War]] of 1627 to 1629, under [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], the [[David Kirke|Kirkes]] took [[Quebec City]]; [[James Stewart, 4th Lord Ochiltree|Sir James Stewart]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; of Killeith, [[Lord Ochiltree]] planted a colony on Unama'ki at [[Baleine, Nova Scotia]]; and Alexander's son, [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling]], established the first incarnation of [[Nova Scotia|"New Scotland"]] at [[Port Royal, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]]. These claims, and larger European ideals of native conquest were the first time the island was incorporated as European territory, though it would be several decades later that treaties would actually be signed (no copies of these treaties exist).

These Scottish triumphs, which left [[Cape Sable Island|Cape Sable]] as the only major French holding in North America, did not last.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Sarty and Doug Knight. Saint John Fortifications: 1630–1956. New Brunswick Military Heritage Series. 2003. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles I's haste to make peace with France on the terms most beneficial to him meant the new North American gains would be bargained away in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1632)]],&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, 2010. p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=August 2014}} which established which European power had claim over the territories, but did not in fact establish that Europeans had any claim to begin with.

The French quickly defeated the Scots at [[Baleine, Nova Scotia|Baleine]], and established the first European settlements on Île Royale: present day [[Englishtown, Nova Scotia|Englishtown]] (1629) and [[St. Peter's, Nova Scotia|St. Peter's]] (1630). These settlements lasted only one generation, until [[Nicolas Denys]] left in 1659. The island did not have any European settlers for another fifty years before those communities along with [[Louisbourg (community)|Louisbourg]] were re-established in 1713, after which point European settlement was permanently established on the island.

===Île Royale===

Known as "''Île Royale''" ("Royal Island") to the French, the island also saw active settlement by France. After the French ceded their claims to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and the [[Acadia]]n mainland to the British by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, the French relocated the population of [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|Plaisance, Newfoundland]], to [[Île-Royale (New France)|Île Royale]] and the French [[garrison]] was established in the central eastern part at [[Fort Sainte Anne (Nova Scotia)|Sainte Anne]]. As the harbour at Sainte Anne experienced icing problems, it was decided to build a much larger fortification at [[Fortress of Louisbourg|Louisbourg]] to improve defences at the entrance to the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and to defend France's fishing fleet on the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/cmh/en/page_103.asp ''Canadian Military Heritage'']; vol.1, Chapter 6: Soldiers of the Atlantic Seaboard, p103. Government of Canada, 2004-04-26&lt;/ref&gt; The French also built the [[Louisbourg Lighthouse]] in 1734, the first lighthouse in Canada and one of the first in North America. In addition to Cape Breton Island, the French colony of Île Royale also included [[Prince Edward Island|Île Saint-Jean]], today called [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Les Îles-de-la-Madeleine]].

[[File:Destruction du vaisseau le Prudent et capture du Bienfaisant a Louisbourg 1758.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)]]]]

==== French and Indian War ====
Louisbourg itself was one of the most important commercial and military centres in New France.  Louisbourg was captured by New Englanders&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; with British naval assistance in [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|1745]]&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; and by British forces in 1758. The French population of Île Royale was deported to France after each siege. While French settlers returned to their homes in Île Royale after the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] was signed in 1748,&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/acadian/timeline.html |title=The Acadians – Timeline |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2004 |website=The Acadians |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; the fortress was demolished after the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|second siege]]. Île Royale remained formally part of [[New France]] until it was ceded to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] by the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763. It was then merged with the adjacent, British colony of Nova Scotia (present day peninsular Nova Scotia and [[New Brunswick]]). Acadians who had been [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelled]] from [[Nova Scotia]] and Île Royale were permitted to settle in Cape Breton beginning in 1764,&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; and established communities in north-western Cape Breton, near [[Cheticamp]], and southern Cape Breton, on and near [[Isle Madame]].

Some of the first British-sanctioned settlers on the island following the [[Seven Years' War]] were Irish, although upon settlement they merged with local French communities to form a culture rich in music and tradition.  From 1763 to 1784, the island was administratively part of the colony of [[Nova Scotia]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; and was governed from [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]].

The first permanently settled [[Scottish people|Scottish]] community on Cape Breton Island was [[Judique, Nova Scotia|Judique]], settled in 1775 by Michael Mor MacDonald. He spent his first winter using his upside-down boat for shelter, which is reflected in the architecture of the village's Community Centre. He composed a song about the area called "O 's àlainn an t-àite", or "O, Fair is the Place."

==== American Revolution ====

During the [[American Revolution]], on 1 November 1776, [[John Paul Jones]] – the father of the American Navy – set sail in command of ''Alfred'' to free hundreds of American prisoners working in the area's coal mines. Although winter conditions prevented the freeing of the prisoners, the mission did result in the capture of ''Mellish'', a vessel carrying a vital supply of winter clothing intended for [[John Burgoyne]]'s troops in Canada.

Major [[Timothy Hierlihy]] and his regiment on board HMS ''Hope'' worked in and protected from privateer attacks on the coal mines at Sydney Cape Breton.&lt;ref&gt;C. J. MacGillivray. Timothy Hierlihy and his Times: The story of the Founder of Antigonish, Nova Scotia. Nova Scotia Historical Society., p.40&lt;/ref&gt; Sydney Cape Breton provided a vital supply of coal for Halifax throughout the war.  The British began developing the mining site at Sydney Mines in 1777. On 14 May 1778, Major Hierlihy arrived at Cape Breton.  While there, Hierlihy reported that he "beat off many piratical attacks, killed some and took other prisoners."&lt;ref&gt;C. J. MacGillivray. Timothy Hierlihy and his Times: The story of the Founder of Antigonish, N.S.

Eyre Massey to General Sir Henry Clinton. 13 June 1778]&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years into the war there was also [[Naval battle off Cape Breton|a naval engagement]] between French ships and a British convoy off Sydney, Nova Scotia, near Spanish River (1781), Cape Breton.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Akins. (1895) History of Halifax. Dartmouth: Brook House Press.p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; French ships (fighting with the Americans) were re-coaling and defeated a British convoy. Six French sailors were killed and 17 British, with many more wounded.

===Colony of Cape Breton===
[[File:Red Ensign of Great Britain (1707-1800).svg|thumb|100px|Flag of the Colony of Cape Breton 1784–1801.]]
[[File:Civil Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|100px|Flag of the Colony of Cape Breton 1801–1820.]]
In 1784, Britain split the colony of Nova Scotia into three separate colonies:  New Brunswick, Cape Breton Island, and present-day peninsular Nova Scotia, in addition to the adjacent colonies of [[Prince Edward Island|St. John's Island]] (renamed Prince Edward Island in 1798) and [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].  The colony of Cape Breton Island had its capital at [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] on its namesake harbour fronting on [[Spanish Bay (Nova Scotia)|Spanish Bay]] and the [[Cabot Strait]]. Its first Lieutenant-Governor was [[Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres]] (1784–1787) and his successor was [[William Macarmick]] (1787).

A number of [[United Empire Loyalists]] emigrated to the Canadian colonies, including Cape Breton. [[David Mathews]], the former [[Mayor of New York City]] during the [[American Revolution]], emigrated with his family to Cape Breton in 1783.  He succeeded Macarmick as head of the colony and served from 1795 to 1798.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Mathews, David |first=R. J. |last=Morgan |volume=IV |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/mathews_david_4E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1799 to 1807, the military commandant was [[John Despard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DCB |title=Despard, John |first=R. J. |last=Morgan |volume=6 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/despard_john_6E.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; brother of [[Edward Despard|Edward]].&lt;ref&gt;Despard, John; ''The Companion to British History'', Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

An order forbidding the granting of land in Cape Breton, issued in 1763, was removed in 1784. The mineral rights to the island were given over to the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] by an order-in-council. The British government had intended that the Crown take over the operation of the mines when Cape Breton was made a colony, but this was never done, probably because of the rehabilitation cost of the mines. The mines were in a neglected state, caused by careless operations dating back at least to the time of the final fall of Louisbourg in 1758.

Large-scale shipbuilding began in the 1790s, beginning with [[schooner]]s for local trade moving in the 1820s to larger [[brig]]s and [[brigantine]]s, mostly built for British shipowners. Shipbuilding peaked in the 1850s, marked in 1851 by the [[full-rigged ship]] ''[[Lord Clarendon (ship)|Lord Clarendon]]'', the largest wooden ship ever built in Cape Breton.

===Merger with Nova Scotia===

In 1820, the colony of Cape Breton Island was merged for the second time with Nova Scotia.  This development is one of the factors which led to large-scale industrial development in the Sydney Coal Field of eastern Cape Breton County. By the late 19th century, as a result of the faster shipping, expanding fishery and industrialization of the island, exchanges of people between the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and Cape Breton increased, beginning a cultural exchange that continues to this day.

During the first half of the 19th century, Cape Breton Island experienced an influx of [[Highland Scots]] numbering approximately 50,000 as a result of the [[Highland Clearances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1211615-great-scots-the-past-comes-to-life-at-highland-village-museum|title=Great Scots: The past comes to life at Highland Village Museum|date=2014-06-01|work=The Chronicle Herald|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cabotshores.com/history-of-cape-breton-island-272|title=History of Cape Breton Island|date=2010-02-08|work=The Cabot Trail's Wilderness Resort on Cape Breton Island|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the descendants of the Highland Scots dominate Cape Breton Island's culture, particularly in rural communities.  To this day, [[Canadian Gaelic|Gaelic]] is still the first language of a number of elderly Cape Bretoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://highlandvillage.novascotia.ca/gaelic-nova-scotia/gaelic-language|title=The Gaelic Language|date=2013-01-17|work=Highland Village Museum|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing influence of English-dominated media from outside the Scottish communities saw the use of this language erode quickly during the 20th century. Many of the Scots who immigrated there were either Roman Catholics or Presbyterians, which can be seen in a number of island landmarks and place names.

The 1920s were some of the most violent times in Cape Breton. They were marked by several severe labour disputes.  The famous murder of [[William Davis (miner)|William Davis]] by strike breakers, and the seizing of the [[New Waterford, Nova Scotia|New Waterford]] power plant by striking miners led to a major union sentiment that persists to this day in some circles. [[William Davis Miners' Memorial Day]] is celebrated in coal mining towns to commemorate the deaths of miners at the hands of the coal companies.

===20th century===

The turn of the 20th century saw Cape Breton Island at the forefront of scientific achievement with the now-famous activities launched by inventors [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and [[Guglielmo Marconi]].

Following his successful invention of the telephone and being relatively wealthy, Bell acquired land near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]] in 1885, largely due to surroundings reminiscent of his early years in [[Scotland]]. He established a summer estate complete with research laboratories, working with deaf people—including [[Helen Keller]]—and continued to invent. Baddeck would be the site of his experiments with [[hydrofoil]] technologies as well as the [[Aerial Experiment Association]], financed by his wife, which saw the first powered flight in the [[British Empire]] when the [[AEA Silver Dart|AEA ''Silver Dart'']] took off from the ice-covered waters of [[Bras d'Or Lake]]. Bell also built the forerunner to the [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]] and experimented with breeding sheep.

Marconi's contributions to Cape Breton Island were also quite significant, as he used the island's geography to his advantage in transmitting the first North American trans-[[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] radio message from a station constructed at Table Head in [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]] to a receiving station at [[Poldhu]] in Cornwall, England. Marconi's pioneering work in Cape Breton marked the beginning of modern radio technology. Marconi's station at Marconi Towers, on the outskirts of Glace Bay, became the chief communication centre for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] in World War I through to the early years of World War II.

During World War II, there was a significant drop of Gaelic speakers due to anger over Ireland's neutrality toward the [[Nazi]] regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gaelic.novascotia.ca/sites/default/files/files/Gaelic-Report.pdf|title=Gaelic-Report|last=Kennedy|first=Michael|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Promotions for tourism beginning in the 1950s recognized the importance of the Scottish culture to the province, and the provincial government started encouraging the use of Gaelic once again. The establishment of funding for the [[Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts]] and formal Gaelic [[language courses]] in public schools are intended to address the near-loss of this culture to English [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]].
 
In the 1960s, the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] was partially reconstructed by [[Parks Canada]]. Since 2009, this [[National Historic Site of Canada]] has attracted an average of 90&amp;nbsp;000 visitors per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.krausehouse.ca/krause/FortressOfLouisbourgVisitationNumbers.htm |title=Fortress of Louisbourg Visitation Numbers |last1=Krause |first1=Eric R.|date=30 July 2014|publisher=Krause House Info-Research Solutions |accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

In early 2016, Cape Breton Island humorously announced that any American "refugees" fleeing their nation if [[Donald Trump]] (or possibly [[Hillary Clinton]]) won the presidential election would be welcomed to Cape Breton, with the only requirement being that the newcomers possess Canadian citizenship.&lt;ref name="cbiftrumpwins.com"&gt;Cape Breton if Donald Trump Wins, via http://cbiftrumpwins.com/#intro&lt;/ref&gt; In their website's FAQ, they state they are doing this both to help American "refugees" and because "...our population is shrinking. A slow economy, in combination with out-migration has us on an unsustainable path. The truth is we welcome all, no matter the ideology. We have a beautiful island, a friendly people, a rich culture and a bright future...". As of 9 November 2016, the day following [[United States presidential election, 2016|Election Day]], as well as Trump's victory, the offer still stands.&lt;ref name="cbiftrumpwins.com"/&gt;--&gt;

===Geography===
[[File:Sydney, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Sydney waterfront, focal point of the largest population centre on Cape Breton Island.]]
The island measures {{convert|10311|km2|0}} in area, making it the [[List of islands by area|77th largest island in the world]] and [[List of Canadian islands by area|Canada's 18th largest island]]. Cape Breton Island is composed mainly of rocky shores, rolling farmland, glacial valleys, barren headlands, mountains, woods and plateaus. Geological evidence suggests at least part of the island was joined with present-day Scotland and Norway, now separated by millions of years of [[plate tectonics]].

Cape Breton Island's northern portion is dominated by the [[Cape Breton Highlands]], commonly shortened to simply the "Highlands", which are an extension of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian mountain chain]]. The Highlands comprise the northern portions of [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness]] and [[Victoria County, Nova Scotia|Victoria counties]]. In 1936, the federal government established the [[Cape Breton Highlands National Park]] covering {{convert|949|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} across the northern third of the Highlands. The [[Cabot Trail]] scenic highway also encircles the plateau's coastal perimeter.
[[File:Sydney, Cape Breton waterfront buildings.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown Sydney is home to City Hall (right) as well as apartment complexes and hotels]]
Cape Breton Island's hydrological features include the [[Bras d'Or Lake]] system, a salt-water [[fjord]] at the heart of the island, and [[freshwater]] features including [[Lake Ainslie]], the [[Margaree River]] system, and the [[Mira River (Nova Scotia)|Mira River]]. Innumerable smaller rivers and streams drain into the Bras d'Or Lake [[estuary]] and on to the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Atlantic coasts.

Cape Breton Island is joined to the mainland by the [[Canso Causeway]], which was completed in 1955, enabling direct road and rail traffic to and from the island, but requiring [[marine traffic]] to pass through the [[Canso Canal]] at the eastern end of the [[causeway]].

Cape Breton Island is divided into four counties: [[Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness]], [[Richmond County, Nova Scotia|Richmond]], and [[Victoria County, Nova Scotia|Victoria]].

The climate is one of mild, often pleasantly warm summers and cold winters, although the proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and [[Gulf Stream]] moderates the extreme winter cold found on the mainland, especially on the east side that faces the Atlantic. Precipitation is abundant year round, with annual totals up to 60 inches on the eastern side facing the Atlantic storms. Considerable snowfall occurs in winter, especially in the highlands.

It permanently closed in July 2010. To the left is the also closed Talmud Torah community centre. This was the location of the Hebrew school and functions like Bar Mitzvah and wedding dinners.]]

The island's residents can be grouped into five main cultures: [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Acadian]], Irish, English, with respective languages [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[Míkmaq language|Mi'kmaq]], [[Acadian French|French]], and English. English is now the primary language, including a locally distinctive [[Cape Breton accent]], while Mi'kmaq, Scottish Gaelic and Acadian French are still spoken in some communities.

Later migrations of [[Black Loyalist]]s, Italians, and Eastern Europeans mostly settled in the island's eastern part around the industrial Cape Breton region. Cape Breton Island's population has been in decline two decades with an increasing exodus in recent years due to economic conditions.

According to the Census of Canada, the population of Cape Breton [Economic region] in 2016 / 2011 / 2006 / 1996 was 132,010 / 135,974 / 142,298 / 158,260.

Much of the recent economic history of Cape Breton Island can be tied to the coal industry.

The island has two major coal deposits:

* the Sydney Coal Field in the southeastern part of the island along the Atlantic Ocean drove the Industrial Cape Breton economy throughout the 19th and 20th centuries—until after [[World War II]], its industries were the largest private employers in Canada.
* the Inverness Coal Field in the western part of the island along the Gulf of St. Lawrence is significantly smaller but hosted several mines.

[[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] has traditionally been the main port, with facilities in a large, sheltered, natural harbour. It is the island's largest commercial centre and home to the ''[[Cape Breton Post]]'' daily newspaper, as well as one television station, [[CJCB-TV]] (CTV),{{refn|group="Note"|[[CBIT-TV]] (CBC) existed from 1972 until 31 July 2012, when the CBC closed its over-the-air analog transmitters in small markets. It produced a local news broadcast until 1991, when local news shows were consolidated to Halifax. The CBC Nova Scotia television signal, which originates from Halifax, is now available only by cable or satellite providers.&lt;ref name="CBC closes transmitters"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and several radio stations. The [[Marine Atlantic]] terminal at [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia|North Sydney]] is the terminal for large ferries traveling to [[Channel-Port aux Basques]] and seasonally to [[Argentia]], both on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].

[[Point Edward, Nova Scotia|Point Edward]] on the west side of Sydney Harbour is the location of Sydport, a former [[Royal Canadian Navy|navy]] base ({{HMCS|Protector}}) now converted to commercial use. The [[Canadian Coast Guard College]] is nearby at Westmount. Petroleum, bulk coal, and cruise ship facilities are also in Sydney Harbour.

[[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]], the second largest urban community in population, was the island's main coal mining centre until its last mine closed in the 1980s. Glace Bay was the hub of the Sydney &amp; Louisburg Railway and a major fishing port. At one time, Glace Bay was known as the largest town in Nova Scotia, based on population.

[[Port Hawkesbury]] has risen to prominence since the completion of the Canso Causeway and [[Canso Canal]] created an artificial deep-water port, allowing extensive petrochemical, pulp and paper, and gypsum handling facilities to be established. The Strait of Canso is completely navigable to [[Seawaymax]] vessels, and Port Hawkesbury is open to the deepest-draught vessels on the world's oceans. Large marine vessels may also enter Bras d'Or Lake through the Great Bras d'Or channel, and small craft can use the Little Bras d'Or channel or [[St. Peters Canal]]. While commercial shipping no longer uses the St. Peters Canal, it remains an important waterway for recreational vessels.

The industrial Cape Breton area faced several challenges with the closure of the [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]]'s (DEVCO) coal mines and the [[Sydney Steel Corporation]]'s (SYSCO) [[steel mill]]. In recent years, the Island's residents have tried to diversify the area economy by investing in tourism developments, [[call centre]]s, and small businesses, as well as manufacturing ventures in fields such as auto parts, pharmaceuticals, and window glazings.

While the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]] is in transition from an industrial to a service-based economy, the rest of Cape Breton Island outside the industrial area surrounding Sydney-Glace Bay has been more stable, with a mixture of fishing, forestry, small-scale agriculture, and tourism.

Tourism in particular has grown throughout the post-[[Second World War]] era, especially the growth in vehicle-based touring, which was furthered by the creation of the [[Cabot Trail]] scenic drive.  The scenery of the island is rivalled in northeastern North America by only [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]];{{Citation needed|reason=Subjective?|date=September 2013}} and Cape Breton Island tourism marketing places a heavy emphasis on its Scottish [[Gaels|Gaelic]] heritage through events such as the Celtic Colours Festival, held each October, as well as promotions through the [[Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts]].

Whale-watching is a popular attraction for tourists. Whale-watching cruises are operated by vendors from Baddeck to Cheticamp. The most popular species of whale found in Cape Breton's waters is the [[Pilot whale]].

The island's primary east-west road is [[Nova Scotia Highway 105|Highway 105]], the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], although [[Nova Scotia Trunk 4|Trunk 4]] is also heavily used. [[Nova Scotia Highway 125|Highway 125]] is an important arterial route around Sydney Harbour in the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]]. The [[Cabot Trail]], circling the Cape Breton Highlands, and [[Nova Scotia Trunk 19|Trunk 19]], along the island's western coast, are important secondary roads. The [[Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway]] maintains railway connections between the port of Sydney to the [[Canadian National Railway]] in [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]]

The [[Cabot Trail]] is a scenic road circuit around and over the [[Cape Breton Highlands]] with spectacular coastal vistas; over 400,000 visitors drive the Cabot Trail each summer and fall. Coupled with the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]], it has driven the growth of the tourism industry on the island in recent decades. The ''[[Condé Nast Publications|Condé Nast]]'' travel guide has rated Cape Breton Island as one of the world's best island destinations.

==Traditional music==
{{main|Cape Breton fiddling}}

Cape Breton is well known for its traditional fiddle music, which was brought to North America by Scottish immigrants during the [[Highland Clearances]]. The traditional style has been well preserved in Cape Breton, and [[céilidh]]s have become a popular attraction for tourists. [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness County]] in particular has a heavy concentration of musical activity, with regular performances in communities such as [[Mabou, Nova Scotia|Mabou]] and [[Judique, Nova Scotia|Judique]]. Judique is recognized as 'Baile nam Fonn', (literally: Village of Tunes) or the 'Home of Celtic Music', featuring the Celtic Music Interpretive Centre. Performers who have received significant recognition outside of Cape Breton include [[Bruce Guthro]], [[Buddy MacMaster]], [[Natalie MacMaster]], [[Ashley MacIsaac]], [[The Rankin Family]], [[Aselin Debison]], [[Gordie Sampson]], [[Lee Cremo]], and the [[Barra MacNeils]]. The Margaree's of Cape Breton also serve as a large contributor of fiddle music celebrated throughout the island. This traditional fiddle music of Cape Breton is studied by musicians around the world, where its global recognition continues to rise.

[[The Men of the Deeps]] are a male choral group of current and former miners from the industrial Cape Breton area.

[[File:Cavetto cornice.svg|thumb|Cavetto moulding]]
[[File:Chapel of Amenhotep II cavetto.jpg|thumb|Cavetto cornice above torus on the "Chapel of [[Amenhotep II]]" at [[Karnak]], 15th century BC]]

A '''cavetto''' is a [[wikt:concave#Adjective|concave]] [[molding (decorative)|moulding]] with a regular curved profile that is part of a circle, widely used in [[architecture]] as well as [[furniture]], [[picture frame]]s, metalwork and other [[decorative arts]]. In describing vessels and similar shapes in [[pottery]], metalwork and related fields, "cavetto" may be used of a variety of concave curves running round objects.  The word comes from Italian, as a diminutive of ''cave'', from the Latin for "hollow" (it is the same root as [[cave]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Cavetto"&lt;/ref&gt;  A vernacular alternative is "cove", most often used where interior walls curve at the top to make a transition to the roof, or for "upside down" cavettos at the bases of elements.&lt;ref&gt;"coving" is also a word for all types of interior mouldings&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cavetto moulding is the opposite of the [[wikt:convex#Adjective|convex]], bulging, [[ovolo]], which is equally common in the tradition of Western [[classical architecture]]. Both bring the surface forward, and are often combined with other elements of moulding.  Usually they include a curve through about a quarter-circle (90°).&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 124&lt;/ref&gt;  A concave moulding of about a full semi-circle is known as a "scotia".&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 132, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a minor element of decoration in [[classical architecture]], the prominent '''cavetto cornice''' is a common feature of the ancient architecture of Egypt and the [[Ancient Near East]].

==Architecture==
[[Ancient Egyptian architecture]] made especial use of large cavetto mouldings as a [[cornice]], with only a short fillet (plain vertical face) above, and a [[Molding_(decorative)#Types|torus]] moulding (convex semi-circle) below.  This cavetto cornice is sometimes also known as an "Egyptian cornice", "hollow and roll" or "gorge cornice", and has been suggested to be a reminiscence in stone architecture of the primitive use of bound bunches of reeds as supports for buildings, the weight of the roof bending their tops out.&lt;ref&gt;Brier, Bob, Hobbs, A. Hoyt, ''Daily Life of the Ancient Egyptians'', p. 200, 2008, Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|0313353069}}, 9780313353062, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h1LsCh68d7kC&amp;pg=PA200 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:Egyptian Building.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Egyptian Building]] (1845) in [[Richmond, Virginia]], with massive cavetto cornice and bell capitals]]

Many types of Egyptian capitals for columns are essentially cavettos running round the shaft, often with added decoration. These include the types known as "bell capitals" or "[[papyrus]] capitals".  These features are often reproduced in [[Egyptian Revival architecture]], as in the [[Egyptian Building]] (1845) in [[Richmond, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/sullivanm/virginia/richmond/egyptblding/medicalcollege.html Medical College of Richmond (now Egyptian Building, Medical College of Virginia)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cavetto cornice, often forming less than a quarter-circle, influenced Egypt's neighbours and as well as appearing in early Greek architecture, it is seen in Syria and [[ancient Iran]], for example at the [[Tachara]] palace of [[Darius I]] at [[Persepolis]], completed in 486 BC.  Inspired by this precedent, it was then revived by [[Ardashir I]] (r. 224–41 AD), the founder of the [[Sasanian dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Collon, et al. "Iran, ancient, II, 3." Grove Art Online, [[Oxford Art Online]], Oxford University Press, accessed January 5, 2017, [http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T041472 subscription required]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cavetto took the place of the Greek [[cymatium]] in many [[Etruscan architecture|Etruscan]] temples, often painted with vertical "tongue" patterns, and combined with the distinctive "Etruscan round moulding", often painted with scales.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, 61–67; [[:File:Villa Giulia ricostruzione del tempio etrusco 01.JPG|Example in the reconstructed Etruscan temple]] at [[Villa Giulia]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Tachara, Persepolis.jpg|thumb|The [[Tachara]] palace of [[Darius I]] at [[Persepolis]], completed in 486 BC]]

This emphasis on the cavetto was very different from its role in mature [[Ancient Greek architecture]], where cavetto elements were relatively small and subordinated to essentially vertical elements, setting the style for the subsequent Western classical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, Margaret M., ''A Companion to Greek Architecture'', 2016, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|1444335995}}, 9781444335996, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lvAGCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA40 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Often an essentially cavetto section is heavily decorated, in [[Gothic architecture]] often smothering the shape beneath.  

In general the Greeks made much more use of the cyma moulding, where a cavetto and ovolo were placed one above the other to produce a "S" shape; the [[cymatium]] using this was a standard part of the cornice in the classical [[Ionic order]], and often used elsewhere.  There are two forms, depending on which curve is uppermost: in the ''cyma recta'' the cavetto is on top, in the ''cyma reversa'' the ovolo. A cavetto alone was sometimes employed in the place of the cymatium of a cornice, as in the [[Doric order]] of the [[Theatre of Marcellus]] in Rome, one of the standard models for revived [[classical architecture]] from the Renaissance onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Perrault, 113&lt;/ref&gt;   But small cavetto mouldings were normal at various places, including integrated ones, not distinguished as a distinct zone by lines or borders, at the bottom of the shaft of columns, beginning the transition to the wider base.  These are called an [[apophyge]], or "concave sweep".&lt;ref&gt;See labelled diagrams at Summerson, 124–126&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[Claude Perrault]], the architect of [[Louis XIV]]'s [[Perrault's Colonnade|rebuilding]] of the [[Louvre Palace]], explained in his architectural textbook ''Ordonnance for the five kinds of columns after the method of the Ancients'' (1683) why he had replaced a cavetto with a cyma in his illustration of the Doric capital: "a cavetto is not as strong and is more readily broken than the other molding".&lt;ref&gt;Perrault, 113&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vessels==

The cavetto is demarcated by pairs of thin blue lines, and has [[running scroll]] decoration, different to that on either side of it in the flat middle and rim.]] 
In plates and other flattish shapes, ''cavetto'' is used for the curving area linking the base and the rim. This is the case whether the rim is a broad flat surface (typical 20th century Western plate), or merely the edge of the cavetto (typical modern cereal bowl).  Normally the term refers to the top surface of the vessel; if the underside is meant (where the curve is now convex), that may be described as "under the cavetto", "under-cavetto" and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;N. S. Brommelle, Perry Smith (eds), ''Urushi: Proceedings of the Urushi Study Group, June 10–27, 1985, Tokyo'', pp. 17–18, 1988, Getty Publications, {{ISBN|0892360968}}, 9780892360963, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uo5OAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA170 fully online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cavetto is very often left undecorated, but may have decoration of a different sort from the middle or a flat rim, and the term is typically used when it is necessary to describe this.  In complicated pottery shapes, where the normal vocabulary of mouldings is appropriate, cavetto may be used in that sense for any concave curving section.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ec8ejUxhfVwC&amp;pg=PA44 Hellenistic Pottery and Terracottas''], By Homer A. Thompson et al., examples B42 and B43&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the terminology of [[archaeology]], especially relating to pottery (and generally not used of pottery after antiquity, or outside archaeology), a cavetto zone or cavetto is a "sharp concavity encircling the body of a vessel", and also a "deep but narrow neck", both used in relation to mainly upright vessels for storing or cooking food.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, 120 (quoted); [https://collectionsprojects.org.uk/archaeology/Prehistoric%20Pottery%20Project/glossary-glossary.html Glossary, Tyne &amp; Wear Museums] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203201900/http://collectionsprojects.org.uk/archaeology/Prehistoric%20Pottery%20Project/glossary-glossary.html |date=February 3, 2016 }}, with illustration; see the table of British Food Vessel types [http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/5192/1/Wilkin14PhD_Redacted.pdf at p. 124 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Censorinus '''was a [[ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Philologist|grammarian]] and miscellaneous writer from the 3rd century AD.

He was the author of a lost work ''De Accentibus'' and of an extant treatise ''De Die Natali'', written in 238, and dedicated to his patron Quintus Caerellius as a birthday gift. The contents are of a varied character: the natural history of man, the influence of the stars and ''[[Genius (mythology)|genii]],'' music, religious rites, [[astronomy]], the doctrines of the [[Greek philosophers]], and [[antiquarian]] subjects.

The second part deals with chronological and mathematical questions, and has been of great service in determining the principal epochs of ancient history. The whole is full of curious and interesting information. The style is clear and concise, although somewhat [[rhetoric]]al, and the {{linktext|Latinity}} – for the period – good.

The chief authorities used were [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] and [[Suetonius' minor works|Suetonius]]. Some scholars, indeed, hold that the entire work is practically an adaptation of the lost ''Pratum'' of Suetonius. The fragments of a work ''De Naturali Institutione'', dealing with astronomy, [[geometry]], [[music]], and [[Metre (poetry)|versification]], and usually printed with the ''De Die Natali'' of Censorinus, are not by him. Part of the original manuscript, containing the end of the genuine work, and the title and name of the author of the fragment are lost.

A bright [[Censorinus (crater)|crater]] on the moon has been named after him.

The '''Chepangic languages''', [[Chepang language|Chepang]] and [[Bhujel language|Bhujel]], are [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] of uncertain affiliation spoken in Nepal. They are often classified as part of the [[Mahakiranti languages|Mahakiranti]] or [[Magaric languages|Magaric]] families (van Driem 2001).

Until recently, the [[Chepang people]] were [[hunter-gatherer]]s.

[[Image:Commuters in Maplewood NJ.jpg|thumb|300px|Many municipalities in [[New Jersey]] can be considered commuter towns. Here, riders wait in [[Maplewood (NJT station)|Maplewood]] for a train bound for New York City during the morning [[rush hour]].]]

A '''commuter town''' is a town whose residents normally work elsewhere but in which they live, eat and sleep. The name also suggests that these communities have little commercial or industrial activity beyond a small amount of locally-oriented retail business.

A commuter town may also be known as an "exurb" (short for "extra-urban"), "bedroom community" ([[Canadian English|Canada]] and northeastern [[American English|U.S.]] usage), "bedroom town", "bedroom suburb" ([[American English|U.S.]] usage), "dormitory town", "dormitory suburb" or less commonly a "dormitory village" ([[British English]]/Commonwealth/[[Hiberno-English|Ireland]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} In Japan, it may also be referred to with the ''[[wasei-eigo]]'' coinage {{nihongo|"bed town"|ベッドタウン|beddotaun}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ejje.weblio.jp/content/%E3%83%99%E3%83%83%E3%83%89%E3%82%BF%E3%82%A6%E3%83%B3|title=ベッドタウンの英語・英訳 - 英和辞典・和英辞典 Weblio辞書|trans-title="Beddo Tawn" - English Translation, English-Japanese Dictionary, Weblio Dictionary|language=Japanese|access-date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinction between suburbs and commuter towns ==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
[[Image:CamarilloCalifornia.jpg|thumb|[[Camarillo, California]], a typical U.S. ''bedroom community'' made up almost entirely of homes, schools and retail outlets]]

[[Suburb]]s and commuter towns often coincide, but are not synonymous. Similar to ''[[college town]]'', ''[[resort town]]'' and ''[[mill town]]'', the term ''commuter town'' describes the municipality's predominant economic function. A suburb, in contrast, is a [[community]] of lesser size, density, political power and/or commerce comparative to a nearby community that is usually of greater economic importance. A town's economic function may change, for example when improved transport brings commuters to industrial suburbs or [[railway town]]s in search of suburban living. Some suburbs, for example [[Teterboro, New Jersey]] and [[Emeryville, California]], remained industrial when they became surrounded by commuter towns; many commuters work in such industrial suburbs but few reside in them; hence, they are not commuter towns.

As a general rule, suburbs are developed in areas adjacent to a main [[employment]] center, such as a town or a city, but may or may not have many jobs locally, whereas bedroom communities have few local businesses, and most residents who have jobs commute to employment centers some distance away. Commuter towns may be in rural or semi-rural areas, with a ring of [[Open space reserve|green space]] separating them from the larger city or town. Where [[urban sprawl]] and [[conurbation]] have erased clear lines among towns and cities in large [[metropolitan area]]s, this is not the case.

== Causes ==
Commuter towns can arise for a number of different reasons. Sometimes, as in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]] or [[Tiburon, California]], a town loses its main source of employment, leaving its residents to seek work elsewhere. In other cases, a pleasant small town, such as [[Warwick, New York]], over time attracts more residents but not large businesses to employ them, requiring denizens to commute to employment centers. Another cause, particularly relevant in the American South and West, is the rapid growth of once-small cities. Owing largely to the earlier creation of the [[Interstate Highway System]], the greatest growth was seen by the sprawling metropolitan areas of these cities. As a result, many small cities{{which|date=February 2017}} were absorbed into the suburbs of these larger cities.

Often, however, commuter towns form when workers in a region cannot afford to live where they work and must seek residency in another town with a lower [[cost of living]]. The late 20th century [[dot-com bubble]] and [[United States housing bubble]] drove housing costs in Californian metropolitan areas to historic highs, spawning exurban growth in adjacent counties. For example, most cities in western [[Riverside County, California]] can be considered exurbs of [[Orange County, California]] and [[Los Angeles County, California]]. {{As of|2003}}, over 80% of the workforce of [[Tracy, California]] was employed in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

A related phenomenon is common in the [[resort town]]s of the [[American West]] that require large workforces, yet emphasize building larger single-family residences and other expensive housing. For example, the resort town of [[Jackson, Wyoming]] has spawned several nearby bedroom communities, including [[Victor, Idaho]], [[Driggs, Idaho]], and [[Alpine, Wyoming]], where the majority of the Jackson workforce resides. On [[Long Island, New York]], many of the workforce who serve [[The Hamptons]] also reside in communities more modest and more suburban than their workplace, giving rise to a daily reverse commuter flow from more dense to less dense areas.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
 
In certain major European cities, such as [[Berlin]] and [[London]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} commuter towns were founded in response to bomb damage sustained during [[World War II]]. Residents were relocated to semi-rural areas within a {{convert|50|mi|km|sing=on}} radius, firstly because much inner city housing had been destroyed, and secondly in order to stimulate development away from cities as the industrial infrastructure shifted from rail to road. Around London, several towns – such as [[Basildon]], [[Crawley]], [[Harlow]], and [[Stevenage]] – were built for this purpose by the [[Commission for New Towns]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In some cases, commuter towns can result from negative economic conditions. [[Steubenville, Ohio]], for instance, had its own regional identity along with neighboring [[Weirton, West Virginia]] until the [[Steel crisis|collapse of the steel industry]] in the 1980s. Combined with easier access to the much larger city of [[Pittsburgh]] via the [[U.S. Route 22 in Pennsylvania|Steubenville Pike]] and the [[Interstate 376|Parkway West]], Steubenville has shifted its marketing efforts to being a commuter town to Pittsburgh, as well as one with a lower cost of living in [[Ohio]] compared to tax-heavy [[Pennsylvania]]. In 2013, [[Jefferson County, Ohio]] (where Steubenville is located) was added to the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area]] as part of its larger [[Combined Statistical Area]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/bulletins/2013/b13-01.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
Where commuters are wealthier and small town housing markets weaker than city housing markets, the development of a bedroom community may raise local housing prices and attract upscale service businesses in a process akin to [[gentrification]]. Long-time residents may be displaced by new commuter residents due to rising house prices. This can also be influenced by [[zoning]] restrictions in urbanized areas that prevent the construction of suitably cheap housing closer to places of employment.

The number of commuter towns increased in the [[United States|US]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]] during the 20th century because of a trend for people to move out of the cities into the surrounding [[green belt]]. Historically, commuter towns were developed by railway companies to create demand for their lines. One 1920s pioneer of this form of development was the [[Metropolitan Railway]] (now part of [[London Underground]]) which marketed its [[Metro-land]] developments. This initiative encouraged many to move out of central and inner-city [[London]] to suburbs such as [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]] and out of London itself, to [[commuter village]]s in [[Buckinghamshire]] or [[Hertfordshire]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Commuter towns have more recently been built ahead of adequate transportation infrastructure, thus spurring the development of roads and [[public transportation]] systems. These can take the form of [[light rail]] lines extending from the city centre to new [[streetcar suburb]]s and new or expanded [[highway]]s, whose construction and [[traffic]] can lead to the community becoming part of a larger [[conurbation]].

In the United States, it is common for commuter towns to create disparities in municipal tax rates. When a commuter town collects few business taxes, residents must pay the brunt of the public operating budget in higher [[property tax|property]] or [[income tax]]es. Such municipalities may scramble to encourage [[commerce|commercial]] growth once an established [[residential]] base has been reached.

A 2014 study by the British Office for National Statistics found that commuting also affects wellbeing. Commuters are more likely to be anxious, dissatisfied and have the sense that their daily activities lack meaning than those who don’t have to travel to work even if they are paid more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/commuting-and-personal-well-being--2014/art-commuting-and-personal-well-being.html#tab-2--Key-Points |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/wellbeing/measuring-national-well-being/commuting-and-personal-well-being--2014/art-commuting-and-personal-well-being.html#tab-2--Key-Points |title=Commuting and Personal Well-being, 2014|publisher=Office for National Statistics |archive-date=5 January 2016 |access-date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Belgium]], the development of traditional rural Flemish towns surrounding Brussels into commuter towns is causing major language tensions, as most of the newcoming commuters are French-speaking or even international English-speaking families with no attachment to the Flemish roots. The Flemish movement in the [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] area, with demands such as the strict enforcement of the [[Dutch language]] (restaurants with bilingual menus have been assaulted by activists, etc.) can be analyzed as a reaction against [[gentrification]] caused by the arrival of those wealthier non-Dutch speakers working in international companies, national administration or the [[European Parliament]].

== Exurbs ==
The expression ''exurb'' (for "extra-urban") was coined by Auguste Comte Spectorsky, in his 1955 book ''The Exurbanites'', to describe the ring of prosperous communities beyond the [[suburb]]s that are commuter towns for an urban area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Spectorsky, Auguste C. | title =The Exurbanites | year=1955 | publisher = J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.|location=Lippincott, Philadelphia |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/476943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most exurbs serve as commuter towns, but most commuter towns are not exurban.

Exurbs vary in wealth and education level. In the United States, exurban areas typically have much higher college education levels than closer-in suburbs, though this is not necessarily the case in other countries. They also typically have average incomes much higher than nearby rural counties, and some have some of the highest median household incomes in their respective metropolitan area. However, depending on local circumstances, some exurbs have higher poverty levels than suburbs nearer the city.

Examples of exurbs in the U.S. include:
* [[Cartersville, Georgia]] outside [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]
* [[Castle Rock, Colorado]], Outside [[Denver|Denver, Colorado]]
* [[Conroe, Texas]] outside [[Houston]]
* [[Hunterdon County, New Jersey|Hunterdon]], [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth]], [[Morris County, New Jersey|Morris]], [[Ocean County, New Jersey|Ocean]], and [[Somerset County, New Jersey|Somerset]], Counties in [[New Jersey]] are all exurbs of New York City.

=== Then and now ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
Commuters from early exurbs, such as the end of [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Pennsylvania Main Line|Main Line]] and the [[Northern Westchester]] region of [[Westchester County, New York]], reached the city center via [[commuter rail]] and [[Parkway|parkway systems]].

Today's exurbs are composed of small neighborhoods in otherwise lightly developed areas, towns, and (comparatively) small cities. Some lie in the outer suburbs of an urbanized area, but a few miles of rural, wooded, or agricultural land separates many exurbs from the suburbs. Exurbs may have originated independently of the major city to which many residents commute. Most consist almost exclusively of commuters and lack the historical and cultural traditions of more established cities. Many early 20th century exurbs were organized on the principles of the [[garden city movement]].

Yesterday's sprawling exurbs, such as [[Forest Hills, Queens|Forest Hills]] and [[Garden City, New York]], often become a later decade's suburbs, surrounded and absorbed into a belt of [[infill]].

=== Planning ===
Many suburbs within a metropolitan city proper enjoyed their greatest growth in the post-World War II period, after which growth slowed for several decades; however, since the 1990s extensive development has occurred outside of cities. There have also been significant growth differences between inside and outside metro boundaries; many developments typical of exurbs, such as the proliferation of [[big box]] retailers, lie just on the outside, due to older suburbs' being restricted by inner-city land-use politics while communities outside are free to develop and grow.

Some [[architect]]s, [[environmentalist]]s, and [[urban planner]]s consider exurbs to be manifestations of poor or distorted [[urban planning|planning]]. Comparatively low density towns &amp;ndash; often featuring large lots and large homes &amp;ndash; create heavy [[automobile dependency|motor vehicle dependency]].  
{{quote|"They begin as embryonic subdivisions of a few hundred homes at the far edge of beyond, surrounded by scrub. Then, they grow &amp;ndash; first gradually, but soon with explosive force &amp;ndash; attracting stores, creating jobs and struggling to keep pace with the need for more schools, more roads, more everything. And eventually, when no more land is available and home prices have skyrocketed, the whole cycle starts again, another 15 minutes down the turnpike."|Rick Lyman|''The New York Times''&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Others argue that exurban environments, such as those that have emerged in [[Oregon]] over the last 40 years as a result of the state's [[Land use in Oregon|unique land use laws]], have helped to protect local agriculture and local businesses by creating strict [[urban growth boundary|urban growth boundaries]] that encourage greater population densities in centralized towns, while slowing or greatly reducing urban and suburban sprawl into agricultural and timber land.&lt;ref&gt;

'''eTBLAST''' is a now-defunct free text similarity service [[search engine]] which offered access to the [[MEDLINE]] database, the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) [[Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects|CRISP]] database, the [[Institute of Physics]] (IOP) database, [[Wikipedia]], [[arXiv]], the [[NASA]] technical reports database, Virginia Tech class descriptions and a variety of databases of clinical interest. It is continuously expanding with additional text-based databases.  eTBLAST searched citation databases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btl388 |title=Text similarity: An alternative way to search MEDLINE |year=2006 |last1=Lewis |first1=J |last2=Ossowski |first2=S |last3=Hicks |first3=J |last4=Errami |first4=M |last5=Garner |first5=HR |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=22 |issue=18 |pages=2298–304 |pmid=16926219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/MEMB.2004.1378640 |title=Text comparison based on dynamic programming |year=2004 |last1=Pertsemlidis |first1=A |last2=Garner |first2=HR |journal=IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=66–71 |pmid=15688594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and databases containing full text,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0012704 |title=Systematic Characterizations of Text Similarity in Full Text Biomedical Publications |year=2010 |editor1-last=Curioso |editor1-first=Walter H |last1=Sun |first1=Z |last2=Errami |first2=M |last3=Long |first3=T |last4=Renard |first4=C |last5=Choradia |first5=N |last6=Garner |first6=H |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=9 |pages=e12704 |pmid=20856807 |pmc=2939881 |bibcode=2010PLoSO...512704S }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[PUBMED]].  The eTBLAST server compared a user's natural text query to target databases using a hybrid search algorithm consisting of a low-sensitivity weighted keyword-based first pass followed by a novel sentence-alignment based second pass.  eTBLAST was a web-based service of The Innovation Laboratory at the [[Virginia Bioinformatics Institute]].

eTBLAST, as a text similarity engine, made possible a large study of duplicate publications and potential plagiarisms in the biomedical literature.  Thousands of random samples of Medline abstracts were submitted to eTBLAST, and those with the highest similarity were studied and entered into an on-line database. This work revealed several trends, including an increasing rate of duplication in the biomedical literature, as reported in the journals ''[[Bioinformatics (journal)|Bioinformatics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btm574 |title=Deja vu a study of duplicate citations in Medline |year=2007 |last1=Errami |first1=M |last2=Hicks |first2=JM |last3=Fisher |first3=W |last4=Trusty |first4=D |last5=Wren |first5=JD |last6=Long |first6=TC |last7=Garner |first7=HR |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=243–9 |pmid=18056062 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btq146 |title=Identifying duplicate content using statistically improbable phrases |year=2010 |last1=Errami |first1=M |last2=Sun |first2=Z |last3=George |first3=AC |last4=Long |first4=TC |last5=Skinner |first5=MA |last6=Wren |first6=JD |last7=Garner |first7=HR |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=26 |issue=11 |pages=1453–7 |pmid=20472545 |pmc=2872002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Anaesthesia and Intensive Care]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18853580 |year=2008 |last1=Loadsman |first1=JA |last2=Garner |first2=HR |last3=Drummond |first3=GB |title=Towards the elimination of duplication in ''Anaesthesia and Intensive Care'' |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=643–5 |journal=Anaesthesia and Intensive Care |url=http://www.aaic.net.au/document/?D=20080552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Clinical Chemistry (journal)|Clinical Chemistry]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1373/clinchem.2009.130468 |title=Quaere Verum |year=2010 |last1=George |first1=AC |last2=Long |first2=TC |last3=Garner |first3=HR |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=673–4 |pmid=20093558 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Urologic Oncology]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.urolonc.2010.09.016 |title=Combating unethical publications with plagiarism detection services |year=2011 |last1=Garner |first1=HR |journal=Urologic Oncology |volume=29 |pages=95–9 |pmid=    21194644 |pmc=3035174}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/451397a |title=A tale of two citations |year=2008 |last1=Errami |first1=M |last2=Garner |first2=H |journal=Nature |volume=451 |issue=7177 |pages=397–9 |pmid=18216832 |bibcode=2008Natur.451..397E }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1167408 |title=Responding to Possible Plagiarism |year=2009 |last1=Long |first1=TC |last2=Errami |first2=M |last3=George |first3=AC |last4=Sun |first4=Z |last5=Garner |first5=HR |journal=Science |volume=323 |issue=5919 |pages=1293–4 |pmid=19265004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4448">In [[philosophy]] and [[rhetoric]], '''eristic''' (from ''[[Eris (mythology)|Eris]]'', the ancient Greek [[goddess]] of chaos, strife, and discord) refers to [[argument]] that aims to successfully dispute another's argument, rather than searching for [[truth]]. According to T.H. Irwin, "It is characteristic of the eristic to think of some arguments as a way of defeating the other side, by showing that an opponent must assent to the negation of what he initially took himself to believe."&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, T.H. "Plato's Objection to the Sophists." The Greek World. London: Routledge, 1995. P. 585. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Eristic is arguing for the sake of conflict, as opposed to resolving conflict.&lt;ref&gt;H.D. Rankin (1983). Sophists, Socratics and Cynics. Pp. 233–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in education==
Eristic was a type of "question-and-answer"&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Nehamas. "Eristic, Antilogic, Sophistic, Dialectic: Plato's Demarcation of Philosophy from Sophistry". (page 6)&lt;/ref&gt; teaching method popularized by the [[Sophism|Sophists]], such as [[Euthydemus (Socratic literature)|Euthydemos]] and [[Dionysodoros]]. Students learned eristic arguments to "refute their opponent, no matter whether he [said] yes or no in answer to their initial question".&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, T.H. "Plato's Objection to the Sophists." The Greek World. London: Routledge, 1995. 583. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Plato]] contrasted this type of argument with [[dialectic]] and other more [[reason]]able and [[logic]]al methods (e.g., at [[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] 454a). In the dialogue [[Euthydemus (dialogue)|''Euthydemus'']], Plato satirizes eristic. It is more than persuasion, and it is more than discourse. It is a combination that wins an argument without regard to truth. Plato believed that the eristic style "did not constitute a method of argument" because to argue eristically is to consciously use fallacious arguments, which therefore weakens one's position.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Nehamas. "Eristic, Antilogic, Sophistic, Dialectic: Plato's Demarcation of Philosophy from Sophistry". (page 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Plato, [[Isocrates]] (often considered a Sophist) did not distinguish eristic from dialectic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0168:book=5:section=454a&lt;/ref&gt; He held that both lacked a "'useful application' ... that created responsible citizens",&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Charles. Classical rhetoric and modern public relations: an Isocratean model. New York: Routledge, 2013. P. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; which unscrupulous teachers used for "enriching themselves at the expense of the youth."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0144:speech=15:section=45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical eristic==
[[Schopenhauer]] considers that only logic pursues truth. For him, [[dialectic]], [[sophistry]] and eristic have no objective truth in view, but only the appearance of it, and pay no regard to truth itself because it aims at victory. He names these three last methods as "eristic dialectic (contentious argument)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://coolhaus.de/art-of-controversy/eristii.htm Controversial Dialectic] on CoolHaus.de accessed at January 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Schopenhauer]], [[The Art of Being Right|''Eristic Dialectic'']] is mainly concerned to tabulate and analyze dishonest stratagems,&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Dialectica Eristica'' Schopenhauer presents 38 eristic stratagems&lt;/ref&gt; so that they may at once be recognized and defeated, in order to continue with a productive dialectic debate. It is for this very reason that Eristic Dialectic must admittedly take victory, and not objective truth, for its selfish aim and purpose.

==Argumentation theory==
[[Argumentation theory]] is a field of study that asks critical questions about eristic arguments and the other types of dialogue.

[[File:Rector Vallfogona Poesia.JPG|thumb|180px|Poem of the '''Vallfogona Rector''' in a street in [[Vallfogona de Riucorb]]]]
'''Francesc Vicent Garcia i Torres''' ({{IPA-ca|fɾənˈsɛzɡ biˈsɛŋ ɡəɾˈsi.ə}}) was an early modern [[Spanish people|Spanish]] poet known by the pseudonym of the '''Vallfogona Rector'''.  He was born in [[Tortosa]] in the [[Baix Ebre]] [[comarca]] around 1582 and died in [[Vallfogona de Riucorb]] ([[Conca de Barberà]]) in 1623.  In 1605 he was ordained in [[Vic]].

==Early life==
Vicent Garcia completed his religious studies in Barcelona. In Vic, where he was ordained, he was the secretary to Bishop Francis Robust. In 1607, Garcia was appointed to the Vallfogona Riucorb rectory, where he remained until 1621. This spell at Vallfogona was followed by appointment to the post of secretary of the Bishop of [[Girona]], Peter Moncada. A year after taking up this post, Garcia obtained a doctorate in theology from the College of St. George and St. Matthias in [[Tortosa]]. Vallfogona Riucorb died on September 2, 1623. Barcelona was a central place in Garcia's life. It was a city he visited frequently. In Barcelona, Garcia moved in the literary circle that met Bishop Juan de Moncada in his palace.&lt;ref name="Vicent  Garcia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vicent  Garcia|url=http://www.escriptors.cat/autors/garciafv/pagina.php?id_sec=1089|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
He cultivated an artful and elegant verse in sonnets and [[décima]] form, and also wrote violent [[satire]] and obscene or [[grotesque]] compositions.  His style was imitated by many Catalan authors of the 18th century, a phenomenon known as "vallfogonisme."  In 1703 a portion of his work was published.  The 1770 edition was banned by the [[Inquisition]]. In 1988 Albert Rossich included some of his poems in an [https://www.amazon.com/dp/8485704665/ anthology] of erotic and pornographic Catalan poetry from the 17th century.

==Rumors==
Vicent Garcia was subject to numerous rumors. One of them was that he visited Madrid in 1622 at the request of King [[Philip IV of Spain|Philip IV]]. Another baseless belief was that he had a friendship with [[Lope de Vega]]. Perhaps the most absurd was the story of his alleged poisoning by [[Zaragoza]] courtiers. His literary stature, however, was unquestionable. He is widely accepted as the first great Catalan writer. His works were seminal, creating a literary school that lasted well into the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Vicent  Garcia" /&gt;

==Style==
Garcia's poetry resembled that of Spanish contemporary poets, especially in terms of the formality and theme. His use of language was particularly unique. He had a predilection for an elegant form of language, and his writings were always laced with irony and literary subjects. It was this characteristic in his work that drew comparisons with [[Francisco de Quevedo|Quevedo]]. Some of Garcia best-known poems are ''A Lady in A beautiful Black Hair'', ''Epitaph On the Grave Of a Heavy Drinker'', and the sonnet ''Time''. As the titles suggest, Garcia was a versatile poet, writing on diverse topics. He was also a playwright, and wrote a play, ''Comedy in Santa Barbara'', to mark the occasion of the inauguration of the chapel of Santa Barbara Vallfogona in 1617.&lt;ref name="Vicent  Garcia" /&gt;

'''Greater Siangic''' is a language grouping proposed by [[Roger Blench]] (2014). It includes the ''[[Siangic languages]]'', ''[[Digaro languages]]'' ([[Idu Mishmi language|Idu Mishmi]] and [[Taraon language|Taraon]]) and ''Pre-[[Tani languages|Tani]]'', the hypothetical [[stratum (linguistics)|substrate]] language branch of Tani before it became relexified by Sino-Tibetan. Blench (2014) argues that Greater Siangic is an independent language family that has undergone areal influences from [[Sino-Tibetan languages]], and is not a branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17712">'''Kabyle grammar''' is the grammar of the [[Kabyle language]].

==Nouns and adjectives==
===Gender===

As an [[Afro-asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic language]], Kabyle has only two [[Grammatical gender|genders]], masculine and feminine. Like most [[Berber languages]], masculine nouns and adjectives generally start with a vowel (''a-'', ''i-'', ''u-''), while the feminine nouns generally start with ''t-'' and end with a ''-t'' (there are some exceptions, however). Note that most feminine nouns are in fact feminized versions of masculine nouns.

Examples: 
*''Aqcic'' "a boy", '''''t'''aqcic'''t''''' "a girl".
*''Amɣar'' "an old man", '''''t'''amɣar'''t''''' "an old woman".
*''Argaz'' "a man", Tameṭṭut "a woman".
*''Izi'' "a fly", ''Tizit'' "mosquito".

===Pluralization===

Singular nouns generally start with an ''a-'', and do not have a suffix. Plural nouns generally start with an ''i-'' and often have a suffix such as ''-en''. There are three types of plural : External, [[Broken plural|Internal]], Mixed:

*External or "Regular": consists in changing the initial vowel of the noun, and adding a [[suffix]] -n,
::'''''a'''mɣar'' "an old man" → '''''i'''mɣar'''en''''' "old men".
::'''a'''rgaz → '''i'''rgaz'''en''' "men"
::ul → ulaw'''en''' "hearts"

*Internal: involves only a change in the vowels within the word:
::adrar → id'''u'''rar "mountain"
::amic'''i'''c "a cat" → imc'''a'''c "cats"

*Mixed: combines a change of vowels (within the word) with the suffix ''-n'':
::igenn'''i''' "sky" → igenwa'''n''' "skies".
::iz'''i''' → iz'''an''' "fly"
::aẓ'''a'''r → iẓ'''u'''r'''an''' "root"
::'''a'''fus → '''i'''fass'''en''' "hands"

===Free and annexed state===

As in all Berber languages, Kabyle has two types of states or [[grammatical case|cases]] of the [[noun]], organized [[Ergative case|ergatively]]: one is unmarked, while the other serves as the subject of a transitive verb and the object of a preposition, among other contexts. The former is often called ''free state'', the latter ''construct state''. The construct state of the noun derives from the free state through one of the following rules:

The first involves a vowel alternation, whereby the vowel ''a'' become ''u'' :
::amaziɣ → umaziɣ "Berber"
::ameqqran → umeqqran "big"
::adrar → udrar "mountain"
The second involves the loss of the initial vowel in the case of some feminine nouns (the sound represented by the letter 'e' is not considered a true vowel):
::t'''a'''mɣart → t'''e'''mɣart "women"
::t'''a'''mdint → t'''e'''mdint "town"
::t'''a'''murt → tmurt "country"
The third involves the addition of a semi-vowel (''w'' or ''y'') word-initially:
::asif → '''w'''asif "river"
::aḍu → '''w'''aḍu "wind"
::iles → '''y'''iles "tongue"
::uccen → '''w'''uccen "jackal"
Finally, some nouns do not change for free state:
::taddart → taddart "village"
::tuccent → tuccent "female jackal"

Depending on the role of the noun in the sentence, it takes either its free or annexed state:

*Free: ''Yewwet '''a'''qcic''. "He has beaten a boy". (Verb–object)
*Annexed: ''Yewwet '''we'''qcic''. "The boy has beaten". (Verb–subject)

After a preposition (at the exception of "ar" and "s"), all nouns take their annexed state:

*Free state: '''A'''man (water), Kas n '''wa'''man (a glass of water).

==Verbs==
There are three tenses : the [[Preterite]] (past), intensive Aorist (present perfect, present continuous, past continuous) and the future (Ad+Aorist). Unlike other Berber languages, the [[aorist]] alone is rarely used in Kabyle (In the other languages it is used to express the present).

*"Weak verbs" have a preterite form that is the same as their aorist. Examples of weak verbs that follow are conjugated at the first person of the singular:

{| class="wikitable"
!  Verb
!  Preterite
!  ad + aorist
!  Intensive aorist 
|- 
! If (to outdo)
|  ifeɣ
|  ad ifeɣ
|  ttifeɣ
|- 
! Muqel (to observe)
|  muqleɣ
|  ad muqleɣ
|  ttmuquleɣ
|- 
!  Krez (to plough)
|  kerzeɣ
|  ad kerzeɣ
|  kerrzeɣ
|}

*"Strong verbs" or "irregular verbs":

{| class="wikitable"
!  Verb
!  Preterite
!  ad + aorist
!  Intensive aorist 
|- 
! Aru (to write)
|  uriɣ
|  ad aruɣ
|  ttaruɣ 
|}

===Conjugation===
[[Grammatical conjugation|Conjugation]] in Kabyle is done by adding suffixes (prefixes, postfixes or both). These suffixes are static and identical for all tenses (only the theme changes):

{| class="wikitable"
!  Person 
!  Singular 
!  Plural 
|- 
! 1st 
|  — (e)ɣ
|  n(e) —
|- 
!  2nd (m)
| t(e) — (e)ḍ
| t(e) — (e)m
|- 
! 2nd (f) 
| t(e) — (e)ḍ
| t(e) — (e)mt
|- 
!  3rd (m)
|  i/y(e) — 
|  — (e)n
|- 
!  3rd (f)
|  t(e) — 
|  — (e)nt
|}

*Example: verb '''afeg''' (to fly) with its four themes : '''ufeg''' (preterite), '''ufig''' (negative preterite), '''afeg''' (aorist), '''ttafeg''' (intensive aorist).

===Verb framing===
Kabyle is a [[Verb framing|satellite-framed]] based language, Kabyle verbs use two particles to show the path of motion:
*''d'' orients toward the speaker, and could be translated as "here".
*''n'' orients toward the interlocutor or toward a certain place, and could be translated as "there".

Examples:
* « iruḥ-'''d''' » (he came), « iruḥ-'''n''' » (he went).
* « awi-'''d''' aman» (bring the water), « awi-'''n''' aman » (carry away the water).

===Negation===
Kabyle usually expresses negation in two parts, with the [[Grammatical particle|particle]] ''ur'' attached to the verb, and one or more negative words that modify the verb or one of its [[argument]]s. For example, simple verbal negation is expressed by « ''ur'' » before the verb and the particle « ''ara'' » after the verb:
*« Urareɣ » ("I played") → « '''Ur''' urareɣ '''ara''' » ("I did not play")
Other negative words (acemma ... etc.) are used in combination with ''ur'' to express more complex types of negation.

===Verb derivation===
Verb derivation is done by adding affixes. There are three types of derivation forms : [[Causative]], [[Reflexive verb|reflexive]] and [[Passive tense|Passive]].

*'''Causative''': obtained by prefixing the verb with s- / sse- / ssu- :
::ffeɣ "to go out" → ssuffeɣ "to make to go out"
::kcem "to enter" → ssekcem "to make to enter, to introduce"
::irid "to be washed" → ssired "to wash".
*'''Reflexive''': obtained by prefixing the verb with m- / my(e)- / myu-:
::ẓer "to see" → mẓer "to see each other"
::ṭṭef "to hold" → myuṭṭaf "to hold each other".
*'''Passive''': is obtained by prefixing the verb with ttu- / ttwa- / tt- / mm(e)- / n- / nn-:
::krez "to plough" → ttwakrez "to be ploughed"
::ečč "to eat" → mmečč "to be eaten".
*'''Complex forms''': obtained by combining two or more of the previous prefixes:
::enɣ "to kill" → mmenɣ "to kill each other" → smenɣ "to make to kill each other"
Two prefixes can cancel each other:
::enz "to be sold" → zzenz "to sell"  → ttuzenz "to be sold" (ttuzenz = enz !!).

=== Agent noun ===
Every verb has a corresponding [[agent noun]]. In English it could be translated into verb+er. It is obtained by prefixing the verb with « am- » or with « an- » if the first letter is b / f / m / w (there are exceptions however).

*Examples:
::ṭṭef "to hold" → anaṭṭaf "holder"
::inig "to travel" → iminig "traveller"
::eks "to graze" → ameksa "shepherd"

===Action noun===
Every verb has a corresponding [[action noun]], which in English it could be translated into verb+ing:

::ffer "to hide" → tuffra "hiding" (stem VI), « Tuffra n tidett ur telhi » — "Hiding the truth is bad".

There are 6 regular stems of forming action nouns, and the 7th is for quality verbs : (C for consonant, V for vowel)

{| class="wikitable"
!  Stem 
!  Verb 
!  Action noun 
|- 
! I 
| cvcv
| acvcv
|- 
! II
| c(c)vc(c)
| ac(c)vc(c)v
|- 
! III 
| c(c)ecc
| ac(c)ecci
|- 
! IV
| (c)cac(c) 
| a(c)cac(c)i
|- 
! V
| c1c2ec3
| accac
|- 
! VI
| ccec 
| tuccca
|- 
! VII
| ic1c2vc3 
| tec1c2ec3
|}

*Examples:
::ɣeẓẓ "to bite" → aɣẓaẓ
::zdi "to be united" → azday
::ini "to say" → timenna

===Predicative particle "d"===
The predicative particle "d" is an indispensable tool in speaking Kabyle, "d" is equivalent to both "it is + adjective" and "to be + adjective", but cannot be replaced by the verb "ili" (to be). It is always followed by a noun (free state).

Examples:
*D taqcict, "it's a girl".
*D nekk, "it's me".
*Nekk d argaz, "I'm a man".
*Idir d anelmad, "Idir is a student".
*Idir yella d anelmad, "Idir was a student".

The predicative particle "d" should not be confused with the particle of coordination "d"; indeed, the latter is followed by a noun at its annexed state while the first is always followed by a noun at its free state.

*Example : « Yenna-yas. » — "He said to him." (He.said-to.him)
*Complex example (Mixing indirect and direct object) : « Yefka-yas-t. » — "He gave it to him." (He.gave-to.him-it)

=== Demonstratives ===
There are three demonstratives, [[deixis|near-deictic]] ('this, these'), far-deictic ('that, those') and absence:

*Suffix: Used with a noun, example : « Axxam-agi» — "This house." (House-this).

===Numerotation===
Only the first two numbers are Berber; for higher numbers, [[Arabic]] is used.  They are ''yiwen'' (f. ''yiwet'') "one", ''sin'' (f. ''snat'') "two". The noun being counted follows it in the [[genitive]]: ''sin n yirgazen'' "two men".

"First" and "last" are respectively ''amezwaru'' and ''aneggaru'' (regular adjectives).  Other [[ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinals]] are formed with the prefix ''wis'' (f. ''tis''): ''wis sin'' "second (m.)", ''tis tlata'' "third (f.)", etc.

===Prepositions===
[[Prepositions]] precede their objects: « ''i medden'' » "to the people", « ''si temdint'' » "from the town".   All words preceded by a preposition (at the exception of « ''s'' » and « ''ar'' », "towards", "until" ) take their annexed state.

Some prepositions have two forms : one is used with pronominal suffixes and the other form is used in all other contexts.

Also some of these prepositions have a corresponding [[relative pronoun]] (or [[interrogative pronoun|interrogative]]), example:

::« '''i''' » "for/to" → « '''iwumi''' » "to whom"
::« Tefka aksum '''i''' wemcic » "she gave meat '''to''' the cat" → « Amcic '''iwumi''' tefka aksum » "The cat '''to whom''' she gave meat"

The grammar of the [[Klingon language]] was created by [[Marc Okrand]] for the [[Star Trek]] franchise. He first described it in his book ''[[The Klingon Dictionary]]''. It is a [[nominative–accusative]], primarily suffixing [[agglutinative]] language, and has an [[object–verb–subject]] word order. The Klingon language has a number of unusual grammatical features, as it was designed to sound and seem alien, but it has an extremely regular morphology.

== Word order ==
Klingon follows an [[object–verb–subject]] word order.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Adverbs usually go at the beginning of the sentence&lt;ref name="p56"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.56. Note exception &lt;code&gt;'''neH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''only, merely'' from p.56 and &lt;code&gt;'''jay’'''&lt;/code&gt; (swear word) from p.177.&lt;/ref&gt; and prepositional phrases go before the object.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.180&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;code&gt;'''Do’ DujDaq ghoqwI’ Sam la’'''&lt;/code&gt;
{| style="margin-left:1.4em"
|-
| &lt;code&gt;'''Do’'''&lt;/code&gt; ||  &lt;code&gt;'''Duj'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''Daq'''&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;'''ghoqwI’'''&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;'''Sam'''&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;'''la’'''&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|''fortunately'' || ''ship'' || + || ''locative'' || ''spy'' || ''find''|| ''commander''
|}
: ''Fortunately, the commander found the spy aboard the ship''

Sentences can be treated as objects, and the word &lt;code&gt;'''’e’'''&lt;/code&gt; is placed after the sentence. &lt;code&gt;'''’e’'''&lt;/code&gt; is treated as the object of the next sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.66. Note exception &lt;code&gt;'''neH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''to want''&lt;/ref&gt; The adverbs, indirect objects and locatives of the latter sentence go after the subject, but before the &lt;code&gt;'''’e’'''&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;'''bIpIv ’e’ vItu’'''&lt;/code&gt;
{| style="margin-left:1.4em; text-align:center"
|-
| &lt;code&gt;'''bI'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''pIv'''&lt;/code&gt; ||  || &lt;code&gt;'''’e’'''&lt;/code&gt; ||  || &lt;code&gt;'''vI'''&lt;/code&gt; || -
| &lt;code&gt;'''tu’'''&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| ''you-Ø'' || + || ''to be healthy'' ||  || ''that'' ||  || ''I-it'' || +
| ''observe''
|}
:I observe that you are healthy
:''I see that you're healthy''

== Nouns ==
Klingon has three [[noun class]]es. The first one is living beings with an innate capacity to use language. The second one is body parts (not the body itself) and the third is all other nouns.&lt;ref name="Okrand 1992, p.22"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Klingon has no articles, so the word &lt;code&gt;'''raS''' &lt;/code&gt; ''table'' can mean ''a'' table or ''the'' table. The difference between the two is inferred from context. The suffixes are ordered based on type number; a type 2 suffix goes before a type 3 suffix, but after a type 1 suffix.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;code&gt;'''vengHommeyqoqchajDaq'''&lt;/code&gt;
{| style="margin-left:1.4em; text-align:center"
|- style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace"
| '''veng''' || - || '''Hom''' || - || '''mey''' || - || '''qoq''' || -
| '''chaj''' || - || '''Daq'''
|-
| ''city'' || + || ''(1) diminutive'' || + || ''(2) plural'' || + || ''(3) dubitative'' || +
| ''(4) their'' || + || ''(5) locative''
|}
:in their so-called villages

===Suffixes===
There are five types of noun suffixes. A word cannot have two suffixes of the same type.&lt;ref name="p21"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Type 1 (size, affection) ====
This type has three suffixes:

* The [[augmentative]] suffix&lt;code&gt;'''-’a’'''&lt;/code&gt;,
: &lt;code&gt;'''ghom'''&lt;/code&gt; ''group'' → &lt;code&gt;'''ghom’a’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''crowd''
* The [[diminutive]] suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-Hom'''&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;ref name="p21" /&gt; 
: &lt;code&gt;'''yuQ'''&lt;/code&gt; ''planet'' → &lt;code&gt;'''yuQHom'''&lt;/code&gt; ''planetoid''
* and the endearment suffix '''&lt;code&gt;-oy&lt;/code&gt;'''.
: &lt;code&gt;'''vav'''&lt;/code&gt; ''father'' → &lt;code&gt;'''vavoy'''&lt;/code&gt; ''daddy''
:* If the noun to which the endearment suffix is added ends with a vowel, a glottal stop is inserted between them:&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.174&lt;/ref&gt;
:: &lt;code&gt;'''ghu'''&lt;/code&gt; ''baby'' → &lt;code&gt;'''ghu’oy'''&lt;/code&gt; ''dear baby''

==== Type 2 (plurals) ====
This type of suffix forms plurals. There are three suffixes, one for each noun class.

* {{anchor|-pu7}}The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-pu’'''&lt;/code&gt; is  for beings capable of using language.&lt;ref name="Okrand 1992, p.22" /&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''qetwI’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''runner'' → &lt;code&gt;'''qetwI’pu’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''runners''
*The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-Du’'''&lt;/code&gt; is for body parts,
: &lt;code&gt;'''ghop'''&lt;/code&gt; ''hand'' → &lt;code&gt;'''ghopDu’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''hands''
*The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-mey'''&lt;/code&gt; is used for all other nouns. 
: &lt;code&gt;'''quS'''&lt;/code&gt; ''chair'' → &lt;code&gt;'''quSmey'''&lt;/code&gt; ''chairs''
:*When &lt;code&gt;'''-mey'''&lt;/code&gt; is used for nouns that would normally take &lt;code&gt;'''-pu’'''&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'''-Du’'''&lt;/code&gt;, it carries the connotation of being all over the place.
:: &lt;code&gt;'''ghot'''&lt;/code&gt; ''person'' → &lt;code&gt;'''ghotmey'''&lt;/code&gt; ''people all over the place''
A noun does not require a plural suffix if a pronoun or pronominal prefix serves to indicate that it is plural,&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; or if it is being used in conjunction with a number.&lt;ref name="p55"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Type 3 (accuracy) ====
This type of suffix indicates the speaker's opinion of the applicability of the noun. There are three suffixes:

* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-qoq'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the speaker thinks what they are referencing is not actually represented by the noun. 
: &lt;code&gt;'''QaH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''the help'' → &lt;code&gt;'''QaHqoq'''&lt;/code&gt; ''the so-called help''
* The [[dubitative mood|dubitative]] suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-Hey'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates the speaker is not entirely sure if the object they are referencing is represented by the noun.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.24&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''choH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''change'' → &lt;code&gt;'''choHHey'''&lt;/code&gt; ''apparent change'' 
*The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-na’'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the speaker is entirely sure that the object is represented accurately by the noun.&lt;ref name="p25"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''jup'''&lt;/code&gt; ''friend'' → &lt;code&gt;'''jupna’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''true friend''

==== Type 4 (possession, determiners) ====
This type of suffix indicates possession or specifies which object is referred to. It contains twelve suffixes.

There are ten possession suffixes, indicating who is the possessor of the object, which may be a person. For first- and second-person possessors, there are different forms depending on whether the "object" is a being capable of using language.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
! Possessives&lt;ref name="p25" /&gt;
! 1st-person&lt;br&gt; singular !! 2nd-person&lt;br&gt;singular !! 3rd-person&lt;br&gt;singular !! 1st-person&lt;br&gt;plural !! 2nd-person&lt;br&gt;plural !! 3rd-person&lt;br&gt;plural
|-
! Not capable of using language
| &lt;code&gt;-wIj&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;-lIj&lt;/code&gt;
| rowspan="2" | &lt;code&gt;-Daj&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;-maj&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;-raj&lt;/code&gt;
| rowspan="2" | &lt;code&gt;-chaj&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! Capable of using language
| &lt;code&gt;-wI’&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;-lI’&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;-ma’&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;-ra’&lt;/code&gt;
|}

There are also two determiner suffixes:&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.26&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''-vam'''&lt;/code&gt; ''this'' indicates an object that is nearby or that is being discussed
* &lt;code&gt;'''-vetlh'''&lt;/code&gt; ''that'' indicates an object that is not nearby or that had previously been discussed

Examples:
* Non-language-user possessives: &lt;code&gt;'''nav'''&lt;/code&gt; ''paper'' → &lt;code&gt;'''navwIj'''&lt;/code&gt; ''my paper''
* Language-user possessives: &lt;code&gt;'''qeSwI’pu’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''advisors'' → &lt;code&gt;'''qeSwI’pu’lI’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''your advisors''
*Determiners: &lt;code&gt;'''Soj'''&lt;/code&gt; ''food'' → &lt;code&gt;'''Sojvam'''&lt;/code&gt; ''this food''

==== Type 5 (syntactic role) ====
This type of suffix serves a syntactic role in the sentence. It contains five suffixes.

* The [[locative]] suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-Daq'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates the action of the sentence is taking place in, at or on the noun.&lt;ref name="Okrand 1992, p.27"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.27&lt;/ref&gt; With certain verbs, it indicates motion towards the noun. 
: &lt;code&gt;'''juHmaj'''&lt;/code&gt; ''our home'' → &lt;code&gt;'''juHmajDaq'''&lt;/code&gt; ''in our home''
* The [[ablative case|ablative]] suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-vo’'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the action is taking place away from the noun. Again, with certain verbs, it indicates motion away from the noun.
: &lt;code&gt;'''qoj'''&lt;/code&gt; ''cliff'' → &lt;code&gt;'''qojvo’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''away from the cliff''
* The [[causal case|causal]] suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-mo’'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the action is occurring because of the noun.
: &lt;code&gt;'''ghu’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''situation'' → &lt;code&gt;'''ghu’mo’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''because of the situation''
* The [[dative case|dative]]/[[benefactive case|benefactive]] suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-vaD'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates the indirect object, and/or the noun for which the action has been done.&lt;ref name="Okrand 1992, p.27" /&gt; 
: &lt;code&gt;'''je’wI’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''buyer'' → &lt;code&gt;'''je’wI’vaD'''&lt;/code&gt; ''to/for the buyer''
* The [[Topic–comment|topicalizing]] suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-’e’'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates the topic of the sentence or emphasises the noun in the phrase, and also marks the head noun of a relative clause.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

== Verbs ==
Klingon verbs mark for [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] but not for tense, which is indicated where necessary by context and by time adverbs. Prefixes mark subject and object. There are ten types of suffix, and as  with nouns, a verb can have no more than one suffix of any type. (The tenth type, called ''rovers'', are an exception.) Again as with nouns, the types of suffix must appear in a strict order, indicated by their type number: a type 2 suffix goes before a type 3 suffix, but after a type 1 suffix. A rover suffix can go between any of them.&lt;ref name="p44"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike English, there is no infinitive.&lt;ref name="Okrand 1992, p.33"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation of the verb stem as an infinitive in this article's example sentences is just to show the individual morphemes.

=== Prefixes ===
Klingon verb prefixes mark both the subject and the object.

Prefixes must be present even if the nouns or pronouns they reference are declared explicitly.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.52&lt;/ref&gt; In certain cases with a third person object, a first or second person indirect object can be omitted by using the first and second person object prefixes instead. This is known as the prefix trick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://klingonska.org/canon/1997-06-29a-news.txt |title=Re: Some quick questions... |last=Okrand |first=Marc |last2=Schermerhorn |first2=Neal|date=29 June 1997 |accessdate= 5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples:
* No object: &lt;code&gt;'''Qong'''&lt;/code&gt; ''sleep'' → &lt;code&gt;'''jIQong'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I sleep'' 
* Subject and object: &lt;code&gt;'''nob'''&lt;/code&gt; ''give'' → &lt;code&gt;'''Dunob'''&lt;/code&gt; ''It gives (to) you''
* Imperative: &lt;code&gt;'''laD'''&lt;/code&gt; ''read'' → &lt;code&gt;'''yIlaD'''&lt;/code&gt; ''Read it''

=== Suffixes ===

==== Type 1 (reflexive/reciprocal) ====
This type of suffix forms reflexive verbs. There are two suffixes.

* The [[Reflexive verb|reflexive]] suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-’egh'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the individual subject(s) does/do the action to her/him/itself//themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; 
: &lt;code&gt;'''jIlegh'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I see'' → &lt;code&gt;'''jIlegh’egh'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I see myself''
: &lt;code&gt;'''ma’ang'''&lt;/code&gt; ''We reveal'' → &lt;code&gt;'''ma’ang’egh'''&lt;/code&gt; ''We reveal ourselves (individually)''
* The [[Reciprocal (grammar)|reciprocal]] suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-chuq'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the individual subjects do the action to each other.&lt;ref name="p36"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.36&lt;/ref&gt; Intransitive verbs cannot take this suffix.
: &lt;code&gt;'''Sulegh'''&lt;/code&gt; ''You(pl) see'' → &lt;code&gt;'''Suleghchuq'''&lt;/code&gt; ''You(pl) see each other''

==== Type 2 (volition/necessity) ====
This type of suffix deals with the subject's volition. There are five suffixes.

* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-nIS'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the subject is required to or has the necessity to complete the action.
: &lt;code&gt;'''choja’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''You tell me'' → &lt;code&gt;'''choja’nIS'''&lt;/code&gt; ''You need to tell me''
* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-qang'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the subject is willing to perform the action. 
: &lt;code&gt;'''lungev'''&lt;/code&gt; ''They sell it'' → &lt;code&gt;'''lungevqang'''&lt;/code&gt; ''They are willing to sell it''
* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-rup'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates the subject is prepared to complete the action. 
: &lt;code&gt;'''ghu’ poj'''&lt;/code&gt; ''He/She analyzes the situation'' → &lt;code&gt;'''ghu’ pojrup'''&lt;/code&gt; ''He/She is ready to analyze the situation''
*The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-beH'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the subject has been set up to complete the action. &lt;code&gt;'''-beH'''&lt;/code&gt; is used with devices, whereas &lt;code&gt;'''-rup'''&lt;/code&gt; is used with beings.&lt;ref name="p36" /&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''nagh poj'''&lt;/code&gt; ''It analyzes the rock'' → &lt;code&gt;'''nagh pojbeH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''It is ready to analyze the rock''
* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-vIp'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the subject is afraid to do the action.&lt;ref name="p37"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.37&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''bIQub'''&lt;/code&gt; ''You think'' → &lt;code&gt;'''bIQubvIp'''&lt;/code&gt; ''You are afraid to think''

==== Type 3 ([[inceptive]]/[[inchoative]]) ====
This type of suffix describes the action of the verb. There are two suffixes.

* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-choH'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates a change of state to that indicated by the verb: 
: &lt;code&gt;'''yIt'''&lt;/code&gt; ''He/She/It walks'' → &lt;code&gt;'''yItchoH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''He/She/It starts walking''
: &lt;code&gt;'''Doq'''&lt;/code&gt; ''It is red'' →  &lt;code&gt;'''DoqchoH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''It becomes red''
* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-qa’'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates the action had been stopped, but is now resuming, or that the action is being performed again.&lt;ref name="p37" /&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''yIQIj'''&lt;/code&gt; ''Explain it'' → &lt;code&gt;'''yIQIjqa’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''Re-explain it''

==== Type 4 (causative) ====
There is only one suffix in this category, the [[causative]] suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-moH'''&lt;/code&gt;. This suffix indicates that the subject is causing the object to do something. If the verb to which it is added is transitive, the object becomes the indirect object. Many Klingon words are derived this way. For example, the verb ''to clean'' (&lt;code&gt;'''Say’moH'''&lt;/code&gt;) is derived from the verb ''to be clean'' (&lt;code&gt;'''Say’'''&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;ref name="p38"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.38&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intransitive verb''': 
::&lt;code&gt;'''poS lojmIt.'''&lt;/code&gt;
{| style="margin-left:3.0em; text-align:center"
|-
| &lt;code&gt;'''poS'''&lt;/code&gt; || &amp;nbsp; || &lt;code&gt;'''lojmIt'''&lt;/code&gt;
|-

|-
| ''door'' || &amp;nbsp; || ''to be open'' || + || ''causative'' || &amp;nbsp; || ''person''

:: The person caused the door to be open.
:: ''The person opened the door.''

:: &lt;code&gt;'''paq Danej.'''&lt;/code&gt;
{| style="margin-left:3.0em; text-align:center"
|-
| &lt;code&gt;'''paq'''&lt;/code&gt; ||  || &lt;code&gt;'''Da'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''nej'''&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| book ||  || ''you-it'' || + || ''to look for''

:: You look for the book.
:: ''You look/are looking for the book.''
: Causative form:

{| style="margin-left:3.0em; text-align:center"
|-
| &lt;code&gt;'''paq'''&lt;/code&gt; || || &lt;code&gt;'''qa'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''nej'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''moH'''&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| ''book'' || || ''I-you'' || + || ''to look for'' || + || ''causative''
|}
:: I caused you to look for the book.
:: ''I made you look for the book.''

==== Type 5 (undefined subject; capability) ====
{{anchor|-lu7}}There are two unrelated suffixes in this group. The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-lu’'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates an undefined subject.&lt;ref name="p38" /&gt; The verb prefixes that are normally used for first or second person ''subject'' with third person singular ''object'' are used to indicate first or second person ''object''. The suffix {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;'''-laH'''&lt;/code&gt;}} indicates that the subject is capable of performing the action of the verb.&lt;ref name="p38"/&gt;

Examples:
* &lt;code&gt;'''-lu’'''&lt;/code&gt; without prefix: 
: &lt;code&gt;'''much bejlu’'''&lt;/code&gt;
{| style="margin-left:1.4em; text-align:center"
|-
| &lt;code&gt;'''much'''&lt;/code&gt; ||  || &lt;code&gt;'''bej'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''lu’'''&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| ''presentation'' ||  || ''to watch'' || + || ''indefinite subject''
|}
: ''the presentation is watched'', ''someone watches the presentation'' &lt;ref group="Note"&gt;&lt;code&gt;'''-lu’'''&lt;/code&gt; is not the same thing as the passive voice. &lt;code&gt;'''-lu’'''&lt;/code&gt; makes the subject indefinite, and keeps the object where it would be if it had a subject. Unlike the passive voice, it does not make the subject the [[patient (grammar)|patient]] of the verb, except when using the verb prefixes&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''much bej'''&lt;/code&gt;
: ''He/she watches the presentation''
* &lt;code&gt;'''-lu’'''&lt;/code&gt; with prefix: 
: &lt;code&gt;'''vItlha’lu’'''&lt;/code&gt;
{| style="margin-left:1.4em; text-align:center"
|-
| &lt;code&gt;'''vI'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''tlha’'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''lu’'''&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| I-it || + || chase || + || indefinite subject
|}
: ''I am chased'', ''someone chases me''
: &lt;code&gt;'''vItlha’'''&lt;/code&gt;
: ''I chase it''

* &lt;code&gt;'''-laH'''&lt;/code&gt;:
: &lt;code&gt;'''vIbomlaH'''&lt;/code&gt;
{| style="margin-left:1.4em; text-align:center"
|-
| &lt;code&gt;'''vI'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''bom'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''laH'''&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| I-it || + || sing || + || able to
|}
: ''I can sing it''

==== Type 6 (perfection; uncertainty) ====
This type indicates the speaker's opinion of the action of the verb. There are four suffixes.

* {{anchor|-chu7}} The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-chu’'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the speaker considers the action is done in the best possible manner.
: &lt;code&gt;'''pIQoy'''&lt;/code&gt; ''we hear you'' → &lt;code&gt;'''pIQoychu’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''we hear you clearly''
* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-bej'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the speaker is completely sure the action is occurring. 
: &lt;code&gt;'''bInep'''&lt;/code&gt; ''you lie'' → &lt;code&gt;'''bInepbej'''&lt;/code&gt; ''you definitely lie''
*The [[dubitative mood|dubitative]] suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-law’'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the speaker thinks the action is occurring, but is not sure.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; 
: &lt;code&gt;'''luyaj'''&lt;/code&gt; ''they understand it'' → &lt;code&gt;'''luyajlaw’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''they seem to understand it''
* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-ba’'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the speaker thinks that it is obvious that the action is occurring.&lt;ref name="p175"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.175&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''lupar'''&lt;/code&gt; ''they dislike it'' → &lt;code&gt;'''luparba’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''they obviously dislike it''

==== Type 7 (aspect) ====
This type indicates the verb's [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]. There are four Type 7 suffixes.

Note that aspect is different from tense and independent of it. A "completed" event ([[perfective]] aspect, &lt;code&gt;'''-pu’'''&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'''-ta’'''&lt;/code&gt;) can just as easily be set before, during, or after the time of description (past, present, or future tense), or unspecified for tense. For simplicity, this section says "is completed", not "was, is, or will be completed." (Do not confusive perfective aspect with [[#Type 6 (Perfection; uncertainty)|"perfectly done"]].)

* The [[perfective]] suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-pu’'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that, in the time context of the sentence, the action is completed.
: &lt;code&gt;'''qaS'''&lt;/code&gt; ''It occurs'' → &lt;code&gt;'''qaSpu’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''It has occurred''
: &lt;code&gt;'''vIghor'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I break it'' → &lt;code&gt;'''vIghorpu’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I broke it''
* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-ta’'''&lt;/code&gt; also indicates that the action is completed, and further specifies that it was done on purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''Qu' tur'''&lt;/code&gt; ''She carries out the mission'' → &lt;code&gt;'''Qu' turta’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''She has carried out the mission''
: &lt;code&gt;'''vIghor'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I break it'' → &lt;code&gt;'''vIghorta’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I broke it (on purpose)''
* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-taH'''&lt;/code&gt; indicate that the verb is occurring continuously. 
: &lt;code&gt;'''jItlhuH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I breathe'' → &lt;code&gt;'''jItlhuHtaH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I keep breathing''
*The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-lI’'''&lt;/code&gt; indicate that the verb is occurring continuously, but that it has a definite ending point.&lt;ref name="p42"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; 
: &lt;code&gt;'''vISop'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I eat it'' → &lt;code&gt;'''vISoplI’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I am eating it'' (There is a definite ending point to eating something)

The perfective aspect can also be indicated by the use of the verb form &lt;code&gt;'''rIntaH'''&lt;/code&gt; after the main verb. This carries the connotation of irreversibility.&lt;ref name="p42" /&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''ghorlu’ rIntaH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''It has been broken (and it cannot be mended)''

==== Type 8 (honorific) ====
There is only one suffix in this group, the [[honorific]] suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-neS'''&lt;/code&gt;. It is used when addressing any type of superior, be it social, political, or military, and only when being very polite or having high regard for that person. It is never required.&lt;ref name="p43"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''-neS'''&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;'''qaqIH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I meet you'' → &lt;code&gt;'''qaqIHneS'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I am honoured to meet you''

==== Type 9 (syntactic) ====
Eleven suffixes specify syntactic roles in the sentence.

===== [[Nominalization#With derivational morphology|Nominalizers]] =====
Two suffixes form specific types of noun from a verb.

* {{anchor|-wi7}} The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-wI’'''&lt;/code&gt; is used to form words for [[agent noun|persons]] and things that do something, much as English nouns of the form ''X-er'' can mean either "person who does X" (''listener, baker'') or "thing that does X" (''screwdriver, sprinkler'').&lt;ref name="p44" /&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''’Ij'''&lt;/code&gt; ''to listen'' → &lt;code&gt;'''’IjwI’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''listener''
: &lt;code&gt;'''woch'''&lt;/code&gt; ''to be tall'' → &lt;code&gt;'''wochwI’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''tall person'' or ''tall thing''
: &lt;code&gt;'''jachnISchoH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''to start to need to scream'' → &lt;code&gt;'''jachnISchoHwI’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''someone who starts needing to scream''
* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-ghach'''&lt;/code&gt; is used to form a noun that represents the action of the verb or the quality of the verb. This suffix is usually used with other suffixes and is rarely found alone with the verb stem.&lt;ref name="HQv3n3p10t13"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Okrand |first1 = Marc |last2 = Schoen |first2 = Lawrence M. |date=September 1994 |title= Interview: Okrand on &lt;code&gt;'''-ghach'''&lt;/code&gt;|journal = HolQeD |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=10–13 |publisher = Klingon Language Institute |publication-place = Flourtown, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.176&lt;/ref&gt; 
: &lt;code&gt;'''QallaH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''to be able to swim'' → &lt;code&gt;'''QallaHghach'''&lt;/code&gt; ''the ability to swim''
: &lt;code&gt;'''pIvchoH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''to become healthy'' → &lt;code&gt;'''pIvchoHghach'''&lt;/code&gt; ''becoming healthy''

===== Modals =====
These two suffixes inflect the verb in specific [[grammatical mood]]s.
* The [[interrogative]] suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-’a’'''&lt;/code&gt; is used to form yes–no questions.&lt;ref name="p44" /&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''bIqal'''&lt;/code&gt; ''you are corrupt'' → &lt;code&gt;'''bIqal’a’?'''&lt;/code&gt; ''Are you corrupt?'' 
*The [[optative]] suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-jaj'''&lt;/code&gt; is used to indicate a wish or desire of the speaker.&lt;ref name="p175" /&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''bIQap'''&lt;/code&gt; ''You succeed'' → &lt;code&gt;'''bIQapjaj'''&lt;/code&gt; ''May you succeed''

===== Subordinators =====
The following seven suffixes are used to form [[Dependent clause|subordinate clauses]]. A subordinate clause may go after or before the clause it modifies.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Time'''''
* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-pa’'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the event described in the main clause occurs chronologically before the event of this clause.
: &lt;code&gt;'''jItlheDpa’, HIboQ'''&lt;/code&gt; ''Before I depart, assist me''
: (&lt;code&gt;'''jItlheD'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I depart'', &lt;code&gt;'''HIboQ'''&lt;/code&gt; ''assist me'')
*The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-vIS'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the main clause is occurring at the same time as this clause. It is always used in conjunction with the type-7 suffix continuous suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-taH'''&lt;/code&gt;.
: &lt;code&gt;'''lumtaHvIS, pagh ta’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''He accomplishes nothing while he procrastinates
: (&lt;code&gt;'''lum'''&lt;/code&gt; ''to procrastinate'', &lt;code&gt;'''ta’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''accomplish'', &lt;code&gt;'''pagh'''&lt;/code&gt; ''nothing'')
* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-DI’'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the event of the main clause occurs immediately after the event of this clause is completed.
: &lt;code&gt;'''jImej chocholDI’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''As soon as you approach me, I leave''
: (&lt;code&gt;'''jImej'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I leave'', &lt;code&gt;'''chochol'''&lt;/code&gt; ''you approach me'')

'''''Cause and effect'''''
* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-chugh'''&lt;/code&gt; is used to form [[Conditional sentence|conditionals]].&lt;ref name="p43" /&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''DaSamlaHchugh, DaSuqlaH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''If you can find it, you can take it'' 
: (&lt;code&gt;'''DaSamlaH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''you can find it'', &lt;code&gt;'''DaSuqlaH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''you can acquire (take) it'')
* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-mo’'''&lt;/code&gt; indicates the main clause is occurring because of this clause.&lt;ref name="p175" /&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;'''bI’Ilmo’, qavoq'''&lt;/code&gt; ''Because you are sincere, I trust you''
:(&lt;code&gt;'''bI’Il'''&lt;/code&gt; ''you are sincere'', &lt;code&gt;'''qavoq'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I trust you'')

'''''(Relative and purpose clauses)'''''
* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-bogh'''&lt;/code&gt; is used in relative clauses. Their usage is covered in the [[#Relative clauses|relative clauses]] section.
* The suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-meH'''&lt;/code&gt; is used in purpose clauses.&lt;ref name="p44" /&gt; Their usage is covered in the [[#Purpose clauses|purpose clauses]] section.

==== Rovers ====
This type of suffix is known as a &lt;code&gt;'''lengwI’'''&lt;/code&gt; in Klingon, which is translated as ''rover'' (&lt;code&gt;'''leng'''&lt;/code&gt; ''to wander'' + &lt;code&gt;'''wI’'''&lt;/code&gt;). There are four rovers. These suffixes have no defined position, and can go after the verb stem or after any suffix – even another rover – except after a type-9 suffix or where the result would be meaningless. They modify whatever directly precedes them.

* The rover suffix  &lt;code&gt;'''-be’'''&lt;/code&gt; negates what precedes it but in the imperative mood [[#-Qo7|'''-Qo’''']] is used.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''wInaD'''&lt;/code&gt; ''We praise it'' → &lt;code&gt;'''wInaDbe’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''We do not praise it''
: &lt;code&gt;'''bo’ollaH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''You are able to verify it'' → &lt;code&gt;'''bo’ollaHbe’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''You are not able to verify it''
* {{anchor|-Qo7}} The rover suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-Qo’'''&lt;/code&gt; negates what precedes it in the imperative mood. In the indicative mood it indicates refusal by the subject. It can only be used between verb suffixes of Type 8 and Type 9.&lt;ref name="p47"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.47&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''yIQIp'''&lt;/code&gt; ''Be stupid'' → &lt;code&gt;'''yIQIpQo’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''don't be stupid''
: &lt;code&gt;'''vIlon'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I abandon it'' → &lt;code&gt;'''vIlonQo’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''I refuse to abandon it''
* The rover suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-qu’'''&lt;/code&gt;  emphasises what precedes it.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.48&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''mejqang'''&lt;/code&gt; ''He is willing to leave'' → &lt;code&gt;'''mejqangqu’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''He is really willing to leave''
*The rover suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-Ha’'''&lt;/code&gt; reverses what precedes it; that is, it indicates that the opposite of what precedes it is being done, or that the action is being undone.&lt;ref name="p47" /&gt; If used on a verb that cannot be undone and has no meaningful opposite, it means to perform the action wrongly, not in the proper way, somewhat like the English prefix ''mis-'' in ''misspeak, mistype, misspell'', etc. Unlike the other rovers, it can be placed only just after the stem; its classification in the rover category is attributed to the insistence of fictional Klingon grammarians.&lt;ref name="p49"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.49&lt;/ref&gt; 
: &lt;code&gt;'''yIchu’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''Activate it'' → &lt;code&gt;'''yIchuHa’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''De-activate it''
: &lt;code&gt;'''bolo’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''you (plural) use it'' → &lt;code&gt;'''bolo’Ha’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''you (pl.) misuse it''
: &lt;code&gt;'''bIQuch'''&lt;/code&gt; ''You are happy'' → &lt;code&gt;'''bIQuchHa’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''You are unhappy''

The position of the rover suffixes affects the meaning of the word. Contrast
: &lt;code&gt;'''luSoplaH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''They are able to eat it''
: &lt;code&gt;'''luSoplaH&lt;u&gt;be’&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; ''They are not able to eat it''
: &lt;code&gt;'''luSop&lt;u&gt;be’&lt;/u&gt;laH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''They are able to not eat it'' 
:: (In context, possibly equivalent to ''They can refuse to eat it'')
: &lt;code&gt;'''luSop&lt;u&gt;be’&lt;/u&gt;laH&lt;u&gt;be’&lt;/u&gt;'''&lt;/code&gt; ''They are not able to not eat it'' 
:: (In context, possibly equivalent to ''They cannot refuse to eat it'')

===Pronouns and copula===
Klingon has no verb that corresponds to the verb ''to be''; the concept is expressed using a different grammatical construction. Pronouns can be used as verbs that act as the pronoun plus the verb to be. The pronoun can take verb suffixes, which then modify the pronoun like any other verb. A third-person subject that is not a pronoun must go after the pronoun-verb and carry the type-5 noun suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-’e’'''&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name="p68"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
! Pronouns&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;
! 1st-person&lt;br&gt;singular !! 2nd-person&lt;br&gt;singular !! 3rd-person&lt;br&gt;singular !! 1st-person&lt;br&gt;plural !! 2nd-person&lt;br&gt;plural !! 3rd-person&lt;br&gt;plural
|-
! Capable of using language
| rowspan="2" | &lt;code&gt;jIH&lt;/code&gt;
| rowspan="2" | &lt;code&gt;SoH&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;ghaH&lt;/code&gt;
| rowspan="2" | &lt;code&gt;maH&lt;/code&gt;
| rowspan="2" | &lt;code&gt;tlhIH&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;chaH&lt;/code&gt;
|-
! Not capable of using language
| &lt;code&gt;’oH&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;bIH&lt;/code&gt;
|}

Examples:
* &lt;code&gt;'''qonwI' tlhIH'''&lt;/code&gt; ''You are composers'' &lt;!-- tlhIH already indicates a plural subject, so qonwI' doesn't need -pu' --&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;'''ghojwI’ ghaH HaDwI’’e’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''A studier is a learner''

== Adjectives ==
Klingon does not have adjectives as a distinct part of speech. Instead, many intransitive verbs can be used as adjectives, in which case they follow the noun they modify.
Contrast (&lt;code&gt;'''wep'''&lt;/code&gt; ''coat'', and &lt;code&gt;'''yIQ'''&lt;/code&gt; ''be wet'')
: &lt;code&gt;'''wep yIQ'''&lt;/code&gt;
: ''the wet coat''
with
: &lt;code&gt;'''yIQ wep.'''&lt;/code&gt;
: ''The coat is wet.''

In this construction, the only verbal suffixes allowed are rover suffixes such as &lt;code&gt;'''-qu’'''&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'''-Ha’'''&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.49, says only &lt;code&gt;'''-qu’'''&lt;/code&gt;, but later canon examples expand the set, for example &lt;code&gt;'''ngaDHa’'''&lt;/code&gt; in Okrand 1997, p.150&lt;/ref&gt;
Type-5 ''noun'' suffixes that would normally be attached to the noun are instead attached to the adjectival verb:&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;
; &lt;code&gt;'''pa’Daq'''&lt;/code&gt; 
: ''in the room'' 
; &lt;code&gt;'''pa’ tInDaq'''&lt;/code&gt; 
: ''in the big room'' (&lt;code&gt;'''tIn'''&lt;/code&gt; ''big'')

== Adverbs ==
[[Adverb]]s are usually placed at the beginning of the sentence,&lt;ref name="p56" /&gt; but time adverbs go before other adverbs.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.179&lt;/ref&gt; 

: &lt;code&gt;'''wa'leS ghaytan nujatlh.'''&lt;/code&gt;

{| style="margin-left:1.4em"
|-
| &lt;code&gt;'''wa'les'''&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;'''ghaytan'''&lt;/code&gt; || &lt;code&gt;'''nu'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''jatlh'''&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| ''tomorrow'' || ''likely'' || ''they-us'' || + || ''speak''
|}
: ''They will probably speak to us tomorrow.''

Adverbs can take the rover suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-Ha’'''&lt;/code&gt; to denote the opposite adverbial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Okrand |first1 = Marc  |date=December 1995 |title= More from Maltz |journal = HolQeD |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=11 |publisher = Klingon Language Institute |publication-place = Flourtown, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; &lt;code&gt;'''Do’'''&lt;/code&gt; 
: ''fortunately'' 
; &lt;code&gt;'''Do’Ha’'''&lt;/code&gt; 
: ''unfortunately''

==Conjunctions==
Klingon has seven conjunctions, and they are different for nouns and for sentences. The noun conjunctions are &lt;code&gt;'''je'''&lt;/code&gt; for a [[logical conjunction]], &lt;code&gt;'''joq'''&lt;/code&gt; for a [[logical disjunction]] and &lt;code&gt;'''ghap'''&lt;/code&gt; for an [[exclusive disjunction]]. Noun conjunctions go after the nouns they connect. Sentence conjunctions are &lt;code&gt;'''’ej'''&lt;/code&gt; for a [[logical conjunction]], &lt;code&gt;'''qoj'''&lt;/code&gt; for a [[logical disjunction]] and &lt;code&gt;'''pagh'''&lt;/code&gt; for an [[exclusive disjunction]]. &lt;code&gt;'''’ach'''&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;'''’a'''&lt;/code&gt;) ''but'' is used to contrast sentences.&lt;ref name="p55" /&gt;

== Clauses ==

=== Relative clauses ===
In a relative clause, the verb has the type-9 verb suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-bogh'''&lt;/code&gt; added to it.&lt;ref name="Okrand 1992, p.64"&gt;Okrand 1992, p.64&lt;/ref&gt; The order of the words in relative clauses remains the same as in regular clauses, but the head noun may optionally get the type-5 suffix &lt;code&gt;'''-’e’'''&lt;/code&gt; added.&lt;ref name="HQv4n2p5t6"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Okrand |first1 = Marc |last2 = Schoen |first2 = Lawrence M. |date=June 1995 |title= Interview: Okrand on &lt;code&gt;'''-bogh'''&lt;/code&gt; and more |journal = HolQeD |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=5–6 |publisher = Klingon Language Institute |publication-place = Flourtown, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;code&gt;'''chuS Saj ngevbogh ghot’e’.'''&lt;/code&gt;
{| style="margin-left:1.4em"
|-
| &lt;code&gt;'''chuS'''&lt;/code&gt; ||  || &lt;code&gt;'''Saj'''&lt;/code&gt; ||  || &lt;code&gt;'''ngev'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''bogh'''&lt;/code&gt; || 
| &lt;code&gt;'''ghot'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''-’e’'''&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| ''to be noisy'' ||  || ''pet'' ||  || ''to sell'' || + || ''relative'' || 
| ''person'' || + || ''focus''
|}
: The person who sells the pet is noisy

: &lt;code&gt;'''chuS Saj’e’ ngevbogh ghot.'''&lt;/code&gt;
{| style="margin-left:1.4em; text-align:center"
|-
| &lt;code&gt;'''chuS'''&lt;/code&gt; ||  || &lt;code&gt;'''Saj'''&lt;/code&gt; || + || &lt;code&gt;'''-’e’'''&lt;/code&gt; ||  || &lt;code&gt;'''ngev'''&lt;/code&gt; || -
| &lt;code&gt;'''bogh'''&lt;/code&gt; ||  || &lt;code&gt;'''ghot'''&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| ''to be noisy'' ||  || ''pet'' || + || ''focus'' ||  || ''to sell'' || 
| ''relative'' ||  || ''person''
|}
: The pet which the person sells is noisy

Since there is already a type-5 noun suffix marking the head noun, nothing other than the subject or the object can be marked as head noun. Two sentences are formed instead to form the same idea. Relative clauses can have nouns with type 5 suffixes as modifiers, but it can be ambiguous as they can be misinterpreted as being part of the main sentence.&lt;ref name="HQv4n2p5t6" /&gt;

=== Purpose clauses ===
A purpose clause expresses the reason or goal of the action of the main clause. If it is modifying a noun it states the purpose of the noun. A purpose clause always goes before the clause or noun it modifies.&lt;ref name="Okrand 1992, p.64"/&gt; This is the cause of some grammatical ambiguity in Klingon, as a &lt;code&gt;'''-meH'''&lt;/code&gt; modifying a noun at the beginning of a sentence can be misinterpreted as modifying the entire sentence. This can be resolved in writing with punctuation.&lt;ref name="HQv4n2p5t6" /&gt;

* &lt;code&gt;'''-meH'''&lt;/code&gt; with sentence: &lt;code&gt;'''jumISmoHmeH, jutoj'''&lt;/code&gt;
{| style="text-align:center"
|-
| &lt;code&gt;'''ju'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''mIS'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''moH'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || '''meH,''' || 
| &lt;code&gt;'''ju'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''toj'''&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| ''you-us'' || + || ''to be confused'' || + || ''causative'' || - || ''purpose'' || 
| ''you-us'' || + || ''to trick''
|}
: You tricked us in order to confuse us.
* &lt;code&gt;'''-meH'''&lt;/code&gt; with nouns:  &lt;code&gt;'''QaQ vIDubmeH qechlIj'''&lt;/code&gt;
{| style="text-align:center"
|-
| &lt;code&gt;'''QaQ'''&lt;/code&gt; ||  || &lt;code&gt;'''vI'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''Dub'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''meH'''&lt;/code&gt; || 
| &lt;code&gt;'''qech'''&lt;/code&gt; || - || &lt;code&gt;'''lIj'''&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| ''to be good'' ||  || ''I-it'' || + || ''improve'' || + || ''purpose'' || 
| ''idea'' || + || ''your''
|}
: Your idea [for I improve it] is good
: ''Your idea on how I should improve it is good/Your idea for improving it is good.''

== Comparatives ==
In this section, [[noun phrase]]s are indicated by the abbreviation ''NP'', and adjectives by ''A''.

Klingon [[comparative]]s mainly rely on adjectives like &lt;code&gt;'''law’'''&lt;/code&gt; (''to be many''), &lt;code&gt;'''puS'''&lt;/code&gt; (''to be few''), &lt;code&gt;'''rap'''&lt;/code&gt; (''to be the same''), and &lt;code&gt;'''rur'''&lt;/code&gt; (''to resemble, to be like'')  to contrast the nouns. However, many (but not all) of the comparatives have unusual word orders that don't parse as regular Klingon sentences.

* The main Klingon comparative structure is &lt;u&gt;''NP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; A &lt;code&gt;'''law’'''&lt;/code&gt; NP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; A &lt;code&gt;'''puS'''&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;br&gt;The general meaning of this construction is ''"NP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is more ''A'' than ''NP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;"''.
: &lt;code&gt;'''qachvam chu’ law’ juHlIj chu' puS.'''&lt;/code&gt; ''This building is newer than your home.'' 
: (&lt;code&gt;'''chu’'''&lt;/code&gt; ''to be new'',  &lt;code&gt;'''qachvam'''&lt;/code&gt; ''this building'', &lt;code&gt;'''juHlIj'''&lt;/code&gt; ''your home'')
: literally: ''this-building new many – home-your new few''
* The structure &lt;u&gt;''NP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; A &lt;code&gt;'''law’ Hoch'''&lt;/code&gt; A &lt;code&gt;'''puS'''&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/u&gt; is used to form [[superlative]]s, i.e. &lt;br&gt;"NP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has the most of quality A (= has more of quality A than anything/one else has)". &lt;br&gt;(&lt;code&gt;'''Hoch'''&lt;/code&gt; = ''all, everyone, everything'')
: &lt;code&gt;'''qIDvetlh tlhaQ law' Hoch tlhaQ puS.'''&lt;/code&gt; ''That joke is the funniest.'' 
: (&lt;code&gt;'''tlhaQ'''&lt;/code&gt; ''to be funny'', &lt;code&gt;'''qIDvetlh'''&lt;/code&gt; ''that joke'')
: literally: ''joke-that funny many – everything funny few''
* The inverse structure,  &lt;u&gt;''&lt;code&gt;'''Hoch'''&lt;/code&gt; A &lt;code&gt;'''law’'''&lt;/code&gt; NP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; A &lt;code&gt;'''puS'''&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/u&gt; is used to indicate  &lt;br&gt;"NP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; has the least of quality A".&lt;ref name="Okrand 1992, p.64" /&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;'''Hoch quv law’ verengnan quv puS.'''&lt;/code&gt; ''Ferengi are the least honorable.'' 
: (&lt;code&gt;'''quv'''&lt;/code&gt; ''to be honorable'', &lt;code&gt;'''verengnan'''&lt;/code&gt; ''Ferengi'')
: literally: ''everyone honorable many – Ferengi honorable few''
* The structure  &lt;u&gt;''A NP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; NP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;code&gt;'''rur'''&lt;/code&gt;''&lt;/u&gt; is used to form [[simile]]s: &lt;br&gt;"NP&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is A; he/she/it resembles NP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;".
: &lt;code&gt;'''’IQ rav rur.'''&lt;/code&gt; ''He is as sad as a floor.''&lt;ref&gt;Native Klingon Simile from {{cite book |last=Okrand |first=Marc |authorlink=Marc Okrand |title=Klingon for the Galactic Traveller |publisher=Pocket Books |isbn=978-0671009953 |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: (&lt;code&gt;'''’IQ'''&lt;/code&gt; ''to be sad; he is sad'', &lt;code&gt;'''rav'''&lt;/code&gt; ''floor'', &lt;code&gt;'''rur'''&lt;/code&gt; ''to resemble; he resembles'')
: literally: ''he is sad; he is like a floor''

==Questions==
A yes–no question in Klingon can be formed by adding the suffix {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;'''-’a’'''&lt;/code&gt;}} to the regular form. The word for yes is &lt;code&gt;'''HISlaH'''&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'''HIja’'''&lt;/code&gt; and the word for no is &lt;code&gt;'''ghobe’'''&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name="p68" /&gt; Interrogative pronouns go where the answer would normally go, and don't reorder the sentence. Interrogative adverbs go at the beginning of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numbers==
Klingon uses a base-10 system to count numbers. To form a multiple of 10, 100, 1000, 1000000, the word for the multiple of ten is suffixed to the digit. For example. &lt;code&gt;'''chorghmaH'''&lt;/code&gt; is a combination of the word &lt;code&gt;'''chorgh'''&lt;/code&gt; ''eight'' and the number forming suffix {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;'''-maH'''&lt;/code&gt;}} ''ten''.

Larger powers go before smaller powers: &lt;code&gt;'''chorghmaH Soch'''&lt;/code&gt; is ''eight-ten seven''. The number suffix {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;'''-DIch'''&lt;/code&gt;}} is used to form ordinal numbers, and the number suffix {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;'''-logh'''&lt;/code&gt;}} indicates how many times an action has been repeated: &lt;code&gt;'''loSDIch'''&lt;/code&gt; ''fourth'', &lt;code&gt;'''wa’maH cha’logh'''&lt;/code&gt; ''twelve times''.&lt;ref&gt;Okrand 1992, p.53-55&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15539">'''Language identification in the limit''' is a formal model for [[inductive inference]]. It was introduced by [[E. Mark Gold]] in his paper with the same title.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gold | first1 = E. Mark | year = 1967 | title = Language identification in the limit | journal = Information and Control | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 447–474 | publisher =  | jstor =  | doi = 10.1016/S0019-9958(67)91165-5 | url=http://web.mit.edu/~6.863/www/spring2009/readings/gold67limit.pdf | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this model, a [[learner]] is provided with presentation (i.e. strings) of some [[formal language]]. The learning is seen as an infinite process. Each time an element of the presentation is read the learner should provide a representation (e.g. a [[formal grammar]]) for the language. It is said that a learner can identify in the limit a class of languages if given any presentation of any language in the class the learner will produce only a finite number of wrong representations, and therefore converge on the correct representation in a finite number of steps, without however necessarily being able to announce its correctness since a counterexample to that representation could appear as an element arbitrarily long after.

Gold defined two types of presentations:
* Text (positive information): an enumeration of all strings the language consists of.
* Complete presentation (positive and negative information): an enumeration of all possible strings, each with a label indicating if the string belongs to the language or not.

==Learnability==
This model is an early attempt to formally capture the notion of [[learnability]].
Gold's paper&lt;ref&gt;p.457&lt;/ref&gt; introduces for contrast the stronger models
* ''Finite identification'' (where the learner has to announce correctness after a finite number of steps), and 
* ''Fixed-time identification'' (where correctness has to be reached after an apriori-specified number of steps).
A weaker formal model of learnability is the ''[[Probably approximately correct learning]] (PAC)'' model, introduced by [[Leslie Valiant]] in 1984.

It is instructive to look at concrete examples (in the tables) of learning sessions the definition of identification in the limit speaks about.
# A fictitious session to learn a [[regular language]] ''L'' over the [[Formal language#Words over an alphabet|alphabet]] {''a'',''b''} from '''text presentation'''. In each step, the teacher gives a string belonging to ''L'', and the learner answers a guess for ''L'', encoded as a [[regular expression]]. In step '''3''', the learner's guess is not consistent with the strings seen so far; in step '''4''', the teacher gives a string repeatedly. After step '''6''', the learner sticks to the regular expression (''ab''+''ba'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. If this happens to be a description of the language ''L'' the teacher has in mind, it is said that the learner has learned that language. If a computer program for the learner's role would exist that was able to successfully learn each regular language, that class of languages would be ''identifiable in the limit''. Gold has shown that this is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;Theorem I.8,I.9, p.470-471&lt;/ref&gt;
# A particular learning algorithm always '''guessing''' ''L'' to be just '''the union of all strings seen so far'''. If ''L'' is a finite language, the learner will eventually guess it correctly, however, without being able to tell when. Although the guess didn't change during step '''3''' to '''6''', the learner couldn't be sure to be correct. Gold has shown that the class of finite languages is identifiable in the limit,&lt;ref&gt;Theorem I.6, p.469&lt;/ref&gt; however, this class is neither finitely nor fixed-time identifiable.
# Learning from '''complete presentation by telling'''. In each step, the teacher gives a string and tells whether it belongs to ''L'' ({{color|green|green}}) or not ({{color|red|&lt;s&gt;red, struck-out&lt;/s&gt;}}). Each possible string is eventually classified in this way by the teacher.
# Learning from '''complete presentation by request'''. The learner gives a query string, the teacher tell whether it belongs to ''L'' ({{color|green|yes}}) or not ({{color|red|no}}); the learner then gives a guess for ''L'', followed by the next query string. In this example, the learner happens to query in each step just the same string as given by the teacher in example 3. In general, Gold has shown that each language class identifiable  in the request-presentation setting is also identifiable in the telling-presentation setting,&lt;ref&gt;Theorem I.3, p.467&lt;/ref&gt; since the learner, instead of querying a string, just needs to wait until it is eventually given by the teacher.

==Learnability characterization==
[[Dana Angluin]] gave the characterizations of learnability from text (positive information) in a 1980 paper. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Dana Angluin| title=Inductive Inference of Formal Languages from Positive Data| journal=Information and Control| year=1980| volume=45| pages=117–135| doi=10.1016/S0019-9958(80)90285-5| url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~yinw/papers/Angluin80.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If a learner is required to be [[effective]], then an indexed class of [[recursive language]]s is learnable in the limit if there is an effective procedure that uniformly enumerates ''tell-tales'' for each language in the class (Condition 1).&lt;ref name="Angluin.1980a.Cond1"&gt;p.121 top&lt;/ref&gt; It is not hard to see that if an ideal learner (i.e., an arbitrary function) is allowed, then an indexed class of languages is learnable in the limit if each language in the class has a tell-tale (Condition 2).&lt;ref&gt;p.123 top&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language classes learnable in the limit==

{| class="wikitable" style="float: right"
|+ Dividing lines between identifiable and nonidentifiable language classes&lt;ref&gt;Table 1, p.452, in (Gold 1967)&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
! Learnability model !! Class of languages
|-
| colspan="2" | Anomalous text presentation&lt;ref group=note name="anomalous text"&gt;i.e. text presentation, where the string given by the teacher is a [[primitive recursive function]] of the current step number, and the learner encodes a language guess as a [[Recursively enumerable|program that enumerates the language]]&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| || [[Recursively enumerable]]
|-
| || [[Recursive set|Recursive]]
|-
| colspan="2" | Complete presentation
|-
| || Primitive recursive&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e. the class of languages that are [[decision problem|decidable]] by [[primitive recursive]] functions&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| || [[Context-sensitive language|Context-sensitive]]
|-
| || [[Context-free]]
|-
| || [[Regular language|Regular]]
|-
| || Superfinite&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e. containing all finite languages and at least one infinite one&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| colspan="2" | Normal text presentation&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e. text presentation, except for the anomalous text presentation setting&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| || Finite
|-
| || Singleton&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e. the class of languages consisting of a single string (they are mentioned here only as a common lower bound to finite languages and pattern languages)&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

The table shows which language classes are identifiable in the limit in which learning model. On the right-hand side, each language class is a superclass of all lower classes. Each learning model (i.e. type of presentation) can identify in the limit all classes below it. In particular, the class of finite languages is identifiable in the limit by text presentation (cf. Example 2 [[#Examples|above]]), while the class of regular languages is not.

''[[Pattern language (formal languages)|Pattern Languages]]'', introduced by Dana Angluin in another 1980 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Dana Angluin| title=Finding Patterns Common to a Set of Strings| journal=Journal of Computer and System Sciences| year=1980| volume=21| pages=46–62| doi=10.1016/0022-0000(80)90041-0| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022000080900410/pdf?md5=c3534f6c086df22fbf814b12984fab5e&amp;pid=1-s2.0-0022000080900410-main.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; are also identifiable by normal text presentation; they are omitted in the table, since they are above the singleton and below the primitive recursive language class, but incomparable to the classes in between.&lt;ref group=note&gt;incomparable to regular and to context-free language class: Theorem 3.10, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=I'm not quite sure about context-sensitive and primitive recursive languages; please cross-check.|date=October 2013}}

==Sufficient conditions for learnability==
Condition 1 in Angluin's paper&lt;ref name="Angluin.1980a.Cond1"/&gt; is not always easy to verify. Therefore, people come up with various sufficient conditions for the learnability of a language class. See also ''[[Induction of regular languages]]'' for learnable subclasses of regular languages.

===Finite thickness===
A class of languages has '''finite thickness''' if every non-empty set of strings is contained in at most finitely many languages of the class. This is exactly Condition 3 in Angluin's paper.&lt;ref&gt;p.123 mid&lt;/ref&gt; Angluin showed that if a class of [[recursive language]]s has finite thickness, then it is learnable in the limit.&lt;ref&gt;p.123 bot, Corollary 2&lt;/ref&gt;

A class with finite thickness certainly satisfies [[MEF-condition]] and [[MFF-condition]]; in other words, finite thickness implies [[M-finite thickness]].&lt;ref name="Ambainis.Jain.Sharma.1997.Cor29"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andris Ambainis |author2=Sanjay Jain |author3=Arun Sharma | chapter=Ordinal mind change complexity of language identification| title=Computational Learning Theory| year=1997| volume=1208| pages=301–315| publisher=Springer| series=LNCS| url=http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~sanjay/paps/efs2.pdf}}; here: Proof of Corollary 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finite elasticity===
A class of languages is said to have '''finite elasticity''' if for every infinite sequence of strings &lt;math&gt;s_0, s_1, ...&lt;/math&gt; and every infinite sequence of languages in the class &lt;math&gt;L_1, L_2, ...&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a finite number n such that &lt;math&gt;s_n\not\in L_n&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;L_n&lt;/math&gt; is inconsistent with &lt;math&gt;\{s_1,...,s_{n-1}\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Motoki.Shinohara.Wright.1991"/&gt;

It is shown that a class of [[recursively enumerable]] languages is learnable in the limit if it has finite elasticity.

==Mind change bound==
A bound over the number of hypothesis changes that occur before convergence.

==Other concepts==

===Infinite cross property===
A language L has '''infinite cross property''' within a class of languages &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; if there is an infinite sequence &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt; of distinct languages in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; and a sequence of finite subset &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; such that:
*&lt;math&gt;T_1 \sub T_2\sub ...&lt;/math&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;T_i \in L_i&lt;/math&gt;,
*&lt;math&gt;T_{i+1}\not\in L_i&lt;/math&gt;, and
*&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n=\infty}T_i=L&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that L is not necessarily a member of the class of language.

It is not hard to see that if there is a language with infinite cross property within a class of languages, then that class of languages has infinite elasticity.

==Relations between concepts==
*Finite thickness implies finite elasticity;&lt;ref name="Ambainis.Jain.Sharma.1997.Cor29"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|Wright, Keith (1989) "Identification of Unions of Languages Drawn from an Identifiable Class". Proc. 2nd Workwhop on Computational Learning Theory, 328-333; with correction in:&lt;ref name="Motoki.Shinohara.Wright.1991"&gt;Motoki, Shinohara, and Wright (1991) [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Takeshi_Shinohara/publication/31900621_Correct_Definition_of_Finite_Elasticity/links/541763930cf2218008bee4d6.pdf?inViewer=true&amp;disableCoverPage=true&amp;origin=publication_detail "The correct definition of finite elasiticity: corrigendum to identification of unions"], Proc. 4th Workshop on Computational Learning Theory, 375-375&lt;/ref&gt;}} the converse is not true.
*Finite elasticity and [[conservatively learnable]] implies the existence of a mind change bound. [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/context/1042497/0]
*Finite elasticity and [[M-finite thickness]] implies the existence of a mind change bound. However, [[M-finite thickness]] alone does not imply the existence of a mind change bound; neither does the existence of a mind change bound imply [[M-finite thickness]]. [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/context/1042497/0]
*Existence of a mind change bound implies learnability; the converse is not true.
*If we allow for noncomputable learners, then finite elasticity implies the existence of a mind change bound; the converse is not true.
*If there is no [[accumulation order]] for a class of languages, then there is a language (not necessarily in the class) that has infinite cross property within the class, which in turn implies infinite elasticity of the class.

==Open questions==
*If a countable class of recursive languages has a mind change bound for noncomputable learners, does the class also have a mind change bound for computable learners, or is the class unlearnable by a computable learner?

{{wiktionary}}
'''Leaktivism''' is defined as the action of distributing confidential documents to the public in an attempt to directly impact the socio-economic and political spheres. The term Leaktivism was popularized by [[Micah M. White|Micah White]], the co-founder of the [[Occupy movement]], in relation to the [[Panama Papers]].

==Background of Leaktivism: The Panama Papers==

[[Panama Papers|The Panama Papers]] are a collection of 11.5m leaked files from one of the world’s largest law firms, [[Mossack Fonseca]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/03/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-panama-papers|title=What are the Panama Papers? A guide to history's biggest data leak|last=Harding|first=Luke|date=2016-04-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-20|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; A German newspaper called [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] was able to obtain the database from an anonymous source. The different files demonstrated the manner in which the different wealthy individuals are able to take advantage of secrete offshore tax regimes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Twelve national leaders are included among the 143 politicians impacted within the leak.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Russian president, Pakistan's prime minister, the former Vice-President of Iraq, the President of Ukraine, the father of the British Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister of Iceland are some of the politicians that were incriminated by the leak.

The information leaked in regards to the [[Panama Papers]] is considered one of the largest leaks in history. This leak is considered to be larger than both the US diplomatic cables distributed by [[WikiLeaks]] in 2010 and the secrete intelligence documents released by [[Edward Snowden]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In total there 11.5m documents along with 2.6 terabytes of information taken from the [[Mossack Fonseca]]’s internal database.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Establishment of Leaktivism==

[[Micah M. White|Micah White]] is the co-founder of Occupy and a democratic activist. His article in [[the Guardian]] states that the [[Panama Papers]] illustrate the rising of leaktivism. He argues that the [[Panama Papers]] show that leaking information can be an impactful form of protest.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/commentisfree/2016/apr/05/panama-papers-leak-activism-leaktivism|title=The Panama Papers: leaktivism's coming of age|last=White|first=Micah|date=2016-04-05|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-20|last2=Occupy|first2=co-founder of|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; White argues that the leaks have the ability to destabilize numerous governments throughout the globe, impacting the credibility of powerful world leaders.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

White states that the [[Panama Papers]] have resulted in positive social change. He uses the example of the Prime Minister from Iceland, who was forced to resign from his position. However, he does argue that while the resignation of some corrupt political leaders is progress, it does not solve the larger problem; namely, that our world is being run by the top 1%.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He says that individuals must go beyond traditional activism and try different methods of protest, developing the manner in which our society protests in relation to the technology that is developing.

White concludes his article by stating that the main problem that the [[Panama Papers]] illustrates is a questions concerning the governance of our world. The leak demonstrates who is actually in power. He further argues that the distribution of the papers will only be successful if it bring upon change."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Liwayway A. Arceo''' (1920–1999) was a multi-awarded [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] fictionist, journalist, radio scriptwriter and editor from the [[Philippines]].

Arceo authored a number of well-received novels, such as ''[[Canal de la Reina]]'' (1973) and ''[[Titser (novel)|Titser]]'' (1995). She also published collections of short stories such as ''Ina, Maybahay, Anak at iba pa'', ''Mga Maria, Mga Eva'', ''Ang Mag-anak na Cruz'' (1990), and ''Mga Kuwento ng Pag-ibig'' (1997). Most of her books were published by [[Ateneo de Manila University]] Press and The [[University of the Philippines]] Press. Arceo's story, ''Uhaw ang Tigang na Lupa'' was placed second in the Japanese Imperial Government-sanctioned Pinakamabuting Maikling Katha ng 1943 (The Best Short Stories of 1943).

Arceo made her mark as a lead actress in ''[[Tatlong Maria]]'', a Japanese/Philippine film produced during [[World War II]]. The film was produced by two movie companies; [[X'Otic Pictures]] of the [[Philippines]] and [[Eiga Hekusa]] of Japan, in 1944. She also acted in ''[[Ilaw ng Tahanan]]'', a long-running radio serial. ''Ilaw ng Tahanan'' became a television soap opera aired on RPN 9, during the late 1970s.

Arceo's short story ''Lumapit, Lumayo ang Umaga'' was later turned into an award-winning film by National Artist [[Ishmael Bernal]] in 1975. Filipina thespian [[Elizabeth Oropesa]] received a FAMAS Best Actress Award in 1976 for her role in the film.

Arceo received a Carlos [[Palanca Awards|Palanca Award]] for Short Story in Filipino (Filipino (Tagalog) Division) in 1962; a [[Japan Foundation]] Visiting Fellowship in 1992; a Gawad CCP for Literature given by the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] in 1993; a Doctorate on Humane Letters, an ''honoris causa'', from the [[University of the Philippines]] in 1991; the Catholic Authors Award from the Asian Catholic Publishers in 1990, and the Gawad Balagtas Life Achievement Award for Fiction from the Unyon ng mga Manunulat sa Pilipinas (Writers Union of the Philippines, or UMPIL) in 1998. In 1999, Liwayway Arceo received a Philippine National Centennial Commission award for her pioneering and exemplary contributions in the field of literature.

After her death, Filipino writers paid tribute to Liwayway A. Arceo during a memorial service held at the Loyola Memorial Chapel in Guadalupe, Makati City, Philippines on December 6, 1999.

'''Marjane Satrapi''' ({{lang-fa|مرجان ساتراپی}}) (born 22 November 1969) is an Iranian-born French&lt;ref name ="abusdecine"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="lesechos" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Marjane Satrapi|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/18/AR2008011800888.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date =20 January 2008|access-date =10 February 2016|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[graphic novelist]], [[cartoonist]], [[illustrator]], [[film director]], and [[Children's literature|children's book]] author.

==Biography==
Satrapi was born in [[Rasht]], Iran.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/29/biography&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in [[Tehran]] in a middle-class Iranian family.&lt;ref name=Hattenstone2008&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Hattenstone |first1=Simon |date=29 March 2008 |title=Confessions of Miss Mischief |journal=The Guardian |url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/departments/biography/story/0,,2268725,00.html |accessdate=7 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both her parents were politically active and supported [[Marxist]] causes against the monarchy of [[Shah Reza Pahlavi|the last Shah]]. When the [[Iranian Revolution]] took place in 1979, they were dismayed and intimidated by the [[Muslim fundamentalists]] who took power.&lt;ref name="Hattenstone2008" /&gt;

During her youth, Marjane was exposed to the growing brutalities of the various regimes. Many of her family friends were persecuted, arrested, and even murdered. She found a hero in her paternal uncle, Anoosh, who had been a political prisoner and lived in exile in the [[Soviet Union]] for a time. Young Marjane greatly admired her uncle, and he in turn doted on her, treating her like a daughter. Tragically, as detailed in Satrapi's autobiography, Anoosh was arrested again and executed; his body was buried in an unmarked grave in the prison. Anoosh was only allowed one visitor before his execution, and he requested Marjane. The loss of her uncle left her deeply upset. As a young teen, Marjane began to act out, getting into trouble with the police for breaking modesty codes and buying music banned by the regime.

Her parents grew concerned that Marjane, a strong-willed and rambunctious teenager, would run afoul of the strict new public codes for women.&lt;ref name="Hattenstone2008" /&gt; They arranged for her to study abroad, and in 1983 she arrived in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], to attend the [[Lycée Français de Vienne]].&lt;ref&gt;Bédarida, Catherine. "[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/809646.html Marjane Satrapi dessine la vie de l'Iran]." ''[[Le Monde]]''. 25 June 2003. Retrieved on 21 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to her [[autobiographical graphic novel]] ''[[Persepolis (comics)|Persepolis]]'', she stayed in Vienna through her high-school years, sometimes staying at friends' homes but for three months living on the streets. After an almost deadly bout of [[pneumonia]], she returned to Iran. She studied visual communication, eventually obtaining a master's degree from [[Islamic Azad University]] in Tehran.&lt;ref name=Schroeder2010&gt;{{Cite book|author=Heather Lee Schroeder|title=A Reader's Guide to Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eNxkRT5sWBsC&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=6 September 2011|year=2010|publisher=Enslow Publishers, Inc.|isbn=978-0-7660-3166-1|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, Satrapi went to illegal parties hosted by her friends, where she met a man named Reza, a veteran of the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. She married him at the age of 21, but they divorced a couple of years later. Satrapi then moved to [[Strasbourg]], France.

Satrapi is married to Mattias Ripa, a Swedish national. They live in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=Hattenstone2008 /&gt; Apart from her native language, [[Persian language|Persian]], she speaks French, English, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], German, and Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ulib.csuohio.edu/cr08/author.html |title=Author Bio: Marjane Satrapi |year=2011 |publisher=Michael Schwartz Library: [[Cleveland State University]] |accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Graphic novels===
Satrapi became famous worldwide because of her critically acclaimed autobiographical [[comics|graphic novels]], originally published in French in four parts in 2000–2003 and in English translation in two parts in 2003 and 2004, respectively, as ''[[Persepolis (comics)|Persepolis and Persepolis 2]]'', which describe her childhood in Iran and her adolescence in Europe. ''Persepolis'' won the ''[[Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for First Comic Book|Angoulême ''Coup de Coeur'' Award]]'' at the [[Angoulême International Comics Festival]]. Her later publication, ''[[Embroideries (comics)|Embroideries]]'' (''Broderies''), was also nominated for the [[Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for Best Album|Angoulême Album of the Year]] award in 2003, an award that her novel ''[[Chicken with Plums]]'' (''Poulet aux prunes'') won.&lt;ref name="Angoulême 2003 nominees"&gt;{{cite web | last = | title = Les nominés d'Angoulême 2003 |language=French| date = 10 December 2003  |publisher=ActuaBD | url =http://www.actuabd.com/spip.php?article1006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anglôueme 2005"&gt;{{cite web | last =BDParadisio | title =32ème Festival International D'Angouleme |language=French | url =http://www.bdparadisio.com/angou2005/angou2005.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also contributed to the [[Op-Ed]] section of ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="NYTOP"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Satrapi |first1=Marjane |date= |title=Op-Ed contributors search |journal=The New York Times |publisher= |volume= |issue= |page= |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/contributors/?match=any&amp;query=Satrapi&amp;submit.x=17&amp;submit.y=8&amp;submit=Search |accessdate=6 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Comics Alliance]] listed Satrapi as one of 12 women cartoonists deserving of lifetime achievement recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=12 Women in Comics Who Deserve Lifetime Achievement Recognition |url=http://comicsalliance.com/women-lifetime-achievement-awards/ |website=Comics Alliance |access-date=10 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801110216/http://comicsalliance.com/women-lifetime-achievement-awards/ |archivedate=1 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satrapi prefers the term "comic books" to "graphic novels."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Marjane Satrapi: the Persepolis director escapes her comfort zone|url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/20/marjane-satrapi-the-voices|newspaper = The Guardian|date =20 March 2015|access-date =10 February 2016|issn = 0261-3077|language = en-GB|first = Ryan|last = Gilbey}}&lt;/ref&gt; "People are so afraid to say the word 'comic'," she told the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper in 2011. "It makes you think of a grown man with pimples, a ponytail and a big belly. Change it to 'graphic novel' and that disappears.

===Films===
[[File:Marjane Satrapi mg 7536.jpg|thumb|Marjane Satrapi at the [[premiere]] of ''[[Persepolis (film)|Persepolis]]'']]
''Persepolis'' was adapted into an animated [[Persepolis (film)|film of the same name]]. It debuted at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]] in May 2007 and shared a Special Jury Prize with [[Carlos Reygadas]]'s ''[[Silent Light]]'' (''Luz silenciosa'').&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4434938/year/2007.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Persepolis |accessdate=20 December 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-written and co-directed by Satrapi and director [[Vincent Paronnaud]], the French-language picture stars the voices of [[Chiara Mastroianni]], [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Danielle Darrieux]], and [[Simon Abkarian]]. The English version, starring the voices of [[Gena Rowlands]], [[Sean Penn]], and [[Iggy Pop]], was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] in January 2008.&lt;ref name=NYTPick2008&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= |first1= |year=2008 |title=Persepolis (2007) NYT Critics' Pick |journal=The New York Times |publisher= |volume= |issue= |page= |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/351485/Persepolis/details |accessdate=6 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Satrapi was the first woman to be nominated for the award.

''Persepolis'' was a very successful film both commercially (with over a million admissions in France alone) as well as critically, winning Best First Film at the [[César Awards 2008]]. The film reflects many tendencies of first-time filmmaking in France (which makes up around 40% of all French cinema each year), notably in its focus on very intimate rites of passage, and quite ambivalently recounted coming-of-age moments.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Tim (2011). ''Brutal Intimacy: Analyzing Contemporary French Cinema'', Wesleyan University Press, Middleton CT. {{ISBN|0-8195-6827-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Satrapi and Paronnaud continued their successful collaboration with a second film, a live-action adaptation of [[Chicken with Plums (film)|''Chicken with Plums'']], released in late 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=136634.html|title=Poulet aux prunes|language=French|work=[[AlloCiné]]|publisher=Tiger Global|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/chicken-plums-venice-film-review-231022 |title=Chicken with Plums: Venice Film Review |last = Young | first = Deborah |work=Hollywood Reporter |accessdate=6 September 2011 |date=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Satrapi directed and acted in the comedy crime film ''[[Gang of the Jotas]]'', from her own screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fangoria.com/new/qa-the-voices-director-marjane-satrapi-on-talking-animals-and-a-sympathetic-psychopath/ Q&amp;A: “THE VOICES” Director Marjane Satrapi on Talking Animals and a Sympathetic Psychopath]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = The Gang of the Jotas|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2459758/|date =6 February 2013|accessdate =10 February 2016|first = Marjane|last = Satrapi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Satrapi directed the comedy-horror film ''[[The Voices (film)|The Voices]]'', from a screenplay by [[Michael R. Perry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New Stills Hear The Voices - Dread Central|url = http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/85301/new-stills-hear-voices/|website = Dread Central|access-date =10 February 2016|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public appearances===
Following the Iranian elections in June 2009, Satrapi and Iranian filmmaker [[Mohsen Makhmalbaf]] appeared before Green Party members in the European Parliament to present a document allegedly received from a member of the Iranian electoral commission claiming that the reform candidate, [[Mir Hossein Mousavi]], had actually won the election, and that the conservative incumbent [[Mahmoud Ahmedinejad]] had received only 12% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kellogg |first1=Carolyn |date=16 June 2009 |title=Iranian author Marjane Satrapi speaks out about election |journal=The Los Angeles Times |publisher=Tribune Company |volume= |issue= |page= |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/jacketcopy/2009/06/iranian-author-marjane-satrapi-speaks-out-about-election.html |accessdate=6 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mendel Elefant''' (also '''Emanuel Elefant''', Yiddish: '''מענדל עלעפאנט''', September 6, 1906– 1942?) was a Jewish Romanian/Czechoslovakian [[Yiddish language|Yiddish-language]] poet, writer, artist &amp; Journalist.

==Biography==
Mendel was born in the town of [[Vișeu de Sus]], [[Romania]], which was then within the borders of [[Austria-Hungary]]. The son of Rabbi [[Dov Berish Elefant]] and his wife Bava Elefant (née Eisenberger). His father was a Rabbi and a Dayan (religious judge), was fluent in 11 languages,&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Chaim Hirsch Manheimmer, [https://lccn.loc.gov/2001321392  Ein Habdolach], NYC: Zecharya Elefant, 1944, pp. 1-6 (preface).&lt;/ref&gt; and was a bank manager for many years. His mother, Bava, was a businesswoman, and was the mother of 16 children, while some children died at an early age. When Mendel was 11 years old his mother died from a rare illness, and his father remarried.

Mendel studied at the local [[Talmud Torah]] at [[Vișeu de Sus]], and continued on to study at the Yeshivot  of Northern Romania and Czechoslovakia, one of them being the Yeshiva of Siget. During his adult years he moved to [[Czechoslovakia]] and lived there.
During the 1920s, Mendel immigrated to [[Brazil]], to the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]], in order to save money towards his upcoming marriage with his fiancée, whom he married upon his return to [[Czechoslovakia]]. While in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Mendel published poems and literary articles in local journals and newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Malamud, Shmuel. [https://lccn.loc.gov/82168572 In Ondenk fun Praça Onze : A Kapitel Zichroines Fun Di Zvangziker Yurn], Rio de Janeiro : Yiddishe Presse, 1981, pp. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Czechoslovakia, between the two world wars, Mendel worked as a journalist in Yiddish Newspapers in the cities of [[Munkács]] and [[Košice]].

In 1929 Mendel was the editor of a literary weekly named "Der Fackl" &lt;ref&gt;[http://primo.nli.org.il/primo_library/libweb/action/dlDisplay.do?vid=NLI&amp;docId=NNL-Journals001795766 דער פאקל: וואכנבלאט פאר ליטעראטור און געזעלשאפטלעכע ענינים: דערשיינט יעדן דאנערשטיק. קאשיצע: מענדל עלעפאנט, 1929]&lt;/ref&gt; that appeared in [[Košice]]. Additionally, he edited another weekly named "Der Kantshik",&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleph.nli.org.il:80/F/?func=direct&amp;doc_number=002162513&amp;local_base=NNLALL  דער קאנטשיק: וואכנבלאט פאר הומאר און סאטירע אין ווארט און אין בילד. קאשיצע: מנדל עלעפאנט]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1933 he became the editor of "Dus Yiddishe Vort"&lt;ref&gt;Sándor Scheiber, [https://lccn.loc.gov/94142305 Magyar zsidó hírlapok és folyóiratok bibliográfiája(= Bibliography of Hungarian Jewish newspapers and journals)], Budapest : MTA Judaisztikai Kutatócsoport, 1993, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Košice]], named in Hungarian "zsidó szó", which was well-known at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=AQM_AQAAIAAJ&amp;q Previously unexplored sources on the Holocaust in Hungary: a selection from Jewish periodicals, 1930-1944"], Jerusalem: International Institute for Holocaust Research, Yad Vashem, 2007, pp. 28-35, discussing at length the history of Emanuel Elefant and the newspaper and its journalistic battles with other rival newspapers in the city.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1930s, Mendel was a journalist in the city of [[Lvov]] in [[Poland]], at a local Yiddish newspaper.

During the Nazi invasion and the outbreak of [[World War II]], Mendel was on a mission in [[Warsaw]] and fled towards Lithuania. His wife and child in Lvov fled to Lithuania as well, and they were reunited in [[Vilna]]. Mendel had been walking in the snow for a long period of time, he developed gangrene and once he arrived in Vilna - the doctors had to amputate his toes, among other things.

Later, his health continued to deteriorate, and he couldn't continue to run and was caught by the Germans. The year of death is estimated at 1942.

His wife, Ilonka Elefant, and his young son who was approximately 10 years old (known fondly as "Pindichku"), continued to run until they were eventually intercepted by the Germans and were taken to a [[concentration camp]]. Upon arrival at the camp, a Nazi officer noticed the boy who was very handsome and had light blonde hair and blue eyes, and was a talented violinist. He took the boy to his house as a companion for his own son who was his age.

Ilonka Elefant perished in the camps, but managed to smuggle out a letter to her sister in hiding through a non-Jewish woman who worked at the camp every day, telling her what had befallen her son.and asking that she find him once the opportunity arose.

After the War, Ilonka's sister went to wealthy relatives in South America and they hired private investigators who were able to trace this Nazi Officer from camp to camp, but ultimately lost track of him when the war ended and the camps dissolved.  No one knows what happened to the child, and it was assumed that the Nazi officer had eventually killed him.

'''Meru''' is the language spoken by the [[Meru people]] (''Ameru'') who live on the Eastern and Northern slopes of [[Mount Kenya]], [[Kenya]], [[Africa]] and on the Nyambene ranges. They settled in this area after centuries of [[Human migration|migration]] from the north.

The Meru people are a fairly homogeneous community and all share a common [[ancestry]]. They speak the same language, ''Kimeru'', but there are some slight regional differences, in accent and local words. The community comprises the following subdivisions; from the north to south:
*Igembe
*Tigania (Tiania) ([[culture]] close to neighbouring [[Cushitic]] and [[Nilotic]] communities)
*Imenti
*Tharaka (Saraka)
*Igoji
*Mwimbi–Muthambi
*Chuka (Gicuka) (marginal intelligibility with Meru proper and with [[Gikuyu language|Gikuyu]].

As the Meru language is similar to its surrounding neighbors, the [[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]] and [[Embu language|Embu]] could have possibly adopted parts of Meru.

A '''morgue file''' originally was the paper-[[File folder|folders]] containing old files and notes that were kept by criminal investigators, and old article clippings kept by [[newspaper]] [[Journalist|reporters]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=81709 The Lone Wolf and His Lady (1949)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=u-MoClX5HgAC&amp;pg=PA250&amp;lpg=PA250&amp;dq=%22morgue+file%22+-free&amp;source=web&amp;ots=FCADFIxktT&amp;sig=dk6GQtalpnDScWofsa-TxKll_nU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ct=result The Process of Investigation ... - Google Book Search]&lt;/ref&gt; in case they became of later use as a quick-reference. 

In modern usage, its scope has expanded to cover many post-production materials for use of reference, or an inactive job file. The term is popular in the newspaper business to describe the file that holds past issues flats. The term has also been used by illustrators, comic book artists, designers and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://papercuts.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/08/24/stray-questions-for-daniel-clowes/ Stray Questions for: Daniel Clowes - Paper Cuts Blog - NYTimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trumanlibrary.org/hstpaper/congquart.htm Truman Library - Congressional Quarterly Records] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720173822/http://www.trumanlibrary.org/hstpaper/congquart.htm |date=2008-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jduerr.com/notes/must-have-for-every-designer/ "A Must-Have Tool For Every Designer"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stevenclark.com.au/2007/09/12/design-technique-17-morgue-file/ "Design Technique 17: Morgue File"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105044316/http://stevenclark.com.au/2007/09/12/design-technique-17-morgue-file/ |date=2007-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Musical languages''' are [[constructed languages]] based on [[music]]al sounds, which tend to incorporate [[articulation (music)|articulation]].  Unlike [[tonal language]]s and [[whistled language]]s where pitches and length are both undefined and not as important as to how a tone is stressed or bent, musical languages distinguish pitches and how the pitches are accented or shifted.  Whistled languages are dependent on an underlying spoken languages and are used in various cultures as a means for communication over distance, or as secret codes.  The mystical concept of a [[language of the birds]] tries to connect the two categories, since some authors of musical [[a priori (languages)|''a priori'' languages]] have speculated about a mystical or primeval origin of the whistled languages.

==Constructed musical languages==
There are only a few language families as of now such as the Solresol language family, Moss language family, and Nibuzigu language family. 

The Solresol family is a family of [[a posteriori]] languages (usually English) where a sequence of 7 notes of the western C-Major scale or the 12 tone chromatic scale are used as phonemes.

The '''National Language Promotion Department''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|اِدارۀ فروغِ قومی زُبان}}}} — {{transl|ur|''Idāra-ē Farōġ-ē Qaumī Zabān''}}, {{IPA-hns|ɪˈd̪ɑː.rə-ˌeː fəˈroːɣ-ˌeː ˈqɔː.mi zəˈbɑːn|pron}}), formerly known as the '''National Language Authority''' (or Urdu Language Authority&lt;ref&gt;Zia (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[autonomous]] [[regulatory]] [[institution]] established in 1979 to support the advancement and promotion of [[Urdu]] which is the [[national language]] of [[Pakistan]]. Its status now has been changed to attached department. Initially it was aimed at creating a synergy between [[Government of Pakistan|national]] and [[Subdivisions of Pakistan|provincial]] governments and institutions for using Urdu language. However, with time, it expanded its horizons to include [[standardisation]] and [[Linguistics|linguistic]] aspects such as [[orthography]] and [[lexicography]]. It also provides recommendations for maximizing use of the language in all walks of life. In this respect, large amounts of [[legal]] and [[scientific]] documents are [[Translation|translated]] from [[English language|English]] and other [[language]]s for publication into Urdu. These efforts have resulted in greater awareness of the language's potential as well as its localisation.&lt;ref&gt;Rahman (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the status and name of organization has been changed from National Language Authority to National Language Promotion Department. The National Language Promotion Department is now an attached department of Ministry of National Heritage &amp; Integration.Renowned Short-Story Writer and Educationist [[Anwaar Ahmad|Dr. Anwaar Ahmad]] was the last Chairman of the NLA, as the post has been converted to Director General (D.G).

== Objectives ==
The institution aims to facilitate the use and adoption of Urdu language in grammical [[Persian language|Persian]] through [[publication]]s and other reading materials for [[individual]]s and organisations. It also provides linkages for [[cooperation]] and [[collaboration]] among various [[academic]], [[research]] and [[education]]al institutions for use of Urdu language and native languages of the country. Over the years efforts have also been made to promote and facilitate Urdu as an [[official]] and [[business]] language; as a [[Medium of instruction]]; and as a medium of expression in the country. Moreover, the development of Urdu software is also encouraged at various levels to become more distant from [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].
&lt;ref&gt;Muqtadra (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisation ==
The organisational structure consists of six divisions that include: [[Dictionary]] section (''Darul Lughaat''), [[Translation]]s section (''Darul Tarjuma''), [[Literature]] section (''Darul Tasneef''), and [[Publication]]s section (''Darul Isha’at'') respectively. There is also a department of [[Urdu Informatics]] (اردو اطلاعیات) to carry out research in developing the suitable hardware and software for the use of language in electronic media. A dedicated [[library]] contains extensive resources on Urdu, and issues regular Urdu Bulletins.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed(1990), pp. 1-3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key activities ==
[[Image:Urdukey.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Urdu keyboard]] layout]]
The institution has published a wide range of general, scientific and technical dictionaries and an Urdu [[Thesaurus]]. Especially, the ''Qaumi English-Urdu Dictionary'' has been based on [[Webster's Dictionary]]. A vast amount of literature has also been produced to encourage reading habits among children.

In 1980, the Authority standardised&lt;ref&gt;Sajjad (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Urdu keyboard]] layout&lt;ref&gt;Aziz (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; for [[typewriter]]s based on [[Naskh (script)|Naskh]] script. Later on, with the arrival of the [[Information Age|digital age]], the layout was improved for [[teleprinter]]s and [[Information processing]].&lt;ref&gt;Afzal (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in 1998 efforts were initiated to standardize Urdu encoding, which resulted in the formation of ''Urdu Zabta Takhti'' (اردو ضابطہ تختی) (UZT). This development was inline with the efforts to cope with the emerging demands of Urdu applications from word processing to mega-scale projects such as [[Identity document#Pakistan|Computerised National Identity Cards]] by [[NADRA]] and a number of [[E-Governance]] initiatives by the national government. In July 2000, UZT 1.01 was standardised for all kinds of electronic computing, communications, and storage.&lt;ref&gt;Afzal and Hussain (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this version, Urdu language support was incorporated into the Versions 3.1 and 4.0 of [[Unicode]]. Localization of [[Microsoft]] applications like Windows and Office in Urdu is also done by then NLA, now NLPD.

{{italic title}}
'''''Of Grammatology''''' ({{lang-fr|De la grammatologie}}) is a 1967 book by French [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Jacques Derrida]] that has been called a foundational text for [[deconstructive criticism]].  The book discusses writers such as [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Étienne Condillac]], [[Louis Hjelmslev]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Roman Jakobson]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], and [[William Warburton]]. The English translation by [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]] was first published in 1976. A revised edition of the translation was published in 1997. A further revised edition was published in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu/content/grammatology|title=Of Grammatology|website=jhupbooks.press.jhu.edu|access-date=2016-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The work was initially submitted by Derrida as a ''[[Doctorat de spécialité]]'' thesis (directed by [[Maurice de Gandillac]]) under the title ''De la grammatologie : Essai sur la permanence de concepts platonicien, aristotélicien et scolastique de signe écrit''&lt;ref&gt;Alan D. Schrift (2006), ''Twentieth-Century French Philosophy: Key Themes And Thinkers'', Blackwell Publishing, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; (''Of Grammatology: Essay on the Permanence of Platonic, Aristotelian and Scholastic Concepts of the Written Sign''). His submission was unsuccessful.

==Content==
Derrida argues that throughout the Western philosophical tradition, writing has been considered as merely a derivative form of speech, and thus as a "fall" from the "full presence" of speech. In the course of the work he deconstructs this position as it appears in the work of several writers, showing the myriad [[aporia]]s and ellipses to which this leads them. Derrida does not claim to be giving a critique of the work of these thinkers, because he does not believe it possible to escape from operating with such oppositions. Nevertheless, he calls for a new science of "[[grammatology]]" that would relate to such questions in a new way.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Der97|Derrida 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Of Grammatology'' introduced many of the concepts which Derrida would employ in later work, especially in relation to [[linguistics]] and [[writing]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Der97|Derrida 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saussure and structuralism===
The book starts with a review of Saussure's linguistic [[structuralism]], as presented in the'' [[Course in General Linguistics]]''. In particular, Derrida analyzes the concept of "[[Sign (semiotics)|sign]]", which for Saussure has the two separate components of sound and meaning. These components are also called signifier (''signifiant'') and signified (''signifié'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Der97|Derrida 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Derrida quotes Saussure: “Language and writing are two distinct systems of signs; the second exists for the sole purpose of representing the first.”&lt;ref&gt;[[#Der97|Derrida 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt; Critiquing this relationship between speech and writing, Derrida suggests that written symbols are legitimate signifiers on their own—that they should not be considered as secondary or derivative relative to oral speech.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Der97|Derrida 1997]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
''Of Grammatology'' is one of three books which Derrida published in 1967, and which served to establish his reputation. The other two were ''La voix et le phénomène'', translated as ''[[Speech and Phenomena]]'', and ''L'écriture et la différence'', translated as ''[[Writing and Difference]]''. It has been called a foundational text for deconstructive criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Greek Tragedy|author=Rabinowitz, Nancy Sorkin|location=Malden, MA|publisher= Blackwell Pub|year=2008|isbn=978-1-4051-2160-6}} p. 5: "Jacques Derrida's ''Of Grammatology'', a foundational text for deconstructive criticism, works closely with Plato".&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1795">'''Plugola''' is the illicit business practice of [[Testimonial|endorsing]] a product or service on radio or television for personal gain, without the consent of the network or stations. “Pluggers” have been known to accept bribes of money, alcohol, or free products and services. This contrasts greatly from [[commercial sponsorship]] because the benefits of the endorsement go to the individual talent or programmers, while the stations and networks receive no revenue.

== History ==
In the 1950s, concern over illicit business practices in television and radio including; plugola, [[payola]], and rigged game shows led to congressional and U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) hearings. In 1959, [[Attorney General]] [[William P. Rogers|William Rogers]] reported to President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] that deceptive and [[false advertising]] and programming was becoming a trend in the United States, and needed to stop. In that same year, FCC Chairman [[John C. Doerfer|John Doerfer]] presented his plan to expand public service programming on television networks. The plan called for some public service programming in prime time slots, which did not occur before this. The networks likely had the same agenda as Doerfer, to regain the respect of the viewers, and agreed to Doerfer’s plan. By 1960, amendments were made to the [[Communications Act of 1934]] to punish those who engaged in these illicit acts in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sterling, Kittross|first=Christopher, John|title=Stay Tuned: A Concise History of American Broadcasting|year=1990|publisher=Wadsworth Publishing Company|isbn=0-534-11905-0|pages=363–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''price tag''' is a [[label]] declaring the [[price]] of an item for sale. It may be a [[sticker]] or attached by [[twist tie]] or other means.
[[File:Price Tag 99+TX 99 cents + tax.jpg|thumb|Typical price tag with security cuts, for 99¢ + tax]]

Some jurisdictions require items (possibly exceptions for bulk good and produce) to be individually marked with the price, or have shelf tags or [[barcode]] scanners available so customers can determine prices without consulting store staff.  In some cases, [[unit price]] is also required.

Some jurisdictions also outlaw [[price discrimination]] except for different quantities (e.g. [[Discounts and allowances|quantity discount]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s are allowed) or different types of customers (e.g. individuals vs. organizations that might be expected to buy in bulk or have better creditworthiness).  For example, the 1936 [[Robinson–Patman Act]] outlaws this practice in the United States.

Many price tags also bear the name of the store.

==History==

Before the late 19th century, in most cases, [[retail]] goods did not have a fixed price, and each customer would be expected to [[Bargaining|haggle]] with the store clerk.{{cn|date=July 2018}} The [[Quaker]]s, who found it immoral for different customers to pay different prices (now known as [[price discrimination]]) were an exception.  In the 1870s, [[Wanamaker's]] in Philadelphia and [[Macy's]] in New York ([[Rowland Hussey Macy]] was a Quaker) began affixing physical tags to items, eliminating haggling.  This allowed shorter training time for new clerks (who would no longer need to know the art of haggling nor the range of accepted prices for every item) and allowed clerks to serve more customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=415287577|title=Planet Money Episode 633: The Birth And Death Of The Price Tag|date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even large stores kept goods behind a counter, requiring clerks to fetch items for customers.  The [[Piggly Wiggly]] chain of grocery stores was the first to become self-service in 1916, further cementing the need for price tags.  Price tags soon became commonplace in Western retail stores, and haggling rare outside of proprietors and individuals selling used items.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7582">Under the context of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014 ([[eIDAS]]), a '''qualified digital certificate''' is a [[public key certificate]] issued by a qualified [[trust service provider]] that ensures the [[authentication|authenticity]] and [[data integrity]] of an electronic signature and its accompanying message and/or attached data.&lt;ref name="Turner-QualDigCert"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=What is a Qualified Digital Certificate for Electronic Signatures in eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/what-is-a-qualified-certificate-for-electronic-signatures-in-eidas|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
eIDAS defines several tiers of [[electronic signature]]s that can be used in conducting public sector and private transactions within and across the borders of [[member state of the European Union|EU member states]]. A qualified digital certificate, in addition to other specific services provided by a qualified trust service provider, is required to elevate the status of an electronic signature to that of being considered a [[qualified electronic signature]]. Using [[cryptography]], the digital certificate, also known as a public key certificate, contains information to link it to its owner and the [[digital signature]] of the trust entity that verifies the authenticity of the content that has been signed.

According to eIDAS, to be considered a qualified digital certificate, the certificate must meet the requirements provided in Annex I of Regulation (EU) No 910/2014, including, but not limited to:&lt;ref name="Turner-QualDigCert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eIDAS-Regulation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=The European Parliament and the Council of the European Union|title=REGULATION (EU) No 910/2014 OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL  of 23 July 2014  on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions in the internal market and repealing Directive 1999/93/EC|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.257.01.0073.01.ENG|publisher=EUR-LEx|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Identification that the certificate is a qualified certificate for electronic signature
* Identification of the qualified trust service provider who issued the qualified certificate, including such information
* Corresponding electronic signature validation data and electronic signature creation data
* Indication of the certificate’s period of validity
* Unique certificate identity code of the trust service provider
* Qualified trust service provider’s [[advanced electronic signature]] or electronic [[Seal (emblem)|seal]]

==Vision==
The need for non-repudiation and authentication of electronic signatures was originally addressed in the [[Electronic Signatures Directive]] 1999/93/EC to help facilitate secure transactions, specifically those that occur across the borders of EU Member states. The [[eIDAS]] Regulation later replaced the Directive and defined the standards to be used in the creation of qualified digital certificates by [[trust service provider]]s.&lt;ref name="eIDAS-Regulation" /&gt;

==Role of a qualified trust service provider==
A qualified digital certificate can only be issued by a qualified [[trust service provider]] that has received authorization from their member state’s supervisory body to provide qualified trust services for creating qualified electronic signatures. The provider must be listed upon the EU Trust List; otherwise, they are not permitted to provide qualified digital certificates or other qualified trust services.
The trust service provider is required to abide by the guidelines established under eIDAS for creating qualified digital certificate, which include:&lt;ref name="Turner-TrustServiceProviders"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Trust Service Providers According to eIDAS|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/trust-service-providers-according-to-eidas|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eIDAS-Regulation" /&gt;
* Providing a valid date and time stamp of when the certificate was created,
* immediately revocation of any signature that has an expired certificate,
* providing appropriate training to all their employees who are involved with providing trust services,
* any equipment or software that is used for trust services must be trustworthy and capable of preventing certificates from being forged.

==Legal implications of electronic signatures with qualified digital certificates==
In court, a qualified electronic signature provided the highest level of [[relevance (law)|probative value]], which makes it difficult to refute its [[authorship]]. A qualified electronic signature, along with its qualified certificate is given the same consideration as a [[signature|handwritten signature]] when used as evidence in legal proceedings. The validity of a qualified electronic signature that has been created with a qualified certificate must be accepted by other EU member states regardless of which member state the signature was produced in.&lt;ref name="TimeLex-QualESig"&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are Qualified Electronic Signatures? Are They by Definition Better than Other Types of Electronic Signatures?|url=http://timelex.eu/en/faq/categorie/electronic-signatures|publisher=Time.Lex|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global perspective==
In other parts of the world, similar concepts have been created to define standards for electronic signatures. In Switzerland, the digital signing standard [[ZertES]] has comparable standards that address the conformity and regulation of trust service providers who product digital certificates.&lt;ref name="ZertES"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swiss Federal Council|title=Bundesgesetz über Zertifizierungsdienste im Bereich der elektronischen Signatur (Bundesgesetz über die elektronische Signatur, ZertES)|url=https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/20011277/index.html|publisher=The Portal of the Swiss Government|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States, the [[NIST]] [[Digital Signature Standard]]&lt;ref name="NIST-DSS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Information Technology Laboratory|title=FIPS PUB 186-4 FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARDS PUBLICATION Digital Signature Standard (DSS)|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf|publisher=National Institute of Standards and Technology|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (DSS) does not provide a comparable standard for regulating qualified certificates that would address non-repudiation of a signatory’s qualified certificate.{{fact|date=October 2018}} An amendment to NIST DSS is currently being discussed that would be more in-line with how eIDAS and ZertES handle trusted services.&lt;ref name="Turner-IsDSSlegallybinding"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Is the NIST Digital Signature Standard DSS Legally Binding?|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/is-the-nist-digital-signature-standard-dss-legally-binding|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-Standards"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Dawn M.|title=Major Standards and Compliance of Digital Signatures - A Worldwide Consideration|url=http://www.cryptomathic.com/news-events/blog/major-standards-and-compliance-of-digital-signatures-a-world-wide-consideration|publisher=Cryptomathic|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ripuarian''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|r|ɪ|p|j|u|ˈ|ɛər|i|ə|n}}; also ''Ripuarian Franconian''; {{lang-de|Ripuarisch Platt}}) is a [[German dialect]] group, part of the [[West Central German]] language group.
Together with the [[Moselle Franconian]] which includes the [[Luxembourgish language]], Ripuarian belongs to the larger [[Central Franconian]] dialect family and also to the [[Rhinelandic]] linguistic [[dialect continuum|continuum]] with the [[Low Franconian languages]].

It is spoken in the [[Rhineland]], south of the [[Benrath line]], from northwest of [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Cologne]], to [[Aachen]] in the west, and [[Waldbröl]] in the east. The language area also comprises the north of the [[German-speaking Community of Belgium]] as well as the southern edge of the [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] province of the [[Netherlands]], especially [[Kerkrade]] (''Kirchroa''). The name derives from the [[Ripuarian Franks]] (''Rheinfranken''), who settled in the area from the 4th century onward.

The most famous member is ''[[Colognian language|Kölsch]]'', the local dialect of Cologne. Dialects belonging to the Ripuarian group almost always call themselves ''Platt'' like ''[[Öcher Platt]]'' (of [[Aachen]]) or ''Eischwiele Platt'' (of [[Eschweiler]]), ''[[Kirchröadsj Platt]]'' (of [[Kerkrade]]) ''[[Bocheser Platt]]'' (of [[Bocholtz]]) or ''[[Bönnsch]] Platt'' (of [[Bonn]]). Most of the more than one hundred Ripuarian dialects are bound to one specific village or municipality. Usually there are small distinctive differences between neighbouring dialects (which are, however, easily noticeable to locals), and increasingly bigger differences between the more distant dialects. These are described by a set of [[isogloss]]es called the [[Rhenish fan]] in linguistics. The way people talk, even if they are not using Ripuarian, often allows them to be traced precisely to a village or city quarter where they learned to speak.

==Number of speakers==
About a million people speak a variation of Ripuarian dialect, which constitutes about one quarter of the inhabitants of the area. Penetration of Ripuarian in everyday communication varies considerably, as does the percentage of Ripuarian speakers from one place to another. In some places there may only be a few elderly speakers left, while elsewhere Ripuarian usage is common in everyday life. Both in the genuine Ripuarian area and far around it, the number of people passively understanding Ripuarian to some extent exceeds the number of active speakers by far. Estimates assume some ten, and up to twenty million speakers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

==Geographic significance==
Speakers are centred on the German city of [[Köln]] ([[Cologne]]). The language's distribution starts from the important geographic transition into the flat-lands coming down from the [[Middle Rhine]]. The Ripuarian varieties are related to the [[Moselle Franconian]] languages spoken in the southern Rhineland ([[Rhineland-Palatinate]] and [[Saarland]]) in Germany, to the [[Luxembourgish language]] in [[Luxembourg]], to the Low Franconian [[Limburgish]] language in the Dutch province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], and to [[Low Dietsch]] in the province of [[Liège (province)|Liège]], Belgium. Most of the historic roots of Ripuarian languages are in [[Middle High German]], but there were other influences too, such as [[Latin]], [[Low German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]] and [[Southern Meuse-Rhenish]] ([[Limburgish]]). Several elements of grammar are unique to Ripuarian and do not exist in the other [[languages of Germany]].

Belgium and the Netherlands officially recognise some Ripuarian dialects as [[minority language]]s, and the [[European Union]] likewise follows.

'''Sakizaya''' is a [[Formosan languages|Formosan language]] closely related to [[Amis language|Amis]].

== History ==
After the [[:zh:加禮宛事件|Takobowan Incident]] of 1876, the [[Sakizaya people]] hid among the Nataoran Amis, and the Sakizaya language was thus categorized as a dialect of Amis.

In 2002, the Center of Aboriginal Studies of [[National Chengchi University]] in Taiwan corrected this error when they edited the indigenous languages textbooks. Therefore, that year Sakizaya language was designated both as a Chilai and Amis sublanguage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alilin.apc.gov.tw/tw/ebooks?view=adm_ebook&amp;id=324 Textbooks] by the Council of Indigenous Peoples in Taiwan&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 January 2007, the Taiwan government recognised the Sakizaya community as the thirteenth distinct indigenous ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6271819.stm Taiwan recognises 'lost' people.] BBC News. Retrieved on January 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

940 people are registered as Sakizaya.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.apc.gov.tw/portal/docDetail.html?CID=940F9579765AC6A0&amp;DID=2D9680BFECBE80B6B1BE41CEAE99B007 中華民國原住民族委員會], 2018年6月23日查閱&lt;/ref&gt; They live in the Takubuwan, Sakur, Maifor and Kaluluwan communities. Thousands of others are still registered as Amis. Around half of Amis politicians in Hualian, the biggest Amis city, are actually Sakizaya.

==Controversies==
Sakizaya language is officially classified as a dialect of [[Nataoran language|Nataoran Amis]] by the international standard-keeper of [[SIL International|SIL]]/[[Ethnologue]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ais Nataoran at Ethnologue]&lt;/ref&gt; but in the statement from the Taiwan government,&lt;ref&gt;[http://apc.sce.ntnu.edu.tw/abst/files/1504579855_piQrv.pdf General regulations for Test of Taiwan Indigenous Languages], 2017, Council of Indigenous Peoples in Taiwan&lt;/ref&gt; the language is separate from Amis and no other dialect descends from Sakizaya.

A '''staircase tower''' or stair tower ({{lang-de|Treppenturm}}, also ''Stiegenturm'' or ''Wendelstein'') is a [[tower]]-like wing of a building with a circular or [[polygon]]al plan that contains a [[stairwell]], usually a [[helical staircase]].

== History ==
Only a few examples of staircase towers have survived from ancient times (e.g. on the [[Imperial Baths (Trier)|Imperial Baths in Trier]]); staircases were often superfluous on the only single-storey buildings or were built into the outer walls of buildings that were often several feet thick. This tradition continued in the keeps (''[[donjon]]s''), churches and castles of the early and high Middle Ages; and this situation only changed with the increasing construction of purpose-built and generally rather undecorated staircase towers of the High and Late Middle Ages ([[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture]] styles).

Since the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] period, staircase towers were markedly more decorative and representative of status. Stairs were now rarely hidden or built externally, but there were both artistically designed, curved and straight-running staircases inside the building with ornate ceilings and railings (e.&amp;nbsp;g. [[Château de Chambord]], [[Palazzo Barberini]] and [[Château d'Azay-le-Rideau]] or [[Château de Chenonceau]]). With the increasing construction of straight staircases with intermediate landings (the modern [[stairwell]]s) separate staircase towers became gradually rarer.

Professor '''Thomas Gwynn Jones''' [[C.B.E.]] (10 October 1871 – 7 March 1949), more widely known as '''T. Gwynn Jones''', was a leading [[Wales|Welsh]] poet, scholar, literary critic, novelist, translator, and journalist who did important work in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] literature, Welsh education, and the study of Welsh folk tales in the first half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Folklore"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gwyndaf|first=Robin|year=1981|title=A Classic of Welsh Folklore Reissued|journal=[[Folklore Society|Folklore]]|volume=92|page=190|jstor=1259472|doi=10.1080/0015587x.1981.9716205}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an accomplished translator into Welsh of works from English, German, Greek, and Irish.

==Personal life==
Born Thomas Jones at 'Y Gwyndy Uchaf' in [[Betws-yn-Rhos]], [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbighshire]], [[Wales]], the eldest son of Isaac Jones and Jane Roberts. He was educated in [[Denbigh]] and [[Abergele]].  In 1899 he married Margaret Jane Davies, the daughter of Thomas Davies of Denbigh, by whom he had three children.

==Career==
In 1890 he was a sub-editor on the Welsh-language newspaper ''[[Baner ac Amserau Cymru]]'' (''Y Faner''). He wrote a famous biography of the great Liberal publisher [[Thomas Gee]], whose work influenced Jones throughout his life. After many years as a journalist, Jones worked at the [[National Library of Wales]], [[Aberystwyth]], and later as a lecturer in the Welsh department at the [[University College of Wales, Aberystwyth]], where he became a professor in 1919.

He won [[Chairing of the Bard|the Chair]] at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] in [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] in 1902 for his ode, 'Ymadawiad Arthur'. His major work was an edition of the fifteenth-century poet, [[Tudur Aled]].

A strong opponent of the First World War, Jones walked out of the Tabernacle Chapel in Aberystwyth when the minister offered a prayer for a British victory in the war. He later wrote  "If there’s anything I understand from the New Testament, it is that Jesus Christ is not a militaristic person. He is the Saviour of the world, he is the Prince of Peace. Therefore those who say they are Christians, followers of Christ must reject war totally."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/first-world-war-pacifism-cracks-8362287]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was awarded [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the [[1937 Coronation Honours]]. &lt;ref&gt; {{London Gazette|supp=y|issue=34396|page=3089|date=11 May 1937}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Theodosius Romanus''' (died 1 June 896) was the [[Patriarch of Antioch]], and head of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] from 887 until his death in 896.

==Biography==
Romanus was born in the 9th century in the city of Tagrit and later went on to become a monk at the [[Mor Gabriel Monastery|Monastery of Qartmin]] where he also studied and mastered medicine to the point that he became known as a skilled physician.

The synod of the Syriac Orthodox Church met in the city of [[Diyarbakır|Amid]] and elected and consecrated Romanus as patriarch on 5 February 887, upon which he adopted the name Theodosius. During his tenure as patriarch, Theodosius Romanus ordained 32 [[metropolitan bishops]], and served as patriarch until his death on 1 June 896.

==Works==
Theodosius' work includes a lengthy commentary on Pseudo-Hierotheus, the first two treatises of which he wrote whilst staying at [[Amid]] before finishing the third treatise at [[Samosata]]. He also wrote a treatise explaining the maxims of various philosophers, including a collection 112 Pythagorean maxims, most of which he had translated from [[Greek language|Greek]] into [[Syriac language|Syriac]].

As well as this, Theodosius is known to have written a medical syntagma, a synodical epistle and a Lenten homily in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

'''Tone sandhi''' is a phonological change occurring in [[tone (linguistics)|tonal languages]], in which the tones assigned to individual words or [[morpheme]]s change based on the pronunciation of adjacent words or [[morpheme]]s.&lt;ref name="Yip"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It usually simplifies a bidirectional tone into a one-direction tone.&lt;ref name="Wang"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of [[sandhi]], or fusional change, from the [[Sanskrit]] word for "joining".

==Languages with tone sandhi==
Tone sandhi occurs to some extent in nearly all [[tone (linguistics)|tonal languages]], manifesting itself in different ways.&lt;ref name="Gandour"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Tonal languages, characterized by their use of [[pitch (music)|pitch]] to affect meaning, appear all over the world, especially in the [[Niger-Congo]] language family of Africa, and the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] language family of East Asia,&lt;ref name="Yip" /&gt; as well as other East Asian languages such as [[Tai–Kadai languages|Tai-Kadai]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and [[Papuan languages]]. [[tone (linguistics)|Tonal languages]] are also found in many [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] and other languages of Central America,&lt;ref name="Yip" /&gt; as well as in parts of North America (such as [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]] in British Columbia, Canada),&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; and Europe.&lt;ref name="Yip" /&gt;

Many North American and African tonal languages undergo "syntagmatic displacement," as one tone is replaced by another in the event that the new tone is present elsewhere in the adjacent tones. Usually, these processes of [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] occur from left to right. In the [[Bantu languages]] of West Africa, for example, an unaccented syllable takes the tone from the closest tone to its left.&lt;ref name="Wang" /&gt; However, in East and Southeast Asia, "paradigmatic replacement" is a more common form of tone sandhi, as one tone changes to another in a certain environment, whether or not the new tone is already present in the surrounding words or [[morphemes]].&lt;ref name="Gandour" /&gt;

Many languages spoken in China have tone sandhi, some of it quite complex.&lt;ref name="Yip" /&gt; [[Southern Min]] (Minnan), which includes [[Hokkien]], [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]], and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], has a complex system, with in most cases every syllable changing into a different tone, and which tone it turns into depending on the final consonant of the syllable that bears it.
[[Image:Taiwanese Hokkien tones.svg|thumb|center|300px|Taiwanese tones in isolation, and the changes they undergo when they precede another tone.]]

Take for example [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] varieties of [[Hokkien language|Hokkien]], which have two [[wikt:toneme|tonemes]] (numbered 4 and 8 in the diagram above) that occur in [[checked syllable|checked syllables]] (those ending in a [[stop consonant]]) and five tonemes in syllables that do not end in a stop. In Taiwanese, within a [[phonological phrase]], all its non-[[neutral tone|neutral-tone]] syllables save for the last undergo tone sandhi.  Among the unchecked syllables, tone 1 becomes 7, 7 becomes 3, 3 becomes 2, and 2 becomes 1. Tone 5 becomes 7 or 3, depending on dialect. Stopped syllables ending in [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī]] {{angle bracket|p}}, {{angle bracket|t}}, or {{angle bracket|k}} take the opposite tone (phonetically, a high tone becomes low, and a low tone becomes high) whereas syllables ending in a [[glottal stop]] (written in Pe̍h-ōe-jī by {{angle bracket|h}}) drop their final consonant to become tone 2 or 3.

The seven or eight tones of [[Hmong language|Hmong]] demonstrate several instances of tone sandhi. In fact the contested distinction between the seventh and eighth tones surrounds the very issue of tone sandhi (between glottal stop (-m) and low rising (-d) tones). High and high-falling tones (marked by -b and -j in the [[Romanized_Popular_Alphabet#Tones|RPA]] orthography, respectively) trigger sandhi in subsequent words bearing particular tones. A frequent example can be found in the combination for numbering objects (ordinal number + classifier + noun): ib (one) + tus (classifier) + dev (dog) &gt; ib tu'''g''' dev (note tone change on the classifier from -s to -g).

==What tone sandhi is and what it is not==

Tone sandhi is compulsory as long as the environmental conditions that trigger it are met. It is not to be confused with [[changed tone|tone changes]] that are due to [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]al or [[inflectional morphology]]. For example, in [[Cantonese]], the word "sugar" ({{linktext|糖}}) is pronounced ''tòhng'' ({{IPA|/tʰɔːŋ˨˩/}} or {{IPA|/tʰɔːŋ˩/}}, with low (falling) tone), whereas the derived word "candy" (also written 糖) is pronounced ''tóng'' ({{IPA|/tʰɔːŋ˧˥/}}, with mid rising tone). Such a change is not triggered by the phonological environment of the tone, and therefore is not an example of sandhi. Changes of morphemes in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] into its [[neutral tone|neutral-tone]] are also not examples of tone sandhi.  

In [[Hokkien language|Hokkien]] (again exemplified by [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] varieties), the words ''kiaⁿ'' (whose base-tone is high flat and means ‘to be afraid’) plus ''lâng'' (whose base-tone is upwardly curving and means ‘person, people’) can combine via either of two different tonal treatments with a corresponding difference in resulting meaning.  A speaker can pronounce the ''lâng'' as a [[neutral tone|neutral-tone]] (= low here), which causes the ''kiaⁿ'' (because it does not go into neutral-tone and immediately precedes) to keep its base-tone (which differs, by the way, from for instance the Standard-Chinese third tone preceding a neutral-tone's more common of its two behaviors).  The result means ‘to be frightful’ (written in [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī]] as ''kiaⁿ--lâng'').  However, one can instead NOT make the ''lâng'' neutral-tone, which both causes it (due to being the final non-neutral tone in the [[phonological phrase]]) to keep its base-tone and causes the ''kiaⁿ'' (because this comes earlier in the phrase than the last non-neutral-tone syllable) to take its sandhi-tone (that being mid flat, because its base-tone is high-flat).  This latter treatment means ‘to be frightfully dirty’ or ‘to be filthy’ (written as ''kiaⁿ-lâng'').  The former treatment does not involve the application of the tone sandhi rules, but rather is a derivational process (that is, it derives a new word), while the latter treatment does involve the tone sandhi, which applies automatically (here as anywhere that a phrase contains more than one syllable not made neutral-tone).

== Examples ==

=== Mandarin Chinese ===
{{further|Standard Chinese phonology#Tone sandhi}}
[[Standard Chinese]] (Standard Mandarin) features several tone sandhi rules:
* When there are two 3rd tones in a row, the first one becomes 2nd tone. E.g. 你好 (''nǐ'' + ''hǎo'' &gt; ''ní hǎo'')&lt;ref name="Yip" /&gt;
* The [[Standard Chinese phonology#Neutral tone|neutral tone]] is pronounced at different pitches depending on what tone it follows.
* 不 (''bù'')  is 4th tone except when followed by another 4th tone, when it becomes 2nd tone. E.g.  不對/不对 (''bù'' + ''duì'' &gt; ''bú duì'')
* 一 (''yī'') is 1st tone when it represents the ordinal "first". Examples: 第一个 (''dìyīgè''). It changes when it represents the cardinal number "1", following a pattern of 2nd tone when followed by a 4th tone, and 4th tone when followed by any other tone. Examples: (for changing to the 2nd tone before a 4th tone) 一次 (''yī'' + ''cì'' &gt; ''yí cì''), 一半 (''yī'' + ''bàn'' &gt; ''yí bàn''), 一會兒/一会儿 (''yī'' + ''huìr'' &gt; ''yí huìr''); (for changing to the 4th tone before another tone) 一般 (''yī'' + ''bān'' &gt; ''yì bān''), 一毛 (''yī'' + ''máo'' &gt; ''yì máo'').

=== Zapotec ===

[[Zapotec languages|Zapotec]], an [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] language (or group of closely related languages) spoken in Mexico, has three tones: high, middle and low. The three tones, along with separate classifications for morpheme categories, contribute to a somewhat more complicated system of tone sandhi than in [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]]. There are two main rules for Zapotec tone sandhi, which apply in this order:

# (This rule only applies to class B morphemes.) A low tone will change to a mid tone when it precedes either a high or a mid tone: /yèn nājō/ → yēn nājō "neck we say"
# A mid tone will change to a high tone when it is after a low or mid tone, and occurs at the end of a morpheme not preceding a pause: /ẓīs gōlī/ → ẓís gōlī "old stick"&lt;ref&gt;

=== Molinos Mixtec ===

[[Mixtec language|Molinos Mixtec]], another [[Oto-Manguean languages|Oto-Manguean]] language, has a much more complicated system of tone sandhi. The language has three tones (high, mid, or low, or 1, 2, or 3, respectively), and all roots are disyllabic, meaning that there are nine possible combinations of tones for a root or "couplet". The tone combinations are expressed here as a two digit number (high-low is represented as 13). Couplets are also classified into either class A or B, as well as verb or non-verb. A number of specific rules depending on these three factors determine tone change. One example of a rule follows:&lt;ref name="Hunter"&gt;

=== Akan ===

[[Akan language|Akan]], a Niger-Congo language spoken in [[Ghana]], has two tones: high and low. The low tone is default.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In Akan, tones at morpheme boundaries assimilate to each other through tone sandhi, the first tone of the second morpheme changing to match the final tone of the first morpheme.

For example:

:àkókɔ́ + òníní &gt; àkókɔ́óníní "cockerel"

:ǹsóró + m̀má &gt; ǹsóróḿmá "star(s)"&lt;ref&gt;

==Transcription==
Sinologists sometimes use reversed [[Chao tone letter]]s to indicate sandhi, with the left-facing letters of the IPA on the left for the underlying tone, and reversed right-facing letters on the right for the realized tone. For example, the Mandarin example of ''nǐ'' {{IPA|[ni˨˩˦]}} + ''hǎo'' {{IPA|[xaʊ˨˩˦]}} &gt; ''ní hǎo'' {{IPA|[ni˧˥xaʊ˨˩˦]}} above would be transcribed:
:{{IPA|[ni˨˩˦꜔꜒xaʊ˨˩˦]}}

The individual Unicode components of the reversed tone letters are {{angbr|{{IPA|꜒ ꜓ ꜔ ꜕ ꜖}}}}.

== Toqabaqita/To'abaita Language ==
Toqabaqita is the language spoken by the people living at the north-western tip of Malaita Island, of South Eastern Solomon Islands. Toqabaqita, also known as To’abaita as well as To’ambaita, Malu and Malu’u is an Austronesian language.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk, 2008, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The website ''Ethnologue'' records the number of speakers of Toqabaqita as 12,600 in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Lewia, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenberk, who has written an extensive grammar of Toqabaqita reports that Toqabaqita may be part of a North Malaita group of dialects which includes Baeguu, Baelelae and Fataleka, and possibly Lau. Ethnologue however reports no known dialects of Toqabaqita, but reports that within this group of languages, they are mutually intelligible.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk, 2008, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenberk points out that the speakers of Toqabaqita do recognize similarities across the whole island’s languages, but the Toqabaqita people themselves do not have this conception of North Malaita being a language and Toqabaqita as a dialect within this group.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Toqabaqita is classified as member of the Malayo-Polynesian, Oceanic, Central-Eastern Oceanic, Southeast Solomonic language family. Then there is a slight divergence in classification between Lichtenberk and Glottolog.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Lichetenberk classifies the next subgrouping as Longgu/Malaita/Makira (San Crisobel), whereas Glottolog does not include Longgu at this point, but instead as a sister subgroup to Malaita/Makira.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Wikipedia entry for Longgu, which is a Southeast Solomonic language spoken on Guadalcanal, is reported to be originally from Malaita. Lichtenberg then breaks the Malaita/Makira subgroup into the Central/Northern and Southern Malaita subgroups, then North Malaita subgroup itself, to which Toqabaqita belongs.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast Glottolog breaks the subgroup Malaita/ San Cristobel (Makira) into two subgroups Malaita/Makira and Longgu, then to North and south Malaita subgroups, where the north includes the above listed putative dialects as well as the central Malaita languages.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
The number of speakers of Toqabaqita is relatively high for a Solomon Islands language, although most speakers become bilingual in Pijin as they grow up. Toqabaqita has the status of first language for children, and is used in daily life. Many Toqabaqita speakers also speak some English, and this is the language of the schools, although only primary schools are available locally.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The literacy rate in Toqabaqita is 30-60%, and Latin script is used.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phonology ===

Toqabaqita phonemes consist of 17 consonants and 5 vowels.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The degree of prenasalization varies and is determined by their position in the word.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk, 2008, p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

Vowels can be long, but it is not allowed to have adjacent long vowels.
Stress is not indicated by the phonemes, but by the symbols (’) for primary stress and (’) for secondary stress.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Language Typology ===

Toqabaqita has as its basic constituent order Subject - Predicate – X, with X referring to other elements that the subject and predicate.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk, 2008, p.43&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be categorized as SVO (subject verb object) and SVX (subject verb other). Lynch in his review of Oceanic languages found that this constituent order is in fact the most widely geographically distributed pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, 2008, p.50&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Verbs in Toqabaqita can include a variety of affixes, both suffixes and pre-fixes, which mark other grammatical categories of tense aspect, sequentiality and negation. Lexical objects are usually indexed on the verb as a suffix. In Toqabaqita the basic noun phrase consists minimally of a noun or an independent personal pronoun. Noun phrases may contain modifiers, which are generally suffixes.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.44&lt;/ref&gt;
Lexical morphemes consist of at least two syllables in Toqabaqita. Where a monosyllabic word occurs, such as a grammatical morpheme, it then attaches as a clitic to the preceding word, with some notable exceptions. If speech is slow then the grammatical morpheme may have its vowel lengthened and take stress.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal Pronouns and Person Markers ===

==== Independent Personal Pronouns ====

The Independent person pronouns in Toqabaqita are for single, dual and plural pronouns for first person exclusive, first person inclusive, second and third person categories. With only a few systematic exceptions the pronominal noun phrases are used in the same position as where a lexical noun phrase would occur. Lexical nouns are marked only as singular or plural in Toqabaqita.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.325&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| ||colspan="9"| "We scrape limestone..." 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The variants marked with * were used exclusively by women. Of these pronouns used only by women, only the first person inclusive plural pronoun kia is used at the present time. This is specifically in the context of referring to one’s home, or one’s home place or one’s country most commonly when away from one’s home area’.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk, 2008, p.243&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that although there are multiple plural personal pronouns some are used more commonly than others. Some alternatives are rarely used, specifically these are the first person exclusive kamaliqa, the third person plural kiiluqa, and the second person singular qoo. Both forms of the second person plural, kamuluqa and kamaluqa are commonly used. There are phonetic associations with specific person pronouns. The dual pronouns all contain r, and the plurals all contain l, with exception of the third person plural kera. Lichtenberk suggests that this is due to their associations with the numbers rua which glosses as two, and ulu which glosses as three, and also that perhaps the plurals were previously trial or paucal forms of pronouns.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases where the independent pronoun and a subject marker are identical (homophones) and occur in the same sentence one will be omitted, and Lichtenberk (2008) suggests it is the pronoun that is omitted. This occurs for koro, where it is both the inclusive dual inclusive independent personal pronoun and the dual inclusive nonfuture subject marker. Similarly kulu is both the plural inclusive independent plural pronoun and the plural inclusive nonfuture subject marker. Lichtenberk believes that most speakers would avoid the repetition.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.244&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| ||colspan="9"| "Let's pray now" 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.243&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the above example the first ''kulu'' would be deleted. 
The independent personal pronouns, including the third person pronouns are used with human reference, or with spirits, very rarely with animals. The may be used with mythological animals or with an animal that is in view.

|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.246&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The third person pronoun can be used to specify subject topicalization, even with inanimate objects, as is:
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (6) ||''dadaku)''|| ''qeri''|| '''''nia'''''|| ''qe''|| ''takwi''|| ''qi'''|| ''laa''||''one''||
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;Calophyllum.sp&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;that&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;3SG&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;3SG.NFUT&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;that&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;stand&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;LOC&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;in&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;smallsand&lt;/small&gt; ||
|-
| ||colspan="9"| "The dadaku tree, it stood in the sand on the beach" 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.246&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are numerous specific uses of the independent personal pronouns such as the third person singular pronoun being used to close off a story or a narration, in a verb-less statement:
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (7) ||'''''Nia'''''|| ''bo-naqa''|| ''neri''|| 
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;3SG&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;ASRT=PRF&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;N.PAST&gt;HERE&lt;/small&gt; ||
|-
| ||colspan="9"| "That's all I have to say" 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.247&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To emphasize a pronoun the same strategies that are used with lexical nouns are also employed, but with a specific pronominal foregrounder ''ni''.
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (8) ||''Nau''|| ''ku''|| ''lae''|| ''naqa''|| ''ma''|| '''''ni'''''|| '''''kamuluqa'''''||
|-

|-
| ||colspan="9"| "I'm going now; and you?)" 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.248&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here the emphasis is on the persons being spoken to. 
The inclusive pronouns can be used in a way to include the addressee, to index personal closeness or in a jocular sense.

==== Person Markers ====

Toqabaqita uses person markers with proper nouns that designate people, spirits, ogres, pets and domestic animals. They are gender differentiated, with tha used with male and ni with female people. When referring to gods and spirits and introduced Christian deities, tha is used. Tha is used to refer to all pets and domestic animals, both male and female. They are used for reference not for address, see examples 11 and 12, but even then they are not obligatory.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk, 2008, p.250&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== Object Pronouns ====

In Toqabaqita there are two classes of transitive verbs, Class 1 and Class 2, and they index their pronominal direct objects differently. Class 1 transitives have object indexing suffixes only for the third person; ''-a'' for singular direct objects, ''-daroqa'' for dual categories and ''-da'' for plural objects.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (16) ||''Qo''|| '''''riki-a?'''''|| 
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;2SG.NFUT&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;see-3SG.OBJ&lt;/small&gt; || 
|-
| ||colspan="9"| "Did you see him/her/it?" 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (17) ||''Qo''|| '''''riki-daroqa?'''''|| 
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;2SG.NFUT&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;see-3DU.OBJ&lt;/small&gt; || 
|-
| ||colspan="9"| "Did you see them(2)?" 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Toqabaqita doesn't index object status first and second person, but it is indicated by the appropriate independent personal pronoun as in (18).
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (18) ||''Kai''|| ''lole''|| '''''qoe'''''|| 
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;3SG.IPFV&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;tell.lie.to&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;2SG&lt;/small&gt; || 
|-
| ||colspan="9"| "He is lying to you." 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Class 2 Transitive verbs have object indexing suffixes for all grammatical persons and numbers, and follow a similar pattern to the independent personal pronouns.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Singular !! Dual !! Plural
|-
| 1EXCL || -ku || -mareqa || -miliqa, -maliqa, -mi(1), miqa(1)
|-
| 1INCL ||  || -karoqa || -kuluqa, -kaluqa, -ka(1)
|-

|}
Again there are forms that were previously used only by women, in women's speech, that are no longer used. For the third person singular there are two forms -na and -a, and their use is often phonologically determined, in particular so there are no sequences of three vowels.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.114&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (19) ||'''''taqe-fuil-a'''''|| ''maka''|| ''nia''|| 
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;ascend-site.3.OBJ&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;father&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;3SG&lt;/small&gt; || 
|-
| ||colspan="9"| "(of a son)replace his father." 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

|-
| ||colspan="9"| "He was asleep(and) didn't know (about) it." 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.71&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ''-na'' object pronoun is used here in (20) to follow the vowel ''a''.

==== Subject Pronouns ====

Toqabaqita has subject indexing suffixes which appear on the verb and also indicate nonfuture tense, future tense, imperfect aspect, sequentiality, negative aspect and dehortation.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.143&lt;/ref&gt; There is some suffixes that are the same in the third person dual and plural categories. It is interesting to observe that there are no archaic women's speech forms noted by Lichtenberk.

|-
| ||colspan="9"| "The child, both of his legs are no good." 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.151&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Possession ====

Possession in Toqabaqita is relational in that there are two entities in the relationship the “possessor” and the “possessum”. The possessor may own an item, it may be a body part, or a tool. But this also includes relationships with the person or item, including a kinship relationship. Lichtenberk prefers to term these “personal suffixes” as they not only index possession, but also with a transitive verb to index their subject, to indicate a recipient/beneficiary relationship, and to index a complement with a number of prepositions. These suffixes can be used with both lexical nouns and verbs. It can be seen that some of these suffixes are identical with the singular object pronoun suffixes, namely -ku, -na, and -a.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.376&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! singular !! dual !! plural
|-
| 1EXCL || -ku || -mareqa || -miliqa,maliqa, -mi(1), -miqa(1)
|-
| 1INCL ||  || -karoqa || -kuluqa, -kulaqa, -ka(1)
|-
| 2 || -mu || -maroqa || -muluqa, -maluqa, miu(1)
|-
| 3 || -na, -a || -daroqa || -da, daluqa
|}
&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.376&lt;/ref&gt;
Again there are forms previously used by women in speech, that are no longer used, marked (1). In terms of semantics the personal suffixes are used with relational nouns where the relationship is described as inalienable possession. This includes parts of a whole (24), body parts (23,27), products of a possessor (25,26) and integral contents such as blood of animal or juice of a fruit.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.378&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (23) ||'''''gwalusu-ku'''''||

| ||&lt;small&gt;nose-1SG.PERS&lt;/small&gt; 
|-
| ||colspan="9"| "my nose" 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.379&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (24) ||'''''boor-a'''''|| ''kilu''|| 
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;bottom-3SG.PERS&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;hole&lt;/small&gt; ||

&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (25) ||'''''qiiqida-ku'''''|| 
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;sweat-1SG.PERS&lt;/small&gt; ||
|-
| ||colspan="9"| "my sweat" 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.380&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (26) ||'''''nuu-na'''''||
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;Shadow/reflection/picture-3SG.PRS&lt;/small&gt; ||
|-
| ||colspan="9"| "A man's shadow/reflection/picture" 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.380&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (27) ||'''''babali-na'''''||
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;check-3SG.PERS&lt;/small&gt; ||
|-
| ||colspan="9"| "his/her cheek(s)" 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.379&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From a phontactic point of view words with ''–l'' or-''r'' in the syllable use third person singular ''–na'', as in example (27). Attributes as well as spatial and temporal relations of the possessor are also designated with these personal suffixes, as in example (28).&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.379&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (28) ||'''''qintoqo-na'''''|| ''biqu''|| ''naqi''||
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;LOC centre-3SG.PERS&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;house&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;this&lt;/small&gt; ||
|-
| ||colspan="9"| "In the centre of this house." 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.380&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Toqabaqita also employs the bare possessive noun phrase where there is no indexing of the possessor on the possessed noun. A Possessor noun phrase must be present, this may be a lexical noun or a pronoun. The two following examples display this, in that a possessor noun phrase is pronominal, and it is the independent personal pronoun that is employed. In this manner all the independent pronouns can be bare possessor nouns.&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.384&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (29) ||''biqu''|| '''''keeroqa'''''|| ''na=i''|| ''Takwaraasi''||
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;house&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;3DU&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;REL=LOC&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;Takwarassi&lt;/small&gt; ||
|-
| ||colspan="9"| "Their house at Takwaraasi." 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.384&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
:{|
| (30) ||''tarausis''|| ''tekwa''|| '''''nau'''''|| ''baa''||
|-
| ||&lt;small&gt;trousers&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;be.long&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;1SG&lt;/small&gt; ||&lt;small&gt;that&lt;/small&gt; ||
|-
| ||colspan="9"| "Those long trousers of mine." 
|}&lt;ref&gt;Lichtenberk 2008, p.384&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2411">'''Wronger than wrong''', described by [[Michael Shermer]] as '''Asimov's axiom''',&lt;ref name="Shermer"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shermer M | title = Wronger Than Wrong | journal = Scientific American | date = November 2006 | pages = | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=wronger-than-wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a mistake discussed in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s book of essays ''[[The Relativity of Wrong]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac. ''The Relativity of Wrong''. {{ISBN|1-55817-169-X}} (paperback, 1989); {{ISBN|1-57566-008-3}} (paperback reissue, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; A statement that equates two errors is ''wronger than wrong'' when one of the errors is clearly more wrong than the other. As Asimov put it:

{{quote|When people thought the Earth was flat, they were wrong. When people thought the Earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the Earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the Earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.}}

Asimov explains that science is both progressive and cumulative. Even though scientific theories are later proven wrong, the degree of their wrongness attenuates with time as they are modified in response to the mistakes of the past.&lt;ref name="Shermer" /&gt; For example, data collected from satellite measurements show, to a high level of precision, how the [[figure of the Earth|Earth's shape]] differs from a perfect sphere.&lt;ref name="Shermer" /&gt; 

Shermer states that being wronger than wrong is actually worse than being ''[[not even wrong]]'' (that is, being [[unfalsifiable]]).&lt;ref name="Shermer" /&gt;

According to [[John Holmes Jenkins|John Jenkins]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book378.html|title=Welcome to Jenkins’ Spoiler-Laden Guide to Isaac Asimov's The Relativity of Wrong|date=26 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; who reviewed ''The Relativity of Wrong'', the title essay of Asimov's book is the one "which I think is important both for understanding Asimov's thinking about science and for arming oneself against the inevitable anti-science attack that one often hears – [that] theories are always preliminary and science really doesn't 'know' anything".
