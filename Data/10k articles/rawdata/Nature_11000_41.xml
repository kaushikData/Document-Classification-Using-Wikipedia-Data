      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2038">The '''1L6''' is a 7 pin miniature [[vacuum tube]] of the [[pentagrid converter]] type. It was developed in the United States by [[Osram Sylvania|Sylvania]]. It is very similar electrically to its predecessors, the Loktal-based 1LA6 and 1LC6. Released in 1949 for the [[Zenith Trans-Oceanic]] shortwave portable radio, this tube was in commercial production until the early 1960s .

The 1L6 was to be a specialty tube, produced in small quantities by very few manufacturers, mostly Sylvania for use by just a few manufacturers of shortwave portables, such  as Zenith - in their Trans-Oceanics - and its short-lived rivals, such as the [[Hallicrafters]] TW-1000 and the [[RCA]] Strat-O-World and  very few others. In fact, Zenith, Crosley and more than a few others used it in many radios. 1L6 based multi-band radios were made by Crosley, Airline (Montgomery Ward house-brand), Silvertone (Sears house brand), Hallicrafters, FADA, and several others. When the US military commissioned two versions of the Trans-Oceanics, they stockpiled 1L6s in the uncounted thousands, some of which still show up at surplus sales.

It was offered to Zenith by Sylvania in place of the larger 1LA6 - for which Zenith made production line changes as the first Miniature-Tube T/O was starting production. The original G500 chassis was punched for a Locktal socket, Zenith changed the phenolic wafer socket to accommodate the smaller tube. NOTE: a 1LA6 (or a 1LC6) will work as a near drop-in replacement for the 1L6 with the use of an adapter socket.

The closet European analog to the 1L6 is the DK92.&lt;ref&gt;TransOceanic, the Royalty of Radios (Bryant and Cones) 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allat''', also spelled '''Allatu''', '''Alilat''', '''{{transl|ar|DIN|Allāt}}''', and '''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-Lāt}}''' ({{lang-ar|اللات}}, {{IPA-ar|al(i)ˈlaːt(u)|pron}}) is a name and title used to refer to multiple [[Goddess|goddesses]] worshipped in the [[ancient Near East]], including the Semitic goddesses [[Asherah]] and [[Asherah|Athirat]]. More importantly, it refers to the [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic Arabian]] [[List of pre-Islamic Arabian deities|goddess]] worshipped alongside [[Manāt]] and [[al-‘Uzzá]] throughout the entire peninsula, including [[Mecca]]. 

According to Islamic sources, the tribe of [[Banu Thaqif]] in [[Ta'if]] especially holds reverence to her. Under [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] influence, her iconography began to show the attributes of [[Athena]], the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] of war, as well as her Roman equivalent [[Minerva]]. In [[Islamic culture|Islamic tradition]], her worship ended when her shrine in [[Ta'if]] was demolished on the orders of [[Muhammad]].

== Etymology and name ==
There are two possible etymologies of the name al-Lat.&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|year=1986|title=al-Lat|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam|publisher=Brill|edition=2nd|volume=5|page=692|author=T. Fahd|editors=P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymology best reflecting the Arab lexicographical tradition derives the name from the verb ''latta'' (to mix or knead barley-meal). It has also been associated with the "idol of jealousy" erected in the temple of Jerusalem according to the [[Book of Ezekiel]], which was offered an oblation of barley-meal by the husband who suspected his wife of infidelity. It can be inferred from [[Hisham ibn al-Kalbi|al-Kalbi]]'s ''[[Book of Idols]]'' that a similar ritual was practiced in the vicinity of the idol of al-Lat.&lt;ref name="EI2" /&gt; The second etymology, which is more in line with Semitic traditions in general, takes al-Lat to be the feminine form of Allah&lt;ref name="EI2" /&gt;, with the original, pre-reduction masculine and feminine forms being therefore ''al-'ilāh'' and ''al-'ilāt'' respectively.

=== As a title ===

The word al-Lat was used as a name and title for multiple pre-Islamic goddesses of Arabia and was used for either a wife of Allah or a daughter depending on the region.{{sfn|Hughes|p=25}} It has been hypothesized that Allat is the consort of Allah based on the fact that it is typical of deities in that area of the world to have consorts.{{sfn|Monaghan|2014|p=30}} It was used as a title for the goddesses [[Asherah]] and [[Asherah|Athirat]].{{sfn|Monaghan|2014|p=31}}  The word is akin to [[Asherah|Elat]], which was the name of the wife of the Semitic deity [[El (deity)|El]].{{sfn|Sykes|Turner|2014|p=7, 8, 63}}

Especially in older sources, ''Allat'' is an alternative name of the [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian]] goddess of the [[underworld]],&lt;ref name="Maspero"&gt;[http://www.fullbooks.com/The-World-s-Greatest-Books-Vol-XI-1.html The Dawn of Civilisation], by: [[Gaston Maspero]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Assyria"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/28072/28072-h/28072-h.htm «A History Of Art In Chaldæa &amp; Assyria»] Georges Perrot, Professor in The Faculty of Letters, Paris; Member of The Institute, and Charles Chipiez. New York, 1884.&lt;/ref&gt; now usually known as [[Ereshkigal]]. She was reportedly also [[Religion in Carthage|venerated in Carthage]] under the name [[Allatu]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Gods, Michael Jordan, Kyle Cathie Limited, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attestations ==

=== Pre-Islamic era ===
[[File:Nemesis_Allat_and_dedicater-MBA_Lyon-IMG_0557.JPG|thumb|Bas-relief: [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], al-Lat and the dedicator. Courtesy of the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]]|left]]
Al-Lat was worshipped throughout [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], and her cult reached as far as [[Syria]]. From [[Safaitic]] and [[Hismaic]] inscriptions, it is probable that she was worshiped as Lat (''lt'').{{sfn|Healey|2001|p=114}}

In [[Safaitic]] inscriptions, al-Lat was invoked for solitude and mercy. She was expected to bring well-being, ease and prosperity. Travelers would invoke her for good weather and protection. She was also invoked for vengeance, booty from raids, and infliction of blindness and lameness to anyone who defaces the inscriptions.{{Sfn|Hoyland|2002|p=207}} 
 
The Greek historian [[Herodotus]], writing in the 5th century BC, considered her the equivalent of [[Aphrodite]]:
{{quote|The [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]] call Aphrodite ''[[Mylitta]]'', the [[Arabians]] ''Alilat'' [Greek spelling: Ἀλιλάτ], and the [[Persian people|Persians]] ''[[Mithra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] I:131&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Herodotus acknowledged Alilat to be the equivalent of Aphrodite Ourania.{{sfn|Corrente|2013|p=265}} According to Herodotus, the ancient Arabians believed in only two gods:
{{quote|They believe in no other gods except [[Dionysus]] and the Heavenly Aphrodite; and they say that they wear their hair as Dionysus does his, cutting it round the head and shaving the temples. They call Dionysus, ''[[Orotalt]]''; and [[Aphrodite]], ''Alilat''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]] III:8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Al-Lat's worship in [[South Arabia]] was not popular.{{sfn|McAuliffe|2005|p=88}} She was not the object of an organized cult, with two amulets (inscribed "Lat" on one, "Latan" on the other) being the only indication that this goddess received worship.{{sfn|McAuliffe|2005|p=88}}

Al-Lat was worshipped the most in northern Arabia. The [[Qedarites]], a northern Arabian tribal confederation, seemed to also worship al-Lat, as evidenced by a silver bowl dedicated by a Qedarite king, with the goddess' name inscribed on it.{{sfn|Hoyland|2002|p=63}}

The [[Nabataean|Nabataeans]] and the people of [[Hatra]] also worshipped al-Lat, equating her with the Greek goddesses [[Athena]] and [[Tyche]] and the Roman goddess [[Minerva]]. She is frequently called "the Great Goddess" in Greek in multilingual inscriptions.{{sfn|Healey|2001|p=136}} The Nabataeans regarded al-Lat as the mother of the deities, and her family relations vary; sometimes she is regarded as the consort of [[Dushara]], other times she is regarded as the mother of Dushara.{{sfn|Healey|2001|p=114}} Nabataean inscriptions state her as well as Al-'Uzza as the "brides of [[Dushara]]".{{sfn|Corrente|2013|p=263}} According to [[Julius Wellhausen|Wellhausen]], the Nabataeans believed al-Lat was the mother of [[Hubal]] (and hence the mother-in-law of [[Manāt]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wellhausen, 1926, p. 717, quoted in translation by [http://hanskrause.de/HKHPE/hkhpe_32_01.htm Hans Krause] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050216223426/http://hanskrause.de/HKHPE/hkhpe_32_01.htm |date=2005-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Palmira Museo - GAR - 7-01.jpg|thumb|Statue of al-Lat-Athena found in the [[temple of Al-Lat]], [[Palmyra]] (destroyed in 2015)]]

Al-Lat was also venerated in [[Palmyra]], which housed an Arab population, and there her temple had no signs of blood rituals. The practice of casting [[divination]] arrows, a common divination method in [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]], was attested in her temple; an honorific inscription mentioning "a basin of silver for [casting] lots (''lḥlq'')"{{Sfn|Hoyland|2002|p=156}}. By the second-century AD, she began to be portrayed in the style of [[Athena]], and was referred to as "Athena-Allāt", but this assimilation does not extend beyond its iconography.{{sfn|Teixidor|1979|p=62}} A famous statue that once adorned [[Temple of Al-Lat|her temple]] there was the [[Lion of Al-lāt]], once damaged by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), but has been since restored.

=== Islamic era ===
[[File:Palmyra,Al-Lat_T.jpg|thumb|Remains of the [[temple of Al-Lat]], [[Palmyra]], [[Syria]]|alt=|left]]In Islamic sources discussing pre-Islamic Arabia, al-Lat is attested as the chief-goddess of the Banu Thaqif tribe. She was said to be venerated in Taif, where she was called ''ar-Rabbah'' (The Lady).{{sfn|Brockelmann|1960|p=9}} She reportedly had a shrine there which was decorated with ornaments and treasure of [[gold]] and [[onyx]].{{sfn|Tabari|1990|p=46}} There, the goddess was venerated in the form of a cubic rock.{{sfn|al-Kalbi|1952|p=14}} The area around the shrine was sacred; no trees could be felled, no animal hunted and no human blood can be shed.{{sfn|Eckenstein|2018|p=24}}{{sfn|Majid|1991|p=271}}

Al-Lat is also mentioned in pre-Islamic Arab poetry, which were belatedly put into writing. She was alluded by al-Mutalammis in his satire of [['Amr III ibn al-Mundhir|Amr ibn-Hind]]:{{Sfn|al-Kalbī|1952|p=15}}
&lt;poem&gt;''Thou hast banished me for fear of lampoon and satire.''
''No! By Allat and all the sacred baetyls (ansab)''
''thou shalt not escape.''&lt;/poem&gt;A poem by the pre-Islamic monotheist [[Zayd ibn Amr]] mentions al-Lat, along with Al-Uzza and [[Hubal]]:{{sfn|Ishaq|1955|p=100}}&lt;poem&gt;''Am I to worship one lord or a thousand?''
''If there are as many as you claim,''
''I renounce al-Lat and al-Uzza, both of them,''
''as any strong-minded person would.''
''I will not worship al-Uzza and her two daughters …''
''I will not worship Hubal, though he was our lord''
''in the days when I had little sense.''&lt;/poem&gt;Al-Lat was also called as daughter of [[Allah]] along with the other two chief goddesses [[Al-‘Uzzá|Al-'Uzza]] and Manat.{{sfn|Berkey|2003|p=42}}{{sfn|Robinson|2013|p=75}}{{sfn|Peters|1994|p=110}}{{sfn|Peterson|2007|p=21}}

According to the ''[[Book of Idols]]'' by [[Hisham Ibn Al-Kalbi|Hishām ibn al-Kalbi]], the pre-Islamic Arabs believed al-Lat resided in the [[Kaaba]] and also had an idol inside the sanctuary:

{{quote|Her custody was in the hands of the Banū Attāb ibn Mālik of the [[Thaqif|Thaqīf]], who had built an edifice over her. The [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]], as well as all the Arabs, venerated al-Lāt. They also used to name their children after her, calling them ''Zayd al-Lāt'' and ''Taym al-Lāt''. [...] Al-Lāt continued to be venerated until the [[Thaqif|Thaqīf]] embraced Islam, when Muhammad dispatched al-Mughīrah ibn-Shu‘bah, who destroyed her and burnt her [[temple]] to the ground.{{sfn|al-Kalbī|1952|p=14–15}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e1332 Oxfordislamicstudies.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mify narodov mira 1984. Article: Allat&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}
In the [[Qur'an]], she is mentioned along with [[al-‘Uzzá]] and [[Manāt]] in [[Sura 53]]:19–23, a verse that became the subject of the alleged [[Satanic Verses]]. The tribe of [[ʿĀd]] of [[Iram of the Pillars]] is also mentioned in [[Al-Fajr (sura)|Sura 89]]:5–8, and archaeological evidence from Iram shows copious inscriptions devoted to her for the protection of a tribe by that name.{{sfn|Healey|2001|p=111}}

According to Islamic tradition, the shrine dedicated to al-Lat in [[Taif|Ta'if]] was demolished on the orders of [[Muhammad]], during the [[Expedition of Abu Sufyan ibn Harb]], in the same year as the [[Battle of Tabuk]]{{sfn|Tabari|1990|p=46}} (which occurred in October 630 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.islamic-book.net/ar/Rihlat-Alnobowwah.htm|title=The Journey of Prophecy; Days of Peace and War (Arabic)|last=Hawarey|first=[http://mosab.hawarey.org/ Dr. Mosab]|publisher=Islamic Book Trust|year=2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322002711/http://www.islamic-book.net/ar/Rihlat-Alnobowwah.htm|archivedate=2012-03-22|deadurl=yes|}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Muir|1878|p=207}} The destruction of the idol was a demand by Muhammad before he would allow any reconciliation to take place with the tribes of Ta'if, who were under his siege.{{sfn|Muir|1878|p=205}}

== Scholarly interpretations ==
F. V. Winnet saw al-Lat as a lunar deity due to association of a crescent with her in 'Ayn esh-Shallāleh and a [[Lihyan|Lihyanite]] inscription mentioning the name of [[Wadd]] over the title of '''fkl lt''. [[René Dussaud]] and Gonzague Ryckmans linked her with Venus while others have thought her to be a solar deity. John F. Healey considers al-Uzza actually might have been an epithet of al-Lat before becoming a separate deity in Meccan pantheon.{{Sfn|Healey|2001|p=114}} ''Redefining Dionysos'' considers she might have been a god of vegetation or a celestial deity of atmospheric phenomena and a sky deity.{{sfn|Corrente|2013|p=265-266}}

== Iconography ==
[[File:Lion in the garden of Palmyra Archeological Museum, 2010-04-21.jpg|thumb|The Lion of Al-Lat, representing the goddess and her consort.|alt=|left]]
In [[Ta'if]], Al-Lat's primary idol is a cubic stone,{{sfn|al-Kalbi|1952|p=14}} which according to the ''[[Book of Idols]]'', is associated with a Jew who prepares his barley porridge. 

Early [[Palmyra|Palmyrene]] depictions of Al-Lat share iconographical traits with [[Atargatis]] (when seated) and [[Astarte]] (when standing).{{sfn|Teixidor|1979|p=61}} The [[Lion of Al-Lat]] that once adorned her temple depicts a lion and a gazelle, the lion representing her consort,{{sfn|Butcher|2003|p=309}} and the gazelle representing Al-Lat's tender and loving traits, as bloodshed was not permitted under Al-Lat's retaliation.{{sfn|Baaren|1982|p=70}}

[[File:Allat-Minerva.jpg|thumb|Allāt-[[Minerva]]. Statue of the 2nd century AD from [[As-Suwayda]], [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]. [[National Museum of Damascus]]|367x367px|alt=]]
Al-Lat was associated with the Greek goddess [[Athena]] (and by extension, the Roman [[Minerva]]) in [[Nabataeans|Nabataea]], [[Hatra]] and [[Palmyra]]. It seems that her identification with Athena was only a mere change in iconography, and Al-Lat's character noticeably softened the warlike Athena in places where she was equated with.{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=130}} One [[Nabataeans|Nabataean]] relief of Athena-Al-Lat depicts the goddess bearing both Athena and Al-Lat's attributes. The relief depicts the goddess in the style of Athena, but having a stylized square face (resembling Nabataean eye-idols) in place of the [[Gorgoneion]].{{sfn|Taylor|2001|p=130}}

Al-Lat was closely related with [[Al-‘Uzzá|Al-'Uzza]], and in some regions of the [[Nabataean Kingdom|Nabataean kingdom]], both Al-Lat and Al-'Uzza were said to be the same goddess. John F. Healey believes that Al-Lat and Al-'Uzza originated as a single goddess, which parted ways in the [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia#Mecca and the Kaaba|pre-Islamic Meccan tradition]].{{sfn|Healey|2001|p=114}} Susan Krone suggests that both Allat and [[Al-‘Uzzá|Al-'Uzza]] were uniquely fused in central Arabia.{{sfn|Krone|1992|p=96}}

== In popular culture ==
In [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[Glossary of Dune terminology|Dune]]'' series, Al-Lat is the name given to the earth's sun.

Multiple allusions, references and parallels are in [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''.

The term was coined by architect [[Paolo Soleri]], who posited that a completed arcology would provide space for a variety of residential, commercial, and agricultural facilities while minimizing individual human [[environmental impact]]. These structures have been largely hypothetical insofar as no arcology, even one envisioned by Soleri himself, has yet been built.

The concept has been popularized by various [[science fiction]] writers. Authors such as [[Peter F. Hamilton|Peter Hamilton]] in ''[[The Neutronium Alchemist|Neutronium Alchemist]]'' and [[Paolo Bacigalupi]] in ''[[The Water Knife]]'' explicitly used arcologies as part of their scenarios. They are often portrayed as self-contained or [[Autarky|economically self-sufficient]].

==Development==
An arcology is distinguished from a merely large building in that it is designed to lessen the [[Human impact on the environment|impact of human habitation]] on any given [[ecosystem]]. It could be self-sustainable, employing all or most of its own available resources for a comfortable life: power; climate control; food production; air and water conservation and purification; sewage treatment; etc. An arcology is designed to make it possible to supply those items for a large population. An arcology would supply and maintain its own municipal or urban infrastructures in order to operate and connect with other urban environments apart from its own.

Arcology was proposed to reduce human impact on natural resources. Arcology designs might apply conventional building and civil engineering techniques in very large, but practical projects in order to achieve pedestrian economies of scale that have proven, post-automobile, to be difficult to achieve in other ways.

Frank Lloyd Wright proposed an early version&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Frank Lloyd, "An Organic Architecture"&lt;/ref&gt; called [[Broadacre City]] although, in contrast to an arcology, Wright's idea is comparatively two-dimensional and depends on a road network. Wright's plan described transportation, agriculture, and commerce systems that would support an economy. Critics said that Wright's solution failed to account for population growth, and assumed a more rigid democracy than the U.S.A. actually has.

[[Buckminster Fuller]] proposed the [[Old Man River's City project]], a domed city with a capacity of 125,000, as a solution to the housing problems in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]].

Paolo Soleri proposed later solutions, and coined the term 'arcology'.&lt;ref&gt;Soleri, Paolo, "Arcology: The City in the Image of Man"&lt;/ref&gt; Soleri describes ways of compacting city structures in three dimensions to combat two-dimensional urban sprawl, to economize on transportation and other energy uses. Like Wright, Soleri proposed changes in transportation, agriculture, and commerce. Soleri explored reductions in [[resource consumption]] and duplication, land reclamation; he also proposed to eliminate most private transportation. He advocated for greater "frugality" and favored greater use of shared social resources, including public transit (and public libraries).

{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}
[[Arcosanti]] is an experimental "arcology prototype" – a demonstration project under construction in central [[Arizona]]. Designed by [[Paolo Soleri]], its primary purpose is to demonstrate Soleri's personal designs, his application of principles of arcology to create a pedestrian-friendly urban form.

Many cities in the world have proposed projects adhering to the design principles of the arcology concept, like [[Tokyo]], and  [[Dongtan, Shanghai|Dongtan]] near [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,6903,1635188,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=British to help China build 'eco-cities' | first=Frank | last=Kane | date=November 6, 2005 | accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dongtan project may have collapsed, and it failed to open for the [[Expo 2010|Shanghai World Expo]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/23/greenwash-dongtan-ecocity|title=Greenwash: The dream of the first eco-city was built on a fiction|author=Fred Pearce|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain urban projects reflect arcology principles. Pedestrian connection systems often provide a wide range of goods and services in a single structure. Some examples include the [[+15]] system in downtown [[Calgary]], Montréal's [[RÉSO]], the [[Minneapolis Skyway System]], The Windscreen in [[Fermont|Fermont, Quebec]], and the [[Houston tunnel system|Houston, Texas tunnel system]]. They include supermarkets, malls and entertainment complexes. The +15 is the world's most extensive skywalk, at {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} in total length. Minneapolis has the longest single path, at {{convert|8|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}}. [[Seward's Success, Alaska]] was never built, but would have been a small city just outside [[Anchorage]]. [[Chicago]] has a sizeable tunnel system known as the [[Chicago Pedway]] connecting a portion of the buildings in the [[Chicago Loop]].

The [[Las Vegas Strip]] has many arcology features to protect people from the {{convert|45|C}} heat. Many major casinos are connected by tunnels, footbridges, and monorails. It is possible to travel from [[Mandalay Bay]] at the south end of the Strip to the [[Las Vegas Convention Center]], {{convert|3|mi|km|0|spell=in}} to the north, without using streets. In many cases, it is possible to travel between several different casinos without ever going outdoors. It is possible to live in this complex without need to venture outside, except the Strip has not generally been considered self-sustainable. Soleri did not advocate for enclosed cities, although he did sketch a design and build a model of an 'arcology' for outer space.

The [[Toronto]] downtown area features an underground pedestrian network, [[PATH (Toronto)|PATH]]. Multiple high-rises are connected by a series of underground tunnels. It is possible to live in this complex without needing to venture outside, but the PATH network is not self-sustaining. The total network spans {{convert|28|km|mi|abbr=off|adj=off}}.

[[McMurdo Station]] of the [[United States Antarctic Program]] and other scientific research stations on [[Antarctica]] resemble the popular conception of an arcology as a technologically advanced, relatively self-sufficient human community. The Antarctic research base provides living and entertainment amenities for roughly 3,000 staff who visit each year. Its remoteness and the measures needed to protect its population from the harsh environment give it an insular character. The station is not self-sufficient{{snd}}the U.S. military delivers 30,000 cubic metres (8,000,000 US gal) of fuel and {{convert|11|e6lb|order=flip|abbr=off|sigfig=1}} of supplies and equipment yearly through its [[Operation Deep Freeze]] resupply effort&lt;ref&gt;''Modern Marvels: Sub-Zero''. The History Channel.&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}but it is isolated from conventional support networks. The base generates electricity with its own power plant, and grows fruits and vegetables in a hydroponic green &lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antarctichydroponics.com/|title=Antar|work=antarctichydroponics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;  house when resupply is non-existent. Under [[Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty|international treaty]], it must avoid damage to the surrounding ecosystem.

[[Crystal Island]] is a proposed arcology in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]]. In 2009, construction was postponed indefinitely due to the [[Global financial crisis of 2008–2009|global economic crisis]].

The [[Begich Towers]] operates like a small-scale arcology encompassing nearly all of the population of [[Whittier, Alaska]]. The pair of buildings contains residential housing as well as a school, grocery, and municipal offices.
Whittier once boasted a second structure known as the Buckner Building. The Buckner Building still stands but was deemed unfit for habitation after the 1969 earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digg.com/video/everyone-in-this-alaskan-town-lives-in-the-same-building|title=Everyone In This Alaskan Town Lives In The Same Building|work=digg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Most proposals to build real arcologies have failed due to financial, structural or conceptual shortcomings. Arcologies are therefore found primarily in fictional works.&lt;ref&gt;Ash, Theodore (2014) ''Neoarcology''&lt;/ref&gt;

* One of the earliest examples in literature is [[William Hope Hodgson]]'s 1912 horror/fantasy novel ''[[The Night Land]]'', where the last remnants of humanity survive in two enormous self-contained metal pyramids.
* Another significant example is the 1981 novel ''[[Oath of Fealty (novel)|Oath of Fealty]]'' by [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]], in which a segment of the population of Los Angeles has moved into an arcology. The plot examines the social changes that result, both inside and outside the arcology. Thus the arcology is not just a plot device but a subject of critique.&lt;ref&gt;Seed, David (2011) ''Science Fiction: A Very Short Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Robert Silverberg]]'s ''The World Inside'', most of the global population of 750 billion lives inside giant skyscrapers, called "urbmons", each of which contains hundreds of thousands of people. The urbmons are arranged in "constellations". Each urbmon is divided into "neighborhoods" of 40 or so floors. All the needs of the inhabitants are provided inside the building &amp;ndash; food is grown outside and brought into the building &amp;ndash; so the idea of going outside is heretical and can be a sign of madness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Silverberg|Silverberg, Robert]] (1971). ''The World Inside''.

The '''beta angle''' (&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;) is a measurement that is used most notably in [[orbital spaceflight]]. The beta angle determines the percentage of time that a [[satellite]] in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) spends in direct [[sunlight]], absorbing solar energy.&lt;ref name="mcc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/feedback/expert/answer/mcc/sts-113/11_23_20_01_179.html |title=MCC Answers |author=Derek Hassman, NASA Flight Director |date=December 1, 2002 |publisher=NASA |access-date=June 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is defined as the angle between the [[orbital plane (astronomy)|orbital plane]] of the satellite and the [[Euclidean vector|vector]] to the [[Sun]] (i.e., the direction from which the Sun is shining).&lt;ref name="knk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tak2000.com/data/planets/earth.htm |title=Earth's Thermal Environment |year=2008 |work=Thermal Environments JPL D-8160 |publisher=K&amp;K Associates |access-date=July 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beta angle is the smaller of the two angles between the Sun vector and the plane of the object's [[orbit]]. The beta angle does not define a unique orbital plane; all satellites in orbit with a given beta angle at a given altitude have the same exposure to the Sun, even though they may be orbiting in completely different planes around [[Earth]].&lt;ref name="orbit"/&gt;

The beta angle varies between +90° and −90°, and the direction in which the satellite orbits its [[primary (astronomy)|primary body]] determines whether the beta angle sign is positive or negative. An imaginary observer standing on the Sun defines a beta angle as positive if the satellite in question orbits in a counterclockwise direction and negative if it revolves [[clockwise]].&lt;ref name="orbit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wwwiutp.univ-poitiers.fr/COURS-DOCS/docu/ideas/SDRCHelp/LANG/French/tmg_ug/orbit_def.htm |title=Orbit Definition |publisher=Structural Dynamics Research Corporation |year=2001 |access-date=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum amount of time that a satellite in a normal LEO mission can spend in [[Earth's shadow]] occurs at a beta angle of 0°. A satellite in such an orbit spends no more than 59% of its [[orbital period]] in sunlight.&lt;ref name="mcc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="knk"/&gt;

==Light and shadow==
The degree of orbital shadowing an object in LEO experiences is determined by that object's beta angle. An object launched into an initial orbit with an inclination equal to the complement of the Earth's inclination to the ecliptic results in an initial beta angle of 0 degrees (&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; = 0°) for the orbiting object. This allows the object to spend the maximum possible amount of its [[orbital period]] in the Earth's shadow, and results in extremely reduced absorption of solar energy.  At a LEO of 280 kilometers, the object is in sunlight through 59% of its orbit (approximately 53 minutes in Sunlight, and 37 minutes in shadow.&lt;ref name="knk"/&gt;) On the other extreme, an object launched into an orbit parallel to the [[Terminator (solar)|terminator]]  results in a beta angle of 90 degrees (&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; = 90°), and the object is in sunlight 100% of the time.&lt;ref name="knk"/&gt; An example would be a polar orbit initiated at local dawn or dusk on an [[equinox]].  Beta angle can be controlled to keep a satellite as cool as possible (for instruments that require low temperatures, such as infrared cameras) by keeping the beta angle as close to zero as possible, or, conversely, to keep a satellite in sunlight as much as possible (for conversion of sunlight by its solar panels, for solar stability of sensors, or to study the Sun) by maintaining a beta angle as close to +90 or -90 as possible.

==Determination and application of beta angles==

The above discussion defines the beta angle of satellites orbiting the Earth, but a beta angle can be calculated for any orbiting three body system: the same definition can be applied to give the beta angle of other objects.  For example, the beta angle of a satellite in orbit around Mars, with respect to the Earth, defines how much of the time the satellite has a line of sight to the Earth - that is, it determines how long the Earth is shining on the satellite and how long the Earth is blocked from view.  That same satellite also will have a beta angle with respect to the Sun, and in fact it has a beta angle for any celestial object one might wish to calculate one for: any satellite orbiting a body (i.e. the Earth) will be in that body's shadow with respect to a given celestial object (like a star) some of the time, and in its line-of-sight the rest of the time.  Beta angles describing non-[[geocentric]] orbits are important when space agencies launch satellites into orbits around other bodies in the Solar System.

==Importance in spaceflight==

When the [[space shuttle]] was in service on missions to the [[International Space Station]], the beta angle of the space station's orbit was a crucial consideration; periods referred to as "beta cutout",&lt;ref name="mcc"/&gt; during which the shuttle could not safely be launched to the ISS, were a direct result of the beta angle of the space station at those times.  When the orbiter was in-flight (not docked to ISS) and it flew to a beta angle greater than 60 degrees, the orbiter went into "rotisserie" mode, and slowly rotated around its X-axis (nose to tail axis). For flights to ISS, the shuttle could launch during an ISS beta cutout if the ISS would be at a beta less than 60 degrees at dock, and throughout the docked phase.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Therefore, the mission duration affected launch timing when the beta cutout dates were approaching.

'''Brian Tinsley''' is a [[physicist]] who for more than 60 years has been actively researching [[atmospheric and space physics]]. He has been a Professor of Physics at the [[University of Texas at Dallas]] since 1976 and has served many national and international scientific organizations.  He obtained his PhD from the [[University of Canterbury]] in [[New Zealand]] in November, 1963, for research on [[optical emissions]] from the [[upper atmosphere]] ([[airglow]] and [[aurorae]]).  With his wife, [[Beatrice Tinsley]], he came to [[Dallas]] to work at the newly formed [[Southwest Center for Advanced Studies]], which became the [[University of Texas at Dallas]] in 1969.  Beatrice obtained a Ph.D. in [[astrophysics]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], and became a prominent [[astrophysicist]] before she died in 1981, resulting in the [[University of Texas at Austin]] creating the endowed professorship that bears her name.

During his time at the NSF in the late 1980s he began researching the effects of changes in the [[sun]] on [[weather]] and [[climate]] on the day-to-day, decadal and century timescale. He has been author of more than 40 papers on this topic. He has proposed a mechanism in which the link to the [[atmosphere]] is the [[solar wind]] ([[space weather]]) (as opposed to changes in [[solar brightness]])&lt;ref&gt;Apparent Tropospheric Response to Mev-Gev Particle-Flux Variations - A Connection via Electrofreezing of Supercooled Water in High-Level Clouds, Tinsley BA; Deen GW, Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres,  Volume 96, Issue D12,  Pages 22283-22296, {{doi|10.1029/91JD02473}}, 1991. Paper cited 141 times as of Jan 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; that affects the downward ionosphere-earth current density (Jz) in the global atmospheric electric circuit.

He formed the hypothesis that the Jz effects are due to [[electrical charge]] deposited on [[droplets]] and [[aerosol]] particles (notably [[condensation nuclei]] and ice-forming nuclei in clouds) that significantly affect [[scavenging]] processes and the [[concentrations]] of the nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;Correlations of Atmospheric Dynamics With Solar-Activity Evidence for a Connection via the Solar-Wind, Atmospheric Electricity, And Cloud Microphysics, Tinsley BA; Heelis RA, Journal of Geophysical Research-Atmospheres, Volume 98, Issue D6, Pages 10375-10384, {{doi|10.1029/93JD00627}}, JUN 20 1993. Paper cited 100 times as of Jan 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The consequences of this include changes in [[cloud cover]] and rates of precipitation, and changes in surface pressure and [[atmospheric dynamics]], as has been observed.

Dr. Tinsley and Dr. Burns of the [[Australian]] [[Antarctic]] Research Division and Dr. Zhou of the East China Normal University have shown that there are clear [[correlations]] between the [[electric current]] output of the internal atmospheric generators ([[thunderstorms]]) in the [[global electric circuit]] and surface [[pressure]] at both [[Antarctic]] and [[Arctic]] sites, fully consistent with the changes due to the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;Influence of solar wind on the global electric circuit, and inferred effects on cloud microphysics, temperature, and dynamics in the troposphere, Tinsley BA, Conference: Workshop of the ISSI on Solar Variability and Climate, INT SPACE SCI INST, BERN, SWITZERLAND, JUN 28-JUL 02, 1999, SPACE SCIENCE REVIEWS, Volume 94,   Issue 1-2, Pages 231-258, {{doi|10.1023/A:1026775408875}}, Published: NOV 2000. Paper cited 131 times as of Jan 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The zonal-mean and regional tropospheric pressure responses to changes in ionospheric potential, Zhou, L; Tinsley, B; Wang, L; and Burns G;, Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, 171 (2018), 111-118, (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jastp.2017.07.010)&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the work has led to the discovery of an unexpected process in [[meteorology]] that has implications for [[climate]]. That is that the internal generation of [[atmospheric electricity]], mostly in the tropical regions, affects [[clouds]] and [[meteorological]] processes all over the [[globe]]. Because the external as well as this internal  current generation  change on daily, seasonal, and longer timescales (including with [[global warming]]) it is an additional input to [[weather]] and [[climate]] on those timescales that has not been included in current global [[climate]] models. Observations of cloud changes in polar regions and models of cloud charging and the effects of charge on cloud microphysics &lt;ref&gt;The response of longwave radiation at the South Pole to electrical and magnetic variations: Links to meteorological generators and the solar wind, Frederick, JE; and Tinsley, BA; Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics, 179 (2018),214-224, (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jastp.2018.08.003)&lt;/ref&gt;confirm these findings.

'''CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere''' (O&amp;A) is one of the current 8 Business Units (formerly: Flagships) of the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO), [[Australia]]'s largest government-supported science research agency.

[[File:CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research Hobart.jpg|thumb|CSIRO Marine Laboratories in [[Hobart]], home of the largest component of CSIRO O&amp;A staff]]

==History==
The CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (O&amp;A) Business Unit was formed in 2014 as one of the then 10 "Flagship" operational units of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) as part of a major organisational restructure; from 2015 onwards the term "Flagship" was officially dropped. This Business Unit was formed essentially as a synthesis of the pre-existing CSIRO Division of Marine and Atmospheric Research (CMAR), representing the scientific capability, and the previously established Wealth from Oceans (WfO) Flagship, which was the route via which much of the relevant Australian government research funding was directed. As at 2016, its Director is Dr. Ken Lee, previously WfO Flagship Director. The O&amp;A Business Unit currently employs between 350 and 400 staff who are located at its various laboratories including [[Hobart]] ([[Tasmania]]), [[Aspendale,_Victoria|Aspendale]] ([[Victoria_(Australia)|Victoria]]), [[Dutton_Park,_Queensland|Dutton Park]] ([[Queensland]]), Black Mountain ([[Canberra]]) and [[Floreat,_Western_Australia|Floreat Park]] ([[Western Australia]]). For 2016 it was quoted as operating with an annual budget of $108M Australian Dollars with its research organised into the following the following programs: Climate Science Centre; Coastal Development and Management; Earth System Assessment; Engineering and Technology; Marine Resources and Industries; and Ocean and Climate Dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/en/About/Strategy-structure/Corporate-plan|title=CSIRO Corporate Plan 2016-17|publisher=CSIRO|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain previous CMAR activities, notably those involving the operation of the Marine National Facility (research vessel) [[RV Investigator]] and several scientific collections, are now managed within the separate CSIRO National Facilities and Collections Program.

The previous CSIRO Division of Marine and Atmospheric Research was itself formed as a result of a 2005 merger between the former CSIRO Division of Marine Research, with laboratories in Hobart, Brisbane, and Perth, and CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Research, with laboratories in Aspendale and Canberra; the Division of Marine Research was formed in 1997 as a merger between two previous CSIRO Divisions, the Division of Fisheries Research and the Division of Oceanography, both with their headquarters in Hobart since 1984; prior to that time, the Division of Fisheries and Oceanography (subsequently separate Divisions) had occupied facilities in [[Cronulla, New South Wales|Cronulla]], [[New South Wales]] since its inception in 1938&lt;ref&gt;Harley, David. 2012. [http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/449772/Cronulla-fisheries-site-Recommendations-for-future-use.pdf Cronulla Fisheries Site: Recommendations for Future Use. A report prepared for the NSW Department of Primary Industries, November 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; (following the CSIRO's departure this site became the New South Wales State [[Cronulla Fisheries Research Centre]]). Additional details of the somewhat convoluted organisational history of the relevant Divisions and their predecessors are available here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://csiropedia.csiro.au/marine-and-atmospheric-research-2005/|title=Marine and Atmospheric Research Divisions|publisher=CSIROpedia|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seagoing capabilities==
Through the 1980s and 1990s the marine Divisions of CSIRO had the use of both the [[RV Southern Surveyor]], equipped for biological as well as oceanographic research, and the purpose built [[RV Franklin]] for physical and chemical oceanographic research, both of which served at various times as the Marine National Facility for the nation (meaning that other agencies could also carry out research using these vessels at what was effectively a subsidised rate by the Australian government). The last of the vessels to be retired, the Southern Surveyor, was replaced in 2014 by a new purpose built research vessel to serve as the Marine National Facility, the [[RV Investigator]]. Coupled with these major vessels, all capable of significant ocean-going research expeditions, staff were able to use a range of smaller boats and sometimes, charter vessels to carry out research in a range of coastal waters.

==2016 Climate Science cuts controversy and subsequent partial restoration==
In February 2016 the chief executive of CSIRO, [[Larry_R._Marshall|Dr Larry Marshall]], announced that research into the fundamentals of climate science was no longer a priority for CSIRO and up to 110 jobs were feared to be cut from the climate research section(s) of the Oceans and Atmosphere Unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/climate-will-be-all-gone-as-csiro-swings-jobs-axe-scientists-say-20160203-gml7jy.html|title=Climate science to be gutted as CSIRO swings jobs axe|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After overwhelming negative reaction both within Australia and overseas, along with the forced redundancy of prominent climate scientists including the internationally renowned sea level expert [[John_A._Church|Dr John Church]], the Australian Government intervened with a directive and promise of new money to support the restoration of 15 jobs and the creation of a new Climate Science Centre to be based in Hobart with a staff of 40, with funding guaranteed for 10 years from 2016, although the expected number of job losses for O&amp;A was still estimated at 75.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2016/04/26/csiro-reduce-job-cuts-still-275-go|title=CSIRO reduce job cuts but still 275 to go|publisher=SBS|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the establishment of the new Centre was described as a "major U-turn in the direction of the CSIRO"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/turnbull-government-order-csiro-uturn-towards-climate-science-20160803-gqk2pr.html|title=Turnbull government orders CSIRO U-turn towards climate science|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a win for the Turnbull government over the previous CSIRO announcement, the generally positive reaction from other scientists was qualified by the fact that the new Centre would still represent a net loss to CSIRO's previous capability in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scimex.org/newsfeed/expert-reaction-csiro-announces-climate-science-centre|title=EXPERT REACTION: CSIRO announces Climate Science Centre|publisher=scimex|accessdate=4 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed account of this episode is available elsewhere on Wikipedia [[Larry_R._Marshall#Controversy_over_climate_research_cutbacks|here]].

==Books on CSIRO's marine research activities==
''CSIRO At Sea'', a "popular" account of the early research activities of the marine components of the relevant CSIRO Divisions (former Divisions of Fisheries, Fisheries and Oceanography, Oceanography, and Fisheries Research) was published in 1988, a few years after the relocation of the majority of CSIRO's marine research activities to Hobart from [[Cronulla,_New_South_Wales|Cronulla]], [[New South Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=CSIRO at Sea: 50 Years of Marine Science|editor=Mawson, V.A. |editor2=Tranter, D.J. |editor3=Pearce, A.F. |publisher=CSIRO Marine Laboratories|year=1988|isbn=0-643-04835-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Forest above the Allt Ruadh - geograph.org.uk - 318433.jpg|thumb|right|Caledonian Forest above the Allt Ruadh]]

The '''Caledonian Forest''' is the name given to the former (ancient [[old-growth forest|old-growth]]) [[temperate rainforest]] of [[Scotland]]. The name comes to us from [[Pliny the Elder]] who reveals that 30 years after the Roman invasion of Britain their knowledge of it did not extend beyond the neighbourhood of ''silva caledonia''. He gives no information about where the ''silva caledonia'' was, but the known extent of the Roman occupation suggest that it was north of the [[River Clyde]] and west of the [[River Tay]].

The [[Scots pine]]s of the Caledonian Forest are directly descended from the first pines to arrive in Scotland following the [[Late Glacial]]; arriving about [[7000&amp;nbsp;BC]]. The forest reached its maximum extent about [[5000&amp;nbsp;BC]], after which the Scottish climate became wetter and windier. This changed climate reduced the extent of the forest significantly by [[2000&amp;nbsp;BC]]. From that date, human actions (including the grazing effects of sheep and deer) reduced it to its current extent.

Today, that forest exists as 35&amp;nbsp;remnants, as authenticated by Steven &amp; Carlisle (1959)&lt;ref name="Steven H.M 1959"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Steven|first1=Henry Marshall|last2=Carlisle|first2=A.|title=The Native Pinewoods of Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZecsAQAAMAAJ|year=1959|publisher=Oliver and Boyd}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or 84 remnants, including later subjective subdivisions of the 35) covering about {{convert|180|km2}} or {{convert|44000|acre}}. The Scots pines of these remnants are, by definition, directly descended from the first pines to arrive in Scotland following the ice age. These remnants have adapted genetically to different Scottish environments, and as such, are globally unique; their ecological characteristics form an unbroken, 9000&amp;nbsp;year chain of natural evolution with a distinct variety of soils, vegetation, and animals.

To a great extent the remnants survived on land that was either too steep, too rocky, or too remote to be agriculturally useful. The largest remnants are in [[Strathspey, Scotland|Strathspey]] and [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire#Strathdee|Strath Dee]] on highly acidic, freely drained glacial deposits that are of little value for cultivation and domestic stock. An examination of the earliest maps of Scotland suggests that the extent of the Caledonian Forest remnants has changed little since 1600.

==History==
Following the [[last glacial period]], [[tree]]s began to recolonise what is now the [[British Isles]] over a [[land bridge]] which is now beneath the [[Strait of Dover#Geoligical formation|Strait of Dover]]. Forests of this type were found all over what is now the island of [[Great Britain]] for a few thousand years, before the [[climate]] began to slowly warm in the [[Atlantic (period)|Atlantic period]], and the [[temperate coniferous forest]]s began retreating north into the [[Scottish Highlands]], the last remaining climatic region suitable for them in the British Isles (see [[Climate of Scotland]]).

[[File:Caledonian Pine woods near Loch an Eilein - geograph.org.uk - 88408.jpg|thumb|right|Caledonian pinewoods near [[Loch an Eilein]]]]

The [[Indigenous (ecology)|native]] pinewoods which formed this westernmost outpost of the [[taiga]] of post-glacial Europe are estimated to have covered {{convert|15,000|km2|acre|abbr=on}} as a vast [[wilderness]] of Scots pine, [[birch]], [[Sorbus aucuparia|rowan]], [[Populus tremula|aspen]], [[Juniperus communis|juniper]], [[oak]] and a few other hardy species. On the west coast, oak and birch predominated in a [[temperate rainforest]] [[ecosystem]] rich in [[fern]]s, [[moss]]es and [[lichen]]s.

==Legend and folklore==
In the [[Matter of Britain]], the forest is the site of one of [[King Arthur]]'s Twelve Battles, according to the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', in which the battle is called ''Cat Coit Celidon''. Scholars [[Rachel Bromwich]] and Marged Haycock suggest that the army of trees animated by sorcerers in the Old Welsh poem ''[[Cad Goddeu]]'' ("Battle of the Trees") are intended to be the Caledonian Forest.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Thomas (2007). ''Concepts of Arthur'', p.&amp;nbsp;64. Stroud, Gloucestershire: Tempus. {{ISBN|978-0-7524-4461-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In related [[Merlin]] literature, the figure of [[Myrddin Wyllt]] retreated to these woods in his madness after the [[Battle of Arfderydd]] in the year 573. He fled from the alleged wrath of the king of Strathclyde, [[Rhydderch Hael]], after the slaying of [[Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio]]. This is written in the two Merlinic poems in [[Middle Welsh]] ''[[Yr Oinau]]'' and ''[[Yr Afallenau]]'' in the [[Black Book of Carmarthen]]. The forest is also the retreat of another character named [[Lailoken]] from the ''[[Saint Mungo|Vita Kentigerni]]'', who also fled into the woods in a fit of madness and who may be the original model for Myrddin Wyllt.

In the Middle Welsh story ''[[Culhwch and Olwen]]'', the main character [[Culhwch]] is the son of a king named Celyddon Wledig, who may or may not be related to the forest in name. Another figure from the same story, Cyledyr Wyllt hints at a close relationship of the forest being a retreat for people who suffered from a special kind of madness or ''gwyllt'' (Irish ''geilt''). In line 994 to 996 of the story, it is briefly explained, "a Chyledyr Wyllt y uab, a llad Nwython a oruc a diot y gallon, a chymhell yssu callon y dat, ac am hynny yd aeth Kyledyr yg gwyllt" ("and his son Kyledyr the Wild. Gwynn killed Nwython and cut out his heart, and forced Kyledyr to eat his father's heart, and that is how Kyledyr went mad"). Though not named directly, the very name Kyledyr Wyllt is close to the two related notions of the forest of ''Celyddon'' being where people suffering madness or ''gwyllt'' hide.

==Conservation==
A review of the native pinewoods of Scotland ''Steven &amp; Carlisle (1959)''&lt;ref name="Steven H.M 1959"/&gt; highlighted the plight of the remaining 35 ancient pinewood sites, many of which had been damaged by felling, fire and intensive grazing from sheep and deer. A later review in the 1980s &lt;ref&gt;Bain C.G. (1987). ''Native Pinewoods in Scotland: A Review 1957-1987'', Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, Sandy.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that further damage had occurred through ploughing and planting with non-native conifers with less than 12,000&amp;nbsp;ha of the ancient habitat remaining.  A subsequent guide to the ancient pinewoods reviews the conservation story and provides a summary of the management in each site as well as a guide on how to reach all the woods using public transport, walking, and cycling.&lt;ref&gt;Bain C.G. (2013) The Ancient Pinewoods of Scotland, A Travellers Guide. Sandstone Press, Dingwall&lt;/ref&gt; Much of remaining Caledonian pine forest is fully [[Protected areas|protect]]ed, and much of the forest now lies within the [[Cairngorms National Park]]. The [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] (RSPB) and the [[Forestry Commission]] also own several areas of pinewood on their reserves. One of the largest remaining areas is Ballochbuie Forest on the [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral Estate]], which is protected as a [[Special Area of Conservation]] under the European Union [[Habitats Directive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jncc.gov.uk/ProtectedSites/SACselection/sac.asp?EUCode=UK0030030 |title=Ballolchbuie SAC: Site Details |publisher=Joint Nature Conservation Committee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific research continues on the ecology of the Caledonian Forest and its restoration.  Populations of the rare groundcover, ''[[Linnaea borealis]]'', may be too isolated from one another to produce viable seed.&lt;ref name=scob09/&gt;  Diversity of [[fungi]] has also been affected by the decrease in habitat.&lt;ref name=newt02/&gt; The [[agaric]] fungus ''[[Mycena purpureofusca]]'' is commonly found in Caledonian pine woods,&lt;ref name="Orton 1986"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Orton PD |title=Fungi of northern pine and birch woods |journal=Bulletin of the British Mycological Society |year=1986 |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=130–45 |doi=10.1016/S0007-1528(86)80042-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is considered an [[indicator species]] for that habitat type.&lt;ref name="Tofts 1998"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tofts RJ, Orton PD |title=The species accumulation curve for agarics and boleti from a Caledonian pinewood |journal=Mycologist |year=1998 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=98–102 |doi=10.1016/S0269-915X(98)80002-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[wildfire|Fire]] appears to increase the natural recruitment of Scots pine seedlings.&lt;ref name=han05/&gt;

===Regeneration===
The charity [[Trees for Life (Scotland)]] has been working to conserve the remaining forest, and reforest areas where it has been lost. This involves the reintroduction of the full range of native flora, including funguses which assist soil regeneration&lt;ref&gt;[https://treesforlife.org.uk/work/ "Trees for Life - What we do"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/20/magical-mushroom-mix-to-boost-regrowth-of-lost-scottish-forests "‘Magical' mushroom mix to boost regrowth of lost Scottish forests"]&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Reintroductions===
In recent years, there has been a growing interest to reintroduce animals which are currently extinct in [[Great Britain]], back into Caledonian pine forests. Corporations have been set up to persuade the government to allow this. The long-running campaign to reintroduce the Eurasian beaver to [[Knapdale]] in [[Argyll]] has been successful,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scotsbeavers.org "They're back!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216174146/http://www.scotsbeavers.org/ |date=2006-02-16 }} The Scottish Beaver Network (viewed 11&amp;nbsp;June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; and there is some support for the reintroduction of the [[Gray wolf]] and [[Eurasian lynx]].

Recently, some landowners have announced plans to build large [[game reserve]]s on their land and release the species within them.&lt;ref name=yale/&gt; Paul Lister plans to release Eurasian lynx, brown bear, grey wolf, elk, wild boar and species already present in Scotland into a huge {{convert|200|km2|acre|abbr=on|adj=on}} enclosure at his estate, [[Alladale Wilderness Reserve]],&lt;ref name=yale/&gt; although releasing top predators such as wolves and bears has become a difficult proposition with local and national regulations.&lt;ref name=yale/&gt; An initial trial enclosure of {{convert|5.5|km2|acre|abbr=on}} was built with elk, wild boar, red deer and roe deer.&lt;ref name=yale/&gt;

==Remaining pinewoods==
Bain (2013) lists 38&amp;nbsp;ancient pinewood sites in Britain which have been identified as the most genuinely native and natural. All of them occur in the Scottish Highlands. The Caledonian Pinewood Inventory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jones A. T. | year = 1999 | title = The Caledonian Pinewood Inventory of Scotland's Native Scots Pine Woodlands | url = | journal = Scottish Forestry | volume = 53 | issue = | pages = 237–242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; identifies 84&amp;nbsp;pinewood sites which includes smaller sub-units of the main sites. A new comprehensive survey of the native woodlands of Scotland from Forestry Commission Scotland and supported by Scottish Natural Heritage is due to be completed in 2014.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9057">The '''California Energy Code''', part 6 of the [[California Building Standards Code]] which is title 24 of the [[California Code of Regulations]], also titled '''The Energy Efficiency Standards for Residential and Nonresidential Buildings''', were created by the [[California Building Standards Commission]] in 1978 in response to a legislative mandate to reduce California's [[Domestic energy consumption|energy consumption]]. The standards are updated periodically by the [[California Energy Commission]] to allow consideration and possible incorporation of new [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] technologies and methods. The California Energy Code (CEC) contains energy conservation standards applicable to most residential and nonresidential buildings throughout California, including schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://shop.iccsafe.org/2016-california-energy-code-title-24-part-6-1.html|title=2016 California Energy Code, Title 24, Part 6|website=shop.iccsafe.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2008 Code ==
The Energy Commission adopted the 2008 Standards on April 23, 2008, and the Building Standards Commission approved them for publication on September 11, 2008. The 2008 Residential Compliance Manual was adopted by the Commission on December 17, 2008, and the 2008 Non-residential Compliance Manual was adopted January 14, 2009.

The requirement for when the 2008 standards must be followed is dependent on when the application for the building permit is submitted. If the application for the building permit is submitted on or after 1/1/10, the 2008 standards must be met.

The Energy Commission adopted the 2008 changes to the Building Energy Efficiency Standards for a number of compelling reasons:

1.To provide California with an adequate, reasonably-priced, and environmentally-sound supply of energy.

2.To respond to Assembly Bill 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006, which mandates that California must reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.

3.To pursue California energy policy that energy efficiency is the resource of first choice for meeting California's energy needs.

4.To act on the findings of California's Integrated Energy Policy Report (IEPR) that Standards are the most cost effective means to achieve energy efficiency, expects the Building Energy Efficiency Standards to continue to be upgraded over time to reduce electricity and peak demand, and recognizes the role of the Standards in reducing energy related to meeting California's water needs and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

5.To meet the West Coast Governors' Global Warming Initiative commitment to include aggressive energy efficiency measures into updates of state building codes.

6.To meet the Executive Order in the Green Building Initiative to improve the energy efficiency of nonresidential buildings through aggressive standards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11645">The '''Caribbean large igneous province''' ('''CLIP''') consists of a major [[flood basalt]], which created this [[large igneous province]] (LIP). It is the source of the current large eastern Pacific oceanic plateau, of which the Caribbean-Colombian oceanic plateau is the tectonized remnant. The deeper levels of the plateau have been exposed on its margins at the [[North American plate|North]] and [[South American plate]]s. The [[volcanism]] took place between 139 and 69 million years ago, with the majority of activity appearing to lie between 95 and 88 Ma.  The [[plateau]] volume has been estimated as on the order of 4 x 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; km³.  It has been linked to the [[Galápagos hotspot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Courtillot|Renne|2003}}; {{Harvnb|Hoernle|Hauff|van den Bogaard|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proto-Caribbean Seaway==
Divergence between the [[North American Plate|North American]] and [[South American Plate]]s began to create [[oceanic crust]] off Colombia's Pacific coast by the end of the Jurassic (150 Ma).  This divergence, which continued until at least 66 Ma, first resulted in a "[[Proto-Caribbean Seaway|proto-Caribbean]] spreading ridge" between these plates flanked by a perpendicular transform zone on its Pacific side.  By 135–130 Ma, the subduction of the [[Farallon Plate]] had begun along this transform zone, effectively modifying it into a subduction zone and beginning the creation of the Great Caribbean Arch.  This arch was formed around 120-115 Ma but must have been intersected by the Caribbean spreading ridge until 66 Ma.  Hence, the Farallon Plate fed the spreading zone and later became the Caribbean Plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Serrano|Ferrari|Martínez|Petrone|2011|loc=5.2. Geodynamic setting during the formation of the CLIP, p. 332; Fig. 8, p. 333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LIP formation==
CLIP formed as a large igneous province and now forms a thickened zone of oceanic crust between the North American and South American Plates.&lt;ref name="Loewen-etal-p4241"&gt;{{Harvnb|Loewen|Duncan|Kent|Krawl|2013|loc=Introduction, pp. 4241–4242}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some places the oceanic crust is 2–3 times as thick as normal oceanic crust ({{Convert|15|-|20|km|abbr=on}} vs {{Convert|7|km|abbr=on}}.  Its composition is similar to that of the [[Ontong Java Plateau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hauff|Hoernle|Tilton|Graham|2000|loc=2. Geological background, pp. 248–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geochemical and geochronological evidences clearly indicate that the Galápagos hotspot initiated the formation of the CLIP 95-90 Ma in the eastern Pacific.  From there it move north-east with the Farallon Plate between the two American plates until it collided with a [[volcanic arc]], the [[Greater Antilles]] 60 million years later.  Fragments of this voyage is preserved in accreted [[seamount]]s along the Central American coast and the [[Cocos Ridge|Cocos]] and [[Carnegie Ridge]]s.  Isotopic profiles of Galápagos rocks can be matched with those from CLIP rocks.&lt;ref name="Loewen-etal-p4241" /&gt;

92–63 Ma [[Argon-argon dating|&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar/&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Ar ages]] have been reported for the [[Curaçao]] Lava Formation and 94–83 ma for the [[Dumisseau Formation]] in Haiti, dating both locations back to the original LIP formation 94 Ma.  CLIP volcanism originates from the plume-like source distinct from a [[MORB]] (mid-ocean ridge basalt) mantle.  The long duration of CLIP volcanism can be explained by the interaction between a plume and the Greater Antilles subduction zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Loewen|Duncan|Kent|Krawl|2013|loc=Conclusions, pp. 4256–4257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The margins of the CLIP have been uplifted and are exposed above sea level, which makes it unique among oceanic plateaus.  It stretches {{Convert|2500|km|abbr=on}} east to west and {{Convert|1300|km|abbr=on}} north to south.&lt;ref name="Court-Rene-Intro"&gt;{{Harvnb|Courtillot|Renne|2003|loc=Introduction, p. 697}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geldmacher 2003 loc=Introduction"&gt;{{Harvnb|Geldmacher|Hanan|Blichert‐Toft|Harpp|2003|loc=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CLIP is composed of irregularly thickened (up to {{Convert|20|km|abbr=on}}) oceanic crust of the [[Caribbean Plate]] and the deformed associated magmatic terranes [[obduction|obducted]] onto the Pacific coasts of northern South America, Central America, and the Antilles.  One of the least deformed parts is [[Gorgona Island, Colombia|Gorgona Island]] off Colombia's Pacific coast.&lt;ref name="Court-Rene-Intro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Geldmacher 2003 loc=Introduction"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Serrano|Ferrari|Martínez|Petrone|2011|loc=Introduction, pp. 324–325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CLIP was created during three phases of eruptions dating between the [[Aptian]] and the [[Maastrichtian]]: a first phase 124–112 Ma; the main magma production phase 94–83 Ma; and an 80–72 Ma phase.  The youngest igneous rocks, in the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica, are from 63 Ma.
That the CLIP originated in the Pacific is obvious because fragments of oceanic crust accreted to the margins of the Caribbean, for example on [[Hispaniola]] and [[Puerto Rico]], contain fauna of Pacific provenance.&lt;ref name="Escuder-etal-p309"&gt;{{Harvnb|Escuder-Viruete|Pérez-Estaun|Joubert|Weis|2011|loc=The Caribbean large igneous province, p. 309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Farallon Plate's eastward movement forced the northern half of the CLIP into the ocean basin that had opened between North and South America starting in the Jurassic.  However, the mechanisms causing the NE movement of the CLIP remains unclear, especially considering the subduction in the Costa Rica-Panama arc initiated during the [[Campanian]] (83–72 Ma).  The Galápagos hotspot is probably responsible for the main plume-related magmatic event 90 Ma, whilst the 76 Ma and 55 Ma event are related to lithospheric thinning in the Central Caribbean.&lt;ref name="Escuder-etal-p309" /&gt;

[[Argon-argon dating|&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar/&lt;sup&gt;39&lt;/sup&gt;Ar dating]] have determined that the main magmatism occurred {{Ma|95|83}} (Ma) while a second pulse occurred 81-69 Ma.  Around 86 Ma the arrival of a large plume initiated the Galápagos hotspot which resulted in volcanism over large parts of the Caribbean Plate and north-west South America.  Renewed volcanism about 75 Ma has been attributed to either the Galápagos hotspot, thinning of the lithosphere coupled with associated melting and upwelling of plume-head material, or both.&lt;ref name="Court-Rene-Intro" /&gt;

Seismic and geochemical analyses, on the other hand, suggest the CLIP consists of several oceanic plateaus and palaeo-hotspot tracks formed 139-83 Ma some of which have been overprinted by later magmatism.&lt;ref name="Court-Rene-Intro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Court-Rene-Conclusions"&gt;{{Harvnb|Courtillot|Renne|2003|p=700}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If these first volcanic activities were generated by the Galápagos hotspot, it would make it the oldest still active hotspot on Earth.&lt;ref name="Court-Rene-Conclusions" /&gt;

'''Cirrocumulus floccus''' is a type of [[cirrocumulus cloud]]. The name ''cirrocumulus floccus'' is derived from [[Latin]], meaning "a lock of wool".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Definition of floccus |url=http://latinlexicon.org/definition.php?p1=1006366 |accessdate=13 July 2011 |author=Numen - The Latin Lexicon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cirrocumulus floccus appears as small tufts of cloud with rounded heads, but ragged bottoms. The cloud can produce [[virga]], precipitation that evaporates before reaching the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dunlop |first=Storm |title=The weather identification handbook |year=2003 |publisher=Lyons Press |location=Guilford, Conn. |isbn=1-58574-857-9 |pages=66 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BR2ft4G5TgQC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage&amp;q=Cirrocumulus%20floccus&amp;f=false |edition=1st Lyons Press |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[cirrocumulus castellanus]], cirrocumulus floccus is an indicator of [[atmospheric instability]] at the level of the cloud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Callanan |first=Martin |title=Cirrocumulus floccus |url=http://nephology.eu/cirrocumulus/cirrocumulus-floccus |work=International Cloud Atlas |publisher=nephology.eu |accessdate=13 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, cirrocumulus floccus can form from cirrocumulus castellanus, being the evolutionary state after the base of the original cloud has dissipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=floccus |url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=floccus1 |work=Glossary of Meteorology |accessdate=13 July 2011 |author=American Meteorological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Co-benefits in policy-making==
Co-benefits of GHG mitigation can be an important decision criteria in analyses carried out by policy-makers, but they are often neglected, and often the co-benefits are not quantified, monetised or even identified by businesses and decision-makers. Appropriate consideration of co-benefits can greatly influence policy decisions concerning the timing and level of mitigation action, and there can be significant advantages to the national economy and technical innovation.&lt;ref name=ipcc /&gt;

==Co-benefits in research ==
Different research groups currently examine the impacts of co-benefits of climate change mitigation. One of these projects is the COBENEFITS project of the [[Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies]] in [[Potsdam]], Germany. The COBENEFITS project is part of the International Climate Initiative (IKI). The [[Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] (BMU) supports this initiative on the basis of a decision adopted by the German [[Bundestag]]. The project is conducted in close collaboration with government ministries, agencies, research institutions, and think tanks as political partners and knowledge partners in the target countries. These four target countries are [[India]], [[South Africa]], [[Turkey]], and [[Vietnam]]. The project team, thereby, cooperates with national authorities and knowledge partners to develop key insights that enable them to mobilise these co-benefits in their countries and accelerate domestic processes aimed at achieving their international climate protection commitments.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cobenefits.info/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knight's Point, West Coast.jpg|thumb|Rugged coastline of the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast Region]] of [[New Zealand]]]]

The '''coast''', also known as the '''coastline''' or '''seashore''', is the area where land meets the [[sea]] or [[ocean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition|year=2000|title=Coast|url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/43/C0434300.html|accessdate=2008-12-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201151523/http://www.bartleby.com/61/43/C0434300.html|archivedate=2009-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or  a line that forms the boundary between the land and the [[ocean]] or a [[lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Merriam-Webster Dictionary Internet edition|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coastline|accessdate=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A precise line that can be called a coastline cannot be determined due to the [[Coastline paradox]].

The term ''coastal zone'' is a region where interaction of the sea and land processes occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephen A.|last=Nelson|title=Coastal Zones|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/geol204/coastalzones.htm|year=2007|accessdate=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the terms coast and coastal are often used to describe a geographic location or region; for example, New Zealand's [[West Coast Region|West Coast]], or the [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coasts of the United States]]. Edinburgh for example is a city on the coast of Great Britain.

A [[pelagic]] coast refers to a coast which fronts the open ocean, as opposed to a more sheltered coast in a gulf or [[bay]]. A [[shore]], on the other hand, can refer to parts of land adjoining any large [[body of water]], including oceans (sea shore) and [[lake]]s (lake shore). Similarly, the somewhat related term "[stream bed/bank]" refers to the land alongside or sloping down to a [[river]] (riverbank) or body of water smaller than a lake. "Bank" is also used in some parts of the world to refer to an artificial ridge of earth intended to retain the water of a river or [[pond]]; in other places this may be called a [[levee]].
 
While many scientific experts might agree on a common definition of the term "coast", the delineation of the extents of a coast differ according to [[jurisdiction]], with many scientific and government authorities in various countries differing for economic and social policy reasons. According to the UN atlas, 44% of people live within {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=off}} of the sea.&lt;ref name="UN Atlas"&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Atlas|url=http://coastalchallenges.com/2010/01/31/un-atlas-60-of-us-live-in-the-coastal-areas/|accessdate=31 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102170907/http://coastalchallenges.com/2010/01/31/un-atlas-60-of-us-live-in-the-coastal-areas/|archivedate=2 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation {{anchor|Formation of Coasts}}==
[[File:Porto Covo pano April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Atlantic rocky coastline, showing a surf area. Porto Covo, west coast of Portugal]]
[[Tide]]s often determine the range over which [[sediment]] is deposited or eroded. Areas with high tidal ranges allow waves to reach farther up the shore, and areas with lower tidal ranges produce deposition at a smaller elevation interval. The tidal range is influenced by the size and shape of the coastline. Tides do not typically cause erosion by themselves; however, [[tidal bore]]s can erode as the waves surge up river [[Estuary|estuaries]] from the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (2002), p.421.&lt;/ref&gt;

Waves erode coastline as they break on shore releasing their energy; the larger the wave the more energy it releases and the more sediment it moves. Coastlines with longer shores have more room for the waves to disperse their energy, while coasts with cliffs and short shore faces give little room for the wave energy to be dispersed. In these areas the wave energy breaking against the cliffs is higher, and air and water are compressed into cracks in the rock, forcing the rock apart, breaking it down. Sediment deposited by waves comes from eroded cliff faces and is moved along the coastline by the waves. This forms an [[abrasion coast|abrasion]] or [[cliffed coast]].

Sediment deposited by rivers is the dominant influence on the amount of sediment located on a coastline.&lt;ref name=Easterbrook&gt;Easterbrook (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Today riverine deposition at the coast is often blocked by dams and other human regulatory devices, which remove the sediment from the stream by causing it to be deposited inland.

Like the ocean which shapes them, coasts are a dynamic environment with constant change. The Earth's natural processes, particularly [[sea level rise]]s, waves and various [[weather]] phenomena, have resulted in the [[erosion]], [[Accretion (geology)|accretion]] and reshaping of coasts as well as flooding and creation of [[continental shelf|continental shelves]] and drowned river valleys ([[ria]]s).

==Environmental importance==
[[File:Somalia 16.08.2009 08-30-13.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Somalia]] has the longest coastline in Africa]]
The coast and its adjacent areas on and off shore are an important part of a local [[ecosystem]]: the mixture of [[fresh water]] and [[Seawater|salt water]] ([[brackish water]]) in [[estuary|estuaries]] provides many nutrients for marine life. [[Salt marsh]]es and [[beach]]es also support a diversity of [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s and [[insect]]s crucial to the [[food chain]].

The high level of [[biodiversity]] creates a high level of biological activity, which has attracted human activity for thousands of years.

More and more of the world's people live in coastal regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Sara|last=Goudarzi|title=Flocking to the Coast: World's Population Migrating into Danger|journal=Live Science|date=July 18, 2006|url=http://www.livescience.com/environment/060718_map_settle.html|accessdate=2008-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many major cities are on or near good [[harbor]]s and have [[port]] facilities. Some  [[landlocked]] places have achieved port status by building [[canal]]s.

The coast is a frontier that nations have typically defended against military invaders, smugglers and illegal migrants. Fixed [[Coastal defence and fortification|coastal defenses]] have long been erected in many nations and coastal countries typically have a [[navy]] and some form of [[coast guard]].

Coasts, especially those with [[beach]]es and warm water, attract [[tourists]]. In many [[island nation]]s such as those of the Mediterranean, South Pacific and Caribbean, tourism is central to the economy. Coasts offer recreational activities such as [[human swimming|swimming]], [[fishing]], [[surfing]], [[boating]], and [[Sunlight#Sunbathing|sunbathing]]. [[Growth management]] can be a challenge for coastal [[local government|local authorities]] who often struggle to provide the [[infrastructure]] required by new residents.

===Threats to a coast===
Coasts also face many [[Human impact on the environment|human-induced environmental impacts]]. The human influence on [[climate change]] is thought to contribute to an accelerated trend in [[sea level rise]] which threatens coastal [[habitat]]s.

[[Marine pollution|Pollution]] can occur from a number of sources: [[Marine debris|garbage and industrial debris]]; the [[Petroleum transport|transportation of petroleum]] in [[tanker (ship)|tankers]], increasing the probability of large [[oil spill]]s; small oil spills created by large and small vessels, which flush [[bilge]] water into the ocean.

Fishing has declined due to [[Environmental effects of fishing|habitat degradation]], [[overfishing]], [[trawling]], [[bycatch]] and [[climate change]]. Since the growth of global fishing enterprises after the 1950s, intensive fishing has spread from a few concentrated areas to encompass nearly all fisheries. The scraping of the ocean floor in [[Bottom trawling|bottom dragging]] is devastating to [[coral]], [[sponges]] and other long-lived species that do not recover quickly. This destruction alters the functioning of the ecosystem and can permanently alter species composition and biodiversity. [[Bycatch]], the capture of unintended species in the course of fishing, is typically returned to the ocean only to die from injuries or exposure. Bycatch represents about a quarter of all marine catch. In the case of [[shrimp]] capture, the bycatch is five times larger than the shrimp caught.

It is believed that melting [[Arctic ice]] will cause sea levels to rise and flood coastal areas.

===Conservation===
Extraordinary [[population growth]] in the 21st century has placed stress on the planet's ecosystems. For example, on [[Saint Lucia]], harvesting [[mangrove]] for timber and clearing for fishing reduced the mangrove forests, resulting in a [[habitat loss|loss of habitat]] and spawning grounds for marine life that was unique to the area. These forests also helped to stabilize the coastline. Conservation efforts since the 1980s have partially [[ecological restoration|restored the ecosystem]].

==Types of coast==
According to one principle of classification, an emergent coastline is a coastline which has experienced a fall in sea level, because of either a global sea level change, or local uplift. Emergent coastlines are identifiable by the coastal [[landform]]s, which are above the high tide mark, such as [[raised beach]]es. In contrast, a submergent coastline is one where the sea level has risen, due to a global sea level change, local [[subsidence]], or [[isostatic rebound]]. Submergent coastlines are identifiable by their submerged, or "drowned" landforms, such as [[ria]]s (drowned valleys) and [[fjord]]s.
{{further information|Emergent coastline|Submergent coastline}}

According to a second principle of classification, a concordant coastline is a coastline where bands of different rock types run parallel to the shore. These rock types are usually of varying [[Geological resistance|resistance]], so the coastline forms distinctive landforms, such as coves. Discordant coastlines feature distinctive landforms because the rocks are [[erosion|eroded]] by ocean [[wave]]s. The less resistant rocks erode faster, creating [[inlet]]s or [[bay]]; the more resistant rocks erode more slowly, remaining as [[headland]]s or [[outcrop]]pings.
{{further information|Concordant coastline|Discordant coastline}}

Other coastal categories:
*A [[cliffed coast]] or abrasion coast is one where marine action has produced steep declivities known as [[cliff]]s.
*A [[flat coast]] is one where the land gradually descends into the sea.
*A [[graded shoreline]] is one where wind and water action has produced a flat and straight coastline.

== Coastal landforms ==
[[File:Accreting coast Image6.svg|thumb|Coastal landforms. The feature shown here as a [[bay]] would, in certain (mainly southern) parts of [[Great Britain|Britain]], be called a [[cove]]. That between the cuspate foreland and the tombolo is a British bay.]]

{{div col end}}

===Cliff erosion===
* Much of the sediment deposited along a coast is the result of erosion of a surrounding [[cliff]], or bluff. [[Sea cliff]]s retreat landward because of the constant undercutting of slopes by waves. If the slope/cliff being undercut is made of unconsolidated sediment it will erode at a much faster rate then a cliff made of bedrock.&lt;ref name=Easterbrook/&gt;
*A [[natural arch]] is formed when a headland is eroded through by waves.
*[[Sea cave]]s are made when certain rock beds are more susceptible to erosion than the surrounding rock beds because of different areas of weakness. These areas are eroded at a faster pace creating a hole or crevice that, through time, by means of wave action and erosion, becomes a cave.
*A [[stack (geology)|stack]] is formed when a headland is eroded away by wave and wind action.
*A [[Stack (geology)|stump]] is a shortened sea stack that has been eroded away or fallen because of instability.
* Wave-cut notches are caused by the undercutting of overhanging slopes which leads to increased stress on cliff material and a greater probability that the slope material will fall. The fallen debris accumulates at the bottom of the cliff and is eventually removed by waves.
*A [[wave-cut platform]] forms after erosion and retreat of a sea cliff has been occurring for a long time. Gently sloping wave-cut platforms develop early on in the first stages of cliff retreat. Later, the length of the platform decreases because the waves lose their energy as they break further off shore.&lt;ref name=Easterbrook/&gt;

==Wildlife==
{{See also|Seashore wildlife|Coastal fish}}
{{Unsourced section|date=April 2018}}
===Animals===
Some of the animals live along a typical coast. There are animals like [[puffin]]s, [[sea turtle]]s and [[rockhopper penguin]]s. [[Gastropoda|Sea snails]] and various kinds of [[barnacle]]s live on the coast and scavenge on food deposited by the sea. Most coastal animals are used to humans in developed areas, such as [[dolphin]]s and [[seagulls]] who eat food thrown for them by tourists. Since the coastal areas are all part of the [[littoral zone]], there is a profusion of marine life found just off-coast.

There are many kinds of [[seabird]]s on the coast. [[Pelican]]s and [[cormorant]]s join up with [[tern]]s and [[oystercatcher]]s to forage for fish and shellfish on the coast. There are sea lions on the coast of Wales and other countries.

===Plants===
Coastal areas are famous for their [[kelp]] beds. Kelp is a fast-growing [[seaweed]] that grows up to a metre a day. [[Coral]]s and [[sea anemone]]s are true animals, but live a lifestyle similar to that of plants. [[Mangroves]], [[seagrass]]es and [[salt marsh]] are important coastal vegetation types in tropical and temperate environments respectively.

==Coastline statistics==

===Coastline problem===
{{main article|Coastline paradox}}

Shortly before 1951, [[Lewis Fry Richardson#Research on the length of coastlines and borders|Lewis Fry Richardson]], in researching the possible effect of border lengths on the probability of war, noticed that the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] reported their measured border with [[Spain]] to be 987&amp;nbsp;km, but the Spanish reported it as 1214&amp;nbsp;km. This was the beginning of the coastline problem, which is a mathematical uncertainty inherent in the measurement of boundaries that are irregular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |contributor-last=Drazin |contributor-first=P. G. |contribution=Fractals |last=Richardson |first=Lewis Fry |pages=45–46 |title=The Collected Papers of Lewis Fry Richardson: Meteorology and numerical analysis |volume=1 |editor1-first=Oliver M. |editor1-last=Ashford |editor2-first= H. |editor2-last=Charnock |editor3-first= P. G. |editor3-last= Drazin |editor4-first= J. C. R. |editor4-last=Hunt |display-editors = 3 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-521-38297-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevailing method of estimating the length of a border (or coastline) was to lay out ''n'' equal straight-line segments of length ''ℓ'' with [[Caliper#Divider caliper|dividers]] on a map or aerial photograph. Each end of the segment must be on the boundary. Investigating the discrepancies in border estimation, Richardson discovered what is now termed the '''Richardson Effect''': the sum of the segments is inversely proportional to the common length of the segments. In effect, the shorter the ruler, the longer the measured border; the Spanish and Portuguese geographers were simply using different-length rulers.

The result most astounding to Richardson is that, under certain circumstances, as ''ℓ'' approaches zero, the length of the coastline approaches [[infinity]]. Richardson had believed, based on Euclidean geometry, that a coastline would approach a fixed length, as do similar estimations of regular geometric figures. For example, the [[perimeter]] of a regular [[polygon]] inscribed in a [[circle]] approaches the [[circumference]] with increasing numbers of sides (and decrease in the length of one side). In [[geometric measure theory]] such a smooth curve as the circle that can be approximated by small straight segments with a definite limit is termed a [[rectifiable curve]].

===Measuring a coastline===
More than a decade after Richardson completed his work, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] developed a new branch of [[mathematics]], [[fractal geometry]], to describe just such non-rectifiable complexes in nature as the infinite coastline.&lt;ref name=MB28&gt;Mandelbrot (1983) page 28.&lt;/ref&gt; His own definition of the new figure serving as the basis for his study is:&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot (1983), page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quote|I coined ''[[fractal]]'' from the [[Latin]] adjective ''fractus''. The corresponding Latin verb ''frangere'' means "to break:" to create irregular fragments. It is therefore sensible ... that, in addition to "fragmented" ... ''fractus'' should also mean "irregular."}}

A key property of the fractal is [[self-similarity]]; that is, at any [[Scale (spatial)|scale]] the same general configuration appears. A coastline is perceived as bays alternating with promontories. In the hypothetical situation that a given coastline has this property of self-similarity, then no matter how greatly any one small section of coastline is magnified, a similar pattern of smaller bays and promontories superimposed on larger bays and promontories appears, right down to the grains of sand. At that scale the coastline appears as a momentarily shifting, potentially infinitely long thread with a [[stochastic]] arrangement of bays and promontories formed from the small objects at hand. In such an environment (as opposed to smooth curves) Mandelbrot asserts&lt;ref name=MB28/&gt; "coastline length turns out to be an elusive notion that slips between the fingers of those who want to grasp it."

There are different kinds of fractals. A coastline with the stated property is in "a first category of fractals, namely curves whose fractal dimension is greater than 1." That last statement represents an extension by Mandelbrot of Richardson's thought. Mandelbrot's statement of the Richardson Effect is:&lt;ref&gt;Mandelbrot (1983), pages 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L(\epsilon)\sim F\epsilon^{1-D}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where L, coastline length, a function of the measurement unit, ε, is approximated by the expression. F is a constant and D is a parameter that Richardson found depended on the coastline approximated by L. He gave no theoretical explanation but Mandelbrot identified D with a non-integer form of the [[Hausdorff dimension]], later the fractal dimension. Rearranging the right side of the expression obtains:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {F} {\epsilon^{D}} \cdot \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

where Fε&lt;sup&gt;−D&lt;/sup&gt; must be the number of units ε required to obtain L. The fractal dimension is the number of the dimensions of the figure being used to approximate the fractal: 0 for a dot, 1 for a line, 2 for a square. D in the expression is between 1 and 2, for coastlines typically less than 1.5. The broken line measuring the coast does not extend in one direction nor does it represent an area, but is intermediate. It can be interpreted as a thick line or band of width 2ε. More broken coastlines have greater D and therefore L is longer for the same ε. Mandelbrot showed that D is independent of ε.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2057">In [[Greek mythology]], '''Combe''' (Ancient Greek: Κόμβη) was a daughter of the river god [[Asopus]]. She was equated with Chalcis, another of Asopus' many daughters, and associated with the island [[Euboea]]: the city [[Chalcis]] was reported to have been named after "Combe, who was also called Chalcis".&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v ''Khalkis''&lt;/ref&gt; Combe was said to have been dubbed Chalcis because she made bronze weapons (χαλκόν ''chalcon'' being the Greek word for "bronze"); the mythological tradition also makes her the first woman to cohabit with a man, and mother of one hundred children.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zenobius]], ''Centuria'', 6. 50, citing Aristus of Salamis and certain unspecified "authors who wrote on Euboea"&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nonnus]]' ''[[Dionysiaca]]'', Combe is the consort of the Euboean [[Socus]] and mother by him of the seven [[Corybantes]]. She and her sons get expelled from the island by Socus and move first to [[Cnossus]] and then to [[Athens, Greece|Athens]]. The Corybantes return to Euboea after King [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], their host in Athens, kills Socus, but Combe's individual further destiny is not dealt with.&lt;ref&gt;Nonnus, ''Dionysiaca'', 13. 135 ff&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hesychius of Alexandria]] indicates Combe as "mother of the Curetes",&lt;ref&gt;Hesychius s. v. ''Kombē''&lt;/ref&gt; these being barely distinct from the Corybantes.

[[Ovid]] briefly mentions a certain Combe of [[Pleuron, Aetolia|Pleuron]], surnamed ''Ophias'' ("daughter or descendant of an Ophius"?), who "on fluttering wings escaped the wounds that were being inflicted by [or on?] her sons",&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''Metamorphoses'', 7. 382 - 383: "...''trepidantibus alis // Ophias effugit natorum vulnera Combe''."&lt;/ref&gt; that is, was apparently changed into a bird to escape a danger. Since the myth is otherwise unknown, it remains uncertain whether this Combe is the same character or a different one.

In [[Hinduism]], '''Diti''' ({{lang-sa|दिति}}) is an [[earth]] [[Mother Nature|goddess]] and mother of the [[Maruts]] with [[Rudra]]. She is also the mother of the [[Daitya]]s with the sage [[Kashyapa]]. She wanted to have a son who would be more powerful than [[Indra]] (who had killed her previous children, who tried to murder Indra and so she practiced [[Magic (paranormal)|black magic]] and kept herself pregnant for one year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/6/18/45/en Srimad Bhagavatam Canto 6 Chapter 18 Verse 45] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728013710/http://srimadbhagavatam.com/6/18/45/en |date=28 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indra used a [[thunder]]bolt to splinter the fetus into many pieces, the [[Maruts]]. She is also [[Aditi]]'s sister. Diti is the daughter of [[Daksha]] — one of the grandfathers of creation, a son of [[Brahma]], the god of ritual skill and a king. Her mother was Panchajani. She is one of the sixty daughters of Daksha. She is one of the thirteen wives of Kashyapa, a ''prajapati'' and a great sage. Her two most famous sons were the rebirths of [[Vishnu]]'s gatekeepers [[Jaya-Vijaya|Jaya and Vijaya]] who failed to keep their dharma. They were [[Hiranyaksha]] who was slain by Vishnu's [[Varaha]] ''[[avatara]]'' and [[Hiranyakashipu]] who was slain by Vishnu's man-lion, [[Narasimha]] ''avatara''. She also had a daughter named [[Holika]] who was killed by her own powers. Diti is usually mean and cruel to Kashyapa and Aditi. She is always obsessed with trying to raise the power of demons to its peak. She also hates Aditi's sons who are the gods. She was instrumental to gain control and autonomy over the Gods (Aditi's children). Diti is assisted by her sister [[Uma (goddess)|Uma]].

==Birth of Diti's children==
Seeing Kashyapa's co-wives being blessed with children, Diti too was eager to have a son, so she asked Kashyapa for company.
Though Kashyapa had acceded to her request, He had asked her to wait for an hour as it was then the time when [[Shiva]] and his retinue of ghosts and spirits moved about, a time which was considered inauspicious and unsuited. However Diti, shaken by the passion of love and lust, couldn't wait and she seized Kashyapa by his garments, which was a sign of immodesty. Since Diti's mind was impure, tainted by lust, she would give birth to two unworthy sons who would violate all the ethics ([[Dharma]]) and follow the path of [[Adharma]]. When Diti felt sorry, Kashyapa consoled her by saying that they would be slain by Lord Vishnu himself and thus be blessed by the Lord's contact in the end. Also, one of her four grandsons by her first son, would be a great devotee of Vishnu and also the noblest man (He is [[Prahlada]]). In this way, Jaya and Vijaya were born on this earth to Diti as [[Hiranyakashipu]] and [[Hiranyaksha]]. In Section 67, ''Adi Parava'' of [[Mahabharata]], it is stated that king [[Shishupala]], the powerful ruler of [[Chedi Kingdom|Chedi]]s, was also an incarnation of Hiranyakasipu, the son of Diti.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Besides great Asura Hiranyakashipu, some other more famous sons of Diti are also mentioned in Adiparava, [[Mahabharata]], as follows:

# '''Sivi''': A great Asura, known among the sons of Diti, became on earth the famous monarch Druma;
# '''Aswa''': That great Asura, son of Diti, known as Aswa (Asva),&lt;ref&gt;same as Aswaka/Asvaka.&lt;/ref&gt; became on earth the [[monarch]] Ashoka of exceeding energy and invincible in battle.&lt;ref&gt;cf: "King Asoka was the incarnation of Asura or demon Asva" (Epic Mythology, 1968, p 62, Edward Washburn Hopkins - Religion).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This epic reference to "Aswa/Asva" seems to allude to Mauriya connections with the [[Asvaka]]/Asva clan, as supposed by Dr H. C. Seth, Dr H. R. Gupta, Kirpal Singh and others. The Asvakas (from Aswa/Asva = horse, horseman) were expert cavalrymen and followed horse-culture. They lived in [[Kunar Province|Kunar]]/[[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]] valleys north of [[Kabul]] river, which was the habitat of [[Kambojas]]. Scholars like B. M. Barua, J. W. McCrindle etc also connect Mauriyas to north-west Punjab i.e. Taxila/Gandhara or Kamboja region. D.B. Spooner also invests Mauriyas with Iranian affinities (See: Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, 1915, (Pt.II), pp 406, 416-17).&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Aswapati''': Younger brother of Aswa and another son of Diti, was born as Hardikya, the king of the [[Malla (India)|Malla]]s;
# '''Sarabha''':  A great Asura and son of Diti, was born on this earth as royal sage [[Paurava]];
# '''Chandra''': The foremost among the sons of Diti and handsome as the lord of the stars himself, became on earth noted as [[Chandravarman|Chandra Varmana Kamvoja]], the king of the Kamvojas  (i.e. [[Kambojas]]).&lt;ref&gt;
Epic Mythology, 1968, p 62, Edward Washburn Hopkins - Religion.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Also see link''': [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mb/m01/m01068.htm].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11558">In [[chemistry]] and [[atomic physics]], the '''electron affinity''' (''E''&lt;sub&gt;ea&lt;/sub&gt;) of an [[atom]] or [[molecule]] is defined as the amount of energy ''released'' or ''spent'' when an electron is added to a neutral atom or molecule in the gaseous state to form a negative ion.&lt;ref name="Compendiumof"&gt;{{GoldBookRef |title=Electron affinity |file=E01977}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::X + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; →  X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + energy
In [[solid state physics]], the electron affinity for a surface is defined somewhat differently (see below).

==Measurement and use of electron affinity==

This  property is measured for atoms and molecules in the gaseous state only, since in a solid or liquid state their [[energy level]]s would be changed by contact with other atoms or molecules. A list of the electron affinities was used by [[Robert S. Mulliken]] to develop an [[electronegativity]] scale for atoms, equal to the average of the electron affinity and [[ionization potential]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Mulliken, [[Journal of Chemical Physics]], '''1934''', ''2'', 782.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Modern Physical Organic Chemistry, Eric V. Anslyn and Dennis A. Dougherty, University Science Books, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-891389-31-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theoretical concepts that use electron affinity include electronic chemical potential and [[chemical hardness]]. Another example, a molecule or atom that has a more positive value of electron affinity than another is often called an [[electron acceptor]] and the less positive an [[electron donor]]. Together they may undergo [[Intervalence charge transfer|charge-transfer]] reactions.

===Sign convention===
To use electron affinities properly, it is essential to keep track of sign. For any reaction that ''releases'' energy, the ''change'' Δ''E'' in [[total energy]] has a negative value and the reaction is called an [[Exothermic reaction|exothermic process]]. Electron capture for almost all non-[[noble gas]] atoms involves the release of energy&lt;ref&gt;Chemical Principles the Quest for Insight, Peter Atkins and Loretta Jones, Freeman, New York, 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-4292-1955-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus are exothermic. The positive values that are listed in tables of ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ea&lt;/sub&gt; are amounts or magnitudes. It is the word, ''released'' within the definition ''energy released'' that supplies the negative sign to Δ''E''. Confusion arises in mistaking ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ea&lt;/sub&gt; for a change in energy, Δ''E'', in which case the positive values listed in tables would be for an endo- not exo-thermic process. The relation between the two is ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ea&lt;/sub&gt; = −Δ''E''(attach).

However, if the value assigned to ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ea&lt;/sub&gt; is negative, the negative sign implies a reversal of direction, and energy is ''required'' to attach an electron. In this case, the electron capture is an [[endothermic]] process and the relationship, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ea&lt;/sub&gt; = −Δ''E''(attach) is still valid. Negative values typically arise for the capture of a second electron, but also for the nitrogen atom.

The usual expression for calculating ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ea&lt;/sub&gt; when an electron is attached is

::{{math|size=120%|1=''E''&lt;sub&gt;ea&lt;/sub&gt; = (''E''&lt;sub&gt;initial&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''E''&lt;sub&gt;final&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;attach&lt;/sub&gt; = −Δ''E''(attach)}}

This expression does follow the convention Δ''X'' = ''X''(final) − ''X''(initial) since −Δ''E'' = −(''E''(final) − ''E''(initial)) = ''E''(initial) − ''E''(final).

Equivalently, electron affinity can also be defined as the amount of energy ''required'' to detach an electron from a [[Electric charge|singly charged]] [[ion|negative ion]],&lt;ref name="Compendiumof" /&gt; i.e. the energy change for the process

::X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → X + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

If the same table is employed for the forward and reverse reactions, ''without switching signs'', care must be taken to apply the correct definition to the corresponding direction, attachment (release) or detachment (require). Since almost all detachments ''(require +)'' an amount of energy listed on the table, those detachment reactions are endothermic, or Δ''E''(detach) &gt; 0.

::{{bigmath|''E''&lt;sub&gt;ea&lt;/sub&gt; = (''E''&lt;sub&gt;final&lt;/sub&gt; − ''E''&lt;sub&gt;initial&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;detach&lt;/sub&gt; = Δ''E''(detach) = −Δ''E''(attach)}}.

==Electron affinities of the elements==
[[File:Electron affinity of the elements.svg|thumb|right|200px|Electron affinity (E&lt;sub&gt;ea&lt;/sub&gt;) vs atomic number (Z)]]
{{Main|Electron affinity (data page)}}
Although ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ea&lt;/sub&gt; varies greatly across the periodic table, some patterns emerge. Generally, [[nonmetals]] have more positive ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ea&lt;/sub&gt; than [[metal]]s. Atoms whose anions are more stable than neutral atoms have a greater ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ea&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Chlorine]] most strongly attracts extra electrons; [[mercury (element)|mercury]] most weakly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been conclusively measured, so they may or may not have slightly negative values.

''E''&lt;sub&gt;ea&lt;/sub&gt; generally increases across a period (row) in the periodic table prior to reaching group 18. This is caused by the filling of the valence shell of the atom; a [[halogen|group 17]] atom releases more energy than a [[Group 1 element|group 1]] atom on gaining an electron because it obtains a filled [[electron shell|valence shell]] and therefore is more stable. In group 18, the valence shell is full, meaning that added electrons are unstable, tending to be ejected very quickly.

Counterintuitively,  ''E''&lt;sub&gt;ea&lt;/sub&gt; does ''not'' decrease when progressing down the rows of the periodic table, as can be clearly seen in the [[Group 2 element|group 2]] data. Thus, electron affinity follows the same "left-right" trend as electronegativity, but not the "up-down" trend.

The following data are quoted in [[Joule per mole|kJ/mol]].

&lt;center&gt;{{periodic table (electron affinities)}}&lt;/center&gt;

==Molecular electron affinities==
The electron affinity of molecules is a complicated function of their electronic structure.
For instance the electron affinity for [[benzene]] is negative, as is that of [[naphthalene]], while those of [[anthracene]], [[phenanthrene]] and [[pyrene]] are positive. ''[[In silico]]'' experiments show that the electron affinity of [[hexacyanobenzene]] surpasses that of [[fullerene]].&lt;ref&gt;''Remarkable electron accepting properties of the simplest benzenoid cyanocarbons: hexacyanobenzene, octacyanonaphthalene and decacyanoanthracene'' Xiuhui Zhang, Qianshu Li, Justin B. Ingels, Andrew C. Simmonett, Steven E. Wheeler, Yaoming Xie, R. Bruce King, Henry F. Schaefer III and [[F. Albert Cotton]] [[Chemical Communications]], '''2006''', 758–760 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1039/b515843e Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Electron affinity" as defined in solid state physics==

[[File:Semiconductor vacuum junction.svg|thumb|[[Band diagram]] of semiconductor-vacuum interface showing electron affinity ''E''&lt;sub&gt;EA&lt;/sub&gt;, defined as the difference between near-surface vacuum energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;vac&lt;/sub&gt;, and near-surface [[conduction band]] edge ''E''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. Also shown: [[Fermi level]] ''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;, [[valence band]] edge ''E''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, [[work function]] ''W''.]]

In the field of [[solid state physics]], the electron affinity is defined differently than in chemistry and atomic physics. For a semiconductor-vacuum interface (that is, the surface of a semiconductor), electron affinity, typically denoted by ''E''&lt;sub&gt;EA&lt;/sub&gt; or ''χ'', is defined as the energy obtained by moving an electron from the vacuum just outside the semiconductor to the bottom of the [[conduction band]] just inside the semiconductor:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Raymond T. |last =  Tung | url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/physics/tung/Schottky/surface.htm|title=Free Surfaces of Semiconductors|work= Brooklyn College}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E_{\rm EA} \equiv E_{\rm vac} - E_{\rm C}&lt;/math&gt;
In an intrinsic semiconductor at [[absolute zero]], this concept is functionally analogous to the chemistry definition of electron affinity, since an added electron will spontaneously go to the bottom of the conduction band. At nonzero temperature, and for other materials (metals, semimetals, heavily doped semiconductors), the analogy does not hold since an added electron will instead go to the [[Fermi level]] on average. In any case, the value of the electron affinity of a solid substance is very different from the chemistry and atomic physics electron affinity value for an atom of the same substance in gas phase. For example, a silicon crystal surface has electron affinity 4.05&amp;nbsp;eV, whereas an isolated silicon atom has electron affinity 1.39&amp;nbsp;eV.

The electron affinity of a surface is closely related to, but distinct from, its [[work function]]. The work function is the [[thermodynamic work]] that can be obtained by reversibly, isothermally moving an electron from the vacuum to the material; this thermodynamic electron goes to the ''[[Fermi level]]'' on average, not the conduction band edge: &lt;math&gt; W = E_{\rm vac} - E_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt;. While the [[work function]] of a semiconductor can be changed by [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]], the electron affinity ideally does not change with doping and so it is closer to being a material constant. However, like work function the electron affinity does depend on the surface termination (crystal face, surface chemistry, etc.) and is strictly a surface property.

In semiconductor physics, the primary use of the electron affinity is not actually in the analysis of semiconductor–vacuum surfaces, but rather in heuristic [[electron affinity rule]]s for estimating the [[band bending]] that occurs at the interface of two materials, in particular [[metal–semiconductor junction]]s and semiconductor [[heterojunction]]s.

In certain circumstances, the electron affinity may become negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Himpsel | first1 = F. | last2 = Knapp | first2 = J. | last3 = Vanvechten | first3 = J. | last4 = Eastman | first4 = D. | title = Quantum photoyield of diamond(111)—A stable negative-affinity emitter | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.20.624 | journal = Physical Review B | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 624 | year = 1979 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1979PhRvB..20..624H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often negative electron affinity is desired to obtain efficient [[cathode]]s that can supply electrons to the vacuum with little energy loss. The observed electron yield as a function of various parameters such as bias voltage or illumination conditions can be used to describe these structures with [[band diagram]]s in which the electron affinity is one parameter. For one illustration of the apparent effect of surface termination on electron emission, see Figure 3 in [[Marchywka Effect]].

The '''''Solar System Family Portrait''''' is an image of many of the [[Solar System]]'s planets and moons acquired by ''[[MESSENGER]]'' during November 2010 from approximately the orbit of Mercury.  The [[mosaic]] is intended to be complementary to the [[Family Portrait (Voyager)|''Voyager 1''{{'}}s ''Family Portrait'']] acquired from the outer edge of the Solar System on February 14, 1990.

The portrait was constructed using 34 individual frames acquired using the Mercury Dual Imaging System, targeting areas surrounding each planet.  The first series of images were acquired on November 3, 2010, and the second on November 16.

[[Image:MESSENGER Solar System Family Portrait.jpg|center|800px|[[MESSENGER]]'s ''Family Portrait'']]
{{center|&lt;small&gt;See [[:File:Family portrait wac.png|full resolution]] image&lt;/small&gt;}}

Six [[planets]] are visible in the mosaic. From left to right: [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Jupiter]], [[Mars]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], and [[Saturn]]. [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]] were too small to resolve at this distance (3.0-billion and 4.4-billion kilometers respectively). Careful effort was taken to avoid facing the camera toward the Solar System's central star, the [[Sun]], due to the intense heat at close distance.

[[File:MESSENGER - Jupiter labeled v2bicubic.png|thumb|right|150px|alt=Image of four visible Galilean moons, acquired using the Narrow-Angle Camera on the Mercury Dual Imaging System|All four Galliean moons are visible in this Narrow-Angle Camera image.]]
Several moons are visible in the photo, including the Earth's [[Moon]], and all four [[Galilean moons]]: [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and [[Io (moon)|Io]].  Additionally, part of the [[Milky Way]] is visible between Neptune and Mars.

Because ''MESSENGER'' does not follow the same orbital plane as the Earth, the cameras on the spacecraft had to point up and down from the [[ecliptic]] to capture all of the planets.  This resulted in a curved mosaic.

'''''Ficus benghalensis''''', commonly known as the '''banyan''', '''banyan fig''' and '''Indian banyan''',&lt;ref name=GRIN&gt;{{GRIN | name = ''Ficus benghalensis'' L. | id = 16783 | accessdate = 8 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a tree native to the [[Indian Subcontinent]]. Specimens in India are among the largest trees in the world by canopy coverage.

==Ecology==
[[file:Denkschriften der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften - Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftliche Classe (1858) (20665373299), Ficus benghalensis.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Nature printing|Nature printed]] leaves, showing shape and venation]] 
''Ficus benghalensis'' produces propagating roots which grow downwards as [[aerial root]]s. Once these roots reach the ground they grow into woody trunks.

The figs produced by the tree are eaten by birds such as the [[Indian myna]]. Fig seeds that pass through the digestive system of birds are more likely to germinate and sprout earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Midya, S.; Brahmachary, R. L. (1991) "The Effect of Birds Upon Germination of Banyan (''Ficus bengalensis'') Seeds". ''Journal of Tropical Ecology''. 7(4):537-538.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
''Ficus benghalensis'' is the [[national tree]] of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Tree |url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/national_tree.php |date= |publisher=[[Govt. of India]] Official website |page= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100418030826/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/national_tree.php |archivedate=2010-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tree is considered sacred in India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Plants of Life, Plants of Death |author=Simoons, F.J. |isbn=9780299159047 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KEUAbrBoeBAC |year=1998|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and temples are often built beneath. Due to the large size of the tree's canopy it provides useful shade in hot climates.

In [[Theravada Buddhism]], this tree is said to have been used as the tree for achieved enlightenment, or Bodhi by the twenty fourth [[Buddha]] called "Kassapa - කස්සප". The sacred plant is known as "Nuga - නුග" or "Maha nuga - මහ නුග"  in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.instituteofayurveda.org/plants/plants_detail.php?i=858&amp;s=Family_name&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2017}}

== Notable specimens ==
: ''See ''[[List of Banyan trees in India]]'' for a more complete list''
The giant banyans of [[India]] are the largest trees in the world by area of canopy coverage.  Multiple individual trees have achieved notoriety:
* [[Thimmamma Marrimanu]]
* [[Kabirvad]]
* [[The Great Banyan]]

The largest, known specimen of tree in the world in terms of the two dimensional area covered by its canopy is [[Thimmamma Marrimanu]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]], which covers {{convert|19107|sqm|acre|abbr=on}}. This tree is also the largest, known specimen of tree in the world in terms of the length of its perimeter, which measures {{convert|846|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Bar-Ness&gt;{{cite web | last = Bar-Ness | first = YD | title = The World's Largest Trees?

[[Nearchus]], an admiral of [[Alexander the Great]], described a large specimen on the banks of the [[Narmada River]] in contemporary [[Bharuch]], [[Gujarat]], [[India]]; he may have described the specimen presently named "[[Kabirvad]]". The canopy of the specimen which [[Nearchus]] described was so extensive that it sheltered 7,000 men. James Forbes later described it in his ''Oriental Memoirs'' (1813-5) as almost {{convert|2000|ft|abbr=on|order=flip}} in circumference and having more than 3,000 trunks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Fig}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the area of its canopy is {{convert|17520|sqm|acre|abbr=on}} with a perimeter of {{convert|641|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Bar-Ness/&gt;

Other notable [[India]]n specimens include [[The Great Banyan]] in the [[Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden|Jagadish Chandra Bose Botanic Garden]] in [[Shibpur]], [[Howrah]], which has a canopy area of {{convert|18918|sqm|acre|abbr=on}} and is about 250 years old, and [[Dodda Aladha Mara]] in Kettohalli, [[Karnataka]], which has a canopy area of {{convert|12000|sqm|acre|abbr=on}} and is about 400 years old.

A classic foreline is a [[hose]] or [[Pneumatic tube|tube]] that connects a [[rotary vane pump]] to the [[wikt:outlet|outlet]] of an [[oil diffusion pump]], although vacuum [[technology]] now uses a vast array of [[roughing pump]]s and high [[vacuum pump]]s.

Although the term has been used for many [[decade]]s in the high vacuum system [[industry]] and in [[literature]] concerning vacuum systems, the word foreline has not yet been added to any [[dictionary]].

[[File:Douglas DC-8 producing contrails at a biofuel test.jpg|thumb|Fuel burning in the engines produces water vapor which condenses in [[contrails]] behind a [[Douglas DC-8]].]]

[[Fuel efficiency|Fuel economy]] in aircraft is a measure of how much fuel an aircraft, or a fleet of aircraft of mixed types, needs to operate in relation to a service provided (i.e. number of passengers or ton of freight) and the distance between points of travel. It can be expressed in several ways, for example by the litres of fuel consumed per passenger per kilometer.

== Flight efficiency theory ==
[[File:Forces2.gif|thumb|Forces on an aircraft|alt=Diagram showing the balance of forces on an aircraft]]

A [[powered aircraft]] counters its [[weight]] through [[aerodynamic lift]] and counters its [[aerodynamic drag]] with [[thrust]]. The aircraft's maximum [[range (aeronautics)|range]] is determined by the level of efficiency with which [[thrust]] can be applied to overcome the [[aerodynamic drag]].

=== Aerodynamics ===
[[File:Drag curves for aircraft in flight.svg|thumb|Drag forces by velocity|alt=graph of drag forces]]

A subfield of [[fluid dynamics]], [[aerodynamics]] studies the physics of a body moving through the air. As [[lift (force)|lift]] and [[drag (physics)|drag]] are functions of air speed, their relationships are major determinants of an aircraft's design efficiency.

Aircraft efficiency is augmented by maximizing [[lift-to-drag ratio]], which is attained by minimizing [[parasitic drag]] and lift-generated [[induced drag]], the two components of aerodynamic drag. As parasitic drag increases and induced drag decreases with speed, there is an optimum speed where the sum of both is minimal; this is the best [[glide ratio]]. For powered aircraft, the optimum glide ratio has to be balanced with thrust efficiency.

Parasitic drag is constituted by [[form drag]] and [[skin friction drag|skin-friction drag]], and grows with the square of the speed in the [[drag equation]]. The form drag is minimized by having the smallest [[frontal area]] and by streamlining the aircraft for a low [[drag coefficient]], while skin friction is proportional to the body's surface area and can be reduced by maximizing [[laminar flow]].

Induced drag can be reduced by decreasing the size of the [[airframe]], fuel and [[payload]] weight, and by increasing the [[wing aspect ratio]] or by using [[wingtip device]]s at the cost of increased structure weight.

==== Design speed ====
By increasing efficiency, a lower cruise-speed augments the range and reduces the [[environmental impact of aviation]]; however, a higher cruise-speed allows more [[revenue passenger mile]]s flown per day.

[[Jet engine]] efficiency increases with velocity because the speed difference between the flight and the exhaust is lower. However, above the [[drag divergence Mach number]], the aerodynamic drag on the airframe overwhelms this effect because supersonic [[shockwave]]s begin to form, greatly increasing drag and needing [[supercritical airfoil]] designs for [[transonic]] flight.

For [[supersonic]] flight, drag increases at Mach&amp;nbsp;1.0 but decreases again after the transition. With a specifically designed aircraft, such as the (in development) [[Aerion AS2]], the Mach&amp;nbsp;1.1 range at 3,700&amp;nbsp;nmi is {{#expr:3700/5300*100round0}}% of the maximum range of 5,300&amp;nbsp;nmi at Mach&amp;nbsp;0.95, but increases to 4,750&amp;nbsp;nmi at Mach&amp;nbsp;1.4 for {{#expr:4750/5300*100round0}}% before falling again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aerionsupersonic.com/speed/ |title= Performance &gt; Speed |publisher= Aerion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Wingtip devices ====
[[Wingtip device]]s increase the effective [[wing aspect ratio|wing-aspect ratio]], lowering [[lift-induced drag]] caused by [[wingtip vortices]] and improving the lift-to-drag ratio without increasing the wingspan. (Wingspan is limited by the available width in the [[ICAO#Aerodrome Reference Code|ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code]].) [[Airbus]] installed wingtip fences on its planes since the [[Airbus A310|A310-300]] in 1985, and Sharklet blended-winglets for the [[A320]] were launched during the November 2009 [[Dubai air show]]. Their installation adds {{Convert|200|kg|lb}} but offers a 3.5% fuel burn reduction on flights over {{convert|2,800|km|nmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/dubai-09-a320s-sharklets-to-deliver-35-lower-fuel-burn-from-2012-334945/ |title=Dubai 09: A320s sharklets to deliver 3.5% lower fuel burn from 2012 |author= Max Kingsley-Jones |date= 15 November 2009 |work= Flight International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weight ===
[[File:Takeoff weight diagram.svg|thumb|Aircraft weight at takeoff|alt=bar chart of aircraft weight]]

As the weight indirectly generates lift-induced drag, its minimization leads to better aircraft efficiency. For a given payload, a lighter [[airframe]] generates a lower drag. Minimizing weight can be achieved through the airframe's configuration, [[materials science]] and construction methods. To obtain a longer range, a larger [[fuel fraction]] of the [[maximum takeoff weight]] is needed, adversely affecting efficiency.

The deadweight of the airframe and fuel is non-payload that must be lifted to altitude and kept aloft, contributing to fuel consumption. A reduction in airframe weight enables the use of smaller, lighter engines. The weight savings in both allow for a lighter fuel load for a given range and payload. A rule-of-thumb is that a reduction in fuel consumption of about 0.75% results from each 1% reduction in weight.&lt;ref name=Capehart&gt;{{cite book |author=Barney L. Capehart |year=2007 |title=Encyclopedia of Energy Engineering and Technology |volume=1 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0-8493-3653-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 84-ton maximum payload of a modern [[Airbus A380]] represents {{#expr:84/575*100round1}}% of its 575-ton maximum take-off weight. There remains considerable room for future improvements in weight reduction. The weight of an aircraft can be reduced by using light-weight materials such as [[titanium]], [[carbon fiber]] and other composite plastics. Expensive materials may be used if the reduction of mass justifies the price of materials through improved fuel efficiency over the aircraft's lifetime. Any improvements in fuel efficiency reduce the amount of fuel an aircraft must carry, which reduces the take-off weight of the aircraft and provides further gains in fuel efficiency. For example, the Airbus A380 design includes multiple light-weight materials. The [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]] was the first major commercial airplane to have a composite fuselage, composite wings, and use composites in most other airframe components.&lt;ref name=Composites_flying_prt1&gt;{{cite web |author= Marsh, George |url=http://www.materialstoday.com/composite-applications/features/composites-flying-high-part-1/ |title=Composites flying high (Part 1) |publisher= Materials Today |date= 8 April 2014 |access-date= 23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Flight distance ====
For [[Flight length#long haul|long-haul flights]], the airplane needs to carry additional fuel, leading to higher fuel consumption. Above a certain distance it becomes more fuel-efficient to make a halfway stop to refuel despite the energy losses in [[descent (aircraft)|descent]] and [[climb (aeronautics)|climb]]. For example, a [[Boeing 777]]-300 reaches the tipping point at {{convert|3000|nmi|km}}. It is more fuel-efficient to make a [[non-stop flight]] below this distance and to make a stop when covering a longer total distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Advanced Aircraft Flight Performance |author= Antonio Filippone |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |page= 454 |date= 2012 |isbn= 9781139789660 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=6gnO9XoeT5cC&amp;lpg=PA454&amp;vq=fuel%20stop%20enroute&amp;dq=Antonio%20Filippone%20fuel%2Fpax&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PA454#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:777-224 fuel burn-range.png|thumb|upright=2.5|center|[[Boeing 777]]-224 fuel burn per distance against range]]

Very long non-stop passenger flights suffer from the weight penalty of the extra fuel required, which means limiting the number of available seats to compensate. For such flights, the critical fiscal factor is the quantity of fuel burnt per seat-nautical mile.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Morton_Okelly/publication/266007692_Fuel_burn_rates_of_commercial_passenger_aircraft_variations_by_seat_configuration_and_stage_distance Park Y., O'Kelly M.E. (2014)]. Fuel burn rates of commercial passenger aircraft: variations by seat configuration and stage distance. Jrnl. Transp. Geog., 41:pp.137-147.&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons the world's longest commercial flights were cancelled {{circa|2013}}. An example is Singapore Airlines' former New York to Singapore flight, which could carry only 100 passengers (all business class) on the {{convert|10,300|mi|km|adj=on}} flight. According to an industry analyst, "It [was] pretty much a fuel tanker in the air."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2013-10-31/fuel-costs-lead-singapore-air-to-end-worlds-longest-nonstop-flights Why the Longest Nonstop Flights Are Ending], Bloomberg Bus., 31 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 2000s/early 2010s, rising fuel prices coupled with the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|Great Recession]] caused the cancellation of many ultra-long haul, non-stop flights. This included the services provided by Singapore Airlines from Singapore to both Newark and Los Angeles that was ended in late 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Andrew Doyle | title=SIA to drop nonstop USA flights as Airbus buys back A340s | url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/sia-to-drop-nonstop-usa-flights-as-airbus-buys-back-a340s-378006/ | website=flightglobal.com | date=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/business/last-call-for-the-long-haul-from-singapore-to-newark.html?_r=0 | title=Last Call for the Long Haul From Singapore to Newark | author=Mike Tierney | publisher=The New York Times | date=25 November 2013 | accessdate=1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as fuel prices have since decreased and more fuel efficient aircraft have come into service, many ultra-long haul routes have been reinstated or newly scheduled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.ft.com/content/689a1618-814d-11e5-8095-ed1a37d1e096 | author1=Tanya Powley | author2=Peggy Bollinger | title=A new era of 'ultra-long-haul' aviation | publisher=Financial Times | date=6 November 2015 | accessdate=22 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Longest flights]]).

=== Propulsive efficiency ===
[[File:Gas turbine efficiency.png|thumb|Propulsive efficiency comparison for various gas-turbine engine configurations]]

To get thrust, an [[aircraft engine]] is either a shaft engine&amp;nbsp;– [[piston engine]] or [[turboprop]], with its efficiency measured by its [[brake specific fuel consumption|brake-specific fuel consumption]]&amp;nbsp;– coupled with a [[propeller]] having its own [[propulsive efficiency]]; or a [[jet engine]] with its efficiency measured by its [[thrust specific fuel consumption|thrust-specific fuel consumption]].

Turboprops have an optimum speed below {{convert|460|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Spakovszky |first= Zoltan |title= Unified Propulsion Lecture 1 |work= Unified Engineering Lecture Notes |publisher= MIT |year= 2009 |url= http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/SPRING/propulsion/UnifiedPropulsion3/UnifiedPropulsion3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is less than jets used by major airlines today, but there is reduced drag at the lower speed.

[[Jet fuel]] cost and emissions reduction have renewed interest in the [[propfan]] concept for jetliners with an emphasis on engine/airframe efficiency that might come into service beyond the [[Boeing 787]] and [[Airbus A350]]XWB. For instance, Airbus has patented aircraft designs with twin rear-mounted counter-rotating propfans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent |country= US |number= 2009020643 |status= application |title= Aircraft having reduced environmental impact |pubdate= 22 January 2009 |inventor= Airbus |invent1= Pierre-Emmanuel Gall |invent2= Christophe Cros |class= B64D27/00}}&lt;/ref&gt; Propfans are a more fuel-efficient technology than jet engines or turboprops. NASA has conducted an Advanced Turboprop Project (ATP), where they researched a variable-pitch propfan that produced less noise and achieved high speeds.

=== Speed ===
At constant propulsive efficiency, the maximum [[Range (aeronautics)|range]] speed is when the ratio between velocity and drag is minimal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/getting-most-miles-your-jet |title= Getting the Most Miles from Your Jet-A |date= 27 February 2016 |author= James Albright |work= Business &amp; Commercial Aviation |publisher= Aviation Week }}&lt;/ref&gt; while maximum [[Endurance (aeronautics)|endurance]] is attained at the best lift-to-drag ratio.

=== Altitude ===
Air density decreases with altitude, thus lowering drag, assuming the aircraft maintains a constant [[equivalent airspeed]]. This means an aircraft may be more efficient at higher altitude. With increasing altitude, air pressure and temperature both decrease, causing the maximum power or thrust of [[aircraft engine]]s to reduce. In a [[piston engine]], this trend towards decline in maximum power can be mitigated by installation of a [[turbocharger]]. Decreasing air temperature with altitude increases [[thermal efficiency]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

=== Airlines ===
[[File:Norwegian Long Haul B787-8 LN-LND (29784411145).jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 787]] from [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]]]]

Fuel economy in [[air transport]] comes from aircraft fuel efficiency combined with [[airline]] efficiency: [[aircraft seat map|seating configuration]], [[passenger load factor]] and [[air cargo]]. For instance, over the [[transatlantic flight|transatlantic]] route, the most-active intercontinental market, the average fuel consumption in 2017 was 34 pax-km per L ({{cvt|{{#expr:100/34round2}}|L/100km|mpgus|disp=sqbr}} per passenger). The most fuel-efficient airline was [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] with 44 pax-km/L ({{cvt|{{#expr:100/44round2}}|L/100km|mpgus|disp=sqbr}} per passenger), thanks to its fuel-efficient [[Boeing 787]]-8, a high 85% passenger load factor and a high density of 1.36 seat/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; due to a low 9% premium seating. On the other side, the least efficient was [[British Airways]] at 27 pax-km/L ({{cvt|{{#expr:100/27round2}}|L/100km|mpgus|disp=sqbr}} per passenger), using fuel-inefficient [[Boeing 747-400]]s with a low density of 0.75 seat/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; due to a high 25% premium seating, in spite of a high 82% load factor.&lt;ref name=ICCT12sep2012&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/Transatlantic_Fuel_Efficiency_Ranking_20180912.pdf |title= Transatlantic airline fuel efficiency ranking, 2017 |authors= Brandon Graver and Daniel Rutherford |date= 12 September 2018 |publisher= ICCT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, over the trans[[pacific]] routes, the average fuel consumption was 31 pax-km per L ({{cvt|{{#expr:100/31round2}}|L/100km|mpgus|disp=sqbr}} per passenger). The most fuel-efficient were [[Hainan Airlines]] and [[All Nippon Airways|ANA]] with 36 pax-km/L ({{cvt|{{#expr:100/36round2}}|L/100km|mpgus|disp=sqbr}} per passenger) while [[Qantas]] was the least efficient at 22 pax-km/L ({{cvt|{{#expr:100/22round2}}|L/100km|mpgus|disp=sqbr}} per passenger).&lt;!--&lt;ref name=ICCTjan2018/&gt;--&gt;
Key drivers for efficiency were the [[air freight]] share for 48%, seating density for 24%, aircraft fuel burn for 16% and passenger load factor for 12%.&lt;ref name=ICCTjan2018&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theicct.org/sites/default/files/publications/Transpacific-airline-fuel-efficiency-ranking-2016_ICCT-white-paper_16012018_vF.pdf |title= Transpacific airline fuel efficiency ranking, 2016 |author= Brandon Graver and Daniel Rutherford |date= Jan 2018 |publisher= ICCT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MSCI]] ranked [[Ryanair]] as the lowest-emissions-intensity airline in its ACWI index with 75&amp;nbsp;g {{CO2}}-e/[[revenue passenger kilometre]] in 2014&amp;nbsp;– below [[Easyjet]] at 82&amp;nbsp;g, the average at 123&amp;nbsp;g and [[Lufthansa]] at 132&amp;nbsp;g&amp;nbsp;– by using high-density 189-seat [[Boeing 737-800]]s. In 2015 Ryanair emitted 8.64&amp;nbsp;Bn&amp;nbsp;t of {{CO2}} for 545,034 sectors flown: {{#expr:8638838/545034round2}}&amp;nbsp;t per {{cvt|776|miles|nmi km}} average sector (or {{#expr:8638838/545034*14/44round2}}&amp;nbsp;t of fuel: {{#expr:8638838/545034*14/44/1.249round2}}&amp;nbsp;kg/km) representing {{#expr:8638838/90555.521round0}}&amp;nbsp;kg per 90.6&amp;nbsp;million passengers ({{#expr:8638838/90555.521*14/44round1}}&amp;nbsp;kg of fuel: {{#expr:8638838/90555.521*14/44/12.49/0.8round2}}&amp;nbsp;L/100&amp;nbsp;km or {{#expr:8638838/90555.521/1.249round0}}&amp;nbsp;g&amp;nbsp;{{CO2}}/km).&lt;!-- assumptions : combustion molecular mass : CH2 (14) =&gt; C02 (44) ; fuel density : 0.8 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://investor.ryanair.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Ryanair-Annual-Report-FY16.pdf |publisher= Ryanair |title= Annual Report |date= July 2016 |page= 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's turboprop airliners have better fuel-efficiency than current jet airliners, in part because of their lower cruising speed and [[Propeller (aeronautics)|propellers]] that are more efficient than those of the 1950s-era piston-powered airlines.&lt;ref name="ICCT-Kwan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theicct.org/blogs/staff/back-future-return-turboprop |title=Back to the Future: Return of the Turboprop? |author=Irene Kwan |publisher=The International Council on Clean Transport |date= 3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jet aircraft efficiency is improving: between 1960 and 2000 there was a 55% overall fuel-efficiency gain (as compared to the [[Boeing 707]]).&lt;ref name="Peeters-2005"/&gt; Most of the improvements in efficiency were gained in the first decade when jet craft first came into widespread commercial use. Between 1971 and 1998 the fleet-average annual improvement per available seat-kilometre was estimated at 2.4%. Nonetheless, from the 1960s to the present, total fleet emissions of the greenhouse gas {{CO2}} have outpaced efficiency gains, due to growth in the air-travel market.&lt;ref&gt;Peeters, Kutzner &amp; Cohen (2016).

[[Concorde]], a [[supersonic transport]], managed about 17 passenger-miles to the Imperial gallon, which is 16.7 L/100&amp;nbsp;km per passenger; similar to a business jet, but much worse than a subsonic turbofan aircraft. [[Airbus]] states a fuel rate consumption of their [[Airbus A380|A380]] at less than 3 L/100&amp;nbsp;km per passenger (78 passenger-miles per US gallon);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The A380: The future of flying |publisher=Airbus |url=http://www.airbus.com/en/myairbus/airbusview/the_a380_the_future_of_flying.html |accessdate=22 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214144443/http://www.airbus.com/en/myairbus/airbusview/the_a380_the_future_of_flying.html |archivedate=14 December 2007 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; however this is for an unspecified number and configuration of seats. The maximum configuration is 850 economy passengers, but with a typical 525-seat multi-class configuration the fuel consumption is "comparable to that of a B747-400ER and even about 15% worse than a B777-300ER on a passenger-mile basis."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theicct.org/blogs/staff/inflight-luxury-who-really-pays Inflight Luxury: Who Really Pays?], Irene Kwan, ICCT. 30 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

*10–20% by flying without landing gear in 2032

Today's tube-and-wing configuration could remain in use until the 2030s due to drag reductions from active [[Aeroelastic flutter|flutter]] suppression for slender flexible-wings and natural and hybrid [[laminar flow]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt;
Large, ultra [[high bypass]] engines will need upswept [[gull wing]]s or overwing [[nacelle]]s as [[Pratt &amp; Whitney]]  continue to develop its [[geared turbofan]] to save a projected 10–15% of fuel costs by the mid-2020s.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt;
NASA indicates this configuration could gain up to 45% with advanced aerodynamics, structures and geared turbofans, but longer term suggests savings of up to 50% by 2025 and 60% by 2030 with new ultra-efficient configurations and propulsion architectures: [[hybrid wing body]], truss-braced wing, [[lifting body]] designs, embedded engines, and [[boundary-layer ingestion]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;--&gt;
By 2030 hybrid-electric architectures may be ready for 100 seaters and [[distributed propulsion]] with tighter integration of airframe may enable further efficiency and emissions improvements.&lt;ref name=AvWeek6may2016&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/technology-milestones/problems-aerospace-still-has-solve |title= Problems Aerospace Still Has To Solve |date= 6 May 2016 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research projects such as Boeing's [[ecoDemonstrator]] program have sought to identify ways of improving the fuel economy of commercial aircraft operations.

* the [[Airbus]]/[[Rolls-Royce Holdings|Rolls-Royce]] E-Thrust is an [[Hybrid electric vehicle#Aircraft|hybrid electric]] with a [[gas turbine]] engine and electric [[ducted fan]]s with [[energy storage]] allowing peak power for takeoff and climb while for the descent the engine is shut down and the fans recover energy to recharge the batteries;
* [[Empirical Systems Aerospace]] (ESAero) is developing the 150-seat ECO-150 concept for turboelectric distributed propulsion with two [[turboshaft]] engines mounted on the wing and driving generators powering ducted fans embedded in the inboard wing sections, effectively increasing the [[bypass ratio]] and [[propulsive efficiency]] for 20–30% fuel savings over the [[Boeing 737 NG]], while providing some [[powered lift]];
* NASA's [[single-aisle]] turbo-electric aircraft with an aft boundary layer propulsor (STARC-ABL) is a conventional tube-and-wing 737-sized [[airliner]] with an aft-mounted electric fan ingesting the fuselage [[boundary layer]] hybrid-electric propulsion, with 5.4&amp;nbsp;MW of power distributed to three electric motors: the design will be evaluated by [[Aurora Flight Sciences]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/aurora-flight-sciences-to-evaluate-nasa-electric-air-442471/ |title= Aurora Flight Sciences to evaluate NASA electric airliner design |date= 24 October 2017 |author= Stephen Trimble |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Boeing [[blended wing body]] (BWB) with a wide fuselage mated to high-[[Aspect ratio (aeronautics)|aspect-ratio]] wings is more aerodynamically efficient because the entire aircraft contributes to the [[Lift (force)|lift]] and it has less [[surface area]], producing less drag and offering weight savings due to lower [[wing loading]], while [[aircraft noise|noise]] is shielded by locating the engines on the aft upper surface;
* Developed with the [[U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory]] and refined with NASA, the [[Lockheed Martin]] Hybrid Wing Body (HWB) combines a blended forward fuselage and wing with a conventional aft fuselage and [[T-tail]] for compatibility with existing infrastructure and [[airdrop]]; the engines in [[Podded engine#Overwing podded engines|overwing nacelle]]s on struts over the [[trailing edge]] enable higher-bypass-ratio engines with 5% less drag, provide acoustic shielding and increases lift without a thrust or drag penalty at low speed;
* Airbus-backed German [[Bauhaus-Luftfahrt]] designed the Propulsive Fuselage concept, reducing drag with a fan in the tail ingesting air flowing over the fuselage via an annular (ring-shaped) inlet and re-energizes the wake, driven with a [[gearbox]] or as a turbo-electric configuration;
* Conceived by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] for NASA, [[Aurora Flight Sciences]] developed the "double-bubble" D8, a 180-seat aircraft with a wide lifting fuselage, [[twin-aisle]] cabin to replace A320 and B737 narrowbodies, and boundary-layer ingestion with engines in the tail driving distortion-tolerant fans for a 49% fuel-burn reduction over the B737NG;
* The Boeing truss-[[braced wing]] (TBW) concept was developed for the NASA-funded [[Subsonic Ultra Green Aircraft Research]] program with an aspect ratio of 19.5 compared to 11 for the [[Boeing 787]]: the strut relieves some bending moment and a braced wing can be lighter than a cantilevered wing or longer for the same weight, having better lift-to-drag ratio by lowering the induced drag and thinner, facilitating natural [[laminar flow]] and reducing [[wave drag]] at [[transonic]] speeds;
* [[Dzyne Technologies]] reduces the thickness of the blended wing body for a 110–130-seat super-regional, a configuration usually too thick for a narrowbody replacement and better suited for large aircraft, by placing the landing gear outward and storing baggage in the wing roots, enabling 20% fuel savings;
* the French research agency [[ONERA]] designed two concepts for a 180-seat airliner Versitalie Aircraft (NOVA) including turbofans with higher bypass ratios and fan diameter: a [[gull wing]] with increased [[Dihedral (aeronautics)|dihedral]] inboard to accommodate larger geared turbofans under without lengthening the gear and the other with engines embedded in the tail to ingest the low-energy fuselage boundary layer flow and re-energize the wake to reduce drag;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ludovic_Wiart/publication/279512039_Development_of_NOVA_Aircraft_Configurations_for_Large_Engine_Integration_Studies/links/5593d92f08ae16f493ef3c81/Development-of-NOVA-Aircraft-Configurations-for-Large-Engine-Integration-Studies.pdf |title= Development of NOVA Aircraft Configurations for Large Engine Integration Studies |date= July 2015 |doi= 10.2514/6.2015-2254 |conference= [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|AIAA]] Aviation 2015, Dallas, TX |author= Ludovic Wiart et al. |publisher= [[ONERA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* with [[Cranfield University]], Rolls-Royce developed the Distributed Open Rotor (DORA) with high-aspect-ratio wing and V-tail to minimize drag, and turbogenerators on the wing driving electric propellers along the inboard leading edge with [[open rotor]] high-[[propulsive efficiency]] and increasing the effective bypass ratio.

== Climate change ==
{{Main|Environmental impact of aviation}}

The growth of air travel outpaces its fuel-economy improvements and corresponding {{CO2}} emissions, compromising climate [[sustainability]]. Although [[low-cost carrier|low-cost carriers']] higher seat-density increases fuel economy and lowers [[greenhouse gas]] emissions per-[[passenger-kilometer]], the lower airfares cause a [[Rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]] of more flights and larger overall emissions. The [[Tourism|tourism industry]] could shift emphasis to emissions eco-efficiency in {{CO2}} per unit of [[revenue]] or [[Profit (economics)|profit]] instead of fuel economy, favoring shorter trips and ground transportation over flying long journeys to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | type= PhD | author= Paul Peeters |date= 15 November 2017 |url= https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid:615ac06e-d389-4c6c-810e-7a4ab5818e8d/datastream/OBJ/download |title= Tourism's impact on climate change and its mitigation challenges: How can tourism become ‘climatically sustainable'? |publisher= TU Delft |page= 187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green Key International''' is a leading international [[eco-label]] awarded to accommodations and other hospitality facilities that commit to sustainable business practices. Awarded establishments comply with strict criteria, independently verified through regular on-site audits.

It aims to contribute to the prevention of climate change by awarding and advocating facilities with positive environmental initiatives. Green Key is a non-governmental, non-profit, independent programme operating under the umbrella organisation of the [[Foundation for Environmental Education]], FEE. The programme is recognised and supported by the [[World Tourism Organization]], WTO and [[United Nations Environmental Programme]], UNEP. Green Key has an international programme administration at the FEE Head Office in Copenhagen and Green Key National Operators in most member countries implementing the programme on national levels. 

Green Key is one of the largest eco-labels for the hospitality industry worldwide and currently has more than 2,900 awarded hotels and other establishments in 57 countries.

== Aims ==
Green Key aims to

*  Increase the use of environmentally friendly and sustainable methods of operation and technology in the establishments and thereby reduce the overall use of resources. 
*  Raise awareness and create behavioural changes in guests, staff and suppliers of individual tourism establishments.
*  Increase the use of environmentally friendly and sustainable methods and raise awareness to create behavioural changes in the hospitality and tourism industry overall.

== History ==
Green Key International began in Denmark in 1994 and was adopted by the [[Foundation for Environmental Education]] in 2002 to become its fifth international partner. It has since spread to nearly 60 countries and continues to grow in number and reach across the world.

Commercial websites, such as Bookdifferent.com, is partnering with Green Key to entice travelers to book eco friendly hotels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/bookdifferentcom-puts-green-hotels-under-one-roof-1019706|title=BookDifferent.com Puts Green Hotels Under One Roof|date=2013-01-16|newspaper=International Business Times|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://travel.cnn.com/bookdifferent-green-hotel-booking-site-793271/|title=BookDifferent aims to make it easier being green {{!}} CNN Travel|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria ==
Tourism facilities awarded a Green Key adhere to national or international Green Key criteria. The criteria have been designed to be easily understood by travellers, feasible for the tourism industry, and clearly verifiable through control checks.

International criteria reflect the various fields of tourism facilities (hotels, hostels, camp sites, conference and holiday centres, tourist attractions and restaurants) and specialized national criteria reflect each country’s legislation, infrastructure and culture.

The criteria focus on environmental management, technical demands and initiatives for the involvement of guests, staff and suppliers. Some of the categories covered are: Water, Waste, Energy, Involvement and Awareness of Guests, Environmental Management, Staff Involvement, Use of Chemicals, Open Spaces, and Food and Beverages.

== Five pillars ==
The Green Key programme rests on five pillars:

*  Education of staff, clients and owners towards increased sustainable development and environmental awareness in leisure establishments;
*  Environmental preservation by the reduction of the environmental impact of each establishment in the world scene;
*  Economical management by the reduction of consumption meaning a reduction of costs; 
*  Marketing strategy by the promotion of the Green Key label and the establishments using the Green Key icon;
*  Strengthening of the tourism and leisure branch by taking responsibility broader than then their individual establishments.

== Global Forest Fund ==
The Foundation for Environmental Education, which runs the Green Key Programme, uses a tool to compensate their [[CO2 emissions]] from flight travels. The funds are distributed by the programme [[Learning about Forests]] (LEAF), which involves children in planting tree activities.

== Similar certifications ==
[[Green Globe Company Standard|Green Globe]] is a similar program offering a certification process for the hospitality industry.

The '''Institute for Energy Research''' ('''IER''') is a [[Washington, D.C.]]-based non-profit organization that conducts research and analysis on the functions, operations, and government regulation of global energy markets.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/about/|publisher=Institute for Energy Research|accessdate=4 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; IER maintains that the [[free-market|free market]] provides the most inexpensive solutions to global energy and environmental challenges.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

==History==
The IER is the successor organization to the Institute for Humane Studies of Texas, an advocacy group established in 1984 by billionaire businessman and political donor [[Charles Koch]].&lt;ref name="Fang2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fang |first1=Lee |title=Charles Koch Personally Founded Group Protecting Oil Industry Hand-Outs, Documents Reveal |url=https://www.republicreport.org/2014/charles-koch-personally-founded-group-protecting-oil-industry-hand-outs-documents-reveal/ |website=Republic Report |publisher=Essential Information |accessdate=4 July 2018 |date=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to pay the Texas state franchise tax, IHST lost its charter in 1989, and was later rebranded as the Institute for Energy Research, or IER, under the presidency of [[Robert L. Bradley Jr.]], the former director of public policy analysis for [[Enron]].&lt;ref name="Fang2014"/&gt; IER began by distributing quarterly reports to a small but growing list of donors in the early 1990s and eventually expanded its publishing capabilities to include highly publicized studies. It was not until 2001 when Bradley secured funding to make IER a full-time organization. In 2007, IER was moved to Washington, D.C. where it transformed itself into an energy think tank producing research and analysis on global energy markets.&lt;ref name="humanevents.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://humanevents.com/2010/08/08/conservative-spotlight-institute-for-energy-research/|title=Conservative Spotlight: Institute for Energy Research|work=Human Events}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, an article in [[Mother Jones (magazine)|''Mother Jones'' magazine]] said IER was among the most prominent organizations questioning the existence and extent of [[scientific opinion on climate change|anthropogenic climate change]].&lt;ref name=motherjones20091204&gt;{{cite news |first=Josh |last=Harkinson |url=https://www.motherjones.com/special-reports/2009/12/dirty-dozen-climate-change-denial |title=The Dirty Dozen of Climate Change Denial |magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |date=December 4, 2009 |accessdate=September 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
The Institute's CEO and founder, [[Robert L. Bradley Jr.]], is a visiting fellow at the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] in London, a research fellow at the Center for Energy Economics at the University of Texas at Austin, and an adjunct scholar at the [[Cato Institute]] as well as the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instituteforenergyresearch.org/about/people/robert-bradley/|title=Robert L. Bradley, Jr., Author at IER|work=IER}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cato Institute: [http://www.cato.org/people/robert-bradley Robert L. Bradley, Jr.]&lt;/ref&gt; He has written seven books, including ''Capitalism at Work'' and ''Edison to Enron''.&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Energy: [http://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/staff/robert-l-bradley-jr/ Staff.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130507120112/http://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/staff/robert-l-bradley-jr/ |date=2013-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
IER is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization and is funded by tax deductible contributions from individuals, foundations and corporations.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2012/760/149/2012-760149778-09ca3f40-9.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; IER has received funding from the [[KBR (company)|Brown Foundation]] (started by founders of a construction and energy company), the [[Searle Freedom Trust]] and the [[Koch family foundations|Claude R. Lambe Charitable Foundation]].&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/secretmoney/2008/09/udall_radio_ad.html |title=New Group Tied To Oil Industry Runs Ads Promoting Drilling, Attacking Democrat |date=September 22, 2008 |accessdate=March 18, 2015 |first=Will |last=Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vogel|first1=Kenneth|title=Kochs linked to anti-Obama gas ads|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2012/03/kochs-linked-to-anti-obama-gas-ads-074643|accessdate=4 December 2015|publisher=[[Politico]]|date=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also previously received funding from [[ExxonMobil]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/05/23/us-exxon-funding-idUKN2328446120080523 | work=[[Reuters]] | first=Michael | last=Erman | title=Exxon again cuts funds for climate change skeptics | date=23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Petroleum Institute]],&lt;ref name=negin&gt;{{cite news|last1=Negin|first1=Elliott|title=Koch-Funded Climate Contrarians Make Mischief on Capitol Hill|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/elliott-negin/koch-funded-climate-contr_b_3620727.html|accessdate=7 October 2016|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Future Fund|Center to Protect Patient Rights]],&lt;ref name=negin/&gt; and [[Peabody Energy]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldenberg|first1=Suzanne|last2=Bengtsson|first2= Helena|title= Biggest US coal company funded dozens of groups questioning climate change|url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/13/peabody-energy-coal-mining-climate-change-denial-funding|accessdate=28 June 2016|publisher= [[The Guardian]]|date=June 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; IER says that it has not sought for or accepted financial support from the government.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

IER has been described as a [[front group]] for the fossil fuel industry, since it has accepted financial donations from firms in that sector.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=negin/&gt;&lt;ref name=motherjones20091204/&gt;

== American Energy Alliance ==
The Institute for Energy Research has a political arm, the American Energy Alliance (AEA). According to its website, the AEA engages in "grassroots public policy advocacy and debate" regarding energy and environmental policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanenergyalliance.org/about/|title=About|work=American Energy Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, AEA ran television advertisements in opposition to the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]], also known as the [[Henry Waxman|Waxman]]-[[Ed Markey|Markey]] Bill, that proposed an [[emissions trading]] plan to reduce [[greenhouse gas emissions]] in order to address [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=motherjones20091204/&gt;

In 2013, AEA provided an online petition to U.S. Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] regarding the U.S. federal government administration's approval of the [[Keystone XL]] pipeline extension. AEA supports approval of the pipeline.&lt;ref name=aeahomepage&gt;

'''Janet Elizabeth Aalfs''' (born August 14, 1956)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert J Elster|title=International Who's Who in Poetry 2005|year=2004|publisher=Europa Publications|place=London, New York|isbn=978-1857432695}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] [[poet]] and [[martial artist]]. She is a founding member of Valley Women's Martial Arts and the National Women's Martial Arts Federation, and founder and director of Lotus Peace Arts.&lt;ref name="laureate"&gt;{{cite web|title=Poet Laureate|url=http://www.northamptonartscouncil.org/p/poet-laureate.html|publisher=Northampton Arts Council|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as [[poet laureate]] of [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] from 2003-05.&lt;ref name="laureate"/&gt;

==Life and work==
As a 13-year-old, Aalfs wrote her first poem, and began focusing on her writing practice. Her father (1922–2001), a minister, is credited with teaching Aalfs about the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s. By the age of sixteen, Aalfs had participated in assisting her mother in the founding of the women's center in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], read and found inspiration in ''[[Sisterhood is Powerful]]'', and had her poems published by the women's center at [[Southeastern Massachusetts University]].&lt;ref name="Hoppe1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Love2006"/&gt; 

During her first year at [[Hampshire College]], in 1974, she joined the women's center and registered for [[women's studies]] classes at University of Massachusetts, which shared classes with Hampshire.&lt;ref name="Love2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara J. Love|title=Feminists who changed America, 1963-1975|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpNarH7t9CkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=January 3, 2012|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03189-2|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual orientation===
While still in college, Aalfs would [[come out of the closet]] as a [[lesbian]].&lt;ref name="Love2006"/&gt; She would go on to get her [[Master's of Fine Arts|Master's of Fine Arts]] degree from [[Sarah Lawrence College]].&lt;ref name="Hoppe1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephanie T. Hoppe|title=Sharp spear, crystal mirror: martial arts in women's lives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FzOOgDbfousC&amp;pg=PA206|accessdate=January 3, 2012|date=March 1, 1998|publisher=Inner Traditions/Bear &amp; Co|isbn=978-0-89281-662-0|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Shortly thereafter she founded a women's writing group, and eventually two lesbian writing groups: Calypso Borealis and the Tuesday Night Lesbian Writers Group. She also founded Orogeny Press, a publishing house for fiction and lesbian poetry. In 1978, Aalfs began practicing [[martial arts]] and became a founding member of Valley Women's Martial Arts and the Institute for Healing and Violence Prevention Strategies (VWMA/HAVPS) and the National Women's Martial Arts Federation.&lt;ref name="Love2006"/&gt;

===2000s===
Aalfs, founder and director of Lotus Peace Arts, has served as the director and member of the Leaders Group of VWMA since 1982.&lt;ref name="Hoppe1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Love2006"/&gt; 

She holds a seventh-degree [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in [[Shuri-ryū]], a sixth-degree black belt in [[Modern Arnis]], and is a Jian Mei Chief Instructor of [[tai chi]] and [[qigong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/living/index.ssf/2011/07/martial_art_classes_provide_confidence_and_defense_training.html "Martial art classes provide confidence and defense training"], masslive.com; accessed January 20, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2003 and 2005, she served as the [[poet laureate]] for Northampton, Massachusetts. In 2013, she received the Leadership and Advocacy in the Arts Award from the Center for Women and Community, UMass/Amherst.&lt;ref name="Bird1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bird of a Thousand Eyes|publisher=Collective Copies|url=http://www.collectivecopies.com/publishing/feature_aalfs_bird.htm|accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her partner live and work in Northampton.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Poetry==
{{unsourced|section|date=January 2018}}
Kathy Goos, of the Northampton Arts Council, described Aalfs' poetry as having a "musical quality." Her work has also been inspired by [[Elizabeth Bishop]], [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Lucille Clifton]], [[Stanley Kunitz]], among others. As poet laureate of Northampton, she was paid $1,000 a year.

He was the son of lawyer John Schjelderup Giæver (1864&amp;ndash;1914) and his wife Thyra Høegh (1879&amp;ndash;1954).&lt;ref name=genea&gt;[http://holmboe.slekt.no/data/0007/9268.htm Slekten Holmboe gjennom 300 år]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the great-great-great-grandson of [[Jens Holmboe (bailiff)|Jens Holmboe]].

John Schjelderup Giæver married Oddbjørg Jacobsen in March 1940 and they had a son in April the same year. However, the marriage was dissolved. Giæver married Anna Margrethe Gløersen in 1948; this time they had a daughter, born 1954.&lt;ref name=genea/&gt;

==Career==
He took his secondary education in [[Trondheim]] in 1920, and then moved back to Tromsø. He started a newspaper career, as sub-editor of ''[[Tromsø Stiftstidende]]'' from 1921 to 1922. He was editor-in-chief in ''[[Vesteraalens Avis]]'' from 1922 to 1928 and ''Tromsø Stiftstidende'' from 1928 to 1929. He lived as a [[animal trapping|trapper]] in north-eastern [[Greenland]] from 1929 to 1934. In 1935 he was hired as secretary for ''Norges Svalbard- og Ishavsundersøkelser'', the Norwegian institution for exploration of [[Svalbard]] and the [[Arctic Sea]],&lt;ref name=nbl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=John Giæver|encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Nils Magne|last=Knutsen|editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/.nbl_biografi/John_Gi%C3%A6ver/utdypning|language=Norwegian|accessdate=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; later renamed into the [[Norwegian Polar Institute]].

During [[World War II]], he first fled to London where he worked as a secretary for the exiled government. From 1941 to 1944, he served with the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]]-in-exile at [[Little Norway]], Canada. In 1944, with the rank of Major, he was sent to [[Northern Norway]] to participate in the successful [[Liberation of Northern Norway|liberation from Nazi occupation]]. In 1947 he returned to the Norwegian Polar Institute as secretary, and from 1948 to 1960 he was office manager. However, he was still involved in the field as well, leading the wintering party of the [[Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition]] from 1949 to 1952.&lt;ref name=nbl/&gt;

Giæver published several books. His literary career began with ''Illgjerningsmand'' (''A Misdeeder'') (1921), which was translated into German in 1923. His book ''Maudheim. To år i Antarktis'' (1952), describing the [[Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition|Antarctic Expedition]] was translated into English, French, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Finnish, German and Croatian.  From 1955 on he renewed his literary authorship with numerous books of documentary and partly autobiographical topics, covering Arctic trapping, fishing and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://snl.no/John_Schjelderup_Gi%C3%A6ver|title=   John Schjelderup Giæver|publisher= Store norske leksikon|accessdate= June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the plain of [[Leivithra]] in 1997 began the excavation work on the ancient winery '''Kompoloi''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Κομπολόι). They lasted (intermittently) until October 2000.

== Location ==
Approximately 500 meters east of the national road A 1 (E 75) and 700 meters west of the coastline of [[Skotina]].&lt;ref&gt;ΕΦΟΡΕΙΑ ΠΡΟΪΣΤΟΡΙΚΩΝ ΚΑΙ ΚΛΑΣΙΚΩΝ ΑΡΧΑΙΟΤΗΤΩΝ,ΠΙΕΡΙΑ,Κομπολόι (in Greek language)&lt;/ref&gt;

== The building ==
The building was erected in the middle of the 4th century BC and used until the beginning of the 3rd century BC; then it was destroyed by a fire and abandoned by its inhabitants. It has a floor area of around 1350 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and was built on an existing vineyard. Two buildings, a residential building and a farmhouse, stood at a central courtyard; in the north and south there were other buildings. The excavated building had 17 rooms. In the east, a cellar was uncovered whose foundations probably bore a tower. Next to the southern entrance was a well and an oven.&lt;ref&gt;Efi Poulaki-Pantermali: ''Oikos - Oikia - Oikonomia, Polis - Politiki - Politismos'' Ministry for Culture and Sport, Thessaloniki 2014, page 56, {{ISBN|978-960-386-139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date= |title= Leivithra Komboloi (Λείβηθρα - Κομπολόϊ)|trans-title= |medium= |language= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QALc4ITBk0|access-date= |archive-url= |archive-date= |format= |time= |location= |publisher= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The finds ==
[[File:Kompoloi Gutshof.jpg|thumb|Kompoloi, Replica of the winery of Kompoloi, Thematic park of Leivithra]]
Clay pots in which the wine was stored were buried in the ground. In total, 32 of these vessels were found. The height was 2.15 meters, the diameter 1.60 meters, the material was 3 - 4 cm thick. The capacity was nearly 2000 liters. One of these, Pithoi (Πίθοι) called, container is exhibited in the [[Archaeological Museum of Thessaloniki]]. Furthermore, lead clamps for repairing the vessels, clay lids, grape seeds and resin were found.&lt;ref&gt;Efi Poulaki-Pantermali: ''Oikos - Oikia - Oikonomia, Polis - Politiki - Politismos'' Ministry for Culture and Sport, Thessaloniki 2014, page 66, {{ISBN|978-960-386-139-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The viniculture ==
Archaeobotanical investigations showed that as early as the 4th millennium BC wine was cultivated in middle east. A little later, wine was grown in [[Thrace]] and thus reached the region of [[Mount Olympus]]. Harvested from the end of August, the grapes were pressed and filled into the pithoi. At least every 36 days, the containers were opened and the contents checked. On the first day of [[Anthesteria]], a feast in honor of the god [[Dionysus]], the clay vessels were finally opened and the wine could be drunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.leivithrapark.gr/en/park-of-leivithra/archaeological-information-building/viticulture-vinification/|title=Viticulture / Vinification}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8898">This is a list of all the former [[United States National Forest|National Forest]]s in the [[United States]].  These units were renamed, disestablished, combined with other units or split apart during reorganizations of the [[U.S. Forest Service]] system.  There was particular turnover during the first decade of the 20th century, when the forest system was reorganized several times, most notably on July 1, 1908. Many smaller holdings of fewer than {{convert|100000|acre|km2}} were combined.  In the 1920s a short-lived program created several National Forests from excess portions of military facilities.  Within two years these transfers were reconsidered and rescinded.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=National Forests of the United States |url=https://foresthistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/National-Forests-of-the-U.S.pdf |format=pdf |date=September 29, 2005 |author=Davis, Richard C. |publisher=[[Forest History Society]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mt. Elbert.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Mount Elbert]] in the [[Sawatch Range]] is the [[topographic elevation|highest]] [[summit (topography)|peak]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the highest point in [[Colorado]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the '''100 [[Topographic prominence|most topographically prominent]] [[Summit|mountain peaks]] of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Colorado|State of Colorado]]'''.

[[Elevation|Topographic elevation]] is the vertical distance above the reference [[geoid]], a mathematical model of the Earth's [[sea level]] as an [[equipotential]] [[Gravity|gravitational]] surface.  The [[topographic prominence]] of a [[summit]] is the elevation difference between that summit and the highest or key [[col]] to a higher summit.  The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the minimum [[great-circle distance]] to a point of equal elevation.

This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence, and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  There are [[List of the ultra-prominent summits of the United States|126 ultra-prominent summits in the United States]].

All elevations include an adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].

If an elevation or prominence is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.

The '''Madrean [[sky island|Sky Island]]s''' are enclaves of [[Madrean pine-oak woodlands]], found at higher elevations in a complex of small mountain ranges in southern and southeastern [[Arizona]], southwestern [[New Mexico]], and northwestern [[Mexico]]. The sky islands are surrounded at lower elevations by the [[Sonoran Desert|Sonoran]] and [[Chihuahuan desert]]s. The northern west–east perimeter of the sky island region merges into the higher elevation eastern [[Mogollon Rim]] and the [[White Mountains (Arizona)|White Mountains]] of eastern Arizona (southern [[Anasazi]] region).

The sky islands are the northernmost of the Madrean pine-oak woodlands, and are classified as part of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental pine-oak forests]] [[ecoregion]], of the [[tropical and subtropical coniferous forests]] [[biome]]. The sky islands were isolated from one another and from the pine-oak woodlands of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] to the south by the warming and drying of the climate since the [[ice age]]s.

There are approximately 27 Madrean sky islands in the United States, and 15 in northern Mexico.  The major Madrean sky island ranges in Arizona are the [[Baboquivari Mountains]], [[Chiricahua Mountains]], [[Huachuca Mountains]], [[Pinaleño Mountains]], [[Santa Catalina Mountains]], [[Santa Rita Mountains]] and [[Whetstone Mountains]]. Similar sky island ranges include the [[Animas Mountains]] in New Mexico and the [[Guadalupe Mountains]], [[Davis Mountains]] and [[Chisos Mountains]] in west Texas.

== Cooperation with other countries ==

=== Germany ===
Ministry of Energy of Azerbaijan held a meeting with the representatives of Eastern committee of German economy on 13 February 2018. Parviz Shahbazov mentioned that the history of economic and cultural cooperation of Azerbaijan with Germany started 200 years ago, when the German from Vurtemberg moved to Azerbaijan. Also he noted that more than 200 Germany based firms operate in Azerbaijan. “[[Uniper]]” company plays a role in the development of this cooperation too. It is also one of the companies, which is going to buy gas from [[Shah Deniz gas field|Shahdeniz]] Stage 2 Azerbaijan and Germany are going to exploit the alternative energy with the aim of strengthening economic relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minenergy.gov.az/news/52/1530.html|title=Azərbaycan Respublikasının Energetika Nazirliyi|website=minenergy.gov.az|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''oak''' is a [[tree]] or [[shrub]] in the [[genus]] '''''Quercus''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|w|ɜːr|k|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/sunsetwesterngar00suns ''Sunset Western Garden Book,''] 1995, Leisure Arts, pp. 606–607, {{ISBN|0376038519}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin]] "oak tree") of the [[beech]] family, [[Fagaceae]]. There are approximately [[list of Quercus species|600 extant species of oaks]]. The common name "oak" also appears in the names of species in related genera, notably ''[[Lithocarpus]]'' (stone oaks), as well as in those of unrelated species such as ''[[Grevillea robusta]]'' (silky oaks) and the [[Casuarinaceae]] (she-oaks). The genus ''Quercus'' is native to the Northern Hemisphere, and includes [[deciduous]] and [[evergreen]] species extending from [[temperateness|cool temperate]] to [[tropical]] latitudes in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and North Africa. North America contains the largest number of oak species, with approximately 90 occurring in the United States, while Mexico has 160 species of which 109 are endemic. The second greatest center of oak diversity is China, which contains approximately 100 species.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, C. Michael (2012) [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Oak ''Oak''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523173442/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Oak |date=23 May 2013 }}. ed. Arthur Dawson. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Quercus 20180406 100657.jpg|thumb|Oak: male flowers]]
Oaks have [[spiral]]ly arranged leaves, with [[Dentate leaf|lobate margins]] in many species; some have [[serrated leaves]] or entire leaves with smooth margins.  Many deciduous species are [[marcescent]], not dropping dead leaves until spring. In spring, a single oak tree produces both male flowers (in the form of [[catkin]]s) and small female flowers.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, Jim. [http://www.backyardnature.net/fl_bloak.htm "Oak Flowers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104064011/http://www.backyardnature.net/fl_bloak.htm |date=4 November 2013 }}. backyardnature.com. 2011-12-12.

==Classification==
The oak tree is a [[flowering plant]]. Oaks may be divided into two genera (sometimes referred to as [[subgenera]]) and a number of [[section (botany)|sections]]:

===Genus ''Quercus''===
[[File:Eiche bei Schönderling, 2.jpg|Oak at Schönderling|thumb|upright=1.15]]
{{See also|List of Quercus species}}
The genus ''Quercus'' is divided into the following sections:
* Sect. ''Quercus'' (synonyms ''Lepidobalanus'' and ''Leucobalanus''), the [[Lepidobalanus|white oaks]] of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North America]]. [[Style (botany)|Styles]] are short; acorns mature in 6 months and taste sweet or slightly bitter; the inside of an acorn shell is hairless. The leaves mostly lack a bristle on their lobe tips, which are usually rounded. The type species is [[Quercus robur]].
* Sect. ''Mesobalanus'', [[Mesobalanus|Hungarian oak and its relatives]] of Europe and Asia. Styles long; acorns mature in about 6 months and taste bitter; the inside of this acorn's shell is hairless. The section ''Mesobalanus'' is closely related to section ''Quercus'' and sometimes included in it.
* Sect. ''Cerris'', the [[Cerris|Turkey oak and its relatives]] of Europe and Asia. Styles long; acorn mature in 18 months and taste very bitter. The inside of the acorn's shell is hairless. Its leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with bristles at the lobe tip.
* Sect. ''Protobalanus'', the [[Protobalanus|canyon live oak and its relatives]], in southwest [[United States]] and northwest [[Mexico]]. Styles short, acorns mature in 18 months and taste very bitter. The inside of the acorn shell appears woolly. Leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with bristles at the lobe tip.
* Sect. ''Lobatae'' (synonym ''Erythrobalanus''), the [[Erythrobalanus|red oaks]] of North America, [[Central America]] and northern [[South America]]. Styles long; acorns mature in 18 months and taste very bitter. The inside of the acorn shell appears woolly. The actual nut is encased in a thin, clinging, papery skin. Leaves typically have sharp lobe tips, with spiny bristles at the lobe.

===Genus ''Cyclobalanopsis''===
[[File: Tamm Koluvere järve kaldal.jpg|thumb| Old oak tree on the shore of Lake Koluvere, [[Estonia]].]]
* The [[List of Quercus species#Subgenus Cyclobalanopsis|ring-cupped oaks]] of eastern and southeastern [[Asia]]. Evergreen trees growing {{convert|10|–|40|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall. They are distinct from subgenus ''Quercus'' in that they have acorns with distinctive cups bearing concrescent rings of scales; they commonly also have densely clustered acorns, though this does not apply to all of the species. IUCN, ITIS, Encyclopedia of Life and [https://web.archive.org/web/20060922110239/http://flora.huh.harvard.edu:8080/flora/browse.do?flora_id=2&amp;taxon_id=108828 ''Flora of China''] treats ''Cyclobalanopsis'' as a distinct [[genus]], but some taxonomists consider it a [[subgenus]] of ''Quercus''. It contains about 150 species. Species of ''Cyclobalanopsis'' are common in the evergreen subtropical [[laurel forest]]s which extend from southern Japan, southern Korea, and Taiwan across southern China and northern Indochina to the eastern Himalayas, in association with trees of genus ''[[Castanopsis]]'' and the laurel family ([[Lauraceae]]).

==Hybridization==
[[File:Quercus stellata.jpg|thumb|A hybrid white oak, possibly ''[[Post oak|Quercus stellata]]'' × ''[[Chinkapin oak|Q. muhlenbergii]]'']]
[[Interspecific hybridization]] is quite common among oaks but usually between species within the same section only and most common in the white oak group (subgenus ''Quercus'', section ''Quercus''; see '''[[List of Quercus species|List of ''Quercus'' species]]'''). Inter-section hybrids, except between species of sections ''Quercus'' and ''Mesobalanus'', are unknown. Recent systematic studies appear to confirm a high tendency of ''Quercus'' species to hybridize because of a combination of factors. White oaks are unable to discriminate against pollination by other species in the same section. Because they are [[wind pollinated]] and they have weak internal barriers to hybridization, hybridization produces functional seeds and fertile hybrid offspring.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Ecological stresses, especially near habitat margins, can also cause a breakdown of mate recognition as well as a reduction of male function (pollen quantity and quality) in one parent species.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Frequent hybridization among oaks has consequences for oak populations around the world; most notably, hybridization has produced large populations of hybrids with copious amounts of [[introgression]], and the [[evolution]] of new species.&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; Frequent hybridization and high levels of introgression have caused different species in the same populations to share up to 50% of their genetic information.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt; Having high rates of hybridization and introgression produces genetic data that often does not differentiate between two clearly morphologically distinct species, but instead differentiates populations.&lt;ref name=r4/&gt; Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain how oak species are able to remain morphologically and ecologically distinct with such high levels of [[gene flow]], but the phenomenon is still largely a mystery to botanists.

The [[Fagaceae]], or beech family, to which the oaks belong, is a very slow evolving [[clade]] compared to other [[angiosperm]]s,&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;&lt;ref name=r6/&gt; and the patterns of hybridization and introgression in ''Quercus'' pose a great challenge to the [[biological species concept|concept of a species]] since a species is often defined as a group of “actually or potentially interbreeding populations which are reproductively isolated from other such groups.”&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; By this definition, many species of ''Quercus'' would be lumped together according to their geographic and ecological habitat, despite clear distinctions in morphology and, to a large extent, genetic data.

==Uses==
[[File:Charpente eglise Saint-Girons Monein.jpg|thumb|upright|Heart of oak [[Beam (structure)|beams]] of the frame of Saint-Girons church in [[Monein]], France]]
Oak [[wood]] has a density of about {{convert|0.75|g/cm3|oz/cuin|abbr=on|lk=on}} creating great strength and hardness. The wood is very resistant to insect and fungal attack because of its high [[tannin]] content. It also has very appealing grain markings, particularly when [[quartersawn]]. Oak planking was common on high status [[Viking]] [[longship]]s in the 9th and 10th centuries. The wood was hewn from green logs, by axe and wedge, to produce radial planks, similar to quarter-sawn timber. Wide, quarter-sawn boards of oak have been prized since the [[Middle Ages]] for use in interior panelling of prestigious buildings such as the debating chamber of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in [[London]] and in the construction of fine furniture. Oak wood, from ''[[Quercus robur]]'' and ''[[Quercus petraea]]'', was used in Europe for the construction of [[ship]]s, especially naval [[man-of-war|men of war]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baugh|first=Daniel A.|title=British Naval Administration in the Age of Walpole|year=1965|page=242|publisher=Princeton University Press|oclc=610026758}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the 19th century, and was the principal timber used in the construction of European [[timber framing|timber-framed]] buildings. Today oak wood is still commonly used for [[furniture]] making and flooring, timber frame buildings, and veneer production. 

[[Barrel (storage)|Barrels]] in which [[wine]]s, [[sherry]], and spirits such as [[brandy]], [[Irish whiskey]], [[Scotch whisky]] and [[Bourbon whiskey]] are [[Aging barrel|aged]] are made from European and American oak, with [[single barrel whiskey]] fetching a premium. The use of [[oak (wine)|oak in wine]] can add many different dimensions to wine based on the type and style of the oak. Oak barrels, which may be charred before use, contribute to the colour, taste, and aroma of the contents, imparting a desirable oaky [[vanillin]] flavour to these drinks. The great dilemma for wine producers is to choose between French and American oakwoods. French oaks (''Quercus robur'', ''Q. petraea'') give the wine greater refinement and are chosen for the best wines since they increase the price compared to those aged in American oak wood. American oak contributes greater texture and resistance to ageing, but produces more powerful wine bouquets. Oak wood chips are used for [[smoking (cooking)|smoking]] fish, meat, [[cheese]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071110000359/http://www.swaledalecheese.co.uk/cheese.htm Cheese]. swaledalecheese.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; and other foods.

Japanese oak is used in the making of professional drums from the manufacturer [[Yamaha Drums]]. The higher density of oak gives the drum a brighter and louder tone compared to traditional drum materials such as [[maple]] and [[birch]]. In hill states of India, besides fuelwood and timber, the local people use oak wood for making agricultural implements. The leaves are used as fodder during lean period and bedding for livestock.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chandra Prakash Kala|Kala, C.P.]] (2004).

[[File:Cork oak trunk section.jpg|thumb|A cross section of the trunk of a [[cork oak]], ''Quercus suber'']]
The bark of the [[cork oak]] is used to produce [[wine]] [[stopper (plug)|stoppers]] (corks). This species grows in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] region, with [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Algeria]], and [[Morocco]] producing most of the world's supply.

Of the North American oaks, the [[northern red oak]] is one of the most prized of the red oak group for lumber, much of which is marketed as red oak regardless of the species of origin. It is not good for outdoor use due to its open capillaries unless the wood is treated. If the wood is properly treated with preservatives, it will not rot as quickly as cured white oak heartwood. The closed cell structure of white oaks prevents them from absorbing preservatives. With northern red oak, one can blow air through an end grain piece 10&amp;nbsp;inches long to make bubbles come out in a glass of water. These openings give fungus easy access when the finish deteriorates. [[Shumard oak]], a member of the red oak subgenus, provides timber which is described as "mechanically superior" to northern red oak. [[Cherrybark oak]] is another type of red oak which provides excellent timber.

The standard for the lumber of the white oak group – all of which is marketed as white oak – is the ''[[Quercus alba]]''. White oak is often used to make [[wine barrel]]s. The wood of the [[deciduous]] [[pedunculate oak]] and [[sessile oak]] accounts for most of the European oak production, but evergreen species, such as [[Holm oak]] and cork oak also produce valuable timber.

The [[bark (biology)|bark]] of the white oak is dried and used in medical preparations. [[Oak bark]] is also rich in [[tannin]], and is used by tanners for [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] [[leather]]. [[Acorn]]s are used for making flour or roasted for acorn coffee.

==Biodiversity and ecology==

Oaks are [[keystone species]] in a wide range of habitats from Mediterranean semi-desert to subtropical rainforest. For example, oak trees are important components of hardwood forests, and certain species are particularly known to grow in associations with members of the [[Ericaceae]] in [[oak–heath forest]]s.&lt;ref name=r10/&gt;&lt;ref name=r11/&gt; A number of kinds of [[truffle]]s, including the two well known varieties, the black [[Tuber melanosporum|Périgord truffle]]&lt;ref name=r12/&gt; and the white Piedmont truffle,&lt;ref name=r13/&gt; have symbiotic relationships with oak trees. Similarly many other mushrooms such as ''[[Ramaria flavosaponaria]]'' also associate with oaks.&lt;ref name="Nirschl"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nirschl |first1=Rick |title=Mushrooms of the Oak Openings |url=http://www.toledonaturalist.org/~naturalist/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/fungifinal3_sheet1.pdf |website=Toledo Naturalists' Association |publisher=Toledo Naturalists' Association |accessdate=19 July 2018 |page=4 |language=English |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petersen"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Petersen |first1=Ronald H. |authorlink1=Ron Petersen |title=Notes on Clavarioid Fungi.

Many species of oaks are under threat of extinction in the wild, largely due to land use changes, livestock grazing and unsustainable harvesting. For example, over the past 200 years, large areas of oak forest in the highlands of Mexico, Central America and the northern Andes have been cleared for coffee plantations and cattle ranching. There is a continuing threat to these forests from exploitation for timber, fuelwood and charcoal.&lt;ref name=r14/&gt; In the USA, entire oak ecosystems have declined due to a combination of factors still imperfectly known, but thought to include fire suppression, increased consumption of acorns by growing mammal populations, herbivory of seedlings, and introduced pests.&lt;ref name=r15/&gt; In a recent survey, 78 wild oak species have been identified as being in danger of extinction, from a global total of over 500 species.&lt;ref name=r16/&gt; The proportion under threat may be much higher in reality, as there is insufficient information about over 300 species, making it near impossible to form any judgement of their status.

In the Himalayan region of India, oak forests are being invaded by pine forests due to the increase in temperature. The associated species of pine forest may cross frontiers and become new elements of the oak forests.&lt;ref&gt;Kala, C.P. (2012). ''Biodiversity, communities and climate change''. Teri Publications, New Delhi, {{ISBN|817993442X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In eastern North America, rare species of oak trees include scarlet oak (''[[Quercus coccinea]]''), chinkapin oak (''[[Quercus muehlenbergii]]''), and post oak (''[[Quercus stellata]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carpenter|first=Paul|title=Plants in the Landscape|year=1990|publisher=W.H. Freeman and Company|location=New York|pages=73|isbn=0716718081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mature trees shed varying numbers of acorns annually. Scientists suggest that shedding excess numbers allows the oaks to satiate nut gathering species, improving the chances of germination. Every four to ten years, certain oak populations will synchronize to produce almost no acorns at all, only to rain them down excessively the following year, known as a "mast" year. The year preceding the mast year is thought to starve off the mammal populations feeding on the supply, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the overproduction in the mast year that follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2007/10/13/up-to-your-ankles-in-acorns-heres-why/|title=Up to your ankles in acorns?

==Genetics==

Beginning November 1, 2011, a project began to sequence the entire oak genome. The goal of the project is to create a high resolution sequence of the Quercus robur genome, and to study genetic diversity by comparison of the genomes of different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://w3.pierroton.inra.fr/QuercusPortal/index.php?p=OAK_GENOME_SEQUENCING|title=Quercus Portal|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229140749/https://w3.pierroton.inra.fr/QuercusPortal/index.php?p=OAK_GENOME_SEQUENCING|archivedate=29 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current research has compiled genomic data from many different sources and techniques to create a genome map with 89% coverage of the genome. The project is still in the process of annotating this genome.&lt;ref&gt;Plomion, C., Aury, J.-M., Amselem, J., Alaeitabar, T., Barbe, V., Belser, C., Bergès, H., Bodénès, C., Boudet, N., Boury, C., Canaguier, A., Couloux, A., Da Silva, C., Duplessis, S., Ehrenmann, F., Estrada-Mairey, B., Fouteau, S., Francillonne, N., Gaspin, C., Guichard, C., Klopp, C., Labadie, K., Lalanne, C., Le Clainche, I., Leplé, J.-C., Le Provost, G., Leroy, T., Lesur, I., Martin, F., Mercier, J., Michotey, C., Murat, F., Salin, F., Steinbach, D., Faivre-Rampant, P., Wincker, P., Salse, J., Quesneville, H. and Kremer, A.

==Diseases and pests==
{{See also|List of Lepidoptera that feed on oaks}}
[[File:Oak Mildew.JPG|thumb|Oak [[powdery mildew]] on pedunculate oak]]
[[Sudden oak death]] (''Phytophthora ramorum'') is a [[water mould]] that can kill oaks within just a few weeks. [[Oak wilt]], caused by the fungus ''Ceratocystis fagacearum'' (a fungus closely related to [[Dutch elm disease]]), is also a lethal disease of some oaks, particularly the red oaks (the white oaks can be infected but generally live longer). Other dangers include [[Woodboring beetle|wood-boring]] [[beetle]]s, as well as root [[Dry rot|rot]] in older trees which may not be apparent on the outside, often being discovered only when the trees come down in a strong [[gale]]. [[Oak apple]]s are [[gall]]s on oaks made by the [[gall wasp]]. The female [[kermes (genus)|kermes]] [[scale insect|scale]] causes galls to grow on [[kermes oak]]. Oaks are used as food plants by the [[larva]]e of [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species such as the [[gypsy moth]], ''Lymantria dispar'', which can defoliate oak and other broadleaved tree species in North America.&lt;ref name=r17/&gt;

A considerable number of [[galls]] are found on oak leaves, buds, flowers, roots, etc. Examples are [[oak artichoke gall]], [[oak marble gall]], [[oak apple]] gall, [[knopper gall]], and [[Neurotus quercus-baccarum|spangle gall]].

A number of species of fungus cause [[powdery mildew]] on oak species. In Europe the species ''[[Erysiphe alphitoides]]'' is the most common cause.&lt;ref name=mougou/&gt;

A new and yet little understood disease of mature oaks, [[acute oak decline]], has been reported in parts of the [[UK]] since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

[[Oak Processionary|Oak processionary moth]] (''Thaumetopoea processionea'') has become a serious threat in the UK since 2006. The caterpillars of this species defoliate the trees, and are hazardous to human health; their bodies are covered with poisonous hairs which can cause rashes and respiratory problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Invasion of toxic moths|newspaper=The Northern Echo|date=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, oaks are affected by the fungal disease [[Foamy bark canker]].

==Toxicity==
The leaves and acorns of the oak tree are poisonous to [[cattle]], [[horse]]s, [[sheep]], and [[goat]]s in large amounts due to the toxin [[tannic acid]], and cause kidney damage and [[gastroenteritis]]. Symptoms of poisoning include [[Anorexia (symptom)|lack of appetite]], depression, constipation, diarrhea (which may contain blood), [[Hematuria|blood in urine]], and [[equine colic|colic]]. The exception to livestock and oak toxicity is the [[domestic pig]], which may be fed entirely on acorns in the right conditions, and has traditionally been pastured in oak woodlands (such as the Spanish ''[[dehesa (pastoral management)|dehesa]]'' and the English system of [[pannage]]) for hundreds of years.

[[Acorn]]s are also edible to humans, after [[leaching (chemistry)|leaching]] of the tannins.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=D.

====Oaks as regional and state symbols====
The oak is the emblem of [[County Londonderry]] in [[Northern Ireland]], as a vast amount of the county was covered in forests of the tree until relatively recently. The name of the county comes from the city of [[Derry]], which originally in [[Irish language|Irish]] was known as ''Doire'' meaning ''oak''.

The Irish [[County Kildare]] derives its name from the town of [[Kildare]] which originally in [[Irish language|Irish]] was ''Cill Dara'' meaning the Church of the Oak or Oak Church.

[[Iowa]] designated the oak as its official [[list of U.S. state trees|state tree]] in 1961; and the White Oak is the state tree of [[Connecticut]], [[Illinois]] and [[Maryland]]. The [[Northern Red Oak]] is the provincial tree of [[Prince Edward Island]], as well as the state tree of [[New Jersey]]. The Live Oak is the state tree of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia, USA]].

The oak is a national symbol from the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], specially in the province of [[Biscay]]. 

The oak is a symbol of the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]; the coat-of-arms and flag of [[Oakland, California]] feature the oak and the logo of the [[East Bay Regional Park District]] is an oak leaf. 

The coat-of-arms of [[Vest-Agder]], [[Norway]], and [[Blekinge]], [[Sweden]], features oak trees. 

The coat-of-arms of the municipality [[Eigersund]], Norway features an oak leaf. 

Oak leaves are traditionally an important part of German Army regalia.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
The Nazi party used the traditional German eagle, standing atop of a swastika inside a wreath of oak leaves. It is also known as the Iron Eagle.
During the Third Reich of Nazi Germany, oak leaves were used for military valor decoration on the Knights Cross of the Iron Cross.
They also symbolize rank in the [[United States Armed Forces]]. A gold oak leaf indicates an O-4 ([[Major (United States)|Major]] or [[Lieutenant commander|Lt. Commander]]), whereas a silver oak leaf indicates an O-5 ([[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lt. Colonel]] or [[Commander]]).

In [[Greek mythology]], the oak is the tree sacred to [[Zeus]], king of the gods. In Zeus's [[oracle]] in [[Dodona]], [[Epirus]], the sacred oak was the centerpiece of the precinct, and the priests would divine the pronouncements of the god by interpreting the rustling of the oak's leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, James George (1922).

Chapter XV: The Worship of the Oak.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521225940/http://www.bartleby.com/196/26.html |date=21 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Baltic mythology|Baltic]] and [[Slavic mythology]], the oak is the sacred tree of [[Latvian mythology|Latvian]] [[Pērkons]], [[Lithuanian mythology|Lithuanian]] Perkūnas, [[Prussian mythology|Prussian]] Perkūns and Slavic [[Perun]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ąžuolas paprastasis|url=https://gamtininkas.lt/augalai/azuolas-paprastasis-lot-quercus-robur-l/|website=Zolininkas.lt|accessdate=10 January 2018|language=lt-LT|date=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the god of thunder and one of the most important deities in the Baltic and Slavic pantheons.

In [[Celtic polytheism]], the name of the oak tree was part of the Proto-Celtic word for 'druid': ''*derwo-weyd-'' &gt; ''*druwid-'' ; however, Proto-Celtic ''*derwo-'' (and ''*dru-'') can also be adjectives for 'strong' and 'firm', so Ranko Matasovic interprets that ''*druwid-'' may mean 'strong knowledge'. As in other Indo-European faiths, [[Taranis]], being a thunder god, was associated with the oak tree.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, John W. (September 1979). [http://www.unz.org/Pub/MankindQuarterly-1979sep-00079 "Tree Worship"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140317195727/http://www.unz.org/Pub/MankindQuarterly-1979sep-00079 |date=17 March 2014 }}, ''Mankind Quarterly'', pp. 79–142.&lt;/ref&gt; The Indo-Europeans worshiped the oak and connected it with a thunder or lightning god; "tree" and ''drus'' may also be cognate with "Druid," the Celtic priest to whom the oak was sacred. There has even been a study that shows that oaks are more likely to be struck by lightning than any other tree of the same height.&lt;ref name=Credo&gt;{{cite book|title=Oak|work=A Dictionary of Literary Symbols|publisher=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Norse mythology]], the oak was sacred to the thunder god, [[Thor]]. [[Thor's Oak]] was a [[sacred tree]] of the Germanic [[Chatti]] tribe.

In the [[Bible]], the oak tree at [[Shechem]] is the site where Jacob buries the foreign gods of his people (Gen. 35:4) . In addition, Joshua erects a stone under an oak tree as the first covenant of the Lord (Josh. 24.25–7). In Isaiah 61, the prophet refers to the Israelites as "Oaks of Righteousness." Absalom's long hair (2 Samuel 18:9) gets caught in an oak tree, and allows Joab to kill him.

The [[Badnjak (Serbian)|badnjak]] is central tradition in [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] [[Christmas]] celebration where young and straight oak, is ceremonially felled early on the morning of Christmas Eve.

In some traditions of [[Wicca]], the Oak King is one of the two faces of the Sun God. He is born on Yule and rules from Ostara to Mabon.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Historical note on Linnaean species==
[[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] described only five species of oak from eastern North America, based on general leaf form. These were [[Quercus alba|white oak]], ''Quercus alba''; [[chestnut oak]], ''Q. montana''; [[Erythrobalanus|red oak]], ''Q. rubra''; [[willow oak]] ''Q. phellos''; and [[water oak]], ''Q. nigra''. Because he was dealing with confusing leaf forms, the ''Q. montana'' and ''Q. rubra'' specimens actually included mixed foliage of more than one species.

==Biography==

Schindewolf was on the faculty at the [[University of Marburg]] from 1919 until 1927.  Then he became director of the Geological Survey of Berlin.  In 1948 he became a professor at the [[University of Tübingen]], where he retired as professor emeritus in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TJso832AGXEC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=Schindewolf+University+of+Marburg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TXkEUaOnN4m70QWvowE&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Schindewolf%20University%20of%20Marburg&amp;f=false Annals of the History and Philosophy of Biology 11/2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a [[Saltation (biology)|saltationist]] who opposed the theory of gradual evolution, and in the 1930s suggested that major evolutionary transformations must have occurred in large leaps between species.  This idea became known as the [[saltation (biology)|Hopeful Monster]] theory and was further taken and developed up by the geneticist [[Richard Goldschmidt]] in the 1940s.  Schindewolf was also the first to suggest, in 1950, that [[mass extinction]]s might have been caused by [[Impact event|extraterrestrial impact]]s or nearby [[supernova]]. From 1948 until his retirement in 1964, Schindewolf was professor of Geology and Paleontology at the [[University of Tübingen]].

==Evolution==
As a saltationist Schindewolf had supported [[macromutation]]s as part of his evolutionary theory. He was known for presenting an alternative interpretation of the [[fossil record]], combining [[orthogenesis]], [[mutationism]] and extraterrestrial impacts, [[Alternatives to Darwinism|as opposed to Darwin]]'s [[gradualism]]. Schindewolf's theory claimed that variation tended to move in a predetermined direction.&lt;ref&gt;Chunglin Kwa. (2011). ''Styles of Knowing: A New History of Science from Ancient Times to the Present''. University of Pittsburgh Press. p. 237. {{ISBN|978-0822961512}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory became known as typostrophism and stated that [[evolution]] occurs due to a periodic cyclic model of evolutionary processes which are predestined to go through a life cycle dictated by factors internal to the organism.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Dimichele. (1995). [http://si-pddr.si.edu/jspui/bitstream/10088/7124/1/paleo_1995_DiMichele_Schindewolf_book_review_RPP.pdf ''Basic Questions in Paleontology: Geologic Time, Organic Evolution, and Biological Systematics, by Otto H. Schindewolf'']. Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology 84. 481–483.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LevitOlsson2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Levit, Georgy S.; Olsson, Lennart |title='Evolution on Rails' : Mechanisms and Levels of Orthogenesis |journal=Annals of the History and Philosophy of Biology | issue=11 |year=2006 |pages=99–138 |url=https://www.univerlag.uni-goettingen.de/bitstream/handle/3/isbn-978-3-938616-85-7/annals%2011_DGGBT.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of his "typostrophism" (German: ''Typostrophe'') theory advocated sudden evolutionary change by macromutations but he later dropped this view. His theory of orthogenesis (guided, straight-line evolution) and eventual decay went through three stages (typogenesis [explosion of new types], typostasis [maintenance of types], and typolysis [splitting of types, degeneration]) claimed to be embedded within a cyclical view of the [[evolution]]ary process. His theory also proposed that mass [[extinction]]s, especially the ones at the end of the [[Permian]] period 225 million years ago, were the result of [[cosmic radiation]] caused by [[supernova]] explosions. Schindewolf speculated that a supernova star explosion could emit radiation lethal to organisms if close enough to earth. He proposed that the radiation from a supernova could have two effects, extinguishing many species of life and causing macromutations which in turn could cause new [[species]] to originate.&lt;ref&gt;[[David H. Levy]]. (2002). ''Shoemaker by Levy: The Man Who Made an Impact''. Princeton University Press. p. 61. {{ISBN|978-0691113258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schindewolf was the only scientist to have speculated that the first [[bird]] may have hatched from a reptile's egg.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Palmer. (2010). ''Perilous Planet Earth: Catastrophes and Catastrophism through the Ages''. Cambridge University Press. p. 99. {{ISBN|978-0521174640}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only a speculation and he abandoned the view of macromutations in later publications.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Schindewolf. (1969). ''Über den “Typus” in morphologischer und phylogenetischer Biologie''. Mainz: Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LevitOlsson2006/&gt;

His book ''Basic Questions in Paleontology'' was published in German in 1950 and was translated into English in 1993 with a foreword written by [[Stephen Jay Gould]].

The '''Plastic Disclosure Project''' (PDP) is a project working to reduce the [[environmental impact]] of the world's rising use of [[plastics]] in products and [[packaging industry|packaging]].&lt;ref name="AboutPDP"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plasticdisclosure.org/about/why-pdp.html |title= Why the Plastic Disclosure Project?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the [[Carbon Disclosure Project]], PDP encourages measurement, disclosure and management to improve corporate, community and individual accountability on plastic manufacture, use and disposal.&lt;ref name="RichardBranson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/articles/2012/06/18/richard-branson-plundering-the-new-wild-west |title = Plundering the new wild west}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="StanfordInnovation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamiltonadvisorsltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Spring_2012_Shrinking_Your_Plastic_Footprint.pdf |title=Stanford Social Innovation Review |work = Leland Stanford Jr. University |date = Spring 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
PDP was announced at the opening plenary session of the [[Clinton Global Initiative]] in 2010 as a preventative project that can help address the issue of [[plastic waste]] on a global scale.&lt;ref name="About Ocean Recovery Alliance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oceanrecov.org/about/how-it-works.html |title= About Ocean Recovery Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SustainableBrands"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sustainablebrands.com/news_and_views/new-metrics/how-transparency-plastic-use-can-benefit-companies-and-investors |title= Sustainable Brands Article}}&lt;/ref&gt; PDP is a project of [[Ocean Recovery Alliance]].

==Goals==
* Create a world where plastic can be used, but where there is no environmental impact as a result 
* Use annual reporting and measurement of production or waste creation to bring about better management
* Encourage sustainable business practices around plastic use
* Inspire improved design and innovative solutions for plastic products and packaging &lt;ref name="AboutPDP"/&gt;

==How it works==
PDP asks businesses to measure, manage, reduce and benefit from plastic waste to create a world where plastic benefits consumers and businesses without negatively impacting the environment.&lt;ref name="AboutPDP"/&gt; PDP is based on the principle that to effectively manage and improve efficiency in plastic use, reuse and [[plastic recycling|recycling]], businesses must first quantify their plastics.&lt;ref name="SustainableBrands"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Howitworks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plasticdisclosure.org/about/how-it-works.html |title= How PDP works}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual disclosure requests are sent to companies that use plastic for goods and/or services on behalf of socially conscious investors and community stakeholders.&lt;ref name="SustainableBrands"/&gt;

PDP aims to connect solution providers with prospective companies to facilitate design and innovation.&lt;ref name="Solutions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plasticdisclosure.org/solutions.html |title= Plastic Solutions}}&lt;/ref&gt; All types of organisation are invited to participate in PDP and commit to reducing their plastic footprint.&lt;ref name="AboutPDP"/&gt;

==Company disclosures==
[[Lush (company)]] became the first PDP Discloser in 2011.&lt;ref name="PDPLush"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hamiltonadvisorsltd.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/LUSH-disclosure-Plastic_Disclosure_Project_kate-2.pdf |title= Plastic Disclosure Project: Lush Cosmetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lush"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lush.co.uk/content/view/5205 |title=Lush are the first company to disclose its plastic usage! |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216035420/https://www.lush.co.uk/content/view/5205 |archivedate=2013-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 [[UC Berkeley]] became the first university to join PDP.&lt;ref name=UCBerkeley&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newscenter.berkeley.edu/2012/06/07/plastic-disclosure-project/ |title= UC Berkeley joins the PDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project will be managed by Campus Recycling and Refuse Services as well as the Office of Sustainability, and the university plans to assign interns to track plastic waste as it leaves campus. Further companies in at least a dozen countries have expressed interest in this project.&lt;ref name="SustainableBrands"/&gt;

At the [[Plasticity Forum]] Rio '12, an alliance was formed between [[Plastic Pollution Coalition]] and PDP to work with university campuses around the world to reduce their plastic footprint.&lt;ref name="PackagingEurope"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.packagingeurope.com/Packaging-Europe-News/48485/Plasticity-Rio-Showcases-Solutions-Innovations-and-Opportunities-in-the-Plastic-Industry.html |title=Plasticity Rio showcases solutions, innovations and opportunities in the plastic industry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth People,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthpeopleco.com/&lt;/ref&gt; a Dallas-based environmental consultancy, is the first consultancy to offer plastic assessment and reporting services though PDP for clients.&lt;ref name="EarthPeople"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/1/prweb9070829.htm |title= EarthPeople becomes first sustainability consultancy in the U.S. to endorse plastic disclosure project |work=PRWeb |date= 01/03/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4200">'''Reaction wood''' in a [[woody plant]] is wood that forms in place of normal wood as a response to gravity, where the cambial cells are oriented other than vertically. It is typically found on branches and leaning stems. It is an example of self optimisation and the axiom of uniform stress in trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lonsdale|first=David|title=Principles of Tree Hazard Assessment and Management|date=1999|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=0 11 753355 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jourez|first=Benoit|title=Le bois de tension: 1 Définition et distribution dans l'arbe|url=http://pressesagro.be/base/text/v1n2/100.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202052949/http://www.pressesagro.be/base/text/v1n2/100.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 December 2017|publisher=Ministère de la Région wallonne|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Progressive bending and cracking would occur in parts of the tree undergoing predominantly tensile or compressive stresses were it not for the localised production of reaction wood, which differs from ordinary wood in its mechanical properties. Reaction wood may be laid down in wider than normal annual increments, so that the cross section is often asymmetric or elliptical. The structure of cells and vessels is also different, resulting in additional strength. The effect of reaction wood is to help maintain the angle of the bent or leaning part by resisting further downward bending or failure.

There are two different types of reaction wood, which represent two different approaches to the same problem by woody [[plant]]s:
 
* In [[angiosperms]] reaction wood is called '''tension wood'''. Tension wood forms on the side of the part of the plant that is under tension, pulling it towards the affecting force (upwards, in the case of a branch). It has a higher proportion  of [[cellulose]] than normal wood. Tension wood may have as high as 60% cellulose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shigo|first=Alex|title=A new tree biology dictionary|date=1986|isbn=0-943563-05-4|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[gymnosperms]] it is called '''compression wood'''. Compression wood forms on the side of the plant that is under compression, thereby lengthening/straightening the bend. Compression wood has a higher proportion of [[lignin]] than normal wood. Compression wood has only about 30% cellulose compared to 42% in normal softwood. Its lignin content can be as high as 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shigo|first=Alex|title=A new tree biology dictionary|date=1986|isbn=0-943563-05-4|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controlling factor behind reaction wood appears to be the hormone auxin, although the exact mechanism is not clear. In a leaning stem, the normal flow of auxin down the tree is displaced by gravity and it accumulates on the lower side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Peter|title=Trees: Their Natural History|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-45963-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The formation of reaction wood may act in conjunction with other corrective or adaptive mechanisms in woody plants, such as [[thigomorphism]] (adaptive response to flexure) and [[gravitropism]] (the correction of, rather than the support of, lean) and the auxin-controlled balance of growth rates and growth direction between stems and branches. The term ‘adaptive growth' therefore includes, but is not synonymous with, the formation of reaction wood.

As a rule, reaction wood is undesirable in any structural application, primarily as its mechanical properties are different from normal wood: it alters the uniform structural properties of timber. Reaction wood can twist, cup or warp dramatically during machining.  This movement can occur during the milling process, making it occasionally dangerous to perform certain operations without appropriate safety controls in place.  For instance, ripping a piece of reaction wood on a table saw without a splitter or [[riving knife]] installed can lead to kick back of the stock.  Reaction wood also responds to moisture differently from normal wood.

The '''Southern Alps / Kā Tiritiri o te Moana''' is a [[mountain range]] extending along much of the length of New Zealand's [[South Island]], reaching its greatest elevations near the range's western side. The name "Southern Alps" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.

The range includes the South Island's '''Main Divide''', which separates the [[drainage basin|water catchment]]s of the more heavily populated eastern side of the island from those on the west coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Alan Copland|chapterurl=http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/en/1966/southern-alps/2|chapter=Topography|editor-first=A.H.|editor-last=McLintock|origyear=1966|title=Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|year=2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022051637/http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/southern-alps/2|archivedate=22 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, the Main Divide forms the boundary between the [[Marlborough, New Zealand|Marlborough]], [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] and [[Otago]] [[regions of New Zealand|regions]] to the southeast and the [[Tasman Region|Tasman]] and [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] regions to the northwest.

Its tallest peak is [[Aoraki / Mount Cook]], the highest point in New Zealand at {{convert|3724|m|ft}}. The Southern Alps include sixteen other points that exceed {{convert|3000|m|ft|}} in height (see [[List of mountains of New Zealand by height|NZ Mountains by Height]]). The mountain ranges are bisected by glacial valleys, many of which are infilled with glacial lakes on the eastern side including [[Lake Coleridge]] in the north to [[Lake Wakatipu]] in [[Otago]] in the south. According to an inventory conducted in the late 1970s, the Southern Alps contained over 3,000 [[glacier]]s larger than one hectare,&lt;ref name="Chinn"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chinn TJ |year=2001 |url=http://www.hydrologynz.org.nz/downloads/20071015-094857-JoHNZ_2001_v40_2_Chinn.pdf |title=Distribution of the glacial water resources of New Zealand |journal=Journal of Hydrology |location=New Zealand |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=139–187 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016102753/http://www.hydrologynz.org.nz/downloads/20071015-094857-JoHNZ_2001_v40_2_Chinn.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the longest of which – the [[Tasman Glacier]] – is {{convert|23.5|km|mi}} in length which has retreated from a recent maximum of {{convert|29|km|mi}} in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="glaciers"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Lambert M |year=1989 |title=Air New Zealand Almanack |location=Wellington |publisher=New Zealand Press Association |page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Glacier2017"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/environment/89403443/when-the-worlds-glaciers-shrunk-new-zealands-grew-bigger|title=When the world's glaciers shrunk, New Zealand's grew bigger|publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]]|author=Charlie Mitchell|date=15 February 2017|accessdate=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Settlements include Maruia Springs, a spa near [[Lewis Pass]], the town of [[Arthur's Pass]], and [[Mount Cook Village]].

Major crossings of the Southern Alps in the New Zealand road network include [[Lewis Pass]] [[New Zealand State Highway 7|(SH7)]], [[Arthur's Pass (mountain pass)|Arthur's Pass]] [[New Zealand State Highway 73|(SH73)]], [[Haast Pass]] [[New Zealand State Highway 6|(SH6)]], and the road to Milford Sound [[New Zealand State Highway 94|(SH94)]].

The Southern Alps were named by [[Captain Cook]] on 23 March 1770, who described their "prodigious height".&lt;ref name="Naming"&gt;{{ReedPlacenames1975}} p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; They had previously been noted by [[Abel Tasman]] in 1642, whose description of the South Island's west coast is often translated as "a land uplifted high".&lt;ref name="Tasman"&gt;Orsman, H. and Moore, J. (eds) (1988) ''Heinemann Dictionary of New Zealand Quotations'', [[Heinemann (book publisher)|Heinemann]], Page 629.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the passage of the [[Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998]], the name of the range was officially altered to Southern Alps / Kā Tiritiri o te Moana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1998/0097/10.0/DLM431335.html | title=Ngai Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998 | accessdate=30 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
New Zealand has a humid maritime, temperate climate with the Southern Alps lying perpendicular to the prevalialing westerly flow of air. Annual precipitation varies greatly across the range, from {{convert|3000|mm}} at the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]], {{convert|15000|mm}} close to the Main Divide, to {{convert|1000|mm}} {{convert|30|km}} east of the Main Divide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Willsman AP |author2=Chinn TJ |author3=Hendrikx J |author4=Lorrey A |year=2010 |url=https://www.niwa.co.nz/sites/niwa.co.nz/files/import/attachments/NIWA-New-Zealand-Glacier-Monitoring-End-of-Summer-Snowline-Survey-2010.pdf |title=New Zealand Glacier Monitoring: End of Summer Snowline Survey 2010 |location=New Zealand |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029065258/https://www.niwa.co.nz/sites/niwa.co.nz/files/import/attachments/NIWA-New-Zealand-Glacier-Monitoring-End-of-Summer-Snowline-Survey-2010.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This high precipitation aids the growth of [[glacier]]s above the [[Snow line]]. Large glaciers and snowfields can be found west of or on the Main Divide, with smaller glaciers further east (See [[Glaciers of New Zealand]]).

Because of its orientation perpendicular to the prevailing westerly winds, the range creates excellent wave soaring conditions for [[Glider aircraft|glider]] pilots. The town of [[Omarama]], in the lee of the mountains, has gained an international reputation for its gliding conditions. The prevailing westerlies also create a weather pattern known as the ''[[Nor'west arch]]'', in which moist air is pushed up over the mountains, forming an arch of cloud in an otherwise blue sky. This weather pattern is frequently visible in summer across [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]] and [[North Otago]]. The 'Nor'wester' is a [[foehn wind]] similar to the [[Chinook wind|Chinook]] of Canada, where mountain ranges in the path of prevailing moisture laden winds force air upwards, thus cooling the air and condensing the moisture to rain, producing hot dry winds in the descending air lee of the mountains.

==Geology==
[[File:Mount Cook 2.jpg|thumb|right| View of [[Mount Cook]], the highest peak, from the [[Hooker Valley Track]]]]

The Southern Alps lie along a geological [[plate boundary]], part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], with the [[Pacific Plate]] to the southeast pushing westward and colliding with the northward-moving [[Indo-Australian Plate]] to the northwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Search of Ancient New Zealand |last=Campbell |first=Hamish |authorlink= |author2=Hutching, Gerard  |year=2007 |publisher=Penguin Books, in association with GNS Science |location=North Shore and Wellington, New Zealand |isbn=978-0-143-02088-2 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last 45 million years, the collision has pushed up a 20&amp;nbsp;km thickness of rocks on the Pacific Plate to form the Alps, although much of this has been eroded away. Uplift has been most rapid during the last 5&amp;nbsp;million years, and the mountains continue to be raised today by [[tectonics|tectonic]] pressure, causing earthquakes on the [[Alpine Fault]] and other nearby faults. Despite the substantial uplift, most of the relative motion along the Alpine Fault is [[Fault (geology)#Strike-slip faults|transverse]], not [[Fault (geology)#Dip-slip faults|vertical]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Search of Ancient New Zealand |last=Campbell |first=Hamish |authorlink= |author2=Hutching, Gerard  |year=2007 |publisher=Penguin Books, in association with GNS Science |location=North Shore and Wellington, New Zealand |isbn=978-0-143-02088-2 |pages=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, significant dip-slip occurs on the plate boundary to the north and east of the North Island, in the [[Hikurangi Trench]] and [[Kermadec Trench]]. The transfer of motion from strike-slip on the Alpine Fault to dip-slip motion at these subduction zones to the north creates the [[Marlborough Fault System]], which has resulted in significant uplift in the region.

In 2017 a large international team of scientists reported they had discovered beneath [[Whataroa]], a small township on the Alpine Fault, "extreme" hydrothermal activity which "could be commercially very significant".&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, R., Townend, J., Toy, V., Upton, P., Coussens, J., and 61 other (2017) [https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature22355.html "Extreme hydrothermal conditions at an active plate-bounding fault"]. Letter to ''Nature''. {{doi|10.1038/nature22355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.odt.co.nz/regions/west-coast/geothermal-discovery-west-coast Geothermal discovery on West Coast] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180314174145/https://www.odt.co.nz/regions/west-coast/geothermal-discovery-west-coast |date=14 March 2018 }} ''Otago Daily Times'', 18 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The mountains are rich in flora with about 25% of the country's plant species being found above the treeline in [[alpine plant]] habitats and grassland with [[mountain beech]] forest at lower elevations (of the eastern side but not in [[Westland District|Westland]]). The cold windswept slopes above the treeline are covered with areas of [[fellfield]]. To the east, the Alps descend to the [[Canterbury-Otago tussock grasslands|high grasslands of Canterbury and Otago]]. Plants adapted to the alpine conditions include woody shrubs like ''[[Hebe (plant)|Hebe]]'', ''[[Dracophyllum]]'', and ''[[Coprosma]]'', the conifer [[Podocarpus nivalis|snow totara]] ''(Podocarpus nivalis)'' and ''[[Carex]]'' sedge grasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa1003|name=South Island montane grasslands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
Wildlife of the mountains includes the endemic [[New Zealand rockwren|rock wren]] ''(Xenicus gilviventris)'' and the [[kea]], a large parrot that was once hunted as a pest. There are also a number of endemic insects adapted to these high altitudes especially flies, moths, beetles, and bees. The beech forests of the lower elevations are important habitat for two birds; the [[great spotted kiwi]] ''(Apteryx haastii)'' and the South Island [[New Zealand kaka|kaka]] ''(Nestor meridionalis meridionalis)''.

==Threats and preservation==
The mountains are inaccessible and retain their natural vegetation. A large proportion of the range is well protected as part of various national parks, notably the [[Westland Tai Poutini National Park]], [[Mount Aspiring National Park]], and [[Aoraki/Mount Cook National Park]] or [[Protected areas of New Zealand|protected areas]] such as [[Lake Sumner Forest Park]]. Indigenous plant life is affected by introduced animals such as [[red deer]] (''Cervus elaphus''), [[chamois]] (''Rupicapra rupicapra''), and [[Himalayan tahr]] (''Hemitragus jemlahicus'') all of which have at times been targeted for culling, while the birds and reptiles are vulnerable to introduced predators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2173">The '''Southern Korea evergreen forests''' [[ecoregion]], within the  [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests]] [[Biome]], is at the southern end of the [[Korean Peninsula]].

==Setting==
The Southern Korea evergreen forests occupy an area of {{convert|14700|km2|sqmi}} in [[South Korea]], at the southern margin of the Korean Peninsula, as well as the [[Gotjawal Forest]] on [[Jeju Island]] in the [[East China Sea]], 60&amp;nbsp;km from the Korean coast.&lt;ref name=wwf&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=pa0439|name=Southern Korea evergreen forests|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The climate is humid and temperate. Rainfall averages 1000&amp;nbsp;mm per year, with two-thirds falling between June and September. Winters are drier and mild, with a mean January temperate of 2 °C. There are occasional winter snowfalls, but snow rarely accumulates.&lt;ref name=wwf/&gt;
==Flora==
The natural vegetation is evergreen broadleaf [[laurel forest]], with members of the oak family ''([[Castanopsis cuspidata]]'', ''[[Quercus acuta]]'', and ''[[Quercus myrsinifolia]])'' and laurel family ''([[Persea thunbergii]],'' ''[[Cinnamomum camphora]]'', and others) prominent. Other trees and shrubs include ''[[Carpinus laxiflora]], [[Elaeocarpus]], [[Neolitsea]], [[Daphniphyllum macropodum]], [[Ilex integra]], [[Hedera]], [[Eurya japonica]], [[Pittosporum tobira]],'' and ''[[Viburnum awabuki]]''.&lt;ref name=wwf/&gt;

The [[Bijarim forest]] on Jeju is home to dense groves of ''Bija'' (Nutmeg or Nutmeg yew, ''[[Torreya nucifera]])".

==Conservation==
The forests are mostly gone, replaced by intensive agriculture. Enclaves exist in the Ulsan, Hampyeong, and Naejang-san national monuments, and on Jeju.

The ecoregion is home to four national parks, [[Dadohaehaesang National Park|Dadohaehaesang]], [[Hallyeohaesang National Park|Hallyeohaesang]], and [[Wolchulsan National Park|Wolchulsan]] on the mainland, and  [[Hallasan National Park|Hallasan]] on Jeju.

'''Southwest Australia savanna''' is an [[ecoregion]] in [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan &amp; World Wildlife Fund. 2012.[http://www.eoearth.org/article/Southwest_Australia_savanna?topic=49597 Southwest Australia savanna]. ed. P.Saundry. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and description==
This dry region is a belt between the [[Mediterranean climate]] of the southwest corner and the [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] [[sand plains]] inland and to the north. Much of the area is now converted to wheat growing. The latitude of this region is 8° to 20° on the equator.

==Flora==
Part of the [[biodiversity hotspot]] of [[Southwest Australia]], this region has been defined by the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and contains the [[Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia]] (IBRA) regions of the [[Geraldton Sandplains]], [[Avon Wheatbelt]], and [[Yalgoo (biogeographic region)|Yalgoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=aa1209|name=Southwest Australia savanna}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original [[habitat]] consists of [[savanna]] dotted with [[eucalyptus]] [[woodland]], [[Mallee Woodlands and Shrublands|mallee woodlands and shrublands]] and [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]. Although in the more [[fertile]] southern areas this has now mostly been converted to wheat fields more original savanna remains in the north of the region where there are more [[acacia]] trees than eucalyptus.  Plants of the region include many [[wildflowers]] and trees including the scented [[Acacia rostellifera]]. The best-preserved area of original habitat is found in and around the multi-colored sandstone gorges of [[Kalbarri National Park]] on the [[Murchison River (Western Australia)|Murchison River]].

==Fauna==
Birds of the area include the [[emu]], although this has been hunted as a pest by the wheat-growing community, and the honey-eating [[western spinebill]]. Mammals include the [[honey possum]] and the southwestern pygmy Possum, both of which feed on nectar from the wildflowers.

'''The Uzbekistan State Museum of Nature''' is the oldest museum operating in [[Uzbekistan]].{{cn|date=January 2018}} The museum's main purpose is to show the natural beauty of Uzbekistan and to help protect its environment. The museum features chronologically-ordered exhibits and seeks to educate visitors about Uzbekistan's geography through time.  

== Contents ==
The Museum consists of about four hundred thousand specimens and artefacts that are on display. Three hundred thousand items are insects. Eleven thousand are [[herbarium]] leaves and other zoological and geological materials. The museum is visited mainly by Uzbeks and visitors from formerly-[[Soviet Union]] countries. 

The four areas in the museum are geological-geographic department, flora and fauna department, scientific department and funds department.

The museum organizes many social events in Tashkent, including assemblies in many of the Republic's schools, academic lyceums, colleges and higher education facilities.

== History ==
[[File:Ferula assa-foetida (Uzbekistan) 1.jpg|thumb|Flora and nature of Uzbekistan]]
The Museum is the oldest in Uzbekistan. It was established in Tashkent by Russian scientists on July 12, 1876, as the Tashkent Museum. The museum closed and re-opened several times. In 1919, it opened as Turkestan National Museum. Two years later, in 1921, it became The State Museum of Nature of Uzbekistan. In 1930, the museum joined with the agricultural museum and became the "Central Asian Museum of Nature and Building Power". Five years later the museum took its current name. In 1937, the museum opened a classroom for students to receive lectures on Uzbekistan nature.
[[File:Trapelus sanguinolenta UZB.jpg|thumb|Fauna and Nature of Uzbekistan]]

The museum has received many government awards for its contribution to the development of the academic sphere in Uzbekistan. In 1967, the museum was awarded "Uzbekistan's Best Museum". In 2006, the museum celebrated its 130-year anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookinguz.com/143-all/uzbekistan/cities/tashkent/museums/270-the-state-museum-of-uzbekistan-nature Stat Museum of Nature of Uzbekistan] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centralasia-travel.com/ru/countries/uzbekistan/sights/museum_of_nature Museum of Nature] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

They form a subgroup under the quark star category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alcock|first=Charles|last2=Farhi|first2=Edward|last3=Olinto|first3=Angela|date=1986|title=Strange stars|url=http://inspirehep.net/record/226889|journal=Astrophys.

Astrophys.|language=en|volume=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Weber/&gt;

Strange stars might exist without regard of the Bodmer–Witten assumption of stability at near-zero temperatures and pressures, as strange quark matter might form and remain stable at the core of [[neutron star]]s, in the same way as ordinary quark matter could.&lt;ref name=Shapiro/&gt; Such strange stars will naturally have a crust layer of neutron star material. The depth of the crust layer will depend on the physical conditions and circumstances of the entire star and on the properties of strange quark matter in general.&lt;ref name=glendenning/&gt; Stars partially made up of quark matter (including strange quark matter) are also referred to as hybrid stars.&lt;ref name=alford/&gt;&lt;ref name=goyal/&gt;&lt;ref name=benic/&gt;&lt;ref name=a-c/&gt;

This theoretical strange star crust is proposed to be a possible reason behind the ever mysterious [[fast radio burst]]s (FRBs). While this is of course still theoretical; there is good evidence the researchers from this paper provide that point to the collapse of these strange star crusts to be a possible FRB point of origin.

For said crust to collapse from a strange star it must accrete matter from its environment in some form. This release of even small amounts of its matter cause a cascading effect on the stars crust. Which is thought to result in a massive release of magnetic energy as well as electron and positron pairs; in the initial first stages of the collapsing stage.  This release of high energy particles and magnetic energy in such a short period of time causes the newly released electron/positron pairs to be directed towards the poles of the strange star due to the increased magnetic energy created by the initial secretion of the strange stars matter. Once these electron/positron pairs are directed to the poles they are then ejected at relativistic velocities, which is then believed to be one of the causes to what astronomers in the past 11 years of observing this phenomenon known as FRBs could be.

Theoretical investigations have revealed that quark stars might not only be produced from neutron stars and powerful [[supernova]]e, they could also be created in the early [[Chronology of the universe#Hadron epoch|cosmic phase separations]] following the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name=Witten/&gt; If these primordial quark stars transform into strange quark matter before the external temperature and pressure conditions of the [[early universe]] makes them unstable, they might turn out stable, if the Bodmer–Witten assumption holds true. Such primordial strange stars could survive to this day.&lt;ref name=Witten/&gt;

==Characteristics==
Recent theoretical research has found mechanisms by which quark stars with "[[strange quark nugget]]s" may decrease the objects' electric fields and densities from previous theoretical expectations, causing such stars to appear very much like—nearly indistinguishable from—ordinary neutron stars. This suggests that many, or even all, known neutron stars might in fact be strange stars. However, the investigating team of Prashanth Jaikumar, Sanjay Reddy, and Andrew W. Steiner made some fundamental assumptions that led to uncertainties in their results large enough that the case is not finally settled. More research, both observational and theoretical, remains to be done on strange stars in the future.&lt;ref name=prashanth/&gt;

Other theoretical work contends that: "A sharp interface between quark matter and the vacuum would have very different properties from the surface of a neutron star"; and, addressing key parameters like [[surface tension]] and [[electrical force]]s that were neglected in the original study, the results show that as long as the surface tension is below a low critical value, the large [[strangelet]]s are indeed unstable to fragmentation and strange stars naturally come with complex strangelet crusts, analogous to those of neutron stars.&lt;ref name=rajagopal/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7157">[[Image:Las sosnowy swiezy02.jpg|thumb|A [[pine]] forest is an example of a temperate coniferous forest]]
'''Temperate coniferous forest''' is a [[terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] [[biome]] found in [[temperate climate]] regions of the world with warm [[summer]]s and cool [[winter]]s and adequate [[rain]]fall to sustain a [[forest]]. In most temperate coniferous forests, evergreen [[conifer]]s predominate, while some are a mix of conifers and broadleaf [[evergreen]] trees and/or broadleaf [[deciduous]] [[tree]]s. Temperate evergreen forests are common in the United States of America, areas of regions that have mild winters and heavy rainfall, or inland in drier [[climate]]s or [[mountain]] areas. Temperate coniferous forests are found mainly in the Northern Hemisphere in North America, Europe, and Asia, but some are found in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldwildlife.org/biomes/temperate-coniferous-forest|title=Temperate Coniferous Forest|publisher=WWF}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A separate ecoregion, the [[tropical coniferous forest]]s, occurs in more tropical climates.

Structurally, these forests are rather simple, generally consisting of two layers: an overstory and understory. Some forests may support an intermediate layer of shrubs. [[Pine]] forests support a herbaceous understory that is generally dominated by [[grass]]es and herbaceous perennials, and are often subject to ecologically important [[wildfire]]s. Many species of tree inhabit these forests including [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[Cupressaceae|cypress]], [[Douglas fir]], [[fir]], [[juniper]], [[pine]], [[podocarpus]], [[spruce]], [[Sequoioideae|redwood]] and [[Taxaceae|yew]]. The understory also contains a wide variety of herbaceous and [[shrub]] species.

==Species==

Temperate coniferous forests around the world sustain the highest levels of biomass in any terrestrial biome and are notable for trees of massive proportions, including [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwood]] (''Sequoia sempervirens''), [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoia]] (''Sequoiadendron giganteum''), [[Douglas fir]] (''Pseudotsuga menziesii''), [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] (''Picea sitchensis''), [[Fitzroya cupressoides|Alerce]] (''Fitzroya cupressoides'') and [[Agathis|kauri]] (''Agathis australis''). These forests are quite rare, occurring in small areas of [[North America]], southwestern South America, some mountainous regions of Eurasia, and northern New Zealand. The [[Klamath-Siskiyou forests]] of northwestern [[California]] and southwestern [[Oregon]] are known for their rich variety of plant and animal species, including many endemic species.&lt;ref&gt;

In Russia, a coniferous forest, specifically pine or spruce forest is known as bor ({{lang-ru|бор}}). Bors typically grow on well-drained sandy soils, sandy clay soils and mild [[loam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://forest.geoman.ru/forest/item/f00/s00/e0000268/index.shtml|title=Бор|work=Лесная энциклопедия|editor=Воробьев Г.И.|publisher=Советская энциклопедия| language=Russian|year=1985| accessdate =1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of several Russian historical buildings and localities refer to the word "bor" as the original place where they were built, such as [[Borovitskaya Tower]] or [[Church of the Savior on Bor]].

The first '''USS ''Relief''''' was a [[auxiliary ship|supply ship]] in the [[United States Navy]].

''Relief'' was laid down in 1835 at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]] and launched on 14 September 1836. Designed by [[Samuel Humphreys]], she was built along merchant vessel lines and included trysail mast and gaffsail on all three masts to enable her to work to windward in strong winds. Her hull was pierced for 16 small guns, but she usually carried only four to six 18-pounder and two 12-pounders.

==Service history==

===United States exploring expedition===
In early December 1836, ''Relief'', commanded by Lieutenant [[Thomas A. Dornin]], left [[Philadelphia]] for [[Norfolk, Virginia]] to join the ships assigned to the [[United States Exploring Expedition|United States South Sea Surveying and Exploring Expedition]]. However, that expedition, held up by lack of money, ships, equipment, and trained personnel—and by administrative feuding since its first authorization in 1828—continued to be delayed until the summer of 1838. During her 19-month wait, ''Relief'' remained at Norfolk or engaged in runs along the east coast.

On 19 August 1838, the squadron, commanded by Lt. [[Charles Wilkes]], cleared [[Hampton Roads]] and set a course for [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Sailing with the prevailing winds—westerlies and northeast trades—their planned course took them across the Atlantic to [[Madeira]]; then straight to [[Brazil]]. However, ''Relief'', under Lt. [[A. K. Long]], proved to be a slow sailer. She soon fell behind and was detached with orders to rejoin the other five vessels in the [[Cape Verde Islands]]. The rendezvous was accomplished in early October and the squadron sailed for Brazil. ''Relief'', the last to arrive, reached Rio on 26 November.

On 6 January 1839, the squadron sailed for the [[Río Negro (Argentina)|Río Negro]] and [[Cape Horn]]. ''Relief'', bypassing the former where surveys were conducted, rounded the Cape and reached [[Orange Harbor]], on the [[Hardy Peninsula]], [[Hoste Island]], on the 30th. There for almost three weeks, her crew kept hourly registers of the tides, placed navigation lights, and cut wood. On 18 February, the others arrived and toward the end of the month they were dispersed on various missions. Two followed [[James Weddell]]'s course to [[Antarctica]]; others traced [[James Cook]]'s path. ''Relief'' was ordered north to the [[Straits of Magellan]], via the [[Cockburn Channel]], to survey harbors in the straits. Caught in storms, however, she was unable to penetrate the channel and, in mid-March, was almost wrecked off [[Noir Island]]. The loss of her anchor during her battle with the sea off Noir, prohibited further attempts to enter the channel and she headed for [[Valparaíso]].

On 15 April she entered the anchorage to make repairs and await the remainder of the squadron which by mid-May was reunited. In June, they moved on to [[Callao]], where the ships were refitted and replenished. When ''Relief'' was unloaded and smoked, her dead rats filled three barrels.

Because of her slowness, ''Relief'' was ordered to proceed from Callao to [[Sydney]], then sail home—carrying the sick and malcontents with her. Sailing in mid-July, she spent two weeks in the Sandwich Islands ([[Hawaiian Islands]]) and three months after leaving [[Peru]], put into Sydney. She discharged her remaining cargo, took on water, wood, and rock ballast and headed east. En route home, she again doubled Cape Horn and on 28 March 1840 she reached [[New York City|New York]].

===Further service===
At the end of the year, ''Relief'', repaired and overhauled, sailed again for the [[Pacific]], where she remained for five years operating primarily off the west coast of [[South America]]. She returned to New York in April 1846. In May, [[Mexican–American War|war]] with [[Mexico]] broke out; and, in July, ''Relief'' joined the [[Home Squadron]]. From then until June 1848, she cruised in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], attempting to maintain a steady supply line to the ships engaged in the blockade of the Mexican coast despite the distance to supply bases and the scarcity of ships of her type.

In July 1848, ''Relief'' returned to New York and in the fall sailed from Norfolk for the [[Brazil Station]]. The following spring, she was back at Norfolk, but, with the autumn, she headed east. She operated in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] until she returned to the United States in July 1850, and engaged in resupply runs to Brazil until placed out of commission for overhaul 20 November 1855. She recommissioned 19 February 1856 and resumed her runs to the Brazil Station and continued them through 1857.

In late 1858 she rejoined the Home Squadron and cruised in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1861, she crossed the Atlantic again, resupplied the [[African Squadron]] and, with the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], returned to the United States to resupply the ships of the [[South Atlantic Blockading Squadron]]. In July 1862, she returned to the Gulf of Mexico and, until the fall of 1863, served primarily as station store ship at [[Ship Island]] in [[Mississippi Sound]].

Then ordered to [[Boston, Massachusetts]] for overhaul, she was decommissioned 5 December 1863. Recommissioned 29 April 1864, she was ordered back to the Pacific. In July she delivered supplies at Rio de Janeiro, whence she continued on to [[China]], arriving at the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] colony of [[Macau]] in December. After service on the [[Asiatic Station]], she returned to New York in late 1866 and was placed in ordinary. In 1871 she was ordered to [[Washington, D.C.]], where she served as [[receiving ship]] until 1877. The following year she was laid up, at Washington, and on 27 September 1883 she was sold to [[J. B. Agnew]].

A '''volcanic plateau''' is a [[plateau]] produced by [[volcanic activity]]. There are two main types: lava plateaus and pyroclastic plateaus.

== Lava plateau ==
[[File:Pajarito Plateau.jpg|thumb|350px|The [[Pajarito Plateau]] in New Mexico, USA is an example of a volcanic plateau]]Lava plateaus are formed by highly fluid (runny) [[basaltic]] lava during numerous successive eruptions through numerous vents without violent explosions (quiet eruptions). These eruptions are quiet because of low viscosity of  lava, so that it is very fluid and contains a small amount of trapped gases. The resulting sheet lava flows may be extruded from linear [[fissure vent|fissures]] or [[rift]]s or gigantic volcanic eruptions through multiple vents characteristic of the prehistoric era which produced giant [[flood basalt]]s. Multiple successive and extensive [[lava flow]]s cover the original landscape to eventually form a plateau, which may contain [[lava field]]s, [[cinder cone]]s, [[shield volcanoes]] and other [[:Category:Volcanic landforms|volcanic landforms]]. In some cases, a lava plateau may be part of a single volcano. An example is the massive [[Level Mountain]] [[shield volcano]] in northern [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], which covers an area of {{Convert|1800|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} and a volume of {{Convert|860|km3|mi3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Charles A.|author2=Kienle, Jürgen |page=121|title=Volcanoes of North America: United States and Canada|year=2001|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=[[Cambridge]], [[England]]|isbn=978-0-521-43811-7|oclc=27910629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most extensive of all the [[subaerial]] basaltic plateaus existed during the [[Paleogene]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/61005289/ABSTRACT Brittle tectonism in relation to the Palaeogene evolution of the Thulean/NE Atlantic domain: a study in Ulster] Retrieved on 2007-11-10&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly extended over {{convert|1,800,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of the northern [[Atlantic Ocean]] region. This region, known as the [[Thulean Plateau]], is generally believed to have been broken up by foundering of the Earth's crust to form the present [[oceanic basin|ocean basin]].

The Earth features numerous subaerial and [[submarine volcano|submarine]] volcanic plateaus such as the [[Columbia River Plateau]] (subaerial) and the vast [[Ontong Java Plateau]] (submarine).

== Pyroclastic plateau ==

Pyroclastic plateaus are produced by massive [[pyroclastic flows]] and they are underlain by [[pyroclastic rock]]s: [[agglomerate]]s, [[tephra]], [[volcanic ash]]es cemented into [[tuff]]s, [[mafic]] or [[felsic]].

Examples include [[Shirasu-Daichi]] which covers almost all of Southern [[Kyūshū]], [[Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glgarcs.rgr.jp/intro/kys.html|title=Kyushu -- GLGArcs|website=www.glgarcs.rgr.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[North Island Volcanic Plateau]] in [[New Zealand]].
