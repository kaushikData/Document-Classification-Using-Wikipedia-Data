== Biography ==
In 2010, when 18 and known as Ambra Battilana, she attended a [[Silvio Berlusconi prostitute trial|bunga bunga party]] associated with [[Silvio Berlusconi]] after she was spotted in a beauty contest and told she would be guaranteed a well-paid job as a weather girl for attending. She demanded to leave immediately once she realized that there were underage girls being used as prostitutes. She reported her experience to Italian [[magistrate]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/silvio-berlusconi/8448295/Silvio-Berlusconi-encouraged-indecent-game-at-bunga-bunga-party.html|title=Silvio Berlusconi 'encouraged indecent game at bunga-bunga party'|last=Squires|first=Nick|date=2011-04-13|access-date=2018-01-07|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutierrez was widely covered by the news after she alleged that [[Harvey Weinstein]] sexually assaulted her in 2015 while they were reviewing her portfolio. She said she barely spoke English at the time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-secret-settlements|title=Harvey Weinstein’s Secret Settlements|last=Farrow|first=Ronan|date=2017-11-21|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-01-07|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt; She filed a police report that night, and the next day wore a wire while speaking with Weinstein. In the recording, he repeatedly asks her to come into his room while Gutierrez says things like, "I want to leave," "I don’t want to," and "I want to go downstairs." When she asked why he tried to assault her the day before, he said, "Oh, please, I’m sorry, just come on in," continuing, "I’m used to that. Come on. Please." When Gutierrez asks if he's used to groping people against their will, he responded with, "Yes." When asked why he grabbed her breast against her will, he said, "I won’t do it again." The recording has since been made public.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Despite the audio confession, the District Attorney [[Cyrus Vance Jr.|Cyrus Vance, Jr.]] decided not to press charges due to lack of evidence. In the following months, Gutierrez received widespread negative press in tabloids including several stories from "anonymous sources" in the [[New York Post]] following the incident after the recording was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-the-gossip-media-smeared-weinstein-accuser-ambra-battilana-gutierrez_us_59dd20b7e4b0b26332e75015|title=How Gossip Media Smeared Weinstein Accuser Ambra Battilana Gutierrez|last=Amatulli|first=Jenna|date=2017-10-10|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stopped receiving modeling jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/confidential/ambra-battilana-gutierrez-weighted-harvey-weinstein-justice-article-1.3583261|title=Ambra Battilana Gutierrez 'weighted' for Harvey Weinstein justice|work=NY Daily News|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutierrez eventually signed a strict [[Non-disclosure agreement|NDA]] with Weinstein, though she's stated she didn't really understand what she was signing at the time, and was trying to protect herself and her family from Weinstein since no one believed her.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Archstone Pictures has purchased the rights to depict Guiterrez's life story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/archstone-pictures-acquires-rights-to-life-story-of-ambra-battilana-300274438.html|title=Archstone Pictures Acquires Rights To Life Story Of Ambra Battilana|last=Pictures|first=Archstone|website=www.prnewswire.com|access-date=2018-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1807">The '''''ars dictaminis''''' was the medieval description of the art of prose composition, and more specifically of the writing of letters (''dictamen''). It is closely linked to the '''''ars dictandi''''', covering the composition of documents other than letters. The standing assumption was that these writings would be composed in [[Latin]], and according to well worked-out models. This made the arts of composition a subfield of [[rhetoric]].

In business letters, it called for some form of address (e.g., “Worshipful master”); salutation (“I greet you well”); notification (“May it please you to know”); exposition (“the wool was shipped”); disposition (“and I want my money”); and valediction (“May God keep you well, at least until my bill is paid”). Clerks and scribes wrote the letters based on those rules.

Important figures in the development of Latin letter writing and document composition include [[Albericus Cassinensis]], his critic Adalbert of Samaria (''Praecepta Dictaminum'', c. 1120), and [[Lawrence of Aquilegia]].

The '''B. F. Keith Circuit''' was a chain of [[vaudeville theater]]s in the United States and Canada owned by [[Benjamin Franklin Keith]] for the acts that he booked.

==History==
In 1928 the theaters owned by [[Benjamin Franklin Keith]] and [[Edward Franklin Albee II]] and [[Martin Beck]]'s [[Orpheum Circuit]] merged to form the [[Keith-Albee-Orpheum]] circuit. The combined theater chain now had over 700 theaters in the United States and Canada. They had a combined seating capacity 1.5 million. 15,000 vaudeville performers will be booked through the new entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=700 Theatres Merged In Vaudeville Circuit.

'''Chungmuro''' refers to an avenue 1.75&amp;nbsp;km in length and 10-20 m in width and the area nearby, located in [[Jung-gu, Seoul|Jung-gu]], central [[Seoul]] of [[South Korea]]. Since the 1960s, Chungmuro has been known as the street of [[Culture of South Korea|culture]], artists, and the [[Cinema of South Korea|film]] industry. [[Dansungsa]], the first movie theater of Korea, established in 1907, is also situated in the area, then known by its Japanese name, Honmachi.&lt;ref name="encyber"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?148827&amp;contentno=148827 |script-title=ko:충무로 忠武路 |publisher=[[Doosan Encyclopedia]] |language=Korean |accessdate=2008-05-07 }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1974, [[Jongno 3-ga Station]] has become the nearest station around.&lt;ref name="KTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/art/2008/04/203_12165.html |title=Chungmuro Celebrates Soul of Korean Cinema|publisher=[[Korea Times]]|accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chungmuro was named after Chungmugong, the posthumous title of Korean Admiral [[Yi Sun-shin]], which means "martial subject of loyalty."

==History==
During Japanese rule in Korea, Chungmuro was known as "Honmachi".

Nowadays many film studios moved from Chungmuro to the [[Gangnam district]], Chungmuro still symbolizes the South Korean film industry and continues to be used as a [[metonymy|metonym]] for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=37704 |title=Sympathy for Lady Vengeance review |publisher=Cine 21 / [[UCLA|UCLA Asia Institute]] |issue=513 |date=2005-08-01 |author=Soyoung Kim |others=Hyongshin Kim (trans.) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216180028/http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=37704 |archivedate=2007-02-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''City Lore: the New York Center for Urban Culture''' was founded in 1986 and was the first organization in the United States devoted expressly to the "documentation, preservation, and presentation of urban folk culture."&lt;ref&gt;''American Folklore: An Encyclopedia''. [[Jan Harold Brunvand|Brunvand, Jan Harold]], ed. Garland Publishing, NY, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Their mission is to produce programs and publications that convey the richness of New York City—and America's—living cultural heritage. In addition to regular programming that includes the Place Matters Awards and the People's Hall of Fame, the organization works with a wide range of partners to develop exhibitions, publications, and documentary films, and to advocate for the rights of street performers, ethnic clubs, and other grassroots cultural expressions in New York City. City Lore works in four cultural domains: urban folklore and history, preservation, arts in education, and grassroots poetry traditions. Described by Sonnet Takahisa of the September 11th Memorial Museum as "wise renegades," their programs include People's Poetry Project, Place Matters (in collaboration with the Municipal Arts Society) and City of Memory. 

City Lore works collaboratively with folk and community artists, embracing different aesthetics for the creation of art. Their collaborators include the [[Gotham Center for New York City History]], the [[New-York Historical Society]], [[Bank Street College of Education]], and smaller groups such as Los Pleneros de la 21. City Lore’s staff consists of professional [[folklorists]] ([[Steve Zeitlin]], the founder and executive director, Elena Martínez and Amanda Dargan), [[historians]] (Marci Reaven), [[photographers]] ([[Martha Cooper]]), [[ethnomusicologists]] (Roberta Singer and Lois Wilcken), and arts and education specialists (Anika Selhorst).

== Projects and programs ==

=== Urban folklore ===

The City Lore office on [[First Avenue (Manhattan)|First Avenue]] on the [[Lower East Side]] houses archives containing over 100,000 images, hundreds of oral histories, and traditional music and poetry performance tapes.&lt;ref&gt;Mooney, Jake. [http://www.localprojects.net/lpV2/media/press/CofM_NYTIMES.pdf "Their New York, Lost and Sometimes Found"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119110402/http://localprojects.net/lpV2/media/press/CofM_NYTIMES.pdf |date=2008-11-19 }} ''New York Times'', 8 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The archives are part of the ongoing documentation project featured on City of Memory, a participatory online story map of [[New York City]].   

City Lore's People's Hall of Fame, established in 1993, honors grassroots contributions to New York's cultural life and presents winners with a plate-sized bronze version of the New York City subway token. Recipients have included the Pearls of Wisdom Storytellers, Peter Benfaremo ("The Lemon Ice King of Corona"), Jim Power ("New York's Mosaic Man"),&lt;ref&gt;Moynihan, Colin. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/jobs/with-few-luxuries-an-artist-sticks-to-it.html "With Few Luxuries, an Artist Sticks to It"] ''New York Times'' 12 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and Renee Flowers (original member of the Gowanus Wildcats Girls Drill Team). 

City Lore created ''Know Your Rights!'', a guide for street performers. 

=== Place Matters ===

Since its inception, City Lore has served as an advocate for local landmarks through the Place Matters program in collaboration with Municipal Arts Society. There have been over 650 nominations from the public, including parks, historic sites, public art, beer gardens, industrial sites, and stores. In 2001, they successfully nominated [[Bohemian Citizens' Benevolent Society|Bohemian Hall]], still a vibrant community center/beer garden started by Czech immigrants in Astoria, Queens, and the [[Casa Amadeo, antigua Casa Hernandez|Casa Amadeo]] Music Store, the oldest, continuously occupied Latin music store in New York City, as census sites to the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The organization has funding from the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] government for an outdoor exhibit in Lower Manhattan commemorating the Quadricentennial of [[Henry Hudson]]'s voyage with signage marking key sites in [[New Amsterdam]].

In 2006, City Lore published ''Hidden New York: A Guide to Places that Matter''.

=== Arts in Education ===

City Lore develops and implements arts residencies and offers professional development to New York City public schools.  In response to requests of public school teachers with increasing [[Bengali people|Bengali]] and [[Bangladesh]]i populations, the organization designed artist residencies in [[Queens]], funded by the [[United States Department of Education]] to teach traditional Bengali scroll painting. City Lore has designed similar programs bringing [[Mexican people|Mexican]], [[Ecuadorian people|Ecuadorian]], [[Egyptians|Egyptian]], [[Côte d'Ivoire|Ivorian]], [[Cubans|Cuban]], [[Haitians|Haitian]], [[Peruvian people|Peruvian]], [[South African]], and [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] artists into the schools. 

=== People's Poetry Project ===

In the aftermath of [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], City Lore found and collected anonymous poems and other writings that had been left at memorials, hospitals and gathering places throughout the city. A selection of these anonymous poems was published in the book, ''Words In Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam''.&lt;ref name="wiyf"&gt;Aptowicz, Cristin O'Keefe. (2008). ''Words in Your Face: A Guided Tour Through Twenty Years of the New York City Poetry Slam.'' New York City: Soft Skull Press, 288. {{ISBN|1-933368-82-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and appeared in Steve Zeitlin's essay, "Oh Did You See the Ashes Come Thickly Falling Down.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitlin, Steve. "Oh Did You See the Ashes Come Thickly Falling Down." ''Spontaneous Shrines and the Public Memorialization of Death''. Ed. Jack Santino.New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

Founded by City Lore and [[Poets House]] in 1999, The People's Poetry Gathering was created to present the diverse oral poetry traditions of New York City. In 2003, City Lore's People's Poetry Project launched an initiative to document and disseminate poetry from [[endangered languages]]. 

=== Special projects ===

City Lore produces [[documentary film]]s and collaborates with filmmakers whose work relates to the organization's mission. Sponsored films include [[Ric Burns]]' ''Coney Island'' and the five-part series ''[[New York: A Documentary Film]]''; ''City of Dreams'', a film about women artists in New York City; ''From Mambo to Hip Hop'',&lt;ref&gt;Pareles, John. [https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/arts/television/14pare.html?scp=1&amp;sq=mambo%20and%20hip-hop&amp;st=cse "Mambo and Hip-Hop: Two Bronx Sounds, One Sense of Dignity"]. ''New York Times'' 14 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; a documentary which traces the history of music in the [[South Bronx]]; and the forthcoming ''DeAf Jam'', which highlights the poetry and storytelling of the deaf performed in [[American Sign Language]].    

City Lore developed the traveling exhibit Weavings of War, which featured the work of women textile artists from [[Central Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]], [[Latin America]], and [[South Africa]]. 

Funds were raised by City Lore to support Peter Siegel's project to restore and issue tapes he made in the 1960s of folk music concerts by [[Mississippi John Hurt]], [[The Carter Family]], [[Jesse Fuller]], [[Bill Monroe]], and others. The recordings became the box set ''Friends of Old Time Music'' released by [[Smithsonian Folkways]] in 2006 &lt;ref&gt;Ratliff, Ben.

The '''comedy of manners''' is a form of [[comedy]] that satirizes the manners and affectations of contemporary society and questions societal standards. Social class stereotypes are often represented through [[stock characters]] such as the ''[[miles gloriosus]]'' ("boastful soldier") in [[ancient Greek comedy]] or the [[fop]] and [[rake (character)|rake]] of English [[Restoration comedy]], which is sometimes used as a synonym for "comedy of manners".&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, Arthur 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=TD8xG2Jnc10C&amp;pg=PA149 ''British dramatists from Dryden to Sheridan''] p.149&lt;/ref&gt; A comedy of manners often sacrifices the plot, which usually centers on some scandal, to witty dialogue and sharp social commentary. [[Oscar Wilde]]'s play, ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' (1895), which satirized the [[Victorian morality]] of the time, is one of the best-known plays of this genre.

The comedy of manners was first developed in the [[New Comedy]] period of [[ancient Greek comedy]] and is known today primarily from fragments of writings by the Greek playwright [[Menander]]. Menander's style, elaborate plots, and stock characters were imitated by the [[Theatre of ancient Rome|ancient Roman playwrights]], such as [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]], whose comedies were in turn widely known and reproduced during the [[Renaissance]]. Some of the best-known comedies of manners are those by the 17th-century French playwright [[Molière]], who satirized the hypocrisy and pretension of the ''[[ancien régime]]'' in plays such as ''[[L'École des femmes]]'' ([''The School for Wives''], 1662), ''[[Tartuffe]]'' ([''The Imposter''], 1664), and ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'' ([''The Misanthrope''], 1666).

== Early examples ==
The comedy of manners has been employed by Roman satirists since as early as the first century BC. [[Horace]]'s [[Satires (Horace)|Satire 1.9]] is a prominent example, in which the persona is unable to express his wish for his companion to leave, but instead subtly implies so through wit.

[[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' might be considered the first comedy of manners In [[England]], but the genre really flourished during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] period. [[Restoration comedy]], which was influenced by [[Ben Jonson]]'s [[comedy of humours]], made fun of affected wit and acquired follies of the time.  The masterpieces of the genre were the plays of [[William Wycherley]] (''[[The Country Wife]]'', 1675) and [[William Congreve (playwright)|William Congreve]] (''[[The Way of the World]]'', 1700). In the late 18th century [[Oliver Goldsmith]] (''[[She Stoops to Conquer]]'', 1773) and [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] (''[[The Rivals]]'', 1775; ''[[The School for Scandal]]'', 1777) revived the form.

The tradition of elaborate, artificial plotting and epigrammatic dialogue was carried on by the Irish playwright [[Oscar Wilde]] in ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'' (1892) and ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' (1895). In the 20th century, the comedy of manners reappeared in the plays of the British dramatists [[Noël Coward]] (''[[Hay Fever (play)|Hay Fever]]'', 1925) and [[Somerset Maugham]] and the novels of [[P. G. Wodehouse]], as well as various [[British sitcom]]s.  The ''[[Carry On film]]s'' are a direct descendant of the comedy of manners 
style.

== Twentieth-century examples ==

The term ''[[comedy of menace]]'', which British drama critic [[Irving Wardle]] based on the subtitle of ''[[The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace]]'' (1958), by [[David Campton]], is a jocular play-on-words derived from the "comedy of manners" (''menace'' being ''manners'' pronounced with a somewhat Judeo-English accent).&lt;ref name=Merritt&gt;Susan Hollis Merritt, ''Pinter in Play: Critical Strategies and the Plays of Harold Pinter'' (Durham &amp; London, 1990: Duke UP, 1995) 5, 9–10, 225–28, 240.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pinter's play ''[[The Homecoming]]'' has been described as a mid-twentieth-century "comedy of manners".&lt;ref name=Merritt/&gt;

In ''[[Boston Marriage (play)|Boston Marriage]]'' (1999), [[David Mamet]] chronicles a sexual relationship between two women, one of whom has her eye on yet another young woman (who never appears, but who is the target of a seduction scheme).  Periodically, the two women make their serving woman the butt of haughty jokes, serving to point up the satire on class.  Though displaying the verbal dexterity one associates with both the playwright and the genre, the patina of wit occasionally erupts into shocking crudity.

Other contemporary examples include [[Kazuo Ishiguro]]'s ''[[The Remains of the Day]]'', [[E. M. Forster]]'s ''[[A Room with a View]]'', [[Barbara Pym]]'s ''[[Excellent Women]]'', [[Douglas Carter Beane]]'s ''[[As Bees in Honey Drown]]'', ''[[The Country Club (play)|The Country Club]]'', ''[[The Little Dog Laughed (play)|The Little Dog Laughed]]'', ''[[You Rang, M'Lord?]]'' by [[David Croft (TV producer)|David Croft]] and [[Jimmy Perry]], and the [[Jeeves|Jeeves and Wooster]] series by [[P. G. Wodehouse]]. The television program ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]'' is another contemporary example of the comedy of manners.

'''''Côr Cymru''''' is a Welsh TV competition searching for the best choir in Wales, and airing every 2 years on [[S4C]]. The first series was presented by [[Aled Jones]] and Heledd Cynwal in 2003, but subsequent series have been fronted by [[Nia Roberts (presenter)|Nia Roberts]] and [[Gareth Owen (presenter)|Gareth Owen]].

The show sees choirs competing against each other in knockout-style semi finals in five different categories (female voice, male voice, mixed, youth (16–25 years), and children's choirs). The winners in each category then compete in the live final for the grand title of "Choir of Wales".

Despite a similar show being developed by the [[BBC]] in the form of ''[[Last Choir Standing]]'', S4C recently revealed '''''Côr Cymru''''' returned for a brand new series in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s4c.co.uk/sched/e_press_level2.shtml?id=180 S4C Press Release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526132221/http://www.s4c.co.uk/sched/e_press_level2.shtml?id=180 |date=26 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Doctor Who: Podshock''''' (commonly referred to as '''''Podshock''''', but officially titled '''''Outpost Gallifrey Presents… Doctor Who: Podshock''''') is a weekly [[podcast]] about the British [[science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]''.  The podcast, which originated in 2005, is produced by the Gallifreyan Embassy, a [[Doctor Who fandom|''Doctor Who'' fan group]] originally based in [[Long Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

''Doctor Who: Podshock'' is also significant for being the first podcast to be officially attached to the world's largest ''Doctor Who'' online community, [[Outpost Gallifrey]]. Further, it was the first ''Doctor Who'' podcast to feature both British and American hosts, along with regular contributors from other parts of the English-speaking world.

==History==
''Podshock'' has its origins on Long Island, New York. The first meeting of the fan club which would eventually spawn ''Podshock'' was held in a [[Holiday Inn]] in [[Rockville Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallifreyanembassy.org/portal/article.php?story%3D20050713035419514 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043544/http://gallifreyanembassy.org/portal/article.php?story=20050713035419514 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} Louis Trapani comments on the 20th anniversary of the Gallifreyan Embassy.&lt;/ref&gt; on or about 18 June 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallifreyanembassy.org/portal/article.php?story%3D22yearsago |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043551/http://gallifreyanembassy.org/portal/article.php?story=22yearsago |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} Louis Trapani comments on the 22d anniversary of the Gallifreyan Embassy.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was one of many local clubs being formed around the US during the early 1980s heyday of the [[PBS]] broadcast of so-called "classic" ''Doctor Who''.  Principally, the group existed to mobilize support for PBS [[pledge drive]]s, but it also formed a support network for those wishing to attend [[Science fiction convention|conventions]], watch the programme in a social environment, and to generally help promote the programme in their area.   One of the membership benefits was a printed newsletter, which, over time, was supplanted by a website.  When the new series of ''Doctor Who'' began in 2005, the Gallifreyan Embassy decided on a new means by which to deliver their content.  On August 9, 2005, the first episode of the club's then-new podcast was released.  The name they chose for this new audio publication— "Podshock"—was a reference both to [[podcasting]] and to the 1982 ''Doctor Who'' serial, ''[[Earthshock]]''.

June 2015 marks the 10th Anniversary of Podshock. The occasion will be acknowledged by - at least - two special episodes.

==Affiliation with Outpost Gallifrey==
On January 21, 2007 the podcast became affiliated with the ''Doctor Who'' fan website, Outpost Gallifrey.  It was after this alliance that the name of the podcast was changed to include a reference to Outpost Gallifrey.  It was the only podcast officially associated with the popular ''Doctor Who'' website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallifreyone.com/podcast.php Outpost Gallifrey announces the rebranding of ''Podshock''.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519032752/http://gallifreyone.com/podcast.php |date=May 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on December 1, 2007, the Outpost was reduced to a gateway to other sites, and an archive of the site's final incarnation; ''Podshock'' continued to be released until the summer of 2009 under a logo bearing the words, "Outpost Gallifrey Presents," until removing that nomenclature after the site officially shut down.

==Hosts==
The show main hosts: Louis Trapani, Dave Cooper, Ian Bissett, Lee Shackleford, and Kyle Jones

Previous hosts include:
*Ken Deep
*James Naughton
*Graeme Sheridan

Correspondents and contributors from around the world who occasionally contribute to the show:
*Chris Rattray
*Mike Doran
*Russel Hale
*Colin Bordley
*Dave Cooper
*Taras Hnatyshyn
*Billy Davis
*Joshua Lou Friedman

Various others have become regular call-in listeners on the ''Podshock: LIVE!'' format, discussed below.

==Format==
All episodes of ''Podshock'', regardless of their content, have something things in common.  All episodes of ''Podshock'', regardless of type, begin with a stylized intro.  Generally, but not always, a clip from the classic or current series is played.  Then, spoken either by one of the hosts, or via a pre-recorded insert, the same phrase begins every episode: "Live!  From ___________! It's ''Doctor Who: Podshock''!", in a fashion similar to the opening skits in ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.  The blank is filled in by a different place relative to the ''Doctor Who'' universe.  It has become a popular pastime amongst listeners to offer hints on how to fill in the blank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallifreyanembassy.org/portal/forum/viewtopic.php?forum%3D19%26showtopic%3D15879%26highlight%3Dlive+from |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043537/http://gallifreyanembassy.org/portal/forum/viewtopic.php?forum=19&amp;showtopic=15879&amp;highlight=live%20from |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} Suggestions on how to complete the sentence, "Live from ________"&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Podshock'' "proper"===
The bulk of the episodes of ''Podshock'' involve at least two of the three main hosts connected via [[Skype]].  These episodes tend to have a great deal of [[post-production]] work added to them, resulting in a product that approximates studio recording.

A typical episode will run for 80–110 minutes, and contains discussion on all things related to ''Doctor Who'', including the television series (both [[List of Doctor Who episodes (1963–1989)|old]] and [[List of Doctor Who episodes (2005–present)|new]]), [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish|audio plays]] by [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]], [[:Category:Doctor Who books|books]], [[Doctor Who merchandise|merchandise]], and the various spin-off series. The show typically starts off with a news section which presents ''Doctor Who''-related news from the previous week. The features segment usually follows the news. This generally consists of discussion and reviews of various ''Doctor Who''-related topics.  Often, the featured material is pre-recorded in the form of an interview or a review.   Feedback from listeners is also included towards the end of the episode, facilitated in part by a call-in line maintained by the Gallifreyan Embassy.

The occasional interviews on the main show have included the actors [[Colin Baker]], [[Deborah Watling]], Jules Burt and [[Eugene Washington]], music composers [[Murray Gold]] and [[Mark Ayres]] and writers [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]], [[Steven Moffat]], [[Tom MacRae]] and [[Paul Cornell]]. Interviews from archive sources, mostly with people who were involved in the original series of Doctor Who, also feature from time to time.  These have included [[Jon Pertwee]], [[Sylvester McCoy]], [[Sophie Aldred]], [[John Nathan-Turner]] and [[Peter Davison]].

===Aftershocks===
On occasion, a much shorter version of the podcast will be published.  This type of show debuted on 5 February 2006 and received the name "Aftershock", in deference to the fact that it usually gave a bit more information about a topic that had been covered in the previous week's podcast.  Generally they are hosted by only one of the three hosts and aim to give greater context to a story previously reported, impart some late-breaking news, or explain why a forthcoming episode is being delayed.

===TalkShoe roundtables===

====''Podshock: LIVE!''====
[[Roundtable]] discussions were occasionally attempted on the show prior to 2007.  However, with the coming of the third series of ''Doctor Who'' in March 2007, ''Podshock'' adopted a new technology, [[TalkShoe]], to facilitate much larger numbers of participants at one time.  Starting with Episode 73, an uninterrupted run of 16 weekly episodes began wherein anyone could call in and be placed on the air. However, the recording technology of TalkShoe proved problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gallifreyanembassy.org/portal/forum/viewtopic.php?forum%3D19%26showtopic%3D13072 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043523/http://gallifreyanembassy.org/portal/forum/viewtopic.php?forum=19&amp;showtopic=13072 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} A thread on the Gallifreyan Embassy forum which documents the problems in getting the TalkShoe shows published&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially, host and [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|editor]] Louis Trapani attempted to clean up each episode through post-production.  By episode 80, though, that practice was abandoned entirely, with Trapani noting on air that the post-production wasn't helping to improve the audio.  The decision to stop post-production on the TalkShoe episodes was also motivated by the fact that they were almost immediately available to listeners in their raw form on the TalkShoe website itself.  Thus, these episodes developed the secondary name, ''Podshock LIVE!'', used primarily on the TalkShoe website.

This type of ''Podshock'' has become dominant since they were introduced.  From  14 April 2007, until 26 May 2008, the ratio of ''Podshock: Live!'' to ''Podshock'' was about 4:1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://podcastalley.com/podcast_details.php?pod_id=7973&amp;allEpisodes= Podcast Alley listing of all ''Podshock'' releases] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022045606/http://podcastalley.com/podcast_details.php?pod_id=7973&amp;allEpisodes= |date=October 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2008, the decision was taken to more formally separate the live roundtables from the studio recordings.  Hence, for the fourth series of ''Doctor Who'', roundtable discussions of individual episodes were no longer part of the main [[RSS|subscription feed]], and are considered a separate podcast by the hosts.&lt;ref name=Changes&gt;[http://gallifreyanembassy.org/portal/forum/viewtopic.php?forum=19&amp;showtopic=24341 Trapani explains changes in how ''Podshock: LIVE!'' will be distributed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726022415/http://gallifreyanembassy.org/portal/forum/viewtopic.php?forum=19&amp;showtopic=24341 |date=July 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Since September 2005 the show has been produced in two [[Audio file format|audio formats]]: an enhanced version, encoded in [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]], and an [[MP3]] version. Both have the same audio content, but the enhanced version also includes embedded chapter markers, images and [[hyperlink]]s.  Initial episodes of the TalkShoe roundtables also were availabable in both enhanced and non-enhanced versions, but this practice was abandoned when post-production on that type of episode stopped.

==Reception==

===By critics and general audiences===
''Podshock'' is, according to iTunes, the most popular ''Doctor Who'' podcast.

A review in a 2007 issue of ''[[SciFi Now]]'' gave the show four out of five stars, describing it as "seriously meaty" analysis of Doctor Who and "the perfect accompaniment to the television series", while at the same time noting that the presenters were "massive Dr. Who aficionados" whose personalities were obscured behind a "voiceover [that] is slow, dull and very hard work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=Round Up - Podcasts|journal=[[SciFi Now]]|issue=1|pages=69|id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show is sometimes taken to task for its length.  For instance, commentators at the [[Tachyon TV]] podcast website noted that the 24 June 2007 episode of Tachyon TV was "as funny as one would expect and at half an hour, a good 12 hours shorter than your average Podshock."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.behindthesofa.org.uk/2007/06/tachyon-tv-podc.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629020155/http://www.behindthesofa.org.uk/2007/06/tachyon-tv-podc.html#comments |archivedate=2007-06-29 |df= }} Comments of Iain Hepburn at behindthesofa.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

===By production team===
At least one ''Doctor Who'' writer, Paul Cornell, was at one time a devoted listener of ''Podshock''. Writing on his own blog in February 2007, he noted that, even though a colleague of his had appeared on the [[Doctor Who: DWO Whocast|DWO Whocast]], he was "still a ''Podshock'' boy at heart," although later that year he actually appeared on [[Doctor Who: DWO Whocast|DWO Whocast]].&lt;ref&gt;http://paulcornell.blogspot.com/2007/02/canonicity-in-doctor-who.html Paul Cornell's blog in February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''eye rhyme''', also called  a '''visual rhyme''' or  a '''sight rhyme''', is a  [[rhyme]] in which two words are spelled similarly but pronounced differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Rhyme|work=Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia|edition= 6th (2011): 1. MAS Ultra – School |page=23|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the name of English actor [[Sean Bean]], whose name based on its visual aspect looks like it should be pronounced "Seen Been", but when spoken, there is no rhyming quality.

Many older [[English poetry|English poems]], particularly those written in [[Middle English]], contain rhymes that were originally true or full rhymes, but as read by modern readers, they are now eye rhymes because of [[Sound change|shifts in pronunciation]], especially the [[Great Vowel Shift]]. These are called historic rhymes. Historic rhymes are used by linguists to reconstruct pronunciations of old languages, and are used particularly extensively in the [[reconstruction of Old Chinese]], whose writing system does not allude directly to pronunciation.

==Example==
One example of a historic rhyme (i.e. one which was a true rhyme which is now an eye rhyme), is the following:

{{Quote|text=The great man down, you mark his favourite '''flies''';&lt;br /&gt;The poor advanced makes friends of '''enemies'''.|character=Player King|author=[[William Shakespeare]]|title=''[[Hamlet]]''|source=act III, scene II}}

When ''Hamlet'' was written around 1600, "flies" and "enemies" rhymed in local dialects, but as a result of the shifts in pronunciation since then, the original rhyme has been lost.

"'''Fly'''" is the tenth episode of the [[Breaking Bad (season 3)|third season]] of [[United States|American]] television drama [[television show|series]] ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', and the 30th overall episode of the series. Written by [[Sam Catlin]] and [[Moira Walley-Beckett]] and directed by [[Rian Johnson]], it aired on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States and Canada on May 23, 2010.

"Fly" has been described as "arguably the most polarizing episode in ''Breaking Bad'' history", differing from most others in its slow pacing and relative lack of action. A few critics have considered it to be one of the greatest episodes of the series.

==Plot==
[[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]], suffering from [[insomnia]], stares up at his smoke detector's flashing light while trying to get back to sleep. Later, he arrives with [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]] at the superlab, where they begin making another batch of [[methamphetamine|meth]]. At the end of the day, Walt calculates that their yield, while above what they are required to produce, falls short of what he expects. Jesse suggests it may be from other losses from spillage, but Walt insists there is another reason. 

After Jesse leaves for the day, Walt sees a [[housefly]] in the lab which he fears could contaminate the meth-making process. He tries numerous means to swat it, even dangling precariously from the lab's [[catwalk]], from which he slips and falls to the floor. When Jesse returns the next day, he finds Walt still in pain from the fall and demanding that they cannot start cooking until they get rid of the fly. Jesse worries about Walt's lack of sleep and suggests they go outside to figure it out. However, when Jesse leaves, Walt locks him out of the lab and goes back to find the fly. When Jesse disconnects the main power to the lab, Walt lets him back in so they can work together. Jesse gets some [[flypaper]] which they hang around the lab, as well as some sleeping pills that he secretly puts into Walt's coffee. He then recounts a story about his late aunt, who experienced auditory hallucinations as a result of her cancer spreading to her brain. Walt asserts that he is still in [[remission (medicine)|remission]]. 

As they wait to catch the fly, the two talk about their families. Walt expresses that he should have died already and tries to think of the perfect moment to have done so: after he had enough money, after [[List of Breaking Bad characters#Holly White|Holly]] was born, before his surgery and before [[Skyler White|Skyler]] knew what he'd been doing. He finally decides the perfect moment to die would have been the night [[Jane Margolis|Jane]] died, telling Jesse of his [[Phoenix (Breaking Bad)|conversation]] with her father [[Donald Margolis|Donald]]. He tries to calculate the chances of meeting both father and daughter in different scenarios on the same night despite having never met either beforehand, but finds the odds too astronomical to calculate. Jesse is distracted when he sees the fly near the ceiling. As he tries to use a step-ladder to reach the fly, an increasingly-sleepy Walt seems poised to confess to Jesse about his role in Jane's death. Jesse tells him Jane's death was nobody's fault, but he still misses her. Jesse climbs back down and, seeing the fly land on the ladder, swats and kills it. 

Jesse takes a sleeping Walt to a couch while he cleans up the superlab and prepares for their next batch. They later leave together, but Walt warns Jesse that if he has been skimming from their product, he will not be able to protect him if [[Gus Fring|Gus]] finds out. Jesse denies taking anything and states that he isn't asking anyone to protect him. That night, Walt is again unable to fall asleep, and sees a fly landing on the smoke detector's flashing light.

==Production==
"Fly" was produced as a result of the series' considerable budgetary restrictions and being unable to afford the $25,000–$35,000 needed to move the production trucks to a new location.&lt;ref name=Vineyard&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/vince-gilligan-breaking-bad-exhibit-tour-guide.html|title=Vince Gilligan at Breaking Bad Museum Exhibit: 'That's a Bit of a Spoiler'|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|date=July 29, 2013|publisher=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]|location=[[New York City]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801072152/http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/vince-gilligan-breaking-bad-exhibit-tour-guide.html|archive-date=August 1, 2013|dead-url=no|access-date=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series creator [[Vince Gilligan]] remarked: "We were hopelessly over budget&amp;nbsp;... And we needed to come up with what is called a [[bottle episode]], set in one location."&lt;ref name=Vineyard/&gt; The episode was written by [[Sam Catlin]] and [[Moira Walley-Beckett]], and directed by [[Rian Johnson]]; it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on May 23, 2010.

Along with [[extra (acting)|extras]] in the laundromat, [[Bryan Cranston]] and [[Aaron Paul]] are the only two actors who appear in the episode. Series regulars [[Dean Norris]] ([[Hank Schrader|Hank]]), [[Betsy Brandt]] ([[Marie Schrader|Marie]]), and [[RJ Mitte]] ([[Walter White, Jr.|Walt, Jr.]]) are credited, but do not appear. [[Anna Gunn]] ([[Skyler White|Skyler]])'s voice is heard in the episode, but it is reused audio from the second season episode "[[Phoenix (Breaking Bad)|Phoenix]]".

Gilligan noted that the limited setting and cast allowed for a slower pace and deeper exploration of character traits and motives:

{{quote|Even if financial realities didn't enter into it, I feel as a [[showrunner]] that there should be a certain shape and pace to each season, and the really high highs that you try to get to at the end of a season — the big dramatic moments of action and violence, the big operatic moments you're striving for — I don't think would land as hard if you didn't have the moments of quiet that came before them. The quiet episodes make the tenser, more dramatic episodes pop even more than they usually would just by their contrast.|[[Vince Gilligan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murray |first=Noel |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/vince-gilligan-42064 |title=Vince Gilligan - Interview |publisher=''[[The A.V.

===Reviews===
While not a favorite among audiences, "Fly" has been widely acclaimed by critics, particularly for its cinematography and its method of developing the relationship between Walter and Jesse. Donna Bowman of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave "Fly" an A grade, praising Rian Johnson's direction and remarking that the episode "would have been stellar even with more conventional direction, but with the unhinged images and bold juxtapositions Johnson provides, it's one of the most distinctive hours of television we're likely to see this year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/breaking-bad-fly-41430|title=Breaking Bad: "Fly"| publisher=The A.V.

Others frankly think it belongs much higher on this list. But we can all agree that "Fly" is one of the great bottle episodes of the new golden age of TV."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/gallery/0,,20734160_20737170_30022851,00.html#30022963|title='Breaking Bad': We Rank Every Episode|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=September 30, 2013|accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative reception toward "Fly" is primarily in the form of arguments that the episode is devoid of plot development and action. An unfavorable Tasha Robinson, however, also argued in ''The A.V. Club'' that the episode presents "a vision of Walt that did not in any way coincide with the mental image I’d built of him over the course of the series, as a self-justifying, angry man who could be a real badass when required: Instead, we have to see him as irrational and petty to the point of rank stupidity, taking moronic action after action that clearly risks his safety and well-being… all to catch a fly." Robinson "hated it", writing about the episode for an article in which numerous writers for the site discussed what they thought were the weakest episodes of great shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/best-tv-show-worst-episode-61265|title=Best TV show, worst episode| publisher=The A.V.

'''Folk dance of Mexico''' (''ballet folklórico'') covers a wide range of Mexican dance forms. Folk dance, despite modernization and other social efforts, has survived.

==History==
Mexico’s modern folk dance tradition is a blending of elements from its Indigenous, African, and European heritage. Before the arrival of the Spanish, indigenous dance developed with strong ties to the religious practices.&lt;ref name="drojas"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.folklorico.com/danzas/danzas.html |title=Danzas de México |first=David |last=Rojas |publisher= Instituto Cultural "Raíces Mexicanas"  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Dances of Mexico |accessdate=May 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Aztec]]s, there were two levels of dance, one for the common people, often related to the agricultural cycle and those for the elite. After the Conquest, the Spanish initially worked to eradicate indigenous dances, considering them “too pagan” and succeeded with a number of forms, especially those associated with the priest and ruling classes.&lt;ref name="drojas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aguilar"&gt;{{Cite thesis |type= |chapter= |title=The rituals of kindness: The influence of the Danza Azteca tradition of central Mexico on Chicano-Mexcoehuani identity and sacred space |url= |author=Mario E Aguilar |year=2009 |publisher= The Claremont Graduate University |docket= 3364048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were unable to eradicate the more popular forms, especially in the rural and more inaccessible regions of [[New Spain]]. Instead, evangelizers worked to adapt dances to Christianity, giving them new meanings. For this reason, most of these dances have suffered at least some modification since the pre Hispanic era.&lt;ref name="drojas"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rcantu"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cantú |first=Rebecca |date=Fall 2007 |title=Dance!

[[File:The Dancing Style of Aztec Noble Dancers WDL6751.png|thumbnail|left|Aztec nobels dancing as depicted in the post-Conquest [[Tovar Codex]].]]

Dance evolved drastically from 1520 to 1750, mostly among the indigenous and [[mestizo]] descendents. One of the first adaptations was allowing the indigenous to continue dances with religious aspects but in homage to the [[Virgin Mary]] or other [[List of Catholic saints|Catholic personage]]. One of the first areas to begin innovation was [[Tlaxcala]], were dances to reenact the Conquest are traced.&lt;ref name="aguilar"/&gt; In addition, a number of European dances, music and instruments were introduced including [[Moros y cristianos]] (a mock battle between Moors and Christians brought t the central states), Los Archos, Las Escadas, Los Machetes, El Paloteo, Las Cintas and Los Doce Pares.&lt;ref name="rcantu"/&gt; Other European dances include La Zambra, La Zarabanda, La Contradanza, [[seguidilla]]s, [[fandango]]s, [[huapango]]s, [[jota (music)|jotas]], [[bolero]]s, [[zambra]]s and [[Zapateado (Mexico)|zapateado]]s. In some cases, these dances were modified or given entirely new choreography in Mexico.&lt;ref name="rcantu"/&gt; Most of the traditional dances performed today took on their forms during the colonial period but they were not firmly part of Mexican identity until after the Mexican War of Independence when it received its first surge in popularity. For example, the jarabe dance of Jalisco, became a political tool to evoke feelings of patriotism and “liberty.” In fact, this dance became intricately linked to the independence movement, causing it to be called the Jarabe Mexicano. Its popularity led to interest in other Mexican traditional dances, especially those danced to [[son (music)|son music]].&lt;ref name="rcantu"/&gt;
[[File:Pg-153.jpg|thumb|Dance as depicted in "Mexico, California and Arizona; being a new and revised edition of Old Mexico and her lost provinces" (1900).]]
Despite modern and foreign influences in Mexico’s culture in the 19th and 20th centuries, waves of nationalism have kept much of the country’s folk dance tradition alive to the present day. The next wave of popularity came after the Mexican Revolution, which also created new songs in folk styles such as the still popular [[La Adelita]], [[La Valentina (corridor)|La Valentina]], and [[La Cucaracha]]. The years after the Revolution also sparked interest in Mexico’s indigenous heritage shifting away from the European emphasis of the [[Porfirio Díaz|Porfirian]] era. This was reinforced by the muralists and other artists of the 1920s and 1930s whose political aims were to forge a Mexican identity, rejecting foreign influences and politics.&lt;ref name="rcantu"/&gt; In the 1930s, the popularity of the dance prompted education and more formal training in it, with educational centers all over Mexico offering classes including the Departamento de Bellas Arts (Fine Arts Department) of Mexico City. Interest in folk dance declined in the 1950s and 1960s, but the Mexican government continued to subsidize it for its aesthetic and social value. This included the support of folk dance or ballet folklórico companies, the most famous of which is the [[Ballet Folklórico de México]] founded by [[Amalia Hernández]] in 1952.&lt;ref name="rcantu"/&gt;

Today, traditional Mexican folk dance is a defining element of Mexico’s popular culture nationally and internationally. Preservation and promotion of dances nationally have depended on whether they are seen as part of Mexico’s national identity. It is one of the few areas where indigenous practices are conserved and promoted rather than depreciated or eliminated. One reason for this is “indigenismo” the ongoing struggles of a number of indigenous communities to resist outside influences into their cultures and Mexican government efforts to assimilate them to create a homogenous national identity. Since the 1990s, these efforts have become more political in nature and have resulted in more interest in preserving pre Hispanic cultural forms. ( The government also works to preserve and promote a number of dance forms, with folk dance mandatory in public schools.&lt;ref name="rcantu"/&gt; In September 2011, 457 people set a Guinness record for the largest folk dance performance at the International Mariachi and Charreria Conference in [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]], accompanied by over 300 mariachi musicians from Mexico, [[Argentina]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]] and the United States.&lt;ref name="guiness"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexico sets Guinness record for largest folk dance performance: MEXICO BALLET |newspaper=EFE News Service |location=Madrid |date=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican folk dance has had an important impact on the culture of the United States, especially in Mexican American communities. This has not only included the preservation of dances that existed before the Mexican–American War in the US Southwest, but other dances, such as the [[Concheros|Aztecas or Concheros]], dance have migrated north since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="aguilar"/&gt;

==Diversity==
[[File:VOLADOR.jpg|thumb|Volador]]
[[File:Baile mexicano..JPG|thumb|Jalisco jarabe]]
Mexican folk dance is an uneven synthesis of different cultural traditions. Its historical roots is the synthesis of indigenous, European and African cultural influences but it continues to evolves with influences from modern pop culture.&lt;ref name="agonzalez"&gt;{{cite book |last1= González |first1= Anita |last2= |title= Afro-Mexico : Dancing between Myth and Reality |year=2010  |publisher= University of Texas Press |location= Austin, TX |isbn= 978-0292723245 |pages=40–50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not one particular style but rather a collection of various regional and ethnic traditions.&lt;ref name="rcantu"/&gt; Dance traditions vary widely over Mexico’s expanse. In some areas, such as the [[Isthmus of Tehuantepec]] and the [[Yucatan Peninsula]], the pre Hispanic elements have almost completely disappeared. In others, such as [[Totonacapan]] (in the states of [[Veracruz]] and [[Puebla]]), among the [[Nahua peoples|Nahuas]] of [[Guerrero]] and [[State of Mexico]], the [[Huastec people|Huastecs]] of [[San Luis Potosí]] and areas in the northwest of the country, indigenous elements have been strongly maintained.&lt;ref name="drojas"/&gt; Those considered native or indigenous include [[Danza de los Voladores|Los Voladores]], [[Los Quetzales]], and the [[Yaqui music|Deer Dance]]. Dances that survive relatively intact are in areas that were remote from colonial authorities. However, their “purity” is under debate.&lt;ref name="rcantu"/&gt;
[[File:ConchShellAmeca.JPG|thumb|180px|left|Conchero dance blowing conch shell in [[Amecameca]].]]
Most of the ancient dances have been modified in various ways, although most of these are superficial with the basic movements remaining intact from the pre Hispanic period. The aspect to change most has been costuming. The materials used to produce dance costumes, adapting to new materials and the loss of old ones. The use of hides and feathers is the oldest of costuming traditions, but today costumes can be made of synthetic fabrics and other modern elements. One common substitution is the use of mirrors on costumes to replace polished stones.&lt;ref name="drojas"/&gt;

Instruments used to accompany the dancers have changed to include those from Europe, but pre Hispanic ones, especially drums and flutes, are still used.&lt;ref name="drojas"/&gt; However, as many dances are still tied to religious events, knowing how to play the traditional songs and dance the traditional dances still gives dancers and musicians social stature, as they are keepers of tradition and expected to pass it along to the next generation.&lt;ref name="agonzalez"/&gt;

Traditional dance generally involves the history and/or the cosmology of the people who perform it, and is a part of the social cohesion of that group.&lt;ref name="artshistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts-history.mx/banco/index.php?id_nota=24042006114200 |title=Danzas tradicionales |publisher=Artes e historia magazine |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Traditional dances |accessdate=May 23, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323003443/http://www.arts-history.mx/banco/index.php?id_nota=24042006114200 |archivedate=March 23, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While varying widely, many folk dances in Mexico share some common elements. Animals that appear in these dances are generally those that were religiously significant to pre-Hispanic indigenous people. These animals include deer, serpents, eagles, and [[jaguar]]s. After the Conquest, dancers added other animals&amp;mdash;such as horses, bulls, and roosters.&lt;ref name="artshistory"/&gt; Masks are used in various ways in Mexican dance. They can be used to “transform” the dancer into a character, either metaphorically or religiously, it can be used to hide the dancer’s identity for festivals such as [[Carnival]] to allow for pranks and/or it can be used for social commentary, for example a farmer wearing a mask and military-style clothing to protest corrupt police. The use of mirrors on costumes are to represent the life force of the sun as its light is reflected as the dancers move.&lt;ref name="agonzalez"/&gt; 
[[File:ConcursoHuapango04.JPG|thumb|Huapango dance]]
Most Mexican traditional dance shows indigenous and/or European heritage, but there are some that show the country’s African past, especially in Veracruz and the Costa Chica region in Guerrero and Oaxaca. Like indigenous dances, African based ones often involved the use of masks, costumes and other props that carry various meanings with the dances themselves function as a form of social cohesion.&lt;ref name="agonzalez"/&gt; In Veracruz, best known “African” dances include Los Negritos, along with various huapangos and sons.&lt;ref name="rcantu"/&gt; In the Costa Chica, the best known of these dances include Los Diablos, Las Tortugas and Toro de Petate.&lt;ref name="agonzalez"/&gt;

Generally, folk dance is popular and well supported by various government efforts, but not all to the same extent. Those considered representative of the country and popular outside their home region, such as the ''jarocho'' or ''jarabe'' receive regional and federal support. Those without that type of popularity are performed mostly in local and regional religious events. While much support is geared to preserving dance forms, art forms outside of Mexico still have influence. Traditional dance is taught alongside more modern dance such as [[salsa (dance)|salsa]], [[Merengue (dance)|merengue]] and [[Hip-hop dance|hip hop]] in various schools and cultural centers across the country with some crossover effect.&lt;ref name="agonzalez"/&gt;

==Ballet Folklórico de México==
[[File:Ballet Folklórico de México (1970) - 001.jpg|thumb|Ballet Folkorico de Mexico 1970]]
Mexico’s best known folk dance troupe is the [[Ballet Folklórico de México]], which was founded by dancer Amalia Hernández in 1952.&lt;ref name="rcantu"/&gt; The troupe consists of forty dancers, a mariachi band and sixteen other musicians. Counting support staff such as costume and set designers, the organization involves over 600 people.&lt;ref name="travierso"&gt;{{cite news |title= Danza celebra riqueza de México |first=Maria |last=Travierso |newspaper=El Sentinel |location=Fort Lauderdale, FL |date=November 17, 2007 |page=2 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Dance celebrates the richeness of Mexico }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group began with eight dancers with sporadic performances until they were invited to perform on television for a program called Función de Gala.&lt;ref name="travierso"/&gt; Since 1959, it has performed regularly at the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in Mexico City. In 1970 was named the official folk dance company of Mexico.&lt;ref name="rcantu"/&gt;

Amalia Hernández has become a cultural ambassador for Mexico through her work with the dance troupe until her death in 2000 at the age of 84. Today, her grandson Salvador López is the director of the group. The repertoire maintains the traditional dances although somewhat updated with the choreography of López. Dances include the Jarabe tapatío, the Deer Dance and the Aztecs/Concheros. It also has “new” dances such as ''Adelitas,'' which honors the women of the Mexican Revolution. The group has performed over 15,000 times in sixty counties and 300 cities in Europe, Asia and Latin America. It has an average of 250 performances per year.&lt;ref name="travierso"/&gt;

The [[Concheros]] dance is also known as Apaches, Indios and Chichimecas.&lt;ref name="drojas"/&gt; It is a ritual dance that likely developed after 1522 as a means of preserving some elements of pre Hispanic culture. Members of these dance troupes are part of formal societies and unlike some other groups admit women. These troupes perform at annual festival mostly in honor of patron saints&amp;mdash;especially in the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe|Villa de Guadalupe]], [[Amecameca]], [[Chalma, Malinalco, Mexico State|Chalma]] and [[Los Remedios National Park|Los Remedios]]. These are located north, east, south, and west of Mexico City, a remnant of the importance of the cardinal directions to indigenous people. Dancers dress in indigenous style garb that can include loincloths, feathered headdresses body paint and more. They are accompanied by indigenous drums, flutes and small lutes made from [[armadillo]] shells (showing European influence). The symbolism and most of the steps are indigenous.&lt;ref name="agonzalez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="britanica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/131135/concheros |title= Concheros |publisher=Brittanica |accessdate=May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Danza de los Voladores]] (Dance of the Flyers) is a dance/ceremony/ritual still performed in Mexico today, best known in the Totonacapan area of northern Veracaruz and northern Puebla states. It is believed to have originated with the Nahua, Huastec and Otomi peoples in central Mexico, and then spread throughout most of Mesoamerica.  The ritual consists of dance and the climbing of a 30-meter pole from which four of the five participants then launch themselves tied with ropes to descend to the ground. The fifth remains on top of the pole, dancing and playing a flute and drum.&lt;ref name="wilkerson7576"&gt;{{Cite book|title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffrey K |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9 |pages= 75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ceremony was named an [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]] by [[UNESCO]] in order to help the ritual survive in the modern world.&lt;ref name="mcclat"&gt;{{Cite news|title='Flying Men' are now Cultural Heritage |newspaper=McClatchy - Tribune Business News |location=Washington, DC |date=2009-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Moritos.jpg|thumb|left|Scene from performance of ''[[Moros y Cristianos]]'' (Moors and Christians)]]
Moros y cristianos (Moors and Christians) is not indigenous in origin. It was introduced by monks in the 16th century and widely practiced in central Mexico, especially [[Michoacán]]. The dancers form two groups to represents the two religious, each wearing masks and capes with [[Moors]] marked by a crescent moon and the Christians with a cross. The other elements of the dress vary widely with some versions having the Christians dressed as [[charro]]s. This dance is part of a larger ceremony that can last up to two days and consist in mock battles and negotiations as well as dance. The voices of the participants generally sing and speak with a high-pitch or [[falsetto]] voice. Santiagos is named after the patron saint of Spain, [[James, son of Zebedee|Saint James]].

===Dances in western Mexico===
[[File:Baile folklórico dancers at Yale 2, October 17, 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Jarabe dancers]]
The [[Jarabe Tapatío|Jarabe]] is considered Mexico’s “national dance” and is the best known outside the country, often called the “Mexican Hat Dance” in English.&lt;ref name="ovalle"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexfoldanco.org/mexican/folkloric/dance/jarabe-tapatio.html |title= El Jarabe Tapatío |publisher= Mexican Folkloric Dance Company of Chicago |location=Chicago, IL |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mexdes"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/el-jarabe-tapatio-jalisco.html |title= El Jarabe Tapatío (Jalisco) |publisher= Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dance was performed for the first time formally in 1790 at the Coliseo Theater in Mexico City. During the 1860s it was fashionable in high society.&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt; The dance symbolizes the courtship of a woman by a man, who at first is refused but accepted in the end. The two protagonists are usually a man in a charro suit and a woman in a “[[China Poblana]]” outfit. It was popularized internationally in the 20th century by Russian dancer [[Anna Pavlova]] who visited Mexico in 1919. She made the dance part of her permanent repertoire. The dance’s current form emerged nationally during the Mexican Revolution although various “jarabe” dances existed before this time, such as the Jarabe Jalisco, the Jarabe Atole and Jarabe Moreliana. The charros outfit is from Mexico’s cowboy tradition and the China Poblana outfit is based on the dress of an Asian woman who became famous in the city of Puebla in the colonial period. Today, this dress, especially the skirt, is heavily decorated with patriotic themes.&lt;ref name="ovalle"/&gt; 
[[File:MuseoAfromestizas09.JPG|thumb|Frames used for the Turtle and Straw Bull dances in the Museo de las Culturas Afromestizas in [[Cuajinicuilapa]] Guerrero]]
Many notable dances are found in the state of Guerrero. The three most common dances of the coast of Oaxaca and Guerrero are the Devil Dance, the Turtle Dance and the Toro de Petate (Straw Bull Dance), all of which are tied to the area’s Afro-Mexican communities. The first three contains characteristics which are found only in this region and nowhere else in Mexico and include violence and even sexual overtures. The main characters, devils, turtles and bulls represented by those in masks, are mythical creatures which dance in the streets alongside humans who either challenge or subdue them. Other important Afro-Mexican dances include the Tiger Dance and the Tejorones.&lt;ref name="agonzalez"/&gt;

[[File:JarabeTapatio.jpg|frame|left|Jarabe Tapatío in the traditional China Poblana dress.]]
Los Chivos is another dance performed in Guerrero. It is dancers perform movements related to that of goats (chivos) accompanies by wood boxes used as drums and an instruments made from a donkey’s jaw, which is rubbed on the side with a wooden stick. The dancers wear red wooden masks with deer antlers covered in streamers and paper flowers, along with skirts that reach the knees. Machomula refers to a wooden horse’s head which is central to the dance performed in the Costa Chica of Guerrero. The night before a festival, this head is carried on beams all night while the men sing and sometimes perform parodies. On the day of the festival, they form a procession with the guardian of the horse’s head in front on a wooden horse. Pescados (Fish) is performed mostly in Guerrero by participants acting as fishermen with nets and with those that play the part of fish who are identified by small wooden fish that hang from their shoulders. There is one other character which is a lizard, who is covered with a wooden frame that opens and closes its mouth. It also carries some barbed wire which it used to try to hit the fishermen. It is similar to the Tortuga (turtle) dance. [http://jaguarsdances.blogspot.mx/2015/10/t-ecuanes-jaguars.html Tecuanes] comes from [[Nahuatl]] which means jaguars or tigers. This dance is the only which features this animal. In this dance, the animal chases children and is in turned pursued by men, who wear masks, boots or chaps and very large sombreros. They carry whips which they use to hit the tiger who wears padding. The dance is very similar to Tlacololeros in its movements. Both are performed in Guerrero.&lt;ref name="drojas"/&gt;

[[Image:DancingNEStageMarGrito2010.JPG|thumb|right|250px|right|Ballet folklórico at the [[Celebration of Mexican political anniversaries in 2010]].]]

Los Mudos (The Mute) takes its name from the fact that participants are forbidden to speak during the ceremony and in some cases throughout the festival. The costume is feminine in appearance using rustic wigs made of maguey fibers braided with ribbons of many colors. This dance is common among the Nahuas in Guerrero.&lt;ref name="drojas"/&gt;

Paixtles is one of the few pre Hispanic dances to remain free from European influence, mostly performed in Jalisco and Nayarit. Participants cover themselves with the moss that hangs from [[Montezuma Cypress]] trees and carry staves which have the head of a deer at one end. They accompany themselves with [[maraca]]s that they carry. Dancers wear masks to cover the face and ribbons that hang from the head.&lt;ref name="drojas"/&gt;

Other important dances include La Judea, danced by the [[Cora people|Coras]] during Holy Week in [[Nayarit]], Sonajeros, danced in the south of Jalisco,&lt;ref name="drojas"/&gt; and the Dance of the Cúrpites&lt;ref name="Part of a special issue: Latin American Dance in Transnational Contexts"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bishop|first=Joyce|title="Those Who Gather In": An Indigenous Ritual Dance in the Context of Contemporary Mexican Transnationalism.|journal=Journal of American Folklore|date=Fall 2009|volume=122|pages=391–413|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aft&amp;AN=505263488&amp;site=ehost-live|accessdate=11/12/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gemsweeper''''' is a thinking puzzle [[casual game]] developed by German studio [[Lobstersoft]].
During the game the player rebuilds the ruins of El Dorado by solving over 225 [[nonogram]] logic puzzles.

== Story ==
In Gemsweeper the player assumes the role of a treasure hunter. When working in a museum putting together the pieces of a broken [[Olmec]] statue, the statue becomes alive and asks the player and old professor McGuffog to rebuild the mystical city of [[El Dorado]]. By solving over 225 puzzles, the player gradually rebuilds the ruins of the city and progresses his treasure hunter rank.

== Gameplay ==
The player has to uncover gems which are hidden behind some tiles and has to break all other tiles on the board. Numerical hints above and to the left of the board tell the player where the hidden gems are. Gems are picked up with a hand cursor whereas cursed tiles are smashed with a hammer. Jokers help if the player has to guess what's behind a tile.

Gemsweeper features an interactive tutorial to teach the player the basic principle of nonogram logic puzzles.

In Arcade Mode the gameplay is different from traditional 
nonograms. The puzzle does not contain a picture, but is abstract. As soon as a row is solved, a new row with different hints appear.

'''''Gossip''''' is a 2000 American [[teen film|teen]] [[psychological thriller film]] directed by [[Davis Guggenheim]] and featuring an [[ensemble cast]] including [[James Marsden]], [[Lena Headey]], [[Norman Reedus]], and [[Kate Hudson]].

==Plot==
The film takes place on a college campus in the [[Northeastern United States]].  Derrick Webb ([[James Marsden]]), Cathy Jones ([[Lena Headey]]), and Travis ([[Norman Reedus]]) are students as well as roommates.  They all take a Communications class with Professor Goodwin ([[Eric Bogosian]]), in which the subject of gossip is brought up. For their final project, the three students decide to start a rumor and track and see the results. One night while at a nightclub, they run into Naomi Preston ([[Kate Hudson]]) and her boyfriend Beau Edson ([[Joshua Jackson]]). It is common knowledge through the campus that Naomi is saving her [[virginity]] for marriage.  Jones (as Cathy is called throughout the movie) in particular has a problem with Naomi's wealth and sense of entitlement.  Furthermore, Naomi seems to have started a rumor about Jones having sex with Professor Goodwin.

While at the party, Derrick meets a girl and brings her upstairs. At this point the girl becomes ill; Derrick then notices Beau and Naomi in the adjacent room kissing. Beau attempts to have sex with Naomi but is rejected. Derrick, Jones, and Travis proceed to begin a rumor that Naomi and Beau had sex. Naomi finds out pretty soon about the rumor, but she denies it to her friends and Naomi becomes convinced she was raped by Beau, under the encouragement of her friends, she reports it to the police. As a result, Beau gets kicked off campus. It's eventually revealed that Derrick and Naomi came from the same home town and they were a couple in high school, much like Beau, Naomi refused Derrick and Derrick raped Naomi. Derrick denied the allegation and said Naomi only made it up so her father wouldn't be upset with her. Derrick wasn't very popular in school after the allegation so he moved after graduation and intentionally wanted to spread a rumor about Naomi to get her back. Beau finds out about this, and the two fight each other. Derrick manages to manipulate Beau into thinking they're both victims of Naomi's lies. Derrick goes to Naomi's dorm room to confront her, but Naomi attacks him and Derrick leaves. The next day, Naomi is pronounced dead and because of Derrick and Naomi's past (plus the new marks on Derrick's face,) the campus accuses Derrick of killing her. Investigators come to Derrick's apartment to search for clues and they have intense suspicions that Derrick's responsible. Under the overwhelming psychological pressure, Derrick admits to raping Naomi to Travis. The investigation was proven to be a setup by Jones, Travis, and their professor.  To Derrick's surprise, Naomi was revealed to be alive after he confessed.

[[File:Gumboot dancer.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Gumboot dancer in [[Olomouc]], [[Czech Republic]] at a show about [[Zulu people|Zulu culture]].]]
The '''gumboot dance''' (or Isicathulo&lt;ref&gt;http://kilby.sac.on.ca/activitiesclubs/outreach/malawi/isicathulo.htm&lt;/ref&gt;) is an [[South Africa]]n [[dance]] that is performed by dancers wearing [[wellington boot]]s. In [[South Africa]] these are more commonly called ''gumboots''.

The boots may be embellished with bells, so that they ring as the dancers stamp on the ground. This sound would be a code or a different calling to say something to another person a short distance away. This was used to communicate in the mines as there was strictly no talking otherwise there would be severe, drastic punishments at the discretion of their superior.

==Origin==
Rooted back in the dark gold mine tunnels of South Africa, gumboot dancing has come full circle. Initially a codified tap used by black miners deprived of conversation, gumboot dancing today is one of the most expressive South African dance genres.

==Description==
Gumboot dancers are commonly sighted on the streets and plazas of tourist areas in [[South Africa]], such as the [[Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront]] in [[Cape Town]]. Many of the steps and routines are parodies of the officers and guards who controlled the mines and barracks of South African [[gold]] miners.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}  Like other forms of African dance, Gumboot utilizes the concepts of [[polyrhythm]] and total body articulation, drawing from the cultural dances of the African workers that manned the mines.&lt;ref&gt;''African Dance''. Kariamu Welsh 2004 Chelsea House Publishers pages 28 {{ISBN|0-7910-7641-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Percussion instrument|percussive]] dance made by [[idiophones]] or autophones (objects of the everyday life vibrating by themselves), and is similar in execution and style to forms of [[Stepping (African-American)|"stepping"]] done by African-American [[fraternities]] and [[sororities]].

==Appearances outside core context==
The dance is the highlight of the performance of [[Black Umfolosi]], a prominent South African [[folk music|folk]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnAxhQk4drM YouTube video of Black Umfolosi]&lt;/ref&gt;

The album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'' by the American pop singer [[Paul Simon]] has a song titled "Gumboots", which is performed in the style of South African [[Jaiva|township jive]] ([[mbaqanga]]) and contains performances by members of the [[Boyoyo Boys]].

The British-American composer [[David Bruce (composer)|David Bruce]] has written a [[clarinet quintet]] entitled "Gumboots",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidbruce.net/works/gumboots.asp davidbruce.net]&lt;/ref&gt; which was inspired by Gumboot dancing. It was commissioned by [[Carnegie Hall]] in 2008 and can be heard in full on their website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carnegiehall.org/article/sound_insights/works/commissions/art_detail_Gumboots_commissions.html Carnegiehall.org]&lt;/ref&gt; performed by [[Todd Palmer (clarinetist)|Todd Palmer]] and the [[St. Lawrence String Quartet]].

Since the 1990s and 2000s, [[Drakensberg Boys' Choir School]] based at gumboot dancing the folk-African part of their repertoire and white gumboots are the part of the second variant of their concert costume (the first variant is a classical "white man's" costume).

The history of [[animation]] started long before the development of [[cinematography]]. Humans have probably attempted to depict motion as far back as the [[paleolithic]] period. [[Shadow play]] and the [[magic lantern]] offered popular shows with projected images on a screen, moving as the result of manipulation by hand and/or some minor mechanics. In 1833 the [[phenakistiscope]] introduced the [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] principle of modern animation, and would also provide the basis for cinematography.

==Early approaches to motion in art==
There are several examples of early sequential images that may seem similar to series of animation drawings. Most of these examples would only allow an extremely low [[frame rate]] when they are animated, resulting in short and crude animations that are not very lifelike. However, it's very unlikely that these images were intended to be somehow viewed as an animation. It is possible to imagine technology that could have been used in the periods of their creation, but no conclusive evidence in artifacts or descriptions have been found. It is sometimes argued that these early sequential images are too easily interpreted as "pre-cinema" by minds accustomed to film, comic books and other modern sequential images, while it is uncertain that the creators of these images envisioned anything like it.&lt;ref&gt;https://1895.revues.org/4624&lt;/ref&gt; The motion of instances smaller than a second that are necessary to break down an action into sufficient phases for fluent animation would not really develop before the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ZeiAAAAAQBAJ|first=Suzanne|last=Buchan|title=Pervasive Animation|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.nl/books?id=lA8kTFv-TVIC&lt;/ref&gt;

Early examples of attempts to capture the phenomenon of [[motion (physics)|motion]] into a still drawing can be found in [[paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s, where animals are often depicted with multiple legs in superimposed positions.{{sfn|Thomas|1958|p=8}} It has been claimed that these superimposed figures were intended for a form of animation with the flickering light of the flames of a fire or a passing torch illuminating different parts of the painted rock wall, revealing different parts of the motion.&lt;ref name="azéma"&gt;https://books.google.nl/books?id=XuYzjgEACAAJ&amp;dq&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nautil.us/issue/11/light/early-humans-made-animated-art|title=Early Humans Made Animated Art|publisher=Nautilus|last=Zorich|first=Zach|date=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological finds of small paleolithic discs with a hole in the middle and drawings on both sides have been claimed to be a kind of prehistoric [[thaumatrope]]s that show motion when spun on a string.&lt;ref name="azéma"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lisahistory.net/hist106/pw/articles/AnimationinPalaeolithicArt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Egyptmotionseries.jpg|thumb|300px|An [[Egypt]]ian [[burial chamber]] [[mural]], approximately 4000 years old, showing [[wrestler]]s in action.]]
An [[Egypt]]ian [[mural]] approximately 4000 years old, found in the tomb of [[Khnumhotep]] at the [[Beni Hassan]] cemetery, features a very long series of images that apparently depict the sequence of events in a [[wrestling]] match.&lt;ref name=lessing&gt;[http://www.lessing-photo.com/dispimg.asp?i=08011040+&amp;cr=40&amp;cl=1 Egypt Thomb]. ''Lessing Photo''. 02-15-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman poet and philosopher [[Lucretius]] (c. 99 BC – c. 55 BC) wrote in his poem ''[[De rerum natura]]'' a few lines that come close to the basic principles of animation: "...when the first image perishes and a second is then produced in another position, the former seems to have altered its pose. Of course this must be supposed to take place very swiftly: so great is their velocity, so great the store of particles in any single moment of sensation, to enable the supply to come up." It must be noted that this was in the context of dream images, rather than images produced by an actual or imagined technology.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.nl/books?id=aLiyFCm5ylMC&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;ots=5xQw9j3_Qt&amp;dq=lucretius%20phenakistiscope&amp;pg=PA207#v=onepage&amp;q=plateau%201878&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.nl/books?id=L11NAAAAcAAJ&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CSur%20un%20nouveau%20genre%20d'illusions%20d'optique%E2%80%9D&amp;pg=PT171#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The medieval [[codex]] ''Sigenot'' (circa 1470) has sequential [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminations]] with relatively short intervals between different phases of action. Each page has a picture inside a frame above the text, with great consistency in size and position throughout the book (with a consistent difference in size for the recto and verso sides of each page).&lt;ref&gt;http://digi.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/diglit/cpg67/0001/thumbs?sid=cf04d0c1f1b9e65a5338bc1a06222e96#/current_page&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (c. 1510) extending over two folios in the Windsor Collection, ''Anatomical Studies of the Muscles of the Neck, Shoulder, Chest, and Arm'', have detailed renderings of the upper body and less-detailed facial features. The sequence shows multiple angles of the figure as it rotates and the arm extends. Because the drawings show only small changes from one image to the next, together they imply the movement of a single figure.

Ancient Chinese records contain several mentions of devices, including one made by the inventor [[Ding Huan]], that were said to "give an impression of movement" to a series of human or animal figures on them,{{sfn|Needham|1962|pp=123–124}} but these accounts are unclear and may only refer to the actual movement of the figures through space.{{sfn|Rojas|2013|page=5}}

Since before 1000 CE the Chinese had a rotating lantern which had silhouettes projected on its thin paper sides that appeared to chase each other. This was called the "trotting horse lamp" [走馬燈] as it would typically depict horses and horse-riders. The cut-out silhouettes were attached inside the lantern to a shaft with a paper vane impeller on top, rotated by heated air rising from a lamp. Some versions added extra motion with jointed heads, feet or hands of figures triggered by a transversely connected iron wire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=Js_lBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;ots=RtAiKy6JSA&amp;dq=%22trotting%20horse%22%20lamp&amp;pg=PA308#v=onepage&amp;q=%22trotting%20horse%22%20lamp&amp;f=false|title=A History of Chinese Science and Technology, Volume 3|author=Yongxiang Lu|pages=308–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Volvelle]]s have moving parts, but these and other paper materials that can be manipulated into motion are usually not regarded as animation.

==Shadow play==
{{main|Shadow play}}
[[File:OFB-Qianlongsatz03-Krieger.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Shadow play]] figures, circa 1780.]]

Shadow play has much in common with animation: people watching moving figures on a screen as a very popular form of entertainment, usually a story with dialogue, sounds and music. The figures could be very detailed and very articulated.

The earliest projection of images was most likely done in primitive [[shadowgraphy (performing art)|shadowgraphy]] dating back to prehistory. It evolved into more refined forms of shadow puppetry, mostly with flat jointed cut-out figures which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen. The shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. The history of shadow puppetry is uncertain, but seems to have originated in Asia, possibly in the 1st millennium BCE. Clearer records seem to go back to around 900 CE. It later spread to the [[Ottoman empire]] and seems not to have reached Europe before the 17th century. It became very popular in France at the end of the 18th century. [[François Dominique Séraphin]] started his elaborate shadow shows in 1771 and performed them until his death in 1800. His heirs continued until their theatre closed in 1870. Séraphin developed the use of [[clockwork]] mechanisms to automate the show.

Around the time [[cinematography]] was developed several theaters in Montmartre showed elaborate "Ombres Chinoises" shows that were very successful. The famous [[Le Chat Noir]] produced 45 different shows between 1885 and 1896.

==The Magic Lantern==
{{main|Magic lantern}}
[[File:1659 huygens - figure1.jpg|thumbnail|Christiaan Huygens' 1659 sketches for a projection of Death taking off his head]]
[[File:Fantoccini-chromatrope.jpg|thumb|Slide with a fantoccini trapeze artist and a chromatrope border design (circa 1880)]]
Moving images were possibly projected with the magic lantern since its invention by [[Christiaan Huygens]] in 1659. His sketches for magic lantern slides have been dated to that year and are the oldest known document concerning the magic lantern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Christiaan|last=Huygens|title=Pour des representations par le moyen de verres convexes à la lampe|url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/huyg003oeuv22_01/huyg003oeuv22_01_0093.php|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; One encircled sketch depicts Death raising his arm from his toes to his head, another shows him moving his right arm up and down from his elbow and yet another taking his skull off his neck and placing it back. Dotted lines indicate the intended movements.

Techniques to add motion to painted glass slides for the magic lantern were described since circa 1700. These usually involved parts (for instance limbs) painted on one or more extra pieces of glass moved by hand or small mechanisms across a stationary slide which showed the rest of the picture.&lt;ref name=Rossell2005&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/341263/The_Magic_Lantern_and_Moving_Images_before_1800|first=Deac|last=Rossell|title=The Magic Lantern and Moving Images before 1800|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular subjects for mechanical slides included the sails of a windmill turning, a procession of figures, a drinking man lowering and raising his glass to his mouth, a head with moving eyes, a nose growing very long, rats jumping in the mouth of a sleeping man. A more complex 19th century rackwork slide showed the then known eight planets and their satellites orbiting around the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.luikerwaal.com/wipwaps01_uk.htm|title=Magic lantern - collection of moving magic lantern slides part 1.|publisher=Luikerwaal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two layers of painted waves on glass could create a convincing illusion of a calm sea turning into a very stormy sea tossing some boats about by increasing the speed of the manipulation of the different parts.

In 1770 [[Edmé-Gilles Guyot]] detailed how to project a magic lantern image on smoke to create a transparent, shimmering image of a hovering ghost. This technique was used in the '''[[phantasmagoria]]''' shows that became very popular in several parts of Europe between 1790 and the 1830s. Other techniques were developed to produce convincing ghost experiences. The lantern was handheld to move the projection across the screen (which was usually an almost invisible transparent screen behind which the lanternist operated hidden in the dark). A ghost could seem to approach the audience or grow larger by moving the lantern away from the screen, sometimes with the lantern on a trolley on rails. Multiple lanterns made ghosts move independently and were occasionally used for [[superimposition]] in the composition of complicated scenes.&lt;ref name=Heard2006&gt;Heard, Mervyn. ''Phantasmagoria: The Secret History of the Magic Lantern''. The Projection Box, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Dissolving views]]''' became a popular magic lantern show, especially in England in the 1830s and 1840s.&lt;ref name=Heard2006/&gt; These typically had a landscape changing from a winter version to a spring or summer variation by slowly diminishing the light from one version while introducing the aligned projection of the other slide.&lt;ref name=luikerdissolve&gt;{{cite web|title=Luikerwaal - Mechanical Slides |url=https://www.luikerwaal.com/newframe_uk.htm?/dissolving_uk.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another use showed the gradual change of for instance groves into cathedrals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|title=The Spectator|date=1835-07-18|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/18th-july-1835/13/the-colosseum|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 1840s and 1870s several abstract magic lantern effects were developed. This included the chromatrope which projected dazzling colorful geometrical patterns by rotating two painted glass discs in opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=N0cxAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=polytechnic%20chromatrope&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=chromatrope&amp;f=false|title=The Athenæum|date=1845-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally small shadow puppets had been used in phantasmagoria shows.&lt;ref name=Heard2006/&gt; Magic lantern slides with jointed figures set in motion by levers, thin rods, or cams and worm wheels were also produced commercially and patented in 1891. A popular version of these "Fantoccini slides" had a somersaulting monkey with arms attached to mechanism that made it tumble with dangling feet. Fantoccini slides are named after the Italian word for puppets like marionettes or jumping jacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.luikerwaal.com/newframe_uk.htm?/fantoccini1_uk.htm|title=Luikerwaal - Fantoccini Slides}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animation before film==
Numerous devices that successfully displayed animated images were introduced well before the advent of the motion picture. These devices were used to entertain, amaze, and sometimes even frighten people. The majority of these devices didn't project their images, and could only be viewed by a one or a few persons at a time. They were considered [[optical toys]] rather than devices for a large scale [[entertainment industry]] like later animation.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} &lt;!-- both Plateau and Stampfer saw possibilities to use their inventions theatrically--&gt; Many of these devices are still built by and for film students learning the basic principles of animation.

===Prelude===
An article in the ''Quarterly Journal of Science, Literature, and The Arts'' (1821)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=https://archive.org/stream/quarterlyjournal10roya#page/282/mode/2up|title=Account of an optical deception|author=J.M.|date=1820-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; raised some interest in optical illusions of curved spokes in rotating wheels seen through vertical apertures. In 1824 [[Peter Mark Roget]] provided mathematical details about the appearing curvatures and added the observation that the spokes appeared motionless. Roget claimed that the illusion is due to the fact “that an impression made by a pencil of rays on the retina, if sufficiently vivid, will remain for a certain time after the cause has ceased.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=http://rstl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/115/131.full.pdf+html|title=Explanation of an optical deception in the appearance of the spokes of a wheel when seen through vertical apertures|date=1824-12-09|last=Roget|first=Peter Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later seen as the basis for the theory of "persistence of vision" as the principle of how we see film as motion rather than the successive stream of still images actually presented to the eye. This theory has been discarded as the (sole) principle of the effect since 1912, but remains in many film history explanations. However, Roget's experiments and explanation did inspire some further research by [[Michael Faraday]] and also by Joseph Plateau that would eventually bring about the invention of animation.
{{main article|Persistence of vision}}

===Thaumatrope (1825)===
{{main article|Thaumatrope}}
In April 1825 the first ''[[thaumatrope]]'' was published by W. Phillips (in anonymous association with [[John Ayrton Paris]]) and became a very popular toy.&lt;ref name="Herbert"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/thaumatropeTEXT1.htm |last=Herbert |first=Stephen |title=Wheel of Life - The Thaumatrope}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pictures on either side of a small cardboard disc seem to blend into one combined image when it is twirled quickly by the attached strings. This is often used as an illustration of what has often been called "persistence of vision" (scientifically better known as [[Afterimage#Positive afterimages|positive afterimages]]). Although a thaumatrope can also be used for two-phase animation, no examples are known to have been produced with this effect until long after the phénakisticope had established the principle of animation.

===Phénakisticope (1833)===
{{main article|phenakistiscope}}
[[File:Prof. Stampfer's Stroboscopische Scheibe No. X.gif|thumb|Nr. 10 in the reworked second series of Stampfer's stroboscopic discs published by Trentsensky &amp; Vieweg in 1833.]]
The [[phenakistiscope|phénakisticope]] (better known by the misspelling phenakistiscope or phenakistoscope) was the first animation device using rapid successive substitution of sequential pictures. The pictures are evenly spaced radially around a disc, with small rectangular apertures at the rim of the disc. The animation could be viewed through the slits of the spinning disc in front of a mirror. It was invented in November or December 1832 by the Belgian [[Joseph Plateau]] and almost simultaneously by the Austrian [[Simon von Stampfer]]. Plateau first published about his invention in January 1833. The publication included an illustration plate of a fantascope with 16 frames depicting a pirouetting dancer.

The phénakisticope was very successful as a novelty toy and within a year very many sets of stroboscopic discs were published across Europe, with almost as many different names for the device - including ''Fantascope'' (Plateau), ''The Stroboscope'' (Stampfer) and ''Phénakisticope'' (Parisian publisher Giroux &amp; Cie).

===Zoetrope (1866)===
{{main article|Zoetrope}}
In July 1833 Simon Stampfer described the possibility of using the stroboscope principle in a cylinder (as well as on looped strips) in a pamphlet accompanying the second edition of his version of the phénakisticope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stampfer|first=Simon|title=Die stroboscopischen Scheiben; oder, Optischen Zauberscheiben: Deren Theorie und wissenschaftliche Anwendung |year=1833 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUk0AQAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=stampfer%20scheiben&amp;pg=PA10-IA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; British mathematician [[William George Horner]] suggested a cylindrical variation of Plateau's phénakisticope in January 1834. Horner planned to publish this ''Dædaleum'' with optician King, Jr in Bristol but it "met with some impediment probably in the sketching of the figures".&lt;ref name="horner-1"&gt;{{cite book |title=The London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science |year=1834 |pages=36 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XmrkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=On+the+Properties+of+the+Daedaleum,+A+New+Instrument+of+Optical+Illusion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=GIznFi88Dq&amp;sig=MKGgcVmFx2hZ6bbCbPaeUV1bmiA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G8kDUJmrO-ih0QWc0d21Bw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865 William Ensign Lincoln invented the definitive zoetrope with easily replaceable strips of images. It also had an illustrated paper disc on the base, which was not always exploited on the commercially produced versions.&lt;ref name="Herbert1"&gt;Herbert, Stephen. (n.d.) [http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/wheelZOETROPEpart1.htm ''From Daedaleum to Zoetrope'', Part 1.] Retrieved 2014-05-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln licensed his invention to [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley and Co.]] who first advertised it on December 15, 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Colman’s rural world |date=December 15, 1866 |pages=366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flip book (1868)===
{{main article|Flip book}}
[[File:Linnet kineograph 1886.jpg|thumb|right|An 1886 illustration of the kineograph.]] [[John Barnes Linnett]] patented the first [[flip book]] in 1868 as the ''kineograph''.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=8}} A flip book is a small book with relatively springy pages, each having one in a series of animation images located near its unbound edge. The user bends all of the pages back, normally with the thumb, then by a gradual motion of the hand allows them to spring free one at a time. As with the phenakistoscope, zoetrope and praxinoscope, the illusion of motion is created by the apparent sudden replacement of each image by the next in the series, but unlike those other inventions no view-interrupting shutter or assembly of mirrors is required and no viewing device other than the user's hand is absolutely necessary. Early film animators cited flip books as their inspiration more often than the earlier devices, which did not reach as wide an audience.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|page=7}}

The older devices by their nature severely limit the number of images that can be included in a sequence without making the device very large or the images impractically small. The book format still imposes a physical limit, but many dozens of images of ample size can easily be accommodated. Inventors stretched even that limit with the [[mutoscope]], patented in 1894 and sometimes still found in amusement arcades. It consists of a large circularly-bound flip book in a housing, with a viewing lens and a crank handle that drives a mechanism that slowly rotates the assembly of images past a catch, sized to match the running time of an entire reel of film.

===Praxinoscope (1877)===
{{main article|Praxinoscope}}
French inventor [[Charles-Émile Reynaud]] developed the [[praxinoscope]] in 1876 and patented it in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;http://emilereynaud.fr/index.php/post/Le-Praxinoscope&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to the zoetrope but instead of the slits in the cylinder it has twelve rectangular mirrors placed evenly around the center of the cylinder. Each mirror reflects another image of the picture strip placed opposite on the inner wall of the cylinder. When rotating the praxinoscope shows the sequential images one by one, resulting in a fluent animation. The praxinoscope allowed a much clearer view of the moving image compared to the zoetrope, since the zoetrope's images were actually mostly obscured by the spaces in between its slits. In 1879 Reynaude registered a modification to the praxinoscope patent to include the ''Praxinoscope Théâtre'', which utilized the [[Pepper's ghost]] effect to present the animated figures in an exchangeable background. Later improvements included the "Praxinoscope à projection" (marketed since 1882) which used a double magic lantern to project the animated figures over a till projection of a background.&lt;ref&gt;http://emilereynaud.fr/index.php/post/Le-Praxinoscope-a-projection&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoopraxiscope (1879)===
{{main article|Zoopraxiscope}}
Eadweard Muybridge had circa 70 of his famous [[chronophotography|chronophotographic]] sequences painted on glass discs for the [[zoopraxiscope]] projector that he used in his popular lectures between 1880 and 1895. In the 1880s the images were painted onto the glass in dark contours. Later discs made between 1892 and 1894 had outlines drawn by Erwin F. Faber that were photographically printed on the disc and then coloured by hand, but these were probably never used in the lectures. The painted figures were largely transposed from the photographs, but many fanciful combinations were made and sometimes imaginary elements were added.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/mZoo.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200246/museum_collections_and_exhibitions/539/eadweard_muybridge/3&lt;/ref&gt;

==1888-1908: Earliest animations on film==
===Théâtre Optique===
{{main article|Théâtre Optique}}
[[File:Pauvre Pierrot (Emile Reynaud, 1892).mp4.webm|thumb|right|Part of the restored ''Pauvre Pierrot'' film]]
[[Charles-Émile Reynaud]] further developed his projection praxinoscope into the [[Théâtre Optique]] with transparent hand-painted colorful pictures in a long perforated strip wound between two spools, patented in December 1888. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900 Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500.000 visitors at the [[Musée Grévin]] in Paris. His ''Pantomimes Lumineuses'' series of animated films each contained 300 to 700 frames that were manipulated back and forth to last 10 to 15 minutes per film. A background scene was projected separately. Piano music, song and some dialogue were performed live, while some sound effects were synchronized with an electromagnet. The first program included three cartoons: ''[[Pauvre Pierrot]]'' (created in 1891), ''[[Un bon bock]]'' (created in 1888, now lost), and ''[[Le Clown et ses chiens]]'' (created in 1890, now lost). Later on the titles ''[[Autour d'une cabine ]]'' (created in 1893) and ''A rêve au coin du feu'' would be part of the performances.

===Standard picture film===
Despite the success of Reynaud's films it took some time before animation was adapted in the film industry that came about after the introduction of Lumiere's [[Cinematograph]] in 1895. [[Georges Méliès]]' early fantasy and [[trick film]]s (released between 1896 and 1913) occasionally came close to including animation with [[substitution splice]] effects, painted props or painted creatures that were moved in front of painted backgrounds (mostly using wires), and [[film colorization]] by hand. Méliès also popularized the [[stop trick]], with a single change made to the scene in between shots, that had already been used in Edison's ''[[The Execution of Mary Stuart]]'' in 1895 and probably led to the development of stop-motion animation some years later.&lt;ref name=Cohl/&gt; It seems to have lasted until 1906 before proper animated films started to appear in cinemas. The dating of earlier films with animation is contested, while other films that may have used stop motion or other animation techniques are lost and can't be checked. 

====Printed animation film====
In 1897 German toy manufacturer [[Bing (company)|Gebrüder Bing]] had a first prototype of their kinematograph.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zinnfiguren-bleifiguren.com/Firmengeschichten/Bing/Bing.html#Top&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1898 they presented this toy film projector, possibly the first of its kind, at a toy festival in Leipzig. Soon other toy manufacturers, including Ernst Plank and Georges Carette, sold similar devices. Around the same time the French company Lapierre marketed a similar projector. The toy cinematographs were basically magic lanterns with one or two small spools that used standard "Edison perforation" 35mm film. These projectors were intended for the same type of "home entertainment" toy market that most of these manufacturers already provided with praxinoscopes and toy magic lanterns. Apart from relatively expensive live-action films, the manufacturers produced many cheaper films by printing lithographed drawings. These animations were probably made in black-and-white from around 1898 or 1899, but at the latest by 1902 they were made in color. The pictures were often traced from live-action films (much like the later [[rotoscoping]] technique). These very short films depicted a simple repetitive action and were created to be projected as a loop - playing endlessly with the film ends put together. The lithograph process and the loop format follow the tradition that was set by the zoetrope and praxinoscope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|last= Litten

[[File:Katsudō Shashin (1907).webm|thumb|alt=Brief animated film of a boy removing his hat and waving.|''Katsudō Shashin'']]

''[[Katsudō Shashin]]'', from an unknown creator, was discovered in 2005 and is speculated to be the oldest work of [[anime|animation in Japan]], with Natsuki Matsumoto,{{refn|{{lang|ja|松本 夏樹}}, b.&amp;nbsp;1952|group=Note}}{{sfn|Matsumoto|2011|p=98}} an expert in [[iconography]] at the [[Osaka University of Arts]]{{sfn|Clements|McCarthy|2006|p=169}} and animation historian Nobuyuki Tsugata{{refn|{{lang|ja|津堅 信之}}, b.&amp;nbsp;1968|group=Note}} determining the film was most likely made between 1907 and 1911.{{sfn|López|2012|p=584}} The film consists of a series of cartoon images on fifty frames of a [[celluloid]] strip and lasts three seconds at sixteen [[Frame rate|frames per second]].{{sfn|Anime News Network staff|2005}} It depicts a young boy in a [[sailor suit]] who writes the [[kanji]] characters "{{lang|ja|活動写真}}" (''katsudō shashin'', or "moving picture"), then turns towards the viewer, removes his hat, and offers a salute.{{sfn|Anime News Network staff|2005}} Evidence suggests it was mass-produced to be sold to wealthy owners of home projectors.{{sfn|Matsumoto|2011|pp=116–117}} To Matsumoto, the relatively poor quality and low-tech printing technique indicate it was likely from a smaller film company.{{sfn|Litten|2014|p=15}}

====J. Stuart Blackton====
[[J. Stuart Blackton]] was a British-American filmmaker, co-founder of the [[Vitagraph Studios]] and one of the first to use animation in his films.''[[The Enchanted Drawing]]'' (1900) by is considered to be the first film recorded on [[standard picture film]] that included some sequences that are sometimes regarded as animation. It shows Blackton doing some "lightning sketches" of a face, cigars, a bottle of wine and a glass. The face changes expression when Blackton pours some wine into the face's mouth and takes his cigar. The technique used in this film was basically the substitution splice: the single change to scenes was that a drawing was replaced by a similar drawing with a different facial expression (or a drawn bottle and glass were replaced by real objects). Blackton had possibly used the same technique in a lost 1896 lightning sketch film.&lt;ref name=Cohl&gt;https://books.google.nl/books?id=GBUABAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA128&amp;dq=%22enchanted%20drawing%22%20melies&amp;pg=PA128#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The effect can hardly be considered animation.
[[File:Humorous Phases of Funny Faces.ogg|thumb|The 1906 cartoon ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' by [[J. Stuart Blackton]], considered the first animated film]] 
Blackton's 1906 film ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' is often regarded as the oldest known drawn animation on standard film. It features a sequence made with blackboard drawings that are changed between frames to show two faces changing expressions and some billowing cigar smoke, as well as two sequences that feature [[cutout animation]]. 

Blackton's ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907) featured a combination of live-action with practical [[special effects]] and stop-motion animation of objects, a puppet and a model of the haunted hotel. It was the first stop-motion film to receive wide scale appreciation. Especially a large close-up view of a table being set by itself baffled viewers; there were no visible wires or other noticeable well-known tricks. {{sfn|Crafton|1993|page=11}} This inspired other filmmakers, including French animator [[Émile Cohl]]&lt;ref name=Cohl/&gt; and Segundo de Chomón, to work with the new technique. De Chomón would release the similar ''[[La maison ensorcelée|The House of Ghosts]]'' and ''[[El hotel eléctrico]]'' in 1908.

====Edwin S. Porter====
In 1905 American film pioneer [[Edwin S. Porter]] used animated letters and a very simple cutout animation of two hands in the [[intertitle]]s in ''How Jones lost his roll''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wt4V6j1EsI&lt;/ref&gt; He experimented with a small bit of crude stop-motion animation in his trick film ''[[Dream of a Rarebit Fiend (1906 film)|Dream of a Rarebit Fiend]]'' (1906). His 1907 film ''The "Teddy" Bears'' mainly shows people in bear costumes, but also features a short stop-motion segment with small teddy bears.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edwin-S-Porter&lt;/ref&gt;

====Segundo de Chomón====
Spanish filmmaker [[Segundo de Chomón]] made many trick films and has often been compared to Georges Méliès. De Chomón frequently used stop-motion in his films, even before the release of J. Stuart Blackton's groundbreaking ''The Haunted Hotel''. ''Le théâtre de Bob'' (1906) features over three minutes of stop-motion animation with dolls and some objects. ''El hotel eléctrico'' (1908) features much stop motion with objects, a bit of [[pixilation]] and one effect done with drawn animation (a few lines probably drawn on the negative that represent electric sparks).

====Arthur Melbourne-Cooper====
[[Arthur Melbourne-Cooper]] was a British filmmaker who did much pioneering work in stop motion animation. He produced over 300 films between 1896 and 1915, of which an estimated 36 were all or in part animated. 

Based on later reports by Cooper and by his daughter Audrey Wadowska some believe that his ''Matches: an Appeal'' was produced in 1899 and therefore the very first stop-motion animation. The black-and-white film shows a matchstick figure writing an appeal to donate a [[Guinea (coin)|Guinea]] for which [[Bryant and May]] would supply soldiers with sufficient matches. No extant archival records show that the film was indeed created in 1899 during the beginning of the [[Second Boer War]]. Others place it at 1914, during the beginning of [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eafa.org.uk/catalogue/215258&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.nl/books?id=6nWBD_raPKoC&amp;lpg=PA449&amp;ots=gie5_agCj9&amp;dq=cooper%20%22humpty%20dumpty%20circus%22&amp;pg=PA281#v=onepage&amp;q=matches%20an%20appeal&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper created more ''Animated Matches'' scenes in the same setting. These are believed to also have been produced in 1899&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eafa.org.uk/catalogue/2088&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eafa.org.uk/catalogue/2088&lt;/ref&gt;, while a release date of 1908 has also been given.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1254199/reference&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an ''Animated Matches'' film by Émile Cohl that was released by Gaumont in 1908,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139826/reference&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.hb0sep;view=1up;seq=285&lt;/ref&gt; which may have caused more confusion about the release dates of Cooper's matchstick men animations. 

The lost films ''Dolly's Toys'' (1901) and ''The Enchanted Toymaker'' (1904) may have included stop-motion animation.&lt;ref name=Cohl/&gt; ''Dreams of Toyland'' (1908) features a scene with many animated toys that lasts circa three and a half minutes.

==Traditional animation==
===The silent era===
[[File:Fantasmagorie (Cohl).GIF|thumb|300px|The first animated film created by using what came to be known as [[traditional animation|traditional (hand-drawn) animation]]—the 1908 ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' by [[Émile Cohl]]]]
[[File:Emile Cohl - Fantasmagorie 1908 - YouTube.theora.ogv|thumb|right|[[Émile Cohl]]'s ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]]]''
The French artist [[Émile Cohl]] created the first animated film using what came to be known as [[traditional animation]] methods: the 1908 ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]''.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|pp=17–18}} The film largely consisted of a [[stick figure]] moving about and encountering all manner of morphing objects, such as a wine bottle that transforms into a flower. There were also sections of live action where the animator’s hands would enter the scene. The film was created by drawing each frame on paper and then shooting each frame onto [[negative film]], which gave the picture a blackboard look. Cohl later went to [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]] near New York City in 1912, where he worked for French studio Éclair and spread its animation technique to the US.

Influenced by Émile Cohl, the author of the first [[puppet]]-animated film (i.e., The Beautiful Lukanida (1912)), Russian-born (ethnically [[Poles|Polish]]) director Wladyslaw Starewicz, known as [[Ladislas Starevich]], started to create stop motion films using dead [[insects]] with wire limbs and later, in France, with complex and really expressive puppets. In 1912, he created ''[[The Cameraman's Revenge]]'', a complex tale of [[treason]] and [[violence]] between several different insects. It is a pioneer work of [[puppet animation]], and the oldest animated film of such dramatic complexity, with characters filled with motivation, desire and feelings.

[[File:Gertie the Dinosaur.ogv|thumb|left|thumbtime=07:40|alt=Animated film of a trained dinosaur.|''Gertie the Dinosaur'' (1914)]]
More detailed hand-drawn animations with detailed backgrounds and characters, were those directed by [[Winsor McCay]], a successful newspaper cartoonist, including the 1911 ''[[Little Nemo (1911 film)|Little Nemo]]'', the 1914 ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'', and the 1918 ''[[The Sinking of the Lusitania]]''.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=14–19}}{{sfn|Crafton|1993|page=116}} ''[[Gertie the Dinosaur]]'' featured an early example of character development in drawn animation.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=17}} The film was made for McCay's vaudeville act and as it played McCay would speak to Gertie who would respond with a series of gestures. There was a scene at the end of the film where McCay walked behind the projection screen and a view of him appears on the screen showing him getting on the cartoon dinosaur's back and riding out of frame. This scene made ''Gertie the Dinosaur'' the first film to combine live-action footage with hand-drawn animation. McCay hand-drew almost every one of the 10,000 drawings he used for the film.&lt;ref name="Crandol"&gt;{{cite web|last=Crandol|first=Michael|title=The History of Animation: Advantages and Disadvantages of the Studio System in the Production of an Art Form|url=http://www.digitalmediafx.com/Features/animationhistory.html|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1914, [[John Randolph Bray|John Bray]] opened [[Bray Productions|John Bray Studios]], which revolutionized the way animation was created.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=22–23}} [[Earl Hurd]], one of Bray's employees patented the [[cel technique]].{{sfn|Crafton|1993|pp=153–154}} This involved animating moving objects on transparent celluloid sheets.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=150}} Animators photographed the sheets over a stationary background image to generate the sequence of images. This, as well as Bray's innovative use of the assembly line method, allowed John Bray Studios to create [[Colonel Heeza Liar]], the first animated series.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=24–26}}&lt;ref name="McLaughlin"&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin |first=Dan |title=A Rather Incomplete but Still Fascinating History of Animation |url=http://animation.filmtv.ucla.edu/NewSite/WebPages/Histories.html |publisher=UCLA |year=2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119055944/http://animation.filmtv.ucla.edu/NewSite/WebPages/Histories.html |archive-date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=18 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1910s, the production of animated short films, typically referred to as "cartoons", became an industry of its own and cartoon shorts were produced for showing in [[movie theaters]]. The most successful producer at the time was [[John Randolph Bray]], who, along with [[animator]] [[Earl Hurd]], patented the [[Traditional animation#Cels|cel animation]] process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the decade.{{sfn|Crafton|1993|pages=152–154}}

In 1915, [[Max Fleischer|Max]] and [[Dave Fleischer]] invented [[rotoscoping]], the process of using film as a reference point for animation and their studios went on to later release such animated classics as ''[[Ko-Ko the Clown]]'', ''[[Betty Boop]]'', ''[[Popeye the Sailor Man]]'', and ''[[Superman]]''. In 1918 McCay released ''The Sinking of the Lusitania'', a wartime propaganda film. McCay did use some of the newer animation techniques, such as cels over paintings—but because he did all of his animation by himself, the project wasn't actually released until just shortly before the end of the war.&lt;ref name="McLaughlin"/&gt; At this point the larger scale animation studios were becoming the industrial norm and artists such as McCay faded from the public eye.&lt;ref name="Crandol"/&gt;

[[File:FelixTheCat-1919-FelineFollies silent.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=2|The 1919 ''Feline Follies'' by Pat Sullivan]]

The first known animated [[feature film]] was ''[[El Apóstol]]'', made in 1917 by [[Quirino Cristiani]] from [[Argentina]].{{sfn|Finkielman|2004|p=20}} He also directed two other animated feature films, including 1931's ''[[Peludópolis]]'', the first feature length animation to use synchronized sound. None of these, however, survived.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1996}}{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=25}}&lt;ref name="Quirio Cristiani's page Spanish"&gt;[http://www.quirinocristiani.com.ar/ Quirio Cristiani's page (Spanish)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, [[Otto Messmer]] of [[Pat Sullivan Studios]] created [[Felix the Cat]]. [[Pat Sullivan (film producer)|Pat Sullivan]], the studio head took all of the credit for Felix, a common practice in the early days of studio animation.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=27–28}} Felix the Cat was distributed by [[Paramount Studios]], and it attracted a large audience.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=34}} Felix was the first cartoon to be merchandised. He soon became a household name.

In [[Germany]], during the 1920s the [[abstract animation]] was invented by Walter Ruttman, [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], and [[Oskar Fischinger]], however, the [[Nazism|Nazis]] censorship against so-called "[[degenerate art]]" prevented the abstract animation from developing after 1933.

The earliest surviving animated feature film is the 1926 silhouette-animated ''[[Adventures of Prince Achmed]]'', which used [[film tinting|colour-tinted film]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=44}} It was directed by German [[Lotte Reiniger]] and French/Hungarian [[Berthold Bartosch]].{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=83}}

===Walt Disney &amp; Warner Bros.===
In 1923, a studio called [[Laugh-O-Grams]] went bankrupt and its owner, [[Walt Disney]], opened a new studio in Los Angeles. Disney's first project was the ''[[Alice Comedies]]'' series, which featured a live action girl interacting with numerous cartoon characters.{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=29, 35}} Disney's first notable breakthrough was 1928's ''[[Steamboat Willie]]'', the third of the [[Mickey Mouse]] series.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=40–41}} The short film showed an [[anthropomorphic]] mouse named [[Mickey Mouse|Mickey]] neglecting his work on a [[steamboat]] to instead make music using the animals aboard the boat.{{sfn|Maltin|1980|p=34}} Even though many wrongly believe Steamboat Willie was the first cartoon with synchronized sound, since May 1924 and continuing through September 1926, Dave and Max Fleischer's Inkwell Studios produced 19 sound cartoons, part of the Song Car-Tunes series, using the Phonofilm "[[sound-on-film]]" process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Steamboat Willie]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=January 2018}}

In 1933, [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Warner Brothers Cartoons]] was founded. While Disney's studio was known for its releases being strictly controlled by Walt Disney himself, Warner brothers allowed its animators more freedom, which allowed for their animators to develop more recognizable personal styles.&lt;ref name="Crandol"/&gt;

The first animation to use the full, three-color [[Technicolor]] method was ''[[Flowers and Trees]],'' made in 1932 by Disney Studios, which won an [[Academy Award]] for the work.&lt;ref name="Animated Films Part 100000"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dirks|first=Tim| url=http://www.filmsite.org/animatedfilms.html | title=Animated Films Part 1 | publisher=AMC Networks |website=filmsite.org | accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Color animation soon became the industry standard, and in 1934, Warner Brothers released ''[[Honeymoon Hotel (1934 film)|Honeymoon Hotel]]'' of the [[Merrie Melodies]] series, their first color films.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=101}} Meanwhile, Disney had realized that the success of animated films depended upon telling emotionally gripping stories; he developed an innovation called a "story department" where [[storyboard artist]]s separate from the animators would focus on story development alone, which proved its worth when the Disney studio released in 1933 the first-ever animated short to feature well-developed characters, ''[[Three Little Pigs (film)|Three Little Pigs]]''.{{sfn|Lee|2012|pages=55–56}}{{sfn|Krasniewicz|2010|pages=60–64}}{{sfn|Gabler|2007|pages=181–189}} In 1935, [[Tex Avery]] released his first film with Warner Brothers.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=101}} Avery's style was notably fast-paced, violent, and satirical, with a slapstick sensibility.{{sfn|Maltin|1980|p=250}}

===''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''===
Many consider Walt Disney's 1937 ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' the first animated feature film, though at least [[List of animated feature films before 1940|seven films]] were released earlier.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|p=61–62}} However, Disney's film was the first one completely made using hand-drawn animation. The previous seven films, of which only four survive, were made using [[cutout animation|cutout]], [[silhouette animation|silhouette]] or [[stop motion]], except for one—also made by Disney seven months prior to Snow White's release—''[[Academy Award Review of Walt Disney Cartoons]]''. This was an [[anthology film]] to promote the upcoming release of Snow White. However, many do not consider this a genuine feature film because it is a [[Anthology film|package film]]. In addition, at approximately 41 minutes, the film does not seem to fulfill today's expectations for a [[feature film]]. However, the official [[British Film Institute|BFI]], [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|AMPAS]] and [[American Film Institute|AFI]] definitions of a feature film require that it be over 40 minutes long, which, in theory, should make it the first animated feature film using traditional animation.

But as Snow White was also the first one to become successful and well-known within the English-speaking world, people tend to disregard the seven films. Following Snow White's release, Disney began to focus much of its productive force on feature-length films. Though Disney did continue to produce shorts throughout the century, Warner Brothers continued to focus on features.

===The television era===

[[Color television]] was introduced to the US Market in 1954.  In 1958, [[Hanna-Barbera]] released ''[[The Huckleberry Hound Show]]'', the first half-hour television program to feature only animation.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=234}} [[Terrytoons]] released ''[[Tom Terrific]]'' the same year.{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=136}}{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=61}} In 1960, Hanna-Barbera released another monumental animated television show, ''[[The Flintstones]]'', which was the first animated series on prime time television.{{sfn|Solomon|1989|pp=239–240}} Television significantly decreased public attention to the animated shorts being shown in theatres.

==Animation techniques==
Innumerable approaches to creating animation have arisen throughout the years.  Here is a brief account of some of the non traditional techniques commonly incorporated.

===Stop motion===
This process is used for many productions, for example, the most common types of puppets are clay puppets, as used in ''[[The California Raisins]]'', ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]'' and ''[[Shaun the Sheep]]'' by [[Aardman]], and figures made of various rubbers, cloths and plastic resins, such as ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and ''[[James and the Giant Peach]]''. Sometimes even objects are used, such as with the films of [[Jan Švankmajer]].

Stop motion animation was also commonly used for special effects work in many live-action films, such as the 1914 Italian cult epic film ''[[Cabiria]]'', the [[King Kong (1933 film)|1933 version of ''King Kong'']] and ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]''.

===CGI animation===
The first fully computer-animated feature film was [[Pixar]]'s ''[[Toy Story]]'' (1995).{{sfn|Beckerman|2003|p=83–84}} The process of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] animation is still very tedious and similar in that sense to traditional animation, and it still adheres to many of the same principles.

A principal difference of CGI animation compared to traditional animation is that drawing is replaced by 3D modeling, almost like a virtual version of stop-motion. A form of animation that combines the two and uses 2D computer drawing can be considered computer ''aided'' animation.

Most CGI created films are based on animal characters, monsters, machines, or cartoon-like humans. Animation studios are now trying to develop ways to create realistic-looking humans. Films that have attempted this include ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'' in 2001, ''[[Final Fantasy: Advent Children]]'' in 2005, ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]'' in 2004, ''[[Beowulf (2007 film)|Beowulf]]'' in 2007 and ''[[Resident Evil: Degeneration]]'' in 2009. However, due to the complexity of human body functions, emotions and interactions, this method of animation is rarely used. The more realistic a CG character becomes, the more difficult it is to create the nuances and details of a living person, and the greater the likelihood of the character falling into the [[uncanny valley]]. The creation of hair and clothing that move convincingly with the animated human character is another area of difficulty. ''[[The Incredibles]]'' and ''[[Up (2009 film)|Up]]'' both have humans as protagonists, while films like ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' combine animation with live action to create humanoid creatures.

Cel-[[Shader|shading]] is a type of [[non-photorealistic rendering]] intended to make [[computer graphics]] appear hand-drawn. It is often used to mimic the style of a [[comic book]] or [[cartoon]]. It is a somewhat recent addition to computer graphics, most commonly turning up in [[video game console|console]] video games. Though the end result of cel-shading has a very simplistic feel like that of [[traditional animation|hand-drawn animation]], the process is complex. The name comes from the clear sheets of acetate (originally, celluloid), called [[cel]]s, that are painted on for use in traditional 2D animation. It may be considered a "[[2.5D]]" form of animation. True real-time cel-shading was first introduced in 2000 by [[Sega]]'s ''[[Jet Set Radio]]'' for their [[Dreamcast]] console. Besides video games, a number of anime have also used this style of animation, such as ''[[Freedom Project]]'' in 2006.

[[Machinima]] is the use of real-time [[3D computer graphics]] [[3D rendering|rendering]] engines to create a cinematic production. Most often, [[video game]]s are used to generate the [[computer animation]]. Machinima-based artists, sometimes called '''machinimists''' or '''machinimators''', are often [[fan labor]]ers, by virtue of their re-use of copyrighted materials.

===History of Malaysian Animation===

Animation in Malaysia began in 1946 with the establishment of the Malayan Film Unit (now known as National Film). The first short animated film was the Hikayat Sang Kancil (Anandam Xavier, 1978) and aired in 1983. Short films that appeared between 1985 and 1987 were: The Mouse &amp; Monkey, The Mouse &amp; Crocodile, The Crow Rage, the Rabbit Arrogant and the Lion of Haloba made by Hassan Abdul Muthalib.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.negaraku.com/cerita/hassan-mutalib-pelopor-animasi-malaysia| title = Hassan Abd.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12066">'''Israeli–Palestinian Comedy Tour''' was founded in November 2006 by [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] comedian and columnist Ray Hanania and [[Israelis|Israeli]] comedian and online Podcaster Charley Warady. [[Arab-American]] [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] comedian and award-winning journalist [[Ray Hanania]] and his companions from the ''Israeli–Palestinian Comedy Tour'' operate under the slogan: "If we can laugh together, we can live together".&lt;ref name="If we can laugh together, we can live together"/&gt;

Warady and Hanania grew up in the same Chicago neighborhood, [[Pill Hill, Chicago|Pill Hill]]/South Shore Valley in the 1960s. Warady discovered Hanania while exploring the internet for references to Pill Hill and found Hanania's online book "Midnight Flight: The Story of White Flight in Chicagoland" (2000, Online, www.hanania.com). When Warady contacted Hanania and identified himself as an Israeli comedian, Hanania challenged Warady to appear on the same comedy stage with a Palestinian comedian to challenge the animosity enveloping both their peoples. Warady and Hanania arranged the first-ever Palestinian-Israeli comedy tour in the world, with four shows in Israel and one show in East Jerusalem in January 2007. The shows were internationally acclaimed{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} and the duo organized a second tour of Israel and the Palestinian territories in June 2007. The comedians are joined by Aaron Freeman, a veteran of Second City in Chicago and an African American convert to Judaism, and by [[Yisrael Campbell]], a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jewish]] convert from Catholicism.

==The tour==
[[File:Israeli-Palestinian-Comedy Tour @Tzavta, Tel-Aviv 27-01-2007.jpg|250px|thumb|The members of Israeli–Palestinian Comedy Tour Charley Warady (American born Jew, migrated to Israel), [[Ray Hanania]] (American born Palestinian), [[Aaron Freeman]] (African-American born Catholic, converted to Judaism), [[Yisrael Campbell]] (American born Catholic, converted to Judaism and migrated to Israel).]]
''Israeli–Palestinian Comedy Tour'' is the show of an American-Palestinian Ray Hanania and three [[Jewish]] comedians Charley Warady, [[Aaron Freeman]] and [[Yisrael Campbell]], two of whom live in [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=humor/&gt;

The MidEastWeb Directory of Middle East Israel-Palestine Information Resources provides links to such shows. It says about ''"Israeli–Palestinian Comedy Tour"'': [it is] "To make you laugh. To make you think. To help end conflict in the middle east." It further describes ''"Stand Up For Peace"'' as "Scott Blakeman and Dean Obeidallah founded and produce Stand up For Peace, which presents Jewish and Arab-American comedians standing together for a non-violent, political solution to the Middle East crisis."&lt;ref name=directory/&gt; "The American Muslim" journal ("TAM") mentions both shows as "general good news" "for Muslims in 2007" &lt;ref name="TAM" /&gt;

The comedians perform around the world. The stage name of the group (officially ''Israeli–Palestinian Comedy Tour'') changes depending on the place the show is given. While in [[West Bank]] they are known as ''"Ray Hanania And Three Hostages"'', in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] they made it simpler - ''"The Four Hostages"''. When they give shows in [[United States of America]], they are ''"Three Jews And An Arab"'', and in Israel they are back to their official name.&lt;ref name=levantinecenter/&gt;  All of them support the [[Two-state solution]], but their opinions on the controversial issues about the status of [[East Jerusalem]] and other issues alike are not clearly expressed.&lt;ref name=levantinecenter/&gt;

All their performances are filled with sparkling jokes, [[satire]] and humor about [[Middle East conflict]] that many believe is not a laughing matter. Comedians disagree. They believe that the laughter could lead to a better understanding between the opposite sides of the conflict.&lt;ref name=art/&gt;

Some of their jokes are prepared before the show while others are just improvisations as the show progresses. Once at the beginning of the show given in one of the [[Chicago]] [[synagogue]]s with mostly Jewish audience Hanania asked innocently: "How many Arabs are here tonight?" He held a pause during which the silent spectators looked puzzled ... and then exclaimed: "Great security!" And the laughing erupted.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;

No joke is off-limits no matter how politically incorrect it might be. Waraday starts on [[Houri#72 virgins|72 virgins]] in connection to [[suicide bombing]]s. He asks what [http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3331878,00.html 57-year-old] [[menopausal]] grandmother who blew herself up not so long ago hoped to get in the Arab paradise:

{{quote|What would they possibly have told this woman — that she'll have 72 kids who'll call every day and visit once in a while? I know my Mom would blow herself up for that.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;}}

Hanania together with his companion reasons: 

{{quote|I'm an Arab, so we read from right to left. There's only one virgin, she's 72 years old, and they promise her to everybody. That ain't paradise."&lt;ref name=humor/&gt;&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;}}

While performing in Syndrome Theater in [[Jerusalem]] Hanania shared the story about his wedding ceremony with his Jewish bride: 

{{quote|We had 900 people, we only sent out 24 invitations ... We had all the Arabs on one side, all the Jews on the other side. We didn't have a bridal party. We had a U.N. Peacekeeping Force right down the middle, on the Arab side of course".&lt;ref name=levantinecenter/&gt;}}

When asked how he became involved with three Jewish comedians and [[Jewish humor]] Hanania jokingly responded: "These guys stole our land, our homes, so I read a couple of books on Jewish humor, and I stole their jokes."&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

Comparing Israeli check points to toll plazas Charley Warady describes his experience with those:

{{quote|The first time I drove through a checkpoint I just threw some change at them out the window and drove through... . until they shot at me. I didn't know they'd shoot at me for not giving exact change.&lt;ref name=review/&gt;}}

Explaining how voters in Gaza ended up electing [[Hamas]] he says:

{{quote|Arabic is very hard to read ... instead of Hamas and Fatah, Palestinian's thought they were voting for [[Hummus]] or [[Pita]]. And hey, anyone can make a good Pita, but a good Hummus is hard to make.&lt;ref name=review/&gt;}}

Aaron Freeman jokes that "in the Comedy Tour all the Jews get along with "Ray", but they all fight with each other."&lt;ref name=review/&gt;

===Israeli Palestinian Comedians re-launch ===

Ray Hanania, Aaron Freeman Yisrael Campbell and Charley Warady revived the early comedy effort to bring everyone together with a new coalition of Palestinians and Muslims who are willing to work not just with Jews, but also Israelis, and Israelis who are willing to work not just with Muslims and Arabs but with Palestinians, the most difficult hurdle to overcome. The new coalition includes many more comedians including Ray's Jewish son, Aaron Hanania, and Palestinian Muslim Mona Aburmishan, Muslim Pakistani Arif Choudhury, Israeli Benji Lovett, and Jewish comic Larry Bloom.

The Israeli Palestinian Comedy troupe is the most mixed Arab-Jewish, Palestinian-Israeli, Muslim, Christian and Jewish group performing. Their motto remains "If we can laugh together, we can live together." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.IsraeliPalestinianComedy.com The original Israeli Palestinian Comedy team]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Arab-Israeli comedy performances==

===Stand Up For Peace===
''Stand Up For Peace'' is the name of the show performed by two men: a Jew Scott Blakeman and an Arab [[Dean Obeidallah]]. The men perform separately talking about everything from [[Patriot act]] to [[terrorism]] and [[September 11 attacks]]. They like performing in front of students. After performance they take questions together.&lt;ref name=Hatchet/&gt;

===Nabil and Hisham===
During the 1990s, following the conclusion of the Oslo agreement and the Israeli-Jordanian Peace Treaty, two Jordanian artists - Nabil Sawalha and Hisham Yanes - established the duo '''Nabil and Hisham''', which performed in Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.obs-us.com/obs/english/books/mem/n01a06.htm A comedy team that keeps Jordan laughing]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1996, NBC announced that the series had been canceled after finishing 79th in the ratings, leaving one episode unaired. In December 1996, the rival network CBS announced it had picked up the series for a [[mid-season replacement]] original 15 completed episodes from its second season. For several seasons, ''JAG'' climbed in the ratings and ultimately ran for nine additional seasons. ''JAG'' furthermore spawned the hit series ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'', which in turn led to spin-offs ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' and ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]''.

In total, 227 episodes were produced over 10 seasons. At the time of the original airing of its fifth season in the United States, ''JAG'' was seen in over 90 countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paramount.com/television/jag/abouttheshow/index.html |title=JAG - About the show |accessdate=2000-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001110063400/http://www.paramount.com/television/jag/abouttheshow/index.html |archivedate=November 10, 2000 |df= }}.

==Production==

===Background and development===
The creator of ''JAG'', Donald P. Bellisario, served for four years in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]], and after having worked his way up through advertising jobs, he landed his first network television job as a story editor for the World War II-era series ''[[Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series)|Baa Baa Black Sheep]]'', where he got a habit of promoting a consistent promilitary stance in a business where he got the perception that "antiwar" and "antisoldier" mentality were the commonplace.&lt;ref name="Erickson:127"&gt;[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotype in the post-[[Vietnam war]] era of "[[Vietnam Veteran#Negative stereotypes of Vietnam veterans and efforts to overcome|crazed Vietnam veterans]]" was notably subverted, by not just one, but three of the main characters, in ''[[Magnum P.I.]]'', of which Bellisario was the co-creator.&lt;ref name="Erickson:127"/&gt; 
Following the cancellation of his series ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'', Bellisario began working on a one-shot screenplay of a murder mystery aboard a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, where the victim was a female aviator.&lt;ref name="Erickson:127"/&gt;

The issue of whether or not to expand the options for women serving in the U.S. armed forces as fighter pilots and in other frontline assignments was a contentious social issue of the day. In 1991, a famous incident had occurred at the [[Tailhook Association]] [[Tailhook scandal|convention in Las Vegas]], where male naval aviators had behaved in manners inappropriate, if not criminal, and where the follow-up criminal and other investigations by the [[Naval Investigative Service|then-named NIS]], the [[Naval Inspector General]], and the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, were later heavily criticized by the [[Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense]], with the concurrence to [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Acting Secretary of the Navy]] [[Sean O'Keefe]], to whom the report was delivered and who began to take corrective action with respect to both the perceived attitude problems towards women and the functions of the investigative arms of the Department of the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | date = 1992-09-24 | title = Defense Department News Briefing | url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/DefenseDepartmentNewsBriefing71 | accessdate = 2013-09-19 | format = Television production | publisher = [[C-SPAN]] | ref = WIC | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130920193630/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/DefenseDepartmentNewsBriefing71 | archivedate = September 20, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The fallout from the incident resulted in a hard blow to the [[Naval aviation|naval aviation community]], where the promotions of many [[naval aviator]]s were put on hold. The common counterclaim from the other side of the aisle, as articulated by former Secretary of the Navy in the [[Reagan administration]] and [[naval flight officer]] [[John F. Lehman]], was that the naval aviation community had been unfairly subjected to a witch-hunt motivated by [[political correctness]], in effect killing its ''esprit de corps'', and by extension damaging its combat effectiveness.&lt;ref name="Lehman:372"&gt;[[#Lehman|Lehman]]: p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Clinton administration]] in April 1993, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Les Aspin]] announced a new policy, which in effect made it possible to have female fighter pilots serving on aircraft carriers at sea and in other new positions (but still prohibited from serving in [[infantry]], etc.)
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | date = 1993-04-28 | title = Women in Combat (Department of Defense briefing) | url = http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/WomeninComb | accessdate = 2013-09-19 | format = Television production | publisher = [[C-SPAN]] | ref = WIC | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130920193631/http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/WomeninComb | archivedate = September 20, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, the stage was set for the reality-based fictional drama, when Bellisario read in a newspaper about the forthcoming introduction of female fighter pilots on aircraft carriers.&lt;ref name="Erickson:127"/&gt;

While doing research on which organizational entities would partake in investigative efforts of crimes committed aboard Naval vessels, Bellisario found  the special agents of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] filled the police role, and the uniformed lawyers, in the Navy's Judge Advocate General's Corps, could alternate between the role of defense attorney, prosecutor, and field investigator. Bellisario chose to go ahead with the lawyers and remarked season six about the unique advantages it brought from a story-telling point of view: "Unlike most [[legal drama|law shows]], I've got a detective, a prosecutor, and a defender."&lt;ref name="Erickson:127"/&gt;

===Collaboration with the military===
[[File:RADM Donald Guter, JAGC, USN visited the JAG television series set, 2001-02-20.jpg|thumb|The then-[[Judge Advocate General of the Navy]], Rear Admiral Donald J. Guter, visiting the set, meeting with the cast during the shooting of "[[JAG (season 6)#ep128|Liberty]]" in 2001]]

Initially, the producers of ''JAG'' did not receive any co-operation from the Department of the Navy, due to sensitivity in light of all the accumulative negative publicity that had been generated from the [[Tailhook scandal]] and its aftermath.&lt;ref name="Erickson:129"&gt;[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the lack of co-operation from the military was not a show-stopper, as the ''JAG'' production team, by virtue of being a [[Paramount Pictures]] production, had access to the [[stock footage]] of the motion pictures owned by the studio, which included many films with military content, such as ''[[Top Gun (film)|Top Gun]]'', ''[[The Final Countdown (film)|The Final Countdown]]'', and ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]].&lt;ref name="Erickson:128"&gt;[[#Erickson|Erickson]]: p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, though, the naval services had begun to change their minds, and began to render support to the production team on a script-by-script basis. A primetime network series about Navy lawyers bringing out controversial subjects in a very public arena was apparently no longer an issue in itself, but as noted by Commander Bob Anderson of the Navy's [[Public affairs (military)|entertainment media liaison office]] in Los Angeles in a ''[[TV Guide]]'' interview: "We're fine with that as long as the bad guys are caught and punished, and the institution of the Navy is not the bad guy".&lt;ref name="Erickson:129"/&gt;

===Ships===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Almost all episodes of the series feature scenes filmed aboard real United States Navy ships. The ship most widely used was the {{USS|Forrestal|CV-59}}, in commission as a training carrier at the time. Most of the ''Nimitz''-class carriers also appear in one or several episodes. {{USS|Saratoga|CV-60}}, {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65}}, and {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67}} were also used in the series.

USS ''Enterprise'' was used as the fictional USS ''Seahawk'' in many episodes. USS ''Forrestal'' and {{USS|Dwight D. Eisenhower|CVN-69}} were also used as the fictional ''Seahawk'', both in season four and for one episode each. For scenes filmed aboard ''Enterprise'', the whole crew wore caps reading ''USS Seahawk – CVN 65'' so they matched the ship's real hull number.

USS ''Forrestal'' was featured in many episodes, most prominently two in which she portrayed the fictional USS ''Reprisal''.  In these episodes, all crew members wore caps with the ''CV-35'' pennant number.  This number was intentionally out of sequence with the pennant numbers of active USN carriers at the time the series was filmed. CV-35 would have been the real pennant number of an ''Essex''-class carrier actually called ''Reprisal'', which was canceled during construction in 1945 when WWII ended, and broken up in 1949 after consideration had been given to completing her to a revised design roughly similar to that of {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34}}.

Only six USN ships featured in the series were called by their real names: {{USS|Hornet|CV-12}}, {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43}}, {{USS |Kitty Hawk|CV-63}}, {{USS|America|CV-66}}, {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}}, and {{USS|Belknap|CG-26}}. The ''Kitty Hawk'' is mentioned in one of the season-three episodes, but never seen on screen. The ''America'' is the murder scene in a season-three episode, but shots supposedly depicting her are in fact shots of the ''Forrestal''. Real shots of the ''Roosevelt'' in harbor are used in one episode of season one.

[[File:US Navy 050125-N-0685S-001 Crewmembers for the hit television show JAG set up for the next shot outside the Transient Aircraft Line on board Naval Air Station North Island, Calif.jpg|thumb|upright|Crewmembers set up for a shot at [[Naval Air Station North Island|NAS North Island]] (2005)]]

Season-three opener "Ghost Ship" was filmed entirely aboard the ''Hornet'' while she was laid up at Alameda Naval Air Station before being preserved as a museum ship. Part of the storyline in "Ghost Ship" deals with the final fate of ''Hornet''. It implies (though not explicitly stating it) she was eventually scrapped due to severe fire damage sustained during the course of the episode, contrary to her real-life fate as a national landmark. The subplot in "Ghost Ship" indicating that the ship's double hull had to be cut open from the inside to repair supposed damage to her bow during Vietnam was not at all correct with her service record.

''Coral Sea'' is also featured in the season-three episode "Vanished" and season-four episodes "Angels 30" and "Shakedown". As she had already been scrapped at the time the episodes supposedly took place, archival footage of ''Coral Sea'' was used, with other footage shot aboard ''Forrestal''. The majority of the exterior scenes from "Angels 30" were filmed aboard ''Forrestal'' and a few aboard ''Enterprise''.

''Belknap'' is mentioned in the season-four episode "Going after Francesca" as the [[United States Sixth Fleet|Sixth Fleet]] flagship, a role she actually fulfilled in real life from 1986 until her decommissioning in 1994. ''Belknap'' had already been decommissioned and was laid up awaiting scrapping when the episode was filmed, allowing for actual exterior shots of the ship to be featured in the episode.

The series also includes appearances by [[Tarawa class amphibious assault ship|''Tarawa''-class amphibious assault ships]], [[Ticonderoga class cruiser|''Ticonderoga''-class cruisers]], [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke''-class destroyers]] (in particular the {{USS|Arleigh Burke|DDG-51}} itself during the opening credit montage), and [[Oliver Hazard Perry class frigate|''Oliver Hazard Perry''-class frigates]]. In one of the episodes, the [[Spanish Navy|Spanish]] frigate {{ship|SPS|Santa María|F81}} is used to depict a fictional USN ''Perry''-class ship (denoted by her NATO pennant number "F 81" painted under the bridge, instead of the U.S. practice of having a "number only" ID painted on the bow).

While most sea episodes are focused on aviation missions, several are based around submarine warfare: namely episodes 1:3, 2:6, 4:16, 5:22, 6:15, 7:14, 7:24, 8:7, 8:17, and 9:7.

===Series end===
[[File:JAGcoin.png|thumb|right|Harm (David James Elliott) and Mac (Catherine Bell) use a challenge coin to determine who will resign his or her commission.]]
In February 2005, David James Elliott announced he would leave the show at the end of the 10th season; the show was subsequently not renewed for an 11th season by the network.&lt;ref name="Why JAG"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Maureen|title=Why 'JAG' came to an abrupt end|url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/04/why_jag_came_to.html|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=April 29, 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012052549/http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2005/04/why_jag_came_to.html|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show also introduced new younger characters, including former ''[[As the World Turns]]'' star [[Chris Beetem]], and [[Jordana Spiro]] from ''[[The Huntress (TV series)|The Huntress]]''.

The producers also considered relocating the fictional setting of the show, from Falls Church to [[Naval Base San Diego]]. An episode of the final season, "[[List of JAG episodes#ep222|JAG: San Diego]]" had the main cast, excluding Harm, going to the San Diego naval base and working with the local JAG office there. Though it was reportedly considered as a pilot episode, as a reformat of the show aiming for a younger audience, CBS ultimately decided not to pursue a new series.

Nevertheless, CBS announced the cancellation of the show on April 4, 2005, after 10 seasons. The final episode, "[[List of JAG episodes#ep227|Fair Winds and Following Seas]]", aired on April 29, 2005, and in which Harm and Mac are assigned different [[Military base|stations]]: Harm in [[London]], Mac in [[San Diego]]. They finally confront their feelings and decide to get married. The episode ends with Bud tossing a [[challenge coin]] to decide which one would give up his or her military career to be with the other. However, in keeping with ''JAG'' tradition, the outcome of the toss is never seen, as the screen fades to black, showing only the coin, which bears the inscription "1995 – 2005", the years the series spanned.

===''NCIS'' spin-off===
{{Main|NCIS (TV series)}}
In January 2003, CBS announced that Donald P. Bellisario was developing a ''JAG'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]],  around the work of the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]].&lt;ref name="Variety20030113"&gt;{{cite web|title=CBS ‘Angel’ to fly home - Net also eyes 'JAG' spinoff|url=https://variety.com/2003/scene/news/cbs-angel-to-fly-home-1117878658/|work=TV Line|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=January 13, 2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012033839/http://variety.com/2003/scene/news/cbs-angel-to-fly-home-1117878658/|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was aired in April 2003 in a two-part [[backdoor pilot]] in which Commander Rabb is arrested, but later vindicated as innocent, for the murder of Lieutenant Singer. The two episodes, titled "[[Ice Queen (JAG)|Ice Queen]]" and "[[Meltdown (JAG)|Meltdown]]", focused on the NCIS team, with most of the JAG regulars as supporting characters. Whereas the episodes of ''JAG'' are primarily oriented on a mixture of courtroom drama and military activities in the field, ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]'' episodes are more focused, as the meaning of  the acronym suggests, on criminal investigations. ''NCIS'' also follows a different storytelling format from ''JAG'', emphasizing character humor to a larger extent than its parent program. ''NCIS'' later produced its own spin-offs, ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]'' and ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'', which shows a further departure from the styles and themes of ''JAG''.

The two episodes "Ice Queen" and "Meltdown" were edited down to a one-hour pilot film, which was then used to sell the idea of ''NCIS'' as a new series to CBS; the pilot used the title, "NCIS – The Beginning". It was later also used to introduce the show to CBS affiliates and advertisers.  It was only broadcast once and is not available on home video.

Excluding the backdoor pilot, only two major characters from ''JAG'' have appeared in the ''NCIS'' series. Patrick Labyorteaux appeared briefly as Lieutenant Bud Roberts in the ''NCIS'' first-season episode "[[NCIS (season 1)#ep2|Hung Out to Dry]]", and again - now with the rank of captain - in the season fourteen episode "Rogue," advising the NCIS team on a legal issue. [[John M. Jackson]] returned in May 2013 as retired Rear Admiral A.J. Chegwidden, now a civilian attorney in the private sector hired by [[List of NCIS characters#Leon Vance|Director Vance]] to provide legal representation for [[Leroy Jethro Gibbs|Special Agent Gibbs]], in the season ten ''NCIS'' finale, "[[Damned If You Do (NCIS)|Damned If You Do]]".&lt;ref name=tl&gt;{{cite web|last=Roots|first=Kimberly|title=NCIS Exclusive: A JAG Favorite to Return in This Season's 'Nail-Biter' of a Finale|url=http://tvline.com/2013/04/12/ncis-season-10-cast-john-m-jackson-jag-chegwidden/|work=TV Line|accessdate=October 11, 2013|date=April 12, 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012043344/http://tvline.com/2013/04/12/ncis-season-10-cast-john-m-jackson-jag-chegwidden/|archivedate=October 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson has recurred as A.J. Chegwidden since the eighth season of ''[[NCIS: Los Angeles]]''. Chegwidden is a Vietnam-era compatriot of series regulars Hetty Lange ([[Linda Hunt]]) and Owen Granger ([[Miguel Ferrer]]).

Lt. Cmdr. Faith Coleman (played by [[Alicia Coppola]]) appeared in two episodes of JAG (in 2003) and three episodes of NCIS (2004-2005).

While several other actors who played major roles on ''JAG'' have also appeared on ''NCIS'', such as Scott Lawrence (Sturgis Turner on ''JAG''),&lt;ref&gt;Scott Lawrence played Captain Thomas Lind in the ''NCIS'' episode "[[A Man Walks Into a Bar...]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Culp (Clayton Webb on ''JAG''),&lt;ref&gt;Steven Culp played Commander William Skinner in the ''NCIS'' fifth-season episode "[[NCIS (season 5)#ep100|Chimera]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Randy Vazquez (Victor Galindez on ''JAG''),&lt;ref&gt;Randy Vazquez played ATF Special Agent Phillip Caffey in the ''NCIS'' twelfth-season episode "[[NCIS (season 12)#ep278|No Good Deed]]".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Bellisario]] ([[Mikey Roberts]] on ''JAG'');&lt;ref&gt;Recurring part as [[List of NCIS characters#Charles .22Chip.22 Sterling|Chip Sterling]] in four episodes ("[[NCIS (season 3)#ep52|The Voyeur's Web]]", "[[NCIS (season 3)#ep53|Honor Code]]", "[[NCIS (season 3)#ep54|Under Covers]]", and "[[NCIS (season 3)#ep55|Frame Up]]") of the third season of ''NCIS''.&lt;/ref&gt; they played completely different characters when appearing on ''NCIS''.

First introduced in the NCIS back-door pilot, [[Alicia Coppola]] appeared as Navy judge advocate Lieutenant Commander Faith Coleman in several episodes of ''NCIS''.&lt;ref&gt;''NCIS'' episodes: "[[NCIS (season 1)#ep18|UnSEALeD]]", "[[NCIS (season 2)#7|Call of Silence]]" and "[[NCIS (season 2)#ep44|Hometown Hero]]".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Baldwin]] played the same guest role, Navy SEAL Commander Michael Rainer, in one episode of each show.&lt;ref&gt;''JAG'': "[[List of JAG episodes#ep195|Good Intentions]]"'' NCIS'': "[[NCIS (season 1)#ep22|A Weak Link]]" (first season).&lt;/ref&gt;

===''First Monday'' cross-over===
''[[First Monday]]'' was a short-lived series co-created by Bellisario and [[Paul Levine]] about fictional [[U.S. Supreme Court]] justices and their clerks, which aired in 2002 and starred [[James Garner]] and [[Joe Mantegna]]. The character of [[U.S. Senator]] Edward Sheffield ([[Dean Stockwell]]), who appeared in three episodes of that show, later became a recurring character on ''JAG'' as the new [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], starting in season eight.

===''Yes, Dear'' tribute===
The sitcom ''[[Yes, Dear]]'' did an episode called "Let's Get Jaggy With It" where Greg's father Tom ([[Tim Conway]]) wins a walk-on role on ''JAG''. Catherine Bell guest-starred as herself while David James Elliott, Patrick Labyorteaux, and Scott Lawrence guest-starred as their respective ''JAG'' characters.

==Home media==
On September 1, 1998, the pilot episode of ''JAG'' was released on [[VHS]] cassette in the U.S. by [[Paramount Home Entertainment]]. However, no further episodes of the series proper were released on any home entertainment media while the show was still in production, allegedly due to syndication deals made with several broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/pulpfiction/99/jag.faq.txt |title=JAG faq |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305193454/http://www.fortunecity.com/lavendar/pulpfiction/99/jag.faq.txt |archivedate=March 5, 2012 |df= }}, Retrieved on 2013-09-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2006, [[CBS Home Entertainment]] (distributed by [[Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount]]) has released all 10 seasons on DVD in regions 1, 2 and 4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/shows/JAG/2445#News JAG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217115007/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/shows/JAG/2445 |date=February 17, 2013 }}, [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]]. retrieved on 2013-09-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Seasons 1 to 4 are released with a 4:3 [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], while seasons 5 to 10 have a 16:9 aspect ratio.

On December 11, 2012, CBS released ''JAG: The Complete Series – Collector's Edition'' on DVD in region 1.

The James Bond [[film series]] is a British series of [[spy film]]s based on the fictional character of [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]], "007", who originally appeared in a [[List of James Bond novels and short stories|series of books]] by [[Ian Fleming]]. It is one of the longest continually-running film series in history, having been in on-going production from 1962 to the present (with a six-year hiatus between 1989 and 1995). In that time [[Eon Productions]] has produced 24 films, most of them at [[Pinewood Studios]]. With a combined gross of over $7 billion to date, the films produced by Eon constitute the [[List of highest-grossing film series|fourth-highest-grossing film series]].{{efn|Adjusted for inflation, the Eon ''James Bond'' series up to and including ''Quantum of Solace'' had amassed over $12 billion at 2011 prices. ''Skyfall'' subsequently added a further $1.100 billion in 2012 to take the adjusted total to over $13 billion. }}&lt;ref name="Numbers: Franchises" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Economist: Potter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bom-skyfall" /&gt; Six actors have portrayed 007 in the Eon series, the latest being [[Daniel Craig]].

[[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]] co-produced most of the Eon films until 1975, when Broccoli became the sole producer. The single exception during this period was ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'', on which Broccoli and Saltzman became executive producers while [[Kevin McClory]] produced. From 1984 Broccoli was joined by his stepson [[Michael G. Wilson]] as producer and in 1995 Broccoli stepped aside from Eon and was replaced by his daughter [[Barbara Broccoli|Barbara]], who has co-produced with Wilson since. Broccoli's (and until 1975, Saltzman's) family company, [[Danjaq]], has held ownership of the series through Eon, and maintained co-ownership with [[United Artists]] since the mid-1970s. The Eon series has seen continuity both in the main actors and in the production crews, with directors, writers, composers, production designers, and others employed through a number of films.

From the release of ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' (1962) to ''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' (1981), the films were distributed solely by United Artists. When [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] absorbed United Artists in 1981, MGM/UA Entertainment Co. was formed and distributed the films until 1995. MGM solely distributed three films from 1997 to 2002 after United Artists was retired as a mainstream studio. From 2006 to 2015, MGM and [[Columbia Pictures]] co-distributed the film series, following the 2004 acquisition of MGM by a consortium led by Columbia's parent company, [[Sony Pictures]]. In November 2010, MGM filed for bankruptcy. Following its emergence from insolvency, Columbia became co-production partner of the series with Eon. Sony's distribution rights to the franchise expired in late 2015 with the release of ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]''.&lt;ref name="deadline.com"&gt;{{cite news|URL=http://deadline.com/2015/10/daniel-craig-james-bond-sony-warner-bros-mgm-daniel-craig-1201528241/|title=The Stakes Behind The James Bond Rights Auction As Warner Bros And Others Try To Win 007’s Loyalties From Sony|publisher=Deadline|date=7 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, MGM and Eon offered a one-film contract to co-finance and distribute the upcoming 25th film worldwide,&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; which was reported on 25 May 2018 to have been won by [[Universal Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/bond-25-universal-will-distribute-daniel-craig-film-internationally-1114810|title=Universal Wins James Bond International Distribution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independently of the Eon series, there have been three additional productions with the character of James Bond: an American television adaptation, ''[[Casino Royale (Climax!)|Casino Royale]]'' (1954), produced by [[CBS]]; a spoof, ''[[Casino Royale (1967 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (1967), produced by [[Charles K. Feldman]]; and a remake of ''Thunderball'' entitled ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'' (1983), produced by [[Jack Schwartzman]], who had obtained the rights to the film from McClory.

==First screen adaptation==
In 1954 the American [[CBS]] television network paid [[Ian Fleming]] $1,000{{sfn|Black|2005|p=14}} (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1954}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US|df=yes}}) for the rights to turn his first novel, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'', into a one-hour television adventure{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=14}} as part of the dramatic anthology series [[Climax!|''Climax Mystery Theater'']], which ran between October 1954 and June 1958.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=264}} It was adapted for the screen by Anthony Ellis and [[Charles Bennett (screenwriter)|Charles Bennett]]; Bennett was well known for his collaborations with [[Alfred Hitchcock]], including ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'' and ''[[Sabotage (1936 film)|Sabotage]]''.&lt;ref name="EFC" /&gt; Due to the restriction of a one-hour play, the adapted version lost many of the details found in the book, although it retained its violence, particularly in Act III.&lt;ref name="EFC" /&gt; The hour-long "[[Casino Royale (Climax!)|Casino Royale]]" episode, which starred American actor [[Barry Nelson]] as Bond and [[Peter Lorre]] as the villain [[Le Chiffre]], aired on 21 October 1954 as a live production.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=11}}

===Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman (1962–1964)===

In 1959 producer [[Albert R. Broccoli|Albert R. "Cubby" Broccoli]] at [[Warwick Films]] expressed interest in adapting the Bond novels, but his colleague [[Irving Allen]] was unenthusiastic.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=40}} In June 1961 Fleming sold a six-month option on the film rights to his published and future James Bond novels and short stories to [[Harry Saltzman]], with the exception of ''Casino Royale'', which he had previously sold.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=21}}{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=5}} Towards the end of Saltzman's option period, screenwriter [[Wolf Mankowitz]] introduced him to Broccoli,{{sfn|Sellers|2008|p=99}} and Saltzman and Broccoli formed [[Eon Productions]] with the intention of making the first Bond film.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=22}} A number of Hollywood studios did not want to fund the films, finding them "too British" or "too blatantly sexual".{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=13}} Eventually the two signed a deal with [[United Artists]] for 100% financial backing and distribution of seven films,{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=8}} with financing of $1&amp;nbsp;million for the first feature.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=270}} Saltzman and Broccoli also created the company [[Danjaq]], which was to hold the rights to the films which Eon Productions was to produce.&lt;ref name="dr no documentary" /&gt;

Eon had originally intended to film Fleming's novel [[Thunderball (novel)|''Thunderball'']] first, but [[Kevin McClory]] took Fleming to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in London for [[Thunderball (novel)#Writing and copyright|breach of copyright over the book]],{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=199}} and so Eon decided to film [[Dr. No (film)|''Dr. No'']] first.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=270}}

====''Dr. No'' (1962)====
Eon asked several directors—[[Bryan Forbes]], [[Guy Green (filmmaker)|Guy Green]], [[Val Guest]] and [[Guy Hamilton]]—to helm the film, but all declined, before [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]] agreed.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=10}} &lt;!--- actually Guy Hamilton agreed, but had to drop out for personal reasons. Will find the cite. ---&gt; Eon had originally hired Wolf Mankowitz and [[Richard Maibaum]] to write [[Dr. No (film)|''Dr. No'']]{{'}}s screenplay, partly because of Mankowitz's help in brokering the deal between Broccoli and Saltzman.{{sfn|Broccoli|1998|p=158}} An initial draft of the screenplay was rejected because the scriptwriters had made the villain, Dr. No, a monkey, and Mankowitz left the film.{{Sfn|Broccoli|1998|p=159}}{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=19}} Maibaum then undertook a second version, more closely in line with the novel; Johanna Harwood and [[Berkely Mather]] then worked on Maibaum's script,{{sfn| McGilligan |1986|p=286}} with Harwood in particular being described as a [[script doctor]] credited with improving the British characterisations.&lt;ref name="Dr. No: John Cork" /&gt; &lt;!--- Johanna Harwood was actually Saltzman's secretary. Will find the cite. ---&gt;

To play the lead role of Bond, [[Sean Connery]] was not Broccoli or Fleming's first choice, but he was selected after [[Patrick McGoohan]] had turned down the role,&lt;ref name="McGoohan Obit" /&gt; and Eon had rejected [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]].&lt;ref name="Johnson decline" /&gt;{{sfn|Mayer|2003|p=92}} After Connery was chosen, Terence Young took the actor to his tailor and hairdresser&lt;ref name="gayson" /&gt; and introduced him to the high life, restaurants, casinos and women of London. In the words of Bond writer [[Raymond Benson]], Young educated the actor "in the ways of being dapper, witty, and above all, cool".{{sfn|Yeffeth|2006|p=7}}

Filming took place on location in Jamaica between 16 January{{sfn|Cockburn|1988|p=49}} and 21 February 1962; five days later filming began at [[Pinewood Studios]] in England with sets [[production designer|designed]] by [[Ken Adam]],&lt;ref name="dr no documentary" /&gt; who had previously worked with Broccoli on the 1960 film ''[[The Trials of Oscar Wilde]]''.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=16}} [[Maurice Binder]] created the title sequence and introduced the [[gun barrel sequence|gun barrel motif]] that appears in all the Eon Bond films.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=63}} [[Monty Norman]] wrote the accompanying soundtrack, which included the "[[James Bond Theme]]", heard in the gun barrel sequence and in a calypso medley over the title credits; the theme was described by another Bond film composer, [[David Arnold]], as "bebop-swing vibe coupled with that vicious, dark, distorted electric guitar, definitely an instrument of rock 'n' roll&amp;nbsp;... it represented everything about the character you would want: It was cocky, swaggering, confident, dark, dangerous, suggestive, sexy, unstoppable.

After the financial success of ''Dr. No'', United Artists doubled the budget offered to Eon Productions to $2 million for the company's next film, ''[[From Russia with Love (film)|From Russia with Love]]''.{{sfn|Balio|1987|p=22}} The film was shot in Europe, which had turned out to be the more profitable market for ''Dr. No''.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=22}} Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam—who went to work on ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' and was replaced by ''Dr. No''{{'}}s art director [[Syd Cain]]—and title designer Maurice Binder, who was replaced by [[Robert Brownjohn]].&lt;ref name="inside FRWL" /&gt;{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|pp=33-35}}

[[File:John-barry-2006.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]] composed the scores of 11 Bond films between 1963 and 1987.]]
The original screenwriter for the film was [[Len Deighton]], but he was replaced because of his slow progress. Two of the writers from ''Dr. No'', Richard Maibaum and Johanna Harwood, were brought in, with Maibaum being given the sole writing credit and Harwood being credited for "adaptation".{{sfn|McGilligan|1986|p=284}} ''From Russia with Love'' is the first Bond film in the series with John Barry as the primary [[From Russia with Love (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] composer,{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=297}} although [[Lionel Bart]] wrote the title song "From Russia with Love", sung by [[Matt Monro]].{{sfn|Rubin|2003|p=150}} [[Principal photography]] began on 1 April 1963{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=23}} and concluded on 23 August.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=25}} Filming took place in Turkey, Pinewood Studios and Venice, with Scotland and Switzerland doubling for the [[Orient Express]] journey through Eastern Europe.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|pp=23–25}}

====''Goldfinger'' (1964)====
While the previous two films had concentrated on the Caribbean and Europe, ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' was chosen by Eon for the third film, with the American cinema market in mind.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=48}} Because Terence Young was refused a share of the profits, he declined to direct ''Goldfinger'' and worked on ''[[The Amorous Adventures of Moll Flanders]]'' instead,{{sfn|Black|2005|p=117}} although he had done some pre-production work before he left.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=179}} In his place, Eon turned to Guy Hamilton to direct;{{sfn|Rubin|2003|p=166}} he was keen to inject elements of humour into the series,{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=45}} have more gadgets and build bigger and more elegant sets.{{sfn|Cork|Scivally|2002|p=63}}

Eon again turned to Richard Maibaum for the script, although [[Paul Dehn]] was later introduced for rewrites.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=48}} After missing ''From Russia with Love'', Ken Adam returned as production designer.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=279}} Adam's imagination provided the idea of gold stacked upon gold behind iron bars for the scenes in the [[United States Bullion Depository]]. Saltzman disliked the design's resemblance to a prison, but Hamilton liked it enough that it was built.{{sfn|Bouzerau|2006|pp=62–65}}

Robert Brownjohn returned to develop the opening credit sequence, which featured clips of all three Bond films projected on actress [[Margaret Nolan]]'s body. Its design was inspired by seeing light projecting on people's bodies as they got up and left a cinema.&lt;ref name="Osmond: Goldfinger" /&gt;
Principal photography on ''Goldfinger'' started on {{nowrap|20 January 1964}} in Miami, at the [[Fontainebleau Miami Beach|Fontainebleau Hotel]]; the crew was small, consisting only of Hamilton, Broccoli, Adam and cinematographer [[Ted Moore]].&lt;ref name="Goldfinger commentary" /&gt; After five days in Florida, production moved to England.{{sfn|Rubin|2003|p=44}} The primary location was Pinewood Studios, home to sets including a recreation of the Fontainebleau, the South American city of the pre-title sequence, and both Goldfinger's estate and factory.&lt;ref name="Goldfinger commentary" /&gt;{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=39}} Ian Fleming visited the set of ''Goldfinger'' in {{nowrap|April 1964;}} he died in August, shortly before the film's release.&lt;ref name="Making Goldfinger" /&gt; The [[second unit]] filmed in Kentucky, and these shots were edited into scenes filmed at Pinewood.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=39}} Principal photography then moved to [[Switzerland]] for the car chase and additional footage for Goldfinger's factory sequence.&lt;ref name="Making Goldfinger" /&gt; Filming wrapped on {{nowrap|11 July}} at [[Andermatt]], after nineteen weeks of shooting.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=39}}

===Kevin McClory (1965)===

When writing his novels, Ian Fleming had always considered that they could be adapted for the cinema,{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=31}} and he approached producer Sir [[Alexander Korda]] to make a [[film adaptation]] of either ''[[Live and Let Die (novel)|Live and Let Die]]'' or ''[[Moonraker (novel)|Moonraker]]''. Although Korda was initially interested, he later withdrew.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=255}} On 1 October 1959, it was announced that Fleming would write an original film script featuring Bond for producer Kevin McClory. [[Jack Whittingham]] also worked on the script, culminating in a screenplay entitled ''James Bond, Secret Agent''.{{sfn|Caplen|2010|p=73}} However, Alfred Hitchcock and [[Richard Burton]] turned down roles as director and star, respectively.&lt;ref name="TF: Lost Bond" /&gt;{{sfn|Sellers|2008|p=117}} McClory was unable to secure the financing for the film, and the deal fell through. Fleming subsequently used the story for his novel ''Thunderball'' (1961),{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=42}} and McClory failed to have its publication stopped.&lt;ref name="Times Law (1961)" /&gt; On 19 November 1963 he took the matter to the [[Chancery Division]] of the High Court in the case of McClory v Fleming, but settled on 9 December 1963,&lt;ref name="Sellers (2007)" /&gt; after nine days in court.{{sfn|Sellers|2008|p=113}} McClory gained the literary and film rights for the screenplay, while Fleming was given the rights to the novel, although it had to be recognised as being "based on a screen treatment by Kevin McClory, Jack Whittingham and the Author".{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=432}}

====''Thunderball'' (1965)====
After ''From Russia with Love'', Eon had considered undertaking an adaptation of either [[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (novel)|''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'']] or ''Casino Royale''.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=182}}{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=96}} They entered into negotiations with Charles K. Feldman, who held the rights to the latter, but a deal proved too difficult to achieve.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=276}} Instead, Eon turned to the ''Thunderball'' novel. Although Eon had wanted to adapt the book in 1962, it had not been possible until the legal obstacles had been cleared.&lt;ref name="Poliakoff (2000)" /&gt; As a result of the settlement of the copyright infringement lawsuit brought by Kevin McClory, Eon negotiated with McClory to make ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''. McClory received the sole producer credit on the film, while Broccoli and Saltzman took the title Executive Producer, although "in reality all three men would essentially act as producers".{{sfn|Sellers|2008|p=124}} Broccoli later said of the three-way partnership that "We didn't want anyone else to make ''Thunderball''&amp;nbsp;... We had the feeling that if anyone else came in and made their own Bond film, it would have been bad for our series".{{sfn|Sellers|2008|p=124}}

Guy Hamilton was asked to direct again, but declined feeling that he was "drained of ideas&amp;nbsp;... I had nothing to contribute until I'd recharged batteries";{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=43}} Terence Young returned to direct after the hiatus of ''Goldfinger''.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=39}} Richard Maibaum's original script from 1961 was used as the basis of the script, which he then re-drafted, with further revisions by [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]].{{sfn|Sellers|2008|p=124}} Principal filming began in Paris on 16 February 1965,{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=138}} and moved to [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] on 22 March,{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=47}} before concluding at Pinewood Studios in May.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=49}}

With worldwide box office earnings of $141.2 million ''Thunderball'' became the highest-grossing instalment and retained the record until it was surpassed by ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' twelve years later;{{sfn|Block|Autrey Wilson|2010|pp=428-429}} adjusted for inflation it remained the most successful entry until ''Skyfall'' was released in 2012.{{sfn|Guinness World Records|2014|p=203}} As part of the contract with Eon, McClory received 20% of the film's profits and undertook not to produce any other films based on the ''Thunderball'' story for a period of ten years following the release of the Eon-produced version in 1965.{{sfn|Rubin|2003|p=258}}{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=184}}

===Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman (1967–1975)===
[[File:Roald Dahl.jpg|thumb|[[Roald Dahl]], who wrote the script for [[You Only Live Twice (film)|''You Only Live Twice'']]]]

====''You Only Live Twice'' (1967)====
After the interruption of McClory as producer, Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman returned to produce once again.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=278}} The first four Bond films had been popular in Japan,{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=74}} and Eon decided to take advantage of the market by producing [[You Only Live Twice (film)|''You Only Live Twice'']].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=187}} The film included progressive elements of Japanese culture as part of the background.{{sfn|Lipp|2006|p=140}}

[[Lewis Gilbert]] was appointed director and Ken Adam returned as production designer; Adam built a volcano hideaway set for the main antagonist, [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]], at Pinewood for $1&amp;nbsp;millon{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=279}} (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000000|1967}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars);{{inflation-fn|US|df=yes}} at the time it was the biggest film set in Europe. Gilbert, Broccoli, Saltzman, Ken Adam and director of photography [[Freddie Young]] then went to Japan, spending three weeks searching for locations. While in Tokyo, the crew crossed paths with [[Peter R. Hunt]], who was on holiday. Hunt had edited the first four Bond films, and he was invited to direct the second unit.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=278}} The total budget for the film was $10.3&amp;nbsp;million ($59.9&amp;nbsp;million in 2005 dollars).{{sfn|Block|Autrey Wilson|2010|pp=428-429}}

Initially the screenwriter was to be [[Harold Jack Bloom]],{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=71}} although he was later replaced by [[Roald Dahl]], who had little previous screenwriting experience.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=72}} ''You Only Live Twice'' was the first Bond film to jettison the plot premise of the Fleming source material, although the film retains the title, the Japanese setting, the use of Blofeld as the main villain and a Bond girl named Kissy Suzuki from the novel.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=278}}

Filming commenced at Pinewood on 4 July 1966{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=74}} before moving out to Japan on 27 July for six weeks' filming.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=75}} Local Japanese interest in the filming was high, and the crew had to contend with large crowds throughout the process.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=191}} Connery, however, was somewhat resigned to the project, lacking the enthusiasm he sported for ''Thunderball''.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=82}} A press conference on his arrival had been tense, "soured by aggressive questioning of Connery's crumpled, jet-lagged appearance".{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=75}} Primary and secondary photography finished in December; the special effects filming for the space scenes were undertaken between January and March 1967, prior to the film's release on 12 June.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=76}}

The cinema posters for the film stated "Sean Connery IS James Bond", to distance the Eon-produced picture from the independent ''Casino Royale'', which had been released two months earlier.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=108}} However, during the production, Connery announced that it would be his last film as Bond, leaving Broccoli to tell [[Alan Whicker]], "it won't be the last Bond under any circumstances—with all due respect to Sean, who I think has been certainly the best man to play this part. We will, in our own way, try to continue the Bond series for the audience because it's too important".{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=75}}

====''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' (1969) ====
[[George Lazenby]] was signed on to play Bond for OHMSS. Between Sean Connery giving his notice at the beginning of filming ''You Only Live Twice'' and its release, Saltzman had planned to adapt [[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|''The Man with the Golden Gun'']] in Cambodia and use [[Roger Moore]] as the next Bond, but political instability meant the location was ruled out and Moore signed up for another series of the television programme [[The Saint (TV series)|''The Saint'']].{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=82}} After ''You Only Live Twice'' was released in 1967, the producers once again picked the often-delayed ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]'', which had previously been considered to follow both ''Goldfinger'' and then ''Thunderball''.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=280}}{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=96}}

Peter Hunt, who had worked on the five preceding films, had impressed Broccoli and Saltzman enough to earn his directorial debut as they believed his quick cutting had set the style for the series;{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=41}} it was also the result of a long-standing promise from Broccoli and Saltzman for the opportunity to direct.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=83}} Hunt also asked for the position during the production of ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'', and he brought along with him many crew members, including cinematographer [[Michael Reed (cinematographer)|Michael Reed]].&lt;ref name="OHMSS documentary" /&gt; Hunt was focused on putting his mark, saying, "I wanted it to be different than any other Bond film would be. It was my film, not anyone else's".&lt;ref name="Andere Tijden"/&gt; ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' was the last film on which Hunt worked in the series.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=99}}

Screenwriter Richard Maibaum, who worked on the first four Bond films, returned as script writer.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=67}} Saltzman and Broccoli decided to drop the science fiction gadgets from the earlier films and focus more on plot as in ''From Russia With Love''.{{sfn|Dimare|2011|p=53}} Peter Hunt asked [[Simon Raven]] to write some of the dialogue between [[Tracy Bond|Contessa Teresa "Tracy" di Vicenzo]] and Blofeld in [[Piz Gloria]], which was to be "sharper, better and more intellectual";{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=84}} Raven's additions included rewriting the proposal scene and having Tracy quote [[James Elroy Flecker]].&lt;ref name="OHMSS documentary" /&gt; &lt;!--- Nine words only. The rest is Simon Raven's own work. http://www.converj.com/sites/converjed/2003/10/thy_dawn_oh_master_of_the_worl.html ---&gt; Syd Cain took over from Ken Adam as production designer as Eon decided not to have Adam's larger sets to reduce the film's budget to $7&amp;nbsp;million, from the $10.3&amp;nbsp;million it took to make ''You Only Live Twice''.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=85}}{{sfn|Block|Autrey Wilson|2010|p=429}}

Principal photography began in the [[Canton of Bern]], Switzerland, on 21 October 1968, with the first scene shot being an aerial view of Bond climbing the stairs of Blofeld's mountain retreat.&lt;ref name="OHMSS documentary"/&gt; The scenes were shot atop the now-famous [[revolving restaurant]] [[Piz Gloria]], located atop the [[Schilthorn]] near the village of [[Mürren]]. The location was found by production manager Hubert Fröhlich after three weeks of [[location scouting]] in France and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Andere Tijden"/&gt; The Swiss filming ended up running 56 days over schedule.&lt;ref name="Andere Tijden"/&gt; In March 1969 production moved to England, with London's Pinewood Studios being used for interior shooting, and M's house being shot in [[Marlow, Buckinghamshire]]. In April the filmmakers went to Portugal, where principal photography wrapped in May.&lt;ref name="OHMSS documentary"/&gt;{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=89}} Filming finished on 23 June, two months later than planned, which was largely due to the warm Swiss winter, which had hampered shooting.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=90}}

Midway through production, acting on advice from his agent [[Ronan O'Rahilly]], [[George Lazenby]] announced that he was not going to continue as Bond in future films, and he left the role before the December 1969 release of ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service''.&lt;ref name="OHMSS documentary" /&gt;

====''Diamonds Are Forever'' (1971)====
[[File:Sean Connery 1971.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|[[Sean Connery]] in [[Amsterdam]] in July 1971, filming for the seventh Bond film ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds are Forever]]''.]]
Although Eon secured the services of [[John Gavin]] to play the role of Bond, United Artists' chief David Picker was unhappy with this decision and instructed associate producer Stanley Sopel to broker a deal with Connery which saw the actor being paid $1.25 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.2|1962}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars){{inflation-fn|US|df=yes}} and 12.5% of the gross.{{sfn|Block|Autrey Wilson|2010|p=429}}{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=99}} Connery's salary took a significant part of the $7.2&amp;nbsp;million budget.{{sfn|Block|Autrey Wilson|2010|pp=428-429}}

The producers had originally intended to have [[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|''Diamonds Are Forever'']] re-create commercially successful aspects of ''Goldfinger'', so they hired director Guy Hamilton as a result.&lt;ref name="inside DAF" /&gt; Richard Maibaum also returned to write the script; the first draft envisaged the return of [[Auric Goldfinger]] portrayer [[Gert Fröbe]], this time in the role of Goldfinger's twin brother. &lt;!--- Maibaum's first tried sneaking this idea into OHMSS. Source: Helfenstein book. Maibaum's OHMSS script also featured a laser battle, chimpanzee sidekick, car that drives under water, etc. ---&gt; Maibaum also wrote a climax to the film that consisted of the new Goldfinger being chased across [[Lake Mead]] by the people of Las Vegas, all being co-ordinated by Bond.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=95}} In the autumn of 1970 [[Tom Mankiewicz]] was hired to undertake re-writes, which included removing Goldfinger's brother and the Lake Mead finale.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=96}}

Filming began on 5 April 1971 with the desert near Las Vegas doubling for the South African scenes,&lt;ref name="inside DAF" /&gt; followed by filming in the [[Great Basin Desert]], Nevada in May for scenes in which Bond drives a moon buggy.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=99}} On 7 June production moved to Pinewood Studios for filming at sets of the returning Ken Adams; his sets spread through four of Pinewood's stages.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=100}} Filming also took place in London, Dover, Southampton, Amsterdam and the south of France;{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=100}} principal photography finished 13 August 1971.&lt;ref name="inside DAF" /&gt;

====''Live and Let Die'' (1973) ====
While filming ''Diamonds Are Forever'', ''Live and Let Die'' was chosen as the next Ian Fleming novel to be adapted because screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz thought it would be daring to use black villains, as the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]] and other racial movements were active at that time.&lt;ref name="inside LALD" /&gt; The new Bond actor selected by Eon was [[Roger Moore]], and he tried not to imitate either his predecessor Sean Connery or his own performance as [[Simon Templar]] in ''The Saint''; Mankiewicz adapted the screenplay to emphasise Moore's persona by giving him more comedy scenes and creating a light-hearted feel to Bond.&lt;ref name="inside LALD" /&gt; Guy Hamilton was again chosen to direct, and Mankiewicz suggested they film in New Orleans, as he knew Hamilton was a jazz fan. Hamilton didn't want to use [[Mardi Gras]], as ''Thunderball'' featured [[Junkanoo]], a similar festival, so after more discussions with the writer and further scouting, he decided to use two well-known features of the city, the [[jazz funeral]]s and the canals.&lt;ref name="inside LALD" /&gt; While searching for locations in Jamaica, the crew discovered a crocodile farm owned by Ross Kananga, after passing a sign warning that "trespassers will be eaten". The farm was put into the script and also inspired Mankiewicz to name the film's villain after Kananga.&lt;ref name="inside LALD" /&gt; With the rise of the popularity of [[Blaxploitation]] films in the early 1970s, it was decided to borrow elements of the genre for [[Live and Let Die (film)|''Live and Let Die'']].&lt;ref name = "Cinema: Blaxploitation" /&gt;
[[File:George Martin - backstage at LOVE.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|alt=Martin smiling to the camera|thumb|[[George Martin]] scored the music for ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]''.]]
Syd Cain returned as art director and was involved searching for locations with Guy Hamilton in March 1972.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=107}} Principal photography began on 13 October 1972 in the [[Irish Bayou]] in Louisiana for a boat chase scene.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=284}} On 29 November production moved to [[Jamaica]], which doubled for the fictional island San Monique, the home of antagonist Kananga. In December, production was divided between interiors in Pinewood Studios, while a separate unit also shot in Harlem.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=108}}

John Barry, who had worked on the previous five films, was unavailable during production. Broccoli and Saltzman instead asked [[Paul McCartney]] to write the theme song. Since McCartney's salary of $15,000 (plus royalties) was high and another composer of Barry's stature could not be hired with the remainder of the music budget, [[George Martin]], who had little experience of film scoring, was hired.{{sfn|Lindner|2009|p=148}}

====''The Man with the Golden Gun'' (1974) ====
The film of ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]'' saw a change in location from the novel of the same name to put Bond in the Far East for the second time.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=136}} After considering [[Beirut]], where part of the film is set;{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=286}} Iran, where the location scouting was done but eventually discarded because of the [[Yom Kippur War]];&lt;ref name="Commentary TMWTGG" /&gt; and the [[Hạ Long Bay]] in Vietnam, the production team chose Thailand as a primary location, following a suggestion of production designer [[Peter Murton]] after he saw pictures of the [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] bay in a magazine.&lt;ref name="Inside TMWTGG" /&gt; Saltzman was happy with the choice of the Far East for the setting as he had always wanted to go on location in Thailand and Hong Kong.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=211}} During the reconnaissance of locations in Hong Kong, Broccoli saw the partially submerged wreckage of the former {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} and came up with the idea of using it as the base for MI6's Far East operations.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=286}}

Tom Mankiewicz wrote a first draft for the script in 1973, delivering a script that was a battle of wills between Bond and the primary villain [[Francisco Scaramanga]], whom he saw as Bond's alter ego, "a super-villain of the stature of Bond himself".{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=215}} Tensions between Mankiewicz and Guy Hamilton led to Richard Maibaum taking over scripting duties.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=137}} Maibaum, who had worked on six Bond films previously, delivered his own draft based on Mankiewicz's work.&lt;ref name="Inside TMWTGG"/&gt; Broccoli's stepson [[Michael G. Wilson]] researched solar power to create the [[MacGuffin]] of the "Solex Agitator".&lt;ref name="Inside TMWTGG"/&gt; While ''Live and Let Die'' had borrowed heavily from the blaxploitation genre,&lt;ref name = "Cinema: Blaxploitation" /&gt; ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' borrowed from the [[Martial arts film|martial arts genre]] that was popular in the 1970s.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=140}}

On 6 November 1973 filming commenced at the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth#Final years|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth'']], which acted as a top-secret MI6 base grounded in [[Victoria Harbour]] in Hong Kong.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=114}} The major part of principal photography started in April 1974 in Thailand.&lt;ref name="Inside TMWTGG" /&gt; Thai locations included [[Bangkok]], [[Thonburi]], Phuket and the nearby [[Phang Nga Province]], on the islands of [[Khao Phing Kan|Ko Khao Phing Kan]] ({{lang-th|เกาะเขาพิงกัน}}) and [[Ko Tapu]] ({{lang-th|เกาะตะปู}}).{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=286}}{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=102}} In late April production returned to Hong Kong and also shot in [[Macau]].&lt;ref name="Inside TMWTGG" /&gt; Production had to move to studio work in Pinewood Studios—which included sets such as Scaramanga's solar energy plant and island interior.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=135}}

John Barry returned to compose the score, but had only three weeks to complete the work,{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=287}} and the theme tune and score are generally considered by critics to be among the weakest of Barry's contributions to the series—an opinion shared by Barry himself: "It's the one I hate most&amp;nbsp;... it just never happened for me".&lt;ref name="UKC4TV" /&gt;

===Albert R. Broccoli (1975–1984)===
Following ''The Man with the Golden Gun'', producer Harry Saltzman sold his 50% stake in Eon Productions' parent company, Danjaq, to United Artists to alleviate his financial problems,{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=141-2}} brought about by financial constraints following a downturn in the fortunes of Technicolor, in which he had invested heavily.{{sfn|Rubin|2003|p=361}} The resulting legalities over the Bond property delayed production of the next Bond film, ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]''.&lt;ref name="Inside TSWLM" /&gt;

====''The Spy Who Loved Me'' (1977) ====
Guy Hamilton was initially scheduled to follow on from ''The Man with the Golden Gun'' with ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', but instead turned down Eon Productions during pre-production after being offered the opportunity to direct the 1978 film ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', although he was ultimately passed up for [[Richard Donner]].{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|pp=134–135}}{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=288}} &lt;!--- Actually Hamilton quit because the film would no longer be shot in Italy, but instead in England where he was now a tax exile.

Ken Adam returned as production designer. As no studio stages were big enough for the interior of the villain Karl Stromberg's supertanker, in March 1976 construction began of a new sound stage at Pinewood, the [[007 Stage]], which cost $1.8 million and became the largest stage in the world.{{sfn|Frayling|2005|p=179}} In contrast to the volcano crater set Adam had built for ''You Only Live Twice'' in 1966—which Adam had called "a workable but ultimately wasteful set"—the 007 Stage would be a permanent structure that could be rented out to other productions.{{sfn|Frayling|2005|p=179}} Secondary filming began in July 1976 at [[Baffin Island]], where the ski jump for the opening credits was filmed. Principal filming commenced in Sardinia in August 1976, moving on to Egypt shortly afterwards. Further filming took place in Sardinia, Malta, Japan, Switzerland and the [[HMNB Clyde|Faslane]] submarine base.&lt;ref name="Locations: TSWLM" /&gt; On 5 December 1976, with principal photography finished, the 007 Stage was formally opened by the former Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]].&lt;ref name="Locations: TSWLM" /&gt;

John Barry could not work in the United Kingdom due to tax problems{{sfn|Fiegel|1998|p=238}}{{efn|The [[Inland Revenue]] had frozen all Barry's royalties in 1977 in a dispute over unpaid tax, leading to him not being able to undertake work for the British-registered Eon Productions.{{sfn|Fiegel|1998|p=238}} }} and suggested [[Marvin Hamlisch]] to score the film.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=289}} Hamlisch composed "[[Nobody Does It Better]]" as the theme song; the score and the song were both nominated for [[Academy Award|Academy]]&lt;ref name="AA: SWLM" /&gt; and [[Golden Globe Award]]s.&lt;ref name="GG: SWLM" /&gt;

====''Moonraker'' (1979) ====
Eon Productions had originally planned to follow ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' with an adaptation of ''[[For Your Eyes Only (short story collection)|For Your Eyes Only]]'', &lt;!--- Broccoli announced in a 1976 Variety article that "Moonraker" will follow "The Spy Who Loved Me". Because of delays in the space shuttle, he changed his mind and picked "Eyes Only". Will find cite. Here is another cite that also verifies the 1976 "Moonraker" before "Eyes Only" intentions http://www.for-your-eyes-only.com/Site/Bond_fyeo18.html ---&gt; although this plan changed within weeks of the 1977 release, following the box office success of the 1977 space-themed film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=138}}{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=290}} With a budget of $34&amp;nbsp;million ''Moonraker'' cost more than double any of the previous Bond films, although both Broccoli and United Artists agreed to the costs because of the profits from ''The Spy Who Loved Me''.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=290}}{{sfn|Block|Autrey Wilson|2010|p=428}}

Lewis Gilbert was again appointed as director, and a number of the crew from ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' also joined the production.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=127}} Gilbert and Tom Mankiewicz wrote the initial story, &lt;!--- Mankiewicz's story has little in common with the finished film, source: HMSS.com interview ---&gt; but Christopher Wood turned this into the final screenplay.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=137}} Many of the script ideas came about as a result of location scouting, with [[Iguazu Falls]] being identified as a filming location while Broccoli was in Brazil for the release of ''The Spy Who Loved Me''.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=290}}

Unlike previous Bond films, the production of ''[[Moonraker (film)|Moonraker]]'' was not based at Pinewood, as Broccoli moved it to Paris for financial reasons,{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=290}} although the scenes for the cable car interiors and space battle exteriors were filmed at Pinewood,{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=291}} with the special effects team of [[Derek Meddings]] active in the UK throughout production.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=129}} Principal photography began on 11 August 1978 in Paris. The sets designed by returning production designer Ken Adam were the largest ever constructed in France and required more than 222,000 man-hours to construct (approximately 1,000 hours by each of the crew on average).&lt;ref name="Inside Moonraker" /&gt; Much of the film was shot in the cities of London, Paris, Venice, [[Palmdale, California]], [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name="Inside Moonraker"/&gt; Principal filming finished back in Paris on 27 February 1979, a 28-week schedule that had allowed Roger Moore only three days off.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=130}} John Barry was again asked to score an Eon film.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=290}}

====''For Your Eyes Only'' (1981) ====
''[[For Your Eyes Only (film)|For Your Eyes Only]]'' marked a change in the production crew: [[John Glen (director)|John Glen]] was promoted from his duties as a [[film editor]] to director, a position he would occupy for the next four films.&lt;ref name="inside FYEO"/&gt; Since Ken Adam was busy with the film ''[[Pennies from Heaven (1981 film)|Pennies from Heaven]]'', [[Peter Lamont]], who had worked in the art department since ''Goldfinger'', was promoted to production designer.{{sfn|Rubin|2003|p=218}} Following a suggestion from Glen, Lamont created realistic sets, instead of the elaborate scenery for which the series had been known.&lt;ref name="inside FYEO" /&gt;

Richard Maibaum was once again the scriptwriter for the story, assisted by Michael G. Wilson.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=227}} &lt;!--- Other sources claim Wilson wrote the first draft, and Maibaum was brought in to do re-writes ---&gt; According to Wilson, the ideas could have come from anyone as a committee that could include Broccoli, Maibaum, Wilson, Glen and [[stunt coordinator]]s worked on the outlines.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=135}} Much of the inspiration for the stories for the film came from two Fleming short stories from the collection ''For Your Eyes Only'': "[[Risico]]" and "[[For Your Eyes Only (short story)|For Your Eyes Only]]".{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=175}} Another set-piece from the novel of ''Live and Let Die''—the [[keelhauling]]—which was unused in that novel's adaptation, was inserted into the plot.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=135}}

Production of ''For Your Eyes Only'' began on 2 September 1980 in the [[North Sea]], with three days shooting exterior scenes for the scenes involving the ''St Georges'' spyboat.&lt;ref name="inside FYEO" /&gt; The interiors were shot later in Pinewood Studios, as well as the ship's explosion, which was done with a miniature in Pinewood's tank on the 007 Stage.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|pp=138–139}} On 15 September principal photography started in Corfu at the Villa Sylva at Kanoni, above [[Corfu (city)|Corfu Town]], which acted as the location of the Spanish villa.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=292}}

In October filming moved to other Greek locations, including Meteora and the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]].&lt;ref name="inside FYEO" /&gt; In November the main unit moved to England, which included interior work in Pinewood, while the second unit shot underwater scenes in [[the Bahamas]]. On 1 January 1981 production moved to [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] in Italy, where filming wrapped in February.&lt;ref name="inside FYEO" /&gt; Many of the underwater scenes, especially involving close-ups of Bond and Melina, were shot on a [[Dry for wet|dry soundstage]]. A combination of lighting effects, slow-motion photography, wind, and bubbles added in post-production, gave the illusion of the actors being underwater.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=292}} The pre-credits sequence used a church in [[Stoke Poges]] as a cemetery, while scenes involving a helicopter were filmed at the abandoned [[Beckton Gas Works]] in London.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=138}}

The score of ''For Your Eyes Only'' was written by [[Bill Conti]], who retained a number of John Barry-influenced brass elements in the score but also added elements of dance and funk music.&lt;ref name="allmusic" /&gt;

====''Octopussy'' (1983) ====
In 1980 United Artists, which had provided much of the funding for the Bond films, fell into financial difficulties following the box office failure of ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'' (1980), bringing uncertainty to the future of the funding. The situation was resolved in May 1981, when [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] acquired United Artists.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=144}}

Following ''For Your Eyes Only'', Roger Moore had expressed a desire to stop playing James Bond. His original contract had been for three films, a requirement fulfilled with ''The Spy Who Loved Me''. Subsequent films had been negotiated on a film-by-film basis. The producers engaged in a semi-public quest for the next actor to play Bond, which would be for ''[[Octopussy]]''. However, when Kevin McClory announced his re-working of ''Thunderball'' as ''[[Never Say Never Again]]'', the producers re-contracted Moore in the belief that an established actor in the role would fare better against McClory's choice of Bond, Sean Connery.&lt;ref name="Inside OP" /&gt; Before ''For Your Eyes Only'' had been released, Albert Broccoli had asked John Glen to return and direct ''Octopussy''.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=186}} [[George MacDonald Fraser]] wrote an initial treatment that was extensively revised by Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=146}}

First unit filming began on 10 August 1982 at the [[Berlin Wall]] crossing point [[Checkpoint Charlie]],{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=147}} although the second unit had already been at work for a few weeks, filming scenes for a mid-air fight sequence.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=295}} The [[Monsoon Palace]] served as the exterior of villain Kamal Khan's palace, while scenes set at the palace of titular character [[Octopussy (character)|Octopussy]] were filmed at the [[Lake Palace]] and [[Jag Mandir]]. Bond's hotel was the [[Shiv Niwas Palace]]. In England [[RAF Northolt]], [[RAF Upper Heyford]] and [[RAF Oakley]] were the main locations. Scenes set at the Karl-Marx-Stadt railways scenes were shot at the [[Nene Valley Railway]], while studio work was undertaken at Pinewood Studios and 007 Stage. Filming finished on 21 January 1983.&lt;ref name="Inside OP" /&gt;{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|pp=147–148 }} John Barry returned to score, having passed on ''For Your Eyes Only'' for tax reasons. While Barry wrote the title song, "[[All Time High]]", [[Tim Rice]] wrote the lyrics and the song was performed by [[Rita Coolidge]].{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=186}}

''Octopussy'' had its premiere on 6 June 1983, four months before the October release of ''Never Say Never Again''. From its budget of $27.5&amp;nbsp;million, ''Octopussy'' took $183.7&amp;nbsp;million at the box office,{{sfn|Block|Autrey Wilson|2010|p=429}} a figure which saw it surpass the takings of its Connery-led rival, which took $160&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Numbers.com"/&gt;

===Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson (1984–1989)===
In 1984 Michael G. Wilson joined Albert R. Broccoli as co-producer at Eon. Wilson had first worked on a Bond production in February 1964 with the filming of ''Goldfinger''. He had worked on every production since ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', and had been executive producer on ''Moonraker'', ''For Your Eyes Only'' and ''Octopussy''.{{sfn|Rubin|2003|p=456}}

====''A View to a Kill'' (1985) ====
The day before the UK premiere of the non-Eon rival Bond film, ''Never Say Never Again'', Eon announced that Roger Moore would return as Bond for the seventh time.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=161}} John Glen also returned as director, while Peter Lamont and John Barry also signed up as they had for ''Octopussy''.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=296}} Michael G. Wilson co-wrote the screenplay with Richard Maibaum.{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=115}}

On 27 June 1984 the 007 Stage was almost entirely destroyed by fire.&lt;ref name="BBC: stage fire" /&gt; It was rebuilt in time for production and reopened in January 1985, when it was renamed the "Albert Broccoli 007 Stage".{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=162}} The second unit started filming in Iceland in July 1984, while principal photography with Moore commenced on 1 August at Pinewood.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=162}} Also in August, the second unit filmed in Paris, including scenes involving a parachute jump from the [[Eiffel Tower]].{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=289}}

The [[Amberley Museum &amp; Heritage Centre]] doubled as the exterior of villain [[Max Zorin]]'s mine, while the scenes in the complex under Zorin's stables were filmed in a Renault plant in [[Swindon]],&lt;ref name="BBC Renault"&gt;{{cite news|URL=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-wiltshire-24163811/|title=Swindon's 'View To A Kill' warehouse given listed status|publisher=BBC|date=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; before primary filming moved to San Francisco.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=296}} Filming finished in January 1985 at the 007 Stage, with the filming of the interior of Zorin's mine, designed by Peter Lamont.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=163}}

====''The Living Daylights'' (1987) ====
With the retirement of Roger Moore following ''A View to a Kill'', the producers searched for a new Bond and eventually cast [[Timothy Dalton]] in the lead role in August 1986.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=170}} Much of the senior production crew from the previous film worked on ''[[The Living Daylights]]'', with John Glen directing, John Barry providing the score and Peter Lamont acting as production designer.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=217}} Michael G. Wilson and Richard Maibaum again provided the script and initially proposed a [[prequel]], showing Bond's first mission,&lt;ref name="Inside TLD" /&gt; although this was turned down by Broccoli.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=168}} Script work continued while the producers searched for Moore's successor.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=170}}

The film was shot at the 007 Stage at Pinewood Studios, with principal photography starting on 29 September 1986,{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=170}} before moving to Vienna on 5 October, where the crew filmed for two weeks.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=171}} Meanwhile, the second unit had started work on the pre-credits sequence on Gibraltar on 17 September before moving to Morocco.&lt;ref name="Inside TLD" /&gt; Filming finished on 13 February 1987.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=172}}

''The Living Daylights'' was the twelfth and final Bond film to be scored by composer John Barry.{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=234}} The title song of the film, "[[The Living Daylights (song)|The Living Daylights]]", was co-written with [[Paul Waaktaar-Savoy]] of the Norwegian pop-music group [[A-ha]] and recorded by them. The group and Barry did not collaborate well, resulting in two versions of the theme song.&lt;ref name="UKC4TV" /&gt;

The production costs of ''The Living Daylights'' were $40&amp;nbsp;million, and the film posted box office results of $191.2&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfn|Block|Autrey Wilson|2010|p=429}}

====''Licence to Kill'' (1989) ====
Shortly after the release of ''The Living Daylights'', producers Albert R. Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson and writer Richard Maibaum started discussing its successor. They decided that the film would retain a realistic style, as well as showing the "darker edge" of the Bond character. For the primary location, the producers wanted a place where the series had not yet visited.&lt;ref name="Inside LTK" /&gt; While China was visited after an invitation by its government, the idea fell through partly because the 1987 film ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' had removed some of the novelty from filming in China.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=176}} By this stage the writers had already talked about a chase sequence along the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], as well as a fight scene amongst the [[Terracotta Army]].{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=300}} Wilson also wrote two plot outlines about a drug lord in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] before the plans fell through.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=300}} The writers eventually decided on a setting in a tropical country while Broccoli negotiated to film in Mexico,&lt;ref name="Inside LTK" /&gt; at the [[Estudios Churubusco]] in Mexico City.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=300}} In 1985 the Films Act was passed, removing the [[Eady Levy]], which resulted in foreign artists being taxed more heavily.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=176}} The associated rising costs to Eon Productions meant no part of ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' was filmed in the UK,{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=239}} the first Bond film not to do so.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=176}} Pinewood Studios, used in every ''Bond'' film that far, housed only the post-production and sound re-recording.&lt;ref name="Inside LTK" /&gt;

The initial outline of what would become ''Licence to Kill'' was drawn up by Wilson and Maibaum.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=176}} Before the pair could develop the script, the [[Writers Guild of America]] (WGA) went on [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike|strike]] and Maibaum was unable to continue writing, leaving Wilson to work on the script on his own.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=234}} The script—initially called ''Licence Revoked''—was written with Dalton's characterisation of Bond in mind;{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=176}} the obsession with which Bond pursues the drug lord villain Franz Sanchez on behalf of Bond's friend, the [[CIA]]/[[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agent [[Felix Leiter]] and his dead wife is seen as being because of Bond's own "brutally cut-short marriage".{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=225}}

John Glen returned once again to direct, teaming up once more with production designer Peter Lamont.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=300}} Principal photography ran from 18 July to 18 November 1988.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=178}} Shooting began in Mexico, which mostly doubled for the fictional Republic of Isthmus.&lt;ref name="Inside LTK" /&gt; Other underwater sequences were shot at the [[Isla Mujeres]] near [[Cancún]].{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=185}} In August 1988 production moved to the [[Florida Keys]], notably [[Key West]].&lt;ref name="Inside LTK" /&gt; [[Seven Mile Bridge]] towards [[Pigeon Key]] was used for the sequence in which the armoured truck transporting Sanchez following his arrest is driven off the edge. Other locations there included the [[Ernest Hemingway House]], [[Key West International Airport]], Mallory Square, St. Mary's Star of the Sea Church for Leiter's wedding and Stephano's House 707 South Street for his house and patio. The [[US Coast Guard]] Pier was used to film Isthmus City harbour.&lt;ref name="Inside LTK" /&gt;

John Barry was not available to score the film because of throat surgery, so the soundtrack's score was composed and conducted by [[Michael Kamen]], who was known for scoring many action films at the time, such as ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' and ''[[Die Hard]]''.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=231-2}} The film's darker and more violent plot elicited calls for cuts by the British Board of Film Classification.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=169}}

''Licence to Kill'' marked the end of the involvement for a number of long-term crew members, including John Glen, Maurice Binder, Richard Maibaum and cinematographer Alec Mills. It was also the final film which was produced by the partnership of Albert Broccoli and Michael Wilson.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=301}}

===Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli (1990–present)===

The relatively disappointing box office returns for ''Licence to Kill'' led to Albert Broccoli questioning his own leadership of the series, and he put Danjaq, holders of the Bond film copyright, up for sale.{{sfn|Moore|2012|p=160}}{{efn|The asking price for Danjaq remains uncertain, with some sources quoting £200&amp;nbsp;million{{sfn|Moore|2012|p=160}} and others quoting $200&amp;nbsp;million.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=180}}}} Timothy Dalton was quoted at the time as saying "My feeling is this will be the last one. I don't mean my last one, I mean the end of the whole lot. I don't speak with any real authority, but it's sort of a feeling I have".{{sfn|Moore|2012|p=161}}

In 1990 the situation was further complicated when MGM/UA was sold to [[Qintex]], which wanted to then merge with [[Pathé|Pathé Communications]]; the Bond back catalogue was leased to Pathé at a lower-than-market value, without consulting Danjaq – who sued MGM/UA Communications, which was itself the target of a failed takeover bid by Pathé. In August 1990 Albert Broccoli appointed his daughter [[Barbara Broccoli]] alongside Michael G. Wilson as producers at Eon, while he concentrated on matters at Danjaq.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=161}} The dispute between Danjaq and MGM/UA was protracted and delayed production of Bond 17, but was finally settled in 1993.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=211}}

The new producers changed the policy of behind-the-scenes continuity prevalent in the series up to that point and, from the 1990s onwards, there were more changes in key production roles, including employing directors "on a 'guest director' footing".{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=260}}

====''GoldenEye'' (1995) ====
[[File:Martin Campbell.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Martin Campbell]], who directed ''[[GoldenEye]]'' and ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'']]
Despite the legal action, pre-production towards Bond 17 still progressed, with some early details unveiled at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] which took place in May 1990.{{sfn|Moore|2012|p=161}} However, delays occurred because of the ongoing legal action with MGM/UA and, in an August 1993 interview, Dalton revealed that [[Michael France]] was involved in writing a script for the next Bond film, with [[Anthony Hopkins]] as a potential villain, adding that Hopkins had been in discussions with Eon for a number of weeks. Dalton also stated that the earliest production could begin would be in January or February 1994.&lt;ref name="D Mail: Davis &amp; Dalton" /&gt; Dalton's six-year contract expired in 1993, and after reading France's script for what would become ''[[GoldenEye]]'', he announced on 12 April 1994 that he would not be returning to play Bond; he was replaced by [[Pierce Brosnan]].{{sfn|Moore|2012|p=161}} After Michael France delivered the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine was brought in to rework much of the material.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=185}} [[Kevin Wade]] was also brought into the process before [[Bruce Feirstein]] gave the final polish to the script.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=249}}

With Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson as co-producers, Albert Broccoli oversaw the production of ''GoldenEye'' as consulting producer but is credited as "presenter".{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=289}} [[John Woo]] was approached to direct the film, but he turned down the opportunity, saying he was honoured by the offer.{{sfn|Heard|2000|p=138}} The producers then chose [[Martin Campbell]] to lead the film.{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=289}}

Principal photography started on 16 January 1995 and continued until 6 June.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=188}} The producers were unable to use Pinewood Studios, the usual location for Bond films, because it had been reserved for ''[[First Knight]]'', so an old [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] factory at the Leavesden Aerodrome in [[Hertfordshire]] was converted into a [[Leavesden Film Studios|new studio]].{{sfn|Goldsmith|O'Regan|2005|p=144}} In February the crew moved to Monaco and Monte Carlo for scenes in a casino and a demonstration of a Tiger helicopter.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=188}}{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=171}} The pre-credits sequence involved a [[bungee jump]], which was filmed at the [[Contra Dam]] near Locarno, Switzerland.&lt;ref name="GE bungee" /&gt; Reference footage for a scene consisting of a tank chase was shot on location in [[St. Petersburg]] and matched to sets built at the Leavesden studio by production designer Peter Lamont.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=171}} Scenes on a satellite dish were shot at [[Arecibo Observatory]] in [[Puerto Rico]],{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=303}} while in the UK, [[Epsom Downs Racecourse]] and the Nene Valley Railway were both used.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=188}} For the scenes of the fictional Russian location of Severnaya, and other effects, Derek Meddings built a number of miniature sets at Leavesden. Meddings had worked on the Bond films since ''Live and Let Die'' and died before the film's release; ''GoldenEye'' was dedicated to his memory.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=188}}

The soundtrack to ''GoldenEye'' was composed and performed by [[Éric Serra]]. Prolific Bond composer John Barry turned down an offer by Barbara Broccoli to score the film.&lt;ref name="FSM: Barry" /&gt; The theme song, "[[GoldenEye (song)|GoldenEye]]", was written by [[Bono]] and [[The Edge]], and was performed by [[Tina Turner]]. As Serra did not collaborate with Bono or The Edge, orchestral versions of the song did not appear throughout ''GoldenEye'', as had been the case in previous James Bond films.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=177}}

====''Tomorrow Never Dies'' (1997) ====
Before ''GoldenEye'' had been released in November 1995, MGM/UA started their preparations for [[Tomorrow Never Dies|Bond 18]], intending for a release in early December 1997, &lt;!--- The studio initially wanted to release the film over US Thanksgiving weekend in November 1997; when this was no longer practical, the studio sought a Christmas release.

The story was based on a previously discarded treatment by [[Donald E. Westlake]], which had been written before ''GoldenEye''. &lt;!--- Other sources claim that nothing in Westlake's treatment wound up in the shooting script. Wikipedia's Westlake article claims "Westlake also wrote a treatment for the James Bond film Tomorrow Never Dies, which was adapted later by several screenwriters. How much of Westlake's story ended up in the screenplay is unknown; he does not receive either a story or screenplay credit for the finished film, suggesting that little if any of his original work was used". I vaguely recall that Westlake's script involved gold smuggling. ---&gt; The script was given a re-working by Bruce Feirstein, based on the [[Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|return of Hong Kong to the Chinese]].{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=194}} Feirstein's script was then contributed to by [[Nicholas Meyer]] before being reworked by Dan Petrie Jr. and [[David C.

[[Joe Dante]] and then [[Peter Jackson]] were considered as directors for ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]''. Barbara Broccoli enjoyed Jackson's ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'', and a screening of ''[[The Frighteners]]'' was arranged for her. She disliked the latter film, however, and showed no further interest in Jackson.{{sfn|Sibley|2010|pp=397–398}} [[Michael Apted]] was then selected to lead the film.&lt;ref name="BFI: TWINE" /&gt; Writers [[Neal Purvis and Robert Wade]] were hired after their work in ''[[Plunkett &amp; Macleane]]'',{{sfn|Priggé|2004|p=27}} before Michael Apted and his wife, screenwriter [[Dana Stevens (screenwriter)|Dana Stevens]], undertook an uncredited rewrite.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=277}} Pierce Brosnan was unhappy with some of Stevens' changes to his character, so Michael G.

Production was centred at Pinewood Studios and principal photography began there on 11 January 1999 with scenes from inside the [[SIS Building|MI6 offices]], designed by Peter Lamont.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=208}} The pre-title sequence was shot in [[Bilbao]], Spain, in February, with production moving to [[Chamonix]], France, which doubled for the [[Caucasus]] scenes.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=208}} The exterior of a Kazakh nuclear facility was shot at the [[Bardenas Reales]], in [[Navarre]], Spain,&lt;ref name="Making TWINE" /&gt; while the exterior of an oil refinery control centre was doubled by the [[Motorola]] building in Groundwell, [[Swindon]].&lt;ref name="TWINE: Swindon" /&gt; The exterior of the oil pipeline was filmed in [[Cwm Dyli]], [[Snowdonia]], Wales, while the production teams shot the oil pipeline explosion in [[Hankley Common]], [[Elstead]], Surrey.

====''Die Another Day'' (2002)====
[[Lee Tamahori]] was hired to direct ''[[Die Another Day]]''; Barbara Broccoli admired his film ''[[Once Were Warriors]]'', calling it "a phenomenal piece of filmmaking".{{sfn|Priggé|2004|p=27}} Broccoli noted that she and Wilson "sensed his genuine enthusiasm for Bond. It was simply great chemistry. Lee was the right guy and we were very, very lucky to get him".{{sfn|Priggé|2004|p=27}} Screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade returned and began work in the summer of 2000 with the producers.

In 1999 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer obtained the rights to the 1967 film ''Casino Royale'' from [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] for $10&amp;nbsp;million in the out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit. The case was brought by MGM after Sony had announced a deal with Kevin McClory to produce a third version of the ''Thunderball'' novel, for which McClory held the film rights. McClory had previously acted as producer with Eon on ''Thunderball'' and had licensed his rights for the production of ''Never Say Never Again'' in 1983.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=213}}&lt;ref name="NYT: CR" /&gt; In 2004, following severe financial troubles, MGM was itself acquired by a consortium backed by Sony for $5 billion.&lt;ref name="CNN: Sony &amp; MGM" /&gt;

[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|''Casino Royale'']] [[Reboot (fiction)|reboots]] the series, establishing a new timeline and narrative framework not meant to precede or succeed any previous ''Bond'' film.&lt;ref name="D Tel: reboot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN: reboot" /&gt; Barbara Broccoli stated that "For years, my father wanted to make ''Casino Royale''—it's the Holy Grail&amp;nbsp;... We wanted to make a tougher film, the way it should have been made years ago".{{sfn|Burlingame|2012|p=236}} Fellow producer Michael G. Wilson agreed, commenting "We felt the last film was too fantastical, so we decided to go back to the basics and update".{{sfn|Burlingame|2012|p=236}} Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay at the end of February 2004, while Pierce Brosnan was still Bond.&lt;ref name="Empire: CR script" /&gt; [[Paul Haggis]] was brought in later, and his main contribution included rewriting the climax of the film. He explained that "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why but I thought that [[Vesper Lynd|Vesper [Lynd]]] had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her".&lt;ref name="Guardian: Lawson" /&gt; In February 2005 Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director and the next Bond film was revealed to be ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'', although the identity of the new Bond was still unknown;&lt;ref name="BBC: Campbell &amp; CR" /&gt; the producers had chosen not to renew Pierce Brosnan's contract, and in October Eon announced that the part of Bond would be taken by [[Daniel Craig]].&lt;ref name="Guardian: Craig" /&gt;{{sfn|Life Magazine|2012|p=67}}

Principal photography for ''Casino Royale'' commenced on 3 January 2006. The film was primarily shot at [[Barrandov Studios]] in Prague, with additional location shooting in the Bahamas, Italy and the United Kingdom. The shoot concluded at Pinewood Studios on 20 July 2006.&lt;ref name="JB 4 Real" /&gt;&lt;ref name="H Rep: Craig" /&gt; In the Bahamas filming took place at [[Paradise Island]]&lt;ref name="Indep: Paradise" /&gt; and Albany House, an estate owned by golfers [[Ernie Els]] and [[Tiger Woods]].&lt;ref name="Els: Albany" /&gt; Footage set in [[Mbale]], Uganda, was filmed at [[Black Park]], a Country Park in [[Buckinghamshire]],&lt;ref name="D Tel: Blk Prk" /&gt; with further UK location shooting taking place at the [[Dunsfold Aerodrome]] in Surrey and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in [[Bedfordshire]].&lt;ref name="CR: Location" /&gt;

For many of the effects in the film, Special Effects and Miniature Effects Supervisor [[Chris Corbould]] used a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects compared with previous Bond films. Corbould noted that, "CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It's the best way to go".&lt;ref name="JB 4 Real" /&gt; Corbould used the 007 stage at Pinewood for the sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film, which featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film.&lt;ref name="JB 4 Real" /&gt; ''Casino Royale'' featured music composed by David Arnold, his fourth soundtrack for the Bond film series. Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced on 26 July 2006 that [[Chris Cornell]] would perform the title song, entitled "[[You Know My Name]]", which he co-wrote with Arnold.&lt;ref name="CR Song" /&gt;

====''Quantum of Solace'' (2008)====
In July 2006, as ''Casino Royale'' entered post-production, Eon Productions announced that the next film would be based on an original idea by producer Michael G. Wilson.&lt;ref name="HR: launch" /&gt; In June 2007 [[Marc Forster]] was confirmed as director.&lt;ref name="HR: Forster" /&gt; He was surprised that he was approached for the job, stating he was not a big Bond film fan through the years, and that he would not have accepted the project had he not seen ''Casino Royale'' prior to making his decision: he felt Bond had been humanised in that film, arguing that because travelling the world had become less exotic since the series' advent, it made sense to focus more on Bond as a character.&lt;ref name="NYT: Inner Bond" /&gt; Forster found ''Casino Royale''{{'}}s 144-minute running time too long, and wanted his follow-up to be "tight and fast&amp;nbsp;... like a bullet".&lt;ref name=bullet /&gt;

Neal Purvis and Robert Wade returned as screenwriters and completed a draft of the script by April 2007;&lt;ref name="Var: Barbarella" /&gt; Paul Haggis also worked on the script, completing it two hours before the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]] officially began.&lt;ref name="NYT: Inner Bond" /&gt; Further work on the script had to be undertaken by Forster and Daniel Craig, who said later, "We had the bare bones of a script and then there was a writers' strike and there was nothing we could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes – and a writer I am not".&lt;ref name="TO: Craig" /&gt; Craig also admitted that the film was not initially meant to be a sequel, but it became one because of the re-writes undertaken by him and Forster.&lt;ref name="TO: Craig" /&gt; Haggis located his draft's climax in the [[Swiss Alps]],&lt;ref name="empire: QoS" /&gt; but Forster wanted the action sequences to allude to the four [[classical element]]s of earth, water, air and fire.&lt;ref name="variety: QoS" /&gt; Michael G. Wilson decided on the film's title ''[[Quantum of Solace]]'' only "a few days" before its announcement on 24 January 2008.&lt;ref name=bbctitle /&gt; Forster hired [[Dennis Gassner]] as production designer, replacing Peter Lamont.&lt;ref name="Arch D: Gassner" /&gt;{{sfn|Cork|Stutz|2007|p=295}}

''Quantum of Solace'' was shot in six countries, including Italy (Talamone and Siena), Chile (the [[Paranal Observatory]]), Austria (Bregenz), Mexico, Panama and the UK.&lt;ref name=artfilm /&gt;&lt;ref name="D Tel: LA" /&gt; In the UK interior and exterior airport scenes were filmed at [[Farnborough Airfield]] and the snowy closing scenes were filmed at the Bruneval Barracks in [[Aldershot]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connop Price |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.gethampshire.co.uk/news/s/2038353_barracks_and_airport_provide_location_for_bond_film |title=Barracks and airport provide location for Bond film |accessdate=18 November 2012 |date=30 October 2008 |work=Get Hampshire |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913050519/http://www.gethampshire.co.uk/news/s/2038353_barracks_and_airport_provide_location_for_bond_film |archivedate=13 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ten stages at Pinewood and two theatres for [[Automated Dialogue Replacement|ADR]] work.&lt;ref name="PW: QoS" /&gt; David Arnold, who composed the scores for the previous four Bond films, returned for ''Quantum of Solace''. He said that Forster likes to work very closely with his composers and that, in comparison to the accelerated schedule he was tied to on ''Casino Royale'', the intention was to spend a long time scoring the film to "really work it out". He also said he would be "taking a different approach" with the score.&lt;ref name="S&amp;S int" /&gt; [[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] of [[The White Stripes]] and [[Alicia Keys]] collaborated on "[[Another Way to Die]]", the first Bond music duet.&lt;ref name="Billboard: White &amp; Keys" /&gt;

====''Skyfall'' (2012) ====
[[File:Thomas Newman.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Thomas Newman]] scored the 2012 film ''[[Skyfall]]''.]]
The production of ''[[Skyfall]]'' was suspended throughout 2010 because of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer#Attempted sale and bankruptcy protection|MGM's financial troubles]].&lt;ref name="BBC: MGM" /&gt; Eon resumed pre-production following MGM's exit from bankruptcy on 21 December 2010 and in January 2011 the film was given official approval, with production scheduled to start in late 2011.&lt;ref name="BBC: Approval" /&gt; The film's budget is estimated to be between $150&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref name="harlow1" /&gt; and $200&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name="BOM:Skyfall" /&gt; compared to the $200&amp;nbsp;million spent on ''[[Quantum of Solace]]''.&lt;ref name="200m-Quantum" /&gt;

''Skyfall'' was directed by [[Sam Mendes]], who first signed on to the project shortly after ''Quantum of Solace'' was released, and remained on board as a consultant during the period of uncertainty surrounding MGM's financial situation. Speculation in the media suggested that Mendes had commissioned rewrites of the script to "[remove] action scenes in favour of 'characterful performances'", with the intention of bidding for an Academy Award.&lt;ref name="TF: Oscar" /&gt; Mendes denied the reports, stating that the film's planned action scenes were an important part of the overall film.&lt;ref name="Conference recording"/&gt;

The script was written by Bond screenwriting regulars Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, as well as [[John Logan (writer)|John Logan]].&lt;ref name="BBC: Skyfall announce" /&gt; [[Roger Deakins]] signed on as cinematographer, while Dennis Gassner returned as production designer.&lt;ref name="Time: Skyfall" /&gt; [[Thomas Newman]], who worked with Sam Mendes as composer for ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'', ''[[Road to Perdition]]'', ''[[Jarhead (film)|Jarhead]]'' and ''[[Revolutionary Road (film)|Revolutionary Road]]'', replaced David Arnold as composer;&lt;ref name="Empire:SF sound" /&gt; British singer-songwriter [[Adele]] co-wrote and recorded [[Skyfall (Adele song)|the film's theme song]] with her regular songwriter, [[Paul Epworth]].&lt;ref name="Adele theme" /&gt;

Principal photography was scheduled to take 133 days&lt;ref name="Hollywood:Skyfall" /&gt; and began on 7 November 2011 in and around London.&lt;ref name="Conference recording" /&gt; Production moved to Turkey in April 2012,&lt;ref name="April 2012" /&gt; with parts of Istanbul—including the [[Spice Bazaar, Istanbul|Spice Bazaar]], [[New Mosque (Istanbul)|Yeni Camii]], the [[Istanbul Main Post Office|Main Post Office]], [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Sultanahmet Square]] and the [[Grand Bazaar, Istanbul|Grand Bazaar]]—closed for filming in April.&lt;ref name="April 2012"/&gt; Filming also took place in Shanghai.&lt;ref name="Conference recording"/&gt; Although set in Scotland, Bond's family home of Skyfall was constructed on Hankley Common in Surrey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lefley|first=Jack|title=Blown Skyfall High|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|date=26 March 2012|location=London|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; using plywood and plaster to build a full-scale model of the building,&lt;ref name="Herald: Skyfall" /&gt; with some exterior scenes shot in [[Glen Etive]] and [[Glencoe, Scotland|Glencoe]].&lt;ref name="BBC: Etive" /&gt;

A further agent's part was then written for [[Terence Cooper]], to cover Sellers' departure,{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=252}}{{efn|Various theories have been given about the animosity between the two actors, including Sellers trying to get Welles to laugh and Welles not responding; Sellers hearing a young woman comment that Welles was sexy; Sellers' comments about Welles' weight being objected to; and Sellers' jealousy at Welles' friendship with [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]], who was also a friend of Sellers.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=31}} Sellers' biographer Peter Evans declared that, "the real reason for this&amp;nbsp;... hostility is still uncertain",{{sfn|Evans|1980|p=130}} while another biographer, [[Ed Sikov]] commented that others were as much to blame for problems with the film.{{sfn|Sikov|2002|p=252}}}} while re-writes, additional filming and post-production cutting compensated for the missing actor.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|pp=60–61}} Principal photography started on 11 January 1966 and was scheduled to take up to 26 weeks.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=58}} Because of the delays and chaotic nature of the filming process, it finally finished ten months later in November.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=64}}

Feldman asked [[Burt Bacharach]] and [[Hal David]] to provide the music for the film; David worked for a few months completing his part, while Bacharach took nearly two years.{{sfn|Burlingame|2012|p=61}} The pair produced the song "[[The Look of Love (1967 song)|The Look of Love]]", which was sung by [[Dusty Springfield]].{{sfn|Burlingame|2012|p=64}} [[Columbia Pictures]] approved a production budget of $6&amp;nbsp;million for the film,{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=58}} although this rose to $12&amp;nbsp;million at the end of production.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=64}} The film performed well, with box office returns of $41.7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Numbers: CR67" /&gt;

===Jack Schwartzman (1983)===
''Never Say Never Again'' had its origins in the early 1960s following the controversy over the 1961 ''Thunderball'' novel, which led to Kevin McClory becoming producer of the Eon Productions film of [[#Kevin McClory (1965)|the same name]].{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=213}} Part of the agreement between McClory and Eon was that McClory would not make any further version of the novel for a period of ten years following the release of the 1965 ''Thunderball''.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=184}}

In the mid-1970s McClory again started working on a project to bring a ''Thunderball'' adaptation to production and, with the working title ''Warhead'' (a.k.a. ''James Bond of the Secret Service''){{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=184}} he brought writer [[Len Deighton]] together with Sean Connery to work on a script.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=152}} The script ran into difficulties after accusations from Eon Productions that the project had gone beyond copyright restrictions, which confined McClory to a film based on the ''Thunderball'' novel only, and once again the project was deferred.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=184}} Towards the end of the 1970s developments were reported on the project under the name ''James Bond of the Secret Service'',{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=184}} but then producer [[Jack Schwartzman]] became involved and cleared a number of the legal issues that still surrounded the project and licensed the rights from McClory.{{sfn|Pfeiffer|Worrall|1998|p=213}}{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=153}}

====''Never Say Never Again'' (1983)====
With Connery still committed to the project,{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=154}} producer Jack Schwartzman asked him to play Bond: Connery accepted, asking for and receiving a fee of $3 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3|1983}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars),{{inflation-fn|US|df=yes}} a percentage of the profits, as well as casting, script and director approval.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=154}} Schwartzman then brought on board scriptwriter [[Lorenzo Semple Jr.]]{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=240}} to work on the screenplay. Connery was unhappy with some aspects of the work and asked British television writers [[Dick Clement]] and [[Ian La Frenais]]&lt;ref name="BFI: C&amp;LF" /&gt; to undertake re-writes, although they went uncredited for their efforts because of a restriction by the Writers Guild of America.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=155}}

The former Eon Productions editor and director of ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'', Peter Hunt, was approached to direct the film but declined due to his previous work with Eon.&lt;ref name="retro news" /&gt; [[Irvin Kershner]], who had achieved success in 1980 with ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', was then hired. A number of the crew from the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' were also appointed, including first assistant director [[David Tomblin]]; [[Cinematographer|director of photography]] [[Douglas Slocombe]] and production designers Philip Harrison and [[Stephen B. Grimes|Stephen Grimes]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=243}}{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=197}}

Filming for ''Never Say Never Again'' began on 27 September 1982 on the [[French Riviera]] for two months{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=155}} before moving to Nassau, the Bahamas in mid-November{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=240}} where filming took place at Clifton Pier, which was also one of the locations used in ''Thunderball''.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=156}} The Spanish city of [[Almería]] was also used as a location.&lt;ref name="mail: Armstrong" /&gt; Villain Maximillian Largo's Palmyran fortress was actually historic [[Fort Carré]] in [[Antibes]].{{sfn|Reeves|2001|p=134}} Principal photography finished at [[Elstree Studios]] where interior shots were filmed.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=156}} Elstree also housed the "Tears of Allah" underwater cavern, which took three months to construct.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=156}} Most of the filming was completed in the spring of 1983, although there was some additional shooting during the summer of 1983.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=240}}

Production on the film was troubled{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=199}} with Connery taking on many of the production duties with assistant director David Tomblin.{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=156}} Director Irvin Kershner was critical of producer Jack Schwartzman, saying that whilst he was a good businessman "he didn't have the experience of a film producer".{{sfn|Barnes|Hearn|2001|p=156}} After the production ran out of money, Schwartzman had to fund further production out of his own pocket and later admitted he had underestimated the amount the film would cost to make.{{sfn|Smith|Lavington|2002|p=199}}

The music for ''Never Say Never Again'' was written by [[Michel Legrand]].&lt;ref name="film score" /&gt; Legrand also wrote the main theme "Never Say Never Again", which featured lyrics by [[Alan Bergman|Alan]] and [[Marilyn Bergman]]—who had also worked with Legrand in the Academy Award-winning song "[[The Windmills of Your Mind]]"&lt;ref name="Oscar 1968" /&gt;—and was performed by [[Lani Hall]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=243}}

Fleming's estate, financially backed by Eon Productions and MGM,{{sfn|Sellers|2008|p=199}} made a final attempt to block the film in the High Courts in London in the spring of 1983, but this was thrown out by the court and ''Never Say Never Again'' was permitted to proceed.{{sfn|Chapman|2009|p=185}} When ''Never Say Never Again'' was released, it grossed $9.72 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|9.72|1983}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars){{inflation-fn|US|df=yes}} on its first weekend,&lt;ref name="Hanauer (1983)" /&gt; which was reported to be "the best opening record of any ''James Bond'' film"&lt;ref name="Hanauer (1983)"/&gt; up to that point and surpassing ''Octopussy''{{'}}s $8.9 million (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|8.9|1983}}}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars){{inflation-fn|US|df=yes}} from June that year.&lt;ref name="BOM: Octo" /&gt; From its budget of $36&amp;nbsp;million, ''Never Say Never Again'' grossed $160&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="Numbers.com" /&gt;

McClory attempted to produce another ''Thunderball'' adaptation  as ''Warhead 2000 AD'' following the success of ''GoldenEye'' in 1995.&lt;ref name="Rye (2006)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYP: Warhead" /&gt; [[Liam Neeson]] and Timothy Dalton were considered for 007,{{sfn|Sellers|2008|p=232}} while [[Roland Emmerich]] and [[Dean Devlin]] were developing the film at [[Columbia Pictures]]. MGM launched a $25 million lawsuit against Sony, and McClory claimed a portion of the $3 billion profits from the ''Bond'' series. After a prolonged lawsuit, Sony backed down, and McClory eventually exhausted all legal avenues to pursue. As part of the settlement, MGM paid $10&amp;nbsp;million for the rights to ''Casino Royale'', which had come into Sony's possession.&lt;ref name="lost Bond" /&gt;

'''Jazzart Dance Theatre''' - is a leading contemporary dance company in [[South Africa]].  It is known not only for its combination of Western and African styles, but also for its focus on social justice and community improvement.&lt;ref name=TimeOut&gt;{{cite web|title=Jazzart Dance Theatre Review|url=http://www.timeout.com/cape-town/dance/venue/1%3A23802/jazzart-dance-theatre|publisher=Time Out Cape Town|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jazzart Dance Theatre aims to be a trransformative dance company that reflects the changing social environment of South Africa. Meanwhile, Jazzart's training programme provides dance theatre training and creative interventions to South African communities most in need of opportunities to express their artistic impulses.&lt;ref name=ITC&gt;{{cite web|title=Jazzart Dance Theatre|url=http://www.infectingthecity.com/2012/artists/jazzart|publisher=Infecting the City|accessdate=9 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Jazzart was founded in 1973 by Sonje Mayo as a modern and jazz dance studio open to students of all races.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.jazzart.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=111|publisher=Jazzart Dance Theatre|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the leadership of Sue Parker from 1978 to 1982, the studio evolved into a contemporary jazz school and part-time company, before it was handed over to Val Steyn. In 1986, Alfred Hinkel bought the company, changing artistic directorship to Dawn Langdown, John Linden and [[Jay Pather]].  Under this new leadership, the company adopted a philosophy that focused on the socio-political and economic context of their students and audiences.  The group became increasingly political throughout the [[apartheid]] regime, structuring their teaching around the populist ethos of South African political struggle.  Jazzart still strives to bring together all races in South Africa, often performing in disadvantaged communities across the nation.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

'''Lara''' ([[née]] '''Lara Lor-Van''') is a [[fictional character]] who appears in [[Superman]] comics published by [[DC Comics]]. Lara is the biological mother of Superman, and the wife of scientist [[Jor-El]]. Lara Lor-Van is Lara's full [[maiden name]], as "Lor-Van" is the name of Lara's father.&lt;ref name="superman233"&gt;''Superman'' (vol. 1) #233, January 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Superman Family'' #192, November–December 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Most depictions of Kryptonian culture show that Kryptonian women use their father's full name as their last names before marriage. After marriage, they usually are known simply by their first names, though various versions show they use their husband's full name or last name as their married last name.&lt;ref name="superman141"&gt;''Superman'' (vol. 1) #141, November 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''World of Krypton'' #1, July 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Lara's role in the Superman mythos has varied over the years, with her treatment and emphasis often depending on the decade she was written in. [[Golden Age]] and early [[Silver Age]] stories treated Lara in a lesser role compared to her husband. However, stories from the 1970s onwards depict Lara in more prominent roles; one such example is the 2004 miniseries ''[[Superman: Birthright]].''

After constructing his [[Fortress of Solitude]], Superman honored his deceased biological parents with a statue of Jor-El and Lara holding up a [[globe]] of their native planet [[Krypton (planet)|Krypton]].&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics'' #395, December 1970, et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
Lara first appeared in the ''Superman'' comic strip and was created by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Golden and Silver Age versions===
[[File:Superman 141, November 1960.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|Lara, [[Jor-El]], and [[Superman]]. From the cover of ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' (volume 1) #141 (November 1960). Art by [[Curt Swan]].]]
Lara first appeared in the ''Superman'' newspaper comic strip in 1939, where she was first named "Lora." Her first comic book appearance (after being mentioned in the 1942 text novel ''The Adventures of Superman'' by [[George Lowther (writer)|George Lowther]], where she was named "Lara" for the first time) was in ''More Fun Comics'' #101 in January–February 1945. A 1948 retelling of Superman's origin story&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' (vol. 1) #53, July–August 1948&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently delved into detail about Lara, though her more familiar [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] aspects became more firmly established starting in the late 1950s and over the course of the next several decades.

After the establishment of DC's [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|multiverse]] in the early 1960s, the Golden Age version of Superman's mother was stated as having been named "Lora", and lived on the Krypton of the [[Earth-Two]] universe.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman Family'' #202, July 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Origins'' (vol. 1) #1, April 1986&lt;/ref&gt; The Silver Age Lara, meanwhile, lived on the Krypton of the [[Earth-One]] universe.

A definitive synopsis of the Silver Age Lara's life (summarizing the various stories revealing her history) came in the 1979 miniseries ''The World of Krypton'' (not to be confused with the post-''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' late 1980s comic special of the same name).

As summarized in ''The World of Krypton'' (and in various other stories), Lara was a promising [[astronaut]] in Krypton's space program.&lt;ref name="superman233" /&gt; However, Krypton's space program was soon permanently grounded after [[Jax-Ur]] blew up one of Krypton's inhabited moons.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventure Comics'' #289, October 1961&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Lara met scientist Jor-El, with the two having several adventures together before getting married,&lt;ref name="superman141" /&gt; such as a time-traveling [[Lois Lane]] attempting to seduce Jor-El after failing to marry their son in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time later, Lara gave birth to the couple's only child, Kal-El.

Early in Jor-El and Lara's marriage, the couple are briefly watched by the [[Guardians of the Universe]], who note that Lara (or her husband) would have made an excellent [[Green Lantern]].&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' (vol. 1) #257, October 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Lara and her husband Jor-El were shown to be practitioners of the Kryptonian martial art of "klurkor".&lt;ref&gt;''The New Adventures of Superboy'' #28, April 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

When Krypton was about to explode, Lara and Jor-El placed their infant son into an escape rocket built by Jor-El. In most retellings, Jor-El wanted Lara to accompany their son to [[Earth]], but Lara refused, saying their son would have a better chance of reaching Earth without her extra weight.&lt;ref&gt;''The World of Krypton'' #3, September 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Kal-El's spaceship then took off, leaving Lara and Jor-El to perish.

===Modern Age versions===
After the 1985-1986 miniseries ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s 1986 miniseries ''The Man of Steel'' rewrote Superman's origins, details about Lara's background and character were changed. Under Byrne's version, Lara inhabited a cold, emotionally sterile Krypton where even bodily contact was forbidden. Lara's grandmother, Lady Nara, and Seyg-El, Jor-El's father, were the ones who arranged the union between them &amp;ndash; so that they might have a child who would fill an opening in the planet's Register of Citizens when another Kryptonian died a rare and untimely death. Jor-El, however, was considered a "throwback" for actually expressing emotions toward his wife Lara, and for his favoring the less sterilized days of past Kryptonian eras. In this version of the mythos, Lara was a [[librarian]] and historian of high rank and thought it horrifying that Kal-El would be sent to a "primitive" planet such as Earth. In one story, the adult Kal (now Superman) is transported to the past and encounters his parents moments before Krypton's destruction. Lara is disgusted by what she sees and tells Kal not to approach her, finding him "repellent", even as she is ashamed of her feelings. 

In the 2004 Superman miniseries ''[[Superman: Birthright]]'', Lara, along with Krypton and Jor-El, more or less again became their Silver Age versions, though with updated touches. In this version, Lara is treated as a fully equal partner to Jor-El in constructing Kal-El's spacecraft and in designing various key components.

In the 2009 series ''[[Superman: Secret Origin]]'' by Geoff Johns, Superman is first introduced to his birth mother in his teens by the spaceship that brought him to the Earth as a baby. She is introduced to Kal-El by a hologram of Jor-El as his mother. This moment shocks Superman and brings tears to Martha Kent's eyes.

Also in 2009, Lara's own family background is described. Lara Lor-Van is born into the Labor Guild, whose members are not physically abused but have no say in the choices of their lives and who, unlike the members of other guilds, cannot change guilds. Lara became a member of her husband's Science Guild when she married him and was thereby granted all the freedoms granted to other Science Guild members. A member of Krypton's Military Guild describes this as being "raised up."

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Lara is a member of Krypton's military forces. One of the most talented students on the Military Academy, Lara is both a skilled fighter and a bright scientist.

Lara appears in the "Krypton Returns" storyline. She gives her maiden name as "Lara Van-El."&lt;ref&gt;''Action Comics Annual'' (vol. 2) #2, December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==
In [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s mini-series ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Strikes Again]]'' (also referred to as DK2), '''Lara''' is the name of the daughter of Superman and Wonder Woman, with the powers of a Kryptonian and the warrior attitude of an Amazon. She has a poor opinion of people less powerful than herself and tries to persuade her father to rise above the "humans" and maybe even take over the world. He himself is torn between this and his adopted parent's view that he should use his powers to help rather than to dominate. Ultimately, he rejects the former option and reconciles with Batman.

In Art Baltazar's ''Superman Family Adventures'', Lara survived Krypton's destruction by escaping into the Phantom Zone. She is eventually freed by her son and accepted into the Superman family. Though Jor-El didn't make it out, Superman uses a specific crystal that allows him to resurrect Jor-El for 24 hours that would allow the two to spend more time with each other. When the family tries to stop [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], the villain stops his assault and moves Kandor when he discovers that Lara is pregnant, telling the group that their family isn't complete yet.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: Family Adventures''&lt;/ref&gt; Lara gives birth in Baltazar's ''Super Powers'' book, where her time in the Phantom Zone has altered the baby's DNA to look like Brainiac.&lt;ref&gt;''Super Powers''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' series ''[[Superman: The Last Family of Krypton]]'', Jor-El was able to save himself and Lara and accompany Kal-El to Earth, where Jor-El sets up the corporation JorCorp while Lara establishes the self-help movement 'Raology'. More open to adapting on Earth, she arranges for Kal-El to be discreetly adopted by the Kents so that he can live a more normal life, and later has twin children, Bru-El and Valora, whose 'stunted' genetics due to their birth on Earth mean that they only possess half of the superhuman potential of their brother. While attending a dinner in Gotham, Lara is able to save [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]] when she intercepts [[Joe Chill]]'s attempted mugging, thus unknowingly preventing the creation of [[Batman]], Jor-El's own actions further hindering the opportunity for mankind to develop its own heroes in the belief that his family are enough. Lara eventually rejects Jor-El's desire to 'micromanage' humanity out of fear of Earth being destroyed as Krypton was, relocating to her own estate of 'Lara-Land', where she uses red sun emitters to restrict her natural abilities and simply encourages spiritual growth while using Kryptonian technology to heal injuries. However, the manipulation of Lex Luthor allows him to turn her son, Bru-El, into a kryptonite-powered superhuman who nearly kills Jor-El before Lara takes the blast herself, this attack also infecting her with a secret virus that kills her after a few days of exposure.

==In other media==
Lara has appeared (usually briefly) in various media adaptations of the Superman story. However, as was the case in the older comics, Lara usually has a less prominent role than Jor-El in such depictions.

===Radio===
[[Agnes Moorehead]] portrayed Lara in the debut episode of the radio serial ''[[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|The Adventures of Superman]]'' on February 12, 1940. She reprised the role in a few later episodes.&lt;ref&gt;Tranberg, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
* In 1952, Lara was portrayed by [[Aline Towne]] in "Superman on Earth", the premiere episode of ''[[Adventures of Superman (TV series)|Adventures of Superman]]''.
* In the ''[[Super Friends]]'' episode called "The Planet Splitter", she was featured in a flashback.
* Lara was also in the ''[[Challenge of the SuperFriends]]'' episode "Secret Origins of the Super Friends".
* Lara makes an non-speaking appearance in the episode ''Foundling'' in a flashback of Superman's past in ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' where she is portrayed by Eliza Roberts.
[[File:Jor-El and Lara Lor-Van (DC Animated Universe).jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lara and her husband, [[Jor-El]], in the first episode of Bruce Timm's ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'']]
* In 1996, Lara's voice was provided by [[Finola Hughes]] in "The Last Son of Krypton", the premiere episode of ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]''. She is depicted with elements of her Silver Age and Modern Age selves, where she is headstrong and an equal partner to Jor-El, but instead of being a scientist she is an artist. She also sports the forehead hair curl that has become a characteristic trait of Superman's physical appearance.
* The Silver Age versions of Jor-El and Lara appear in the ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'' episode "Two Mice and a Baby" as they place an infant Kal-El in his ship as Krypton crumbles.
* Lara made a cameo with Jor-El in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Twilight".
* Lara has appeared in one episode of Season 3 in ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'', played by Kendall Cross. Clark was dipped in a tank of kryptonite enhanced liquid used to induce repressed memories to come to surface. His mother placed baby Kal-El into the rocket which will take him to Earth. While Jor-El was more concerned about his son fulfilling his destiny, Lara was worried no one would love him. Clark came out of his fugue screaming her name, leaving him with the reassurance that his mother had loved him (as opposed to Jor-El's apparently heartless manipulation of him, although his intentions were later confirmed to be benevolent), Martha Kent subsequently telling him "Lara" was his first word, but she and Jonathan never knew what it meant. In the episode named "Lara" of season 7, it is revealed that Lara, now played by ''[[Supergirl (1984 film)|Supergirl]]'' actress [[Helen Slater]], visited the Kent farm prior to the destruction of Krypton. Along with Kara, they hide a photograph of Lara so that Kal-El will find it. It is also noted in this episode that Lara's DNA was hidden in the blue crystal by her brother-in-law [[Zor-El]]. Pictures of Lara from this episode can be found here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kryptonsite.com/laragallery1.htm |title=Smallville "Lara" Image Gallery - with Helen Slater! |publisher=Kryptonsite.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "Blue" Lara and Zor-El are released onto Earth in corporeal form (although technically not alive). The story culminates in Clark's destruction of the crystal to rid the world of Zor-El. Although upset to again lose his mother, with her assurance that she loves him, he is able to in order to save Kara's life. The naming conventions in ''Smallville'' seem to differ from the comic book continuity. Kara refers to Lara as Lara-El at the start of the episode of "Blue." This means that females, on ''Smallville'', take their husband's last name and attach to their first. In the 10th-season episode "Abandoned!", she appears alongside [[Julian Sands]] as Jor-El, appearing in the form of a holographic message that Jor-El and Lara had recorded for Kal-El shortly before his ship was launched. After Lois travels to the Fortress to confront Jor-El about his failures as a father, the message featuring Jor-El and Lara assures their son that they have faith in him.
* Ana Franchesca Rousseau portrays Lara in the pilot of ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supergirl.tv/lara-van-el-kal-el-s-mom-in-pilot Lara, Superman's Mom In Pilot]&lt;/ref&gt; She and Jor-El are seen in flashback as scientists who sent Kal-El to Earth before Krypton's destruction. An ice sculpture of her appears in Fortress of Solitude during the episodes "Solitude" and "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Mxzylptk".

===Films===
* Lara is portrayed by [[Luana Walters]] in "Superman Comes to Earth", the first chapter of the 1948 ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' movie serial.  Portions of this depiction appear in flashback as [[Lex Luthor]] recounts the story of Krypton's destruction in "At the Mercy of Atom Man!", the seventh chapter of the 1950 serial ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]''.
* Lara was played by [[Susannah York]] in ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' ([[1978 in film|1978]]), ''[[Superman II]]'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]) and ''[[Superman IV: The Quest for Peace]]'' ([[1987 in film|1987]]) (voice only). After [[Marlon Brando]] ([[Jor-El]]) was removed from ''[[Superman II]]'', Lara took on the role as Superman's mentor, in both ''Superman II'' and ''IV''. She was later replaced by Brando's Jor-El in ''[[Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut]]'', the [[2006 in film|2006]] edit of ''Superman II''.
* In 2011's direct-to-video animated film ''[[All-Star Superman (film)|All-Star Superman]]'', Lara and her husband Jor-El appear briefly in a flashback during the moment they sent their infant son Kal-El to Earth to survive Krypton's destruction. Also, a large statue of Lara and one of Jor-El are kept by Superman in his Fortress of Solitude.
* [[Ayelet Zurer]] portrays Lara in the 2013 film ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://collider.com/ayelet-Zurer-superman-man-of-steel/116874/ | title=Ayelet Zurer Cast as Superman's Mom in MAN OF STEEL | date=25 September 2011 | accessdate=2013-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julia Ormond]] had previously been announced as cast, but dropped out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/51355 |title=Julia Ormond Out As MAN OF STEEL's Biological Mom!! |publisher=Ain't It Cool News |date=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Connie Nielsen]] was in negotiations for the role before Ormond was cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/superman-man-of-steel-connie-nielsen-harry-lennix-sandy-119735/ |title=Connie Nielsen &amp; Harry Lennix Rumored For ''Man of Steel'' |publisher=Screen Rant |date=June 15, 2011 |accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this version, she is hesitant about sending her [[Kal-El|only child]] away to a primitive world, fearing they will kill him. Even after her husband assures her that is impossible, she worries that the craft won't make it. When Zod confronts Jor-El about stealing the codex and learns of the Els' natural-born son (which is against Kryptonian Law as all children are genetically-engineered to be more efficient), he fights Jor-El while Lara punches in the launch coordinates to her son's ship and sends him to earth despite Zod's pending to Save Krypton she decides to save her son's life. She runs to her husband's side after he is killed by Zod. She attends the sentencing of Zod and his rebels into the Phantom Zone where she gives Zod a stoic and cold look even after he cryptically warns her that he will find her son. After placing her husband's corpse into a burial chamber, she watches as Krypton is destroyed. Before she dies with the rest of her people, her last words to her son were "Make a better world than ours Kal."
* An alternate universe version of Lara appears in ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'' voiced by [[Lauren Tom]].

===Video games===
* The ''Man of Steel'' version of Lara appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham]]''.
* Lara makes an appearance in the opening for the story mode from ''[[Injustice 2]]''.

===Parodies===
* Lara appeared in the ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' episode "Especially the Animal Keith Crofford" voiced by [[Vanessa Hudgens]].
* Lara and Jor-El make a cameo appearance in the animated adaptation of [[Dilbert|Dilbert (TV Series)]], at the end of the episode “Pregnancy” (in which Dilbert is accidentally impregnated by his own rocket).  To save his child from the masses who wish to use it for their own gain, Dilbert puts the child on a rocket ship and sends him into space with Dogbert programming the ship to go to Krypton (which did not explode as Jor-El had predicted), specifically to the El family home.

&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;mdash;in other words, a strategy used in the making of a [[narrative]] to relay information to the audience and, particularly, to "develop" the narrative, usually in order to make it more complete, complicated, or interesting. Literary techniques are distinguished from [[literary element]]s, which exist inherently in works of writing.

| [[Setting (narrative)|Setting]] || The setting is both the time and geographic location within a narrative or within a work of fiction. A [[literary element]], the setting initiates the main backdrop and mood of a story, often referred to as the story world.||The novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]] is set in [[Dublin]], [[Ireland]], the action taking place on a single day, 16 June 1904. The action of the novel takes place from one side of [[Dublin Bay]] to the other, opening in [[Sandycove]] to the South of the city and closing on [[Howth Head]] to the North. While the novel parallels the story of [[Odysseus]], the hero of [[Homer]]'s epic poem ''[[Odyssey]]'', whose role is carried by [[Leopold Bloom]], much of the setting is described realistically, with great attention to detail. The locations within Dublin also represent locations in the Odyssey. Bloom’s home is at 7 Eccles Street, and at the same time, Ithaca, the home of Odysseus. The Post office, [[Westland Row]] and Sweny’s pharmacy in Lombard Street represent the Dublin location for  [[Ulysses (novel)#Episode 5.2C Lotus Eaters|Episode 5, Lotus Eaters]]; the [[National Library of Ireland]] parallels [[Ulysses (novel)#Episode 9.2C Scylla and Charybdis|Episode 9, Scylla and Charybdis]] and so on.

|- valign="top"
! style="width:15%"| Name 
! style="width:30%"| Definition 
! style="width:70%"| Example
|- valign="top"
| [[Backstory]] || Story that precedes events in the story being told—past events or background that add meaning to current circumstances || Though ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' trilogy takes place in a relatively short period towards the end of the 3021-year  Third Age, the narration gives glimpses of the mythological and historical events which took place earlier in the Third age leading up to the action in the novel, and in the First and Second Age.
|- valign="top"
| [[Cliffhanger]] || The narrative ends unresolved, to draw the audience back to a future episode for the resolution. || Almost every episode of the TV shows like ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]'' and ''[[Breaking Bad]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/harrison-demchick/techniques-and-tension-in_b_3989780.html|title=Techniques and Tension in Breaking Bad|last=Demchick|first=Harrison|date=2013-09-26|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ends with one of the characters in a predicament (about to be caught by thugs, about to be exposed by the authority, or a family member or a friend finds out the main character's dirty secret).
|- valign="top"
| ''[[Deus ex machina]]'' (a machination, or act of god; lit. “god out of the machine”) || Resolving the primary conflict by a means unrelated to the story (e.g., a god appears and solves everything). This device dates back to [[Theatre of ancient Greece|ancient Greek theater]], but can be a clumsy method that frustrates the audience. ||The phrase originates from [[Medea (play)|Medea]], an ancient Greek drama. An example occurs in ''[[Mighty Aphrodite]]'' and the Tamil movie ''[[Inga Enna Solluthu]]''.
|- valign="top"
| [[Eucatastrophe]] || Coined by [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], a climactic event through which the protagonist appears to be facing a catastrophic change. However, this change does not materialize and the protagonist finds himself as the benefactor of such a climactic event; contrast [[peripety]]/''peripateia''. || At the end of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Gollum forcibly takes away the Ring from Frodo, suggesting that [[Sauron]] would eventually take over Middle Earth. However, Gollum celebrates too eagerly and clumsily falls into the lava, whereby the ring is destroyed and with it Sauron's power. In a way, Gollum does what Frodo and the Fellowship of the Ring intended to do through the whole plot of the trilogy, which was to throw the ring into the lake of fire in the heart of Mount Doom.
|- valign="top"
| [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]] (or analeptic reference) || General term for altering time sequences, taking characters back to the beginning of the tale, for instance || The story of "[[The Three Apples]]" in ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' tale begins with the discovery of a young woman's dead body. After the murderer later reveals himself, he narrates his reasons for the murder as a flashback of events leading up to the discovery of her dead body at the beginning of the story.
|- valign="top"
| [[Flashforward]] || Also called [[Flashforward|prolepsis]], a scene that temporarily jumps the narrative forward in time. Flashforwards often represent events expected, projected, or imagined to occur in the future. They may also reveal significant parts of the story that have not yet occurred, but soon will in greater detail. || Occurs in ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' when Mr. Scrooge visits the ghost of the future. It is also frequent in the later seasons of the television series [[Lost (TV series)|Lost]].
|- valign="top"
| [[Foreshadowing]] || Implicit yet intentional efforts of an author to suggest events which have yet to take place in the process of narration. See also [[repetitive designation]] and [[Chekhov's gun]] || A narration might begin with a male character who has to break up a schoolyard fight among some boys who are vying for the attention of a girl, which was introduced to foreshadow the events leading to a dinner time squabble between the character and his twin brother over a woman, whom both are courting at the same time.
|- valign="top"
| [[Frame story]], or a [[story within a story]] || A main story that hatches a linking series of shorter stories. || Early examples include ''[[Panchatantra]]'', ''[[Kalila and Dimna]]'', ''[[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', and ''[[The Decameron]]''. More modern examples are [[Brian Jacques]]’s 1999 ''[[The Legend of Luke]]'' and [[Ramsay Wood]]’s 2011 ''[[Kalila and Dimna]]'' update, subtitled ''Fables of Conflict and Intrigue''.
|- valign="top"
| [[Framing device]] || A single action, scene, event, setting, or any element of significance at the beginning and end of a work. The use of framing devices allows frame stories to exist. ||  In ''Arabian Nights'', Scheherazade, the newly wed wife to the King, is the framing device. As a character, she is telling the "1,001 stories" to the King, in order to delay her execution night by night. However, as a framing device her purpose for existing is to tell the same 1,001 stories to the reader.
|- valign="top"
| [[MacGuffin]] || A [[plot device]] coined by Alfred Hitchcock referring to some goal, desired object, or other motivator that the [[protagonist]] pursues, often with little or no narrative explanation as to why it is considered so important.||In Hitchcock’s The 39 Steps the MacGuffin is a mysterious set of “military secrets.” No one knows what they are, and in the end they mean almost nothing. For all its power, mystery, and danger, The One Ring in [[The Lord of the Rings|Lord of the Rings]] is a MacGuffin that saves the world. The stuff that dreams are made of. The [[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|Maltese Falcon]] is a powerful MacGuffin in the film of the same name, a supposedly jewel encrusted black bird which creates the greed which propels every character, even the hero. 
|- valign="top"
| ''[[In medias res]]'' || Beginning the story in the middle of a sequence of events. A specific form of narrative hook. || The ''Iliad'' and the ''Odyssey'' of Homer are prime examples. The latter work begins with the return of Odysseus to his home of Ithaka and then in flashbacks tells of his ten years of wandering following the Trojan War.
|- valign="top"
| [[Narrative hook]] || Story opening that "hooks" readers' attention so they will keep reading || Any non-fiction book is often introduced with an interesting factoid.
|- valign="top"
| [[Ochi]] || A sudden interruption of the wordplay flow indicating the end of a [[rakugo]] or a kobanashi. || A Rakugo is a Japanese verbal entertainment usually lasting 30 minutes which ends with a surprise punch line, a narrative stunt known as ochi (fall) or sage(lowering). Twelve kinds of ochi are codified and recognized. The earlier '''kobanashi was a sh'''ort comical vignette ending with an ochi.
|- valign="top"
| [[Plot twist]] || Unexpected change ("twist") in the direction or expected outcome of the plot. See also [[twist ending]]. || An early example is the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' tale "[[The Three Apples]]". A locked chest found by a fisherman contains a dead body, and two different men claim to be the murderer, which turns out to be the investigator's own slave.
|- valign="top"
| [[Poetic justice]] || Virtue ultimately rewarded, or vice punished, by an ironic twist of fate related to the character's own conduct || Wile E. Coyote coming up with a contraption to catch the Road Runner, only to be foiled and caught by his own devices. Each sin's punishment in [[Inferno (Dante)|Dante's ''Inferno'']] is a symbolic instance of poetic justice.
|- valign="top"
| [[Predestination paradox]] || Time travel paradox where a time traveler is caught in a loop of events that "predestines" them to travel back in time || In ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the main character repeatedly finds himself under the obligation of having to travel back in time because of something his future character has done.
|- valign="top"
| [[Quibble (plot device)|Quibble]] || Plot device based on an argument that an agreement's intended meaning holds no legal value, and that only the exact, literal words agreed on apply. || For example, William Shakespeare used a quibble in ''The Merchant of Venice'': Portia saves Antonio in a court of law by pointing out that the agreement called for a pound of flesh, but no blood, so Shylock can collect only if he sheds no blood.
|- valign="top"
| [[Red herring (idiom)|Red herring]] || Diverting attention away from an item of significance. || For example, in mystery fiction, an innocent party may be purposefully cast as highly suspicious through emphasis or descriptive techniques to divert attention from the true guilty party.
|- valign="top"
| [[Self-fulfilling prophecy]] || Prediction that, by being made, makes itself come true. || Early examples include the legend of [[Oedipus]], and the story of [[Krishna]] in the ''[[Mahabharata]]''. There is also an example of this in ''[[Harry Potter]]'' when Lord Voldemort heard a prophecy (made by Sybill Trelawney to Dumbledore) that a boy born at the end of July, whose parents had defied Voldemort thrice and survived, would be made marked as his equal. Because of this prophecy, Lord Voldemort sought out Harry Potter (believing him to be the boy spoken of) and tried to kill him. His parents died protecting him, and when Voldemort tried to cast a killing curse on Harry, it rebounded and took away most of his strength, and gave Harry Potter a unique ability and connection with the Dark Lord thus marking him as his equal.
|- valign="top"
| ''[[Story within a story]]'' (Hypodiegesis) || A story told within another story. See also [[frame story]]. || In Stephen King's ''The Wind Through the Keyhole'', of the Dark Tower series, the protagonist tells a story from his past to his companions, and in this story he tells another relatively unrelated story.
|- valign="top"
| [[Ticking clock scenario]] || Threat of impending disaster—often used in thrillers where salvation and escape are essential elements || In the TV show "24", the main character, Jack Bauer often finds himself interrogating a terrorist who is caught in order to disarm a bomb.
|- valign="top"
|- valign="top"
| [[Chekhov's gun]] || A dramatic principle that requires every element in a narrative to be irreplaceable, with anything else removed.|| "Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the first chapter that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third chapter it absolutely must go off. If it's not going to be fired, it shouldn't be hanging there." —  Anton Chekhov

| [[Unreliable narrator]] || The narrator of the story is not sincere, or introduces a bias in their narration and possibly misleads the reader, hiding or minimizing events, characters, or motivations. || An example is ''[[The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]]''. The novel includes an unexpected [[plot twist]] at the end of the novel. In the last chapter, Sheppard describes how he was an [[unreliable narrator]].

|- valign="top"
|  Audience surrogate || A character who expresses the questions and confusion of the audience, with whom the audience can identify. Frequently used in detective fiction and science fiction, where the character asks a central character how he or she accomplished certain deeds, for the purpose of inciting that character to explain (for the curious audience) his or her methods, or a character asking a relatively educated person to explain what amounts to the backstory. ||  Dr Watson in the Sherlock Holmes stories. [[Scott Evil]], played by Seth Green, son of Dr. Evil on the [[Austin Powers movies]].
|- valign="top"
| [[Author surrogate]] || Characters which are based on authors, usually to support their personal views. Sometimes an intentionally or unintentionally idealized version of them. A variation is the [[Mary Sue]] or Gary Stu, which primarily serves as an idealized self-insertion. || Socrates in the writings of Plato. Plato never speaks in his own voice in his dialogues. In the [[Second Letter (Plato)|''Second Letter'']], it says, "no writing of Plato exists or ever will exist, but those now said to be his are those of a Socrates become beautiful and new”.
|- valign="top"
| Breaking the [[fourth wall]] || An author or character addresses the audience directly (also known as [[direct address]]). This may acknowledge to the reader or audience that what is being presented is fiction, or may seek to extend the world of the story to provide the illusion that they are included in it. || The characters in ''[[Sesame Street]]'' often break the fourth wall when they address their viewers as part of the ongoing storyline, which is possible because of the high level of suspension of belief afforded by its audience—children. The American political drama show ''[[House of Cards (U.S. TV series)|House of Cards]]'' also uses this technique frequently to let the viewers know what the main character [[Frank Underwood (House of Cards)|Frank Underwood]] is thinking and planning.
|- valign="top"
| [[Defamiliarization]] ||  Taking an everyday object and presenting it in a way that is weirdly unfamiliar so that we see the object in a new way. Coined by the early 20th-century Russian literary critic Viktor Shklovsky in "Art as Technique." || In, Swift’s ''Gulliver's Travels'' when Gulliver visits the land of the giants and sees a giant woman’s skin he sees it is anything but smooth and beautiful when viewed up close.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.shmoop.com/literature-glossary/defamiliarization.html|title=Literature Glossary - Defamiliarization|website=www.shmoop.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|- valign="top"
| [[First-person narrative|First-person narration]] || A text presented from the point of view of a character, especially the protagonist, as if the character is telling the story themselves. (Breaking the fourth wall is an option, but not a necessity, of this format.) || [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' uses the title character as the narrator, while ''[[Sherlock Holmes]]'' is primarily told from Watson's perspective.
|- valign="top"
| [[Magical realism]] || Describing events in a real-world setting but with magical trappings, often incorporating local customs and invented beliefs. Different from [[urban fantasy]] in that the magic itself is not the focus of the story. || Particularly popular with [[Latin America]]n authors like [[Gabriel García Márquez]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]]. Elsewhere, Salman Rushdie's work provides good examples.
|- valign="top"
| [[Multiperspectivity]] || A narrative that is told from the [[Narration#Narrative point of view|viewpoint]]s of multiple characters that incorporate various perspectives, emotions, and views from witnesses or actors to varying particular events or circumstances that might not be felt by other characters in the story. ||  The films of [[Robert Altman]]. 2666 by [[Roberto Bolaño|Roberto Bolano]] features European literary critics, a Chilean philosophy professor, an African-American journalist, detectives investigating Santa Teresa murders and an obscure German writer named Benno Von Archimboldi. [[Pale Fire]] by Vladimir Nabokov features literature professor John Shade,  Charles Kinbote, a neighbor and colleague of Shade’s and Charles the Beloved, king of Zembla. Kinbote is the ultimate unreliable commentator.
|- valign="top"
| [[Narration#Second-person|Second-person narration]] || A text written in the style of a direct address, in the second-person. || ''[[Homestuck]]''.
|- valign="top"
| [[Stream of consciousness writing|Stream of consciousness]] || The author uses narrative and stylistic devices to create the sense of an unedited [[interior monologue]], characterized by leaps in syntax and punctuation that trace a character's fragmentary thoughts and sensory feelings. The outcome is a highly lucid perspective with a plot. Not to be confused with [[free writing]]. || An example is ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. At one point Leopold Bloom saunters through Dublin musing on “Pineapple rock, lemon platt, butter scotch. A sugar-sticky girl shovelling scoopful of creams for a Christian brother. Some school treat. Bad for their tummies.”
|- valign="top"
| [[Third-person narrative|Third-person narration]] || A text written as if by an impersonal narrator who is not affected by the events in the story. Can be omniscient or limited, the latter usually being tied to a specific character, a group of characters, or a location. || ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' is written in multiple limited third-person narrators that change with each chapter. ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' uses an omniscient narrator.

|- valign="top"
| [[Alliteration]] || Repeating the same letter or consonant sound at the beginning of adjacent or closely connected words. || In the film ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' the main character performs a couple of soliloquies with a heavy use of alliteration, e.g., "Voilà! In view, a humble vaudevillian veteran, cast vicariously as both victim and villain by the vicissitudes of Fate. This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi, now vacant, vanished, as the once vital voice of the verisimilitude now venerates what they once vilified. However, this valorous visitation of a bygone vexation stands vivified, and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition. The only verdict is vengeance; a vendetta held as a votive, not in vain, for the value and veracity of such shall one day vindicate the vigilant and the virtuous. Verily, this vichyssoise of verbiage veers most verbose vis-à-vis an introduction, and so it is my very good honor to meet you and you may call me V."
|- valign="top"
| [[Amplification (rhetoric)]] || Amplification refers to a literary practice wherein the writer embellishes the sentence by adding more information to it in order to increase its worth and understanding. || E.g., Original sentence: The thesis paper was difficult. After amplification: The thesis paper was difficult: it required extensive research, data collection, sample surveys, interviews and a lot of fieldwork.
|- valign="top"
| [[Anagram]] || Rearranging the letters of a word or a phrase to form a new phrase or word.|| E.g., An anagram for "debit card" is "bad credit". As you can see, both phrases use the same letters. By mixing the letters a bit of humor is created.
|- valign="top"
| [[Asyndeton]] || When sentences do not use conjunctions (e.g., and, or, nor) to separate clauses, but run clauses into one another, usually marking the separation of clauses with punctuation. || An example is when [[John F.

|- valign="top"
| [[Bathos]] || An abrupt transition in style from the exalted to the commonplace, producing a ludicrous effect.  While often unintended, bathos may be used deliberately to produce a humorous effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiske|first=Robert Hartwell|title=Robert Hartwell Fiske's Dictionary of Unendurable English: A Compendium of Mistakes in Grammar, Usage, and Spelling with commentary on lexicographers and linguists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZqfZfIvtlsC&amp;pg=PA71|date=1 November 2011 |publisher=Scribner|isbn=978-1-4516-5134-8|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abrams|first1=Meyer Howard|last2=Harpham|first2=Geoffrey Galt|title=A Glossary of Literary Terms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o9VkYJuVn9YC&amp;pg=PA24 |year=2009|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-1-4130-3390-8|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;||: The ballerina rose gracefully en pointe and extended one slender leg behind her, like a dog at a fire hydrant.

|- valign="top"
| [[Caesura]] || A break, especially a sense pause, usually near the middle of a verse, and marked in [[scansion]] by a double vertical line. This technique frequently occurs within a poetic line grammatically connected to the end of the previous line by [[enjambment]].|| E.g., in "Know then thyself. ‖ Presume not God to scan."
|- valign="top"
| [[Distancing effect]] || Deliberately preventing the audience from identifying with characters in order to let them be coolly scrutinized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Graham Allen|title=Roland Barthes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o4Sg_gx3soIC&amp;pg=PA29|date=2 June 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-134-50341-5|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;|| Popularized by 20th century playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]].
|- valign="top"
| Dramatic visualization || Representing an object or character with abundant descriptive detail, or mimetically rendering gestures and dialogue to make a scene more visual or imaginatively present to an audience. || This technique appears at least as far back as the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Heath| title=Reviewed work(s): ''Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights'' by David Pinault|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=26|issue=2|date=May 1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=358–360|doi=10.1017/s0020743800060633}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|- valign="top"
| [[Euphuism]] || An artificial, highly elaborate way of writing or speaking. Named from ''Euphues'' (1579) the prose romance by [[John Lyly]]. || "Is it not far better to abhor sins by the remembrance of others' faults, than by repentance of thine own follies?" (Euphues, 1, lecture by the wise Neapolitan)
|- valign="top"
| [[Hyperbole]] ||Exaggeration used to evoke strong feelings or create an impression which is not meant to be taken literally. || Sally could no longer hide her secret. Her pregnant belly was bigger than the planet on which she stood.
|- valign="top"
| [[Imagery]] ||Forming mental images of a scene using descriptive words, especially making use of the human senses. The same as ''sensory detail.'' || When the boots came off his feet with a leathery squeak, a smell of ferment and fish market immediately filled the small tent. The skin of his toes were red and raw and sensitive. The malodorous air was so toxic he thought he could almost taste his toes.
|- valign="top"
| [[Leitwortstil]] || Purposefully repeating words that usually express a motif or [[Theme (literature)|theme]] important to the story. || This dates back at least to the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]''.&lt;ref name=Heath-360&gt;Heath (1994) p. 360&lt;/ref&gt;
|- valign="top"
| [[Metonymy]] || Word or phrase in a figure of speech in which a noun is referenced by something closely associated with it, rather than explicitly by the noun itself. This is not to be confused with [[synecdoche]], in which a part of the whole stands for the thing itself. || Metonomy: The boxer threw in the towel. Synecdoche: She gave her hand in marriage.
|- valign="top"
| [[Overstatement]] || Exaggerating something, often for emphasis (also known as [[hyperbole]]) || Sally's pregnant belly most likely weighed as much as the scooter she used to ride before she got pregnant.
|- valign="top"
| [[Onomatopoeia]] || Words that imitate/spell a sound or noise.
Word that sounds the same as, or similar to what the word means.

Refer to comic books for the best examples.

| [[Oxymoron]] || A term made of two words that deliberately or coincidentally imply each other's opposite. || "terrible beauty"
|- valign="top"
| [[Paradox (literature)|Paradox]] || A phrase that describes an idea composed of concepts that conflict. || "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times." (''A Tale of Two Cities'')
|- valign="top"
| [[Parody]] || Ridicule by overstated imitation, usually humorous. || ''[[MAD Magazine]]''
|- valign="top"
| [[Pastiche]] ||Using forms and styles from another author, generally as an affectionate tribute. || Such as the many stories featuring [[Sherlock Holmes]] not written by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], or much of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]].
|- valign="top"
| [[Pathos]] || Emotional appeal, one of the three [[modes of persuasion]] in rhetoric that the author uses to inspire pity or sorrow towards a character—typically does not counterbalance the target character's suffering with a positive outcome, as in Tragedy. || In Romeo and Juliet, the two main characters each commit suicide at the sight of the supposedly dead lover, however the audience knows these actions to be rash and unnecessary. Therefore, Shakespeare makes for the emotional appeal for the unnecessary tragedy behind the young characters' rash interpretations about love and life.
|- valign="top"
| [[Polyptoton]] || Words derived from the same root in a sentence.|| "Not as a call to '''battle''', though '''embattled''' we are." [[John F. Kennedy]], ''Inaugural Address'', January 20, 1961.
|- valign="top"
| [[Polysyndeton]] || Polysyndeton is the use of several conjunctions in close succession, this provides a sense of exaggeration designed to wear down the audience. || An example of this is in the first chapter of [[Great Expectations]] by [[Charles Dickens]]: "A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin"
|- valign="top"
| [[Satire]] || The use of humor, irony or exaggeration to criticize. || An example is ''[[Network (1976 film)|Network]]''. One of the earliest examples is Gullivers Travels, written by Jonathan Swift. The television program [[South Park]] is another.
|- valign="top"
| [[Mental imagery|Sensory detail]] || sight, sound, taste, touch, smell. The same as ''imagery'' || The boot was tough and sinewy between his hard-biting teeth. There was no flavor to speak of except for the blandness of all the dirt that the boot had soaked up over the years. The only thing the boot reminded him of was the smell of a wet-dog.
|- valign="top"
| [[Understatement]] || A diminishing or softening of a theme or effect. || The broken ends of the long bone were sticking through the bleeding skin, but it wasn't something that always killed a man.

| [[Irony]] || This discrepancy between expectation and reality occurs in three forms: situational irony, where a situation features a discrepancy between what is expected and what is actualized; dramatic irony, where a character is unaware of pivotal information already revealed to the audience (the discrepancy here lies in the two levels of awareness between the character and the audience); and verbal irony, where one states one thing while meaning another. The difference between verbal irony and sarcasm is exquisitely subtle and often contested. The concept of irony is too often misunderstood in popular usage. Unfortunate circumstances and coincidences do not constitute irony (nor do they qualify as being ''tragic''). See the ''Usage controversy'' section under [[irony]], and the term [[tragedy]]. || A person hears a prophecy about himself. His endeavor to stop the prophecy from coming true, makes it come true.

'''Lucia Zarate''' (January 2, 1864 – January 15, 1890) was a Mexican entertainer with dwarfism who performed in sideshows. She was born in [[San Carlos Nuevo Guaymas]], which is now the town of Ursulo Galvan, Veracruz, and settled on the Agostadero, now [[Cempoala]], Veracruz, Mexico. Zarate is the first person to have been identified with [[Majewski osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II]].&lt;ref name=amj&gt;Hall, Judith G., Christina Flora, Charles I.

==Career==
At the age of twelve, Zarate moved from her native Mexico to the United States, where she was [[Freak show|exhibited]] for her small stature. An 1876 book published by [[Oxford University]] discussed a visit to Zarate paid by several medical professionals, who could not certainly verify that she was twelve, but could ascertain through her dental development that she was at least six.&lt;ref name="factbook"&gt;{{cite book | first = James | last = Mason | title = The history of the year 1876, containing 'The Year book of facts' and 'The Annual summary' | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6DoIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=%22Lucia+Zarate%22#PPA5,M1 | publisher = Oxford University | pages = 4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, her height was measured at 20 inches (51 centimeters) tall and her calf was measured as {{convert|4|in|mm}} in circumference, {{convert|1|in|mm}} more than the thumb of an average adult man.&lt;ref name="factbook"/&gt; She was with her parents at the time and found to be healthy and intelligent, able to speak some English along with her native Spanish.&lt;ref name="factbook"/&gt;

She first worked as part of an act billed as the "Fairy Sisters", later partnering with [[Francis Joseph Flynn]] (billed under the stage name "General Mite") to exhibit internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Matthew | last = Sweet | title = Inventing the Victorians | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=b-CJCzpR3QYC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=%22Lucia+Zarate%22&amp;as_brr=3#PPA149,M1 | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-312-28326-1 | pages = 149–150}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 she was billed in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as the "marvelous Mexican midget" and described as "a tiny but all powerful magnet to draw the public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Staff | title = Uffner's royal American midgets | work = The Washington Post | date = 1889-02-25 | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/191121282.html?dids=191121282:191121282&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=FEB+25%2C+1889&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc=Uffner%27s+Royal+American+Midgets.&amp;pqatl=google | accessdate = 2008-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her circus train became stranded in the snowy [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada mountains]], Zarate died of [[hypothermia]] in 1890.&lt;ref name=amj/&gt;&lt;ref name=Strand/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2999">'''Minibrix''' were construction kits manufactured from 1935 to 1976 in the [[UK]]. Developed in 1935, they enabled children to build their own miniature houses. Like the later and more famous construction toy, [[Lego]], Minibrix consisted primarily of interlocking bricks with moulded studs on the surface, but being invented before the availability of modern plastics they were made of hard rubber which had the necessary ability to deform under pressure to allow firm interlocking of studs and holes.

Minibrix were made by the Premo Rubber Company which traditionally made rubber shoe heels. Premo was a subsidiary of the I.T.S. Rubber Company, which had been founded in 1919 by Arnold Levy, and was located at Sandringham Road, Petersfield, Hampshire, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.sympatico.ca/richard.smallbone/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605041309/http://www3.sympatico.ca/richard.smallbone/history.html |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the Minibrix idea is unclear but Arnold may have seen the fibre-interlocking toy bricks of the early 1930s introduced by the Erector Company in America and the rubber interlocking bricks, called 'Bild-O-Brik' made in Pennsylvania, in 1934. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/database/?irn=108980 Minibrix] Powerhouse Museum&lt;/ref&gt; However, the actual design of the British bricks and the other elements of the Minibrix system are thought to have been the work of a Mr Gilbert, an ITS engineer, and patents for the product were applied for on 5 July 1935 in the names of the Premo Rubber Company and Arnold Levy.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110605041309/http://www3.sympatico.ca/richard.smallbone/history.html]

Two series of kits were available in different styles for making Tudor and Modern buildings, and the bases, roofs and lintels were all, like the bricks, made of rubber.

'''Public Domain Day''' is an observance of when [[copyright]]s expire and works enter into the [[public domain]].&lt;ref name="telcouk"/&gt; This legal transition of copyright works into the public domain usually happens every year on 1 January based on the individual [[list of countries' copyright length|copyright laws of each country]].&lt;ref name="telcouk"/&gt;

The observance of a "Public Domain Day" was initially informal; the earliest known mention was in 2004 by Wallace McLean (a Canadian public domain activist),&lt;ref name="american"/&gt; with support for the idea echoed by [[Lawrence Lessig]].&lt;ref name=lessig/&gt; Several websites list the authors whose works are entering the public domain each January 1. There are activities in countries around the world by various organizations all under the banner Public Domain Day.

==Public domain==
{{main|Public domain}}
[[File:Julia Reda at Public Domain Day Celebration 2016.jpg|thumb|A public domain photo from a public domain celebration in 2016 ([[Brussels]], [[Julia Reda]] speaking)]]
Copyright protection terms are typically described as the life of the author plus a certain number of years after his or her death (or ''pma: post mortem auctoris'').&lt;ref name=pdh2/&gt; In many jurisdictions, this usually means that 70 years have passed since the day of author's death.&lt;ref name="pdh2"/&gt; After that period, the works of those authors become fully available so that everyone - without any need for prior authorization - can access and use them for any purpose whatsoever.&lt;ref name=pdh2/&gt; Legally, this happens on [[New Year's Day]] (January 1).&lt;ref name="pdh"/&gt; That means that in those countries, the works of authors who died, anywhere in the world, in 1936, passed into public domain on 1 January 2007.

Since public domain rights vary based on jurisdiction, the passage of a work into the public domain is not worldwide.&lt;ref name="duke"/&gt; The most noticeable exception is the [[United States]], where no additional published works will enter the public domain automatically until 2019.&lt;ref name=duke/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nothing to celebrate on Public Domain Day 2010 in the US"/&gt; [[Australia]]{{'s}} copyright scheme is even more restrictive, with no Public Domain Day possible until 2026.&lt;ref name="Project Gutenberg Australia Newsletter February 2009"/&gt; Most of Europe will witness various works passing into the public domain, as will [[Canada]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=lessig/&gt;&lt;ref name=pdh2/&gt;&lt;ref name=duke/&gt; Many more works would be entering the public domain if not for the [[copyright extension]] that has occurred several times in the past several decades.&lt;ref name="What Could Have Been Entering the Public Domain on January 1, 2011?"/&gt;

Public Domain Day in 2010 celebrated the entry to the public domain in many countries of the works of authors such as [[Sigmund Freud]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Ford Madox Ford]] and [[Arthur Rackham]].&lt;ref name="telcouk"/&gt; In 2011 it celebrated the public domain status of [[Isaac Babel]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[John Buchan]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Selma Lagerlof]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Vito Volterra]], [[Nathanael West]], and others.&lt;ref name="publicdomainday"/&gt;

==Celebrations==
[[File:Domena publiczna 08 Polimerek 2.jpg|thumb|Public Domain Day celebration in Poland (2008)]]
It is not clear when Public Domain Day started to be observed (it was mentioned by [[Lawrence Lessig]] in 2004&lt;ref name="lessig"/&gt;) but in recent years it has been mentioned by [[Project Gutenberg]]&lt;ref name="January 1, 2011 is going to be Public Domain Day — Project Gutenberg News"/&gt; and has been promoted by [[Creative Commons]].&lt;ref name="Public Domain Day"/&gt; Public Domain Day events have been hosted on various dates in [[Poland]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]] and [[Israel]].&lt;ref name="carlos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haifa"/&gt;

In January 2011, to celebrate Public Domain Day 2011, Open Knowledge Foundation launched ''[[The Public Domain Review]]'', a web-based review of works which have entered the public domain.&lt;ref name="okfn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pdr"/&gt;

In January 2012, a celebration was announced in [[Warsaw, Poland]]&lt;ref name="jak-swietowalismy"/&gt; and for the first time in [[Krakow]]&lt;ref name="obchody-dnia"/&gt;), where for several years on that day various activities have been organized by [[Free culture movement|free culture]] NGOs (such as [[Koalicja Otwartej Edukacji]] and [[Open Society Institute]]) and other supporters.&lt;ref name="domenapubliczna"/&gt;&lt;ref name="domenapubliczna1"/&gt; Other 2012 events announced worldwide:&lt;ref name="P.D. Day 2012 Celebrations"/&gt;
* [[Switzerland]]: Public Domain Jam, [[Zurich]]
* [[Israel]]: PD Day Celebration at [[University of Haifa|Haifa University]], [[Haifa]]
* [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]: Events and promotional activities on the Public Domain
* [[Italy]]: 
** La giornata del Pubblico Dominio, [[Turin]]
** Festeggiamo il Giorno del Pubblico Dominio, [[Rome]]
** Celebriamo il Giorno del Pubblico Dominio e la Cultura Libera, [[Grosseto]]
* [[France]]: Journée du domaine public, [[Paris]]

In later years, Public Domain Day events have been organized by [[Communia]], which also maintained the (now defunct) publicdomainday.org website.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5359">In [[game theory]], the '''purification theorem''' was contributed by [[Nobel laureate]] [[John Harsanyi]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Harsanyi. 1973. "Games with randomly disturbed payoffs: a new rationale for mixed-strategy equilibrium points. ''Int. J. Game Theory'' 2 (1973), pp. 1–23. {{doi|10.1007/BF01737554}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theorem aims to justify a puzzling aspect of [[mixed strategy]] [[Nash equilibria]]: that each player is wholly indifferent amongst each of the actions he puts non-zero weight on, yet he mixes them so as to make every other player also indifferent.

The mixed strategy equilibria are explained as being the limit of [[pure strategy]] equilibria for a disturbed game of [[incomplete information]] in which the payoffs of each player are known to themselves but not their opponents. The idea is that the predicted mixed strategy of the original game emerge as ever improving approximations of a game that is not observed by the theorist who designed the original, [[Idealization (science philosophy)|idealized]] game.

The apparently mixed nature of the strategy is actually just the result of each player playing a pure strategy with threshold values that depend on the [[ex-ante]] distribution over the [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]] of payoffs that a player can have.  As that continuum shrinks to zero, the players strategies converge to the predicted Nash equilibria of the original, unperturbed, [[complete information]] game.

The result is also an important aspect of modern day inquiries in [[evolutionary game theory]] where the perturbed values are interpreted as distributions over types of players randomly paired in a population to play games.

Consider the [[Chicken (game)|Hawk–Dove game]] shown here. The game has two [[pure strategy]] equilibria (Defect, Cooperate) and (Cooperate, Defect). It also has a mixed equilibrium in which each player plays Cooperate with probability 2/3.

Suppose that each player ''i'' bears an extra cost ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' from playing Cooperate,  which is uniformly distributed on [−''A'',&amp;nbsp;''A'']. Players only know their own value of this cost. So this is a game of [[incomplete information]] which we can solve using [[Bayesian Nash equilibrium]]. The probability that ''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤
{{nowrap|''a*'' is (''a*'' + ''A'')/2''A''}}. If player 2 Cooperates when {{nowrap|''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ ''a*''}}, then player 1's expected utility from Cooperating is {{nowrap|−''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 3(''a*'' + ''A'')/2''A'' + 2(1 − (''a*'' + ''A'')/2''A'')}}; his expected utility from Defecting is {{nowrap|4(''a*'' + ''A'')/2''A''}}. He should therefore himself Cooperate when {{nowrap|''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ 2 - 3(''a*''+''A'')/2''A''}}. Seeking a symmetric equilibrium where both players cooperate if {{nowrap|''a&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ ''a*''}}, we solve this for 
{{nowrap|''a*'' {{=}} 1/(2 + 3/''A''}}).
Now we have worked out ''a*'', we can calculate the probability of each player playing Cooperate as

:&lt;math&gt;\Pr(a_i \le a^*) = \frac{\frac{1}{2+3/A}+A}{2A} = \frac{A}{4A^{2}+6A}+\frac{1}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

As ''A'' → 0, this approaches 2/3 – the same probability as in the mixed strategy in the complete information game.

Thus, we can think of the mixed strategy equilibrium as the outcome of pure strategies followed by players who have a small amount of private information about their payoffs.

==Technical details==

Harsanyi's proof involves the strong assumption that the perturbations for each player are independent of the other players.  However, further refinements to make the theorem more general have been attempted.&lt;ref&gt;R. Aumann, et al. 1983. "Approximate Purificaton of Mixed Strategies. ''Mathematics of Operations Research'' 8 (1983), pp. 327–341.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Govindan, S., Reny, P.J. and Robson, A.J. 2003. "A Short Proof of Harsanyi's Purification Theorem. ''Games and Economic Behavior'' v45,n2 (2003), pp. 369–374. {{doi|10.1016/S0899-8256(03)00149-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main result of the theorem is that all the mixed strategy equilibria of a given game can be purified using the same sequence of perturbed games. However, in addition to independence of the perturbations, it relies on the set of payoffs for this sequence of games being of full measure.  There are games, of a pathological nature, for which this condition fails to hold.

The main problem with these games falls into one of two categories: (1) various mixed strategies of the game are purified by different sequences of perturbed games and (2) some mixed strategies of the game involve weakly dominated strategies.  No mixed strategy involving a weakly dominated strategy can be purified using this method because if there is ever any non-negative probability that the opponent will play a strategy for which the weakly dominated strategy is not a best response, then one will never wish to play the weakly dominated strategy.  Hence, the limit fails to hold because it involves a discontinuity.&lt;ref&gt;Fudenberg, Drew and Jean Tirole: ''Game Theory'', MIT Press, 1991, pp. 233–234&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rape}}
'''Rape and revenge films''' are a subgenre of [[exploitation film]] that was particularly popular in the 1970s. 

==Explanation of the subgenre==
Rape and revenge films generally follow the same [[three-act structure]]:{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

* Act I: A usually female character is (violently) raped and maybe further abused, [[torture]]d or left for dead.
* Act II: The character survives and/or [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|rehabilitates]] themselves.
* Act III: The character exacts [[revenge]] and/or kills their rapist(s).

In some cases, the character is incapacitated or killed at the end of the first act, and the "revenge" is carried out by their family, as in ''[[The Virgin Spring]]'', ''[[I Saw the Devil]]'', ''[[Nocturnal Animals]]'',  the original ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'', ''[[The House of the Spirits (film)|The House of the Spirits]]'', and ''[[Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri]]''.

In [[Gaspar Noé]]'s 2002 film ''[[Irréversible]]'', the structure was reversed, with the first act depicting the revenge before tracing back the events which led to that point. [[Roger Ebert]] argues that, by using this structure as well as a false revenge, ''Irréversible'' cannot be classified as an exploitation film, as no exploitation of the subject matter takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|title=Irreversible::rogerebert.com::Reviews| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20030314/REVIEWS/303140303/1023 | publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |accessdate=2010-01-25|date=2003-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre has attracted critical attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clover|first= Carol J.|year=1992| title=[[Men, Women, and Chainsaws]]: Gender in the Modern Horror Film|location=Princeton, NJ|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-00620-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Creed|first=B.|date=1993|title=The Monstrous-Feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis|location=New York, NY|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-05259-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King|first=Claire Sisco|date=2003|title=Review of "Thelma &amp; Louise" by Marita Sturken and of "The New Avengers: Feminism, Femininity, and the Rape-Revenge Cycle" by Jacinda Read|url=http://www.scope.nottingham.ac.uk/bookreview.php?issue=aug2003&amp;id=437&amp;section=book_rev|accessdate=October 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Read|first=Jacinda|date=2000|title=The New Avengers: Feminism, Femininity, and the Rape-Revenge Cycle|location=Manchester, UK and New York|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0-7190-5905-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this critical attention comes from feminist critics examining the complex politics involved in the genre and its impact on cinema more generally. More recently, a broad analysis of the rape-revenge genre and concept was published in ''Rape-Revenge Films: A Critical Study'', by Alexandra Heller-Nicholas. The book argues against a simplistic notion of the term 'rape-revenge' and suggests a film-specific approach in order to avoid generalizing films which may "diverge not over the treatment of sexual assault as much as they do in regard to the morality of the revenge act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heller-Nicholas|first=Alexandr|title=Rape-Revenge Film: A Critical Study|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7864-4961-3|pages=230|url=http://www.rape-revenge.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319065018/http://rape-revenge.com/|archivedate=2013-03-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to American and French films, rape/revenge films have been made in Japan (e.g., [[Takashi Ishii (film director)|Takashi Ishii]]'s ''[[Freeze Me]]''), Finland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Makela |first=Anna |title=Political rape, private revenge.

The '''Robert Award for Best Visual Effects''' ({{lang-da|Robert Prisen for årets visuelle effekter}}) is one of the merit awards presented by the [[Danish Film Academy]] at the annual [[Robert Awards]] ceremony. The award has been handed out since 1984, although numerous years in the 1980s and 1990s saw no honorees. Between 1984 and 2013 the award was given as the '''Robert Award for Best Special Effects''' (''Robert Prisen for årets special effects''), and since 2014 as the '''Robert Award for Best Visual Effects''' (''Robert Prisen for årets visuelle effekter'').&lt;ref name="SundholmThorsen2012" /&gt;

==Plot==
{{More plot|date=August 2014}}
Sometime after the events of the first film, Lorena Christmas discovers an egg sac containing a baby sharktopus in the ocean. Meanwhile, Dr. Rico Symes, CEO of Symodyne, the company that originally created sharktopus releases a barracuda-pterodactyl hybrid creature known as pteracuda above the desert, intended for military use, against the advice of head of security Hamilton. The pteracuda, controlled with a computer chip in its brain, is secretly hacked by one of the scientists at Symodyne, Vladimir Futon to terrorize populated areas. The pteracuda is directed towards the Symodyne lab, and kills a worker before Hamilton scares it off. Futon flees the scene, and continues to control the pteracuda from his car.

Hamilton, and his team of military commandos engage in battle with the pteracuda in a helicopter, and Symes discovers that pteracuda's computer chip has been hacked, reporting this information to Hamilton. The pteracuda then causes the helicopter to crash in the ocean, killing everybody except Hamilton. Futon then loses the signal after crashing his car, leaving pteracuda on his own command. Meanwhile, Lorena, is working at a water park/aquarium owned by her uncle, greedy business mogul Munoz, and is currently training the now fully grown sharktopus. After two customers threaten to give Munoz a one star review, he shows them the sharktopus, only for the couple to almost get killed by the creature. The sharktopus makes news headlines as Symes realizes that the original sharktopus had babies.

Symes, and Hamilton force Munoz to give sharktopus to them so they can use it to kill pteracuda, much to Lorena's anger. Symes, and Hamilton proceed to release sharktopus into the ocean so it can fight pteracuda. Sharktopus, and pteracuda kill a few people at diving at a shipwreck before they begin to fight. Meanwhile, Munoz locks Lorena in a closet to keep her quiet, although she manages to break out, and calls her lifeguard boyfriend Rick Hoffman, telling him to evacuate the beach. However, the sharktopus, and pteracuda arrive, and kill a few people, including [[Conan O'Brien]]. In the meantime, Symes, and Hamilton discover that Futon hacked into pteracuda's system. At a nearby hotel, Futon regains control of pteracuda. The pteracuda crashes a plane, and kills everybody on board, including the couple that Smith showed the sharktopus to earlier.

Having been paid a ton of money by Symes, and Hamilton to keep quiet about sharktopus, Munoz closes the park for good. The sharktopus, and pteracuda kill several more people at the beach before continuing their fight. Symes, and Hamilton kidnap Lorena to force her to help them kill the creatures. Lorena realizes that she read one of Symes' papers back in college. Lorena then escapes Symes, and Hamilton after seeing Rick pull in an injured woman on the beach. Pteracuda attacks more people on the beach, and Rick goes on a jetski to warn people, only to be decapitated by pteracuda. Symes, and Hamilton kidnap Lorena again, and the three trace sharktopus' location to a series of nearby canals that are near the aquarium.

Symes discovers that Futon is attempting to cause a meltdown at a nearby nuclear power plant using pteracuda. He, Lorena, and Hamilton then attempt to drive to the hotel to stop Futon. At the aquarium, sharktopus arrives, and kills several people, including Munoz. Lorena, Symes, and Hamilton arrive at the hotel, and take Futon hostage, and find out he's working for a foreign terrorist group. It is revealed on a news report that only Symes is wanted by the government for questioning. Futon takes control of Symes' gun, and leaves with his computer, although he is shot by Hamilton in his escape, and the group leaves him to be eaten by pteracuda while Symes stops the pteracuda's coded course to the power plant.

When the group attempts to drive away, they are attacked by pteracuda, and Symes forces Lorena, and Hamilton out of the car with the computer, leaving them for dead. Lorena, and Hamilton manage to evade pteracuda, as it, and the sharktopus begin to fight again. Hamilton then drives off in another car with the computer, intending to kill the creatures himself, and Lorena returns home. The next day, Hamilton confronts Symes, holding him at gunpoint, and forcing him onto a rowboat with the computer. Symes is ripped in half by sharktopus, and pteracuda while Hamilton returns to help Lorena.

Lorena realizes that the pteracuda must eat constantly in order to survive, and she, and Hamilton create a plan to kill both creatures. Using a disco ball to lure in pteracuda, sharktopus also arrives subsequently, and the two creatures begin to fight once more. Hamilton shoots the pteracuda with a harpoon that breaches its computer chip, causing it to overload, and explode, killing both creatures. As Lorena, and Hamilton leave, the sharktopus grabs onto their boat, and lunges at the camera, leaving their fates unknown.

'''Solar Sports''' is a [[Philippines|Filipino]] 24-hour cable TV sports channel that is owned by the [[Solar Entertainment Corporation]], and based in [[Shaw Boulevard]], [[Mandaluyong|Mandaluyong City]], [[Metro Manila]], [[Philippines]]. The channel was launched on January 1, 1994 and is available for [[Cablelink]] and contract for local cable operators and via livestreaming.

==History==
The channel is known for showing sports that are familiar to the Filipinos. Its main programming are the NBA games, which are shown either a game or a doubleheader each day during the season. Other NBA programming includes shows produced by [[NBA TV]], such as the NBA's Greatest Games and [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]] games during the league's off-season. It also shows the American [[Super Bowl]]. It is also the Filipino provider of the [[Olympic Games]].

It also shows boxing matches such as the ones from the promotions of [[Bob Arum]], [[Don King (boxing promoter)|Don King]] and most recently, [[Oscar de la Hoya]]'s Golden Boy Promotions. From 2002-2006, Solar Sports would cover the fights of [[Manny Pacquiao]], until Pacquiao signed with [[ABS-CBN]] for the rights to cover his fights. However, Solar Sports regained the broadcast rights for Pacquiao's fights since 2007 when the channel signed a deal with GMA Network.

Other sports include [[Volleyball]] and [[Badminton]], such as the JVC Badminton tournament and the first-ever Manny V. Pangilinan Badminton Tournament, pitting players from Asia and Europe, in 2005.

The network also launched ''[[Sports Desk (2004 TV series)|Solar Sports Desk]]'', a late-evening sports news program, similar to those  famed American sports programs such as ''[[SportsCenter]]''. On October 2006, Solar Sports re-launch its channel, adding local shows.

The channel is available exclusively in Metro Manila through Global Destiny Cable as of 2008. It used to be available exclusively on Sky Cable, but the two parties ceased their partnership at end of 2007 but it will be back on July 1. All cable companies in the provinces can put the channel without having to worry about exclusive rights.

On April 10, 2017 [[Sky Cable]] &amp; [[Destiny Cable]] dropped Solar Sports along with sister channels [[Basketball TV]], [[CT (TV channel)|CT]], [[Jack TV]] &amp; [[NBA Premium TV]] allegedly due to Sky Cable's unpaid carriage fees.

'''''Sophie''''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[television sitcom]] that aired on [[CBC Television|CBC]] from January 9, 2008 to March 23, 2009.

It stars [[Natalie Brown (actress)|Natalie Brown]] as Sophie Parker, an unmarried single mother and talent agent. The show is an [[Canadian English|English-language]] [[adaptation]] of [[Télévision de Radio-Canada]]'s show ''[[Les Hauts et les bas de Sophie Paquin]]''.

The show was created by [[Richard Blaimert]] and its [[executive producer]] is Jocelyn Deschênes, the same creative team behind the original series. It was the CBC's second attempt in as many years to create an English adaptation of a successful series from its French sister network, following the less successful ''[[Rumours (TV series)|Rumours]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicairwaves.ca/index.php?page=1967&amp;PHPSESSID=94e09c9. Our Public Airwaves.ca - CBC TV tries again to adapt French comedy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, it was announced that the show had been bought by [[ABC Family]], part of [[Disney-ABC Television Group]] in the [[United States]]. The network signed on for the first 13 episodes, as well as an option for the second season of the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2008/02/05/sophie-abc.html ABC Family buys CBC comedy Sophie] CBC News, February 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2009, the series was cancelled by CBC due to poor ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jam.canoe.ca/Television/2009/03/27/8911736-cp.html 'Sophie' was canceled due to low ratings] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20090329045858/http://www.jam.canoe.ca/Television/2009/03/27/8911736-cp.html |date=March 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
* '''Sophie Parker''' ([[Natalie Brown (actress)|Natalie Brown]]) is a businesswoman and single mother who runs her own talent agency. Just hours after being told by a psychic that she was about to have the worst year of her life, her boyfriend Rick ran off with her best friend Melissa while Sophie was still pregnant with what she and Rick thought was Rick's baby. Soon afterward, she gave birth and discovered that the baby (named Robert) couldn't be Rick's child after all: he's half [[Black people|black]]. It turns out Robbie was conceived in a one-night stand Sophie had with André (played by [[Lyriq Bent]] in flashbacks), whom she met in a cab in [[New York City]]. At first, she did not have any contact with him and went as far as shredding his business card. But in the first season finale, he would later show up to see her, and upon learning that he was a father, he walked out on Sophie and left her devastated, only to return hours later to see Sophie with her ex-boyfriend Rick at her apartment.
* '''Rick Ryder''' ([[Sebastian Spence]]) is Sophie's ex-boyfriend and former business partner who now runs his own competing talent agency which stole most of Sophie's clients. Despite the end of their relationship, however, they can't seem to get away from each other, in part because Sophie's mother is constantly plotting to reunite them. His continued presence in Sophie's life also complicates her efforts to find a new boyfriend: in one episode, he accidentally sees Melissa giving Sophie's current love interest a few pointers on how Sophie likes to be flirted with, mistakes him for someone ''Melissa'' is seeing behind his back, and later punches him in the face at a gallery show. In the first season finale, he almost asked Melissa to marry him, but when that failed he saw Sophie crying over being rejected by André and as they were about to go get a drink, he sees André walking towards the two.
* '''Melissa Bryant''' ([[Amy Lalonde]]) is Sophie's former best friend and Rick's current girlfriend. A bit ditzy, she still thinks of Sophie as a dear friend&amp;nbsp;— even helping her to line up dates and begging her to dogsit&amp;nbsp;— and is unaware of how much she hurt Sophie by stealing Rick. She dotes on her dog like a baby, sometimes giving it more attention and TLC than she gives Rick. In the first season finale, Rick tried to ask Melissa to marry him, only to have the two argue, resulting in Rick leaving and Melissa furious.
* '''Matt Scott''' ([[Jeff Geddis]]) is Sophie's [[gay]] best friend and confidant. Although in a relationship with Verner, a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] immigrant, he is not entirely committed to it and also has an eye for Bernard, a waiter at the café where he and Sophie hang out, and eventually slept with. In the end, he did confess to Verner and eventually made up by going off to [[Switzerland]] together.
* '''Judith Parker''' ([[Mimi Kuzyk]]) is Sophie's [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] [[control freak]] mother. She is determined to reunite Sophie and Rick, faking a [[suicide]] attempt so that she can insist that they take care of her together and deliberately interfering when Sophie dates anyone who isn't Rick.
* '''Estelle Burroughs''' ([[Sara Botsford]]) is a pretentious and flighty actress who affects a [[Received Pronunciation]] English accent, and the only client of Sophie's agency who didn't defect to Rick's new firm (although Sophie wouldn't be upset if she did). She was also the mistress of Sophie's late father for many years (as Sophie tells Judith about why she was signed to the agency, "She came with the deal. He put it in the will."), complicating her professional relationship with Sophie, but at times comes through for her. In one episode, Estelle played a part in getting Sophie a sought-after client after she recognized Estelle from in a play called ''Learning Rainbows'' and was a fan of Estelle. She thinks of herself as a positive force in Sophie's life, which makes one of them.
* '''Ophelia Burroughs''' (Chantelle Chung) is Estelle's teenage daughter, whom Estelle adopted from [[China]]. Ophelia has no love for Estelle whatsoever.
* '''Bridget''' (Catherine Bérubé) is Sophie's scheming receptionist, constantly trying to angle her way into a more senior job with the agency.
* '''Christian Parker''' ([[Tyler Hynes]]) is Sophie's younger brother. Recently paroled from prison, he is determined to exploit his family connections to launch his own [[reality show]] depicting his experience as an ex-con readjusting to life "on the outside".

On February 5, 2008, it was announced that [[United States|American]] broadcast rights to ''Sophie'' were purchased by [[ABC Family]], which aired the series in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20080501abcfamily01 From The Futon Critic (May 2 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; ABC Family marketed the series as "original programming", although earlier seasons had already aired in Canada. The show was pulled from the lineup early in its run due to poor ratings.

'''South by Southwest''' (abbreviated as '''SXSW''' and colloquially referred to as '''South By''')  is an annual conglomerate of film, [[interactive media]], and [[music festival]]s and [[Convention (meeting)|conferences]] that take place in mid-March in [[Austin, Texas]], [[United States]]. It began in 1987, and has continued to grow in both scope and size every year. In 2017, the conference lasted for 10 days with SXSW interactive lasting for five days, music for seven days and film running concurrently for nine days. Comedy and gaming components to the festival are particularly fast-growing.

SXSW is run by the company SXSW, LLC which organizes conferences, trade shows, festivals, and other events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sxswedu.com/about/history |title=Sxsw Inc |publisher=Sxswedu.com |date= |accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the three main South by Southwest festivals, the company runs other conferences: SXSW EDU, a conference on educational innovation, held in Austin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sxswedu.com/about |title=About SXSW EDU |publisher=Sxswedu.com |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (beginning in 2017) the me Convention, held in [[Frankfurt]], Germany, in collaboration with [[Mercedes-Benz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/South-by-Southwest-SXSW-to-collaborate-with-Mercedes-Benz-at-IAA-International-Motor-Show-in-Frankfurt-Premiere-at-IAA-International-me-Convention.xhtml?oid=16074145|title=South by Southwest (SXSW) to collaborate with Mercedes-Benz at IAA International Motor Show in Frankfurt: Premiere at IAA: International me Convention|last=Schultz|first=Ina|date=March 11, 2017|website=media.daimler.com|language=en-EN|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sxsw.com/news/2017/sxsw-joins-mercedes-benz-host-future-focused-convention-frankfurt/|title=SXSW and Mercedes-Benz Announce Initial Programming for Collaborative Future-Focused Event in Europe|last=Roberts|first=Jordan|date=2017-06-14|work=SXSW|access-date=2017-08-23|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former conferences run by the SXSW organization were SXSW Eco, an environmental conference held in Austin from 2011 to 2016;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sxsweco.com/about |title=About SXSW Eco |publisher=Sxsweco.com |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one in Las Vegas: [[SXSW V2V]], a conference focused on innovative [[startup company|startups]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/technology/sxsw-interactive-expanding-next-year-with-las-vega/nSmFZ/ |title= SXSW Interactive expanding next year with Las Vegas startup conference|last=Gallaga|first=Omar L.|publisher=Austin American-Statesman |date=October 23, 2012 |accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ran from 2013 to 2015.

=== Music ===
SXSW Music is the largest [[music festival]] of its kind in the world, with more than 2,000 acts as of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = SXSW 2015: The festival changes, but for the better?|url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-sxsw-music-wrap-20150323-story.html|website = latimes.com|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; SXSW Music offers artist-provided music and video samples of featured artists at each festival via their official YouTube channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Birney |first=Adrienne |authorlink= |title=SXSW Technical Coordinator |work= |publisher= |date= |url=http://sxsw.com/ |doi= |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.sxsw.com/|title=The Official SXSW site|publisher=Sites.sxsw.com|accessdate=2015-08-13}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music event has grown from 700 registrants in 1987 to over 28,000 registrants. SXSW Film and SXSW Interactive events have grown every year, most recently bringing over 51,000 registrants to Austin every March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sxsw.com/about/history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813151035/http://sxsw.com/about/history |archivedate=2011-08-13 |title=About SXSW |accessdate=March 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bands must cover their own expenses for travel and lodging at the event. All performers are offered a cash payment or a wristband package that allows access to all music events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/zackomalleygreenburg/2013/03/18/why-most-acts-dont-get-paid-at-south-by-southwest/ |title=Why Most Acts Don't Get Paid At South By Southwest |publisher=Forbes |date=March 18, 2013 |accessdate=March 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===
SXSW Film Conference spans five days of conference panels and sessions, and welcomes filmmakers of all levels. Programming consists of keynote speakers, panels, workshops, mentor sessions and more, with expert filmmakers and industry leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sxsw.com/film/history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404164219/http://sxsw.com/film/history |archivedate=2015-04-04 |title= History |work= |publisher= SXSW.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the SXSW Film Conference programmed over 250 sessions with 735 speakers. Past notable speakers include [[Jon Favreau]], [[Mark Duplass]], [[Ava DuVernay]], [[Ryan Gosling]], [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]], [[Tilda Swinton]], [[Amy Schumer]], [[Sally Field]], [[Joss Whedon]], [[Christine Vachon]], [[RZA]], [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Danny Boyle]], [[Seth MacFarlane]], [[Catherine Hardwicke]], [[Richard Linklater]], [[David Gordon Green]], [[Harmony Korine]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Sarah Green (film producer)|Sarah Green]] and [[Robert Rodriguez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sxsw.com/film/conference/past-speakers |title=SXSW LLC. |publisher=sxsw.com |date= |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the film festival often highlights independently produced films and emerging directing talent with unique visions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Peters |first=Yves |title=''Man &amp; Gun'' and ''Les Bleus de Ramville'' Win SXSW Film Design Awards|url=http://fontfeed.com/archives/man-film-design-awards/ |publisher=The Font Feed |accessdate=January 11, 2013 |date=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the festival has long served studios as a starting point for their comedies, using enthusiastic fans as a barometer of how they might play in wide release.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite news |last=Murphy |first=Mekado |title=SXSW 2015: Films That Were the Talk of the Festival |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/19/sxsw-2015-films-that-were-the-talk-of-the-festival/  |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=July 11, 2015 |date=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SXSW Film Festival runs nine days, simultaneously with the SXSW Film Conference, and celebrates raw innovation and emerging talent both behind and in front of the camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sxsw.com/film/about |title=SXSW LLC. |publisher=sxsw.com |date= |accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Festival programming categories include: Special Events, Headliners, Narrative Spotlight, Documentary Spotlight, Narrative Competition, Documentary Competition, Visions, Midnighters, 24 Beats Per Second, SXGlobal, Episodic, Festival Favorites and Short Film Programs. The SXSW Film Awards, which occur on the last day of the Film Conference, honor films selected by the Feature and Short Film Juries.

In 2015, the SXSW Film Festival programmed 150 feature films and 106 short films, selected from 7,361 submissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sxsw.com/sites/default/files/attachments/SXSW-FILM-FESTIVAL-ANNOUNCES-2015%20COMPLETE-CONFERENCE-LINEUP-AND-ADDITIONAL-FESTIVAL-TITLES-IMMEDIATE.pdf |title=SXSW LLC. |publisher=sxsw.com |date= |accessdate=July 14, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924112924/http://www.sxsw.com/sites/default/files/attachments/SXSW-FILM-FESTIVAL-ANNOUNCES-2015%20COMPLETE-CONFERENCE-LINEUP-AND-ADDITIONAL-FESTIVAL-TITLES-IMMEDIATE.pdf |archivedate=September 24, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Past notable world premieres include ''[[Furious 7]]'', ''[[Neighbors (2014 film)|Neighbors]]'', ''[[Chef (2014 film)|Chef]]'', ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'', ''[[The Cabin in the Woods]]'', ''[[Bridesmaids (2011 film)|Bridesmaids]]'' and ''[[Insidious (film)|Insidious]]'', and the TV series ''[[Girls (TV series)|Girls]]'', ''[[Silicon Valley (TV series)|Silicon Valley]]'' and ''[[Penny Dreadful (TV series)|Penny Dreadful]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sxsw.com/film/screenings/past-films |title=Past Films at SXSW &amp;#124; South by Southwest 2016 Music, Film and Interactive Festivals – Austin Texas |publisher=Sxsw.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609232442/http://www.sxsw.com/film/screenings/past-films |archivedate=2015-06-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interactive ===
SXSW Interactive is focused on emerging technology, a focus which has earned the festival a reputation as a breeding ground for new ideas and creative technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sxsw.com/interactive/about |title=Interactive News &amp;#124; SXSW 2013 |publisher=Sxsw.com |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival includes a trade show, speakers, parties, and a startup accelerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sxsw.com/interactive/accelerator |title=March 8–9: SXSW Accelerator Presented by Oracle Helps Uncover Amazing New Startups &amp;#124; SXSW 2014 |publisher=Sxsw.com |date=November 10, 2013 |accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a festival organizer [[Louis Black]], SXSW Interactive "has probably been the biggest of its kind in the world" since 2007.&lt;ref name="sxsw stays course"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110311034107/http://www.dailytexanonline.com/content/sxsw-stays-course-continues-growth SXSW stays course, continues growth], Alex Geiser, ''[[The Daily Texan]]'', March 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Inauguration – 1980s===
In July 1986, the organizers of the [[New York City]] music festival [[New Music Seminar]] contacted Roland Swenson, a staffer at the [[alternative weekly]] ''[[The Austin Chronicle]]'', about organizing an extension of that festival into Austin after having announced that they were going to hold a "New Music Seminar Southwest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=van Arts Labor |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH02tbDy_6M&amp;t=1m19s&amp;list=UUgk1rvr62MBcRrTBgI4oEUg |title=SXSW documentary 'Outside Industry' |publisher=Youtube.com |date=February 28, 2014 |accessdate=March 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans did not materialize, so Swenson decided to instead co-organize a local music festival, with the help of two other people at the ''Chronicle'':  editor and co-founder Louis Black, and publisher Nick Barbaro. Louis Meyers, a [[booking agent]] and musician, was also brought on board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utcah/01476/cah-01476.html A Guide to the South By Southwest, Inc., Records, 1987–1997], Briscoe Center for American History, The University of Texas at Austin&lt;/ref&gt; Black came up with the name, as a play on the name of the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[North by Northwest]]''. The event was first held in March 1987. The organizers considered it a regional event and expected around 150 attendees to show up, but over 700 came, and according to Black "it was national almost immediately."&lt;ref name="sxsw stays course" /&gt;

Meyers left Austin and the festival in the early 1990s, but Black, Barbaro and Swenson remained the festival's key organizers as of 2010.&lt;ref name="sxsw stays course" /&gt;

===1990s===
Singer-songwriter [[Michelle Shocked]] was the keynote speaker at the 1992 South by Southwest. She caused controversy by delivering a speech, written by her then-husband [[Bart Bull]], criticizing white musicians for stealing music from [[African American]] artists; and then later during the same conference when she tried to kick the band [[Two Nice Girls]] off of a benefit concert, a move that some called anti-gay, due to Two Nice Girls' overtly [[lesbian]] image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasobserver.com/1996-04-25/music/the-education-of-michelle-shocked/ The Education of Michelle Shocked], Robert Wilonsky, ''[[Dallas Observer]]'', April 25, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, SXSW moved into the [[Austin Convention Center]], where it is still held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sxsw.com/node/5521] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322004257/http://sxsw.com/node/5521|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, SXSW added a component for film and other media, named the "SXSW Film and Multimedia Conference".&lt;ref name="sxsw stays course" /&gt; [[Johnny Cash]] was the keynote speaker.&lt;ref name=Cohen2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Jason|title=SXSW: The Ten Best Music Keynote Speakers|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/sxsw-ten-best-music-keynote-speakers|accessdate=13 June 2014|work=[[Texas Monthly]]|publisher=Emmis Publishing, L.P.|date=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, the three brothers of the band [[Hanson (band)|Hanson]] were brought to SXSW by their father in order to perform impromptu auditions for music executives, in the hopes of getting industry attention. Among the people who heard them was A&amp;R executive [[Christopher Sabec]], who became their manager, and would soon afterward get them signed to [[Mercury Records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oklahomatoday.com/Site/pdf/1997Hanson.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104185941/http://www.oklahomatoday.com/Site/pdf/1997Hanson.pdf |archivedate=2010-11-04 |title= 1997 Oklahoman of the Year |work= |publisher= Oklahoma Today |date= |accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the SXSW Film and Multimedia Conference was split into two separate events, "SXSW Film" and "SXSW Multimedia".&lt;ref name="sxsw stays course" /&gt;

In 1999, SXSW Multimedia was renamed "SXSW Interactive".&lt;ref name="sxsw stays course" /&gt;

===2000s===
Singer-songwriter [[John Mayer]]'s performance at the 2000 SXSW Music festival led to his signing soon thereafter with [[Aware Records]], his first [[record label]].

A performance by the band [[The Polyphonic Spree]] at the 2002 SXSW Music festival helped bring them to national attention before they had signed with a major label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1471511/20030424/polyphonic_spree.jhtml|title=Polyphonic Spree: From Voices In A Singer's Head To Voices On The Stage - News - VH1.com|date=19 October 2011|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019215642/http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1471511/20030424/polyphonic_spree.jhtml|archivedate=19 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2002 SXSW Film Festival, the film ''[[Manito (film)|Manito]]'' won the jury award for narrative feature, while the documentary ''[[Spellbound (2002 film)|Spellbound]]'' won the jury award for documentary feature.

British singer [[James Blunt]] was discovered by producer [[Linda Perry]] while playing a small show at the 2004 SXSW Music festival, and was signed to Perry's [[Custard Records]] soon thereafter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller |first=Nancy |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1174154,00.html |title=Five rounds with James Blunt |publisher=EW.com |date=2006-03-17 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he would go on to release all three of his subsequent albums.

The 2005 SXSW Film is considered by some to be the origin of the [[mumblecore]] film genre. A number of films now classified as mumblecore, including ''[[The Puffy Chair]]'', ''[[Kissing on the Mouth]]'', ''[[Four Eyed Monsters]]'' and ''[[Mutual Appreciation]]'', were screened, and [[Eric Masunaga]], a musician and the [[audio engineering|sound editor]] on ''Mutual Appreciation'', is credited with coining the term "mumblecore" at a bar while at the festival.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Dennis (August 19, 2007). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/19/movies/19lim.html?8dpc Mumblecore – The New Talkies: Generation DIY]". ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film ''[[Hooligans (film)|Hooligans]]'' won both the Feature Film Jury Award and the Feature Film Audience Award for narrative feature, while ''The Puffy Chair'' won the Feature Film Audience Award in the "Emerging Visions" category. The documentary film ''[[Cowboy del Amor]]'' won the SXSW Competition Award and the Audience Award.

A secret concert at the 2006 SXSW Music by the band [[The Flaming Lips]] was called one of the "Top 10 Music-Festival Moments" of all time by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1885895_1885893_1885860,00.html Top 10 Music-Festival Moments: Flaming Lips at SXSW — 2006], Dan Fletcher, ''Time'', March 18, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 SXSW Interactive featured a keynote panel of Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] and [[Craigslist]] founder [[Craig Newmark]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auscillate.com/post/95 SXSW 2006 Panel: Craig Newmark &amp; Jimmy Wales Keynote], ''Auscillate'' blog, March 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

That year, "Screenburn at SXSW", a component for [[video game]]s, was added to SXSW Interactive.&lt;ref name="sxsw stays course" /&gt;

The 2007 music festival took place from March 14 to 18, and more than 1,400 acts performed.

Two of the top film premieres that year were ''[[Elvis and Anabelle]]'' and ''[[Skills Like This]]''.

The [[social media]] platform [[Twitter]] notably gained a good deal of early traction and buzz at the 2007 SXSW Interactive,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-process-involved-in-launching-a-startup-at-SXSW What is the process involved in launching a startup at SXSW?], ''[[Quora]]''&lt;/ref&gt; though it did not launch at SXSW 2007 as is sometimes reported.&lt;ref name="sxsw stays course" /&gt;

The 2008 SXSW Interactive got media attention due to a keynote interview of [[Facebook]] CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]] by technology journalist [[Sarah Lacy]] that was considered by some observers to be a "train wreck" due to an audience perception that Lacy was asking uninteresting questions, as well as mocking or terse answers in response from Zuckerberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-13772_3-9889528-52.html Journalist becomes the story at Mark Zuckerberg SXSWi keynote], Daniel Terdiman, ''CNET'' "Geek Gestalt" blog, March 9, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a comedy element was added to SXSW; it was held for one night. (By 2012, comedy performances occurred on all nights of the festival.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Messin' with Texas: Why Doesn't SXSW Pay its Comedians? |url=http://splitsider.com/2012/01/messin-with-texas-why-doesnt-sxsw-pay-its-comedians/ |publisher=''[[Splitsider]]'' |first=Richard |last=Morgan |date=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 festival was held March 13–22. The Interactive section of SXSW in particular drew larger attendance levels; the influx strained the networks of providers such as [[AT&amp;T]] (primarily due to heavy [[iPhone]] usage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.wired.com/business/2009/03/sxsw-atts-spott.html |title=SXSW: IPhone Influx Pushes AT&amp;T to the Limit |work=Epicenter (blog.wired.com) |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications|Conde Nast]] |date=March 14, 2009 |first=Michael |last=Calore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also new was the founding of an international organization for those not attending, dubbed NotAtSXSW. Coordinating through [[Twitter]] and other online tools, notatsxsw events were held in London, New York, Wisconsin, Portland, Oregon and Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/mar/18/notatsxsw-festival-twitter |title= Can't make it to SXSW this year?

[[Image:Foursquare-logo.png|thumb|The mobile app, Foursquare, was launched at SXSW 2009.]]
The 2009 SXSW Interactive saw the launch of the [[Foursquare (social network)|Foursquare]] application, which was called "the breakout [[mobile app]]" of the event by the ''[[Mashable]]'' blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van |first=Jennifer |url=http://mashable.com/2009/03/16/foursquare/ |title=Foursquare is the Breakout Mobile App at SXSW |publisher=Mashable.com |date=2009-03-16 |accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 SXSW Film screened 250 films, including 54 world premieres. The event was notable for having the United States premiere of the film ''[[The Hurt Locker]]'', which went on to win the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="sxsw stays course" /&gt; The winners of the feature jury awards were, for documentary feature, ''[[45365]]'', and for narrative feature, ''[[Made in China (2009 film)|Made in China]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/made_in_china_and_45365_take_top_sxsw_jury_prizes/ |title="Made in China" and "45365" Take Top SXSW Jury Prizes |publisher=Indiewire |date=March 18, 2009 |accessdate=February 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010===

At the 2010 Film festival, [[Magnolia Pictures]] bought the film rights to the science-fiction film ''[[Monsters (2010 film)|Monsters]]'' on the night it screened, in what was the first-ever "overnight acquisition" at SXSW.

The 2010 Interactive festival had an estimated 12–13,000 paying attendees, which represented a 40% jump over the previous year.&lt;ref name="interactive surpasses music"&gt;[http://www.austin360.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/digitalsavant/entries/2010/03/17/confirmed_sxsw.html Confirmed: SXSW Interactive paid registration surpasses Music], Omar L.

==Economic impact==
SXSW is the highest revenue-producing event (outside of athletic and other events associated with the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]]) for the Austin economy, with an estimated economic impact of $190.3 million in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: SXSW’s 2012 economic impact was $190 million|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/business/sxsws-2012-economic-impact-190-million/nSTKt/|publisher=Austin American Statesman|accessdate=April 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; increasing to $218 million in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.austinchamber.com/blog/2013/09/18/sxsw-announces-2013-impact-on-the-austin-economy/ |title=SXSW Announces 2013 Impact on the Austin Economy &amp;#124; Austin Chamber Divisional Blogs |publisher=Austinchamber.com |date=September 18, 2013 |accessdate=March 17, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316024643/https://www.austinchamber.com/blog/2013/09/18/sxsw-announces-2013-impact-on-the-austin-economy/ |archivedate=March 16, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; $315 million in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/sxsws-economic-impact-on-austin-in-2014-was-worth-315-million/|title=SXSW's Economic Impact On Austin In 2014 Was Worth $315 Million|date=2014-09-12|work=Texas Monthly|access-date=2017-08-11|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; $317 million in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/blog/techflash/2015/09/sxsw-economic-impact-grows-slightly-from-2014.html|title=SXSW economic impact grows slightly from 2014|last=Swiatecki|first=Chad|date=September 15, 2015|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $325 million in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2016/09/07/sxsw-economic-impact-up-slightly-in-2016-hotel.html|title=SXSW economic impact up slightly in 2016; hotel rates hit new high|last=Theis|first=Michael|date=September 7, 2016|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In comparison, [[Super Bowl LI]] brought a $347 million economic impact to the Houston economy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/houston/news/2017/05/25/results-are-in-how-much-the-2017-super-bowl.html|title=Results are in: How much the 2017 Super Bowl brought to Houston|last=Martin|first=Joe|date=May 25, 2017|website=www.bizjournals.com/houston|access-date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2016 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2016 Final Four]] brought a $324 million economic impact to the economy of Phoenix, Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/2017/08/11/final-four-gave-phoenix-area-325-million-economic-slam-dunk-asu-study-says/555967001/|title=Final Four gave Phoenix area a $325 million economic slam dunk, ASU study says|last=Wiles|first=Russ|date=August 11, 2017|work=azcentral|access-date=2017-08-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Additionally, demand for hotel rooms in the Austin area continued to outstrip supply, pushing average nightly room rates up to an all-time high of $350 in 2016, a 60 percent increase over the average room rate seen during 2011's edition of SXSW. The average SXSW registrant also stayed in Austin longer in 2016, spending an average of 5.2 nights, up from 4.9 nights in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2016/09/07/sxsw-economic-impact-up-slightly-in-2016-hotel.html|title=SXSW economic impact up slightly in 2016; hotel rates hit new high|last=Theis|first=Michael|date=September 7, 2016|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2017-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The growth of the festival has brought concerns about violence, [[crowd control]], and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/music/2011/03/violence_and_crowd_control_pro.html|title=Violence and crowd control problems cause SXSW to consider limiting events|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=2015-08-13|first=Thomas|last=Conner|date=March 21, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141208100955/http://blogs.suntimes.com/music/2011/03/violence_and_crowd_control_pro.html|archivedate=December 8, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/03/27/sxsw-accident-fourth-death/6970477/|title=SXSW accident claims fourth life|author=Marjorie Owens, WFAA-TV, Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas|date=27 March 2014|newspaper=USA Today|accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2018|11|28}}&lt;!-- and then what?  What happened with this 2014 lawsuit?  Was the festival implicated?  Festival organizers?  Or was it just a drunk driving accident that, sadly, still happens a couple million times annually. --&gt;

The 2014 drunk-driving incident prompted discussion about whether the festival had grown too large and raucous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-sxsw-car-accident-tragedy-20140314,0,4850567.story |title=A tragic wake-up call for SXSW? |publisher=latimes.com |date=March 13, 2014 |first1=Mikael |last1=Wood |first2=August |last2=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizers of the festival&amp;mdash;SXSW Holdings LLC and SXSW Holdings Inc.&amp;mdash;were sued by families of the four victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kxan.com/2014/12/18/lawsuits-deadly-sxsw-crash-could-have-been-prevented/|title=Lawsuits: Deadly SXSW crash could have been prevented|publisher=KXAN|accessdate=2015-08-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824065806/http://kxan.com/2014/12/18/lawsuits-deadly-sxsw-crash-could-have-been-prevented/|archive-date=2015-08-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014, partially motivated by the 2014 crash, Austin's Urban Transportation Commission announced that it was seeking to enhance safety at the festival, with an initial focus on implementing transportation measures to resolve issues linked to the festival. The Austin Music Commission also met to discuss music venues and sound problems linked to the festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khou.com/news/texas-news?fId=259080131&amp;fPath=/news/local/&amp;fDomain=10232 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140517065154/http://www.khou.com/news/texas-news?fId=259080131&amp;fPath=/news/local/&amp;fDomain=10232 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 17, 2014 |accessdate=May 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city voted to limit the number of special events which would be approved to 114, a 32 percent decrease from the number of approved events during the 2014 festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/blog/creative/2015/02/a-smaller-sxsw-austin-halts-applications-for.html|title=A smaller SXSW? Austin halts applications for special events|date=11 February 2015|work=Austin Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another frequent criticism of the SXSW festival is that it has become overly commercialized. In 2013, NPR writer Andrea Swensson wrote that she had decided to stop attending the festival, writing, "I can't help but feel that it has strayed far away from its original premise as a grassroots gathering place for new, undiscovered talent and increasingly feels like a big ol' [[Times Square]] billboard-sized commercial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Why I'm Not Going To SXSW This Year |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2013/03/05/173097673/why-im-not-going-to-sxsw-this-year |publisher=NPR |date=March 5, 2013 |first=Andrea |last=Swensson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, SXSW announced the cancellation of two video game panels ("#SavePoint: A Discussion on the Gaming Community" and "Level Up: Overcoming Harassment In Games") scheduled for the 2016 festival due to threats of violence made to the festival hosting the sessions.&lt;ref name="wash_SXSW"&gt;{{Cite news | title = SXSW canceled two panels after threats — but did nothing when female panelists asked about harassment | last = Dewey | first = Caitlin | work = Washington Post | date = October 27, 2015 | accessdate = 2015-10-28 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/10/27/sxsw-canceled-two-panels-after-threats-but-did-nothing-when-female-panelists-asked-about-harassment/ | language =   | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the cancellations, [[Buzzfeed]] and [[Vox Media]] made statements saying they would pull out of the festival if the two panels weren't reinstated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.blog.austin360.com/2015/10/26/sxsw-interactive-cancels-two-2016-panels-due-to-threats/|title=SXSW Interactive cancels two 2016 panels due to threats|last=Gallaga|first=Omar L.|work=[[Austin 360]]|date=October 27, 2015|accessdate=October 27, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305084400/http://tech.blog.austin360.com/2015/10/26/sxsw-interactive-cancels-two-2016-panels-due-to-threats/|archive-date=2016-03-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reco_Buzz"&gt;{{Cite news | title = BuzzFeed and Vox Media Threaten to Bail on SXSW Unless Canceled Panels Are Reinstated | last = Kulwin | first = Noah | work = Re/code | date = October 27, 2015 | accessdate = 2015-10-28 | url = https://recode.net/2015/10/27/buzzfeed-to-withdraw-from-sxsw-unless-organizers-reverse-panel-cancelations/ | quote =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the criticism, South by Southwest admitted that their decision to cancel the panels was a mistake. In lieu of a panel, South by Southwest hosted a daylong "online harassment summit" on March 12, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='We Made a Mistake': SXSW to Host Online Harassment Summit|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/we-made-mistake-sxsw-host-online-harassment-summit-n454651|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite fears that violent hecklers would disrupt the summit, it was described by Brian Fung as "a largely peaceful affair", with protests limited to those who were angry about the bag searches conducted there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/03/13/sxsw-the-most-and-least-remarkable-thing-about-the-online-harassment-summit/ | title=SXSW: The most (and least) remarkable thing about the online harassment summit | work=Washington Post | date=13 March 2016 | accessdate=13 March 2016 | author=Fung, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* Comedian and actor [[Fred Armisen]] began his comic career with the short film ''Fred Armisen's Guide to Music and SXSW'', released in 1998, in which he poses as various characters, asking silly questions of musicians and other attendees at that year's SXSW Music Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia/cast-and-crew/fred-armisen-co-creator-co-writer-co-star |title=Portlandia – Fred Armisen – co-creator, co-writer, co-star – IFC |publisher=Ifc.com |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2015-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150804085943/http://www.ifc.com/shows/portlandia/cast-and-crew/fred-armisen-co-creator-co-writer-co-star |archivedate=2015-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|tOp1uPpjYgo|Fred Armisen's Guide to Music and SXSW}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2011 documentary ''[[Winning America]]'' is about a US tour of Canadian band [[Said the Whale]] that culminates in that year's SXSW Music Festival.
* In the 2014 British film ''[[Frank (film)|Frank]]'', an experimental band (led by the title character) is booked to play a show at the SXSW Music Festival, but the gig leads to the band's breakup.

==Similar festivals==
The creators of South by Southwest co-created two similar festivals in 1995: North by Northwest (NXNW) in [[Portland, Oregon]] (co-founded by the ''[[Willamette Week]]''), and [[North by Northeast]] (NXNE) in [[Toronto]] (co-founded by ''[[Now (newspaper)|Now]]'').&lt;ref name="four-letter festivals"&gt;{{cite web |title=Alt-Weeklies' Four-Letter Festivals: Movement Grows as Silicon Valley Launches C2SV |url=http://www.altweeklies.com/aan/alt-weeklies-four-letter-festivals-movement-grows-as-silicon-valley-launches-c2sv/Article?oid=7274104 |author=Metro Silicon Valley |publisher=AAN News |date=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; North by Northwest ended in 2001, and was replaced by [[MusicfestNW]] (MFNW), an event run entirely by the ''Willamette Week''. It was joined by [[TechfestNW]], a technology conference, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/08/28/tech-may-have-found-its-next-sxsw/ Tech may have found its next SXSW], John Patrick Pullen, ''CNNMoney'', August 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006 to 2010, SXSW organizers also ran West by Southwest (WXSW) in [[Tucson, Arizona]], a music festival which occurred directly before South by Southwest and mostly featured bands that were also booked for SXSW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tucsoncitizen.com/morgue2/2006/03/09/115421-go-west-by-southwest-young-band/ Go West (by Southwest), young band], Polly Higgins, ''[[Tucson Citizen]]'', March 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Other active festivals inspired by SXSW include the following:
* [[Web Summit]] – [[Lisbon, Portugal]]
* Live at Heart – [[Örebro, Sweden]]
* South by Due East – [[Houston, Texas]]
* The Goa Project – [[Goa, India]]
* [[The Great Escape Festival]] – [[Brighton, England]]
* [[Tech Open Air]] (TOA) – [[Berlin]]
* [[XOXO (festival)|XOXO]] – [[Portland, Oregon]]

Festivals inspired by SXSW that are no longer running include:
* [[35 Denton]] (originally known as "North by 35" or "NX35", then "35 Conferette") – [[Denton, Texas]] (2009-2016)
* [[C2SV]] (originally known as "SVSX") – [[San Jose, California]] (2012-2016)
* [[Incubate (festival)|Incubate]] (originally known as "ZXZW") – [[Tilburg, Netherlands]] (2005-2016)
* [[MidPoint Music Festival]] (MPMF) – [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] (2001-2017)
* [[MoSo]] – [[Saskatoon, Canada]] (2011-2016)
* So What?! Music Fest (originally known as "South by So What?!") – [[Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex]] (2006-2017)
* Sounds by South Bend (originally known as "South by South Bend") - [[South Bend, Indiana]] (2013-2015)
* Yes and Yes Yes (YXYY) (originally known as "Yes by Yes Yes") – [[Palm Springs, California]] (2013-2017)

Festivals inspired by South by Southwest have been collectively nicknamed "four-letter festivals". ''[[Metro Silicon Valley]]'', which founded C2SV, wrote in 2013 that such festivals were important revenue sources for the [[alternative newspaper|alternative weekly newspapers]] that founded them.&lt;ref name="four-letter festivals" /&gt;

On October 3, 2016, a one-day festival, called "South by [[South Lawn]]" (SXSL), was held at the [[White House]]; it was a collaboration between SXSW, US President [[Barack Obama]], and the [[American Film Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/09/01/announcing-south-south-lawn-white-house-festival-ideas-art-and-action|title=Announcing South by South Lawn: A White House Festival of Ideas, Art, and Action|date=1 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE-LENGTH FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS! --&gt;
The [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the [[Chitauri]]. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract,{{refn|name=Tesseract|group=N|Producer Kevin Feige stated that the Tesseract is based on the [[Cosmic Cube]] from Marvel comics.&lt;ref name="movieline" /&gt; After ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'', he stated that it was also the Space [[Infinity Stone]].&lt;ref name="CraveOnline3" /&gt;}} a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. [[Nick Fury]], director of the espionage agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], and his lieutenant Agent [[Maria Hill]] arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent [[Phil Coulson]] explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a [[wormhole]], allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]], to aid him in his getaway.

In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the "[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers Initiative]]". Agent [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff]] is sent to [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] to recruit [[Hulk (comics)|Dr. Bruce Banner]] to trace the Tesseract through its [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]] emissions. Coulson visits [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]] to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract.

In [[Stuttgart]], Barton steals [[iridium]] needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]]. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.

The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above [[Stark Tower]] to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.

Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.

In a mid-credits scene, the Other confers with his master{{refn|name=Thanos|group=N|Feige confirmed that the "master" in the post-credits scene is [[Thanos]].&lt;ref name="EmpirePodcast" /&gt;}}&lt;!-- NOTE!

[[File:The Avengers Cast 2010 Comic-Con cropped.jpg|thumb|Cast of ''The Avengers'' at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], with [[Joss Whedon]] and [[Kevin Feige]].]]
* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark / Iron Man]]: {{Cast list break|A self-described genius, billionaire, [[Playboy (lifestyle)|playboy]], and [[philanthropy|philanthropist]] with an [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Live action|electromechanical suit of armor]] of his own invention. Downey was cast as part of his four-picture deal with Marvel Studios, which included ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' and ''The Avengers''.&lt;ref name="RDJ" /&gt; Downey said that he initially pushed Whedon to make Stark the lead: "Well, I said, 'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.' We tried it and it didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus."&lt;ref name="EW4" /&gt; About the character's evolution from previous films, Downey said, "In ''Iron Man'', which was an origin story, he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts. ''Iron Man 2'' is all about not being an island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others. . . In ''The Avengers'', he's throwing it down with the others".&lt;ref name="Filmink" /&gt; Downey earned $50 million "once box-office bonuses and backend compensation [were] factored in".&lt;ref name="CastPay" /&gt;}}
* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as [[Captain America|Steve Rogers / Captain America]]: {{Cast list break|A [[World War II]] veteran who was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world. Evans was cast as part of a deal to star in three Marvel films, in addition to ''The Avengers''.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt; Evans said that Steve Rogers is much darker in ''The Avengers'': "It's just about him trying to come to terms with the modern world. You've got to imagine, it's enough of a shock to accept the fact that you're in a completely different time, but everybody you know is dead. Everybody you cared about. . . He was a soldier, obviously, everybody he went to battle with, all of his brothers in arms, they're all dead. He's just lonely. I think in the beginning it's a fish-out-of-water scene, and it's tough. It's a tough pill for him to swallow. Then comes trying to find a balance with the modern world."&lt;ref name="EW4" /&gt; Regarding the dynamic between Rogers and Tony Stark, Evans said, "I think there's certainly a dichotomy—this kind of friction between myself and Tony Stark, they're polar opposites. One guy is flash and spotlight and smooth, and the other guy is selfless and in the shadows and kind of quiet and they have to get along. They explore that, and it's pretty fun."&lt;ref name="MTVNews10" /&gt; Evans earned $2-3 million for the film.&lt;ref name="CastPay" /&gt;}}
* [[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner / Hulk]]: {{Cast list break|A genius scientist who, because of exposure to [[Gamma ray|gamma radiation]], transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated. Ruffalo, who was considered to play Banner in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' before [[Edward Norton]] took the role,&lt;ref name="CastRuffalo2" /&gt; was cast after negotiations between Marvel and Norton broke down.&lt;ref name="Ruffalo" /&gt; About replacing Norton, Ruffalo said, "I'm a friend of Ed's, and yeah, that wasn't a great way for all that to go down. But the way I see it is that Ed has bequeathed this part to me. I look at it as my generation's ''[[Hamlet]]''." About the character, he said, "He's a guy struggling with two sides of himself—the dark and the light—and everything he does in his life is filtered through issues of control. I grew up on the [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|Bill Bixby TV series]], which I thought was a really nuanced and real human way to look at the Hulk. I like that the part has those qualities".&lt;ref name="EW1" /&gt; Regarding the Hulk's place on the team, Ruffalo said, "He's like the teammate none of them are sure they want on their team. He's a loose cannon. It's like, 'Just throw a grenade in the middle of the group and let's hope it turns out well!"&lt;ref name="Kimmel" /&gt; This is the first production in which the actor playing Banner also plays the Hulk. Ruffalo told ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine, "I'm really excited. No one's ever played the Hulk exactly; they've always done CGI. They're going to do the ''Avatar'' stop-action, stop-motion capture. So I'll actually play the Hulk. That'll be fun".&lt;ref name="NYMag" /&gt; The [[3D modeling|3D model]] used to create the Hulk's body was modeled after [[Long Island]] bodybuilder and male stripper Steve Romm, while the Hulk's face was modeled after Ruffalo.&lt;ref name="CastRuffalo1" /&gt; To create the Hulk's voice, Ruffalo's voice was blended with those of [[Lou Ferrigno]] and others;&lt;ref name="soundworks" /&gt; however, the Hulk's only speaking line ("Puny god.") was provided solely by Ruffalo.&lt;ref name="HulkVoice" /&gt; Ruffalo earned $2-3 million for the film.&lt;ref name="CastPay" /&gt;}}
* [[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]: {{Cast list break|The [[crown prince]] of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], based on the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] deity of the [[Thor|same name]]. Hemsworth was cast as part of a multiple movie deal.&lt;ref name="Hemsworth" /&gt; He had previously worked with Joss Whedon on ''[[The Cabin in the Woods]]''.&lt;ref name="MTVNews7" /&gt; Hemsworth said that he was able to maintain the strength he built up for ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' by increasing his food intake, consisting of chicken breasts, fish, steak, and eggs every day. When asked exactly how much, Hemsworth said, "My body weight in protein pretty much!"&lt;ref name="EOnline" /&gt; He remarked that Thor's motivation "is much more of a personal one, in the sense that it's his brother that is stirring things up. Whereas everyone else, it's some bad guy who they've gotta take down. It's a different approach for me, or for Thor. He's constantly having to battle the greater good and what he should do vs. it's his little brother there. . . I've been frustrated with my brothers at times, or family, but I'm the only one who is allowed to be angry at them. There's a bit of that."&lt;ref name="EW4" /&gt; Hemsworth earned $2-3 million for the film.&lt;ref name="CastPay" /&gt;}}
* [[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow]]: {{Cast list break|A highly trained spy working for S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;ref name="Johannson" /&gt; About the character and her relationship with Hawkeye, Johansson said, "Our characters have a long history. They've fought together for a long time in a lot of battles in many different countries. We're the two members of this avenging group who are skilled warriors – we have no superpowers. Black Widow is definitely one of the team, though. She's not in the cast simply to be a romantic foil or eye candy. She's there to fight, so I never felt like I was the only girl. We all have our various skills and it feels equal".&lt;ref name="Filmink" /&gt; Regarding her training, Johansson said, "Even though ''Iron Man 2'' was 'one-for-them,' I'd never done anything like that before. I'd never been physically driven in something, or a part of something so big. For ''The Avengers'', I've spent so many months training with our stunt team, and fighting all the other actors, it's crazy. I do nothing but fight—all the time."&lt;ref name="Biskind" /&gt; Johansson earned $4-6 million for the film.&lt;ref name="CastPay" /&gt;}}
* [[Jeremy Renner]] as [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton / Hawkeye]]: {{Cast list break|A master [[Archery|archer]] working as an agent for S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;ref name="Renner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABCNews" /&gt; Renner said it was a very physical role and that he trained physically and practiced archery as much as possible in preparation.&lt;ref name="WSJ" /&gt; About the role, Renner said, "When I saw ''Iron Man'', I thought that was a really kick-ass approach to superheroes. Then they told me about this Hawkeye character, and I liked how he wasn't really a superhero; he's just a guy with a high skill set. I could connect to that."&lt;ref name="Filmink" /&gt; Regarding Hawkeye's sniper mentality, Renner said, "It's a lonely game. He's an outcast. His only connection is to Scarlett's character, Natasha. It's like a left hand/right hand thing. They coexist, and you need them both, especially when it comes to a physical mission."&lt;ref name="Filmink" /&gt; Renner said Hawkeye is not insecure about his humanity. "Quite the opposite, he's the only one who can really take down the Hulk with his [tranquilizer-tipped] arrows. He knows his limitations. But when it comes down to it, there has to be a sense of confidence in any superhero."&lt;ref name="EW4" /&gt; Renner earned $2-3 million for the film.&lt;ref name="CastPay" /&gt;}}
* [[Tom Hiddleston]] as [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]: {{Cast list break|Thor's adoptive brother and nemesis, based on the Norse mythological deity of the [[Loki|same name]].&lt;ref name="Hemsworth" /&gt; About his character's evolution from the film ''Thor'', Hiddleston said, "I think the Loki we see in ''The Avengers'' is further advanced. You have to ask yourself the question: How pleasant an experience is it disappearing into a wormhole that has been created by some kind of super nuclear explosion of his own making? So I think by the time Loki shows up in ''The Avengers'', he's seen a few things."&lt;ref name="HiddlestonInt1" /&gt; About Loki's motivations, Hiddleston said, "At the beginning of ''The Avengers'', he comes to Earth to subjugate it and his idea is to rule the human race as their king. And like all the delusional autocrats of human history, he thinks this is a great idea because if everyone is busy worshipping him, there will be no wars so he will create some kind of world peace by ruling them as a tyrant. But he is also kind of deluded in the fact that he thinks unlimited power will give him self-respect, so I haven't let go of the fact that he is still motivated by this terrible jealousy and kind of spiritual desolation."&lt;ref name="HollywoodReporter5" /&gt;}}
* [[Clark Gregg]] as [[Phil Coulson]]: {{Cast list break|An agent with S.H.I.E.L.D. who oversees many of the division's field operations.&lt;ref name="Gregg" /&gt; Gregg was cast as part of a multi-picture deal with Marvel.&lt;ref name="Gregg2" /&gt; Gregg said his role was expanded in ''The Avengers'': "[What] Agent Coulson had become in terms of the import of this particular story, and how important his job is in bringing the Avengers together, it kind of felt a little surreal, like somebody was playing a prank and that wasn't the real script. But it wasn't, it was the real thing, I got to show up and do that stuff, and it felt like such an amazing payoff to what the journey had been and the fact I had been doing it for five years."&lt;ref name="Gregg3" /&gt; Gregg said Whedon provided insight into his character's backstory, particularly about Coulson being a fan of Captain America.&lt;ref name="Gregg3" /&gt;}}
* [[Cobie Smulders]] as [[Maria Hill]]: {{Cast list break|A high-ranking agent with S.H.I.E.L.D. who works closely with Nick Fury.&lt;ref name="SmuldersCostume" /&gt; Smulders, whom Joss Whedon once considered for his [[Wonder Woman in other media#Live action film|unproduced live-action Wonder Woman film]], was selected from a short list of potential actresses including [[Morena Baccarin]]. Smulders' deal would integrate her into nine films.&lt;ref name="HollywoodReporter3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Variety3" /&gt; Regarding her preparation, Smulders said, "I hired this amazing black-ops trainer to teach me how to hold a gun, take me to a shooting range, how to hit, how to hold myself, how to walk and basically how to look. I don't do a ton of fighting in the movie, which is why I wasn't offered a trainer, but I wanted to look like I had the ability to."&lt;ref name="HIMYM" /&gt; On relating to the character, Smulders said, "I can relate to her being a mom and being a businesswoman and trying to work full-time and raising a family and having a career. We're asked to do a lot of things these days. I feel she is just all about her job and keeping things going."&lt;ref name="HollywoodReporter4" /&gt;}}
* [[Stellan Skarsgård]] as [[Erik Selvig]]: {{Cast list break|An astrophysicist and a friend of Thor under Loki's control, who is studying the Tesseract's power.&lt;ref name="Expressen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSA" /&gt; Regarding Loki's control over Selvig, Skarsgård said, "Well with the scene we did in ''Thor'', it was like Loki, one way or the other, entered Erik's mind. And in Avengers, you will see more clarity in how Loki is using Erik's mind."&lt;ref name="SSA" /&gt; About his role, he said, "[My character] is of importance but the size of the role is not big."&lt;ref name="SSA" /&gt;}}
* [[Samuel L. Jackson]] as [[Nick Fury]]: {{Cast list break|The director of S.H.I.E.L.D., who was revealed in previous films to be coordinating the "Avengers Initiative". Jackson was brought to the project with a deal containing an option to play the character in up to nine Marvel films.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; Jackson said he does more in ''The Avengers'' than in any of the previous films: "You don't have to wait until the end of the movie to see me". About the role, Jackson said, "It's always good to play somebody [who] is a positive in society as opposed to somebody who is a negative. . . I tried to make him as honest to the story and as honest to what real-life would seem." Jackson compared the character to Ordell in ''[[Jackie Brown (film)|Jackie Brown]]'', calling him "a nice guy to hang out with. You just don't want to cross him".&lt;ref name="BBCRadio" /&gt; Jackson earned $4-6 million for the film.&lt;ref name="CastPay" /&gt;}}

[[Gwyneth Paltrow]] and [[Maximiliano Hernández]] reprise their roles from previous films as [[Pepper Potts]] and [[Jasper Sitwell]], respectively. [[Paul Bettany]] returns to voice [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] Frequent Whedon collaborator [[Alexis Denisof]] portrays the Other, and [[Damion Poitier]] portrays his master, [[Thanos]] (unnamed in the film), in a post-credit scene.&lt;ref name="Poitier" /&gt; [[Powers Boothe]] and [[Jenny Agutter]] appear as members of the World Security Council.&lt;ref name="Boothe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Agutter" /&gt; Avengers co-creator [[Stan Lee]] has a cameo appearance in a news report.

Ideas for a film based on the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] began in 2003,&lt;ref name="ThrillistApril2018" /&gt; with [[Avi Arad]], the CEO of Marvel Studios, first announcing plans to develop the film in April 2005, after Marvel Enterprises declared independence by allying with [[Merrill Lynch]] to produce a slate of films that would be distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref name="Variety1" /&gt; Marvel discussed their plans in a brief presentation to [[Wall Street]] analysts; the studio's intention was to release individual films for the main characters—to establish their identities and familiarize audiences with them—before merging the characters together in a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] film.&lt;ref name="Cinematical1" /&gt; Screenwriter [[Zak Penn]], who wrote ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008), became attached to the film in 2006,&lt;ref name="ThrillistApril2018" /&gt; and was hired by Marvel Studios to write the film in June 2007.&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt; In the wake of the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], Marvel negotiated with the [[Writers Guild of America]] to ensure that it could create films based on its comic book counterparts, including Captain America, [[Ant-Man]] and The Avengers.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt; After the successful release of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008) in May, the company set a July 2011 release date for ''The Avengers''.&lt;ref name="SuperheroHype" /&gt; In September 2008, Marvel Studios reached an agreement with Paramount—an extension of a previous partnership—which gave the company distribution rights for five future Marvel films.&lt;ref name="HollywoodReporter" /&gt;

Casting began in October 2008 with Downey's signing.&lt;ref name="RDJ" /&gt; Though [[Don Cheadle]] was also reported to be reprising his ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' role of [[War Machine]] for ''The Avengers'', he later stated that he did not think the character would appear in the film.&lt;ref name="RDJ" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MTVNews9" /&gt; At the same time, two major prospects occurred for Marvel: [[Jon Favreau]] was brought in as an executive producer for the film,&lt;ref name="RDJ" /&gt; and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films—''Iron Man&amp;nbsp;2'', ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' (2011), and ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011)—at their [[Manhattan Beach, California]] complex.&lt;ref name="HollywoodReporter2" /&gt; [[Lou Ferrigno]], who voiced Hulk in ''The Incredible Hulk'', stated that he would be involved in the film.&lt;ref name="Ferrigno" /&gt; In February 2009, [[Samuel L. Jackson]] signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in ''Iron Man&amp;nbsp;2'' and other films.&lt;ref name="Jackson" /&gt; In September 2009, [[Edward Norton]], who played Bruce Banner in ''The Incredible Hulk'' stated that he was open to returning in the film.&lt;ref name="MTVNews" /&gt; The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film, but would "definitely have input and a say". Favreau also expressed concerns, stating, "It's going to be hard, because I was so involved in creating the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then with ''Avengers'' you're going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor... [Mixing] the two of those works very well in the comic books, but it's going to take a lot of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created".&lt;ref name="MTVNews2" /&gt; In March 2009, actress Scarlett Johansson replaced [[Emily Blunt]] in portraying Natasha Romanoff in ''Iron Man 2'', a deal that subsequently attached her to ''The Avengers''.&lt;ref name="Johannson" /&gt; The following day, Marvel announced that the film's release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later.&lt;ref name="Cinematical3" /&gt; Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film's cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.&lt;ref name="Hemsworth" /&gt;

In July 2009, Penn talked about the crossover process, stating, "My job is to kind of shuttle between the different movies and make sure that finally we're mimicking that comic book structure where all of these movies are connected. . . There's just a board that tracks 'Here's where everything that happens in this movie overlaps with that movie'. . . I'm pushing them to do as many animatics as possible to animate the movie, to draw boards so that we're all working off the same visual ideas. But the exigencies of production take first priority".&lt;ref name="CraveOnline" /&gt; At first, Penn tried to reduce Thor's role in the script because he had doubts about the character's ability to succeed on film. He changed his mind once Hemsworth was cast as Thor.&lt;ref name="PennMarch2018" /&gt; The film had always intended to use Loki as its villain, but Penn noted that early discussion had considered using [[Red Skull]].&lt;ref name="RedSkull" /&gt;

In January 2010, Marvel Studios chief [[Kevin Feige]] was asked if it would be difficult to meld the fantasy of ''Thor'' with the high-tech science fiction in ''Iron Man'' and ''The Avengers''. "No," he said, "because we're doing the [[Jack Kirby]]/Stan Lee/[[Walt Simonson]]/[[J. Michael Straczynski]] ''Thor''. We're not doing the blow-the-dust-off-of-the-old-Norse-book-in-your-library ''Thor''. And in the ''Thor'' of the Marvel Universe, there's a race called the Asgardians. And we're linked through this Tree of Life that we're unaware of. It's real science, but we don't know about it yet. The 'Thor' movie is about teaching people that".&lt;ref name="SuperheroHype2" /&gt; In March, it was reported that Penn had completed the first draft of the script, and that Marvel editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] and ''Avengers'' comic-book writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]] had received copies.&lt;ref name="MTVNews3" /&gt; Also in March, [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] accepted an offer to play Captain America in three films including ''The Avengers''.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;

===Pre-production===
By April 2010, [[Joss Whedon]] was close to completing a deal to direct the film and to rework Penn's script,&lt;ref name="Whedon" /&gt; and was officially announced in July 2010.&lt;ref name="Slashfilm" /&gt; On the hiring, Arad stated: "My personal opinion is that Joss will do a fantastic job. He loves these characters and is a fantastic writer... It's part of his life so you know he is going to protect it... I expect someone like him is going to make the script even better".&lt;ref name="SuperheroHype3" /&gt; Feige added, "I've known Joss for many years. We were looking for the right thing and he came in and met on it... we want[ed] to find a director that’s on the verge of doing something great, as we think Joss is."&lt;ref name="MTVNews8" /&gt; Whedon stated at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]], that what drew him to the film is that he loves how "these people shouldn't be in the same room let alone on the same team—and that is the definition of family".&lt;ref name="MTVNews4" /&gt;

When Whedon received Penn's draft, he told Feige he felt the studio did not "have anything" and they should "pretend this draft never happened".&lt;ref name="WhedonBusinessInsider" /&gt; Part of Whedon's issue was the lack of character connections in Penn's draft, which necessitated Whedon to begin "at square one".&lt;ref name="ThrillistApril2018" /&gt; Whedon went on to write a five page treatment of his plan for the film, and created the tagline "Avengers: Some Assembly Required", riffing on the "Avengers Assemble" slogan from the comic books. Marvel quickly began working to sign Whedon to write and direct, only stipulating that he include the Avengers against Loki, a battle among the heroes in the middle, a battle against the villains at the end, and he get the film done for its May 2012 release.&lt;ref name="WhedonBusinessInsider" /&gt; The script would go through "a lot of insane iterations of what might be" according to Whedon. Whedon explained there was a point when it was not certain Johansson would star in the film, so he "wrote a huge bunch of pages starring [[Wasp (comics)|The Wasp]]." He also was "worried that one British character actor [(Hiddleston)] was not enough to take on Earth's mightiest heroes, and that we'd feel like we were rooting for the overdog. So I wrote a huge draft with [[Zeke Stane|Ezekiel Stane]], [[Iron Monger|Obadiah Stane]]'s son, in it." Once all of the actors were "locked in place the movie stayed on mission." Whedon noted that the characters used do not have the same issue, unlike the [[X-Men]]. He felt "these guys just don't belong together" before realizing their interactions could be like ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]'' (1967). Whedon also referenced ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' (1964), ''[[The Abyss]]'' (1989), ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), and ''[[Black Hawk Down (film)|Black Hawk Down]]'' (2001). Whedon would ultimately share final screenplay credit with Penn, though Whedon noted he "fought" for sole credit and was "very upset about it." Penn felt the two "could have collaborated more, but that was not his choice. He wanted to do it his way, and I respect that."&lt;ref name="ThrillistApril2018" /&gt; 

[[File:Joss Whedon looking right.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Joss Whedon at the 2010 [[San Diego Comic-Con International]]]]
The casting process continued into much of 2010, with the additions of [[Jeremy Renner]],&lt;ref name="Renner" /&gt; [[Mark Ruffalo]],&lt;ref name="Ruffalo" /&gt; and [[Clark Gregg]].&lt;ref name="Gregg" /&gt; Ruffalo replaced Edward Norton, whom Marvel declined to have back.&lt;ref name="HitFix" /&gt; "We have made the decision to not bring Ed Norton back to portray the title role of Bruce Banner in ''The Avengers''," stated Feige. "Our decision is definitely not one based on monetary factors, but instead rooted in the need for an actor who embodies the creativity and collaborative spirit of our other talented cast members. ''The Avengers'' demands players who thrive working as part of an ensemble, as evidenced by Robert, Chris H, Chris E, Samuel, Scarlett, and all of our talented casts. We are looking to announce a name actor who fulfills these requirements, and is passionate about the iconic role in the coming weeks."&lt;ref name="HitFix2" /&gt; In response, Norton's agent Brian Swardstrom decried Feige's statement, calling it "purposefully misleading" and an "inappropriate attempt to paint our client in a negative light".&lt;ref name="HitFix3" /&gt; In October 2014, Norton claimed it was his own decision never to play Hulk again because he "wanted more diversity" with his career, and did not want to be associated with only one character.&lt;ref name="NortonTHR" /&gt;

In August 2010, it was reported that Paramount Pictures and Marvel Studios were planning to start shooting in February.&lt;ref name="SuperheroHype4" /&gt; Simultaneously, it was declared that the film would be shot in 3D,&lt;ref name="Showbiz411" /&gt; although Mark Ruffalo later [[twitter|tweeted]] that this was not the case.&lt;ref name="Mruff221" /&gt; In October 2010, [[Grumman Studios]] in [[Bethpage, New York]]&lt;ref name="LIBN" /&gt; and the [[Steiner Studios]] in [[Brooklyn]], New York City, were announced as filming locations,&lt;ref name="NewsdayGrumman" /&gt; with set construction slated to begin in November,&lt;ref name="LIBN" /&gt; but as Whedon later explained, "Originally we were supposed to be in Los Angeles, then for a short period we were supposed to be in New York, and then somehow we ended up in Albuquerque."&lt;ref name="filmfestivaltraveler" /&gt; Also that October, [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]] agreed to pay Paramount at least $115&amp;nbsp;million for the worldwide distribution rights to ''Iron Man&amp;nbsp;3'' and ''The Avengers''.&lt;ref name="Variety2" /&gt; The deal also allowed Paramount to continue to collect the 8&amp;nbsp;percent box office fee it would have earned for distributing the film and a marquee credit—placement of the company's [[production logo]] on marketing materials and the film's opening titles. As a result, the onscreen production credit reads "Marvel Studios presents in association with Paramount Pictures" though the film is solely owned, distributed, financed, and marketed by Disney. Paramount's [[Epix (TV network)|Epix]] retained pay TV rights.&lt;ref name="Variety4" /&gt;

In December 2010, Governor of New Mexico [[Bill Richardson]] and Marvel Studios Co-president Louis D'Esposito announced ''The Avengers'' would film primarily in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], with principal photography scheduled for April through September 2011. Parts of the film were also scheduled to be shot in Michigan,&lt;ref name="FilmNewMexico" /&gt; but a plan to film in [[Detroit]] ended after Governor [[Rick Snyder]] issued a budget proposal that would eliminate a film tax incentive.&lt;ref name="DetroitFreePress" /&gt; Three months later in March, Governor of Ohio [[John Kasich]] announced before Mayor [[Frank G. Jackson]]'s State of the City address that ''The Avengers'' would film in [[Cleveland]].&lt;ref name="Cleveland" /&gt;

Concept illustrator and designer of Iron Man's Mark VII armor Phil Saunders stated that "Joss Whedon was looking for something that had the 'cool' factor of the suitcase suit [from ''Iron Man 2''], while still being a fully armored, heavy duty suit that could take on an army in the final battle." To that end, Saunders borrowed ideas that had been proposed in ''Iron Man&amp;nbsp;2'' as well as some ideas that had been abandoned in ''Iron Man'' and merged them together in a modular suit that has big ammo packets on the arms and a backpack.&lt;ref name="Marvel4" /&gt; The [[Science &amp; Entertainment Exchange]] also provided science consultation for the film.&lt;ref name="SEE" /&gt;

Casting reached its final stages the following year. In February 2011, [[Cobie Smulders]] acquired the role of Maria Hill,&lt;ref name="Variety3" /&gt; after participating in screen tests conducted by Marvel for the role of a key S.H.I.E.L.D. member, who Samuel L. Jackson described as Nick Fury's sidekick.&lt;ref name="HollywoodReporter3" /&gt; Over the successive months, the film's cast expanded to include [[Stellan Skarsgård]],&lt;ref name="Expressen" /&gt; Paul Bettany,&lt;ref name="Bettany" /&gt; and Gwyneth Paltrow.&lt;ref name="PaltrowPossibly" /&gt; Paltrow was cast at Downey's insistence; prior to this, Whedon had not intended the film to include supporting characters from the heroes' individual films, commenting, "You need to separate the characters from their support systems in order to create the isolation you need for a team."&lt;ref name="LATimes3" /&gt;

[[Principal photography]] began on April 25, 2011, in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]] at Albuquerque Studios,&lt;ref name="Filming" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FilmNewMexico" /&gt; with the [[working title]] ''Group Hug''.&lt;ref name="WorkingTitle" /&gt; In June 2011, stuntman Jeremy Fitzgerald injured his head while attempting a stunt involving a 30-foot fall from a building after getting hit by an arrow. A Marvel spokesperson later told [[TMZ (website)|TMZ.com]] that despite the injury, Fitzgerald recovered and continued working on set.&lt;ref name="TMZ" /&gt; The following month, [[second unit|secondary filming]] took place about an hour outside [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania in the [[Butler County, Pennsylvania|Butler area]].&lt;ref name="Vancheri" /&gt; A chase sequence was also shot in [[Worthington, Pennsylvania]] at Creekside Mushroom Farms, the world's largest single-site mushroom farm, which provided 150 miles of abandoned limestone tunnels 300 feet below the ground for filming.&lt;ref name="Vancheri2" /&gt;

Production relocated to Cleveland, Ohio in August 2011, where filming transpired over a period of four weeks. The city's East 9th Street was chosen as a double for New York City's [[42nd Street (Manhattan)|42nd Street]] to be used in climactic battle scenes.&lt;ref name="Sangiacomo" /&gt; [[United States Army Reserve|Army Reserve]] soldiers assigned to the [[Columbus, Ohio]]-based [[200th Military Police Command (United States)|391st Military Police Battalion]] provided background action during the battle scenes in Cleveland. Staff Sergeant Michael T. Landis stated the use of real soldiers made the scenes more realistic and helped portray the military in a more positive light, explaining that, "It's easy for us to make on-the-spot corrections to tactics and uniforms, the director actually took our recommendation on one scene and let us all engage the enemy as opposed to only the gunners in the trucks engaging".&lt;ref name="Army" /&gt; Filming also took place in the large [[vacuum chamber]] at the [[Glenn Research Center|NASA Plum Brook Station]] near [[Sandusky, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="Sandusky" /&gt; The station's [[Space Power Facility]] was used to portray a S.H.I.E.L.D. research facility.&lt;ref name="Sandusky2" /&gt; A series of explosions were filmed at the [[Chevrolet]] powertrain plant in [[Parma, Ohio]] as part of the battle sequence that began in Cleveland.&lt;ref name="Sangiacomo2" /&gt; Scenes from the film were also shot on [[Public Square, Cleveland|Public Square]] and the [[Detroit–Superior Bridge]].&lt;ref name="Sangiacomo3" /&gt; Public Square's southwest quadrant was turned into Stuttgart, Germany, for filming.&lt;ref name="Sangiacomo4" /&gt;

Principal photography concluded in New York City, where filming occurred over two days.&lt;ref name="Sangiacomo5" /&gt; Filming locations in New York City included [[Park Avenue]] and [[Central Park]].&lt;ref name="SuperheroHype5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyMail" /&gt; For scenes taking place in Manhattan, visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison shot aerial footage for over three days to use as background plates, elaborating that his main objective was to "get as much aerial work in as possible for the audience to see the big expanses, the wide establishing shots, while also making sure that the effects work doesn't look too computer generated".&lt;ref name="ARRI1" /&gt; "We're getting much better at making entirely computer-generated environments," Morrison explained, "but there is no substitute for starting with a real image and adding what you need."&lt;ref name="ARRI1" /&gt;

Cinematographer [[Seamus McGarvey]] stated that he composed the frame with a 1.85:1 [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] to cope with the varying heights of the main characters, explaining that "shooting 1.85:1 is kind of unusual for an epic film like this, but we needed the height in the screen to be able to frame in all the characters like Hulk, Captain America and Black Widow, who is much smaller. We had to give them all precedence and width within the frame. Also, Joss [Whedon] knew the final battle sequence was going to be this extravaganza in Manhattan, so the height and vertical scale of the buildings was going to be really important."&lt;ref name="ARRI2" /&gt; The film was McGarvey's first venture shooting with a digital camera, the [[Arri Alexa]].&lt;ref name="ARRI2" /&gt; The [[Canon EOS 5D Mark II]] and [[Canon EOS 7D]] [[digital single-lens reflex camera|digital SLR cameras]] were used for some shots,&lt;ref name="HollywoodReporter13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Canon7D" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Canon DSLRs" /&gt; and [[high-speed photography|high-speed]] shots were captured on [[35 mm film]] with the [[Arriflex 435]].&lt;ref name="ARRI2" /&gt; About his visual approach, McGarvey remarked, "Joss and I were keen on having a very visceral and naturalistic quality to the image. We wanted this to feel immersive and did not want a 'comic book look' that might distance an audience with the engagement of the film. We moved the camera a lot on Steadicam, cranes and on dollies to create kinetic images; and we chose angles that were dramatic, like low angles for heroic imagery."&lt;ref name="ARRI2" /&gt;

===Post-production===
In December 2011, Disney announced that the film would be [[2D to 3D conversion|converted]] to 3D.&lt;ref name="Deadline2" /&gt; Said Whedon, "I'm not a big fan of extreme long lens, talky movies – I like to see the space I'm in and relate to it, so 3D kinda fits my aesthetic anyway. And the technology has advanced so far in the past couple years." Whedon also said that "there definitely are movies that shouldn't be in 3D" but "''The Avengers'' isn't obnoxiously 3D. There's no, 'Oh look, we're going to spend 20 minutes going through this tunnel because it's in 3D!' And no one is pointing at the screen the entire time. But it's an action movie. Things tend to hurtle toward the screen anyway".&lt;ref name="Sampson" /&gt; In January 2012, it was reported that the film would be digitally remastered for [[IMAX 3D]] and open in IMAX theaters on May 4, 2012, the same day it opens in regular theaters. The film's IMAX release follows Marvel's IMAX releases of ''Iron Man 2'' and ''Thor''.&lt;ref name="IMAX" /&gt;

In a May 2012 interview, Whedon said that it was his decision to include Thanos in a post-credits scene, although the character is not identified in the film. "He for me is the most powerful and fascinating Marvel villain. He's the great grand daddy of the badasses and he's in love with [[Death (Marvel Comics)|Death]] and I just think that's so cute. For me, the greatest Avengers [comic book] was ''Avengers Annual'' #7 (1977) that [[Jim Starlin]] did followed by ''[[Marvel Two-in-One|Marvel Two-in-One Annual]]'' #2 (1977) that contained the death of [[Adam Warlock]]. Those were some of the most important texts and I think underrated milestones in Marvel history and Thanos is all over that, so somebody had to be in control and had to be behind Loki's work and I was like 'It's got to be Thanos.' And they said 'Okay' and I'm like 'Oh my God!'"&lt;ref name="Thanos" /&gt; An additional coda involving the Avengers eating shawarma was shot on April 12, 2012, a day after the world premiere. Evans wore a prosthetic jaw while filming the scene to cover the beard he had grown.&lt;ref name="EW post-credits"/&gt; Shawarma sales in Los Angeles, St. Louis, and Boston reportedly skyrocketed in the days following the film's release.&lt;ref name="Shawarma1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shawarma2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shawarma3"/&gt; Whedon stated the inspiration for the shawarma scene came from the events surrounding the filming of the scene where [[Winifred Burkle|Fred]] dies in [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce|Wesley]]'s arms in the ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' episode, "[[A Hole in the World]]". After filming the scene, Whedon and actors [[Amy Acker]] and Denisof, who portrayed Fred and Wesley, respectively, "went out for drinks and ended up just sitting around quietly, exhausted from the day's events," which Whedon then mimicked in the scene for the film.&lt;ref name="ShawarmaAngelInspiration" /&gt;

[[File:Hulk mocap.jpg|thumb|left|Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk (bottom) wearing a [[motion capture]] suit and prosthetics on his upper half to simulate the Hulk's size&lt;ref name="ScreenCrush"/&gt;]]
The film contains more than 2,200 visual effects shots completed by 14 companies: [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] (ILM), [[Weta Digital]], [[Scanline VFX]], [[Hydraulx]], Fuel VFX, Evil Eye Pictures, [[Luma Pictures]], Cantina Creative, Trixter, [[Modus FX]], Whiskytree, [[Digital Domain]], The Third Floor and Method Design. ILM was the lead vendor and shared responsibility for creating many of the film's key effects, including the Helicarrier, the New York cityscape, digital body doubles, Iron Man and the Hulk. To create the on-screen Hulk, Ruffalo performed in a motion-capture suit on set with the other actors while four motion-capture HD cameras (two full body, two focused on his face) captured his face and body movements.&lt;ref name="fxguide"/&gt; [[Jeff White (visual effects)|Jeff White]], ILM's visual effects supervisor, said, "We really wanted to utilize everything we've developed the last 10 years and make it a pretty spectacular Hulk. One of the great design decisions was to incorporate Mark Ruffalo into the look of him. So, much of Hulk is based on Ruffalo and his performance, not only in motion capture and on set, but down to his eyes, his teeth, and his tongue."&lt;ref name="AWN"/&gt;

ILM digitally recreated the vast majority of the New York cityscape used in the film. In total, ILM artists rendered an area of about ten city blocks by about four city blocks. To do this, ILM sent out a team of four photographers to take pictures of the area in a shoot that lasted 8 weeks.&lt;ref name="fxguide"/&gt; Tyson Bidner, the New York location manager on the film, helped by securing the rights to almost every building's likeness in the area ILM needed.&lt;ref name="ThrillistApril2018" /&gt; Disney and [[Sony Pictures]] agreed for [[Green Goblin|OsCorp]] Tower from ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' to be included in the film, but the idea was dropped because much of the skyline had already been completed.&lt;ref name="latino-review"/&gt;

Weta Digital took over duties for animating Iron Man during the forest duel from ILM. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, "We shared assets back and forth with ILM, but our pipelines are unique and it's hard for other assets to plug into it. But in this case, we got their models and we had to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different."&lt;ref name="AWN"/&gt; Williams said the most difficult part was re-creating Iron Man's reflective metal surfaces.&lt;ref name="fxguide"/&gt;

Scanline VFX completed the reveal shots of the Helicarrier, from the moment Black Widow and Captain America arrive on the carrier deck to the point where it lifts off. Evil Eye Pictures composited digital backgrounds into shots filmed against a greenscreen for scenes taking place inside the Helicarrier. Colin Strause of Hydraulx said, "We did the opening ten minutes of the movie, other than the opening set-up in space" including Loki's arrival on Earth and subsequent escape from the S.H.I.E.L.D. base. Luma Pictures worked on shots featuring the Helicarrier's bridge and incorporated the graphic monitor displays that were developed by Cantina Creative. Fuel VFX completed shots taking place in and around Tony Stark's penthouse at Stark Tower. Digital Domain created the asteroid environment, where Loki encounters The Other.&lt;ref name="fxguide"/&gt; Method Design in Los Angeles created the film's closing credits. Steve Viola, creative director at Method Design, said, "This piece was a two-minute, self-contained main on end sequence created entirely in CG. For each of the shots in the sequence, we designed, modeled, textured, and lit all of the environments and many of the foreground objects. We received assets from Marvel to include in the piece, then heavily re-modeled and re-surfaced them to create a post-battle macro sequence. We also designed a custom typeface for the Main Title of ''The Avengers'' as well as 30 credits set in-scene."&lt;ref name="AWN"/&gt;

{{further|The Avengers (soundtrack)|Music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe}}

In November 2011, Marvel announced that [[Alan Silvestri]], who [[Film score|scored]] ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', would write and compose the score for ''The Avengers''. Silvestri said, "I've worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world and it's a very different situation. It's very challenging to look for a way to give everyone the weight and consideration they need, but at the same time the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together."&lt;ref name="Silvestri" /&gt; Silvestri developed the score with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, England.&lt;ref name="SXSW1" /&gt; Whedon said, "The score is very old-fashioned, which is why [Silvestri] was letter-perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion, the &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Hans Zimmer]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; school of 'I'm just feeling a lot right now!' but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love."&lt;ref name="SXSW1" /&gt;

In March 2012, American [[alternative rock]] band [[Soundgarden]] announced through its Facebook page that its song "[[Live to Rise]]" would be included on the film's soundtrack.&lt;ref name="Soundgarden" /&gt; Additionally, the Indian rock band [[Agnee (band)|Agnee]] released a music video for its single "Hello Andheron", which serves as the theme song for the film's Indian release.&lt;ref name="Agnee" /&gt; [[Hollywood Records]] released the soundtrack [[concept album]] inspired by the film, ''Avengers Assemble'', on May 1, 2012, the same day as the score.&lt;ref name="Soundtrack" /&gt;

==Marketing==
===Trailers===
The film was promoted at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, during which a teaser trailer narrated by Samuel L. Jackson was shown followed by an introduction of the cast.&lt;ref name="Gregg"/&gt; In June 2011, Marvel Studios announced that it would not hold a panel at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con International after studio executives decided it was not prepared to compete with its own past and fan expectations with filming still in production.&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt; In July 2011, a teaser trailer that was meant to be the post-credits scene of ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' was briefly leaked online. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' speculated it came from a preview screening and described the footage as "shaky, fuzzy, flickering and obviously filmed on a cell phone".&lt;ref name="EW3"/&gt;

[[File:20111015 NYCC-6.jpg|thumb|left|Chris Evans, Tom Hiddleston, Cobie Smulders, and Clark Gregg promoting the film at the 2011 [[New York Comic Con]]]]
In August 2011, [[Walt Disney Pictures]], [[Pixar Animation Studios]] and Marvel Studios presented a look at [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|Walt Disney Studios]]' upcoming film slate, which included ''The Avengers'', at the [[D23 Expo]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. The presentation featured footage from the film and appearances by the cast members.&lt;ref name="D23" /&gt; Later in August, Disney dismissed Marvel's executive vice president of worldwide marketing, vice president of worldwide marketing and manager of worldwide marketing to bring their functions in-house.&lt;ref name="Deadline" /&gt;

In October 2011, Marvel Studios held a presentation at the [[New York Comic Con]] that featured new footage and a panel discussion including producer Kevin Feige and several cast members.&lt;ref name="NYCC" /&gt; The first full-length trailer was also released in October. ''[[Comic Book Resources]]'' said, "The two-minute teaser handily establishes the movie's premise" and is "heavy on the assembling, but fans are also treated to plenty of action, as well glimpses {{sic}} of Iron Man's new armor and, best of all, the new take on the Incredible Hulk. Naturally, Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark gets the best lines".&lt;ref name="CBR" /&gt; However, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' called it, "Awesome. Or it would be if we hadn't seen all of this before and expected every single thing that we saw in the trailer".&lt;ref name="HollywoodReporter6" /&gt; The trailer, which debuted exclusively on [[iTunes|iTunes Movie Trailers]], was downloaded over 10&amp;nbsp;million times in its first 24 hours, breaking the website's record for the most-viewed trailer.&lt;ref name="BusinessWire" /&gt; This record was surpassed by the trailer for ''[[The Dark Knight Rises]]'', which was downloaded more than 12.5&amp;nbsp;million times in its first 24 hours.&lt;ref name="MarketWatch" /&gt; The trailer received 20.4 million views in the 24 hours after it debuted.&lt;ref name="TrailerViews" /&gt; A second full-length trailer was released on iTunes in February 2012, reaching a record 13.7&amp;nbsp;million downloads in 24 hours.&lt;ref name="NYDailyNews" /&gt; The theatrical trailers of ''The Avengers'' appeared with many films, including ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol]]'', ''[[21 Jump Street (film)|21 Jump Street]]'' and ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]''.&lt;ref name="Deadline5" /&gt;

In January 2012, Marvel Studios held a global Twitter chat. The 30-minute live tweeting event featured writer/director Joss Whedon, cast members Samuel L. Jackson, Tom Hiddleston and Clark Gregg and a 10-second tease of the 30-second [[Super Bowl]] commercial that would air during [[Super Bowl XLVI]] in February.&lt;ref name="Marvel2" /&gt; According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Disney paid an estimated $4&amp;nbsp;million for the 30-second spot.&lt;ref name="Fritz" /&gt; On May 1, 2012, executives from Marvel Studios, along with actors Tom Hiddleston and Clark Gregg, rang the opening bell of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in honor of the film's theatrical release.&lt;ref name="NYSE" /&gt;

===Tie-in comics===
{{further|Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics}}
In December 2011, Marvel announced that an eight-issue comic-book prelude to the film, written by [[Christopher Yost]] and Eric Pearson with art by [[Luke Ross]] and Daniel HDR, would be released in March 2012.&lt;ref name="Marvel1" /&gt; In February 2012, Marvel announced the release of a second limited series comic book tie-in, ''Black Widow Strikes'' written by [[Fred Van Lente]], who wrote ''Captain America: First Vengeance'', the comic-book prequel to ''Captain America: The First Avenger''. The story is set between ''Iron Man 2'' and ''The Avengers'' and follows Black Widow as she runs down some loose ends from ''Iron Man 2''.&lt;ref name="Marvel3" /&gt; Additionally, the title ''Avengers Assemble'' was launched in March 2012, written by Brian Michael Bendis with art by [[Mark Bagley]] and features the same Avengers line-up as the film battling a new incarnation of the supervillain team [[Zodiac (comics)|Zodiac]].&lt;ref name="Schedeen" /&gt;

Paul Gitter, [[Marvel Entertainment]]'s president of consumer products, commented that the build-up to the film helped strengthen retail partnerships: "Retailers have been less tolerant with [intellectual property] films, so we decided that if we started on this coordinated strategy several years ago, retailers would give us shelf space throughout the years and we would have a more sustainable position in the marketplace".&lt;ref name="Lisanti" /&gt;

In September 2011, set photos of Robert Downey Jr. driving a new model [[Acura]] were published online. An Acura spokesperson later released a statement confirming the company's involvement with the film, "As you may know, Acura has been in the Marvel Comics Universe films as the official car of their fictional law enforcement agency called S.H.I.E.L.D. That relationship continues for ''The Avengers''. The open-top sports car that was photographed yesterday is a one-off, fictional car that was made just for the movie and will not be produced. That said, as you may also know, our CEO has said publicly that we are studying the development of a new sportscar, but we can't say any more about it at this time."&lt;ref name="Nunez" /&gt; In December 2011, Acura announced that a new [[Honda NSX|NSX]] styled along the lines of the [[Concept car|concept]] built for ''The Avengers'' would be unveiled at the 2012 [[North American International Auto Show]].&lt;ref name="Vijayenthiran" /&gt; A series of 10 S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s, based on the [[Acura MDX]] with modifications by Cinema Vehicle Services, were also made for the film.&lt;ref name="MDX" /&gt;

In February 2012, it was announced that Marvel has partnered with fragrance company JADS to promote ''The Avengers'' with character-based fragrances. The announcement was just ahead of the [[Toy Industry Association]]'s annual February exhibition, where representatives held a sampling booth of the products.&lt;ref name="JADS" /&gt; Other promotional partners include bracelet-maker Colantotte, [[Dr Pepper]], [[Farmers Insurance Group|Farmers Insurance]], [[Harley-Davidson]], [[The Hershey Company|Hershey]], Land O'Frost [[Cold cut|lunchmeats]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Schwan Food Company#Red Baron Squadron|Red Baron pizza]], [[Symantec]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[Wyndham Hotels &amp; Resorts]]. In total, Marvel and its parent-company Disney secured an estimated $100&amp;nbsp;million in worldwide marketing support for the film. Notable exclusions include [[Baskin-Robbins]], [[Burger King]] and [[Dunkin' Donuts]], who had partnered with Marvel in the past when their films were distributed by Paramount; Disney does not generally promote through [[fast food]] outlets.&lt;ref name="Variety5" /&gt;

===Video game===
A [[The Avengers (video game)|video game based on the film]] was planned for concurrent release. The game was to be a [[first-person shooter]]/[[Beat 'em up|brawler]] for the [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Wii U]], and [[Microsoft Windows]] and published by [[THQ]], with [[THQ Studio Australia]] developing the console versions and [[Blue Tongue Entertainment]] the [[Personal computer|PC]] version. After THQ closed both studios, the game was cancelled.&lt;ref name="Lien" /&gt; Intellectual property rights for an Avengers video game reverted to Marvel, which said it was exploring potential publishing and licensing opportunities.&lt;ref name="Sinclair" /&gt;

In May 2012, [[Ubisoft]] and Marvel Entertainment announced that they were partnering to develop a motion-controlled game titled ''[[Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth]]'' for the Wii U and Xbox 360 [[Kinect]]. The game was inspired by the "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline and features 20 different characters.&lt;ref name="BfE" /&gt; Marvel also announced a four-chapter [[mobile game]] titled ''Avengers Initiative'', with one chapter focusing on each of Hulk, Captain America, Thor and Iron Man.&lt;ref name="MobileGame" /&gt;

==Release==
===Theatrical===
[[File:Fans at Avengers premiere.jpg|thumb|Fans at the film's world premiere, outside Hollywood's [[El Capitan Theatre]]]]
In February 2012, Disney announced that the film's title would be changed in the United Kingdom to avoid confusion with the [[The Avengers (TV series)|British TV series of the same name]], as well as its [[The Avengers (1998 film)|1998 film adaptation]]. This led to confusion over the film's actual title. ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine reported that the film would be titled ''Marvel Avengers Assemble''&lt;ref name="AvengersAssemble2"/&gt; while ''The Hollywood Reporter'' said that it would be called simply ''Avengers Assemble''.&lt;ref name="AvengersAssemble"/&gt; Marvel's UK website refers to the film as ''Marvel's Avengers Assemble'',&lt;ref name="MarvelUK"/&gt; although David Cox of ''[[The Guardian]]'', in arguing that it was one of the worst film titles ever, considered this to be an error in the production notes, albeit grammatically clearer.&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt; According to the [[British Board of Film Classification]] and the [[Irish Film Classification Office]], the title is ''Marvel Avengers Assemble''.&lt;ref name="BBFC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IFCO"/&gt; [[Frank Lovece]] in FilmFestivalTraveler.com addressed the discrepancy, writing, "''The Avengers'' — formally titled ''Marvel's The Avengers'' onscreen, though no apostrophe-s appears on the posters..."&lt;ref name="filmfestivaltraveler" /&gt; Producer Kevin Feige said there are only two words in the UK title, one more than in the U.S. title, and stated that "decisions like that aren't made lightly and there are lots of marketing research, lawyers and things that get into the mix on it".&lt;ref name="digitalspy"/&gt;

The film's world premiere was April 11, 2012, at Hollywood's [[El Capitan Theatre]].&lt;ref name="premiere"/&gt; ''The Avengers'' closed the 11th Annual [[Tribeca Film Festival]] with a screening on April 28, 2012.&lt;ref name="Tribeca"/&gt; The film received an expanded one-week theatrical push for the 2012 U.S. [[Labor Day]] weekend, increasing the number of theaters from 123 to 1,700.&lt;ref name="LaborDayPush"/&gt;

===Home media===
The film was released by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment]]&lt;ref name="HM Magazine1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bluray6" /&gt; on [[Blu-ray Disc]], [[Blu-ray 3D]], [[DVD]] and [[Digital copy|digital download]] on September 25, 2012 in the United States and as early as August 29, 2012 in various international markets.&lt;ref name="Bluray" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bluray5" /&gt; Producer Kevin Feige said the Blu-ray features a new [[Marvel One-Shots|Marvel One-Shot]] titled ''[[Item 47]]'' and "a number of deleted scenes and a few storylines that fell by the wayside during the editing process" including "a few more scenes with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill, played by Cobie Smulders" and "some slightly different versions of Maria Hill and Nick Fury's interaction with the World Security Council".&lt;ref name="Bluray3" /&gt;

The film was also collected in a 10-disc [[box set]] titled "[[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Home Media|Marvel Cinematic Universe: Phase One – Avengers Assembled]]" which includes all of the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase One|Phase One]] films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.&lt;ref name="Bluray2" /&gt; It was released on April 2, 2013.&lt;ref name="Bluray4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boxset release" /&gt; Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment will release the film on [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]] on August 14, 2018.&lt;ref name="UltraHDRelease" /&gt;

Some fans have criticized the UK DVD and Blu-ray release for omitting Joss Whedon's audio commentary, and for altering the scene involving Phil Coulson's death from the film's theatrical version.&lt;ref name="UKBluray" /&gt; Disney's UK division said the "less graphic depiction of Agent Coulson's confrontation with Loki" occurred because "[e]ach country has its own compliance issues relative to depictions of violence. Unfortunately, another region's elements were inadvertently used to create the UK in-home release".&lt;ref name="UKBluray" /&gt;

Upon its first week of release on home media in the U.S., the film topped the Nielsen VideoScan First Alert chart, which tracks overall disc sales, as well as the dedicated Blu-ray Disc sales chart with 72% of unit sales coming from Blu-ray, a record for a new release in which both the DVD and Blu-ray formats were released simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Bluray6" /&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office===
''The Avengers'' grossed $623.4 million in the United States and Canada and $895.5 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $1.519 billion.&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt; It became the [[List of highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film worldwide]]&lt;ref name="third highest news" /&gt; as well as the [[2012 in film|highest-grossing 2012 film]], the highest-grossing [[Comic book|comic-book]] adaptation, the highest-grossing [[superhero film]] and the highest-grossing film ever released by Walt Disney Studios, at the time of its release.&lt;ref name="highest-Disney" /&gt; The film's worldwide opening of $392.5&amp;nbsp;million was the fourth-largest.&lt;ref name="world-open" /&gt; ''The Avengers'' also became the fifth film distributed by [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|Disney]] and the twelfth film overall to earn more than $1&amp;nbsp;billion.

[[File:Mark Ruffalo at the Toronto premiere of The Avengers.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mark Ruffalo]] at the film's Toronto premiere. Ruffalo's performance was critically lauded.]]
The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 92% approval rating with an average rating of 8/10 based on 338 reviews. The website's consensus reads, "Thanks to a script that emphasizes its heroes' humanity and a wealth of superpowered set pieces, ''The Avengers'' lives up to its hype and raises the bar for Marvel at the movies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marvel's The Avengers (2012)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/marvels_the_avengers/|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film achieved an average score of 69 out of 100 based on 43 reviews, signifying &lt;!-- CITED TERMINOLOGY, DO NOT CHANGE! --&gt;"generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="Metacritic" /&gt; [[CinemaScore]] reported that audiences gave the film a rare "A+" grade, the first superhero film to earn that grade.&lt;ref name="Crit1" /&gt;

[[Todd McCarthy]] of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' gave a positive review of the film, remarking, "It's clamorous, the save-the-world story is one everyone's seen time and again, and the characters have been around for more than half a century in 500 comic book issues. But Whedon and his cohorts have managed to stir all the personalities and ingredients together so that the resulting dish, however familiar, is irresistibly tasty again."&lt;ref name="HollywoodReporter9" /&gt; To ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' journalist [[Peter Travers]], the film epitomized an exceptional blockbuster. "It's also the blockbuster," Travers said, "I saw in my head when I imagined a movie that brought together the idols of the Marvel world in one shiny, stupendously exciting package. It's ''Transformers'' with a brain, a heart and a working sense of humor."&lt;ref name="rollz" /&gt; Justin Chang of ''Variety'' wrote, "Like a superior, state-of-the-art model built from reconstituted parts, Joss Whedon's buoyant, witty and robustly entertaining superhero smash-up is escapism of a sophisticated order, boasting a tonal assurance and rich reserves of humor that offset the potentially lumbering and unavoidably formulaic aspects of this 143-minute team-origin story."&lt;ref name="Variety6" /&gt; [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''Los Angeles Times'' complimented the film's frenetic pace,&lt;ref name="LATimes2" /&gt; while [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' commented that it "provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable".&lt;ref name="Ebert" /&gt; Conversely, [[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' believed that "while ''The Avengers'' is hardly worth raging about, its failures are significant and dispiriting. The light, amusing bits cannot overcome the grinding, hectic emptiness, the bloated cynicism that is less a shortcoming of this particular film than a feature of the genre."&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt;

The performances of several cast members was a frequent topic in the critiques. In particular, Mark Ruffalo's portrayal of Dr. Bruce Banner/the Hulk was well received by commentators. Joe Neumaier opined that his performance was superior to the rest of the cast; "Ruffalo is the revelation, turning Banner into a wry reservoir of calm ready to become a volcano."&lt;ref name="nydaily" /&gt; Similarly, ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'s}} [[Anthony Lane]] proclaimed Ruffalo's acting to be one of the film's highlights—alongside Downey.&lt;ref name="newyorker" /&gt; ''[[The Village Voice]]''{{'s}} [[Karina Longworth]] concluded: "Ruffalo successfully refreshes the Hulk myth, playing Banner as an adorably bashful nerd-genius who, in contrast to the preening hunks on the team, knows better than to draw attention to himself."&lt;ref name="villagevoice" /&gt; Travers asserted that the actor resonated a "scruffy warmth and humor" vibe,&lt;ref name="rollz" /&gt; while Turan felt that he surpassed predecessors Edward Norton and [[Eric Bana]] in playing the character.&lt;ref name="LATimes2" /&gt; Owen Gleiberman of ''Entertainment Weekly'' wrote that "the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mark Ruffalo to play Bruce Banner as a man so sensitive that he's at war, every moment, with himself. (The film finally solves the Hulk problem: He's a lot more fun in small doses.)"&lt;ref name="EW-review" /&gt;

Referring to Downey, Joe Morgenstein of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''—despite complimenting Downey's performance—favored his work in ''Iron Man'' over his acting in ''The Avengers'': "His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication—the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world—and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony."&lt;ref name="wsj22" /&gt; Neumaier praised Evans, stating that he accurately conveyed his character's internal conflicts.&lt;ref name="nydaily" /&gt;

Commentators appreciated the character development and dialogue. [[Associated Press]] reviewer [[Christy Lemire]] wrote that the script "sparkles as brightly as the special effects; these people may be wearing ridiculous costumes but they're well fleshed-out underneath."&lt;ref name="associatedpress" /&gt; Scott suggested that certain parts of the film permeated a charm that he felt was similar to the western film ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959).&lt;ref name="nytimes" /&gt; Longworth felt that while Whedon's script demonstrated the backstory of the characters, the film does not explore it "in a substantive way".&lt;ref name="villagevoice" /&gt;

'''Tâb''' is the [[Egypt]]ian name of a [[Running-fight game|running-fight]] [[board game]] played in several [[Muslim]] (mostly [[Arab]]) countries, and a family of similar board games played in [[North Africa]] (as ''sîg'') and [[Western Asia]], from [[Iran]] to [[West Africa]] and from [[Turkey]] to [[Somalia]], where a variant called ''deleb'' is played. The rules and boards can vary widely across the region though almost all consist of boards with three or four rows. A reference to "at-tâb wa-d-dukk" (likely a similar game) occurs in a poem of 1310 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Depaulis "Jeux" 2001, p 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game described here was recorded by [[Edward William Lane]] in Egypt in the 1820s. 

Egyptian tâb is played by two players on a board, often delineated at the ground. The board is four squares wide, and usually an odd number of squares long, usually from 7 to 15, but formerly up to 29 squares. Numbering the four rows 1, 2, 3 and 4, from the start one player has one (nominally) white piece in each field of row 1, and the other a (nominally) black piece in each field of row 4. The pieces may be stones or made from burnt clay. In Egypt, the pieces are referred to as ''kelb'', meaning ''dog''.

As in the [[Ancient Egypt]]ian game [[senet]] and the [[Korea]]n game [[Yut]], four sticks of a roughly semi-circular cross-section are used as dice. The flat sides are (nominally) white, and the rounded sides are (nominally) black. The value of a throw depends on the number of black and white sides showing, as indicated in the following table.&lt;ref&gt;Lane 1860, p 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! White up
| 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4
|- 
! Move
| 6 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4
|-
! Extra throw
| Yes || Yes || No || No || Yes
|-
! Name
| Sitteh || '''Tâb''' || Itneyn || Teláteh || Arba'ah
|-
! Approx. prop.&lt;ref&gt;The approximate probabilities shown are based on the assumption that the black and white sides have equal probabilities, which typically is correct to within a few percent.&lt;/ref&gt;
| 6% || 25% || 38% || 25% || 6%
|}

For each piece, the first move must be a tâb, which converts the piece from a ''Christian'' to a ''Muslim'' in addition to moving it one field ahead. Typically all initial tâbs are used to convert pieces, and only later are tâbs used for other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Lane 1860, p 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tab_schematic.svg|thumb|right|360px|Tâb board, showing paths for one player. Blue = standard path; Orange = path available under certain restrictions; Dotted = choice of paths.]]

The pieces move as shown in the diagram, here shown for "White" starting in its home row A-I. The other player ("Black" starting in home row ''a-i'') moves in the same way, meaning that black and white pieces move in the same direction through each of the rows. When a white piece gets to square ''s'', White can choose to send the piece to ''a'' or back to K. However, a given piece can only go into its opponent's home row (for White, ''a-i'') once; the next time it must go back to K, thereafter merely circulating through the 2 middle rows. Once in its opponent's home row, a piece cannot move any further as long as there are any pieces left in its own home row. No piece ever returns to its own home row.

A piece moving to a square occupied by one or more enemy pieces will knock those pieces off the board. A piece moving to a square occupied by one or more friendly pieces is placed on top of those, and they move as one piece thereafter. If such a stack moves to a row where one of the pieces has been before, the stack is reduced to just one piece, the other pieces being removed from the board. However, the player is not required to utilize a throw leading to such move. A tâb throw can be used to break up a stack so that the pieces move individually again.

The game continues till one player has lost all pieces, whereby the other player wins.

A game position is not given by the position of all pieces only, but also by their pre-history, substantially complicating the game.

[[File:Rock Challenge.jpg|right|thumb|Rock Challenge Logo]]
The '''UK Rock Challenge''' is the British arm of the [[Rock Eisteddfod Challenge|Global Rock Challenge]]. The Rock Challenge is an anti-drug and crime-prevention that takes the form of a friendly performing arts competition for schools and colleges. Originating in Australia in the 1980s, it reached UK shores due to Inspector Mark Pontin of the Hampshire Constabulary seeing it in 1995 and being so impressed that he persuaded the Chief Constable of Hampshire Constabulary to form a joint venture with Tony Barron, Chairman of Hampshire Education Committee and Peter Coles the Chief Executive , Together they  introduced it into their area of the UK and found joint funding to do so. The first UK event took place in Portsmouth Guildhall, Portsmouth in 1996 involving 11 schools and around 750 young people; since then, Rock Challenge has expanded into many areas across the UK; in 2016 there are 49 days of events.

All the events in the UK are funded by the Be Your Best Foundation (Registered Charity Number 1077291&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1077291&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0&lt;/ref&gt;), a non-profit charity set up by the creators of the Rock Challenge in the UK who source funding for the events across the UK.'

==The Event==

The premise of the Rock Challenge is that each school puts together an 8-minute dance and drama production on a theme of their choice set to a soundtrack of commercially available music. Over the course of months/weeks schools create their production and finally bring it to an event day held at a professional venue where they spend the day rehearsing and preparing for an evening show where parents, peers, community members, and invited guests attend. During the evening, a panel of judges give verbal feedback on each performance and also score each piece based on strict criteria. Performances are judged on:

'''Performance Judge'''
Marks:
* Choreography (out of 10)
* Performance Skill (out of 10)
* Soundtrack (out of 10)

'''Production Judge'''
Marks:
* Hair and Make-up (out of 10)
* Costume (out of 10)
* Lighting (out of 10)

'''Drama and Design Judge'''
Marks:
* Drama (out of 10)
* Set Design and Function (out of 10)
* Concept (out of 10)

Each judge also gives the performance a mark for 'Overall Impact' out of 5.

At the end of the evening a prize ceremony is held where a number of awards are presented along with the announcement of the top-scoring schools.

==The Rock Challenge message==

The core message of the Be Your Best Rock Challenge is to show young people how they can achieve a 'natural high' on life rather than with the use of drugs, alcohol and tobacco - the concept is that through participation in the event at a professional venue with a professional production and technical crew, the students are helped in the belief that they can achieve a high on life rather than relying on substances. This is emphasised during the event where everyone is warned that if anyone is caught smoking, taking drugs or drinking alcohol the individual/s concerned will be asked to leave and their team will be deducted two overall ranking places (making it impossible for them to win or go further in  the competition).

Participation in the Rock Challenge has shown to have many positive effects on participants, schools, and communities, including:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockchallenge.co.uk/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=PagEd&amp;file=index&amp;topic_id=1&amp;page_id=4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose Grunstein, Don Nutbeam, (2007) "The impact of participation in the Rock Eisteddfod Challenge on adolescent resiliency and health behaviours", Health Education, Vol. 107 Iss: 3, pp.261 - 275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, S., Salmon, D., Orme, J., Jones, M. and Kimberlee, R.

==Concept, history and Australian origins==

'''Rock Challenge''' has been running in the UK since 1996 (see above) and has been running as the [[Rock Eisteddfod Challenge]] in Australia since 1980 (see History in [[Rock Eisteddfod Challenge]] page) and has reached out across the world to [[New Zealand]] (Stage Challenge), [[Japan]] (Rock Challenge Japan), [[Germany]], [[South Africa]] (ARA Be Your Best&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; Rock Challenge) and [[UAE]] (set up by the British Be Your Best Rock Challenge). Rock Challenge also had a short and small stay in the US, but there has been no known activity since the confirmation of two events for 2004.

Just like in the UK, since its inception in [[Australia]] the events have grown in popularity, so much that the National Finals are shown on the [[Nine Network]] over a period of weeks on a Saturday Morning (after being previously recorded live). This television coverage has been happening since the early 1990s, but since the UK launch in 1996 it still does not have any major media coverage there.

The most famous participant of Rock Challenge in the UK was the actress Emma Watson from the Harry Potter franchise. She participated twice, once in 2006 and once as the Rock Challenge leader in 2007 with her school in Oxford.

==Competition format==

Rock Challenge is split into 2 age brackets:

'''Junior Rock Challenge'''
The Junior Rock Challenge started in the UK in 2005 for participants aged 7–11. Many Junior Rock Challenges events are not full competitions based on the desires of the local schools and sponsors.

'''Rock Challenge'''
Rock Challenge is for participants aged 11–18. As of 2004, Rock Challenge has been split into 2 competition divisions; the Open and the Premier divisions: 
In the 'Open' Division:
* Open Division schools take part in heats across the country. Schools that win their heat (plus many that place 2nd) progress to the Regional Open Grand Final (North or South depending on the heat location).
* Due to the increasing number of teams entering, there are 2 Open Grand Finals ('A' and 'B') for each region
* In most cases each Open Grand Final winner (and one of the schools that places second) is promoted to the Premier Division for the following year (if one of the Premier Division schools chooses not to participate in any given year, their Premier Final space may be awarded to the other school that places 2nd at the Open Grand Final or possibly the school that placed 3rd behind the 2nd place promoted school).
* Throughout the heats and finals, schools also compete for awards which merit the teams' performances in certain aspects of the piece - these range from hair and make up to video performance.

In the 'Premier' Division:
* In each region there are 12 Premier Division schools in any given year.
* In the majority of cases, Premier schools are required to showcase their performance before competing at the Regional Premier Grand Final.
* Premier schools compete against each other in the region's Premier Grand Final where they will compete for ranking places and awards (as per the Open Division).
* To remain in the Premier Division, schools are required to place in the top nine at the Regional Final, which, added together with the winners and runners-up from the Open Grand Finals, gives you the Premier Schools for the following year.

From 2007, National Awards have also been awarded, judged nationally by a panel of judges new and independent from those at the live events, announcing each division's top schools in each criteria.

'''Scottish Grand Final'''
As of 2012, schools participating in Scottish events will compete at heats for a place in the Scottish Grand Final held in Dundee. Should a school win the Scottish Grand Final two years in succession they will be given the option of competing in the Northern Region Premier Division for the following year. Should a school win the Scottish Grand Final three years in succession they will be automatically moved into the Northern Region Premier Grand Final for the following year.

'''National Grand Final'''
In 2009 the UK's first National Grand Final was held at the Sheffield Arena. This consisted of the top 5 schools from each Premier Final along with the top scoring first place from the Open finals (one from the North and one from the South) giving twelve schools: Sandown High School from Sandown, Isle of Wight won this event with their performance 'Cursed' after winning their Open Grand Final.

In 2012 the second UK Rock Challenge National Grand Final was held at the Milton Keynes Theatre, Milton Keynes: Kings Langley School, Hertfordshire won this event with their performance entitled 'Swift as a shadow short as any dream.'.

==Events and venues==

Since 1996, the Tour has been to many venues around the country and as Rock Challenge has become larger, so have the venues. Even just in the first year it grew from one night and one event to 8 venues and 11 nights.

With the planned National Grand Final, it would bring the biggest ever venue ever used by the Rock Challenge team in the UK, The [[Sheffield Arena]] with a capacity up to 12,500 seated (downgraded to 4000 seats for Final).

As of 2012 the events will have taken place in the following towns/cities across the UK:

•	Aberdeen
•	Arbroath
•	Basingstoke
•      Belfast
•	Bournemouth
•	Bradford

==Sponsors==

The Be Your Best Foundation is always looking for sponsorship, because they are a charity and this sponsor helps to put on the events. There is a wide range of sponsors, but not as internationally known as the Australian sponsorship is (like [[Calvin Klein]] for one). In certain areas where the Rock Challenge is there is major backing and sponsorship from the local police force (partly because the introduction to the UK was with the backing of the Hampshire Constabulary). [[The One Network]] Radio stations like [[2CR FM|Heart FM]](formerly known as 2CR FM), [[Heart Sussex|Southern FM]], [[Chiltern Radio]] are also sponsors in their area and this way the Rock Challenge also some times use local presenters from the Radio Stations. Other Radio stations which are not owned by The One Network are also used for sponsorship (for example both from the [[Yorkshire Radio Network]]: [[The Pulse of West Yorkshire|The Pulse]] &amp; [[Viking FM]]; Independently owned Lincolnshire based [[Lincs FM]] and finally Belfast's [[Downtown Radio]]).
Other campaigns for good health, to tackle drugs &amp; alcohol and to promote a better community also appear in the sponsorship. Just like the Police forces in Rock Challenge tour areas, all the local city and borough councils promote the Rock Challenge (but in the London area there is no definitive sponsorship or backing from the Police or city council).
For the Finals, the sponsorship changes slightly because all the finals are presented by the insurance company [[Ansvar insurance]] (which ironically has an Australian parent company) which is a company which helps non-profit organizations and individuals like Charities, helping by investing in certain organizations which work firstly and foremostly in alcohol and drug education ([http://www.ansvar.co.uk/ Ansvar Insurance (UK) Website]).
In the early announcements over the 2009 national finals&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalrockchallenge.com/uk/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=PagEd&amp;file=index&amp;topic_id=6&amp;page_id=8&lt;/ref&gt; it has been said that the success of the event is down highly to the sponsorship gained, to help the staging of the biggest event yet.

'''Verse drama''' is any [[drama]] written as [[poetry|verse]] to be spoken; another possible general term is '''poetic drama'''.  For a very long period, verse drama was the dominant form of drama in [[Europe]] (and was also important in non-European cultures).  [[Greek tragedy]] and [[Jean Racine|Racine]]'s plays are written in verse, as is almost all of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s drama, [[Ben Jonson]], [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and others like [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Faust (Goethe)|Faust]]''.

Verse drama is particularly associated with the seriousness of [[tragedy]], providing an artistic reason to write in this form, as well as the practical one that verse lines are easier for the actors to memorize exactly. In the second half of the twentieth century verse drama fell almost completely out of fashion with dramatists writing in English (the plays of [[Christopher Fry]] and [[T. S. Eliot]] being possibly the end of a long tradition).

==Dramatic verse==
'''Dramatic verse''' occurs in a dramatic work, such as a [[Play (theatre)|play]], composed in poetic form.  The tradition of dramatic verse extends at least as far back as [[ancient Greece]].

The [[English Renaissance]] saw the height of dramatic verse in the English-speaking world, with playwrights such as [[Ben Jonson]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[William Shakespeare]] developing new techniques, both for dramatic structure and poetic form.  Though a few plays, such as ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', feature extended passages of rhymed verse, the majority of dramatic verse is composed as [[blank verse]]; there are also passages of prose.

Dramatic verse began to decline in popularity in the nineteenth century, when the prosaic and conversational styles of playwrights such as [[Henrik Ibsen]] became more prevalent, and were adapted in English by [[George Bernard Shaw]]. Verse drama did have a role in the development of [[Irish theatre]].

==Closet drama==
{{main|closet drama}}
An important trend from around 1800 was the [[closet drama]]: a verse drama intended to be read from the page, rather than performed. [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]], as well as a host of lesser figures, devoted much time to the closet drama, in a signal that the verse tragedy was already in a state of obsolescence. That is, while poets of the eighteenth century could write so-so poetic dramas, the public taste for new examples was already moving away by the start of the nineteenth century, and there was little commercial appeal in staging them.

Instead, [[opera]] would take up verse drama, as something to be sung: it is still the case that a verse [[libretto]] can be successful. Verse drama as such, however, in becoming closet drama, became simply a longer poetic form, without the connection to practical theatre and performance. 

According to [[Robertson Davies]] in ''[[A Voice From the Attic]]'', closet drama is "''Dreariest of literature, most second hand and fusty of experience!''". But indeed a great deal of it was written in [[Victorian era|Victorian times]], and afterwards, to the extent that it became a more popular long form at least than the faded [[Epic poetry|epic]]. Prolific in the form were, for example, [[Michael Field (pseudonym)|Michael Field]] and [[Gordon Bottomley]].

==Dramatic poetry in general==
'''Dramatic poetry''' is any poetry that uses the discourse of the characters involved to tell a story or portray a situation. 

The major types of dramatic poetry are those already discussed, to be found in plays written for the theatre, and [[libretti]]. There are further dramatic verse forms: these include [[dramatic monologue]]s, such as those written by [[Robert Browning]] and [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] and [[William Shakespeare]].
