'''''4 for Texas''''' is a 1963 American [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[comedy]] film starring [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Anita Ekberg]], and [[Ursula Andress]], and featuring screen thugs [[Charles Bronson]] and [[Mike Mazurki]], with a cameo appearance by [[Arthur Godfrey]] and the [[Three Stooges]] ([[Larry Fine (actor)|Larry Fine]], [[Moe Howard]], and [[Joe DeRita|Curly Joe DeRita]]). The film was written by Teddi Sherman and [[Robert Aldrich]], who also directed.

== Plot ==
In 1870, a shipment of $100,000 being transported by stagecoach to [[Galveston]], [[Texas]], is the object of a tug-of-war in the desert between Zack Thomas (Sinatra) and Joe Jarrett (Martin), who first must stave off an outlaw band led by Matson (Bronson).

Later, in Galveston, Thomas and Jarrett become rivals in a bid to open a waterfront casino. Each has a new romantic attachment, as well, with the beauties Elya (Anita Ekberg) and Maxine (Ursula Andress), respectively. They eventually must join forces to hold off the villainous Matson and a corrupt banker, Burden ([[Victor Buono]]), to keep their new gambling boat afloat.

==Production==
Adlrich announced the film in November 1960 as ''Two for Texas'', from a script by Teddy Sherman. The proposed stars were [[Lisa Kirk]], [[Martine Carol]] and [[Aldo Ray]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott, J. L. (1960, Nov 01). Texas yarns follow in wake of 'alamo'. Los Angeles Times &lt;/ref&gt; 

In January 1963 Dean Martin signed to make the film. At that stage his female co-stars would be [[Anita Ekberg]] and (it was hoped) [[Gina Lollobrigida]].&lt;ref&gt;Lemmon May Be Candidate for an Oscar

Scheuer, Philip K. Los Angeles Times 3 Jan 1963: C7. &lt;/ref&gt;

In March, Frank Sinatra agreed to co star. This meant the film would be a co production between Warners, Aldrich's company, the Associates and Aldrich, Martin's company, Claude Productions, and Sinatra's, Essex Productions.&lt;ref&gt;High-Budget Western Is Set
Special to The New York Times.. New York Times  22 Mar 1963: 7. &lt;/ref&gt;

At one stage the role of Elya was originally intended for [[Sophia Loren]], who had already worked with Sinatra in ''[[The Pride and the Passion]]''. Although she was offered $1,000,000 for four weeks of work, Loren turned the part down.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, James. 2015. [https://books.google.com/books?id=1FSWBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT597&amp;dq= ''Sinatra: The Chairman'']. New York: Doubleday. p. 597. {{ISBN|9780385535397}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lollobrigida decided not to do the film. In May Ursula Andress joined the cast and the film was retitled ''Four for Texas''.&lt;ref&gt;FIMLAND EVENTS: Chakiris Will Star in Film in Rome
Los Angeles Times 14 May 1963: D8. &lt;/ref&gt;

Aldrich later said he wrote the first draft of the script but "you could change that over and over and it was still a disaster."&lt;ref name="noir"&gt;mr. film noir stays at the table
Silver, Alain. Film Comment; New York Vol. 8, Iss. 1,  (Spring 1972): 14-23. &lt;/ref&gt;
===Shooting===
Filming started in May 1963.

''4 for Texas'' was filmed in 1.85:1 aspect ratio on 35-mm [[Technicolor]] film. Its promotional trailer features Ursula Andress in specially shot footage addressing the audience.

During production, the relationship between star Sinatra and director Aldrich became strained.  Aldrich felt the film was not a success, and cited problems with his own script, as well as Sinatra's lack of enthusiasm for the project—Aldrich calculated that Sinatra worked a total of only 80 hours during 37 days of filming.&lt;ref name="Silver2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alain Silver|title=What Ever Happened to Robert Aldrich?: His Life and His Films|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vNz_v91Wul4C&amp;pg=PA263|year=2004|publisher=Hal Leonard|isbn=978-1-61780-165-5|pages=263, 350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one stage, Bette Davis was going to make a cameo.&lt;ref&gt;Career Zooming for Betty Hutton: Opening in Local 'Annie' Then Goes to Broadway
Hopper, Hedda. Los Angeles Times 5 June 1963: D16. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The film had its U.S. premiere on December 18, 1963. Forty-three years after its original premiere, ''4 for Texas'' was presented at the [[Torino Film Festival|Turin Film Festival]] on November 12, 2006.

===Home media===
Its first DVD release arrived on November 20, 2001, and the second release (as part of [[The Rat Pack]] collection of ''[[Ocean's Eleven (1960 film)|Ocean's 11]]'' and ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'') was on June 13, 2006.

==Awards and nominations==
It was nominated for the [[Producers Guild of America|Golden Laurel]] as "Top Action Drama", ultimately coming in fourth.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3383">{{For|a genus of snail|Aeneator (gastropod)}}
An '''aeneator'''&lt;!--- "eneator" and "æneator" are never correct, because the "ae" is "aē" in Latin, which cannot collapse to a simple "e" or "æ" in English (compare "aero-") ---&gt; ({{lang-lat|aēneātor}} or {{lang|la|italic=yes|ahēneātor}}) refers to a [[ancient Rome|classical Roman]] professional performer of a horn who was attached to a Roman military unit. The word comes from Latin ''aēneus'' or ''ahēneus'', "brazen", from ''aes'', "[[copper alloys|copper alloy]]".

==Aeneators' role in war==
While the size of individual Roman military units, or [[Ala (Roman allied military unit)|Alae]], may have varied, any Ala would make extensive use of both acoustical and visual signaling in communications and had an assigned banner bearer ([[Vexillarius]]) and at least one Aeneator.  A variety of instruments were used by aeneators, including  the [[buccina]], [[cornu (horn)|cornu]], [[Roman tuba|tuba]], and [[lituus]].  In addition to their roles within battle, aeneators would also be used for processionals and games, particularly in marching home from war&lt;ref name=Antcliffe&gt;{{Citation

==Different categories of aeneators==
Aeneators who blew a cornu (a G-shaped horn made of brass) were known as [[cornicen|cornicines]]; those who blew a tuba (a straight bronze horn with a slight flare at the end)&lt;ref name=Meucci&gt;

Cornicens and tubicens mostly performed uncomplicated tactical signaling on the battlefield, and therefore were not accorded special status in the military unit.&lt;ref name=Donaldson&gt;

By contrast, the bucinator was seen as a specially-skilled member of the unit who was capable of performing a wider repertoire and was used to perform a variety of ceremonial duties.  Many units accorded bucinators [[immune|immunis]] status,&lt;ref name=Donaldson /&gt; and there were [[Equites|equestrian]] bucinatores that served as cavalry buglers.&lt;ref name=Meucci /&gt;

==Other non-military uses for aerophones==
Aeneators were not the only skilled or specialized players of wind instruments in Ancient Roman culture.  For other Roman [[aerophones]] and their usage outside of military contexts, see also:

[[File:Omni art performance 1984.jpg|thumb|Omni Art performance installation Denver, Colorado (1984).]]Art is a popular form of expression within the [[Asian Americans|Asian American]] community and can be seen as a way for the community to push against tradition. Common forms of art are [[painting]] or [[photography]] and the first known record or Asian American art was in 1854, in the form of a photography studio by Ka Chau entitled "Daguerrean Establishment".{{Citation needed|date=August 2017|reason=need cite for the photography studio claim}}&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Asian American Art : A History, 1850-1970|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Performance art became a popular form of expression by the 1960s, allowing artists like [[Linda Nishio]] to focus on issues of representation and self-image.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.janm.org/exhibits/drawingtheline/artists/ "Linda Nishio"], Drawing the Line, Japanese American National Museum, accessed June 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schultz|first=Stacy|year=2012|title=ASIAN AMERICAN WOMEN ARTISTS: Performative Strategies Redefined|url=|journal=Journal of Asian American Studies|volume=|pages=105–127|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music is also used as a form of expression within the Asian American community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reikofujii.com|title=Reiko Fujii|website=www.reikofujii.com|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''barker''' also known as a carnival barker was a person who attempted to attract patrons to entertainment events, such as a [[circus]] or [[funfair]], by exhorting passing public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=barker definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/barker.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwPsqBaD?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/barker.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; describing attractions of show and emphasizing variety, novelty, beauty, or some other feature believed to incite listeners to attend entertainment. A barker would often conduct a brief free show, introducing performers and describing acts to be given at the feature performance. Professional barkers strongly disliked the term and instead referred to themselves as "talkers". {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Perhaps the most famous fictional barkers are Billy Bigelow, the protagonist of [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s  classic stage musical ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', and [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]], a supporting protagonist from the [[1978 in film|1978]] musical film ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'' portrayed by [[Nipsey Russell]]. Bigelow, in turn was an Americanized version of Liliom, the protagonist of Hungarian author [[Ferenc Molnár]]'s non-musical play ''[[Liliom]]'', on which ''Carousel'' is based.

==In popular culture==
Also the film ''[[The Barker]]'' from 1928 stands for this profession.

'''''BattleBots''''' is an [[United States|American]] [[robot combat]] [[television]] series.  Competitors design and operate remote-controlled armed and armored machines designed to fight in an arena combat elimination [[tournament]].  For five seasons, ''BattleBots'' aired on the American [[Comedy Central]] and was hosted by [[Bil Dwyer]], [[Sean Salisbury]], and [[Tim Green]]. Comedy Central's first season premiered on August 23, 2000, and its fifth and last season ended on December 21, 2002.

A six-episode revival series premiered on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on June 21, 2015, to generally favorable reviews and ratings.  Additionally, ABC renewed ''BattleBots'' for a seventh season, which premiered on June 23, 2016. 

Though not officially cancelled, ''BattleBots'' was removed from the ABC website's list of current reality shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABC Reality shows|url=http://abc.go.com/shows?category=reality|website=ABC|accessdate=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, [[Discovery Channel]] and [[Science (TV network)|Science]] picked up the show for its eighth season, which began airing on May 11, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='BattleBots' Revived on Discovery and Science Channels (Exclusive)|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/battlebots-revived-discovery-science-channels-1081917|website=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=7 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==History==
''BattleBots'' is an offshoot of the original American version of ''[[Robot Wars (TV series)|Robot Wars]]'', the brainchild of Marc Thorpe. Robot Wars had financial backing from Sm:)e communications, a New York record company. The Thorpe/Sm:)e partnership broke up in 1997, starting many years of legal wrangling between Thorpe and [[Profile Records]] (the former Sm:)e communications). Profile licensed ''Robot Wars'' to a UK production company and ''Robot Wars'' ran for seven years as a popular television program in the UK, before being revived for 2016.

The robot builders left behind in San Francisco formed BattleBots, Inc. and began a series of competitions. The first was held in Long Beach, California in August 1999 and [[webcast|streamed online]], attracting 40,000 streams. Lenny Stucker, a television producer known for his work on telecasts of [[professional boxing]], was in attendance, and showed interest in being involved with ''BattleBots''—believing the concept of [[robot combat]] was "hip" and having shown an interest in technology. Stucker made changes to the competition's format and presentation to make it more suitable for television, including elements reminiscent of boxing (such as a red and blue corner) and shifting to a single-elimination format. The creators tried selling the competition as a television series to networks such as [[CBS]], [[NBC]], [[HBO]], and [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]]—but they failed to understand the concept of the program or take it seriously. A second event was held as a [[pay-per-view]] in [[Las Vegas]] in 1999; the PPV was in turn, used as a [[Television pilot|pilot]] to pitch the show again, with a higher rate of success.&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Robot Wars: An oral history of the birth and death of BattleBots|url=https://www.sbnation.com/longform/2013/6/18/4438250/battlebots-robot-wars-combat-oral-history|website=SBNation|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the networks interested was [[Comedy Central]], who would ultimately pick up the program. [[Debbie Liebling]], the network's Senior Vice President of original programming and development, felt that the concept would appeal to the network's young adult demographic, explaining that "it was really funny, and really nerdy. The Internet was not a big thing yet, so the nerd culture wasn't so celebrated. It was sports for the nerdy person, I guess."&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory/&gt; Co-creator Greg Munson viewed the deal as a double-edged sword; it gave ''BattleBots'' an outlet and a larger budget, but the network insisted on the addition of comedic aspects to ''BattleBots'' as a program, such as [[Sketch comedy|sketches]] involving contestants. However, the competition itself was not affected by this mandate; Liebling described the final product as being "a parody of a sports show without being a parody". Munson lamented that the network had also ignored his suggestion for the co-host role to be filled by "attractive geek girls" with sufficient knowledge to speak with builders, having elected to "[keep] throwing bigger and better hot babes at it", such as [[Carmen Electra]].&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory/&gt;

Despite this, viewership and awareness of ''BattleBots'' grew progressively over time; contestants Christian Carlberg and Lisa Winter would be invited to appear on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', ''BattleBots'' beat ''[[South Park]]'' as Comedy Central's highest-rated program for a period during season 3, competitor interest grew, and licensing deals also emerged.&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory/&gt; The success of ''BattleBots'', however, resulted in competition from other broadcasters; [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] introduced a competing program, ''[[Robotica]]'', while other channels imported episodes of the British ''Robot Wars'' series.&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory/&gt; By 2002, the program had begun to face further difficulties; Munson felt that the bouts had become "homogenized" because the participants had "perfected" the sport of robot fighting, leading to a lack of innovation in robot designs and strategies.&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory/&gt; Furthermore, ''BattleBots'' had sued [[Anheuser-Busch]] and its advertising agency for producing and airing a [[Super Bowl commercial|commercial]] during [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] that parodied the program and featured a robot greatly resembling one from ''BattleBots'' (this lawsuit, however, would be dismissed in 2004, after a judge ruled that the ad was a [[parody]] protected by [[fair use]]).&lt;ref name=lat-battlebotslawsuit&gt;{{cite news|title=Lawsuit Over Bud Light Ad Dismissed|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/13/business/fi-bots13|accessdate=29 June 2015|agency=Bloomberg News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2002, Comedy Central cancelled ''BattleBots'' after its fifth season, ''BattleBots 5.0''. [[Viacom]] would acquire full control of the network in April 2003;&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnnmoney-viacombuyscc&gt;{{cite web|title=Viacom buys Comedy Central|url=http://money.cnn.com/2003/04/22/news/companies/viacom/|website=CNNMoney|publisher=CNN|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stucker believed that Comedy Central had become "tired" of the program, and Roski stated that Viacom had wanted to shift Comedy Central back towards traditional comedy programming.&lt;ref name=sbnation-oralhistory/&gt;

In December 2014, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] announced that it had picked up a six-episode revival of ''BattleBots'', produced by [[Whalerock Industries]], to premiere in June 2015. Roski and Munson served as executive producers, joined by [[Lloyd Braun]].&lt;ref name=fastco-bb2015&gt;{{cite web|title=At The "Intersection Of Design And Destruction," ABC Reignites "BattleBots" With Creative Combat|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3047032/at-the-intersection-of-design-and-destruction-abc-re-ignites-battlebots-with-creative-combat|website=Fast Company|accessdate=6 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revival drew an average viewership of 5.4 million in its Sunday-night timeslot, with a 1.9 share in the 18-49 demographic. In November 2015, ABC announced that it had renewed the ''BattleBots'' revival for a second season, which expanded the competition to a 56-team field.&lt;ref name=thewrap-renewed&gt;{{cite web|title=ABC Renews ‘BattleBots’ for Season 2|url=http://www.thewrap.com/abc-renews-battlebots-for-season-2/|website=TheWrap|accessdate=6 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=verge-renewed&gt;{{cite news|title=BattleBots is coming back for a second season on ABC|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/6/9680466/battlebots-season-2-abc-summer-2016|accessdate=6 November 2015|work=The Verge}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After ABC declined to renew the revival for a third season, the series was picked up by [[Discovery Channel]] and sister network [[Science (TV channel)|Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/battlebots-revived-discovery-science-channels-1081917|title='BattleBots' Revived on Discovery and Science Channels (Exclusive)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 18, 2018, Discovery and Science channels announced that a new season would begin on Friday, May 11, at 8 PM ET/PT on Discovery Channel and Wednesday, May 16 at 9 PM ET/PT on Science Channel.&lt;ref name="DiscoveryRevival2018"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://press.discovery.com/us/dsc/press-releases/2018/discovery-and-science-channel-announce-season-4330/|title=DISCOVERY AND SCIENCE CHANNEL ANNOUNCE THE SEASON PREMIERE OF ‘BATTLEBOTS’|date=April 18, 2018|website=Discovery|publisher=Discovery Communications, Inc.|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=October 17, 2018|quote=Hit Series to Launch Friday, May 11 at 8 PM ET/PT on Discovery Channel and Wednesday, May 16 at 9 PM ET/PT on Science Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement reported that amongst the bots would be returning favorites Tombstone, Minotaur, Chomp, Witch Doctor, Bronco, Bombshell, Bite Force, and Yeti. [[Chris Rose]] and [[Kenny Florian]] return to call the action, provide background information about the bots and teams, and offer commentary. [[Jessica Chobot]] served again as the sideline reporter. Faruq Tauheed returned as the ring announcer.

==Personalities==
For the first five seasons, ''BattleBots'' was hosted by [[Bil Dwyer]], [[Sean Salisbury]], and [[Tim Green]]. Correspondents included former ''[[Baywatch]]'' actresses [[Donna D'Errico]], [[Carmen Electra]], and [[Traci Bingham]], former [[Playboy Playmate]] [[Heidi Mark]], comedian [[Arj Barker]] and identical twins [[Randy and Jason Sklar]]. [[Bill Nye]] was the show's "technical expert". The show's match announcer was longtime boxing ring announcer Mark Beiro.

The 2015 edition was hosted by [[Molly McGrath]], with [[Chris Rose]] and former [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] fighter [[Kenny Florian]] as commentators. The battle arena announcer is Faruq Tauheed, and [[Alison Haislip]] conducts interviews on the sidelines and behind the scenes. The judges are engineer and [[NASA]] astronaut [[Leland Melvin]], ''[[Nerdist News]]'' anchor [[Jessica Chobot]] and visual effects artist Fon Davis.

For the 2016 season, [[Samantha Ponder]] was added as host, replacing [[Molly McGrath]]. The returning judges are Fon Davis, Jessica Chobot, and Leland Melvin, as well as celebrity guest judges actor [[Clark Gregg]], ''[[MythBusters]]'' host and former Battlebots builder [[Adam Savage]], [[National Football League|NFL]] [[tightend]] [[Vernon Davis]], and [[YouTube]] star [[Michael Stevens (educator)|Michael Stevens]] a.k.a. [[Vsauce]].

For the 2018 season, Rose, Florian and Tauheed all returned in their roles. Chobot and Haislip switched their roles, with Chobot becoming the new sideline reporter and Haislip one of the rotating judges.&lt;ref name="bbotshost18"&gt;{{cite web|title=BattleBots: The cast – BattleBots|url=https://battlebots.com/cast/|website=battlebots.com|accessdate=21 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other judges include former ''Battlebots'' competitors Lisa Winter, Derek Young, [[Grant Imahara]] and Mark Setrakian.&lt;ref name="bbotshost18"/&gt;

==Gameplay==

===Weight classes===
Robots at BattleBots tournaments were separated into four weight classes in seasons 1-5. The weight limits increased slightly over time. At the final tournaments the classes were:

*Lightweight – 60 pounds (27 kilograms)
*Middleweight – 120 pounds (54 kilograms)
*Heavyweight – 220 pounds (100 kilograms)
*Superheavyweight – 340 pounds (154 kilograms)

"Walking" robots ("StompBots") propelled by means other than wheels were initially given a 50% weight bonus. The rules changed following the victory of a heavyweight StompBot (Son of Whyachi) at BattleBots 3.0. For BattleBots 4.0 and beyond only a 20% weight bonus was given to walkers and the technical rules specified that walking mechanisms not use [[cam]] operated walking mechanisms as they were functionally too similar to wheel operation.  Since the rules change, walking robots have entered the competition, but none has achieved any success beyond preliminary rounds.

Starting in season 6, there are no longer separate weight classes while the weight limit for heavyweights was increased from 220-pounds to 250-pounds.

===Matches===
Matches are three minutes long. During a match, two robots do their best to destroy each other using whatever means available.  The match begins by a series of lights that flash from yellow to green.  The original Comedy Central version used a standard Christmas tree as seen in the sport of [[drag racing]]; the ABC revival uses just one box of lights that flash yellow three times, and then flash green.

There are only two events that cause the match to be paused and people enter the BattleBox. One is the event that the robots are stuck together and cannot separate or that both have simultaneously become immobilized. The other scenario is that one or both 'bots have caught on fire. In that case, the people entering the BattleBox are equipped with a fire extinguisher.

If a robot is unable to move for ten seconds, because it is too badly damaged or it is stuck on the arena hazards, it is declared knocked out.  In the Comedy Central version, the driver could also call a "tap-out" to forfeit the match if his or her robot is about to be destroyed. This ends the match ten seconds later; the opposing driver is "asked" (but not instructed) not to attack during the ten-second count.

If both robots survive the three minutes, three judges distribute a total of 45 points (15 points a judge, 5 points per judge per category) over three categories. The robot with the higher score wins.  The judging categories are Aggression, Strategy, and Damage. In Season 6 (June/July 2015), the judging categories were Aggression, Damage, Strategy, and Control. A robot who hangs back safely from its opponent will not get many Aggression points; one in there fighting the whole time, however, will.  The Strategy category is about how well a robot exploits its opponent's weaknesses, protects its own, and handles the hazards. A robot driving over the kill saws will lose points here, unless it had good reason to do so, while a robot that is able to attack its opponent's weak areas will gain points.  The Damage category is for how much damage the bot can deal to its opponent while remaining intact itself.

The winner moves on; the loser is eliminated from the tournament.

At the end of the tournament, a series of 'rumbles' or 'melee rounds' is typically held in each weight class, allowing robots that survived the main tournament to fight in a 'free for all' in a 5-minute match. Occasionally there are too many robots for one rumble, and multiple rumbles are held with the top surviving bots competing in a final event.
During the Season 5 Heavyweight rumble (the first rumble of that competition), a sheared-off robot part went through the Lexan arena roof and fell (harmlessly) into the audience. Because of this, the rest of the rumbles were canceled due to safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;RobotCombat.com http://www.robotcombat.com/nightmare_sf02.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arena===
The BattleBox is a 48' x 48' square arena designed to protect the drivers, officials, and audience from flying shrapnel and charging bots. It was originally designed by Pete Lampertson.  For the 2015 season, Pete is still overseeing the box with the help of Matt Neubauer.  It has a steel floor and steel-framed walls and roof paneled with thick, bulletproof polycarbonate plastic.  The teams bring their robots in through doorways, which are sealed after all humans have exited.  The drivers control their machines from outside the sealed arena.

Arena hazards are intended to make fights more interesting and unpredictable, and to reward drivers who can avoid the hazards while pushing or carrying their opponent into them. Hazards from the first five seasons include (and where noted, omitted for the later ABC/Discovery/Science Channel-shown seasons):

*'''Pulverizers''': Originally pneumatic powered standard sledgehammers that did minimal damage, the Pulverizers were first upgraded to 50 pound aluminum mallets for season 2, and were again upgraded to 150 pound mallets for season 3 and beyond, now with one near each corner. The pulverizers were capable of causing serious damage to the lighter weight class robots.
*'''Spike Strips''':  The lower walls of the arena are lined with inward pointing 6-inch long sharpened steel spikes. Pushing an opponent hard into a wall can sometimes lodge it into the spikes, immobilizing it.
*'''Spinners''': Large, rapidly spinning discs embedded in the arena floor, Not intended to damage a robot, but rather to interfere with navigation.  The spinners could fling lighter class robots across the arena, but the impact on heavier robots was minimal. Omitted for the ABC/Discovery/Science Channel-shown seasons. 
*'''Kill Saws''': Spinning [[circular saw]] blades comprising eight twin-blade hazards, that rise out of slots in the arena floor that were originally under the control of "Pulverizer Pete".  These carbide-tipped saw blades can damage a robot's tires or chassis. In later seasons, red 'throwing blades' were added to increase the chance of a bot being thrown across the arena.
*'''Pistons''': Introduced in Season 3, the Pistons are steel columns that raise and lower from the floor without warning.  They can stop a charging robot or tip a slow moving robot onto its side. The Pistons were removed for Seasons 4 and 5, and likewise omitted for the ABC/Discovery/Science Channel-shown seasons.
*'''Ramrods''': Sharpened steel spikes that rise up out of the arena floor in groups of six, serving either to lift a robot off the ground or damage vulnerable portions of the undercarriage. Omitted for the ABC/Discovery/Science Channel-shown seasons. 
*'''Hell Raisers''': A pneumatic ram that can tilt up specific sections of the arena floor. The 15 degree tilt may become a launching ramp, or may abruptly block passage. The Hell Raisers were removed for Season 5 onwards, to allow more uncluttered room for the robots.
*'''Screws''': Introduced for season 3, these devices were a modification to the static spike strips.  The screws were continually rotating [[auger (drill)|auger]]s placed horizontally along the edges of the arena floor.  The Screws were intended to scrape up a bot, and possibly drag it closer to the Pulverizers due to the corkscrew design.  Much like the Spinners, the Screws had a greater effect on the lighter weight classes—although their impact on all weight classes was small. For Season 5 onwards, the screws were upgraded with biting 'teeth' to better catch onto robots. Their rotation was also modified  so that instead of 'pushing' in one direction, they converged in a corner from opposite directions and created a 'V' that could damage or turn over robots.

'''Bela Vista''' (also known as ''Bexiga'' or ''Bixiga'') is one of the most traditional [[Italy|Italian]] neighborhoods in the city of [[São Paulo]], Brazil. It belongs to the borough of [[Sé (São Paulo)|Sé]], and it has been a mixed neighborhood since its beginning, where free African-Brazilians and/or a mixture of Native-Brazilians, Blacks and Portuguese descendants lived. Later, more European immigrants arrived, such as Spaniards, Germans, English, French, Belgians, and Italians. The Italian community became more numerous than all the others during the first decades of the twentieth century. (source: São Paulo sections site: ''Bairros de São Paulo'')

==Entertainment==
Bela Vista hosts a large number of Italian cantinas or eateries, restaurant and/or delicatessens.Renowned [[theater]]s, such as the state-funded Teatro Sergio Cardoso and few smaller ones on Rua dos Ingleses/Morro dos Ingleses and Avenida 9 de Julho area, such as the teatros Bibi Ferreira and Maria Della Costa. Most theatres nowadays tend to concentrate on Avenida Brigadeiro Luis Antonio with Teatro Abril being the most important venue of musical presentations such as ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', ''[[Beauty and the Beast (musical)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''. Towards the end of the twentieth century, parts of Bexiga became more decayed and dilapidated because its more affluent middle-class moved to newer areas in the suburbs. Although most of the clubs and bars moved from Bela Vista to Itaim Bibi and Vila Madalena in the late 1980s and mid 1990s, Bexiga still has a somewhat vibrant nightlife and is the home of many descendants of Italians and young professionals and students that enjoy the urban atmosphere and the [[Avenida Paulista]] area nearby. Bela Vista is also the home of the Vai-Vai Samba School, the oldest one in São Paulo.

==Church==
Our Lady Achiropita Roman Catholic church on Rua 13 de Maio is an important charity and cultural center in the neighborhood. Famous for the Achiropita procession and the street Italian food fair all weekends in August, the community caters to the needs of poor children and their families in the section and promotes integration of diversity into worship, by adding an African-Brazilian flavor to its masses and baptismal ceremonies (source: Nossa Senhora Achiropita site).

==Hospitals==
The Menino Jesus (Infant Jesus) children's hospital, the Perola Byington women's hospital, The German Osvaldo Cruz hospital, the Hospital Paulistano, Hospital Santa Catarina and Hospital Sirio-Libanes—a cardiovascular and cancer reference institutions,-- as well as vaccine institutes such as the Instituto Pasteur on Avenida Paulista, and other important laboratories and clinics are located in the Bela Vista region.

==Education==
Higher education institutions such as Fundacao Getulio Vargas's Schools of Business ([[EAESP]]), Economics ([[EESP]]) and Law (EDESP), Colegio Objectivo, the Centro Universitario Ibero-Americano, and elite private schools also make their home in Bela Vista, which claims parts of the Avenida Paulista's São Paulo financial center as within its jurisdiction.

==Shopping==
The Paulista shopping mall, The Cidade de Sao Paulo shopping mall, the Hipermercado Extra, and the [[Pao de Acucar]] supermarket chain also make their home in the Bela Vista/Av. Paulista/Paraiso/Jardim Paulista region.

==Nickname==
Bela Vista is also known as "Bexiga" ou "Bixiga." The saying goes that an infection of the bladder ("bexiga" in Portuguese) was common in the section in the late nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth century when it still had a few farms, and residents were labeled with that pejorative. Others say that an Italian or Portuguese resident known for drinking at the taverns of Bela Vista until late night, had a belly as round and big as a party balloon (also "bexiga" in Portuguese), so, the section was nicknamed after him.

==Festival==
Until recently,{{When|date=February 2011}} the Bela Vista community organized the celebration of the anniversary of the City of São Paulo by offering a huge long cake to the population, measuring the age of São Paulo for each year in the metric system.{{Clarify|date=September 2012}} Lack of funding and greed on the part of revellers who grabbed chunks of the cake and stuffed Tupperware containers to take home, which made the cake disappear in seconds, seem to have stopped the annual event on January 25, the Catholic feast of the Conversion of Paul, the apostle, and anniversary of the foundation of São Paulo de Pirapitininga by chief Tibirica' &amp; the Spanish Jesuits Anchieta and Nobrega. (sources: Cyrillo, a São Paulo native who lived in Bela Vista; O Globo Online and Folha de S.Paulo news 2009)

[[File:Bewnans Ke - NLW MS 23849D f. 1r.jpg|thumb|right|Opening page of ''Bewnans Ke'' ([[National Library of Wales]], MS 23849D, folio 1r)]]
'''''Bewnans Ke''''' (''The Life of Saint Ke'') is a [[Middle Cornish]] [[play (theatre)|play]] on the life of [[Saint Kea]] or Ke, who was venerated in Cornwall, [[Brittany]] and elsewhere. It was written around 1500 but survives only in an incomplete manuscript from the second half of the 16th century. The play was entirely unknown until 2000, when it was identified among the private collection of [[J. E. Caerwyn Williams]], which had been donated to the [[National Library of Wales]] after his death the previous year. The discovery proved one of the most significant finds in the study of [[Cornish literature]] and [[Cornish language|language]].

''Bewnans Ke'' is one of only two known Cornish plays based on a saint's life; this and other evidence suggests some relationship with the other such work, ''[[Beunans Meriasek]]''. The story has much correspondence with a French text, a translation of a lost medieval Latin [[hagiography]] of Kea, allowing gaps in the narrative to be tentatively filled. The play is divided into two distinct sections, which may indicate that it was intended for a two-day performance. The first section deals with the deeds and miracles of Kea, including his conflicts with the tyrannical king [[Tewdwr Mawr|Teudar]]. The second is a long [[Arthurian]] episode, describing [[King Arthur]]'s wars with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] and with his nephew [[Mordred]]; it does not mention Kea in its current form.

==History==
''Bewnans Ke'' survives in one manuscript, NLW MS 23849D, now held at the [[National Library of Wales]].&lt;ref name=NLW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id=beunanskenlwms23849d |title=Bewnans Ke (The Life Of St Ke) |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru – National Library of Wales |accessdate=November 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214221551/http://www.llgc.org.uk/index.php?id=beunanskenlwms23849d |archivedate=February 14, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The play has no title in the text; the National Library gave it its modern name after consulting scholars of Cornish.&lt;ref name=NLW/&gt; The manuscript had been in the personal collection of [[J. E. Caerwyn Williams]], chair of [[Irish language|Irish]] at the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]]. After Williams' death in 1999, his widow Gwen Williams donated his papers to the National Library in 2000, and the previously unknown play was identified by Graham Thomas during the cataloging process.&lt;ref name="Lloyd-Morgan"&gt;Lloyd-Morgan, pp. 5–6; Koch, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas publicized his discovery in the ''[[National Library of Wales Journal]]'' in 2002, and the manuscript was subsequently repaired and studied.&lt;ref name=Koch203&gt;[https://books.google.com.au/books?id=f899xH_quaMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Celtic+Culture&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=st%20ke&amp;f=false Koch, p. 203].&lt;/ref&gt;

The manuscript was evidently created in the second half of the 16th century by a scribe copying a document dating perhaps to around 1500.&lt;ref name=NLW/&gt; Several leaves are missing, including the entire beginning and ending and, in two places, the copyist complains about the poor quality of the original.&lt;ref name=NLW/&gt;&lt;ref name=Koch203/&gt; The [[provenance]] is entirely unknown, but the language is [[Middle Cornish]] akin to that of ''[[Beunans Meriasek]]'', the only other surviving Cornish play concerning a saint's life.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, pp. 204–205.&lt;/ref&gt; This and other similarities between the plays suggest that both were composed around the same time and in the same milieu, most probably at [[Glasney College]] in [[Penryn, Cornwall|Penryn]].&lt;ref name=Koch204&gt;Koch, p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; If this is correct, ''Bewnans Ke'' may have been performed in the still-extant "[[Plain-an-gwarry|Playing Place]]" in the nearby [[Playing Place|village of that name]], where ''Beunans Meriasek'' is known to have been performed.&lt;ref name=Koch204/&gt;

The play clearly relies on traditional material about Kea, which is known to have been circulated in a [[Latin]] [[hagiography]] written as early as the 12th century. This work is lost, but a [[French language|French]] translation published in Albert le Grand's ''Lives of the Saints of Brittany'' in 1633 survives.&lt;ref name=Koch203/&gt; This French ''Life of Kea'' has much correspondence with the Cornish text, and has been used to fill in gaps in the action. ''Bewnans Ke'' was initially thought to represent two plays, as in its incomplete state it appears to consist of two distinct sections: one on the deeds of Kea and the other on the doings of [[King Arthur]], in which Kea is not mentioned.&lt;ref name=Koch203/&gt; However, comparison with the ''Life'' shows that Arthurian material had been added to the saint's story at an early period. This occurs in places that would be missing in the play, leading some scholars to regard it as a single work.&lt;ref name=Koch203/&gt;

==Synopsis==
The play consists of two long parts, one concerning the deeds and miracles of Saint Kea, and the other concerning [[King Arthur]]'s conflicts with the Romans and with his nephew [[Mordred]]. The Arthurian section is longer, and is largely adapted from some version of the account in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''.&lt;ref name=Koch203/&gt;

The lost beginning of the play probably recounted the events of Kea's early life, such as his birth to a noble family, his election as bishop, and his subsequent abdication in favour of life as a [[hermit]]. The extant text begins with Kea's resurrection of a deceased shepherd and his departure for [[Cornwall]] by either boat or flying [[flagstone]]. In Cornwall, he soon comes into conflict with the king, Teudar (the [[Bretons|Breton]] [[Tewdwr Mawr]] of [[Penwith]] and [[Cornouaille]]), but is eventually given land near the king's favourite hunting grounds in [[Kea, Cornwall|Kea]] parish. The next section is missing, but context suggests the narrative would have followed the French ''Life'', which has Kea giving refuge to a [[deer|stag]] being hunted by Teudar. In retaliation Teudar's men take Kea's oxen and then break three of the saint's teeth. The manuscript picks back up as Kea generates a [[holy well]] and cures a [[leper]] who gives him additional land. Stags come from the woods to plough Kea's fields in place of the oxen. Teudar tries to make recompense for the injury he has caused Kea, and offers him any land he can empark before Teudar gets out of a bath. With Owbra's aid Kea makes a concoction that causes Teudar to get stuck in the bath, allowing him to take much of Teudar's land. The rest of the first section is missing, but probably dealt with Kea's return to [[Cléder]] in [[Brittany]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Padel, O. J.]] [http://corpus.kernewek.cymru247.net/bk.txt "Summary of the Action of Bewnans Ke"], through stanza 181. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725113836/http://corpus.kernewek.cymru247.net/bk.txt |date=July 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second section begins as King Arthur receives a long list of nobles at his court, including names familiar from [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] such as Duke [[Cador]], Augelus of [[Scotland]], [[Bedivere]], a different Ke ([[Sir Kay]]), [[Mordred]], and [[Gawain]]. The scene jumps to Rome, where Emperor [[Lucius Tiberius|Lucius]] has heard that Arthur refuses to recognize him. He sends twelve emissaries to exact tribute from Arthur. A gap occurs just after the emissaries arrive in Britain and greet the king. In the next extant section, Arthur refuses to pay tribute and sends the legates back to Lucius empty-handed. Lucius confers with his advisors, and decides to raise his forces against Arthur. Leaving his nephew Mordred in charge, Arthur says his goodbyes to [[Guinevere]] and then departs for France to meet Lucius. The two armies battle, and Arthur defeats and kills Lucius, and sends his severed head back to Rome. Meanwhile, Mordred and Guinevere conspire to usurp the throne, and Mordred is crowned king in Arthur's place. Arthur hears of this treachery and assembles his counsellors, while Mordred allies with the [[Saxons|Saxon]] Cheldric. Arthur returns to Britain, and the two armies clash. The text breaks off during a scene with Guinevere in the castle; the end is missing. If it followed the ''Life'', Kea would have re-entered the picture. In the ''Life'', Kea is summoned to mediate between Arthur and Mordred, but he comes to realize that the endeavour is futile. He heads back to Brittany, stopping in [[Winchester]] where he castigates Guinevere. The remorseful queen enters a [[convent]]. Kea returns to Cléder, where he eventually dies peacefully.&lt;ref&gt;[[Padel, O. J.]] [http://corpus.kernewek.cymru247.net/bk.txt "Summary of the Action of Bewnans Ke"], stanzas 181–437. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725113836/http://corpus.kernewek.cymru247.net/bk.txt |date=July 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis and significance==
[[File:Beunans Meriasek (The life of St Meriasek) (f.56v.) Middle Cornish Saint's Play.jpg|thumb|right|A page from ''[[Beunans Meriasek]]'' (National Library of Wales, MS Peniarth 105B, folio 56v)]]
Scholars have pointed out a number of similarities with ''[[Beunans Meriasek]]''. The two are comparable in subject matter: they are the only known vernacular plays on saints' hagiographies to have been produced in Britain.&lt;ref name=Koch205&gt;Koch, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;  The language in both works is similar and dates to the same era, leading to the conclusion that they originate around the same time and place. Both plays include the court at Goodern of the tyrannical king [[Tewdwr Mawr|Teudar]], who may be intended as a parody of King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] after his crushing of the [[Cornish Rebellion of 1497]].&lt;ref&gt;Koch, p. 204, 205.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is thought that ''Bewnans Ke'', like ''Beunans Meriasek'', was written at [[Glasney College]] at the beginning of the 16th century. It is possible that the surviving manuscripts of the two plays were brought to Wales together.&lt;ref name=NLW/&gt;

The substantial length and distinct nature of the two sections may imply that the play was intended for performance over the course of two days, as was the case with ''Beunans Meriasek''. ''Beunans Meriasek'' contains diagrams at the end of each section indicating the completion of a day's performance; these occur in places that would be missing in the ''Bewnans Ke'' manuscript.&lt;ref name=Koch204/&gt; John T. Koch finds the first section to be more dramatic and effective, calling the second section "stolid", though he notes its importance to Arthurian studies.&lt;ref name=Koch204/&gt; On top of Cornish, the text is peppered with lines and words in English, Latin, and [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman French]], particularly in the second section. The [[stage direction]]s are mostly in Latin, but some are in Cornish and English, though the latter may have been added later.&lt;ref name=Koch204/&gt;

The discovery of the play was the first addition to the corpus of historical Cornish literature since [[John Tregear]]'s ''Homilies'' were found in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, p. 1686.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also of vast importance to the study of the Cornish language, as it provides valuable evidence of the state of Cornish in the [[Tudor period]], which was transitional between Middle and [[Late Cornish]].&lt;ref&gt;Koch, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt; Many words in the play are not attested in any other sources.&lt;ref name=NLW/&gt; The Cornish stage directions, though relatively few, contain some of the oldest known Cornish prose.&lt;ref name=Koch204/&gt;

==Publication==
A scholarly edition of the play was published in March 2007 by the [[University of Exeter|University of Exeter Press]] in affiliation with the National Library of Wales; it was edited by Graham Thomas and [[Nicholas Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The National Library also created a digital copy of the manuscript which was released on the Library's web page in 2006.&lt;ref name=NLW/&gt; Prior to publication, study of the play was aided by a summary of the text by [[O. J. Padel]], and a tentative translation by Michael Polkinhorn. These were released on the web and removed when the Thomas and Williams edition was published.&lt;ref name=Koch205/&gt; Prior to this, in 2006 [[Kesva an Taves Kernewek]] (The Cornish Language Board) published an edition of the play edited by [[Ken George]], entitled ''Bywnans Ke''; this caused some friction with the National Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/6036755.stm|title= Copyright row over ancient monk |author= |date= October 10, 2006|work= BBC News|publisher= |accessdate=August 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Book of the Month Club''' (founded 1926&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Radway |first= Janice A. |author-link=Janice Radway|title=A Feeling for Books: The Book-of-the-Month Club, Literary Taste, and Middle-Class Desire| location=Chapel Hill |publisher= University of North Carolina Press |date= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a United States subscription-based e-commerce service that offers a selection of five new hardcover books each month to its members. Books are selected and endorsed by a panel of judges, and members choose which book they would like to receive, similar to how the club originally operated when it began in 1926. Members can also discuss the books with fellow members in an online forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discussion|url=https://www.bookofthemonth.com/discussions.html|website=Book of the Month|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, in concert with the club's 90th year, the club announced a relaunch into its current iteration. Within two years, the club had grown its membership to more than 100,000 members, primarily millennial women, and the club's presence on social media grew to over 300,000 Instagram followers.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/what-do-women-want-one-company-is-betting-it-comes-between-two-covers/2017/12/19/95fd0486-e400-11e7-ab50-621fe0588340_story.html|title=Review {{!}} What do women want?

In 2017, the club debuted its first ever television advertisement called "Monthly".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/this-delightful-ad-for-book-of-the-month-makes-a-bunch-of-period-jokes-and-its-actually-funny/|title=This Delightful Ad for Book of the Month Makes a Bunch of Period Jokes and It's Actually Funny|last=|first=|date=|website=www.adweek.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club has a tradition of focusing on debut and emerging writers, and is known for having helped launch the careers of some of the most acclaimed authors in American literary history. In 1926 (its first year in operation), the Club featured [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''. In 1936 (its tenth year), the Club selected ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' by unknown author [[Margaret Mitchell]]. Today, the book remains the second favorite of American readers (after the Bible). Mitchell wrote: "I wanted to thank [Book of the Month] from the bottom of my heart for selecting my book. It was quite the most exciting and unexpected thing that ever happened to me." In 1951 (its 25th year), the club distributed its 100 millionth book and selected [[J.D. Salinger]]'s ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'', which became both the most-censored and the most-taught book in America. In 1978, the Club selected ''[[By the Rivers of Babylon]]'', the first book by [[Nelson DeMille]], who later wrote: "I will be forever grateful to Book of the Month for ensuring that my first book, ''By the Rivers of Babylon'', was not my last. When the Club selected ''Babylon'' in 1978, it reached hundreds of thousands of additional readers and became an instant best-seller."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bookofthemonth.com/our-story|title=Our Story |website=Book of the Month|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Harry Scherman]] was a copywriter for the [[J. Walter Thompson]] [[advertising agency]] in 1916 when he set out to create the "[[Little Leather Library Corporation|Little Leather Library]]".  With his partners Max Sackheim, and Charles and [[Albert Boni]], Scherman began a mail order service that offered "30 Great Books For $2.98" (miniature reprints "bound in limp Redcroft") and sold 40 million copies in its first five years.&lt;ref name="CB"&gt;"[[Harry Scherman]]," ''Current Biography'' 1943, pp 669-671&lt;/ref&gt; Sackheim and Scherman then founded their own ad agency devoted entirely to marketing books.

The problems of building interest in a new book led Scherman to create, along with Sackheim and Robert Haas, the Book-of-the-Month Club in 1926. As Scherman explained it, the club itself would be a "standard brand". "It establishes itself as a sound selector of good books and sells by means of its own prestige. Thus, the prestige of each new title need not be built up before becoming acceptable," he explained later.&lt;ref name="CB" /&gt; After starting with 4,000 subscribers, the club had more than 550,000 within twenty years. The size of the club did in fact create the Book of the Month Club as a brand. Being a "Book of the Month Club" selection was used to promote books to the general public.

Book of the Month Club was acquired by [[Time Inc.]] in 1977; Time Inc. merged with [[Warner Communications]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kaplan| first = James | title = Inside the Club| accessdate = 2018-04-17| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/11/magazine/inside-the-club.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Book-of-the-Month Club, Inc. merged with Doubleday Direct, Inc. The resulting company, [[Bookspan]], was a joint venture between [[Time Warner]] and Bertelsmann until 2007 when Bertelsmann took over complete ownership. Following a series of investment transactions, the club is currently owned by parent company Pride Tree Holdings, Inc.

== Membership terms ==
The club operates a subscription program, similar to other box subscription services, where customers select a membership plan for a set period of time (3-months, 6-months or 12-months) and books are shipped to all members during the first seven days of the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bookofthemonth.com/how-it-works.html|title=How It Works|accessdate=2015-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, when the club operated through mail-order catalogs, membership involved a "negative response" system whereby a member was shipped the monthly selection on a particular date if the selection was not declined before that date. Members had the option to respond by declining the selection or opting to order another book or merchandise instead. No response was deemed acceptance of the selection.

== Book of the Year Award ==
In late 2016, the club announced its first annual Book of the Year Award, the finalists for which are chosen by the club's members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bookofthemonth.com/best-books-of-the-year/|title=The Best Books of the Year - Book of the Month|author=|date=|website=www.bookofthemonth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The award is called the "Lolly", in tribute to ''Lolly Willowes'', the first book selected by the club back in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bookofthemonth.com/magazine/introducing-the-lolly-191|title=Introducing the Lolly!|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bookofthemonth.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the award added a $10,000 prize, and the winner was The Hearts Invisible Furies by Irish author John Boyne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://global.penguinrandomhouse.com/announcements/book-of-the-month-members-select-the-hearts-invisible-furies-as-book-of-the-year/|title=Book of the Month Members Select THE HEART’S INVISIBLE FURIES as Book of the Year|website=penguinrandomhouse.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.realsimple.com/work-life/entertainment/book-of-the-year-2017|title=Readers Picked This Title As Book of the Year|work=Real Simple|access-date=2018-01-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Calcutta auction''' is an open [[auction]] held in conjunction with a [[golf]] tournament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Brent|title=What is a 'Calcutta' in Golf?|url=http://golf.about.com/od/golfterms/g/bldef_calcutta.htm|publisher=about.com|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[horse race]] or similar contest with multiple entrants.  It is popular in [[backgammon]], the [[Melbourne Cup]], and [[college basketball]] pools during [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|March Madness]]&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal, 'Calcutta' auction: Brainy twist on traditional NCAA pool, March 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Bidding for each contestant begins in random order, with only one contestant being bid upon at any time.  Accordingly, participants (originally in [[Calcutta|Calcutta, India]], from where this technique was first recorded by the Colonial [[British Empire|British]]) bid among themselves to "buy" each of the contestants, with each contestant being assigned to the highest bidder. The contestant will then pay out to the owner a predetermined proportion of the pool depending on how it performs in the tournament. While variations in payoff schedules exist, in an NCAA Basketball tournament (64 teams, single elimination) the payoffs could be: 1 win - 0.25%, 2 wins - 2%, 3 wins - 4%, 4 wins - 8%, 5 wins - 16%, tournament winner with 6 wins - 32%.

The precise rules of a Calcutta can vary from place to place; many tournament organizers employ software programs that apply odds and determine win-place-show amounts. Perhaps the simplest and most common Calcutta payout is 70 percent of the pool to the "owner" of the winning tournament team, 30 percent to the "owner" of the second-place tournament team.

An interesting element of Calcutta auctions is in determining an appropriate wager for each contestant, as the payoff will directly hinge on the size of the pot and thereby the size of the bids being placed. Thus the value of each team fluctuates during the course of the betting. For example, even if a bidder knew the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|University of North Carolina]] would be the tournament winner and thus pay out 32% of the pool, he would still be unsure of the exact value of the team (unless it was the last team being bid on) since the payout depends on the sum total of all winning bids, i.e. the final size of the pool.

Another typical variation in NCAA Calcutta auctions is the bundling and auctioning off as a block the lowest seeded teams in each region, called the "Dogs". For example, the 16th to 13th seeded teams from the Midwest Region would be bid upon as a bundle named the "Dogs of the Midwest". The winning bidder would own all 4 teams and usually recoups his or her investment if one or two of the Dogs wins an upset.

This is similar to [[parimutuel betting]], in that the winnings are awarded from the total pool of bets, but differs in that only one player can bet on any one contestant. However, a player may purchase as many contestants as they desire.

One variation that has grown as the Calcutta auction is used more in conjunction with March Madness involves auctioning teams off in the reverse order of their seeds instead of random order. As bidding evolves, this aids bidders in estimating the final pot size since the heavily favored teams that command the highest bids are auctioned at the end, thereby limiting the risk on the larger bets.

A '''chromatic fantasia''' is a specific type of [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]] (or fantasy or fancy) originating in sixteenth-century Europe. In its earliest form, it is based on a chromatically [[descending tetrachord]] which arises naturally out of the [[dorian mode]]. Consequently the chromatic fantasia is almost invariably in [[D minor]] (D-E-F-G-A-B{{music|b}}-C rather than D-E-F-G-A-B-C) even as late as [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]].

==Some early examples==
Among the earliest examples are two celebrated lute pieces by [[John Dowland]], the ''Farewell'' and ''Forlorn Hope Fancy''. These were obviously highly influential of [[Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck]] whose own Fantasia Chromatica in many ways forms a link between the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Baroque]].

==Bach's chromatic fantasia==
The chromatic fantasy, as a form, fell into neglect in the later seventeenth century. 
About a century after Sweelinck, J. S. Bach contributed the most famous examples of the form, in his [[Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue]], BWV 903.

{{Culture of Kazakhstan}}
'''Cinema of Kazakhstan''' refers to the [[film industry]] based in [[Kazakhstan]]. [[Film|Cinema]] in Kazakhstan can be traced back to the early 20th century. Today, Kazakhstan produces approximately fifteen full-length films each year.&lt;ref name="Kazakhstan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-kazakhstan-selects-amanat-foreign-933701 |title=Oscars: Kazakhstan Selects 'Amanat' for Foreign-Language Category |first=Nick |last=Holdsworth |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=29 September 2016 |accessdate=29 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
===1930s-1980s: the Soviet period===
The [[film industry]] in Kazakhstan has its origins in the production of documentaries in [[Almaty|Alma-Ata]] (now Almaty) in the 1930s, developed to use as instruments for [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|Soviet propaganda]].&lt;ref name="History of Cinema of Kazakhstan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmbirth.com/kazakhstan.html|title=History of Cinema of Kazakhstan|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=FilmBirth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valikhanov.si.edu/sec1_discover-kaz/sec1_3_kazakhstan.html|title=Kazakhstan Today|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=Valikhanov.si.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Kazakh feature film, ''Amangeldy'' (1939), about the leader of the 1916 revolution, Amangeldy Imanov, was however the work of [[Lenfilm]] in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DE5DF1530E53ABC4E52DFB0668382629EDE|title=The screen in review; Comedy Lifts Its Head Again in 'Clouds Over Europe' at the Music Hall--'Land of Liberty' Opens at the Fair--'Amangeldy' Is Seen at the Cameo|author=Frank S. Nugent|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Filmmaking]] in Kazakhstan was given a boost by the dislocations caused by [[World War II]], as the main [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet film]] studios, [[Mosfilm]] and [[Lenfilm]], were both evacuated to Alma-Ata, where they combined with the [[Kazakhfilm|Alma-Ata Film Studios]] to produce the Central United Film Studio.&lt;ref name="History of Cinema of Kazakhstan"/&gt; As a result, the Central United Film Studio, which continued working in Alma-Ata till 1944, produced 80 percent of all Soviet domestic feature films made during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kazworld.info/?p=16808|title=Kazakh Cinema Celebrates 70th Anniversary|date=October 4, 2011|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=KazWorld.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the great Soviet director [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s two part epic ''[[Ivan the Terrible (1944 film)|Ivan the Terrible]]'' was filmed in the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]].&lt;ref&gt;Perrie, Maureen. ''The Cult of Ivan the Terrible in Stalin's Russia (Studies in Russian and Eastern European History and Society) ''. New York: Palgrave, 2001 (hardcopy, {{ISBN|0-333-65684-9}}).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the major Soviet [[film school]]s, the [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]] (VGIK), was also temporarily relocated to Alma-Ata during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0812492/bio|title=Lyubov Sokolova - Biography - IMDb|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film school became an alma-mater for the most notable Kazakh filmmakers of the 1960s, known as "the new wave".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Lennon|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/jan/27/artsfeatures|title=The Kazakhs are coming|date=January 27, 2003|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 6, 1961, the major Kazakh film company Alma-Ata Film Studios had its name changed to Kazakhfilm by the Ministry of the Culture of the Kazakh SSR.&lt;ref name="History of the Kazakhfilm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://195.210.47.145/company/our_history/history/|title=History of the Kazakhfilm|language=ru|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=Kazakhfilm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140216200510/http://195.210.47.145/company/our_history/history/|archivedate=February 16, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the post-war Soviet period, the major figure of Kazakh SSR's film industry was director [[Shaken Aimanov]], in whose honor the [[Kazakhfilm]] film studios were renamed in 1984.&lt;ref name="History of the Kazakhfilm"/&gt; Notable films of this period include a number of [[historical epics]], such as the love tragic story ''Kyz-Zhibek'' (1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2977364/|title=Kyz-Zhibek (1970) - IMDb|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a trio of action films involving a secret agent, played by Asanali Ashimov, who uses all manner of derring-do to defeat the enemies of [[communism]]. The first in the [[trilogy]], ''The End of the Ataman'' (1970), was set in 1921 and was directed by Shaken Aimanov.&lt;ref name="The End of the Ataman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcinemadirectory.co.uk/component/film/?id=446|title=The End of the Ataman|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=WorldCinemaDirectory.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second, ''The Trans-Siberian Express'' (1977),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076838/releaseinfo|title=Transsibirskiy ekspress (1977) - IMDb|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by Yeldar Orazbayev and set in 1927, featured a complicated plot involving the defeat of counter-revolutionaries planning to kill a [[Japan]]ese businessman on a train bound for [[Moscow]], on which our hero was masquerading as a cabaret manager. The third, ''The Manchurian Variant'' (1989), was set in 1945 [[Manchuria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kazakhfilmstudios.kz/en/press/news/7022/|title=Legendary film "The end of Ataman" celebrates its 40 anniversary (video)|date=December 14, 2010|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=Kazakhfilm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The films, with their central hero played by a Kazakh actor, were, as well as entertainment, part of the efforts of the Soviet establishment to demonstrate that the Kazakh people fully supported communism.&lt;ref name="The End of the Ataman"/&gt;

===Late 1980s-early 1990s: Kazakh New Wave===
{{Expand section|date=February 2017}}
During the [[perestroika]] in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, a new wave of young Kazakh filmmakers emerged, ready to challenge the cinematic establishment. Released in 1988, ''[[Needle (1988 film)|The Needle]]'' provided a catalyst for this new movement in Kazakh film. The film, directed by [[Rashid Nugmanov]], cast [[Viktor Tsoi]] as the central figure. Tsoi was the frontman of the popular Soviet rock group [[Kino (band)|Kino]], and considered by many to be a hero to the disaffected Soviet youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russia-ic.com/news/show/8050/#.UwF82kBSJaE|title=Cult Movie The Needle (Igla) to be Continued|date=April 13, 2009|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=Russia-ic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0637835/bio|title=Rashid Nugmanov - Biography - IMDb|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kino also composed the film's original soundtrack. Tsoi's character, Moro, returns to Alma-Ata to collect a debt from a lowly criminal, only to find out that his former girlfriend has become a drug addict. He decides to fight against the drug dealers, after which the film ends with him being stabbed in a snowy park at night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2010/cteq/igla-the-needle/|author=Greg Dolgopolov|title=Igla (The Needle)|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=SensesOfCinema.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important founding work of the movement is [[Yermek Shinarbayev|Ermek Shinarbaev]]'s 1989 film ''[[The Red Flute|Revenge]]'' (Месть), which tackles on film for the first time the tragedies experienced by the Korean population in Kazakhstan and Central Asia.

===1990s-2000s: the post-independence Kazakhstan===
[[File:Timur Bekmambetov by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|[[Timur Bekmambetov]] is the first Kazakh director who had success in Hollywood.]]
In 1993, Nugmanov directed ''[[The Wild East]]'', loosily based on [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s ''[[Seven Samurai]]'', involves a group of dwarves, runaways from the circus, who brings the magnificent seven to protects them from the predations of motorbike-riding [[Mongolia]]n  hoodlums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://survinat.com/2012/11/wild-east-1993-3/|title=Wild East (1993)|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=Survinat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nugmanov moved to [[Paris]] in 1993, where he has been associated with Kazakh political opposition groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topspeaker.org/speakers/speaker-nugmanov|title=Rashid Nugmanov (Nougmanov)|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=TopSpeaker.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other filmmakers of the post-independence Kazakhstan to have achieved success at international festivals include Satybaldy Narimbetov.&lt;ref name="Satybaldy Narimbetov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmfestival.gr/2003/uk/st-narimbetov.html|title=Satybaldy Narimbetov|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=Thessaloniki International Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Biography of a Young Accordion Player'' (1994) is a tale of a small boy growing up in a Kazakh village during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Satybaldy Narimbetov"/&gt; ''Leila's Prayer'' (2002) focuses on girl from a village close to the [[Semey|Semipalatinsk]] [[Anti-nuclear movement in Kazakhstan|nuclear test site]], whose mother prayer is that her baby son should live to old age.&lt;ref name="Kazakh Cinema Between 1998 and 2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinokultura.com/articles/jan04.html|title=Stars Above Almaty: Kazakh Cinema Between 1998 and 2003|author=Vladimir Padunov|date=January 4, 2004|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=KinoKultura.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Darezhan Omirbaev]]'s ''[[Killer (1998 film)|Killer]]'' (1998), a Kazakh-[[France|French]] [[International co-production|co-production]], is a tragic tale highlighting the economic difficulties by Kazakhstanis in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Kazakh Cinema Between 1998 and 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Killer (1998)"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/162524/Killer/overview|title=Killer (1998)|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A young driver from [[Almaty]] causes a minor motor accident when taking his wife and newborn baby back home from the hospital. Unable to pay for the damage, he gets sucked into crime.&lt;ref name="Killer (1998)"/&gt; Amir Karakulov has garnered critical praise for a number of films, including ''Homewrecker'' (1991), a tale of two brothers in love with the same girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://megabook.ru/article/РАЗЛУЧНИЦА|title=Homewrecker (''Разлучница'')|language=ru|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=MegaBook.ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, it all ends badly. A new arrival on the scene is Rustem Abdrashev. His directorial debut was ''Renaissance Island'' (2004), a tale of the first love of an aspiring poet set against the historical backdrop of the desiccation of the [[Aral Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinokultura.com/reviews/R104ostrov.html|title=Rustem Abdrashev: Renaissance Island (Ostrov vozrozhdeniia) (2004)|accessdate=February 17, 2014|publisher=KinoKultura.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem is that very few of these films have been widely seen by audiences in Kazakhstan. Domestic [[Film distribution|distributors]] have preferred to rely a diet of [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] [[Hollywood]] [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s and big-budget [[Russia]]n movies, with the result that post-independence Kazakh cinema has developed something of a reputation a being more likely to be found in Western art houses and international competitions than on screens in Kazakhstan. However, [[Film budgeting|the big-budget]] Kazakhstan film has arrived. ''[[Nomad (2005 film)|Nomad: The Warriors]]'' (2005), with its international crew and cast, was an officially supported attempt to bring a film based on an exploits of Kazakh warriors of the 18th century onto international screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374089/|title=Nomad (2005), a Kazakh film by Sergei Bodrov and Ivan Passer|date=June 6, 2008|accessdate=February 18, 2014|publisher=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dina Iordanova|url=http://www.dinaview.com/?p=116|title=Кочевник (2005) ''(Nomad: The Warriors)''|accessdate=February 18, 2014|publisher=DinaView.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Racketeer'' (2007), directed by Akan Satayev, about as a young Almaty in the tough economic climate of the 1990s, was billed as the first purely commercially oriented film made in the post-independence Kazakhstan, and proved a considerable box-office draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1677719/|title=Рэкетир (2007) ''Racketeer (2007)''|accessdate=February 18, 2014|publisher=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Kazakh director, [[Timur Bekmambetov]], has also had success internationally in [[Commercial broadcasting|commercials cinema projects]], particularly with the Russian fantasy features ''[[Night Watch (2004 film)|Night Watch]]'' (2004) and ''[[Day Watch (film)|Day Watch]]'' (2006).&lt;ref name="Bekmambetov Is Off To See The Warriors, The Wonderful ‘Warriors Of Oz’"&gt;{{cite web|author=Luke Ryan Baldock|url=http://www.thehollywoodnews.com/2013/07/23/bekmambetov-is-off-to-see-the-warriors-the-wonderful-warriors-of-oz/|title=Bekmambetov Is Off To See The Warriors, The Wonderful ‘Warriors Of Oz’|date=July 23, 2013|accessdate=February 18, 2014|publisher=TheHollywoodNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bekmambetov is now directing and producing movies in [[Hollywood]].&lt;ref name="Bekmambetov Is Off To See The Warriors, The Wonderful ‘Warriors Of Oz’"/&gt; His notable works made in Hollywood includes ''[[Wanted (2008 film)|Wanted]]'' (2008), ''[[The Darkest Hour (film)|The Darkest Hour]]'' (2011) and ''[[Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter]]'' (2012).

A [[guerrilla filmmaking]] movement called ''Partisan Cinema'' (Partizanskoe kino) was initiated in the 2010’s. Participating directors aim to work without any interference from the Kazakh government. The movement’s manifesto has three pillars: no budget, social realism and finding new ways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fipresci.org/festival-reports/2015/moscow/the-partisan-movement-or-kazakhstan-s-new-wave-cinema The Partisan Movement, or Kazakhstan's New Wave Cinema] by Eduardo Guillot&lt;/ref&gt; Films and directors in the movement include:
* ''Toll Bar'' (Shlagbaum, 2015) by [[Zhassulan Poshanov]]
* ''[[The Plague at the Karatas Village]]'' (Chuma v aule Karatas, 2016) by [[Adilkhan Yerzhanov]]  
* ''Witness of Case No 6'' (Svidetel' dela No 6, 2016) by [[Serik Abishev]]

The '''College of Psychic Studies''' (founded in 1884 as the London Spiritualist Alliance) is a non-profit organisation based in [[South Kensington]], [[London]]. It is dedicated to the study of [[psychic]] and [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] phenomena.

==History==
===British National Association of Spiritualists===

In August 1873, the British National Association of Spiritualists (BNAS) was formed by [[Thomas Everitt]], [[Edmund Rogers]] and others at a meeting in [[Liverpool]].&lt;ref name="Oppenheim 53"&gt;[[Janet Oppenheim|Oppenheim, Janet]]. (1988). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914''. Cambridge University Press. p. 53. {{ISBN|978-0521347679}} "The British National Association of Spiritualists emerged from a meeting in Liverpool, in August 1873, sponsored by the local Psychological Society. Attendance was not confined to spiritualists from the immediate area, and among the participants were W. H. Harrison and Thomas Everitt from London. The meeting heard several papers advocating the benefits of national organization for the expansion and consolidation of British spiritualism, and these arguments carried the day. The conference resolved to form a national association, and initiative then passed to London, where the following year the BNAS commenced its activities. From 1875, it was comfortably housed at 38 Great Russell Street, the scene of its numerous stances, both public and private, committee meetings, lectures, and social gatherings."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lavoie 2014"&gt;Lavoie, Jeffrey D. (2014). ''Search for Meaning in Victorian Religion: The Spiritual Journey and Esoteric Teachings of Charles Carleton Massey''. Lehigh University Press. pp. 19-20. {{ISBN|978-1611461848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Stainton Moses Photograph.png|thumb|upright|[[William Stainton Moses]], founder of the London Spiritualist Alliance.]]
Early members included well known spiritualists such as [[Charles Maurice Davies]], [[Charles Isham]], [[William Stainton Moses]], [[Stanhope Templeman Speer]], [[Morell Theobald]] and [[George Wyld]].&lt;ref name="Lavoie 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spence 2006"&gt;[[Lewis Spence|Spence, Lewis]]. (2006 edition, originally published 1920). ''An Encyclopaedia of Occultism''. Cosimo. p. 80. {{ISBN|978-1596052376}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BNAS carried out experimental [[séance]]s and investigations into mediumship. It held no dogmatic religious views but was known for "sympathising with the religion of Jesus Christ".&lt;ref name="Lavoie 2014"/&gt;
[[File:London Spiritualist Alliance member list.png|right|thumb|Member list for the London Spiritualist Alliance in March, 1884.]]

The first public meeting of the BNAS took place on April 16, 1874 under the chairmanship of [[Samuel Carter Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Frank Podmore|Podmore, Frank]]. (2011 edition, originally published 1902). ''Modern Spiritualism: A History and a Criticism. Volume 2''. Cambridge University Press. p. 169. {{ISBN|978-1-108-07258-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1875 the BNAS had over 400 members.&lt;ref name="Lavoie 2014"/&gt; Its headquarters moved to [[Great Russell Street]], London.&lt;ref name="Oppenheim 53"/&gt; In 1879 the German astrophysicist [[Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner]] became an honorary member.&lt;ref&gt;Lavoie, Jeffrey D. (2014). ''Search for Meaning in Victorian Religion: The Spiritual Journey and Esoteric Teachings of Charles Carleton Massey''. Lehigh University Press. p. 61. {{ISBN|978-1611461848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Henry Harrison and his colleagues from the "Scientific Research Committee" of the BNAS were involved in experiments that weighed mediums during materialization séances.&lt;ref name="Noakes"&gt;Noakes, Richard J. ''Instruments to Lay Hold of Spirits: Technologizing the Bodies of Victorian Spiritualism''. In Iwan Rhys Morus. (2002). ''Bodies/Machines''. Bloomsbury Academic. pp. 125-163. {{ISBN|1-85973-690-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specially built self-recording instruments were used. This was considered controversial and not all members agreed in conducting such experiments. In 1872, Harrison also caused controversy in the spiritualist community by exposing the fraud of spirit photographer [[Frederick Hudson (photographer)|Frederick Hudson]].&lt;ref name="Noakes"/&gt; In 1875, Harrison with [[C. F. Varley]] conducted an unsuccessful experiment in photographing the alleged [[Odic force]] of [[Carl Reichenbach]].&lt;ref name="Noakes"/&gt;

There was a large dispute between Moses and Harrison over its leadership council. Harrison was expelled from the BNAS.&lt;ref name="Noakes"/&gt; In April 1879, [[Charles Massey]] a vice-president resigned, as did Moses on December 31, 1880.&lt;ref name="Lavoie 2014"/&gt; In 1882, the BNAS changed name to the Central Association of Spiritualists (CAS). The remaining members such as vice-president Edmund Rogers, one of Moses's loyal supporters tried to reconstruct the society.&lt;ref name="Oppenheim 55-57"&gt;[[Janet Oppenheim|Oppenheim, Janet]]. (1988). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 55-57. {{ISBN|978-0521347679}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, internal conflict between members and financial problems caused the group to dissolve.&lt;ref name="Lavoie 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oppenheim 55-57"/&gt;

===London Spiritualist Alliance===

In October, 1883 a special conference was set up to discuss the ideas of Moses to form a new society.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, G. K. (2013). ''Spiritualism and Society''. p. 110. Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0415714624}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1884, Moses and others formed the London Spiritualist Alliance (LSA). The first meeting was held on May 5 at the banqueting room in [[St James's Hall]].&lt;ref name="Lavoie 2014"/&gt; Moses was president and members included [[John Stephen Farmer]], Massey, Rogers, Stanhope Templeman Speer, [[Alaric Alfred Watts]] and [[Percy Wyndham (1835–1911)|Percy Wyndham]].&lt;ref name="Oppenheim 55-57"/&gt; After Moses died in 1892, Rogers became the president. The LSA obtained a wider membership under the leadership of Rogers including notable figures such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]].&lt;ref name="Oppenheim 55-57"/&gt;

In 1886, [[Eleanor Mildred Sidgwick|Eleanor Sidgwick]] from the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR) claimed that the medium [[William Eglinton]] was fraudulent. Members from the LSA and articles in the journal ''Light'' supported Eglinton and accused Sidgwick of bias and prejudice. Some spiritualist members resigned from the SPR.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Luckhurst|Luckhurst, Roger]]. (2002). ''The Invention of Telepathy, 1870-1901''. Oxford University Press. p. 57. {{ISBN|978-0199249626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925, [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] became president and the LSA bought a new headquarters at Queensberry Place, South Kensington.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Lycett|Lycett, Andrew]]. (2008). ''The Man Who Created Sherlock Holmes: The Life and Times of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle''. Free Press. p. 434. {{ISBN|0-7432-7523-3}} "Having benefited from a memorial fund for the war dead, the London Spiritualist Alliance had bought a new headquarters in Queensberry Place, South Kensington. With Arthur as its president beginning in 1925, it held a three-day bazaar at Caxton Hall in May, raising 1,000 pounds to renovate and furnish the place. It also rented out its top floor to Harry Price, thus giving him a permanent location for his National Laboratory for Psychical Research."&lt;/ref&gt;

Between October, 1930 and June 1931 the [[Materialization (paranormal)|materialization]] medium [[Helen Duncan]] was investigated by the LSA. Despite early favourable reports, an examination of Duncan's [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] revealed it was made of [[cheesecloth]], paper mixed with the white of egg and lavatory paper stuck together. One of Duncan's tricks was to swallow and regurgitate some of her ectoplasm and she was persuaded to swallow a tablet of [[methylene blue]] before one of her séances to rule out any chance of this trick being performed and because of this no ectoplasm appeared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Renée Haynes|Haynes, Renée]]. (1982). ''The Society for Psychical Research 1882-1982: A History''. MacDonald &amp; Co. p. 144. {{ISBN|978-0356078755}} "The London Spiritualist Alliance had fifty sittings with her between October 1930 and June 1931; for these sittings she was stripped, searched and dressed in 'seance garments'. Two interim reports in ''Light'' were favorable, a third found indications of fraud. Pieces of 'ectoplasm' found from time to time differed in composition. Two early specimens consisted of paper or cloth mixed with something like white of egg. Two others were pads of surgical gauze soaked in 'a resinous fluid'; yet another consisted of layers of lavatory paper stuck together. The most usual material for 'ectoplasm' however, seemed to be butter muslin or cheesecloth, probably swallowed and regurgitated. Distressing choking noises were sometimes heard from within the cabinet; and it was interesting that when she was persuaded to swallow a tablet of methylene blue before one of the seances at the London Spiritualist Alliance, no ectoplasm whatsoever appeared."&lt;/ref&gt; The journal ''Light'' endorsed the court decision that Duncan was fraudulent and supported [[Harry Price]]'s investigation that revealed her ectoplasm was cheesecloth.&lt;ref&gt;Hazelgrove, Jenny. (2000). ''Spiritualism and British Society Between the Wars''. Manchester University Press. p. 279. {{ISBN|978-0719055584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===College of Psychic Studies===

In 1955 the LSA changed name to the College of Psychic Science, and in 1970 it became the College of Psychic Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Rosemary Guiley]]. (1994). ''The Guinness Encyclopedia of Ghosts and Spirits''. Guinness World Records Limited. p. 125. p. 334. {{ISBN|978-0851127484}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fichman, Martin. (2004). ''An Elusive Victorian: The Evolution of Alfred Russel Wallace''. University Of Chicago Press. p. 191. {{ISBN|978-0226246130}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Georgina. (2010). ''Modern Spiritualism and the Church of England, 1850-1939''. Boydell Press. pp. 60-62. {{ISBN|978-1843835899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to psychical researcher [[Simeon Edmunds]] by 1955 when the LSA had changed name to the College of Psychic Science there was "no doubt that from that time onwards the society was no longer a spiritualist one" as it was accepting non-spiritualist members and held no corporate opinion on the question of survival.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simeon Edmunds|Edmunds, Simeon]]. (1966). ''Spiritualism: A Critical Survey''. Aquarian Press. p. 72. {{ISBN|978-0850300130}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, after a revival in spiritualism, the college associated itself with the Society for Psychical Research, collecting thousands of case files.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1397313/Paul-Beard.html "Paul Beard"]. ''The Telegraph''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Beard (spiritualist)|Paul Beard]] was the president of the college for 16 years.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; In 2006, the college offered twelves courses on psychic abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Armstrong| first = Stephen| coauthors = | title = Generation X-Files| work = | pages = | publisher = New Statesman| date = August 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television psychic [[Tony Stockwell]] is a member of the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Spend an evening with 'The Psychic Detective'| work = | pages = 7| publisher = The Citizen| date = October 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Count Primo Magri''' (1849–1920) and '''Count Rosebud''' were the [[stage name]]s of a 19th-century [[Italians|Italian]] [[dwarfism|dwarf]] who married [[Lavinia Warren]], the [[widow]] of [[General Tom Thumb]] on [[Easter Monday]], April 6, 1885&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1885/04/07/archives/two-wee-people-married-tom-thumbs-widow-becomes-the-countess-magri.html TWO WEE PEOPLE MARRIED; TOM THUMB'S WIDOW BECOMES THE COUNTESS MAGRI] ''[[The New York Times]]'' April 7, 1885&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Trinity Church (Manhattan)|Church of the Holy Trinity]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sideshowworld.com/tgodSR.html Some Recollections Mrs. Tom Thumb's Autobiography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060508184022/http://www.sideshowworld.com/tgodSR.html |date=2006-05-08 }},  New York Tribune Sunday Magazine, November 25, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

Dictionary of Phrase and Fable (1898)&lt;/ref&gt; Magri was two inches shorter than Lavinia's first husband. Together they operated a famous roadside stand in [[Middleborough, Massachusetts]], and with their troupe composed of other dwarves as well as people of regular height travelled the world, performing plays such as ''[[The Rivals]]'' and ''[[Gulliver's Travels|Gulliver Among the Lilliputians]]'' before the public and royalty, including [[Queen Victoria]].

Magri's supposed [[twin]] brother, Giuseppe (or Ernesto) Magri (1850-?), also a dwarf, used the stage names ''Baron Magri'' and ''Baron Littlefinger''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=902 ''The Seattle Telegraph'', June 24, 1892 p. 5; Seattle Press-Times, June 24, 1892 p. 3; The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, June 19, 1892 p. 13; Ibid., June 23, 1892 p. 5.

While the military and [[Nobility|aristocratic]] titles that [[P. T.

The Magris were said to have had very expensive tastes, and were therefore forced to exhibit themselves into old age.&lt;ref name=kelley/&gt; He appeared in a 1915 silent film, ''The Lilliputian's Courtship'', as Uncle Tiny Mite along with his wife, [[Lavinia Warren]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2101793/] Magri on the [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Count Primo Magri died in 1920 at [[Middleborough, Massachusetts]] aged 71 years.

In [[theatre studies]], '''didaskalia''' is anything written within a [[play (theatre)|play]] text that is not directly spoken by a [[character (arts)|character]].  The term is the modern re-use of the theatrical term of the [[classical antiquity]] [[wikt:διδασκαλία|διδασκαλία]] literally meaning "teaching", "instruction".&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Introduction to Theatre Studies&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095717703]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyklopediateatru.pl/hasla/212/didaskalia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J88fLaFswBAC&amp;pg=PA25]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.literaryterminology.com/index.php/lemmas/11-d/297-didaskalia]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Disney On Ice''', originally '''Walt Disney's World on Ice''', is a series of touring [[ice theatre|ice shows]] produced by [[Feld Entertainment]]'s [[Ice Follies|Ice Follies And Holiday on Ice, Inc.]] under agreement with [[The Walt Disney Company]]. Aimed primarily at children, the shows feature [[figure skating|figure skaters]]  portraying the roles of [[Disney]] characters in performances derived from various Disney films.

Feld Entertainment licensed the rights to Disney material for ice shows and includes shared merchandising revenue between Disney and Ice Follies.&lt;ref name=ct/&gt; 

==History==
Soon after [[Mattel]]'s [[Feld Entertainment|Irvin &amp; Kenneth Feld Productions]] purchased [[Ice Follies]] and [[Holiday on Ice]] in 1979, the company approached Disney about doing a Disney-related show on ice. Feld Productions licensed the rights to Disney material for ice shows.&lt;ref name=ct&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dale|first1=Steve|title=Snow White And Greenbacks|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-01-20/entertainment/9501200093_1_kenneth-feld-productions-snow-white-dwarfs|accessdate=July 30, 2015|work=Chicago Tribune|date=January 20, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mat&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Feld Family Buys Ringling Bros |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E0DD1639F93AA25750C0A964948260|quote=Two members of the family, Irvin Feld and his son, Kenneth, said that the deal included the circus, Ice Follies, Holiday on Ice and the new Walt Disney's World on Ice. |work=[[Associated Press]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=March 19, 1982 |accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, they began productions under the name Walt Disney's World on Ice.&lt;ref name=mat/&gt;&lt;ref name=abt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schneider Farris|first1=Jo Ann|title=Shipstads and Johnson Ice Follies| url= http://figureskating.about.com/od/skatingstarsofthepast/p/follies.htm |website=About Figureskating|publisher=About.com|accessdate=July 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dobričin prsten award''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]] [[Cyrillic]]: '''Добричин прстен''') is the life-achievement award for theatrical acting, considered the most distinguished one in the Serbian theater. 

The name of the award (''ring of Dobrica'') refers to the golden ring awarded to one of the most prominent actors in the history of the Serbian theater, [[Dobrica Multinović]] (1880–1956), in 1937 by the Association of the actors of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

Laureate is chosen by the voting of the 7-members jury of the Union of the drama artists of Serbia. The award consists of the golden copy of the ring, diploma on parchment and a monograph on the laureate's career. 

It has been awarded since 1980, yearly 1980-84 and 1994-2012 and biennially 1984-94 and since 2012. Laureate is named in October and receives the award in the January of the next year.

[[Image:Trumpet embouchure.jpg|thumb|The embouchure of a trumpeter.]]
'''Embouchure''' or '''lipping'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/embouchure Merriam-Webster.com]&lt;/ref&gt; is the use of the lips, facial muscles, tongue, and teeth in playing a [[wind instrument]]. This includes shaping the lips to the [[mouthpiece (woodwind)|mouthpiece]] of a [[woodwind instrument]] or the [[mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] of a [[brass instrument]]. The word is of [[French language|French]] origin and is related to the root ''{{wiktfra|bouche}}'', 'mouth'. Proper embouchure allows instrumentalists to play their instrument at its full range with a full, clear tone and without strain or damage to their muscles.

==Brass embouchure==
While performing on a brass instrument, the sound is produced by the player buzzing his or her lips into a mouthpiece. Pitches are changed in part through altering the amount of muscular contraction in the lip formation. The performer's use of the air, tightening of cheek and jaw muscles, as well as tongue manipulation can affect how the embouchure works.

Even today, many brass pedagogues{{Who|date=August 2011}} take a rigid approach to teaching how a brass player's embouchure should function. Many of these authors{{Which|date=August 2011}} also disagree with each other regarding which technique is correct. Research{{Which|date=August 2011}} suggests efficient brass embouchures depend on the player using the method that suits that player's particular anatomy (see below). Individual differences in dental structure, lip shape and size, jaw shape and the degree of jaw malocclusion, and other anatomical factors will affect whether a particular embouchure technique will be effective or not.&lt;ref&gt;''How The Chops Work'', [[Clint McLaughlin]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, [[Philip Farkas]] hypothesized&lt;ref name="artofbrass"&gt;''The Art of Brass Playing'', Philip Farkas, 1962&lt;/ref&gt; that the air stream traveling through the lip aperture should be directed straight down the shank of the mouthpiece. He believed that it would be illogical to "violently deflect" the air stream downward at the point of where the air moves past the lips. In this text, Farkas also recommends that the lower jaw be protruded so that the upper and lower teeth are aligned.

In 1970, Farkas published a second text&lt;ref name="farkasphoto"&gt;''A Photographic Study of 40 Virtuoso Horn Players'', Philip Farkas, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; which contradicted his earlier writing. Out of 40 subjects, Farkas showed that 39 subjects directed the air downward to varying degrees and one subject directed the air in an upward direction at various degrees. The lower jaw position seen in these photographs show more variation from his earlier text as well.

This supports what was written by trombonist and brass pedagogue [[Donald S. Reinhardt]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;''Pivot System For Trumpet'', Donald S. Reinhardt, 1942&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Pivot System for Trombone'', Donald S. Reinhardt, 1942&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972,&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of the Pivot System'', Donald S. Reinhardt, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Reinhardt described and labeled different embouchure patterns according to such characteristics as mouthpiece placement and the general direction of the air stream as it travels past the lips. According to this later text, players who place the mouthpiece higher on the lips, so that more upper lip is inside the mouthpiece, will direct the air downwards to varying degrees while playing. Performers who place the mouthpiece lower, so that more lower lip is inside the mouthpiece, will direct the air to varying degrees in an upward manner. In order for the performer to be successful, the air stream direction and mouthpiece placement need to be personalized based on individual anatomical differences. Lloyd Leno confirmed the existence of both upstream and downstream embouchures.&lt;ref&gt;"A Study of Lip Vibrations with High-Speed Photography", ''International Trombone Association Journal'', Lloyd Leno, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

More controversial was Reinhardt's description and recommendations regarding a phenomenon he termed a "pivot". According to Reinhardt, a successful brass embouchure depends on a motion wherein the performer moves both the mouthpiece and lips as a single unit along the teeth in an upward and downward direction. As the performer ascends in pitch, he or she will either move the lips and mouthpiece together slightly up towards the nose or pull them down together slightly towards the chin, and use the opposite motion to descend in pitch. Whether the player uses one general pivot direction or the other, and the degree to which the motion is performed, depends on the performer's anatomical features and stage of development. The placement of the mouthpiece upon the lips doesn't change, but rather the relationship of the rim and lips to the teeth. While the angle of the instrument may change as this motion follows the shape of the teeth and placement of the jaw, contrary to what many brass performers and teachers believe, the angle of the instrument does not actually constitute the motion Reinhardt advised as a pivot.

Later research supports Reinhardt's claim that this motion exists and might be advisable for brass performers to adopt. John Froelich&lt;ref&gt;"The Mouthpiece Forces Used During Trombone Performances", ''International Trombone Association Journal'', John Froelich, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; describes how mouthpiece pressure towards the lips (vertical forces) and shear pressure (horizontal forces) functioned in three test groups, student trombonists, professional trombonists, and professional symphonic trombonists. Froelich noted that the symphonic trombonists used the least amount of both direct and shear forces and recommends this model be followed. Other research notes that virtually all brass performers rely upon the upward and downward embouchure motion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Correlation Between Doug Elliott's Embouchure Types and Playing and Selected Physical Characteristics Among Trombonists'' (David Wilken, doctoral dissertation, [[Ball State University]], 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''An Analysis, Clarification, and Revaluation of Donald Reinhardt's Pivot System for Brass Instruments'' (David Ray Turnbull, doctoral thesis, [[Arizona State University]], 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors and pedagogues remain skeptical about the necessity of this motion, but scientific evidence supporting this view has not been sufficiently developed at this time.

Some noted brass pedagogues prefer to instruct the use of the embouchure from a less analytical point of view. [[Arnold Jacobs]], a tubist and well-regarded brass teacher, believed that it was best for the student to focus on his or her use of the air and musical expression to allow the embouchure to develop naturally on its own.&lt;ref&gt;''Arnold Jacobs: Song and Wind'', Brian Frederiksen, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Other instructors, such as Carmine Caruso, believed that the brass player's embouchure could best be developed through coordination exercises and drills that bring all the muscles into balance that focus the student's attention on his or her time perception.&lt;ref&gt;''Musical Calisthenics for Brass'', Carmine Caruso, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; Still other authors who have differing approaches to embouchure development include [[Louis Maggio]],&lt;ref&gt;''Original Louis Maggio System for Brass'', C. MacBeth&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeff Smiley]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Balanced Embouchure'', Jeff Smiley&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome Callet]].&lt;ref&gt;''Superchops'', Jerome Callet&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Trumpet Secrets'', Jerome Callet&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clint McLaughlin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Tensionless Playing'' and "The 4 Trumpet Octave Keys" http://www.BbTrumpet.com, Clint 'Pops' McLaughlin&lt;/ref&gt;

===Farkas embouchure===
Most professional performers, as well as instructors, use a combination called a puckered smile. Farkas&lt;ref name="artofbrass" /&gt; told people to blow as if they were trying to cool soup. [[Raphael Mendez]] advised saying the letter "M".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbtrumpet.com/embouchures.html&lt;/ref&gt; The skin under the lower lip will be taut with no air pocket. The lips do not overlap nor do they roll in or out. The corners of the mouth are held firmly in place. To play with an extended range one should use a pivot, tongue arch and lip to lip compression.

According to Farkas&lt;ref name="artofbrass" /&gt; the mouthpiece should have {{2/3}} upper lip and {{1/3}} lower lip (French horn), {{2/3}} lower lip and {{1/3}} upper lip (trumpet and cornet), and more latitude for lower brass (trombone, baritone, and tuba). For trumpet, some also advocate {{1/2}} upper lip and {{1/2}} lower lip.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Farkas claimed placement was more important for the instruments with smaller mouthpieces.&lt;ref name="artofbrass" /&gt; The lips should not overlap each other, nor should they roll in or out. The mouth corners should be held firm. Farkas speculated that the horn should be held in a downward angle to allow the air stream to go straight into the mouthpiece, although his later text&lt;ref name="farkasphoto" /&gt; shows that air stream direction actually is either upstream or downstream and is dependent upon the ratio of upper or lower lip inside the mouthpiece, not the horn angle. Farkas advised to moisten the outside of the lips, then form the embouchure and gently place the mouthpiece on it.&lt;ref name="artofbrass" /&gt; He also recommended there must be a gap of {{convert|1/3|in|mm|0}} or so between the teeth so that the air flows freely.

Arban and Saint-Jacome were both cornet soloists and authors of well respected and still used method books. Arban stated undogmatically that he believed the mouthpiece should be placed {{1/3}} on the top lip. Saint-Jacome to the contrary said dogmatically that the mouthpiece should be placed "two-thirds for the upper and the rest for the under according to all professors and one-third for the upper and two-thirds for the under according to one sole individual, whom I shall not name."&lt;ref&gt;Original text: http://www.purtle.com/saint-jacome-method-original-text.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buzzing embouchure====
The Farkas set is the basis of most lip buzzing embouchures. Mendez did teach lip buzzing by making the student lip buzz for a month before they could play their trumpet and got great results. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbtrumpet.com/lip-buzzing-embouchure-and-mendez/&lt;/ref&gt; One can initiate this type of buzz by using the same sensation as spitting seeds, but maintaining a continued flow of air. This technique assists the development of the Farkas approach by preventing the player from using an aperture that is too open.

===Stevens–Costello embouchure===

Stevens–Costello embouchure has its origins in the William Costello embouchure and was further developed by [[Roy Stevens]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete Stevens-Costello Embouchure Technique, 2nd Edition'' by Roy Stevens &amp; Bill Moriarity, Amazon Create Space&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a slight rolling in of both lips and touching evenly all the way across. It also uses mouthpiece placement of about 40–50% top lip and 50–60% lower lip. The teeth will be about {{convert|1/4|to|1/2|in|mm|0}} apart and the teeth are parallel or the jaw slightly forward.

There is relative mouthpiece pressure to the given air column. One exercise to practice the proper weight to air relationship is the palm exercise where the player holds the horn by laying it on its side in the palm of the hand, not grasping it. The lips are placed on the mouthpiece and the player blows utilizing the weight of the horn in establishing a sound.

===Maggio embouchure===

A puckered embouchure, used by most players, and sometimes used by jazz players for extremely high "screamer" notes. Maggio claimed that the pucker embouchure gives more endurance than some systems. Carlton MacBeth is the main proponent of the pucker embouchure. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbtrumpet.com/maggio-embouchure/&lt;/ref&gt; The Maggio system was established because Louis Maggio had sustained an injury which prevented him from playing. In this system the player cushions the lips by extending them or puckering (like a monkey). This puckering enables the players to overcome physical malformations. It also lets the player play for an extended time in the upper register. The pucker can make it easy to use to open an aperture. Lots of very soft practice can help overcome this. Claude Gordon was a student of Louis Maggio and Herbert L. Clarke and systematized the concepts of these teachers. Claude Gordon made use of pedal tones for embouchure development as did Maggio and Herbert L. Clarke. All three stressed that the mouthpiece should be placed higher on the top lip for a more free vibration of the lips.

===Tongue-controlled embouchure===

This embouchure method, advocated by a minority of brass pedagogues such as Jerome Callet, has not yet been sufficiently researched to support the claims that this system is the most effective approach for all brass performers.

Advocates of Callet's approach believe that this method was recommended and taught by the great brass instructors of the early 20th Century. Two French trumpet technique books, authored by Jean-Baptiste Arban and Saint-Jacome, were translated into English for use by American players. According to some, due to a misunderstanding arising from differences in pronunciation between French and English, the commonly used brass embouchure in Europe was incorrectly interpreted.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Callet attributes this difference in embouchure technique as the reason the great players of the past were able to play at the level of technical virtuosity which they did, although the increased difficulty of contemporary compositions for brass seem to indicate that the level of brass technique achieved by today's performers equals or even exceeds that of most performers from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Callet's method of brass embouchure consists of the tongue remaining forward and through the teeth at all times. The corners of the mouth always remain relaxed, and only a small amount of air is used. The top and bottom lips curl inward and grip the forward tongue. The tongue will force the teeth, and subsequently the throat, wide open, supposedly resulting in a bigger, more open sound. The forward tongue resists the pressure of the mouthpiece, controls the flow of air for lower and higher notes, and protects the lips and teeth from damage or injury from mouthpiece pressure. Because of the importance of the tongue in this method many refer to this as a "tongue-controlled embouchure". This technique facilitates the use of a smaller mouthpiece and larger bore instruments. It results in improved intonation and stronger harmonically related partials across the player's range.

==Woodwind embouchure==
[[File:SfondoNINI2b.JPG|thumb|Flute embouchure]]

===Flute embouchure===

A variety of [[flute|transverse flute]] embouchures are employed by professional flautists, though the most natural form is perfectly symmetrical, the corners of the mouth relaxed (i.e. not smiling), the lower lip placed along and at a short distance from the embouchure hole. It must be stressed, however, that achieving a symmetrical, or perfectly centred blowing hole ought not to be an end in itself. Indeed, French flautist [[Marcel Moyse]] did not play with a symmetrical embouchure.

The end-blown [[Xiao (flute)|xiao]], [[kaval]], [[shakuhachi]] and [[hocchiku]] flutes demand especially difficult embouchures, sometimes requiring many lessons before any sound can be produced.

The embouchure is an important element to tone production. The right embouchure, developed  with "time, patience, and intelligent work",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | author = [[Marcel Moyse]]

 | title = De la Sonorité

 | publisher= A. Leduc

 | year = 1934

}}&lt;/ref&gt; will produce a beautiful sound and a correct intonation. The embouchure is produced with the muscles around the lips: principally  the [[orbicularis oris muscle]] and the [[Depressor anguli oris muscle|depressor anguli oris]], whilst avoiding activiation of [[Zygomaticus major muscle|zygomaticus major]], which will produce a smile, flattening the top lip against the maxillary (upper jaw) teeth. Beginner flute-players tend to suffer fatigue in these muscles, and notably struggle to use the depressor muscle, which necessarily helps to keep the top lip directing the flow of air across the embouchure hole. These muscles have to be properly warmed up and exercised before practicing. Tone development exercises including long notes and harmonics must be done as part of the warm up every day.

Some further adjustments to the embouchure are necessary when moving from the transverse orchestral flute to the piccolo. With the piccolo, it becomes necessary to place the near side of the embouchure hole slightly higher on the lower lip, i.e. above the lip margin, and greater muscle tone from the lip muscles is needed to keep the stream/pressure of air directed across the smaller embouchure hole, particularly when playing in higher piccolo registers.

===Reed instrument embouchure===
[[File:WikiLoveMusikHamburg2017 B-Klarinette 1K4A0846B.jpg|thumb|Clarinet embouchure.]]
With the woodwinds, aside from the [[flute]], [[piccolo]], and [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], the sound is generated by a [[reed (music)|reed]] and not with the lips. The embouchure is therefore based on sealing the area around the reed and mouthpiece. This serves to prevent air from escaping while simultaneously supporting the reed, allowing it to vibrate, and constrict the reed preventing it from vibrating too much. With woodwinds, it is important to ensure that the mouthpiece is not placed too far into the mouth, which would result in too much vibration (no control), often creating a sound an octave (or harmonic twelfth for the clarinet) above the intended note. If the mouthpiece is not placed far enough into the mouth, no sound will be generated, as the reed will not vibrate.

The standard embouchures for single reed woodwinds like the [[clarinet]] and [[saxophone]] are variants of the ''single lip embouchure'', formed by resting the reed upon the bottom lip, which rests on the [[teeth]] and is supported by the chin muscles and the [[buccinator]] muscles on the sides of the mouth. The top teeth rest on top of the mouthpiece. The manner in which the lower lip rests against the teeth differs between clarinet and saxophone embouchures.  In clarinet playing, the lower lip is rolled over the teeth and corners of the mouth are drawn back, which has the effect of drawing the upper lip around the mouthpiece to create a seal due to the angle at which the mouthpiece rests in the mouth. With the [[saxophone embouchure]], the lower lip rests against, but not over, the teeth as in pronouncing the letter "V" and the corners of the lip are drawn in (similar to a drawstring bag).  With the less common double-lip embouchure, the top lip is placed under (around) the top teeth. In both instances, the position of the tongue in the mouth plays a vital role in focusing and accelerating the air stream blown by the player. This results in a more mature and full sound, rich in [[overtone]]s.

The [[double reed]] woodwinds, the [[oboe]] and [[bassoon]], have no mouthpiece. Instead the reed is two pieces of cane extending from a metal tube (oboe – staple) or placed on a [[bocal]] ([[bassoon]], [[Cor anglais|English horn]]). The reed is placed directly on the lips and then played like the double-lip embouchure described above. Compared to the single reed woodwinds, the reed is very small and subtle changes in the embouchure can have a dramatic effect on [[musical tuning|tuning]], [[timbre|tone]] and [[pitch (music)|pitch]] control.

[[File:Eight (film start) cropped2.jpg|thumb|Countdown on the head leader of a film reel]]
A '''film leader''' is a length of film attached to the head or tail of a film to assist in threading a [[Movie projector|projector]] or [[telecine]]. A leader attached to the beginning of a reel is sometimes known as a '''head leader''', or simply '''head''', and a leader attached to the end of a reel known as a '''tail leader''' or '''foot leader''', or simply '''tail''' or '''foot'''.

"Film leader", used generically, refers to different types manufactured for many editorial and laboratory uses.  For example, some types are used in negative cutting while making A and B rolls for printing. "Painted leader" is perforated film in overall colors, usually white, black, red, blue, or green.  These are used for protective head and tail leaders to keep the body of the program material from being damaged. "Fill leader" (also called picture fill, or spacer, or slug film) is used to space out different sections of magnetic audio film stock so they are kept in synchronization with the picture.  Typically, this is made from rejected or retired prints of previously released programs.

A '''universal film leader''' is a head leader designed for television and [[Movie theater|theatrical motion picture exhibition]] applications. This includes the [[countdown]], and technical information about the film, including title, studio, production number, [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]], sound level and [[audio mixing (film and television)|mix]], [[film reel|reel]] number and [[Color motion picture film|color]].

Head leaders are marked with visual and audio information that may be used to ensure that the correct amount of time is allowed for the machine to run up to [[frame rate|speed]] and arrive at the beginning of the program or movie. They generally feature a countdown.

==Countdown leaders==
Two versions of the countdown leader are well-known:

;Academy Leader : &lt;!-- Sometimes called the "Society Leader," and dating from the 1950s --&gt;First introduced on 1 November 1930 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences,&lt;ref&gt;''Motion Picture News'', 11 October 1930, p. 31. Accessed via mediahistoryproject.org.&lt;/ref&gt; it has numbers marked once every foot (16 frames per foot in [[35 mm film]]), counting down from 12 to 3. &lt;!-- It had a crosshair pattern on a black background with arrows on the side. Between each number (except before three), "16 SOUND" and "35 SOUND" would flash on screen on the crosshairs. --&gt; "NINE" and "SIX" are spelled out, to avoid confusion between 6 and 9 when viewed upside-down. The numbers are printed upside down relative to the visual program so as to be right side up when the projectionist is threading a projector. At 3, a quick beep is heard (but this beep is muted on 35mm theatrical release prints to prevent it from being accidentally played in the theater). The Academy leader is specified by SMPTE 301.&lt;ref name="smpte301"&gt;SMPTE 301M-1999. ''SMPTE STANDARD for Motion-Picture Film: Theater Projection Leader, Trailer and Cue Marks.'' Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. White Plains, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard also specifies the position and placement of the [[cue marks]] at the end of the reel.
;SMPTE Universal Leader : In the mid-1960s, the [[Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers]] (SMPTE) replaced the Academy Leader with a new&lt;!--er universal --&gt; style, called the SMPTE Universal Leader,&lt;ref&gt;ASA/SMPTE PH22.55-1966, "Leaders and Cue Marks for 35mm and 16mm Sound Motion-Picture Release Prints," ''ACL Handbook--Recommended Standards and Procedures for Motion Picture Laboratory Services'', (Alexandria, VA, March 1972, revised third edition), pp. 54-59.&lt;/ref&gt; designed for both television and theatrical projection applications (though it did not gain widespread acceptance theatrically). It featured a continuous countdown from 8 to 2 (measured in [[second]]s, rather than feet), with the numbers in the center of a target with two white circles and a rotating "clock arm" animation. At the beginning, before the countdown, it features "16 SOUND START" and then "35 SOUND START" in a circle target. Then "PICTURE START" appears and the countdown begins. The numbers appear right side up when projected on a screen, while the Academy countdown numbers would be upside down. During the four count, the letters "C C F F" would appear around the countdown, signifying the use of those frames as "control frames." At 2, a quick beep would be heard, sometimes known as the "[[2-pop]]".&lt;ref&gt;Tomlinson Holman, ''Sound for Film and Television'', (Boston, Focal Press, 1997), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The Universal Leader is specified by [[ANSI]]/SMPTE 55.&lt;ref name="smpte55"&gt;SMPTE 55-2000. ''SMPTE STANDARD for Motion Picture Film: 35- and 16-mm Television Release Prints -- Leaders and Cue Marks.'' Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers. White Plains, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard also specifies position and placement of the [[cue marks]] at the end of the reel. Either by 1992 or 2000, the name of the leader was changed from "Universal Leader" to "Television Leader."

The latest overall length of both styles is the same: in 35mm, 16 feet and 4 frames or 260 frames.  The countdown section begins with a single frame bearing the words "Picture Start."  The sync beep (or [[2-pop]]) occurs in synchronization with the last numbered frame ("3" on the Academy leader, "2" on the SMPTE Television leader).  The length of the countdown section, including the "Picture Start" frame through to and including the "3" foot or "2" second frame, is 9 feet and 1 frame (145 frames) plus 47 frames of black (for a total of 12 feet even or 192 frames).

In 2013, SMPTE introduced the D-Cinema Digital Leader; a picture version of the countdown leader for use with Digital Cinema Distribution Master (DCDM) files.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smpte.org&lt;/ref&gt;  The DCDM is the penultimate step to the creation of the [[Digital Cinema Package]] (DCP). Unlike the previous film standards, no provision is made for changeover cue marks because digital cinema files are continuous.

==Previous versions==

;Society Leader : Introduced in 1951 by SMPTE,&lt;ref&gt;C.L. Townsend, "New All-Purpose Film Leader," ''Journal of the SMPTE'', vol. 56, May 1951, pp. 562-567. Accessed via mediahistoryproject.org.&lt;/ref&gt; it was a modification of the "Academy leader" in order to work better with the film chains most TV stations were then using.  The numbers still counted down once every foot, from 11 to 3, but instead of being upside down relative to the main program visuals, the numbers were right side up.  Furthermore, instead of there being just black film in between the numbers, Society leader had a crosshair pattern to help with television framing and focusing. This style of countdown leader did not receive a separate standard identification.  It was completely replaced by the SMPTE Universal leader.
* The Academy leader was revised in April 1934.  The revision shifted the changeover cue marks earlier by 6 frames.  After the second world war, the 1934 format was accepted by American Standards Association, the precursor to [[ANSI]], and given the designation ASA Z22.55-1947, "Specification for 35-Millimeter Sound Motion Picture Release Prints in Standard 2000-Foot Lengths."&lt;ref&gt;Howard M. Tremaine, ''The Audio Cyclopedia'', (Indianapolis, Howard W. Sams &amp; Co.,1959, first edition April), pg 712.&lt;/ref&gt; This standard was intended to be supplanted by the SMPTE Universal Leader, introduced in 1965-66. But once it was realized that theater projectionists were not going to accept the new format, the traditional Academy format was given a new code: SMPTE 301.
* The original SMPTE Universal leader had a middle gray density for the overall background and the 47 frames between the 2 frame and the first frame of picture.&lt;ref&gt;''ACL Handbook'', op. cit., pp. 54-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent revisions darkened this to black in order to encourage adoption of the leader by theatrical projectionists.

A '''gangster film''' or '''gangster movie''' is a film belonging to a genre that focuses on [[gang]]s and [[organized crime]]. It is a subgenre of [[crime film]], that may involve large criminal organizations, or small gangs formed to perform a certain illegal act. The genre is differentiated from Westerns and the gangs of that genre.

==Overview==
The [[American Film Institute]] defines the genre as "centered on organized crime or maverick criminals in a twentieth century setting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=American Film Institute Brings The Best Of Hollywood Together To Celebrate "Afi’S 10 Top 10” On The Cbs Television Network, June 17, 2008 |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/about/press/2008/AFI10_top_10_release_June08.pdf |location=Los Angeles |publisher=American Film Institute |agency=American Film Institute (AFI) |date=29 May 2008 |access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute named it one of the 10 "classic genres" in its [[AFI's 10 Top 10|10 Top 10]] list, released in 2008.  The list recognizes 3 films from 1931 &amp; 1932 (''Scarface'', ''Public Enemy'' &amp; ''Little Caesar'').  Only 1 film made the list from 1933 to 1966, (''[[White Heat]]'' (1949)).  This was at least partly due to the limitations on the genre imposed by the [[Hays Code]], which was finally abandoned in favor of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system]] in 1968.&lt;ref name="Cortés 117"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cortés |first=Carlos E. |title=Italian-Americans in Film: From Immigrants to Icons |jstor=467405 |journal=MELUS |volume=14 |issue=3/4 |pages=117 |doi=10.2307/467405 |year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre was revitalized in the [[New Hollywood]] movement that followed.  New Hollywood directors would be honored with 5 of the top 6 films on the list—1967's ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' by [[Arthur Penn]], 1972's ''[[The Godfather]]'' and 1974's ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' both by [[Francis Ford Coppola]], 1983's ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', a remake of the [[Scarface (1932 film)|1932 original]], by [[Brian De Palma]], and 1990's ''[[Goodfellas]]'' by [[Martin Scorsese]].

In the 1970s, as genre theory came to the focus of academic study and the creation of a more specific taxonomy of genres was defined, gangster film started being distinguished from other subgenres, especially that of western. The genre has been predominantly defined by its historical, ideological, and sociocultural context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199791286/obo-9780199791286-0102.xml |title=Gangster Films |author=Fran Mason |work=Oxford bibliographies |accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three main categories of gangster films can be distinguished, according to Martha Nochimson: films that follow the escapades of outlaw rebels, such as ''Bonnie and Clyde'', melodramas of villain gangsters against whom the in-story victims and the audience identify, such as ''[[Key Largo]]'' and, most predominantly in the genre, films following an outsider, immigrant gangster protagonist, with whom the audience identifies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://criminology.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001/acrefore-9780190264079-e-149 |title=Gangsters and Genre |author=Anita Lam  |journal=Oxford Research Encyclopedias |accessdate=27 June 2017|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190264079.001.0001 |date=2016-11-22 |doi-broken-date=2018-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gangster films in the United States==

===Early Hollywood===
1931 and 1932 produced three of the most enduring gangster films ever. ''Scarface'', ''Little Caesar'' and ''The Public Enemy'' remain as three of the greatest examples of the genre. However, starting in the mid-1930s, the Hays Code and its requirements for all criminal action to be punished and all authority figures to be treated with respect made gangster films scarce for the next three decades.

[[File:Humphrey Bogart in The Petrified Forest film trailer.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''[[The Petrified Forest]]'' (1936) trailer]]
Politics combined with the social and economic climate of the time to influence how crime films were made and how the characters were portrayed. Many of the films imply that criminals are the creation of society, rather than its rebel,&lt;ref&gt;John Baxter, ''The Gangster Film'' (London: C. Tinling and Co. Ltd, 1970), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and considering the troublesome and bleak time of the 1930s, that argument carries significant weight. Often the best of the gangster films are those that have been closely tied to the reality of crime, reflecting public interest in a particular aspect of criminal activity; thus, the gangster film is in a sense a history of crime in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institution of Prohibition in 1920 led to an explosion in crime, and the depiction of bootlegging is a frequent occurrence in many mob films. However, as the 1930s progressed, Hollywood also experimented with the stories of the rural criminals and bank robbers, such as [[John Dillinger]], [[Baby Face Nelson]], and [[Pretty Boy Floyd]]. The success of these characters in film can be attributed to their value as news subjects, as their exploits often thrilled the people of a nation who had become weary with inefficient government and apathy in business.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the FBI increased in power there was also a shift to favour the stories of the FBI agents hunting the criminals instead of focusing on the criminal characters. In fact, in 1935 at the height of the hunt for Dillinger, the Production Code office issued an order that no film should be made about Dillinger for fear of further glamorizing his character.
[[File:George Raft in Invisible Stripes trailer.jpg|left|thumb|150px|''[[Invisible Stripes]]'' (1939)]]

Many of the 1930s crime films also dealt with class and ethnic conflict, notably the earliest films, reflecting doubts about how well the American system was working. As stated, many films pushed the message that criminals were the result of a poor moral and economic society, and many are portrayed as having foreign backgrounds or coming from the lower class. Thus, the film criminal is often able to evoke sympathy and admiration out of the viewer, who often place the blame on not the criminal's shoulders but a cruel society in which success is difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Terry Christensen, ''Projecting Politics: Political Messages in American Films'' (New York: M.E. Sharp, Inc., 2006), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; When the decade came to a close, crime films became more figurative, representing metaphors, as opposed to the more straight forward films produced earlier in the decade, showing an increasing interest in offering a thought provoking message about criminal character.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Hollywood===
[[File:Francis Ford Coppola -1976 (cropping).jpg|thumb|left|Francis Ford Coppola in 1976]]
With the abolition of the Hays Code in the late 1960s, studios and filmmakers found themselves free to produce films dealing with subject matter that had previously been off-limits.&lt;ref name="Cortés 117"/&gt;  Early examples include [[Arthur Penn]]'s depression-era tale of ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''; ''[[Mean Streets]]'', Scorsese's cinema vérité story of a young aspiring mobster and his problem-gambler friend, played by [[Robert De Niro]] and [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia]]'', about the Mexican mob, family honor, and the opportunistic Bennie ([[Warren Oates]]), friend of the eponymous Alfredo Garcia, looking to make a big score when the chance drops in his lap.  Bonnie and Clyde was one of 1967's biggest box office hit and garnered 2 [[40th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] and 8 other nominations including best picture.  It, along with the others, however, were overshadowed by Francis Ford Coppola ''Godfather'' saga.

====''The Godfather'' pioneering Italian-American Mafia films====
{{see also|Mafia film}}
In 1972, [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[The Godfather]]'' was released.  The epic story of the [[Corleone family]], its generational transition from post-prohibition to post-war, its fratricidal intrigues, and its tapestry of mid-century America's criminal underworld became a huge critical and commercial success.  It accounted for nearly 10% of gross proceeds for all films for the entire year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schatz|first=Thomas|title=Hollywood: Critical Concepts in Media and Cultural Studies|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOasz7CE0TUC|series=Motion Picture Industry|volume=I|year=2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-28132-4|pages=292–293|chapter=The New Hollywood}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It won the [[45th Academy Awards|Oscar for Best Picture]], as well as the award for Best Actor for [[Marlon Brando]]&lt;ref&gt;Brando declined the Oscar in protest of Hollywood's treatment of Native Americans. {{cite web |title=43 years later, Native American activist Sacheen Littlefeather reflects on rejecting Marlon Brando's Oscar |url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2016/02/27/43-years-later-native-american-activist-reflects-on-rejecting-marlon-brandos-oscar/ |date=27 February  2016 |access-date=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely considered one of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|greatest American films of all time]].  Two years later, ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' became the fifth-highest-grossing film of the year and garnered 11 [[47th Academy Awards|Academy Award nominations]].  It again won Best Picture.  Coppola won Best Director and [[Robert DeNiro]] won best supporting actor for his portrayal of a young Vito Corleone.

The lesson of the films' successes was not wasted on Hollywood.  Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the studios issued a steady flow of films about Italian American gangsters and the Mafia.  Some of these were critically acclaimed.  Scorsese's ''[[Goodfellas]]'' about [[Henry Hill]]'s life and relationship with the [[Lucchese crime family|Lucchese]] and [[Gambino crime family|Gambino]] crime families, was nominated for 6 [[63rd Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including Best Picture and Best Director and won the award for Best Supporting Actor for [[Joe Pesci]]'s performance.  Others, however, strayed into stereotypes and the gratuitous use of Italian ethnicity in minor characters who happened to be criminals.  This created a backlash in the Italian American community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cortés |first=Carlos E. |title=Italian-Americans in Film: From Immigrants to Icons |jstor=467405 |journal=MELUS |volume=14 |issue=3/4 |pages=118–119 |doi=10.2307/467405 |year=1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scorsese and the 1990s–2010s====
The films of the 1990s produced several critically acclaimed mob films, many of which were loosely based on real crimes and their perpetrators.  Many of these films featured long-time actors well known for their roles as mobsters such as [[Al Pacino]], [[Robert De Niro]], [[Joe Pesci]] and [[Chazz Palminteri]].

''[[Goodfellas]]'', directed by [[Martin Scorsese]], starred [[Ray Liotta]] as real-life associate of the [[Lucchese crime family]] [[Henry Hill]].  It was one of the most notable gangster films of the decade. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci also starred in the film with Pesci earning an Academy Award for [[Best Actor in a Supporting Role]].  The film was nominated for six Academy Awards in all, including Best Picture and Best Director, making ''Goodfellas'' one of the most critically acclaimed crime films of all time.

Following their collaboration in ''Goodfellas'', Scorsese, De Niro and Pesci would team up again in 1995's ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', based on [[Frank Rosenthal]], an associate of the [[Chicago Outfit]], that ran multiple casinos in Las Vegas during the 1970s and 1980s.  The film was De Niro's third mob film of the decade, following ''Goodfellas'' (1990) and ''[[A Bronx Tale]] ''(1993).

Al Pacino also returned to the genre during the 1990s.  He reprised his role as the iconic [[Michael Corleone]] in ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990).  The film served as the final installment in The Godfather trilogy, following Michael Corleone as he tries to legitimize the Corleone family in the twilight of his career.

In 1993, Pacino starred in ''[[Carlito's Way]]'' as a former gangster released from prison that vows to go straight. In 1996, [[Armand Assante]] starred in television film [[Gotti (1996 film)|Gotti]] as infamous New York mobster, [[John Gotti]]. In 1997's ''[[Donnie Brasco (film)|Donnie Brasco]]'', Pacino starred alongside [[Johnny Depp]] in the true story of undercover [[FBI]] agent [[Joseph Pistone]] and his infiltration of the [[Bonanno crime family]] of New York City during the 1970s.  It was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]].

In 2006, Scorsese released ''[[The Departed]]'', his adaptation of ''[[Infernal affairs]]'', the Hong Kong film. ''The Departed'' was also loosely based on the [[Whitey Bulger]] story, and Boston's [[Winter Hill Gang]], which Bulger led. It earned Scorsese an [[Academy Award for Best Director]] and the film won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].

A 2018 [[biographical film|biographical]] mafia film, [[Gotti (2018 film)|''Gotti'']], directed by [[Kevin Connolly (actor)|Kevin Connolly]], stars [[John Travolta]] as John Gotti, released in June. On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film [[List of films with a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|holds an approval rating of 0%]] based on 38 reviews, and an average rating of 2.3/10.

===African Americans===

Apart from telling their own Tales of African American gangsters in syndicates, films like Black Caesar feature the Italian mafia prominently. Often the blaxploitation stories of the seventies tell the tale of African American gangsters rising up and defeating the established white criminal order.

==Japan and the Yakuza==
{{main|Yakuza film}}
Early films about the [[Yakuza]] revolved around pre-war notions of honor and loyalty.  These ''ninkyo eiga'' (chivalry films) were replaced in the late 1960s and early 1970s by a new style, pioneered by [[Kinji Fukasaku]] and inspired by the [[French New Wave]] and American [[Film noir]] called ''Jitsuroku eiga'' (true record films).&lt;ref name="Sharp2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=Jasper|title=Historical Dictionary of Japanese Cinema|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oAYsyZRRqzcC|accessdate=27 June 2017|date=13 October 2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-8108-7541-8|pages=64–65|chapter=Fukasaku Shinji}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new style is considered to have begun with Fukasaku's ''[[Battles Without Honor and Humanity]]'' (1972), a violent, realistic portrayal of post-war gangs in the ruins of [[Hiroshima]].  In addition to Fukasaku's "shaky camera style", this new brand of film often adapted true stories.

Prior to ''Battles'', the films of [[Seijun Suzuki]] had departed from the ''ninkyo eiga'' formula, but had met with limited commercial success.  Although, Suzuki's ''[[Branded to Kill]]'' would later inspire other directors in the gangster film genre, including [[John Woo]], [[Chan-wook Park]] and [[Quentin Tarantino]].&lt;ref name="Princess Raccoon"&gt;{{cite news

The Hong Kong gangster film genre began with 1986's ''[[A Better Tomorrow]]'', directed by [[John Woo]] and starring [[Chow Yun Fat]].&lt;ref name="Nochimson2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martha Nochimson|title=Dying to Belong: Gangster Movies in Hollywood and Hong Kong|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VJLz4A9j5tYC|accessdate=3 July 2017|date=21 May 2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-4051-6370-5|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Woo's tale of counterfeiters portrays a gangster who balances "Kung Fu honor" and the materialistic goals of the Triads.&lt;ref name="Nochimson2007"/&gt;  It was the all-time biggest grossing Hong Kong film at the box office and was critically acclaimed.  Woo would follow with a string of successes, including ''[[The Killer (1989 film)|The Killer]]'', ''[[Bullet in the Head]]'', and ''[[Hard Boiled]]''.

'''Harvey Brian Lisberg''' (born 2 March 1940) is an English music and sporting manager and impresario, best known for discovering [[Herman's Hermits]] in 1963&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Herman's Hermits|url=http://harveylisberg.com/hermans-hermits/|website=Harvey Lisberg – website}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1965, he signed songwriter [[Graham Gouldman]],&lt;ref name="Gouldman"&gt;{{cite web|title=Graham Gouldman induction (June 2014)|url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C6072|website=Songwriters Hall of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt; a founder member of [[10cc]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beta|first1=Andy|title=10cc's "I'm Not In Love" Was The Real Song Of The Summer|url=http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/10ccs-im-not-in-love-was-the-real-song-of-the-summer-1637590430/all|website=The Concourse|date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who Lisberg also managed, along with [[Godley &amp; Creme]], [[Tony Christie]], [[Barclay James Harvest]], [[Gordon Giltrap]], [[Sad Cafe (band)|Sad Café]], [[Wax (UK band)|Wax]] and others.  Lisberg still oversees Gouldman's artistic endeavours, and nurtures new talent.

==Early life==
Harvey Lisberg was a war baby, born in [[Manchester]], UK, to Violet (née Sternberg) and Judah Lisberg, into a Jewish family.  His father joined the British Army at the beginning of World War II, and served in North Africa and Italy until 1945.  Mother and son evacuated to [[Blackpool]] for the duration of the war, and Lisberg was five years old when he first spoke with his father.  Reunited, they returned to Manchester, and young Lisberg was sent to Jewish Day School, before transferring to [[Carmel College (Oxfordshire)|Carmel College]] in [[Oxfordshire]], where he was the youngest boarder at school.  He ran away three times, once getting as far as London on a penny [[platform ticket]], and struck a deal with headmaster, [[Kopul Rosen]], who let him off as long as he did not run away again.  At age eleven, Lisberg attended [[Salford Grammar School]], graduating in July 1962 as a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in Commerce from the [[University of Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Credentials|url=http://harveylisberg.com/credentails/|website=Harvey Lisberg website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport management==
Lisberg was always interested in sport, particularly [[association football|football]].  In the 1960s, he managed [[Fred Pickering]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Neil|title=Fred Pickering|url=http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/player/fredpickering.html|website=Post War English &amp; Scottish Football League: A – Z Player's Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he played for both [[Everton F.C.]] and the [[England national football team]].

In the 1970s, he managed [[England national under-21 football team|England Under-21]] player, [[Gary Owen (footballer)|Gary Owen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Neil|title=Gary Owen|url=http://www.neilbrown.newcastlefans.com/player/garyowen.html|website=Post War English &amp; Scottish Football League: A – Z Player's Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; negotiating his transfer from [[Manchester City F.C.]] to [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.]] with [[Ron Atkinson]], for what was then a substantial fee.

Lisberg oversaw the production of several football-related songs, some recorded at [[Strawberry Studios]], and performed and/or written by future members of [[10cc]], e.g. ''Boys in Blue'' (1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boys in Blue (Manchester City)|url=http://www.fcsongs.com/Manchester_City_FC_-_The_Boys_in_Blue.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''For Ever Everton'' (1972),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sawyer|first1=Rob|title=Forever Everton – The Story of a Song|url=http://toffeeweb.com/season/12-13/comment/editorial/24188.html|website=ToffeeWeb|date=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Willie Morgan on the Wing'' (1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vallantine|first1=Stuart|title=Willie Morgan on the Wing|url=http://panicingranadaland.tumblr.com/post/22205099114/strawberry-bubblegum-1-willie-morgan-on-the}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent football songs are ''Shearer Shearer'' (1996),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shearer Shearer|url=http://harveylisberg.com/football-songs/|publisher=ffwd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''United City Calypso'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dawson|first1=Rob|title=Video: Calypso king Harvey's song to celebrate Manchester City and United|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/video-calypso-king-harveys-song-868741|publisher=[[Manchester Evening News]]|date=11 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring Lisberg himself as the artist parodying [[Lord Kitchener (calypsonian)|Lord Kitchener]]'s classic ‘City and United 1956 – The Manchester Football Double’,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calypso Collected Part 1|url=http://www.footballandmusic.co.uk/calypso-collected-part-1/|website=Football and Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; to celebrate the next Manchester football double in 2011, when [[Manchester United F.C.]] and [[Manchester City F.C.]] won the [[Premier League]] and the [[FA Cup]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manchester revels in FA Cup final &amp; Premier League joy|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/13401504|work=BBC Sport|date=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Lisberg ventured into the [[snooker]] world; by signing [[Jimmy White]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jimmy White|url=http://harveylisberg.com/jimmy-white/|website=Harvey Lisberg – website}}&lt;/ref&gt; who he helped mould into the people's champion.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Jimmy|title=Behind The White Ball|publisher=Arrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lisberg arranged a complete [[makeover]] for White: with a new permed hairstyle, French designer clothes, and a photo session with [[Patrick Anson, 5th Earl of Lichfield|Patrick Lichfield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lichfield|title=Jimmy White – photograph|url=http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/jimmy-white-british-snooker-player-9th-november-1981-news-photo/118618492|publisher=gettyimages|date=8 November 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About his move into snooker, Lisberg said "Snooker just had a magic at the time I came into it, around '81.  I got more publicity in six weeks representing Jimmy White than in twenty years representing world superstars.  Snooker was like the pop music of the 'sixties, and the players were stars in their own right".&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;

Within months, he had added White's good friend and idol, [[Alex Higgins]], to a stable of players that would later include [[Tony Knowles (snooker player)|Tony Knowles]], [[John Virgo]], [[David Taylor (snooker player)|David Taylor]] and [[Willie Thorne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hennessey|first1=John|title=The Eye of the Hurricane: The Alex Higgins Story|publisher=Mainstream Publishing Company (Edinburgh) Ltd|isbn=1 84018 385 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1985, Lisberg decided to abandon his snooker interests after White defected to another manager in breach of contract.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;

==Music management==
In 1963, Lisberg was a trainee at accountants [[Binder Hamlyn]] (now known as BDO International) when he discovered [[Herman's Hermits]] at a church hall in [[Davyhulme]].  By early 1964, he was their co-manager, and approached E.M.I.'s Derek Everett,&lt;ref name="Music Week"&gt;{{cite web|title=Industry veteran Everett dies|url=http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/industry-veteran-everett-dies/034095|publisher=[[Music Week]]|date=13 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; who suggested producer [[Mickie Most]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Most|first1=Mickie|title=Obituary – Pop Producer with an Ear for Hit Songs|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/pop-producer-with-an-ear-for-hit-songs-1.361813|publisher=The Irish Times|date=7 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; who in turn agreed to work with the band after seeing them perform in [[Bolton]] on a prepaid return air ticket from Lisberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eder|first1=Bruce|title=About Herman's Hermits|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/hermans-hermits/biography/|website=MTV|publisher=Viacom International Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon signed to [[EMI]], their first single was the [[Gerry Goffin]] and [[Carole King]] composition, ''[[I'm Into Something Good]]'' (with B-side ''Your Hand in Mine'', co-written by Lisberg),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvey Lisberg – Credentials|url=http://harveylisberg.com/credentails/}}&lt;/ref&gt; which went to Number 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK charts]] in September/October 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Charts Company|date=26 September 1964|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/archive-chart/_/1/1964-09-26/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[George Tremlett]] put it in his book ''The 10cc Story'':&lt;ref name="Tremlett"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Tremlett|title=The 10cc Story|year=1976|isbn=0-86007-378-5|publisher=Futura}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|And so began the career of Herman's Hermits, with Harvey Lisberg as their manager and Mickie Most, their producer.  "It was a three-way relationship that lasted nine or ten years", said Harvey.  During their years together in the Sixties the group's success was little short of phenomenal, and initially not far behind that of The Beatles.  In Britain, Herman's Hermits had fifteen hit singles.  In the United States alone, they sold over 40,000,000 records – with one single, "Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter", staying at number one for [three] weeks and grossing sales of over 3,000,000 copies.  Of their six LPs, five were awarded Gold Discs.  Herman also appeared in three film musicals.}}

In autumn 1964, Lisberg enlisted Graham Gouldman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brodsky|first1=Greg|title='For Your Love' and 'Bus Stop' Writer, Graham Gouldman|url=http://bestclassicbands.com/for-your-love-bus-stop-writer-graham-gouldman-10-16-15/|website=Best Classic Bands}}&lt;/ref&gt; to write songs at his office for a modest weekly retainer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=Paul|title=10cc's Graham Gouldman on recording in Stockport and life in Mottram St. Andrew|url=http://www.cheshirelife.co.uk/out-about/10cc_s_graham_gouldman_on_recording_in_stockport_and_life_in_mottram_st_andrew_1_3638508|publisher=Cheshire Life | date=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first endeavour, "[[For Your Love]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=For Your Love|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1170|publisher=Songfacts}}&lt;/ref&gt; was rejected as a Herman's Hermits single by Mickie Most. Lisberg then tried to get the song heard by [[The Beatles]] when they were playing the [[Hammersmith Odeon]], and via Ronnie Beck was introduced to the support act's manager, [[Giorgio Gomelsky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strausbaugh|first1=John|last2=Tabb|first2=George|title=Having a Rave Up with Giorgio Gomelsky: From the Beatles and Stones to the Internet, He Keeps Rocking|url=http://nypress.com/having-a-rave-up-with-giorgio-gomelsky-from-the-beatles-and-stones-to-the-internet-he-keeps-rocking|publisher=New York Press | date=26 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; who placed it with his band [[The Yardbirds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lifton|first1=Dave|title=50 Years Ago: Jeff Beck replaces Eric Clapton in The Yardbirds|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/eric-clapton-quits-yardbirds/|website=Ultimate Classic Rock}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peaking in February 1965 at No. 3 in the UK charts and reaching No. 6 in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], the song literally broke The Yardbirds, since it also signaled the departure of lead guitarist, [[Eric Clapton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eric Clapton Biography|url=http://www.ericclapton.com/eric-clapton-biography?page=0%2C1|website=www.ericclapton.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1965, Gouldman penned two more hit songs for The Yardbirds, namely "[[Heart Full of Soul]]", whose title was conceived by Lisberg, and "[[Evil Hearted You]]".  Under Lisberg's wing Gouldman's output proliferated with a string of hit singles for various artistes such as "[[Look Through Any Window]]" and "[[Bus Stop (song)|Bus Stop]]" for [[The Hollies]], "Pamela Pamela" for [[Wayne Fontana]], and before long even Mickie Most capitulated by releasing a total of three Gouldman-written hit singles for Herman's Hermits namely "[[Listen People]]", "[[No Milk Today]]" and "East West", which was later covered (with new lyrics inserted in the third verse)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morrissey's Lyrics - East West|url=http://www.passionsjustlikemine.com/lyrics/moz-ew.htm|website=Passions Just Like Mine}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Morrissey]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morrissey's Rarest B-Sides|url=http://theanalogkidblog.com/2013/12/19/morrisseys-rarest-b-sides-part-1/|website=The Analog Kid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stellar successes of Herman's Hermits and Gouldman seduced Lisberg into making music management his full-time job.&lt;ref name="Tremlett"/&gt;  In the mid-1960s he joined forces with Danny Betesh and took a 50 per cent stake in Kennedy Street Enterprises,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kennedy Street Enterprises|url=http://www.kennedystreet.com/|website=Kennedy Street}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had promoted The Beatles' first tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilde|first1=Paul|title=The Beatles in Manchester|url=http://www.thebeatlesinmanchester.co.uk/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between April and May 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bunch|first1=Will|title=50 years ago, the Stones rolled into Philly|url=http://articles.philly.com/2015-05-01/news/61727569_1_rolling-stones-hermits-little-anthony|website=philly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a hat-trick of Manchester-based acts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Christian|first1=Terry|title=From Gladchester Through Madchester, 50 Years of Manchester Music|url=http://www.terrychristian.tv/from-gladchester-through-madchester-50-years-of-manchester-music/|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; all Kennedy Street artistes, enjoyed an unprecedented consecutive six week spell at No. 1 on the US [[Hot 100]], with [[Freddie and the Dreamers]] spending two weeks at the top with "[[I'm Telling You Now]]" (10–24 April), [[The Mindbenders|Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders]] one week with "[[The Game of Love (Wayne Fontana song)|Game of Love]]" (24 April-1 May), and then Herman's Hermits a further three weeks with "[[Mrs. Brown, You've Got a Lovely Daughter]]" (1–22 May).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Billboard Hot 100 Singles |url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1965-04-24/hot-100|work=Billboard | date=24 April 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisberg spent much of his early career globe-trotting with Herman's Hermits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meeting Elvis in Hawaii|url=http://harveylisberg.com/meeting-elvis/}}&lt;/ref&gt; who capitalized on a string of hits in the US and later in the UK, but he also represented acts such as Little Frankie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Writing Work – Graham Gouldman|url=http://www.grahamgouldman.info/singer-songwriter/discography/writing-work/|website=Graham Gouldman Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Herd (UK band)|The Herd]], The Measles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Measles formed in 1964 ...|url=http://www.britishmusicarchive.com/E/184-elli/songs|publisher=British Music Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric Woolfson]], The Mockingbirds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mockingbirds on Manchester Beat|url=http://www.manchesterbeat.com/groups/mockingbirds/mockingbirds.php|publisher=manchesterbeat}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Paul Joans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=There was this fella called John...|url=http://watertowerproject.blogspot.co.uk/2014_06_01_archive.html|publisher=The Water Tower Project | date=28 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Julie Driscoll]].  Always particularly interested in the song, he signed up an array of singer/songwriters such as [[Harvey Andrews]], Peter Cowap,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Society (feat. Pete Cowap)|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/tf771|publisher=45cat – Vinyl Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barry Greenfield,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barry Greenfield – Biography|url=http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/barrygreenfield|publisher=CDBaby}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark T.

In the mid-1960s, the then unknown songwriters [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]] approached Lisberg in the hope that he would place a new song titled "[[Any Dream Will Do (song)|Any Dream Will Do]]" with Herman's Hermits. The song was rejected by Mickie Most as a Herman's Hermits single, but Lisberg nevertheless signed the duo to a development deal when he heard their sketches for a musical called ''[[Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat]]''.&lt;ref name="Rogan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogan|first1=Johnny|title=Starmakers &amp; Svengalis|publisher=Macdonald Queen Anne Press|isbn=0-356-15138-7|pages=172–181}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time there were no takers for the sketches, but the show, which morphed into a pop [[cantata]] written for schools and then became a [[concept album]] before being staged on the [[West End theatre|West End]] and later as a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production, has since exceeded all original expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kroll|first1=Justin|title=Elton John to Produce Animated 'Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat'|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/elton-john-joseph-animated-1201086705/|work=Variety|date=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Tim Rice|Sir Tim Rice]] put it:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rice|first=Tim|title=Harvey Lisberg website|url=http://harveylisberg.com/credentails/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Harvey was one of the very first to recognise potential in Andrew Lloyd Webber and myself but he was probably too far ahead of his time in this regard as we were still a year or so away from making our own mark in the music industry.

Lisberg managed Wayne Fontana after he left the Mindbenders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders|url=http://britishinvasionbands.com/the-bands/wayne-fontana-and-the-mindbenders/|website=British Invasion Bands}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing guitarist [[Eric Stewart]] to step-up to lead vocals on "[[A Groovy Kind of Love]]", which reached No. 2 in the UK and US in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Groovy Kind Of Love by The Mindbenders|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=27|website=Songfacts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stewart's [[The Mindbenders|Mindbenders]] appeared in [[To Sir, With Love]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMDb Trivia – To Sir, With Love|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062376/trivia|publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Sidney Poitier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Isidora|first1=Morales|title=To Sir With Love – Ladies Choice|url=http://elblogdelupi.com/music/to-sir-with-love-ladies-choice|website=El Blog De Lupi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released a few singles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mindbenders Singles|url=http://tencc.fan-site.net/mbsingle.html|website=Tencc Fan Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; two of which were written by Gouldman who later joined the band on bass until it folded in mid-1968, liberating Stewart to focus on developing Strawberry Studios which he co-founded with Peter Tattersall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strawberry Recording Studios|url=http://www.strawberrynorth.co.uk/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lisberg procured a deal for Gouldman to move to New York and write songs for [[Super K Productions]], the 'bubblegum' hit factory owned by [[Jerry Kasenetz]] and [[Jeff Katz]].  This was later reworked allowing Gouldman to return for a few months to record at Strawberry Studios providing both money and kudos for the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernarde|first1=Scott R|title=Stars of David|publisher=Brandeis University Press|isbn=1-58465-303-5|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Gouldman acquired a third of the shares in Strawberry and soon Kennedy Street would also become a stakeholder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Another Memphis – Just For The Record|url=http://www.strawberrynorth.co.uk/articlesdailymail1968.htm|publisher=Daily Mail (19 December 1968)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if the [[Strawberry Bubblegum: A Collection of Pre-10CC Strawberry Studio Recordings 1969–1972|''Strawberry Bubblegum'']] sessions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Dave|title=Strawberry Bubblegum|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/strawberry-bubblegum-a-collection-of-pre-10cc-strawberry-studio-recordings-1969-1972-mw0000459960|publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; didn't yield much memorable musical output,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Dave|title=10cc: A Pure Injection of Pop|url=http://www.the10ccfanclub.com/htm/injection005.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; they did bring Stewart, Gouldman, Godley and Creme together on various polyonymous pre-10cc vinyl incarnations, made in their own studio in provincial [[Stockport]], UK, a new destination for international artists from [[Neil Sedaka]] to [[Joy Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mitchell|first1=Pete|title=Without 10cc the Manchester revolution might not have happened|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2014-05-24/pete-mitchell-without-10cc-the-manchester-revolution-may-not-have-happened|work=Radio Times | date=24 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, as a sonic experiment to test a 4-track Ampex recording desk, Stewart, Godley and Creme recorded "[[Neanderthal Man (song)|Neanderthal Man]]" which was released as a single under the name of [[Hotlegs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neanderthal Man – Hotlegs|url=http://www.discogs.com/Hotlegs-Neanderthal-Man/release/2884482|work=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song became an international smash hit and sold over 2 million copies worldwide, reaching No. 22 in the US, No. 2 in the UK and topping the charts in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Dave|title=Hotlegs – Biography|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/303628/hotlegs/biography|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hotlegs put out an album ''[[Thinks: School Stinks]]'' (which inspired [[Alice Cooper]]'s ''[[School's Out (album)|School's Out]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robbins|first1=Darren|title=Song of the Day: Hotlegs "Neanderthal Man"|url=http://superiorshit.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/song-of-day-hotlegs-neanderthal-man.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as both [[Crazy Elephant]] and [[Doctor Father]], the single "Umbopo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wills|first1=Robin|title=My Version is better than Yours: Crazy Elephant vs. Doctor Father – (There Ain't No) Umbopo|url=http://purepop1uk.blogspot.co.uk/2009/04/my-version-is-better-than-yours-part-9.html|work=PurePop}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time, Lisberg had already agreed to be Tony Christie's manager after seeing him perform at an awards ceremony in [[Winter Gardens, Blackpool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parkin|first1=S|title=Interview:Tony Christie|url=http://www.eveningnews24.co.uk/what-s-on/music/interview_tony_christie_1_888145|work=Norwich Evening News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lisberg secured a record deal with [[MCA Records]] and introduced Christie to [[Mitch Murray]] and [[Peter Callander]], the successful songwriting and production duo.  Christie's first two hits were the Murray and Callander compositions "Las Vegas" and "[[I Did What I Did for Maria]]", which respectively peaked at numbers 21 and 2 in the UK singles chart, but a follow-up third single was lacking.  On a business trip to New York in mid-1971, Lisberg approached Neil Sedaka's publisher [[Don Kirshner]] in search of a new gem, and when Sedaka tapped out "[[(Is This the Way to) Amarillo?]]" on piano, Lisberg knew he had found Christie's third hit record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Black|first1=Johnny|title=It's Time For Tony|url=http://issuu.com/musicweek/docs/tonychristie1|work=Music Week | date=29 January 2011 | pages=31–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neil Sedaka]] explained in a 2009 interview:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thrills|first1=Adrian|title=As Neil Sedaka hits the road again at 70, he vows to bop until he drops|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/reviews/article-1194025/As-Neil-Sedaka-hits-road-70-vows-bop-drops.html|work=The Daily Mail | date=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|It was originally a rough demo on a cassette. Tony Christie's manager came to see me, saying he had a new singer who sounded a bit like Tom Jones.  I played him "Amarillo" and he immediately liked it.}}

In late 1971, "Amarillo" was a huge European hit and soon became Christie's signature tune, but it rose no higher than number 18 in the UK.  It lay dormant for more than three decades until it was [[lip sync]]ed as a video by UK comedian [[Peter Kay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(Is This The Way To) Amarillo|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=16056|publisher=Songfacts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some celebrity friends for the 2005 [[Comic Relief]] charity drive.  The original Tony Christie single was the biggest hit in the UK in 2005 holding on to the No. 1 spot for seven weeks and still remains one of the few [[List of million-selling singles in the United Kingdom|singles in the UK to have sold over 1 million records]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sedghi|first1=Ami|title=UK's million-selling singles: the full list|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/nov/04/uk-million-selling-singles-full-list|work=The Guardian | date=4 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1972, after the success of "Amarillo", Lisberg convinced [[Neil Sedaka]] to record some new compositions at Strawberry Studios using Eric Stewart to engineer the recordings with Graham Gouldman, Kevin Godley and Lol Creme as session musicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Keeling|first1=Neil|title=Neil Sedaka is back and ready to mix old and new music on autumn tour|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/neil-sedaka-back-ready-mix-6902993|publisher=Manchester Evening News | date=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedaka initially agreed to record only three songs but in the event he put down a whole album in just two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Danny|title=Graham Gouldman: 10cc revived Neil Sedaka's career|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01r934h|website=www.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC – The Danny Baker Show | date=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The album, [[Solitaire (Neil Sedaka album)|''Solitaire'']], marked Sedaka's comeback after a 10-year absence, and the title song was a top five hit for [[Andy Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solitaire|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search-results-album/_/solitaire|publisher=UK Official Charts Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1973, Sedaka revisited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wadsworth|first1=Peter|title=10cc and Sedaka in 1973 at Strawberry Recording Studios|url=http://www.mdmarchive.co.uk/artefact.php?&amp;aid=6628&amp;vid=336|publisher=Manchester District Music Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Strawberry team to record his album ''[[The Tra-La Days Are Over]]'' featuring "[[Love Will Keep Us Together]]", whose title is sardonically referenced by antithesis in [[Joy Division]]'s 1980's Strawberry Studios' recorded classic, "[[Love Will Tear Us Apart]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tatangelo|first1=Wade|title=Neil Sedaka and the power of 'love'|url=http://www.ticketsarasota.com/2013/12/30/neil-sedaka-at-van-wezel-sarasota/|work=Herald Tribune | date=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After supporting [[The Moody Blues]] on tour as [[Hotlegs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hotlegs: Tour Dates|url=http://www.songkick.com/artists/325225-hotlegs|publisher=Songkick}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their acclaimed work as studio band for [[Ramases]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stormare|first1=Peter|title=Ramases: Collected and Celebrated|url=http://psychedelicsight.com/ramases-cd-box-set/|publisher=Psychedelic Sight}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasenetz-Katz, [[Neil Sedaka]] and others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Warner|first1=Tom|title=Hotlegs – Thinks School Stinks|url=http://accelerateddecrepitude.blogspot.co.uk/2011/12/hotlegs-thinks-school-stinks.html|publisher=Accelerated Decrepitude}}&lt;/ref&gt; the four session musicians decided to pool their talents as a unit.  In 1972, they signed to [[Jonathan King]]'s [[UK Records]] label, who named the band 10cc releasing two albums, [[10cc (album)|''10cc'']] (1973),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ofjord|first1=Michael|title=10cc|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/10cc-mw0000311059|publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sheet Music (album)|''Sheet Music'']] (1974),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Dave|title=Sheet Music|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/sheet-music-mw0000317352|work=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; which featured five UK hit singles, "[[Donna (10cc song)|Donna]]" – No. 2, "[[Rubber Bullets]]" – No. 1, "[[The Dean and I]]" – No. 10, "[[The Wall Street Shuffle]]" – No. 10 and "Silly Love" – No. 24.  The band satirized its small royalty in "4% of Something",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10cc – 4% of Something (Lyrics)|url=http://artists.letssingit.com/10cc-lyrics-4-of-something-gl15xk6|website=Let's Sing It}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lisberg tried to leverage the band's success by renegotiating but UK Records was intransigent.  In 1975, for a big advance and fair royalty, 10cc left [[UK Records]] and moved to [[Phonogram Records|Phonogram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Sharon|title=Every Chart Topper Tells a Story: The Seventies|date=1998|publisher=Mainstream Publishing|isbn=185158837X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 Godley &amp; Creme left 10cc,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lester|first1=Paul|title=10cc – 'It was a tragedy we didn't stay together'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/nov/22/10cc-tragedy-didnt-stay-together|work=The Guardian | date=22 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Use British English|date=October 2012}} to record a [[concept album]] featuring [[Peter Cook]] and [[Sarah Vaughan]], to showcase their invention '[[the Gizmo]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Booth|first1=Giles|url=http://www.suppertime.co.uk/blint/|title=Mr Blint's Attic|website=Consequences}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The triple album boxed-set was called [[Consequences (Godley &amp; Creme album)|''Consequences'']] (1977),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guarisco|first1=Donald A|title=Consequences|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/consequences-mw0000112333|publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now a collector's item. Lisberg reflected:&lt;ref name="Rogan"/&gt;

{{cquote|They were great, brilliant, innovative – and what did they do?  A triple album that goes on forever.}}

In 1977, Stewart and Gouldman released 10cc's ''[[Deceptive Bends]]'' album,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guarisco|first1=Donald A|title=Deceptive Bends|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/deceptive-bends-mw0000654689|publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; with singles "[[The Things We Do for Love (song)|The Things We Do for Love]]" peaking at No. 2 in the UK and No. 5 in the US followed by "[[Good Morning Judge]]" going top 5 in the UK The 1978 ''[[Bloody Tourists]]'' album&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guarisco|first1=Donald A|title=Bloody Tourists|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bloody-tourists-mw0000453655|publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; featured their best selling and final No. 1 single, "[[Dreadlock Holiday]]", later used in the 2010 [[Mark Zuckerberg]] biopic ''[[The Social Network]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Social Network – Caribbean Night|url=http://teas-star.com/x/the-social-network-caribbean-night/|publisher=Teas-Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; but "[t]he 10cc hit machine effectively ground to a halt when Eric Stewart was involved in a car crash in January 1979".&lt;ref name="Rogan"/&gt;

After hearing their demo tape in early 1977 and declaring the group chart certainties, Lisberg decided to manage [[Sad Cafe (band)|Sad Café]] who he placed with RCA Records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beaufoy|first1=R|title=Sad Cafe Biography|url=http://www.geocities.ws/rbeaufoy/sadcafe.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The band achieved only moderate commercial success with the first two albums, [[Fanx Tara|''Fanx Ta Ra'']] (1977) and ''Misplaced Ideals'' (1978), but Lisberg persuaded RCA to recruit Eric Stewart as producer for the third album, ''Façades'' (an anagram of 'Sad Cafe'), which yielded three top 40 singles with "[[Every Day Hurts]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Every Day Hurts – Sad Café|url=http://www.discogs.com/Sad-Caf%C3%A9-Every-Day-Hurts/release/1896353|publisher=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching No. 3 in the UK in September 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laing|first1=Dave|title=Obituary: Paul Young – Singer who made Manchester rock|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jul/19/guardianobituaries|work=The Guardian | date=19 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Lisberg approached [[David Hemmings]] who was raising funds for a film featuring [[Joan Collins]] and starring [[Farrah Fawcett]], and put forward Graham Gouldman to write and record the title song, [[Sunburn (film)|Sunburn]], which became a minor hit single for him in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gouldman|first1=Graham|title=Sunburn|url=http://www.discogs.com/Graham-Gouldman-Sunburn/release/1409963|publisher=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intrigued by the concept and his similar name, Lisberg approached [[Steven Lisberger]] for Gouldman to write and record the [[Animalympics soundtrack|soundtrack]] for his animated film [[Animalympics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gouldman|first1=Graham|title=Animalympics|url=http://www.discogs.com/Graham-Gouldman-Animalympics-Music-From-The-Original-Motion-Picture-Soundtrack/release/1050728|publisher=Discogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; but commercial success was impeded by the US led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spence|first1=L.J.|title=His And Hers Movie Reviews|url=http://hisandhersmovieblog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/lj-spence-starting-points-animalympics.html|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Records|Warner Brothers Records]] negotiated with Lisberg for Graham Gouldman to produce the [[Ramones]] album ''[[Pleasant Dreams]]'', and oversaw the US release of 10cc's seventh album ''[[Look Hear?]]'' (1980)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Dave|title=Look Hear|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/look-hear-mw0000564528|publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their eighth, ''[[Ten Out of 10]]'' (1981),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schnee|first1=Steve|title=Ten Out of 10|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/10-out-of-10-mw0000554838|publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; which,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gold|first1=Andrew|title="commonknowledge.com" liner notes|url=http://www.andrewgold.com/liner%20notes/CommonKnowledge.pdf|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Lenny Waronker]]'s instigation debuted [[Andrew Gold]] as co-writer and guest musician on three tracks including their only 1980's UK top 50 hit [[Run Away (10cc song)|Run Away]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Run Away (10cc)|url=http://www.vagalume.com.br/10cc/run-away.html|work=Vagalume}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gold declined Stewart and Gouldman's invitation to join 10cc for their ninth album, ''[[Windows in the Jungle]]'' (1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schnee|first1=Steve|title=Windows in the Jungle|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/windows-in-the-jungle-mw0000772623|publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When 10cc disbanded in 1983, Gouldman and Gold reconnected and formed Wax who signed to [[RCA Records|RCA]] for three albums, ''[[Magnetic Heaven]]'' (1986), ''[[American English (album)|American English]]'' (1987) and ''A Hundred Thousand in Fresh Notes'' (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Andrew Gold – Obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8564373/Andrew-Gold.html|publisher=The Telegraph | date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wax achieved success on both sides of the Atlantic when "Right Between The Eyes"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Right Between The Eyes|url=http://www.vagalume.com.br/wax/right-between-the-eyes.html|publisher=Vagalume}}&lt;/ref&gt; reached No.43 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart in 1986 and "[[Bridge to Your Heart]]" peaked at No.12 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in July 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bridge To Your Heart – Lyrics|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/bridge-to-your-heart-lyrics-wax.html#/startvideo|website=Metrolyrics}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lisberg placed "Alright Tonight" in [[Burglar (film)|Burglar]], starring [[Whoopi Goldberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burglar (1987) - Soundtrack|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/18320/Burglar/music.html|publisher=Turner Classic Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Godley and Creme became pioneering music video producers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Trevor|title=Re-play: Trevor Jackson on the Influence of Audio/Visual Pioneers Godley &amp; Creme|url=http://www.thevinylfactory.com/vinyl-factory-releases/re-play-trevor-jackson-on-the-influence-of-audiovisual-pioneers-godley-creme/|website=The Vinyl Factory}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also released six albums of their own,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Godley &amp; Creme|url=http://www.mtv.com/artists/godley-creme/|website=MTV Artists|publisher=Viacom}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted by the hit singles "[[Under Your Thumb]]" – No. 3, "[[Wedding Bells (Godley &amp; Creme song)|Wedding Bells]]" – No. 7 and the iconic "[[Cry (Godley &amp; Creme song)|Cry]]" – their only US top 20 hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levy|first1=Glen|title=The 30 All-TIME Best Music Videos|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2011/07/28/the-30-all-time-best-music-videos/slide/godley-and-creme-cry-1985/|publisher=Time Inc. | date=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1987, Lisberg colluded with Brian Berg of [[Polydor Records|Polydor]] to reunite the two camps on one compilation which manifested as ''[[Changing Faces – The Very Best of 10cc and Godley &amp; Creme]]'', the best-selling 10cc album to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10cc and Godley &amp; Creme – Changing Faces – The Very Best of|url=http://hitparade.ch/album/10cc-and-Godley-&amp;-Creme/Changing-Faces-The-Very-Best-Of-139417|website=hitparade.ch|publisher=Hung Medien}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Godley and Creme themselves split up in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eder|first1=Bruce|title=Lol Creme – Biography|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/1521482/lol-creme/biography|publisher=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''Changing Faces'' prompted Polydor to ask for another album featuring all four original band members which was delivered, in a diluted form, with 10cc's tenth album, ''[[...Meanwhile|Meanwhile]]'' (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Dave|title=Meanwhile|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/meanwhile-mw0000784492|work=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A few years later, [[Avex Group|Avex]], the biggest independent record label in Japan, commissioned and released 10cc's final album, [[Mirror Mirror (10cc album)|''Mirror Mirror'']] (1995),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parisien|first1=Roch|title=Mirror Mirror|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/mirror-mirror-mw0000126361|work=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; with co-writes from [[Paul McCartney|Sir Paul McCartney]] on "Yvonne's The One" (Stewart/McCartney),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nat|first1=Happy|title=Beatles Rarity of the Week – "Yvonne" Out-Take|url=http://www.thebeatlesrarity.com/2013/11/18/beatles-rarity-of-the-week-yvonne-out-take/|website=The Beatles Rarity}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tim Rice|Sir Tim Rice]] on "The Monkey and the Onion" (Rice/Gouldman).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Monkey and The Onion – 10cc|url=http://artists.letssingit.com/10cc-lyrics-the-monkey-and-the-onion-w8tj2m7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s Lisberg sold out his 50 per cent stake in Kennedy Street and now splits his time between the USA and the UK. He still represents Gouldman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Graham Gouldman|url=http://harveylisberg.com/graham-gouldman/|website=Harvey Lisberg – website}}&lt;/ref&gt; and works on a few selected music-related projects.

'''Hitchcockian''' films are those made by various filmmakers, with the styles and themes similar to those of [[Alfred Hitchcock]].

==Characteristics==
Elements considered Hitchcockian include:

*Climactic plot twist.
*The cool [[Platinum blonde hair|platinum blonde]]&lt;!--(often a central figure of Hitchcock's films)--&gt;.
*The presence of a [[Oedipus complex|domineering mother]] in someone's life
*An innocent man accused&lt;!--(again used in many of Hitchcock's films)--&gt;.
*Restricting the action to a single setting to increase tension (e.g. ''[[Lifeboat (film)|Lifeboat]]'', ''[[Rear Window]]'', ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'').
*Characters who switch sides and/or who cannot be trusted.
*Tension building through suspense to the point where the audience enjoys seeing the character in a life-threatening situation (e.g. ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'', the windmill scene in ''[[Foreign Correspondent (film)|Foreign Correspondent]]'').
*Average people thrust into strange or dangerous situations (e.g. ''[[North by Northwest]]'', ''[[The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956 film)|The Man Who Knew Too Much]]'').
*Bumbling or incompetent authority figures, particularly police officers.
*Use of darkness to symbolize impending doom (dark clothing, shadows, smoke, etc.)
*Strong visual use of famous landmarks ([[Statue of Liberty]], [[Mount Rushmore]], [[Forth Rail Bridge]], [[Golden Gate Bridge]], [[Albert Hall]], [[British Museum]], [[Piccadilly Circus]], etc.)
*Mistaken identity (e.g. ''[[North by Northwest]]'', ''[[The Wrong Man]]'').
*The use of a staircase as a motif for impending danger or suspense.
*Use of a [[macguffin]] [[plot device]] (one that remains unexplained (e.g. the [[microfilm]] in ''[[North by Northwest]]'')).
*Referring to crime for mystery rather than presenting it explicitly (e.g. ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'', ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'').

It is loosely based on [[Adam Rex]]'s 2007 children's book ''[[The True Meaning of Smekday]]'' and stars the voices of [[Jim Parsons]], [[Rihanna]], [[Steve Martin]], [[Jennifer Lopez]], and [[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]]. [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim Johnson]] is the director of the film, [[Chris Jenkins (film producer)|Chris Jenkins]] and Suzanne Buirgy are its producers, and the screenplay is by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember. The story takes place on planet [[Earth]], where an alien race called the Boov invade the planet. However, a girl named Tip Tucci manages to avoid capture, and goes on the run with Oh, a fugitive Boov.

The film was released in theaters on March 27, 2015.&lt;ref name=Slate2016 /&gt; ''Home'' was promoted with the release of a four-minute short film titled ''Almost Home'', which was shown in theaters before DreamWorks Animation's ''[[Mr. Peabody &amp; Sherman]]'' and [[Blue Sky Studios]]' ''[[Rio 2]]'' in 2014. It premiered at the [[Boulder International Film Festival]] on March 7, 2015. Besides lending her voice to the film, Rihanna also created a concept album [[Home (soundtrack)|of the same name]]. The soundtrack includes guest vocals from Jennifer Lopez, among others, was supported by two singles, "[[Towards the Sun (song)|Towards the Sun]]" and "[[Feel the Light]]". ''Home'' received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $386 million worldwide. A [[Home: Adventures with Tip &amp; Oh|Netflix original series]] was released on July 29, 2016 that takes place after the events of the film and uses hand-drawn animation and none of the original cast (except Matt Jones) reprised their roles.

==Plot==
On the run from their enemy, the so-called planet-destroying Gorg, an alien race known as the Boov find [[Earth]] a suitable place to call "home". Led by Captain Smek ([[Steve Martin]]), they commence their "friendly" invasion of the planet, relocating the humans, whom the Boov deem as simple and backwards, to other parts of the planet while the Boov inhabit their homes in a quick and [[Bloodless war|bloodless conquest]]. One of the Boov, named Oh ([[Jim Parsons]]), is a more excitable, freethinking member of the species, who decides to invite the Boov to his apartment for a housewarming party, despite the race's [[antipathy]] towards him. Not far from Oh is a fourteen year old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/27/home-tim-johnson_n_6951448.html|title='Home' Director Tim Johnson On The Film's Immigrant Theme And Animating 'Realistic' Bodies|date=March 27, 2015|work=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; girl named Tip Tucci ([[Rihanna]]), who drives away through her home city to find her mother Lucy ([[Jennifer Lopez]]) after being separated from her during the invasion, leaving her with only her [[calico cat]] Pig and fueling her hatred for the Boov.

Oh runs into the street to meet up with a Boov cop named Kyle ([[Matt L. Jones|Matt Jones]]), who, like the rest of the Boov, doesn't want to befriend him. Oh invites him to the party but accidentally sends a mass invite to every Boov on Earth. However, the "send all" button he pressed actually sends the invite to absolutely every alien race in the entire universe including the Gorg. Everyone, aggravated with Oh for revealing their location to the enemy, starts chasing him down. Oh runs into a convenience store to hide just as Tip and Pig enter the same store to grab supplies. They come across each other, and after Tip's car fails to start, Oh transforms it into a fantastical, hovering craft named Slushious to continue transportation. Oh hitches a ride with Tip when he promises to help her find Lucy, but unfortunately, they must go to the Boov Command Center in [[Paris]] and locate her from there.

After reaching the Boov Command Center, which is in the now-floating [[Eiffel Tower]], Oh manages to get into his account, and deletes the message with just a second to spare before it reaches the Gorg. He then plugs in Tip's brain to help her find Lucy. They eventually trace her location to [[Australia]], where she is also looking for her daughter. The other Boov then find the two and try to "erase" Oh, while Tip grabs the gravity manipulation system and flips it over, causing the whole Tower to tilt upside down, hence the two manage to escape.

As Oh and Tip head off to Australia, they are ambushed by other Boov riding by them in fear, and realize that a Gorg ship is close behind them. Tip and Oh manage to knock it down, but in the process a chunk of it hits them and they lose their slushie fuel, causing the car to crash-land. They come across the fallen Gorg ship and find out that it is actually a drone. Oh recovers a special chip and uses it to get their car up and running.

Tip and Oh make it to Australia and see the Boov evacuating to their mothership. When they land the car, Tip immediately starts looking for her mother, but Oh insists on evacuating with the other Boov instead. Tip gets upset at him for trying to break their promise again, and she declares that he was never truly her friend. The depressed Oh returns to the ship. The Gorg mothership comes close to the Boov ship, but Oh pulls out the Gorg chip and uses it to fly the ship further away from the Gorg. The Boov become astonished at Oh's bravery, but Smek becomes upset and reminds everyone that he is the captain. However, Oh stands up to Smek, telling him that he's a terrible captain and tells the Boov about what he learned from Tip about humans caring for other people while the Boov barely even care for each other. Saddened by this revelation at first, the Boovs then [[mutiny]] against Smek and Kyle grabs Smek's "Shusher" (a scepter with a rock on top of it, which Smek stole from the Gorg in a meeting) and gives it to Oh, declaring him the new captain, much to Smek's dismay.

Tip rushes aimlessly around the city to find Lucy, but in vain. Oh returns to her side and helps her track down Lucy. The mother and daughter finally reunite and thank Oh. Suddenly, the Gorg mothership descends upon the planet, and Oh realizes that they want the rock on the Shusher, since Smek had previously stolen it from them. Oh runs to the ship to try to attract its attention, locking Tip and Lucy in the car for safety. Tip breaks out of the car and shines a light in the Gorg Commander ([[Brian Stepanek]])'s face to bring his attention to Oh as he holds the rock up. The Gorg Commander  halts the ship as it crunches down on the ground, with Oh directly in its path. Tip rushes to rescue him, but Oh is seemingly crushed beneath the ship until it backs up and reveals him uninjured. The Gorg Commander emerges from his armor to show that he is actually a harmless [[starfish]]-like creature. Oh returns the rock to him, which turns out to be an egg for millions of developing Gorg larvae; the next generation of Gorg, revealing that the Gorg Commander/"Father" had been the [[Endling|last of his kind]], alone and almost [[extinct]]. He thanks Oh and departs.

Two weeks later, the humans have returned to their original homes, and Oh finally gets to have his party at his apartment, with both humans and Boov in attendance. Tip plays her music and gets the rest of the Boov to experience dancing for the first time, while other Boov, including a reformed Smek, party on the moon, and thousands of ships from other planets, including the Gorg and his babies, head to Earth for Oh's party upon receiving his invite.

'''Hot Tub Cinema''' is a [[film|cinematic]] experience created in 2012.&lt;ref name=goingout&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/film/lovely-bubbly-take-a-dip-at-the-hot-tub-cinema-7917652.html|title=Lovely bubbly: take a dip at the Hot Tub Cinema|work=The Evening Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Created by Asher Charman,&lt;ref name=goingout/&gt; the events combine popular films with [[hot tub]]s, often in unusual spaces such as rooftops, old factories or abandoned train stations (such as the former [[Shoreditch tube station|Shoreditch Underground Station]] in [[Shoreditch]], [[London]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://now-here-this.timeout.com/2014/05/27/hot-tub-cinema-goes-underground/|title=Hot Tub Cinema goes underground|work=Time Out Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to watching a film, cinema-goers have the opportunity to celebrate after the film with a [[VJing|VJ]]-led party.

In addition to shows in London, Hot Tub Cinema events have been held in [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2014/05/09/hot-tub-cinema-series-makes-a-splash-in-brooklyn/|title=Hot Tub Cinema series makes a splash in Brooklyn|work=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibiza]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiza-spotlight.com/night/2014/09/news-hot-tub-cinema-party-ibiza-rocks|title=NEWS - Hot Tub Cinema Party at Ibiza Rocks|work=Ibiza Spotlight}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in several cities around the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Prepare-sequel-Hot-tub-cinema-coming-Bristol/story-26127026-detail/story.html|title=Prepare for the sequel:  Hot tub cinema is coming back to Bristol|work=Bristol Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable screenings==
In addition to regular shows, Hot Tub Cinema has also been involved in several film &amp; TV launches, such as a one-off launch screening [[Spring Breakers]] which included an appearance from the writer/director [[Harmony Korine]]. Held in an abandoned fire station in South London, in addition to the film and afterparty guests could experience recreations of iconic scenes throughout the venue.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEi692I_14g&lt;/ref&gt;

They also created an event for a DVD launch of ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'', which included (real) roast squirrel and a tub full of blood and limbs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.582125798510345.1073741826.161577853898477&amp;type=3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''iThemba''''' is a feature-length documentary film shot in [[Zimbabwe]], directed and produced by [[Elinor Burkett]] and produced by Errol Webber, who also shot and edited the film. It premiered at the [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam]] in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idfa.nl/industry/Festival/films-2010.aspx?partID=591027B9-0968-4506-88AD-7F01B80F64EA/&lt;/ref&gt;

The film follows the members of the Zimbabwean band Liyana, a group of eight musicians with physical disabilities who navigate a country where many of their neighbors consider them to be cursed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinggeorge6.org// |title=KGVI |publisher=Kinggeorge6.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The funny and talented young people take viewers with them as they travel across the city of [[Bulawayo]] and into remote villages, to rural bottle shops and urban marketplaces, inside the huts of traditional healers and the neighborhoods of the urban poor – into an Africa rarely seen by outsiders, a place where tradition is not necessarily gentle, where it threatens to trap the unfortunate, and where a few fight back.

Meet Marvelous Mbulo, the lady-killing lead singer, whose wit provides the film's heart. Listen to Prudence Mabhena, Liyana's musical heart. And travel Zimbabwe with the wise-cracking Energy Maburutse, whose humor belies the seriousness of his situation.

The film is filled with an endless flow of the band’s jokes and satire and their amazing Afro-fusion melodies, most composed by members of Liyana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/liyanakg6/ |title=liyanakg6 |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shot during and in the wake of the [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008]] and the country’s economic meltdown by an American, Zimbabwean and Jamaican team, the film unfolds against the backdrop of enormous political tension and the daily struggle to find a bank that actually had cash, to buy food although the store shelves were empty, and to navigate streets pocked with wheelchair-mangling potholes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/02/world/africa/02zimbabwe.html | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Wines | title=How Bad Is Inflation in Zimbabwe? | date=2006-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Title==
The title of the film means Hope in isiNdebele, one of the two major languages of Zimbabwe. It is drawn from the film’s title song.

{{nihongo|"'''In a Grove'''"|藪の中|Yabu no Naka|}} is a short story by [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]]; it first appeared in the January 1922 edition of the Japanese literature monthly ''[[Shinchō]]''. [[Akira Kurosawa]] used this story as the basis for the plot of his award-winning movie ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashōmon]]''.

"In a Grove" is an early [[modernist]] short story, as well as a blending of the [[modernist]] search for identity with themes from historic Japanese literature, and as such is perhaps the iconic work of Akutagawa's career.  It presents three varying accounts of the murder of a samurai, Kanazawa no Takehiro, whose corpse has been found in a bamboo forest near [[Kyoto]]. Each section simultaneously clarifies and obfuscates what the reader knows about the murder, eventually creating a complex and contradictory vision of events that brings into question humanity's ability or willingness to perceive and transmit objective [[truth]].

== Plot summary ==
The story opens with the account of a woodcutter who has found a man's body in the woods. The woodcutter reports that man died of a single sword stroke to the chest, and that the trampled leaves around the body showed there had been a violent struggle, but otherwise lacked any significant evidence as to what actually happened. There were no weapons nearby, and no horses—only a single piece of rope, a comb and a lot of blood.

The next account is delivered by a traveling Buddhist priest. He says that he met the man, who was accompanied by a woman on horseback, on the road, around noon the day before the murder. The man was carrying a sword, a bow and a black quiver. All of these, along with the woman's horse, a tall, short-maned [[palomino]], were missing when the woodcutter discovered the body.

The next person to testify is a ''hōmen'' (放免, a released prisoner working under contract to the police, similar to a [[bounty hunter]]). He has captured an infamous criminal named Tajōmaru. Tajōmaru was injured when thrown from a horse (a tall, short-maned palomino), and he was carrying a bow and a black quiver, which did not belong in his usual arsenal.  This proves, he says, that Tajōmaru was the perpetrator. Tajōmaru was not carrying the dead man's sword, however.

The next testimony is from an old woman, who identifies herself as the mother of the missing girl. Her daughter is a beautiful, strong-willed 19-year-old named Masago, married to Kanazawa no Takehiro—a 26-year-old samurai from [[Wakasa Province|Wakasa]]. Her daughter, she says, has never been with a man other than Takehiro. She begs the police to find her daughter.

Next, Tajōmaru confesses. He says that he met them on the road in the forest, and upon first seeing Masago, decided that he was going to rape her. In order to rape Masago unhindered, he separated the couple, luring Takehiro into the woods with the promise of buried treasure. He then stuffed his mouth full of leaves, tied him to a tree and fetched Masago. When Masago saw her husband tied to the tree, she pulled a dagger from her bosom and tried to stab Tajōmaru, but he knocked the knife out of her hand, and he had his way with her. Originally, he had no intention of killing the man, he claims, but after the rape, she begged him to either kill her husband or kill himself—she could not live if two men knew her shame. She would leave with the last man standing. Tajōmaru did not wish to kill Takehiro in a cowardly manner, so he untied him and they had a sword fight. During the duel, Masago fled. Tajōmaru dispatched the man and took the man's sword, bow, and quiver, as well as the woman's horse. He says that he sold the sword before he was captured by the bounty hunter.

The second-to-last account is that of Masago. According to her, after the rape, Tajōmaru fled, and her husband, still tied to the tree, looked at her with great disdain. She was ashamed that she had been raped, and no longer wished to live, but she wanted him to die with her. He agreed, or so she believed—he couldn't actually say anything because his mouth was still stuffed full of leaves—and she plunged her dagger into his chest. She then cut the rope that bound Takehiro, and ran into the forest, whereupon she attempted to commit suicide numerous times, she said, but her spirit was too strong to die. At the end of her confession, she weeps.

The final account comes from Takehiro's ghost, as delivered through a [[spirit medium]]. The ghost says that after the rape, Tajōmaru persuaded Masago to leave her husband and become his own wife, which she agreed to do under one condition: He would have to kill Takehiro. Tajōmaru became enraged at the suggestion, kicked her to the ground, and asked Takehiro if he should kill the dishonorable woman. Hearing this, Masago fled into the forest. Tajōmaru then cut Takehiro's bonds and ran away. Takehiro grabbed Masago's fallen dagger and plunged it into his chest. Shortly before he died, he sensed someone creep up to him and steal the dagger from his chest. Throughout, it is obvious that he is furious at his wife.

== Analysis ==
All analyses proceed from these premises:
* Takehiro is dead.
* Tajōmaru raped Masago.
* Tajōmaru stole Takehiro's bow and quiver, as well as the woman's horse.
* In each of the accounts, Masago wishes Takehiro dead, although the details vary.
* Masago and Tajōmaru did not leave together.

The differences between the characters' stories range from the trivial to the fundamental. What follows is a list of discrepancies between the characters' testimonies.

* The comb mentioned by the woodcutter is not mentioned by any of the other characters.
* The "violent struggle" that trampled the leaves, mentioned by the woodcutter, seems to occur only in Tajōmaru's version of the story—the sword fight.
* The woodcutter also claims that the man was killed by a single sword slash across the chest, but in both Masago's and Takehiro's versions of the story, he was killed by a dagger thrust to the chest.
* The woodcutter claims that Takehiro was wearing a Kyōto-style hat called a "sabi-eboshi", however Masago's mother says that he was not from Kyōto. We know that the author wanted to draw significance to this fact, because he specifically had the police investigator ask her if Takehiro was from Kyōto.
* The traveling priest says that he "clearly remember[s] that there were more than 20 arrows" in the man's quiver.  The bounty hunter says that there were only 17.
 
* Tajōmaru does not mention how Masago's dagger disappeared from the crime scene.
* In Tajōmaru's and Takehiro's accounts, Masago and Tajōmaru have a long conversation after the rape, after which, she is willing to leave with Tajōmaru, so long as her husband is dead. Masago's account omits this completely.
* It seems unlikely that Masago would fail at suicide so many times, particularly considering the first method she supposedly tried: driving her dagger into her neck.
* Masago says that Takehiro was repulsed by her after the rape. This is not true according to the other accounts. From Takehiro's story, it is clear that he is furious at her, but he claims that this is because she asked Tajōmaru to kill him. In Tajōmaru's version, he still loves her so much that he is willing to fight to the death for her.
* Takehiro introduces a new and unlikely character: the person who stole the dagger from his chest, conveniently, mere seconds before his death. (The film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' explains this by having the Woodcutter later admit to stealing the dagger, but this confession is not present in the original story. This actually isn't what the woodcutter's testimony shows, because he mentioned that all the blood had dried up and Takehiro claims that as the small sword was retrieved from his chest, "more blood flowed into my mouth".)
* Masago and Takehiro claim that Tajōmaru violently kicked her after the rape. Tajōmaru says that his desire to make Masago his wife forced him to battle Takehiro instead of kicking the woman off and running away.

In short, every character says at least one thing that is refuted by another.

== In popular culture ==
"In a Grove" is the favorite story of "Ghost Dog", the main character from the movie ''[[Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai]]''. 

The seventh episode of ''[[R.O.D the TV]]'', titled "In a Grove", deals with a similarly confusing mix of truth and lies, reality and pretense.  

The plot of ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[Jose Chung's From Outer Space|Jose Chung's ''From Outer Space'']]" also deals with conflicting testimonies from characters involved in an [[alien abduction]] case. In the same way, the plot of the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[A Matter of Perspective]]" concerns similarly conflicting testimonies from characters involved in a homicide investigation - however, here, in contrast to the thesis of "In a Grove", an objectively true account of what happened is eventually discovered.

The name of the story has become an idiom in Japan, used to signify a situation where no conclusion can be drawn, because evidence is insufficient or contradictory. Similar terms include {{Nihongo|"in the dark"|闇の中|yami no naka}} and {{Nihongo|"in the fog"|霧の中|kiri no naka}}.

== Translation notes ==
{{Original research|section|date=November 2014}} 
Contrary to what some foreign-language versions of the story may imply, Masago '''does not''' confess to the police. This is clear in the Japanese version of the text. The title of this section is:「清水寺に来れる女の懺悔」(''kiyomizu-dera ni kitareru onna no zange'', translated in ''Giles'' as "The Confession of the Woman Visitor to [[Kiyomizudera]] Temple") The word 懺悔 (''zange'') is often translated as "confession", but the word also has heavy religious connotations, similar to "repentance" or "penitence". Although it can mean "to confess to other people", it almost always means "to confess to Buddha/God". Contrast this with Tajōmaru's confession to the police, referred to as 白状 (''hakujō'') in the text. &lt;!--This raises the question: The woman's story seems highly unlikely, but why would she lie to Buddha and ask him to forgive her for a crime that she didn't commit? Without this important detail, we could be led to believe that Masago was lying to the police in an effort to save face.--&gt;&lt;!--The previous sentence has been hidden from view due to lack of citation, and to being a subjective interpretation.--&gt; Jay Rubin translated the title of the section to "Penitent Confession of a Woman in the Kiyomizu Temple".
&lt;!-- Another minor translation mistake in the ''Giles'' version of the text is the use of the word "[[sorrel (horse)|sorrel]]" to refer to the woman's horse. The Japanese word in question is 月毛 (''tsukige'', lit. "moon hair"). This word is better translated as "[[palomino]]".

Often omitted from translations is the proper translation of the word 征矢 (''soya''). Often translated merely as "arrow", the word actually has a slightly different [[denotation (semiotics)|denotation]]. "Soya" were extremely sharp arrows used for penetrating armor. Thus, as the samurai is carrying "soya", we are to assume that he is not only an experienced swordsman, but also an experienced archer. Without knowing this, we might be led to assume that the arrows were used for hunting, which was clearly not the author's intention.--&gt; &lt;!--The previous sentence has been hidden from view due to lack of citation. It begs the question, "Translation mistakes according to whom?" --&gt;

Rubin translated the title of the whole story to ''In a Bamboo Grove''.

[[File:Baldwin Basket.png|300x300px|thumb|How the trick is performed, Baldwin 1895.]] 
'''Indian Basket Trick''' (or Hindu Basket Trick) is a trick with a wicker basket in which an assistant is put into the basket and the performer then puts swords through it. The trick ends while the child or assistant either climbs out of the basket or reappears from behind the crowd unharmed. The Indian Basket trick has been used in an adapted form by Western [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]] for a long time. It is one of the oldest [[Magic (illusion)|illusions]]. It started off being performed in the streets; later, Colonel Stodare adapted it to [[stage magic]]. In the old version of the Indian Basket Trick, the magician used a real basket for the trick. Nowadays magicians use a box to accomplish this trick.

The secret to the trick was revealed by the magician [[Samri Baldwin]] as early as 1895. Baldwin described the trick as a very simple illusion. The boy whilst inside the basket "coils himself around in the bulge or protruding sides of the basket, so that when the Fakeer tramples in the middle or center, he does not trample on the boy... The sword is only put through the basket at certain prearranged places and passes between the boy's legs, between his arms and the body, between the shoulders and the body, or between the shoulders and the neck." As for the boy reappearing outside of the basket behind the crowd, it is not the same boy but a confederate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samri Baldwin|Baldwin, Samuel]]. (1895). ''The Secrets of Mahatma Land Explained''. T. J. Dyson &amp; Son. pp. 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jolt''' is the name of five [[fictional character]]s in the [[Transformers]] series in the Transformers robot superhero franchise. The original Jolt was a Decepticon hot rod with a sword who was introduced in 1994. Portrayed in a variety of incarnations, the most recent version of Jolt is a Superheroic [[Autobot]] who appeared in the 2009 film ''Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen''.

The original Transformer Jolt was a Decepticon who turned into a hot rod. He was a member of the sword-wielding Laser Rods team. He was also released under the name Hotrod in the UK, but is unrelated to the Autobot of that name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Unofficial Guide to Transformers 1980s Through 1990s Revised &amp; Expanded 2nd Edition | last=Alvarez | first=J.E. | year=2001 | publisher=Schiffer Publishing Ltd.| ISBN=0764313649 | page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comics===

====Fun Publications====
Jolt appeared among the various characters on Transtech Cybertron in the "Transcendent Part 4" by [[Fun Publications]].

Jolt was among the characters to appear in the 2010 ''Transformers: Timelines'' comic "Generation 2 Redux", where he was one of the Decepticons under the command of [[Clench (Transformers)|Clench]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = [[Greg Sepelak]] &amp; Trent Troop | penciller = Robby Musso| inker = Robby Musso &amp; Frank Milkovich| story = Generation 2: Redux | title = Transformers Timelines| volume = 2| issue = 5| date = Summer, 2010| publisher = [[Fun Publications]]| location = Fort Worth, Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marvel Comics====
Jolt appeared in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] [[Generation 2]] comics.

[[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]], current leader of the Decepticons planned to create an army of Decepticons, so he constructed the bodies of the Rotor Force and Laser Rods. When Megatron killed Bludgeon and took back leadership of the Decepticons, one of his first actions was to steal the [[Autobot Matrix of Leadership|Matrix]] from [[Optimus Prime]]. The Matrix was then used to bring the new Decepticons to life.

Ransack first appeared in issue #6 as one of the lifeless Decepticon bodies. In issue #7 Rotor Force ([[Leadfoot (Transformers)|Leadfoot]], [[Manta Ray (Transformers)|Manta Ray]], [[Powerdive]] and [[Ransack]]) and the Laser Rods ([[Electro (Transformers)|Electro]], Jolt, [[Sizzle (Transformers)|Sizzle]] and [[Volt (Transformers)|Volt]]) were sent to steal Rheanimum, a potent substance [[Megatron]] intended to use in his quest for power, from the planet Tykos.

They would appear again in the Autobot-Decepticon alliance, battling against first the forces of [[Jhiaxus]], and then [[Swarm (Transformers)|the Swarm]].

===Animated series===
Jolt appeared as the sidekick of the Autobot Hot Shot in the animated series ''Transformers: Armada'', where he spoke only in electronic beeps.

===Dreamwave Productions===
Jolt appeared in the ''Dreamwave Productions'' comic book series for ''Transformers: Armada'' where he was given a much fuller character than in the animated series. Jolt appeared among the Mini-Cons in issue #18 of the ''Transformers: Armada'' comic book who aided [[Over-Run]] using the [[Mini-Con Matrix]] in the defeat of Unicron.

===Games===
Jolt is among the characters appearing in the 2004 ''[[Transformers (2004 video game)|Transformers]]'' video game for the [[PlayStation 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

:When a new ''Universe'' line consisting of original molds (based on classic characters) was developed, Hot Shot and Jolt were included. Instead of simply releasing their original tooling (as had been done with Armada's [[Unicron]]), a new tooling was made for both the Autobot and his Mini-Con partner. Both look very similar to their original Armada incarnations. As with the original, Universe 2.0 Jolt is bright red in color. Very few were released before the cessation of the Universe to make way for Revenge of the Fallen toys.

A new Mini-Con helicopter named Jolt came out in the ''Cybertron'' line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mastercollector.com/neat/toyfair05/hasbro/transformers.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714044428/http://www.mastercollector.com/neat/toyfair05/hasbro/transformers.cfm |archivedate=2011-07-14 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Jolt (Hop in Japan) is the leader of the Recon Mini-Con Team. He has a childlike sense of wonder and curiosity - possibly a bad thing when he is with his human friends. He refers to Bud as "Master Bud" in a manner reminiscent of a butler, until Bud has him amend (so he changes it to the less formal, if awkward, "Bud-dude.") He is very loyal to his team and friends, and of all the Autobots in this series, he is the closest to the human characters.

In Japan, the Galaxy Force series is an original continuity, distinct from Micron Legend (Armada) and Super Link (Energon), so it is very unlikely that he was originally intended to be the same character as ''Armada'' Jolt.

In December 2007 images appeared on the internet of a redeco of ''Cybertron'' [[Crosswise]] in purple and silver. The character was named Jolt, although according to its designer it was originally a homage to the ''Generation 1'' Decepticon Micromaster [[Road Hugger]], but when that name was unavailable from the legal department, they named him Jolt instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/default.cfm?page=News/Item&amp;newsid=5716B133-D56F-E112-46403859800D7A16]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029205802/http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/default.cfm?page=News%2FItem&amp;newsID=5716B133-D56F-E112-46403859800D7A16 |date=2012-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his biography Jolt was brought to life in the final battle for the Allspark, and subsequently sought help by Barricade, who beat him up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tformers.com/ig.php?mode=view&amp;album=8789&amp;pic=asjb.jpg&amp;dispsize=800&amp;start=0|title=Transformers  News Reviews Movies Comics and Toys - TFormers.com|first=|last=Tformers.com|website=tformers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jolt is one of the lowest ranking Decepticons ever made, with a rank of 2 out of 10.

===IDW Publishing===
Oddly a robot called Dead End appeared in the IDW comics ''[[Transformers: Alliance]]'' who resembled Jolt in vehicle mode, but his origin completely contradicts the biography on the toy. His robot mode is never seen.

:The toy of Jolt is 13 cm long in vehicle mode, whereas a real Bugatti Veyron is 447 cm long, so the toy is at a scale of about 1:34. The toy stands about 14 cm tall, which means Jolt would stand about 481 cm or 15 feet 10 inches tall.
:According to Hasbro officials at Botcon 2008 the Walmart exclusive redeco toys were originally to be sold under the ''[[Transformers: Universe]]'' label, but Walmart requested its exclusives be part of the movie toy line, so they were repackaged in movie style packaging.

===Films===
Jolt is seen driving in vehicle mode on a highway with [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] and [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)|Optimus Prime]]. He is also seen mourning over Prime after the battle in the forest. He is in the final battle, fighting alongside his fellow Autobots to fend off the incoming Decepticons, and helps [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] connect [[Jetfire]]'s remains with Optimus. He uses his "electro whips" to surge power from Jetfire to Prime so they can combine in the final battle.

Jolt's head was seen in ''The Last Knight'' at Cade's the junkyard, next to Wheelie, confirming his death.

===IDW Publishing===
Jolt appears in ''[[Transformers: Nefarious]]'' #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film. [[Bumblebee (other incarnations)|Bumblebee]], Breakaway, Jolt, Knock Out and Dune Runner are sent to investigate spark fragments detected at Kingdom Petrochemicals. Arriving first Breakaway is warned by [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]] to leave, but unwilling to give in the Autobot is swiftly defeated. Bumblebee and his team fire on Soundwave, who escapes.

Jolt appears in ''[[Transformers: Rising Storm]]''. He learned that Bumblebee was defending Sam Witwicky from a Decepticon attack all alone, and was eager to get out there to help him. To his disappointment, Optimus Prime instead ordered him, Knock Out and Dune Runner to remain on Diego Garcia and keep an eye on the captive Fearswoop along with a number of confused Autobot refugees liberated from Carter Newell's control. Jolt took to guarding Fearswoop, but while he was making himself busy telling the prisoner off and reading comic books, the corpse of Knock Out suddenly crashed through a wall, courtesy of Shockwave. He prepared to take the intruder on with his electric whips, but Shockwave was unimpressed and shot him down. Jolt desperately tried to contact Optimus Prime for help, but his message failed to get through and he was killed by Shockwave.

*'''''Revenge of the Fallen'' Deluxe Jolt''' (2009)
:Deluxe class Jolt transforms into a blue [[Chevrolet Volt]] with translucent blue plastic windows. His car mode is very conspicuously split where his arms and legs separate during transformation. In robot mode, he has light blue "electro whips" in each arm which are deployed by turning a small knob on his wrist. His head features blue light-piping for his eyes, but there is a gray protrusion behind his head which completely prevents light passage. This protrusion also prevents his ball-jointed head from turning other than in the slightest of angles. Turning his waist activates his MechAlive feature, which consists of moving gears inside his translucent upper chest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10973101|title=Walmart.com - Jolt|website=Walmart.com|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Kevin the Teenager.jpg|thumb|right|Kevin the Teenager]]  --&gt;
'''Kevin Patterson''' is a character created and played by the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[comedian]], [[Harry Enfield]].

==Evolution==
Kevin originated in 1990 in the "Little Brother" sketches of ''[[Harry Enfield's Television Programme]]'' as an annoyingly energetic boy who constantly vexed his older brother with his irritating catchphrases and habit of bursting into his room when he was with a girl.

In the first episode of ''[[Harry Enfield and Chums]]'' (the new name for the show, in November 1994), Kevin, who despite the same name and similar initial manner was actually separate from the earlier character, reached his thirteenth birthday. The sketch showed his parents watching in horror as Kevin lost his sense of dress, courtesy and posture as the clock struck midnight on the day of his thirteenth birthday, thus becoming '''Kevin the Teenager''', one of the most memorable of Enfield's comic creations. Unlike the previous sketches which included an older brother, this incarnation of Kevin was an only child.

==Personality==
As a teenager, wearing a [[baseball cap]] the wrong way round and with his red hair flopping over his face, Kevin is rude to his despairing parents, frequently shouting "I hate you, I wish I'd never been born!" at them, and insisting that everything is "so unfair!" In one sketch, when his father asks him to wash his car, Kevin ends up taking the entire day to complete the task due to his inability to get out of bed before noon and an apparent [[allergy]] to work, and in another sketch, though wide awake, he made the most primitive of attempts at tidying his room when required to do so.  The character is also heavily dictated by [[peer pressure]], and was seen in various other sketches trying to sound like [[Ali G]], or [[Liam Gallagher]].   

His best friend is another teenaged boy named Perry Carter (played by the actress [[Kathy Burke]], and based on an early character Burke portrayed on various Channel 4 shows).  They starred in a 2000 feature film, ''[[Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large]]''.

The sketches suggest that teenage boys are always very polite to all parents except their own. Kevin and Perry heap immense amounts of abuse on their own respective parents (though Perry shouts at his down the phone rather than face to face) yet are very polite to each other's parents. In one sketch, Kevin's plans to host a party go wrong and ends with the house being trashed. Despite his frequent declarations of hatred towards his parents, Kevin ends up crying whilst his long-suffering mother gives him a much-needed hug.

Aside from playing [[video games]], Kevin's one aim in life is to lose his [[virginity]], or at least to prove that he has a girlfriend.  From boasting about the (imagined) joys of sex to placing the nozzle of a [[vacuum cleaner]] to his neck to look as though he has received a [[love bite]], he is determined to prove that he has "done it".  He eventually does lose his virginity during a drunken party in the final episode of ''Harry Enfield and Chums''. The following morning, he wakes up transformed into a nice, polite and helpful young man. This is however later revealed to be a dream by his mother in the first of the two Christmas specials, with Kevin still behaving like before.
They both eventually end up losing their virginities in Ibiza in the movie [[Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large]]''.

==Reception==
Due to Kevin and the other characters in ''Harry Enfield and Chums''' getting positive feedback and statements of the truth behind the writers' observations, the term "Kevin the Teenager" (often shortened to simply a "Kevin"), has entered British [[vernacular]] to describe any [[adolescent]] who is bad-tempered or rebellious ("He's a right Kevin!"){{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. It can even be applied to female adolescents.

==Kevin's parents==
Kevin's father (named Dave in one of the earlier sketches, and later Frank (though others argue 'Rick' or 'Ray' is his name in the movie, based on the sex video played by Eyeball Paul in the movie, where Kevin's mother says "Ooh Rick" during Kevin and Perry's mix, and also afterwards when the two are lying in bed, mortified, and Kevin's mother says "Oh, Ray..") has been played by three actors:
* [[Duncan Preston]] in [[Harry Enfield and Chums]] first series, 1994
* [[Stephen Moore (actor)|Stephen Moore]] in [[Harry Enfield and Chums]] - Moore replaced Preston in the second series, 1997.
* [[James Fleet]] in [[Kevin &amp; Perry Go Large]] (2000) - a full-length feature film based on the character.

When Kevin was "Little Brother", his father was played by Martyn Whitby and his mother was played by Caroline Quentin.

Kevin's mother (named Sheila in one of the earlier sketches), in contrast to Kevin's father, was played by [[Louisa Rix]] in both the series and the movie.

{{Dynamic list}}
This is a list of articles about notable&lt;!-- notable enough that they have or could have an article, see WP:GNG --&gt; observed periods (days, weeks, months, and years) declared by various governments, groups and organizations to raise awareness of an issue, commemorate a group or event, or celebrate something.

This list does not include official public holidays; for those, see [[List of holidays by country]]. For religious holidays and feasts, see [[:Category:Religious holidays]]. For an overview including all types of holidays, see [[Lists of holidays]].

==Terminology==

A national or international '''awareness day''' or '''observance''' is a date usually set by a major organisation or government to commemorate a [[public health]] or [[ethical]] cause of importance on a national or international level.

An  '''international observance''', also known as an '''international dedication''' or '''international anniversary''', is a period of time to observe some issue of international interest or concern. This is used to commemorate, promote and mobilize for action. Many of these periods have been established by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] (UN), [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]], United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/unesco/events/prizes-and-celebrations/celebrations/international-days/|title=International Days|website=UNESCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and other United Nations bodies including the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU), [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO), [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) and the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). In this case, the lead agency for a particular international observance uses the symbolism of the United Nations (UN), perhaps a specially designed logo for the year, and the UN infrastructure to coordinate events worldwide. It also presents a written report about the event. This summarizes the activities that took place around the world under the auspices of the international observance, and makes recommendations for the future.

The lists below include some days, month, years, and decades that have been recognized as international observances by the United Nations, or by other organizations that declare international observances but are not as widely recognized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57916">{{About|motion picture films|still photography and other films|Film format}}
This '''list of [[film formats]]''' catalogues formats developed for shooting or viewing [[motion pictures]], ranging from the Chronophotographe format from 1888, to mid-20th century formats such as the 1953 [[CinemaScope]] format, to more recent formats such as the 1992 [[IMAX HD]] format. To be included in this list, the formats must all have been used in the field or for test shooting, and they must all use [[photochemical]] images that are formed or projected on a [[film base]], a transparent substrate which supports the photosensitive emulsion.

As well, the formats must have been used to make more than just a few test frames. The camera must be fast enough (in frames per second) to create an illusion of motion consistent with the [[persistence of vision]] phenomenon. The format must be significantly unique from other listed formats in regard to its image capture or [[movie projector|image projection]]. The format characteristics should be clearly definable in several listed parameters (e. g., film gauge, aspect ratio, etc.).

== Legend ==
* '''Format''' is the name of the process; some formats may have multiple names in common usage.
* '''Creator''' is the individual or company most directly attributable as the developer of the system.
* '''Year created''' usually refers to the earliest date that the system was used to completion (i.e. projection), but may refer to when it was developed if no known film was made.
* '''First known film''' is the first film (not including tests) made with the format and intended for release.
* '''Negative gauge''' is the [[film gauge]] (width) used for the original camera negative.
* '''Negative aspect ratio''' is the [[aspect ratio (image)|image ratio]] determined by the ratio of the gate dimensions multiplied by the [[anamorphic]] power of the camera lenses (1x in the case of spherical lenses).&lt;ref name="ar"&gt;Strictly speaking, aspect ratios for film are always expressed as the ratio of 1 and are formatted as x:y, e.g. 1.85:1. However, in the interest of formatting, the aspect ratios listed will assume the ratio of 1 and omit the :1 suffix.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gate dimensions''' are the width and height of the camera [[film gate|gate aperture]], and by extension the film negative frame.
* '''Negative pulldown''' describes the [[film perforations]] per frame, the direction of film transport, and standard frame speed. Film transport is assumed to be vertical unless otherwise noted, and standard frame speed is assumed to be 24 frames per second unless the film is otherwise noted or has no standard. Silent film has no standard speed; many amateur formats have several common speeds, but no standard.
* '''Negative lenses''' indicates whether spherical (normal) or [[anamorphic]] lenses are used on the original camera negative, and if anamorphic lenses, what anamorphic power is used.
* '''Projection gauge''' is the [[film gauge]] (width) used for the release print.
* '''Projection aspect ratio''' is the [[aspect ratio (image)|image ratio]] determined by the ratio of the projection dimensions multiplied by the [[anamorphic]] power of the projection lenses (1x in the case of spherical lenses). This is also known as the intended theatrical aspect ratio.&lt;ref name="ar" /&gt;
* '''Projection dimensions''' are the width and height of the [[movie projector|projector aperture]] plate, and by extension the film frame area which is projected. The aperture plate always very slightly crops the frame.
* '''Projection lenses''' indicates whether spherical (normal) or [[anamorphic]] lenses are used on the projector, and if anamorphic lenses, what anamorphic power is used.

Formats are listed in chronological order and by release date in the case of multiple formats within one year, if this can be determined. Undated formats are listed at the bottom in alphabetical order.

'''''Mortal Kombat: Special Forces''''' is a 3D [[action-adventure game]] developed and released by [[Midway Games]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] in 2000. The game stars the character [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jackson "Jax" Briggs]] from the ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' fighting game series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ps/adventure/mortalkombatspecialforces/index.html |title=Mortal Kombat Special Forces for PS - Mortal Kombat Special Forces PlayStation - Mortal Kombat Special Forces PS Game |publisher=Gamespot.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was [[List of video games notable for negative reception|panned by critics]] for its lack of traditional Mortal Kombat-style violence, poor level design, and tedious gameplay.

==Gameplay==
''Mortal Kombat: Special Forces'' is a third-person view [[action-adventure game]]. The only playable character is [[Jax (Mortal Kombat)|Jax]], who uses not only hand-to-hand combat techniques but also firearms and explosives. There are five levels set on Earth in Otherrealm, with a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] battle at the end of each of them. Exploring the locations in the search for keys, the players solve puzzles, find the codes to unlock the doors, and blast hidden passages in walls. Jax can ascend to a higher level platforms even as he can not jump, but he can push large blocks.

The player can restore Jax's health meter using first-aid kits. The player also has a limited energy reserve: whenever Jax performs one of his special techniques, he spends energy that can be replenished by performing certain [[Combo (video gaming)|combos]]. Jax can attack with his hands and feet, as well as block counter strikes. Although there are no [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|Fatality]] systems, the combo system allows finishing off the opponent with the final blow in case the enemy's health line is exhausted by this moment. The experience points that a player gains by defeating enemies allow one to get new combos. In-game menu displays the presence of items in the player's inventory, and also contains information on the purpose of the current mission. After completing the game, the player can activate the cheat menu to start a new game with additional bonuses.

== Plot ==
''Special Forces'' is chronologically the first game in the ''Mortal Kombat'' storyline, as its events take place even before ''[[Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero]]''. The story of the game involves [[Kano (Mortal Kombat)|Kano]] freeing his gang, the Black Dragon from a maximum security prison. Major Jax, seeking revenge for the slaughter of his Special Forces comrades at the hands of the Black Dragon, undertakes a mission to stop them from retrieving an artifact of great power, the Eye of Chitian. The true power of the artifact is shown in the ending that it can open portals to other realms when Jax uses the artifact to teleport himself and Kano back to Earthrealm after defeating him.

==Characters==
Besides Jax, Kano, and Kano's Black Dragon subordinates [[Tremor (Mortal Kombat)|Tremor]] and [[Jarek]], the game features three characters exclusive to this entry in the series:

*Gemini: Jax's base operative, relaying information and messages to him from headquarters. The two share a friendship, and Gemini worries excessively about Jax. Operating over radio only, she is never seen in-game.
*No Face: A member of the Black Dragon organization led by Kano, who freed him from a high-security prison. He is described as only having knowledge of explosive devices, he wears sticks of dynamites strapped to his chest and uses a flame thrower as a weapon. He has no nose, ears, hair and a pale complexion, based on his name.
*Tasia: An expert swordswoman and deadly ninja master who is a member of Kano's Black Dragon organization.&lt;ref name="MKSFmanual"&gt;''Mortal Kombat: Special Forces'' instruction booklet. Midway Games, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Tremor, No Face and Jarek, Kano freed her from a high-security prison. She wields two [[ninjatō]] swords and has an ability to teleport. She appears along with Jarek to capture Cassie and Jacqui by the orders of Black Dragon in ''[[Mortal Kombat X]]'' comic book.

==Development==
This was the second ''[[Mortal Kombat]]'' game developed by Midway that was more of a platformer than a fighting game, after having tested the waters with ''Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero'' in 1997. Series co-creator [[John Tobias]] intended to work on a series of platform games to expand the ''Mortal Kombat'' universe, including titles centering on [[Baraka (Mortal Kombat)|Baraka]] and [[Liu Kang]]; only the latter was actually released by Midway (2005's ''[[Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks]]'') despite having sat on the drawing board for many years.

Although ''Special Forces'' was only released on the PlayStation, it was also supposed to be released both on the [[Nintendo 64]] and [[Sega Dreamcast]], as evidenced by an [[IGN]] interview with John Tobias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview: MK Special Forces  |url=http://ign64.ign.com/news/6748.html  |date=1999-02-05 |accessdate=2010-04-04 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19990428124025/http://ign64.ign.com/news/6748.html |archivedate = 1999-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of [[Midway Games]] staff, including Tobias, left the company in 1999 for various reasons while the game was still in production. The plot of ''Special Forces'' (which originally included [[Sonya Blade]]) was greatly revised following Tobias's departure and the game was rushed to completion. [[Ed Boon]] later recalled: "I didn't work on ''Special Forces''. The game and project were riddled with all kinds of problems. I could write a book on that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=noobde|author=Ed Boon|number=10380817871|date=12 March 2010|title=@djSergi I didnt work on Special Forces. The game &amp; project were riddled with all kinds of problems. I could write a book on that. :(}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
As of 2014, it has a very low averaged review score of only 28/100 at [[Metacritic]], including ratings of 2.1/10 from [[GameSpot]] and 3/10 from [[IGN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation/mortal-kombat-special-forces |title=Mortal Kombat: Special Forces for PlayStation Reviews |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Of all the ''Mortal Kombat'' games, ''Special Forces'' is considered by some to be the worst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamefront.com/the-convoluted-blood-spattered-history-of-mortal-kombat-infographic/ |title=The Convoluted, Blood-Spattered History of Mortal Kombat (Infographic) |publisher=GameFront |date=2011-04-15 |accessdate=2014-02-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423033755/http://www.gamefront.com/the-convoluted-blood-spattered-history-of-mortal-kombat-infographic/|archivedate=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its sales were so low that Midway placed the series on hold in preparation for ''[[Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance]]'' (2002). Ed Boon himself stated: "The game had a pretty bumpy development ride and the game didn't turn out very good at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gary |last= Walk |title=Interview: Ed Boon on the Ups and Downs of the Mortal Kombat Franchise |date= 2008-11-17 |url= http://www.gamedaily.com/articles/features/interview-ed-boon-on-the-ups-and-downs-of-the-mortal-kombat-franchise/?biz=1&amp;page=2 |publisher= [[GameDaily]] |accessdate= 2009-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[GamesRadar]] ranked it as the second most absurd ''Mortal Kombat'' offshoot (behind only ''[[Mortal Kombat: Live Tour]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Chris Antista, [http://www.gamesradar.com/the-top-7-most-absurd-mortal-kombat-offshoots/?page=3 The Top 7… Most absurd Mortal Kombat offshoots], GamesRadar, April 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, GamesRadar also ranked it as the 41st worst game ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The 50 worst games of all time |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/worst-games-all-time/ |work=[[GamesRadar]] |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, ''Video Games: The Ultimate Guide'' gave the game 7 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/Video_Games-The_Ultimate_Guide/Video_Games_The_Ultimate_Guide#page/n119/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; ''GameVortex'' gave it 79%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psillustrated.com/psillustrated/soft_rev.php/2239/mortal-kombat-special-forces-playstation.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Electric Playground]]'' scored it 7 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20001207075100/http://www.elecplay.com:80/review_3014.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pilolo''' is an outdoor game that is usually played among [[Ghanaian people|Ghanaian]] children. The literal English translation of the name is "time to search for".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pilolo|url=http://www.gameskidsplay.net/games/chasing_games/pilolo.htm|website=gameskidsplay.net|accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==
The game is played among ten or more children. When ten children have decided to play, one kid is chosen to be the leader of the game. The leader searches for small pieces of sticks. The game starts when the leader tells the other kids to hide. The leader either ensures that they are facing a wall or asks somebody to watch them so that they do not peek.

The leader may hide the sticks under stones, on top of short trees, in grass, or even leave one on the ground just in front of the kids who are waiting. The sticks are generally hidden in a place which is convenient but not easy to find. When the sticks are hidden, the leader shouts "pilolo", and the kids run to search for the hiding sticks. As they search for the sticks they sing a song. One popular song which is sung is "pilolo yafo be mli", a Ghanaian song that literally means "pilolo nobody is expected to cry". A kid who finds a small piece of stick first may pretend to have not seen it, or may pick it up fast when the others are not watching and run to touch the leader. The others would have to do the same. The child who finds the stick is then given a point.

'''The Prospect Theatre Company''' was an English company founded, as '''Prospect Productions''', in 1961. Based at the [[Cambridge Arts Theatre|Arts Theatre, Cambridge]] from 1964 until 1969, the company, with [[Toby Robertson]] as artistic director and [[Richard Cottrell]] as associate director, toured both nationally and internationally with a mainly classical repertoire, providing notable appearances of such actors as [[Ian McKellen]] and [[Timothy West]]. The company became closely associated with the [[Edinburgh Festival]] after its first appearance there in 1967. Separating from the Arts Theatre in 1969, the company, renamed The Prospect Theatre Company, survived without a permanent base for the next eight years under the direction of Toby Robertson, mounting productions in which [[Derek Jacobi]] and [[Dorothy Tutin]] made significant appearances. Eventually the company found a new home at London's [[Old Vic]] in 1977: two years later it became the Old Vic Theatre Company. Though noted for its exemplary ensemble playing, the company lost its [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] funding in 1980 after Timothy West's first season as Robertson's successor, leading to Prospect's demise.

==Early years, Cambridge and Edinburgh==
[[Iain Mackintosh]], [[Richard Cottrell]] and [[Elizabeth Sweeting]] formed Prospect Productions in 1961 to present a summer season of plays at the [[Oxford Playhouse]]. A successful first season led to a further season in 1962. The following year, when the Playhouse closed for renovations, Prospect became a touring company associated with the [[Century Theatre (UK)|Century Theatre]]. [[Toby Robertson]] directed the last play of the season, [[Vanbrugh]]'s ''[[The Provoked Wife]]'', with [[Eileen Atkins]] and [[Trevor Martin]]. The production opened the newly restored [[Georgian Theatre Royal]] in [[Richmond, North Yorkshire]], then transferred to the [[Vaudeville Theatre]], London. The success of the Oxford seasons prompted the idea that Prospect should present productions beyond the summer season each year.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title =Prospect Theatre Company | work = | publisher =Ian McKellen Stage | date = | url =http://www.mckellen.com/stage/r2/prospect.htm | doi = | accessdate = 4 September 2014 | archiveurl =  | archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, with support from the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]] and [[Dadie Rylands|Dr. George Rylands]], Prospect became a touring company based at the [[Cambridge Arts Theatre|Arts Theatre, Cambridge]], with Toby Robertson as artistic director, Richard Cottrell as associate director, and Iain Mackintosh as administrator. Between 1964 and 1966 Prospect staged 15 productions, presenting well-known plays as well as several rarely performed Classics including Vanbrugh's ''The Confederacy'', with [[Robert Eddison]] and [[Hy Hazell]], to celebrate the third centenary of Vanbrugh's birth, and [[Etherege]]'s ''[[The Man of Mode]]'', and a number of new plays. [[Timothy West]] joined the Company in 1966 to play [[Prospero]]. Later that year Prospect had its first invitation to the [[Edinburgh Festival]].&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

Prospect's first Edinburgh Festival appearance in 1967 was with [[Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'', [[Lila Kedrova]] playing Madam Ranyevskaya in Cottrell's production. The production transferred to London, where Kedrova won the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' Best Actress of the Year Award. 1968 saw the production of Prospect's first "musical" - Gay's ''[[Beggar's Opera]]'', which was also the first Prospect show to be televised, and in 1969 the Company appeared for the first time at the Assembly Hall.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

At the 1969 Edinburgh festival [[Ian McKellen]] made his breakthrough performances with the company as [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]] (directed by Cottrell) and Marlowe's [[Edward II (play)|Edward II]] (directed by Robertson), the latter in the play's first professional revival for 300 years and causing a storm of protest over the enactment of the homosexual Edward's lurid death.&lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-toby-robertson-obe-theatre-director-1-2400165| publisher=''[[The Scotsman]]'' | accessdate=2013-09-16 | date=6 September 2012 | title= Obituary: Toby Robertson, OBE, theatre director | first=Alasdair | last= Steven | work=The Scotsman }}&lt;/ref&gt; Timothy West appeared as McKellen's sparring partner in both those productions,&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt; which subsequently toured Britain and Europe before being staged at the [[Mermaid Theatre]] in London and breaking box-office records at the [[Piccadilly Theatre]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/jul/08/toby-robertson | publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | accessdate=2013-09-16 | date=8 July 2012 | title= Toby Robertson obituary| first=Michael | last=Coveney | work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1967 and 1977 Prospect was invited to appear at eight Edinburgh International Festivals, and largely as a result of its close association with the Edinburgh Festival, Prospect was asked to tour abroad for the British Council, visiting the Middle East, Russia, Hong Kong, and Australia.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

==Years of touring==
In 1969 the Company was asked to extend its touring to the large "No 1" theatres in the regions; at the same time the Cambridge Arts Theatre wanted Prospect to help in the formation of a new theatre company. As these two developments pointed in totally different directions with implications of a conflicting scale of work, Richard Cottrell left Prospect to become director of the newly formed [[Cambridge Arts Theatre#Cambridge Theatre Company|Cambridge Theatre Company]]: Toby Robertson became cirector of Prospect, and its role as the UK's leading touring company was recognised, with its new name - The Prospect Theatre Company.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

Under Robertson, the company pioneered a style of production in which stage designs and setting were kept to a minimum, partly from the belief that Shakespeare's plays in particular benefited from an uncluttered approach; this style also suited the company's needs when touring regional theatres, for which flexibility of staging was essential.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; Emphasis was placed instead on quality acting and strikingly designed costumes, complemented by lighting and incidental music.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt; [[Carl Davis]] composed several scores for the company, including for a modern dress production of ''[[Love's Labours Lost]]'' (1971), ''[[Pericles]]'' (1973), and ''Pilgrim's Progress'' (1974/5) which led directly to the musical ''War Music'' (1977) with words by [[Homer]] and [[Christopher Logue]] and music by Donald Fraser.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

From 1970 to 1976 four major productions were created each year. As the only major company touring nationally, the choice of repertoire tended to be drawn more from the classics at the expense of new work. But alongside several Shakespeare productions the company staged such plays as [[Thomas Otway]]'s ''[[Venice Preserv'd]]'', [[Charles Macklin]]'s ''The Man of the World'', [[Turgenev]]'s ''[[A Month in the Country (play)|A Month in the Country]]'' (with Derek Jacobi, Timothy West and Dorothy Tutin, who won two major acting awards for her performance), Chekhov's ''[[Ivanov (play)|Ivanov]]'', and [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Royal Hunt of the Sun]]''. A series of chamber works were commissioned, including Jane McCulloch's ''The Grand Tour'' for the Entry into Europe celebrations - an entertainment seen in London, Edinburgh, and the 1974 Brighton Festival.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

The strain of touring and meeting the increasingly high standards expected by theatre audiences throughout the country began to tell, and even with occasional London seasons either at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Round House]] or in the West end, it was felt increasingly desirable that Prospect should once again have a permanent and preferably metropolitan base to sustain its regional work.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;&lt;ref name=rowell157&gt;Rowell, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joining the Old Vic==
[[Image:Waterloo the old vic 1.jpg|thumb|alt=The Old Vic, London.|The Old Vic Theatre, London]]
Looking for a suitable London base, Robertson believed that the [[Old Vic]] would best meet the company's needs and would add lustre to its reputation. For two years he sustained a campaign for the Old Vic to make Prospect its resident company.&lt;ref name=rowell157/&gt; For the Old Vic, Robertson's overtures proved increasingly hard to resist in the face of poor box office returns achieved by productions staged  by other companies at the theatre; against this, Prospect staged a highly successful season which opened in May 1977, including ''Hamlet'' with Derek Jacobi,  ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' with [[Alec McCowen]] and Dorothy Tutin; and ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'' with [[Eileen Atkins]].&lt;ref name=rowell158&gt;Rowell, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | title =History of the Old Vic, 1950-1999 | work = | publisher =The Old Vic | date = | url =http://www.oldvictheatre.com/about-us/history-of-the-old-vic-2/1950-1999/ | format = | doi = | accessdate = 5 September 2014 | archiveurl = | archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July the Governors of The Old Vic announced "a marriage that was all but a merger" between the Vic and Prospect. In September Toby Robertson, director of Prospect, was asked to take artistic control of The Old Vic, and Christopher Richards, general manager of The Old Vic, became general manager of Prospect.&lt;ref name= mckellenProspect/&gt;

One major problem, though, was the terms of Prospect's funding by the Arts Council: this was on the basis of it being a touring company, and the Council - already funding the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] in London - could not accept a case for a third major company in the capital and repeatedly refused requests to fund any London seasons staged by Prospect. Therefore any London-based productions would have to succeed financially without Arts Council support. Prospect's first season at the Old Vic recouped its costs but left no surplus to fund future productions. Further stagings by visiting companies were box office failures and stretched the theatre's finances to breaking point.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet Prospect continued to draw audiences to the Old Vic where other companies failed. The company played a five-month season from January to May 1978, adding ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' to their repertory, and a four-month season from September to December presenting ''[[The Rivals]]'', ''[[The Lady's Not for Burning]]'' with Atkins, and ''[[King Lear]]'' with [[Anthony Quayle]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, pp. 159-60&lt;/ref&gt; In December that year, the governors of the Old Vic agreed to a five-year contract with Prospect, announcing to the press on 23 April that henceforth they would be styled "Prospect Productions Ltd., trading as the Old Vic Company".&lt;ref name=rowell160&gt;Rowell, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately Prospect's touring commitments kept the company out of the theatre for the first half of 1979, leaving the theatre to sink further into debt. The company returned in July with Jacobi's ''Hamlet'' (toured afterwards to Denmark, Australia and China, the first English theatre company to tour that country),&lt;ref name=Continuum/&gt; followed by ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and ''[[The Government Inspector]]'' with [[Ian Richardson]].&lt;ref name=rowell160/&gt; The following season, however, proved controversial: the double bill of ''The Padlock'' and ''[[Miss in Her Teens]]'', to mark the bicentenary of [[David Garrick]]'s death, and a revival of ''[[What the Butler Saw (play)|What the Butler Saw]]'' were deemed by the Arts Council unsuitable for touring repertory.&lt;ref name=rowell160/&gt; An internal report by Prospect now questioned "whether Prospect can any longer satisfy the triple task of filling the Vic, of satisfying the [Arts Council] Director of Touring's requirements for product of a certain familiar sort, and of realising the vision of Toby Robertson".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Rowell, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Robertson was in effect fired from the post of artistic director in 1980 while he was abroad with the company in China, Timothy West replacing him.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; The following season, West's first as Robertson's successor, saw ''Macbeth'' with [[Peter O'Toole]], ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' with West as Shylock, and a gala performance presented to the Queen Mother to celebrate her eightieth birthday.&lt;ref name=rowell161/&gt; On 22 December 1980, four days after the gala performance, the Arts Council withdrew its funding from the Company, sealing its demise.&lt;ref name=Continuum&gt;{{cite book | last =Hunter | first =Adriana

Appeals to the Council for funding to be reinstated were denied. The company gave a final season at the Old Vic staging ''The Merchant of Venice'', then gave a final tour of Europe, giving its last performance in Rome on 14 June before disbanding.&lt;ref name=rowell161/&gt;

'''''Rendition: Guantanamo''''' was a [[video game]] being developed by T-Enterprise, a software company in [[Scotland]]. It had been scheduled for release in late 2009, but was ultimately cancelled. The promotional material used the slogan, "It's time to fight back."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/01/tech/main5054176.shtml Get Ready For Gitmo: The Video Game] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603061118/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/06/01/tech/main5054176.shtml |date=2009-06-03 }}, ''[[CBS News]]'', June 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Company director Zarrar Chishti, quoted in Scotland's ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'' said in 2009: "It's been in production for a year and two months. The player start the game with the orange boiler suit, cuffs and ear muffs.
There are certain rules we can't break after meeting politicians so we are not making the game too extreme.
We have had a lot of hate mail about this, mainly from America, saying things like, 'Don't dare put out a game that shows them killing our soldiers.'
But no US or British soldiers get killed in it. The only ones being killed are mercenaries. We have set it in January 2010 because that's when we think the camp will be closed.
We are making a statement. We did not want Guantanamo to be forgotten."
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2009/05/24/exclusive-ex-prisoner-joins-scots-developers-to-make-guantanamo-game-78057-21385039/ Ex-Prisoner joins Scots developers to make Guantanamo game] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528214453/http://www.sundaymail.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2009/05/24/exclusive-ex-prisoner-joins-scots-developers-to-make-guantanamo-game-78057-21385039/ |date=2009-05-28 }}, ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'', May 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cancellation ==
The game was cancelled citing "inaccurate" details posted on various [[websites]] detailing about the game and the "extreme reaction that the game and its popular misconceptions have provoked." Zarrar Chishti, the director at T-Enterprise, wrote an official statement on June 3 regarding the cancellation of Rendition: Guantanamo on the game's official website, which previously showed the teaser trailer for the game. He claims that the main character was not going to be [[Moazzam Begg]], an actual detainee of Guantanamo, but was instead going to be a man named Adam. He also states no [[United States|American]] or [[British Armed Forces|British]] soldiers would be killed, but instead the institution would be run by [[mercenary|mercenaries]].&lt;ref name="WashTimes20090604"&gt;Szadkowski, Joseph, [http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/04/veterans-group-rips-gitmo-prison-game/ Vets group rips Gitmo prison video game] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215175239/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/04/veterans-group-rips-gitmo-prison-game/ |date=2011-12-15 }}, ''The Washington Times'', June 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OfficialStatement"&gt;Chishti, Zarrar, [http://www.renditionthegame.com/ Official Statement Regarding Rendition: Guantanamo] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5nahm0tSy?url=http://www.renditionthegame.com/ |date=2010-02-16 }}, ''T-Enterprise'', June 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Chishti states "T-Enterprise is against all forms of [[terrorism]] and would never seek to advocate otherwise. Furthermore, Guantanamo was to be a mercenary run institution and so there would have been NO American [[military]] personnel killed within the game. Again, we support the British and American troops that fight the war against terrorism to make the world a safer place and would not make a game that said otherwise."&lt;ref name="OfficialStatement"/&gt;

The game company was also claimed to be working with [[Al-Qaeda]], which Chishti repudiates saying, "Having clarified our position on terrorism, I would now like to refute all suggestions that the game was in any way linked to Al Qaeda. T-Enterprise has never had and would never have a link to Al Qaeda in any way, shape or form."&lt;ref name="OfficialStatement"/&gt;

'''''RuPaul's Drag Race''''' is an American [[Reality competition|reality competition]] television series produced by [[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]] for [[Logo TV]] and, beginning with the ninth season, [[VH1]]. The show documents [[RuPaul]] in the search for "America's next [[drag queen|drag]] superstar."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.rightcelebrity.com/rupauls-drag-race/201|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403120950/http://tv.rightcelebrity.com/rupauls-drag-race/201|dead-url=yes|archive-date=April 3, 2012|title="RuPaul's Drag Race"!|accessdate=October 12, 2011|last=Hughes|first=Scarlett|date=May 16, 2008|work=Right TV|publisher=Right TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series, as contestants are given different challenges each week. ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' employs a panel of judges, including RuPaul, [[Michelle Visage]], [[Ross Mathews]], [[Carson Kressley]], and a host of other guest judges, who critique contestants' progress throughout the competition. The title of the show is a play on [[drag queen]] and [[drag racing]], and the title sequence and song "Drag Race" both have a drag-racing theme.

''RuPaul's Drag Race'' has spanned ten seasons and inspired the spin-off shows ''[[RuPaul's Drag U]]'' and ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars]]''. The show has become the highest-rated television program on Logo TV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etonline.com/tv/160480_for_rupauls_drag_race_mainstream_is_jumping_the_shark/|title=For ‘RuPaul's Drag Race’ Mainstream Is Jumping the Shark|work=Entertainment Tonight}}&lt;/ref&gt; and airs internationally, including in Australia, Canada, UK, The Netherlands, and Israel. The show earned RuPaul three consecutive [[Emmy]]s (2016 to 2018) for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program. The show itself was awarded as a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] in 2018 and the Outstanding Reality Program award at the [[21st GLAAD Media Awards]]. It has been nominated for 4 [[Critics' Choice Television Award]] including Best Reality Series – Competition and Best Reality Show Host for RuPaul, and was nominated for a [[Creative Arts Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Make-up for a Multi-Camera Series or Special (Non-Prosthetic). In January 2018, casting began for season eleven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKcfnliYPnA|title=RuPaul's Drag Race Season 11: Now Casting!|work=WOWPresents YouTube Channel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2018, the show became the first show to win a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality-Competition Program]] and a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Billboard |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8475768/rupauls-drag-race-emmys-win-reaction-tweets |title='RuPaul's Drag Race's Emmys Win: See The Best Reactions |publisher=Billboard |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-host-for-a-reality-or-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &amp;#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.emmys.com/awards/nominees-winners/2018/outstanding-reality-competition-program |title=Nominees/Winners &amp;#124; Television Academy |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Casting calls are announced online, where prospective contestants submit audition tapes in hopes of being cast. All contestants selected must be 21 years of age or older at the time of taping. 

RuPaul plays several roles in the show: host, coach, and judge. ''USA Today'''s Lifeline explains: "RuPaul the drag queen will be the final word in judging and eliminations, while RuPaul the man will offer guidance to contestants for each challenge."&lt;ref name='ReferenceA'&gt;{{cite journal|title=RuPaul Leads Hopefuls in 'Drag Race.'|journal=[[USA Today]]|date=December 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' uses progressive elimination to reduce the number of drag queens in the competition from the initial field of fourteen contestants (the maximum a season has started with) down to the final three or four, who will compete in the final challenge. In Seasons 1, 2, and 3, the contestants were narrowed down to a final two, with a winner being selected the final episode. Each episode (with the exception of the casting special, "recap" episode, and reunion special) follows a format consisting of a mini challenge, a main challenge, a [[Runway (fashion)|runway]] walk (where the contestants model fashion on a runway, usually with a theme based on the main challenge), the judging panel, a lipsync battle, and the elimination of a contestant. There have been some exceptions to episodes, including double-elimination episodes, no-elimination episodes, disqualifications of a contestant, and the removal of a contestant due to an injury.

===Mini challenges===
In the mini challenge, each contestant is asked to perform a different task with varying requirements and time limitations. Certain mini challenges are repeated from season to season. For instance, the first mini challenge of the first six seasons is a photo shoot with the photographer [[Mike Ruiz]] that includes some kind of special twist (such as being doused with water while in full drag, having a high-powered fan turned on during the shoot, or being photographed while jumping on a trampoline). Another recurring mini challenge is dedicated to "reading,"  a drag term for making insulting observations about one's peers for comedic effect. The winner of a mini challenge is sometimes rewarded with some kind of advantage in the main challenge. Though most episodes have a mini challenge, select episodes do not and progress straight to the main challenge.

===Maxi challenges===
The requirements of the maxi challenge vary across each episode, and can be individual or group challenges, and initially grant [[Immunity (reality television)|immunity]] to the winner in the next challenge (until RuPaul announces the discontinuation of that policy mid-season). However, as of season 6, immunity is no longer granted to challenge winners. The winner of the maxi challenge also receives a "special" prize for their win. In the past, challenge winners have been rewarded with prizes including custom designer clothing, vacations, cruises, and quality cosmetic items. The final maxi challenge of every season up to season 8 is where the contestants star in RuPaul's music video.

The goal of each maxi challenge involves a new theme and outcome. Contestants are often asked to design and construct a custom outfit, sometimes incorporating unconventional materials. Other challenges focus on the contestants' ability to present themselves on camera, perform with music, or perform humorously. Some challenges become a tradition across seasons, such as the Snatch Game.

Beginning with the seventh season, [[Michelle Visage]], [[Ross Mathews]] and [[Carson Kressley]] are the staple judges alongside RuPaul. Visage joined the show at the start of season 3, while Mathews and Kressley joined at the start of season 7, and each joins RuPaul and Visage on alternate episodes. Past fixtures on the panel include Merle Ginsberg, who was a regular judge in the first two seasons, and [[Santino Rice]], who held his position from the first season until the conclusion of the sixth. Until season 8, Rice was the only person, apart from RuPaul, to take part in every season of the show, serving as a main judge for seasons one through six, and all stars 1, and guest judging for season seven. In certain instances, Rice was absent and replacement judging has been provided by make-up artist Billy Brasfield (better known as Billy B), [[Mike Ruiz]], Jeffrey Moran ([[Absolut Vodka]] marketing executive), or [[Lucian Piane]]. However, due to Brasfield's numerous appearances in seasons three and four, including appearing in the Reunited episodes both seasons, Rice and Billy B are considered to have been alternates for the same seat at the judges table throughout the two seasons.&lt;ref name="BillyB1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|title=Ep. 16, Episode 16, Season 3: Reunited!|publisher=[[Logo TV]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107020503/http://www.logotv.com/video/episode-16-season-3-reunited/1662947/playlist.jhtml#vid=647523|archivedate=2014-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the grande finale, the three main judges are joined by two celebrity guest judges each week. Guest judges have included [[Pam Tillis]], [[Paula Abdul]], [[Pamela Anderson]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Ariana Grande]], [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Kathy Griffin]], [[Debbie Harry]], [[Khloé Kardashian]], [[La Toya Jackson]], [[Adam Lambert]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Bob Mackie]], [[Rose McGowan]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Rebecca Romijn]], [[Gigi Hadid]], [[Sharon Osbourne]], [[Dan Savage]], [[John Waters]], [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]], [[Candis Cayne]], [[Martha Wash]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Dita Von Teese]], [[Niecy Nash]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], [[Vanessa Williams]], [[Wilmer Valderrama]], [[The Pointer Sisters]], [[Trina]], [[Leah Remini]], [[The B-52's]], [[Kesha]], [[Shania Twain]], [[Graham Norton]], [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Lady Gaga]].

The judges each provide their opinion on the contestants' performances in the main challenge and on the runway before RuPaul announces which queen is the episode's winner and which two had the weakest performances. The day before judging, the contestants are all provided with a song to which they must learn the lyrics. The contestants deemed as being the bottom two must "[[lip sync]] for their lives" to the song in a final attempt to impress RuPaul. After the lip sync, RuPaul alone decides who stays and who leaves. RuPaul describes the qualities the contestants must have to be crowned the winner of the show as "Charisma, Uniqueness, Nerve, and Talent... These are people who have taken adversity and turned it into something that is beautiful and something powerful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RuPaul's Drag Race Insider Clip |url=http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |title=WOW TV |publisher=Wow.wowtv.tv |date=October 8, 2008 |accessdate=March 18, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212030718/http://wow.wowtv.tv/episodes/rupaul-s-drag-race-insider-clip |archivedate=December 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The phrase "charisma, uniqueness, nerve, and talent" is used repeatedly on the show, the acronym of which is [[cunt|CUNT]]. On the [[RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars (season 1)|first All Stars season]], "synergy" was added to provide an explanation behind the contestants being sorted into teams (expanding the acronym into CUNTS).

===''Untucked''===
The first season of ''Drag Race'' was accompanied by a seven-episode [[web series]], titled ''Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race''. [[365Gay.com|LOGOonline]] published a [[webisode]] of ''Under the Hood'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. In this companion series, RuPaul presents a documentary of contestants' conversation in the [[green room]], replays pertinent moments from ''Drag Race'', and airs deleted footage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=RuPaul's Drag Race Season 1 |url=http://www.logotv.com/shows/rupauls_drag_race/season_1/series.jhtml |accessdate=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='WOWUnder'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldofwonder.net/2009/02/09/Under_The_Hood_of_RuPaul_s_Drag_/ |title=Under the Hood of RuPaul's Drag Race |accessdate=December 31, 2011 |last=Corfe |first=Steven |date=February 9, 2009 |work=The WOW Report |publisher=[[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the second season of ''Drag Race'' in 2010, Logo reformatted ''Under the Hood'', increased its production budget, moved it from the web to television, and re-titled it to ''RuPaul's Drag Race: Untucked''. Logo broadcast an episode of ''Untucked'' after each episode of ''Drag Race''. ''Untucked'' replaces the basic green room of ''Under the Hood'' with two decorated rooms that were until season 6 sponsored by [[Absolut Vodka]] and Interior Illusions, Inc.: the Interior Illusions Lounge and the Gold Bar. FormDecor sponsored the Lounge for season 6. These two backstage areas allow for separated group conversation.

At the start of the seventh season of the ''Drag Race'', ''Untucked'' reverted to a webseries, as part of the World of Wonder YouTube page. Instead of two decorated rooms, ''Untucked'' was moved back to the one room, an empty backstage space that connects to the main stage and work room, with couches for contestants to chat on. The newly renovated version also follows contestants following their elimination from the show, documenting them packing their belongings and leaving the set. The webseries format continued for the eighth and ninth season. For the show's tenth season, ''Untucked'' returned to television, where it airs on [[VH1]] during the 30 minute time slot after the 90 minute episode airs.

==Contestants==

Contestants of any sexual orientation or gender identity are accepted, although most contestants to date have been gay men. [[Transgender]] women are also eligible to compete and have become more common as seasons have progressed. Sonique, a season two contestant, became the first openly transgender contestant; she came out as transgender during the Season 2 reunion special.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.albanyherald.com/news/kylie-sonique-love-transitioning-into-woman-she-was-born-to/article_5b79d763-3a14-5956-b04c-a470984313ac.html|title=Kylie 'Sonique' Love transitioning into woman she was born to be|last=Fletcher|first=Carlton|work=Albany Herald|access-date=2017-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monica Beverly Hillz]], from season five, became the first transgender woman to reveal her status during the competition.&lt;ref name="Nichols"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/01/drag-race-transphobia_n_5072399.html|title=Carmen Carrera And Monica Beverly Hillz Address 'Drag Race' Transphobia Allegations|last=Nichols|first=JamesMichael|date=2014-04-01|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-09-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other transgender contestants have begun [[Transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] after their elimination.

==Awards and nominations==
{{Main|List of awards and nominations received by RuPaul's Drag Race}}
''RuPaul's Drag Race'' has been nominated for 23 [[Emmy Award]]s, and won nine. It has also been nominated for nine Reality Television Awards, winning three, and nominated for six [[NewNowNext Awards]], winning three.

==Critical reception==
Early seasons of ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' were criticized for appearing to favor 'glamorous' drag queens over comedic or [[Camp (style)|camp]] queens. For example, Popbytes commented ''Drag Race'' has been accused numerous times of keeping some of the more unpleasant but 'feminine' queens in the competition for the sake of drama {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}. However, Common Sense Media commented, "''RuPaul's Drag Race'' combines the fashion design drama of ''[[Project Runway]]'' with the modeling excitement of ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'' to create an entertainingly voyeuristic glimpse into the performance art world of drag queens. There's plenty of over-the-top stuff, but rather than simply treating drag performers as people to be laughed at and/or scorned, the show also focuses on the hard work and talent that goes into drag performances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonsensemedia.org/tv-reviews/rupauls-drag-race|title=RuPaul's Drag Race|work=commonsensemedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' cited the elimination of comedian and eventual season two fan favorite [[Pandora Boxx]] as the season's most controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/recap/rupauls-drag-race-season-2-episode-8/|title='RuPaul's Drag Race' recap: Drag mamas, Cloris Leachman, and the season's most controversial elimination!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
In March 2014, ''Drag Race'' sparked controversy over the use of the term "[[shemale]]" in the season 6 mini challenge [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 6)#Controversy|"Female or She-male?"]].&lt;ref name="Nichols"/&gt; [[Logo TV|Logo]] has since removed the segment from all platforms and has addressed the allegations of transphobia by removing the "You've got she-mail" intro from new episodes of the series. This was replaced with, "She done already done had herses!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/14/rupauls-drag-race-transphobic-slur_n_5142855.html?ncid=fcbklnkushpmg00000050|title='RuPaul's Drag Race' To Refrain From Using 'Transphobic Slur' In Wake Of Controversy|author=James Nichols|date=April 14, 2014|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Host RuPaul additionally came under fire for comments made in an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', in which he stated he would "probably not" allow a transgender contestant to compete on ''Drag Race.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/03/rupaul-drag-race-big-f-you-to-male-dominated-culture|title=RuPaul: ‘Drag is a big f-you to male-dominated culture’|last=Aitkenhead|first=Decca|date=2018-03-03|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; RuPaul compared transgender drag performers to doping athletes on his Twitter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rodriguez |first1=Mathew |title=RuPaul Just Tweeted About 'Performance Enhancing Drugs' After Trans Remarks Controversy |url=https://www.intomore.com/culture/rupaul-just-tweeted-about-performance-enhancing-drugs-after-trans-remarks-controversy/46045dd8ceae4b4f |work=INTO |date=5 March 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since apologized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Nolfi |first1=Joel |title=RuPaul tweets 'regret' over controversial transgender comments |url=http://ew.com/news/2018/03/05/rupaul-apology-transgender-comments/ |accessdate=1 August 2018 |work=EW.com |date=March 5, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Season nine winner, Sasha Velour, has expressed her disagreement via Twitter, stating "My drag was born in a community full of trans women, trans men, and gender non-conforming folks doing drag.

'''''Terp''''' is music and dance industry [[jargon]] for "dance".

== Etymology == 
The term is an [[eponym]] for [[Terpsichore]], the Greek [[muse]] of dramatic chorus and dance.&lt;ref name="Variety 2000 Feb 30" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Billboard 1949 Oct 8" /&gt; The term, still in use, was more common from the 1930s to the 1970s by dance professionals and music entertainment industry magazines, including ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', which uses the terms "terp" and "terpsichore" (lower case "t"), interchangeably.

: ''[[Ray Hackett|Hackett's]] herd churns out a highly palatable brand of terp tempi, equally appealing to the ear and toe.''&lt;ref name="Billboard 1949 Oct 8" /&gt;
: ''I wrote ''Terpsichore in Sneakers'' during the years 1973–78.&lt;ref name="Banes 1987" /&gt;
: [Reese LaRue] {{nowrap| ... }} ''known for torrid terpsichore; died Aug. 8, 1985.''&lt;ref name="Kukla 1991" /&gt;

'''The White Rats''' was a fraternal organization formed by [[vaudeville]] performers, led by [[George Fuller Golden]], as a [[trade union|labor union]] to support the rights of male performers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1901/02/22/108285123.pdf ACTORS GO ON A STRIKE(2) - Members of the "White Rats" Organization Refuse to Play.

The White Rats attempted to combat the monopolistic practices of the United Booking Office (UBO) and the [[Vaudeville Managers Association]] (VMA), groups formed by vaudeville theater managers to keep performers' wages low and control when and where performers were allowed to work. It was based on the [[Grand Order of Water Rats]], a British entertainment industry fraternity and charity.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Trav S.D.

==Strike of 1901==
Soon after the White Rats union was formed in 1900, its leadership committee attempted to negotiate with the VMA, led by [[Edward Franklin Albee II|E.F. Albee]] and [[Benjamin Franklin Keith|B.F. Keith]], to reduce or remove a 5% kickback each act was forced to pay in exchange for being booked on the lucrative VMA circuit. After negotiations failed, the White Rats called a strike in February 1901.

The Western States branch of the VMA gave in to the union's demands, and the Eastern branch went without vaudeville for two weeks. Keith and Albee called a meeting with the performers in which they claimed they themselves had been against the 5% commission, and would ask the other members of the VMA to remove it. Albee and Keith also agreed to go on the record in the press as being against the 5% commission if the strike was called off, and they did so.&lt;ref&gt;Samuels, Charles &amp; Louise. ''Once Upon A Stage: The Merry World of Vaudeville''. (New York: Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the strike was called off, and performers began to sign contracts with the VMA again in order to secure valuable long-term performing contracts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Strike of 1916==
The White Rats staged a strike in 1916 to protest poor treatment by vaudeville bookers. In retaliation, Vaudeville managers, led by Albee, created a [[blacklist]] that prevented any known members of the White Rats from working in any of the 10,000 to 15,000 theaters under his control. Performers often couldn't afford to be out of work, or to work at a reduced rate because of suspected union membership, and the strike collapsed within a year. The White Rats disbanded not long thereafter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;
