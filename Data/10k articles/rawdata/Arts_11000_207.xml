The '''2011 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts theft''' took place in two separate incidents during September and October of that year. In both instances, the same thief took a small ancient stone piece that was openly exhibited, without a protective case, and smuggled it out of [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|the museum]]. One has since been recovered; however, the thief remains unidentified and the whereabouts of the other is not known.

On September 3, one day before the anniversary of [[1972 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts robbery|the 1972 robbery of 18 paintings]], a visitor took a [[sandstone]] [[Achaemenid Empire]] [[relief]]. In late October, he returned to take a Roman marble head from its pedestal. The two works were collectively valued at $1.3 million, with the relief accounting for almost all of that amount. 

The museum did not disclose the theft until February 2012 to avoid compromising the joint investigation by its insurance company and [[Sureté du Québec]]'s [[art theft]] unit. [[Security camera]] footage allowed them to obtain a description of the thief; investigators believed he was local. A reward was offered for the return of the works.

In 2013, police were led to Simon Metke, an [[Edmonton]] man who had bought the Achaemenid piece for [[Canadian dollar|CDN$]]1,400 during a visit to Montreal two years earlier, believing it to possibly be a replica, after it was seen on a wall behind him during a [[CBC News|CBC]] interview unrelated to the case.&lt;ref name="Simon Metke arrest"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stolen artifact from Montreal museum recovered in Edmonton|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/stolen-artifact-from-montreal-museum-recovered-in-edmonton-1.2535754|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum ultimately declined to buy it back from their insurer and it was put on the market in late 2016.&lt;ref name="Royal Academy frieze page"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Charles Saumarez|last2=Philips|first2=Sam|title=What to see at Frieze 2016|url=https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/highlights-of-frieze-london-and-masters-2016|publisher=[[Royal Academy of Art]]|date=October 6, 2016|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charges laid against Metke were disposed with a [[discharge (sentence)|conditional discharge]] after he pled guilty to [[Possession of stolen goods#Canada|possession of stolen property]]. Metke's story inspired a character in [[Kevin Smith]]'s 2016 film ''[[Yoga Hosers]]'', as well as the film's title.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pruden|first=Jana|title=The Edmonton man who inspired 'Yoga Hoser' arrested for possession of a $1.2-million ancient statue|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/simon-metke-the-man-thrust-into-a-strange-world-of-canadian-art-theft/article34855605/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=April 28, 2017|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thefts==
On September 3, 2011, a visitor who came to the museum shortly after it opened removed a {{convert|20|by|21|by|3|cm|in|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="2011 theft story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Knelman|first=Joshua|title=Two valuable artifacts stolen from Montreal museum|url=https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/arts/two-valuable-artifacts-stolen-from-montreal-museum/article546106/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sandstone]] [[relief]] depicting a soldier's head, produced during the [[Achaemenid Empire]], which ruled Persia during the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref name="Press artifact return story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Montgomery|first=Sue|title=Police track down artifact stolen from Museum of Fine Arts|url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal-gazette/20140214/281651073005626|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]||via=[[PressReader]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was small and secured to the wall it was on only by an anchor, and otherwise unprotected by glass. The museum staff has not been able to determine how it was removed. Coincidentally, the theft occurred on the day before the 39th anniversary of the only other theft from the museum, the 1972 robbery of 18 paintings, all but one of which are still missing, the largest art theft in Canadian history.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

The thief returned approximately eight weeks later, in late October, at the same time of day. This time he took a 1st-century Roman marble head, approximately the same size, from its pedestal. Like the earlier piece, it was secured there by an anchor, but otherwise unprotected, not even by a glass case.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

==Investigation==

}}
When it discovered the pieces, both of which were part of the museum's permanent [[Collection (artwork)|collection]], missing, the museum called the [[Sureté du Québec]]'s (SQ) [[art theft]] unit, the only one in any Canadian provincial police force, and [[AXA]], its insurance company, which also dispatched a team of art-theft specialists. They investigated the case jointly. After reviewing [[security camera]] footage and interviewing museum staff who had been on duty the days of the thefts, they identified a suspect, a man {{convert|5|ft|7|in|cm}} tall who wore a baseball cap and dark jacket as he walked around the museum. They believed he spoke French and lived in the Montreal area.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

The museum did not publicly disclose the thefts until January 2012 in order to avoid compromising the investigation. When it did inform the news media, it released a description of the suspect and offered rewards for both the thief's identity and the safe return of the missing items.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt; It put their combined value at $1.3 million, most of which was accounted for by the older, Achaemenid piece, with the Roman head valued at a mere $40,000.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police recover item stolen from Fine Arts Museum|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/man-who-bought-stolen-artwork-didn-t-know-it-was-worth-1-2-million-1.1684657|newspaper=[[CTV Television Network|CTV]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Fossey, an archaeologist, told [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] later that he believed the two pieces had not been stolen to order but simply because they were "small [and] easy to put in the bag."&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; Another expert involved, art-theft investigator Mark Dalrymple, observed that the case was similar to a series of 2004 thefts from the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] in [[Toronto]], which also involved small objects taken by visitors while the museum was open to the public, objects whose return he had secured. He said the museum was preparing photos for dissemination worldwide. "[N]o matter where in the world these pieces go, no one can sell them", he told ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''. He advised anyone in possession of the missing art to return it immediately.&lt;ref name="2011 theft story" /&gt;

===Sale of relief===
Unbeknownst to Dalrymple or any of the other investigators, by the time he made that statement at least one of the missing pieces had already been sold. In November 2011 Simon Metke, a [[Yoga as exercise|yoga]] teacher from [[Edmonton]], travelled to Montreal for a visit.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; A friend of his there had told him that someone he knew was selling what he described as a stone sculpture of a soldier, claiming it was a genuine antiquity. As a result of his own recent spiritual explorations, Metke had developed an interest in ancient cultures, and the friend thought he might be interested in buying the sculpture.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;
[[File:Achaemenid relief of guard in Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.jpg|right|thumb|The stolen Achaemenid relief that Metke believed was merely a replica|alt=A stone panel with the head of a bearded man seen in profile, the top of his shield, and an upright spear tip on the left]]
When Metke finally saw the sculpture, actually the Achaemenid [[relief]] that had been stolen from the museum a few months earlier, he was at first skeptical. He believed it might actually be a replica, something that he might otherwise find at modern stores that sell home decor. But he appreciated the workmanship that had gone into it.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt;

The seller's asking price was [[Canadian dollar|CDN$]]1,400. According to Metke's friend, the seller was motivated. "This other guy had to pay his child support you know and pay his rent," Metke recalled later. "He edged me on that it was worth a bunch more."&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt;

Still, Metke had some lingering doubts about the item. So he did a [[Google]] search on "Are there any [[Mesopotamian]] artifacts missing?" After he had satisfied himself from the results that he was not buying something looted or stolen, he bought the item, believing that, with [[2012 phenomenon|2012]], the last year in the [[Mayan Calendar]], a month away, it was his destiny to acquire the artwork.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt; "It symbolized part of my spiritual journey to me."&lt;ref name="CBC arrest story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Stolen artifact from Montreal museum recovered in Edmonton|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/stolen-artifact-from-montreal-museum-recovered-in-edmonton-1.2535754|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=February 14, 2014|accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He thought "it would have been kind of fun" to take it to an ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'' production, or go to the [[Middle East]] himself and have it authenticated. For the time being, he packed the piece in his luggage and flew with it back to Edmonton, where the airline briefly lost the suitcase containing the relief upon his arrival. Once it was located, he took it home and put it in a [[meditation]] area he had set up in his living room.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

Later he moved it to a shelf in his bedroom, where he put it amid a collection of ''[[Star Wars (franchise)|Star Wars]]'' action figures, crystals and stuffed animals.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt; A month after returning to Edmonton, he gave an interview to a [[CBC News]] crew for a story unrelated to the artwork he had just purchased. It was, however, visible on the shelf behind him in some shots.&lt;ref name="CBC arrest story" /&gt;

==Recovery of relief and arrests==
The interview eventually led to a tip to police. In late 2013 they obtained a [[search warrant|warrant to search]] Metke's Edmonton condominium, and in January 2014 executed it. "The sun's coming in through the window, the bougainvillea flowers are glowing, the crystals are making rainbows," recalled Metke.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

A team of [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) from both [[Alberta]] and [[Quebec]], along with the SQ/AXA investigators, quickly located the relief. It was only then that Metke learned it had been stolen, and was indeed an authentic antique artifact 2,500 years old, not a replica. "I don't think he knew it was worth $1.2 million dollars either," he said of the seller.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; He felt, again, that it was destiny that had brought the relief to him. "[I]t sort of feels like it may have come to me to be protected so that it didn't get destroyed or lost."&lt;ref name="CBC Metke story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Man accused of owning stolen artifact tells his story|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/man-accused-of-owning-stolen-artifact-tells-his-story-1.2536685|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=February 13, 2014|accessdate=August 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the arrest, police suggested they had some leads on the identity of the thief.&lt;ref name="CTV recovery story" /&gt; However, as of 2017 no arrests have been made. The whereabouts of the Roman head are also unknown.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

Police charged Metke with [[Possession of stolen goods#Canada|possession of stolen property over $5,000 in value]], possession of the proceeds of a crime, and possessing a controlled substance for the purpose of trafficking, after they also found drugs in the residence. Metke's girlfriend faced the former two charges related to the relief as well.&lt;ref name="CBC arrest story" /&gt; Fossey, who was in Edmonton that day as well, flew home to Montreal with the relief that night. "It's a day I'll never forget, flying back with it in a box at my feet," he said later.&lt;ref name="Press artifact return story" /&gt; 

The museum, however, would have to consider whether to buy it back from AXA, since once it was recovered it became the insurer's legal property; commonly a buyback clause in the policy allows a museum to do this by returning the money paid. The board said it would meet to consider the possibility.&lt;ref name="Artnet recovery story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kinsella|first=Eileen|title=Stolen Artifact Returned to Montreal Museum ...

==Trial==
The Crown later [[Stay of proceedings|stayed]] two of the three charges against Metke, and all that it had laid against his girlfriend. In April 2017, he pled guilty to the possession of stolen goods charge. A statement of facts his lawyers agreed on with prosecutors said that while he clearly was unaware the relief had been stolen, he could have done more to assure himself of its [[provenance]]. In return the judge gave him a [[discharge (sentence)|conditional discharge]] with [[probation]] and [[community service]]. Both sides described the case as "unique" and "extraordinary".&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

==''Yoga Hosers''==
At the time of Metke's arrest, American filmmaker [[Kevin Smith]] discussed the story on his [[podcast]], ''[[SModcast]]'', amused by Metke's description of the bougainvillea and crystals that morning. His co-host, [[Scott Mosier]], imagined how the RCMP might have spoken to Metke, saying "Open up, yoga [[hoser]]!" The last two words became a minor [[catchphrase]] among their fans.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

In April, Smith announced he was working on a screenplay called ''[[Yoga Hosers]]''. He completed the film in time for the January 2016 [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was not based on Metke's story, but one character in the film, a [[yoga as exercise|yoga]] instructor named Yogi Bayer, was inspired by Metke. [[Justin Long]], who played Bayer, attempted to contact Metke while preparing for the role; Metke did not respond until after Long had shot his scenes.&lt;ref name="Globe and Mail Metke story" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4150">"'''Africa'''" is an 18th-century [[hymn tune]] by American choral composer [[William Billings]], who worked in New England.

==History==
Billings wrote "Africa" some time before 1770 and included it in his first published hymnbook, ''The New England Psalm Singer''.  Later he revised it, publishing a new version in his ''The Singing Master's Assistant'' (1778). He made additional revisions, publishing it again in ''Music in Miniature'' (1779).  It is the latter two versions that are performed today.

The name of the hymn is, as far as can be determined, completely arbitrary, and reflects a practice of Billings's day to give names specifically to the ''tunes'' of songs. Billings also wrote an "Asia" and an "America"; more often, he adopted the names of (arbitrarily chosen) New England towns to label his tunes.

==Music==
Version of 1778.

{{listen|filename=AfricaByWilliamBillingsPianoReduction.ogg|title="Africa"|description=Piano reduction|type=music}}
[[File:AfricaByWilliamBillings.PNG|left||600 px]]
{{clear}}
Musically, the work is notable for the parallel descending thirds and sixths that shift from part to part.  Some renditions of this hymn (for example, the practice of ''[[Sacred Harp]]'' singer) follow a practice recommended by Billings,&lt;ref&gt;Billings, ''The Continental Harmony'', preface.&lt;/ref&gt; with some male singers on the treble, singing an octave down, and some female singers on the tenor part, singing an octave higher.

==Words==
The 1770 version of "Africa" was published without lyrics.  Since it readily fits any [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] quatrain written in couplets of eight and six syllables ([[Hymn#Hymn meters|common meter]]), singers of this version would certainly have had no trouble finding lyrics to accompany it. Such quatrains are common in hymn lyrics.

For the 1778 and 1779 versions, Billings chose lyrics: the first stanza of Hymn #39 of the first volume of hymns (1709) by the noted English hymnodist [[Isaac Watts]].

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Now shall my inward joys arise,
And burst into a Song;
Almighty Love inspires my Heart,
And Pleasure tunes my Tongue.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Billings altered Watts's "joys" to "joy", although this change is not always observed by singers.  Sometimes the other stanzas by Watts are also sung to the tune of "Africa"; they are as follows:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;God on his thirsty Sion-Hill
Some Mercy-Drops has thrown,
And solemn Oaths have bound his Love
To show'r Salvation down.

Why do we then indulge our Fears,
Suspicions and Complaints?
Is he a God, and shall his Grace
Grow weary of his saints?

Can a kind Woman e'er forget
The Infant of her Womb,
And 'mongst a thousand tender Thoughts
Her Suckling have no Room?

Yet, saith the Lord, should Nature change,
And Mothers Monsters prove,
Sion still dwells upon the Heart
Of everlasting Love.

Deep on the Palms of both my Hands
I have engrav'd her Name;
My Hands shal raise her ruin'd Walls,
And build her broken Frame.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

==Reception==
"Africa" is a favorite among Billings' works, and is performed frequently on concert programs and in recordings.  It is one of several Billings' hymns included in the ''[[Sacred Harp]]'' musical tradition. It is widely sung in this context, although a comparatively recent addition to that book.

==Books==
The hymnbooks in which Billings first published "Africa" are in print today, in scholarly editions edited by Hans Nathan and published by the University Press of Virginia:

*''The New England Psalm Singer'', {{ISBN|0-8139-0917-1}}
*''The Singing Master's Assistant'' and ''Music in Miniature'' (in one volume), {{ISBN|0-8139-0839-6}}

Much of the information above is taken from these scholarly editions.

[[File:Alice Howell 1920.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Howell in 1920]]
'''Alice Howell''' (May 20, 1886 – April 11, 1961)&lt;ref&gt;Slide, Anthony. ''Silent Players: A Biographical and Autobiographical Study of 100 Silent Film Actors and Actresses.'' Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky, 2002. p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[silent film]] comedy actress from [[New York City]]. She was the mother of actress [[Yvonne Howell]].

==Biography==
Early reviews of her movies describe her as ''the scream of the screen.'' One reviewer likened her to a "sort of [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Douglas Fairbanks, Sr.]], and [[Max Linder]]."  All of this was compressed into "one more or less diminutive package of femininity." She was sometimes called "the girl Charlie Chaplin." she worked for [[Mack Sennett]] and later [[L-KO Kompany]] and her early comedies were often produced by [[Universal Pictures]].

Among more than one hundred screen credits Howell made such motion pictures as ''[[Caught in a Cabaret]]'' (1914), ''[[Mabel and Fatty's Married Life]]'' (1915), ''[[Neptune's Naughty Daughter]]'' (1917), ''[[Green Trees]]'' (1924), and ''[[Madame Dynamite]]'' (1926). ''[[Her Bareback Career]]'' (1917) was the first of twelve two reel comedies for a new corporation which was formed to manufacture and distribute Alice Howell comedies.

In this era, such female [[slapstick]] stars as Howell, [[Dorothy Devore]], and [[Billie Rhodes]] were inhibited by second-rate films and the absence of genuine star buildup.

Howell's film career continued into the sound movie era with a role as a mute servant of the master murderer in the motion picture ''The Black Ace'' (1933).

Alice Howell died in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1961, aged 74.

The '''Altar frontal from La Seu d'Urgell or of The Apostles''' is a [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[altar]] frontal currently exhibited at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Guia del Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya.pàgina 20. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work dates from the second quarter of the 12th century and comes from a church of the [[Bishop]] of [[La Seu d'Urgell]] and was acquired in 1905. It is one of the masterpieces of the collection of panel painting of the MNAC. The frontal, the item covering the front of the altar, stands out for the quality of its bright colours and because it illustrates some of the characteristics of composition in Romanesque art, such as bilateral symmetry, abstraction of the background, with no reference to space or context, and the unnatural geometrical treatment of form to be observed in the folds of the clothing. It also shows certain conventions of representation, such as so-called hierarchical perspective, which
consists in representing the chief character in a larger size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=9ba1ca9999917353f2a3de632ab4a30a7123d7e5bc3f07940be42bb77e37f6ab?inventoryNumber=015803-000&amp;lang=en The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Inauguració Sales romànic juny 2011 -Frontal Seu d'urgell 2.JPG|thumb|dreta|The Frontal exhibited at the Romanesque rooms of [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]], in Barcelona.]]

The composition is presided by the ''[[Maiestas Domini]]'', or ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'', represented in a double [[mandorla]], typical of earlier [[Carolingian art]]. According to the [[Bible]] sources inspiring the vision, the Lord's throne is the arc of Heaven and he has the Earth as his footstool. His face is framed by a cruciform halo and his expression is severe. He is holding the [[Book of Revelation]] in his left hand and blessing with his right. The [[Apostles]] figure in the lateral compartments, arranged in tiered pyramids, an original compositional formula, although it was already known in the art of the
Early Empire and also appears in the famous 11th-century Romanesque bibles of [[Rodes]] and [[Ripoll]].

The disciples are all addressing the Saviour, either with their eyes or with the inclination of their heads, and are carrying books or scrolls. [[St Peter]], furthermore, is holding the keys. Opposite him, on the other side, is [[St Paul]], with his characteristic bald head. Both the image of Christ and the quality of the yellow and red used and even the bordering on the frame are very similar to those on the [[Altar frontal from Sant Martí d'Ix|frontal from Sant Martí d’Ix]],&lt;ref&gt;(MNAC/MAC 15802)&lt;/ref&gt; which probably came from the same workshop.

This frontal was painted in [[tempera]] on a [[pine]] panel. It is one of the most characteristic representations of [[Catalan Romanesque]], showing Romanesque stylistic principles, such as bilateral symmetry and hierarchical geometric forms, as seen in the folds of the clothing. It is also noteworthy for the quality of the [[polychromy]]. The work shows similarities, especially with regard to colors and borders, to the frontal of [[Saint Martin of Ix]], indicating that probably they are from the same author or workshop.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3853">The '''American Writers Association''' ('''AWA''') was an organization formed in 1946 in opposition to an attempt to introduce a form of [[trade unionism]] for authors. Its members included writers such as [[Bruce Barton]], [[John Dos Passos]], [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]], [[James T. Farrell]], [[John T. Flynn]], [[Rupert Hughes]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Clarence Budington Kelland]], [[Clare Boothe Luce]], [[Eugene Lyons]], [[Margaret Mitchell]], [[Ayn Rand]], [[Dorothy Thompson]] and [[Louis Waldman]].&lt;ref name="moser168"&gt;{{harvnb|Moser|2005|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="burns101"&gt;{{harvnb|Burns|2009|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hoopes398"&gt;{{harvnb|Hoopes|1982|p=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization formed as a response to the "Cain Plan", a proposal put forth by the novelist and screenwriter [[James M. Cain]]. In July 1946, Cain proposed that an "American Authors' Authority" be created to act as a central repository for copyrights, and additionally negotiating collectively for authors to give them greater bargaining power. The AWA opposed this plan. Many AWA members considered the Cain Plan to be an attempt by [[Communism|Communists]] to gain control over copyrights. Flynn compared the Authority's board of governors to the [[politburo]] of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="moser168"/&gt; Cain responded by referring to members of the AWA as "reactionary, almost incomprehensibly censorious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cain Denounces Authors League |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 22, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1946, a group of 50 writers signed a joint letter to [[Elmer Rice]], president of the Authors League of America, to announce the group's formation.&lt;ref name="hoopes398"/&gt; The AWA soon found backing from radio and film producers, as well as newspaper editors and publishers.&lt;ref name="moser168"/&gt; The group held meetings and began a newsletter.&lt;ref name="burns101"/&gt; Erskine was initially elected as the group's leader,&lt;ref name="hoopes400"&gt;{{harvnb|Hoopes|1982|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was soon succeeded by Hughes.&lt;ref name="fine208"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1992|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn, Lyons and Waldman were selected for a "strategy committee".&lt;ref name="moser168"/&gt;

The Cain Plan was quickly defeated, but the AWA continued to exist for several years after. In 1949, the group supported the [[Contempt of Congress]] citations against the [[Hollywood Ten]] by the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Against Hollywood Ten |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 16, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year the AWA denounced the [[Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace]] as a "fraud", saying its Russian delegates were "prisoners" of that country's Communist authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anti-Red Session Is Hailed by Tobin |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 26, 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4511">Art competitions were held as part of the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].  Medals were awarded in five categories ([[architecture]], [[literature]], [[music]], [[painting]], and [[sculpture]]), for works inspired by sport-related themes.

[[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|Art competitions]] were part of the Olympic program from 1912 to 1948, but were discontinued due to concerns about amateurism and professionalism.  Since 1952, a non-competitive art and cultural festival has been associated with each Games.

'''Arthur Szyk''' (Polish: [ˈartur ʃɪk], June 16, 1894 &amp;ndash; September 13, 1951) was a Polish-Jewish artist who worked primarily as a [[book illustration|book illustrator]] and political artist throughout his career. Arthur Szyk was born into a prosperous middle-class [[Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Łódź]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/benz/9780199773787.article.B00178831?rskey=6Ngkwk&amp;result=1 Benezit Dictionary of Artists]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, Joseph P. Arthur Szyk: Artist, Jew, Pole. Oxford: The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2004. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; in the part of Poland which was under Russian rule in the 19th century. An acculturated Polish Jew, Szyk always proudly regarded himself both as a Pole and a Jew.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; From 1921, he lived and created his works mainly in France and Poland, and in 1937 he moved to the United Kingdom. In 1940, he settled permanently in the United States, where he was granted American citizenship in 1948.

Arthur Szyk became a renowned artist and book illustrator as early as the interwar period. His works were exhibited and published not only in Poland, but also in France, the United Kingdom, Israel and the United States. However, he gained broad popularity in the United States primarily through his political caricatures, in which, after the outbreak of World War II, he savaged the policies and personalities of the leaders of the [[Axis powers]]. After the war, he also devoted himself to political issues, especially the support of the creation of the state of [[Israel]].

Szyk's work is characterized in its material content by social and political commitment, and in its formal aspect by its rejection of [[modernism]] and embrace of the traditions of [[medieval art|medieval]] and [[renaissance art|renaissance painting]], especially [[illuminated manuscript]]s from those periods. Unlike most caricaturists, Szyk always showed great attention to the colouristic effects and details in his works.

Today, Szyk is an increasingly well-known and often exhibited artist only in his last home country, the United States. However, exhibitions in Poland and Germany are familiarizing Europe with one of the most prolific artists of World War II.

== Background and youth ==
Arthur Szyk,&lt;ref&gt;The artist's birth name was Artur Szyk, but in Western Europe and the United States he is commonly known as Arthur Szyk, which is also how he usually signed his works.&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Solomon Szyk and his wife Eugenia, was born in Łódź, in Russian-occupied Poland, on June 16, 1894. Solomon Szyk was a textile factory director, a quiet occupation until June 1905, when, during the so-called [[Łódź insurrection (1905)|Łódź insurrection]], one of his workers threw acid in his face, permanently blinding him.

[[File:Arthur Szyk (1894-1951). Portrait of Julia Szyk (1926), Paris.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Julia Szyk. Paris, 1926.]]

Szyk showed artistic talent as a child; when he was six years old, he reportedly drew sketches of the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Current Biography]]'', New York, 1946, p. 588.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though his family was culturally assimilated and did not practice [[Orthodox Judaism]], Arthur also liked drawing biblical scenes from the [[Hebrew Bible]]. These interests and talents prompted his father, upon the advice of Szyk's teachers, to send Szyk to Paris to study at [[Académie Julian]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://szyk.com/about-szyk/early-years.htm?mnHd=2&amp;mnSubHd=12 szyk.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a studio school popular among French and foreign students. In Paris, Szyk was exposed to all modern trends in art; however, he decided to follow his own way, which hewed closely to tradition. He was especially attracted by the medieval art of illuminating manuscripts, which greatly influenced his later works. When studying in Paris, Szyk remained closely involved with the social and civic life of Łódź. During the years 1912–1914 the teenage artist produced numerous drawings and caricatures on contemporary political themes that were published in the Łódź satirical magazine ''Śmiech'' ("Laughter").

After four years in France, Szyk returned to Poland in 1913 and continued his studies in [[Teodor Axentowicz]]'s class at [[Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Kraków]], which was under Austrian rule at that time. He not only attended lectures and classes, but he also actively participated in Kraków's cultural life. He did not forget his home city Łódź – he designed the stage sets and costumes for the Łódź-based Bi Ba Bo cabaret. The political and national engagement of the artist also deepened during that time – Szyk regarded himself as a Polish patriot but he was also proud of being Jewish and he often opposed [[antisemitism]] in his works. At the beginning of 1914, Szyk in a group with other Polish-Jewish artists and writers set off on a journey to Palestine, organized by the Jewish Cultural Society Hazamir ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: nightingale). There he observed the efforts of Jewish settlers working for the benefit of the future Jewish state.&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Ungar : ''Arthur Szyk : Soldier in Art'', in: ''Arthur Szyk : Drawing against National Socialism and Terror'', German Historical Museum, Berlin, 2008, pp. 12-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The visit was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I. Szyk, who was a Russian subject, had to leave Palestine, which was part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] at that time, and go back to his home country in August 1914. He was conscripted into the Russian army and fought at the [[Battle of Łódź (1914)|battle of Łódź]] in November/December 1914, but at the beginning of 1915 he managed to escape from the army and spent the rest of the war in his home city. He also used the time spent in the Russian army to draw Russian soldiers and published these drawings as postcards in the same year (1915).&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing against National Socialism and Terror'', German Historical Museum, Berlin, 2008, pp. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, 1916, Arthur Szyk married Julia Likerman. Their son George was born in the following year, and their daughter Alexandra in 1922.

== Between the wars ==

=== In reborn Poland ===
[[File:Arthur Szyk (1894-1951). Rewolucja w Niemczech (Revolution in Germany), Valkyrie (1919), Łódź, Poland.jpg|thumb|In this image from the 1919 book Rewolucja w Niemczech (Revolution in Germany), a [[Valkyrie]]-like figure stands on a globe stamped with the Iron Cross (Eisernes Kreuz).]]
After Poland had regained independence in 1918, Szyk fully developed his artistic activity, combining it with political engagement. In 1919, influenced by the events of the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]], he published, together with poet [[Julian Tuwim]], his first book of political illustrations: ''Rewolucja w Niemczech'' (''Revolution in Germany''), which was a satire on the Germans, who need the [[Kaiser]]'s and the military's consent even to start a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…'', pp. 72-73.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Szyk had to take part in warfare again – during the [[Polish–Soviet War]] (1919–1920), in which he served as a [[Polish cavalry]] officer and as the artistic director of the [[propaganda]] department of the Polish army in Łódź.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…, pp. 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In France ===
In 1921 Arthur Szyk and his family moved to Paris where they stayed until 1933. The relocation to Paris is marked by a breakthrough in the formal aspect of Szyk's works. While Szyk's prior book illustrations were drawings in pen and ink (Szyk had illustrated six books before 1925, including three published in the [[Yiddish language]]), the illustrations for the books published in Paris were full colour and full of detail. The first book illustrated in this way was the ''[[Book of Esther]]'' (''Le livre d'Esther'', 1925), followed by [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s dialogue ''[[The Temptation of Saint Anthony (Flaubert)|The Temptation of Saint Anthony]]'' (''La tentation de Saint Antoine'', 1926), [[Pierre Benoît (novelist)|Pierre Benoît]]'s novel ''Jacob's Well'' (Le puits de Jacob, 1927) and other books. Those illustrations, which are characterized by a rich diversity of colours and detailed presentation, deliberately referred to the medieval and renaissance traditions of illumination of manuscripts, often with interspersed contemporary elements. Szyk drew himself as one of the characters in the Book of Esther.. The only stylistic exception is illustrations to the two volume collection of humorous [[anecdote]]s about Jews ''Le juif qui rit'' (1926/27), in which the artist returned to simple black and white graphics. (Paradoxically, the book, one of the best known of his works, met with criticism as repeating antisemitic stereotypes.) The artist's reputation was also enhanced by exhibitions which were organized by Galeries Auguste Decour (the art gallery first exhibited Szyk's works in 1922). Szyk's drawings were purchased by the Minister of Education and Fine Arts [[Anatole de Monzie]] and the New York businessman Harry Glemby.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit. '', pp. 16-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Szyk had many opportunities to travel for his art. In 1922, he spent seven weeks in [[Morocco]], then a [[French protectorate of Morocco|protectorate of France]], where he drew the portrait of the [[pasha]] of [[Marrakech]] – as a goodwill ambassador he received the [[Ordre des Palmes Académiques]] from the French government for this work. In 1931 he was invited to the seat of the [[League of Nations]] in [[Geneva]], where he began illustrating the statute of the League. The artist made some of the pages of the statute but did not complete that work as a result of his disappointment with the policies of the organization in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…, pp. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== ''Statute of Kalisz'' and ''Washington and his Times'' ===
During his stay in France, Szyk maintained his ties with Poland. He often visited his home country, illustrated books, and exhibited his works there. During the second half of the 1920s, he mainly illustrated the ''[[Statute of Kalisz]]'', a charter of liberties which were granted to the Jews by [[Bolesław the Pious]], the Duke of [[Kalisz]], in 1264.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, Joseph P. "Art against Prejudice: Arthur Szyk's Statute of Kalisz." The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts 14 (1989): 47-63. doi:10.2307/1504027.&lt;/ref&gt; In the years 1926–1928, he created a rich graphic setting of the 45-page-long Statute, showing the contribution of the Jews to Polish society; for example their participation in Poland's pro-independence struggle, during the [[January Uprising]] of 1863, and in the [[Polish Legions in World War I]] commanded by [[Józef Piłsudski]], to whom Szyk also dedicated his work. ''The Statute of Kalisz'' was published in book form in [[Munich]] in 1932, but it gained popularity even earlier. Postcards with reproductions of Szyk's illustrations were published in Kraków around 1927. The original art was shown at exhibitions in [[Warsaw]], Łódź and Kalisz in 1929, and a "Traveling Exhibition of Artur Szyk's Works" was held in 1932–1933, displaying the Statute at exhibitions in 14 Polish towns and cities. In recognition for his work, Arthur Szyk was decorated with the Gold [[Cross of Merit (Poland)|Cross of Merit]] by the Polish government.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The original paintings for the Statute are now in the [[Jewish Museum (New York)|Jewish Museum]] in New York City.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another great historical series Szyk created was ''Washington and his Times'', which he began in Paris in 1930. The series, which included 38 [[watercolor painting|watercolours]], depicted the events of the [[American Revolutionary War]] and was a tribute to the first president of the United States and the American nation in general. The series was presented at an exhibition at the [[Library of Congress]] in Washington, D.C. in 1934. It brought another decoration to Szyk – this time the George Washington Bicentennial Medal from the American government.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit. '', pp. 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Washington and his Times'' was published in book form in [[Vienna]] in 1932. The originals of the watercolours were presented by the President of Poland [[Ignacy Mościcki]] to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1935. They are now stored at the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum]] in [[Hyde Park, New York]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The ''Haggadah'' and moving to London. ===

This sketch depicts the newly appointed Chancellor of Germany [[Adolf Hitler]] dressed as an ancient Egyptian [[pharaoh]], a clear reference to the antagonist in the biblical story of the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] of the Hebrew slaves from Egypt.]]

Szyk's art became even more politically engaged when [[Adolf Hitler]] took power in Germany in 1933. Szyk started drawing caricatures of Germany's Führer as early as 1933; probably the first was a pencil drawing of Hitler dressed as an ancient Egyptian [[pharaoh]].&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…'', pp. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; These drawings anticipated another great series of Szyk's drawings – the ''[[Haggadah of Pesach|Haggadah]]'', which is considered his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''. The ''Haggadah'' is a very important and popular story in Jewish culture and religion about the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] or departure of the [[Israelites]] from [[ancient Egypt]], which is read every year during the [[Passover Seder]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare the complete Hebrew and English texts of the ''Hagaddah'' on website [http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/1735/jewish/The-Haggadah.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; Szyk illustrated the Haggadah in 48 miniature paintings in the years 1934–1936. The antisemitic politics in Germany led Szyk introduce some contemporary elements to it. For example, he painted the Jewish [[parable]] of the Four Sons, in which the "wicked son" was portrayed as a man wearing German clothes, with a Hitler-like moustache and a green Alpine hat. The political intent of the series was even stronger in its original version: he painted upon the red snakes the swastika, the symbol of the [[Third Reich]].

In 1937, Arthur Szyk went to London to supervise the publication of the ''Haggadah''. However, in the three years leading to its publication, the artist had to agree to many compromises, including painting over the swastikas. It is not clear whether he did it under the pressure from his publisher or from British politicians who pursued the policy of [[appeasement]] with to Germany. The ''Haggadah'' was at last published in 1940, dedicated it to King [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] and with a translation (of the Hebrew) and commentary by British Jewish historian Cecil Roth. The work was widely acclaimed by critics; according to ''[[The Times]]'' of London Literary Supplement, it was "worthy to be placed among the most beautiful of books that the hand of man has ever produced".&lt;ref&gt;[http://szyk.com/szyk-haggadah/ The Szyk Haggadah]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit. '' pp. 19-23.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the most expensive new book in the world at the time, with each of the 250 limited edition copies of vellum selling for 100 guineas or USD$520.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York World's Fair, 1939===
The last major exhibition of Szyk's works before the outbreak of World War II was the presentation of his paintings at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], which opened in April 1939 in New York.&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…'', pp. 88-89.&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish Pavilion prominently featured Szyk's twenty-three paintings depicting the contribution of the Poles to the history of the United States; many works specifically highlighted the historic political connections between the two countries, as if to remind the viewer that Poland remained a suitable ally in a turbulent time.. (Twenty of the images were reproduced as postcards in Kraków in 1938 and were available for sale.). In this series, Szyk depicted the contribution of the Poles to the history of the United States, and highlighted historic connections between the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction to the outbreak of the war ===

The German invasion of Poland found Szyk in Britain where he supervised the publication of the ''Haggadah'' and continued to exhibit his works. The artist immediately reacted to the outbreak of World War II by producing war-themed works.  One feature which distinguished Szyk from other caricaturists who were active during World War II was that he concentrated on the presentation of the enemy in his works and seldom depicted the leaders or soldiers of the Allies. This was a characteristic feature of Szyk's work till the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1940, the exhibition of his 72 caricatures entitled ''War and "Kultur" in Poland'' opened at the Fine Art Society in London, and was well received by the critics. As the reviewer of ''[[The Times]]'' wrote:

{{Quote|There are three leading motives in the exhibition: the brutality of the Germans – and the more primitive savagery of the Russians, the heroism of the Poles, and the suffering of the Jews. The cumulative effect of the exhibition is immensely powerful because nothing in it appears to be a hasty judgment, but part of the unrelenting pursuit of an evil so firmly grasped that it can be dwelt upon with artistic satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;''Polish War Satires : Miniatures by Mr Szyk'', in: ''The Times'', January 11, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Szyk drew more and more caricatures directed at the Axis powers and their leaders, and his popularity steadily grew. In 1940, the American publisher [[G.P. Putnam's Sons]] offered to publish a collection of his drawings. Szyk agreed, and the result was the 1941 book ''The New Order'', available months before the United States joined the war. [[Thomas Craven]] declared on the dust jacket of ''The New Order'' that Szyk:
{{Quote|…makes not only cartoons but beautifully composed pictures which suggest, in their curiously decorative quality, the inspired illuminations of the early religious manuscripts. His designs are as compact as a bomb, extraordinarily lucid in statement, firm and incisive in line, and deadly in their characterizations. (…) These are remarkable documents.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Szyk, ''The New Order'', New York, 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some years later, in 1946, art critic [[Carl Clinton Van Doren|Carl Van Doren]] said of Szyk:
{{Quote|There is no one more certain to be alive two hundred years from now. Just as we turn back to Hogarth and Goya for the living images of their age, so our descendants will turn back to Arthur Szyk for the most graphic history of Hitler and Hirohito and Mussolini. Here is the damning essence of what has happened; here is the piercing summary of what men have thought and felt.}}

=== Moving to the United States and war caricatures ===

At the beginning of July 1940, with the support of the British government and the [[Polish government-in-exile]], Arthur Szyk left Britain for North America, on assignment to popularize in the New World the struggle of the British and Polish nations against [[Nazism]]. His first destination on the continent was Canada, where he was welcomed enthusiastically by the media: they wrote about his engagement in the fight with Nazi Germany, and the Halifax-based ''[[The Chronicle Herald|Morning Herald]]'' even reported about the alleged bounty Hitler had put on Szyk.&lt;ref&gt;''The Morning Herald'', July 13, 1940. The information about the alleged bounty was also repeated by American media, but it is not confirmed by reliable sources.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1940, Szyk and his wife and daughter went to New York City, where he lived till 1945. His son, George, had enlisted in the [[Free French Forces]] commanded by General [[Charles de Gaulle]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 23-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his arrival in the U.S., Szyk was inspired by Roosevelt's 1941 "[[Four Freedoms]]" [[State of the Union]] speech to illustrate the Four Freedoms, preceding [[Norman Rockwell]]'s Four Freedoms by two years;&lt;ref&gt;"Visualizing the Four Freedoms: FDR's Fighting Artist Arthur Szyk" by Allison Claire Chang, ''The Nation'', January 8, 2016 (online only)&lt;/ref&gt; these were used as [[poster stamp]]s during the war, and appeared on the Four Freedoms Award which was presented to [[Harry Truman]], [[George Marshall]] and [[Herbert H. Lehman]]. Szyk became an immensely popular artist in his new home country the war, especially after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] and the entry of the United States into the war. His caricatures of the leaders of the Axis powers (Hitler, Mussolini, Hirohito) and other drawings appeared practically everywhere: in newspapers, magazines (including ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]] (cover caricature of Admiral [[Isoroku Yamamoto]] in December 1941)'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', and ''[[Collier's]]''), on posters, postcards and stamps, in secular, religious and military publications, on public and military buildings. He also produced advertisements for [[Coca-Cola]] and [[U.S. Steel]], and exhibited in the galleries of M. Knodler &amp; Co., Andre Seligmann, Inc., Messrs. Wildenstein &amp; Co., the [[Philadelphia Art Alliance]], the [[Brooklyn Museum]], the [[Palace of the Legion of Honor]] in San Francisco, and the [[White House]]. More than 25 exhibitions were staged altogether in the United States during the war years. At the end of the war, in 1945, his drawing ''Two Down and One to Go'' was used in a propaganda film calling American soldiers to the final assault on Japan. According to the ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, the posters with Szyk's drawings enjoyed even bigger popularity with American soldiers than [[pin-up girl]]s put on the walls of American military bases.&lt;ref&gt;''The Answer'', New York, September 1945, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; In total, more than one million American soldiers saw Szyk's in reproduction at some 500 locations administered by the United Services Organization.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell, 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Morton Weinstein presenting Eleanor Roosevelt with a book by Arthur Szyk - NARA - 195394.jpg|thumb|left|[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] presented with an Arthur Szyk work in 1956. Szyk himself died 5 years earlier.]]

In recognition for his services in the fight against Nazism, [[Fascism]], and the Japanese aggression, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], First Lady and wife of President F. D. Roosevelt, wrote about Szyk several times in her newspaper column, ''My Day''.&lt;ref&gt;George Washington University, The Eleanor Roosevelt Papers Project, "My Day" electronic edition: https://www.gwu.edu/~erpapers/myday/ Accessed May 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 8, 1943, she wrote:

{{Quote|...I had a few minutes to stop in to see an exhibition of war satires and miniatures by Arthur Szyk at the Seligman Galleries on East 57th Street. This exhibition is sponsored by the Writers' War Board. I know of no other miniaturist doing quite this kind of work. In its way it fights the war against Hitlerism as truly as any of us who cannot actually be on the fighting fronts today.}}

=== Social justice on the home front  ===
Though Szyk was a fierce opponent of [[Nazi Germany]] and the rest of the [[Axis Powers]], he did not avoid topics or themes which presented the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in a less favourable light. Szyk criticized the United Kingdom for its policies in the Middle East, especially its practice of imposing limits on Jewish emigration to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Despite the fact that the British government had provided for the creation of a Jewish state in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]], in May 1939, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] passed the so-called [[White Paper of 1939|White Paper]], which limited the number of Jewish immigrants to the Holy Land to 10,000 yearly, a policy that had tragic consequences for the Jews in Hitler-occupied Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;) Szyk also criticized the apparent passivity of American-Jewish organizations towards the tragedy of their European fellows.&lt;ref&gt;The rescue of European Jewry was personal for Szyk: his mother and his brother were in the ghettos of Łódź. (Ultimately Szyk's mother, Eugenia Szyk, and possibly her Polish-Christian companion, was murdered at the [[Chełmno extermination camp]] in 1942. See Luckert, The Art and Politics of Arthur Szyk, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the work of [[Hillel Kook]], also known as Peter Bergson, a member of the [[Zionism|Zionist]] organization [[Irgun]], who mounted a publicity campaign in American society whose aim was to draw the American public's attention to the fate of the European Jews. Szyk illustrated for example full-page advertisements (sometimes with copy by screenwriter [[Ben Hecht]]) which were published in ''[[The New York Times]]''. The artist also spoke against racial tensions in the United States and criticized the fact that the black population did not have the same rights as the whites. In one of his drawings, there are two American soldiers – one black and one white – escorting German prisoners of war. When the white one asks the black: "And what would you do with Hitler?", the black one answers: "I would have made him a Negro and dropped him somewhere in the U.S.A."&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Szyk's attitude to his mother country, Poland, was very interesting and full of contradictions. Even though he regarded himself both as Jewish and Polish and showed the suffering of the Poles (not only those of Jewish descent) in the Russian-occupied Polish territories in his drawings, even though he benefited from financial support of the [[Polish government-in-exile]] (at least at the beginning of the war), Szyk sometimes presented that government in a negative light, especially at the end of World War II. In a controversial drawing dated 1944, a group of debating Polish politicians are shown as opponents of Roosevelt, [[Joseph Stalin]], the "Bolshevik agent" [[Winston Churchill]], and at the same time adherents of Father [[Charles Coughlin]], known for his antisemitic  views, as well as "(national) democracy"&lt;ref&gt;Szyk alludes to the [[National Democracy]], a pre-war right-wing political movement in Poland, known for its nationalistic and antisemitic views.&lt;/ref&gt; and "(national) socialism." Around 1943, Szyk, a former participant in the Polish–Soviet War, also completely changed his opinions on the Soviet Union. His drawing from 1944 already depicts outright a soldier of the Moscow-supported [[People's Army of Poland]] next to a [[Red Army]] soldier, both liberating Poland.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever his political views, in July 1942 Szyk took the time to look after the family of the Polish diplomat and poet General [[Bolesław Wieniawa-Długoszowski]] when the General committed suicide. He invited his wife [[Bronisława Wieniawa-Długoszowska]] and daughter Zuzanna to stay with his family for six weeks in the country.

=== Book illustrations ===

Even though caricatures dominated Szyk's artistic output during the war, he was still engaged in other areas of art. In 1940, the American publisher [[George Macy]], who saw his illustrations for the ''Haggadah'' at an exhibition in London, asked him to illustrate the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat]]'', a collection of poems of the Iranian poet [[Omar Khayyám]].&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…'', pp. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, the artist started work on illustrations for the ''[[Book of Job]]'', published in 1946; he also illustrated collections of fairy tales by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (''Andersen's Fairy Tales'', 1945) and [[Charles Perrault]] (''[[Mother Goose]]'', which was not published).&lt;ref&gt;''Arthur Szyk : Drawing…'', pp. 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postwar: final years ==
In 1945, Arthur Szyk and his family moved from New York City to [[New Canaan, Connecticut]] where he lived till the end of his life. The end of the war released him from the duty to fight Nazism through his caricatures; a large collection of drawings from the war period was published by the Heritage Press in 1946 in book form as ''Ink and Blood: A Book of Drawings''. The artist returned to book illustrations, working for example on ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] and, most notably, books telling [[Bible]] stories, such as ''Pathways through the Bible'' by Mortimer J. Cohen (1946), ''The Book of Job'' (1946), ''The Book of Ruth'' (1947), ''The Ten Commandments'' (1947), ''The Story of Joseph and his Brothers'' (1949). Some of the books illustrated by Szyk were also published posthumously, including ''The Arabian Nights Entertainments'' (1954) and ''The Book of Esther'' (1974). He was also commissioned by Canadian entrepreneur and stamp connoisseur, [[Kasimir Bileski]], to create illustrations for the Visual History of Nations (or [[United Nations]]) series of stamps; though the project never came to fruition, Szyk did design stamp album frontispieces for more than a dozen countries, including the United States, Poland, the United Kingdom, and Israel.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Arthur Szyk was granted American citizenship on May 22, 1948, but he reportedly experienced the happiest day in his life eight days earlier: on May 14, the day of the announcement of the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;Compare the memoirs of Julia Szyk, the artist's wife, who recorded her husband's reaction to that event. Her memoirs are kept by The Arthur Szyk Archives in Burlingame, California.&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur Szyk commemorated that event by creating the richly decorated illumination of the Hebrew text of the declaration. Two years later, on July 4, 1950, he also exhibited the richly illuminated text of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. The artist continued to be politically engaged in his country, criticizing the [[McCarthyism]] policy (the ubiquitous atmosphere of suspicion and searching for sympathizers of [[communism]] in American artistic and academic circles) and signs of [[racism]]. One of his well-known drawings from 1949 shows two armed members of [[Ku Klux Klan]] approaching a tied-up African American; the caption for the drawing reads, "Do not forgive them, oh Lord, for they do know what they do." Like many outspoken artists of his era, Szyk was suspected by the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], which accused him of being a member of the [[Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee]] and six other suspicious organizations. Szyk himself, however, repudiated these accusations of alleged sympathy for communism; his son George sent Judge Simon Rifkind a memorandum outlining his father's innocence.&lt;ref&gt;Ansell. p232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arthur Szyk died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in New Canaan on September 13, 1951.&lt;ref&gt;I. Ungar, ''op. cit.'', pp. 29-31.&lt;/ref&gt; He was eulogized by Rabbi [[Ben Zion Bokser]], who said: {{quotation |:"Arthur Szyk was a great artist. Endowed by God with a rare sensitivity to beauty and with a rare skill in giving it graphic representation, he used his talents to create a series of works of splendor and magnificence that will live forever in the history of art. But Arthur Szyk was more than a great artist. He was a great man, a champion of justice, a fearless warrior in the cause of every humanitarian endeavor. His art was his tool and he used it brilliantly. It was in his hands a weapon of struggle with which he fought for the causes close to his heart"; and by Judge Simon H. Rifkind, who said: "The Arthur Szyk whom the world knows, the Arthur Szyk of the wondrous color, and of the beautiful design, that Arthur Szyk whom the world mourns today—he is indeed not dead at all. How can he be when the Arthur Szyk who is known to mankind lives and is immortal and will remain immortal as long as the love of truth and beauty prevails among mankind?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.szyk.org/tributes.html The Arthur Szyk Society – Eulogies and Tributes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101106111605/http://www.szyk.org/tributes.html |date=November 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Legacy ==
[[File:Houston Holocaust Museum Advertisement.JPG|thumb|Exhibition of Szyk's works at the [[Holocaust Museum Houston]]]]

The immense popularity Szyk enjoyed in the United States and Europe in his lifetime gradually flagged after his death. From the 1960s to the end of the 1980s, the artist's works were seldom exhibited in American museums. This changed in 1991 when the non-profit organization [[Arthur Szyk Society|The Arthur Szyk Society]] was established in [[Orange County, California]]. The founder of the Society, George Gooche, rediscovered Szyk's works and staged the exhibition "Arthur Szyk – Illuminator" in Los Angeles. In 1997, the seat of the Society was transferred to [[Burlingame, California]], and a new Board of [[Trustee]]s was elected, headed by rabbi, curator and antiquarian [[Irvin Ungar]]. The Society's work resulted in staging many exhibitions of Szyk's works in American cities in the 1990s and 2000s. The Society also maintains a large educational website,&lt;ref&gt;[http://szyk.org See The Arthur Szyk Society's website]&lt;/ref&gt; holds lectures, and produces publications on the artist. In April 2017, the Ungar collection of his work, consisting of 450 paintings, drawings and sketches, was purchased for $10.1 million by the [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s [[Magnes Collection of Jewish Art and Life]], through a donation by Taube Philanthropies, the largest single monetary gift to acquire art in UC Berkeley history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Magnes-museum-gets-big-collection-of-Jewish-art-11044902.php]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/04/03/gift-to-the-magnes-collection-of-jewish-art-and-life/]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3142">'''Construction grips''' work on film and television sound stages and exterior sets both on and off [[Movie_studio|Motion Picture Studio Lots]] for various cinema projects in countries all over the world. Some studios are actually warehouses or buildings that have been converted into film and or television studios. An exterior set could just be one of the many facades built on or about a studio lot outside of the sound stages. However, it is quite common to see projects being filmed off lot, in and around the city.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://study.com/articles/Grip_Job_Description_Duties_and_Requirements.html study.com, Grip Job Description ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction [[key grip]] and his crew work with the [[construction coordinator]] and his [[carpenter]]s to execute any sets or set pieces that need to be erected or installed. The key is chosen and directed by the construction coordinator. Though, they are ostensibly of equal rank,(actually they are not equal in rank, since the construction coordinator answers directly to the production for the cost and coordination of set related tasks) the construction coordinator generally determines the order of work.

The division of labor is basic: The coordinator and his carpenters build the components of the set, the construction grips erect, level, and plumb the set only if it is a set that has already been seen on camera. New construction is handled entirely by the carpenters (known as [[Propmaker|Propmakers]]). Then the carpenters trim the set in preparation for the [[scenic artist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalinfo.org/96/962687022.html occupationalinfo.org, grips]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the construction grips accomplish any rigging that may need to be done. This could be flying set pieces or facades, mounting and securing them onto existing structures or hanging and building pipe grids over and above the sets to hang lighting and other equipment from. Construction grips also build stable catwalks around and above the sets for people to walk on and or hang and attach more stuff to. Operating heavy machinery is required in most cases; in some regions this is done by the [[International_Brotherhood_of_Teamsters|Teamsters]]. They are also responsible for any backdrops that need to be hung.

Once complete, as per schedule, the [[Film_crew|shooting crew]] eventually comes in. The set is generally handed over to the regular shooting [[Grip (job)|grip]]s, unless there is a particularly large or complex piece that must be moved at a particular time.

The construction grip department, in general, is also traditionally charged with the safety of the construction crew, engendering other various labors for the construction grips: the shop and set, (until it is turned over to the [[Set_dresser|set dressers]]), must be maintained free of debris, and lumber and building materials must be stowed or racked in a safe, neat, and accessible manner.

==Storylines==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}

===Season 1===
Suzanne is fixated on Piper Chapman ([[Taylor Schilling]]) at the beginning of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/04/showbiz/tv/orange-is-the-new-black-season-2/|title='Orange is the New Black': Five things to expect from season 2|accessdate=September 6, 2014|date=June 6, 2014|publisher=[[CNN]]|author=Leopold, Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Chapman, who has offended prison matriarch Red ([[Kate Mulgrew]]), seems hopelessly isolated, Suzanne is the only inmate not too intimidated to help her. She helps Chapman by getting [[jalapeños]], so she can put them in a medicinal lotion for Red's sore back, and Red forgives Chapman. Suzanne nicknames Chapman "Dandelion", because of her blonde hair and puts in a request to become Chapman's bunkmate. Nonetheless, Chapman resists her advances.&lt;ref name=OITNBS1raotne&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/orange-is-the-new-black-heres-your-recap-ahead-of-season-2-9486431.html|title=Orange Is The New Black: Season 1 recap ahead of the new episodes|accessdate=September 6, 2014|date=June 4, 2014|website=[[The Independent]]|author=Hooton, Christopher}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OISNBS1R&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/orange-new-black-season-1-recap-everything-know-season-2-premiere-1593957|title='Orange Is The New Black' Season 1 Recap: Everything To Know Before The Season 2 Premiere|accessdate=September 6, 2014|date=June 3, 2014|website=[[International Business Times]]|author=Schaefer, Megan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/06/visual-summary-orange-is-the-new-black-season-1.html|title=Visual Summary: Orange Is The New Black Season 1|accessdate=September 6, 2014|date=June 19, 2014|website=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|author=Foster, Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Suzanne urinates on the floor in Chapman's bunk quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/orange-is-the-new-black-uzo-aduba-crazy-eyes-promoted-to-series-regular_article_82973|title=Orange Is The New Black: Uzo Aduba (Suzanne Warren) Promoted To Series Regular|accessdate=September 6, 2014|date=August 14, 2013|publisher=[[Access Hollywood]]|author=O'Sullivan, Erin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In episode 9, "Fucksgiving", her white adoptive parents, Pat and Dennis Warren, are introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/orange-is-the-new-black-recap-season-1-episode-9.html|title= Orange Is the New Black Episode Nine Recap: We Finally Experience the SHU|accessdate=September 6, 2014|date=August 16, 2013|website=[[Vulture.com|Vulture]]|author=Henderson, Danielle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/orange-is-the-new-black/fcksgiving-2827564/cast/|title= Orange is the New Black Season 1 Episode 9: F*cksgiving: Episode Cast &amp; Crew|accessdate=September 6, 2014|publisher=[[TV.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 2===
As she rebounds from her unrequited love for Chapman, Suzanne is befriended by veteran inmate Yvonne "Vee" Parker ([[Lorraine Toussaint]]) as Vee develops her powerbase in the prison. Vee takes advantage of Suzanne's desperation for affection, and Suzanne becomes Vee's fanatically loyal right-hand woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewrap.com/orange-is-the-new-black-star-uzo-aduba-on-crazy-eyes-people-underestimate-her-video/|title='Orange Is the New Black' Star Uzo Aduba on 'Crazy Eyes': 'People Underestimate Her' (Video)|accessdate=September 6, 2014|date=July 22, 2014|website=[[The Wrap]]|author=Reed, Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Suzanne serves Vee as muscle, even beating up her friend Poussey Washington ([[Samira Wiley]]) on Vee's orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/orange-is-the-new-black/community/post/orange-is-the-new-black-season-2-review-part-2-140267649464/|title=Orange Is the New Black Season 2 Review, Part 2 (Episodes 7-13): Fight the Power|accessdate=September 6, 2014|publisher=[[TV.com]]|author=Surette, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Vee attacks prison matriarch Galina "Red" Reznikov ([[Kate Mulgrew]]) and puts her in the hospital ward, she manipulates Suzanne into believing that she committed the crime. Suzanne gives a statement to prison officials confessing to the attack, but inmate counselor Sam Healy ([[Michael J. Harney]]) produces evidence that exonerates her. When she realizes that Vee used her, she breaks into tears.

In episode 3, "Hugs Can Be Deceiving", Suzanne's backstory is revealed via a flashback. She was adopted by white parents and raised in the suburbs, but her mental instability alienated her classmates and their parents alike. Her adoptive mother pushed her to excel at everything she did to prove that she was as good as everyone else; ironically, the constant pressure only made Suzanne's psychological problems worse. In the same episode, it is revealed that Suzanne had run outside and knocked Chapman unconscious after Chapman had beaten [[Tiffany Doggett|Tiffany "Pennsatucky" Doggett]] ([[Taryn Manning]]) unconscious at the end of season 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/orange-is-the-new-black/community/post/orange-is-the-new-black-season-2-review-140195141813/|title=Orange Is the New Black Season 2 Review, Part 1 (Episodes 1&amp;ndash;6): Conflict Over Community|accessdate=September 6, 2014|publisher=[[TV.com]]|author=Surette, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 3===
In season 3, Taystee has her hands full trying to control Suzanne, who is still grieving Vee's death and is unstable, prone to losing her temper and constantly fighting with Poussey.  Eventually, she turns to new prison counsellor Berdie Rogers's drama class. There, she begins writing a surrealistic science-fiction erotica series called "''The Time Hump Chronicles''" which, although considered obscene and strange by both Rogers and Taystee, becomes an instant hit amongst the inmates. Although they prove to be therapeutic for her mental health, Suzanne becomes stressed and irritated with the constant harassment by the other inmates for more material, the persistent ideas that are being floated past her and the fan-fiction that is left at her bunk or lying around. Soon, some of the extracts find their way into the hands of the COs, resulting in Officer Donaldson being mocked by both his colleagues and the inmates alike upon the realization that he is the inspiration for one of the characters. This leads to Rogers' suspension. Meanwhile, Suzanne is taken by surprise when she discovers that one of her more prolific fans, [[Maureen Kukudio]], is actually interested in her romantically.  Suzanne seeks advice from Lorna about how to respond; she admits she finds Maureen attractive, but she has never had a girlfriend before and subsequently feels she must back away from a sexual liaison. In the season finale, Suzanne assists Poussey and Taystee in caring for Brook Soso, whom they discover unconscious from a drug overdose, and develops a closer bond with Maureen in the final scene, owing to a misunderstanding over a turtle that bites Maureen's foot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bustle.com/articles/90452-who-is-crazy-eyes-love-interest-on-orange-is-the-new-black-emily-althaus-character-has&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 4===
In season 4 it is revealed that Suzanne's crime was kidnapping and involuntary  manslaughter of a child she grew friendly with while working as a store greeter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harnick|first1=Chris|title=Orange Is the New Black Reveals Crazy Eyes' Tragic Crime|url=http://www.eonline.com/au/news/773771/orange-is-the-new-black-reveals-crazy-eyes-tragic-crime|website=ENews|accessdate=18 September 2017|date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believing that she and the boy were simply being friends, she did not realize the implications of her actions when she came across him playing in the park and invited him to her apartment for ice cream and video games.  The boy went willingly, but soon became frightened and wanted to call his dad. While Suzanne is out of the room preparing for what she plans as more fun, he calls 911.  Suzanne becomes agitated as she tells him that 911 should only be called when there is an emergency.  The child panics and tries to get away.  He goes onto the fire escape and falls to his death. It is mentioned that she took a plea deal. When the inmates take advantage of a temporary lack of security and enjoy the nearby lake and woods, Kukudio insists that she and Suzanne run away together.  Suzanne refuses and their relationship becomes rocky.  In "People Persons", CO Humphrey commands the two of them to fight.  Suzanne rejects this but Maureen, who wants to fight, provokes her by launching into a stream of insults. Suzanne fully retaliates by throwing Maureen to the ground and beating her repeatedly, until the Dominicans pull her off. This fight leads her to extreme guilt and a wish to punish herself. She demonstrates this especially when a peaceful protest in the jail cafeteria turns into a chaotic scene and Poussey Washington dies by suffocation. Whilst the inmates grieve over her death, Suzanne believes that Poussey is alive and tries numerous times to suffocate herself. Finally, she is sent to Medical and is placed in a bed next to Kukudio.

===Season 5===
In season five, Suzanne continues to recover from her injuries and also goes out of her way to help Maureen, whose injuries are severe.  The chaos of the riot prevents the consistency she is used to and has a hard time adjusting.  Other inmates try to mimic the consistency for her at times. She continues to believe that Poussey's spirit is trying to talk to her and performs a seance on the spot in the cafeteria where Poussey died. Lorna and Nicky take over the dispensation of meds; Lorna refuses to give Suzanne hers, pressuring her to believe she no longer needs them. As a result, Suzanne's grasp on reality soon spirals out of control, especially when she tears down fiberboard in the dorm ceiling, trying to find "heaven". Cindy intervenes but, not knowing the correct prescriptions, feeds Suzanne lithium instead.  Suzanne becomes catatonic but is subsequently revived by an epipen.

===Season 6===
At the beginning of Season 6, during the aftermath of the riot, Suzanne is being interrogated about the riot but, due to not using her medication, has hallucinations and does not coherently answer the questions.  She finally gets her medication and is released to general population after being in Administrative Segregation (Ad Seg).  She is sent to B Block which is nicknamed "Florida" because it is for the elderly and mentally ill prisoners. When the prison restarts the kickball league that had been discontinued years before, she joins and quickly becomes a star player.

'''Day Without Art''' ('''DWA''') is an annual event where art museums and other organizations organize programs to raise awareness of [[AIDS]], remember people who have died, and inspire positive action.

== History ==

Day Without Art began on December 1, 1989 as the national day of action and mourning in response to the AIDS crisis, which had rapidly and conspicuously decimated the artistic community. To make the public aware that [[AIDS]] can touch everyone, and inspire positive action, some 800 U.S. art and AIDS groups participated in the first Day Without Art, shutting down museums, sending staff to volunteer at AIDS services, or sponsoring special exhibitions of work about AIDS. Since then, Day With(out) Art has grown into a collaborative project in which an estimated 8,000 national and international museums, galleries, art centers, [[AIDS service organization]]s, libraries, high schools and colleges take part.

In the past, "Visual AIDS" initiated public actions and programs, published an annual poster and [[public domain|copyright-free]] [[Broadside (printing)|broadsides]], and acted as press coordinator and [[wikt:clearing house|clearing house]] for projects for Day Without Art/[[World AIDS Day]]. In 1997, it was suggested Day Without Art become a '''Day ''With'' Art''', to recognize and promote increased programming of cultural events that draw attention to the continuing [[pandemic]]. Though "the name was retained as a [[metaphor]] for the chilling possibility of a future day without art or artists", we added parentheses to the program title, '''Day With(out) Art''', to highlight the proactive programming of art projects by artists living with HIV/AIDS, and art about AIDS, that were taking place around the world. It had become clear that active interventions within the annual program were far more effective than actions to negate or reduce the programs of cultural centers. In 2014, the Los Angeles art collective, My Barbarian, staged a video performance in remembrance of [[Pedro Zamora]], inspired by the queer theorist, [[José Esteban Muñoz]]'s theory of counterpublicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.visualaids.org/blog/detail/tavia-nyongo#_edn3|title = The video is a remembrance within a remembrance: to Pedro Zamora and to José Esteban Muñoz.|last = AIDS|first = Visual|website = Visual AIDS|access-date = 2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==

The inaugural Day without Art exhibition held in [[New Zealand]] opened on 1 December 1995, at the [[Southland Museum and Art Gallery]].  Curated by Wayne P. Marriott, the installation was undertaken by Daniel McKnight, Vicky Byrne and Marriott.  In 1996 the Southland Museum and Art Gallery was awarded a New Zealand AIDS Foundation media award for its work in promoting a better understanding of the impact of HIV/AIDS on the wider community.  The museum continued to annually host a Day without Art exhibition until 1999.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7763">'''Eau de Cologne''' ({{IPA-fr|o d(ə) kɔlɔɲ|lang}}; German: '''''Kölnisch Wasser''''' {{IPA-de|ˈkœlnɪʃ ˈvasɐ|}}; meaning "Water from Cologne"), or simply '''cologne''', is a [[perfume]] originating from [[Cologne]], [[Germany]]. Originally mixed by [[Johann Maria Farina]] in 1709, it has since come to be a generic term for scented formulations in typical concentration of 2–5% and also more depending upon its type [[essential oil]]s or a blend of extracts, alcohol, and water. 
In a base of dilute [[ethanol]] (70–90%), eau de cologne contains a mixture of [[citrus]] oils including oils of [[lemon]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[tangerine]], [[clementine]], [[Bergamot orange|bergamot]], [[Lime (fruit)|lime]], [[grapefruit]], [[blood orange]], and [[bitter orange]]. It can also contain oils of [[neroli]], [[lavender]], [[rosemary]], [[thyme]], [[oregano]], [[petitgrain]] (orange leaf), [[jasmine]], [[olive]], [[oleaster]], and [[tobacco]].

In contemporary American English usage, the term "cologne" has become a generic term for [[perfume]]s usually marketed towards men. It also may signify a less concentrated (but more affordable) version of a popular perfume. 

==History==
[[File:1811-Rosoli-Flacon.jpg|thumb|An eau de cologne by Farina (1811).]]
[[File:Eau de Cologne 1280470.JPG|thumb|4711 cologne - the most famous Eau de Cologne.]]
The original ''Eau de Cologne'' is a spirit-citrus perfume launched in [[Cologne]] in 1709 by [[Giovanni Maria Farina]] (1685–1766), an [[Italy|Italian]] perfume maker from [[Santa Maria Maggiore, Piedmont |Santa Maria Maggiore]] [[Valle Vigezzo]]. In 1708, Farina wrote to his brother Jean Baptiste: "I have found a fragrance that reminds me of an Italian spring morning, of mountain daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain".&lt;ref&gt;Eckstein and Sykes, p 8&lt;/ref&gt; He named his fragrance ''Eau de Cologne'', in honour of his new hometown.&lt;ref name="Fischer"&gt;Fischer&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Original Eau de Cologne [[4711]]'', is named after its location at Glockengasse No. 4711. It was also developed in the 18th century by [[Wilhelm Mülhens]] and produced in Cologne since at least 1799 and is therefore probably one of the oldest still produced fragrances in the world. On 12 December 2006, the perfumes and cosmetics company [[Mäurer &amp; Wirtz]] took over 4711 from [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] and has expanded it to a whole brand since then.

The ''Eau de Cologne'' composed by Farina was used only as a perfume and delivered to "nearly all royal houses in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Farina [[Fragrance Museum]] information leaflet&lt;/ref&gt; His ability to produce a constantly homogeneous fragrance consisting of dozens of monoessences was seen as a sensation at the time. A single vial of this ''aqua mirabilis'' ([[Latin]] for miracle water) cost half the annual salary of a civil servant.&lt;ref name="Fischer"/&gt; When free trade was established in Cologne by the French in 1797, the success of ''Eau de Cologne'' prompted countless other businessmen to sell their own fragrances under the name of ''Eau de Cologne''. Giovanni Maria Farina's formula has been produced in [[Cologne]] since 1709 by [[Johann Maria Farina gegenüber dem Jülichs-Platz|Farina opposite the Jülichplatz]]&lt;ref name="Fischer"/&gt; and to this day remains a secret. His shop at Obenmarspforten opened in 1709 and is today the world's oldest fragrance factory.

In 1806, Jean Marie Joseph Farina, a grand-grand-nephew of [[Giovanni Maria Farina]] (1685–1766), opened a perfumery business in [[Paris]] that was later sold to [[Roger &amp; Gallet]]. That company now owns the rights to ''Eau de Cologne extra vieille'' in contrast to the ''Original Eau de Cologne'' from [[Cologne]]. Originally the water of Cologne was believed to have the power to ward off bubonic plague.&lt;ref&gt;Monk, Paul M. S. ''Physical Chemistry: Understanding Our Chemical World''. 2004. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; By drinking the cologne the citrus oil scent would be exuded through the pores, repelling fleas. Much as flea shampoo for dogs can be based on citrus oils today.

In modern times, ''Eau de Cologne'' or "cologne", has become a generic term. The term "cologne" can be applied to perfume for men or women, but it conventionally refers to perfumes marketed towards men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.germanywanderer.com/the-history-behind-eau-de-cologne/|title=The history behind eau de cologne|publisher=Germany Wanderer|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drinking==
In former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] countries (mainly Russia), varieties of Troynoy ''Eau de Cologne'' may be used as a [[surrogate alcohol]] among poor [[alcohol intoxication|alcoholics]], especially because it is very cheaply priced compared to [[vodka]].&lt;ref name=drinking&gt;{{cite news|title='Aftershave drink' kills Russians |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6752515.stm |newspaper=[[BBC News Online|BBC News]]|date=2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''folk hero''' or '''national hero''' is a type of [[hero]] – real, fictional or [[mythology|mythological]] – with the sole salient characteristic being the imprinting of his or her name, personality and deeds in the popular consciousness of a [[people]]. This presence in the popular consciousness is evidenced by its historical frequency in [[Folk music|folk songs]], folk tales and other [[folklore]]; and its modern [[trope (literature)|trope]] status in literature, art and films.

[[File:Joan of Arc on horseback.png|thumb|[[Joan of Arc]] depicted on horseback in an illustration from a 1505 manuscript. The martyr and saint Joan of Arc is a national hero in France]]
[[File:Giuseppe Garibaldi (1866).jpg|thumb|[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], one of [[Italy]]'s "fathers of the fatherland"]]
[[File:Portrait of Davy Crockett.jpg|thumb|[[Davy Crockett]], hero of the [[Battle of the Alamo|Alamo]]]]
[[File:Grotepier TN.JPG|thumb|Statue of [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]], a Frisian folk hero]]

Although some folk heroes are historical public figures, many are not. The lives of folk heroes are generally fictional, their characteristics and deeds often exaggerated to mythic proportions.

The folk hero often begins life as a normal person, but is transformed into someone extraordinary by significant life events, often in response to social injustice, and sometimes in response to natural disasters.

One major category of folk hero is the defender of the common people against the oppression or corruption of the established power structure.  Members of this category of folk hero often, but not necessarily, live [[outlaw|outside the law]] in some way.

'''Frost French''' was a British fashion label established in 1999 and run by the British movie actress [[Sadie Frost]] and Jemima French.&lt;ref name="VogueBio"&gt;{{cite web|last=Craven|first=Jo|title=FrostFrench|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/biographies/080420-frostfrench-biography.aspx|work=Vogue|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Frost French was created by Sadie Frost and Jemima French, who have been friends since they were fifteen. The fashion label began in London as a design based studio in 1999.&lt;ref name="VogueBio"/&gt; At first the company sold only [[knickers]] and lingerie, though later expanded to a full women's wear collection.&lt;ref name="VogueBio"/&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;
The company had an Autumn/Winter debut show, which featured [[Kate Moss]]'s strip tease, on February 17, 2001, at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]] in the [[West End of London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexander |first=Hilary |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1385179/Moss-kicks-off-her-clothes-for-Fashion-Week.html |title=Moss kicks off her clothes for Fashion Week |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=18 February 2002 |accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the London fashion week in 2003, they named their show the "Frost French Tea Party" at [[Regent's Park]] [[Regent's Park Open Air Theatre|Open Air Theatre]]. After the exhibition ended, they hosted an afternoon [[tea party]] in collaborated with the Tea Council of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Simon |last=Mills |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/jul/05/food.britishidentity |title=Simon Mills on the delights of afternoon tea |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=5 July 2006 |accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, they won the [[Elle Style Awards#2004|Elle Style Award]] for "Best British Designer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fashionunited.co.uk/leads/frostfrench-new-formation |title=FrostFrench new formation |publisher=[[FashionUnited]] |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Frost and French appeared as guest judges on [[Project Catwalk]]'s season 1, episode 2.&lt;ref name=catwalk&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Catwalk – Season 1|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/project-catwalk/season-1/|publisher=CBS Interactive Inc.|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, Frost French opened a boutique store in [[Islington, London|Islington]], London.&lt;ref name="First Store"&gt;{{cite web|last=elleuk|first=elleuk|title=Frost French Opens First Store|url=http://www.elleuk.com/fashion/news/node_325144#image=1|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fashion label fell into administration due to £4.2&amp;nbsp;million worth of debt in 2008 until John Jaokim, a Norwegian film producer and a property investor, bailed out Frost French by investing in the company. John Jaokim joined the board of directors after helping the fashion label financially.&lt;ref name=dailymail&gt;{{cite web|last=Davies|first=Barabara|title=Sadie's frosty outlook: A struggling fashion business, debts piled high and an acting career that never quite got off the ground|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1347370/Sadie-Frost-fashion-business-debts-acting-career-took-off.html|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=emap&gt;{{cite web|last=Santi|first=Ana|title=Rescue deal saves FrostFrench|url=http://www.drapersonline.com/news/rescue-deal-saves-frostfrench/1744369.article|publisher=EMAP Publisher Ltd.|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, they sought help from sales agents to reposition their brand and improve product distribution.&lt;ref name="VogueBio"/&gt; In the same year, they decided to open their second boutique at [[Soho]] in London. The fashion label designed their second store to reflect the playful aesthetic side of Frost French.&lt;ref name=soho&gt;{{cite web|last=Bumpus|first=Jessica|title=Town Bound|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2009/11/05/frostfrench-soho-boutique|work=Vogue|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Frost French recovered in 2008, the company continued to face troubles in 2010 as they suffered a £500,000 loss. Also, John Jaokim and [[Dominic McVey]] had resigned, as directors, leaving only Frost and French. Their Spring/Summer 2011 collection was discontinued. Frost and French blamed the management team and the label's strategic direction when the company officially went out of business in 2011.&lt;ref name=dailymail/&gt; As a result, all of Frost French's stores in Islington and Soho had closed down.&lt;ref name=relaunch&gt;{{cite web|last=Milligan|first=Lauren|title=Sadie And Jemima on the FrostFrench Relaunch|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2014/02/10/frostfrench-relaunch-collection-sadie-frost-jemima-french|work=Vogue|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Relaunch2&gt;{{cite web|last=Sowray|first=Bibby|title=Sadie Frost and Jemima French to relaunch FrostFrench|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG10628747/Sadie-Frost-and-Jemima-French-to-relaunch-FrostFrench.html|accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the company disappeared, Frost and French continued to design lingerie, swimwear, and nightwear for the company's sister brands Floozie and Iris &amp; Edie.  Early in 2014, the owners gave an official statement of Frost French's plans to relaunch the company. The fashion label said that the relaunch would happen around September 2014 with the first design meeting being held in February 2014.&lt;ref name=relaunch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Relaunch2/&gt; As of 2016, the label has not relaunched, but continues to live on under the ''Floozie by Frost and French'' brand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.debenhams.com/women/swimwear-beachwear/floozie-by-frost-french&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
Frost French described their products as: "classical with a twist of pop." According to the designers, their clothing appeals to the likes of a youthful London girl.&lt;ref name="VogueBio"/&gt; They originally produced knickers for women, but they expanded their product line to a full women's wear collection, which includes coats, dresses, lingerie, shirts, and accessories.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web|last=Moore|first=Booth|title=In London, spurning runways for the real deal|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/21/entertainment/et-booth21|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have collaborated with [[Peugeot]], [[Good Hair Day|GHD]], [[17 Cosmetics]], and [[Olay]] in a variety of projects.&lt;ref name=boots17&gt;{{cite web|title=Boots 17 ties up with design duo frostfrench|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/article/524189/boots-17-ties-design-duo-frostfrench|publisher=Haymarket|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also had a contract with [[Liptons]] and they sold lipstick-stained teacups, which was an activity for their 'drink gorgeous' campaign.&lt;ref name=cups&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexander|first=Ella|title=The FrostFrench Show|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2010/08/11/frostfrench-launch-glassware|work=Vogue|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Keynote speaker Geri Jewell (6235421221).jpg|thumb|right|Keynote speaker Geri Jewell takes questions from the audience.]]
Her autobiography ''I'm Walking as Straight as I Can'' was published in 2011 by [[ECW Press]]. The title refers to the facts that she has [[cerebral palsy]] and is a lesbian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.broadwayworld.com/article/ActressComedienne_Geri_Jewell_Releases_Memoir_Im_Walking_As_Straight_As_I_Can_20110119 Actress/Comedienne Geri Jewell Releases Memoir 'I'm Walking As Straight As I Can']&lt;/ref&gt;

Jewell's original autobiography, ''Geri'', published in 1984, talked about her personal and professional life.

{{cquote|It did help children get comfortable dealing with a person who has a disability, and taught them the value of a good sense of humor, so I’m not going to knock the whole book. But it was such lighthearted fluff given that I was struggling so much at the time. Like I said, I had a manager who was a crook. People in my life were manipulating me and taking advantage of me. Then ''The Facts of Life'' did not renew my contract. Years later, they offered me one episode during the fifth season, and my new manager, Richard Lippin, who was trying to fix all the previous manager’s mistakes, turned it down. He felt that after everything that I’d done for ''Facts'', it was a slap in the face that they would only offer me one show. If I had had it my way, I would have accepted it anyway. But I don’t blame him, because he was right. The problem was that he thought I was indispensable, and they didn’t. He figured that they would come back with something better. And—oops!—they never did. He told me not to worry about it, that I was going to find other work because I was very talented, and I was the first person with a disability to break ground in a series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Geri-Jewell.html |title=Interview with Geri Jewell |publisher=ABILITY Magazine |date=April–May 2012|accessdate=2012-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''''Helen of Troy''''' is an 1898 painting by [[Evelyn De Morgan]] depicting [[Helen of Troy]]; it was commissioned by [[William Imrie]] of Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Cherry, ''Painting Women: Victorian Women Artists'' (1993) p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compositionally, the painting is similar to De Morgan's ''Flora'' and ''Cassandra'':&lt;ref&gt;Smith 2002, pp. 92-94.&lt;/ref&gt; Helena is standing upright and tall, in a peaceful posture that reminds to Boticcelli's representations of Greek and Roman goddesses (such as [[Pallas and the Centaur|Athena]] or [[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|Venus]]) that are, at the same time, an evocation of classical art, a usual characteristic between Renaissance artists. Helena has been removed from the common artistic elements of the [[Trojan War]]: despite dealing with a typically bellic topic, De Morgan decides to paint, instead of weapons and battles, the wonderful pink clothes and the fascinated look that Helena puts on the mirror that is reflecting her beautiful face, elements that can be read as symbols of her inconscient vanity, which eventually brought a long and terrible war and destruction to the city of [[Troy]], which we can see in the last term of the composition, on top of a hill. The presence of the moon-sun in the sky is also related to her feminine and voluble nature.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The '''Hoosier Salon''' is an annual juried art exhibition that features the work of [[Indiana]] artists and provides them with an outlet to market their work. The Hoosier Salon Patron's Association, the nonprofit arts organization that organizes the event, also operates year-round galleries in [[Carmel, Indiana]] and [[New Harmony, Indiana]]. These spaces host exhibitions of Salon artists throughout the year, as well as workshops and demonstrations. An artist must have lived in [[Indiana]] and must be a member of the Hoosier Salon arts organization to become eligible for the Salon's exhibitions. The Hoosier Salon has exhibited art from many of Indiana's most notable painters, sculptors, cartoonists, and mixed-media artists, including [[Hoosier Group]] artists, several members of the [[Brown County Art Colony]], and other artists with ties to Indiana.

The Daughters of Indiana, a group of women who were born in Indiana but resided in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]], hosted the first annual Hoosier Salon in 1925 at the [[Marshall Field and Company]]'s galleries in [[Chicago]]. In 1942 the annual exhibition was relocated to [[Indianapolis]], Indiana, where it has been held at several venues, including the [[William H. Block Co.|William H. Block Company]] and the [[L. S. Ayres|L. S. Ayres and Company]] department stores, the [[Indiana State Museum]], and the [[Indiana Historical Society]]. The Hoosier Salon has survived wars, economic recessions, a fire, venue changes for its annual exhibition, relocation of its offices and gallery spaces, and modifications to its outreach programs. In 2014 the Hoosier Salon celebrated its ninetieth continuous year of annual exhibitions.

==Mission==
The Hoosier Salon is a statewide nonprofit arts organization whose mission is to "create an appreciation of art by promoting Hoosier artists and their art."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoosiersalon.org/index.html Welcome to the Hoosier Salon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420192655/http://www.hoosiersalon.org/index.html |date=April 20, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=88cat&gt;{{cite book | title =Hoosier Salon 88th Annual Exhibition: Where Art and History Converge | publisher =Hoosier Salon Art Patrons Association | series = | volume = | edition = | year =2012 | location =Indianapolis, IN | pages = | url = | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Salon's exhibitions also provide viewers an opportunity to see and appreciate the talents of artists with ties to Indiana.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt; The organization's vision is to foster an appreciation for visual art through activities that "educate, inspire, and enhance the lives of the citizens of our state while promoting the creativity, talent and technique of Indiana artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Hoosier Salon: About | work = | publisher =Hoosier Salon | date = | url = http://hoosiersalon.org/about-2/ | format = | accessdate =2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoosiersalon.org/aboutus.html Hoosier Salon: Our Legacy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927063413/http://www.hoosiersalon.org/aboutus.html |date=September 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins in Chicago===
The idea for the Hoosier Salon originated in May 1924, when the 160-member Daughters of Indiana, a group of women who were born in Indiana but resided in the Chicago metro area, held a gathering devoted to [[Hoosier]] painters.&lt;ref name=GT1&gt;{{cite book |author1=Judith Vale Newton |author2=Carol Weiss | title =A Grand Tradition: The Arts and Artists of the Hoosier Salon, 1925–1990  | publisher =Hoosier Salon Patrons Association | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1993 | location =Indianapolis, IN | page =1 | url = | isbn =0-9638360-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this initial meeting, Estella King, chair of the group's arts committee, led the organization's plans for an exhibition featuring high quality artwork from Hoosier artists that would help gain more recognition for them outside of Indiana. The group's goals were to inspire Indiana artists to develop their talents, to showcase artists who depicted Indiana themes in their work, and to provide an opportunity to market their art.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank15&gt;{{cite journal | author=Marilyn Shank| title =Art for Indiana's Sake: A History of the Hoosier Salon | journal =Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =24 | issue =3 | page =15 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | date =Summer 2012 | language = | url =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hoosier Salon's name and concept come from the nineteenth-century French tradition of annual art exhibitions held in the [[Grand Palais|Grand Palais des Champs- Élysées]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton23&gt;{{cite journal | author=Judith V. Newton | title =This Eternal Beauty: Celebrating the Art of the Hoosier Salon | journal =Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History | volume =6 | issue =4| pages =23 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis | date =Fall 1994 | language = | url =| accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago, [[Illinois]], was selected as the site for the first Hoosier Salon because of its large population and its reputation as a [[Midwestern United States|midwestern]] art center.&lt;ref name=GT1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank15/&gt; The annual Salon ran in Chicago from 1925 through 1941, when it moved to [[Indianapolis|Indianapolis, Indiana]]. Since January 1942 the annual exhibition has taken place at various sites around Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=Newton24&gt;Newton, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early exhibitions===
The first Hoosier Salon ran from March 9 to 19, 1925, at the art galleries of [[Marshall Field's|Marshall Field and Company]] at 28 East Washington Street in Chicago.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shank, p. 15 and 17.&lt;/ref&gt; The Daughters of Indiana, who organized and sponsored the first Salon, were assisted by several other groups, such as the Indiana Society of Chicago and volunteers from Chicago's [[Earlham College]] Alumni Association.&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt;

The first Hoosier Salon was open to painters who had lived in Indiana for at least a year. Entries for the juried exhibition were submitted from across the United States. The selections featured 253 works of art from 132 artists.&lt;ref name=Shank15/&gt;&lt;ref name=IHS-INP&gt;{{cite journal | title =Hoosier Salon: Celebrating a 90-Year History of Honoring Indiana Artists | journal =INPerspective | volume =20 | issue =3 | page =6 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society | location =Indianapolis, IN | date =May 2014 | language = | url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoosier Group artist T. C. Steele and his wife, Selma, attended the opening of the Salon's first exhibition, which was well received by art critics and the public.&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt;&lt;ref name=GT2-3&gt;Newton and Weiss, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the first exhibition's favorites was a set of three "[[Little Orphan Annie]]" cartoons from their creator, [[Harold Gray]], a 1917 graduate of [[Purdue University]].&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt;&lt;ref name=GT2-3/&gt; Hoosier artists whose work also appeared at the first Salon included all four Hoosier Group members who were still living ([[T.C. Steele]], [[William Forsyth (artist)|William Forsyth]], [[Otto Stark]], and [[J. Ottis Adams]]). Other exhibitors with Indiana ties included [[Wayman Elbridge Adams]], [[Frank V. Dudley]], Frederick M. Polley, [[Will Vawter|J. Will Vawter]], [[Eugene Savage]], and Clifton Wheeler, among others. Traditional Indiana landscapes and still-life paintings were represented, as well as works from Hoosier artists who lived outside the state.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank17-18&gt;Shank, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the first Hoosier Salon merit prizes were awarded to Steele for ''Winter Morning, First Snow'', judged best picture  and painted by a man more than sixty years of age. Wayman Adams won a $200 merit award for his oil portrait of Indiana author [[Booth Tarkington]], and Forsyth's ''Glory of Autumn'' still life won a $100 merit prize. Savage, who was originally from [[Covington, Indiana]], won the top prize of $500 for ''Recessional''. Thirty percent of the accepted entries came from women artists, including two works submitted by [[Marie Goth]]. Several women were recognized with merit prizes for their art: Dorothy Morlan for ''Frosty Morning, Southern Indiana''; Lucy M. Taggert for ''Eleanor''; Laura A. Fry for ''A Shaft of Sunlight''; Lucie Hartrath for ''The Valley, Morning''; and [[Maude Kaufman Eggemeyer]] for ''A Garden''.&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louise Zaring]] received a prize for Best Marine Scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us8.campaign-archive1.com/?u=b75ab2bab49cc41eda0989f2e&amp;id=3c2f9b5474|title=Indiana and Florida artist Louise Eleanor Zaring|publisher=|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marguerite B. Williams, art critic for the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'', remarked at the time of the first Salon that Indiana was well known for its writers; however, "it would seem that some of this desire for self-expression has overflowed into painting for there is probably no other state that could show as many and such a high average of practically unknown painters."&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt; Hoosier authors Tarkington, [[George Ade]], and [[Meredith Nicholson]] supported the idea of an annual exhibition featuring Indiana artists. In the forward to the Hoosier Salon's exhibition catalog in 1926, Nicholson wrote, "we are anxious for our brothers and sisters who paint or draw or sculpt to have their day in court, just as we have had it."&lt;ref name=GT2-3/&gt;

Following the critical and popular success of the first exhibition, the Daughters of Indiana wanted to make it an annual event that was open to artists with ties to Indiana. In 1926 the second Hoosier Salon ran for fourteen days at Marshall Field's galleries in Chicago. It featured 339 works by 149 artists and drew more than 50,000 visitors.&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt; For the first time the show was opened to sculpture in addition to paintings. [[Janet Scudder]], a native of [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], who gained an international reputation for her work as a sculptor, earned the $300 merit prize for her outstanding sculpture called ''Victory''. Wayman Adams won the $500 merit prize for the exhibition's outstanding picture, ''The Art Jury'', a life-size portrait of the four surviving members of the Hoosier Group&amp;ndash;Steele, Stark, J. Ottis Adams, and Forsyth.&lt;ref name="GT2-3"/&gt; (Steele and Stark died by the end of 1926; J. Ottis Adams died in 1927.)&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt; [[William Edouard Scott]], a former student of Stark, was one of the first African American artists to participate in the Hoosier Salon. Scott exhibited ''Lights on a Summer Night'' at the second Hoosier Salon.&lt;ref name=GT2-3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt;

===Other events===
In 1926, after the Daughters of Chicago hosted the second exhibition, the group partnered with other art patrons to formally organize the Hoosier Salon Patrons Association, a nonprofit organization that would continue the event and its original mission of recognizing talented Indiana artists. John C. Shaffer, editor and publisher of the ''[[Chicago Evening Post]]'', the ''[[The Indianapolis Star|Indianapolis Star]]'', and newspapers in [[Muncie, Indiana]], and Terre Haute, Indiana, became the Association's first president. Estella King, a native of [[Peru, Indiana]], and chair of the Daughters of Indiana art committee for the first two Hoosier Salons, became the group's executive chairman.&lt;ref name=Newton23/&gt; In addition to the Hoosier Salon Patrons Association, ongoing sponsors and supporters of the annual Hoosier Salon have included Kappa Kappa Kappa, first connected to the Salon in 1927; Delta Sigma Kappa sorority, a supporter since 1937; and [[Psi Iota Xi]], a sponsor since 1941.&lt;ref name=Shank22&gt;Shank, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GT5-22-85&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 5, 22, and 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to hosting the annual Salon during its seventeen-year run in Illinois, the patron’s association opened a year-round gallery on October 15, 1928, in donated space in the ''Chicago Evening Post'' Building on West Wacker Drive.&lt;ref name=Shank17-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=GT5-22-85/&gt; Art that had appeared in at least one of the Salons could be exhibited and sold at the Chicago gallery. The Association also hosted traveling exhibitions, a tradition that continued over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Shank, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a brief time the group's Hoosier Program Bureau, which was formed in 1929, helped Hoosier musicians secure public appearances. The offering was discontinued in 1941, when the Salon moved its headquarters to Indianapolis and the group decided to focus on visual arts.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26&gt;Newton, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

During its early years, not all of the Salon's exhibitions were held in Chicago. In June 1936 the Hoosier Salon held its annual exhibition during the summer months at the [[Lake Wawasee history#Spink Wawasee Hotel|Spink-Wawasee Hotel]] at [[Lake Wawasee]] in Indiana.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank20&gt;Shank, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 the Art Department of the Woman's Department Club of Indianapolis sponsored a traveling Hoosier Salon exhibition at the William H. Block Company's department store in downtown Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt; Following the success of this event in Indianapolis and continued support from the department store, the Woman's Department Club was instrumental in helping to move the Salon's headquarters and its annual exhibition to Indianapolis in 1942.&lt;ref name=Shank22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Around this same time several of the early leaders in Chicago began to retire, moved away, or experienced failing health, so it was not unexpected that on June 30, 1941, the Salon's trustees formally voted to approve the move of its headquarters to Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indiana years===
In late 1941 the Hoosier Salon Patrons Association moved into two donated rooms in the State Life Building (also known as the Thomas Building) on Washington Street in Indianapolis. These rooms also served as the Association's art gallery until 1973, when fire destroyed the building.&lt;ref&gt;Shank, p. 20 and 22.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Salon's relocation to Indiana, several new sponsors began their longtime support of the Hoosier Salon. Representatives from the Woman's Department Club and its Art Department, Kappa Kappa Kappa, Psi Iota Xi, and women from the Indiana Federation of Clubs and the Indiana Federation of Art Clubs formed the Hoosier Salon Executive Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the move from Chicago, the Association's next annual Hoosier Salon opened in downtown Indianapolis on January 19, 1942, for a two-week run in the sixth-floor auditorium of the William H. Block Company department store at Market and Illinois Streets.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank20/&gt; The event took place shortly after the bombing at [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], and the war effort "dominated the show."&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt; Lillian Alt's ''Men and Guns'' and William A. Eyden Jr.'s ''Steel for Defense'' were among the 261 pieces on display.&lt;ref name=Shank20/&gt; The annual Salon was scaled back during World War II, and the wartime themes that continued for several years frequently outnumbered the usual landscapes, still lifes, and portraits.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt;

In 1949 the Hoosier Salon marked its twenty-fifth year, a significant achievement that also achieved national recognition. After the Salon's run in Indianapolis, a special exhibition featuring all 168 pieces from the Indiana show were exhibited at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Smithsonian American Art Museum|National Museum of American Art]] in April 1949.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; The Indiana State Society of [[Washington, D.C.]], sponsored two fund-raising events for the Salon's exhibition in Washington, D.C.&amp;mdash;a style show at the [[Mayflower Hotel]] and a dance at the [[Omni Shoreham Hotel|Shoreham Hotel]], where Hoosier songwriter [[Hoagy Carmichael]] and his wife, Ruth, were special guests.&lt;ref&gt;Shank, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s several artists who had contributed to the first exhibitions in Chicago continued to submit works for the Salons, including Polley, Wheeler, and Wayman Adams, among others. Salons in the 1960s marked the changing times for Hoosier artists with the introduction of new materials, such as prints, metal sculpture, collage, and fewer of the more traditional landscapes of southern Indiana.&lt;ref name=Shank22-23&gt;Shank, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a few weeks before the Hoosier Salon's fiftieth anniversary exhibition of 1974, disaster struck. On November 5, 1973, a fire destroyed the Thomas Building, including the Salon's historical materials and 311 paintings. The Association established temporary offices at the back of the William A. Block department store’s auditorium and resumed plans for the annual exhibition. A [[Lilly Endowment]] grant of $5,000 and additional $1,000 contributions from several sponsors allowed the Hoosier Salon to open in January 1974, although the other planned events were cancelled. The Salon's fiftieth anniversary exhibition included 163 pieces from 117 different artists. Goth and William A. Eyden Jr. were honored at the annual event. Both of these artists had contributed art for the original exhibition in 1925.&lt;ref name=Shank22-23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goth had work accepted for every Salon since 1925; her last Salon entries were in 1975. See Newton and Weiss, pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Hoosier Salon exhibition remained at Block's department store in Indianapolis from 1942 to 1977. The event moved to the L. S. Ayres department store in downtown Indianapolis at Meridian and Washington Streets in 1978, and remained there until 1989. From 1990 to 2011 the annual exhibition was held at the Indiana State Museum. In 2012 the exhibition moved to the Indiana Historical Society's Eugene and Marilyn Glick Indiana History Center in Indianapolis.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank22-23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 71 and 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The annual juried art exhibition continues to showcase the works of Hoosier artists from all walks of life. In 2014 the Hoosier Salon celebrated its ninetieth consecutive annual exhibition.&lt;ref name=IHS-INP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton27&gt;Newton, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1974 the Hoosier Salon purchased the [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] Bals-Wocher mansion on Indianapolis's North Delaware Street as the new location for its year-round gallery. Because the nonprofit did not have the funds to operate two galleries, it closed its gallery in the former Indianapolis [[Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts|Hilton Hotel]] lobby at Meridian and Ohio Streets in December 1974.&lt;ref name=Shank22-23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 60 and 67.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978 the Bals-Wocher mansion proved too costly for the group to maintain, so the Salon sold it and moved its gallery to the Morrison Opera building on Indianapolis's South Meridian Street, where it had been renting office space.&lt;ref&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1991 the Association relocated its offices to North College Avenue in Indianapolis's [[Broad Ripple Village, Indianapolis|Broad Ripple Village]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =75th Hoosier Salon Diamond Jubilee Gala Celebration (Invitation)  | publisher =Hoosier Salon | series = | volume = | edition = | year =1999 | location =Indianapolis, IN | pages = | url = | isbn =}}, in the collections of the William H. Smith Memorial Library, Indiana Historical Society, Indianapolis.&lt;/ref&gt; where it had previously established a year-round gallery.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt; The Hoosier Salon operated two other galleries in addition to the one in Broad Ripple. One gallery was at [[New Harmony, Indiana]]; the other at [[Wabash, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shank24-25&gt;Shank, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014 the Hoosier Salon maintained gallery space at New Harmony, but the Wabash gallery closed and the property owner converted it to another purpose.&lt;ref name=Eason&gt;{{cite news |author=Brian Eason | title =Hoosier Salon moving main gallery to Carmel | newspaper =Indianapolis Star | location =Indianapolis, IN | pages = | language = | publisher = | date =2014-04-16 | url = http://www.indystar.com/story/news/local/hamilton-county/2014/04/16/hoosier-salon-moving-main-gallery-carmel/7782609/ | accessdate =2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the annual Hoosier Salon remains the organization's biggest event, it also provides other outreach efforts.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt; In 2006 the Hoosier Salon initiated the French tradition of a [[Salon Des Refusés]] (exhibition of rejects) at its Broad Ripple gallery.&lt;ref name=Shank22-23/&gt; The Salon also provides educational outreach to schools and collaborates with other organizations to promote the arts.&lt;ref name=88cat/&gt;

In May 2014 the Hoosier Salon closed its main gallery in Broad Ripple and moved to a new gallery space in the Carmel Arts and Design District in Carmel, Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Hoosier Salon art gallery opens in Carmel | work = | publisher =Indianapolis Star  | date =2014-05-10 | url = http://www.indystar.com/picture-gallery/entertainment/arts/2014/05/10/hoosier-salon-art-gallery-opens-in-carmel/8955009/| format = | accessdate =2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoosier Salon artists==
Since 1925, many of Indiana's most notable artists have exhibited at the Hoosier Salon. In order to qualify as a Salon exhibitor, an artist must be a Hoosier Salon member and must have lived in Indiana for a minimum of one year at any point during their life. Salon entries are independently reviewed by experienced judges in the art field and selected for the annual exhibition. The works of well-established master artists are displayed alongside the work of newcomers to the field.&lt;ref name=Shank24-25/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lieber"&gt;{{Cite news   | last = Lieber  | first = Tammy  | title = Hoosier Salon paints its role in broad strokes  | newspaper = Indianapolis Business Journal  | location = Indianapolis, Indiana  | pages =| language =   | publisher =  | date = September 12, 2005  | url = http://www.allbusiness.com/company-activities-management/company-structures-ownership/10575806-1.html  | accessdate = November 3, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The annual Hoosier Salon claims ties to the Hoosier Group and several members of the Brown County Art Colony.&lt;ref name=Shank15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt; However, not all of the Salon's art has Indiana as it subject. Work from Salon artists with Hoosier ties is inspired from locales outside Indiana as well. New York City-based Wayman Adams, born near [[Muncie, Indiana]], exhibited his artwork at the Salon for thirty-five years.&lt;ref name=Newton25-26/&gt; Several southwestern artists  were linked to Indiana as well. [[Shelbyville, Indiana]], native [[William Victor Higgins]], who was a member of [[New Mexico]]'s "Taos Ten", and [[Gustave Baumann]], who worked in [[Brown County, Indiana]], for seven years before moving to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], in 1918, were Salon exhibitors. [[Fairmount, Indiana]], native [[Olive Rush]], whose art studio was in Santa Fe, was a Salon prizewinner.&lt;ref name=Newton24/&gt;

In the past, Hoosier cartoonists have been well represented at the Salons. In addition to comic-strip illustrator Harold Gray's "Little Orphan Annie", cartoonists who competed for the Salon's prizes and recognition were [[Kin Hubbard|Frank McKinney "Kin" Hubbard]]'s nationally syndicated "Abe Martin" cartoons; [[Gaar Williams]], who created "Among the Folks in History"; [[Fontaine Fox]], creator of the syndicated cartoon"[[Toonerville Folks|Toonerville Trolley]]"; and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winner [[John T. McCutcheon]], who drew editorial cartoons. Gray, Hubbard, Williams, and McCutcheon also provided artwork to help advertise the Salon.&lt;ref name=Shank15/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newton24/&gt;

In more recent years Salon entries have changed to reflect the new artistic styles of Hoosier artists. Past Salon works have included Kanwal Prakash (K. P.) Singh's architectural renderings, lithographs from Garo Z. Antreasian, watercolors from Floyd Hopper, portraits by [[Nancy Noel]], the acrylics of James Lee Cunningham, and abstract art from Martha Slaymaker.&lt;ref name=Newton27/&gt;&lt;ref name=GT298&gt;Newton and Weiss, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''How the Toys Saved Christmas''''' (Original [[Italian language|Italian]] title ''La freccia azzurra'', {{lang-en|The Blue Arrow}}) is a 1996 Italian animated film directed by [[Enzo D'Alò]].

==Plot==
When [[Santa]]'s helper La [[Befana]] falls ill and must take off a Christmas Eve, she recruits Scarafoni to help deliver all the toys. No one but the toys knows is that Scarafoni plans to auction off the toys to the highest bidder, which means the toys won't make it to the children who have been good all year and deserve them. The toys decide to deliver themselves starting with a [[Wind-up toy|wind-up]] [[teddy bear]] going to the little boy's bed, and the story follows them as they struggle to avoid the heartless Scarafoni and to find their true homes. Meanwhile, a young boy named Francesco tries to find his true Christmas present - one special friend. In the end, the toys deliver themselves, but Scarafoni still has the money. However, everyone rushes to the toy shop and find Scarafoni with the money and manage to get it back from him, as Scarafoni is sent to prison. Francesco gets his true friend - a new puppy whose name is Jingles (voiced by [[Sonja Ball]]).

==U.S. version==
In 1997, the film was imported to the U.S. and released [[direct-to-video]] by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Buena Vista Home Video]], under the title "How the Toys Saved Christmas" (although, as shown in the previews, originally going to be titled "The Toys Who Saved Christmas"). The film featured [[Mary Tyler Moore]] as the voice for the Befana, who was named "Granny Rose", [[Tony Randall]] as Scarafoni (whose name suggest "scarafaggio" that means beetle), who was named "Mr. Grimm", and Michael Caloz as Francesco, who was named "Christopher Winter". The film also had some scenes from the original Italian release deleted or placed before other scenes, along with some music scores taken out and new music added in.

In the original version, the story took place during the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] Eve, because in Italian folklore the Befana is a good witch that gives presents and candies to the children during the night between 5 and 6 January.

{{Wiktionary}}

'''Identification''' is a term used in [[Literary criticism|literary]] and [[Film theory|film]] studies to describe a psychological relationship between the reader of a novel and a character in the book, or between a spectator in the audience and a character on screen. In both cases, readers and spectators see themselves in the fictional character.

Identification is usually supposed to be largely unconscious: a reader may be aware that she likes a given character, but not that she actually sees that character as an alter ego, a version of her, or a projection of her aspirations for herself.  It would be a mistake to think all heroes foster identification, or that all villains inhibit identification—many, perhaps even most, characters elicit some degree of identification on the part of the reader or spectator. In film, [[Alfred Hitchcock]] exploited the traits of casual identification with specific moments, even when the character was villainous. In ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960), Hitchcock explained that as the character Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) was disposing of the car containing Marion Crane's body in a swamp, for a brief moment he had the car stop sinking. "When Perkins is looking at the car sinking in the pond... the public are thinking, 'I hope it goes all the way down!' It's a natural instinct."&lt;ref&gt;Truffaut, Francois (1978) ''Hitchcock'' (Revised Edition) Paladin, p.342&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jazzmobile, Inc.''' is based in [[New York City]], and was founded in 1964 by Daphne Arnstein, an arts patron and founder of the Harlem Cultural Council and [[Billy Taylor|Dr. William "Billy" Taylor]]. It is a multifaceted, outreach organization committed to bringing "America's Classical Music"—[[Jazz]]—to the largest possible audience by producing concerts, festivals and special events worldwide. The Jazzmobile educational efforts are now being enhanced by the creation of a not-for-profit music publishing company and not-for-profit recording company.

'''Morris Kestelman''' (5 October 1905 – 15 June 1998) was a British artist and teacher. Kestelman was a full-time art teacher and only began exhibiting on a regular basis towards the end of his life and is now best known for the paintings of working people and landscapes he produced during the 1940s and 1950s as well as his later abstract work.&lt;ref name=IndieMK&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-morris-kestelman-1165678.html|title=Obituary: Morris Kestelman|author=Agi Katz|date=17 June 1998|accessdate= 29 June 2016|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BritMK&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=119100|title=Morris Kestelman (Biographical details)|author=|date=|accessdate= 29 June 2016|work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Kestelmans' parents were Jewish immigrants from Russia and he was born and raised in the midst of the Jewish community in [[Whitechapel]] in the East End of London, where his father worked as a cabinet maker.&lt;ref name="PalMac"&gt;{{cite book|author=W.Rubinstein &amp; Michael A. Jolles (Editors)|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|year=2011|title=The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History|ISBN=978-0-230-30466-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kestelman obtained a scholarship to the [[Central School of Art and Design]] in 1922, where his teachers included both [[Archibald Standish Hartrick|A.S. Hartrick]] and [[Bernard Meninsky]].&lt;ref name="GMWaters"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Grant M. Waters|publisher=Eastbourne Fine Art|year=1975|title=Dictionary of British Artists Working 1900-1950|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meninsky introduced Kestelman, who became a lifelong friend, to the [[London Group]] and he, Kestelman, helped with the organization of the Group's 1926 exhibition. Hartricks' teaching led Kestelman to an appreciation of French art and he would visit France for extended periods most years from 1930 onwards.

After graduating from the Central School in 1925, Kestelman enrolled at the [[Royal College of Art]] where he studied until 1929.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Buckman|publisher=Art Dictionaries Ltd|year=1998|title=Artists in Britain Since 1945 Vol 1, A to L |ISBN=0 95326 095 X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spalding"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Frances Spalding]]|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|year=1990|title=20th Century Painters and Sculptors |ISBN=1 85149 106 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time he developed a talent for theatre and stage design such that he created a number of costume designs for a 1929 production of ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]]. Later he created sets for ''[[Carmen]]'' at [[Sadler's Wells Theatre|Sadler's Wells]] in 1940 and for several productions by the [[Old Vic Theatre|Old Vic]] Company including the 1944 staging of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''  starring [[Ralph Richardson]], [[Sybil Thorndike]] and [[Laurence Olivier]] at the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]].&lt;ref name=IndieMK/&gt;&lt;ref name=Richard&gt;{{cite web |author=|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O1282956/morris-kestelman-design-for-richard-set-design-kestelman-morris/|title=Morris Kestelman design for Richard III |date=|accessdate=29 June 2016|work= [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher [[Noel Carrington]] commissioned Kestelman to produce a large series of pastel drawings for a book on the [[Bertram Mills Circus]]. The book was never published due to the outbreak of the Second World War.&lt;ref name="PalMac"/&gt;

During World War Two, Kestelman served as a full-time [[Air Raid Precautions in the United Kingdom|air-raid warden]] and also drew scenes of workers at an aircraft repair factory. One of these drawings was subsequently purchased by the [[War Artists' Advisory Committee]] and is now held by the [[Imperial War Museum]].&lt;ref name=IWMmk&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/1050001271|title=War artists archive, M Kestelman |year=|accessdate=29 June 2016|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the War, in 1943, when reports of the [[Holocaust]] first reached Britain, Kestelman responded with the painting ''Lama Sabachthani (Why have you forsaken me?)'', whose title is taken from a line in [[Psalm 22]].&lt;ref name=Response&gt;{{cite web |author=Jessica Talarico &amp; Gemma Lawrence|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/history/artists-responses-to-the-holocaust |title=Artists' Response To The Holocaust |year=|accessdate=27 June 2015|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DJames&gt;{{cite web |author=Dan James|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/art60507|title=Artists As Witness To The Holocaust At Imperial War Museum|date=5 September 2008|accessdate=22 September 2016|work=Culture 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was first exhibited at the 1943 ''For Liberty'' exhibition organised by the [[Artists' International Association]] in the shelter constructed on the bomb site of the John Lewis department store on [[Oxford Street]] in central London.&lt;ref name="WW2Art"&gt;{{cite book|author=|publisher=Imperial War Museum|year=2007|title=Art from the Second World War|ISBN=978-1-904897-66-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After teaching at [[Wimbledon School of Art]], in 1951 Kestelman secured the post of Head of the Painting and Sculpture School at the Central School of Art and Design. He held this post until 1971. Although during this period his time for painting was largely restricted to the college holidays, he still made time to experiment with his art and developed a highly abstract style. Murals by Kestelman were included in exhibitions at the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] in both 1946 and 1960.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; Memorial exhibitions for Kestelman were held at the Boundary Gallery and at the Friends Room of the Royal Academy in 2001.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; Further exhibitions of his work were held at [[Lauderdale House]] in 2002 and 2003 and at the [[London Jewish Cultural Centre]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="BuckmanVol1"/&gt; Kestelman also exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]], with the [[London Group]] and with the [[New English Art Club]].&lt;ref name="GMWaters"/&gt;

'''Mrs. John L. Strong''' is a privately held American luxury company and manufacturer of custom papers and [[stationery]]. Founded in 1929 by Mrs. John L. (Flora) Strong, the company has created papers and custom luxury products for seven presidential families, royal houses, prominent members of international society, film stars and celebrities. Called the "''ne plus ultra'' of chic stationery companies," Mrs. John L. Strong has an important international clientele.

Mrs. Strong  offers hand-engraving to its clients. Mrs. Strong's bespoke products display a range of crafts which are rarely used by others in the industry, including hand [[engraving]] of [[die (manufacturing)|die]]s in [[steel]], hand-stamping of dies, hand-mixing of custom [[varnish]] [[ink]]s, hand-beveling and bordering, and hand-lining of envelopes. Mrs. Strong creates its own 100% cotton archival quality papers in its signature color "Strong's Vanilla" based on Mrs. Strong's original formulas.

==History==
Mrs. John L. Strong (née Flora Feldstein) established her eponymous firm in the aftermath of the stock market crash of 1929. Joining forces with her sister, the owner of a luxury [[wikt:trousseau|trousseau]] shop called Bournefield Linens, Mrs. Strong began selling wedding and social papers to New York's elite from Bournefield's location at 57th Street and Fifth Avenue.

Mrs. Strong's business soon outstripped the space at Bournefield, and she moved her location twice, first to 714 [[Madison Avenue]], and later to the landmark 699 Madison Avenue, originally built as a New York home for the firm [[Fortnum &amp; Mason]], where the firm remains with a fifth floor atelier for private clients and a duplex ground floor boutique.

Mrs. Strong joined the "Street of Shops" on the first floor at Henri Bendel's in the 1950s.  Mrs. Strong also sold through Gump's Department store in San Francisco. From her locations Mrs. Strong created papers for the [[Duke of Windsor]] and [[Wallis, The Duchess of Windsor]], [[Barbara Hutton]], the [[Rockefeller]], [[Astor family|Astor]], [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilt]], and [[DuPont]] families, as well as [[Bette Davis]], [[Diana Vreeland]], [[Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy]], [[Barbara Paley]], and other icons of style.

After the death of Mrs. Strong in 1979, the firm was sold by Strong's heirs to Robert and Joy Lewis. As director, Joy Lewis maintained Strong's standards of quality, refusing to adopt modern methods, and preserving vital techniques of the crafts of artist-engraving and hand-stamping.  The Lewises brought master engraver Fred Diefenbach to the firm, where he created dies for twenty years before retiring from engraving in his 90's, leaving Mrs. Strong with one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of dies from the 19th through the 20th century.  The firm now boasts a collection of thousands of artist-engraved dies.

In 2002, the company was purchased by financier [[Jeffrey Lubin]] and his wife, designer [[Nannette Brown]].  Since 2002, Brown has pioneered the launch of seasonal collections based on fashion trends, known as "ready to write" collections, and has expanded the offerings of the company at its various locations by creating new goods in leather and silver.  The company continues to expand, attracting an ever-younger and more fashion-oriented clientele, including important fashion designers, architects, artists, and interior designers, in addition to its long-standing clientele of social and international leaders.

On May 21, 2009, [[Nannette Brown]] announced  that she would close the business.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nymag.com/daily/fashion/2009/05/mrs_john_l_strong_closing_mark.html New York Magazine: Mrs John L Strong's Closing Marks a Sad Day for Luxury&lt;/ref&gt; On September 29, 2009, Crain's New York Business reported that the brand had been purchased in an auction (after filing for Chapter 11 protection in the Southern District of New York in August) by Houston-based private equity firm J.P. Kotts &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20090929/FREE/909299991&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Ohio Art Company''' is an American toy [[manufacturing]] company founded in 1908. Based in [[Bryan, Ohio]], the company is principally engaged in two lines of business. The first line of business is the sales, marketing, and distribution of [[toy]]s including the [[Etch A Sketch]], and [[Nanoblock]]. (The Etch A Sketch and Doodle Sketch brands were sold in early 2016 to Canadian-based company [[Spin Master]].) The second line of business is the company's Diversified Products segment which manufactures custom metal lithography products for food container and specialty premium markets. Examples of these are food tins, enclosures, DVD cases, and nostalgic signs.

==History==
Henry Winzeler started up his own manufacturing company in 1908. He rented an area to work in Archbold, Ohio and named it the Ohio Art Company because of his profound interest in art and its location. Winzeler began making metal picture frames and various other novelty items that were sold in retail stores all over the [[US]]. The company moved locations in 1912 to [[Bryan, Ohio]] where it became even more successful with its Cupid Awake/Cupid Asleep picture frames. The Ohio Art Company then installed metal lithography equipment. This was used to produce picture frames made out of wood-grained metal sheets. In 1917, the Ohio Art Company began manufacturing toys such as the windmills and climbing monkey. After [[World War I]], the toy company grew exponentially, leading to the introduction of colorful tea sets and drums. In the late 1950s, a French electrician named [[André Cassagnes]] created a drawing toy that used a joystick, glass and aluminum powder. The combination, which he called the "Telecran", gave users the ability to draw a picture and also erase it. After much collaboration with many individuals, the system they developed in the late 1950s is the same one used today. The name of the product was Etch A Sketch. In the 1950s, a man named W.C Killgallon began working for the Ohio Art Company. The Killgallon family still owns and operates the Ohio Art Company. The final product of the Etch A Sketch was first produced on July 12, 1960 at the Bryan, Ohio factory. Though the Ohio Art Company partook in the toy industry and was very successful, the metal lithography sector of the company remains the core part of its business. It is one of the leading producers of specialty lithographic components.

In 1995, the Etch A Sketch toy was featured in the original ''[[Toy Story]]'', in a scene where one performs a "quick draw" duel with Woody. This short 12 second feature was enough to give a significant sales boost, requiring the production line to work overtime to meet demand. By 1999, the company had again fallen into severe financial trouble from canceled orders of various products, reaching a point where the solvency of the company was in question. However, the company recovered with the prudent decision to agree to again have an Etch A Sketch appear in an animated feature film - this time in ''[[Toy Story 2]]''. This scene featured an Etch A Sketch being used to present sketches related to the investigation of Woody's kidnapping. At 45 seconds, the scene in question was much longer than the scene in the original movie. The exposure from the highly successful [[Pixar]] movie resulted in sales of the toy increasing by 20 percent and ensured the survival of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Reilly|first=Terry|title=Brand Envy|url=http://www.cbc.ca/undertheinfluence/season-2/2013/04/27/brand-envy-2/|accessdate=28 April 2013|newspaper=CBC Radio One: Under the Influence|date=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Seewer|first=John|title=Etch A Sketch's big screen break worth millions|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=FtI0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gU4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3079%2C4484763|accessdate=7 November 2013|newspaper=The Bryan Times|date=24 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2016, The Ohio Art Company announced that it has sold its Etch A Sketch and Doodle Sketch brands, in a move designed to allow it to focus on its metal lithography business and invest in its manufacturing operations in Bryan. Ohio Art's other toy lines were not included in the sale.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ohioart.com/release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/business/ohio-art-sells-etch-a-sketch-to-spin-master.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chavez|first1=Jon|title=Ohio Art sells its Etch A Sketch line|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/local/2016/02/12/Ohio-Art-sells-its-Etch-A-Sketch-line.html|website=toledoblade.com|publisher=''[[The Toledo Blade]]''|accessdate=23 May 2016|date=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pacific Institute of Culinary Arts''', founded in 1996, is a privately run culinary school located just outside the entrance of [[Granville Island]] in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]]. The school is fully accredited by the Private Career Training Institutions Agency of British Columbia until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picachef.com/program_affiliations.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diploma Programs==

The Pacific Institute of Culinary Arts offers [[diplomas]] both in [[Culinary Arts]] and Pastry Arts; each full-time program runs for 6 months. Classes are held 5 days a week, running approximately 7 hours per day for a total of 917 hours. Four sessions per year are offered, starting in September, January, March and June. The classes are 90% hands-on, the chef-student ratio is 1:15 for Culinary Arts &lt;ref&gt;http://www.picachef.com/culinary_arts.html&lt;/ref&gt; and 1:12 for Pastry Arts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picachef.com/baking_pastry_arts.html&lt;/ref&gt; All chef instructors are European-trained and have at least 10 years experience. 

As of September 2010, approximately 2000 students, from Canada and other nations, have graduated from both programs. Applicants do not need to have any prior kitchen experience, but a high school diploma and the ability to read, write and speak English is required.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.picachef.com/faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt; The programs are intended to give students a solid foundation of theoretical and practical training to improve their chances of success in the industry, but they should not expect to go from school directly to an Executive [[Chef]] position.

==Restaurant and Bakeshop==

[[File:PICA Culinary.jpg|thumb|Entree made by Culinary Arts Students]]

The school has a restaurant, Bistro 101, and bakeshop, Bakery 101, on the premises. In 2009, 2010, the restaurant was awarded ‘Diners Choice’ by [http://opentable.com Open Table] diners. Culinary students work in the kitchen and in the front of the house as wait staff, while the pastry students make [[bread]] and [[pastries]] for the restaurant and bakeshop.

[[File:Books.by.women.photographers.jpeg|thumb|right|An example of some photo books]]

A '''photo book''' or '''photobook''' is a book in which [[photograph]]s make a significant contribution to the overall content. A photo book is related to and also often used as a [[coffee table book]].

[[File:The cult of the street Henry Bond.jpg|thumb |upright | Front cover of [[Henry Bond |Henry Bond's]] 1998 photo-book ''The cult of the street'']]

==Early photo books==
Early photo-books are characterised by their use of photographic printing as part of their reprographic technology. Photographic prints were tipped-in rather than printed directly onto the same paper stock used for [[letterpress]] printed text. Many early titles were printed in very small editions and were released as partworks to a network of well-informed and privileged readers. Few original examples of these books survive today, due to their vulnerability to light and damage caused by frequent handling.

What is arguably the first photo book, ''[[Anna Atkins#Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions|Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions]]'' (1843&amp;ndash;1853) was created by [[Anna Atkins]]. The book was released as a partwork to assist the scientific community in the identification of marine specimens. The non-silver [[cyanotype]] printing process worked by pressing actual specimens in contact with light-sensitive paper; hence the word "impression" in the book's title.&lt;ref name="parrbadger1"&gt;{{cite book | author1 = Martin Parr | author2 = Gerry Badger | authorlink1 = Martin Parr | authorlink2 = Gerry Badger | title = The Photobook: A History, Volume I | place = London | publisher = [[Phaidon Press]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 978-0-7148-4285-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14, 20&amp;ndash;21}}

''[[The Pencil of Nature]]'' (1844&amp;ndash;46) was produced by [[William Henry Fox Talbot]], who had invented  the [[Calotype]] photographic process in 1839. Although significant as the first negative/positive photography process, the Calotype was also envisioned as a commercial prospect for the reproduction of images in books through mass publication. Anticipating commercial success, Fox Talbot established purpose-made printing premises in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] to carry out the reproduction of his book. ''The Pencil of Nature'' was released in six parts between 1844 and 1846, to an initially promising list of private subscribers whose numbers dwindled, causing the premature termination of his project.&lt;ref name="parrbadger1"/&gt;{{rp|13&amp;ndash;15,22}}

[[Julia Margaret Cameron]] created the first photo book to illustrate a literary work. The 1874 edition of [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s ''[[Idylls of the King]]'' contained twelve Cameron images that had been specially created, but reproduced as wood engravings. Cameron sought her own publisher, creating a new version of ''Idylls of the King,'' containing her original photographs as albumen prints, which came out in December of the same year.&lt;ref name="parrbadger1"/&gt;{{rp|69}}

==Japanese photo books==

[[File:Some books by Shimizu Bukou.jpeg|thumb|right|150 px|Some photo books by [[Bukō Shimizu]]]]

Photographers such as [[Shinzō Fukuhara]] were producing photography books in the 1920s. The postwar years brought low-priced photography books, such as the many volumes of [[Iwanami Shoten|Iwanami]] Shashin Bunko magazine. From the 1950s onward, most Japanese photographers of note have had photo books published.

The simplest Japanese translation of photo book is ''shashinshū'' ({{nihongo2|写真集}}), and the ''shashinshū'' section of a typical Japanese bookstore displays books of photographs with various levels of documentary or [[art]]istic merit. They primarily portray currently popular [[Japanese idol|celebrities]] in a variety of settings and outfits. Many are of [[gravure idol|cheesecake]] models (''guradoru''), or porn starlets (''nūdoru''); others are of singers, television personalities, professional sportswomen (often wrestlers) and so forth.

One of the best selling Japanese photobooks of all time, ''[[Santa Fe (Kishin Shinoyama book)|Santa Fe]]'' (1991), a fine art nude photo book modelled by [[Rie Miyazawa]] and photographed by [[Kishin Shinoyama]], sold 1.5 million copies in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;http://photoguide.jp/txt/Shinoyama_Kishin&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- ==Conceptual photo books== --&gt;
&lt;!-- ==Independent and self-published photo books== --&gt;

== Personalized photo books ==

Storing digital images in traditional photo albums means printed copies are inserted in the pages of an album. Companies allow users to create personalized photo books. The resulting book is printed on digital color printers and case bound.

Professional printing and binding services offer easy creation of photo books with professional layouts and individual layout capabilities. Because of the integrated design and order workflow, hardcover bound books with customized pictures and text can be produced very cost-effectively.

Currently there are many photo book software companies who sell licensed solutions to photo labs and print houses so that their customers can create photo books (and other photo related paraphernalia) with ease. These software solutions are available for free download or online access or through apps.

==Online photo books==

The development of digital cameras and the Internet allowed an enormous production and exchange of pictures, taken from different corners of the
globe. There are many possibilities nowadays for users to upload and share pictures (examples are [[Google]] and [[Facebook]]). However, many people and institutions also publish 'photo books' on the web, by providing the community with a huge web database freely available for everybody.

The '''Prague Philharmonia''' (''Pražská komorní filharmonie'', abbreviation: PKF; literal translation, "Prague Chamber Philharmonia") is an orchestra based in [[Prague]], the [[Czech Republic]].  The orchestra gives concerts in several venues in Prague, including the Dvořák Hall of the [[Rudolfinum]], the Church of St. Simon and Juda, the Švanda Theatre (Smíchov) and the Salon Philharmonia.  The orchestra receives government and civic sponsorship from the Czech Ministry of Culture, the City of Prague and the Prague 1 Municipal Authority.  The orchestra contains 52 musicians, as of the 2015-2016 season.

[[Jiří Bělohlávek]] founded the orchestra in 1993, after his resignation as chief conductor of the [[Czech Philharmonic]] the previous year.  The Czech Ministry of Defence had offered funding for training 40 young musicians to act as their own music ensemble, to replace the [[Prague Symphony Orchestra]] in that capacity.  Bělohlávek decided to form a new chamber orchestra instead with the funds, and had auditioned musicians for the orchestra.  However, the ministry withdrew its funding the next year.  Bělohlávek subsequently secured private funding for the orchestra,&lt;ref name="Ashley"&gt;{{cite news | author=Tim Ashley | title=The sound of freedom | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/mar/01/artsfeatures | work=The Guardian | date=2001-03-01 | accessdate=2009-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which made its public debut in 1994.  Bělohlávek served as the orchestra's first music director and chief conductor, from 1994 to 2005.  He led the orchestra in its debut at [[The Proms]] in London in July 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Erica Jeal | title=Prague Philharmonia (review of Prom 4, 2004) | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/jul/24/classicalmusicandopera.proms2004 | work=The Guardian | date=2004-07-24 | accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bělohlávek subsequently held the title of conductor laureate of the orchestra from 2005 until his death in 2017.

The Swiss conductor [[Kaspar Zehnder]] became the orchestra's second chief conductor in 2005, and [[Jakub Hrůša]] simultaneously became principal guest conductor.  Zehnder stepped down from the chief conductorshp in June 2008 at the expiration of his contract.  In March 2008, the orchestra announced the appointment of Hrůša as their third chief conductor, effective in September 2008.  Hrůša held the post through the 2014-2015 season.  In October 2014, the orchestra announced the appointment of [[Emmanuel Villaume]] as its fourth chief conductor, effective with the 2015-2016 season, with an initial contract of 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Raymond Johnston | title=PKF - Prague Philharmonia names new conductor | url=http://www.praguepost.com/142-culture/42210-pkf-prague-philharmonia-names-new-conductor | work=Prague Post | date=2014-10-22 | accessdate=2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The orchestra has made recordings for a number of labels, including [[Supraphon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Andrew Clements | title=Dvorak: The Stubborn Lovers: Kloubova/ Brezina/ Sykorova/ Belacek/ Janal/ Prague Philharmonia/ Belohlavek | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/apr/02/classicalmusicandopera.shopping3 | work=The Guardian | date=2004-04-02 | accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Andrew Clements | title=Smetana: Ma Vlast – review | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/14/smetana-va-vlast-hrusa-review | work=The Guardian | date=2010-10-14 | accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deutsche Grammophon]], [[Warner Classics]], [[EMI Classics|EMI]], [[Harmonia Mundi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Andrew Clements | title=Mozart: Symphonies Nos 35 &amp; 36, Prague Philharmonia/ Belohlavek | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/aug/19/classicalmusicandopera.shopping3 | work=The Guardian | date=2005-08-19 | accessdate=2008-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pentatone (record label)|Pentatone]].

[[File:Petroglyphs in Teimareh, Khomein, Iran.jpg|thumb|Petroglyphs in Teimareh, Khomein, Iran]]
'''Rock art in Iran''' includes archaeological [[petroglyph]]s, or carving in rock; [[rock art#pictograph|pictographs]], or painting on rock; and [[rock reliefs]]. Large numbers of prehistoric [[rock art]], more than 50,000, have been discovered in [[Iran]]. 

Dating back to 40,800 years before present in Iran, rock art is the oldest surviving artwork. Prehistoric rock art provides insights into past eras and cultures. Archaeologists classify the tools for carving petroglyphs by their historical era. Incising tools include flint, metal, or thigh bones of hunted prey. 

The largest rock art panel in Iran, located near [[Malayer]] in [[Hamadan Province]] spans 12 meters and features more than 100 petroglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/middle_east/iran_rock_art/index.php|title=Middle East Rock Art Archive: Iran Rock Art Gallery|first= |last= |work=Bradshaw Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
The earliest known petroglyphs are in [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golpayegan Timareh]]] dating back to 40,800 years ago. The earliest known pictographs in Iran are in [[Yafteh]] cave in [[Lorestan Province]] and date back 40,000 years.

Ancient Iranian pottery and bronze sculpture continue designs found in the rock art. This continuity suggests the impressiveness of petroglyphs of the facades of caves and rocks reflected to ancient Iranian artisans.This continuity can be traced from eighth millennium BCE by the potteries in Ganj Darreh near Harseen in Kermanshah state, to the third and first millennium BCE, considering the bronze period in Lorestan.

Iran provides exclusive demonstrations of script formation from pictogram, ideogram, linear (2300 BCE) or proto-Elamite, geometric old Elamite script, Pahlavi script, Arabic script (906 years ago), Kufi script, and Farsi script back to at least 250 years ago. 

The most recent chronology of petroglyphs in Iran was done employing the [[General Antiparticle Spectrometer]] in 2008 that helped gather data from random samples; though, this is a demanding job that needs a systematic and comprehensive supported effort.

== Categories ==
[[File:Taimerh 3.jpg|thumb|Curious boy sitting near petroglyphs]]
Pictographs that contain pictures drawn by pigments like smut, crystallized blood, ochre, that were employed by binders like animal fats, blood, seed oil and organic compounds, or a mixture of all materials mentioned above. Lorestan has the most and oldest pictographs in Iran. Yafteh cave in Lorestan has pictographs dating back to 40,000 years ago.Compared to petroglyphs, pictographs in Iran are scarce and rare.

'''The Roux Scholarship''' is a cooking competition for up and coming chefs in the UK. Set up by the brothers [[Michel Roux|Michel]] and [[Albert Roux]], and now run by their sons [[Alain Roux]] and [[Michel Roux Jr.|Michel Roux Jr]]. It was first run in 1984 with [[Andrew Fairlie (chef)|Andrew Fairlie]] being named the first winner. It has since been run on a yearly basis, with winners going on to win a three-month placement in a [[Michelin star]]red restaurants including the [[French Laundry]] and [[Maison Pic]].

==History==
[[Michel Roux]] credits Nick Rowe with originating the idea for the Roux Scholarship. Rowe was dining at Roux's [[Waterside Inn]] when he suggested to Roux that the Roux brothers could front a scholarship for up and coming chefs and that Rowe's credit card company would be willing to back it financially. Michel spoke to his brother [[Albert Roux|Albert]] the following day, who said that Michel could lead on it. Michel thought it would be a good way for young chefs to gain experience in French restaurants, which were not open to employing British chefs at the time.&lt;ref name=tvchoice&gt;{{cite news|title=Michel Roux: The Roux Scholarship|url=http://www.tvchoicemagazine.co.uk/interviewextra/michel-roux-roux-scholarship|accessdate=3 September 2012|newspaper=TV Choice|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was formerly known as the Roux Diners Club Scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chris Colmer wins Roux Diners Club Scholarship|url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/30/01/2008/26826/chris-colmer-wins-roux-diners-club-scholarship.htm|accessdate=3 September 2012|newspaper=Caterer and Hotelkeeper|date=30 March 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each entrant must enter a paper application, which are then reviewed and broken down into regional competitions. Each regional winner goes through to the final, where there is one Scholar named.&lt;ref name=uktvgoodfood/&gt;&lt;ref name=adamsmith&gt;{{cite news|last=Kühn|first=Kerstin|title=Adam Smith named 2012 Roux Scholar|url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/22/06/2012/343465/Adam-Smith-named-2012-Roux-Scholar.htm|accessdate=3 September 2012|newspaper=Caterer and Hotelkeeper|date=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrants are limited to chefs who are working in full-time employment.&lt;ref name=oneweek2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Kühn|first=Kerstin|title=One week left to enter the 2012 Roux Scholarship|url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/23/01/2012/341988/One-week-left-to-enter-the-2012-Roux-Scholarship.htm|accessdate=3 September 2012|newspaper=Caterer and Hotelkeeper|date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chefs are not limited to applying on one occasion; both [[Simon Hulstone]] and [[Mark Birchall]] competed on four occasions before winning.&lt;ref name=adamsmith/&gt; The winner of the competition is allowed to choose a three [[Michelin star]]red restaurant to cook in for three months.&lt;ref name="uktvgoodfood"&gt;{{cite web|title = The Roux Scholarship|url = http://goodfood.uktv.co.uk/the-roux-masterclass/video/angela-hartnett-cooks-stone-bass-and-squid/|publisher = Good Food|accessdate = 3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarah Gavron''' (born 20 April 1970) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[film director]]. She has directed four short films, and three feature films.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Garcia, Maria. "Demanding To Be Heard". ''Film Journal International''. '''118'''.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first film is, [[This Little Life]] (2003); [[Brick Lane (2007 film)|Brick Lane]] (2007) is her second most recognized film; Village at the End of the World (2012); and her latest film, [[Suffragette (film)|Suffragette]] (2015) that is based in London of 1912 which tells the story of the Suffragette movement based on realistic, historical events.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Gwen Seabourne. (2016) Deeds, Words and Drama: A Review of the Film Suffragette (2015). ''Feminist Legal Studies'' 24:1, pages 115-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Gavron is also both a wife and a mother, and "got into filmmaking to make a difference." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Puchko, Kristy (2015-10-22). [http://www.indiewire.com/2015/10/suffragette-director-sarah-gavron-on-the-importance-of-representation-and-those-controversial-t-shirts-56311/ "'Suffragette' Director Sarah Gavron on The Importance of Representation and Those Controversial T-Shirts".] ''IndieWire''.&lt;/ref&gt;  She has dedicated her career to accurately telling the stories of women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, the scarcity of women filmmakers in the U.K is what inspires Gavron with her own filmmaking, and her responsibility as a female director.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Biography==
Gavron was educated at [[Camden School for Girls]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/dec/08/mondaymediasection4 Interview: film maker Sarah Gavron | Media | The Guardian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from the [[University of York]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in English in 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an MA in film studies from [[Edinburgh College of Art]] when it was associated with [[Heriot-Watt University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/successes-at-heriot-watt-university-1.494708 |title= Successes at Heriot-Watt University |accessdate=31 May 2013|work= The Herald |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Edinburgh College of Art, Sarah Gavron was granted a position in a directing class that was taught by Stephen Frears.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Frears is one of her greatest influences in filmmaking and directing, as well as Mike Leigh and Terrence Davies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She then worked for the [[BBC]] for three years. She went on to study feature film directing at the [[National Film and Television School]] in London. The actor [[Rafi Gavron]] is the son of her half-brother, Simon Gavron.

Gavron is married to cinematographer David Katznelson, and together, they have two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Falk|first1=Quentin|title=Sarah Gavron: Interview|url=http://guru.bafta.org/sarah-gavron-interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gavron began her film career making documentaries, a field that seemed "more accessible at that point," but kept returning to narrative filmmaking because of her desire to tell stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://guru.bafta.org/sarah-gavron-on-directing | title = Sarah Gavron: On Directing | date = 12 October 2015 | website = BAFTA Guru | access-date = 13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first film, This Little Life (2003), is classified as a television drama with the plot surrounding a couple and their premature born child;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Brick Lane (2007) is her second most recognized feature film, that is an adaptation of [[Monica Ali]]'s novel ''[[Brick Lane (2007 film)|Brick Lane]],'' &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Murray, J. (2008, Summer). Brick lane. ''Cineaste, 33'', 52-54&lt;/ref&gt; which encapsulates the life of an Indian, female immigrant living in London, U.K;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Village at the End of the World (2012) which is a documentary that Sarah Gavron directed in a peninsula in Greenland;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and her latest film Suffragette (2015) that is based in London of 1912 which tells the story of the Suffragette movement, specifically, the early twentieth century campaign of women's suffrage that centers the lives of three women that take on fictitious names in the film, however represent non-fictional historical figures.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In Brick Lane (2007) Gavron centers the female protagonist in "one of the most ethically diverse neighborhoods in the United Kingdom." &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Sarah Gavron points out that Suffragette (2015) is "this first major feature film to focus on the fight for women's suffrage, and it is a personal film and the highest-profile film for Gavron." &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Smyth, J. E. (2015, Winter). The past, present, and future of women's history on screen: An interview with Sarah Gavron. ''Cineaste, 41'', 18-21&lt;/ref&gt; The film conveys important themes regarding legal and social positions of women, wives and mothers in 1912.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   Gavron believes that the women's suffrage movement must be regarded as a "multi stranded, and complex story that is still unfolding." &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Gavron intended Suffragette to be telling of important moments in the past, but also relevant in present day. Gavron believes that her specific focus on ordinary, every day women would make her film, and ultimately her message as a feminist, relevant across time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

The film Suffragette (2015) was acquired by [[Focus Features]] (originally [[Relativity Media|Relativity]]) in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Focus Features to Release SUFFRAGETTE|url=http://www.focusfeatures.com/blog/focus_features_to_release_suffragette|accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film premiered at the 2015 [[Telluride Film Festival]].

In the second season, the characters are transported to Zahramay Falls, a magical land where Shimmer and Shine live. Leah reveals her genies' existence to Zac, who is given a genie of his own, named Kaz.

==Characters==

===Humans and Genies===
*Shimmer (voiced by [[Eva Bella]]) – An optimistic genie with blue eyes and pink hair. She is enthusiastic and encouraging. She loves cleaning, glitter, and collecting genie bottles. Her pet is a [[gibbon monkey]] named Tala.
*Shine (voiced by [[Isabella Cramp]]) – A courageous genie with purple eyes and blue hair. She is an animal lover and is often hungry. Her pet is a [[Bengal tiger]] cub named Nahal. Due to her love of animals, she is very knowledgeable about the behaviors of magical creatures native to Zahramay Falls. Unlike her sister, she hates cleaning. A running gag involves Shine saying "It's like I always say..." only to humorously reveal that she has just made up whatever she says next.
*Leah (voiced by [[Alina Foley]]) – A blonde girl with green eyes who owns a genie bottle necklace, which includes Shimmer and Shine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=The Sweetest Thing |minutes=3 |series=Shimmer and Shine |quote=Boom Zahramay! Your best friends are on the way.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Shimmer and Shine usually mess up her wishes, Leah is patient and forgiving with them. Originally, she was forced to keep her genies existence a secret from her close friend Zac, but revealed her secret to him after being transported to Zahramay Falls. In the second season, Princess Samira grants Leah and Zac's wish to visit Zahramay Falls whenever they want. While visiting her genies in Zahramay Falls, Leah magically dons a genie disguise in order to blend in, as humans are normally not allowed in Zahramay Falls.
*Zac (voiced by Blake Bertrand in the first two seasons, Justin Felbinger from season three and onward) – Leah's neighbor with red hair and blue eyes, and best human friend. In the first season, he is oblivious to the fact that Leah has genies. Whenever something strange or unusual happens, he responds to it in a carefree manner. He also has a habit of telling humorous experiences he has had to Leah. In the second season, he learns that Leah has genies and gets a genie of his own named Kaz.
*Princess Samira (voiced by [[Nikki SooHoo]]) – The ruler of Zahramay Falls with violet eyes and ice blue hair, who is in charge of checking up on all the genies in training. She can grant wishes along with the younger genies. She occasionally rewards genies with magic Genie Gems that can have a variety of magical effects. She acts as Shimmer and Shine's mentor and teacher. Despite Zeta being her self-proclaimed rival, Samira likes Zeta and is willing to give her a second chance at becoming a genie-in-training, which in season three is revealed to be due to her past friendship with Zeta when they were both students under Empress Caliana and hopes that Zeta and her can one day become friends again.
*Zeta the Sorceress (voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]]) – A resident of Zahramay Falls with green eyes and purple hair, who is Princess Samira's rival and wishes to replace her as the most powerful person in Zahramay Falls. Zeta is a sorceress instead of a genie, as she has no desire to grant the wishes of others, relying on magic potions and magical items. Her plans are almost always thwarted by Shimmer, Shine, and Leah. However, her own arrogance and ignorance can cause her to foil her own schemes as well. Despite the trouble she causes, the girls and Zac don't hold it against her and generally try to be friendly towards her when not foiling her schemes. Though she tends to be antagonistic towards Leah and her genies, she can be civil towards them at times and even work with them such when she finds herself and/or Nazboo in danger usually when her schemes backfire, which usually results in them saving her. Before becoming a sorceress, she was a genie-in-training under Empress Caliana along with Samira, whom Zeta befriended when she was a new student, though later quit school due to her jealousy of Samira and decided to become a sorceress instead, though despite her current rivalry with Samira is shown to cherish their past friendship as she held onto a feather pen Samira gave her when they first met along with a picture of the two of them together when they were both still friends.
*Kaz (voiced by [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]]) – A genie in training with blue eyes and magenta hair who becomes Zac's genie in the second season. In contrast to Zac's easy-going and adventurous personality, Kaz is more cautious and scared easily. Despite their contrasting personalities, Zac and Kaz work well together and can be brave when he has to be. His cautious nature also means he puts more thought into how he grants Zac's wishes. Like most genies in Zahramay Falls, he has his own magic carpet, though sometimes uses Zac's Super Zoom Flyer, a magic carpet wished up by Zac. Kaz has a pet Ziffilon named Zain, who summoned by one of Zac's wishes after he learned that Kaz always wanted a Ziffilon as a pet. Though he and Zac get along well, he occasionally becomes unenthusiastic when granting wishes for Zac he would prefer not too. He was initially afraid of Zac's dog Rocket due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though eventually overcame his fear after Zac and the girls reminded him of how other genies were initially scared of Zain before they got to know him.
*Empress Caliana (voiced by [[Barbara Eden]]) – Princess Samira's famous, semi-retired mentor with purple eyes and blonde hair. Caliana was the one who gave Samira her special necklace back when she was a little genie-in-training. Empress Caliana was a great explorer when she was a little girl and made many groundbreaking discoveries, such as finding the Caliana Caves. She is also old friends with Rohan, the normally shy crystalline golem that guards the caves. When Zeta and Samira were younger, Caliana taught genies-in-training at her school in Genie Hall, where Zeta was her top student. While praising Zeta's potion making skills, she tried to teach her to be more considerate of others and assigned Samira to sit next to Zeta when Samira was a new student which lead to Samira befriending Zeta, though Zeta eventually became jealous of Samira when she became the class's new top student, which eventually lead Zeta to quit school and decide to become a Sorceress instead after her attempt to sabotage Samira backfired, though Caliana expressed hope to Samira that she would one day return. 
*Captain Zora (voiced by [[Kellie Pickler]] from season two finale, [[Kate Higgins]] from season three and onward) – A pirate genie who is Shine's idol. She is absentminded at times and can be very clumsy and forgetful, especially when she is on an adventure. She owns a flying pirate ship that she sometimes accidentally docks in odd places. Shine loves pirate genies and Captain Zora is her favorite of them all, so she gets very nervous and sometimes cannot talk clearly when she is around Zora.
*Layla (voiced by [[Danica McKellar]]) – An ice genie who is a good friend of Princess Samira. She possesses an ice gem necklace that gives her freezing powers and keeps her body cold. She originally lived in a genie bottle buried on a sandy beach in Zahramay Falls, but it was accidentally broken by Leah and her genies. She currently lives in an ice palace.
*Shaya (voiced by Kin Santiago) – A lightning genie in training who rides around on a flying cloud-board and can generate magical lightning. Leah and her genies help him catch a run away magic lightning bolt he created while practicing his magic. Though he is reluctant to work with Leah and her genies at first, he eventually learns the value of teamwork from them.
*Nila (voiced by Mila Brener) – A mermaid who lives in the waters near Zahramay Falls. Leah and her genies befriend Nila after Leah wishes to find a Mermaid after learning they are real. She helps the girls obtain the Mermaid Gem to change the girls back to their non-mermaid selves after Leah accidentally uses up her wishes which leaves the girls trapped in Mermaid form. After Nila and the girls obtain the gem by befriending its lonely Guardian, she teaches them the spell to activate the gem's power which can both transform into Mermaids as well as undo the transformation allowing the girls to visit Nila and go on underwater adventures with her. 
*Imma  (voiced by Grace Kaufman) – The Waterfall Genie who oversees the source of the rainbow waterfalls of Zahramay Falls in Rainbow Zahramay. The girls befriend her after Samira sends them on their first adventure to Rainbow Zahramay to investigate the cause of a weird mist produced by the falls that disrupts magic in Zahramay Falls and help Imma resolve the problem. Imma can use water magic that allows her to manipulate water using her magic staff which she also uses to activate the locks that control the flow of rainbow water to the falls.
* Wishy Washy Genie (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) - A male genie whose powerful magic is to remove or fix a wish that cannot be used on other genies. He can be very wishy washy, just like his name. But while on the their adventure to find his home, the children help him make decisions.
*Ayla (voiced by [[Liliana Mumy]]) – A hair-changing genie who has the power to change hairstyles.
*Minu (voiced by Kitana Turnbull) – A flitter genie.
*Nadia (voiced by Brittany Snow) - The dream genie who is the only genie capable of granting wishes involving dreams and specializes in dream magic which involve using magic dust. She is also in charge of crafting special dreams for everyone in Zahramay Falls. As a result, she knows about everyone in Zahramay Falls. However it is rare for her to make dreams actually come true. 
*Ezri (voiced by Gunnar Sizemore) - Nadia's assistant who like Nadia knows about everybody in Zahramay Falls as he recognizes Leah, Shimmer, Shine, and even Zeta on first meeting them.

===Animals===
All animals in the series are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].
*Tala – Shimmer's pet [[gibbon monkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/tala/41pirj|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707235316/http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/tala/41pirj|archivedate=July 7, 2017|title=Tala from Shimmer and Shine – Nick Asia|work=[[Nickelodeon (Southeast Asia)|Nickelodeon Southeast Asia]]|publisher=[[Viacom International|Viacom International, Inc.]]|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has green eyes and wears white pearls, like Shimmer does.

*Nahal – Shine's white [[Bengal tiger]] cub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/nahal/tynsbg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707235134/http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/nahal/tynsbg|archivedate=July 7, 2017|title=Nahal from Shimmer and Shine – Nick Asia|work=[[Nickelodeon (Southeast Asia)|Nickelodeon Southeast Asia]]|publisher=[[Viacom International|Viacom International, Inc.]]|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wears pink jewels and a gold circlet, like Shine does. She has a talent for playing the keyboard.
*Rocket – Zac's pet dog who appears in several episodes of the first season and reappears in the third season. He is a rambunctious dog with a tendency to drool and chew on things which often causes trouble, though is simply an overly playful pouch who means no real harm. He has encountered Shimmer, Shine, Tala, and Nahal at various times. The only pet native to Leah and Zac's world, he eventually is wished to Zahramay Falls by Zac though is mistakenly seen as a monster by genies like Kaz and animals native to genie world like Parisa and Zain who are unfamiliar with dogs at first due to dogs not being native to their world, with the exception of Shimmer, Shine, Tala, Nahal, and Samira. After helping Zac stop Zeta from stealing Samira's staff, Samira permits Rocket to accompany Zac when he visits Zahramay Falls. 
*Nazboo – Zeta's talking pet dragon, who caters to her every need and acts as Zeta's underling. He is somewhat clumsy and often accidentally causes Zeta's schemes to backfire. He can also get easily distracted by food or anything that piques his interest. He also enjoys getting an occasional tummy rubs from Zeta. Though he acts as Zeta's underling most of the time, he is friendly towards Leah, Zac, and their genies as well as their pets to the point he often greets them by saying "''Hi, Friends!''" even in the middle of one of Zeta's schemes. Unlike Zeta, he is generally more considerate of others and prefers to play fair in competitions though usually assists Zeta in cheating. In the third season, he is revealed to be from Manetikar, The Land of Dragons and befriended Zeta when she came to Manetikar to find a dragon for a pet. Feeling sorry for Zeta after her attempt to make one of the larger flying dragons her pet failed, he agreed to become her pet and went home with her to her lair in Zahramay Falls, where he has lived ever since. He has a sister and two brothers who resemble him in appearance and personality.
*Roya – Princess Samira's pet peacock, who resides in her palace. Roya is the polar opposite of Shimmer and Shine's pets, as she would much rather show off her feathers or practice walking gracefully than play or dance. Unlike Samira, Roya has a strong dislike for Zeta and Nazboo, to the point of literally chasing them out of Samira's Palace on one occasion. Once a year, she sheds a special feather with the ability to repair any magical object. 
*Parisa – Leah's pet Zahramay fox who possesses the ability to camouflage herself, making her practically invisible, whenever she wants. she also has a talent for painting. Parisa is introduced midway through the second season. Like Kaz and Zain, she was initially scared of Rocket, due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though not to the same degree that Kaz and Zain were.
*Zain – Kaz's pet Ziffilon (a griffin-like creature). Kaz had always wanted a pet Ziffilon before getting Zain, so Zac uses one of his wishes to wish up a Ziffilon for Kaz. Zain is by far the largest of the pets, as he is big enough for Kaz to ride on his back, though despite his size Zain gets scared easily even more so than Kaz. Like most Ziffilons his favorite food is Zlam Berries and is originally from Ziffilon Island. Though he gets along with the other pets, he is frightened by Rocket at first due to being unfamiliar with dogs though after Zac reminds Kaz and Zain how other genies were scared of Zain at first, he and Kaz manage to overcome their initial fear of Rocket. 
*Zoomicorns – Winged Unicorns native to Zahramay Falls and Rainbow Zahramay introduced in the second season. They are friendly and helpful creatures who occasionally aid the girls and allow them to ride them. There is also a game called Zoomicorn Toss, where players ride flying Zahramay Cloud Boards while trying to throw rings around a Zoomicorn's horn as it flies around, without the use of magic as using magic is considered unfair. The only known named Zoomicorn, is Gleam who lives in Rainbow Zahramay that is a friend of the Glitter Genie Afina whom the girls meet and befriend during one of their adventures in Rainbow Zahramay in the third season. 
*Scallywag – The magical pet of the Pirate Genie Captain Zora, who helps Zora remember things that she forgets such as names and the meaning if words and phrases used by pirates. Scallywag flies around by spinning her tail in helicopter like fashion. Her magic goes out of control when scared causing random magic effects. 
*Nazboo's Family – Nazboo's three siblings Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank who are introduced in the third season. They all small flightless dragons that resemble Nazboo in appearance and share his friendly playful nature as well as his love of food and tummy rubs, though Nazboo and his siblings tend to get into trouble when they are together much to Zeta's frustration and annoyance, when they come to visit Nazboo. His sister Razboo has purple scales and wears a bow on her head. His brother Kazboo has green scales and a mohawk, while his brother Frank has blue scales and wears a bowtie. While Kazboo and Razboo are capable of speech like Nazboo, Frank's vocabulary is apparently limit to saying his own name which doesn't rhyme with his other siblings' names.

The '''Society for Natural Language Technology Research''' (abbr. as '''SNLTR''') is an organization that promotes research in Corpus Linguistics, Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing in [[Bengali language]]. Among its primary goals are creation and archiving of a fully [[Unicode]]-compatible [[Bengali language|Bengali]] literary corpus to be hosted and published online, as well as the creation of fonts that will help people type Bengali text with ease.

== About SNLTR ==

English is still the primary medium of interaction with computers. Consequently, a large section of the population in India is not able to reap the benefits of the technology. Though the issue of localization of interface has been discussed in different forum, the goal is yet to be achieved.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In spite of the fact that desktop publishing has come of age for Bengali and other Indian languages and there are several software available for Bengali, the problem persists due to the absence of i) standardization of Bengali encoding, ii) encoding compliant font design, iii) availability of compliant keyboard layouts etc. The lack of adherence to standard does not allow the computing activities in Indian languages to be inter-operable across computing platforms.

In order to make the computing activities Bengali compatible, it is essential to establish a proper standard. Though a number of organizations have taken up language processing activities, the necessity of establishing proper coherence among them is very much felt, in order to deliver useful products.

Language Technology research has to focus on two components, written text as well as spoken language .Besides text processing, speech generation and recognition are two very important areas in which research and development have to be focused. This development will not only result in more natural human-computer interfaces, but will also empower the physically challenged like those with speech impairment and visual impairment, to benefit from computer technology.

The Society for Natural Language Technology Research has been formed to address the above-mentioned requirements. The society has been seeded by the Government of West Bengal (Dept. of Information Technology) with initial funding and support. Operationally, the society aims to carry out its activities in a multipolar manner, involving other academic and research institutes as well as industries.

Data Representation and Encoding Standard: Society for Natural Language Technology Research has decided to accept UNICODE 5.0 and upwards as the standard for data representation and encoding for Bengali.

== Mission and Goals ==

* To develop technology and standards to make computer usage Bengali enabled.
* To spread out the benefits of language technology research to real life activities including official works, education, and literature through development of suitable applications.
* To establish a collaborative environment of natural language processing related activities with educational and research organizations as well as with industries.

The immediate goals of the society are:
* To establish standards for Bengali text processing to ensure interoperability across platforms.
* To develop large standardized corpus for Bengali text and speech.
* To create an ensemble of available Bengali software and corpus in a standardized form and make them easily available to all.
* To develop new software and modify or enhance the existing software.
* To develop suitable speech Technology for Bengali.
* To work towards similar development for other Eastern Indian Languages.

'''Stanley Louis&lt;!--see VIAF data--&gt; Cavell''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|v|ɛ|l}}; September 1, 1926 – June 19, 2018) was an [[American philosopher]]. He was the [[Cabot family|Walter M. Cabot]] Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value, Emeritus, at [[Harvard University]].  He worked in the fields of [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], and [[ordinary language philosophy]].  As an interpreter, he produced influential works on [[Wittgenstein]], [[J.L. Austin|Austin]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], [[Thoreau]], and [[Heidegger]].  His work is characterized by its conversational tone and frequent literary references.

==Life==
Cavell was born to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. His mother, a locally renowned pianist, trained him in music from his earliest days.&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 21 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; During the Depression, Cavell’s parents moved several times between Atlanta and [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 24 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; As an adolescent, Cavell played lead [[alto saxophone]] as the youngest member of a black jazz band in Sacramento.&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 169 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  He entered the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he majored in music, studying with, among others, [[Bob Thompson (musician)]], [[Roger Sessions]] and [[Ernest Bloch]].&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 85, 183  (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduation, he studied composition at the [[Juilliard School]] of Music in [[New York City]], only to discover that music was not his calling.&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 220-225 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

He entered graduate school at [[UCLA]], studying philosophy, and then transferred to [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 247 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  As a student there he came under the influence of [[J. L. Austin]], whose teaching and methods "knocked him off ... [his] horse."&lt;ref&gt;The Claim of Reason: Wittgenstein, Skepticism, Morality and Tragedy, xv (New York: Oxford, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954 he was awarded a Junior Fellowship at the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]]. Before completing his Ph.D., he became an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 326 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Cavell's daughter by his first wife (Marcia Cavell), Rachel Lee Cavell, was born in 1957. From 1962–1963 Cavell was a Fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], where he befriended the British philosopher [[Bernard Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 149 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Cavell’s marriage to Marcia ended in divorce in 1961. In 1963 he returned to the Harvard Philosophy Department, where he became the Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value.&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 435 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1964, Cavell joined a group of graduate students, who taught at [[Tougaloo College]], a [[historically black]] college in Mississippi, as part of what became known as the [[Freedom Summer]].&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 373 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; He and Cathleen (Cohen) Cavell were married in 1967. In April 1969, during the student protests (chiefly arising from the [[Vietnam War]]), Cavell, helped by his colleague [[John Rawls]], worked with a group of African-American students to draft language for a vote by the faculty that established the Department of African and African-American Studies at Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;Little Did I Know, 508–512 (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Cavell's first son Benjamin was born. In 1979, along with the documentary filmmaker [[Robert H. Gardner|Robert Gardner]], Cavell helped found the [[Harvard Film Archive]], to preserve and present the history of film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2007novedec/cavell.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Cavell received a [[MacArthur Fellowship]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~phildept/cavell.html]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1996-1997 Cavell was President of the [[American Philosophical Association]] (Eastern Division). In 1984, his second son David was born.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~phildept/cavell.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He remained on the Harvard faculty until his retirement in 1997. After retiring, he taught courses at [[Yale University]] and the [[University of Chicago]]. He also held the Spinoza Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Amsterdam]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uva.nl/en/disciplines/philosophy/home/components-centrecolumn/the-spinoza-chair.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cavell died in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] of [[heart failure]] on June 19, 2018 at the age of 91.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/obituaries/stanley-cavell-prominent-harvard-philosopher-dies-at-91.html|title=Stanley Cavell, Prominent Harvard Philosopher, Dies at 91|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 20, 2018|accessdate=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/bostonglobe/obituary.aspx?n=stanley-cavell&amp;pid=189347645&amp;referrer=0&amp;preview=false Stanley Cavell Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Although trained in the Anglo-American [[analytical philosophy|analytic tradition]], Cavell frequently interacted with the [[continental philosophy|continental tradition]]. He includes [[film]] and [[literary criticism|literary]] study in philosophical inquiry. Cavell writes extensively on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[J. L. Austin]], and [[Martin Heidegger]], as well as on the [[Transcendentalism|American transcendentalists]] [[Henry Thoreau]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]. He interprets Wittgenstein in a fashion known as the [[New Wittgenstein]]. Cavell's writing incorporates autobiographical elements concerning how his movement between and within the ideas of these thinkers influenced and influences his own thinking that impacted spheres in the arts and humanities beyond the technical study of philosophy.

A scholarly journal, the ''Conversations: The Journal of Cavellian Studies'', engages with his philosophical work. It is edited by [[Sérgio Dias Branco]] and Amir Khan and published by the [[University of Ottawa]].

Cavell established his distinct philosophical identity with ''Must We Mean What We Say?'' (1969), which addresses topics such as language use, metaphor, skepticism, tragedy, and literary interpretation, from the point of view of [[ordinary language philosophy]], of which he is a practitioner and ardent defender. One of the essays discusses [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s work on revelation and authority, ''[[The Book on Adler]]'', in an effort to help re-introduce the book to modern philosophical readers.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal of Religion'', vol. 57, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The World Viewed'' (1971) Cavell looks at photography and film. He also covers modernism in art and the nature of media, where he mentions the influence of art critic [[Michael Fried]]'s writing on his work.

Cavell is perhaps best known for his book, ''The Claim of Reason: Wittgenstein, Skepticism, Morality, and Tragedy'' (1979), which forms the centerpiece of his work, and which has its origins in his doctoral dissertation. In ''Pursuits of Happiness'' (1981), Cavell describes his experience of seven prominent Hollywood comedies: ''[[The Lady Eve]]'', ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'', ''[[The Philadelphia Story (film)|The Philadelphia Story]]'', ''[[His Girl Friday]]'', ''[[Adam’s Rib]]'', and ''[[The Awful Truth]]''.  Cavell argues that these films, from the years 1934–1949, form part of what he calls the genre of "[[remarriage|The Comedy of Remarriage]]," and he finds in them great philosophical, moral, and indeed political significance. Specifically, Cavell argues that these Hollywood comedies show that "the achievement of happiness requires not the [...] satisfaction of our needs [...] but the examination and transformation of those needs."&lt;ref&gt;Cavell, ''Pursuits of Happiness'', 1981, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Cavell, the emphasis that these movies place on "[[Comedy of remarriage|remarriage]]" draws attention to the fact that, within a relationship, happiness requires "growing up" together with one's partner.&lt;ref&gt;Cavell, ''Pursuits of Happiness'', 1981, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Cities of Words'' (2004) Cavell traces the history of [[moral perfectionism]], a mode of moral thinking spanning the history of Western philosophy and literature. Having used Emerson to outline the concept, this book suggests ways we might want to understand philosophy, literature, and film as preoccupied with features of perfectionism. In ''Philosophy the Day After Tomorrow'' (2005), a collection of essays, Cavell makes the case that J. L. Austin's concept of [[performative utterance]] requires the supplementary concept of ''passionate utterance'': "A performative utterance is an offer of participation in the order of law. And perhaps we can say: A passionate utterance is an invitation to improvisation in the disorders of desire."&lt;ref&gt;Cavell, ''Philosophy the Day after Tomorrow'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts, &amp; London: Harvard University Press, 2005), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The book also contains extended discussions of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Jane Austen]], [[George Eliot]], [[Henry James]], and [[Fred Astaire]], as well as familiar Cavellian subjects such as [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], Emerson, Thoreau, Wittgenstein, and Heidegger. Cavell's final book, ''Little Did I Know: Excerpts from Memory'' (2010), is an autobiography written in the form of a diary. In a series of consecutive, dated entries, Cavell inquires about the origins of his philosophy by telling the story of his life.

'''Stone Chronicle Museum''' is a museum dedicated to the history of stone plastics in Azerbaijan. Many types of stone plastic are exhibited in the museum. The Stone Chronicle Museum, located on the [[National Flag Square]], was created by the [[Heydar Aliyev Foundation]].&lt;ref name="found"/&gt; The most archaic features of moral life in Azerbaijan were found in [[Plastic arts|plastic]] stone traditions.

==History==
The museum is located in the building of the electric station constructed in 1921 and used for the energy supply of oil wells. In later period, the building was completely restored. After restoration works, it operates as Stone Chronicle Museum.&lt;ref name="lent"&gt;{{cite web|title= Bakıda Daş salnamə muzeyi açıldı|url= http://news.lent.az/news/205224|publisher= news.lent.az|language= az|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="travel"&gt;{{cite web|title= Музей каменной летописи|url= http://azerbaijan.travel/ru/place/46-muzej-kamennoj-letopisi |publisher= azerbaijan.travel|language= ru|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening of the museum took place on June 8, 2015.

[[File:Napoli - Teatro Bellini.jpg|thumb|300px|View of the exterior]]
The '''Teatro Bellini''' (Bellini Theatre) is a private theatre and opera stage located in the centre of [[Naples]] on the Via Vincenzo Bellini at the corner of Via Conte di Ruo. It is across the street from the Academy of Fine Arts of Naples.

The house is named after the Sicilian-born composer, [[Vincenzo Bellini]], who is best known for his [[opera]]s and who spent his some time in the 1820s studying music in the city. In addition, there in an opera house name after him—the [[Teatro Massimo Bellini]]—in [[Catania]], [[Sicily]], his birthplace.

==History==
In 1864, Baron [[Nicola Lacapra Sabelli]] commissioned the theatre's creation from the architect [[Carlo Sorgente]] for the Via Vincenzo Bellini. This theatre, located near Piazza Dante Alighieri, burned down in 1869, and a new one was inaugurated a few hundred feet from the original locale. 
[[File:Regale, Teatro Bellini Napoli.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Interior of theater as it looks today]]
On 6 February 1877 it presented Bellini's opera, ''[[I puritani]]''. The theatre has 6 tiers of box seats surrounding an oval floor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9N3TAAAAMAAJ ''Napoli nobilissima'', Volumes 13-15, page 106.]&lt;/ref&gt; The interior decorations were created by [[Giovanni Ponticelli]], [[Pasquale Di Criscito]], and Vincenzo Paliotti, and the oil portrait of the opera composer was by [[Vincenzo Migliaro]].

For nearly a century, the theatre presented operas and operettas, but by the 1960s it had become dilapidated, used only as a cheap movie theatre, and it was considered for demolition. In 1962 the Bellini hosted its final operatic spectacle with ''[[Masaniello]]'' before being acquired in 1986 by a group led by local artist and producer, [[Tato Russo]]. They restored the house for operatic and theatrical productions which are now frequently presented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teatrobellini.it/la-storia  Teatro Bellini's history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140320071807/http://www.teatrobellini.it/la-storia |date=20 March 2014 }} on teatrobellini.it&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp''''' is a 1632 [[oil painting]] on [[canvas]] by [[Rembrandt]] housed in the [[Mauritshuis]] museum in [[The Hague]], the [[Netherlands]]. The painting is regarded as one of Rembrandt's early masterpieces.

In the work, Dr. [[Nicolaes Tulp]] is pictured explaining the [[muscle|musculature]] of the [[arm]] to medical professionals. Some of the spectators are various doctors who paid [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] to be included in the painting. The painting is signed in the top-left hand corner ''Rembrandt. f[ecit] 1632''. This may be the first instance of Rembrandt signing a painting with his forename (in its original form) as opposed to the monogramme ''RHL'' (Rembrandt Harmenszoon of [[Leiden]]), and is thus a sign of his growing artistic confidence.

== Background ==
The event can be dated to 31 January 1632: the [[Amsterdam]] Guild of [[Surgeon]]s, of which Tulp was official City Anatomist, permitted only one public [[dissection]] a year, and the body would have to be that of an executed criminal.&lt;ref name="Rachlin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rachlin|first=Harvey |title=Scandals, Vandals and Da Vincis|publisher=Chrysalis Books|year=2007|pages=55&amp;ndash;61|isbn=978-1-86105-878-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VoL3-rMmZQC&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anatomy]] lessons were a social event in the 17th century, taking place in lecture rooms that were actual [[theatre]]s, with students, colleagues and the general public being permitted to attend on payment of an entrance fee. The spectators are appropriately dressed for this social occasion. It is thought that the uppermost (not holding the paper) and farthest left figures  were added to the picture later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Delaney|first=Samuel R.|title=Silent Interviews: On Language, Race, Sex, Science Fiction, and Some Comics--A Collection of Written Interviews|year=2011|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, CT|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0alRH-n1SpYC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;dq=%22Adriaan+Adriaanszoon%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rC5nUYumJo31iQKdi4GACQ&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Adriaan%20Adriaanszoon%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every five to ten years, the Surgeon's Guild would commission a portrait by a leading portraitist of the period; Rembrandt was commissioned for this task when he was 26 years old, and newly arrived in Amsterdam. It was his first major commission in Amsterdam. Each of the men included in the portrait would have paid a certain amount of money to be included in the work, and the more central figures (in this case, Dr. Tulp) probably paid more, even twice as much. Rembrandt's anatomical portrait radically altered the conventions of the genre, by including a full length corpse in the center of the image (using Christ-like iconography) and creating not just a portrait but a dramatic [[Mise-en-scène]]. Rembrandt's image is a fiction; in a typical anatomy lesson, the surgeon would begin by opening the chest cavity and thorax because the internal organs there decay most rapidly.

One person is missing: the Preparator, whose task was to prepare the body for the lesson. In the 17th century an important [[scientist]] such as Dr. Tulp would not be involved in menial and bloody work like [[dissection]], and such tasks would be left to others. It is for this reason that the picture shows no cutting instruments. Instead we see in the lower right corner an enormous open [[textbook]] on anatomy, possibly the 1543 ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' (''Fabric of the Human Body'') by [[Vesalius|Andreas Vesalius]].

==The corpse==
The corpse is that of the criminal Aris Kindt (alias of Adriaan Adriaanszoon), who was convicted for armed robbery and sentenced to [[Capital punishment|death]] by [[hanging]]. He was executed earlier on the same day of the scene.&lt;ref name="carnal_art"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Bryan|first=C. Jil|title=Carnal Art |publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2005|pages=64&amp;ndash;67|isbn=978-0-8166-4322-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1KEO_H34EcC&amp;pg=PA64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The face of the corpse is partially shaded,&lt;ref name="Rachlin" /&gt; a suggestion of ''umbra mortis'' (shadow of death), a technique that Rembrandt was to use frequently.

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz-navel.jpg|thumb|200px|The corpse's navel is formed from the letter ''R'']]
The French art historian Jean-Marie Clarke points out that the navel of the corpse has the shape of a capital R and connects this observation to the fact that Rembrandt worked intensively on his signatures in 1632, using three types consecutively before settling on the final, first name form in 1633.&lt;ref&gt;Michiel Koolbergen, "De R van Rembrandt. Waarheen wijst de tang van dokter Tulp?" ''Trouw'', 31 January 1992, 13; this article appeared on the 360th anniversary of the original anatomy lesson by Dr. Tulp. See also, http://www.rembrandt-signature-file.com/remp_texte/remp051.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Kindt was discussed in the 1999 novel ''[[The Rings of Saturn]]'' by [[W. G. Sebald]], and plays a significant role in [[Laird Hunt]]'s 2006 novel ''The Exquisite''. In her 2014 novel, "[http://knopfdoubleday.com/book/234181/the-anatomy-lesson/ The Anatomy Lesson]" author and journalist Nina Siegal tells the life story of Aris Kindt, based on documents about his criminal history that she discovered in the Amsterdam city archives.

Medical specialists have commented on the accuracy of [[muscle]]s and [[tendon]]s painted by the 26-year-old Rembrandt. It is not known where he obtained such knowledge; it is possible that he copied the details from an anatomical textbook. However, in 2006 Dutch researchers recreated the scene with a male cadaver, revealing several discrepancies of the exposed left forearm compared to that of a real corpse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=IJpma |title=The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt (1632): A Comparison of the Painting With a Dissected Left Forearm of a Dutch Male Cadaver |journal=J Hand Surg [Am] |year=2006 |volume=31 |issue=6 |pages=882–891 |url=http://www.handsurg.eu/resources/rembrandt_en.pdf |doi=10.1016/j.jhsa.2006.02.014 |first4=Marcel F. |last4=Meek |first3=Jean-Philippe A. |last3=Nicolai |first2=Robert C. |last2=Van De Graaf |first1=Frank F.A. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926154457/http://www.handsurg.eu/resources/rembrandt_en.pdf |archivedate=26 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17225789 | volume=150 | issue=50 | title=[The anatomy lesson of Dr Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt (1632) and the findings during dissection of the forearm of a cadaver: anatomical discrepancies] | author=IJpma FF, van de Graaf RC, Nicolai JP, Meek MF | journal=Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd | pages=2756–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surgically astute will notice that the origin of the exposed forearm muscles would seem to indicate that the flexor compartment originates at the [[Lateral epicondyle of the humerus|lateral epicondyle]], when it is, in fact, the [[Medial epicondyle of the humerus|medial epicondyle]].  It is the common extensor origin that originates at the lateral epicondyle.

In a 2007 study, the American artist and anatomist David J. Jackowe and his colleagues demonstrated that the mysterious white cord that courses along the ulnar aspect of the cadaver's carpus and little finger, long thought to be either an ulnar nerve variant or artistic error, is most likely the tendon of an anomalous forearm muscle, the accessory abductor digiti minimi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jackowe DJ, Moore MK, Bruner AE, Fredieu JR | date = Nov 2007 | title = New insight into the enigmatic white cord in Rembrandt's The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp (1632) | url = | journal = J Hand Surg Am. | volume = 32 | issue = 9| pages = 1471–6 | doi=10.1016/j.jhsa.2007.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deijman was Tulp's immediate successor in the post of ''praelector chirugic et anatomie''. The painting was damaged by fire in 1723, and only a central fragment survives.

Around 1856 [[Édouard Manet]] visited The Hague and made a small [[oil sketch|oil on panel]] copy of ''The Anatomy Lesson''.

The 2012 painting ''The Anatomy Lesson of Dr Freeman''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.drawingonanatomy.com.au See ''Drawing on Anatomy'' website (retrieved 16 December 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Susan Dorothea White]] references the Rembrandt composition but renders each of the onlookers as an anatomical [[prosection]] and skeleton in a contemporary university laboratory; the enormous book is replaced by a computer screen and the background chart by a projection screen; the tendon orientation in the cadaver's left forearm is corrected.

==In popular culture==
In ''[[Asterix and the Soothsayer]]'' (1972), [[Albert Uderzo|Uderzo]] and [[René Goscinny|Goscinny]] referenced the painting at the bottom of page 10, where the characters observe the disembowelment of a fish.

The 2011 video game ''[[Deus Ex: Human Revolution]]'' references the painting in both in-game portraits that can be found on the wall and in a certain cinematic trailer, featuring the main protagonist Adam Jensen as the cadaver as Dr. Nicolaes and his students study his charred and ruined arms, which in the actual story become amputated and replaced with mechanical limbs.

The painting is discussed by the narrator (a young man)  and his mother during a visit to the Met in [[The Goldfinch (novel)|''The Goldfinch'']], a 2013 novel by [[Donna Tartt]].

In the 2012 German film [[Barbara (2012 film)|''Barbara'']], there is a scene in which a doctor offers his interpretation of the painting to a colleague (the protagonist) when she points out the inaccuracy of Aris Kindt's left hand.

2014's ''The Anatomy Lesson'' by Nina Siegal is a fictionalized account of the painting's creation and backstory, based on six years of historical research and archival documents about Aris Kindt's life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6908">'''''The Journal of John Woolman''''' is an autobiography by [[John Woolman]] which was published posthumously in 1774 by Joseph Crukshank, a Philadelphia [[Quaker]] printer. Woolman's journal is one of the longest continually published books in North America since it has never been out of print.

The Journal adds to his other published works and gives greater evidence to his character as he discusses ideas of anti-slavery and anti-materialism as well as discussing power's ability to corrupt. The work also discusses God's divine power and goodness for all on the earth. 

The work has remained in print due to its focus on making life simple and the hopeful message of God's divine goodness.  Woolman is one of the first early American writers besides [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] who is a not a Puritan. Puritans were the most prevalent writers in Early America, and it was during the time of this publication that writing began to move away from being by only Puritan authors. Woolman's writing is at the forefront of this transition.

== Anti-Slavery ==

=== Slavery ===
Woolman's Journal focuses much on his decision to support [[anti-slavery]]. The struggle is first seen when he discusses how he was required to write a bill of sale for a Quaker friend who had sold a slave. He completed the bill of sale because it was part of his job and the man that sold the slave was also a Quaker however, after this even Woolman took a more official stance in regard to his opinion, even explaining during the actual event that he "believed slavekeeping to be a practice inconsistent with the Christian religion."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anthology of American literature|last=McMichael|first=George|last2=Leonard|first2=James|publisher=Longman|year=2011|isbn=9780205779390|edition=10|location=Boston|pages=293-301|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His journal shows his inner turmoil as he grapples with understanding how he truly feels about the selling and buying of slaves that eventually led to publishing works such as his ''[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/evans/N05781.0001.001/1:3?rgn=div1;view=fulltext Some Considerations on the Keeping of Negroes].''  

Slavery is prominent in Woolman's journal, and it returns again shortly after the scene with the bill of sale as he discusses further opinions he has on the subject. He takes time to discuss those who he visited that did not take care of their slaves and how that made him feel uncomfortable while visiting. In contrast, Woolman discusses individuals who did take care of their slaves and how that made him feel more at ease. Shortly after that comparison, Woolman moves beyond the treatment of slaves and reflects on the idea that even if slaves were well cared for, they were still taken from their homes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His continual discourse on slavery in his journal makes Woolman one of the first abolitionists.

=== Power ===
Woolman addresses one of the issues of slavery to be men having too much power: "men having power too often misapplied it...we made slaves of the Negroes and the Turks made slaves of the Christians."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is an idea already a large part of American heritage as many who traveled to America were seeking freedom of some kind. Woolman's focus on how power corrupts will continue to be impactful as Americans push further away from England (which is what had been occurring when Joseph Crukshank published this journal). 

== God's Divine Goodness ==
=== Quakers and Puritans ===
Woolman spends time in his journal writing about his relationship with God and his perspective on God. He discusses that as early as the age of 7 he "began to be acquainted with the operations of divine love."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His perspective on God and God's love is important, as it offers clear contrasts from the opinions that [[Puritans|Puritans had]]. Puritans believed in a less tolerable God, and as Jonathan Edwards in ''[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1053&amp;context=etas Sinners in the Hands of An Angry God]'' suggests, a God who does not care for those on Earth, nearly as much as Woolman suggests. Woolman's journal speaks of a God who gives revelation and creates a feeling of sweetness as well as strong feelings of mercy. 

=== Tolerance ===
The opinion on God's love and his strong mercy is what makes Woolman and other Quakers more tolerant to others. Woolman writes: "I found no narrowness respecting sects and opinions, but believed that sincere, upright-hearted people in every Society who truly loved God were accepted of him."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is a very different belief from those of other major religions in American at the time. The Puritans were very intolerant, even within their own ranks--intolerance is one of the causes of the [[Salem witch trials|Salem Witch Trials]]. Quakers' differing opinion on God is also what brings about a major dislike of Quakers by Puritans. They could not stand the opinions of Quakers and considered it a type of religious heresy.&lt;ref&gt;Crisler, Jesse. Brigham Young University Class Lecture, 12 October 2016, Joseph Fielding Smith Building, Provo, UT.&lt;/ref&gt; Woolman does not discuss this in his Journal, instead focusing on what he knows and believes. In fact, Woolman believes that tolerance and mercy towards others were given from God: "he whose tender mercies are over all his works hath placed a principle in the human mind which incites to exercise goodness towards every living creature." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

These kinds of connections involving tolerance and mercy towards other people are what makes Woolman's writings easier to connect with. He appears more real and sincere because of his tolerance towards others. Christians now connect with his opinions on mercy, and this is part of the reason he has remained in print since the first publication of his journal.

== Anti-Materialism ==
Woolman did many things in his life, varying from merchant, to tailor, to Quaker preacher. Along this path he decided that his wealth and prosperity were hurting him and his relationship with God: "the increase became my burden."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He turned away from all his merchandise and placed his focus somewhere else, no longer even desiring it.  

This aspect of Woolman's writing moves beyond Quaker ideals. It is something that contains aspects of Americanism, also portrayed in later authors like [[Henry David Thoreau|Henry Thoreau]] as well as [[Walt Whitman]]. He in some ways follows [[transcendentalism]]. 

Woolman seems to believe in the importance of anti-mercantilism, as following his decision to forgo his wealth he becomes much more visionary and believes to become closer to God.

'''''The Structure of Science: Problems in the Logic of Scientific Explanation''''' is a 1961 book about the [[philosophy of science]] by the philosopher [[Ernest Nagel]]. The book is considered a classic discussion of its subject, though its approach has been seen as outdated.

==Summary==
{{expand section|date=October 2018}}
Nagel discusses branches of science such as [[physics]].{{sfn|Nagel|1961|page=336}}

==Publication history==
''The Structure of Science'' was first published by [[Harcourt (publisher)|Harcourt, Brace &amp; World]] in 1961. It was reprinted in 1979 by [[Hackett Publishing Company]].

==Reception==
===Mainstream media===
''The Structure of Science'' received a mixed review from the philosopher [[Raziel Abelson]] in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]''.{{sfn|Ableson|1961}} The book was also reviewed by the philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]] in ''[[Scientific American]]'' and William Gilman in ''[[The Nation]]''.{{sfn|Ayer|1961|page=197}}{{sfn|Gilman|1961|pages=503–504}}

Ableson considered the book's publication an important event in American philosophy. He credited Nagel with consolidating the rival insights of [[logical positivism]] and [[pragmatism]], demonstrating how four different kinds of explanation function in different types of inquiry, refuting the view that science does nothing more than describe "sequences of phenomena", and convincingly criticizing Berlin. However, he argued that Nagel's account of science was strained and that some of Nagel's views were unclear. He believed that Nagel was less successful in discussing sociology and history than he was in discussing the natural sciences. He also charged Nagel with vacillating between the "mechanistic" view of social knowledge and that of "pragmatic pluralism", arguing that each of these perspectives has merit, but only when adopted with full commitment.{{sfn|Ableson|1961}}

===Scientific and academic journals===
''The Structure of Science'' was reviewed by G. B. Keene in ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'' and the philosopher [[Paul Feyerabend]] in the ''[[British Journal for the Philosophy of Science]]''.{{sfn|Keene|1962|pages=372–374}}{{sfn|Feyerabend|1966|pages=237–249}} The book was also discussed by Colin Klein in ''[[The Philosophical Quarterly]]'',{{sfn|Klein|2009|pages=39–53}} Grażyna Musiał in the ''Journal of Economics &amp; Management'',{{sfn|Musiał|2011|pages=73–86}} and the philosopher [[Kenneth F. Schaffner]] in ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]''.{{sfn|Schaffner|2012|pages=516–566}}

Klein wrote that discussions of the role of reduction in scientific explanation published after the book moved away from Nagel's views, because of "perceived shortcomings in Nagel’s theory of reduction." He argued that the trend away from Nagel's views has been a mistake. In his view, while "Nagel’s account of reduction has a number of flaws" Nagel's "account of intertheoretic connection is largely correct."{{sfn|Klein|2009|pages=39–53}} Musiał wrote that the book is "a source of inspiring conclusions" and is regarded as one of the "fundamental works on the contemporary methodology of science." She added that Nagel's conception of scientific theories is "considered classical and as such, worth of detailed analysis" and that Nagel's "position left numerous opened questions that were further developed" by other authors, and concluded that Nagel's book is "still a valuable reading for junior
research workers in economics who wish to reinforce their knowledge."{{sfn|Musiał|2011|pages=73–86}} Schaffner noted that "Nagel's theory is based on the reduction of classical thermodynamics to statistical mechanics" and that criticisms of his theory "are based on the application of the reductionist mode of thinking to genetics, statistics and the concept of multiple realizability".{{sfn|Schaffner|2012|pages=516–566}}

===Evaluations in books===
The philosopher [[Adolf Grünbaum]] criticized Nagel for misinterpreting the philosopher of science [[Henri Poincaré]] in ''[[Philosophical Problems of Space and Time]]'' (1973).{{sfn|Grünbaum|1974|page=91}} The philosopher [[Douglas Hofstadter]] described Nagel's book as a classic in the philosophy of science in ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'' (1979). He praised it for Nagel's discussions of reductionism and holism and teleological and non-telological explanations.{{sfn|Hofstadter|1980|page=752}} The historian [[Peter Gay]] praised ''The Structure of Science'' as an important book and a clear exposition of positivism in ''Style in History'' (1974). He credited Nagel with refuting opposing points of view.{{sfn|Gay|1988|page=237}} Gay wrote in ''Reading Freud'' (1990) that Nagel's work is a book on which "many of us grew up", and that it "remains valuable". He noted that while Nagel was "no Freudian", the closing sentence of ''The Structure of Science'' paraphrases the famous last paragraph of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''[[The Future of an Illusion]]'' (1927).{{sfn|Gay|1990|page=187}}

The philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] praised Nagel's discussion of the "dispute over the nature of theories and theoretical terms" in ''Modern Philosophy: An Introduction and Survey'' (1994).{{sfn|Scruton|1997|page=535}} The philosopher [[Isaac Levi]] described ''The Structure of Science'' as a well-known classic in its field in ''[[The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy]]'' (1999).{{sfn|Levi|1999|page=595}} The philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] described ''The Structure of Science'' as Nagel's "definitive work" in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' (2005). However, he maintained that [[Thomas S. Kuhn]]'s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962) discredited Nagel's approach to the philosophy of science.{{sfn|Ruse|2005|page=637}}

"'''The Ugly Duckling'''" ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''Den grimme ælling'') is a literary [[fairy tale]] by Danish poet and author [[Hans Christian Andersen]] (1805&amp;ndash;1875). The story tells of a homely little bird born in a barnyard who suffers abuse from the others around him until, much to his delight (and to the surprise of others), he matures into a beautiful [[swan]], the most beautiful bird of all. The story is beloved around the world as a tale about personal transformation for the better.&lt;ref name="Tatar"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tatar |first=Maria |title=The Annotated Hans Christian Andersen |publisher=W.. Norton &amp; Company |year=2008 |pages=99&amp;ndash;118}}&lt;/ref&gt; “The Ugly Duckling” was first published 11 November 1843, with three other tales by Andersen in Copenhagen, Denmark to great critical acclaim. The tale has been adapted to various media including opera, musical, and animated film. The tale is completely Andersen's invention and owes no debt to fairy tales or folklore.

==Plot summary==

When the story begins, a mother duck's eggs hatch. One of the little birds is perceived by the other birds and animals on the farm as a homely little creature and suffers much verbal and physical abuse from them. He wanders sadly from the barnyard and lives with wild ducks and geese until hunters slaughter the flocks. He finds a home with an old woman, but her cat and hen tease and taunt him mercilessly and once again he sets off alone.

The duckling sees a flock of migrating wild swans. He is delighted and excited, but he cannot join them, for he is too young and cannot fly. Winter arrives. A farmer finds and carries the freezing little duckling home, but the foundling is frightened by the farmer’s noisy children and flees the house. He spends a miserable winter alone in the outdoors, mostly hiding in a cave on the lake that partly freezes over. When spring arrives, a flock of swans descends on the lake.

The ugly duckling, now having fully grown and matured, is unable to endure a life of solitude and hardship any more and decides to throw himself at the flock of swans deciding that it is better to be killed by such beautiful birds than to live a life of ugliness and misery. He is shocked when the swans welcome and accept him, only to realize by looking at his reflection in the water that he has grown into one of them. The flock takes to the air, and the now beautiful swan spreads his gorgeous large wings and takes flight with the rest of his new kind family.

==Composition and publication history==
Andersen first conceived the story in 1842 while enjoying the beauty of nature during his stay at the country estate of Bregentved, and lavished a year's worth of attention upon it. He initially considered "The Young Swans" as the tale's title but, not wanting to spoil the element of surprise in the protagonist’s transformation, discarded it for "The Ugly Duckling". He later confessed that the story was "a reflection of my own life", and, when the critic Georg Brandes questioned Andersen about whether he would write his autobiography, the poet claimed that it had already been written — "The Ugly Duckling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Elias |last=Bredsdorff |title=Hans Christian Andersen: The Story of his Life and Work 1805-75 |publisher=Phaidon |year=1975 |isbn=0-7148-1636-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“The Ugly Duckling” was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark 11 November 1843 in ''[[New Fairy Tales (1844)|New Fairy Tales. First Book. First Collection. 1844. (Nye Eventyr. Første Bind. Første Samling. 1844.)]]''. For the first time the phrase "told for children" was not part of the title&amp;mdash;an omission Andersen scholar Jackie Wullschlager believes exhibited a new confidence on Andersen's part: "These [tales] were the most mature and perfectly constructed tales he had written, and though some of them at once became, and have remained, favorites of children, Andersen here melds together the childlike and the profound with exceptional artistry." The first edition of 850 was sold out by December 18, and Reitzel planned another 850.&lt;ref name="Wullschlager"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wullschlager |first=Jackie |title=Hans Christian Andersen: The Life of a Storyteller |publisher=University of Chicago Press |date=2002, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale was fourth and last in the volume that included (in contents order), "[[The Angel (fairy tale)|The Angel]]" ("Englen"), "[[The Nightingale (fairy tale)|The Nightingale]]" ("Nattergalen"), and "[[The Sweethearts; or, The Top and the Ball]]" ("Kjærestefolkene [Toppen og bolden]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/rundtom/faq/index_e.html?emne=bogudg |publisher=Hans Christian Andersen Center |title=Hans Christian Andersen - FAQ: Books by Hans Christian Andersen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volume sold out almost immediately and Andersen wrote on December 18, 1843: “The book is selling like hot cakes. All the papers are praising it, everyone is reading it! No books of mine are appreciated in the way these fairy tales are!”&lt;ref name="Tatar" /&gt; Andersen promoted the tale by reading it aloud at social gatherings. The tale was republished 18 December 1849 in ''Fairy Tales. 1850. (Eventyr. 1850.)'' and again 15 December 1862 in ''Fairy Tales and Stories. First Volume. 1862. (Eventyr og Historier. Første Bind. 1862.)''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/register/info_e.html?vid=66 |publisher=Hans Christian Andersen Center |title=Hans Christian Andersen: The Ugly Duckling}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tale has since been translated into various languages and published around the world and has become the most famous story by Andersen.

==Commentaries and criticism==
[[File:Mute Swan Cygnets detail.jpg|thumb|left|A pair of young [[swan]]s (or cygnets)]]
In reviewing ''Hans Christian Andersen: A New Life'' by biographer Jens Andersen, British journalist Anne Chisholm writes “Andersen himself was a tall, ugly boy with a big nose and big feet, and when he grew up with a beautiful singing voice and a passion for the theater he was cruelly teased and mocked by other children". The ugly duckling is the child of a swan whose egg accidentally rolled into a duck's nest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/06/05/boand05.xml |title=The tale of an ugly duckling |first=Anne |last=Chisholm |date=2006-06-05 |publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation suggests that Andersen was the illegitimate son of Prince Christian Frederik (later King [[Christian VIII of Denmark]]), and found this out some time before he wrote the book, and then that being a swan in the story was a metaphor not just for inner beauty and talent but also for secret royal lineage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article409116.ece |title=The Little Prince |first=Neil |last=Philip |date=2005-01-08 |publisher=''[[The Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bruno Bettelheim]] observes in ''[[The Uses of Enchantment]]'' that the Ugly Duckling is not confronted with the tasks, tests, or trials of the typical fairy tale hero. “No need to accomplish anything is expressed in “The Ugly Duckling”. Things are simply fated and unfold accordingly, whether or not the hero takes some action.” In conjunction with Bettelheim’s assessment, [[Maria Tatar]] notes  in ’’The Annotated Hans Christian Andersen’’ that Andersen suggests that the Ugly Duckling‘s superiority resides in the fact that he is of a breed different from the barnyard rabble, and that dignity and worth, moral and aesthetic superiority are determined by nature rather than accomplishment.&lt;ref name="Tatar" /&gt;

According to Carole Rosen, the story was inspired in part by Andersen's friend [[Jenny Lind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosen |first=Carole |editor1-last=Matthew |editor1-first=H. C. G. |editor2-last=Harrison |editor2-first=Brian |title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |chapter=Lind, Jenny (1820–1887) |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/16671 |accessdate=April 1, 2014 |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0198614111 |quote=[Lind] inspired at least partly two of his best-known children's stories, '''The Ugly Duckling'' and '''The Emperor's Nightingale'' [sic]...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
[[File:Sillysymphonies-uglyducking1931.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Disney's 1931 version]]
[[File:Sillysymphonies-uglyducking1939.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Disney's 1939 version]]
"The Ugly Duckling" became one of Andersen's best loved tales and was reprinted around the world. The tale was adapted to a variety of media. Films based on the tale include two ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' animated shorts produced by Walt Disney called ''[[The Ugly Duckling (1939 film)|The Ugly Duckling]]''. The first was produced in 1931 in black and white, and a remake in 1939 in [[Technicolor]]. The latter film won the 1939 [[Academy Award for Animated Short Film|Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intanibase.com/shorts.aspx?shortID=288&amp;studioID=1 |title=The 1939 Silly Symphony |publisher=The Internet Animation Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the last Silly Symphony to be made. The main difference between the Andersen story and the Disney version is that, in the latter, the little bird's ordeal lasts for only a few minutes, not for months. In 1936, the Fleischer brothers adapted the story for their animated short "The Little Stranger", reversing the story by having an odd chick born into a family of ducks. In 1956 the Soviet animation studio [[Soyuzmultfilm]] produced its own 19 minutes version of The Ugly Duckling.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.animator.ru/db/?ver=eng&amp;p=show_film&amp;fid=3072 The Ugly Duckling]'' at [[Animator.ru]]&lt;/ref&gt; The anime ''[[Princess Tutu]]'' is about a duck that turns into a swan-like ballerina. In 2006, the Danish animation studio [[A. Film]] produced a spin-off CG feature called ''[[The Ugly Duckling and Me!]]'', and later produced a children's CG television series ''Ugly Duckling Junior'' which featured the same characters as the movie. The 1954 [[Tom and Jerry]] cartoon ''[[Downhearted Duckling]]'' is also based on the famous story.

The tale has seen various musical adaptations. In 1914, the Russian composer [[Sergei Prokofiev]] composed a work for voice and piano based on Nina Meshcherskaya's adaptation of the tale and, in 1932, arranged the work for voice and orchestra. This was transcribed by Lev Konov in 1996, and his opera was a great success in Russia. Other musical versions include the song “The Ugly Duckling” composed by [[Frank Loesser]] and sung by [[Danny Kaye]] for the 1952 [[Charles Vidor]] [[musical film]] ''[[Hans Christian Andersen (film)|Hans Christian Andersen]]'', and  ''[[Honk!]]'', a musical based on the tale which was produced in Britain and won an [[Olivier Award]]. The tale was adapted to a musical by Gail Deschamps and Paul Hamilton with a planned United States tour 2002-2003. In 1998, the musical played the Piccolo Spoleto for seventeen days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmtproductions.com/p-duckling.htm |title=GMT: The Ugly Duckling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, [[Jerry Pinkney]] [[The Ugly Duckling (Pinkney book)|adapted the story]] as a children's picture book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/ugly-duckling/oclc/39051276&amp;referer=brief_results |title=The ugly duckling |website=worldcat.org |publisher=Online Computer Library Center |accessdate=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Dance Theatre]] of [[Bradenton, Florida]], presented the ballet version of the popular tale (Allison Norton: The Ugly Duckling).

In 2010, [[Garri Bardin]] directed a feature-length [[stop-motion]] [[musical film|musical]] of the story set to [[Music of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky#Ballets|Tchaikovsky's ballet music]].

In 2012, a musical adaptation of the story, with ten original songs, was released by JJ’s Tunes &amp; Tales.  The album, titled “The Ugly Duckling: Story with Songs” contains both songs and spoken narration, and was released independently on [[CD Baby]] and [[iTunes]].  Examples of song titles include:  Hatching of the Eggs; A Better Place; Song of the Swans; What’s the Matter with You; It’s a Big, Big World; Pretty Good Place to Live.

''GivingTales'' – in 2015 a storytelling app for children was created in aid of Unicef. The Ugly Duckling read by [[Stephen Fry]] is included in this collection of fairy tales along with other stories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1306">'''"The Woman Who Had No Shadow"''' is a Scandinavian fairy tale, included by Sven Grundtvig in ''Gamle danske Minder i Folkemunde'' and Ella Ohlson in ''Sagor från Ångermanland''.&lt;ref name="redeem"&gt;D. L. Ashliman, "[http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0756.html Forgiveness and Redemption: folktales of Aarne-Thompson types 755 and 756]"&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[Aarne–Thompson classification systems|Aarne-Thompson]] type 755, Sin and grace.&lt;ref name="redeem"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
A woman, wishing to have no children, threw rocks into a well at a witch's direction.  Thereafter, she had no shadow.  Her husband, the parson, demanded to know why and threw her out, saying that their slate roof would blossom with flowers before she was forgiven.  One day, a beggar woman sought refuge there; she died in the night, the parson recognized her as his wife, and the housekeeper called him out to see how the roof had bloomed with flowers.

==Motifs==
The legend of ''[[Tannhäuser]]'' features the same growth as evidence of miraculous forgiveness.&lt;ref name="redeem"/&gt;

==Adaptations==
''[[Die Frau ohne Schatten]]'' by Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Richard Strauss is loosely based on this tale.&lt;ref name="redeem"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
The documentary miniseries follows "award-winning architect Piers Taylor and actress and property enthusiast Caroline Quentin explore a range of incredible architect-designed houses in extreme locations around the world. Whether built into the side of a cliff, nestled in a forest, perched at the top of a mountain or hidden under the earth, these homes connect to their environments in a spectacular way. Each episode is themed according to the houses environments — Coast, Forest, Mountain and Underground — with Piers and Caroline traveling to locations ranging from North America to Australasia and Europe. To explore how these dramatic designs function both as works of architecture and as real houses, they stay overnight, eat meals and spend time in the homes."&lt;ref name="flixable"&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Most Extraordinary Homes (2017) - Netflix {{!}} Flixable|url=https://flixable.com/title/80213025/|website=flixable.com|accessdate=13 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WBITVP Finished Catalogue 2017|url=https://wbproductions.box.com/shared/static/skntuwfpldn045wc41hxwlzqnwvddgla.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Company management''' in a [[theatre]] or a travelling company entails all of the travelling, accommodation and day-to-day needs of the acting, design and technical company members. In [[Regional theatre in the United States|regional theatre]]s it often includes renting [[apartments]] and hotel rooms, booking airline tickets, orchestrating furnishings and cleanings for rented apartments, and dealing with any special needs and requests. Company managers will also often coordinate auditions and aid in contracting actors and creatives.

In a travelling company the company manager also arranges for travel and housing, but might also travel with the production. In most local or regional theaters the company manager takes on the job of being the liaison to the actors. The company manager is not only the direct point of contact of any questions the actors might have but he or she is the direct contact from the management team to the actors.

In traveling shows or festivals the company manager might be responsible for all staff issues, such as: travel arrangements and meals for not only the actors but for the entire staff.  But in theaters such as Broadway or regional theaters where actors are stationary for a longer run; the company manager takes on the actors and the production manager deals with the tech crew.

[[File:ColorHug2 - 03.jpg|thumb|Color calibration of a monitor using ColorHug2, an open source colorimeter, placed on the screen.]]
A '''Tristimulus colorimeter''', colloquially shortened to colorimeter, is used in [[digital imaging]], to profile and calibrate output devices.
It takes a limited number of wideband spectral energy readings along the [[visible spectrum]] by using [[optical filter|filtered]] [[photodetector]]s; e.g. [[silicon photodiode]]s.&lt;ref name=schanda&gt;{{cite book|last=Schanda|first=János|author2=George Eppeldauer |author3=Georg Sauter |title=Colorimetry: Understanding the CIE System|publisher=[[Wiley Interscience]]|date=2007|isbn=978-0-470-04904-4|chapter=Tristimulus Color Measurement of Self-Luminous Sources|doi=10.1002/9780470175637.ch6|editor=János Schanda}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A colorimeter with the known value of absolute error allows measuring (x,y)-chromaticity coordinates in red, green, blue and white colors. Measured values are used for calculation of LCD profile coefficients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ntv.ifmo.ru/en/article/13462/metod_programmnoy_kompensaciitehnologicheskogo_razbrosa_koordinat_cvetnostizhidkokristallicheskih_paneley.htm|title=Method of software-based compensation of technological variation in chromaticity coordinates of LCD panels|author=Zharinov I.O., Zharinov O.O.|journal=Scientific and Technical Journal of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics|volume=15|issue=3|pages=387–397|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, three glass filters whose [[transmittance]] spectra mimicked the [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE]] [[color matching function]]s (shown below) were employed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Photoelectric tristimulus colorimetry with three filters|journal=[[JOSA]]|first=Richard Sewall|last=Hunter|date=September 1942|volume=32|issue=9|pages=509–538| url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-32-9-509|doi=10.1364/JOSA.32.000509}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[filter bank]] may be used to decompose the individual color matching functions if more accuracy is desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/103/6/j36epp.pdf|format=PDF|title=Spectral Response Based Calibration Method of Tristimulus Colorimeters|first=George|last=Eppeldauer|journal=Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology|volume=103|issue=6|date=Nov–Dec 1998|pages=615–619|doi=10.6028/jres.103.040|pmid=28009362|pmc=4890952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A camera or colorimeter is said to be ''colorimetric'' if it satisfies the {{Interlanguage link multi|Luther condition|de|3=Luther-Bedingung}} by {{Interlanguage link multi|Robert Thomas Dietrich Luther{{!}}Robert Luther|de|3=Robert Thomas Dietrich Luther}} (1868–1945)&lt;!-- 1868-01-02 (21.

A colorimeter or a digital camera with a [[color filter array]] can, under certain conditions, be used as an alternative to a [[spectrophotometer]].&lt;ref name=Imai1999&gt;{{cite journal | author = Imai, Francisco H. |author2=Berns, Roy S.  | date = 1999 | title = Spectral estimation using trichromatic digital cameras | journal = Proceedings of the International Symposium on Multispectral Imaging and Color Reproduction for Digital Archives | volume = 42 | url = http://www.cis.rit.edu/research/mcsl2/online/Spectral/TechnicalPapers/SpecEstimRGBCamera_Chiba99.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Solli2004&gt;{{cite journal | last = Solli | first = Martin |date=16 December 2004 | title = Filter characterization in digital cameras | url = http://www.diva-portal.org/diva/getDocument?urn_nbn_se_liu_diva-2667-1__fulltext.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2008-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[standard illuminant|illuminant]] and [[CIE 1931 color space#CIE standard observer|observer conditions]] should be specified when citing a measurement (e.g. [[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]]/10°).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oEsZiCt5VOAC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=%22tristimulus+colorimeter%22+OR+spectrocolorimeter#PPA41,M1|title=The Colour Image Processing Handbook|first=Stephen J.|last=Sangwine|author2=Horne |author3=Robin E. N. |page=41|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|date=1998|isbn=0-412-80620-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of a colorimeter may be assessed using the means in CIE publication 179:2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Methods for characterising tristimulus colorimeters for measuring the colour of light|author=CIE TC 2-16 "Characterization of the Performance of Tristimulus Colorimeters"|isbn=978-3-901906-60-2|series=Publication 179:2007|date=2007|url=http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/179-07.html|publisher=CIE Central Bureau|location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;
