'''Aluminium dross''', a byproduct of the [[aluminium smelting]] process, can be mechanically recycled to separate the residual [[aluminium]] metal from the [[aluminium oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imp.mtu.edu/jmmce/issue5-1/P47-62.pdf |title=Institute of Materials Processing (IMP) &amp;#124; Materials Science &amp; Engineering |publisher=Imp.mtu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.azom.com/news.aspx?newsID=30991 |title=Taha Opens Dross Recycling Facility in New Zealand |publisher=Azom.com |date=2011-10-26 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermo-mechanical metal extraction==
The mechanical process of [[recycling]] does not use any toxic chemicals previously used in the process of extracting the valuable aluminium in the dross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waste-management-world.com/index/display/article-display.articles.waste-management-world.recycling.2011.10b.Aluminium_Dross_Recycled_into_Fertilizer_in_New_Zealand.QP129867.dcmp=rss.page=1.html |title=New Aluminium Dross Recycling Facility in New Zealand |publisher=Waste Management World |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2014-06-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530115618/http://www.waste-management-world.com/index/display/article-display.articles.waste-management-world.recycling.2011.10b.Aluminium_Dross_Recycled_into_Fertilizer_in_New_Zealand.QP129867.dcmp=rss.page=1.html |archive-date=2012-05-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hot dross processing]] system whereby the majority of metal is recovered without chemically reducing the aluminium oxides. The [[dross]] is first crushed then separated into aluminium metal rich particles and aluminium oxide rich particles based on density. The metal rich particles are then melted in a furnace to remove the remaining oxide particles.

==Mechanical extraction vs chemical==
Recycling aluminium dross mechanically is an environmentally sensitive method, and is not toxic. This is completely different from how aluminium metal used to be extracted from dross using an array of hazardous chemicals which resulted in a concentrated highly toxic '[[salt cake]]' residue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dross Processing |publisher=Archive.is |date=2006-09-26 |accessdate=2014-06-09 |url=http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/pdf/10.1201/9781420006247.ch13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products that can be made with the residual==
A variety of products can be made from the residual aluminium dross after it is recycled into aluminium oxide. See more information on aluminium oxide.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[[Aluminium oxide]]&lt;/ref&gt; Aluminium oxide has a variety of industrial uses which includes being used in [[paint]], [[dye]], [[concrete]], [[explosives]], and [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aluminumsulfate.net/Aluminum-Oxide.html |title=Aluminum Oxide |publisher=Aluminumsulfate.net |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf [[Thermite]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dross recycling is different==
Aluminium dross recycling is a completely different process to strictly [[aluminium recycling]]. Aluminium recycling is where pure aluminium metal products (previously used in another form) are re-melted into aluminium [[ingot]]s and then re-used to new aluminium products.&lt;ref&gt;cf [[Aluminium recycling]]&lt;/ref&gt; While aluminium dross recycling is where the dross, a byproduct of the smelting process in the creation of aluminium from [[bauxite]], can be mechanically recycled thus separating the residual aluminium metal from the aluminium oxide.&lt;ref&gt;http://nzic.org.nz/ChemProcesses/metals/8D.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arousal''' is the [[physiology|physiological]] and [[psychology|psychological]] state of being awoken or of [[Five senses|sense]] organs stimulated to a point of perception. It involves activation of the [[ascending reticular activating system]] (ARAS) in the [[human brain|brain]], which mediates wakefulness, the [[autonomic nervous system]], and the [[endocrine system]], leading to increased heart rate and blood pressure and a condition of sensory alertness, mobility, and readiness to respond.

Arousal is mediated by several different neural systems. Wakefulness is regulated by the ARAS, which is composed of projections from five major neurotransmitter systems that originate in the [[brainstem]] and form connections extending throughout the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]]; activity within the ARAS is regulated by neurons that release the [[neurotransmitter]]s [[acetylcholine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]], [[histamine]], and [[serotonin]]. Activation of these neurons produces an increase in cortical activity and subsequently alertness.

Arousal is important in regulating [[consciousness]], [[attention]], [[alertness]], and [[information processing]]. It is crucial for [[motivation|motivating]] certain behaviours, such as mobility, the pursuit of nutrition, the [[fight-or-flight response]] and [[sexual behaviour|sexual activity]] (the arousal phase of [[Masters and Johnson]]'s [[human sexual response cycle]]). It is also important in [[emotion]] and has been included in theories such as the [[James-Lange theory of emotion]]. According to [[Hans Eysenck]], differences in baseline arousal level lead people to be [[Extraversion and introversion|extraverts or introverts]].

The [[Yerkes-Dodson law]] states that an optimal level of arousal for performance exists, and too little or too much arousal can adversely affect task performance. One interpretation of the Yerkes-Dodson Law is the Easterbrook cue-utilisation hypothesis. Easterbrook states that an increase of arousal decreases the number of cues that can be used.

Wakefulness is regulated by the [[ascending reticular activating system]], which is composed of five major [[neurotransmitter system]]s – the [[acetylcholine]], [[norepinephrine]], [[dopamine]], [[histamine]], and [[serotonin]] systems – that originate in the [[brainstem]] and form connections which extend throughout the [[cerebral cortex]].&lt;ref name="ARAS"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwańczuk W, Guźniczak P | title = Neurophysiological foundations of sleep, arousal, awareness and consciousness phenomena. Part 1 | journal = Anaesthesiol Intensive Ther | volume = 47 | issue = 2 | pages = 162–167 | date = 2015 | pmid = 25940332 | doi = 10.5603/AIT.2015.0015 | quote = The ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) is responsible for a sustained wakefulness state. It receives information from sensory receptors of various modalities, transmitted through spinoreticular pathways and cranial nerves (trigeminal nerve — polymodal pathways, olfactory nerve, optic nerve and vestibulocochlear nerve — monomodal pathways). These pathways reach the thalamus directly or indirectly via the medial column of reticular formation nuclei (magnocellular nuclei and reticular nuclei of pontine tegmentum). The reticular activating system begins in the dorsal part of the posterior midbrain and anterior pons, continues into the diencephalon, and then divides into two parts reaching the thalamus and hypothalamus, which then project into the cerebral cortex (Fig. 1). The thalamic projection is dominated by cholinergic neurons originating from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus of pons and midbrain (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus of pons and midbrain (LDT) nuclei [17, 18]. The hypothalamic projection involves noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC) and serotoninergic neurons of the dorsal and median raphe nuclei (DR), which pass through the lateral hypothalamus and reach axons of the histaminergic tubero-mamillary nucleus (TMN), together forming a pathway extending into the forebrain, cortex and hippocampus. Cortical arousal also takes advantage of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (SN), ventral tegmenti area (VTA) and the periaqueductal grey area (PAG). Fewer cholinergic neurons of the pons and midbrain send projections to the forebrain along the ventral pathway, bypassing the thalamus [19, 20].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM - ascending reticular activating system"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York, USA | isbn = 9780071481274 | page = 295 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 12: Sleep and Arousal | quote = The ARAS is a complex structure consisting of several different circuits including the four monoaminergic pathways&amp;nbsp;...

As discussed in Chapter 6, these neurons project widely throughout the brain from restricted collections of cell bodies. Norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and histamine have complex modulatory functions and, in general, promote wakefulness. The PT in the brain stem is also an important component of the ARAS. Activity of PT cholinergic neurons (REM-on cells) promotes REM sleep. During waking, REM-on cells are inhibited by a subset of ARAS norepinephrine and serotonin neurons called REM-off cells.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pfaff"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pfaff|first1=Donald|title=Brain arousal and information theory neural and genetic mechanisms|date=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674042100|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V0E5Smkq7u8C&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When stimulated, these systems produce cortical activity and alertness.&lt;ref name="ARAS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NHM - ascending reticular activating system" /&gt;

The noradrenergic system is a bundle of axons that originate in the [[locus coeruleus]] and ascends up into the neocortex, [[limbic system]], and basal forebrain. Most of the neurons are projected to the posterior cortex which is important with sensory information, and alertness. The activation of the locus coeruleus and release of norepinephrine causes wakefulness and increases vigilance. The neurons that project into the basal forebrain impact cholinergic neurons that results in a flood of acetylcholine into the cerebral cortex.

The acetylcholinergic system has its neurons located in the pons and in the basal forebrain. Stimulation of these neurons result in cortical activity, shown from EEG records, and alertness. All of the other four neurotransmitters play a role in activating the acetylcholine neurons.

Another arousal system, the dopaminergic system, releases dopamine produced by the [[substantia nigra]]. The neurons arise in the ventral tegmental area in the midbrain, and projects to the nucleus accumbens, the striatum forebrain, limbic system, and prefrontal cortex. The limbic system is important for control of mood, and the nucleus accumbens signal excitement and arousal. The path terminating in the prefrontal cortex is important in regulating motor movements, especially reward oriented movements.

The serotonergic system has almost all of its serotonergic neurons originating in the [[raphe nuclei]]. This system projects to the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex. Stimulation of these axons and release of serotonin causes cortical arousal and impacts locomotion and mood.

The neurons of the histamergenic system are in the tuberomammillary nucleus of the hypothalamus. These neurons send pathways to the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and the basal forebrain, where they stimulate the release of acetylcholine into the cerebral cortex.

All of these systems are linked and show similar redundancy. The pathways described are ascending pathways, but there also arousal pathways that descend. One example is the ventrolateral preoptic area, which release [[GABA reuptake inhibitor]]s, which interrupt wakefulness and arousal. Neurotransmitters of the arousal system, such as acetylcholine and norepinephrine, work to inhibit the ventrolateral preoptic area.

{{Mental state}}

Arousal is important in regulating [[consciousness]], attention, and information processing.  It is crucial for [[motivation|motivating]] certain behaviors, such as mobility, the pursuit of nutrition, the [[fight-or-flight response]] and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] (see [[Masters and Johnson]]'s [[human sexual response cycle]], where it is known as the ''arousal phase''). Arousal is also an essential element in many influential theories of [[emotion]], such as the [[James-Lange theory of emotion]] or the [[Emotion classification#Circumplex model|Circumplex Model]].  According to [[Hans Eysenck]], differences in baseline arousal level lead people to be either [[Extraversion and introversion|extraverts or introverts]]. Later research suggests that extroverts and introverts likely have different ''arousability''. Their baseline arousal level is the same, but the response to stimulation is different.&lt;ref&gt;Randy J. Larsen, David M Buss; "Personality psychology, domains of knowledge about human nature", McGraw Hill, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yerkes–Dodson law]] states that there is a relationship between arousal and task performance, essentially arguing that there is an optimal level of arousal for performance, and too little or too much arousal can adversely affect task performance. One interpretation of the Yerkes–Dodson law is the Easterbrook cue-utilisation theory. It predicted that high levels of arousal will lead to [[attention]] narrowing, during which the range of [[Sensory cue|cues]] from the stimulus and the environment decreases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easterbrook|first1=J. A.|title=The effect of emotion on cue utilization and the organization of behavior|journal=Psychological Review|date=1959|volume=66|issue=3|pages=183–201|doi=10.1037/h0047707|pmid=13658305}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this hypothesis, attention will be focused primarily on the arousing details (cues) of the stimulus, so that information central to the source of the emotional arousal will be encoded while peripheral details will not.&lt;ref name="sharot2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharot | first1 = T | last2 = Phelps | first2 = E A | year = 2004 | title = How arousal modulates memory: Disentangling the effects of attention and retention | url = | journal = Cognitive, Affective, &amp; Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 4 | issue = 3| pages = 294–306 | doi = 10.3758/CABN.4.3.294 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[positive psychology]], arousal is described as a response to a difficult challenge for which the subject has moderate skills.&lt;ref name="Finding Flow"/&gt;

== Personality ==

=== Introversion and extroversion ===

Eysenck's theory of arousal describes the different natural frequency or arousal states of the brains of people who are introverted versus people who are extroverted. The theory states that the brains of extroverts are naturally less stimulated, so these types have a predisposition to seek out situations and partake in behaviors that will stimulate arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Biological Basis of Personality|last=Eysenck|first=H. J.|publisher=Charles C Thomas|year=1967|isbn=|location=Springfield, IL|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas extroverts are naturally under-stimulated and therefore actively engage in arousing situations, introverts are naturally over-stimulated and therefore avoid intense arousal. Campbell and Hawley (1982) studied the differences in introverts versus extroverts responses to particular work environments in the library.&lt;ref name="First"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belojevic|first1=G|date=June 2001|title=Mental performance in noise: The role of introversion|url=|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=21|issue=2|pages=209-213|doi=10.1006/jevp.2000.0188|via=www.idealibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that introverts were more likely to choose quiet areas with minimal to no noise or people. Extroverts were more likely to choose areas with much activity with more noise and people.&lt;ref name=First /&gt; Daoussiss and McKelvie's (1986) research showed that introverts performed worse on memory tasks when they were in the presence of music compared to silence. Extroverts were less affected by the presence of music.&lt;ref name=First /&gt; Similarly, Belojevic, Slepcevic and Jokovljevic (2001) found that introverts had more concentration problems and fatigue in their mental processing when work was coupled with external noise or distracting factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belojevic|first=G.|last2=Slepcevic|first2=V.|last3=Jakovljevic|first3=B.|date=June 2001|title=Mental performance in noise: The role of introversion|url=|journal=Journal of Environmental Psychology|volume=21|issue=2|pages=209-213|doi=10.1006/jevp.2000.0188|via=www.idealibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of arousal surrounding the individuals greatly affected their ability to perform tasks and behaviors, with the introverts being more affected than the extroverts, because of each's naturally high and low levels of stimulation, respectively.

=== Emotional stability vs. introversion-extraversion ===

[[Neuroticism]] or emotional instability and extroversion are two factors of the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five Personality Index]]. These two dimensions of personality describe how a person deals with anxiety-provoking or emotional stimuli as well as how a person behaves and responds to relevant and irrelevant external stimuli in their environment. Neurotics experience tense arousal which is characterized by tension and nervousness. Extroverts experience high energetic arousal which is characterized by vigor and energy.&lt;ref name="Third"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zajenkowski|first1=Marcin|last2=Goryńska|first2=Ewa|last3=Winiewski|first3=Mikołaj|title=Variability of the relationship between personality and mood|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=May 2012|volume=52|issue=7|pages=858–861|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2012.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray (1981) claimed that extroverts have a higher sensitivity to reward signals than to punishment in comparison to introverts. Reward signals aim to raise the energy levels.&lt;ref name=Third /&gt; Therefore, extroverts typically have a higher energetic arousal because of their greater response to rewards.

=== Four personality types ===

[[Hippocrates]] theorized that there are four personality types: [[choleric]], [[Melancholia|melancholic]], [[Four Temperaments#Sanguine|sanguine]], and [[phlegmatic]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:EysenckPersonalityTypes.gif|thumbnail|right|Eysenck's 4 Personality Types]] --&gt;
Put in terms of the five factor level of personality, choleric people are high in neuroticism and high in extraversion. The choleric react immediately, and the arousal is strong, lasting, and can easily create new excitement about similar situations, ideas, or impressions.&lt;ref name=Book /&gt; Melancholic people are high in neuroticism and low in extraversion (or more introverted). The melancholic are slow to react and it takes time for an impression to be made upon them if any is made at all. However, when aroused by something, melancholics have a deeper and longer lasting reaction, especially when exposed to similar experiences.&lt;ref name=Book /&gt; Sanguine people are low in neuroticism (or more emotionally stable) and high in extraversion. The sanguine are quickly aroused and excited, like the cholerics, but unlike the cholerics, their arousal is shallow, superficial, and shortly leaves them as quickly as it developed.&lt;ref name=Book&gt;{{cite book|last=Hock|first=Conrad|title=The Four Temperaments|year=1934|publisher=Catholic Apostolate Press|location=Milwaukee, WI|isbn=978-1453823941|url=http://sedevacantist.com/misc/temperaments.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phlegmatic people are low in neuroticism and low in extraversion. The phlegmatic are slower to react and the arousal is fleeting.&lt;ref name=Book /&gt;

The contrasts in the different temperaments come from individuals variations in a person's brain stem, limbic system, and thalamocortical arousal system. These changes are observed by [[Electroencephalography|electroencephalogram]] (EEG) recordings which monitor brain activity.&lt;ref name="Fourth"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=David L|title=How brain arousal systems determine different temperament types and the major dimensions of personality|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|date=December 2001|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1233–1259|doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(00)00211-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limbic system activation is typically linked to neuroticism, with high activation showing high neuroticism.&lt;ref name=Fifth/&gt; Cortical arousal is associated with introversion–extraversion differences, with high arousal associated with introversion.&lt;ref name=Fifth/&gt; Both the limbic system and the thalamocortical arousal system are influenced by the brainstem activation.&lt;ref name=Fifth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson |first1=David |last2=Gabriel |first2=Norman |last3=Katchan |first3=Olga |title=Personality and second language learning |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |date=January 1994 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=143–157 |doi=10.1016/0191-8869(94)90118-x |url=http://yunting2.wikispaces.com/file/view/personality+and+second+lg+learning.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203015419/http://yunting2.wikispaces.com/file/view/personality%2Band%2Bsecond%2Blg%2Blearning.pdf |archivedate=3 December 2013 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson's study (1982) concluded that melancholic types had the greatest [[natural frequencies]], or a "predominance of excitation", meaning that melancholics (who are characterized by introversion) have a higher internal level of arousal.&lt;ref name=Fourth /&gt; Sanguine people (or those with high extraversion and low neuroticism) had the lowest overall levels of internal arousal, or a "predominance of inhibition".&lt;ref name=Fourth /&gt; Melancholics also had the highest overall thalamocortical excitation, whereas cholerics (those with high extraversion and high neuroticism) had the lowest intrinsic thalamocortical excitation.&lt;ref name=Fourth /&gt;

The differences in the internal system levels is the evidence that Eysenck used to explain the differences between the introverted and the extroverted. [[Ivan Pavlov]], the founder of [[classical conditioning]], also partook in temperament studies with animals. Pavlov's findings with animals are consistent with Eysenck's conclusions. In his studies, melancholics produced an inhibitory response to all external stimuli, which holds true that melancholics shut out outside arousal, because they are deeply internally aroused.&lt;ref name="Fourth" /&gt; Pavlov found that cholerics responded to stimuli with aggression and excitement whereas melancholics became depressed and unresponsive.&lt;ref name="Fourth" /&gt; The high neuroticism which characterizes both melancholics and cholerics manifested itself differently in the two types because of the different levels of internal arousal they had.

== Emotion ==

=== Cannon–Bard theory ===
The [[Cannon–Bard theory]] is a theory of undifferentiated arousal, where the physical and emotional states occur at the same time in response to an event. This theory states that an emotionally provoking event results in both the physiological arousal and the emotion occurring concurrently.&lt;ref name=Tenth&gt;{{cite web|title=Cannon-Bard Theory of Emotion|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/cannon_bard_emotion.htm|work=ChangingMinds.org|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a person's dear family member dies, a potential physiological response would be tears falling down the person's face and their throat feeling dry; they are "sad". The Cannon–Bard theory states that the tears and the sadness both happen at the same time. The process goes: event (family member dies) → physiological arousal (tears) and emotion (sadness) simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Tenth"/&gt; The fact that people can experience different emotions when they have the same pattern of physiological arousal is one argument in favor of the Cannon-Bard theory. For example, a person may have a heart racing and rapid breathing when they are angry or afraid. Even though not completely in accordance with the theory, it is taken as one piece of evidence in favor of the Cannon–Bard theory that physiological reactions sometimes happen more slowly than experiences of emotion. For example, if you are in the forest or woods, a sudden sound can create an immediate response of fear, while the physical symptoms of fear follow that feeling, and do not precede it.&lt;ref name=Eleventh&gt;{{cite web|title=Theories of Emotion|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/james-lange-cannon-bard-theories-of-emotion.html|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== James–Lange theory ===

The [[James–Lange theory]] describes how emotion is caused by the bodily changes which come from the perception of the emotionally arousing experience or environment.&lt;ref name=Sixth /&gt; This theory states that events cause the autonomic nervous system to induce physiological arousal, characterized by muscular tension, heart rate increases, perspiration, dryness of mouth, tears, etc.&lt;ref name=Ninth&gt;{{cite web|title=James-Lange Theory of Emotion|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/james_lange_emotion.htm|work=ChangingMinds.org|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to James and Lange, the emotion comes as a result of the physiological arousal.&lt;ref name=Eighth /&gt; The bodily feeling as a reaction to the situation actually is the emotion.&lt;ref name=Sixth /&gt; For example, if someone just deeply insulted a person and their family, the person's fists might ball up and they might begin to perspire and become tense all around. The person feels that their fists are balled and that they are tense. The person then realizes that they are angry. The process here is: event (insult) --&gt; physiological arousal (balled fists, sweat, tension) --&gt; interpretation ("I have balled fists, and tension") --&gt; emotion (anger: "I am angry").&lt;ref name=Eighth /&gt; This type of theory emphasizes the physiological arousal as the key, in that the cognitive processes alone would not be sufficient evidence of an emotion.

=== Schachter–Singer two-factor theory ===

The [[Two-factor theory of emotion|Schachter–Singer two-factor theory]] or the cognitive labeling theory takes into account both the physiological arousal and the cognitive processes that respond to an emotion-provoking situation. Schachter and Singer's theory states that an emotional state is the product of the physiological arousal and the cognition regarding the state of arousal. Thus, cognition determines how the physical response is labeled; for example, as "anger", "joy", or "fear".&lt;ref name=Sixth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schachter|first1=Stanley|last2=Singer|first2=Jerome|title=Cognitive, social, and physiological determinants of emotional state|journal=Psychological Review|date=September 1962|volume=69|issue=5|pages=379–399|doi=10.1037/h0046234}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this theory, emotion is seen as a product of the interaction between the state of arousal and how one's thought processes appraise the current situation.&lt;ref name=Seventh&gt;{{cite web|title=Schacter and Singer's study of emotion |url=http://learning.covcollege.ac.uk/content/NLN/Health_Care,_Medicine,_Health_And_Safety/Psychology/act_PK1_Schacter_and_Singers_study_of_emotion/FD2427DE-89F1-4E3E-9CB0-2E0FA376BEE0/s05two_factor_theory/010a_twofactors.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121223003536/http://learning.covcollege.ac.uk/content/NLN/Health_Care,_Medicine,_Health_And_Safety/Psychology/act_PK1_Schacter_and_Singers_study_of_emotion/FD2427DE-89F1-4E3E-9CB0-2E0FA376BEE0/s05two_factor_theory/010a_twofactors.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 December 2012 |work=Becta Psychology |accessdate=12 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The physiological arousal does not provide the label for the emotion; cognition does. For example, if a person is being pursued by a serial killer, the person will likely be sweating and their heart will be racing, which is their physiological state. The person's cognitive label will come from assessing their quickly beating heart and sweat as "fear". Then they will feel the emotion of "fear", but only after it has been established through cognition. The process is: the event (serial killer chasing the person) --&gt; physiological arousal (sweat, heart racing) --&gt; cognitive label (reasoning; "this is fear") --&gt; emotion (fear).&lt;ref name=Eighth&gt;{{cite web|title=Two-Factor Theory of Emotion|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/theories/two-factor_emotion.htm|work=ChangingMinds.org|accessdate=12 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memory ==

Arousal is involved in the detection, retention, and retrieval of information in the [[memory]] process. Emotionally arousing information can lead to better memory encoding, therefore influencing better retention and retrieval of information. Arousal is related to [[selective attention]] during the encoding process by showing that people are more subject to encode arousing information than neutral information.&lt;ref name="sharot2004"/&gt; The selectivity of encoding arousing stimuli produces better [[long-term memory]] results than the encoding of neutral stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mickley Steinmetz|first1=Katherine R.|last2=Schmidt|first2=Katherine|last3=Zucker|first3=Halle R.|last4=Kensinger|first4=Elizabeth A.|title=The effect of emotional arousal and retention delay on subsequent-memory effects|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience|date=September 2012|volume=3|issue=3–4|pages=150–159|doi=10.1080/17588928.2012.677421|pmc=3818726}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the retention and accumulation of information is strengthened when exposed to arousing events or information. Arousing information is also retrieved or remembered more vividly and accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jeong|first1=Eui Jun|last2=Biocca|first2=Frank A.|title=Are there optimal levels of arousal to memory? Effects of arousal, centrality, and familiarity on brand memory in video games|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=March 2012|volume=28|issue=2|pages=285–291|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2011.09.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although arousal improves memory under most circumstances, there are some considerations. Arousal at learning is associated more with long-term recall and retrieval of information than short-term recall of information.  For example, one study found that people could remember arousing words better after one week of learning them than merely two minutes after learning them.&lt;ref name="Revelle"&gt;{{cite web|last=Revelle |first=W |title=The implications of arousal effects for the study of affect and memory |url=http://pmc.psych.northwestern.edu/revelle/publications/rl91/rev_loft.arousal.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051208074812/http://pmc.psych.northwestern.edu/revelle/publications/rl91/rev_loft.arousal.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Another study found that arousal affects the memory of people in different ways. Eysenck found an association between memory and the arousal of introverts versus extroverts.  Higher levels of arousal increased the amount of words retrieved by extroverts and decreased the amount of words retrieved by introverts.&lt;ref name="Revelle"/&gt;

== Preference ==

A person's level of arousal when introduced to stimuli can be indicative of his or her preferences. One study found that familiar stimuli are often preferred to unfamiliar stimuli.  The findings suggested that the exposure to unfamiliar stimuli was correlated to avoidance behaviors. The unfamiliar stimuli may lead to increased arousal and increased avoidance behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ramsøy|first1=Thomas Z.|last2=Friis-Olivarius|first2=Morten|last3=Jacobsen|first3=Catrine|last4=Jensen|first4=Simon B.|last5=Skov|first5=Martin|title=Effects of perceptual uncertainty on arousal and preference across different visual domains|journal=Journal of Neuroscience, Psychology, and Economics|date=2012|volume=5|issue=4|pages=212–226|doi=10.1037/a0030198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the contrary, increased arousal can increase approach behaviors as well. People are said to make decisions based on their emotional states. They choose specific options that lead to more favorable emotional states.&lt;ref name="Suri"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suri|first1=Gaurav|last2=Sheppes|first2=Gal|last3=Gross|first3=James J.|title=Predicting affective choice|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|date=2013|volume=142|issue=3|pages=627–632|doi=10.1037/a0029900|pmc=4153792}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a person is aroused, he or she may find a wider range of events appealing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ariely|first1=Dan|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|title=The heat of the moment: the effect of sexual arousal on sexual decision making|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date=April 2006|volume=19|issue=2|pages=87–98|doi=10.1002/bdm.501}}&lt;/ref&gt; and view decisions as more salient, specifically influencing [[approach-avoidance conflict]].&lt;ref name="Suri"/&gt; The state of arousal might lead a person to view a decision more positively than he or she would have in a less aroused state.

The reversal theory accounts for the preference of either high or low arousal in different situations. Both forms of arousal can be pleasant or unpleasant, depending on a person's moods and goals at a specific time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walters|first1=Jean|last2=Apter|first2=Michael J.|last3=Svebak|first3=Sven|title=Color preference, arousal, and the theory of psychological reversals|journal=Motivation and Emotion|date=September 1982|volume=6|issue=3|pages=193–215|doi=10.1007/bf00992245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wundt's and Berlyne's hedonic curve differ from this theory. Both theorists explain a person's arousal potential in terms of his or her hedonic tone. These individual differences in arousal demonstrate Eysenck's theory that extroverts prefer increased stimulation and arousal, whereas introverts prefer lower stimulation and arousal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Revelle|first=W.|title=Arousal Theories|url=http://personality-project.org/revelle/syllabi/205/arousaltheories.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated problems ==

Altered experiences of arousal are associated with both [[anxiety]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].

Depression can influence a person's level of arousal by interfering with the right hemisphere's functioning.  Arousal in women has been shown to be slowed in the left visual field due to depression, indicating the influence of the right hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liotti|first1=Mario|last2=Tucker|first2=Don M|title=Right hemisphere sensitivity to arousal and depression|journal=Brain and Cognition|date=March 1992|volume=18|issue=2|pages=138–151|doi=10.1016/0278-2626(92)90075-w}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arousal and anxiety have a different relationship than arousal and depression.  People who suffer from anxiety disorders tend to have abnormal and amplified perceptions of arousal.  The distorted perceptions of arousal then create fear and distorted perceptions of the self.  For example, a person may believe that he or she will get sick from being so nervous about taking an exam.  The fear of the arousal of nervousness and how people will perceive this arousal will then contribute to levels of anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thibodeau|first1=Michel A.|last2=Gómez-Pérez|first2=Lydia|last3=Asmundson|first3=Gordon J.G.|title=Objective and perceived arousal during performance of tasks with elements of social threat: The influence of anxiety sensitivity|journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry|date=September 2012|volume=43|issue=3|pages=967–974|doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2012.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abnormally increased behavioral arousal ==

This is caused by withdrawal from [[alcohol]] or [[barbiturates]], acute [[encephalitis]], [[head trauma]] resulting in [[coma]], partial [[seizures]] in [[epilepsy]], [[metabolic disorders]] of [[electrolyte]] imbalance, Intra-cranial space- occupying lesions, Alzheimer's disease, rabies, hemispheric lesions in stroke and multiple sclerosis.&lt;ref name= "Mirr"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mirr|first=Michaelene Pheifer|editor1-last=Kunkel|editor1-first=Joyce A.|editor2-last=Stewart-Amidei|editor2-first=Chris|title=AANN's Neuroscience Nursing: Human Responses to Neurologic Dysfunction|chapter=Abnormally Increased Behavioral Arousal|edition=2nd|date=2001|publisher=W.B. Saunders|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780721622880|pages=119–136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anatomically this is a disorder of the limbic system, [[hypothalamus]], [[temporal lobes]], [[amygdala]] and [[frontal lobes]].&lt;ref name= "Mirr" /&gt; It is not to be confused with [[mania]].

== Effects of physiological arousal on cognition ==
The effects of physiological arousal on [[cognition]] cause individuals to be active, attentive, or excited.
The term "physiological" refers to [[physiology]] and concerns the normal functioning of an organism. Physiological arousal refers to features of arousal reflected by physiological reactions, such as escalations in [[blood pressure]] and rate of [[Breathing|respiration]] and lessened activity of the [[gastrointestinal system]].
These terms are what allow for the effects physiological arousal has on cognition itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-15046-001?doi=1|title=PsycNET|website=psycnet.apa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cognition is internal mental representations best characterized as thoughts and ideas- resulting from and involved in multiple mental processes and operations including perception, reasoning, memory,  intuition, judgement and decision making. While cognition is not directly observable, it is still amenable to study using the scientific method. Cognition is also something that plays a fundamental role in determining behavior. Goes into explaining cognitive functions and how they are internal and inferred from behavior using measure like accuracy in performing a task like recalling a list of words of the time taken to find some word on a page of text.
The study of cognitive [[Cognitive function|functions]] derive from the [[information processing approach]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piccinini|first=Gualtiero|last2=Scarantino|first2=Andrea|date=January 2011|title=Information processing, computation, and cognition|journal=Journal of Biological Physics|volume=37|issue=1|pages=1–38|doi=10.1007/s10867-010-9195-3|issn=0092-0606|pmc=3006465|pmid=22210958}}&lt;/ref&gt; which argues that these functions that these functions involve operations occurring at various processing stages is typically based on a model of cognitive function of interest.

Physiological comes from physiology which is the study of the functioning of living organisms, animal or plant, and of the functioning of their constituent tissues or cells. This word was first used by the Greeks to describe a philosophical inquiry into the nature of things. The use of the term with specific reference to vital activities of healthy humans, which began in the 16th century, also applicable to many current aspects of physiology.
Physiological responses to [[Fight-or-flight response|fight or flight]]:
When the body is initially challenged by a [[stressor]] it responds with physiological activation (also known as arousal) of a defense system to deal with the immediate stressor. "If a stimulus is perceived as a threat, a more intense and prolonged discharge of the locus ceruleus which is the major nor adrenergic nucleus of the brain, giving rise to fibers innervating extensive areas throughout the [[neuraxis]].  Also referred as the Neuroaxis, is the axis in the central nervous system.  activates the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. (Thase &amp; Howland 1995)" (psychologistworld.org, n.d.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologistworld.com/stress/fight-or-flight-response|title=How Fight-or-flight Instincts Impact On Your Stress Levels|website=www.psychologistworld.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activation of the sympathetic nervous system leads to the release of non-epinephrine from nerve endings acting on the heart, blood vessels, respiratory centers, and other sites. The ensuing physiological changes constitute a major part of the acute stress response. Which can often lead to as the fight or flight response.
Anticipated behaviors are actions that are foreseen or predicted to happen in a specific situation due to different environmental factors. Furthermore, they are decided by one’s past experiences and knowledge.

Anticipated behaviors examples
-Someone sitting in the same seat every day during class.
-Someone reaching their hand out towards you would indicate they are wanting to shake hands.
- While driving a car you would anticipate people braking therefore you would brake as well.
When a loud unexpected noise is created you are startled and flinch.
- When a person sneezes you say “bless you”.

A real life example of cognition is used whenever decision making is involved for example, a real life scenario of a cognitive decision would be when a traffic light is changing from green to yellow. One would either make a cognitive decision to run through the yellow light in hopes you could clear the intersection before the light turned red. However, one could make a different cognitive decision to stop when they see the yellow light to not run the light before it turned red.

A real life example of the effects of physiological arousal on cognition is when you’re walking through the woods and you notice a rattlesnake in front of the walkway on the ground. You would feel alarmed and scared (physiological arousal).Your past experience and knowledge of poisonous snakes and dangerous predators provides the (cognition) of the situation. Based on your analysis of your position you label your arousal as fear.
Fear is explained to be an emotion that one might expect with alarm, it is also known as something to be afraid of or the feelings of apprehensiveness.  Fear works when one senses danger, the brain reacts instantly, sending signals that activate the nervous system. This causes physical responses, such as a faster heartbeat, rapid breathing, and an increase in blood pressure. Blood pumps to muscle groups to prepare the body for physical action like running or fighting. Skin sweats to keep the body cool. Some people might notice sensations in the stomach, head, chest, legs, or hands. These physical sensations of fear can be mild or strong.
A study done by Joan Vickers and Mark Williams&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vickers|first=Joan N.|last2=Williams|first2=A. Mark|date=2007-09-01|title=Performing Under Pressure: The Effects of Physiological Arousal, Cognitive Anxiety, and Gaze Control in Biathlon|url=https://doi.org/10.3200/JMBR.39.5.381-394|journal=Journal of Motor Behavior|volume=39|issue=5|pages=381–394|doi=10.3200/JMBR.39.5.381-394|issn=0022-2895|pmid=17827115}}&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed how a group of elite biathlon shooters handled an experimental task. The goal was to determine why there might be a failure to perform in high pressure situations. Difficulties come about when trying to test performance pressure, physiological workload, anxiety, and visual attention in a controlled setting. Which is why they decided to test these elite biathlon shooters, due to the easy ability to stimulate the controlled experiment. In the low pressure stimulation the subjects were only told that the purpose of the test was to simply provide feedback and the fixation on the target at different power output levels. In the high pressure situation the shorter were told that the national team coach was going to observe the shooters, and their shooting percentages would be used to make the national team selections. Both groups were told that prizes would be rewarded to the most accurate shooters. To test physiological arousal that was being used, Vickers and Williams measured each shooters heart rate as well as the perceived exertion. Trying to determine if the failure to perform to whatever level of skill or ability the person has at the time, also known as choking; was indeed a factor in this test. Physiological arousal was measured and recorded through the athlete's heart rate and rate of perceived exertion. The findings showed that the biathletes developed the ability to decelerate their heart rate just before they shoot, most only shoot when HR is 80% or lower. Whereas the test was designed for shots to be taken with a heart rate 100% or above. The expectations were for the low pressure and high pressure groups to be more prone to choking compared to those who were able to maintain their heart rates. The findings showed exactly what was expected, the only exception was that the pressure applied did not necessarily have much of an effect. While it was clear that high pressure stimulations did appear far more anxious than those of low pressure stimulations.

[[Problem solving]] is the cognitive process that someone uses to achieve a goal whenever a solution cannot be determined by others.

For example, you are with your buddies on a trip and get a flat tire. Everyone looks around nervously because nobody knows how to change a flat. But then you remember that you took an automotive class in college where you learned to change flat tires. You change the tire and solve the issue with your cognitive problem solving. Cognitively, the utilization of logical analysis and problem solving has been associated with higher levels of life satisfaction, better health, and lower depression in caregivers. A realistic appraisal and acceptance of the difficult situation is healthy and allows the caregiver to live his or her own life while accommodating the needs of the recipient. Less effective cognitive coping styles include avoidant-evasive, regressive, and an increased use of wishfulness and fantasizing by the caregiver, all of which have been related to higher levels of care burden (Hayley et al., 1987; Quayhagen &amp; Quayhagen, 1988).

Cognitive appraisal is the stress perceived as imbalance between demands place on the individual and the individual and the individual's resources to cope.  Lazarus argued that the experience of stress differs significantly between individuals depending on how they interpret an event and the outcome of a specific sequence of thinking patterns called [[Appraisal theory|appraisals]].

It also refers to the personal interpretation of a situation that ultimately influences the extent to which the situation is perceived as stressful, process of assessing whether a situation or event threatens our well being, whether there are sufficient personal resources available for coping with the demand of the situation of whether our strategy for dealing with the situation is effective.

The three parts that it can be divided into are primary appraisal, secondary appraisal, and reappraisal. Primary Appraisal is an assessment of how significant an event is for a person, including whether it is a threat or opportunity, also including that no heightened physiological arousal occurs it means no stress will either. Secondary Appraisal considers one's ability to cope or take advantage of the situation. Cognitive Appraisal is a personal interpretation of a situation and possible reactions to it.

Their secondary appraisal determines what the person will do, and involves their perception of their options and resources.

These appraisals can be accurate or inaccurate, and helping a person arrive at more apt appraisals is a goal of some modes of cognitive behavioral therapy, This is a psychosocial intervention that is the most widely used evidence based practice for improving mental health guided by empirical research cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on the development of personal coping strategies that target solving current problems and changing unhelpful patterns in cognition, behaviors, and emotional regulation. Also known as regulation of emotion; is the ability to respond to the ongoing demands of experience with the range of emotions in a manner that is socially tolerable and sufficiently flexible to permit spontaneous reactions as well as the ability to delay spontaneous reactions as needed. It can also be defined as Extrinsic and Intrinsic processes responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional reactions. [[Emotional self-regulation]] belongs to the broader set of emotion-regulation processes, which includes the regulations of one's own feelings and the regulations of other people's feelings.

The aim of the [[Scientific theory|theory]] of artificial consciousness is to "Define that which would have to be synthesized were consciousness to be found in an engineered artifact" {{Harv|Aleksander|1995}}.

[[Neuroscience]] hypothesizes that [[consciousness]] is generated by the interoperation of various parts of the [[brain]], called the [[neural correlates of consciousness]] or NCC, though there are challenges to that perspective. Proponents of AC believe it is possible to construct [[system]]s (e.g., [[computer]] systems) that can emulate this NCC interoperation.&lt;ref name="Graziano Consciousness and the Social Brain"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graziano|first1=Michael|title=Consciousness and the Social Brain|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199928644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial consciousness concepts are also pondered in the philosophy of [[artificial intelligence]] through [[philosophy of artificial intelligence#Can a machine have a mind, consciousness, and mental states?|questions about mind, consciousness, and mental states]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]'' includes the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] foundations of AI including the questions of consciousness http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/contents.html, Russell, Stuart J., Norvig, Peter, 2003, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, {{ISBN|0-13-790395-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical views==
As there are many hypothesized [[Consciousness#Types of consciousness|types of consciousness]], there are many potential implementations of artificial consciousness.  In the philosophical literature, perhaps the most common taxonomy of consciousness is into "access" and "phenomenal" variants.  Access consciousness concerns those aspects of [[experience]] that can be apprehended, while phenomenal consciousness concerns those aspects of experience that seemingly cannot be apprehended, instead being characterized qualitatively in terms of “raw feels”, “what it is like” or [[qualia]] ({{harvnb|Block|1997}}).

=== Plausibility debate ===
[[Type physicalism|Type-identity theorists]] and other skeptics hold the view that consciousness can only be realized in particular physical systems because consciousness has properties that necessarily depend on physical constitution ({{harvnb|Block|1978}}; {{harvnb|Bickle|2003}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schlagel | first1 = R. H. | year = 1999 | title = Why not artificial consciousness or thought? | url = | journal = Minds and Machines | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 3–28 | doi=10.1023/a:1008374714117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Searle | first1 = J. R. | year = 1980 | title = Minds, brains, and programs | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 3 | issue = 3| pages = 417–457 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00005756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article "Artificial Consciousness: Utopia or Real Possibility" Giorgio Buttazzo says that despite our current technology's ability to simulate autonomy, "Working in a fully automated mode, they [the computers] cannot exhibit creativity, emotions, or [[free will]]. A computer, like a washing machine, is a slave operated by its components."&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=933500&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fiel5%2F2%2F20203%2F00933500 Artificial consciousness: Utopia or real possibility?] Buttazzo, Giorgio, July 2001, Computer, ISSN 0018-9162&lt;/ref&gt;

For other theorists (e.g., [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalists]]), who define mental states in terms of causal roles, any system that can instantiate the same pattern of causal roles, regardless of physical constitution, will instantiate the same mental states, including consciousness ({{harvnb|Putnam|1967}}).

==== Computational Foundation argument ====
One of the most explicit arguments for the plausibility of AC comes from [[David Chalmers]].  His proposal, found within his article {{harvnb | Chalmers | 2011}}, is roughly that the right kinds of computations are sufficient for the possession of a conscious mind. In the outline, he defends his claim thus: Computers perform computations. Computations can capture other systems' abstract causal organization.

The most controversial part of Chalmers' proposal is that mental properties are "organizationally invariant". Mental properties are of two kinds, psychological and phenomenological. Psychological properties, such as belief and perception, are those that are "characterized by their causal role". He adverts to the work of {{harvnb|Armstrong|1968}} and {{harvnb|Lewis|1972}} in claiming that "[s]ystems with the same causal topology…will share their psychological properties".

Phenomenological properties are not prima facie definable in terms of their causal roles. Establishing that phenomenological properties are amenable to individuation by causal role therefore requires argument. Chalmers provides his Dancing Qualia Argument for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consc.net/papers/qualia.html|title=Absent Qualia, Fading Qualia, Dancing Qualia|accessdate=12 April 2016|date=1995|first=David|last=Chalmers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chalmers begins by assuming that agents with identical causal organizations could have different experiences. He then asks us to conceive of changing one agent into the other by the replacement of parts (neural parts replaced by silicon, say) while preserving its causal organization. Ex hypothesi, the experience of the agent under transformation would change (as the parts were replaced), but there would be no change in causal topology and therefore no means whereby the agent could "notice" the shift in experience.

Critics of AC object that Chalmers begs the question in assuming that all mental properties and external connections are sufficiently captured by abstract causal organization.

=== Ethics ===
{{Main|Ethics of artificial intelligence|Machine ethics|Roboethics}}
If it were suspected that a particular machine was conscious, its rights would be an [[ethics|ethical]] issue that would need to be assessed (e.g. what rights it would have under law). For example, a conscious computer that was owned and used as a tool or central computer of a building or large machine is a particular ambiguity. Should [[law]]s be made for such a case, consciousness would also require a legal definition (for example a machine's ability to experience [[pleasure]] or [[pain]], known as [[sentience]]). Because artificial consciousness is still largely a theoretical subject, such ethics have not been discussed or developed to a great extent, though it has often been a theme in fiction (see below).

The rules for the 2003 [[Loebner Prize]] competition explicitly addressed the question of robot rights:
&lt;blockquote&gt;61. If, in any given year, a publicly available open source Entry entered by the University of Surrey or the Cambridge Center wins the Silver Medal or the Gold Medal, then the Medal and the Cash Award will be awarded to the body responsible for the development of that Entry. If no such body can be identified, or if there is disagreement among two or more claimants, the Medal and the Cash Award will be held in trust ''until such time as the Entry may legally possess, either in the United States of America or in the venue of the contest, the Cash Award and Gold Medal in its own right''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://loebner03.hamill.co.uk/docs/LPC%20Official%20Rules%20v2.0.pdf Loebner Prize Contest Official Rules — Version 2.0] The competition was directed by [[David Hamill]] and the rules were developed by members of the Robitron Yahoo group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Research and implementation proposals ==

=== Aspects of consciousness ===
There are various aspects of consciousness generally deemed necessary for a machine to be artificially conscious. A variety of functions in which consciousness plays a role were suggested by [[Bernard Baars]] ({{harvnb|Baars|1988}}) and others. The functions of consciousness suggested by Bernard Baars are Definition and Context Setting, Adaptation and Learning, Editing, Flagging and Debugging, Recruiting and Control, Prioritizing and Access-Control, Decision-making or Executive Function, Analogy-forming Function, Metacognitive and Self-monitoring Function, and Autoprogramming and Self-maintenance Function. Igor Aleksander suggested 12 principles for artificial consciousness ({{harvnb|Aleksander|1995}}) and these are: The Brain is a State Machine, Inner Neuron Partitioning, Conscious and Unconscious States, Perceptual Learning and Memory, Prediction, The Awareness of Self, Representation of Meaning, Learning Utterances, Learning Language, Will, Instinct, and Emotion. The aim of AC is to define whether and how these and other aspects of consciousness can be synthesized in an engineered artifact such as a digital computer. This list is not exhaustive; there are many others not covered.

==== Awareness ====
[[Awareness]] could be one required aspect, but there are many problems with the exact definition of ''awareness''. The results of the experiments of [[Mirror neurons#In monkeys|neuroscanning on monkeys]] suggest that a process, not only a state or object, activates neurons. Awareness includes creating and testing alternative models of each process based on the information received through the senses or imagined, and is also useful for making predictions. Such modeling needs a lot of flexibility. Creating such a model includes modeling of the physical world, modeling of one's own internal states and processes, and modeling of other conscious entities.

There are at least three types of awareness:&lt;ref&gt;Joëlle Proust in ''Neural Correlates of Consciousness'', Thomas Metzinger, 2000, MIT, pages 307-324&lt;/ref&gt; agency awareness, goal awareness, and sensorimotor awareness, which may also be conscious or not.  For example, in agency awareness you may be aware that you performed a certain action yesterday, but are not now conscious of it.  In goal awareness you may be aware that you must search for a lost object, but are not now conscious of it.  In sensorimotor awareness, you may be aware that your hand is resting on an object, but are not now conscious of it.

Because objects of awareness are often conscious, the distinction between awareness and consciousness is frequently blurred or they are used as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;Christof Koch, ''The Quest for Consciousness'', 2004, page 2 footnote 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Memory ====
Conscious events interact with [[memory]] systems in learning, rehearsal, and retrieval.&lt;ref&gt;Tulving, E. 1985. Memory and consciousness. Canadian Psychology 26:1-12&lt;/ref&gt;
The IDA model&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Stan, et al. "The role of consciousness in memory." Brains, Minds and Media 1.1 (2005): 38.&lt;/ref&gt; elucidates the role of consciousness in the updating of perceptual memory,&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Stan. "Perceptual memory and learning: Recognizing, categorizing, and relating." Proc. Developmental Robotics AAAI Spring Symp. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; transient [[episodic memory]], and [[procedural memory]]. Transient episodic and declarative memories have distributed representations in IDA, there is evidence that this is also the case in the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;Shastri, L. 2002. Episodic memory and cortico-hippocampal interactions. Trends in Cognitive Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; In IDA, these two memories are implemented computationally using a modified version of [[Pentti Kanerva|Kanerva]]’s [[Sparse distributed memory]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Kanerva, Pentti. Sparse distributed memory. MIT press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Learning ====
Learning is also considered necessary for AC. By Bernard Baars, conscious experience is needed to represent and adapt to novel and significant events ({{harvnb|Baars|1988}}). By [[Axel Cleeremans]] and Luis Jiménez, learning is defined as "a set of philogenetically {{sic}} advanced adaptation processes that critically depend on an evolved sensitivity to subjective experience so as to enable agents to afford flexible control over their actions in complex, unpredictable environments" ({{harvnb|Cleeremans|2001}}).

==== Anticipation ====
The ability to predict (or [[Anticipation (artificial intelligence)|anticipate]]) foreseeable events is considered important for AC by [[Igor Aleksander]].&lt;ref name="Aleksander 1995"&gt;Aleksander 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The emergentist [[Multiple Drafts Model|multiple drafts principle]] proposed by [[Daniel Dennett]] in ''[[Consciousness Explained]]'' may be useful for prediction: it involves the evaluation and selection of the most appropriate "draft" to fit the current environment.  Anticipation includes prediction of consequences of one's own proposed actions and prediction of consequences of probable actions by other entities.

Relationships between real world states are mirrored in the state structure of a conscious organism enabling the organism to predict events.&lt;ref name="Aleksander 1995"/&gt; An artificially conscious machine should be able to anticipate events correctly in order to be ready to respond to them when they occur or to take preemptive action to avert anticipated events. The implication here is that the machine needs flexible, real-time components that build spatial, dynamic, statistical, functional, and cause-effect models of the real world and predicted worlds, making it possible to demonstrate that it possesses artificial consciousness in the present and future and not only in the past. In order to do this, a conscious machine should make coherent predictions and contingency plans, not only in worlds with fixed rules like a chess board, but also for novel environments that may change, to be executed only when appropriate to simulate and control the real world.

==== Subjective experience ====
Subjective experiences or [[qualia]] are widely considered to be ''the'' [[hard problem of consciousness]]. Indeed, it is held to pose a challenge to [[physicalism]], let alone [[computationalism]]. On the other hand, there are problems in other fields of science which limit that which we can observe, such as the [[uncertainty principle]] in physics, which have not made the research in these fields of science impossible.

=== Role of cognitive architectures ===
{{Main|Cognitive architecture}}

The term "cognitive architecture" may refer to a theory about the structure of the human mind, or any portion or function thereof, including consciousness. In another context, a cognitive architecture implements the theory on computers. An example is ''QuBIC: Quantum and Bio-inspired Cognitive Architecture for Machine Consciousness''. One of the main goals of a cognitive architecture is to summarize the various results of cognitive psychology in a comprehensive computer model. However, the results need to be in a formalized form so they can be the basis of a computer program. Also, the role of cognitive architecture is for the A.I. to clearly structure, build, and implement it's thought process.

===Symbolic or hybrid proposals===

====Franklin's Intelligent Distribution Agent====
[[Stan Franklin]] (1995, 2003) defines an [[autonomous agent]] as possessing [[consciousness|functional consciousness]] when it is capable of several of the functions of consciousness as identified by [[Bernard Baars]]' [[Global Workspace Theory]] {{Harvs|last=Baars|year=1988|year2=1997}}. His brain child IDA (Intelligent Distribution Agent) is a software implementation of GWT, which makes it functionally conscious by definition. IDA's task is to negotiate new assignments for sailors in the [[US Navy]] after they end a tour of duty, by matching each individual's skills and preferences with the Navy's needs. IDA interacts with Navy databases and communicates with the sailors via natural language e-mail dialog while obeying a large set of Navy policies. The IDA computational model was developed during 1996–2001 at Stan Franklin's "Conscious" Software Research Group at the [[University of Memphis]]. It "consists of approximately a quarter-million lines of [[Java (programming language)|Java]] code, and almost completely consumes the resources of a 2001 high-end workstation." It relies heavily on ''codelets'', which are "special purpose, relatively independent, mini-agent[s] typically implemented as a small piece of code running as a separate thread." In IDA's top-down architecture, high-level cognitive functions are explicitly modeled (see {{Harvnb|Franklin|1995}} and {{Harvnb|Franklin|2003}} for details). While IDA is functionally conscious by definition, Franklin does "not attribute [[consciousness|phenomenal consciousness]] to his own 'conscious' software agent, IDA, in spite of her many human-like behaviours. This in spite of watching several US Navy detailers repeatedly nodding their heads saying 'Yes, that's how I do it' while watching IDA's internal and external actions as she performs her task."

====Ron Sun's cognitive architecture CLARION====
[[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|CLARION]] posits a two-level representation that explains the distinction between conscious and unconscious mental processes.

CLARION has been successful in accounting for a variety of psychological data. A number of well-known skill learning tasks have been simulated using CLARION that span the spectrum ranging from simple reactive skills to complex cognitive skills. The tasks include serial reaction time (SRT) tasks, artificial grammar learning (AGL) tasks, process control (PC) tasks, the categorical inference (CI) task, the alphabetical arithmetic (AA) task, and the Tower of Hanoi (TOH) task {{Harv|Sun|2002}}. Among them, SRT, AGL, and PC are typical implicit learning tasks, very much relevant to the issue of consciousness as they operationalized the notion of consciousness in the context of psychological experiments.

====Ben Goertzel's OpenCog====
[[Ben Goertzel]] is pursuing an embodied AGI through the open-source [[OpenCog]] project. Current code includes embodied virtual pets capable of learning simple English-language commands, as well as integration with real-world robotics, being done at the [[Hong Kong Polytechnic University]].

===Connectionist proposals===

====Haikonen's cognitive architecture====
Pentti {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2003}} considers classical rule-based computing inadequate for achieving AC: "the brain is definitely not a computer. Thinking is not an execution of programmed strings of commands. The brain is not a numerical calculator either. We do not think by numbers." Rather than trying to achieve [[mind]] and [[consciousness]] by identifying and implementing their underlying computational rules, Haikonen proposes "a special [[cognitive architecture]] to reproduce the processes of [[perception]], [[Mental image|inner imagery]], [[Intrapersonal communication|inner speech]], [[pain]], [[pleasure]], [[emotions]] and the [[cognitive]] functions behind these. This bottom-up architecture would produce higher-level functions by the power of the elementary processing units, the [[artificial neuron]]s, without [[algorithms]] or [[computer program|programs]]". Haikonen believes that, when implemented with sufficient complexity, this architecture will develop consciousness, which he considers to be "a style and way of operation, characterized by distributed signal representation, perception process, cross-modality reporting and availability for retrospection." Haikonen is not alone in this process view of consciousness, or the view that AC will spontaneously emerge in [[autonomous agent]]s that have a suitable neuro-inspired architecture of complexity; these are shared by many, e.g. {{Harvtxt|Freeman|1999}} and {{Harvtxt|Cotterill|2003}}. A low-complexity implementation of the architecture proposed by {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2003}} was reportedly not capable of AC, but did exhibit emotions as expected. See {{Harvtxt|Doan|2009}} for a comprehensive introduction to Haikonen's cognitive architecture. An updated account of Haikonen's architecture, along with a summary of his philosophical views, is given in {{Harvtxt|Haikonen|2012}}.

====Shanahan's cognitive architecture====
[[Murray Shanahan]] describes a cognitive architecture that combines Baars's idea of a global workspace with a mechanism for internal simulation ("imagination") {{Harv|Shanahan|2006}}. For discussions of Shanahan's architecture, see {{Harv|Gamez|2008}} and {{Harv|Reggia|2013}} and Chapter 20 of {{Harv|Haikonen|2012}}.

====Takeno's self-awareness research====
Self-awareness in robots is being investigated by Junichi Takeno&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://robonable.typepad.jp/robot/2_/index.html |title=Robot |accessdate=2007-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703091242/http://robonable.typepad.jp/robot/2_/index.html |archivedate=2007-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Meiji University]] in Japan. Takeno is asserting that he has developed a robot capable of discriminating between a self-image in a mirror and any other having an identical image to it,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rs.cs.meiji.ac.jp/Takeno_Archive.html Takeno - Archive No...]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090203193304/http://www.mimed.mw.tum.de/06-12-18_MIMED_LUETH-002918.PDF The world first self-aware robot and The success of mirror image cognition], Takeno&lt;/ref&gt; and this claim has already been reviewed {{Harv|Takeno|Inaba|Suzuki|2005}}. Takeno asserts that he first contrived the computational module called a MoNAD, which has a self-aware function, and he then constructed the artificial consciousness system by formulating the relationships between emotions, feelings and reason by connecting the modules in a hierarchy (Igarashi, Takeno 2007). Takeno completed a mirror image cognition experiment using a robot equipped with the MoNAD system. Takeno proposed the Self-Body Theory stating that "humans feel that their own mirror image is closer to themselves than an actual part of themselves." The most important point in developing artificial consciousness or clarifying human consciousness is the development of a function of self awareness, and he claims that he has demonstrated physical and mathematical evidence for this in his thesis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s2is.org/Issues/v1/n4/papers/paper4.pdf A Robot Succeeds in 100% Mirror Image Cognition], Takeno, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He also demonstrated that robots can study episodes in memory where the emotions were stimulated and use this experience to take predictive actions to prevent the recurrence of unpleasant emotions (Torigoe, Takeno 2009).

====Aleksander's impossible mind====
[[Igor Aleksander]], emeritus professor of Neural Systems Engineering at [[Imperial College]], has extensively researched [[artificial neural network]]s and claims in his book ''Impossible Minds: My Neurons, My Consciousness'' that the principles for creating a conscious machine already exist but that it would take forty years to train such a machine to understand [[language]].&lt;ref&gt;Aleksander I (1996) ''Impossible Minds: My Neurons, My Consciousness'', Imperial College Press {{ISBN|1-86094-036-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether this is true remains to be demonstrated and the basic principle stated in ''Impossible Minds''—that the brain is a [[finite state machine|neural state machine]]—is open to doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilson | first1 = RJ | year = 1998 | title = review of ''Impossible Minds'' | url = | journal = Journal of Consciousness Studies | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 115–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thaler's Creativity Machine Paradigm====
Stephen Thaler proposed a possible connection between consciousness and creativity in his 1994 patent, called "Device for the Autonomous Generation of Useful Information" (DAGUI),&lt;ref name="dagui"&gt;Thaler, S.L., "[https://web.archive.org/web/20170313064154/http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=5659666.PN.&amp;OS=PN%2F5659666&amp;RS=PN%2F5659666 Device for the autonomous generation of useful information]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marupaka | first1 = N. | last2 = Lyer | first2 = L. | last3 = Minai | first3 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Connectivity and thought: The influence of semantic network structure in a neurodynamical model of thinking | url = http://www.ece.uc.edu/~aminai/papers/marupaka_creativity_NN12.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Neural Networks | volume =  32| issue = | pages =  147–158| doi = 10.1016/j.neunet.2012.02.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roque, R. and Barreira, A.

==== Michael Graziano's attention schema ====
{{Main|Michael Graziano#The brain basis of consciousness}}

In 2011, [[Michael Graziano]] and Sabine Kastler published a paper named "Human consciousness and its relationship to social neuroscience: A novel hypothesis" proposing a theory of consciousness as an attention schema.&lt;ref name="Graziano, A novel hypothesis"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graziano|first1=Michael|title=Human consciousness and its relationship to social neuroscience: A novel hypothesis|journal=Corn Neurosci.|date=1 January 2011|volume=2|issue=2|pages=98–113|pmc=3223025|doi=10.1080/17588928.2011.565121|pmid=22121395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Graziano went on to publish an expanded discussion of this theory in his book "Consciousness and the Social Brain".&lt;ref name="Graziano Consciousness and the Social Brain"/&gt; This Attention Schema Theory of Consciousness, as he named it, proposes that the brain tracks attention to various sensory inputs by way of  an attention schema, analogous to the well study body schema that tracks the spatial place of a person's body.&lt;ref name="Graziano Consciousness and the Social Brain"/&gt;  This relates to artificial consciousness by proposing a specific mechanism of information handling, that produces what we allegedly experience and describe as consciousness, and which should be able to be duplicated by a machine using current technology. When the brain finds that person X is aware of thing Y, it is in effect modeling the state in which person X is applying an attentional enhancement to Y. In the attention schema theory, the same process can be applied to oneself. The brain tracks attention to various sensory inputs, and one's own awareness is a schematized model of one's attention. Graziano proposes specific locations in the brain for this process, and suggests that such awareness is a computed feature constructed by an expert system in the brain.

== Testing ==
The most well-known method for testing machine [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] is the [[Turing test]]. But when interpreted as only observational, this test contradicts the philosophy of science principles of [[Theory-ladenness|theory dependence of observations]]. It also has been suggested that Alan Turing's recommendation of imitating not a human adult consciousness, but a human child consciousness, should be taken seriously.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~itamar/Papers/AI_MAG_2011.pdf Mapping the Landscape of Human-Level Artificial General Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tests, such as [http://www.conscious-robots.com/consscale ConsScale], test the presence of features inspired by biological systems, or measure the cognitive development of artificial systems.

Qualia, or phenomenological consciousness, is an inherently first-person phenomenon. Although various systems may display various signs of behavior correlated with functional consciousness, there is no conceivable way in which third-person tests can have access to first-person phenomenological features. Because of that, and because there is no empirical definition of consciousness,&lt;ref&gt;"Consciousness". In Honderich T. The Oxford companion to philosophy. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-926479-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a test of presence of consciousness in AC may be impossible.

In 2014, Victor Argonov suggested a non-Turing test for machine consciousness based on machine's ability to produce philosophical judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Victor Argonov |title=Experimental Methods for Unraveling the Mind-body Problem: The Phenomenal Judgment Approach |journal=Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=35 |year=2014 | pages=51–70 | url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ARGMAA-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that a deterministic machine must be regarded as conscious if it is able to produce judgments on all problematic properties of consciousness (such as qualia or binding) having no innate (preloaded) philosophical knowledge on these issues, no philosophical discussions while learning, and no informational models of other creatures in its memory (such models may implicitly or explicitly contain knowledge about these creatures’ consciousness). However, this test can be used only to detect, but not refute the existence of consciousness. A positive result proves that machine is conscious but a negative result proves nothing. For example, absence of philosophical judgments may be caused by lack of the machine’s intellect, not by absence of consciousness.

There are definitions that state it as: “the body of rules, principles, or standards accepted as axiomatic and universally binding in a field of study or art”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/canon |title=Define Canon|publisher=Dictionary.reference.com|date= |accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be related to such topics as literary canons or the canons of rhetoric, which is a topic within itself that describes the rules of giving a speech. There are five key principles, and when grouped together, are the principles set for giving speeches as seen with regard to [[Rhetoric]].

'''Christianity and domestic violence''' deals with the debate in Christian communities in relation to the recognition and response to [[domestic violence]], which is complicated by a culture of silence and acceptance among abuse victims. There are some Bible verses that abusers use to justify discipline of their wives.

==Abuse within marriage==
{{main|Gender roles in Christianity}}
[[Christianity|Christian]] groups and authorities generally condemn [[domestic violence]] as inconsistent with the general Christian duty to love others and to the scriptural relationship between husband and wife.&lt;ref name=stct&gt;Tracy, Steven. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/february/5.50.html "Headship with a Heart: How biblical patriarchy actually prevents abuse"]. ''[[Christianity Today]]'' (February 2003). (Accessed January 3, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship between husband and wife===

According to the [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]], "Men who abuse often use Ephesians 5:22, taken out of context, to justify their behavior, but the passage (v. 21-33) refers to the mutual submission of husband and wife out of love for Christ. Husbands should love their wives as they love their own body, as Christ loves the Church."&lt;ref name=usccbwi/&gt;

Some Christian theologians, such as the Rev. Marie Fortune and Mary Pellauer, have raised the question of a close connection between patriarchal Christianity and domestic violence and abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Child in Christian Thought|editor1-first=Marcia J. | editor1-last = Bunge | editor1-link=Marcia Bunge|pages=462|year=2001|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=0-8028-4693-9|author=Bonnie J. Miller-McLemore|chapter="Let the Children Come" Revisited: Contemporary Feminist Theologians on Children}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kroeger, Catherine Clark Kroeger; Beck, James Beck (ed). (1996). ''Women, Abuse and the Bible.'' Grand Rapids: Baker.&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Tracy, author of "Patriarchy and Domestic Violence" writes: "While patriarchy may not be the overarching cause of all abuse, it is an enormously significant factor, because in traditional patriarchy males have a disproportionate share of power... So while patriarchy is not the sole explanation for violence against women, we would expect that male headship would be distorted by insecure, unhealthy men to justify their domination and abuse of women."&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, Steven. (2007). Patriarchy and Domestic Violence: Challenging Common Misconceptions. ''Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society.'' 50(3):580-583.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few empirical studies have examined the relationship between religion and domestic violence,&lt;ref name=wilcox&gt;Wilcox, William Bradford. ''Soft Patriarchs, New Men: How Christianity Shapes Fathers and Husbands''. [[University of Chicago Press]] (2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=s0cY1rWfxKUC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;sig=JEppuMBRuDKRQsIY5ZxLZHroYy8 p181-82]. {{ISBN|0-226-89709-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dutton, no single factor explanation for wife assault was sufficient to explain the available data.{{refn|"During the late 1970's a number of single factor explanations for male assaultiveness toward women were proffered. These included sociobiology, psychiatric disorders and patriarchy (Dutton, 1988). Dutton argued that no single factor explanation for wife assault sufficiently explained the available data and proposed instead a nested ecological theory examining interactive effects of the broader culture (macrosystem), the subculture (exosystem), the family (microsystem) and individual characteristics (ontogeny)."|group=nb}}{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} A study by Dutton and Browning in the same year found that misogyny is correlated with only a minority of abusive male partners.{{refn|"Only a minority of batterers are misogynistic (Dutton and Browning, 1988), and few are violent to non-intimate women; a much larger group experiences extreme anger about intimacy."|group=nb}}{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Campbell's study in 1992 found no evidence of greater violence towards women in more patriarchal cultures. Pearson's study in 1997 observed "Studies of male batterers have failed to confirm that these men are more conservative or sexist about marriage than nonviolent men".{{refn|"‘Patricia Pearson (p. 132) points out: That men have used a patriarchal vocabulary to account for themselves doesn't mean that patriarchy causes their violence, any more than being patriarchs prevents them from being victimized. Studies of male batterers have failed to confirm that these men are more conservative or sexist about marriage than nonviolent men. To the contrary, some of the highest rates of violence are found in the least orthodox partnerships — dating or cohabiting lovers."|group=nb}}&lt;ref name=Correy&gt;Correy, ‘The Role Of Patriarchy In Domestic Violence’ (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Responding to Domestic Abuse,'' a report issued by the Church of England in 2006, suggests that patriarchy should be replaced rather than reinterpreted: "Following the pattern of Christ means that patterns of domination and submission are being transformed in the mutuality of love, faithful care and sharing of burdens. 'Be subject to one another out of reverence for Christ'(Ephesians 5.21). Although strong patriarchal tendencies have persisted in Christianity, the example of Christ carries the seeds of their displacement by a more symmetrical and respectful model of male–female relations."&lt;ref name=ceroda&gt;The Archbishops' Council.

Church House Publishing (2006), p19. {{ISBN|0-7151-4108-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bible===
{{Main|The Bible and violence}}
[[Chapters and verses of the Bible|Bible verses]] are often used to justify domestic abuse, such as those that refer to male superiority and female submission. Others counter that the use of violence is a misinterpreted view of the male role.&lt;ref name=stct/&gt;  For instance, [[Eve]] (Genesis 2-3), is seen by some Christians{{Who|date=May 2016}} to be disobedient to patriarchal God and man, and to many a generalized symbol of womanhood that must be submissive and subject to discipline, while others{{Who|date=May 2016}} disagree with this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Pages 92-3. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian domestic discipline===
A subculture known as ''Christian domestic discipline'' (CDD) promotes [[spanking]] of wives by their husbands as a form of punishment. While its advocates rely on Biblical interpretations to support the practice, advocates for victims of domestic violence describe CDD as a form of abuse and controlling behavior. Others describe the practice as a simple [[sexual fetish]] and an outlet for [[sadomasochistic]] desires.&lt;ref name="Zadrozny"&gt;{{cite news |author=Zadrozny, Brandy |date=19 June 2013  |work=The Daily Beast |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/19/spanking-for-jesus-inside-the-unholy-world-of-christian-domestic-discipline.html |title=Spanking for Jesus: Inside the Unholy World of ‘Christian Domestic Discipline’}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christan-conservative radio host [[Bryan Fischer]] said to the ''Huffington Post'' that it was a "horrifying trend{{snd}}bizarre, twisted, unbiblical and un-Christian"&lt;ref name="Bennett-Smith"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/christian-domestic-discipline-spanking-jesus-marriage_n_3479646 |title=Christian Domestic Discipline Promotes Spanking Wives To Maintain Biblical Marriage |work=Huffpost |date=21 June 2013 |author=Bennett-Smith, Meredith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to abuse===
There are a variety of responses by Christian leaders to how victims should handle abuse:
* Marjorie Proctor-Smith in "Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook" states that domestic [[physical abuse|physical]], [[Psychological abuse|psychological]] or [[Sexual abuse|sexual]] violence is a [[sin]].  It victimizes family members dependent on a man and violates trust needed for healthy, equitable and cooperative relationships.  She finds that domestic violence is symptom of [[sexism]], a social sin.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Pages 428-9. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]] said in 2002, "As pastors of the Catholic Church in the United States, we state as clearly and strongly as we can that violence against women, inside or outside the home, is never justified."&lt;ref name=usccbwi&gt;[http://www.usccb.org/laity/help.shtml "When I Call for Help: A Pastoral Response to Domestic Violence Against Women"]. [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] (November 12, 2002). {{ISBN|1-57455-509-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Church of England's report, ''Responding to Domestic Abuse'' advises that Christian pastors and counselors should not advise victims to make forgiving the perpetrator the top priority "when the welfare and safety of the person being abused are at stake."&lt;ref name=ceroda/&gt;
* Significant numbers of Christian [[pastor]]s ordinarily would tell a woman being abused that she should continue to submit and to "trust that God would honor her action by either stopping the abuse or giving her the strength to endure it" and  would never advise a battered wife to leave her husband or separate because of abuse.&lt;ref name="christianitytoday"&gt;Alsdurf, James and Alsdurf, Phyllis, ''Battered into Submission'', Wipf and Stock, 1998, as cited in Tracy, Steven, [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/article_print.html?id=8902 "Headship with a Heart: How biblical patriarchy actually prevents abuse"], ''[[Christianity Today]]'', February 2003, accessed January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; One mid-1980s survey of 5,700 pastors found that 26 percent of pastors ordinarily would tell a woman being abused that she should continue to submit and to "trust that God would honor her action by either stopping the abuse or giving her the strength to endure it" and that 71 percent of pastors would never advise a battered wife to leave her husband or separate because of abuse.&lt;ref name="christianitytoday" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grady, J. Lee [http://www.newmanmag.com/display.php?id=818 "Control Freaks, and the Women Who Love Them"]. ''[[New Man (Christian magazine)|New Man]]'' magazine (Jan/Feb 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributing factor to the disparity of responses to abuse is lack of training, many Christian seminaries had not educated future church leaders about how to manage violence against women.  Once pastors began receiving training, and announced their participation in domestic violence educational programs, they immediately began receiving visits from women church members who had been subject to violence.  The first Theological Education and Domestic Violence Conference, sponsored by the Center for the Prevention of Sexual and Domestic Violence, was held in 1985 to identify topics that should be covered in seminaries.  First, church leaders will encounter sexual and domestic violence and they need to know what community resources are available.  Secondly, they need to focus on ending the violence, rather than on keeping families together.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Page 10. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American religious news-magazine ''[[Christianity Today]]'' has published articles lamenting U.S. churches for possibly making domestic abuse worse "not in incidence, but in response" due to inadequate understandings. In December 2017, academic [[W. Bradford Wilcox]] wrote for the publication, "Domestic violence is still present in church-going homes... some local churches, clergy, and counselors fail to address abuse head-on for fear of breaking up a marriage." He also argued, "Others steer clear of addressing the topic from the pulpit or in adult education for fear of broaching an uncomfortable subject. This silence around domestic violence has to end."&lt;ref name="Wilcox"&gt;https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2017/december-web-only/evangelicals-domestic-violence-christian-men-domestic-abuse.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research into incidences of domestic violence==
In the 1970s, when multiple programs were initiated to train church leaders about domestic violence, the response "''But no one ever comes to me with this problem''" often came up to frustrate efforts. Church leaders frequently believed that if no one reached out for assistance within their congregations that there was no problem for them to deal with; however, women often withheld discussing their problems over concern that it would not be handled appropriately.  [[Ordination of women|When women increasingly became pastors]] over the 20th century, many of them found that much of their time became devoted to handling domestic abuse and other forms of violence against women; "crisis intervention" became a vital topic for them.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J.; Fortune, Mary M. (1998). ''Violence against women and children: a Christian Theological Sourcebook.'' New York: The Continuum Publishing Company. Page 9, 428. {{ISBN|0-8264-0830-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[List of regions of the United States|regions of the United States]], research has speculated that local societies with a general [[Culture of violence theory|culture of violence]] and low [[socio-economic status]], which may also be at least nominally religious, are more likely to produce abusive men. The role of working-class [[Scots-Irish American]] culture in areas such as [[Appalachia]] is cited.&lt;ref name=Wilcox/&gt;

Differing viewpoints between husband and wife may be an aggravating factor in terms of abuse, particularly when women hold beliefs in contrast to more ideologically hardline men.&lt;ref name=Wilcox/&gt;

[[File:Identical cladograms.svg|thumb|250px|Two vertical cladograms, the root at the bottom]] 
A '''cladogram''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''clados'' "branch" and ''gramma'' "character") is a diagram used in [[cladistics]] to show relations among organisms. A cladogram is not, however, an [[evolutionary tree]] because it does not show how ancestors are related to descendants, nor does it show how much they have changed; many evolutionary trees can be inferred from a single cladogram.&lt;ref name=mayr&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0469.1974.tb00160.x |title=Cladistic analysis or cladistic classification? |journal=Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research |volume=12 |pages=94–128 |year=2009 |last1=Mayr |first1=Ernst }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Foote&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Mike |last1=Foote |date=Spring 1996 |title=On the Probability of Ancestors in the Fossil Record |journal=Paleobiology |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=141–51 |jstor=2401114}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dayrat&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Benoît |last1=Dayrat |date=Summer 2005 |title=Ancestor-Descendant Relationships and the Reconstruction of the Tree of Life |journal=Paleobiology |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=347–53 |jstor=4096939 |doi=10.1666/0094-8373(2005)031[0347:aratro]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PC&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(00)02026-7 |title=Intraspecific gene genealogies: Trees grafting into networks |journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=16 |pages=37–45 |year=2001 |last1=Posada |first1=David |last2=Crandall |first2=Keith A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Podani&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2012.00423.x |title=Tree thinking, time and topology: Comments on the interpretation of tree diagrams in evolutionary/phylogenetic systematics |journal=Cladistics |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=315–327 |year=2013 |last1=Podani |first1=János |url=http://real.mtak.hu/9727/1/PodaniOnTreesFINAL.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A cladogram uses lines that branch off in different directions ending at a [[clade]], a group of organisms with a [[last common ancestor]]. There are many shapes of cladograms but they all have lines that branch off from other lines.  The lines can be traced back to where they branch off.  These branching off points represent a hypothetical ancestor (not an actual entity) which can be inferred to exhibit the traits shared among the terminal taxa above it.&lt;ref name=PC /&gt;&lt;ref name=sc&gt;{{cite book |first1=Randall T. |last1=Schuh |year=2000 |title=Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications |isbn=978-0-8014-3675-8}}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This hypothetical ancestor might then provide clues about the order of evolution of various features, adaptation, and other evolutionary narratives about ancestors.  Although traditionally such cladograms were generated largely on the basis of morphological characters, [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] sequencing data and [[computational phylogenetics]] are now very commonly used in the generation of cladograms, either on their own or in combination with morphology.

==Generating a cladogram==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}

===Molecular versus morphological data===

The characteristics used to create a cladogram can be roughly categorized as either morphological (synapsid skull, warm blooded, [[notochord]], unicellular, etc.) or molecular (DNA, RNA, or other genetic information).&lt;ref name="DeSalle"&gt;{{cite book |last=DeSalle |first=Rob |year=2002 |title=Techniques in Molecular Systematics and Evolution |publisher=Birkhauser |isbn=3-7643-6257-X}}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the advent of DNA sequencing, cladistic analysis primarily used morphological data.  Behavioral data (for animals) may also be used.&lt;ref name="Wenzel"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wenzel |first=John W. |year=1992  |title=Behavioral homology and phylogeny  |journal=Annu. Rev. Ecol. Syst. |volume=23 |pages=361–381 |doi=10.1146/annurev.es.23.110192.002045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[DNA sequencing]] has become cheaper and easier, [[molecular systematics]] has become a more and more popular way to infer phylogenetic hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hillis|first=David|title=Molecular Systematics |year=1996 |publisher=Sinaur|isbn=0-87893-282-8 |authorlink=David Hillis}}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a parsimony criterion is only one of several methods to infer a phylogeny from molecular data. Approaches such as [[maximum likelihood]], which incorporate explicit models of sequence evolution, are non-Hennigian ways to evaluate sequence data. Another powerful method of reconstructing phylogenies is the use of genomic [[retrotransposon marker]]s, which are thought to be less prone to the problem of [[reversion (genetics)|reversion]] that plagues sequence data. They are also generally assumed to have a low incidence of homoplasies because it was once thought that their integration into the [[genome]] was entirely random; this seems at least sometimes not to be the case, however.

[[Image:Cladistics-Apomorphy.png|thumb|250px|[[Apomorphy]] in cladistics.  This diagram indicates "A" and "C" as ancestral states, and "B", "D" and "E" as states that are present in terminal taxa.  Note that in practice, ancestral conditions are not known ''a priori'' (as shown in this heuristic example), but must be inferred from the pattern of shared states observed in the terminals.  Given that each terminal in this example has a unique state, in reality we would not be able to infer anything conclusive about the ancestral states (other than the fact that the existence of unobserved states "A" and "C" would be unparsimonious inferences!)]]

===Plesiomorphies and synapomorphies===

Researchers must decide which character states are "ancestral" (''[[plesiomorphy|plesiomorphies]]'') and which are derived (''[[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]]''), because only synapomorphic character states provide evidence of grouping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hennig |first=Willi |title=Phylogenetic Systematics |year=1966 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |authorlink=Willi Hennig}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This determination is usually done by comparison to the character states of one or more ''outgroups''.  States shared between the outgroup and some members of the in-group are symplesiomorphies; states that are present only in a subset of the in-group are synapomorphies.  Note that character states unique to a single terminal (autapomorphies) do not provide evidence of grouping.  The choice of an outgroup is a crucial step in cladistic analysis because different outgroups can produce trees with profoundly different topologies.

===Homoplasies===

A [[homoplasy]] is a character state that is shared by two or more taxa due to some cause ''other'' than common ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=West-Eberhard|first=Mary Jane| authorlink=Mary Jane West-Eberhard | title=Developmental Plasticity and Evolution |pages=353–376| year=2003 |publisher=Oxford Univ. Press | isbn=0-19-512235-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main types of homoplasy are convergence (evolution of the "same" character in at least two distinct lineages) and reversion (the return to an ancestral character state). Characters that are obviously homoplastic, such as white fur in different lineages of Arctic mammals, should not be included as a character in a phylogenetic analysis as they do not contribute anything to our understanding of relationships.  However, homoplasy is often not evident from inspection of the character itself (as in DNA sequence, for example), and is then detected by its incongruence (unparsimonious distribution) on a most-parsimonious cladogram.  Note that characters that are homoplastic may still contain phylogenetic signal.&lt;ref&gt;Källersjö, M., V. A. Albert, and J. S. Farris. 1999. Homoplasy increases phylogenetic structure. Cladistics 15:91-94.
&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known example of homoplasy due to convergent evolution would be the character, "presence of wings". Although the wings of birds, [[bat]]s, and insects serve the same function, each evolved independently, as can be seen by their [[anatomy]]. If a bird, bat, and a winged insect were scored for the character, "presence of wings", a homoplasy would be introduced into the dataset, and this could potentially confound the analysis, possibly resulting in a false hypothesis of relationships.  Of course, the only reason a homoplasy is recognizable in the first place is because there are other characters that imply a pattern of relationships that reveal its homoplastic distribution.

===What is not a cladogram===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}
A cladogram is the diagrammatic result of an analysis, which groups taxa on the basis of synapomorphies alone.  There are many other phylogenetic algorithms that treat data somewhat differently, and result in phylogenetic trees that look like cladograms but are not cladograms.  For example, phenetic algorithms, such as UPGMA and Neighbor-Joining, group by overall similarity, and treat both synapomorphies and symplesiomorphies as evidence of grouping,  The resulting diagrams are phenograms, not cladograms,  Similarly, the results of model-based methods (Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian approaches) that take into account both branching order and "branch length," count both synapomorphies and autapomorphies as evidence for or against grouping,  The diagrams resulting from those sorts of analysis are not cladograms, either.&lt;ref&gt;Brower, A. V. Z. 2016. What is a cladogram and what is not? Cladistics 32:573-576.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cladogram selection===
There are several [[algorithms]] available to identify the "best" cladogram.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|

}}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Most algorithms use a [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] to measure how consistent a candidate cladogram is with the data. Most cladogram algorithms use the mathematical techniques of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and minimization.

In general, cladogram generation algorithms must be implemented as computer programs, although some algorithms can be performed manually when the data sets are modest (for example, just a few species and a couple of characteristics).

Some algorithms are useful only when the characteristic data are molecular (DNA, RNA); other algorithms are useful only when the characteristic data are morphological. Other algorithms can be used when the characteristic data includes both molecular and morphological data.

Algorithms for cladograms or other types of phylogenetic trees include [[least squares]], [[neighbor-joining]], [[Occam's razor|parsimony]], [[maximum likelihood]], and [[Bayesian inference]].

Biologists sometimes use the term [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimony]] for a specific kind of cladogram generation algorithm and sometimes as an umbrella term for all phylogenetic algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/361603a0 |pmid=8437621 |title=The powers and pitfalls of parsimony |journal=Nature |volume=361 |issue=6413 |pages=603–7 |year=1993 |last1=Stewart |first1=Caro-Beth |bibcode=1993Natur.361..603S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorithms that perform optimization tasks (such as building cladograms) can be sensitive to the order in which the input data (the list of species and their characteristics) is presented. Inputting the data in various orders can cause the same algorithm to produce different "best" cladograms. In these situations, the user should input the data in various orders and compare the results.

Using different algorithms on a single data set can sometimes yield different "best" cladograms, because each algorithm may have a unique definition of what is "best".

Because of the astronomical number of possible cladograms, algorithms cannot guarantee that the solution is the overall best solution. A nonoptimal cladogram will be selected if the program settles on a local minimum rather than the desired global minimum.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; To help solve this problem, many cladogram algorithms use a [[simulated annealing]] approach to increase the likelihood that the selected cladogram is the optimal one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.1999.tb00277.x |title=The Parsimony Ratchet, a New Method for Rapid Parsimony Analysis |journal=Cladistics |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=407–414 |year=1999 |last1=Nixon |first1=Kevin C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal position]] is the direction of the base (or root) of a rooted phylogenetic tree or cladogram. A basal clade is the earliest clade (of a given taxonomic rank[a]) to branch within a larger clade.

===Incongruence length difference test (or partition homogeneity test)===

The incongruence length difference test (ILD) is a measurement of how the combination of different datasets (e.g. morphological and molecular, plastid and nuclear genes) contributes to a longer tree. It is measured by first calculating the total tree length of each partition and summing them. Then replicates are made by making randomly assembled partitions consisting of the original partitions. The lengths are summed. A p value of 0.01 is obtained for 100 replicates if 99 replicates have longer combined tree lengths.

===Measuring homoplasy===
{{Further|Convergent evolution}}
Some measures attempt to measure the amount of homoplasy in a dataset with reference to a tree,&lt;ref&gt;reviewed in {{cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-012618030-5/50008-3 |chapter=Measures of Homoplasy |title=Homoplasy |pages=153–188 |year=1996 |last1=Archie |first1=James W. |editor-first=Michael J. |editor-last=Sanderson |editor-first2=Larry |editor-last2=Hufford |isbn=9780126180305}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is not necessarily clear precisely what property these measures aim to quantify&lt;ref&gt;CHANG, J. T. and KIM, J. 1996. The measurement of homoplasy: a stochastic view. In SANDERSON, M. J. and HUFFORD, L. (eds.) Homoplasy: The Recurrence of Similarity in Evolution, Academic Press, 189–203 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consistency index====

The consistency index (CI) measures the consistency of a tree to a set of data – a measure of the minimum amount of homoplasy implied by the tree.&lt;ref name="KLUGE, A. G 1969"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kluge | first1 = A. G. | last2 = Farris | first2 = J. S. | year = 1969 | title = Quantitative Phyletics and the Evolution of Anurans | url = | journal = Systematic Zoology | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 1–32 | doi=10.2307/2412407}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is calculated by counting the minimum number of changes in a dataset and dividing it by the actual number of changes needed for the cladogram.&lt;ref name="KLUGE, A. G 1969"/&gt;  A consistency index can also be calculated for an individual character ''i'', denoted c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;.

Besides reflecting the amount of homoplasy, the metric also reflects the number of taxa in the dataset,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Archie | first1 = J. W. | last2 = Felsenstein | first2 = J. | year = 1993 | title = The Number of Evolutionary Steps on Random and Minimum Length Trees for Random Evolutionary Data | url = | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 52–79 | doi = 10.1006/tpbi.1993.1003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (to a lesser extent) the number of characters in a dataset,&lt;ref name="ARCHIE, J. W 1989"/&gt; the degree to which each character carries phylogenetic information,&lt;ref name="Jennifer F p C"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2009.00270.x|title=A formula for maximum possible steps in multistate characters: Isolating matrix parameter effects on measures of evolutionary convergence|journal=Cladistics|volume=26|pages=98–102|year=2010|last1=Hoyal Cuthill|first1=Jennifer F.|last2=Braddy|first2=Simon J.|last3=Donoghue|first3=Philip C. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fashion in which additive characters are coded, rendering it unfit for purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sanderson | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Donoghue | first2 = M. J. | year = 1989 | title = Patterns of variations in levels of homoplasy | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 43 | issue = | pages = 1781–1795 | doi=10.2307/2409392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; occupies a range from 1 to 1/[''n.taxa''/2] in binary characters with an even state distribution; its minimum value is larger when states are not evenly spread.&lt;ref name="Jennifer F p C"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Archie1996 /&gt;

====Retention index====

The retention index (RI) was proposed as an improvement of the CI "for certain applications"&lt;ref name="FARRIS, J. S 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Farris | first1 = J. S. | year = 1989 | title = The retention index and the rescaled consistency index | url = | journal = Cladistics | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 417–419 | doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.1989.tb00573.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This metric also purports to measure of the amount of homoplasy, but also measures how well synapomorphies explain the tree. It is calculated taking the (maximum number of changes on a tree minus the number of changes on the tree), and dividing by the (maximum number of changes on the tree minus the minimum number of changes in the dataset).

The rescaled consistency index (RC) is obtained by multiplying the CI by the RI; in effect this stretches the range of the CI such that its minimum theoretically attainable value is rescaled to 0, with its maximum remaining at 1.&lt;ref name=Archie1996&gt;ARCHIE, J. W. 1996. Measures of homoplasy. In Homoplasy, Elsevier, 153–188 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FARRIS, J. S 1989"/&gt; The homoplasy index (HI) is simply 1 &amp;minus; CI.

==== Homoplasy Excess Ratio ====

This measures the amount of homoplasy observed on a tree relative to the maximum amount of homoplasy that could theoretically be present – 1 &amp;minus; (observed homoplasy excess) / (maximum homoplasy excess).&lt;ref name="ARCHIE, J. W 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Archie | first1 = J. W. | year = 1989 | title = HOMOPLASY EXCESS RATIOS : NEW INDICES FOR MEASURING LEVELS OF HOMOPLASY IN PHYLOGENETIC SYSTEMATICS AND A CRITIQUE OF THE CONSISTENCY INDEX | url = | journal = Systematic Zoology | volume = 38 | issue = | pages = 253–269 | doi=10.2307/2992286}}&lt;/ref&gt; A value of 1 indicates no homoplasy; 0 represents as much homoplasy as there would be in a fully random dataset, and negative values indicate more homoplasy still (and tend only to occur in contrived examples).&lt;ref name="ARCHIE, J. W 1989"/&gt;  The HER is presented as the best measure of homoplasy currently available.&lt;ref name=Archie1996/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2014.10.033|pmid=25451518|title=The size of the character state space affects the occurrence and detection of homoplasy: Modelling the probability of incompatibility for unordered phylogenetic characters|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|volume=366|pages=24–32|year=2015|last1=Hoyal Cuthill|first1=Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Compassion''' motivates people to go out of their way to help the physical, mental, or emotional pains of another and themselves. Compassion is often regarded as having sensitivity, an emotional aspect to suffering, though when based on cerebral notions such as fairness, justice, and interdependence, it may be considered rational in nature and its application understood as an activity also based on sound judgment. There is also an aspect of equal dimension, such that individual's compassion is often given a property of "depth", "vigour", or "[[passion (emotion)|passion]]". The etymology of "compassion" is Latin, meaning "co-suffering." Compassion involves "feeling for another" and is a precursor to [[empathy]], the "feeling as another" capacity for better person centered acts of active compassion; in common parlance active compassion is the [[desire (emotion)|desire]] to alleviate another's suffering.&lt;ref name="sjsl"&gt;Sherlyn Jimenez, see article on ''Compassion'', The Encyclopedia of Positive Psychology, Volume I, Editor: Shane Lopez, Wiley-Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-6125-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compassion involves allowing ourselves to be moved by suffering, and experiencing the motivation to help alleviate and prevent it. An act of compassion is defined by its [[helpfulness]]. Qualities of compassion are patience and wisdom; kindness and perseverance; warmth and resolve. It is often, though not inevitably, the key component in what manifests in the social context as [[altruism]]. Expression of compassion is prone to be hierarchical, paternalistic and controlling in responses.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2010"/&gt; Difference between sympathy and compassion is that the former responds to suffering with sorrow and concern while the latter responds with warmth and care.&lt;ref name="CompInteg"/&gt;

The English [[noun]] ''compassion'', meaning ''to love together with'', comes from [[Latin]]. Its [[prefix]] ''com-'' comes directly from ''com'', an archaic version of the Latin [[preposition]] and affix [[wikt:cum|cum]] (= with); the ''-passion'' segment is derived from ''passus'', [[past participle]] of the [[deponent verb]] [[wikt:patior|patior, patī, passus sum]]. Compassion is thus related in origin, form and meaning to the English noun [[patient]] (= one who suffers), from ''patiens'', [[present participle]] of the same [[wikt:patior|patior]], and is akin to the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] verb πάσχειν (= ''paskhein'', to suffer) and to its [[cognate]] noun [[wikt:πάθος|πάθος]] (= [[pathos]]).&lt;ref name="newSOED"&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Lesley |title=The New shorter Oxford English dictionary on historical principles |publisher=Clarendon |location=Oxford [Eng.] |year=2002 |pages= |isbn=0-19-861271-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Partridge"&gt;{{cite book |author=Partridge, Eric |title=Origins: a short etymological dictionary of modern English |publisher=Macmillan |location=New York |year=1966 |pages= |isbn=0-02-594840-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranked a great virtue in numerous [[philosophy|philosophies]], compassion is considered in almost all the major [[religion|religious traditions]] as among the greatest of [[virtue]]s.

== Theories ==
Theoretical perspectives of compassion have been developed through the years, the following three proposed perspectives show contrasts in their evolution and approaches to compassion.
:* Compassion is simply a variation of love or sadness, not a distinct emotion.&lt;ref name="Shaver et. al: Emotion Knowledge"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaver|first=P|author2=J Schwartz |author3=D Kirson |author4=C O'Connor |title=Emotion knowledge: further exploration of a prototype approach|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=June 1987|volume=52|issue=6|pages=1061–1086|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.6.1061 |pmid=3598857}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, compassion can be viewed as a distinct emotional state, which can be differentiated from distress, [[sadness]], and [[love]].&lt;ref name="Bowlby: Attach and loss vol. 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowlby|first=John|title=Attachment: Attachment and Loss Volume One|year=1983|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Moral Emotions: Haidt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|title=The Moral Emotions|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=852–870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Social Functionalism and the Evolution of Emotions: Keltner et al"&gt;{{cite book|last=Keltner|first=Dacher|title=Social Functionalism and the Evolution of Emotions|year=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York|pages=115–142|author2=Jonathan Haidt |author3=Michelle Shiota}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Compassion as a synonym of empathic distress, which is characterized by the feeling of distress in connection with another person's suffering.&lt;ref name="Compassion: An Evolutionary Analysis and Empirical Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goetz|first=Jennifer|author2=Dacher Kelter |author3=Emiliana Simon-Thomas |title=Compassion: An Evolutionary Analysis and Empirical Review|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2010|volume=136|issue=3|pages=351–374|doi=10.1037/a0018807|pmid=20438142|pmc=2864937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ekman|first=Paul|title=Emotions Revealed: Recognizing Faces and Feelings to improve communication and emotional life|year=2003|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Company|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Martin|title=Is altruism part of human nature?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1981|volume=40|issue=1|pages=121–137|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.40.1.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective of compassion is based on the finding that people sometimes emulate and feel the emotions of people around them.&lt;ref name="Hatfield, 1993: Emotional Contagion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hatfield|first=Elaine|author2=John Cacioppo|title=Emotional Contagion|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=1993|volume=2|issue=3|pages=96–99|doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770953|last3=Rapson|first3=Richard L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more one person knows about the human condition and the associated experiences, the more vivid the route to identification with suffering becomes.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassell|first=Eric|title=Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-0-19-518724-3|pages=393–403|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Identifying with another person is an essential process for human beings, it is commonly seen throughout the world as people adapt and change with new styles of clothing, language, behavior, etc., which is even illustrated by infants who begin to mirror the facial expressions and body movements of their mother as early as the first days of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meltzoff|first=Andrew|title=The Roots of Social and Cognitive Development: Models of Man's Original Nature|journal=Social Perception in Infants|year=1985|pages=1–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personality psychology]] agrees that people are inherently different and distinct from one another, which leads to the conclusion that human suffering is always individual and unique. Suffering can result from psychological, social, and physical trauma&lt;ref name="cassell1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassell|first=Eric|title=The Healer's Art|year=1995|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-53062-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it happens in acute forms as often as chronically.&lt;ref name="cassell1995"/&gt; Due to the inherent differences in people's personalities some may define their early stages of suffering to their external circumstances and those life events being quiet or not discussed. The later stages may involve the person expressing their [[victimization]] and searching for help.&lt;ref name="Models of Point Suffering"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reich|first=Warren|title=Models of Point Suffering: Foundations for an Ethic Compassion |journal=Acta Neurochirugica|year=1987|volume=38|pages=117–122|doi=10.1007/978-3-7091-6975-9_20|series=Acta Neurochirurgica Supplementum|isbn=978-3-7091-7457-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suffering]] has been defined as the perception of a person's impending destruction or loss of integrity, which continues until the threat is vanished or the person's integrity can be restored.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; The importance of identifying with others for compassion is contrasted by the negative physical and psychological effects of [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment]]. Compassion is often a characteristic element of democratic societies.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; Compassion is recognized through identifying with other people, the knowledge of human behavior, the perception of suffering, transfer of feelings, knowledge of goal and purpose changes in sufferers, and leads to the absence of the suffering from the group.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt;

The compassion process is highly related to identifying with the other person because sympathizing with others is possible among people from other countries, cultures, locations, etc. A possible source of this process of identifying with others comes from a universal category called "Spirit." Toward the late 1970s, very different cultures and nations around the world took a turn to [[religious fundamentalism]], which has occasionally been attributed to "Spirit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hegal|first=Georg|title=Phenomenology of Spirit|year=1952|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-824597-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of compassion as a factor contributing to individual or societal behavior has been the topic of continuous debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Lee |title=Compassion and Societal Well-Being|journal=Pacific Philosophical Quarterly|date=1 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the process of identifying with other people, a complete absence of compassion may require ignoring or disapproving identification with other people or groups.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; Earlier studies established the links between interpersonal violence and cruelty which leads to indifference.&lt;ref&gt;Frank R. Ascione, Phil Arkow Child abuse, domestic violence, and animal abuse: linking the circles of compassion for prevention and intervention {{ISBN|1-55753-142-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randall Lockwood, Frank R. Ascione. Cruelty to Animals and Interpersonal Violence. Purdue University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has been illustrated throughout history: [[The Holocaust]], [[Genocide]], [[European colonization of the Americas]], etc. The seemingly essential step in these atrocities could be the defining of the victims as "not human" or "not us." The atrocities committed throughout human history have only been relieved through the presence of compassion.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alisdair|title=A Short History of Ethics|year=1966|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=0-203-13112-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compassion may have the ability to induce feelings of kindness and [[forgiveness]], which could give people the ability to stop situations that have the potential to be distressing and occasionally lead to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goetz|first=J|author2=D Keltner |author3=E Simon-Thomas  |title=Compassion: An evolutionary analysis and empirical review|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2010 |volume=136|issue=3|pages=351–374|doi=10.1037/a0018807|pmid=20438142 |pmc=2864937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychology ===
Compassion has become associated with and researched in the fields of [[positive psychology]] and social psychology &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jazaieri|first=Hooria|last2=Jinpa|first2=Geshe Thupten|last3=McGonigal|first3=Kelly|last4=Rosenberg|first4=Erika L.|last5=Finkelstein|first5=Joel|last6=Simon-Thomas|first6=Emiliana|last7=Cullen|first7=Margaret|last8=Doty|first8=James R.|last9=Gross|first9=James J.|date=2012-07-25|title=Enhancing Compassion: A Randomized Controlled Trial of a Compassion Cultivation Training Program|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-012-9373-z|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=1113–1126|doi=10.1007/s10902-012-9373-z|issn=1389-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Dalai Lama]] once said that "compassion is a necessity, not a luxury"&lt;ref name="CompInteg"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Reddy, Nanda Kishore|author2=Ajmera, Santosh|title=Ethics, Integrity and Aptitude|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLlyCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA146|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-93-5134-236-6|page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "it is a question of human survival".&lt;ref name="Lama1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=H.H. the Fourteenth Dalai Lama|title=Policy of Kindness: An Anthology of Writings by and about the Dalai Lama|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_GZ4LRsqEegC&amp;pg=PA112|year=1990|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-1-55939-769-8|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compassion is a process of connecting by identifying with another person. This identification with others through compassion can lead to increased motivation to do something in an effort to relieve the suffering of others.

Compassion is an evolved function from the harmony of a three grid internal system: contentment-and-peace system, goals-and-drives system and threat-and-safety system. Paul Gilbert defines these collectively as necessary regulated systems for compassion.&lt;ref name="Gilbert2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Gilbert|title=The Compassionate Mind: A New Approach to Life's Challenges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=krNPL6xCVL0C|year=2010|publisher=New Harbinger  Publications|isbn=978-1-57224-840-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In examination of the motivated regulation of compassion in the context of large-scale crises, such as natural disasters and genocides, much research has established that people tend to feel more compassion for single identifiable victims than large masses of victims (the [[Identifiable victim effect]]). It is found that people only show less compassion for many victims than for single victims of disasters when they expect to incur a financial cost upon helping. This [[collapse of compassion]] depends on having the motivation and ability to regulate emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron &amp; Payne, 2011, JPSP&lt;/ref&gt; In laboratory research, psychologists are exploring how concerns about becoming emotionally exhausted may motivate people to curb their compassion for—and dehumanize—members of stigmatized social groups, such as homeless individuals and drug addicts.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Harris, &amp; Payne, in prep&lt;/ref&gt;

Compassion consists of three major requirements: People must feel that troubles that evoke their feelings are serious, the understanding that sufferers' troubles are not self-inflicted, and ability to picture oneself with the same problems in a non-blaming and non-shaming manner.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt;

=== Neuropsychology ===
In a 2009 small [[fMRI]] experiment, Mary Helen Immordino-Yang and colleagues at the [[Brain and Creativity Institute]] studied strong feelings of compassion for social and physical pain in others. Both feelings involved an expected change in activity in the anterior [[insular cortex|insula]], [[anterior cingulate]], [[hypothalamus]], and [[midbrain]], but they also found a previously undescribed pattern of [[Cerebral cortex|cortical]] activity on the posterior [[medial (anatomy)|medial]] surface of each brain hemisphere, a region involved in the [[Default network|default mode of brain function]], and implicated in self-related processes. Compassion for social pain in others was associated with strong activation in the interoceptive, inferior/posterior portion of this region, while compassion for physical pain in others involved heightened activity in the exteroceptive, superior/anterior portion. Compassion for social pain activated this superior/anterior section, to a lesser extent. Activity in the anterior insula related to compassion for social pain peaked later and endured longer than that associated with compassion for physical pain.&lt;ref name=MHIY2009&gt;{{cite journal |author=Immordino-Yang MH, McColl A, Damasio H, Damasio A |title=Neural correlates of admiration and compassion |journal=Proc.

In one study conducted by Jill Rilling and Gregory Berns, neuroscientists at Emory University, subjects’ brain activity was recorded while they helped someone in need. It was found that while the subjects were performing compassionate acts the caudate nucleus and anterior cingulate regions of the brain were activated, the same areas of the brain associated with pleasure and reward. This research sheds light on how acting on compassion induces a positive feeling in people and how humans are innately wired to want to help the suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Keltner, Dacher.

=== Medicine ===
Compassion is one of the most important attributes for physicians practicing medical services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Principles of Medical Ethics|year=1981|publisher=American Medical Association|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that felt compassion brings about the desire to do something to help the sufferer.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; That desire to be helpful is not compassion, but it does suggest that compassion is similar to other emotions by motivating behaviors to reduce the tension brought on by the emotion.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; Physicians generally identify their central duties as the responsibility to put the patient's interests first, including the duty not to harm, deliver proper care, and maintain confidentiality.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; Compassion is seen in each of those duties because of its direct relation to the recognition and treatment of suffering.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; Physicians who use compassion understand the effects of sickness and suffering on human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassell|first=Eric|title=The Nature of Suffering|year=1985|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compassion may be closely related to love and the emotions evoked in both. This is illustrated by the relationship between patients and physicians in medical institutions.&lt;ref name="Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology" /&gt; The relationship between suffering patients and their care-givers provides evidence that compassion is a social emotion, which is highly related to closeness between individuals.

According to Figley, individuals with a higher capacity or responsibility to empathize with others may be at risk for "compassion fatigue" or stress, which is related to professionals and individuals who spend a significant amount of time responding to information related to suffering.&lt;ref name="Compassion Fatigue: Figley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Figley |first=Charles|title=Compassion Fatigue: Coping With Secondary Traumatic Stress Disorder In Those Who Treat The Traumatized|year=1995|publisher=Brunner-Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0876307595}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, newer research by [[Tania Singer|Singer]] and [[Matthieu Ricard|Ricard]] suggests that it is lack of suitable [[distress tolerance]] which gets people fatigued in compassion activities.&lt;ref name="Altruism: Ricard"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ricard |first=Matthieu|title=Altruism: The Power of Compassion to Change Yourself and the World|chapter=IV|chapter-url=http://info-buddhism.com/Empathy-Compassion-Neuroscience-Ricard-Altruism.html|pages=56–64|year=2015|publisher=Brown and Company|isbn=978-0316208246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that practice of nonjudgmental compassion can prevent fatigue and [[Occupational burnout|burnout]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.matthieuricard.org/system/resources/W1siZiIsIjIwMTMvMDYvMDQvMTBfMjNfNDNfNjIxX0tsaW1lY2tpX0xlaWJlcmdfUmljYXJkX1Npbmdlcl8yMDEzX1NDQU4ucGRmIl1d/Klimecki_Leiberg_Ricard_Singer_2013_SCAN.pdf Differential pattern of functional brain plasticity after compassion and empathy training], Olga M.

=== Self-compassion ===
{{Further|Self-compassion}}
Self-compassion is a process of self kindness and accepting suffering as a quality of being human. It has positive effects on subjective [[happiness]], [[optimism]], [[wisdom]], [[curiosity]], [[agreeableness]], and [[extroversion]].&lt;ref name="Emotional effects of compassion - NeV"&gt;{{cite journal|last=NeV|first=Kristen|author2=Stephanie Rude |author3=Kristin Kirpatrick |title=An examination of self-compassion in relation  to positive psychological functioning and personality traits|journal=Journal of Research in Psychology|year=2007|volume=41|issue=4|pages=908–916|doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2006.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kristin Neff]] and Christopher Germer have identified that there are three levels of activities that thwart self-compassion and they are self-criticism, self-isolation and self-absorption, they equate this to fight, flight and freeze responses.&lt;ref&gt;http://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/publications/germer.neff.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://chrisgermer.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Transforming-Trauma.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is identified that people who lack of life skill equanimity that is akin with distress tolerance are prone to such spontaneous responses. Certain activities may increase feelings of and readiness to practice self-compassion; some of these activities include creating a loving-kindness rituals, practicing empathy, practice random acts of warmth and goodwill like [[tonglen]], etc.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

For increasing compassion in the workplace to self and others ''authentic leadership'' centered on humanism and nourishing quality interconnectedness are considered as the key.&lt;ref name="Compassion in the workplace"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peus|first=Claudia|title=Money over man versus caring and compassion?

Jordan|Judith Jordan]]'s concept of ''self-empathy'' is similar to self-compassion, it implies the capacity to notice, care and respond towards the ones own felt needs. The strategies of self care involve valuing oneself, thinking about one's ideations of needs compassionately, and connecting with others in order to conversely experience renewal, support and validation.

== Historical and spiritual-religious views ==
The ancient Greek and Roman philosophers typically distrusted (feeling) compassion. In the view of many, reason alone was the proper guide to conduct. To some, compassion was an effect, neither admirable nor contemptible. Compassion historically is considered as a passion; [[Justitia]] is blindfolded because her virtue is dispassion and not compassion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Thomas Szasz]]|title=Cruel Compassion: Psychiatric Control of Society's Unwanted|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2pduB22E43oC&amp;pg=PA4|year=1998|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-0510-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Roman society, in fact, compassion was often seen as a vice when it was inclined toward pity, as opposed to mercy. In other words, showing empathy toward someone who was seen as deserving was considered virtuous, whereas showing empathy to someone deemed unworthy was considered immoral (weak).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Gladiators: Violence and Spectacle in Ancient Rome | author=Dunkle, Roger | publisher=Routledge | year=2008 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdvbAAAAQBAJ | page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In classical literature of [[Hinduism]], compassion&lt;ref name=nmgc&gt;Nancy Martin, Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Editor: Knut Jacobsen (2010), Volume II, Brill, {{ISBN|978-90-04-17893-9}}, see Article on ''Grace and Compassion'', pp 752-757&lt;/ref&gt; is a virtue with many shades, each shade explained by different terms. Three most common terms are ''daya'' (दया),&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=dayA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning= dayA] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Spoken Sanskrit, Germany (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; ''karuna'' (करुणा),&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=karuNA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning= karuNA] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Spoken Sanskrit, Germany (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and ''anukampa'' (अनुकम्पा).&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=anukampA&amp;direction=SE&amp;script=HK&amp;link=yes&amp;beginning= AnukampA] Sanskrit English Dictionary, Spoken Sanskrit, Germany (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Other words related to compassion in Hinduism include ''karunya'', ''kripa'', and ''anukrosha''.&lt;ref name=abde/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/aequery/index.html Compassion] Apte English Sanskrit Dictionary, University of Koeln, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these words are used interchangeably among the schools of Hinduism to explain the concept of compassion, its sources, its consequences, and its nature. The virtue of compassion to all living beings, claim [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] and others,&lt;ref&gt;M.K. Gandhi, Hindu Dharma, {{ISBN|978-8122201086}}, Orient Paperbacks&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tripathi, A., &amp; Mullet, E. (2010), Conceptualizations of forgiveness and forgivingness among Hindus, The International Journal for the Psychology of Religion, 20(4), pp 255-266&lt;/ref&gt; is a central concept in Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref name=nmgc/&gt;

''Daya'' is defined by [[Padma Purana]] as the virtuous desire to mitigate the sorrow and difficulties of others by putting forth whatever effort necessary.&lt;ref name=abde/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Parmeshwaranand, Encyclopaedic Dictionary of The Dharmasastra, {{ISBN|978-8176253659}}, pp 369-370&lt;/ref&gt; Matsya Purana describes ''daya'' as the value that treats all living beings (including human beings) as one's own self, wanting the welfare and good of the other living being.&lt;ref name=abde/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matsya Purana, 52.8 and 143.31 through 332&lt;/ref&gt; Such compassion, claims [[Matsya Purana]], is one of necessary paths to being happy. Ekadashi Tattvam&lt;ref&gt;Ekadashi Tattvam, [[Raghunandana Bhattacharya]], Smriti, Calcutta/London (1816)&lt;/ref&gt; explains ''daya'' is treating a stranger, a relative, a friend and a foe as one's own self; it argues that compassion is that state when one sees all living beings as part of one's own self, and when everyone's suffering is seen as one's own suffering. Compassion to all living beings, including to those who are strangers and those who are foes, is seen as a noble virtue.&lt;ref name=abde&gt;Anandita Balslev and Dirk Evers (Editors), Compassion in the World's Religions: Envisioning Human Solidarity (Religionswissenschaft: Forschung und Wissenschaft), {{ISBN|978-3643104762}}, LIT Verlag (2009), see Chapter 4, Compassion: Etymology, Rituals, Anecdotes from the Hindu Tradition&lt;/ref&gt; ''Karuna'', another word for compassion in Hindu philosophy, means placing one's mind in other's favor, thereby seeking to understand the other from their perspective.

Doniger, The Hindus: An Alternative History, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199593347}}, page 270&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tulsidas]] contrasts ''daya'' (compassion) with ''abhiman'' (arrogance, contempt of others), claiming compassion is a source of ''[[Dharma#Definition and meaning|dharmic]]'' life, while arrogance a source of sin. ''Daya'' (compassion) is not ''kripa'' (pity) in Hinduism, or feeling sorry for the sufferer, because that is marred with condescension; compassion is feeling one with the sufferer.&lt;ref&gt;Pujya Paramtattva Swami, [http://www.cbcew.org.uk/CBCEW-Home/Departments/Dialogue-and-Unity/Other-Religions/Cardinal-Tauran-s-UK-Visit-2013/Hindu-Temple-Visit/Pujya-Paramtattva-Swami Catholics and Hindus: The Practice of Compassion as a Contribution to Peace] The Catholic Church in England and Wales, United Kingdom (June 2013), pp 1-3&lt;/ref&gt; Compassion is the basis for [[ahimsa]], a core virtue in Hindu philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Aloysius Michael (1979), Radhakrishnan on Hindu Moral Life and Action, South Asia Books, {{ISBN|978-0836403343}}, pp 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Kemmerer and Anthony Nocella (2011), Call to Compassion, Lantern Books New York, {{ISBN|978-1-59056-182-9}}, pp 31-32&lt;/ref&gt;

Compassion in Hinduism is discussed as an absolute and relative concept. There are two forms of compassion: one for those who suffer even though they have done nothing wrong and one for those who suffer because they did something wrong. Absolute compassion applies to both, while relative compassion addresses the difference between the former and the latter. An example of the latter include those who plead guilty or are convicted of a crime such as murder; in these cases, the virtue of compassion must be balanced with the virtue of justice.&lt;ref name=abde/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muniapan | first1 = B | year = 2008 | title = Kautilya's Arthashastra and Perspectives on Organizational Management | url = | journal = Asian Social Science | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 30–34 | doi=10.5539/ass.v4n1p30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical literature of Hinduism exists in many Indian languages. For example, ''[[Tirukkuṛaḷ]],'' written between 200 BC and AD 400, and sometimes called the Tamil [[Veda]], is a cherished classic on Hinduism written in a South Indian language. It dedicates Chapter 25 of Book 1 to compassion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm Tirukkuṛaḷ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216064046/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/HimalayanAcademy/SacredHinduLiterature/weaver/content.htm |date=December 16, 2014 }} verses 241-250&lt;/ref&gt; further dedicating separate chapters each for the resulting values of compassion, chiefly, [[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]] (Chapter 26), [[non-violence|doing no harm]] (Chapter 32), [[non-killing]] (Chapter 33), possession of [[kindness]] (Chapter 8), dreading evil deeds (Chapter 21), [[benignity]] (Chapter 58), the right [[scepter]] (Chapter 55), and absence of [[terrorism]] (Chapter 57), to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.projectmadurai.org/pm_etexts/pdf/pm0153.pdf | title=Thirukkural English Translation and Commentary | publisher=W.H.

===Jainism===
{{further|Ahimsa in Jainism}}
Compassion for all life, human and non-human, is central to the [[Jainism|Jain]] tradition. Though all life is considered sacred, human life is deemed the highest form of earthly existence. To kill any person, no matter their crime, is considered unimaginably abhorrent. It is the only substantial religious tradition that requires both monks and laity to be vegetarian. It is suggested that certain strains of the [[Hinduism|Hindu tradition]] became vegetarian due to strong Jain influences.&lt;ref&gt;South India Handbook: The Travel Guide By Robert Bradnock, 2000 Footprint Travel Guides, p. 543, Vegetarianism: A History By Colin Spencer, 2002 Thunder's Mouth Press, p. 342&lt;/ref&gt; The Jain tradition's stance on [[ahimsa|nonviolence]], however, goes far beyond [[vegetarianism]]. Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty. Many practice [[veganism]].  Jains run animal shelters all over India. The [[Lal Mandir]], a prominent Jain temple in Delhi, is known for the Jain Birds Hospital in a second building behind the main temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Powell Ettinger |url=http://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/world/bird-hospital.html#cr |title=Jainism and the legendary Delhi bird hospital |publisher=Wildlifeextra.com |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ja7iTij7Bc0C&amp;pg=PT81&amp;dq=birds+hospital+in+delhi#v=onepage&amp;q=birds%20hospital%20in%20delhi&amp;f=false |title=Top 10 Delhi - Dorling Kindersley - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2013-09-28|isbn=9780756695637 |date=2012-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
In the [[Judaism|Jewish tradition]], [[God]] is the Compassionate and is invoked as the Father of Compassion:&lt;ref&gt;Lampert K., ''Traditions of Compassion: From Religious Duty to Social Activism'', Palgrave-Macmillan, 2006; {{ISBN|978-1-4039-8527-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence ''Raḥmana'' or Compassionate becomes the usual designation for His revealed word. (Compare, below, the frequent use of ''raḥman'' in the [[Quran]]).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=699&amp;letter=C&amp;search=compassion |title=The Jewish Encyclopedia |publisher=The Jewish Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sorrow and pity for one in distress, creating a desire to relieve it, is a feeling ascribed alike to man and God: in [[Biblical Hebrew]], ("riḥam," from "reḥem," the mother, womb), "to pity" or "to show mercy" in view of the sufferer's helplessness, hence also "to forgive" (Hab. iii. 2), "to forbear" (Ex. ii. 6; I Sam. xv. 3; Jer. xv. 15, xxi. 7). The [[Rabbi]]s speak of the "thirteen attributes of compassion." The [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical]] conception of compassion is the feeling of the parent for the child. Hence the prophet's appeal in confirmation of his trust in God invokes the feeling of a mother for her offspring (Isa. xlix. 15).&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

A classic articulation of the Golden Rule (see above) came from the first century [[Hillel the Elder|Rabbi Hillel the Elder]]. Renowned in the Jewish tradition as a sage and a scholar, he is associated with the development of the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] and, as such, one of the most important figures in [[Jewish history]]. Asked for a summary of the Jewish religion in the "while standing on one leg" meaning in the most concise terms, Hillel stated: "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow. That is the whole Torah. The rest is the explanation; go and learn."&lt;ref&gt;[[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], tractate Shabbat 31a. See also the [[ethic of reciprocity]] or "The [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden rule]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Post [[9/11]], the words of Rabbi Hillel are frequently quoted in public lectures and interviews around the world by the prominent writer on comparative religion [[Karen Armstrong]].

Many Jewish sources speak of the importance of compassion for animals. Significant rabbis who have done so include Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishveg.com/schwartz/rabbinic.htm |title=Judaism and Vegetarianism: RABBINIC TEACHINGS ON VEGETARIANISM |publisher=Jewishveg.com |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Simhah Zissel Ziv,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/413321/Jewish_Virtue_Ethics_and_Compassion_for_Animals_A_Model_from_the_Musar_Movement|title=Jewish Virtue Ethics and Compassion for Animals: A Model from the Musar Movement|last=Claussen|first=Geoffrey|date=2011|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2013-09-28|journal=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rabbi Moshe Cordovero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishveg.com/DScordovero.html |title=Rav Moshe Cordoero on Compassion for Animals |publisher=JewishVeg |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
{{Main|Karuṇā}}
[[File:Liao Dynasty Avalokitesvara Statue Clear.jpeg|thumb|[[Avalokiteśvara]] looking out over the sea of suffering. [[China]], [[Liao Dynasty]].]]
The first of what in English are called the [[Four Noble Truths]] is the truth of [[suffering]] or [[dukkha]] (unsatisfactoriness or stress). [[Dukkha]] is identified as one of the [[Three marks of existence|three distinguishing characteristics]] of all conditioned existence. It arises as a consequence of the failure to adapt to change  or [[anicca]] (the second characteristic) and the insubstantiality, lack of fixed identity, the horrendous lack of certainty of [[anatta]] (the third characteristic) to which all this constant change in turn gives rise. Compassion made possible by observation and accurate perception is the appropriate practical response. The ultimate and earnest wish, manifest in the Buddha, both as archetype and as historical entity, is to relieve the suffering of all living beings everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;HarperCollins  Dictionary of Religion, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dalai Lama]] has said, "If you want others to be happy, practice compassion. If you want to be happy, practice compassion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter - Dalai Lama|url=https://twitter.com/dalailama/status/576314276228390912|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=24 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American [[Buddhist monk|monk]] [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] states that compassion "supplies the complement to [[metta|loving-kindness]]: whereas loving-kindness has the characteristic of wishing for the [[happiness]] and welfare of others, compassion has the characteristic of wishing that others be free from suffering, a wish to be extended without limits to all living beings. Like [[metta]], compassion arises by entering into the [[subjectivity]] of others, by sharing their interiority in a deep and total way. It springs up by considering that all beings, like ourselves, wish to be free from suffering, yet despite their wishes continue to be harassed by [[Pain and nociception|pain]], [[fear]], [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]], and other forms of dukkha."&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, ''The Noble Eightfold Path: Way to the End of Suffering''. Buddhist Publication Society, 1994, page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
[[File:G. Conti La parabola del Buon Samaritano Messina Chiesa della Medaglia Miracolosa Casa di Ospitalità Collereale.jpg|thumb|Compassion in action: an 18th-century Italian depiction of the Parable of the [[Good Samaritan]]]]

The Christian [[Bible]]'s [[Second Epistle to the Corinthians]] is but one place where God is spoken of as the "Father of compassion" and the "God of all comfort." It reads as follows: 2 Corinthians 1:3-7 "Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves received from God. For just as the sufferings of Christ flow over into our lives, so also through Christ our comfort overflows. If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer. And our hope for you is firm, because we know that just as you share in our sufferings, so also you share in our comfort." [[Jesus]] embodies for [[Christian]]s, the very essence of compassion and relational care. Christ challenges Christians to forsake their own desires and to act compassionately towards others, particularly those in need or distress.&lt;ref&gt;Lampert Khen (2006), Ch. 1 ''incomplete reference''&lt;/ref&gt; Most significantly, he demonstrated compassion to those his society had condemned - tax collectors, prostitutes and criminals.

Conversely, a 2012 study of the [[historical Jesus]] has claimed that the founder of Christianity sought to elevate Judaic compassion as the supreme human virtue, capable of reducing suffering and fulfilling our God-ordained purpose of transforming the world into something more worthy of its creator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake-Brockman|first=Tom|title=Christian Humanism: the compassionate theology of a Jew called Jesus|year=2012|publisher=Denis Jones and associates|location=Sydney|isbn=9780646530390}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
[[File:Nomad prayer.jpg|thumb|A 1930s photograph of a [[desert]] traveler seeking the assistance of [[Allah]] the Merciful, the Compassionate]]

In the Muslim tradition, foremost among [[Allah|God's]] [[99 Names of Allah#List of Names|attributes]] are mercy and compassion or, in the canonical language of Arabic, ''Rahman'' and ''Rahim''. Each of the 114 chapters of the [[Quran]], with one exception, begins with the verse, "In the name of Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful."&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamentals/tawheed/conceptofgod.html |title=University of Southern California |publisher=Usc.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Certainly a Messenger has come to you from among yourselves; grievous to him is your falling into distress, excessively solicitous respecting you; to the believers (he is) compassionate.|[[Qur'an]]|{{quran-usc|9|128}}||}}

The Arabic word for compassion is ''rahmah''. As a cultural influence, its roots abound in the Quran. A good Muslim is to commence each day, each prayer and each significant action by invoking Allah the Merciful and Compassionate, i.e., by reciting ''Bism-i-llah a-Rahman-i-Rahim''. The [http://vimeo.com/11262742 womb and family ties] are characterized by compassion and named after the exalted attribute of Allah "Al-Rahim" (The Compassionate).{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6576">'''Cultural contracts''' refer to the degree that cultural values are exchanged between groups.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. (2002). Cultural contracts theory: Toward an understanding of identity negotiation. Communication Quarterly, 50, 359-67.&lt;/ref&gt; It extends [[identity negotiation]] theory and [[uncertainty reduction theory]] by focusing defining the negotiation experience from the perspective of minority groups when dealing with majority cultural norms. Cultural contracts theory was developed in 1999&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. (1999). The Negotiation of Cultural Identity. Westport, CT: Praeger Press.&lt;/ref&gt; by Dr. Ronald L. Jackson, an identity scholar and a professor in media and cinema studies at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].

== Background ==
Cultural contracts first appeared in Communication Quarterly in 1999. The theory is inspired by Ting-Toomey's (1986) identity validation model (IDM) that emerged from a study of European American and African American communication experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Ting-Toomey, S. (1986). Conflict communication styles in black and white subjective cultures. International and Intercultural Communication Annual, 10, 75-88 here&lt;/ref&gt; Both theories are rooted in the exchanges between strangers as described in Berger and Calabrese's (1975) uncertainty reduction theory.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, C. R., Calabrese, R. J. (1975). Some Exploration in Initial Interaction and Beyond: Toward a Developmental Theory of Communication. Human Communication Research, 1, 99–112&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural contracts focuses specifically on the exchanges between traditionally marginalized groups and majority groups in power in American society from the standpoint of the minority member. The theory is not limited to oral communication. Any value that makes up an individual's [[worldview]], including behavior and other cultural norms, can be negotiated and subjected to a cultural contract.

Cultural contracts suggests that [[mainstream]] and [[marginalized]] identities are in natural conflict. In order to achieve [[communication]], individuals must decide how much of their values will be negotiated. This results in one of three contracts by the minority identity: ready-to-sign contracts (assimilating to mainstream values); quasi-completed contracts (adapting marginalized values to accommodate mainstream values); and co-completed contracts (validating both mainstream and marginalized values).&lt;ref&gt;Jackson. R. L. (2004). Cultural contracts theory: Toward a critical rhetorical identity. In New approaches to rhetoric&lt;/ref&gt; Most individuals are not aware that they create or sign cultural contracts.

Each contract is a “result of how identities have been personally and socially constructed and exposed."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. &amp; Crawley, R. (2003).  White Student Confessions about an African American male professor: A Cultural Contracts Theory approach to intimate conversations about race and worldview.  Journal of Men's Studies, 12(1), 25-42&lt;/ref&gt; The first contract is a [[ready-to-sign contract]], or assimilation, which occurs when individuals replace their culture identity for the dominant culture. This contract can be temporary or long-term and benefits the majority. There is no room for negotiating marginalized identity with [[mainstream]] ideals in this contract with no perceived benefit to the marginalized group.[[Quasi-completed contracts]] (adaptation) result in temporarily incorporating a small part of an individual's value to the mainstream value, and vice versa. This is usually a short-term contract since neither identity is dominant in this interaction. Lastly, [[co-completed contracts]] (mutual validation) result in blending values together. Cultural differences are acknowledged and valued in this contract.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, M. L., Jackson, R. L., &amp; Ribeau, S. A. (2003). African American communication: Exploring ethnic identity and culture, p. 248. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; In certain instance, values are deeply penetrated and are not up for exchange. Others are more surface and the perceived benefits of the contract do not conflict with our core identity. This will determine if an individual is willing to sign a cultural contract or remain in conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L. (2002). Cultural contracts are not unique and can either be short-term or long-term. This depends on the level of confidence a person has in her worldview. Although negotiation of cultural differences is expected, mutual validation is not always the goal or intent of human interaction. Cultural contracts theory: Toward an understanding of identity negotiation. Communication Quarterly, 50, 359-67&lt;/ref&gt; The contracts can be signed one or two ways: the signee perceives a benefit in accommodating or assimilating, or the signee is forced to accommodate or assimilate.

Applications. In addition to identity research, cultural contracts theory has been used in higher education scholarship to explore the relationships between [[White people|White]] students and [[African America]]n faculty&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, R. L., &amp; Crawley, R. L. (2003). White student confessions about a Black male professor: A cultural contracts theory approach to intimate conversations about race and worldview. The Journal of Men’s Studies, 12, 25-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris, T. M. (2007).

'''David R. Roediger''' (born July 13, 1952) is the Foundation Distinguished Professor of American Studies and History at the [[University of Kansas]], where he has been since the fall of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roediger|first1=David|title=CV|url=https://history.ku.edu/sites/history.ku.edu/files/docs/cv/david_roediger_cv_2015-01.pdf|website=history.ku.edu|accessdate=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, he was an American Kendrick C. Babcock Professor of History at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (UIUC).  His research interests include the construction of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial identity]], [[social class|class structures]], labor studies, and the history of [[Far left|American radicalism]]. He writes from a [[Marxism|Marxist]] theoretical framework.

==Early life and education==
Roediger was born on July 13, 1952 in [[Columbia, Illinois]]. He attended local public schools through high school. He earned a [[bachelor of science]] degree in education from [[Northern Illinois University]] in 1975. He went on to do graduate study and earned a [[doctor of philosophy|PhD]] in history from [[Northwestern University]] in 1980, where he wrote a dissertation under the direction of [[George M. Fredrickson]].

==Academic career==
He was assistant editor of the [[Frederick Douglass]] Papers at [[Yale University]] from 1979 to 1980.

After receiving his doctorate, Roediger was a lecturer and assistant professor of history at [[Northwestern University]] from 1980 to 1985. He served as an assistant professor at the [[University of Missouri]] in 1985, rising to full professor in 1992.  He moved to the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1995, and was chair of the university's American Studies Program from 1996 to 2000.

In 2000, he was appointed professor of history at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. Roediger has also served as the director for the Center on Democracy in a Multiracial Society at UIUC. Beginning in the fall of 2014, he will be the Foundation Distinguished Professor of American Studies and History at [[Kansas University]].  
Roediger is a member of the board of directors of the [[Charles H. Kerr Publishing Company|Charles H Kerr Company Publishers]], a position he has held since 1992.

==Research==
Roediger's research interests primarily concern race and class in the [[United States]], although he has also written on radicalism in American history and politics.

In 1989, Roediger and historian [[Philip Foner]] co-authored ''Our Own Time: A History of American Labor and the Working Day,'' a book that provides a highly detailed account of the movement to shorten the [[working time|working day]] in the United States. The work broke new ground by combining [[Labor history of the United States|labor history]] with a study of culture and the nature of work. The book also extended the history of the [[eight-hour day]] movement to [[Colonial America|colonial times]]. The authors argued that debate over the length of the work-day or work-week has been the central issue of the American labor movement during periods of high growth.

===The Wages of Whiteness===
{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
Roediger's book, ''[[The Wages of Whiteness]]: Race and the Making of the American Working Class'', was published in 1991. Along with Alexander Saxton's ''Rise and Fall of the White Republic''(1990) and [[Toni Morrison]]'s ''Playing in the Dark: Whiteness and the Literary Imagination'' (1992), this work is often cited as the starting point of contemporary [[whiteness studies]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[Theodore W. Allen]]'s [http://clogic.eserver.org/2006/allen.html “Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race"] (1975),&lt;ref&gt;Theodore W. Allen, https://www.jstor.org/stable/3004507 [http://clogic.eserver.org/2006/allen.html "Class Struggle and the Origin of Racial Slavery: The Invention of the White Race"] (Hoboken: Hoboken Education Project, 1975), republished in 2006 with an "Introduction" by Jeffrey B. Perry at Center for the Study of Working Class Life, SUNY, Stony Brook&lt;/ref&gt; a pamphlet that later was expanded into his seminal two-volume work [http://www.versobooks.com/books/1039-the-invention-of-the-white-race-volume-1 “The Invention of the White Race,” Vol. 1: “Racial Oppression and Social Control”] (1994, 2012) and &lt;ref&gt;Theodore W. Allen, [http://www.versobooks.com/books/1039-the-invention-of-the-white-race-volume-1 "The Invention of the White Race," Vol. 1: "Racial Oppression and Social Control"] (Verso Books, 1994, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.versobooks.com/books/1048-the-invention-of-the-white-race-volume-2 “The Invention of the White Race,” Vol. 2: “The Origin of Racial Oppression in Anglo-America”] (1997, 2012);&lt;ref&gt;Theodore W. Allen, [http://www.versobooks.com/books/1048-the-invention-of-the-white-race-volume-2 “The Invention of the White Race,” Vol. 2: “The Origin of Racial Oppression in Anglo-America”] (1997, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-84467-770-2}})&lt;/ref&gt; has also been influential in this field. The argument was also in some regards anticipated by [[Abram Lincoln Harris]]' radical scholarship in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, this argument from Harris: "An ill founded fear of seditious combination between outnumbering Negro slaves and landless whites led the dominant whites to foster and augment race distinctions just as many modern employers maintain a definite proportion of representatives of different races and nationalities as a bulwark against labor organization and as others, more ruthless, exploit race antip athy upon the theory of divide et impera” (472). https://www.jstor.org/stable/3004507 {{cite journal |  author-link = Abram L. Harris | title = Economic Foundations of American Race Division | journal = Social Forces | volume = 5(3) | pages = 468–478 | date = 1927 }} Also from Allen: “the opposition to slavery which emanated from the Northwest and the eastern wage-earners was caused by their recognition of a fundamental antagonism of interest between the slavery system and free labor rather than by their humanitarism. As a matter of fact the northern wage-earners were as hostile to Negro freemen as to the slaves. The mobbing of Negroes was quite a common occurrence in the northern and middlewestern cities during the pre-civil war period." [here, Allen cites Frederick Douglass, LIFE AND TIMES OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS, Part I, Ch. 20 and Part II, Ch. 5. Also THE NEW YORK RIOTS]” (472)&lt;/ref&gt; Allen later wrote of Roediger's work: &lt;blockquote&gt;"...because of its almost universal acceptance for use in colleges and universities, has served as the single most effective instrument in the socially necessary consciousness-raising function of objectifying "whiteness," and in popularizing the "race-as-a-social-construct" thesis. As one who has been the beneficiary of kind supportive comments from him for my own efforts in this field of historical investigation, I undertake this critical essay with no other purpose than furthering the our common aim of the disestablishment of white identity, and the overthrow of white supremacism in general."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore W. Allen, [http://clogic.eserver.org/4-2/allen.html "On Roediger’s Wages of Whiteness" (Revised Edition)"] ("Cultural Logic," 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the work, Roediger argued that "whiteness" is a historical phenomenon in the United States, as many different ethnicities now considered "[[white people|white]]" were not initially perceived as such here. The [[Irish people|Irish]], for example, as Roman Catholics and from rural areas, were not considered "white" - meaning accepted as members of the Anglo-American Protestant majority society - until they began to distinguish themselves from [[African American|black]] [[slave]]s and freedmen; from the [[New York Draft Riots]] of 1863, to riots in [[Philadelphia]] against black voting, and the [[Chicago Race Riot of 1919]], ethnic Irish were prominent in violent confrontations against black Americans, with whom they competed for jobs, physical territory and political power. Roediger believes their struggle reflects the emergence of the modern theory of [[Color Consciousness|color consciousness]], through which notions of "nations" and "races" were increasingly linked to color as the primary category of human difference. Roediger claims that the [[social construction]] of the concept of a white [[critical race theory|race]] in the United States was a conscious effort by slave owners to gain distance from those they enslaved, who were generally non-European and non-Christian. In addition, white working peoples gained distance from their Southern proletarian complements, the slaves. By the 18th century, he says, "white" had become well-established as a racial term in the United States; by the end of the 19th, it had become an all-encompassing one.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Weaving together economic theory, psychology, and the histories of immigration, industrialization, class formation and slavery, Roediger in this work addressed what has become a common question in labor history, specifically, and American political culture more generally: why, historically, have working class blacks and whites not found common cause in their shared suffering at the bottom of the social ladder?  ([[W.E.B. DuBois]] also posed this question in his seminal work, ''[[Black Reconstruction]]'' (1935), as he saw a failure of labor in creating connections across racial lines.) In the nineteenth-century context where the small-scale, autonomous craftsmen were being replaced, slowly but inexorably, by the factory system - with great consequences for the "liberty" of ordinary Americans, Roediger suggested that for workers to embrace "whiteness" and a caricatured representation of black slaves provided them with a meaningful symbolic "wage," replacing the status values of independence and craft skill for workers.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

This idea that "whiteness" has enormous surplus value for the working class has influenced a generation of scholars including, most recently, cultural critic [[Thomas Frank]]. Most immediately, it was considered by scholars to have contributed to what analysts had observed to be the splitting of the civil rights consensus of the national Democratic Party and the shift among many of the white working class to vote for Republican [[Ronald Reagan]] as president in 1980, pushing him to victory.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

''Wages of Whiteness'' won the Merle Curti Award in 1992 from the [[Organization of American Historians]], for the best work of social history in 1991.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2140">The '''Declaration of Table Mountain''' is a statement on [[freedom of the press|press freedom]] in [[Africa]]. The statement was issued by the [[World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers]] (WAN-IFRA) and World Editors Forum (WEF) at the 60th meeting of the World Newspaper Conference and 14th World Editors Forum Conference in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], 3–6 June 2007. It is named after [[Table Mountain]], at the southern tip of the African continent.&lt;ref&gt;"Declaration of Table Mountain", ''Index on Censorship'', Volume 36, Number 3, 2007, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

In country after country, the African press is crippled by a panoply of repressive measures, from the jailing and persecution of journalists to the widespread scourge of 'insult laws' and criminal defamation. As the start of an intensive campaign to improve this appalling situation, the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers (WAN-IFRA) adopted the Declaration of Table Mountain on 3 June 2007 in Cape Town, South Africa, during its annual meeting.

Through this Declaration, WAN-IFRA has stated its conviction that Africa urgently needs a strong, free and independent press to act as a watchdog over public institutions, a crucial role that the press is hindered from and punished for playing by the widespread resort to 'insult laws' and criminal defamation, in particular.

Major African and international non-governmental organisations that, day after day, defend and promote freedom of expression and freedom of the press have now endorsed the Declaration and expressed their readiness to contribute to this campaign. Together, with determination, we will now aggressively press our case in the hope for a better future for African media freedom.

{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}

'''Denial''', in ordinary English usage, is asserting that a statement or allegation is not true.&lt;ref name= "OED denial"&gt;{{cite book |title= Oxford English Dictionary |edition= Online, U.S. English |chapter= denial |url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/denial |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate= 2014-05-24 |via= oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same word, and also '''abnegation''' ({{lang-de|Verneinung}}), is used for a [[psychological]] [[defense mechanism]] postulated by [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Sigmund Freud]], in which a person is faced with a fact that is too uncomfortable to accept and rejects it instead, insisting that it is not true despite what may be overwhelming [[evidence]].&lt;ref name= "OED denial"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Niolon |first= Richard |date= April 8, 2011 |url=http://www.psychpage.com/learning/library/counseling/defenses.html |title= Defenses |website= psychpage.com |accessdate= 2014-05-24 |publisher= Richard Niolon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freud, Sigmund (1925). [http://gutenberg.spiegel.de/buch/die-verneinung-915/1 "Die Verneinung"].&lt;/ref&gt; An individual that exhibits such behavior is described as a denialist&lt;ref&gt;2005, The Cape Times 2005-03-11&lt;/ref&gt; or [[True-believer syndrome|true believer]]. Denial also could mean denying the happening of an event or the reliability of information, which can lead to a feeling of aloofness and to the ignoring of possibly beneficial information. 

The subject may use:
* simple denial: deny the [[reality]] of the unpleasant fact altogether
* [[minimisation (psychology)|minimisation]]: admit the fact but deny its seriousness (a combination of denial and [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]])
* [[psychological projection|projection]]: admit both the fact and seriousness but deny [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] by [[blaming]] somebody or something else

==In psychoanalysis==
The concept of denial is particularly important to the study of [[Substance dependence|addiction]].

The theory of denial was first researched seriously by [[Anna Freud]].  She classified denial as a mechanism of the [[(psychological)|immature]] mind, because it conflicts with the ability to learn from and cope with reality.  Where denial occurs in mature minds, it is most often associated with death, dying and [[rape]].  More recent research has significantly expanded the scope and utility of the concept.  [[Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]] used denial as the first of [[Kübler-Ross model|five stages in the psychology of a dying patient]], and the idea has been extended to include the reactions of survivors to news of a death.&lt;ref name="Bonanno2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonanno|first=George A.|title=The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us about Life After Loss|year=2009|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0465019943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contemporary psychoanalysts treat denial as the first stage of a [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] cycle. When an unwelcome change occurs, a trauma of some sort, the first impulse to disbelieve begins the process of coping. That denial, in a healthy mind, slowly rises to greater consciousness. Gradually becoming a subconscious pressure, just beneath the surface of overt awareness, the mechanism of coping then involves repression, while the person accumulates the emotional resources to fully face the trauma. Once faced, the person deals with the trauma in a stage alternately called acceptance or enlightenment, depending on the scope of the issue and the therapist's school of thought. After this stage, once sufficiently dealt with, or dealt with for the time being, the trauma must sink away from total conscious awareness again. Left out of the conscious mind, the process of [[Sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]] involves a balance of neither quite forgetting nor quite remembering. This allows the trauma to re-emerge in consciousness if it involves an ongoing process such as a protracted illness. Alternately, sublimation may begin the full resolution process, where the trauma finally sinks away into eventual forgetfulness. Occasionally this entire cycle has been referred to in modern parlance as ''denial'', confusing the full cycle with only one stage of it.&lt;ref name="pmid6853047"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dorpat |first= T.L. | title = The cognitive arrest hypothesis of denial | journal = [[The International Journal of Psychoanalysis]] | volume = 64 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 47–58 | year = 1983 | pmid = 6853047 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; To further muddy discourse, the terms ''denial'' and ''cycle of denial'' sometimes get used to refer to an unhealthy, dysfunctional cycle of unresolved coping, particularly with regard to addiction and compulsion.

Unlike some other defense mechanisms postulated by [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic theory]] (for instance, [[Psychological repression|repression]]), the general existence of denial is fairly easy to verify, even for non-specialists.  However, denial is one of the most controversial defense mechanisms, since it can be easily used to create [[unfalsifiable]] theories:  anything the subject says or does that appears to disprove the interpreter's theory is explained, not as evidence that the interpreter's theory is wrong, but as the subject's being "in denial". However, researchers note that in some cases of corroborated [[child sexual abuse]], the victims sometimes make a series of partial confessions and recantations as they struggle with their own denial and the denial of [[abusers]] or family members. Use of denial theory in a legal setting, therefore, is carefully regulated and experts' credentials verified. "Formulaic [[guilt (law)|guilt]]" simply by "being a denier" has been castigated by English judges and academics. The main objection is that denial theory is founded on the premise that that which the supposed denier is denying is truth. This usurps the judge (and jury) as triers of fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= London |first1= K. |last2= Bruck |first2= M. |last3= Ceci |first3= S.J. |last4= Shuman |first4= D.W. |title= Disclosure of child sexual abuse: What does the research tell us about the ways that children tell? |journal= [[Psychology, Public Policy and Law]] |volume= 11 |issue= 1 |pages= 194–226 |year= 2005 |doi= 10.1037/1076-8971.11.1.194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

What makes denial denial and not just a refusal to admit to or accept a truth or fact rests in the degree of an individual's awareness of the existence of the truth or fact. In denial, an individual does not see or is mostly unconscious of existence of the truth or fact.  The choice to refuse reality, then, is unconscious as well.  Refusal to admit to or accept a truth or fact differs from denial in that the individual recognizes or is conscious of the existence of the truth or fact but consciously refuses to accept it as such.{{cn|date=November 2014}}
===Denial and disavowal&lt;!--'Disavowal' and 'Disavowal (psychoanalysis)' redirect here--&gt;===
Freud employs the term  ''{{lang|de|Verleugnung}}'' (usually translated either as "disavowal" or as "denial") as distinct from ''{{lang|de|Verneinung}}'' (usually translated as "denial" or as "abnegation"). In ''Verleugnung'', the defense consists of denying something that affects the individual and is a way of affirming what he or she is apparently denying. For Freud, ''Verleugnung'' is related to [[Psychosis|psychoses]], whereas ''[[Psychological repression|Verdrängung]]'' is a [[Neurosis|neurotic]] defense mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Salomon Resnik|Salomon Resnik]], ''The Delusional Person: Bodily Feelings in Psychosis'', Karnac Books, 2001, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freud uses the term ''verleugnen'' in "The Loss of Reality in Neurosis and Psychosis" (1924).&lt;/ref&gt; Freud broadened his clinical work on disavowal beyond the realm of psychosis. In "Fetishism" (1927), he reported a case of two young men each of whom denied the death of his father. Freud notes that neither of them developed a psychosis, even though "a piece of reality which was undoubtedly important has been disavowed [''verleugnet''], just as the unwelcome fact of women's castration is disavowed in fetishists."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alain de Mijolla]] (ed.). ''International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis'', 1st vol.: [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3435300366.html "Disavowal"], Macmillan Reference Books, {{ISBN|0-02-865924-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
The concept of denial is important in [[twelve-step program]]s, where the abandonment or reversal of denial forms the basis of the first, fourth, fifth, eighth and tenth steps.  The ability to deny or minimize is an essential part of what enables an addict to continue his or her behavior despite evidence that—to an outsider—appears overwhelming.  This is cited as one of the reasons that compulsion is seldom effective in treating addiction—the habit of denial remains.

Understanding and avoiding denial is also important in the treatment of various diseases.  The [[American Heart Association]] cites denial as a principal reason that treatment of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] is delayed.  Because the symptoms are so varied, and often have other potential explanations, the opportunity exists for the patient to deny the emergency, often with fatal consequences.  It is common for patients to delay mammograms or other tests because of a fear of cancer, even though this is clearly maladaptive.  It is the responsibility of the care team, and of the nursing staff in particular, to train at-risk patients to avoid this behavior.

==Types==
===Denial of fact===
In this form of denial, someone avoids a fact by utilizing deception.  This lying can take the form of an outright falsehood (commission), leaving out certain details to tailor a story (omission), or by falsely agreeing to something (assent). Someone who is in denial of fact is typically using lies to avoid facts they think may be painful to themselves or others.

===Denial of responsibility===
This form of denial involves avoiding personal responsibility by:
* ''[[blaming]]'': a direct statement shifting culpability and may overlap with denial of fact
* ''[[Minimisation (psychology)|minimizing]]'': an attempt to make the effects or results of an action appear to be less harmful than they may actually be
* ''[[Rationalization (making excuses)|justifying]]'': when someone takes a choice and attempts to make that choice appear acceptable due to their perception of what is right in a situation
* ''[[Regression (psychology)|regression]]'': when someone acts in a way unbecoming of their age&lt;ref name="SirriFava2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Sirri |first1= L. |last2= Fava |first2= G.A. |title= Diagnostic criteria for psychosomatic research and somatic symptom disorders |journal= [[International Review of Psychiatry]] |volume= 25 |issue= 1 |year= 2013 |pages= 19–30 |pmid= 23383664 |doi= 10.3109/09540261.2012.726923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone using denial of responsibility is usually attempting to avoid potential harm or pain by shifting [[attention]] away from themselves.

===Denial of impact===
Denial of impact involves a person's avoiding thinking about or understanding the harms of his or her behavior has caused to self or others, i.e. denial of consequences. Doing this enables that person to avoid feeling a sense of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and it can prevent him or her from developing remorse or empathy for others. Denial of impact reduces or eliminates a sense of pain or harm from poor decisions.&lt;ref name="SirriFava2013"/&gt;

===Denial of cycle===
Many who use this type of denial will say things such as, "[[Just-world hypothesis|it just happened]]". Denial of cycle is where a person avoids looking at their decisions leading up to an event or does not consider their pattern of decision making and how harmful behavior is repeated. The pain and harm being avoided by this type of denial is more of the effort needed to change the focus from a singular event to looking at preceding events. It can also serve as a way to blame or justify behavior (see above).

=== Denial of awareness ===
This form of denial attempts to divert pain by claiming that the level of [[awareness]] was inhibited by some mitigating variable. This is most typically seen in [[addiction]] situations where drug or alcohol abuse is a factor, though it also occasionally manifests itself in relation to [[mental health]] issues or the pharmaceutical substances used to treat mental health issues. This form of denial may also overlap with denial of responsibility.&lt;ref name="pmid11494588"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ino |first1= A. |last2= Tatsuki |first2= S. |last3= Nishikawa |first3= K. | title = The Denial and Awareness Scale (DAS) | language = Ja | journal = Nihon Arukoru Yakubutsu Igakkai Zasshi [Japanese Journal of Alcohol Studies and Drug Dependence] | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 216–34 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11494588 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denial of denial===
This can be a difficult concept for many people to identify with in themselves, but is a major barrier to changing hurtful behaviors. Denial of denial involves thoughts, actions and behaviors which bolster confidence that nothing needs to be changed in one's personal behavior. This form of denial typically overlaps with all of the other forms of denial, but involves more self-delusion. Denial at this level can have significant consequences both personally and at a societal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink= Jeremy Griffith |last= Griffith |first= Jeremy | title= A Species in Denial | year= 2003 |url= http://www.worldtransformation.com/asid-cover/ |publisher= WTM Publishing &amp; Communications |isbn= 9781741290004 |via= worldtransormation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rayson2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Rayson |first1= D. |title= On denying denial |journal= [[Journal of Clinical Oncology]] |volume= 31 |issue= 34 |year= 2013 |pages= 4371–2 |pmid= 24166521 |doi= 10.1200/JCO.2013.52.6228 |url= http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/31/34/4371.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DARVO===
[[Harassment]] covers a wide range of offensive behaviour. It is commonly understood as behaviour intended to disturb or upset. In the legal sense, it is behaviour which ''is'' found threatening or disturbing.

''DARVO'' is an [[acronym]] used to describe a common strategy of abusers: '''''d'''''eny the abuse, then '''''a'''''ttack the victim for attempting to make them accountable for their offense, thereby '''''r'''''eversing '''''v'''''ictim and '''''o'''''ffender. This may involve [[gaslighting]] and [[victim blaming]].

Psychologist [[Jennifer Freyd]] writes:

{{bq |1=...I have observed that actual abusers threaten, bully and make a nightmare for anyone who holds them accountable or asks them to change their abusive behavior. This attack, intended to chill and terrify, typically includes threats of law suits, overt and covert attacks on the whistle-blower's credibility, and so on.  The attack will often take the form of focusing on ridiculing the person who attempts to hold the offender accountable. [...] [T]he offender rapidly creates the impression that the abuser is the wronged one, while the victim or concerned observer is the offender. Figure and ground are completely reversed. [...] The offender is on the offense and the person attempting to hold the offender accountable is put on the defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Freyd |first= J.J. |title= II. Violations of power, adaptive blindness, and betrayal trauma theory |journal= [[Feminism &amp; Psychology]] |volume= 7 |issue= 1 |pages= 22–32 |date= February 1997 |doi= 10.1177/0959353597071004 |url= http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/jjf/articles/freyd97r.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Digeponics''' (pronounced die-jeh-ponics, as in digestion) is a method of [[agriculture]] which integrates the products of [[anaerobic digestion]], including CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[digestate]], with greenhouse cultivation of vegetables.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stoknes|first=K.|last2=Scholwin|first2=F.|last3=Krzesiński|first3=W.|last4=Wojciechowska|first4=E.|last5=Jasińska|first5=A.|date=2016-10-01|title=Efficiency of a novel "Food to waste to food" system including anaerobic digestion of food waste and cultivation of vegetables on digestate in a bubble-insulated greenhouse|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X16303336|journal=Waste Management|volume=56|issue=Supplement C|pages=466–476|doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2016.06.027|pmid=27425859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Digeponics was developed in Norway by the "Food to Waste to Food" (F2W2F) program, a part of the [[EU Eco-innovation Initiative]], in partnership with the waste management company Lindum AS.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stoknes |first1=Ketil |last2=Wojciechowska |first2=E. |last3=Jasińska |first3=A. |last4=Gulliksen |first4=A. |last5=Tesfamichael |first5=A. |title=Growing vegetables in the circular economy; cultivation of tomatoes on green waste compost and food waste digestate. |journal=Acta Hortic. |volume=1215 |pages=389-396 |doi=10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1215.71 |url=https://doi.org/10.17660/ActaHortic.2018.1215.71 |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/eco-innovation/projects/en/projects/f2w2f|title=Food to Waste to Food - Eco-Innovation - European Commission|website=Eco-Innovation|language=en|access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overall concept ==
The method involves the use of various products of anaerobic digestion in the cultivation of vegetables in a greenhouse environment.  The more widely used aspects include the use of biogas for electricity production, which is used for lighting and heating the greenhouse in the winter months, as well as the introduction of carbon dioxide into the greenhouse, which is a byproduct of biogas combustion, for increased plant growth.  The more novel aspect of this method is the use of a "mix of [[vermicompost]] and garden waste compost fertilized by (non-separated) [[digestate]] in a circulating system including earth worms in the substrate and aeration in a biofilter buffer tank." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Performance ==
Research conducted on digeponics found that this method, and others like it, could meet or exceed the production rates of mineral fertilizers.  For [[tomato]] production, digeponics yielded 5430&amp;nbsp;g, compared to 4920&amp;nbsp;g for mineral fertilizers.  For [[cucumber]] production, digeponics yielded 19560g, compared to 8502g for mineral fertilizers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In addition to increased yields, this method can provide decreased energy costs and very low carbon emissions, by producing energy on site from renewable carbon neutral sources that are readily available to the farmer, and could even provide an additional source of income by charging tipping fees for organic waste collection and selling excess electricity or gas back into the grid.  Methane emissions were shown to be reduced by 98%, compared to landfilling of organic waste, and carbon emissions were reduced 95%, compared with conventional tomato greenhouse production.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Image:Thermally Agitated Molecule.gif|thumb|right|'''Thermal motion''' of an [[alpha helix|α-helical]] [[peptide]]. The jittery motion is random and complex, and the energy of any particular atom can fluctuate wildly. Nevertheless, the equipartition theorem allows the ''average'' [[kinetic energy]] of each atom to be computed, as well as the average potential energies of many vibrational modes. The grey, red and blue spheres represent [[atom]]s of [[carbon]], [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]], respectively; the smaller white spheres represent atoms of [[hydrogen]].]]

In [[classical physics|classical]] [[statistical mechanics]], the '''equipartition theorem''' relates the [[temperature]] of a system to its average [[energy|energies]]. The equipartition theorem is also known as the '''law of equipartition''', '''equipartition of energy''', or simply '''equipartition'''. The original idea of equipartition was that, in [[thermal equilibrium]], energy is shared equally among all of its various forms; for example, the average [[kinetic energy]] per [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] in [[translation (physics)|translational motion]] of a molecule should equal that in [[rotational motion]].

The equipartition theorem makes quantitative predictions. Like the [[virial theorem]], it gives the total average kinetic and potential energies for a system at a given temperature, from which the system's [[heat capacity]] can be computed. However, equipartition also gives the average values of individual components of the energy, such as the kinetic energy of a particular particle or the potential energy of a single [[spring (device)|spring]]. For example, it predicts that every atom in a [[monatomic]] [[ideal gas]] has an average kinetic energy of (3/2)''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' in thermal equilibrium, where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' is the [[Thermodynamic temperature|(thermodynamic) temperature]]. More generally, equipartition can be applied to any [[classical physics|classical system]] in [[thermal equilibrium]], no matter how complicated. It can be used to derive the [[ideal gas law]], and the [[Dulong–Petit law]] for the [[specific heat capacity|specific heat capacities]] of solids. The equipartition theorem can also be used to predict the properties of [[star]]s, even [[white dwarf]]s and [[neutron star]]s, since it holds even when [[special relativity|relativistic]] effects are considered.

Although the equipartition theorem makes accurate predictions in certain conditions, it is inaccurate when [[quantum physics|quantum effects]] are significant, such as at low temperatures.  When the [[thermal energy]] ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' is smaller than the quantum energy spacing in a particular [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]], the average energy and heat capacity of this degree of freedom are less than the values predicted by equipartition. Such a degree of freedom is said to be "frozen out" when the thermal energy is much smaller than this spacing. For example, the heat capacity of a solid decreases at low temperatures as various types of motion become frozen out, rather than remaining constant as predicted by equipartition. Such decreases in heat capacity were among the first signs to physicists of the 19th century that classical physics was incorrect and that a new, more subtle, scientific model was required. Along with other evidence, equipartition's failure to model [[black-body radiation]]—also known as the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]—led [[Max Planck]] to suggest that energy in the oscillators in an object, which emit light, were quantized, a revolutionary hypothesis that spurred the development of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]].

==Basic concept and simple examples==

[[File:MaxwellBoltzmann-en.svg|right|thumb|440px|Figure 2. Probability density functions of the molecular speed for four [[noble gas]]es at a [[temperature]] of 298.15 [[Kelvin|K]] (25 [[Celsius|°C]]). The four gases are [[helium]] (&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He), [[neon]] (&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;Ne), [[argon]] (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;Ar) and [[xenon]] (&lt;sup&gt;132&lt;/sup&gt;Xe); the superscripts indicate their [[mass number]]s. These probability density functions have [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of probability times inverse speed; since probability is dimensionless, they can be expressed in units of seconds per meter.]]

The name "equipartition" means "equal division," as derived from the [[Latin]] ''equi'' from the antecedent, æquus ("equal or even"), and partition from the noun, ''partitio'' ("division, portion").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=equi&amp;searchmode=none|title=equi-|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2008-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Partition&amp;searchmode=none|title=partition|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2008-12-20}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The original concept of equipartition was that the total [[kinetic energy]] of a system is shared equally among all of its independent parts, ''on the average'', once the system has reached thermal equilibrium. Equipartition also makes quantitative predictions for these energies. For example, it predicts that every atom of an inert [[noble gas]], in thermal equilibrium at temperature ''T'', has an average translational kinetic energy of (3/2)''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', where ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. As a consequence, since kinetic energy is equal to 1/2(mass)(velocity)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the heavier atoms of [[xenon]] have a lower average speed than do the lighter atoms of [[helium]] at the same temperature. Figure&amp;nbsp;2 shows the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]] for the speeds of the atoms in four noble gases.

In this example, the key point is that the kinetic energy is quadratic in the velocity. The equipartition theorem shows that in thermal equilibrium, any [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] (such as a component of the position or velocity of a particle) which appears only quadratically in the energy has an average energy of {{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' and therefore contributes {{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; to the system's [[heat capacity]]. This has many applications.

===Translational energy and ideal gases===
{{See also|Ideal gas}}

The (Newtonian) kinetic energy of a particle of mass ''m'', velocity '''v''' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\text{kin}} = \tfrac12 m |\mathbf{v}|^2 = \tfrac{1}{2} m\left( v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2 \right),
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''v&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''v&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the Cartesian components of the velocity '''v'''. Here, ''H'' is short for [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], and used henceforth as a symbol for energy because the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian formalism]] plays a central role in the most [[#General formulation of the equipartition theorem|general form]] of the equipartition theorem.

Since the kinetic energy is quadratic in the components of the velocity, by equipartition these three components each contribute {{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' to the average kinetic energy in thermal equilibrium. Thus the average kinetic energy of the particle is (3/2)''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', as in the example of noble gases above.

More generally, in an ideal gas, the total energy consists purely of (translational) kinetic energy: by assumption, the particles have no internal degrees of freedom and move independently of one another. Equipartition therefore predicts that the average total energy of an ideal gas of ''N'' particles is (3/2)&amp;nbsp;''N&amp;thinsp;k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''T''.

It follows that the [[heat capacity]] of the gas is (3/2)&amp;nbsp;''N&amp;thinsp;k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and hence, in particular, the heat capacity of a [[mole (unit)|mole]] of such gas particles is (3/2)''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (3/2)''R'', where ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Avogadro constant]] and ''R'' is the [[gas constant]]. Since ''R'' ≈ 2 [[calorie|cal]]/([[mole (unit)|mol]]·[[Kelvin|K]]), equipartition predicts that the [[molar heat capacity]] of an ideal gas is roughly 3&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K). This prediction is confirmed by experiment.&lt;ref name="kundt_1876" /&gt;

The mean kinetic energy also allows the [[root mean square speed]] ''v''&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt; of the gas particles to be calculated:
:&lt;math&gt;
v_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\langle v^2 \rangle} = \sqrt{\frac{3 k_B T}{m}} = \sqrt{\frac{3 R T}{M}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M''&amp;nbsp;= ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''m'' is the mass of a mole of gas particles. This result is useful for many applications such as [[Graham's law]] of [[effusion]], which provides a method for [[enriched uranium|enriching]] [[uranium]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/enrichment.html Fact Sheet on Uranium Enrichment] U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Accessed 30 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rotational energy and molecular tumbling in solution===
{{See also|Angular velocity|Rotational diffusion}}

A similar example is provided by a rotating molecule with [[principal moments of inertia]] ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The rotational energy of such a molecule is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{rot}} = \tfrac{1}{2} ( I_{1} \omega_{1}^{2} + I_{2} \omega_{2}^{2} + I_{3} \omega_{3}^{2} ),
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and ''ω''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are the principal components of the [[angular velocity]]. By exactly the same reasoning as in the translational case, equipartition implies that in thermal equilibrium the average rotational energy of each particle is (3/2)''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''. Similarly, the equipartition theorem allows the average (more precisely, the root mean square) angular speed of the molecules to be calculated.&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;

The tumbling of rigid molecules—that is, the random rotations of molecules in solution—plays a key role in the [[relaxation (NMR)|relaxation]]s observed by [[nuclear magnetic resonance]], particularly [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|protein NMR]] and [[residual dipolar coupling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Cavanagh, J; Fairbrother WJ, Palmer AG III, Skelton NJ, Rance M | year = 2006 | title = Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice | edition = 2nd | publisher = Academic Press | isbn = 978-0-12-164491-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rotational diffusion can also be observed by other biophysical probes such as [[fluorescence anisotropy]], [[flow birefringence]] and [[dielectric spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cantor | first = CR |author2=Schimmel PR | year = 1980 | title = Biophysical Chemistry. Part II. Techniques for the study of biological structure and function | publisher = W. H. Freeman | isbn = 978-0-7167-1189-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Potential energy and harmonic oscillators===
Equipartition applies to [[potential energy|potential energies]] as well as kinetic energies: important examples include [[harmonic oscillator]]s such as a [[spring (device)|spring]], which has a quadratic potential energy

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\text{pot}} = \tfrac 12 a q^2,\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the constant ''a'' describes the stiffness of the spring and ''q'' is the deviation from equilibrium. If such a one-dimensional system has mass ''m'', then its kinetic energy ''H''&lt;sub&gt;kin&lt;/sub&gt; is
&lt;!-- {{frac|1|2}}''mv''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2''m'', --&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\text{kin}} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{p^2}{2m},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' and ''p''&amp;nbsp;= ''mv'' denote the velocity and momentum of the oscillator. Combining these terms yields the total energy&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
H = H_{\text{kin}} + H_{\text{pot}} = \frac{p^2}{2m} + \frac{1}{2} a q^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

Equipartition therefore implies that in thermal equilibrium, the oscillator has average energy

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H \rangle = 
\langle H_{\text{kin}} \rangle + \langle H_{\text{pot}} \rangle = 
\tfrac{1}{2} k_B T + \tfrac{1}{2} k_B T = k_B T,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the angular brackets &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \ldots \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denote the average of the enclosed quantity,&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt;

This result is valid for any type of harmonic oscillator, such as a [[pendulum]], a vibrating molecule or a passive [[electronic oscillator]]. Systems of such oscillators arise in many situations; by equipartition, each such oscillator receives an average total energy ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' and hence contributes ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; to the system's [[heat capacity]]. This can be used to derive the formula for [[Johnson–Nyquist noise]]&lt;ref name="mandl_1971" &gt;{{cite book | last = Mandl | first = F | year = 1971 | title = Statistical Physics | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | pages = 213–219 | isbn = 0-471-56658-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dulong–Petit law]] of solid heat capacities. The latter application was particularly significant in the history of equipartition.

[[Image:Vätskefas.png|frame|left|Figure 3. Atoms in a crystal can vibrate about their equilibrium positions in the [[crystal structure|lattice]]. Such vibrations account largely for the [[heat capacity]] of crystalline [[dielectric]]s; with [[metal]]s, [[electron]]s also contribute to the heat capacity.]]

===Specific heat capacity of solids===
::''For more details on the molar specific heat capacities of [[solid]]s, see [[Einstein solid]] and [[Debye model]].''

An important application of the equipartition theorem is to the specific heat capacity of a crystalline solid. Each atom in such a solid can oscillate in three independent directions, so the solid can be viewed as a system of 3''N'' independent [[simple harmonic oscillator]]s, where ''N'' denotes the number of atoms in the lattice. Since each harmonic oscillator has average energy ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', the average total energy of the solid is 3''Nk''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', and its heat capacity is 3''Nk''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;.

By taking ''N'' to be the [[Avogadro constant]] ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, and using the relation ''R''&amp;nbsp;= ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; between the [[gas constant]] ''R'' and the Boltzmann constant ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, this provides an explanation for the [[Dulong–Petit law]] of [[specific heat capacity|specific heat capacities]] of solids, which stated that the specific heat capacity (per unit mass) of a solid element is inversely proportional to its [[atomic weight]]. A modern version is that the molar heat capacity of a solid is ''3R''&amp;nbsp;≈ 6&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K).

However, this law is inaccurate at lower temperatures, due to quantum effects; it is also inconsistent with the experimentally derived [[third law of thermodynamics]], according to which the molar heat capacity of any substance must go to zero as the temperature goes to absolute zero.&lt;ref name="mandl_1971" /&gt; A more accurate theory, incorporating quantum effects, was developed by [[Albert Einstein]] (1907) and [[Peter Debye]] (1911).&lt;ref name="pais_1982" /&gt;

Many other physical systems can be modeled as sets of [[oscillation#Coupled oscillations|coupled oscillators]]. The motions of such oscillators can be decomposed into [[normal mode]]s, like the vibrational modes of a [[piano string]] or the [[resonance]]s of an [[organ pipe]]. On the other hand, equipartition often breaks down for such systems, because there is no exchange of energy between the normal modes. In an extreme situation, the modes are independent and so their energies are independently conserved. This shows that some sort of mixing of energies, formally called ''ergodicity'', is important for the law of equipartition to hold.

===Sedimentation of particles===
{{See also|Sedimentation|Mason&amp;ndash;Weaver equation|Brewing}}

Potential energies are not always quadratic in the position. However, the equipartition theorem also shows that if a degree of freedom ''x'' contributes only a multiple of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; (for a fixed real number ''s'') to the energy, then in thermal equilibrium the average energy of that part is ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/''s''.

There is a simple application of this extension to the [[sedimentation]] of particles under [[gravitation|gravity]].&lt;ref name="tolman_1918" /&gt; For example, the haze sometimes seen in [[beer]] can be caused by clumps of [[protein]]s that [[Rayleigh scattering|scatter]] light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miedl M, Garcia M, Bamforth C |title=Haze formation in model beer systems |journal=J. Agric. Food Chem. |volume=53 |issue=26 |pages=10161–5 |year=2005 |pmid=16366710 |doi=10.1021/jf0506941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, these clumps settle downwards under the influence of gravity, causing more haze near the bottom of a bottle than near its top. However, in a process working in the opposite direction, the particles also [[diffusion|diffuse]] back up towards the top of the bottle. Once equilibrium has been reached, the equipartition theorem may be used to determine the average position of a particular clump of [[buoyant mass]] ''m''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;. For an infinitely tall bottle of beer, the gravitational [[potential energy]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
H^{\mathrm{grav}} = m_{\rm b} g z\, &lt;/math&gt;

where ''z'' is the height of the protein clump in the bottle and ''[[Earth's gravity|g]]'' is the [[acceleration]] due to gravity. Since ''s''&amp;nbsp;= 1, the average potential energy of a protein clump equals ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''. Hence, a protein clump with a buoyant mass of 10&amp;nbsp;[[Dalton (unit)|MDa]] (roughly the size of a [[virus]]) would produce a haze with an average height of about 2&amp;nbsp;cm at equilibrium. The process of such sedimentation to equilibrium is described by the [[Mason–Weaver equation]].&lt;ref name="mason_1924" &gt;{{cite journal | last = Mason | first = M |author2=Weaver W | year = 1924 | title = The Settling of Small Particles in a Fluid | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 412–426 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.23.412|bibcode = 1924PhRv...23..412M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
::''This article uses the non-[[International System of Units|SI]] unit of ''[[calorie|cal]]/([[mole (unit)|mol]]·[[Kelvin|K]])'' for heat capacity, because it offers greater accuracy for single digits.&lt;br /&gt;For an approximate conversion to the corresponding SI unit of ''J/(mol·K)'', such values should be multiplied by 4.2''&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|J]]/cal.

The equipartition of kinetic energy was proposed initially in 1843, and more correctly in 1845, by [[John James Waterston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brush | first = SG | year = 1976 | title = The Kind of Motion We Call Heat, Volume 1 | publisher = North Holland | location = Amsterdam | pages = 134–159 | isbn = 978-0-444-87009-4}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite book | last = Brush | first = SG | year = 1976 | title = The Kind of Motion We Call Heat, Volume 2 | publisher = North Holland | location = Amsterdam | pages = 336–339 | isbn = 978-0-444-87009-4}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Waterston | first = JJ | authorlink = John James Waterston | year = 1846 | title = On the physics of media that are composed of free and elastic molecules in a state of motion | journal = Proc.

Waterston's key paper was written and submitted in 1845 to the [[Royal Society]]. After refusing to publish his work, the Society also refused to return his manuscript and stored it among its files. The manuscript was discovered in 1891 by [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]], who criticized the original reviewer for failing to recognize the significance of Waterston's work. Waterston managed to publish his ideas in 1851, and therefore has priority over Maxwell for enunciating the first version of the equipartition theorem.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, [[James Clerk Maxwell]] argued that the kinetic heat energy of a gas is equally divided between linear and rotational energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Maxwell | first = JC | authorlink = James Clerk Maxwell | year = 2003 | chapter = Illustrations of the Dynamical Theory of Gases | title = The Scientific Papers of James Clerk Maxwell | editor = WD Niven | pages = Vol.1, pp. 377–409 | publisher = Dover | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-486-49560-6 | nopp = true}} Read by Prof. Maxwell at a Meeting of the British Association at Aberdeen on 21 September 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876, [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] expanded on this principle by showing that the average energy was divided equally among all the independent components of motion in a system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boltzmann | first = L | authorlink = Ludwig Boltzmann | year = 1871 | title = Einige allgemeine Sätze über Wärmegleichgewicht (Some general statements on thermal equilibrium) | journal = Wiener Berichte | volume = 63 | pages = 679–711|language=de}} In this preliminary work, Boltzmann showed that the average total kinetic energy equals the average total potential energy when a system is acted upon by external harmonic forces.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boltzmann | first = L | authorlink = Ludwig Boltzmann | year = 1876 | title = Über die Natur der Gasmoleküle (On the nature of gas molecules) | journal = Wiener Berichte | volume = 74 | pages = 553–560|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boltzmann applied the equipartition theorem to provide a theoretical explanation of the [[Dulong–Petit law]] for the [[specific heat|specific heat capacities]] of solids.

[[Image:DiatomicSpecHeat1.png|thumb|450px|right|Figure 4. Idealized plot of the [[specific heat capacity|molar specific heat]] of a diatomic gas against temperature. It agrees with the value (7/2)''R'' predicted by equipartition at high temperatures (where ''R'' is the [[gas constant]]), but decreases to (5/2)''R'' and then (3/2)''R'' at lower temperatures, as the vibrational and rotational modes of motion are "frozen out". The failure of the equipartition theorem led to a paradox that was only resolved by [[quantum mechanics]]. For most molecules, the transitional temperature T&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt; is much less than room temperature, whereas ''T''&lt;sub&gt;vib&lt;/sub&gt; can be ten times larger or more. A typical example is [[carbon monoxide]], CO, for which ''T''&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt; ≈ 2.8&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;vib&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈ 3103&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]. For molecules with very large or weakly bound atoms, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;vib&lt;/sub&gt; can be close to room temperature (about 300&amp;nbsp;K); for example, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;vib&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;≈ 308&amp;nbsp;K for [[iodine]] gas, I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="mcquarrie_2000c" /&gt;]]

The history of the equipartition theorem is intertwined with that of [[specific heat capacity]], both of which were studied in the 19th century. In 1819, the French physicists [[Pierre Louis Dulong]] and [[Alexis Thérèse Petit]] discovered that the specific heat capacities of solid elements at room temperature were inversely proportional to the atomic weight of the element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Petit | first = AT | authorlink = Alexis Thérèse Petit |author2=Dulong PL |authorlink2=Pierre Louis Dulong  | year = 1819 | title = Recherches sur quelques points importants de la théorie de la chaleur (Studies on key points in the theory of heat) | url = http://web.lemoyne.edu/~giunta/PETIT.html | journal = [[Annales de Chimie et de Physique]] | volume = 10 | pages = 395–413|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their law was used for many years as a technique for measuring atomic weights.&lt;ref name="pais_1982" &gt;{{cite book | last = Pais | first = A | authorlink = Abraham Pais | year = 1982 | title = Subtle is the Lord | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-853907-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent studies by [[James Dewar]] and [[Heinrich Friedrich Weber]] showed that this [[Dulong–Petit law]] holds only at high [[temperature]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dewar | first = J | authorlink = James Dewar | year = 1872 | title = The Specific Heat of Carbon at High Temperatures | journal = [[Philosophical Magazine]] | volume = 44 | pages = 461}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weber | first = HF | authorlink = Heinrich Friedrich Weber | year = 1872 | title = Die specifische Wärme des Kohlenstoffs (The specific heat of carbon) | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 147 | pages = 311–319 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k152316|language=de|doi=10.1002/andp.18722231007|bibcode = 1872AnP...223..311W }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Weber | first = HF | authorlink = Heinrich Friedrich Weber | year = 1875 | title = Die specifische Wärmen der Elemente Kohlenstoff, Bor und Silicium (The specific heats of elemental carbon, boron, and silicon) | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 154 | pages = 367–423, 553–582 |doi=10.1002/andp.18752300307 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15238m|language=de|bibcode = 1875AnP...230..367W }}&lt;/ref&gt; at lower temperatures, or for exceptionally hard solids such as [[diamond]], the specific heat capacity was lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = de la Rive | first = A |author2=Marcet F | year = 1840 | title = Quelques recherches sur la chaleur spécifique (Some research on specific heat) | journal = Annales de Chimie et de Physique | volume = 75 | pages = 113–144 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vBwAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA3 | publisher = Masson.|language=fr}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Regnault | first = HV | authorlink = Henri Victor Regnault | year = 1841 | title = Recherches sur la chaleur spécifique des corps simples et des corps composés (deuxième Mémoire) (Studies of the specific heats of simple and composite bodies) | journal = [[Annales de Chimie et de Physique]] | volume = 1 | series = (3me Série)| pages = 129–207 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k34742d|language=fr}} Read at l'Académie des Sciences on 11 January 1841.&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wigand | first = A | year = 1907 | title = Über Temperaturabhängigkeit der spezifischen Wärme fester Elemente (On the temperature dependence of the specific heats of solids) | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 22 | pages = 99–106|language=de|doi=10.1002/andp.19063270105 |bibcode = 1906AnP...327...99W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental observations of the specific heat capacities of gases also raised concerns about the validity of the equipartition theorem. The theorem predicts that the molar heat capacity of simple monatomic gases should be roughly 3&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K), whereas that of diatomic gases should be roughly 7&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K).

==General formulation of the equipartition theorem==
{{See also|Generalized coordinates|Hamiltonian mechanics|Microcanonical ensemble|Canonical ensemble}}

The most general form of the equipartition theorem states that under suitable assumptions (discussed below), for a physical system with [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]] energy function ''H'' and degrees of freedom ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', the following equipartition formula holds in thermal equilibrium for all indices ''m'' and ''n'':&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tolman_1918" &gt;{{cite journal | last = Tolman | first = RC | authorlink = Richard C. Tolman | year = 1918 | title = A General Theory of Energy Partition with Applications to Quantum Theory | journal = [[Physical Review]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 261–275 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.11.261|bibcode = 1918PhRv...11..261T }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\!
\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = \delta_{mn} k_{B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''δ&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[Kronecker delta]], which is equal to one if ''m''&amp;nbsp;= ''n'' and is zero otherwise. The averaging brackets &lt;math&gt;\left\langle \ldots \right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be an [[ensemble average]] over phase space or, under an assumption of [[ergodic]]ity, a time average of a single system.

The general equipartition theorem holds in both the [[microcanonical ensemble]],&lt;ref name="huang_1987"&gt;{{cite book | last = Huang | first = K | authorlink = Kerson Huang | year = 1987 | title = Statistical Mechanics | edition = 2nd | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | pages = 136–138 | isbn = 0-471-81518-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the total energy of the system is constant, and also in the [[canonical ensemble]],&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" &gt;{{cite book | last = Pathria | first = RK | year = 1972 | title = Statistical Mechanics | publisher = Pergamon Press | pages = 43–48, 73–74 | isbn = 0-08-016747-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tolman_1938" &gt;{{cite book | last = Tolman | first = RC | authorlink = Richard C. Tolman | year = 1938 | title = The Principles of Statistical Mechanics | publisher = Dover Publications | location = New York | pages = 93–98 | isbn = 0-486-63896-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the system is coupled to a [[heat bath]] with which it can exchange energy. Derivations of the general formula are given [[#Derivations|later in the article]].

The general formula is equivalent to the following two:
# &lt;math&gt;\Bigl\langle x_{n} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = k_{B} T \quad \mbox{for all } n&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = 0 \quad \mbox{for all } m \neq n.&lt;/math&gt;

If a degree of freedom ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' appears only as a quadratic term ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the Hamiltonian ''H'', then the first of these formulae implies that
:&lt;math&gt;
k_{B} T = \Bigl\langle x_{n} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}}\Bigr\rangle = 2\langle a_n x_n^2 \rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;
which is twice the contribution that this degree of freedom makes to the average energy &lt;math&gt;\langle H\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the equipartition theorem for systems with quadratic energies follows easily from the general formula. A similar argument, with 2 replaced by ''s'', applies to energies of the form ''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;''.

The degrees of freedom ''x&lt;sub&gt;n''&lt;/sub&gt; are coordinates on the [[phase space]] of the system and are therefore commonly subdivided into [[canonical coordinates|generalized position]] coordinates ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' and [[generalized momentum]] coordinates ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[conjugate momentum]] to ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. In this situation, formula 1 means that for all ''k'',

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle p_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_{k}} \Bigr\rangle =  \Bigl\langle q_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = k_{\rm B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Using the equations of [[Hamiltonian mechanics]],&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980" &gt;{{cite book | last = Goldstein |first = H | authorlink = Herbert Goldstein | year = 1980 | title = Classical Mechanics | edition = 2nd. | publisher = Addison-Wesley | isbn = 0-201-02918-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; these formulae may also be written

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle p_{k} \frac{dq_{k}}{dt} \Bigr\rangle = -\Bigl\langle q_{k} \frac{dp_{k}}{dt} \Bigr\rangle = k_{\rm B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, one can show using formula 2 that

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle q_{j} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = \Bigl\langle p_{j} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = 0 
\quad \mbox{ for all } \, j,k
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle q_{j} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = 
\Bigl\langle p_{j} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = 0 \quad \mbox{ for all } \, j \neq k.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Relation to the virial theorem===
{{See also|Virial theorem|Generalized coordinates|Hamiltonian mechanics}}

The general equipartition theorem is an extension of the [[virial theorem]] (proposed in 1870&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Clausius | first = R | authorlink = Rudolf Clausius | year = 1870 | title = Ueber einen auf die Wärme anwendbaren mechanischen Satz | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 141 | pages = 124–130 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k152258 | doi=10.1002/andp.18702170911|language=de|bibcode = 1870AnP...217..124C }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal | last = Clausius | first = RJE | authorlink = Rudolf Clausius | year = 1870 | title = On a Mechanical Theorem Applicable to Heat | journal = [[Philosophical Magazine]] |series=Series 4 | volume = 40 | pages = 122–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which states that

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle \sum_{k} q_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = 
\Bigl\langle \sum_{k} p_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = 
\Bigl\langle \sum_{k} p_{k} \frac{dq_{k}}{dt} \Bigr\rangle = -\Bigl\langle \sum_{k} q_{k} \frac{dp_{k}}{dt} \Bigr\rangle,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' denotes [[time]].&lt;ref name="goldstein_1980" /&gt; Two key differences are that the virial theorem relates ''summed'' rather than ''individual'' averages to each other, and it does not connect them to the [[temperature]] ''T''. Another difference is that traditional derivations of the virial theorem use averages over time, whereas those of the equipartition theorem use averages over [[phase space]].

==Applications==

===Ideal gas law===
{{See also|Ideal gas|Ideal gas law}}

[[Ideal gas]]es provide an important application of the equipartition theorem. As well as providing the formula
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle H^{\mathrm{kin}} \rangle &amp;= \frac{1}{2m} \langle p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2} + p_{z}^{2} \rangle\\
&amp;=  \frac{1}{2} \biggl(
\Bigl\langle p_{x} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{x}} \Bigr\rangle + 
\Bigl\langle p_{y} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{y}} \Bigr\rangle +
\Bigl\langle p_{z} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{z}} \Bigr\rangle \biggr) = 
\frac{3}{2} k_{B} T
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
for the average kinetic energy per particle, the equipartition theorem can be used to derive the [[ideal gas law]] from classical mechanics.&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt; If '''q''' = (''q&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''q&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''q&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') and '''p''' = (''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'') denote the position vector and momentum of a particle in the gas, and
'''F''' is the net force on that particle, then
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{F} \rangle &amp;= \Bigl\langle q_x \frac{dp_x}{dt} \Bigr\rangle + 
\Bigl\langle q_y \frac{dp_y}{dt} \Bigr\rangle + 
\Bigl\langle q_z \frac{dp_z}{dt} \Bigr\rangle\\
&amp;=-\Bigl\langle q_x \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_x} \Bigr\rangle -
\Bigl\langle q_y \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_y} \Bigr\rangle - 
\Bigl\langle q_z \frac{\partial H}{\partial q_z} \Bigr\rangle = -3k_B T,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the first equality is [[Newton's second law]], and the second line uses [[Hamilton's equations]] and the equipartition formula. Summing over a system of ''N'' particles yields

:&lt;math&gt;
3Nk_{B} T = - \biggl\langle \sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathbf{q}_{k} \cdot \mathbf{F}_{k} \biggr\rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Translational motion.gif|frame|right|Figure 5. The kinetic energy of a particular molecule can [[thermal fluctuations|fluctuate wildly]], but the equipartition theorem allows its ''average'' energy to be calculated at any temperature. Equipartition also provides a derivation of the [[ideal gas law]], an equation that relates the [[pressure]], [[volume]] and [[temperature]] of the gas. (In this diagram five of the molecules have been colored red to track their motion; this coloration has no other significance.)]]

By [[Newton's third law]] and the ideal gas assumption, the net force on the system is the force applied by the walls of their container, and this force is given by the pressure ''P'' of the gas. Hence

:&lt;math&gt;
-\biggl\langle\sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathbf{q}_{k} \cdot \mathbf{F}_{k}\biggr\rangle = P \oint_{\mathrm{surface}} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{dS},
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''d''S''''' is the infinitesimal area element along the walls of the container. Since the [[divergence]] of the position vector '''q''' is

:&lt;math&gt;
\boldsymbol\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} =
\frac{\partial q_{x}}{\partial q_{x}} + 
\frac{\partial q_{y}}{\partial q_{y}} + 
\frac{\partial q_{z}}{\partial q_{z}} = 3,
&lt;/math&gt;

the [[divergence theorem]] implies that

:&lt;math&gt;
P \oint_{\mathrm{surface}} \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{dS} = P \int_{\mathrm{volume}} \left( \boldsymbol\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} \right) \, dV = 3PV,
&lt;/math&gt;

where d''V'' is an infinitesimal volume within the container and ''V'' is the total volume of the container.

Putting these equalities together yields

:&lt;math&gt;
3Nk_{B} T = -\biggl\langle \sum_{k=1}^{N} \mathbf{q}_{k} \cdot \mathbf{F}_{k} \biggr\rangle = 3PV,
&lt;/math&gt;

which immediately implies the [[ideal gas law]] for ''N'' particles:

:&lt;math&gt;
PV = Nk_{B} T = nRT,\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n''&amp;nbsp;= ''N''/''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of moles of gas and ''R''&amp;nbsp;= ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[gas constant]]. Although equipartition provides a simple derivation of the ideal-gas law and the internal energy, the same results can be obtained by an alternative method using the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]].&lt;ref name="configint"&gt;

===Diatomic gases===
{{See also|Two-body problem|Rigid rotor|Harmonic oscillator}}

A diatomic gas can be modelled as two masses, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, joined by a [[spring (device)|spring]] of [[Hooke's law|stiffness]] ''a'', which is called the ''rigid rotor-harmonic oscillator approximation''.&lt;ref name="mcquarrie_2000c" &gt;{{cite book | last = McQuarrie | first = DA | year = 2000 | title = Statistical Mechanics | edition = revised 2nd | publisher = University Science Books | isbn = 978-1-891389-15-3 | pages = 91–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classical energy of this system is

:&lt;math&gt;
H = 
\frac{\left| \mathbf{p}_{1} \right|^{2}}{2m_{1}} + 
\frac{\left| \mathbf{p}_{2} \right|^{2}}{2m_{2}} + 
\frac{1}{2} a q^{2},
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the momenta of the two atoms, and ''q'' is the deviation of the inter-atomic separation from its equilibrium value. Every degree of freedom in the energy is quadratic and, thus, should contribute {{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' to the total average energy, and {{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; to the heat capacity. Therefore, the heat capacity of a gas of ''N'' diatomic molecules is predicted to be 7''N''·{{frac|1|2}}''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;: the momenta '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contribute three degrees of freedom each, and the extension ''q'' contributes the seventh. It follows that the heat capacity of a mole of diatomic molecules with no other degrees of freedom should be (7/2)''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= (7/2)''R'' and, thus, the predicted molar heat capacity should be roughly 7&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K). However, the experimental values for molar heat capacities of diatomic gases are typically about 5&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K)&lt;ref name="Wueller_1896" /&gt; and fall to 3&amp;nbsp;cal/(mol·K) at very low temperatures.&lt;ref name="Eucken_1912" /&gt; This disagreement between the equipartition prediction and the experimental value of the molar heat capacity cannot be explained by using a more complex model of the molecule, since adding more degrees of freedom can only ''increase'' the predicted specific heat, not decrease it.&lt;ref name="maxwell_1875" /&gt; This discrepancy was a key piece of evidence showing the need for a [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] of matter.

At the heart of this nebula there is a rapidly rotating [[neutron star]] which has about one and a half times the mass of the [[Sun]] but is only 25 km across. The equipartition theorem is useful in predicting the properties of such neutron stars.]]

===Extreme relativistic ideal gases===
{{See also|Special relativity|White dwarf|Neutron star}}

Equipartition was used above to derive the classical [[ideal gas law]] from [[Newtonian mechanics]]. However, [[special relativity|relativistic effects]] become dominant in some systems, such as [[white dwarf]]s and [[neutron star]]s,&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt; and the ideal gas equations must be modified. The equipartition theorem provides a convenient way to derive the corresponding laws for an extreme relativistic [[ideal gas]].&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt; In such cases, the kinetic energy of a [[relativistic particle|single particle]] is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{kin}} \approx cp = c \sqrt{p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2} + p_{z}^{2}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the derivative of ''H'' with respect to the ''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' momentum component gives the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
p_x \frac{\partial H_{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_x}  = c \frac{p_x^2}{\sqrt{p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2}}
&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for the ''p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' components. Adding the three components together gives

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\langle H_{\mathrm{kin}} \rangle
&amp;= \biggl\langle c \frac{p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2} + p_{z}^{2}}{\sqrt{p_{x}^{2} + p_{y}^{2} + p_{z}^{2}}}  \biggr\rangle\\
&amp;= \Bigl\langle p_{x} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{x}} \Bigr\rangle + 
\Bigl\langle p_{y} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{y}} \Bigr\rangle + 
\Bigl\langle p_{z} \frac{\partial H^{\mathrm{kin}}}{\partial p_{z}} \Bigr\rangle\\
&amp;= 3 k_{B} T
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where the last equality follows from the equipartition formula. Thus, the average total energy of an extreme relativistic gas is twice that of the non-relativistic case: for ''N'' particles, it is 3&amp;nbsp;''Nk''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''.

===Non-ideal gases===
{{See also|Virial expansion|Virial coefficient}}

In an ideal gas the particles are assumed to interact only through collisions. The equipartition theorem may also be used to derive the energy and pressure of "non-ideal gases" in which the particles also interact with one another through [[conservative force]]s whose potential ''U''(''r'') depends only on the distance ''r'' between the particles.&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt; This situation can be described by first restricting attention to a single gas particle, and approximating the rest of the gas by a [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetric]] distribution. It is then customary to introduce a [[radial distribution function]] ''g''(''r'') such that the [[probability density function|probability density]] of finding another particle at a distance ''r'' from the given particle is equal to 4π''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''ρg''(''r''), where ''ρ''&amp;nbsp;= ''N''/''V'' is the mean [[density]] of the gas.&lt;ref name="mcquarrie_2000b" &gt;{{cite book | last = McQuarrie | first = DA | year = 2000 | title = Statistical Mechanics | edition = revised 2nd | publisher = University Science Books | isbn = 978-1-891389-15-3 | pages = 254–264}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that the mean potential energy associated to the interaction of the given particle with the rest of the gas is

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle h_{\mathrm{pot}} \rangle = \int_{0}^{\infty} 4\pi r^{2} \rho U(r) g(r)\, dr.
&lt;/math&gt;

The total mean potential energy of the gas is therefore &lt;math&gt; \langle H_{pot} \rangle = \tfrac12 N \langle h_{\mathrm{pot}} \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, where ''N'' is the number of particles in the gas, and the factor {{frac|1|2}} is needed because summation over all the particles counts each interaction twice.
Adding kinetic and potential energies, then applying equipartition, yields the ''energy equation''

:&lt;math&gt;
H = 
\langle H_{\mathrm{kin}} \rangle + \langle H_{\mathrm{pot}} \rangle = 
\frac{3}{2} Nk_{B}T + 2\pi N \rho \int_{0}^{\infty} r^{2} U(r) g(r) \, dr.
&lt;/math&gt;

A similar argument,&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt; can be used to derive the ''pressure equation''

:&lt;math&gt;
3Nk_{\rm B}T = 3PV + 2\pi N \rho \int_{0}^{\infty} r^{3} U'(r) g(r)\, dr.
&lt;/math&gt;

===Anharmonic oscillators===
{{See also|Anharmonic oscillator}}

An anharmonic oscillator (in contrast to a simple harmonic oscillator) is one in which the potential energy is not quadratic in the extension ''q'' (the [[canonical coordinate|generalized position]] which measures the deviation of the system from equilibrium). Such oscillators provide a complementary point of view on the equipartition theorem.&lt;ref name="tolman_1927" &gt;{{cite book | last = Tolman | first = RC | authorlink = Richard C. Tolman | year = 1927 | title = Statistical Mechanics, with Applications to Physics and Chemistry | publisher = Chemical Catalog Company | pages = 76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="terletskii_1971" &gt;{{cite book | last = Terletskii | first = YP | year = 1971 | title = Statistical Physics | edition = translated: N. Fröman | publisher = North-Holland | location = Amsterdam | isbn = 0-7204-0221-2 | pages = 83–84 | lccn = 70157006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple examples are provided by potential energy functions of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{pot}} = C q^{s},\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C'' and ''s'' are arbitrary [[real number|real constants]]. In these cases, the law of equipartition predicts that

:&lt;math&gt;
k_{\rm B} T = \Bigl\langle q \frac{\partial H_{\mathrm{pot}}}{\partial q} \Bigr\rangle = 
\langle q \cdot s C q^{s-1} \rangle = \langle s C q^{s} \rangle = s \langle H_{\mathrm{pot}} \rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the average potential energy equals ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/''s'', not ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''/2 as for the quadratic harmonic oscillator (where ''s''&amp;nbsp;= 2).

More generally, a typical energy function of a one-dimensional system has a [[Taylor expansion]] in the extension ''q'':

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{pot}} = \sum_{n=2}^{\infty} C_{n} q^{n}
&lt;/math&gt;

for non-negative [[integer]]s ''n''. There is no ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 1 term, because at the equilibrium point, there is no net force and so the first derivative of the energy is zero. The ''n''&amp;nbsp;= 0 term need not be included, since the energy at the equilibrium position may be set to zero by convention. In this case, the law of equipartition predicts that&lt;ref name="tolman_1927" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
k_{B} T = \Bigl\langle q \frac{\partial H_{\mathrm{pot}}}{\partial q} \Bigr\rangle = 
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} \langle q \cdot n C_{n} q^{n-1} \rangle = 
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty} n C_{n} \langle q^{n} \rangle.
&lt;/math&gt;

In contrast to the other examples cited here, the equipartition formula
:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H_{\mathrm{pot}} \rangle = \frac{1}{2} k_{\rm B} T - 
\sum_{n=3}^{\infty} \left( \frac{n - 2}{2} \right) C_{n} \langle q^{n} \rangle
&lt;/math&gt;
does ''not'' allow the average potential energy to be written in terms of known constants.

===Brownian motion===
[[Image:Wiener process 3d.png|thumb|right|400px|Figure 7. Typical Brownian motion of a particle in three dimensions.]]
{{See also|Brownian motion}}

The equipartition theorem can be used to derive the [[Brownian motion]] of a particle from the [[Langevin equation]].&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt; According to that equation, the motion of a particle of mass ''m'' with velocity '''v''' is governed by [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \frac{1}{m} \mathbf{F} = -\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\tau} + \frac{1}{m} \mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{rnd}},
&lt;/math&gt;

where '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;rnd&lt;/sub&gt; is a random force representing the random collisions of the particle and the surrounding molecules, and where the [[time constant]] τ reflects the [[drag (physics)|drag force]] that opposes the particle's motion through the solution. The drag force is often written '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;drag&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= −γ'''v'''; therefore, the time constant τ equals ''m''/γ.

The dot product of this equation with the position vector '''r''', after averaging, yields the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle \mathbf{r} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} \Bigr\rangle + 
\frac{1}{\tau} \langle \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v} \rangle = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

for Brownian motion (since the random force '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;rnd&lt;/sub&gt; is uncorrelated with the position '''r'''). Using the mathematical identities

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{r} \right) = 
\frac{d}{dt} \left( r^{2} \right) = 2 \left( \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v} \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \mathbf{r} \cdot \mathbf{v} \right) = v^{2} + \mathbf{r} \cdot \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt},
&lt;/math&gt;

the basic equation for Brownian motion can be transformed into

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d^{2}}{dt^{2}} \langle r^{2} \rangle + \frac{1}{\tau} \frac{d}{dt} \langle r^{2} \rangle = 
2 \langle v^{2} \rangle = \frac{6}{m} k_{\rm B} T,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the last equality follows from the equipartition theorem for translational kinetic energy:

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H_{\mathrm{kin}} \rangle = \Bigl\langle \frac{p^{2}}{2m} \Bigr\rangle = \langle \tfrac{1}{2} m v^{2} \rangle = \tfrac{3}{2} k_{\rm B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

The above [[differential equation]] for &lt;math&gt;\langle r^2\rangle&lt;/math&gt; (with suitable initial conditions) may be solved exactly:

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle r^{2} \rangle = \frac{6k_{\rm B} T \tau^{2}}{m} \left( e^{-t/\tau} - 1 + \frac{t}{\tau} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

On small time scales, with ''t''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&lt; ''τ'', the particle acts as a freely moving particle: by the [[Taylor series]] of the [[exponential function]], the squared distance grows approximately ''quadratically'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle r^{2} \rangle \approx \frac{3k_{\rm B} T}{m} t^{2} = \langle v^{2} \rangle t^{2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

However, on long time scales, with ''t''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&gt; ''τ'', the exponential and constant terms are negligible, and the squared distance grows only ''linearly'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle r^{2} \rangle \approx \frac{6k_{B} T\tau}{m} t = \frac{6 k_{B} T t}{\gamma}.
&lt;/math&gt;

This describes the [[diffusion]] of the particle over time. An analogous equation for the rotational diffusion of a rigid molecule can be derived in a similar way.

===Stellar physics===
{{See also|Astrophysics|Stellar structure}}

The equipartition theorem and the related [[virial theorem]] have long been used as a tool in [[astrophysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Collins | first = GW | year = 1978 | title = The Virial Theorem in Stellar Astrophysics  | url = http://ads.harvard.edu/books/1978vtsa.book/ | publisher = Pachart Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, the virial theorem may be used to estimate stellar temperatures or the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] on the mass of [[white dwarf]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chandrasekhar | first = S | authorlink = Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar | year = 1939 | title = An Introduction to the Study of Stellar Structure | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | pages = 49–53 | isbn = 0-486-60413-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kourganoff | first = V | year = 1980 | title = Introduction to Advanced Astrophysics | publisher = D. Reidel | location = Dordrecht, Holland | pages = 59–60, 134–140, 181–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average temperature of a star can be estimated from the equipartition theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chiu | first = H-Y | year = 1968 | title = Stellar Physics, volume I | publisher = Blaisdell Publishing | location = Waltham, MA | lccn = 67017990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since most stars are spherically symmetric, the total [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational]] [[Potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|potential energy]] can be estimated by integration

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{grav}} = -\int_0^R \frac{4\pi r^2 G}{r} M(r)\, \rho(r)\, dr,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M''(''r'') is the mass within a radius ''r'' and ''ρ''(''r'') is the stellar density at radius ''r''; ''G'' represents the [[gravitational constant]] and ''R'' the total radius of the star. Assuming a constant density throughout the star, this integration yields the formula

:&lt;math&gt;
H_{\mathrm{grav}} = - \frac{3G M^{2}}{5R},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''M'' is the star's total mass. Hence, the average potential energy of a single particle is

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H_{\mathrm{grav}} \rangle = \frac{H_{\mathrm{grav}}}{N} = - \frac{3G M^{2}}{5RN},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is the number of particles in the star. Since most [[star]]s are composed mainly of [[ion]]ized [[hydrogen]], ''N'' equals roughly ''M''/''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''m''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of one proton. Application of the equipartition theorem gives an estimate of the star's temperature

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle r \frac{\partial H_{\mathrm{grav}}}{\partial r} \Bigr\rangle = \langle -H_{\mathrm{grav}} \rangle = 
k_B T = \frac{3G M^2}{5RN}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Substitution of the mass and radius of the [[Sun]] yields an estimated solar temperature of ''T''&amp;nbsp;= 14 million kelvins, very close to its core temperature of 15 million kelvins. However, the Sun is much more complex than assumed by this model—both its temperature and density vary strongly with radius—and such excellent agreement (≈7% [[approximation error|relative error]]) is partly fortuitous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Noyes | first = RW | year = 1982 | title = The Sun, Our Star | publisher = Harvard University Press | location = Cambridge, MA | isbn = 0-674-85435-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Star formation===
The same formulae may be applied to determining the conditions for [[star formation]] in giant [[molecular cloud]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ostlie | first = DA |author2=Carroll BW | year = 1996 | title = An Introduction to Modern Stellar Astrophysics | publisher = Addison–Wesley | location = Reading, MA | isbn = 0-201-59880-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A local fluctuation in the density of such a cloud can lead to a runaway condition in which the cloud collapses inwards under its own gravity. Such a collapse occurs when the equipartition theorem—or, equivalently, the [[virial theorem]]—is no longer valid, i.e., when the gravitational potential energy exceeds twice the kinetic energy

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{3G M^{2}}{5R} &gt; 3 N k_{B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming a constant density ρ for the cloud

:&lt;math&gt;
M = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^{3} \rho
&lt;/math&gt;

yields a minimum mass for stellar contraction, the Jeans mass ''M''&lt;sub&gt;J&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
M_{\rm J}^{2} = \left( \frac{5k_{B}T}{G m_{p}} \right)^{3} \left( \frac{3}{4\pi \rho} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the values typically observed in such clouds (''T''&amp;nbsp;= 150&amp;nbsp;K, ρ&amp;nbsp;= 2{{e|&amp;minus;16}}&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) gives an estimated minimum mass of 17 solar masses, which is consistent with observed star formation. This effect is also known as the [[Jeans instability]], after the British physicist [[James Hopwood Jeans]] who published it in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Jeans | first = JH | authorlink = James Hopwood Jeans | year = 1902 | title = The Stability of a Spherical Nebula | journal = [[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A]] | volume = 199 | issue = 312–320 | pages = 1–53 | doi = 10.1098/rsta.1902.0012 | bibcode=1902RSPTA.199....1J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivations==

===Kinetic energies and the Maxwell&amp;ndash;Boltzmann distribution===
The original formulation of the equipartition theorem states that, in any physical system in [[thermal equilibrium]], every particle has exactly the same average [[kinetic energy]], (3/2)''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''.&lt;ref name="mcquarrie_2000a" &gt;{{cite book | last = McQuarrie | first = DA | year = 2000 | title = Statistical Mechanics | edition = revised 2nd | publisher = University Science Books | isbn = 978-1-891389-15-3 | pages = 121–128}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be shown using the [[Maxwell&amp;ndash;Boltzmann distribution]] (see Figure 2), which is the probability distribution

:&lt;math&gt;
f (v) = 4 \pi 
\left( \frac{m}{2 \pi k_{\rm B} T}\right)^{3/2}\!\!v^2
\exp \Bigl(
\frac{-mv^2}{2k_{\rm B} T}
\Bigr)
&lt;/math&gt;

for the speed of a particle of mass ''m'' in the system, where the speed ''v'' is the magnitude &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[velocity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = (v_x,v_y,v_z).&lt;/math&gt;

The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution applies to any system composed of atoms, and assumes only a [[canonical ensemble]], specifically, that the kinetic energies are distributed according to their [[Boltzmann factor]] at a temperature ''T''.&lt;ref name="mcquarrie_2000a" /&gt; The average kinetic energy for a particle of mass ''m'' is then given by the integral formula

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H_{\mathrm{kin}} \rangle = 
\langle \tfrac{1}{2} m v^{2} \rangle = 
\int _{0}^{\infty} \tfrac{1}{2} m v^{2}\  f(v)\  dv = \tfrac{3}{2} k_{\rm B} T,
&lt;/math&gt;

as stated by the equipartition theorem. The same result can also be obtained by averaging the particle energy using the probability of finding the particle in certain quantum energy state.&lt;ref name="configint"/&gt;

===Quadratic energies and the partition function===
More generally, the equipartition theorem states that any [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] ''x'' which appears in the total energy ''H'' only as a simple quadratic term ''Ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''A'' is a constant, has an average energy of ½''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' in thermal equilibrium. In this case the equipartition theorem may be derived from the [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] ''Z''(''β''), where ''β''&amp;nbsp;= 1/(''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'') is the canonical [[inverse temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Callen | first = HB | authorlink = Herbert Callen | year = 1985 | title = Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics | publisher = John Wiley and Sons | location = New York | pages = 375–377 | isbn = 0-471-86256-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Integration over the variable ''x'' yields a factor

:&lt;math&gt;
Z_{x} = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx \ e^{-\beta A x^{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\beta A}},
&lt;/math&gt;

in the formula for ''Z''. The mean energy associated with this factor is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H_{x} \rangle = - \frac{\partial \log Z_{x}}{\partial \beta} = \frac{1}{2\beta} = \frac{1}{2} k_{\rm B} T
&lt;/math&gt;

as stated by the equipartition theorem.

===General proofs===
General derivations of the equipartition theorem can be found in many [[statistical mechanics]] textbooks, both for the [[microcanonical ensemble]]&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt; and for the [[canonical ensemble]].&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tolman_1938" /&gt;
They involve taking averages over the [[phase space]] of the system, which is a [[symplectic manifold]].

To explain these derivations, the following notation is introduced. First, the phase space is described in terms of [[canonical coordinates|generalized position coordinates]] ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; together with their [[conjugate momentum|conjugate momenta]] ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;. The quantities ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; completely describe the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system, while the quantities (''q''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;,''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;) together completely describe its [[Classical mechanics|state]].

Secondly, the infinitesimal volume
:&lt;math&gt;
d\Gamma = \prod_i  dq_i \, dp_i \,
&lt;/math&gt;

of the phase space is introduced and used to define the volume Σ(''E'', Δ''E'') of the portion of phase space where the energy ''H'' of the system lies between two limits, ''E'' and ''E''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Δ''E'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\Sigma (E, \Delta E) = \int_{H \in \left[E, E+\Delta E \right]} d\Gamma .
&lt;/math&gt;
In this expression, Δ''E'' is assumed to be very small, Δ''E''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&lt; ''E''. Similarly, Ω(''E'') is defined to be the total volume of phase space where the energy is less than ''E'':

:&lt;math&gt;
\Omega (E) = \int_{H &lt; E} d\Gamma.\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Since Δ''E'' is very small, the following integrations are equivalent

:&lt;math&gt;
\int_{H \in \left[ E, E+\Delta E \right]} \ldots d\Gamma  = \Delta E \frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_{H &lt; E} \ldots d\Gamma,
&lt;/math&gt;

where the ellipses represent the integrand. From this, it follows that Γ is proportional to Δ''E''

:&lt;math&gt;
\Sigma = \Delta E \ \frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial E} = \Delta E \ \rho(E),
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''ρ''(''E'') is the [[density of states]]. By the usual definitions of [[statistical mechanics]], the [[entropy]] ''S'' equals ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; log ''Ω''(''E''), and the [[temperature]] ''T'' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{T} = \frac{\partial S}{\partial E} = k_{\rm B} \frac{\partial \log \Omega}{\partial E} = k_{\rm B} \frac{1}{\Omega}\,\frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial E} .
&lt;/math&gt;

====The canonical ensemble====
In the [[canonical ensemble]], the system is in [[thermal equilibrium]] with an infinite heat bath at [[temperature]] ''T'' (in kelvins).&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tolman_1938" /&gt; The probability of each state in [[phase space]] is given by its [[Boltzmann factor]] times a [[normalization factor]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{N}&lt;/math&gt;, which is chosen so that the probabilities sum to one

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{N} \int e^{-\beta H(p, q)} d\Gamma = 1,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''β''&amp;nbsp;= 1/''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''. [[Integration by parts]] for a phase-space variable ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' (which could be either ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'') between two limits ''a'' and ''b'' yields the equation

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{N} \int  \left[ e^{-\beta H(p, q)} x_{k} \right]_{x_{k}=a}^{x_{k}=b} d\Gamma_{k}+ 
\mathcal{N} \int  e^{-\beta H(p, q)} x_{k} \beta \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{k}} d\Gamma = 1,
&lt;/math&gt;

where d''Γ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;= d''Γ''/d''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'', i.e., the first integration is not carried out over ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. The first term is usually zero, either because ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' is zero at the limits, or because the energy goes to infinity at those limits. In that case, the equipartition theorem for the canonical ensemble follows immediately

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathcal{N} \int e^{-\beta H(p, q)} x_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{k}} \,d\Gamma = 
\Bigl\langle x_{k} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{k}} \Bigr\rangle = \frac{1}{\beta} = k_{B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here, the averaging symbolized by &lt;math&gt;\langle \ldots \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the [[ensemble average]] taken over the [[canonical ensemble]].

====The microcanonical ensemble====
In the microcanonical ensemble, the system is isolated from the rest of the world, or at least very weakly coupled to it.&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt; Hence, its total energy is effectively constant; to be definite, we say that the total energy ''H'' is confined between ''E'' and ''E''+d''E''. For a given energy ''E'' and spread d''E'', there is a region of [[phase space]] Σ in which the system has that energy, and the probability of each state in that region of [[phase space]] is equal, by the definition of the microcanonical ensemble. Given these definitions, the equipartition average of phase-space variables ''x&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' (which could be either ''q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''or ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'') and ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr \rangle &amp;=
\frac{1}{\Sigma}   \, \int_{H \in \left[ E, E+\Delta E \right]}  x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \,d\Gamma\\
&amp;=\frac{\Delta E}{\Sigma}\, \frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_{H &lt; E}  x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \,d\Gamma\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\rho} \,\frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_{H &lt; E}  x_{m} \frac{\partial \left( H - E \right)}{\partial x_{n}} \,d\Gamma,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where the last equality follows because ''E'' is a constant that does not depend on ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''. [[Integration by parts|Integrating by parts]] yields the relation

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\int_{H &lt; E}  x_{m} \frac{\partial ( H - E )}{\partial x_{n}} \,d\Gamma &amp;= 
\int_{H &lt; E}  \frac{\partial}{\partial x_{n}} \bigl( x_{m} ( H - E ) \bigr) \,d\Gamma - 
\int_{H &lt; E}  \delta_{mn} ( H - E ) d\Gamma\\
&amp;=  \delta_{mn} \int_{H &lt; E} ( E - H ) \,d\Gamma,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
since the first term on the right hand side of the first line is zero (it can be rewritten as an integral of ''H'' − ''E'' on the [[hypersurface]] where ''H'' = ''E'').

Substitution of this result into the previous equation yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = 
\delta_{mn} \frac{1}{\rho} \, \frac{\partial}{\partial E} \int_{H &lt; E}\left( E - H \right)\,d\Gamma  = 
\delta_{mn}  \frac{1}{\rho}  \, \int_{H &lt; E} \,d\Gamma = 
\delta_{mn}  \frac{\Omega}{\rho}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt; \rho = \frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial E} &lt;/math&gt; the equipartition theorem follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = 
\delta_{mn} \Bigl(\frac{1}{\Omega} \frac{\partial \Omega}{\partial E}\Bigr)^{-1}  = 
\delta_{mn} \Bigl(\frac{\partial \log \Omega} {\partial E}\Bigr)^{-1} = \delta_{mn} k_{B} T.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, we have derived the [[#General_formulation_for_all_energies|general formulation of the equipartition theorem]]

&lt;div style="border:2px solid black; padding:3px; margin-left: 0em; width: 250px;
text-align:left"&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\!
\Bigl\langle x_{m} \frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{n}} \Bigr\rangle = \delta_{mn} k_{B} T,
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

which was so useful in the [[#Applications|applications]] described above.

==Limitations==
[[Image:1D normal modes (280 kB).gif|frame|right|Figure 9. Energy is ''not'' shared among the various [[normal modes]] in an isolated system of ideal coupled [[harmonic oscillator|oscillators]]; the energy in each mode is constant and independent of the energy in the other modes. Hence, the equipartition theorem does ''not'' hold for such a system in the [[microcanonical ensemble]] (when isolated), although it does hold in the [[canonical ensemble]] (when coupled to a heat bath). However, by adding a sufficiently strong nonlinear coupling between the modes, energy will be shared and equipartition holds in both ensembles.]]

===Requirement of ergodicity===
{{See also|Ergodicity|Chaos theory|Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem|Solitons}}

The law of equipartition holds only for [[ergodic hypothesis|ergodic]] systems in [[thermal equilibrium]], which implies that all states with the same energy must be equally likely to be populated.&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt; Consequently, it must be possible to exchange energy among all its various forms within the system, or with an external [[heat bath]] in the [[canonical ensemble]]. The number of physical systems that have been rigorously proven to be ergodic is small; a famous example is the [[dynamical billiards|hard-sphere system]] of [[Yakov G. Sinai|Yakov Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Arnold | first = VI | authorlink = Vladimir Arnold |author2=Avez A | year = 1957 | title = Théorie ergodique des systèms dynamiques | publisher = Gauthier-Villars, Paris.  (English edition: Benjamin-Cummings, Reading, Mass. 1968)|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The requirements for isolated systems to ensure [[ergodic theory|ergodicity]]—and, thus equipartition—have been studied, and provided motivation for the modern [[chaos theory]] of [[dynamical system]]s. A chaotic [[Hamiltonian system]] need not be ergodic, although that is usually a good assumption.&lt;ref name="reichl_1998" /&gt;

A commonly cited counter-example where energy is ''not'' shared among its various forms and where equipartition does ''not'' hold in the microcanonical ensemble is a system of coupled harmonic oscillators.&lt;ref name="reichl_1998" &gt;{{cite book | last = Reichl | first = LE | year = 1998 | title = A Modern Course in Statistical Physics | edition = 2nd | publisher = Wiley Interscience | isbn = 978-0-471-59520-5 | pages = 326–333}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the system is isolated from the rest of the world, the energy in each [[normal mode]] is constant; energy is not transferred from one mode to another. Hence, equipartition does not hold for such a system; the amount of energy in each normal mode is fixed at its initial value. If sufficiently strong nonlinear terms are present in the [[energy]] function, energy may be transferred between the normal modes, leading to ergodicity and rendering the law of equipartition valid. However, the [[Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theorem]] states that energy will not be exchanged unless the nonlinear perturbations are strong enough; if they are too small, the energy will remain trapped in at least some of the modes.

Another way ergodicity can be broken is by the existence of nonlinear [[soliton]] symmetries. In 1953, [[Enrico Fermi|Fermi]], [[John Pasta|Pasta]], [[Stanislaw Ulam|Ulam]] and [[Mary Tsingou|Tsingou]] conducted [[Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem|computer simulations]] of a vibrating string that included a non-linear term (quadratic in one test, cubic in another, and a piecewise linear approximation to a cubic in a third). They found that the behavior of the system was quite different from what intuition based on equipartition would have led them to expect. Instead of the energies in the modes becoming equally shared, the system exhibited a very complicated quasi-periodic behavior. This puzzling result was eventually explained by Kruskal and Zabusky in 1965 in a paper which, by connecting the simulated system to the [[Korteweg–de Vries equation]] led to the development of soliton mathematics.

===Failure due to quantum effects===
{{See also|Ultraviolet catastrophe|History of quantum mechanics|Identical particles}}

The law of equipartition breaks down when the thermal energy ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T'' is significantly smaller than the spacing between energy levels. Equipartition no longer holds because it is a poor approximation to assume that the energy levels form a smooth [[continuum (theory)|continuum]], which is required in the [[#Derivations|derivations of the equipartition theorem above]].&lt;ref name="pathria_1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt; Historically, the failures of the classical equipartition theorem to explain [[specific heats]] and [[blackbody radiation]] were critical in showing the need for a new theory of matter and radiation, namely, [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum field theory]].&lt;ref name="pais_1982" /&gt;

[[Image:Et fig2.png|left|thumb|400px|Figure 10. Log–log plot of the average energy of a quantum mechanical oscillator (shown in red) as a function of temperature. For comparison, the value predicted by the equipartition theorem is shown in black. At high temperatures, the two agree nearly perfectly, but at low temperatures when ''k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T &lt;&lt; hν'', the quantum mechanical value decreases much more rapidly. This resolves the problem of the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]]: for a given temperature, the energy in the high-frequency modes (where ''hν &gt;&gt; k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T'') is almost zero.]]

To illustrate the breakdown of equipartition, consider the average energy in a single (quantum) harmonic oscillator, which was discussed above for the classical case. Neglecting the irrelevant [[zero-point energy]] term, its quantum energy levels are given by ''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= nhν'', where ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]], ''ν'' is the [[fundamental frequency]] of the oscillator, and ''n'' is an integer. The probability of a given energy level being populated in the [[canonical ensemble]] is given by its [[Boltzmann factor]]

:&lt;math&gt;
P(E_{n}) = \frac{e^{-n\beta h\nu}}{Z},
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''β''&amp;nbsp;= 1/''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' and the denominator ''Z'' is the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]], here a [[geometric series]]

:&lt;math&gt;
Z = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} e^{-n\beta h\nu} = \frac{1}{1 - e^{-\beta h\nu}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Its average energy is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H \rangle = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} E_{n} P(E_{n}) =
\frac{1}{Z} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} nh\nu \ e^{-n\beta h\nu} = 
-\frac{1}{Z} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \beta} = 
-\frac{\partial \log Z}{\partial \beta}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the formula for ''Z'' gives the final result&lt;ref name="huang_1987" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\langle H \rangle = h\nu \frac{e^{-\beta h\nu}}{1 - e^{-\beta h\nu}}.
&lt;/math&gt;

At high temperatures, when the thermal energy ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' is much greater than the spacing ''hν'' between energy levels, the exponential argument ''βhν'' is much less than one and the average energy becomes ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', in agreement with the equipartition theorem (Figure 10). However, at low temperatures, when ''hν''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&gt; ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', the average energy goes to zero—the higher-frequency energy levels are "frozen out" (Figure 10). As another example, the internal excited electronic states of a hydrogen atom do not contribute to its specific heat as a gas at room temperature, since the thermal energy ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'' (roughly 0.025&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]]) is much smaller than the spacing between the lowest and next higher electronic energy levels (roughly 10&amp;nbsp;eV).

Similar considerations apply whenever the energy level spacing is much larger than the thermal energy. This reasoning was used by [[Max Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein]], among others, to resolve the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]] of [[blackbody radiation]].&lt;ref name="Einstein1905"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Einstein | first = A | authorlink = Albert Einstein | year = 1905 | title = Über einen die Erzeugung und Verwandlung des Lichtes betreffenden heuristischen Gesichtspunkt (A Heuristic Model of the Creation and Transformation of Light) | journal = [[Annalen der Physik]] | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 132&amp;ndash;148 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2094597 | doi = 10.1002/andp.19053220607|bibcode = 1905AnP...322..132E |language=de}}. An [[s:A Heuristic Model of the Creation and Transformation of Light|English translation]] is available from [[Wikisource]].&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox arises because there are an infinite number of independent modes of the [[electromagnetic field]] in a closed container, each of which may be treated as a harmonic oscillator. If each electromagnetic mode were to have an average energy ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T'', there would be an infinite amount of energy in the container.&lt;ref name="Einstein1905" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rayleigh | first = JWS | authorlink = John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh | year = 1900 | title = Remarks upon the Law of Complete Radiation | journal = [[Philosophical Magazine]] | volume = 49 | pages = 539–540 | doi=10.1080/14786440009463878}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the reasoning above, the average energy in the higher-frequency modes goes to zero as ''ν'' goes to infinity; moreover, [[Planck's law of black body radiation]], which describes the experimental distribution of energy in the modes, follows from the same reasoning.&lt;ref name="Einstein1905" /&gt;

Other, more subtle quantum effects can lead to corrections to equipartition, such as [[identical particles]] and [[symmetry|continuous symmetries]]. The effects of identical particles can be dominant at very high densities and low temperatures. For example, the [[valence electron]]s in a metal can have a mean kinetic energy of a few [[electronvolt]]s, which would normally correspond to a temperature of tens of thousands of kelvins. Such a state, in which the density is high enough that the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] invalidates the classical approach, is called a [[degenerate matter|degenerate fermion gas]]. Such gases are important for the structure of [[white dwarf]] and [[neutron star]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} At low temperatures, a [[fermionic condensate|fermionic analogue]] of the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] (in which a large number of identical particles occupy the lowest-energy state) can form; such [[superfluid]] electrons are responsible{{dubious|date=May 2018}} for [[superconductivity]].

However, the Institute of Development Studies also concluded that there have been some major improvements for workers.&lt;ref name="Major Improvements"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Birch|first1=Simon|title=Ethical Trading Initiative|journal=Ethical Consumer|date=Jan–Feb 2007|issue=104|url=http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/commentanalysis/ethicalsceptic/ethicaltradinginitiative.aspx|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Kearney, General Secretary of the International, Textile, Garment and Leather Workers’ Federation, stated that progress had been made "particularly with regard to the issues of health and safety and child labour."&lt;ref name="Major Improvements" /&gt; In [[Vietnam]], local communities have benefited from improvements to health and safety as well as reductions in working hours.&lt;ref name="Vietnam Report"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on the ETI Impact Assessment: Vietnam|url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/files/ETI_impact_2b_vietnam_get.pdf|website=Ethical Trading Initiative|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements have also been made particularly in regards to fire safety, medical services, and infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Vietnam Report" /&gt; In [[South Africa]] two farms implemented a policy on ethical treatment due to the ETI base code, but major improvements are still yet to be made in regards to child labour, trade unions, and communication between farms and organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on ETI Impact Assessment 2006: South Africa|url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/files/ETI_impact_2c_southafrica_get.pdf|website=Ethical Trading Initiative|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palgrave Macmillan. p 236.&lt;/ref&gt; While fear of crime can be differentiated into public feelings, thoughts and behaviors about the personal risk of criminal victimization, distinctions can also be made between the tendency to see situations as fearful, the actual experience while in those situations, and broader expressions about the cultural and social significance of crime and symbols of crime in people's neighborhoods and in their daily, symbolic lives.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel, U. &amp; Greve, W.

Importantly, feelings, thoughts and behaviors can have a number of functional and dysfunctional effects on individual and group life, depending on actual risk and people's subjective approaches to danger. On a negative side, they can erode public health and psychological well-being; they can alter routine activities and habits; they can contribute to some places turning into 'no-go' areas via a withdrawal from community; and they can drain community cohesion, trust and neighborhood stability.&lt;ref name="Hale" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stafford, M., Chandola, T., &amp; Marmot, M.

Fear of crime has had a profound impact on the U.S. incarceration rate, having inspired the "tough on crime" policies of the 1980s that led to Draconian sentences being widespread. It should be noted that crime rates started decreasing before the new sentencing policies were implemented. Also significant is how despite the decrease in crime, media coverage of crime increased by 600% between 1998 and 2008. The media's "[[culture of fear]]" has largely been dominated by frequent stories of crime and punishment.

==Affective aspects of fear of crime==
The core aspect of fear of crime is the range of emotions that is provoked in citizens by the possibility of victimization. While people may feel angry and outraged about the extent and prospect of crime, surveys typically ask people "who they are afraid of" and "how worried they are". Underlying the answers that people give are (more often than not) two dimensions of 'fear': (a) those everyday moments of worry that transpire when one feels personally threatened; and (b) some more diffuse or 'ambient' anxiety about risk. While standard measures of worry about crime regularly show between 30% and 50% of the population of England and Wales express some kind of worry about falling victim, probing reveals that few individuals actually worry for their own safety on an everyday basis.&lt;ref&gt;Farrall, S. &amp; Gadd, D. (2004). The frequency of the fear of crime. British Journal of Criminology, 44, 127-132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, E., Jackson, J. and Farrall, S. (2008). Reassessing the Fear of Crime, European Journal of Criminology, 5, 3, 363-380.&lt;/ref&gt; One thus can distinguish between fear (an emotion, a feeling of alarm or dread caused by an awareness or expectation of danger) and some broader anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;Warr, M. (2000). Fear of crime in the United States: Avenues for research and policy. Criminal Justice, 4: 451—489.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sacco, V. (2005). When Crime Waves, Sage Publications/Pine Forge Press, Thousand Oaks, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; However it should be noted that some people may be more willing to admit their worries and vulnerabilities than others.&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, R. M., &amp; Farrall, S.D.  (2005). Gender, socially desirable responding and the fear of crime: Are women really more anxious about crime? British Journal of Criminology, 45, 212-224.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cognitive aspects of fear of crime==
Concern about crime can be differentiated from perceptions of the risk of personal victimization (i.e. cognitive aspects of fear of crime). Concern about crime includes public assessments of the size of the crime problem&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. An example of a question that could be asked is whether crime has increased, decreased or stayed the same in a certain period (and/or in a certain area, for instance the respondents own neighborhood). Between 1972 and 2001, the [[Gallup (company)|Gallup Poll]] shows that American respondents think crime has decreased.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderveen, G. (2006). Interpreting Fear, Crime, Risk and Unsafety. BJU Legal Publishers, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the cognitive side of fear of crime includes public perceptions of the likelihood of falling victim, public senses of control over the possibility, and public estimations of the seriousness of the consequences of crime. People who feel especially vulnerable to [[victimization]] are likely to feel that they are especially likely to be targeted by criminals (i.e. victimization is likely), that they are unable to control the possibility (i.e. they have low self-efficacy), and that the consequences would be especially severe.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J. (2009). A Psychological Perspective on Vulnerability in the Fear of Crime. Psychology, Crime and Law, 15, 4, 365-390.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, these three different components of risk perception may interact: the impact of perceived likelihood on subsequent emotional response (worry, fear, anxiety, etc.) is likely to be especially strong among those who feel that consequences are high and self-efficacy is low.&lt;ref&gt;Warr, M. (1987). Fear of victimisation and sensitivity to risk. Journal of Quantitative Criminology, 3, 29-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavioral aspects of fear of crime==
A third way to measure fear of crime is to ask people whether they ever avoid certain areas, protect certain objects or take preventive measures. This way, measuring fear of crime can become a relatively straightforward thing, because the questions asked tap into actual behavior and 'objective' facts, such as the amount of money spent on a burglar-alarm or extra locks. Although, some researchers such as Jesse Omoregie argue that measuring fear of crime can be problematic as there are various factors like social desirability effects, respondents downplaying or over-exaggerating their fear which can affect the reliability of data&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Some degree of 'fear' might be healthy for some people, creating a 'natural defence' against crime. In short, when the risk of crime is real, a specific level of 'fear' might actually be 'functional': worry about crime might stimulate precaution which then makes people feel safer and lowers their risk of crime. The fear of crime is a very important feature in criminology.

==The influence of public perceptions of neighborhood breakdown and stability==
Perhaps the biggest influence on fear of crime is public concern about neighbourhood disorder, social cohesion and collective efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;Perkins, D. &amp; Taylor, R. (1996). Ecological assessments of community disorder: Their relationship to fear of crime and theoretical implications. American Journal of Community Psychology, 24, 63-107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wyant, B.R. (2008). Multilevel impacts of perceived incivilities and perceptions of crime risk on fear of crime isolating endogenous impacts. Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, 45, 39-64.&lt;/ref&gt; The incidence and risk of crime has become linked with perceived problems of social stability, moral consensus, and the collective informal control processes that underpin the social order of a neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Bannister, J. (1993). Locating fear: Environmental and ontological security. In H. Jones (Ed.), Crime and the urban environment  (pp. 69-84). Aldershot: Avebury.&lt;/ref&gt; Such 'day-to-day' issues ('young people hanging around', 'poor community spirit', 'low levels of trust and cohesion') produce information about risk and generate a sense of unease, insecurity and distrust in the environment (incivilities signal a lack of conventional courtesies and low-level social order in public places).&lt;ref&gt;Innes, M. (2004) Signal crimes and signal disorders: Notes on deviance as communicative action. British Journal of Sociology, 55, 317-334.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tulloch, M. (2003). Combining classificatory and discursive methods: Consistency and variability in responses to the threat of crime. British Journal of Social Psychology, 42(3), 461-476.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, E. (1971) Relations in Public. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, many people express through their fear of crime some broader concerns about neighbourhood breakdown, the loss of [[moral authority]], and the crumbling of civility and social capital.&lt;ref name="Girling" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farrall, S., Jackson, J. and Gray, E. (2009). 'Social Order and Fear of Crime in Contemporary Times', Oxford: Oxford University Press, Clarendon Studies in Criminology.&lt;/ref&gt;

People can come to different conclusions about the same social and physical environment: two individuals who live next door to each other and share the same neighbourhood can view local disorder quite differently.&lt;ref&gt;Carvalho, I. &amp; Lewis, D. A. (2003). Beyond community:  Reactions to crime and disorder among inner-city residents. Criminology, 41, 779-812.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, R. J. and Raudenbush, S. W. (2004). Seeing Disorder: Neighborhood Stigma and the Social Construction of "Broken Windows". Social Psychology Quarterly 67: 319-342.&lt;/ref&gt; Why might people have different levels of tolerance or sensitivity to these potentially ambiguous cues? UK research has suggested that broader social anxieties about the pace and direction of social change may shift levels of tolerance to ambiguous stimuli in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, J. (2004) 'Experience and Expression: Social and Cultural Significance in the Fear of Crime.' British Journal of Criminology, 44, 6, 946-966.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farrall, S., Jackson, J. and Gray, E. (October 2009). 'Social Order and the Fear of Crime in Contemporary Times'. Oxford: Oxford University Press, Clarendon Studies in Criminology.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who hold more authoritarian views about law and order, and who are especially concerned about a long-term deterioration of community, may be more likely to perceive disorder in their environment (net of the actual conditions of that environment). They may also be more likely to link these physical cues to problems of social cohesion and consensus, of declining quality of social bonds and informal social control.

==Interpersonal communication and the mass media==
[[File:Black news day (14390694137).jpg|thumb|Full front pages of Japanese newspapers about a crime that left 3 injured]]
Hearing about events; knowing others who have been victimised– these are thought to raise perceptions of the risk of victimisation.&lt;ref name="Skogan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, T. R. (1984) 'Assessing the risk of crime victimization: The integration of personal victimization experience and socially transmitted information.' Journal of Social Issues, 40, 27-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tyler, T.R. (1980) 'Impact of Directly and Indirectly Experienced Events: The Origin of Crime-related Judgements and Behaviours' Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 39:13-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Covington, J. and Taylor, R. B. (1991). "Fear of Crime in Urban Residential Neighbourhoods: Implications of Between- and Within- Neighborhood Sources for Current Models. The Sociological Quarterly, 32, 2, 231-249.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been described as a 'crime multiplier', or processes operating in the residential environment that would 'spread' the impacts of criminal events.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, R. B. and Hale, M. (1986). "Testing Alternative Models of Fear of Crime". The Journal of Criminal Law, Criminology and Police Science, 77, 1, 151-189. (This Journal later changed its name to Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology)&lt;/ref&gt; Such evidence exists that hearing of friends' or neighbours' victimisation increases anxiety that indirect experiences of crime may play a stronger role in anxieties about victimisation than direct experience. However, there is a cautionary note: '… many residents of a neighbourhood only know of [crime] indirectly via channels that may inflate, deflate, or garble the picture.'&lt;ref&gt;Skogan, W. (1986) '[http://www.skogan.org/files/Fear.of.Crime.and.Neighborhood.Change.1986.pdf Fear of crime and neighborhood change]'. Crime and Justice, 8, 203-229.&lt;/ref&gt; A subject's criminal risk perception is exaggerated by peer-communication on crime and only moderated by the own experience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brain-gain.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59%3Aexperience-and-communication-as-factors-explaining-criminal-risk-perception&amp;catid=56%3Acat-crime-perception&amp;Itemid=92&amp;lang=de{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public perceptions of the risk of crime are no doubt also strongly shaped by mass media coverage. Individuals pick up from media and interpersonal communication circulating images of the criminal event - the perpetrators, victims, motive, and representations of consequential, uncontrollable, and sensational crimes. The notion of 'stimulus similarity' may be key: if the reader of a newspaper identifies with the described victim, or feels that their own neighbourhood bears resemblance to the one described, then the image of risk may be taken up, personalised and translated into personal safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Winkel, F. W. &amp; Vrij, A. (1990). Fear of crime and mass media crime reports: Testing similarity hypotheses. International Review of Victimology, 1, 251-265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet the relationship between fear of crime and [[mass media]] is unclear, at least in its causal ordering. To put the dilemma in simple terms: do people fear crime because a lot of crime is being shown on television, or does television just provide footage about crimes because people fear crime and want to see what's going on? The complex nature of crime could allow the media to exploit social naivety, covering crime not only selective, but also distorting the everyday world of crime.&lt;ref&gt;Ferraro, K. (1995). Fear of Crime, Interpreting Victimisation Risk. State University of New York press, Albany.&lt;/ref&gt; Some say the media contribute to the climate of fear that is created, because the actual frequency of victimisation is a tiny fraction of potential crime.{{ref label|Ferraro1995|2|a}}

With crime accounting for up to 25 per cent&lt;ref&gt;Maguire, M. Morgan, R. and Reiner, R. (1997). Oxford Handbook of Criminology. Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; of news coverage, the quality and angle of the coverage becomes an issue. The media displays violent crime disproportionately, whilst neglecting minor crimes. The reality is violent crime has been declining in the past 10 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/violent-crime/violent-crime |title=FBI — Violent Crime |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The profile of offenders in the media is distorted, causing misunderstanding of criminal offending.

Unfortunately, however, despite an abundant literature on media effects – particularly the 'mean world' hypothesis – little work has been done into how representations, imagery and symbols of crime circulate in society, transmitted and transformed by multiple actors with a wide array of effects, only to translate into personal fears about crime. Perhaps future work will take account of the transmission mechanisms through which representations, beliefs and attitudes about societal risks are propagated in different social and cultural contexts.

==Fear of crime as socially constructed==

Fear of crime can also be understood from a [[social constructionist]] perspective.&lt;ref name="Lee_a"&gt;Lee, M. (2007). Inventing Fear of Crime: Criminology and the Politics of Anxiety. Willan, Collumpton.&lt;/ref&gt; The term and concept of fear of crime did not, for example, enter the public or political lexicon until the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;Lee, M. (2001). The Genesis of Fear of Crime. Theoretical Criminology (5) 4&lt;/ref&gt; That is not to say individuals did not fear crime victimization prior to this period, clearly they did at various points in history to varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, G. (1983). Hooligan : A History of Respectable Fears. London: Macmillan Press Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chevalier, L. (1973). Labouring Classes and Dangerous Classes in Paris in the First Half of the Nineteenth Century. New York: Howard Festig.&lt;/ref&gt; However it demonstrates that fear of crime only became part of a political economy when researchers began to measure and analyse it under the auspice of The US President's Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice which reported in 1967 &lt;ref&gt;Ennis, P. (1967). Criminal Victimisation in the United States: A Report of a National Survey.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Biderman, A. D., Johnson, L. A., McIntyre, J. and Weir, A. W.  (1967). Report on a Pilot Study in the District of Columbia on Victimisation and Attitudes Towards Law Enforcement.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reiss, A. S. j. (1967). Studies in Crime and law Enforcement in Major Metropolitan Areas, Volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Once fear of crime had a name it could be deployed as a political tactic in a law and order politics.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, R. (1969). The Fear of Crime (1st Edition). New York: Praeger, Frederick, A.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ditton, J., &amp; Farrall, S. (2000). Fear of crime. Aldershot: Ashgate.&lt;/ref&gt; It also became something that citizens could experience as an emotional response to the threat of victimisation.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, M. (1999). The Fear of Crime and Self-Governance: Towards a Genealogy. The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology, 32(3), 227-246&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of a 'fear of crime feedback loop' then allowed more citizens to be surveyed as fearful, more politicians to be able to use crime fear as a political issue, security products to be sold on the back of crime fear and so on in an ever-increasing spiral that popularised crime fear.&lt;ref name="Lee_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt; Moreover, once citizens were seen as being motivated by concerns about crime fear of crime could be used as a responsibilising technique to activate citizens to conduct themeselves or consume products in ways that reduce their vulnerability to crime victimisation.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, D. (2001). Culture of Control: Crime and Social Order in Contemporary Society. Chicago: The Chicage University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, M. (2007). Inventing Fear of Crime:and the Politics of Anxiety. Willan, Collumpton.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach to understanding fear of crime does not deny the experiences of individuals who fear crime victimisation but suggests that such experiences have to be understood as being intimately connected to broader socio-political contexts.

In vision, '''filling-in''' phenomena are those responsible for the completion of missing information across the [[blind spot (vision)|physiological blind spot]], and across natural and artificial [[scotomata]]. There is also evidence for similar mechanisms of completion in normal visual analysis. Classical demonstrations of perceptual filling-in involve filling in at the blind spot in monocular vision, and images stabilized on the retina either by means of special lenses, or under certain conditions of steady fixation. For example, naturally in monocular vision at the physiological blind spot, the percept is not a hole in the visual field, but the  content is “filled-in” based on information from the surrounding visual field. When a textured stimulus is presented centered on but extending beyond the region of the blind spot, a continuous texture is perceived. This partially inferred percept is paradoxically considered more reliable than a percept based on external input. (Ehinger ''et al.'' 2017).

A second type of example relates to entirely stabilized stimuli. Their colour and lightness fade until they are no longer seen and the area fills in with the colour and lightness of the surrounding region. A famous example of fading under steady fixation is [[Troxler's fading]]. When steadily fixating on the central dot for many seconds, the peripheral annulus will fade and will be replaced by the colour or texture of the background. Since the adapted region is actively filled-in with background colour or texture, the phenomenon cannot be fully explained by local processes such as adaptation.

There is general agreement that edges play a central role in determining the apparent colour and [[lightness]] of surfaces through similar filling-in mechanisms. However, the way in which their influence is performed is still unclear. Two different theories have been put forward to explain the filling-in completion phenomenon.

One theory, addressed as the "isomorphic filling-in theory" according to the definition of Von der Heydt, Friedman ''et al.'' (2003), postulates that perception is based on an image representation held in a two dimensional array of neurons, typically arranged retinotopically, in which colour signals spread in all directions except across borders formed by contour activity. The process is thought to be analogous to physical diffusion, with contours acting as diffusion barriers for the colour and [[brightness]] signals. An alternative hypothesis is that image information is transformed at the cortical level into an oriented feature representation. Form and colour would be derived at a subsequent stage, not as the result of an isomorphic filling-in process, but as an attribute of an object or proto-object. This theory is called the symbolic filling-in theory.

According to the isomorphic filling-in theory, colour is represented by the activity of cells whose receptive fields point at the surface, but it is assumed that these cells receive additional activation through horizontal connections that keeps their activity level high despite mechanisms of lateral inhibition tending to suppress surface activity and despite the transient nature of the afferent signals. The lateral activation comes from receptive fields at contrast borders. These signals are strong because receptive fields are exposed to contrast, and reliable because the border produces continuous light modulation even during fixation, due to small residual eye movements. In the alternative symbolic hypothesis, there is no spreading of activity, but all the information would be carried by the relevant features, that would be tagged with information on contrast polarity, colour and lightness of the surfaces they enclose. Despite the many attempts to verify the two different models by psychophysical and physiological experiments, the mechanisms of colour and lightness filling-in are still debated.

==Isomorphic filling-in==
There are at least three different kinds of experiments whose results support the idea that a real spreading of neural activity in early visual areas is the basis for filling-in of visual information.

===Recordings from cells of the blind spot representation in monkey striate cortex===
Komatsu and colleagues (Komatsu et al., 2000) recorded activity of cells of the blind spot representation in monkey [[striate cortex]] (area V1) and found some cells, in layers 4–6, that responded to large stimuli covering the blind spot (the condition under which filling-in is perceived), but not to small stimuli near the blind spot. A neuronal circuitry seems to exist that elaborates and transmits colour and brightness information through the blind region.

Though intriguing, these results cannot be easily generalized to similar phenomena, such as the filling-in of [[illusory contours]] or the filling-in through artificial scotomata or adapted edges (such as in the Troxler's effect). All these phenomena are indeed similar, and probably rely on similar neural circuitries but they are not identical. For instance, an obvious difference between filling-in across the blind spot and filling-in of occluded edges is that filling-in across the blind spot is modal (i.e. you literally see the filled-in section), while filling-in across occluders is [[amodal perception|amodal]]. Filling-in across the blind spot was found to be different also from filling-in across cortical scotomata in two patients examined by Ramachandran (Ramachandran 1992; Ramachandran, Gregory ''et al.'' 1993). In these subjects, some features filled in the scotoma faster than others, and in some circumstances filling-in took some seconds before it was completed (while filling-in across the blind spot is immediate). Together these data suggested that mechanisms for the filling-in of colours, motion and texture can be dissociated and may correspond to processes in higher-order areas that are specialized for these attributes.

===Delayed masking psychophysical experiments===
Striking evidence implying a spreading of neural activity like the one postulated by isomorphic filling-in theory is given by experiments of backward masking after brief presentations of uniform surfaces or textures. The working hypothesis of these experiments is that if a response initially biased toward the boundaries fills-in to represent the interiors of uniform surfaces, it may be possible to interfere with the filling-in process and leave the percept at an incomplete stage.

Paradiso and Nakayama (1991) performed an experiment to verify this hypothesis. They presented a large disk of uniform brightness on a black background. The stimulus was briefly flashed and, after a variable stimulus offset asynchrony, a masking stimulus was presented. The mask consisted of a circle on a black background with the masking contours positioned within the boundaries of the large uniform disk. This experiment is grounded on the assumption that filling-in consists of a spreading of neural activity from the boundaries of luminance and through the surfaces, that is stopped when another luminance-contrast border is reached (this is proposed by many models of brightness perception, see for example Walls 1954, Gerrits and Vendrik 1970, Cohen and Grossberg 1984), and that the process takes some time to be completed.

Subjects were asked to match the brightness at the centre of the disk with a palette of grey scales. When the delay between target and mask presentation was long enough, the mask had no effect on the apparent brightness of the stimulus, but for stimulus offset asynchronies of 50–100&amp;nbsp;ms, the surface of the disk inside the masking annulus appeared unfilled. Moreover, the minimum target-mask delay at which the masking was effective increased with target size, suggesting that there would be a spreading phenomenon and that the farther the features delimiting a region, the more time is necessary for the filling-in to be completed. These results are supported also by further experiments on temporal limits of brightness induction in simultaneous contrast (De Valois, Webster ''et al.'' 1986; Rossi and Paradiso 1996; Rossi, Rittenhouse ''et al.'' 1996), as well as by a similar experiment performed by Motoyoshi (1999) on filling-in of texture.

===Recordings from striate cortex of cat===
An isomorphic filling-in theory calls for the existence of surface responsive neurons in early retinotopic visual areas. The activity of such neurons would be raised by elements capable of responding to the luminance of the surface also in the absence of edges; and would be strongly modulated by spreading of activity from the luminance borders enclosing the surface.

Electro-physiological recordings in [[retinal ganglion cell]]s, [[LGN]] and [[primary visual cortex]] showed that neurons of these areas responded to luminance modulation within the receptive field even in the absence of contrast borders.

In a second condition, a uniform grey patch was placed on the [[receptive field]] (extending 3–5 degrees beyond the receptive field boundary on either side), and two flanking patches modulated sinusoidally in time from dark to light. With such stimuli, the brightness of the central patch appears to modulate, despite the absence of luminance change. In this condition, cat retinal ganglion cells and lateral geniculate nucleus cells, having their receptive fields centred in the uniform grey patch, did not respond; on the other hand, primary visual cortex neurons were modulated by luminance changes far outside their receptive fields. Together, these results suggest that neurons in the retina and LGN are responsive to luminance modulation, but their response does not correlate with perceived brightness. On the other hand, striate neurons responded to stimulus conditions producing changes in brightness in the area corresponding to the receptive field.

The behaviour of primary visual cortex neurons seems to be in agreement with the one hypothesized by an isomorphic filling-in theory in that they both respond to luminance of the surfaces also in the absence of borders, and their activity is modulated by that of edges far outside the receptive field. Moreover, when the temporal frequency of luminance modulation in the surrounding patches exceeded a threshold value, the induced response disappeared, suggesting that it was the result of a spreading of activity, taking a finite time to happen, likely explainable in the context of isomorphic filling-in.

==Symbolic filling-in==
"Perceptual filling-in", in its simplest definition, is simply the filling-in of information that is not directly given to the sensory input. The missing information is inferred or extrapolated from visual data acquired in a different part of the visual field. Examples of filling-in phenomena include lightness assignment to surfaces from information of contrast across the edges and completion of features and textures across the blind spot, based on the features and textures that are detected in the visible part of the image. In this definition, it is clear that a filling-in process involves a rearrangement of visual information, in which activity in one region of the visual field (i.e. edges) is assigned to other regions (surfaces). In any event, the total amount of information available is not increased, being determined by the retinal input, and any rearrangement of information is useful only if it brings the information contained in the image into a form that is more easily analyzed by our brain.

Dennett and Kinsbourne (Dennett 1992; Dennett and Kinsbourne 1992) opposed to the idea that an active filling-in process would take place in our brain on philosophical grounds. They argued that such an idea would be the result of the false belief that in our brain there is a spectator, a sort of [[homunculus]] similar to ourselves, needing a filled-in image representation. From a scientific viewpoint, Dennett's homunculus may correspond to higher-order scene representation or decision-making mechanisms. The question is whether or not such mechanisms need a filled in, gap free representation of the image to function optimally (Ramachandran 2003).

The symbolic filling-in theory postulates that such a "homunculus" need not exist, and that image information is transformed at the cortical level into an oriented feature representation. Surface form and colour are not coded at this stage, but would be derived only at a symbolic level of representation, as attributes of objects or proto-objects.

==Electrophysiology recordings from monkey primary visual cortex==
When experiencing perceptual filling-in, the colour of an adapted surface is gradually replaced by the colour or texture of outside the surface. Friedman ''et al.'' (Friedman 1998; Friedman, Zhou ''et al.'' 1999) performed an experiment aimed at determining if surface activity of cells in monkey primary visual cortex changed in accordance with perceptual change or simply followed the modulation of the colour presented to the retina. Stimuli consisted of a disk-ring configuration similar to that illustrating the Troxler effect, but where the inner and outer part of the annulus have two physically different colours. After a few seconds of (peripheral) fixation, the disk tends to disappear, whereas the outer contour of the ring is perceived much longer, and the area of the disk is filled-in with the colour of the ring (Krauskopf 1967). These stimuli where intermixed with control stimuli, in which the physical colour of the disk was gradually changed to that of the ring. The animals were instructed to signal a colour change, and their responses to control stimuli and to test stimuli were compared in order to determine if monkeys perceive colour filling-in under steady fixation like humans.

The authors recorded the activity of surface- and edge-cells (cells whose receptive fields pointed either to the filled-in surface or to the border between the disk and the ring) in the visual cortices V1 and V2 while the monkey was performing the filling-in task. The activity of surface-cells correlated with the physical stimulus change in both areas V1 and V2, but not with the perceived colour change induced by filling-in. The activity of edge-cells followed the stimulus contrast when the disk colour changed physically; when the colours were constant, the edge signals also decayed, but more slowly. Together, the data was incompatible with the isomorphic filling-in theory, which assumes that colour signals spread from the borders into uniform regions.

==fMRI experiments in human subjects==
The neuronal activity in different brain areas can be recorded in humans through non-invasive techniques, like [[fMRI]] (functional magnetic resonance imaging). Perna ''et al.'' (2005) used fMRI to investigate the neuronal mechanisms responsible for the [[Craik–O'Brien–Cornsweet illusion]]. These authors recorded the activity in different brain areas when observers were presented with a [[Tom N. Cornsweet|Cornsweet]] visual stimulus, and compared the activities with those elicited by a similar image, which however did not elicit any brightness filling-in.

Contrary to the predictions of isomorphic filling-in, these authors found an identical response to the stimulus that induced filling-in and to the control stimulus in early visual cortex.

Recently, Cornelissen ''et al.'' (2006) performed a similar experiment involving the simultaneous contrast illusion. These authors presented observers in an fMRI scan with simultaneous contrast stimuli composed of a central circle of uniform luminance and a peripheral region whose luminance was modulated in time (and also tested other conditions where the modulated and the constant regions were inverted). The brain activity was recorded in primary visual cortex in a retinotopic position corresponding to the perceptually filled-in region. Also in this condition, no activity was found at this level in response to the filled-in signal.

'''Frank Seishi Emi''' (September 23, 1916 – December 1, 2010) was a [[Japanese American]] civil rights activist. He was a leading figure of the [[Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee]], an [[ad hoc]] group who protested the drafting of Japanese Americans [[Japanese American internment|incarcerated]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"&gt;Elaine Woo. [http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-frank-emi-20101209,0,5659100.story "Frank S. Emi dies at 94; Japanese American fought effort to draft WWII internees"] ''Los Angeles Times'', Dec 09, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Emi argued it was unconstitutional to conscript men who had been stripped of their civil rights into military service and advised [[Nisei]] who received draft orders to demand they be released from camp before reporting for duty. He was convicted of conspiring to violate the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|Selective Service Act]] and served eighteen months of a four-year sentence in federal prison. For many years, Emi and his fellow draft resisters were condemned as troublemakers by the [[Japanese American Citizens League]] and the larger Japanese American community,&lt;ref name="Densho-HMFPC"&gt;Eric L. Muller. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Heart_Mountain_Fair_Play_Committee/ "Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee"] ''Densho Encyclopedia'' (accessed Feb 19, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; but his legacy has more recently come to be seen as an important example of civil disobedience.&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"&gt;Esther Newman. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Frank%20Emi/ "Frank Emi"] ''Densho Encyclopedia'' (accessed Feb 19, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Frank Seishi Emi was born in [[Los Angeles]] on September 23, 1916. When he was four years old, his family moved to the [[San Fernando Valley]], where they farmed and eventually opened a produce market. He attended [[San Fernando High School]] for two years, until his family moved again to open a grocery store in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]. He graduated from [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School]] and entered the [[Los Angeles City College]]'s pharmacy program.&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"/&gt; After his father was seriously injured in a car accident, Emi left school to run the family's produce market in downtown Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"/&gt;

By 1941, Emi was running a successful business. He had just invested $25,000 to expand the market when [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] was attacked on December 7, 1941.&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"/&gt; He was not immediately worried, recalling later, "we didn't have an inkling that we ourselves were going to be bothered because we Nisei had been born here in this country and we were citizens."&lt;ref&gt;Frank Emi interview, Japanese American World War II Evacuation Oral History Project, Calisphere, University of California.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after [[Executive Order 9066]] put into motion the removal of Japanese Americans from the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], he was forced to sell the family business for $1,500,&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"/&gt; about six cents for each dollar of the produce market's real value.&lt;ref&gt;Martha Nakagawa.

==Draft resistance==
In early 1943, the [[War Relocation Authority]] began to distribute a "Leave Clearance Form," better known as the [[Japanese American internment#Loyalty questions and segregation|loyalty questionnaire]] because of two controversial questions that attempted to discern the loyalty of imprisoned Japanese Americans. Question 27 asked whether men would be willing to serve in the armed forces, while Question 28 asked inmates to forswear their allegiance to the [[Emperor of Japan]]. While many gave unqualified affirmative responses, many, like Emi, were confused and offended by the questions' implications. Emi's response to both was, "Under the present conditions and circumstances, I am unable to answer this question,"&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"/&gt; and he encouraged others to do the same, posting fliers with suggested answers around Heart Mountain.&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTobit"&gt;Dennis Hevesi. [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/19/us/19emi.html "Frank Emi, Defiant World War II Internee, Dies at 94,"] ''The New York Times'', 18 Dec 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1943, with new soldiers to replace those who had died in combat in high demand, the previous restrictions against Nisei men (listed as enemy aliens ineligible for service after Pearl Harbor) were set aside in order to create a segregated unit of Japanese American volunteers.&lt;ref name="Odo-442"&gt;Franklin Odo. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/442nd_Regimental_Combat_Team/ "442nd Regimental Combat Team,"] ''Densho Encyclopedia'' (accessed 18 Mar 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Given the nickname "[[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|Go For Broke]]" for its soldier's willingness to put their lives at risk in battle, the unit suffered an extremely high casualty rate and soon required fresh troops. A 1944 amendment to the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|Selective Service Act]] reinstated the draft for men in camp when only 1,181 inmates volunteered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulelake.org Tule Lake Committee: "History"] (accessed 18 Mar 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

Emi and five other Heart Mountain inmates joined Kiyoshi Okamoto, a vocal protestor against the loyalty questionnaire and the incarceration who called himself a "Fair Play Committee of One," to form the Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee.&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Densho-HMFPC"/&gt; The Committee encouraged other inmates to refuse military service until their full citizenship rights were restored, and held public meetings to discuss the unconstitutionality of their confinement. As more young men joined the Committee and refused to comply with draft orders, the federal government took action.

On March 25, 1944, twelve Heart Mountain inmates who had not reported for their draft physicals were arrested by [[U.S. Marshals]].&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"/&gt; Undeterred, more young men followed their example, and Emi and two other Committee members who had not received drafted notices (Emi was married with children) attempted to walk out of camp to highlight their status as prisoners.&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"/&gt; Later that year, sixty-three Heart Mountain resisters were arrested after failing to show up for their induction and were subsequently tried in federal court and convicted of felony [[draft evasion]]&lt;ref name="Densho-Emi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C&amp;C-Resistance"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/itvs/conscience/resistance/index.html ''Conscience and the Constitution'': "Resistance."] PBS.

Lyon. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Japanese_American_Citizens_League/ "Japanese American Citizens League,"] ''Densho Encyclopedia'' (accessed Feb 19, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; A total of 300 draft resisters from Heart Mountain and seven other WRA camps were arrested and stood trial for these charges; almost all served at least two years in federal prison.&lt;ref name="Muller-DR"&gt;Eric L. Muller. [http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Draft%20resistance/ "Draft resistance,"] ''Densho Encyclopedia'' (accessed 18 Mar 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The seven leaders of the Fair Play Committee, who were not eligible for the draft because of their age or domestic status, were convicted of conspiracy to violate the Selective Service Act and sentenced to four years in federal prison.&lt;ref name="Muller-DR"/&gt; Emi served 18 months at the [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|U.S. Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas]], before his and the other leader's sentences were overturned by a federal appeals court in December 1945.&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Densho-HMFPC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="C&amp;C-Resistance"/&gt;

==Post-war legacy==
Outside prison, Emi and his fellow draft resisters found that most of their peers viewed them with disdain and considered their wartime resistance a sign of disloyalty and cowardice, a stain on the Japanese American community in general and the legacy of the 442nd Regimental Combat Team in particular.&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muller-DR"/&gt; This stigma would not begin to change until the late 1970s and early 1980s, when a younger generation of [[Sansei]] began to push for [[Japanese American internment#Reparations and redress|redress]] and a reexamination of their parents' and grandparents' wartime experiences. In 2000, the Japanese American Citizens League reversed their stance and offered Emi and the other resisters a formal apology.&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lyon-JACL"/&gt;

After the war, Frank Emi worked as a gardener and a grocery clerk before beginning a career with the postal service. After retiring from the post office, he worked at a state unemployment office until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/itvs/conscience/the_story/characters/emi_frank.html ''Conscience and the Constitution'': "Frank Emi,"] PBS (accessed 18 Mar 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; Promoted to 8th-degree [[black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in 2008, he was also the head instructor of the Hollywood Judo Dojo and was credited for producing several national [[judo]] athletes.&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"/&gt;

Emi died on December 1, 2010, in [[West Covina, California]], the last surviving member of the Heart Mountain Fair Play Committee.&lt;ref name="LAT-Emi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTobit"/&gt;

'''German idealism''' (also known as '''post-Kantian idealism''', '''post-Kantian philosophy''', or simply '''post-Kantianism''')&lt;ref&gt;Terry Pinkard, ''German Philosophy 1760-1860: The Legacy of Idealism'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[philosophical movement]] that emerged in [[Germany]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It began as a reaction to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]].'' German idealism was closely linked with both [[Romanticism]] and the revolutionary politics of [[the Enlightenment]].

The most notable thinkers in the movement were [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], and the proponents of [[Jena Romanticism]] ([[Friedrich Hölderlin]], [[Novalis]], and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser]], ''German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism, 1781-1801'', Harvard University Press, 2002, p. viii: "the young romantics—Hölderlin, Schlegel, Novalis—[were] crucial figures in the development of German idealism."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]], [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]], [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]], [[Salomon Maimon]] and [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] also made major contributions.

== Meaning of idealism ==
{{main article|Idealism}}

The word "[[idealism]]" has multiple meanings. The philosophical meaning of idealism is that the properties we discover in objects depend on the way that those objects appear to us, as perceiving subjects. These properties only belong to the perceived appearance of the objects, and not something they possess "in themselves". The notion of a "[[thing in itself]]" should be understood here as an option of a set of functions for an operating mind, such that we consider something that appears without respect to the ''specific manner'' in which it appears. The term "idea-ism" is closer to this intended meaning than the common notion of idealism. The question of what properties a thing might have [[noumena|"independently of the mind"]] is thus unknowable and a moot point, within the idealist tradition.

==History==
{{main|Timeline of German idealism}}
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s work purported to bridge the two dominant philosophical schools in the 18th century: 1) [[rationalism]], which held that knowledge could be attained by reason alone ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' (prior to experience), and 2) [[empiricism]], which held that knowledge could be arrived at only through the senses ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' (after experience), as expressed by philosopher [[David Hume]], whom Kant sought to rebut&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding German Idealism|last=Dudley|first=Will|publisher=|year=|isbn=9781844653935|location=|pages=3-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Kant's solution was to propose that while we can know, via sensory experience, particular facts about the world (which he termed [[phenomena]]), we cannot know the ''form'' they must take prior to any experience (which he called [[noumena]]). That is, we cannot know ''what'' objects we will encounter, but we can know ''how'' we will encounter them. Kant called his mode of philosophising "[[critical philosophy]]", in that it was supposedly less concerned with setting out positive doctrine than with critiquing the limits to the theories we ''can'' set out.&lt;ref&gt;The German Idealists did not take "&amp;hellip;Kant’s advice that we should not engage with concepts of which we can have no experience (instances of this are Fichte’s Absolute I, Schelling’s Absolute, and Hegel’s Geist)&amp;hellip;." ("Fichte: Kantian or Spinozian? Three Interpretations of the Absolute I," Alexandre Guilherme, ''South African Journal of Philosophy'', 2010, vol. 29 number 1, p. 14)&lt;/ref&gt; The conclusion he presented, as above, he called "[[transcendental idealism]]". This distinguished it from [[idealism#Classical idealism|classical idealism]] and [[idealism#Subjective idealism|subjective idealism]] such as [[George Berkeley]]'s, which held that external objects have actual being or real existence only when they are perceived by an observer. Kant said that there are things-in-themselves, noumena, that is, things that exist other than being merely sensations and ideas in our minds. Kant held in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that the world of appearances (phenomena) is empirically real and transcendentally ideal.  The mind plays a central role in influencing the way that the world is experienced: we perceive phenomena through [[time]], [[space]] and the [[categories of the understanding]]. It is this notion that was taken to heart by Kant's philosophical successors.

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] considered himself to be a [[Transcendental idealism|transcendental idealist]]. In his major work ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' he discusses his indebtedness to Kant, and the work includes Schopenhauer's extensive analysis of the ''Critique''. The [[Young Hegelians]], a number of philosophers who developed Hegel's work in various directions, were in some cases idealists. On the other hand, [[Karl Marx]], who was numbered among them, had professed himself to be a [[materialist]], in opposition to idealism. Another member of the Young Hegelians, [[Ludwig Feuerbach]], advocated for materialism, and his thought was influential in the development of [[historical materialism]],&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Churchich, ''Marxism and Alienation'', Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, p. 57: "Although Marx has rejected Feuerbach's abstract materialism," Lenin says that Feuerbach's views "are consistently materialist," implying that Feuerbach's conception of causality is entirely in line with dialectical materialism."&lt;/ref&gt; where he is often recognized as a bridge between Hegel and Marx.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Van A., "Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach", ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Winter 2008 Edition), [[Edward N. Zalta]] (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2008/entries/ludwig-feuerbach/.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kant's transcendental idealism consisted of taking a point of view outside and above oneself (transcendentally) and understanding that the mind directly knows only phenomena or ideas. Whatever exists other than mental phenomena, or ideas that appear to the mind, is a thing-in-itself and cannot be directly and immediately known.

Kant had criticized pure reason. He wanted to restrict reasoning, judging, and speaking only to objects of possible experience. The main German Idealists, who had been theology students,&lt;ref&gt;"[Fichte], like both Schelling and Hegel, the other leading Idealist philosophers,...began as a student of theology…." Green, Garrett. "Introduction," ''Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation'', by J.G. Fichte, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978, p. i, Note.&lt;/ref&gt; reacted against Kant’s stringent limits.&lt;ref&gt;"Fichte (and the other absolute Idealists) have disregarded Kant’s advice that we should not engage with concepts of which we can have no experience (instances of this are Fichte’s Absolute I, Schelling’s Absolute, and Hegel’s Geist)&amp;hellip;." "Fichte: Kantian or Spinozian? Three Interpretations of the Absolute I" by Alexandre Guilherme, [[Durham University]], South  African  Journal of  Philosophy, (2010), Volume 29, Number 1, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; "It was Kant’s criticism of all attempts to prove the existence of God which led to the romantic reaction of Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel."&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]] (1945), ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'', Volume 2, Chapter 11, II, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theorists==

===Jacobi===
{{see also|Leap of faith}}
In 1787, [[Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi]] addressed, in his book ''On Faith, or Idealism and Realism'', Kant's concept of "thing-in-itself". Jacobi agreed that the objective thing-in-itself cannot be directly known. However, he stated, it must be taken on belief. A subject must believe that there is a real object in the external world that is related to the representation or mental idea that is directly known. This belief is a result of revelation or immediately known, but logically unproved, truth. The real existence of a thing-in-itself is revealed or disclosed to the observing subject. In this way, the subject directly knows the ideal, subjective representations that appear in the mind, and strongly believes in the real, objective thing-in-itself that exists outside the mind. By presenting the external world as an object of belief, Jacobi legitimized belief. "&amp;hellip;[B]y reducing the external world to a matter of faith, he wanted merely to open a little door for faith in general..."&lt;ref name="Schopenhauer"&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. I&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reinhold===
[[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]] published two volumes of ''Letters Concerning the Kantian Philosophy'' in 1790 and 1792. They provided a clear explication of Kant's thoughts, which were previously inaccessible due to Kant's use of complex or technical language.

Reinhold also tried to prove Kant's assertion that humans and other animals can know only images that appear in their minds, never "things-in-themselves" (things that are not mere appearances in a mind). In order to establish his proof, Reinhold stated an [[axiom]] that could not possibly be doubted. From this axiom, all knowledge of [[consciousness]] could be deduced. His axiom was: "Representation is distinguished in consciousness by the subject from the subject and object, and is referred to both."

He thereby started, not from definitions, but, from a principle that referred to mental images or representations in a conscious mind. In this way, he analyzed knowledge into (1) the knowing subject, or observer, (2) the known object, and (3) the image or representation in the subject's mind. In order to understand transcendental idealism, it is necessary to reflect deeply enough to distinguish experience as consisting of these three components: subject, subject's representation of object, and object.

===Schulze===
Kant noted that a mental idea or representation must be a representation of something, and deduced that it is of something external to the mind. He gave the name of ''Ding an sich'', or [[thing-in-itself]] to that which is represented. However, [[Gottlob Ernst Schulze]] wrote, anonymously, that the law of cause and effect only applies to the phenomena within the mind, not between those phenomena and any things-in-themselves outside the mind. That is, a thing-in-itself cannot be the cause of an idea or image of a thing in the mind. In this way, he discredited Kant's philosophy by using Kant's own reasoning to disprove the existence of a thing-in-itself.

===Fichte===
{{Main article|Johann Gottlieb Fichte}}
After Schulze had seriously criticized the notion of a thing-in-itself, Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762–1814) produced a philosophy similar to Kant's, but without a thing-in-itself. Fichte asserted that our representations, ideas, or mental images are merely the productions of our ego, or knowing subject. For him, there is no external thing-in-itself that produces the ideas. On the contrary, the knowing subject, or ego, is the cause of the external thing, object, or non-ego.

Fichte's style was a challenging exaggeration of Kant's already difficult writing. Also, Fichte claimed that his truths were apparent to intellectual, non-perceptual, intuition. That is, the truth can be immediately seen by the use of reason.

Schopenhauer, a student of Fichte's, wrote of him:
{{Quote|...Fichte who, because the thing-in-itself had just been discredited, at once prepared a system without any thing-in-itself. Consequently, he rejected the assumption of anything that was not through and through merely our [[representation (psychology)|representation]], and therefore let the knowing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] be all in all or at any rate produce everything from its own resources. For this purpose, he at once did away with the essential and most meritorious part of the Kantian doctrine, the distinction between ''a priori'' and ''a posteriori'' and thus that between the phenomenon and the thing-in-itself. For he declared everything to be ''a priori'', naturally without any proofs for such a monstrous assertion; instead of these, he gave sophisms and even crazy sham demonstrations whose absurdity was concealed under the mask of profundity and of the incomprehensibility ostensibly arising therefrom. Moreover, he appealed boldly and openly to intellectual intuition, that is, really to [[wikt:inspiration|inspiration]].|Schopenhauer|''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, §13}}

===Schelling===
{{Main article|Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling}}
Schelling attempted to rescue theism from Kant’s refutation of the proofs for God’s existence. "Now the philosophy of Schelling from the first admitted the possibility of a knowledge of God, although it likewise started from the philosophy of Kant, which denies such knowledge." &lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], ''[[Lectures on the History of Philosophy]]'', Section Three: "Recent German Philosophy," D. "Schelling"&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the experience of objects, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling (1775–1854) claimed that the Fichte's "I" needs the Not-I, because there is no subject without object, and vice versa. So the ideas or mental images in the mind are identical to the extended objects which are external to the mind. According to Schelling's "absolute identity" or "indifferentism", there is no difference between the subjective and the objective, that is, the ideal and the real.

In 1851, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] criticized Schelling's absolute identity of the subjective and the objective, or of the ideal and the real. "...[E]verything that rare minds like Locke and Kant had separated after an incredible amount of reflection and judgment, was to be again poured into the pap of that absolute identity. For the teaching of those two thinkers [Locke and Kant] may be very appropriately described as the doctrine of the ''absolute diversity of the ideal and the real, or of the subjective and the objective''."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. I, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy," § 13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schleiermacher===
[[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] was a theologian who asserted that the ideal and the real are united in God. He understood the ideal as the subjective mental activities of thought, intellect, and reason. The real was, for him, the objective area of nature and physical being. Schleiermacher declared that the unity of the ideal and the real is manifested in God. The two divisions do not have a productive or causal effect on each other. Rather, they are both equally existent in the absolute transcendental entity which is God.

===Maimon===
[[Salomon Maimon]] influenced German idealism by criticizing Kant's dichotomies, claiming that Kant did not explain how opposites such as sensibility and understanding could relate to each other.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Maimon claimed that the dualism between these faculties was analogous to the old Cartesian dualism between the mind and body, and that all the problems of the older dualism should hold ''mutatis mutandis'' for the new one. Such was the heterogeneity between understanding and sensibility, Maimon further argued, that there could be no criterion to determine how the  concepts of the understanding apply to the intuitions of sensibility.  By thus pointing out these problematic dualisms, Maimon and the neo-Humean critics left a foothold open for skepticism within the framework of Kant’s own philosophy.  For now the question arose how two such heterogeneous realms as the intellectual and the sensible could be known to correspond with one another. The problem was no longer how we know that our representations correspond with things in themselves but how we know that ''a priori'' concepts apply to ''a posteriori'' intuitions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to German Idealism'', Edited by [[Karl Ameriks]] (2000), Chapter I, [[Frederick C. Beiser]], "The Enlightenment and idealism," , Section V, "The meta-critical campaign," page 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schelling and Hegel, however, tried to solve this problem by claiming that opposites are absolutely identical.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Maimon's concept of an infinite mind as the basis of all opposites was similar to the German idealistic attempt to rescue theism by positing an Absolute Mind or Spirit.

Maimon’s metaphysical concept of "infinite mind" was similar to Fichte’s "Ich" and Hegel’s "Geist." Maimon ignored the results of Kant’s criticism and returned to pre-Kantian transcendent speculation. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;What characterizes Fichte’s, Schelling’s, and Hegel’s speculative idealism in contrast to Kant's [[critical idealism]] is the recurrence of metaphysical ideas from the rationalist tradition. What Kant forbade as a violation of the limits of human knowledge, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel saw as a necessity of the critical philosophy itself. Now Maimon was the crucial figure behind this transformation. By reviving metaphysical ideas from within the problematic of the critical philosophy, he gave them a new legitimacy and opened up the possibility for a critical resurrection of metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser]], ''The Fate of Reason: German Philosophy from Kant to Fichte'', Chapter 10, "Maimon’s Critical Philosophy," page 287, Harvard University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Maimon is said to have Influenced Hegel’s writing on Spinoza. "[T]here seems to be a striking similarity between Maimon’s discussion of Spinoza in the ''Lebensgeschichte'' (Maimon's autobiography) and Hegel’s discussion of Spinoza in the ''Lectures in the History of Philosophy''."&lt;ref&gt;"Salomon Maimon and the Rise of Spinozism in German Idealism," Yitzhaky Melamed, ''Journal of the History of Philosophy'', vol. 42, no. 1 (2004) 67–96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hegel===
{{Main article|Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Absolute idealism}}
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770–1831) was a [[German people|German]] [[philosopher]] born in [[Stuttgart]], [[Württemberg]], in present-day southwest Germany. Hegel responded to Kant's philosophy by suggesting that the unsolvable contradictions given by Kant in his [[Critique of Pure Reason#The Antinomy of Pure Reason|Antinomies of Pure Reason]] applied not only to the four areas Kant gave (world as infinite vs. finite, material as composite vs. atomic, etc.) but in all objects and conceptions, notions and ideas. To know this he suggested makes a "vital part in a philosophical theory."&lt;ref&gt;Hegel, "The Science of Logic" in ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences'' (1817-1830)&lt;/ref&gt; Given that abstract thought is thus limited, he went on to consider how historical formations give rise to different philosophies and ways of thinking. For Hegel, thought fails when it is only given as an abstraction and is not united with considerations of historical reality. In his major work ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' he went on to trace the formation of [[self-consciousness]] through history and the importance of other people in the awakening of self-consciousness (see [[master-slave dialectic]]). Thus Hegel introduces two important ideas to metaphysics and philosophy: the integral importance of history and of the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] person. His work is theological in that it replaces the traditional concept of [[God]] with that of an [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;"[T]he task that touches the interest of philosophy most nearly at the present moment: to put God back at the peak of philosophy, absolutely prior to all else as the one and only ground of everything." (Hegel, "How the Ordinary Human Understanding Takes Philosophy as displayed in the works of Mr. Krug," ''Kritisches Journal der Philosophie'', I, no. 1, 1802, pages 91-115)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Hegelian philosophy is the last grand attempt to restore a lost and defunct Christianity through philosophy&amp;hellip;. [Die Hegelsche Philosophie ist der letzte großartige Versuch, das verlorene, untergegangene Christentum durch die Philosophie wieder herzustellen]" ([[Ludwig Feuerbach]], ''Principles of the Philosophy of the Future'' [''Grundsätze der Philosophie der Zukunft'' (1843)], § 21)&lt;/ref&gt; Spinoza, who changed the anthropomorphic concept of God into that of an abstract, vague, underlying Substance, was praised by Hegel whose concept of Absolute fulfilled a similar function. Hegel claimed that "You are either a Spinozist or not a philosopher at all".&lt;ref&gt;''Hegel's Lectures on the History of Philosophy'', Section 2, Chapter 1, A2. Spinoza. General Criticism of Spinoza's Philosophy, Second Point of View (cf. paragraph beginning with "The second point to be considered&amp;hellip;")&lt;/ref&gt; Reality results from God’s thinking, according to Hegel. Objects  that appear to a spectator originate in God’s mind.&lt;ref&gt;"&amp;hellip;the deepest fact about the nature of reality is that it is a product of God’s thought.&amp;hellip; Hegel even goes so far as to claim that the fact that objects appear to human beings in a particular way, as phenomena, is a reflection of the essential nature of those objects and of their origin in a divine intelligence rather than in our own." (''The Cambridge Companion to German Idealism'', edited by [[Karl Ameriks]]: Chapter 2, "Absolute idealism and the rejection of Kantian dualism" by [[Paul Guyer]], Section I, "Hegel on the sources of Kantian dualism")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses==

===Neo-Kantianism===
{{main article|Neo-Kantianism}}
Neo-Kantianism refers broadly to a revived type of philosophy along the lines of that laid down by Immanuel Kant in the 18th century, or more specifically by Schopenhauer's criticism of the Kantian philosophy in his work ''The World as Will and Representation'' (1818), as well as by other post-Kantian philosophers such as Jakob Friedrich Fries and Johann Friedrich Herbart. It has some more specific reference in later German philosophy.

===Hegelianism===
{{main article|Hegelianism|Right Hegelians|Young Hegelians|Karl Marx}}
Hegel was hugely influential throughout the nineteenth century; by its end, according to [[Bertrand Russell]], "the leading academic philosophers, both in America and Britain, were largely Hegelian".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]], ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; His influence has continued in contemporary philosophy but mainly in [[Continental philosophy]].

===Schopenhauer===
{{Main article|Arthur Schopenhauer}}
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] contended that [[Spinoza]] had a great influence on post-Kantian German idealists.&lt;ref&gt;"Spinoza’s influence on German Idealism was remarkable. He was both a challenge and inspiration for the three major figures of this movement (footnote:  A very detailed examination of Spinoza’s influence on German Idealism is given in Jean-Marie Vaysse’s ''Totalité et Subjectivité: Spinoza dans l’Idéalisme Allemand''. ). Hegel, Schelling and Fichte all sought to define their own philosophical positions in relation to his." (Bela Egyed, "Spinoza, Schopenhauer and the Standpoint of Affirmation," ''PhaenEx 2'', no. 1 (spring/summer 2007): 110-131)&lt;/ref&gt; Schopenhauer wrote: "In consequence of Kant's criticism of all speculative [[theology]], almost all the philosophizers in [[Germany]] cast themselves back on to Spinoza, so that the whole series of unsuccessful attempts known by the name of post-Kantian philosophy is simply Spinozism tastelessly got up, veiled in all kinds of unintelligible [[language]], and otherwise twisted and distorted."&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Schopenhauer, Kant's original philosophy, with its refutation of all speculative [[theology]], had been transformed by the German Idealists. Through the use of his technical terms, such as "transcendental," "transcendent," "reason," "intelligibility," and "thing-in-itself" they attempted to speak of what exists beyond experience and, in this way, to revive the notions of God, [[free will]], and immortality of soul. Kant had effectively relegated these ineffable notions to faith and belief.&lt;ref&gt;"In order to have insight into the [[existence of God]], freedom, and immortality, speculative reason must use principles that are intended merely for objects of possible experience. If the principles are applied to God, freedom, and immortality, which cannot be objects of experience, the principles would always treat these three notions as though they were mere phenomena [appearances]. This would render the practicality of pure reason impossible. Therefore, I had to abandon knowledge in order to make room for faith." Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason'', B xxx.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British idealism===
{{main article|British idealism|Thomas Hill Green|F. H. Bradley|Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|J. M. E. McTaggart|Harold Joachim|John Henry Muirhead|Geoffrey Reginald Gilchrist Mure}}
In England, during the nineteenth century, philosopher [[Thomas Hill Green]] embraced German Idealism in order to salvage Christian [[monotheism]] as a basis for morality. His philosophy attempted to account for an eternal consciousness or [[mind]] that was similar to [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]'s concept of [[God]] and [[Georg Hegel|Hegel]]'s [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]. John Rodman, in the introduction to his book on Thomas Hill Green's political theory, wrote: "Green is best seen as an exponent of German idealism as an answer to the dilemma posed by the discrediting of Christianity&amp;hellip;."&lt;ref&gt;John Rodman, ''The Political Theory of T. H. Green'', New York: Appleton Century–Crofts, 1964, "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main article|Transcendentalism|St. Louis Hegelians}}
"German idealism was initially introduced to the broader community of American ''literati'' through a [[Vermont]] intellectual, James Marsh. Studying theology with [[Moses Stuart]] at [[Andover Newton Theological School|Andover Seminary]] in the early 1820s, Marsh sought a [[Christian]] [[theology]] that would 'keep alive the heart in the head.' "&lt;ref&gt;James Marsh, as quoted by James A. Good (2002) in volume 2 of his ''The early American reception of German idealism'', p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Some American theologians and churchmen found value in German Idealism's theological concept of the infinite Absolute Ideal or ''[[Geist]]'' [Spirit]. It provided a religious alternative to the traditional Christian concept of the [[Deity]].&lt;ref&gt;“The Absolute or World Spirit was easily identified with the God of Christianity….”, ([[Morton White]] (Ed.) ''[[The Mentor Philosophers]]: The Age of Analysis: twentieth century philosophers'', Houghton Mifflin, 1955, Chapter 1, “The Decline and Fall of the Absolute”)&lt;/ref&gt; "&amp;hellip;[P]ost&amp;ndash;Kantian idealism can certainly be viewed as a religious school of thought&amp;hellip;."&lt;ref&gt;James Allan Good, ''A search for unity in diversity'', in James Allan Good (editor), ''The Early American Reception of German Idealism'' (Volume 2 of 5), Bristol: Thoemmes Press 2002, {{ISBN|1-85506-992-X}}, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The Absolute Ideal ''Weltgeist'' [World Spirit] was invoked by American ministers as they "turned to German idealism in the hope of finding comfort against English positivism and empiricism."&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Schneider, ''History of American philosophy'' (2nd edition), New York: Columbia University Press, 1963, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt; German idealism was a substitute for religion after the Civil War when "Americans were drawn to German idealism because of a 'loss of faith in traditional cosmic explanations.' "&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Dowler, ''The New Idealism'', Ph.D. dissertation, University of Maryland, 1974, p. 13, as quoted in James Allan Good, ''A search for unity in diversity'', p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; "By the early 1870s, the infiltration of German idealism was so pronounced that [[Walt Whitman]] declared in his personal notes that 'Only Hegel is fit for America &amp;mdash; is large enough and free enough.' "&lt;ref&gt;Walt Whitman, ''The complete writings'', vol. 9, p. 170, as quoted in James A. Good (2005), ''A search for unity in diversity'', ch. 2, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ortega y Gasset===
According to [[José Ortega y Gasset]],&lt;ref&gt;José Ortega y Gasset, ''Phenomenology and Art'', New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1975, {{ISBN|0-393-08714-X}}, "Preface for Germans," p. 48 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; with Post-Kantian German Idealism, "&amp;hellip;never before has a lack of truthfulness played such a large and important role in philosophy." "They did whatever they felt like doing with concepts. As if by magic they changed anything into any other thing." According to Ortega y Gasset, "&amp;hellip;the basic force behind their work was not strictly and exclusively the desire for truth&amp;hellip;." Ortega y Gasset quoted [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]]'s ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, in which Schopenhauer wrote that Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel forgot "the fact that one can feel an authentic and bitter seriousness" for philosophy. Schopenhauer, in Ortega y Gasset's quote, hoped that philosophers like those three men could learn "true and fruitful seriousness, such that the problem of existence would capture the thinker and bestir his innermost being."

===George Santayana===
[[George Santayana]] had strongly-held opinions regarding this attempt to overcome the effects of Kant's transcendental idealism.{{Quote|German Idealism, when we study it as a product of its own age and country, is a most engaging phenomenon; it is full of [[afflatus]], sweep, and deep searchings of the heart; but it is essentially romantic and egoistical, and all in it that is not soliloquy is mere system-making and sophistry. Therefore when it is taught by unromantic people ''ex cathedra'', in stentorian tones, and represented as the rational foundation of science and religion, with neither of which it has any honest sympathy, it becomes positively odious &amp;ndash; one of the worst impostures and blights to which a youthful imagination could be subjected.|[[George Santayana]]|''Winds of Doctrine'', IV, i.}}

===G. E. Moore===
{{main article|Analytic philosophy}}
In the first sentence of his ''[http://www.ditext.com/moore/refute.html The Refutation of Idealism]'', [[G. E. Moore]] wrote: "Modern Idealism, if it asserts any general conclusion about the universe at all, asserts that it is spiritual," by which he means "that the whole universe possesses all the qualities the possession of which is held to make us so superior to things which seem to be inanimate." He does not directly confront this conclusion, and instead focuses on what he considers the distinctively Idealist premise that "esse is percipere" or that to be is to be perceived. He analyzes this idea and considers it to conflate ideas or be contradictory.

===Slavoj Žižek===
[[Slavoj Žižek]] sees German Idealism as the pinnacle of modern philosophy, and as a tradition that contemporary philosophy must recapture: "[T]here is a unique philosophical moment in which philosophy appears 'as such' and which serves as a key—as the only key—to reading the entire preceding and following tradition as philosophy... This moment is the moment of German Idealism..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Slavoj |last=Žižek |title=Less Than Nothing: Hegel and the Shadow of Dialectical Materialism |year=2012 |publisher=Verso |url=http://www.versobooks.com/books/1114-less-than-nothing |isbn=9781844678976}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–8}}

=== Hannah Arendt ===
[[Hannah Arendt]] stated that Immanuel Kant distinguished between ''Vernunft'' ("reason") and ''Verstand'' ("intellect"): these two categories are equivalents of "the urgent need of" reason, and the "mere quest and desire for knowledge". Differentiating between reason and intellect, or the need to reason and the quest for knowledge, as Kant has done, according to Arendt "coincides with a distinction between two altogether different mental activities, thinking and knowing, and two altogether different concerns, meaning, in the first category, and cognition, in the second".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The life of the mind. One / thinking.|last = Arendt|first = Hannah|publisher = Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year = 1978|isbn = |location = |pages = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas were also developed by Kantian philosopher, [[Wilhelm Windelband]], in his discussion of the approaches to knowledge named [[Nomothetic and idiographic|"nomothetic" and "idiographic"]].

Kant's insight to start differentiating between approaches to knowledge that attempt to understand meaning (derived from reason), on the one hand, and to derive laws (on which knowledge is based), on the other, started to make room for "speculative thought" (which in this case, is not seen as a negative aspect, but rather an indication that knowledge and the effort to derive laws to explain objective phenomena has been separated from ''thinking''). This new-found room for "speculative thought" (reason, or thinking) touched-off the rise of German idealism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The life of the mind. One / thinking.|last = Arendt|first = Hannah|publisher = Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year = 1978|isbn = |location = |pages = 15 to 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new-found "speculative thought", reason or thinking of German idealism "again became a field for a new brand of specialists committed to the notion that philosophy's 'subject proper' is 'the actual knowledge of what truly is'. Liberated by Kant from the old school of dogmatism and its sterile exercises, they erected not only new systems but a new 'science' - the original title of the greatest of their works, Hegel's ''Phenomenology of the mind'', was ''Science of the experience of consciousness'' - eagerly blurring Kant's distinction between reason's concern with the unknowable and the intellect's concern with cognition. Pursuing the Cartesian ideal of certainty as though Kant had never existed, they believed in all earnest that the results of their speculations possessed the same kind of validity as the results of cognitive processes".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16719">A '''giving circle''' is a form of participatory [[philanthropy]] where groups of individuals donate their own money or time to a pooled fund, decide together where to give these away to [[charitable organization|charity]] or [[community project]]s and, in doing so, seek to increase their awareness of and engagement in the issues covered by the charity or community project.&lt;ref name="Eikenberry, Angela and Bearman, Jessica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://media.npr.org/documents/2009/may/givingcircles.pdf |title= The Impact of Giving Together: a snapshot of a study on giving circles' influence on philanthropic &amp; civic behaviors, knowledge &amp; attitudes|author1=Eikenberry, Angela  |author2=Bearman, Jessica |publisher= [[Forum of Regional Associations of Grantmakers]]|date= May 2009|accessdate= May 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many circles, in addition to donating their money, also contribute their time and skills to support local causes.

== Structure and function ==

The current manifestation of giving circles is a relatively new trend, but it is built on traditions dating back hundreds of years to [[benefit society|mutual aid societies]] and other forms of giving for the community. In the [[United States]], giving circles were initially composed of women; they are now more diverse in race, age and gender, although women continue to make up the majority of members.&lt;ref name="Growing"&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.academia.edu/244842/Giving_Circles_Growing_Grassroots_Philanthropy | title=Giving Circles: Growing Grassroots Philanthropy | author=Eikenberry, Angela M | journal=[[Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly]] |date=September 2006  | volume=35 | issue=3 | pages=517–532 | doi=10.1177/0899764006287482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The structure of the circles can be informal or formal. On the informal side, circles may vote and choose an organization to support and each member writes an individual [[cheque|check]]. Formal circles may have their money housed at a local community foundation and have staff that support the work of the circle. Giving circles can range in size from a handful of members to several hundred.

Individual donors who join or form a giving circle typically seek to [[community building|build community]] within their circle through social events, in addition to the economic impacts of the groups.

In a 2007 study, the [[Forum of Regional Associations of Grantmakers]]' New Ventures in Philanthropy initiative identified approximately 400 giving circles in the United States, more than double the number from two years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1857011,00.html |title= Report: Giving Circles |author=Kadlec, Dan|work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=November 5, 2008|accessdate= June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A survey of 160 circles, published in 2008, found they had leveraged nearly $100 million, $13 million of this in 2006 alone. Nearly 12,000 people took part in the 160 giving circles surveyed. Nearly half of circles have male participants, and the popularity of giving circles is also growing among racial, ethnic and tribal communities as well as in the gay and lesbian community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.givingforum.org/s_forum/doc.asp?CID=22&amp;DID=9565 |title=Report: Giving Circles Are Here to Stay |publisher=[[Forum of Regional Associations of Grantmakers]] |year=2008 |accessdate=May 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219033229/http://givingforum.org/s_forum/doc.asp?CID=22&amp;DID=9565 |archivedate=February 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study conducted in 2005 by Angela M. Eikenberry, an associate professor at the [[University of Nebraska at Omaha]], found that giving circles generally bring both long-time and new philanthropists to organized philanthropy.&lt;ref name= "Growing"/&gt; For both groups, participation seems to increase levels of giving while bringing “new money” to the [[nonprofit sector]]; especially to small and locally based organizations. Members also seem to learn about and give to organizations and individuals, and in areas of interest, they most likely would not have given to otherwise. In addition, members are more thoughtful, focused and strategic in their personal giving because of educational experiences in the giving circle. These findings are based on 30 interviews with giving circle participants, staff, and philanthropic professionals working with giving circles, document analysis, and secondary data.

Research by Eikenberry and Jessica Bearman, published in 2009, and largely based on a survey of giving circle members compared to a control group, found that giving circles influence members to give more and to give more strategically. Their members give to a wide array of organizations and are highly engaged in the community. Giving circles increase members’ knowledge about philanthropy, nonprofits, and the community but have a mixed influence on members’ attitudes about philanthropy, nonprofit and government roles, and political/social abilities and values. Level of engagement, length of engagement, and size of the giving circle seem to matter most, when it comes to understanding giving circles’ effects on members.&lt;ref name="Eikenberry, Angela and Bearman, Jessica"/&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
The Kew Giving Circle in [[Kew]], south west [[London]], started meeting in January 1999 and is still active. It is the first recorded giving circle in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2000/apr/23/charitablegiving.observercashsection| title=Squaring the Charity Circle|author=Bibby, Andrew |work= [[The Observer]]|date= April 23, 2000| accessdate= January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its members contribute to a pooled [[Charities Aid Foundation]] account and meet to agree payments from the account to their selected charities.

The Funding Network is the largest known and first open giving circle in the UK.  It is a charity that runs ''[[Dragons' Den]]''-style events to bring together potential donors and charities to fund positive social change. It has raised over £5 million for over 700 projects across the globe.&lt;ref name=Impact&gt;{{cite web |title=The Funding Network 10th Anniversary Impact Report |url=http://www.thefundingnetwork.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/TFN_ImpactReport_.pdf |work=10th Impact Report |publisher=The Funding Network |date=July 2012 |accessdate=March 19, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621015114/http://www.thefundingnetwork.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/TFN_ImpactReport_.pdf |archivedate=June 21, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Guardian of the Threshold''' is a menacing figure that is described by a number of esoteric teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Madame Blavatsky, ''Isis Unveiled'', 1877&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, “Knowledge of the Higher Worlds”(1904-5),[http://www.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/] Online English edition (1947, New York)[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA010/English/AP1947/GA010_cover.html] and ''An Outline of Occult Science'' first German edition 1909. Online English edition (1972, New York), chapter 5 [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA013/English/AP1972/GA013_cover.html][http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA013/English/AP1972/GA013_c05-08.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dion Fortune, “The Mystical Qabalah”, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samael Aun Weor, "The Perfect Matrimony", 1950&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Guardian of the Threshold", often called "dweller on the threshold", indicates a spectral image which is supposed to manifest itself as soon as "the student of the spirit ascends upon the path into the higher worlds of knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Franz Hartmann, The Dweller of the Threshold, Reprinted from The Theosophist, Vol. XI 1889&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner,An Outline of Occult Science,Anthroposophic Press 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tommaso Palamidessi]], The Guardians of the Threshold, ed. Archeosofica, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian of the Threshold'' is also the title of the third play (of a tetralogy of ''Mystery Dramas'') written by [[Rudolf Steiner]] in 1912.

==According to theosophy==
The "Dweller of the Threshold" (or "Guardian of the Threshold") is a literary invention of the English mystic and novelist [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], found in his romance ''[[Zanoni]]'' (1842). Shortly after publication of the book, the term gained wide currency in theosophical circles. The Guardian of the Threshold is a spectral figure and is the abstract of the debit and credit book of the individual. "It is the combined evil influence that is the result of the wicked thoughts and acts of the age in which any one may live, and it assumes to each student a definite shape at each appearance, being always either of one sort or changing each time"&lt;ref&gt;Eusebio Urban, Path, December, 1888&lt;/ref&gt; "This Dweller of the Threshold meets us in many shapes. It is the Cerberus guarding the entrance to Hades; the Dragon which St. Michael (spiritual will-power) is going to kill; the Snake which tempted Eve, and whose head will be crushed by the heel of the woman; the Hobgoblin watching the place where the treasure is buried, etc. He is the king of evil, who will not permit that within his kingdom a child should grow up, which might surpass him in power; the Herod before whose wrath the divine child Christ has to flee into a foreign country, and is not permitted to return to his home (the soul) until the king (Ambition, Pride, Vanity, Self-righteousness, etc.) is dethroned or dead."&lt;ref&gt;Franz Hartmann, The Dweller of the Threshold, Reprinted from The Theosophist, Vol. XI 1889&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Max Heindel]], the Dweller on the Threshold must be confronted by every aspirant—usually at an early stage of his progress into the unseen worlds—and is one of the main causes of obsession.&lt;ref&gt;Max Heindel, ''The Web Destiny'', Rosicrucian Fellowship&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Rudolf Steiner's drama==
In [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s play ''The Guardian of the Threshold'', first performed in 1912 and the third in a series of four "Mystery Dramas", the appearance of the Guardian is connected with [[Lucifer]] and [[Ahriman]].[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Books/GA014/English/APC1925/GA014-3_contents.html] Steiner explained that the meeting with the Guardian of the Threshold as presented in those dramas was to show that a person (man or woman) who had made the soul clairvoyant, must go back and forth across that threshold and know how to be rightly in the spiritual world on the far side, as well as on this side in the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA147/English/AP1987/SecThr_index.html Rudolf Steiner, ''Secrets of the Threshold'', VII]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
*In the short [[Cthulhu mythos]] novel ''[[The Lurker at the Threshold]]'', the title entity is arguably another name for the same entity.
*[[Van Morrison]] refers to himself as a "Dweller on the Threshold" in the song of that name on the album ''Beautiful Vision''.
*The term "Dweller on the Threshold" is used in television show, ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', towards the conclusion of the series. It is mentioned in the context of the [[Black and White Lodges]] which play a central role in the metaphysical backstory of the series.
*In the novel ''Blood of Amber'' in [[Roger Zelazny]]'s [[Chronicles of Amber]] series, Corwin's son Merlin encounters a being of primal chaos named Scrof which calls itself a Dweller on the Threshold.
*The modern pseudo documentary "The Nightmare" draws reference to The Lurker at the Threshold through an entity known as The Shadowman who visits victims during sleep paralysis.

'''Helena Cronin''' (born 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/1999/aug/28/1|title=Darwin's darling|author=Anne Perkins &lt;!-- so it appears from a non-traditional byline --&gt; |date=28 August 1999 |website=www.theguardian.com |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a British [[Darwinian]] philosopher and [[rationalist]]. She is the co-director of the [[Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science]] and the Darwin Centre at the [[London School of Economics]]. She achieved prominence with her book, ''The Ant and the Peacock: Altruism and Sexual Selection from Darwin to Today'' (1991) and has published and broadcast widely since.

==Life and work==

Cronin attended [[Henrietta Barnett School]] in [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]].

Cronin is co-editor of ''Darwinism Today'', a series of short books in [[evolutionary theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.edge.org/memberbio/helena_cronin | title=Edge.org profile | publisher=Edge Org | accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She writes popular articles, such as in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as well as in technical journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/12/gender.comment | title=The vital statistics | publisher=The Guardian | date=12 March 2005 | accessdate=3 May 2013 | author=Cronin, Helena}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a Patron of [[Humanists UK]].&lt;ref name=BHA&gt;{{cite web | url=http://humanism.org.uk/about/our-people/distinguished-supporters/dr-helena-cronin/ | title=Dr Helena Cronin | publisher=British Humanist Association | year=2013 | accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She ran a series of seminars, "effectively a salon at the London School of Economics specialising in the implications of Darwinian theory for humans" according to [[Times Higher Education]], which adds "as an academic promoter Helena Cronin has few equals." The seminars featured [[Richard Dawkins]], [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Steven Pinker]] and [[Matt Ridley]] among others.&lt;ref name=THE&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/159014.article | title=The Darwin Impresario | publisher=Times Higher Education | date=21 October 1996 | accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Cronin was married to another academic, the late dental epidemiologist [[Aubrey Sheiham]], professor of dental public health at [[University College London]]. Her first cousin is Professor Sir [[Michael Marmot]], an [[epidemiologist]].

==Reception==

Cronin's strong rationalistic views brought her prominence in a number of areas, such as sexual selection, Darwinism, the relative abilities of males and females, and gay rights. These are discussed in turn below.

===Altruism and sexual selection===

The evolutionary zoologist [[Mark Ridley (zoologist)|Mark Ridley]], reviewing ''The Ant and the Peacock'' in the ''[[New York Times]]'', writes that it is a "fine book" in which Cronin uses our modern understanding of altruism (the ant) and "dangerously gaudy sexual ornamentation" (the peacock).&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/12/06/specials/cronin-ant.html | title=Why It Pays to Dress Well | publisher=New York Times | date=13 September 1992 | accessdate=3 May 2013 | author=Ridley, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ridley notes that there are two reasons for sex differences like the peacock's train, and that Cronin explains them through the debate of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]]. Darwin proposed female choice: female aesthetics drive male displays. Wallace both "ignored Darwin's problem" (ornamentation) and "denied Darwin's solution" (female choice rather than [[natural selection]]).&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Instead, Ridley observes, Cronin explains that Wallace preferred the explanation that peacock's tails "crop up almost automatically";&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; he believed that female choice was both unnecessary and impossible. Ridley finds Cronin "quite amusing as she reviews the 'misogynistic opinion' of the critics of female choice",&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; citing Cronin's example of the universally unpleasant 19th century anti-Darwinian [[St. George Mivart]], "such is the instability of a vicious feminine caprice, that no constancy of coloration could be produced by its selective action."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; But curiously (notes Ridley), Darwin and Wallace swapped roles in Cronin's problem of the ant, where Darwin argued for natural selection, while Cronin quotes Wallace arguing that for human "intellectual and moral faculties", "we can only find an adequate cause in the unseen universe of Spirit."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Alfred Russel (1889). [[s:Page:Darwinism by Alfred Wallace 1889.djvu/502|''Darwinism'']]. Chapter 15. p. 478&lt;/ref&gt; In Ridley's opinion, "The subtlest and most original insights in "The Ant and the Peacock" concern differences between Darwin's ideas and modern ideas." Ridley finds that Cronin "moves easily between the Victorians and ourselves", not entirely avoiding the danger of anachronism, "the historian's mortal sin", that this movement creates. He suspects that the book will therefore "appeal more to philosophically minded readers than to historians," but grants that "luckily" evolution is "one of the more philosophical of scientific ideas", and Wallace and Darwin can survive being treated as our contemporaries.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

The review of ''The Ant and the Peacock'' in ''Biology and Philosophy'' comments that Cronin's book is "Beautifully written, [with] good strong examples, a nice sense of history, flashes of humour, plain forthright conclusions."&lt;ref name=BioPhilo&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t03010hh70362774/ | title=Review: ''The Ant and the Peacock'' by Helena Cronin | author="M. R." | journal=Biology and philosophy | year=1994 | volume=9 | issue=2 | pages=253–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nils K. Oeijord, in his book ''Why Gould was Wrong'', notes that [[Steven Jay Gould]] "was really a strange thinker."  Oeijord continues, "Example: Many have wondered at Gould's verbally violent review of ''The Ant and the Peacock'' (1991) by Helena Cronin. He attacked Cronin for explaining human altruism as natural! He accused Cronin of errors, omissions, tricks, falsities, rhetorical flourishes, etc. But all these things are typically Gould's ways of writing books!"&lt;ref name=Oeijord&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tkb41TYJP0cC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;lpg=PA137 | title=Why Gould was Wrong | publisher=iUniverse | author=Oeijord, Nils K | year=2003 | pages=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oeijord notes that Cronin was just presenting "the new consensus in evolutionary biology—the [[gene-selectionist]] approach" to which Gould simply had to fight back; but "two scientific giants", [[John Maynard Smith]] and [[Daniel Dennett]] defended Cronin against Gould's charges.&lt;ref name=Oeijord/&gt;

===Darwinism===
The English evolutionary anthropologist [[Camilla Power (anthropologist)|Camilla Power]], in ''A reply to Helena Cronin'', described Cronin as "authoress of 'The Ant and the Peacock' [who] was pontificating .. on how Darwinian theory should inform Blairite social policy...this is a Darwinian's response".&lt;ref name=CamillaPower&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.radicalanthropologygroup.org/old/pub_contra_cronin.pdf | title=A Reply to Helena Cronin | publisher=Radical Anthropology Group | accessdate=3 May 2013 | author=Power, Camilla}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power sets out to "nail a few myths".&lt;ref name=CamillaPower/&gt; She attacks Cronin's claim that women are disposed to wanting a single mate, noting that monogamy is rarer than biologists thought: females resist male efforts to control them; human females too seek "extra-pair copulations (EPCs) in the jargon of [[evolutionary ecology]]",&lt;ref name=CamillaPower/&gt; while among indigenous peoples in the Amazon, females seek "backup fathers for each offspring".&lt;ref name=CamillaPower/&gt; Power observes that men do not necessarily run around, but guard existing mates to limit female choice, contrary to Cronin's view; and among the Aka in the Central African rainforest, men often share in childcare. "Human male strategies are quasi-female by primate standards."&lt;ref name=CamillaPower/&gt; Power then attacks Cronin's view of the lone mother, showing that grandmothers assist their daughters' offspring. Power is critical of Cronin's "mysterious statement about women" that "'They are the species as it existed before sexual selection drove men apart'", observing that human nature evolved in "small-scale, face-to-face societies where no one was richer or poorer."&lt;ref name=CamillaPower/&gt;

===Male qualities===
Edge, in its "Annual Question" in 2008, hosted Cronin in a piece entitled ''More dumbbells but more Nobels: Why men are at the top'':
:"I used to think that these patterns of sex differences resulted mainly from average differences between men and women in innate talents, tastes and temperaments. After all, in talents men are on average more mathematical, more technically minded, women more verbal; in tastes, men are more interested in things, women in people; in temperaments, men are more competitive, risk-taking, single-minded, status-conscious, women far less so. But I have now changed my mind. It is not a matter of averages, but of extremes. Females are much of a muchness, clustering round the mean. But, among males, the variance—the difference between the most and the least, the best and the worst—can be vast. So males are almost bound to be over-represented both at the bottom and at the top. I think of this as 'more dumbbells but more Nobels'."&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Helena. [http://www.edge.org/annual-question/2008/response/10670 Edge: More dumbbells but more Nobels: Why men are at the top]. Retrieved 3 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gay rights===
The El Salvador newspaper ''La Pagina'', discussing the debate about a gay rights law, cited Cronin and [[Alfred Kinsey]] as authorities on the issues involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.lapagina.com.sv/editoriales/80190/El-dolar-traia-bodas-gais | title=El dólar traía bodas gais | publisher=La Pagina | date=11 April 2013 | accessdate=3 May 2013 | author=Aguilar, Marvin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5533">A '''hodograph''' is a diagram that gives a [[Vector (geometric)|vectorial]] visual representation of the movement of a body or a fluid. It is the [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of one end of a variable vector, with the other end fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The position of any plotted data on such a diagram is proportional to the [[velocity]] of the moving particle. It is also called a '''velocity diagram'''. It appears to have been used by [[James Bradley]], but its practical development is mainly from Sir [[William Rowan Hamilton]], who published an account of it in the ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy]]'' in 1846.

==Applications==
It is used in [[physics]], [[astronomy]] and [[fluid mechanics]] to plot deformation of material, motion of planet or any other data that involves the velocities of different parts of a body.

See [[Swinging Atwood's machine]]

===Meteorology===
[[Image:Hodographe NOAA.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Hodograph plot of upper air winds from [[radiosonde]] (Source: [[NOAA]])]]
In [[meteorology]], hodographs are used to plot [[wind]]s from soundings of the [[Earth's atmosphere]]. It is a polar diagram where wind direction is indicated by the angle from the center axis and its strength by the distance from the center. In the figure to the right, at the bottom one finds values of wind at 4 heights above ground. They are plotted by the [[Vector (geometric)|vector]]s &lt;math&gt;\vec V_0&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\vec V_4&lt;/math&gt;. One has to notice that direction are plotted as mentioned in the upper right corner.

With the hodograph and [[thermodynamic diagram]]s like the [[tephigram]], meteorologists can calculate:

* '''Wind shear''': The lines uniting the extremities of successive vectors represent the variation in direction and value of the wind in a layer of the atmosphere. [[Wind shear]] is important information in the development of [[thunderstorm]]s and future evolution of wind at these levels.
* '''Turbulence''': wind shear indicate the possible [[turbulence]] that would cause a [[hazard]] to [[aviation]].
* '''Temperature advection''': change of [[temperature]] in a layer of air can be calculated by the direction of the wind at that level and the direction of the wind shear with the next level. In the northern hemisphere, warm air is to the right of a wind shear between levels in the atmosphere. The opposite is true in the southern one (see [[thermal wind]]). So in the example hodograph, the wind &lt;math&gt;\vec V_3&lt;/math&gt; from southwest meet the right side of the wind shear which means a warm [[advection]] and thus warming of the air at that level.

==Hodograph transformation==
Hodograph transformation is a technique used to transform nonlinear [[partial differential equation]]s into linear version. It consists of interchanging the dependent and independent variables in the equation to achieve linearity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Courant|first1=R.|authorlink1=Richard Courant|last2=Friedrichs|first2=K. O.|authorlink2=Kurt O. Friedrichs|title=Supersonic Flow and Shock Waves|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qsxec0QfYw8C&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=hodograph+transformation#v=onepage&amp;q=hodograph%20transformation&amp;f=false|year=1948|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further reading==

* In his book ''Matter and Motion'', Maxwell writes:
{{Quote|The study of the hodograph, as a method of investigating the motion of a body, was introduced by Sir W. R. Hamilton. The hodograph may be defined as the path traced out by the extremity of a vector which continually represents, in direction and magnitude, the velocity of a moving body. In applying the method of the hodograph to a planet, the orbit of which is in one plane, we shall find it convenient to suppose the hodograph turned round its origin through a right angle, so that the vector of the hodograph is perpendicular instead of parallel to the velocity it represents.}}
:and he applies these techniques to analyse [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's first and second laws]].

In this book the hodograph is used to geometrically derive elliptical (Keplerian) orbits from Newton's laws of motion and gravitation.

The practice of '''human trophy collecting''' involves the acquisition of human remains.  The intent may be to demonstrate dominance over the deceased, such as [[scalping|scalp-taking]] or forming necklaces of human ears or teeth, or to commemorate the deceased, such as the veneration of the relics of saints.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}  It can be done to prove one's success in battle,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=[[Academic American Encyclopedia]] |volume=10 |publisher=[[Grolier]] |year=1997 |quote=In some cultures head-hunting can be considered a manifestation of the widespread practice of removing parts of the body of a slain enemy — as in scalping or the severing of an ear or nose — for war trophies. |isbn=978-0-7172-2068-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to show off one's power to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=[[Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics]] |page=534 |chapter=The head as trophy or cult object |volume=6 |year=1913 |isbn=978-0-543-97870-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murderers' collection of their victims' body parts have also been described as a form of trophy-taking; the [[FBI]] draws a distinction between souvenirs and trophies in this regard.&lt;ref name=harold&gt;{{cite book|author1=Harold Schechter|author2=David Everitt|title=The A to Z Encyclopedia of Serial Killers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4HvZYXHdnBQC&amp;pg=PA290|accessdate=27 January 2011|date=4 July 2006|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-2174-7|pages=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*For example, groups such as the [[Scythians]] collected the skulls of the vanquished to make a [[skull cup]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}
*The practice continued up until the 20th century in the Balkans, and occurred on a smaller scale during World War II and the [[Vietnam War]]. About 60% of the bodies of Japanese soldiers recovered in the [[Mariana Islands]] and returned to Japan lacked skulls.&lt;ref name="Quigley2005"/&gt;

In North America, it was common practice before, during or after the [[lynching]] of African-Americans for those involved to take souvenirs such as body parts, skin, bones, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|publisher=[[Equal Justice Initiative]]|title=Lynching in America: Confronting the Legacy of Racial Terror|year=2017|location=Montgomery, Alabama|url=https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/report/|page=14|edition=3rd|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510151602/https://lynchinginamerica.eji.org/report/|archive-date=2018-05-10|quote=Public spectacle lynchings were those in which large crowds of white people, often numbering in the thousands, gathered to witness pre-planned, heinous killings that featured prolonged torture, mutilation, dismemberment, and/or burning of the victim.

It occurred at Doddsville, recently, and these are the circumstances as related by local newspapers: Luther Holbert, a negro, had a quarrel with a white man and, following the usual Mississippi method, they exchanged shots, the negro escaping and the white man being killed. The negro, knowing the penalty for killing a white man in that section, fled, of course, accompanied by his wife, who had had no part in the quarrel. They were captured by the mob and this is what was done to them, according to the statement of an eye-witness in the Vicksburg Herald."'When the two negroes were captured they were tied to trees, and while the funeral pyres were being prepared they were forced to suffer the most fiendish tortures. The blacks were forced to hold out their hands while one finger at a time was chopped off. The fingers were distributed as souvenirs. The ears of the murderers were cut off. Holbert was severely beaten, his skull was fractured, and one of his eyes, knocked out with a stick, hung by a shred from the socket. Neither the man nor the woman begged for mercy, nor made a groan or plea. When the executioners came forward to lop off fingers, Holbert extended his hand without being asked. The most excruciating form of punishment consisted in the use of a large corkscrew in the hands of one of the mob. This instrument was bored into the flesh of the man and the woman, in the arms, legs, and body, and pulled out, the spiral tearing out big pieces of raw, quivering flesh every time it was withdrawn.'""}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''If we were movin' through the jungle, they'd just put the bloody ear on the chain and stick the ear in their pocket and keep on going. Wouldn't take time to dry it off.

Traditional '''Japanese units of measurement''' or the '''shakkanhō''' ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|尺貫法}}}}, "''shaku–kan'' system") is the [[customary units|traditional]] [[system of measurement]] used by the people of the [[Japanese archipelago]]. It is largely based on the [[Chinese units of measurement|Chinese system]], which spread to Japan and the rest of the [[Sinosphere]] in antiquity. It has remained mostly unaltered since the adoption of the measures of the [[Tang Dynasty]] in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}701.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Following the [[Meiji Restoration]], [[Imperial Japan]] [[metrication|adopted]] the [[metric system]] and defined the traditional units in metric terms on the basis of a [[prototype metre]] and [[prototype kilogram|kilogram]]. The present values of most [[Korean units|Korean]] and [[Taiwanese units of measurement]] derive from these values as well, owing to their occupations by the Japanese.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

For a time in the early [[20th century]], the traditional, metric, and [[English units|English systems]] were all legal in Japan. Although commerce has since been legally restricted to using the metric system, the old system is still used in some instances. The old measures are common in [[Japanese carpentry|carpentry]] and [[Japanese agriculture|agriculture]], with tools such as [[Japanese chisel|chisel]]s, spatels, saws, and hammers manufactured in ''sun'' and ''bu'' sizes. [[Floorspace]] is expressed in terms of [[tatami mat]]s, and land is sold on the basis of price in ''tsubo''. Many [[rice cooker]]s are sold with measuring cups of 1{{nbsp}}''[[gō (unit)|gō]]''.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==History==
Customary Japanese units are a local adaption of the [[Chinese units|traditional Chinese system]], which was adopted at a very early date. They were imposed and adjusted at various times by local and imperial statutes. The details of the system have varied over time and location in Japan's history.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

Japan signed the [[Treaty of the Metre]] in 1885, with its terms taking effect in 1886.&lt;ref name=mitsua/&gt; It received its [[prototype metre]] and [[prototype kilogram|kilogram]] from the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] in 1890.&lt;ref name=mitsua/&gt; The next year, a weights and measurements law codified the Japanese system, taking its fundamental units to be the ''shaku'' and ''kan'' and deriving the others from them.&lt;ref name=mitsua/&gt; The law codified the values of the traditional and metric units in terms of one another,&lt;ref name=mitsua/&gt; but retained the traditional units as the formal standard and metric values as secondary.{{sfnp|Lyon|1901|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=yShJAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA933 933]}}

In 1909, [[English units]] were also made legal within the [[Empire of Japan]].&lt;ref name=mitsua/&gt; Following [[Japan in World War I|World War I]], the [[Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce]] established a Committee for Weights and Measures and Industrial Standards, part of whose remit was to investigate which of Japan's three legal systems should be adopted.&lt;ref name=mitsua/&gt; Upon its advice, the Imperial Diet established the metric system as Japan's legal standard, effective 1 July 1924,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=改正度量衡法規 |contribution-url=http://kindai.da.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/796077 |title=Digital Collections |url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/?__lang=en |location=Tokyo |publisher=National Diet Library }}. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; with use of the other systems permitted as a transitional measure.&lt;ref name=mitsua/&gt; The government and "leading industries" were to convert within the next decade, with others following in the decade after that.&lt;ref name=mitsub&gt;{{harvp|Tamano|1971|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFLL50miMpgC&amp;pg=PA98 98]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Education in Japan|Public education]]—at the time compulsory through [[primary school]]—began to teach the metric system.&lt;ref name=mitsub/&gt; Governmental agencies and the Japanese Weights and Measures Association undertook a gradual course of education and conversion but opposition became vehemently outspoken in the early 1930s. [[Japanese nationalism|Nationalist]]s decried the "foreign" system as harmful to Japanese pride, language, and culture, as well as restrictive to international trade. In 1933, the government pushed the deadline for the conversion of the first group of industries to 1939; the rest of the country was given until 1954.&lt;ref name=mitsub/&gt; Emboldened, the nationalists succeeded in having an Investigating Committee for Weights and Measures Systems established. In 1938, it advised that the government should continue to employ the "Shaku–Kan" system alongside the metric one.&lt;ref name=mitsub/&gt; The next year, the imperial ordinance concerning the transition to the metric system was formally revised, indefinitely exempting real estate and historical objects and treasures from any need for metric conversion. The deadline for compulsory conversion in all other fields was moved back to 31 December 1958.&lt;ref name=mitsub/&gt;

Following [[Surrender of Japan|its defeat]] in [[Pacific War|World War II]], Japan was [[Occupation of Japan|occupied by America]] and saw an expanded use of [[US customary units]]. [[Gasoline]] was sold by the [[gallon]] and [[cloth]] by the [[yard (unit)|yard]].&lt;ref name=mitsuc&gt;{{harvp|Tamano|1971|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFLL50miMpgC&amp;pg=PA99 99]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Diet revisited the nation's measurements and, with the occupation's approval, promulgated a Measurements Law in June 1951 that reaffirmed its intention to continue Japan's metrication, effective on the first day of 1959.&lt;ref name=mitsuc/&gt; An unofficial and ''ad hoc'' Metric System Promotion Committee was established by interested scholars, public servants, and businessmen in August 1955, undertaking a public awareness campaign and seeking to accomplish as much of the conversion ahead of schedule as possible.&lt;ref name=mitsuc/&gt; Its first success was the conversion of candy sales in Tokyo department stores from the ''momme'' to the gram in September 1956; others followed, with [[NHK]] taking the lead in media use.&lt;ref name=mitsud&gt;{{harvp|Tamano|1971|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFLL50miMpgC&amp;pg=PA100 100]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the majority of the public now exposed to it since childhood,&lt;ref name=mitsub/&gt; the metric system became the sole legal measurement system in most fields of Japanese life on 1 January 1959.&lt;ref name=mitsua&gt;{{harvp|Tamano|1971|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFLL50miMpgC&amp;pg=PA97 97]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Redrafting of laws to use metric equivalents had already been accomplished, but conversion of the [[land registry|land registries]] required until 31 March 1966 to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution=メートル条約 |publisher=International Metrology Cooperation Office |contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722110749/http://www.intermet.jp/metric/ |url=http://www.intermet.jp/en/ |title=''Official site'' |location=Ibaraki |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309141632/http://www.intermet.jp/en/ |archivedate=9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mitsud/&gt; Industry transitioned gradually at its own expense, with compliance sometimes being nominal, as in the case of {{convert|1/4|in|adj=on|lk=on}} screws becoming "¼ screws".&lt;ref name=mitsue&gt;{{harvp|Tamano|1971|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFLL50miMpgC&amp;pg=PA101 101]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the original fines for noncompliance were around [[USD|$]]140 and governmental agencies mostly preferred to wait for voluntary conversion, metric use by December 1959 was estimated at only 85%.&lt;ref name=mitsuf&gt;{{harvp|Tamano|1971|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFLL50miMpgC&amp;pg=PA102 102]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since research showed that individual Japanese did not intend to actually use the metric units when given other options, however, sale and verification of devices marked with non-metric units (such as rulers and tape measures noting ''shaku'' and ''sun'') were criminalised after 1961.&lt;ref name=mitsue/&gt; 

Some use of the traditional units continues. Some Japanese describe their weight in terms of ''kan''.&lt;ref name=mitsue/&gt; Homes continue to be reckoned in terms of ''tsubo'', even on the [[Japanese census|national census]] as late as 2005, although the practice was discontinued in 2010.{{fact|date=June 2017}} [[English unit]]s continue to be employed in [[aviation]],&lt;ref name=mitsuf/&gt; [[munitions]],&lt;ref name=mitsuf/&gt; and various sports, including [[golf]] and [[Japanese baseball|baseball]].&lt;ref name=mitsue/&gt;

== Length ==
The base unit of Japanese length is the ''shaku'' based upon the Chinese ''[[chi (unit)|chi]]'', with other units derived from it and changing over time based on its dimensions. The ''chi'' was originally a [[span (unit)|span]] taken from the end of the [[thumb]] to the tip of an outstretched middle finger, but which gradually increased in length to about {{convert|1/3|m|cm|lk=on}}, just a few centimeters longer than the size of a [[US foot|foot]].{{fact|date=June 2018}}

As in China and Korea, Japan employed different ''shaku'' for different purposes. The "carpentry" ''shaku'' ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|曲尺}}}}, ''kanejaku'') was used for construction. It was a little longer in the 19th century prior to its metric redefinition.{{efn|In the 10th lunar month of the 3rd year of [[Meiji period|Meiji]] (around November 1871), the [[Ministry of Railways (Japan)|Railways Ministry]] defined the "[[US foot|English foot]]" as 1 ''shaku'' 4 ''rin'', making the ''shaku'' equivalent to about 0.996{{nbsp}}ft.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=''日本鉄道史 [''Nippon Tetsud&amp;#333;-shi'', ''Japanese Railway History''], Vol. I'' |publisher=Ministry of Railways |location=Tokyo |date=1921 |p=49 }}. {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The "cloth"&lt;ref name=uswd/&gt; or "whale" ''shaku'' ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|鯨尺}}}}, ''kujirajaku''), named for tailors' and fabric merchants' [[baleen]] rulers, was ¼ longer&lt;ref name=uswd/&gt; and used in measuring cloth. (A longer unit of about 25{{nbsp}}cloth ''shaku'' was the ''tan''.)&lt;ref name=uswd/&gt; [[Traditional Japanese clothing]] was reckoned using the "traditional clothing" ''shaku'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|呉服尺}}}}, ''gofukujaku''), about {{frac|5}} longer than the carpentry ''shaku''. The [[Shosoin|Shōsōin]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] has ivory 1-''shaku''{{which?|date=June 2017}} rulers, the {{nihongo|''kōgebachiru-no-shaku''|紅牙撥鏤尺|}}.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

The Japanese ri is now much longer than the [[Li (unit)|Chinese]] or [[Korean li]], comprising 36 ''chō'', 2160 ''ken'',&lt;ref name=reny&gt;{{harvp|Renouard|1845|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LDxOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA486 486]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or 12,960{{nbsp}}''shaku''. A still longer unit was formerly standard in [[Ise Province|Ise]] on [[Honshu]] and throughout the [[Saikaidō|9 provinces]] of [[Kyushu]], which comprised 50 ''chō'', 3000 ''ken'',&lt;ref name=reny/&gt; or 18,000{{nbsp}}''shaku''. The [[imperial nautical mile]] of 6080{{nbsp}}[[imperial feet|feet]] (1853.19{{nbsp}}m) was also formerly used by the Japanese in maritime contexts as a "marine ri".&lt;ref name=uswd&gt;{{harvp|USWD|1944|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-s4DDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA400 400]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth and shorter ri of about 600{{nbsp}}m is still evident in some beach names. The "99-Ri" beach at Kujukuri is about 60&amp;nbsp;km. The "7-Ri" beach at Shichiri is 4.2&amp;nbsp;km long.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

The traditional units are still used for construction materials in Japan. For example, plywood is usually manufactured in {{nowrap|182 cm × 91 cm}} (about {{nowrap|72 in × 36 in}}) sheets known in the trade as {{nihongo|''saburokuhan''|3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;6版|}}, or 3&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;6 ''shaku''. Each sheet is about the size of one [[tatami]] mat. The thicknesses of the sheets, however, are usually measured in millimetres. The names of these units also live in the name of the bamboo flute {{nihongo|[[shakuhachi]]|尺八|}}, literally "shaku eight", which measures one ''shaku'' and eight ''sun'', and the Japanese version of the Tom Thumb story, {{nihongo|[[One-inch boy|Issun Bōshi]]|一寸法師|}}, literally "one ''sun'' boy", as well as in many [[Japanese proverbs]].{{fact|date=June 2018}}

== Area ==
The base unit of Japanese area is the ''[[tsubo]]'', equivalent to a square [[ken (architecture)|ken]] or 36 square ''shaku''. It is twice the size of the ''jō'', the area of the Nagoya [[tatami]] mat. Both units are used informally in discussing real estate [[floorspace]]. Due to [[Taiwan_under_Japanese_rule|historical connections]], the tsubo is still used as the official base unit of [[Taiwanese_units_of_measurement#Area|area in Taiwan]].{{fact|date=June 2018}}

In agricultural contexts, the ''tsubo'' is known as the ''bu''. The larger units remain in common use by Japanese farmers when discussing the sizes of fields.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

== Volume ==
[[File:1 Go.jpg|thumb|A sake cup (1 ''gō '') for celebrations.]]
The base unit of Japanese volume is the ''shō'', although the ''[[gō (unit)|gō]]'' now sees more use since it is reckoned as the appropriate size of a [[serving size|serving]] of rice or [[sake]]. Sake bottles are now marketed as containing 1800{{nbsp}}mL exactly.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

The ''[[koku]]'' is historically important: since it was reckoned as the amount of rice necessary to feed a person for a single year, it was used to compute agricultural output and official salaries.{{fact|date=June 2017}} The ''koku'' of rice was sometimes reckoned as 3000{{nbsp}}"sacks".&lt;ref name=reny/&gt; By the 1940s the shipping ''koku'' was {{frac|10}} of the [[shipping ton]]&lt;ref name=uswd/&gt; of 40 or 42{{nbsp}}[[cubic foot|ft³]] (i.e., {{convert|4|-|4.2|cuft|L|disp=out}}); the ''koku'' of [[timber]] was about 10{{nbsp}}[[cubic foot|ft³]] ({{convert|10|cuft|L|disp=out}});&lt;ref name=uswd/&gt; and the ''koku'' of fish, like many modern [[bushel]]s, was no longer reckoned by volume but computed by weight (40{{nbsp}}''kan'').&lt;ref name=uswd/&gt; The ''shakujime'' of timber was about 12{{nbsp}}[[cubic foot|ft³]] ({{convert|12|cuft|L|disp=out}}) and the ''taba'' about 108{{nbsp}}[[cubic foot|ft³]] ({{convert|108|cuft|L|disp=out}} or {{convert|108|cuft|m3|disp=out}}).&lt;ref name=uswd/&gt;

{{anchor|Mass}}

==Weight==
The base unit of Japanese [[weight]] or [[mass]] is the ''kan'', although the ''momme'' is in more common use. It is a recognized unit in the international [[pearl]] industry.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

The Japanese form of the [[Chinese units of measure|Chinese]] [[tael]] was the ''ryō'' ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|両}}}}).{{efn|The ''ryō'' is sometimes written in English as ryo, without its [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]].{{sfn|''OED''|loc=[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/169267 "ryo, ''n.''"]}} It also appears in English sources as the [[tael]],{{sfn|''OED''|loc=[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/196989 "tael, ''n.''"]}} the ''táīl'', the ''táhil'', and the ''táïl''.&lt;ref name=reny/&gt;}} It was customarily reckoned as around 4 or 10{{nbsp}}momme&lt;ref name=reny/&gt; but, because of its importance as a fundamental unit of the [[silver]] and [[gold]] [[bullion]] used as [[Japanese currency|currency]] in medieval Japan, it varied over time and location from those notional values.{{fact|date=June 2018}}

==English units==
[[English units]]—both [[US units|US]] and [[imperial units|imperial]]—see use in some Japanese contexts. [[US foot|Feet]] and [[inch]]es are used for most non-sport [[bicycle]]s, whose [[tire]] sizes follow a British system; for sizes of [[magnetic tape]] and many pieces of [[computer industry|computer]] hardware; for [[photograph]] sizes; and for the sizes of [[Display device|display screen]]s for electronic devices. Photographic prints, however, are usually rounded to the nearest millimetre and screens are not ''described'' in terms of inches but "type" ({{lang|ja|{{linktext|型}}}}, ''gata''). For instance, a television whose screen has a 17-inch diagonal is described as a "17-type" (17{{lang|ja|{{linktext|型}}}}) and one with a 32-inch [[widescreen]] screen is called a "32-vista-type" (32V{{lang|ja|{{linktext|型}}}}).{{fact|date=June 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6695">'''Karl Duncker''' (2 February 1903, in [[Leipzig]] – 23 February 1940) was a [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologist]]. He attended Friedrich-Wilhelms-University from 1923 to 1923, and spent 1925–1926 at [[Clark University]] in Worcester, MA as a visiting professor, where he received a masters in arts degree.&lt;ref&gt;Schnall S. 2007. [https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/239301/Schnall%20%281999%29.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Life as the Problem: Karl Duncker's Context]. In ''Thinking in Psychological Science: Ideas and Their Makers'', editor: Jaan Valsiner. Transaction.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Until 1935 he was a student and assistant of the founders of [[Gestalt psychology]] in Berlin: [[Max Wertheimer]],  [[Wolfgang Köhler]] and   [[Kurt Koffka]].
In 1935, exiled by the Nazis, he got an assistantship in Cambridge with [[Frederic Charles Bartlett]] and later immigrated to the US, where he was again an assistant of  [[Wolfgang Köhler]]’s at [[Swarthmore College]].  He committed suicide in 1940 at 37 years of age. He had been suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] for some time and had received professional treatment.

His younger brother Wolfgang Duncker, a communist in exile in Moscow, was arrested in 1938 during the [[Great Purges]] and died in the [[Gulag]]. Their parents were the well-known socialist and later communist propagandists Hermann and [[Käte Duncker]].

== Achievements ==

Duncker coined the term [[functional fixedness]] for describing the difficulties in [[visual perception]] and in [[problem solving]] that arise from the fact that one element of a whole situation already has a (fixed) function which has to be changed for making the correct perception or for finding the solution to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;''Zur Psychologie des produktiven Denkens'', Springer, Berlin 1935&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Genimage.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The candle problem (Karl Duncker, 1945).]]
In his "[[The Candle Problem|candle problem]]" the situation was defined by the objects: a candle, a box of thumb-tacks and a book of matches. The task was to fix the candles on the wall without any additional elements. The difficulty of this problem arises from the functional fixedness of the box, which originally contained thumb-tacks. It is a container in the problem situation but must be used as a shelf in the solution situation.

Other examples for this type of mental [[restructuring]] are:

* an electromagnet must be used as part of a pendulum
* a branch of a tree must be used as a tool
* a brick must be used a paper weight
* another meaning of a word must be found that is different from the meaning within the context of the sentence

It is mainly used for the evaluation of [[nuclear medicine]] [[medical imaging|imaging]] data after the injection of a labeled ligand that binds reversibly to specific [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] or [[enzyme]].

In conventional [[Multi-compartment model|compartmental analysis]], an [[iterative method]] is used to fit the individual model parameters in the solution of a compartmental model of specific configuration to the measurements with a measured plasma time-activity curve that serves as an forcing (input) function, and the binding of the tracer can then be described. Graphical analysis is a simplified method that transforms the model equations into a linear equation evaluated at multiple time points and provides fewer parameters (i.e., slope and intercept). Although the slope and the intercept can be interpreted in terms of a combination of model parameters if a compartmental model configuration is assumed, the graphical methods are independent of any specific model configuration. In case of irreversible tracers, certain fraction of the radioactivity is trapped in the tissue or the binding site during the course of the experiment, whereas reversible tracers show uptake and loss from all compartments throughout the study. The theoretical foundation of graphical analysis for irreversible tracers (also called [[Patlak plot|Patlak graphical analysis]] or [[Patlak plot]]) was laid by [[Clifford Patlak]] and his colleagues&lt;ref name="Patlak1983"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=C.S.

Based on the original work of Patlak, [[Jean Logan]] and her colleagues&lt;ref name="Logan1990" /&gt; from [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] extended the method to tracers with reversible kinetics.

== Description ==

The kinetics of radiolabeled compounds in a compartmental system can be described in terms of a set of first-order, constant-coefficient, ordinary differential equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=K. Godfrey | title=Compartmental Models and Their Application | publisher=Academic Press, New York | year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=J.A. Jacquez | title=Compartmental Analysis in Biology and Medicine | publisher=The University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor | edition=2nd | year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The time course of the activity in the multicompartmental system driven by a metabolite-corrected plasma input function &lt;math&gt;C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt; can be described by:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mathbf{A}}{dt} = \mathbf{KA} + \mathbf{Q}C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; is a column vector of activity concentration for each compartment at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt; is the matrix of the transfer constants between compartments, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of plasma-to-tissue transfer constants. Patlak and Blasberg&lt;ref name="Patlak1985" /&gt; showed that the above equation can be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;\int_0^t A(\tau) \, d\tau = -\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} \int_0^t C_p(\tau) \, d\tau + \mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}_n^T&lt;/math&gt; represents a row vector of 1s and &lt;math&gt;A(t) = \mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;.  The total activity in the [[region of interest]], &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ROI}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, is a combination of radioactivities from all compartments plus a plasma volume fraction (&lt;math&gt;V_p&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;ref name="Patlak1983" /&gt; and thus:

: &lt;math&gt;\int_0^t \mathrm{ROI}(\tau) \, d\tau = (-\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} +V_p) \int_0^t C_p(\tau) \, d\tau + \mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;

By [[division (mathematics)|dividing]] both sides by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ROI}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, one obtains the following linear equation:

: &lt;math&gt;{{\int_0^t \mathrm{ROI}(\tau) \, d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)} = (-\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} +V_p) {{\int_0^t C_p(\tau) \, d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)} + {{\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}} \over {\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{A} + V_p C_p}}&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;t &gt; t'&lt;/math&gt;, Patlak and his colleagues&lt;ref name="Patlak1983" /&gt; showed that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A} = -\mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} C_p(t)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the steady-state condition.  When this condition is satisfied, the intercept has reached its constant value so that after some time a plot of &lt;math&gt;{{\int_{0}^{t} C_p(\tau)d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)}&lt;/math&gt; versus &lt;math&gt;{{\int_{0}^{t} \mathrm{ROI}(\tau)d\tau} \over \mathrm{ROI}(t)}&lt;/math&gt; becomes a straight line with slope &lt;math&gt;(-\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{Q} + V_p)&lt;/math&gt; and intercept &lt;math&gt;{{\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{K}^{-1} \mathbf{A}} \over {\mathbf{U}_n^T \mathbf{A} + V_p C_p}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Logan1990" /&gt;

For a catenary two-tissue compartment model with transfer constants &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt; (forward transport from plasma to tissue), &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; (reverse transport from tissue to plasma), &lt;math&gt;k_3&lt;/math&gt; ([[Binding (molecular)|binding]] parameter proportional to &lt;math&gt;B_\max k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;k_4&lt;/math&gt; (dissociation constant) to analyze enzyme or receptor system, the slope represents the total [[distribution volume]] (&lt;math&gt;V_d&lt;/math&gt;) and is given by &lt;math&gt;\frac{K_1}{k_2}(1+\frac{k_3}{k_4}) + V_p&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name="Logan1990" /&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k_3 = B_\max k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_4 = k_\mathrm{off}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{k_3}{k_4} = \frac{B_\max}{K_d}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;K_d = k_\mathrm{off}/k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt;, in which &lt;math&gt;B_\max&lt;/math&gt; is the concentration of ligand binding sites, &lt;math&gt;K_d&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium [[dissociation constant]] for the ligand-binding site complex, &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{on}&lt;/math&gt; is the ligand-binding association constant, &lt;math&gt;k_\mathrm{off}&lt;/math&gt; is the ligand-binding dissociation constant.  For a one-tissue compartment model with transfer constants &lt;math&gt;K_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt;, the slope is &lt;math&gt;\lambda + V_p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[partition coefficient]] (&lt;math&gt;{K_1}/{k_2}&lt;/math&gt;) and the intercept is &lt;math&gt;\frac{-1}{k_2(1+V_p/\lambda)}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Logan1990" /&gt;

  | isbn =0-465-00708-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''nostalgia'' is learned formation of a [[Greek language|Greek]] compound, consisting of {{lang|grc|[[Nostos|νόστος]]}} (''nóstos''), meaning "homecoming", a [[Homer]]ic word, and {{lang|grc|ἄλγος}} (''álgos''), meaning "pain" or "ache", and was coined by a 17th-century medical student to describe the anxieties displayed by [[Swiss mercenaries]] fighting away from home. Described as a medical condition—a form of [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]]—in the [[Early Modern period]],&lt;ref name=NYMag20160225/&gt; it became an important [[Trope (literature)|trope]] in [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref name=boym/&gt;

Nostalgia is associated with a  yearning for the past, its personalities, and events, especially the "good old days" or a "warm childhood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sedikides|first1=Constantine|last2=Wildschut|first2=Tim|last3=Arndt|first3=Jamie|last4=Routledge|first4=Clay|title=Nostalgia: Past, Present, and Future|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=October 2008|volume=17|issue=5|pages=304–307|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00595.x|url=https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~crsi/Sedikides%20Wildschut%20Arndt%20%20Routledge%202008%20CDir.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific literature on nostalgia usually refers to nostalgia regarding the personal life and has mainly studied the effects of nostalgia induced during the studies.&lt;ref&gt;see the research of Constantine Sedikides and colleagues, http://www.southampton.ac.uk/psychology/about/staff/cs2.page.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olfaction|Smell]] and [[touch]] are strong evokers of nostalgia due to the processing of these [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] first passing through the [[amygdala]], the [[emotional]] seat of the [[brain]]. These recollections of one's past are usually important events, people one cares about, and places where one has spent time. [[Music]]&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/mental-mishaps/201105/music-evoked-nostalgia&lt;/ref&gt; and [[weather]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Study: Nostalgia Makes Us Warm, and Cold Makes Us Nostalgic|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/12/study-nostalgia-makes-us-warm-and-cold-makes-us-nostalgic/265852/|date=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; can also be strong triggers of nostalgia. Nostalgic preferences, the belief that the past was better than the present, have been linked to biases in memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = It Was a Most Unusual Time: How Memory Bias Engenders Nostalgic Preferences|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdm.1767/abstract|journal = Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|date = 2013-10-01|issn = 1099-0771|pages = 319–326|volume = 26|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/bdm.1767|language = en|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Nostalgia's definition has changed greatly over time.  Consistent with its Greek word roots meaning "homecoming" and "pain," nostalgia was for centuries considered a potentially debilitating and sometimes fatal medical condition expressing extreme [[homesickness]].&lt;ref name=NYMag20160225&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dahl |first1=Melissa |title=The Little-Known Medical History of Homesickness |url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/homesickness-was-once-considered-a-medical-diagnosis.html |publisher=''New York'' magazine |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160301021127/http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/homesickness-was-once-considered-a-medical-diagnosis.html |archivedate=March 1, 2016 |date=February 25, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern view is that nostalgia is an independent, and even positive, emotion that many people experience often. Occasional nostalgia has been found to have many functions, such as to improve mood, increase social connectedness, enhance positive self-regard, and provide existential meaning. Many nostalgic reflections serve more than one function, and overall seem to benefit those who experience them. Such benefits may lead to a chronic disposition or personality trait of "nostalgia proneness."&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Köneke: ''More bitter than sweet - Are nostalgic people rather sad than happy after all?'' GRIN Verlag GmbH, München 2010, {{ISBN|978-3640942268}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Nostalgia for early experience as a determinant of consumer preferences|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mar.10074/abstract|journal = Psychology and Marketing|date = 2003-04-01|issn = 1520-6793|pages = 275–302|volume = 20|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/mar.10074|language = en|first = Robert M.|last = Schindler|first2 = Morris B.|last2 = Holbrook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improve mood===
Although nostalgia is often triggered by negative feelings, it results in increasing one's mood and heightening positive emotions, which can stem from feelings of warmth or coping resulting from nostalgic reflections. One way to improve mood is to effectively cope with problems that hinder one's happiness. Batcho (2013) found that nostalgia proneness positively related to successful methods of coping throughout all stages—planning and implementing strategies, and reframing the issue positively. These studies led to the conclusion that the coping strategies that are likely among nostalgia prone people often lead to benefits during stressful times. Nostalgia can be connected to more focus on coping strategies and implementing them, thus increasing support in challenging times.&lt;ref&gt;Batcho, K. I. (2013). "Nostalgia: Retreat or support in difficult times?" ''The American Journal of Psychology'',&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increase social connectedness===
Nostalgia also sometimes involves memories of people you were close to, and thus it can increase one's sense of social support and connections. Nostalgia is also triggered specifically by feelings of loneliness, but counteracts such feelings with reflections of close relationships. According to Zhou et al. (2008), lonely people often have lesser perceptions of social support. Loneliness, however, leads to nostalgia, which actually increases perceptions of social support. Thus, Zhou and colleagues (2008) concluded that nostalgia serves a restorative function for individuals regarding their social connectedness.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou, X., Sedikides, C., Wildschut, T., &amp; Gao, D. (2008). "Counteracting loneliness: On the restorative function of nostalgia." ''Psychological Science'', 19(10), 1023–1029.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enhance positive self-regard===
Nostalgia serves as a coping mechanism and helps people to feel better about themselves. Vess et al. (2012) found that the subjects who thought of nostalgic memories showed a greater accessibility of positive characteristics than those who thought of exciting future experiences. Additionally, in a second study conducted, some participants were exposed to nostalgic engagement and reflection while the other group was not. The researchers looked again at self-attributes and found that the participants who were not exposed to nostalgic experiences reflected a pattern of selfish and self-centered attributes. Vess et al. (2012), however, found that this effect had weakened and become less powerful among the participants who engaged in nostalgic reflection.&lt;ref&gt;Vess, M., Arndt, J., Routledge, C., Sedikides, C., &amp; Wildschut, T. (2012). "Nostalgia as a resource for the self." ''Self and Identity'', 11(3), 273–284.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provide existential meaning===
Nostalgia helps increase one's self-esteem and meaning in life by buffering threats to well-being and also by initiating a desire to deal with problems or stress. Routledge (2011) and colleagues found that nostalgia correlates positively with one's sense of meaning in life. The second study revealed that nostalgia increases one's perceived meaning in life, which was thought to be mediated by a sense of social support or connectedness. Thirdly, the researchers found that threatened meaning can even act as a trigger for nostalgia, thus increasing one's nostalgic reflections. By triggering nostalgia, though, one's defensiveness to such threat is minimized as found in the fourth study. The final two studies found that nostalgia is able to not only create meaning, but buffer threats to meaning by breaking the connection between a lack of meaning and one's well being. Follow-up studies also completed by Routledge in 2012 not only found meaning as a function of nostalgia, but also concluded that nostalgic people have greater perceived meaning, search for meaning less, and can better buffer existential threat.&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, C., Arndt, J., Wildschut, T., Sedikides, C., &amp; Hart, C. M. (2011). "The past makes the present meaningful: Nostalgia as an existential resource." ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology'', 101(3), 638–652.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Routledge, C., Wildschut, T., Sedikides, C., Juhl, J., &amp; Arndt, J. (2012). "The power of the past: Nostalgia as a meaning-making resource." ''Memory'', 20(5), 452–460&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promote psychological growth===
Nostalgia makes people more willing to engage in growth-oriented behaviors and encourages them to view themselves as growth-oriented people. Baldwin &amp; Landau (2014) found that nostalgia leads people to rate themselves higher on items like "I am the kind of person who embraces unfamiliar people, events, and places." Nostalgia also increased interest in growth-related behavior such as "I would like to explore someplace that I have never been before." In the first study, these effects were [[Mediation (statistics)|statistically mediated]] by nostalgia-induced positive affect—the extent to which nostalgia made participants feel good. In the second study, nostalgia led to the same growth outcomes but the effects were statistically mediated by nostalgia-induced self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, M. &amp; Landau, M.J. (2014). "Exploring nostalgia's influence on psychological growth" ''Self and Identity'', 13(2), 162-177.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a deception===
One recent study critiques the idea of nostalgia, which in some forms can become a defense mechanism by which people avoid the historical facts.&lt;ref&gt;Hook, D.(2012) "Screened history: Nostalgia as defensive formation." ''Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology'', Vol 18(3), Aug, 2012. Special issue: ''Of Narratives and Nostalgia''. pp. 225–239&lt;/ref&gt; This study looked at the different portrayals of apartheid in South Africa and argued that nostalgia appears as two ways,&lt;ref name="Boym, S. 2001"&gt;Boym, S. (2001). The future of nostalgia. New York, NY: Basic Books&lt;/ref&gt; 'restorative nostalgia' a wish to return to that past, and 'reflective nostalgia' which is more critically aware.

===As a comfort===
Reliving past memories may provide comfort and contribute to mental health.&lt;ref name=NYT7813&gt;{{cite news|title=What Is Nostalgia Good For? Quite a Bit, Research Shows|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/science/what-is-nostalgia-good-for-quite-a-bit-research-shows.html|accessdate=July 9, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 8, 2013|author=John Tierney}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable recent medical study has looked at the physiological effects thinking about past 'good' memories can have. They found that thinking about the past 'fondly' actually increased perceptions of physical warmth.&lt;ref&gt;"Heartwarming memories: Nostalgia maintains physiological comfort." Zhou, Xinyue; Wildschut, Tim; Sedikides, Constantine; Chen, Xiaoxi; Vingerhoets, ''Ad J. J. M.Emotion'', Vol 12(4), Aug 2012, 678–684. doi: 10.1037/a0027236&lt;/ref&gt;

===As a political tool===
In a 2014 study conducted by Routledge, he and a team observed that the more people reported having major disruptions and uncertainties in their lives, the more they nostalgically longed for the past. Routledge suggests that by invoking the idea of an idealized past, politicians can provoke the social and cultural anxieties and uncertainties that make nostalgia especially attractive — and effective — as a tool of political persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;C. Sedikides, T. Wildschut, C. Routledge, &amp; J. Arndt (2014). "Nostalgia counteracts self-discontinuity and restores self-continuity" ''European Journal of Social Psychology'', 10.1002/ejsp.2073&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Routledge |first=Clay |title=Approach With Caution: Nostalgia Is a Potent Political Agent |date=October 31, 2017 |newspaper=Undark Magazine |url=https://undark.org/article/nostalgia-power-politics-trump/ |archive-url=https://undark.org/article/nostalgia-power-politics-trump/ |archive-date=October 31, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other aspects==

===As a medical condition===
{{Further|Homesickness}}
The term was coined in  1688 by Johannes Hofer (1669–1752) in his [[Basel]] dissertation. Hofer introduced ''nostalgia'' or ''mal du pays'' "[[homesickness]]" for the condition also known as ''mal du Suisse'' "Swiss illness" or ''Schweizerheimweh'' "Swiss homesickness," because of its frequent occurrence in [[Swiss mercenaries]] who in the plains of lowlands France or Italy were pining for their native mountain landscapes. Symptoms were also thought to include fainting, high fever, indigestion, stomach pain, and death. Military physicians hypothesized that the malady was due to damage to the victims' brain cells and ear drums by the constant clanging of cowbells in the pastures of Switzerland.&lt;ref name=NYT7813 /&gt;

English ''homesickness'' is a [[loan translation]] of ''nostalgia''. [[Joseph Banks|Sir Joseph Banks]] used the word in his journal during the first voyage of [[Captain Cook]]. On 3 September 1770 he stated that the sailors "were now pretty far gone with the longing for home which the Physicians have gone so far as to esteem a disease under the name of Nostalgia," but his journal was not published in his lifetime (see [[John Beaglehole|Beaglehole, J. C.]] (ed.). The Endeavour Journal of Joseph Banks 1768–1771, Public Library of New South Wales/Angus and Robertson, Sydney, 1962, vol. ii, p.&amp;nbsp;145). Cases resulting in death were known and soldiers were sometimes successfully treated by being discharged and sent home. Receiving a diagnosis was, however, generally regarded as an insult. In 1787 Robert Hamilton (1749–1830, physician of Ipswich) described a case of a soldier suffering from nostalgia, who received sensitive and successful treatment:

{{Cquote|''In the year 1782, while I lay in barracks at [[Tynemouth|Tin mouth]] in the north of England, a recruit who had lately joined the regiment ... was returned in sick list, with a message from his captain, requesting I would take him into the hospital. He had only been a few months a soldier; was young, handsome, and well-made for the service; but a melancholy hung over his countenance, and wanness preyed on his cheeks. He complained of a universal weakness, but no fixed pain; a noise in his ears, and giddiness of his head. ... As there were little obvious symptoms of fever, I did not well know what to make of the case. ... Some weeks passed with little alteration ... excepting that he was evidently become more meager. He scarcely took any nourishment ... became indolent. ... He was put on a course of strengthening medicines; wine was allowed him. All proved ineffectual. He had now been in the hospital three months, and was quite emaciated, and like one in the last stage of consumption. ... On making my morning visit, and inquiring, as usual, of his rest at the nurse, she happened to mention the strong notions he had got in his head, she said, of home, and of his friends. What he was able to speak was constantly on this topic. This I had never heard of before. ... He had talked in the same style, it seems, less or more, ever since he came into the hospital. I went immediately up to him, and introduced the subject; and from the alacrity with which he resumed it.. I found it a theme which much affected him. He asked me, with earnestness, if I would let him go home. I pointed out to him how unfit he was, from his weakness to undertake such a journey [he was a [[Welshman|Welchman]] ] till once he was better; but promised him, assuredly, without farther hesitation, that as soon as he was able he should have six weeks to go home. He revived at the very thought of it. ... His appetite soon mended; and I saw in less than a week, evident signs of recovery''.}}{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In the eighteenth century, scientists were looking for a locus of nostalgia, a nostalgic bone. By the 1850s nostalgia was losing its status as a particular disease and coming to be seen rather as a symptom or stage of a pathological process. It was considered as a form of [[melancholia]] and a predisposing condition among suicides.  Nostalgia was, however, still diagnosed among soldiers as late as the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Wisconsin Public Radio, ''To the Best of Our Knowledge'', "Svetlana Boym on Nostalgia", 2002 November 3&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1870s interest in nostalgia as a medical category had almost completely vanished. Nostalgia was still being recognized in both the [[World War I|First]] and [[World War II|Second]] World Wars, especially by the American armed forces. Great lengths were taken to study and understand the condition to stem the tide of troops leaving the front in droves (see the [[BBC]] documentary ''[[Century of the Self]]'').

Nostalgia is triggered by something reminding an individual of an event or item from their past. The resulting emotion can vary from [[happiness]] to [[sorrow (emotion)|sorrow]]. The term of "feeling nostalgic" is more commonly used to describe pleasurable emotions associated with and/or a longing to go back to a particular period of time, although the former may also be true.

===Romanticism===
Swiss nostalgia was linked to the singing of [[Kuhreihen]], which were forbidden to Swiss mercenaries because they led to ''nostalgia'' to the point of desertion, illness or death. The 1767 ''Dictionnaire de Musique'' by  [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] claims that Swiss mercenaries were threatened with severe punishment to prevent them from singing their Swiss songs. It became somewhat of a ''topos'' in Romantic literature, and figures in the poem ''Der Schweizer'' by [[Achim von Arnim]] (1805) and in [[Clemens Brentano]]'s ''Des Knaben Wunderhorn'' (1809) as well as in the opera ''Le Chalet'' by [[Adolphe Charles Adam]] (1834) which was performed for [[Queen Victoria]] under the title ''The Swiss Cottage''. The Romantic connection of ''nostalgia'', the ''Kuhreihen'' and the [[Swiss Alps]] was a significant factor in the enthusiasm for Switzerland, the development of early [[tourism in Switzerland]] and  [[Exploration of the High Alps|Alpinism]] that took hold of the European cultural elite in the 19th century. German Romanticism coined an opposite to ''Heimweh'', ''Fernweh'' "far-sickness," "longing to be far away," like ''[[wanderlust]]'' expressing the Romantic desire to travel and explore.

===Music===
Hearing an old song can bring back memories for a person. A song heard once at a specific moment and then not heard again until a far later date will give the listener a sense of nostalgia for the date remembered and events which occurred then.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt;

=== As an advertising tool ===
In [[Media (communication)|media]] and [[advertising]], nostalgia-evoking images, sounds, and references can be used strategically to create a sense of connectedness between consumers and products with the goal of convincing the public to consume, watch, or buy advertised products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mediated Nostalgia|last=Lizardi|first=Ryan|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2015|isbn=|location=maryland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern technology facilitates nostalgia-eliciting advertising through the subject, style, and design of an advertisement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Media and Nostalgia|last=Nieymar|first=K|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=978-1-137-37588-9|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feeling of longing for the past is easily communicated through social media and advertising because these media require the participation of multiple senses, are able to represent their ideas entirely, and therefore become more reminiscent of reality.

Due to efficient advertising schemes, consumers need not have experienced a specific event or moment in time in order to feel nostalgic for it. This is due to a phenomenon referred to as [[wikt:vicarious|vicarious]] nostalgia. Vicarious nostalgia is a feeling of [[Depression (mood)|wistful]] yearning for a moment that occurred prior to, or outside of, the span of one's memory, but is relatable (has sentimental value) due to repeated mediated exposure to it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merchant|first=A|date=2013|title=Effects of advertising evoked vicarious nostalgia in brand heritage|url=|journal=Journal or Business Research|volume=|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constant propagating of advertisements and other media messages makes vicarious nostalgia possible, and changes the ways we understand advertisements and subsequently, the way consumers use their purchasing power.

Examples of nostalgia used for provoking public interest include [https://doyouremember.com/72517/nostalgic-nostalgia-memories entertainment websites] like DoYouRemember, revamps of old movies or TV shows, or books. Vintage, rustic and old-fashioned design styles can also be seen in nostalgia-based ad campaigns that companies such as [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]] use.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In relation to [[psychology]], '''pair by association''' is the action of associating a stimulus with an arbitrary idea or object, eliciting a response, usually emotional. This is done by repeatedly pairing the stimulus with the arbitrary object.

For example, repeatedly pairing images of beautiful women in bathing suits elicits a sexual response in most men. Advertising agencies repeatedly pair products with attractive women in television commercials with the intention of eliciting an emotional or [[sexually aroused]] response in the consumer. This causes the consumer to be more likely to buy the product than when presented with a similar product without such an association.

==Hippocampus==
The [[Hippocampus|hippocampal area]], beyond its importance in [[episodic memory]] is in part responsible in the creation and storage of [[Association (psychology)|associations]] in the memory, especially for item associations.&lt;ref name="Madan et al" /&gt; Furthermore, as stated by Gilbert &amp; Kesner,&lt;ref name="Gilbert &amp; Kesner" /&gt; the associations that are created are those that might be ''“critical”'' in paired-associative learning. Through studies on rats, it has been found that lesions to the hippocampus lead to object-place associative learning impairments.&lt;ref name="Gilbert &amp; Kesner" /&gt; The findings of hippocampal damage that lead to [[Impaired|impairments]] in the association between object-place as Gilbert &amp; Kesner state have been seen in not only rodents but also non-human primates and humans {{harv|2004}}. It should be noted that previously learned associations made before the damage to the hippocampal area were not affected with impairment. Gilbert &amp; Kesner have suggested in their work that this ability to still recall previously stored associations may be due to modified synapses in an ''“auto associative network”''.&lt;ref name="Gilbert &amp; Kesner" /&gt;

==Pair by Association Task==
Paired association learning can be defined as a system of learning in which items (such as words, letters, numbers, symbols etc.) are matched so that presentation of one member of the pair will [[Recall (memory)#Cued recall|cue the recall]] of the other member.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Merriam-Webster's|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is this [[learning]] which constitutes the basics in a paired-associate task. These tasks can be divided into the following: visual-visual, verbal-verbal, and visual-verbal. In visual-visual both members of the pair are in a visual form (e.g. the picture of a blue circle paired with that of a picture of a yellow triangle). The verbal-verbal is when the members of the pair are both verbally presented (e.g. listening to the word cat followed by the word hat spoken to a participant). The last form, visual-verbal is when one member of the pair is spoken out loud while the other member is presented in a visual form (e.g. listening to the word box and seeing a picture of a house). It should be noted that visual [[Learning#Associative learning|associative learning]] has a positive association with age. In school age children, their visual association ability grows in conjunction with their age; younger children made more errors while older children made less.&lt;ref name="Harel et al" /&gt;
 
The paired association task broken down to its basics is: a stimuli, response, and the consequence of the cue association. This is best seen in a study where Naya, Sakai, &amp; Miyashita&lt;ref name="Naya et al" /&gt; performed one version of the task on monkeys. In the study a primate was given a visual-visual paired-associate task where they were shown all the pairs in the set. Then after a long delay they displayed one picture of a pair to the primate. When the correct picture was paired by the monkey, showing that the pictures were cueing the response, they were given rewards in the form of food.&lt;ref name="Naya et al" /&gt; What this study shows is that it is possible for associations to occur for two previously unrelated items. The monkeys showed they had actually remembered what was shown to them. In visual associative learning, the efficiency of the participant/subject in making these connections actually will decrease as the “memory load” increases.&lt;ref name="Harel et al" /&gt; The more items/the higher the complexity that one has to keep in their memory leads to poorer performance on paired associative learning tasks.
 
Gluck, Mercado, and Myers&lt;ref name="Gluck et al" /&gt; explain how paired-association is possibly tied to [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]] rather than [[Recall (memory)|retrieval]]. In the study presented by Gluck et al.,&lt;ref name="Gluck et al" /&gt; there was a paired associates test where after studying word pairs the participants were presented with one word from the pair and required to recall the match there was a noticeable difference in accuracy between the young adult and older adults. At the start of the study each pair was shown for 15 seconds, in this the older adults had much worse performance; their recall abilities paled in comparison to the younger adults. This however did change when the time was doubled to that of 30 seconds; here the elderly were able to have a much improved performance level. It is an accepted understanding that in associative learning there is a negative regression, as one ages their performance levels decrease.&lt;ref name="Lee et al" /&gt; The regression remains even after addressing the possible interfering variables such as attention or spatial memory.

===Performance on Task=== 
When the paired association task is performed, there are ways in which the performance in the task can be either negatively or positively affected. Associations suffer when an item is shared between associations; double function pairs such as AB and BC will be harder to recall later than control pairs such as AB and CD.&lt;ref name="Caplan et al" /&gt; As Caplan et al.,&lt;ref name="Caplan et al" /&gt; state double function pairs create what is called association ambiguity, a sharing of a common member in the pair, which leads to interference. The brain has difficulty in processing the pairs to the point that in some cases one pair will be remembered at the expense of the other pair. An example is in the two word pairs CAR-HORN and CAR-DOG. In this word pair a participant would remember 1 pair primarily while forgetting the other pair. Memory for ambiguous pairs will often suffer compared to unambiguous pairs in both situations of e.g. AB and BC or AB and AC.&lt;ref name="Caplan et al" /&gt; One matter that is not affected is a cue recall in either direction, forward (cue A, recall B) or backward (cue B, recall A); either direction will not affect the accuracy of the recall.&lt;ref name="Caplan et al" /&gt; This also holds true for double function pairs.
 
Additionally, there is ongoing research into the effects [[Ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]]/polystimulant use has on paired-associate task/learning. In a study by Gallagher et al.,&lt;ref name="Gallagher et al" /&gt; it was found that those who used ecstasy/polydrugs had in general more false positive responses, clicking yes (in agreement) when asked if a word pair had been previously presented even if the reality was false, compared to non-users. It was proposed that because creating the association between word pairs requires executive resources, which has been known to be hampered in ecstasy users. This is what has prevented the binding of word pairs.&lt;ref name="Gallagher et al" /&gt; However, as stated by the author, it is not possible to fully attribute these deficits in the task, but it bears noting that there are differences occurring.
 
An association can be improved with the aid of the production effect which is a finding where speaking a word out loud leads to enhancements in memory compared to reading a word silently.&lt;ref name="Putnam et al" /&gt; The production effect is not limited to speaking a word aloud; mouthing, writing, whispering, spelling, and typing all lead to an enhanced memory though the level will not be the same as reading aloud. In accordance with Putnam et al.,&lt;ref name="Putnam et al" /&gt; the enhancement in recall in the production effect is because reading aloud creates a more distinctive memory in the encoding process. Moreover, the production effect improved not only pair recognition but also paired-associate recall. These findings hint at a positive link between the production effect and the association between pairs in relation to paired-associate task/learning; using one of the elements in the production effect leads to improved encoding of associations.&lt;ref name="Putnam et al" /&gt;

==Verbal behavior==
[[Behaviorists]] will often use paired association tests to determine the strength of [[verbal behavior]], in particular, [[B.F Skinner]]'s concept of the verbal response class called intraverbals.&lt;ref name="Moran Verplanck" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6522">In [[mathematics]], a '''partition of unity''' of a [[topological space]] ''X'' is a set ''R'' of [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]]s from ''X'' to the [[unit interval]] [0,1] such that for every point, &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;,
* there is a [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhood]] of ''x'' where all but a [[finite set|finite]] number of the functions of ''R'' are 0, and
* the sum of all the function values at ''x'' is 1, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\;\sum_{\rho\in R} \rho(x) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Partition of unity illustration.svg|center|thumb|500px|A partition of unity of a circle with four functions. The circle is unrolled to a line segment (the bottom solid line) for graphing purposes. The dashed line on top is the sum of the functions in the partition.]]
Partitions of unity are useful because they often allow one to extend local constructions to the whole space.  They are also important in the [[interpolation]] of data, in [[signal processing]], and the theory of [[spline function]]s.

== Existence ==
The existence of partitions of unity assumes two distinct forms:

# Given any [[open cover]] {''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; of a space, there exists a partition {ρ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; indexed ''over the same set I'' such that [[Support (mathematics)|supp]] ρ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;⊆''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.  Such a partition is said to be '''subordinate to the open cover''' {''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.
# If the space is locally-compact, given any open cover {''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''i''∈''I''&lt;/sub&gt; of a space, there exists a partition {ρ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}&lt;sub&gt;''j''∈''J''&lt;/sub&gt; indexed over a possibly distinct index set ''J'' such that each ρ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; has [[compact support]] and for each ''j''∈''J'', supp ρ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;⊆''U''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for some ''i''∈''I''.

Thus one chooses either to have the [[support (mathematics)|supports]] indexed by the open cover, or compact supports.  If the space is [[compact space|compact]], then there exist partitions satisfying both requirements.

A finite open cover always has a continuous partition of unity subordinated to it, provided the space is locally compact and Hausdorff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rudin|first=Walter|title=Real and complex analysis|year=1987|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0-07-054234-1|pages=40|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Paracompact space|Paracompactness]] of the space is a necessary condition to guarantee the existence of a partition of unity [[paracompact space|subordinate to any open cover]].  Depending on the [[category (mathematics)|category]] to which the space belongs, it may also be a sufficient condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Charalambos D.|last=Aliprantis|first2=Kim C.|last2=Border
|title=Infinite dimensional analysis: a hitchhiker's guide
|year=2007|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-32696-0|pages=716|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The construction uses [[mollifier]]s (bump functions), which exist in continuous and [[smooth manifolds]], but not in [[analytic manifold]]s. Thus for an open cover of an analytic manifold, an analytic partition of unity subordinate to that open cover generally does not exist. ''See'' [[analytic continuation]].

If ''R'' and ''S'' are partitions of unity for spaces ''X'' and ''Y'', respectively, then the set of all pairwise products &lt;math&gt;\{\; \rho\sigma \;:\; \rho\in R \wedge \sigma \in S\;\}&lt;/math&gt; is a partition of unity for the [[cartesian product]] space ''X''×''Y''.

== Example ==
We can construct a partition of unity on &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; by looking at a chart on the complement of a point &lt;math&gt;p \in S^1&lt;/math&gt; sending &lt;math&gt;S^1 -\{p\}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with center &lt;math&gt;q \in S^1&lt;/math&gt;. Now, let &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; be a [[bump function]] on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; defined by&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Phi(x) = \begin{cases}
\exp\left(\frac{1}{x^2-1}\right) &amp; x \in (-1,1) \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;then, both this function and &lt;math&gt;1 - \Phi&lt;/math&gt; can be extended uniquely onto &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; by setting &lt;math&gt;\Phi(p) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the set &lt;math&gt;\{ (S^1 - \{p\}, \Phi), (S^1 - \{q\}, 1-\Phi) \}&lt;/math&gt;forms a partition of unity over &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Variant definitions==
Sometimes a less restrictive definition is used: the sum of all the function values at a particular point is only required to be positive, rather than 1, for each point in the space.  However, given such a set of functions, one can obtain a partition of unity in the strict sense by dividing every function by the sum of all functions (which is defined, since at any point it has only a finite number of terms).

==Applications==
A partition of unity can be used to define the integral (with respect to a [[volume form]]) of a function defined over a manifold: One first defines the integral of a function whose support is contained in a single coordinate patch of the manifold; then one uses a partition of unity to define the integral of an arbitrary function; finally one shows that the definition is independent of the chosen partition of unity.

A partition of unity can be used to show the existence of a [[Riemannian metric]] on an arbitrary manifold.

[[Method of steepest descent#The case of multiple non-degenerate saddle points|Method of steepest descent]] employs a partition of unity to construct asymptotics of integrals.

[[Linkwitz–Riley filter]] is an example of practical implementation of partition of unity to separate input signal into two output signals containing only high- or low-frequency components.

The [[Bernstein polynomial]]s of a fixed degree ''m'' are a family of ''m''+1 linearly independent polynomials that are a partition of unity for the unit interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10797">There have been several designs for a '''[[peace]] flag'''.

== The Peace Flag initiative ==
"The Peace Flag" is an initiative that aims to unify all nations underneath one common symbol on [[International Day of Peace|International Peace Day]].
While there are various icons of peace – the olive branch, the dove – there is no official world flag of peace adopted by the [[United Nations]]. That’s why this initiative has proposed that, for one day a year on 21 September, every country raises an all-white version of their national flag to represent that we are all one. In 2013, embassies of Colombia, Equatorial Guinea and Ecuador in London officially agreed to support The Peace Flag initiative by raising a colorless version of their respective flags on September 21. The initiative was nominated for a White Pencil in 2012 at [[D&amp;AD]] for its contribution towards peace, in support of Peace One Day.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

== White-bordered national flag ==
[[File:Peace to All Nations.jpg|thumb|left|White-bordered US flag. Banner reads "Peace to All Nations".]]
The [[white flag]] is recognized in most of the world as a flag of surrender, truce or ceasefire. The first mention of a white flag used in this context is made during the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25–220). A white flag was also used by the anti-war movement during the [[US Civil War]] in 1861.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7t_an-gkYa4C&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=%22Peace+Flag%22|title=The American Annual Cyclopedia and Register of Important Events of the Year|date=30 April 1864|publisher=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XS0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA230|title=Struggles and Triumphs: Or, Sixty Years' Recollections of P.T.

In 1891, the third [[Peace congress#Universal Peace Congress|Universal Peace Congress]] in Rome devised a generalized Peace Flag design, which was simply the home nation's flag bordered in white to signify non-violent conflict resolution. This was used (although not officially adopted) by the [[American Peace Society]]&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=btwBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq="Peace+Flag" US advocate of peace]''&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Universal Peace Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=09wBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA113|title=The Advocate of Peace|date=30 April 1894|publisher=American Peace Society|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by Henry Pettit.&lt;ref name="Devere Allen 1930. p.553"/&gt;

== The International Council of Women's banner ==
[[File:1904 Peace Flag.jpg|thumb|right|Button depicting the peace flag]]
In the 1890s, expatriate American Cora Slocomb di Brazza Savorgnan, the Countess Di Brazza, invented a universal peace flag with three upright bands: yellow, purple, and white, which became the peace flag of the [[International Peace Bureau]].&lt;ref name="Devere Allen 1930. p.553"&gt;Devere Allen, ed., The Fight for Peace (New York: Macmillan, 1930), 553, [https://www.questia.com/read/886957 ].&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, there was a complicated symbol on the middle band: "a shield ... surmounted by a man's and a woman's clasped hands, sustained by a pair of dove wings with a white star aloft; on the shield can appear any device chosen by the association adopting the flag, or simply the number of enrollment among the users of the flag, or the motto ''Pro Concordia Labor'' (For Peace I Work), or this motto may be placed upon a ribbon on the flag beneath the shield, or on a streamer (white) from the flag staff (blue, the color of promise) surmounted by a star with the motto of the association or individual using the flag upon the other white streamer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-IIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA315|title=History and Minutes of the National Council of Women of the United States, Organized in Washington, D.C., March 31, 1888|first=National Council of Women of the United|last=States|date=30 April 1898|publisher=E.B. Stillings|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This flag was adopted by the [[International Council of Women]] in 1896. In 1904, it lost the complicated design and became a simple tricolor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCqyJyiwW7MC&amp;pg=PA476|title=School Arts|date=30 April 2018|publisher=Davis Publications|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Earth flag ==
[[File:Peace Congress flag.svg|thumb|The Universal Peace Congress' world peace flag.]]
{{See also|Flag of the Earth}}
James William van Kirk, a Methodist minister from Youngstown (Ohio, USA), designed the first world peace [[flag of the Earth]], using rainbow stripes, stars and a globe. In 1913 and 1929, he made a peace tour through Europe with his flag.&lt;ref&gt;Corien Glaudemans, 'Een vredesapostel uit Ohio', in: ''Den Haag Centraal'', 16 oktober 2009; for pictures of James William van Kirk and his peace flag, see [http://www.haagsebeeldbank.nl/ Haagse Beeldbank; photocollection of the Municipal Archive of The Hague (the Netherlands)] nrs. 1.02811 and 5.12996.&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled around the world arguing for "the brotherhood of man and the Fatherhood of God".&lt;ref&gt;"How One Minister Paid His Way Round The World". ''The Western Christian Advocate''. C. Holliday and J.F. Wright, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universal Peace Congress eventually came to adopt Kirk's flag as its official World Peace Flag, and it was subsequently adopted by the American Peace Society as well as other groups. It consisted of "the earth on a blue field covered with white stars; a white band crossed the globe and to the left was broken up into a spectrum representing the variations of the human race — different, but united in peace".&lt;ref name="Devere Allen 1930. p.553"/&gt;

In 1938, Kirk authored an autobiography, ''Stranger than fiction : four times around the world, designer of world flag, a world builder, at 80 years makes a new start in life''.

== The Banner of Peace ==
{{main|Banner of Peace}}
[[File:Pax cultura.svg|thumb|140px|Banner of Peace sign]]
The ''banner of peace'' is a symbol of the [[Roerich Pact]]. This pact was the first international treaty dedicated to the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscbs.org/1935-roerich-pact.html Roerich Pact: Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments]&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed on April 15, 1935. The banner of peace was proposed by [[Nicholas Roerich]] for an international pact for the protection of culture values.

== The Rainbow flag ==
[[File:PACE-flag.svg|thumb|220px|The actual rainbow colors in the PACE flag ([[Italian language|Italian]] for '[[peace]]')]]
The most common recent design is a [[rainbow flag]] representing peace, first used in [[Italy]] at a [[peace march]] in 1961. The flag was inspired by similar multi-coloured flags used in demonstrations against [[nuclear weapon]]s. A previous version had featured a dove drawn by [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elettrosmog.com/bandieradellapace.htm|title=La vera storia della bandiera della pace - Notizie storiche sulla  bandiera della Pace, la bandiera Arcobaleno della Pace|first=|last=A.E.|website=www.elettrosmog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common variety has seven colours — [[purple]], [[blue]], [[azure (color)|azure]], [[green]], [[yellow]], [[orange (color)|orange]], and [[red]] — and is emblazoned in bold with the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''PACE'', meaning "peace".

It became popular with the ''Pace da tutti i balconi'' ("peace from every balcony") campaign in 2002, started as a protest against the impending war in the world. The flag was flown from balconies in all Italian [[city|cities]] by citizens against the war. Its use spread to other countries too, and the Italian ''Pace'' was sometimes, but not everywhere, replaced with the corresponding translation in the local languages.

According to [[Amnesty International]], producer [[Franco Belsito]] had produced about 1,000 flags per year for 18 years, and suddenly had to cope with a demand in the range of the millions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnesty.no/aktuelt/flere-nyheter/arkiv-reportasjer/det-nytter-1 'Det nytter!'], Amnesty International Norway&lt;/ref&gt;

Common variations include moving the purple stripe down below the azure one, and adding a white stripe on top.

The seven-color peace flag is not to be confused with the similar six-color [[Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|gay pride flag]], which does not have [[azure (color)|azure]] (it has [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]]) and the colors are in opposite order: with red at the top.

[[Robert A. Heinlein]], in his 1947 short story ''[[The Green Hills of Earth]]'', referred to "Terra's [Earth's] rainbow banner".

=== The largest peace flag ===
[[File:MegaPeaceFlag.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Large peace flag in Lecce, 14 November 2009]]
The first large peace flag was made in [[Lecce]], [[Salento]], Italy by the association "GPace - Youth for peace" on Saturday, 14 November 2009. It was 21 m wide and 40 m long. Three years later this record was broken. On September the 21st 2012 the Belgian Peace Organisation [http://www.vrede.be/ Vrede vzw], Vredeshuis Ghent and five city schools unfolded the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VzXEtQN8x4 worlds largest peace flag] (30 m wide and 50 m long) in the historic center of [[Ghent]]. The action aimed to reinforce the demand to disarm in order to make room for sustainable development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1337">The '''Plebanski tensor''' is a [[tensor order|order 4 tensor]] in [[general relativity]] constructed from the [[trace-free Ricci tensor]].  It was first defined by [[Jerzy Plebański]] in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=J.|last1=Plebański|title=The Algebraic structure of the Tensor of Matter|journal=Acta Phys. Pol.|volume=26|page=963|year=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;S_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; be the trace-free Ricci tensor:

:&lt;math&gt;S_{ab}=R_{ab}-\frac{1}{4}Rg_{ab}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the Plebanski tensor is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;P^{ab}{}_{cd}=S^{[a}{}_{[c}S^{b]}{}_{d]}+\delta^{[a}{}_{[c}S^{b]e}S_{d]e}-\frac{1}{6}\delta^{[a}{}_{[c}\delta^{b]}{}_{d]}S^{ef}S_{ef}.&lt;/math&gt;

The advantage of the Plebanski tensor is that it shares the same symmetries as the [[Weyl tensor]].  It therefore becomes possible to classify different [[spacetime]]s based on additional algebraic symmetries of the Plebanski tensor in a manner analogous to the [[Petrov classification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16319">'''Realistic conflict theory''' (initialized '''RCT'''), also known as '''realistic group conflict theory''' (initialized '''RGCT'''),&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; is a [[social psychology|social psychological]] model of [[group conflict|intergroup conflict]].&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt; The theory explains how intergroup hostility can arise as a result of conflicting goals and competition over limited resources, and it also offers an explanation for the feelings of [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] toward the [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroup]] that accompany the intergroup hostility.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name=W&amp;K /&gt; Groups may be in competition for a real or perceived [[scarcity]] of resources such as money, political power, military protection, or social status.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt; 

Feelings of resentment can arise in the situation that the groups see the competition over resources as having a [[zero-sum game|zero-sums fate]], in which only one group is the winner (obtained the needed or wanted resources) and the other loses (unable to obtain the limited resource due to the "winning" group achieving the limited resource first).&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;  The length and severity of the conflict is based upon the perceived value and shortage of the given resource.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt; According to RCT, positive relations can only be restored if [[superordinate goals]] are in place.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;

== Concept ==

=== History ===
The theory was officially named by [[Donald T. Campbell|Donald Campbell]], but has been articulated by others since the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt;  In the 1960s, this theory developed from Campbell's recognition of social psychologists' tendency to reduce all human behavior to [[hedonism|hedonistic goals]]. He criticized psychologists like [[John Thibaut]], [[Harold Kelley]], and [[George C. Homans|George Homans]], who emphasized theories that place food, sex, and pain avoidance as central to all human processes. According to Campbell, hedonistic assumptions do not adequately explain intergroup relations.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; Campbell believed that these [[social exchange theory|social exchange theorists]] oversimplified human behavior by likening interpersonal interaction to animal behavior.&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt; Similar to the ideas of Campbell, other researchers also began recognizing a problem in the psychological understanding of intergroup behavior.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;  These researchers noted that prior to Campbell, social exchange theorists ignored the essence of social psychology and the importance of interchanges between groups.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966"/&gt; To the contrary of prior theories, RCT takes into account the sources of conflict between groups,  which include, incompatible goals and competition over limited resources.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell /&gt;

===Supportive research===

==== Robbers cave study ====

The 1954 Robbers Cave Experiment by [[Muzafer Sherif]] and [[Carolyn Wood Sherif]] represents one of the most widely known demonstrations of RCT.&lt;ref name="W&amp;K"/&gt; The Sherifs' study was conducted over three weeks in a 200-acre summer camp in [[Robbers Cave State Park]], [[Oklahoma]], focusing on intergroup behavior.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt; In this study, researchers posed as camp personnel, observing 22 eleven- and twelve-year-old boys who had never previously met and had comparable backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;

The experiment was divided into three stages. The first stage being "[[ingroup]] formation", in which upon arrival the boys were split into two approximately equal groups based on similarities. Each group was unaware of the other group's presence. The second stage was the "friction phase", wherein the groups were entered in competition with one another in various camp games.  Valued prizes were awarded to the winners. This caused both groups to develop negative attitudes and behaviors towards the [[outgroup (sociology)|outgroup]]. The third and final stage was the "integration stage". During this stage, tensions between the groups were reduced through teamwork-driven tasks that required intergroup cooperation.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;

The Sherifs made several conclusions based on the three-stage Robbers Cave Experiment.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; From the study, he determined that because the groups were created to be approximately equal, individual differences are not necessary or responsible for intergroup conflict to occur.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; As seen in the study when the boys were competing in camp games for valued prizes, Sherif noted that hostile and aggressive attitudes toward an outgroup arise when groups compete for resources that only one group can attain.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; Sherif also establishes that contact with an outgroup is insufficient, by itself, to reduce negative attitudes.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt; Finally, he concludes that friction between groups can be reduced along with positive intergroup relations maintained, only in the presence of superordinate goals that promote united, cooperative action.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1961" /&gt;

However a further review of the Robber's Cave Experiments, which were in fact a series of three separate experiments carried out by the Sherifs and colleagues reveals additional deliberations. In two earlier studies the boys ganged up on a common enemy, and in fact on occasion ganged up on the experimenters themselves showing an awareness of being manipulated.&lt;ref name="Cherry" /&gt; In addition, Michael Billig argues that in addition to the two groups of boys, the experimenters themselves form a third group, and one that is arguably the most powerful of the three and that they in fact become the outgroup themselves in the aforementioned experiment.&lt;ref name="Billig" /&gt; 

[[Lutfy Diab]] repeated the experiment with 18 boys from Beirut. The 'Blue Ghost' and 'Red Genies' groups each contained 5 Christians and 4 Muslims. Fighting soon broke out, not Christian vs Muslim but Blue vs Red. &lt;ref&gt; Us and Them, [[David Berreby]], Hutchinson 2006, p178 &lt;/ref&gt;

== Extensions and applications ==

===Implications for diversity and integration===
RCT offers an explanation for negative attitudes toward [[racial integration]] and efforts to promote diversity.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bobo"/&gt; This is illustrated in the data collected from the [[American National Election Studies|Michigan National Election Studies]] survey. According to the survey, most whites held negative attitudes toward school districts' attempts to integrate schools via [[Desegregation busing in the United States|school busing in the 1970s]].  In these surveys, there was a general perceived threat that whites had of African Americans.&lt;ref name="Bobo"/&gt; It can be concluded that, contempt towards racial integration was due to a perception of blacks as a danger to valued lifestyles, goals, and resources, rather than [[symbolic racism]] or prejudice attitudes formulated during childhood.&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bobo /&gt;

RCT can also provide an explanation for why competition over limited resources in communities can present potentially harmful consequences in establishing successful [[Diversity (business)|organizational diversity]].&lt;ref name="Brief"/&gt; In the workplace, this is depicted by the concept that increased racial [[heterogeneity]] among employees is associated with job dissatisfaction among majority members.&lt;ref name="Brief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsui"/&gt; Since organizations are affixed in the communities to which their employees belong, the racial makeup of employees' communities affect attitudes toward diversity in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott"/&gt; As racial heterogeneity increases in a white community, white employees are less accepting of workplace diversity.&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt; RCT provides an explanation of this pattern because in communities of mixed races, members of minority groups are seen as competing for economic security, power, and prestige with the majority group.

RCT can help explain discrimination against different ethnic and racial groups.&lt;ref name="Esses"/&gt; An example of this is shown in [[cross-cultural studies]] that determined that violence between different groups escalates in relationship to shortages in resources.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=Esses /&gt;  When a group have a notion that resources are limited and only available for possession by one group, this leads to attempts to remove the source of competition.&lt;ref name=Esses /&gt; Groups can attempt to remove their competition by increasing their groups capabilities (e.g. skill training), decreasing the abilities of the outgroups competition (e.g. expressing negative attitudes or applying punitive [[tariffs]]), or by decreasing proximity to the outgroup (e.g. denying immigrant access).&lt;ref name=Jackson /&gt;&lt;ref name=Esses /&gt;

===An extension to unequal groups===
Realistic conflict theory originally only described the results of competition between two groups of equal status.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name="Duckitt"/&gt; John Duckitt suggests that the theory be expanded to include competition between groups of unequal status. To demonstrate this, Duckitt created a scheme of types of realistic conflict with groups of unequal status and their resulting correlation with prejudice.&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt;

Duckitt concluded that there are at least two types of conflict based on ingroups competition with an outgroup.&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; The first is 'competition with an equal group' and is explained by realistic conflict theory.&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; Thus being, group-based threat that leads ingroup members to feel hostile towards the outgroup which can lead to conflict as the ingroup focuses on acquiring the threatened resource.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sedanius"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; The second type of conflict is 'domination of the outgroup by the ingroup'. This occurs when the ingroup and outgroup do not have equal status. If domination occurs, there are two responses the subordinate group may have. One is stable oppression, in which the subordinate group accepts the dominating group's attitudes on some focal issue and sometimes, the dominant group's deeper values to avoid further conflict. The second response that may occur is unstable oppression. This occurs when the subordinate group rejects the lower status forced upon them, and sees the dominating group as oppressive. The dominant group then may view the subordinates' challenge as either justified or unjustified. If it is seen as unjustified, the dominant group will likely respond to the subordinates' rebellion with hostility. If the subordinates' rebellion is viewed as justified, the subordinates are given the power to demand change.&lt;ref name=Duckitt /&gt; An example of this would be the eventual recognition of the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s in the United States.&lt;ref name="Sherif, 1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prejudice"/&gt;

===An extension to nations===
When group conflict extends to nations or tribes, regality theory argues that the collective danger leads citizens to start having strong feelings of national or tribal identity, preferring strong, hierarchical political system, adopting strict discipline and punishment of deviants, and expressing xenophobia and strict religious and sexual morality&lt;ref name=Fog2017&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fog |first1=Agner |date=2017 |title=Warlike and Peaceful Societies: The Interaction of Genes and Culture |url=https://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/657 |publisher=Open Book Publishers |isbn=978-1-78374-403-9 |doi=10.11647/OBP.0128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In experiments, subjects judged variations of sayings which did and did not rhyme, and tended to evaluate those that rhymed as more truthful (controlled for meaning). For example, the statement "What sobriety conceals, alcohol reveals" was judged to be more accurate than by different participants who saw "What sobriety conceals, alcohol unmasks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGlone|first=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5157">The '''Robin Hood effect''' is an [[economic]] occurrence where [[income]] is [[income redistribution|redistributed]] so that [[economic inequality]] is reduced.  The effect is named after [[Robin Hood]], said to have stolen from the rich to give to the poor.

==Causes of a Robin Hood effect==

A Robin Hood effect can be caused by a large number of different policies or economic decisions, not all of which are specifically aimed at reducing inequality.  This article lists only some of these.

===Natural national development===

[[Image:Kuznets curve.png|right|320px|thumb|A Kuznets curve]]

{{main|Kuznets curve}}

[[Simon Kuznets]] argued that one major factor behind levels of economic inequality is the stage of [[economic development]] of a country. Kuznets described a curve-like relationship between level of income and inequality, as shown. That theory prescribes that countries with very low levels of development will have relatively equal distributions of wealth.

As a country develops, it necessarily acquires more capital, and the owners of this capital will then have more wealth and income, which introduces inequality. However, eventually various possible redistribution mechanisms such as [[trickle down effect]]s and [[social welfare]] programs will lead to a Robin Hood effect, with wealth redistributed to the poor.  Therefore, more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality.

===Non-proportional income tax===

Many countries have an [[income tax]] system where the first part of a worker's salary is taxed very little or not at all, while those on higher salaries must pay a higher tax rate on earnings over a certain threshold, known as [[progressive taxation]]. This has the effect of the better-off population paying a higher proportion of their salary in tax, effectively subsidising the less-well off, leading to a Robin Hood effect.

Specifically, a progressive tax is a [[tax]] by which the [[tax rate]] increases as the taxable base amount increases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Progressive Webster] (4b): increasing in rate as the base increases (a progressive tax)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/69/P0586900.html American Heritage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209142138/http://bartleby.com/61/69/P0586900.html |date=2009-02-09 }} (6). Increasing in rate as the taxable amount increases.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-375969.html Britannica Concise Encyclopedia]: Tax levied at a rate that increases as the quantity subject to taxation increases.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Progressive+tax Princeton University WordNet]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}: (n) progressive tax (any tax in which the rate increases as the amount subject to taxation increases)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sommerfeld"&gt;Sommerfeld, Ray M., Silvia A. Madeo, Kenneth E. Anderson, Betty R. Jackson (1992), ''Concepts of Taxation'', Dryden Press: Fort Worth, TX&lt;/ref&gt; "Progressive" describes a distribution effect on [[income]] or [[Consumption (economics)|expenditure]], referring to the way the rate progresses from low to high, where the average tax rate is less than the marginal tax rate.&lt;ref name="Hyman"&gt;Hyman, David M. (1990) ''Public Finance: A Contemporary Application of Theory to Policy'', 3rd, Dryden Press: Chicago, IL&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James, Simon (1998) ''A Dictionary of Taxation'', Edgar Elgar Publishing Limited: Northampton, MA&lt;/ref&gt; It can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole; a year, multi-year, or lifetime. Progressive taxes attempt to reduce the [[tax incidence]] of people with a lower [[wikt:ability-to-pay|ability-to-pay]], as they shift the incidence increasingly to those with a higher ability-to-pay.

===Cross-subsidisation of mobile telephony===

In many developing countries, [[cellular network|mobile communications networks]] tend to experience a large [[network effect|network externality]], which regulators and operators seek to correct by subsidising subscriptions through increased prices for [[call termination]]. That then allows the less-well off in that country to gain access to communications services, often for free (on a [[prepaid mobile phone|prepay tariff]]). The additional cost is then levied on subscribers who make calls to these new subscribers; the call originators tend to be better-off. Therefore, despite there being no direct transfer of money, there is a strong Robin Hood effect, with the better-off subsidising the less well-off.

'''Sandra Bundy''' is best known for her part in landmark case ''[[Bundy v. Jackson]]'', which was the first [[United States courts of appeals|federal appeals court]] case to hold that workplace sexual harassment was employment discrimination and a violation of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacKinnon|first=Catherine|date=March 2002|title=The Logic of Experience: Reflections on the Development of Sexual Harassment Law|journal=Georgetown Law Journal|volume=90|pages=813–833}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/03/04/hertoo-40-years-ago-this-woman-helped-make-sexual-harassment-illegal-sandra-bundy/|title=#HerToo: 40 Years Ago This Woman Helped Make Sexual Harassment Illegal|date=2018-03-04|work=Washingtonian|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Sandra Bundy was born on March 12, 1934 and grew up in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, D.C]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her father left the family when she was still a child. She has said she believes a lack of a father figure may have contributed to her problems with relationships later in life. She graduated in 1952 from Armstrong Technical, a D.C. public high school that is now closed. Bundy studied for two years at the (now) [[University of the District of Columbia]], but did not complete her degree.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bundy was married five times. Two of her husbands beat her, giving her concussions. She had five children, though one daughter died as a toddler after a neighborhood boy lit the 3-year-old's dress on fire with matches. None of her children's fathers stayed in Bundy's life or paid child support.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bundy participated in the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights movement]] in the 1960s, including attending marches. She also started a union supporting an end to racial segregation in the workforce.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wBPD1vvTCYC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22sandra+bundy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjHopy5x6naAhVRS6wKHZA-D8sQ6AEISDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sandra%20bundy%22&amp;f=false|title=The Women's Movement Against Sexual Harassment|last=Baker|first=Carrie N.|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9780521879354|location=|pages=78-80|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, Bundy worked as a [[United States Department of Commerce|U.S. Department of Commerce]] clerk during the day, and as a grocery store cashier at night, but was still having major financial problems and filed for bankruptcy. Her boss at the U.S. Department of Commerce said she couldn't receive any more promotions because she lacked a college degree and she decided to find a new job.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Harassment at Department of Corrections ===
Bundy, then a single mother of four children, joined the city government believing it offered opportunities for advancement and was hired by the [[District of Columbia Department of Corrections]] (DCDC) in 1970. She earned a yearly salary of $10,500, which was more than twice the starting salary of her old job, and was able to quit her second job as a night cashier. She was promoted several times and became a vocational rehabilitation specialist and helped former inmates find jobs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bundy alleges that four supervisors sexually harassed her between 1972-1975, including Arthur Burton, James Gainey, Lawrence Swain and Delbert Jackson.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RzRL8f_Wlf4C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=%22Sandra+Bundy%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Zl8LUuN-MC&amp;sig=KOoK4Du_GDt4li73UDStyU_rtsg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd_pqDxqnaAhVSiqwKHeaLBkY4FBDoAQguMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Sandra%20Bundy%22&amp;f=false|title=Hostile Environment: The Political Betrayal of Sexually Harassed Women|last=Mink|first=Gwendolyn|date=2000|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=|isbn=0801436443|location=|pages=58-60|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her supervisor Arthur Burton began making sexual comments about her in 1974, and asked her several times to leave work and go home with him, though Bundy said no every time. One time Burton called Bundy's home in the evening, though her number was unlisted, and then hung up on her when she refused to meet with him.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

After a time, Bundy's former colleague James Gainey became her new supervisor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He began doing things in the office that made her uncomfortable, like patting her buttocks and calling her “fine Momma.” He once invited her on a vacation, which she refused. He often asked her to sleep with him, and once said, "I’ve got a pocketful of money. Let’s take the afternoon off to a motel and lay up." She said no to each of his advances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bundy's supervisors regularly criticized her for taking too much time off and poor work performance, though she had never received such criticisms before rejecting their advances. At one point, Gainey threatened to fire her. Bundy later learned she’d been overlooked for a promotion while her male colleagues had moved up or been recommended. When she complained to her supervisors' superior Lawrence Swain, he told her that "any man in his right mind would want to rape you."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/sexual-harassment-law-was-shaped-by-the-battles-of-black-women/|title=Sexual Harassment Law Was Shaped by the Battles of Black Women|last=Lipsitz|first=Raina|date=2017-10-20|work=The Nation|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US|issn=0027-8378}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next time she complained to him, he ignored her complaints and asked if she was dating anyone, adding, “Because if not, I want to take you to bed myself.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Bundy v. Jackson|court=D.C.Cir.|reporter=F.2d|vol=641|opinion=934|pinpoint=940|date=1981|url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/641/934/25673/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the advice of a female colleague, she began keeping a diary and recording each incident.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bundy began having trouble sleeping, and lost weight. She often cried and once contemplated suicide. She started seeing a psychiatrist, and was prescribed medication for anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Years earlier, a colleague named Delbert Jackson had made several unsuccessful passes at Bundy and tried to get her to drink with him (she didn't drink), but when he was promoted to director of the DCDC she got desperate and went to him for help in April 1975. However, he and other boardmembers refused to concede she had a case.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 

Bundy sought help from the [[Equal Employment Opportunity]] officers at the DCDC, but they cautioned her against bringing unwarranted complaints. Bundy's black co-workers criticized her for bringing forth the suit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, Bundy filed an informal and then a formal complaint. 

=== ''Bundy v. Jackson'' case ===
When no action was taken, Bundy met with lawyer Robert Adler, who agreed to take on the case even though there was no legal precedent and Bundy didn't have much money to offer. Bundy filed suit in 1977 in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] seeking [[Declaratory judgment|declaratory]] and [[Injunction|injunctive relief]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.colorlines.com/articles/3-things-you-should-know-about-workplace-sexual-harassment-suit-pioneer-sandra-bundy|title=3 Things You Should Know About Workplace Sexual Harassment Suit Pioneer Sandra Bundy|last=Rao|first=Sameer|date=2018-03-19|work=Colorlines|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Bundy v.

The temptation resisted might be to indulge in pleasures when one should not (e.g., to indulge in a romantic fling if you are married or to eat sweets if you are trying to lose weight), to overindulge, or to stray from the straight and narrow (e.g., to cheat or steal). Or the temptation might be to impulsively react (e.g., reflexively striking back at someone who has hurt your feelings) or to do or take what you want without regard for social norms (e.g., butting in line or grabbing another child’s toy).&lt;br /&gt;Another aspect of self-control is having the discipline to stay on task despite distractions and completing a task despite temptations to give up, to move on to more interesting work, or to have a good time instead. This involves making yourself do something or keep at something though you would rather be doing something else. It is related to the final aspect of self-control—delaying gratification (Mischel et al. 1989)—making yourself forgo an immediate pleasure for a greater reward later (often termed delay discounting by neuroscientists and learning theorists; Louie &amp; Glimcher 2010, Rachlin et al. 1991). Without the discipline to complete what one started and delay gratification, no one would ever complete a long, time-consuming task such as writing a dissertation, running a marathon, or starting a new business.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[executive function]], self-control is a cognitive process that is necessary for regulating one's behavior in order to achieve specific [[goal]]s.&lt;ref name="Executive functions" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Timpano  |first1=K.

A related concept in [[psychology]] is [[emotional self-regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Burman| first1 = J. T. | last2 = Green | first2 = C.

Self-control is also a key concept in the [[General Theory of Crime|general theory of crime]], a major theory in [[criminology]]. The theory was developed by [[Michael R. Gottfredson|Michael Gottfredson]] and [[Travis Hirschi]] in their book titled ''A General Theory of Crime'', published in 1990. Gottfredson and Hirschi define self-control as the differential tendency of individuals to avoid criminal acts independent of the situations in which they find themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A General Theory of Crime|last=Gottfredson|first=Michael|last2=Hirschi|first2=Travis|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with low self-control tend to be impulsive, insensitive towards others, risk takers, short-sighted, and nonverbal. The general theory of crime holds that self-control is established in early childhood through three major factors: the strength of the parent-to-child emotional bond, adequate supervision by parents, parents' ability to recognize punishable behavior, and appropriate discipline by parents.

==Research==

===Counteractive===

Desire is an affectively charged motivation toward a certain object, person, or activity, but not limited to, that associated with pleasure or relief from displeasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kavanagh |first1= D.J. |last2= Andrade |first2= J. |last3=May |first3=J. |title= Imaginary relish and exquisite torture: The elaborated intrusion theory of desire |journal= Psychological Review |year=2005 |volume=112 |issue= 2 |pages= 446–467 |doi= 10.1037/0033-295x.112.2.446 |pmid= 15783293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desires vary in strength and duration. A desire becomes a temptation when it impacts or enters the individual's area of self-control, if the behavior resulting from the desire conflicts with an individual’s values or other self-regulatory goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hofmann |first1=W. |last2=Baumeister |first2=R.F. |last3=Forster |first3=G. |last4= Vohs |first4=K.D. |title= Everyday temptations: An experience sampling study on desire, conflict, and self-control |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year=2012 |volume= 102 |issue=6 |pages= 1318–1335 |doi= 10.1037/a0026545 |pmid= 22149456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hofmann |first1= W. |last2= Van Dillen |first2= L. |year=2012 |title= Desire: The new hot spot in self-control research |url = |journal= Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume= 21 |issue=5 |pages= 317–322 |doi= 10.1177/0963721412453587 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A limitation to research on desire is the issue of individuals desiring different things. New research looked at what people desire in real world settings. Over one week, 7,827 self-reports of desires were collected and indicated significant differences in desire frequency and strength, degree of conflict between desires and other goals, and the likelihood of resisting desire and success of the resistance. The most common and strongly experienced desires are those related to bodily needs like eating, drinking, and sleeping.&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofmann|first1=W.|last2=Vohs |first2= K.D. |last3=Baumeister |first3= R.F. |title=What people desire, feel conflicted about, and try to resist in everyday life|journal=Psychological Science|year=2012|volume=23|issue=6|pages=582–588|doi=10.1177/0956797612437426|pmid=22547657}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study has many implications related to self-control and the everyday things that interfere with people’s ability to stay on task. This is a big reason why self-control is considered to be a public speaker's worst nightmare.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, Daniel (1998). "Working with Emotional Intelligence", p. 73. Bantam Books, New York.  {{ISBN|0553378589}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Desires that conflict with overarching goals or values are known as temptations.&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofmann | first1 = W. | last2 = Baumesiter | first2 = R.F. | last3 = Forster | first3 = G. | last4 = Vohs | first4 = K.D. | year = 2012 | title = Everyday temptations: An experience sampling study of desire, conflict, and self-control | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 102 | issue = 6| pages = 1318–1335 | doi=10.1037/a0026545| pmid = 22149456 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-control dilemmas occur when long-term goals and values clash with short-term temptations. Counteractive Self-Control Theory states that when presented with such a dilemma, we lessen the significance of the instant rewards while momentarily increasing the importance of our overall values. When asked to rate the perceived appeal of different snacks before making a decision, people valued health bars over chocolate bars. However, when asked to do the rankings after having chosen a snack, there was no significant difference of appeal. Further, when college students completed a questionnaire prior to their course registration deadline, they ranked leisure activities as less important and enjoyable than when they filled out the survey after the deadline passed. The stronger and more available the temptation is, the harsher the devaluation will be.&lt;ref name="Myrseth, K. O. R. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Myrseth | first1 = K. O. R. | last2 = Fishbach | first2 = A. | last3 = Trope | first3 = Y. | year = 2009 | title = Counteractive self-control: When making temptation available makes temptation less tempting | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 2| pages = 159–163 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02268.x | pmid = 19170939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fishbach, A. 2008 pp. 281-294"&gt;Fishbach, A., &amp; Trope, Y (2008).

One of the most common self-control dilemmas involves the desire for unhealthy or unneeded food consumption versus the desire to maintain long-term health. An indication of unneeded food could also be over expenditure on certain types of consumption such as eating away from home. Not knowing how much to spend, or overspending one’s budget on eating out can be an symptom of a lack of self control.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, A. (2017). Self-Rationing Efficiency of Repeated Eating-Out Expenses: Does Experience Matter?. Journal of Hospitality &amp; Tourism Research, 41(3), 259-277.&lt;/ref&gt; Experiment participants rated a new snack as significantly less healthy when it was described as very tasty compared to when they heard it was just slightly tasty. Without knowing anything else about a food, the mere suggestion of good taste triggers counteractive self-control and prompted them to devalue the temptation in the name of health. Further, when presented with the strong temptation of one large bowl of chips, participants both perceived the chips to be higher in calories and ate less of them than did participants who faced the weak temptation of three smaller chip bowls, even though both conditions represented the same amount of chips overall. Weak temptations are falsely perceived to be less unhealthy, so self-control is not triggered and desirable actions are more often engaged in, supporting the counteractive self-control theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kroese | first1 = M.F. | last2 = Evers | first2 = C. | last3 = de Ridder | first3 = T.D. | year = 2013 | title = If it's good it must be bad: The indirect effect of temptation strength on self-control through perceived unhealthiness | url = | journal = Eating Behaviors | volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = 522–524 | doi=10.1016/j.eatbeh.2013.07.006| pmid = 24183149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Weak temptations present more of a challenge to overcome than strong temptations, because they appear less likely to compromise long-term values.&lt;ref name="Myrseth, K. O. R. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fishbach, A. 2008 pp. 281-294"/&gt;

===Satiation===
The decrease in an individual's liking of and desire for a substance following repeated consumption of that substance is known as satiation. Satiation rates when eating depend on interactions of trait self-control and healthiness of the food. After eating equal amounts of either clearly healthy (raisins and peanuts) or unhealthy (M&amp;Ms and Skittles) snack foods, people who scored higher on trait self-control tests reported feeling significantly less desire to eat more of the unhealthy foods than they did the healthy foods. Those with low trait self-control satiated at the same pace regardless of health value. Further, when reading a description emphasizing the sweet flavor of their snack, participants with higher trait self-control reported a decrease in desire faster than they did after hearing a description of the healthy benefits of their snack. Once again, those with low self-control satiated at the same rate regardless of health condition. Perceived unhealthiness of the food alone, regardless of actual health level, relates to faster satiation, but only for people with high trait self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Redden | first1 = J.P. | last2 = Haws | first2 = K.L. | year = 2013 | title = Healthy satiation: The role of decreasing desire in effective self-control | url = | journal = Journal of Consumer Research | volume = 39 | issue = 5| pages = 1100–1114 | doi=10.1086/667362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construal levels===
Thinking that is characterized by high [[construals]], whenever individuals "are obliged to infer additional details of content, context, or meaning in the actions and outcomes that unfold around them",&lt;ref name = Ross&gt;Ross, L. (1987). The Problem of Construal in Social Inference and Social Psychology. In N. Grunberg, R.E. Nisbett, J. Singer (eds), ''A Distinctive Approach to psychological research: the influence of Stanley Schacter''. Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; will view goals and values in a global, abstract sense.  Whereas low level construals emphasize concrete, definitive ideas and categorizations. Different construal levels determine our activation of self-control in response to temptations. One technique for inducing high-level construals is asking an individual a series of "why?" questions that will lead to increasingly abstracted responses, whereas low-level construals are induced by "how?" questions leading to increasingly concrete answers. When taking an [[Implicit Association Test]], people with induced high-level construals are significantly faster at associating temptations (such as candy bars) with "bad," and healthy choices (such as apples) with "good" than those in the low-level condition.  Further, higher-level construals also show a significantly increased likelihood of choosing an apple for snack over a candy bar. Without any conscious or active self-control efforts, temptations can be dampened by merely inducing high-level construals. It is suggested that the abstraction of high-level construals reminds people of their overall, lifelong values, such as a healthy lifestyle, which deemphasizes the current tempting situation.&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fujita | first1 = K. | last2 = Han | first2 = H. | year = 2009 | title = Moving Beyond Deliberative Control of Impulses: The Effect of Construal Levels on Evaluative Associations in Self-Control Conflicts | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 20 | issue = 7| pages = 799–804 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02372.x | pmid = 19493322 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human and non-human===
Positive correlation between [[language|linguistic capability]] and self-control has been inferred from experiments with [[common chimpanzee]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boysen ST |author2=Berntson GG |title=Responses to quantity: perceptual versus cognitive mechanisms in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) |journal=Journal of experimental psychology. Animal behavior processes |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=82–6 |year=1995 |pmid=7844508 |doi=10.1037/0097-7403.21.1.82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Beran MJ |author2=Savage-Rumbaugh ES |author3=Pate JL |author4=Rumbaugh DM |title=Delay of gratification in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) |journal=Developmental Psychobiology |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=119–276 |year=1999 |pmid=10086230 |doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-2302(199903)34:2&lt;119::aid-dev5&gt;3.0.co;2-p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human self-control research is typically  modeled by using a [[token economy]] system. A token economy system is a behavioral program in which individuals in a group can earn tokens for a variety of desirable behaviors and can cash in the tokens for various backup, [[positive reinforcer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Martin G. |author2=Pear J.  |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2011 | title = Behavior modification: What it is and how to do it| page = 305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference in research methodologies with humans - using tokens or conditioned reinforcers versus non-humans using sub-primary forces suggested procedural artifacts as a possible suspect. One aspect of these procedural differences was the delay to the exchange period (Hyten et al. 1994).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hyten C., Madden G. J., Field D. P. | year = 1994 | title = Exchange delays and impulsive choice in adult humans | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 62 | issue = 2| pages = 225–233 | doi=10.1901/jeab.1994.62-225| pmid = 7964366 | last2 = Madden | last3 = Field | pmc=1334459}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-human subjects can and most likely would access their reinforcement immediately. The human subjects had to wait for an "exchange period" in which they could exchange their tokens for money, usually at the end of the experiment. When this was done with the non-human subjects, in the form of pigeons, they responded much like humans in that males showed much less control than females.  (Jackson &amp; Hackenberg 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jackson K., Hackenberg T. D. | year = 1996 | title = Token reinforcement, choice, and self-control in pigeons | url = | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 66 | issue = 1| pages = 29–49 | doi=10.1901/jeab.1996.66-29| pmid = 8755699 | pmc = 1284552 | last2 = Hackenberg }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Logue, (1995), who is discussed more below, points out that in her study done on self-control it was male children who responded with less self-control than female children.  She then states, that in adulthood, for the most part, the sexes equalize on their ability to exhibit self-control. This could imply a human's ability to exert more self-control as they mature and become aware of the consequences associated with impulsivity. This suggestion is further examined below.

Most of the research in the field of self-control assumes that self-control is in general better than [[impulsiveness]]. As a result, almost all research done on this topic is from this standpoint and very rarely is impulsiveness the more adaptive response in experimental design.

Self-control is a measurable variable in humans. In the worst circumstances people with the most or high self-control and resilience have the best odds of defying the odds they are faced with, which could be poverty, bad schooling, unsafe communities, etc. Those at a disadvantage with high self-control go on to higher education and professional jobs, but this seems to have a negative effect on their health.

When looking at people who come from advantage backgrounds with high self-control, we see a different phenomenon happening. Those who come from an advantaged background tend to be high-achieving and with their achievement comes good health. The psychological phenomenon known as “[[John Henryism]]” posits that when goal-oriented, success-minded people strive ceaselessly in the absence of adequate support and resources, they can—like the mighty 19th-century folk legend who fell dead of an aneurysm after besting a steam-powered drill in a railroad-spike-driving competition—work themselves to death. Or, at least, toward it. In the 1980s Sherman James a socio-epidemiologist from North Carolina found that black Americans in the state suffered disproportionately from heart disease and strokes. He too landed on "John Henryism" as the cause of this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamblin|first1=James|title=The Paradox of Effort|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/07/the-health-cost-of-upward-mobility/398486/|website=The Atlantic|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently some in the field of developmental psychology have begun to think of self-control in a more complicated way that takes into account that sometimes impulsiveness is the more adaptive response. In their view, a normal individual should have the capacity to be either impulsive or controlled depending on which is the most adaptive. However, this is a recent shift in paradigm and there is little research conducted along these lines.&lt;ref name="Logue1995"&gt;Logue, A.W. (1995).  Self-Control: Waiting Until Tomorrow For What You Want Today.  Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

== Skinner's survey of techniques ==

[[B.F. Skinner]]'s ''Science and Human Behavior'' provides a survey of nine categories of self-control methods.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical restraint and physical aid ===

The manipulation of the environment to make some responses easier to physically execute and others more difficult illustrate this principle. This can be referred to as physical guidance which is the application of physical contact to induce an individual to go through the motions of a desired behavior. This concept can also be referred to as a physical prompt.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Martin G. |author2=Pear J.  |last-author-amp=yes | year =2011 | title= Behavior modification: What it is and how to do it| page=305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of this include clapping one’s hand over one’s own mouth, placing one’s hand in one’s pocket to prevent fidgeting, and using a ‘bridge’ hand position to steady a pool shot all represent physical methods to affect behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changing the stimulus ===

Manipulating the occasion for behavior may change behavior as well. Removing distractions that induce undesired actions or adding a prompt to induce it are examples. Hiding temptation and reminders are two more.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; The need to hide temptation is a result of its effect on the mind. A common theme among studies of desire is an investigation of the underlying cognitive processes of a craving for an addictive substance, such as nicotine or alcohol. In order to better understand the cognitive processes involved, the Elaborated Intrusion (EI) theory of craving was developed. According to the EI theory, craving persists because individuals develop mental images of the coveted substance that are instantly pleasurable, but which also increase their awareness of deficit.&lt;ref name="May 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |last=May |first=Jon |last2=Andrade |first2=Jackie |last3=Panabokke |first3=Nathalie |last4=Kavanagh |first4=David |title=Images of desire: Cognitive models of craving |journal=Memory |date=July 2004 |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=447–461 |doi=10.1080/09658210444000061 |pmid=15493072}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hofmann |first=W. |last2=Van Dillen |first2=L. |title=Desire: The New Hot Spot in Self-Control Research |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |year=2012 |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=317–322 |doi=10.1177/0963721412453587}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a cruel circle of desire, imagery, and preparation to satisfy the desire. This quickly escalates into greater expression of the imagery that incorporates working memory, interferes with performance on simultaneous cognitive tasks, and strengthens the emotional response. Essentially the mind is consumed by the craving for a desired substance, and this craving in turn interrupts any concurrent cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="May 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt; Obviously a craving for nicotine or alcohol is an extreme case, but nevertheless the EI theory holds true for more normal motivations and desires.

=== Depriving and satiating ===
Deprivation is the time in which an individual does not receive a reinforcer, while satiation occurs when an individual has received a reinforcer to such a degree that it will temporarily have no reinforcing power over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Martin G. |author2=Pear J.  |last-author-amp=yes | year = 2011 | title = Behavior modification: What it is and how to do it | page = 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If we deprive ourselves of a stimulus, the value of that reinforcement increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | author = O'Donohue, W., Ferguson, e. K., | year = 2001| title = The Psychology of BF Skinner | page = 174 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if an individual has been deprived of food, they may go to extreme measures to get that food, such as stealing. On the other hand, when we have an exceeding amount of a reinforcer, that reinforcement loses its value; if an individual eats a large meal, they may no longer be enticed by the reinforcement of dessert.

One may manipulate one's own behavior by affecting states of deprivation or satiation. By skipping a meal before a free dinner one may more effectively capitalize on the free meal. By eating a healthy snack beforehand the temptation to eat free "junk food" is reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

Also noteworthy is the importance of imagery in desire cognition during a state of deprivation. A study conducted on this topic involved smokers divided into two groups. The control group was instructed to continue smoking as usual until they arrived at the laboratory, where they were then asked to read a multisensory neutral script, meaning it was not related to a craving for nicotine. The experimental group, however, was asked to abstain from smoking before coming to the laboratory in order to induce craving and upon their arrival were told to read a multisensory urge-induction script intended to intensify their nicotine craving.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kavanagh 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kavanagh|first=David J.|author2=Andrade, Jackie |author3=May, Jon |title=Imaginary Relish and Exquisite Torture: The Elaborated Intrusion Theory of Desire|journal=Psychological Review|year=2005|volume=112|issue=2|pages=446–467|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.112.2.446|pmid=15783293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the participants finished reading the script they rated their craving for cigarettes. Next they formulated visual or auditory images when prompted with verbal cues such as "a game of tennis" or "a telephone ringing." After this task the participants again rated their craving for cigarettes. The study found that the craving experienced by the abstaining smokers was decreased to the control group's level by visual imagery but not by auditory imagery alone.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kavanagh 2005" /&gt; That mental imagery served to reduce the level of craving in smokers illustrates that it can be used as a method of self-control during times of deprivation.

=== Manipulating emotional conditions ===

We manipulate emotional conditions in order to induce certain ways of responding.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{ cite book | author = O'Donohue, W., Ferguson. E. K., | year = 2001 | title= The Psychology of BF Skinner| page=305 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this can be seen in theatre. Actors often elicit tears from painful memories if it is necessary for the character they are playing. This idea is similar to the notion if we read a letter, book, listen to music, watch a movie, in order to get us in the "mood" so we can be in the proper state of mind for a certain event or function.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Additionally, treating an activity as "work" or "fun" can have an effect on the difficulty of self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/656576 |title=Work or Fun? How Task Construal and Completion Influence Regulatory Behavior |year=2011 |last1=Laran |first1=Juliano |last2=Janiszewski |first2=Chris |journal=The Journal of Consumer Research |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=967–983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to analyze the possible effects of the cognitive transformation of an object on desire, a study was conducted based on a well-known German chocolate product. The study involved 71 undergraduate students, all of whom were familiar with the chocolate product. The participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the control condition, the consummatory condition, and the nonconsummatory transformation condition.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hofmann |first1=Wilhelm |last2=Deutsch |first2=Roland |last3=Lancaster |first3=Katie |last4= Banaji |first4=Mahzarin R. |title=Cooling the heat of temptation: Mental self-control and the automatic evaluation of tempting stimuli |journal=European Journal of Social Psychology |year=2010 |issue=40 |pages=17–25 |doi=10.1002/ejsp.708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each group was then given three minutes to complete their assigned task. The participants in the control condition were told to read a neutral article about a location in South America that was devoid of any words associated with food consumption. Those in the consummatory condition were instructed to imagine as clearly as possible how consuming the chocolate would taste and feel. The participants in the nonconsummatory transformation condition were told to imagine as clearly as possible odd settings or uses for the chocolate. Next, all the participants underwent a manipulation task that required them to rate their mood on a five-point scale in response to ten items they viewed. Following the manipulation task, participants completed automatic evaluations that measured their reaction time to six different images of the chocolate, each of which was paired with a positive or a negative stimuli. The results showed that the participants instructed to imagine the consumption of the chocolate demonstrated higher automatic evaluations toward the chocolate than did the participants told to imagine odd settings or uses for the chocolate, and participants in the control condition fell in-between the two experimental conditions.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2010" /&gt; This indicates that the manner in which one considers an item influences how much it is desired.

=== Using aversive stimulation ===

Aversive stimulation is used as a means of increasing or decreasing the likelihood of target behavior.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Similar to all methods of self-management,  there is a controlling response, and a controlled response. An averse stimuli is sometimes referred to as a punisher or simply an aversive.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Closely related to the idea of a punisher is the concept of punishment. Punishment is the idea that in a given situation, someone does something that is immediately followed by a punisher, then that person is less likely to do the same thing again when she or he next encounters a similar situation. An example of this can be seen when a teenage stays out past curfew. After staying out past curfew the teenagers parents ground the teenager. Because the teenager has been punished for his or her behavior he or she is less likely to stay out past their curfew again, thus decreasing the likelihood of the target behavior.

=== Drugs ===

Certain types of drugs affect self-controls. Stimulants, such as [[methylphenidate]] and [[amphetamine]], improve [[inhibitory control]] in general and are used to treat ADHD.&lt;ref name="Unambiguous PFC D1 A2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spencer RC, Devilbiss DM, Berridge CW | title = The Cognition-Enhancing Effects of Psychostimulants Involve Direct Action in the Prefrontal Cortex | journal = Biol.

Surprisingly, despite nearly 80 years of clinical use, the neurobiology of the procognitive actions of psychostimulants has only recently been systematically investigated. Findings from this research unambiguously demonstrate that the cognition-enhancing effects of psychostimulants involve the preferential elevation of catecholamines in the PFC and the subsequent activation of norepinephrine α2 and dopamine D1 receptors.&amp;nbsp;... This differential modulation of PFC-dependent processes across dose appears to be associated with the differential involvement of noradrenergic α2 versus α1 receptors. Collectively, this evidence indicates that at low, clinically relevant doses, psychostimulants are devoid of the behavioral and neurochemical actions that define this class of drugs and instead act largely as cognitive enhancers (improving PFC-dependent function). This information has potentially important clinical implications as well as relevance for public health policy regarding the widespread clinical use of psychostimulants and for the development of novel pharmacologic treatments for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and other conditions associated with PFC dysregulation.&amp;nbsp;... In particular, in both animals and humans, lower doses maximally improve performance in tests of working memory and response inhibition, whereas maximal suppression of overt behavior and facilitation of attentional processes occurs at higher doses. | pmc=4377121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cognitive and motivational effects"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ilieva IP, Hook CJ, Farah MJ | title = Prescription Stimulants' Effects on Healthy Inhibitory Control, Working Memory, and Episodic Memory: A Meta-analysis | journal = J.

=== Operant conditioning ===

[[Operant conditioning]] sometimes referred to as Skinnerian conditioning is the process of strengthening a behavior by reinforcing it or weakening it by punishing it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; By continually strengthening and reinforcing a behavior, or weakening and punishing a behavior an association as well as a consequence is made. Similarly, a behavior that is altered by its consequences is known as operant behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Martin G. |author2=Pear J.  |last-author-amp=yes | year =2011 | title= Behavior modification: What it is and how to do it }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are multiple components of operant conditioning; these include reinforcement such as positive reinforcers and negative reinforcers. A positive reinforcer is a stimulus which, when presented immediately following a behavior, causes the behavior to increase in frequency. Negative reinforcers are a stimulus whose removal immediately after a response cause the response to be strengthened or to increase in frequency. Additionally, components of punishment are also incorporated such as [[positive punishment]] and negative punishment.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Examples of operant conditioning can be seen every day. When a student tells a joke to one of his peers and they all laugh at this joke, this student is more likely to continue this behavior of telling jokes because his joke was reinforced by the sound of their laughing. However, if a peer tells the student his joke is "silly" or "stupid", he will be punished by telling the joke and his likelihood to tell another joke is greatly decreased. Another example of operant conditioning can be seen in the form of quitting a habit such as smoking. By using this technique to quit smoking, self-discipline must be displayed as the smoker must stop giving into their addiction.

=== Punishment ===

Self-punishment of responses would include the arranging of punishment contingent upon undesired responses. This might be seen in the behavior of whipping oneself which some monks and religious persons do. This is different from aversive stimulation in that, for example, the alarm clock generates escape from the alarm, while self-punishment presents stimulation after the fact to reduce the probability of future behavior.&lt;ref name="Skinner237"&gt;Skinner, B.F. Science and Human Behavior, Chapter XV p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

Punishment is more like conformity than self-control because with self-control there needs to be an internal drive, not an external source of punishment that makes the person want to do something. There is external locus of control which is similar to determinism and there is internal locus of control which is similar to free will. With a learning system of punishment the person does not make their decision based upon what they want, rather they base it on the external factors. When you use a negative reinforcement you are more likely to influence their internal decisions and allow them to make the choice on their own whereas with a punishment the person will make their decisions based upon the consequences and not exert self-control. The best way to learn self-control is with free will where people are able to perceive they are making their own choices.&lt;ref&gt;Logue, Self Control: Waiting Until Tomorrow For What You Want Today 34-77&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Doing something else" ===

Skinner noted that various philosophies and religions exemplified this principle by instructing believers to love their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Walden Two 1948&lt;/ref&gt; When we are filled with rage or hatred we might control ourselves by 'doing something else' or more specifically something that is incompatible with our response.

==Brain regions involved==
[[Functional imaging]] of the brain has shown that self-control is correlated with an area in the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] (dlPFC), a part of the [[frontal lobe]].  This area is distinct from those involved in generating intentional actions, attention to intentions, or select between alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/reprint/27/34/9141 | pmid = 17715350 | doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0924-07.2007 | volume=27 | issue=34 | title=To do or not to do: the neural signature of self-control |date=August 2007 | journal=J. Neurosci. | pages=9141–5 | author=Brass M, Haggard P| last2 = Haggard }}&lt;/ref&gt; This control occurs through the  top-down inhibition of [[premotor cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kühn | first1 = S | last2 = Haggard | first2 = P | last3 = Brass | first3 = M | year = 2009 | title = Intentional inhibition: How the "veto-area" exerts control | url = | journal = Hum Brain Mapp. | volume = 30 | issue = 9| pages = 2834–2843 | doi = 10.1002/hbm.20711 | pmid = 19072994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate about the mechanism of self-control and how it emerges. Traditionally, researchers believed the bottom-up approach guided self-control behavior. The more time a person spends thinking about a rewarding stimulus, the more likely he or she will experience a desire for it. Information that is most important gains control of working memory, and can then be processed through a top-down mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=B.T.|author2=D'Esposito, M.|title=Searching for "the top" in top-down control|journal=Neuron|year=2005|volume=48|pages=535–538|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.11.002|pmid=16301170|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knudsen|first=E.I.|title=Fundamental components of attention|journal=Annual Review of Neuroscience|year=2007|volume=30|pages=57–78|doi=10.1146/annurev.neuro.30.051606.094256|pmid=17417935}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing evidence suggests that top down processing plays a strong role in self-control. Specifically, top-down processing can actually regulate bottom-up attentional mechanisms. To demonstrate this, researchers studied working memory and distraction by presenting participants with neutral or negative pictures and then a math problem or no task. They found that participants reported less negative moods after solving the math problem compared to the no task group, which was due to an influence on working memory capacity.&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Dillen|first=L.F.|author2=Koole, S.L. |title=Clearing the mind: A working memory model distraction from negative mood|journal=Emotion|year=2007|volume=7|issue=4|pages=715–723|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.7.4.715|pmid=18039038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many researchers working on identifying the brain areas involved in the exertion of self-control; many different areas are known to be involved. In relation to self-control mechanisms, the reward centers in the brain compare external stimuli versus internal need states and a person’s learning history.&lt;ref name="Hofmann, W. 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hofmann|first=W.|author2=Friese, M. |author3=Strack, F. |title=Impulse and self-control from a dual-systems perspective|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|year=2009|volume=4|issue=2|pages=162–176|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2009.01116.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the biological level, a loss of control is thought to be caused by a malfunctioning of a decision mechanism. A mechanistic explanation of self-control is still in its infancy. However, there is strong demand for knowledge about these mechanism because knowledge of these mechanisms would have tremendous clinical application.
Much of the work on how the brain reaches decisions is based on evidence from perceptual learning.

Many of the tasks that subjects are tested on are not tasks typically associated with self-control, but are more general decision tasks. Nevertheless, the research on self-control is informed by more general research on decision tasks. Sources for evidence on the neural mechanisms of self-control include fMRI studies on human subject, neural recordings on animals, lesion studies on humans and animals, and clinical behavioral studies on humans with self-control disorders.

There is broad agreement that the cortex is involved in self-control. The details of the final model have yet to be worked out. However, there are some enticing findings that suggest a mechanistic account of self-control could prove to have tremendous explanatory value. What follows is a survey of some of the important recent literature on the brain regions involved in self-control.

===Prefrontal cortex===

The prefrontal cortex is located in the most anterior portion of the frontal lobe in the brain. It forms a larger portion of the cortex in humans. The dendrites in the prefrontal cortex contain up to 16 times as many dendritic spines as neurons in other cortical areas. Due to this, the prefrontal cortex integrates a large amount of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | author = Kalat, J. W. | year =2013 | title= Biological Psychology| page=104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[orbitofrontal cortex]] cells are important factors for self-control. If an individual has the choice between an immediate reward or a more valuable reward which they can receive later, an individual would most likely try to control the impulse to take that immediate reward. If an individual has a damaged orbitofrontal cortex, this impulse control will most likely not be as strong, and they may be more likely to take the immediate reinforcement. Additionally, we see lack of impulse control in children because the prefrontal cortex develops slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Kalat, J. W. | year =2013 | title= Biological Psychology| page=406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd A. Hare ''et al.'' use functional MRI techniques to show that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) are crucially involved in the exertion of self-control. They found that activity in the vmPFC was correlated with goal values and that the exertion of self-control required the modulation of the vmPFC by the DLPFC. The study found that a lack of self-control was strongly correlated with reduced activity in the DLPFC. Hare’s study is especially relevant to the self-control literature because it suggests that an important cause of poor self-control is a defective DLPFC.&lt;ref name="Hare 2009"&gt;{{cite journal |pages=646–8 |doi=10.1126/science.1168450 |title=Self-Control in Decision-Making Involves Modulation of the vmPFC Valuation System |year=2009 |last1=Hare |first1=T. A. |last2=Camerer |first2=C. F. |last3=Rangel |first3=A. |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5927 |pmid=19407204|bibcode=2009Sci...324..646H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outcomes as determining whether a choice is made===

[[Alexandra W. Logue]] is interested in how outcomes change the possibilities of a self-control choice being made.  Logue identifies three possible outcome effects: outcome delays, outcome size, and outcome contingencies.&lt;ref name="Logue1995"/&gt;  The delay of an outcome results in the perception that the outcome is less valuable than an outcome which is more readily achieved. The devaluing of the delayed outcome can cause less self-control.  A way to increase self-control in situations of a delayed outcome is to pre-expose an outcome. Pre-exposure reduces the frustrations related to the delay of the outcome. An example of this is signing bonuses.

Outcome size deals with the relative, perceived size of possible outcomes.  There tends to be a relationship between the value of the incentive and the desired outcome; the larger the desired outcome, the larger the value.  Some factors that decrease value include delay, effort/cost, and uncertainty. The decision tends to be based on the option with the higher value at the time of the decision.

Finally, Logue defines the relationship between responses and outcomes as outcome contingencies.&lt;ref name="Logue1995"/&gt;  Outcome contingencies also impact the degree of self-control that a person exercises.  For instance, if a person is able to change his choice after the initial choice is made, the person is far more likely to take the impulsive, rather than self-controlled, choice.  Additionally, it is possible for people to make precommitment action.  A precommitment action is an action meant to lead to a self-controlled action at a later period in time.  When a person sets an alarm clock, they are making a precommitted response to wake up early in the morning.  Hence, that person is more likely to exercise the self-controlled decision to wake up, rather than to fall back in bed for a little more sleep.

[[Cassandra B. Whyte]] studied [[locus of control]] and academic performance and determined that internals tend to achieve at a higher level.  Internals may perceive they have options from which to choose, thus facilitating more hopeful decision-making behavior as opposed to dependence on externally determined outcomes that require less commitment, effort, or self-control.&lt;ref&gt;Whyte, Cassandra B., (1975) A Specific Study of the Effects of Three Modes of Counseling on the Academic Achievement and Internal External Locus of Control of High-Risk College Freshmen. Dissertation Abstracts,.48106. 36 (4).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whyte | first1 = Cassandra Bolyard | year = 1978 | title = Effective Counseling Methods for High-Risk College Freshmen | url = | journal = Measurement and Evaluation in Guidance | volume = 6 | issue = 4| pages = 198–200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiology of behavior===

Many things affect one's ability to exert self-control, but it seems that self-control requires sufficient [[glucose]] levels in the brain. Exerting self-control depletes glucose. Reduced glucose, and poor glucose tolerance (reduced ability to transport glucose to the brain) are correlated with lower performance in tests of self-control, particularly in difficult new situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | author=Gailliot MT, Baumeister RF | title=The physiology of willpower: linking blood glucose to self-control | journal=Pers Soc Psychol Rev | year=2007 | volume=11 | issue=4 | pages=303–27 | pmid=18453466 | url=http://carlo-hamalainen.net/stuff/Gailliot%20Baumeister%20-%20The%20physiology%20of%20willpower:%20linking%20blood%20glucose%20to%20self-control.pdf | doi=10.1177/1088868307303030 | last2=Baumeister | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628195739/http://carlo-hamalainen.net/stuff/Gailliot%20Baumeister%20-%20The%20physiology%20of%20willpower%3A%20linking%20blood%20glucose%20to%20self-control.pdf | archivedate=2013-06-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-control demands that an individual work to overcome thoughts, emotions, and automatic responses/impulses. These strong efforts require higher blood glucose levels. Lower blood glucose levels can lead to unsuccessful self-control abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal| author = Gailliot M.T., Baumeister R.F., DeWall C.

Furthermore, failure of self-control occurs most likely during times of the day when glucose is used least effectively. Self-control thus appears highly susceptible to glucose.&lt;ref name=GailliotBaumeister2007&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gailliot MT, Baumeister RF | title=The physiology of willpower: linking blood glucose to self-control | journal=Pers Soc Psychol Rev | year=2007 | volume=11 | issue=4 | pages=303–27 | pmid=18453466 | url=http://carlo-hamalainen.net/stuff/Gailliot%20Baumeister%20-%20The%20physiology%20of%20willpower:%20linking%20blood%20glucose%20to%20self-control.pdf | doi=10.1177/1088868307303030 | last2=Baumeister | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628195739/http://carlo-hamalainen.net/stuff/Gailliot%20Baumeister%20-%20The%20physiology%20of%20willpower%3A%20linking%20blood%20glucose%20to%20self-control.pdf | archivedate=2013-06-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative explanation of the limited amounts of glucose that are found is that this depends on the allocation of glucose, not on limited supply of glucose. According to this theory, the brain has sufficient resources of glucose and also has the possibility of delivering the glucose, but the personal priorities and motivations of the individual cause the glucose to be allocated to other sites. This theory has not been tested yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beedie|first=Christopher|author2=Andrew M.

== The Mischel Experiments ==
In the 1960s, [[Walter Mischel]] tested four-year-old children for self-control in "The Marshmallow Test": the children were each given a [[marshmallow]] and told that they can eat it anytime they want, but if they waited 15 minutes, they would receive another marshmallow. Follow up studies showed that the results correlated well with these children's success levels in later life.&lt;ref&gt;Mischel, W., Shoda, Yth the members of the original study whom he was able to find. His reported results appear to show that the life-expectancy of the group was more strongly correlated with their assessed self-control level than anything else&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reported in the book "The Attitude Factor" by Thomas Blakeslee&lt;/ref&gt;

A strategy used in the marshmallow test was the focus on "hot" and "cool" features of an object. The children were encouraged to think about the marshmallow's "cool features" such as its shape and texture, possibly comparing it to a cotton ball or a cloud. The "hot features" of the marshmallow would be its sweet, sticky tastiness. These hot features make it more difficult to delay gratification. By focusing on the cool features, the mind is adverted from the appealing aspects of the marshmallow, and self-control is more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Casey |first=B.J |title=Behavioral and neural correlates of delay of gratification 40 years later |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=May 28, 2011 |volume=108 |issue=36 |pages=14998–5003 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1108561108 |pmid=21876169 |last2=Somerville |first2=L.

Years later Dr. Mischel reached out to the participants of his study who were then in their 40's. He found that those who showed less self-control by taking the single marshmallow in the initial study were more likely to develop problems with relationships, stress, and drug abuse later in life. Dr. Mischel carried out the experiment again with the same participants in order to see which parts of the brain were active during the process of self-control. The participants received scans through M.R.I to show brain activity. The results showed that those who exhibited lower levels of self-control had higher brain activity in the ventral striatum, the area that deals with positive rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cohen |first=Patricia |title=At the Vortex of Self-Control: [The Arts/Cultural Desk] |newspaper=The New York Times |date=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews concluded that self-control is correlated with various positive life outcomes, such as happiness, adjustment and various positive psychological factors.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  Self-control was also negatively correlated with [[sociotropy]]&lt;ref name="sato-2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Sato | first1 = T. | last2 = Harman | first2 = B.

== Ego depletion ==
{{main article|Ego depletion}}

There's conflicting evidence about whether will power is finite, infinite or self-reinforcing resource, a phenomenon sometimes termed ego depletion or reverse ego depletion &lt;ref&gt;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/14/strongest-evidence-yet-for-ego-depletion-the-idea-that-self-control-is-a-limited-resource/&lt;/ref&gt;. However, belief that will-power is infinite &lt;ref&gt;journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797610384745&lt;/ref&gt; or self-reinforcing &lt;ref&gt;https://digest.bps.org.uk/2017/12/14/strongest-evidence-yet-for-ego-depletion-the-idea-that-self-control-is-a-limited-resource/&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with greater will power, voluntary executive function.

Exerting self-control through the [[executive functions]] in [[decision making]] is held in some theories to [[ego depletion|deplete]] one's ability to do so in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vohs KD, Baumeister RF, Schmeichel BJ, Twenge JM, Nelson NM, Tice DM |title=Making choices impairs subsequent self-control: a limited-resource account of decision making, f-regulation, and active initiative |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=94 |issue=5 |pages=883–98 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18444745 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.5.883 |url=http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/psp945883.pdf|format=PDF|last2=Baumeister |last3=Schmeichel |last4=Twenge |last5=Nelson |last6=Tice }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ego depletion is the view that high self-control requires energy and focus, and over an extended period of self-control demands, this self-control can lessen. There are ways to help this ego depletion. One way is through rest and relaxation from these high demands. Additionally, training self-control with certain behaviors can also help to strengthen an individual’s self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author = Hagger M.S., Wood C., Stiff C., Chatzisarantis N.L. | title = Ego depletion and the strength model of self control: A meta-analysis |journal = Psychological Bulletin |volume = 136| issue = 4 | pages = 495–525 | year=2010 | doi = 10.1037/a0019486 | url = http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=e1c32b5b-858d-4cd4-88de-266f63ddb869%40sessionmgr114&amp;hid=112&amp;bdata=JkF1dGhUeXBlPWNvb2tpZSxpcCxjcGlkJmN1c3RpZD1zODQxOTIzOSZzaXRlPWVob3N0LWxpdmU%3d#db=pdh&amp;AN=2010-12718-004 | pmid=20565167| last2 = Wood | last3 = Stiff | last4 = Chatzisarantis }}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be particularly effective in those who would otherwise have difficulty controlling their impulses in the domain of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |author =Denson, T.F., Capper, M.

One study in particular analyzed the impact of approaching a temptation by defining it in abstract, general terms as opposed to specific, concrete details. For the purposes of the study, approaching a situation using general terms was defined as the high-level construal condition whereas using specific details was termed the low-level construal condition.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fujita 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fujita|first=Kentaro|author2=Trope, Yaacov |author3=Liberman, Nira |author4= Levin-Sagi, Maya |title=Construal levels and self-control|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=90|issue=3|pages=351–367|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.3.351|pmid=16594824 |pmc=3153425}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study involved 42 college students who were randomly assigned to either the high-level or low-level construal condition. The participants were then presented with a packet that described five scenarios, each one involving a unique self-control conflict. For those participants in the high-level construal condition the scenarios were described using only general terms and for those in the low-level construal condition the scenarios were described using only specific details. After imagining themselves in each scenario, the participants were asked to indicate how bad they would feel if they indulged in the temptation using a six-point scale ranging from "not at all bad" to "very bad." The data showed that participants in the high-level construal condition reported greater negative evaluations of temptations than did participants in the low-level construal conditions.&lt;ref name="Hofmann 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fujita 2006" /&gt; This implies that individuals using high-level construals are better able to place a temptation in context and properly evaluate its long-term impact, and therefore are more likely to maintain self-control.

== Kelly McGonigal's approach ==

[[Kelly McGonigal]] defines willpower as "the ability to do what you really want to do when part of you really doesn’t want to do it." It consists of three competing elements: 1) I will – the ability to do what you need to do; 2) I won’t – the other side of self-control; the ability to resist temptation; and 3) I want – your true want, the ability to remember the big picture of your life.&lt;ref name="McGonigal, K. 2012"&gt;McGonigal, K. (2012). The willpower instinct: How self-control works, why it matters and what you can do to get more of it.  New York: Avery.&lt;/ref&gt; Willpower is a resource that gets depleted, particularly when you are rundown or hungry. However, you may increase your capacity for willpower by engaging in activities such as mindfulness, meditation and exercise and/or by ensuring good nutrition and adequate sleep.&lt;ref name="McGonigal, K. 2012"/&gt;

&lt;!--Hidden because it sounds ridiculous to most people except maybe lawyers, who can rephrase this legalese better to say that sexual assault is of course an offense in all countries despite being defined differently in different countries and at different times: In legal terms, sexual assault is a [[statutory]] offense in various jurisdictions, including the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[England and Wales]], [[Ireland]], and [[Scotland]]. The legal definition of the crime of sexual assault is determined by each [[jurisdiction]]. Specific legal jurisdictions and research often use highly technical or detailed definitions of the term.--&gt;

== Definition ==
Generally, sexual assault is defined as unwanted sexual contact. The [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] defines sexual assault as "unwanted sexual contact that stops short of rape or attempted rape. This includes sexual touching and fondling."&lt;ref name="RAINN" /&gt;

The National Center for Victims of Crime states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/dna-resource-center/sexual-assault-kit-backlog-reduction/about-sexual-assault#1 |title=The National Center for Victims of Crime – Library/Document Viewer |publisher=Ncvc.org |accessdate=9 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720051156/http://www.victimsofcrime.org/our-programs/dna-resource-center/sexual-assault-kit-backlog-reduction/about-sexual-assault#1 |archivedate=20 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Sexual assault takes many forms including attacks such as rape or attempted rape, as well as any unwanted sexual contact or threats. Usually a sexual assault occurs when someone touches any part of another person's body in a sexual way, even through clothes, without that person's consent.}}

In the [[United States]], the definition of sexual assault varies widely among the individual states. However, in most states sexual assault occurs when there is lack of consent from one of the individuals involved. Consent must take place between two adults who are not incapacitated and can change during any time during the sexual act.

Studies have shown that the psychological damage is particularly severe when sexual assault is committed by parents against children due to the incestuous nature of the assault.&lt;ref name="Courtois" /&gt; Incest between a child or adolescent and a related adult has been identified as the most widespread form of child sexual abuse with a huge capacity for damage to a child.&lt;ref name="Courtois" /&gt; Often, sexual assault on a child is not reported by the child for several of the following reasons:

*children are too young to recognize their victimization or put it into words
*they were threatened or bribed by the abuser
*they feel confused by fearing the abuser
*they are afraid no one will believe them
*they blame themselves or believe the abuse is a punishment

=== Domestic violence ===
{{Main|Domestic violence}}
Domestic violence is a crime of power and intimidation. It is strongly correlated with sexual assault. Not only can domestic abuse be emotional, physical, psychological and financial, but it can be sexual. Some of the signs of sexual abuse are similar to those of domestic violence.&lt;ref name=womensaidfederationofengland&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womensaid.org.uk/domestic_violence_topic.asp?section=0001000100220022&amp;item |title=Sexual Violence |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123718/http://www.womensaid.org.uk/domestic_violence_topic.asp?section=0001000100220022&amp;item |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elderly sexual assault ===
{{Main|Elder abuse}}
Elderly sexual assault is [[victimization]] of persons over the age of 60, most of whom suffer from decreased functionality, frailty and weakness, and therefore are reliant on caretakers. Only 30 percent of people age 65 or older who are victimized report the assault to the police. The most common assailants are caretakers, adult children, spouses and fellow facility residents.
Signs that an elder is being assaulted include increased vaginal tearing, bleeding, bruising, infection, pelvic injury, soft tissue or bone injury. Also, an altered mood might be an indication of sexual assault. These symptoms include extreme agitation, post-traumatic stress disorder, withdrawal, panic attacks, STDs, exacerbation of existing illness, sleep disturbances and longer recovery times.&lt;ref name="pcar.org" /&gt;

=== Groping ===
{{Main|Groping}}
The term ''groping'' is used to define the touching or fondling of another person in a sexual way without the person's consent. Groping may occur under or over clothing.

=== Rape ===
{{Main|Rape}}

Outside of law, the term rape, "an [[assault]] by a person involving [[sexual intercourse]] with another person without that person's [[consent]]", is often used interchangeably with sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Victimology: Theories and Applications"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roberts, Albert R. |author2=Ann Wolbert Bergess |author3=CHERYL REGEHR |title=Victimology: Theories and Applications |publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers |location=Sudbury, Mass |year=2009 |page=228 |isbn=978-0-7637-7210-9 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=erFiYbLL9McC&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=definition+of+rape&amp;q=definition%20of%20rape |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Violence against women"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jech.2004.022756 |title=Violence against women |year=2005 |last1=Krantz |first1=G. |journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health |volume=59 |issue=10 |pages=818–21 |pmid=16166351 |last2=Garcia-Moreno |first2=C |pmc=1732916}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although closely related, the two terms are technically distinct in most jurisdictions.

Abbey ''et al.'' state that female victims are much more likely to be assaulted by an acquaintance, such as a friend or co-worker, a dating partner, an ex-boyfriend or a husband or other intimate partner than by a complete stranger.&lt;ref name="Abbey"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.2004.00149.x |pmid=26257466 |title=Similarities and Differences in Women's Sexual Assault Experiences Based on Tactics Used by the Perpetrator |year=2004 |last1=Abbey |first1=Antonia |last2=Beshears |first2=Renee |last3=Clinton-Sherrod |first3=A.

=== Sexual harassment ===
{{Main|Sexual harassment}}
Sexual harassment is [[intimidation]], [[bullying]] or [[coercion]] of a sexual nature. It may also be defined as the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Paludi | first = Michele Antoinette | authorlink = |author2=Barickman, | title = Academic and Workplace Sexual Harassment | publisher = SUNY Press | year = 1991 | location = | pages = 2–5 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7914-0829-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, sexual harassment is a form of discrimination which violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The legal and social definition of what constitutes sexual harassment differ widely by culture. Sexual harassment includes a wide range of behaviors from seemingly mild transgressions to serious forms of abuse. Some forms of sexual harassment overlap with sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Dziech et al. 1990, Boland 2002&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC): "Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when submission to or rejection of this conduct explicitly or implicitly affects an individual's employment, unreasonably interferes with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts About Sexual Harassment|url=https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-sex.html|website=U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|accessdate=18 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711064654/https://www.eeoc.gov/facts/fs-sex.html|archivedate=11 July 2017|df=dmy-all|date=2002-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*79% of victims are women, 21% are men
** 51% are harassed by a supervisor
** Business, Trade, Banking, and Finance are the biggest industries where sexual harassment occurs
** 12% received threats of termination if they did not comply with their requests
* 26,000 people in the armed forces were assaulted in 2012&lt;sup&gt;[[Sexual harassment|[18]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
** 302 of the 2,558 cases pursued by victims were prosecuted
** 38% of the cases were committed by someone of a higher rank
* Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
** [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964]] is a federal law that prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin, and religion. It generally applies to employers with 15 or more employees, including federal, state, and local governments. Title VII also applies to private and public colleges and universities, employment agencies, and labor organizations.&lt;sup&gt;[[Sexual harassment|[19]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
** "It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer … to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin."&lt;sup&gt;[[Sexual harassment|[20]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Mass sexual assault ===
{{further|Mass sexual assault}}
Mass sexual assault takes place in public places and in crowds. It involves large groups of men surrounding and assaulting a woman, groping, manual penetration, and [[Non-penetrative sex#Frottage|frottage]], but usually stopping short of penile rape.

== Emotional effects ==
Aside from physical traumas, rape and other sexual assault often result in long-term emotional effects, particularly in child victims. These can include:
[[denial]], [[learned helplessness]], [[genophobia]], [[anger]], [[self-blame]], [[anxiety]], [[shame]], [[nightmare]]s, [[fear]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s, [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[Rationalization (making excuses)|rationalization]], [[mood disorder|moodswings]], [[numbness]], [[promiscuity]], [[loneliness]], [[social anxiety]], difficulty trusting oneself or others, difficulty concentrating. Being the victim of sexual assault may lead to the development of [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], [[addiction]], [[major depressive disorder]] or other [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]].
Family and friends experience emotional scarring including a strong desire for [[revenge]], a desire to "fix' the problem and/or move on, and a rationalization that "it wasn't that bad".&lt;ref name="pcar.org" /&gt;

== Physical effects ==
While sexual assault, including rape, can result in physical trauma, many people who experience sexual assault will not suffer any physical injury.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy KM, Heterogeneity of existing research relating to sexual violence, sexual assault and rape precludes meta-analysis of injury data. Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine. (2013), 20(5):447–459&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rape myths]] suggest that the stereotypical victim of sexual violence is a bruised and battered young woman. The central issue in many cases of rape or other sexual assault is whether or not both parties consented to the sexual activity or whether or not both parties had the capacity to do so. Thus, physical force resulting in visible physical injury is not always seen. This stereotype can be damaging because people who have experienced sexual assault but have no physical trauma may be less inclined to report to the authorities or to seek health care.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy KM, The relationship of victim injury to the progression of sexual crimes through the criminal justice system, Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine 2012:19(6):309-311&lt;/ref&gt; However, women who experienced rape or physical violence by a partner were more likely than people who had not experienced this violence to report frequent headaches, chronic pain, difficulty sleeping, activity limitation, poor physical health, and poor mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Dupain Mandi, Developing and Implementing a Sexual Assault Violence Prevention and Awareness Campaign at a State-Supported Regional University. American Journal of Health Studies. 29. 4. (2014). 264. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic effects ==
Due to rape or sexual assault, or the threat of, there are many resulting impacts on income and commerce at the macro level. Each sexual assault (excluding child abuse) costs $5,100 in tangible losses (lost productivity, medical and mental health care, police/fire services, and property damage) plus $81,400 in lost quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/victcost.pdf|title=Victim Costs and Consequences: A New Look|last=Miller, Cohen, &amp; Weirsema|first=|date=1996|website=|publisher=National Institute of Justice|access-date=September 1, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515043800/https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/victcost.pdf|archivedate=15 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue has been addressed in the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. In his dissenting opinion of the U.S. Supreme Court case ''[[U.S. v. Morrison]]'', Justice Souter explained that 75% of women never go to the movies alone at night and nearly 50% will not ride public transportation out of fear of rape or sexual assault. It also stated that less than 1% of victims collect damages and 50% of women lose their jobs or quit after the trauma. The court ruled in ''U.S. v. Morrison'' that Congress did not have the authority to enact part of the [[Violence Against Women Act]] because it did not have a direct impact on commerce. The [[Commerce Clause]] of Article I Section VII of the [[U.S. Constitution]] gives authority and jurisdiction to the Federal government in matters of interstate commerce. As a result, the victim was unable to sue her attacker in Federal Court.

Sexual assault also has adverse economic effects for survivors on the micro level. For instance, survivors of sexual assault often require time off from work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nij.gov/publications/pages/publication-detail.aspx?ncjnumber=210346|title=Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Rape Victimization: Findings from the National Violence Against Women Survey|last=Tjaden &amp; Thoennes|first=|date=2006|website=National Institute of Justice|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs|access-date=2016-09-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916062148/http://www.nij.gov/publications/pages/publication-detail.aspx?ncjnumber=210346|archivedate=16 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and face increased rates of unemployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Byrne|first=Christina A.|last2=Resnick|first2=Heidi S.|last3=Kilpatrick|first3=Dean G.|last4=Best|first4=Connie L.|last5=Saunders|first5=Benjamin E.|title=The socioeconomic impact of interpersonal violence on women|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|volume=67|issue=3|pages=362–366|doi=10.1037/0022-006x.67.3.362|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Survivors of rape by an intimate partner lose an average of $69 per day due to unpaid time off from work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chrisler|first=Joan C.|last2=Ferguson|first2=Sheila|date=2006-11-01|title=Violence against Women as a Public Health Issue|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=1087|issue=1|pages=235–249|doi=10.1196/annals.1385.009|pmid=17189508|issn=1749-6632|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual assault is also associated with numerous negative employment consequences, including unpaid time off, diminished work performance, job loss, and inability to work, all of which can lead to lower earnings for survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loya|first=Rebecca M.|date=2015-10-01|title=Rape as an Economic Crime The Impact of Sexual Violence on Survivors' Employment and Economic Well-Being|url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/30/16/2793|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|language=en|volume=30|issue=16|pages=2793–2813|doi=10.1177/0886260514554291|issn=0886-2605|pmid=25381269|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118035347/http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/30/16/2793|archivedate=18 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical and psychological treatment of victims ==
In the [[emergency room]], emergency [[contraceptive]] medications are offered to women raped by men because about 5% of such rapes result in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis&gt;{{cite book | author = Varcarolis, Elizabeth| year = 2013 | title = Essentials of psychiatric mental health nursing | location = St. Louis | publisher = Elsevier | pages = 439–442}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Preventative healthcare|Preventative]] medication against [[sexually transmitted infection]]s are given to victims of all types of sexual assault (especially for the most common diseases like [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorhea]], [[trichomoniasis]] and [[bacterial vaginosis]]) and a blood serum is collected to test for STIs (such as [[HIV]], [[hepatitis B]] and [[syphilis]]).&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Any survivor with abrasions are immunized for tetanus if 5 years have elapsed since the last immunization.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Short-term treatment with a [[benzodiazepine]] may help with acute anxiety and antidepressants may be helpful for symptoms of [[PTSD]], depression and panic attacks.&lt;ref name=Varcarolis/&gt; Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) has also been proposed as a psychiatric treatment for victims of sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Posmontier B, Dovydaitis T, Lipman K.

== Post-assault mistreatment of victims ==

{{Main|Post-assault treatment of sexual assault victims}}

After the assault, victims may become the target of [[slut-shaming]] to [[cyberbullying]]. In addition, their credibility may be challenged. During criminal proceedings, [[publication ban]]s and [[rape shield laws]] may operate to protect victims from excessive public scrutiny. Negative social responses to victims’ disclosures of sexual assault have the potential to lead to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]] symptoms. [[Social isolation]], following a sexual assault, can result in the victim experiencing a decrease in their [[self-esteem]] and likelihood of rejecting unwanted sexual advances in the future.&lt;ref&gt; Relyea, M., &amp; Ullman, S.

Several research based rape prevention programs have been tested and verified through scientific studies. The rape prevention programs that have the strongest empirical data in the research literature include the following:

The Men's and Women's Programs, also known as the One in Four programs, were written by John Foubert.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Foubert |first=John |title=The Men's and Women's Programs: Ending Rape Through Peer Education |year=2011 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-88105-0}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is focused on increasing empathy toward rape survivors and motivating people to intervene as bystanders in sexual assault situations. Published data shows that high-risk persons who saw the Men's and Women's Program committed 40% fewer acts of sexually coercive behavior than those who didn’t. They also committed acts of sexual coercion that were 8 times less severe than a control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2202/1949-6605.1866 |title=Behavior Differences Seven Months Later: Effects of a Rape Prevention Program |year=2008 |last1=Foubert |first1=John D. |last2=Newberry |first2=Johnathan T |last3=Tatum |first3=Jerry |journal=Journal of Student Affairs Research and Practice |volume=44 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research also shows that people who saw the Men's and Women's Program reported more efficacy in intervening and greater willingness to help as a bystander after seeing the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/1077801211409728 |title=The Men's Program: Does It Impact College Men's Self-Reported Bystander Efficacy and Willingness to Intervene? |year=2011 |last1=Langhinrichsen-Rohling |first1=J. |last2=Foubert |first2=J.

Bringing in the Bystander was written by Victoria Banyard. Its focus is on who bystanders are, when they have helped, and how to intervene as a bystander in risky situations. The program includes a brief empathy induction component and a pledge to intervene in the future. Several studies show strong evidence of favorable outcomes including increased bystander efficacy, increased willingness to intervene as a bystander, and decreased rape myth acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, Moynihan &amp; Plante, 2007{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, Plante &amp; Moynihan, 2004{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Banyard, Ward, Cohn, Plante, Moorhead, &amp; Walsh, 2007{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MVP: Mentors in Violence Prevention was written by Jackson Katz. This program focuses on discussing a male bystander who didn't intervene when woman was in danger. An emphasis is placed on encouraging men to be active bystanders rather than standing by when they notice abuse. The bulk of the presentation is on processing hypothetical scenarios. Outcomes reported in research literature include lower levels of sexism and increased belief that participants could prevent violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;Cissner, 2009{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Dot program was written by Dorothy Edwards. This program includes both motivational speeches and peer education focused on bystander intervention. Outcomes show that program participation is associated with reductions in rape myth acceptance and increased bystander intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Coker, Cook-Craig, Williams, Fisher, Clear, Garcia &amp; Hegge, 2011{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of Edmonton, Canada, initiated a public education campaign aimed at potential perpetrators. Posters in bar bathrooms and public transit centers reminded men that "It's not sex when she's wasted" and "It's not sex when he changes his mind". The campaign was so effective that it spread to other cities. "The number of reported sexual assaults fell by 10 per cent last year in Vancouver, after the ads were featured around the city. It was the first time in several years that there was a drop in sexual assault activity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/12/01/edmonton-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign-dont-be-that-guy_n_2224228.html|title=Edmonton Sexual Assault Awareness Campaign: 'Don't Be That Guy' So Effective City Relaunches With New Posters (PHOTOS)|website=Huffingtonpost.ca|date=December 2012|accessdate=2016-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160902053213/http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/12/01/edmonton-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign-dont-be-that-guy_n_2224228.html|archivedate=2 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden introduced in September 2014 a nationwide campaign against sexual assault entitled "It's on us". The campaign includes tips against sexual assault, as well as broad scale of private and public pledges to change to provoke a cultural shift, with a focus on student activism, to achieve awareness and prevention nationwide. UC Berkeley, NCAA and Viacom have publicly announced their partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbott|first1=Katy|title=White House announces college-campus sexual assault awareness campaign|url=http://www.dailycal.org/2014/09/19/white-house-announces-campus-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign/|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=19 September 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140921151622/http://www.dailycal.org/2014/09/19/white-house-announces-campus-sexual-assault-awareness-campaign/|archivedate=21 September 2014|df=dmy-all|date=2014-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Department of Justice's National Crime Victimization Survey states that on average there are 237,868 victims (age 12 or older) of sexual assault and rape each year. According to [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network|RAINN]], every 107 seconds someone in America is sexually assaulted.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title = Statistics {{!}} RAINN {{!}} Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network|url = https://rainn.org/statistics|website = rainn.org|accessdate = 2015-11-18|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120072424/https://rainn.org/statistics|archivedate = 20 November 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual assault in the United States military]] also is a salient issue.

The victims of sexual assault:

'''Age'''
*15% are under the age of 12
*29% are age 12–17&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
*44% are under age 18
*80% are under age 30
*12–34 are the highest risk years
*Girls ages 16–19 are 4 times more likely than the general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault.&lt;ref name="rainn.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-victims|title=Who are the Victims? - RAINN - Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network|website=Rainn.org|accessdate=2016-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606002010/https://rainn.org/get-information/statistics/sexual-assault-victims|archivedate=6 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''By gender'''
A study from 1998 finds that,
*88.7% of rape victims are women, the other 11.3% being men
*17.6% of women have been victims of attempted (2.8%) or completed (14.8%) rape during their lifetime
*3% of men have been victims of attempted or completed rape during their lifetime
*17.7 million women have been victims of attempted or completed rape during their lifetime
*2.78 million men have been victims of attempted or completed rape during their lifetime.&lt;ref name="rainn.org"/&gt;

*38% of rapists are a friend or acquaintance
*28% are an intimate
*7% are a relative&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''College'''
{{main|Campus sexual assault}}

In the United States, several studies since 1987 have indicated that one in four college women have experienced rape or attempted rape at some point in their lifetime. These studies are based on anonymous surveys of college women, not reports to the police, and the results are disputed.&lt;ref name="leaderu1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209074942/http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, nearly two thirds of students reported knowing victims of rape and over half reported knowing perpetrators of sexual assault. One in ten reported knowing a victim of rape when alcohol was not involved and 22.6% reported knowing a victim of alcohol-facilitated rape.&lt;ref&gt;Sorenson SB, Joshi M, Sivitz E. Knowing a sexual assault victim or perpetrator: A stratified random sample of undergraduates at one university. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 2014; 29: 394-416&lt;/ref&gt; In the documentary ''The Hunting Ground'', the prevalence of sexual assault on college campuses is brought to attention. The schools poor judicial systems are scrutinized for not helping the victims and trying to keep these issues from the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=c42646ae-b960-4c12-bf53-6795dad55875%40sessionmgr107&amp;vid=14&amp;hid=107 | title=EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Texas A&amp;M University]] professor Jason Lindo and his colleagues analyzed over two decades worth of [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] data, noting that reports of rape increased 15-57% around the times of major [[American Football]] games at [[NCAA Division I|Division 1]] schools while attempting to find a link between campus rape and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/29/the-disturbing-truth-about-college-football-and-rape/|title=The disturbing truth about college football and rape|first=Danielle|last=Paquette|publisher=The Washington Post|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825194112/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/29/the-disturbing-truth-about-college-football-and-rape/|archivedate=25 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 report from the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] titled "The Sexual Victimization of College Women" reports that 3.1% of undergraduates survived rape or attempted rape during a 6–7 month academic year with an additional 10.1% surviving rape prior to college and an additional 10.9% surviving attempted rape prior to college. With no overlap between these groups, these percentages add to 24.1%, or "One in Four".&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Cullen &amp; Turner, 2006{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koss, Gidycz &amp; Wisniewski published a study in 1987 where they interviewed approximately 6,000 college students on 32 college campuses nationwide. They asked several questions covering a wide range of behaviors. From this study 15% of college women answered "yes" to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of rape. An additional 12% of women answered "yes" to questions about whether they experienced something that met the definition of attempted rape, thus the statistic One in Four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0022-006X.55.2.162 |title=The scope of rape: Incidence and prevalence of sexual aggression and victimization in a national sample of higher education students |year=1987 |last1=Koss |first1=Mary P. |last2=Gidycz |first2=Christine A. |last3=Wisniewski |first3=Nadine |journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=162–70 |pmid=3494755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A point of contention lies in the leading nature of the questions in the study conducted by Koss, Gidycz &amp; Wisniewski. Koss herself later admitted that the question that had garnered the largest "rape" result was flawed and ultimately rendered the study invalid. Most prominently the problem was that many respondents who had answered yes to several questions had their responses treated as having been raped. The issue being that these same respondents did not feel they had been victimized and never sought redress for grievances. The resultant change shows a prevalence of only 1 in 22 college women having been raped or attempted to be raped during their time at college.&lt;ref name="leaderu1" /&gt;

In 1995, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] replicated part of this study, however they examined rape only, and did not look at attempted rape. They used a two-stage cluster sample design to produce a nationally representative sample of undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to 18 years. The first-stage sampling frame contained 2,919 primary sampling units (PSUs), consisting of 2- and 4-year colleges and universities. The second sampling stage consisted of a random sample drawn from the primary sample unit frame enrolled in the 136 participating colleges and universities to increase the sample size to 4,609 undergraduate college students aged greater than or equal to 18 years old with a representative sample demographic matching the national demographic. Differential sampling rates of the PSU were used to ensure sufficient numbers of male and female, black and Hispanic students in the total sample population. After differential sample weighting, female students represented 55.5% of the sample; white students represented 72.8% of the sample, black students 10.3%, Hispanic students 7.1%, and 9.9% were other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/MMWR/preview/mmwrhtml/00049859.htm|title=Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance: National College Health Risk Behavior Survey -- United States, 1995|work=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|date=14 November 1997|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619204741/https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00049859.htm|archivedate=19 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was determined that nationwide, 13.1% of college students reported that they had been forced to have sexual intercourse against their will during their lifetime. Female students were significantly more likely than male students to report they had ever been forced to have sexual intercourse; 20% of approximately 2500 females (55% of 4,609 samples) and 3.9% of males reported experiencing rape thus far in the course of their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/07448489709595589 |title=Results from the 1995 National College Health Risk Behavior Survey |year=1997 |last1=Douglas |first1=Kathy A. |last2=Collins |first2=Janet L. |last3=Warren |first3=Charles |last4=Kann |first4=Laura |last5=Gold |first5=Robert |last6=Clayton |first6=Sonia |last7=Ross |first7=James G. |last8=Kolbe |first8=Lloyd J. |journal=Journal of American College Health |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=55–66 |pmid=9276349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies concerning the annual incidence of rape, some studies conclude an occurrence of 5%. The National Survey of Children’s Exposure to Violence found that in the 2013–2014 academic year, 4.6% of girls ages 14 – 17 experienced sexual assault or sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finkelhor|first1=David|title=Prevalence of Childhood Exposure to Violence, Crime, and Abuse: Results From the National Survey of Children's Exposure to Violence|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|volume=169|issue=8|pages=746–54|date=Jun 2015|url=http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2344705|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715000045/http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2344705|archivedate=15 July 2015|df=dmy-all|doi=10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.0676|pmid=26121291}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, Mohler-Kuo, Dowdall, Koss &amp; Weschler (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15000502 |year=2004 |last1=Mohler-Kuo |first1=M |last2=Dowdall |first2=GW |last3=Koss |first3=MP |last4=Wechsler |first4=H |title=Correlates of rape while intoxicated in a national sample of college women |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=37–45 |journal=Journal of Studies on Alcohol |doi=10.15288/jsa.2004.65.37}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in a study of approximately 25,000 college women nationwide that 4.7% experienced rape or attempted rape during a single academic year. This study did not measure lifetime incidence of rape or attempted rape.

Other research has found that about 80,000 American children are sexually abused each year.&lt;ref name=Bonnar&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2008.153254 |title=Sexual Offender Laws and Prevention of Sexual Violence or Recidivism |year=2010 |last1=Bonnar-Kidd |first1=Kelly K. |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=412–9 |pmid=20075329 |pmc=2820068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== By jurisdiction ==

=== Australia ===

Within Australia, the term sexual assault is used to describe a variation of sexual offences. This is due to a variety of definitions and use of terminology to describe sexual offences within territories and states as each territory and state have their own legislation to define rape, attempted rape, sexual assault, aggravated sexual assault, sexual penetration or intercourse without consent and sexual violence.

In the State of New South Wales, sexual assault is a statutory offence punishable under s 61I of the [[Crimes Act 1900]]. The term "sexual assault" is equivalent to "rape" in ordinary parlance, while all other assaults of a sexual nature are termed "indecent assault".

To be liable for punishment under the [[Crimes Act 1900]], an offender must intend to commit an act of sexual intercourse as defined under s 61H(1) while having one of the states of knowledge of non-consent defined under s 61HA(3). But note that s 61HA(3) is an objective standard which only require the person has no reasonable grounds for believing the other person is consenting.&lt;ref&gt;See Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) s 61 HA (3)&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum penalty for sexual assault is 14 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;s 61H(1) Crimes Act 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggravated sexual assault is sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and in circumstances of aggravation. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years under s 61J of the Crimes Act.

In the state of Victoria, rape is punishable under s 38 of the Crimes Act 1958, with a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1958 (VIC)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the state of South Australia, rape is punishable under s 48 of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) with a maximum term of life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the state of Western Australia, sexual penetration is punishable under s 325 the Criminal Code Act 1913 with a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code Act 1913 (WA)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Northern Territory, offences of sexual intercourse and gross indecency without consent are punishable under s 192 of the Criminal Code Act 1983 and punishable with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code Act 1983 (NT)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Queensland, rape and sexual assault are punishable under s 349, Chapter 32 of the Criminal Code Act 1899 with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code Act 1899 (QLD)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Tasmania, rape is punishable under s 185 of the Criminal Code Act 1924 with a maximum punishment of 21 years under s389 of the Criminal Code Act 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Criminal Code 1924 (TAS)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Australian Capital Territory, sexual assault is punishable under Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900 with a maximum punishment of 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Act 1900 (ACT)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual assault is considered a gendered crime which results in 85% of sexual assaults never coming to the attention of the criminal justice system according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics. (2005). Personal Safety Survey. Canberra: ABS&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to low reporting rates, treatment of victims and distrust of the criminal justice system, difficulty in obtaining evidence and the belief in sexual assault myths.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, M. (2005). The law and sexual offences against adults in Australia (Issues No. 4). Melbourne: Australian Centre for the Study of Sexual Assault&lt;/ref&gt;

However, once a person is charged, the public prosecutor will decide whether the case will proceed to trial based on whether there is sufficient evidence and whether a case is in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;Lievore, D. (2005). Prosecutorial decisions in adult sexual assault cases. Trends and Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice, 291, January. Canberra: Australian Institute of Criminology&lt;/ref&gt; Once the matter has reached trial, the matter will generally be heard in the District Court. This is because sexually violent crimes are mostly categorised as indictable offences (serious offences), as opposed to summary offences (minor offences). Sexual offences can also be heard in the Supreme Court, but more generally if the matter is being heard as an appeal.

Once the matter is being heard, the prosecution must provide evidence which proves “beyond reasonable doubt” that the offence was committed by the defendant. The standard of proof is vital in checking the power of the State.&lt;ref name="aifs.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://aifs.gov.au/publications/sexual-assault-laws-australia |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306040553/https://aifs.gov.au/publications/sexual-assault-laws-australia |archivedate=6 March 2017 |df=dmy-all |date=2011-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While as previously stated that each jurisdiction (State and Territory) has its own sexual offence legislation, there are many common elements to any criminal offence that advise on how the offence is defined and what must be proven by the prosecution in order to find the defendant guilty.&lt;ref name="aifs.gov.au"/&gt; These elements are known as Actus Reus which comprises the physical element (see Ryan v Regina [1967])&lt;ref&gt;Ryan v R [1967] HCA 2; 121 CLR 205&lt;/ref&gt; and the Mens Rea which comprises the mental element (see He Kaw Teh (1985)).&lt;ref&gt;He Kaw Teh v R (1985) 157 CLR 523&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable sexual assault cases which have resulted in convictions are Regina v Bilal Skaf [2005]&lt;ref&gt;R v Bilal Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297,16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and Regina v Mohommed Skaf [2005]&lt;ref&gt;R v Mohommed Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 298, 16 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; which were highly visible in New South Wales within the media the 2000s. These cases were closely watched by the media and led to legislative changes such as the passing of the Crimes Amendment (Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company) Act 2001 No 62&lt;ref&gt;Crimes Amendment (Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company) Act 2001 No 62&lt;/ref&gt; which dramatically increased the sentences for ‘gang rapists’ by creating a new category of crime known as Aggravated Sexual Assault in Company. Changes were also made to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 NSW&lt;/ref&gt; This change is known as the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004 No 3&lt;ref&gt;Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Victim Impact Statements) Act 2004 No 3&lt;/ref&gt; which expands the category of offences in respect of which a Local Court may receive and consider Victim Impact Statements to include some indictable offences which are usually dealt with summarily.

=== Canada ===
Sexual assault is defined as sexual contact with another person without that other person's consent. Consent is defined in section 273.1(1) as "''the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question''".

Section 265 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] defines the offences of [[assault]] and sexual assault.

Section 271 criminalizes "Sexual assault", section 272 criminalizes "Sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm" and section 273 criminalizes "[[Aggravated sexual assault]]".

==== Consent ====
The absence of consent defines the crime of sexual assault. Section 273.1 (1) defines consent, section 273.1 (2) outlines certain circumstances where "no consent" is obtained, while section 273.1 (3) states that subsection (2) ''does not limit'' the circumstances where "no consent" is obtained (i.e. subsection (2) describes ''some'' circumstances which deem the act to be non-consensual, but other circumstances, not described in this section, can also deem the act as having been committed without consent). "No consent" to sexual assault is also subject to Section 265 (3), which also outlines several situations where the act is deemed non-consensual. In 2011, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in ''[[R. v. J.A.]]'' interpreted the provisions below to find that a person must have an active mind during the sexual activity in order to consent, and that they cannot give consent in advance.&lt;ref name="Criminal Code"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#anchorbo-ga:l_VIII |title=Criminal Code |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |accessdate=9 December 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109205822/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-6.html#anchorbo-ga:l_VIII |archivedate=9 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woman can't consent to sex while unconscious, Supreme Court rules |author=Mike Blanchfield |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/05/27/woman_cant_consent_to_sex_while_unconscious_supreme_court_rules.html |newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]] |date=27 May 2011 |accessdate=27 May 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612140715/http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2011/05/27/woman_cant_consent_to_sex_while_unconscious_supreme_court_rules.html |archivedate=12 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Meaning of “consent”''

''273.1'' (1) Subject to subsection (2) and subsection 265(3), “consent” means, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, ''the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question''.

''Where no consent obtained''

(2) No consent is obtained, for the purposes of sections 271, 272 and 273, where
(a) the agreement is expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;
(b) the complainant is incapable of consenting to the activity;
(c) the accused induces the complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position of trust, power or authority;
(d) the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity; or
(e) the complainant, having consented to engage in sexual activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to continue to engage in the activity.

''Subsection (2) not limiting''

(3) Nothing in subsection (2) shall be construed as limiting the circumstances in which no consent is obtained.

*''Section 265(3)''

''Consent''

(3) For the purposes of this section, no consent is obtained where the complainant submits or does not resist by reason of
(a) the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;
(b) threats or fear of the application of force to the complainant or to a person other than the complainant;
(c) fraud; or
(d) the exercise of authority.

In accordance with 265 (4) an accused may use the defence that he or she believed that the complainant consented, but such a defence may be used only when "a judge, if satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury when reviewing all the evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused's belief, to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief"; furthermore according to section 273.2(b) the accused must show that he or she took reasonable steps in order to ascertain the complainant's consent, also 273.2(a) states that if the accused's belief steams from self-induced intoxication, or recklessness or wilful blindness than such belief is not a defence.&lt;ref name="Criminal Code" /&gt;

*''265 (4)''
''Accused’s belief as to consent''

(4) Where an accused alleges that he or she believed that the complainant consented to the conduct that is the subject-matter of the charge, a judge, if satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury, when reviewing all the evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused’s belief, to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief.

*''Where belief in consent not a defence''

273.2 It is not a defence to a charge under section 271, 272 or 273 that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge, where
(a) the accused’s belief arose from the accused’s

(i) self-induced intoxication, or

(ii) recklessness or wilful blindness; or
(b) the accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.

=== Germany ===
Before 1997, the definition of rape was: "''Whoever compels a woman to have extramarital intercourse with him, or with a third person, by force or the threat of present danger to life or limb, shall be punished by not less than two years’ imprisonment''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kunarac/tjug/en/kun-tj010222e-4.htm|title=Kunarac, Vukovic and Kovac - Judgement - Part IV|website=Icty.org|accessdate=2016-09-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312233318/http://www.icty.org/x/cases/kunarac/tjug/en/kun-tj010222e-4.htm|archivedate=12 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:'''Section 177'''
:'''Sexual assault by use of force or threats; rape'''

#Whosoever coerces another person
##by force;
##by threat of imminent danger to life or limb; or
##by exploiting a situation in which the victim is unprotected and at the mercy of the offender,
#:to suffer sexual acts by the offender or a third person on their own person or to engage actively in sexual activity with the offender or a third person, shall be liable to imprisonment of not less than one year.
#In especially serious cases the penalty shall be imprisonment of not less than two years. An especially serious case typically occurs if
##the offender performs sexual intercourse with the victim or performs similar sexual acts with the victim, or allows them to be performed on himself by the victim, especially if they degrade the victim or if they entail penetration of the body (rape); or
##the offence is committed jointly by more than one person.

Subsections (3), (4) and (5) provide additional stipulations on sentencing depending on aggravating or mitigating circumstances.

Section 178 provides that "''If the offender through sexual assault or rape (section 177) causes the death of the victim at least by gross negligence the penalty shall be imprisonment for life or not less than ten years''."

=== Republic of Ireland ===
As in many other jurisdictions, the term sexual assault is generally used to describe non-penetrative sexual offences. Section 2 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act of 1981 states that a man has committed rape if he has sexual intercourse with a woman who at the time of the intercourse does not consent to it, and at that time he knows that she does not consent to the intercourse or he is reckless as to whether she does or does not consent to it. Under Section 4 of the Criminal Law (Rape Amendment) Act of 1990, rape means a sexual assault that includes penetration (however slight) of the anus or mouth by the penis or penetration (however slight) of the vagina by any object held or manipulated by another person. The maximum penalty for rape in Ireland is imprisonment for life.&lt;ref&gt;National SATU Guidelines Development Group. Rape/Sexual Assault: National Guidelines on Referral and Forensic Clinical Examination in Ireland. 3rd Edition; 2014. Available at www.hse.ie/satu&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Africa ===
The [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act]] created the offence of sexual assault, replacing a common-law offence of [[indecent assault]]. "Sexual assault" is defined as the unlawful and intentional sexual violation of another person without their consent. The Act's definition of "sexual violation" incorporates a number of sexual acts, including any genital contact that does not amount to penetration as well as any contact with the mouth designed to cause sexual arousal. Non-consensual acts that involve actual penetration are rape rather than sexual assault.

Unlawfully and intentionally inspiring the belief in another person that they will be sexually violated also amounts to sexual assault. The Act also created the offences of "compelled sexual assault", when a person forces a second person to commit an act of sexual violation with a third person; and "compelled self-sexual assault", when a person forces another person to masturbate or commit various other sexual acts on theirself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=77866 |title=Welcome to the official South African government online site! &amp;#124; South African Government |website=Info.gov.za |date=2016-08-11 |accessdate=2016-09-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629081854/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=77866 |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== England and Wales ====
Sexual assault is a statutory offence in [[England and Wales]]. It is created by section 3 of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]] which defines "sexual assault" as when a person (A)
{{quotation|
#intentionally touches another person (B),
#the touching is sexual,

===== Consent =====
[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/74 Section 74] of the Sexual Offenses Act explains that "a person consents if he agrees by choice and has the freedom and capacity to make that choice".

[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/75 Section 75] clarifies what consent means

75 Evidential presumptions about consent

(1)If in proceedings for an offence to which this section applies it is proved—
(a)that the defendant did the relevant act,
(b)that any of the circumstances specified in subsection (2) existed, and
(c)that the defendant knew that those circumstances existed, the complainant is to be taken not to have consented to the relevant act unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he consented, and the defendant is to be taken not to have reasonably believed that the complainant consented unless sufficient evidence is adduced to raise an issue as to whether he reasonably believed it.

(2)The circumstances are that—
(a)any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, using violence against the complainant or causing the complainant to fear that immediate violence would be used against him;
(b)any person was, at the time of the relevant act or immediately before it began, causing the complainant to fear that violence was being used, or that immediate violence would be used, against another person;
(c)the complainant was, and the defendant was not, unlawfully detained at the time of the relevant act;
(d)the complainant was asleep or otherwise unconscious at the time of the relevant act;
(e)because of the complainant’s physical disability, the complainant would not have been able at the time of the relevant act to communicate to the defendant whether the complainant consented;
(f)any person had administered to or caused to be taken by the complainant, without the complainant’s consent, a substance which, having regard to when it was administered or taken, was capable of causing or enabling the complainant to be stupefied or overpowered at the time of the relevant act.

(3)In subsection (2)(a) and (b), the reference to the time immediately before the relevant act began is, in the case of an act which is one of a continuous series of sexual activities, a reference to the time immediately before the first sexual activity began.

=== United States ===
The United States Department of Justice defines sexual assault as "any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient. Falling under the definition of sexual assault are sexual activities as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual Assault|url=https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault|website=United States Department of Justice|accessdate=14 September 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010230428/https://www.justice.gov/ovw/sexual-assault|archivedate=10 October 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2014-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sharp power''' is the use of manipulative diplomatic policies by one country to influence and undermine the political system of a target country.  Sharp power can include attempts by one country to manipulate and manage information about itself in the news media and educational systems of another country, for the purpose of misleading or dividing public opinion in a target country, or for masking or diverting attention away from negative information about itself.  

Sharp power is distinguished from [[soft power]], which are attractive policies that project a positive impression of one country and promote greater understanding with another country, ultimately to influence the decisions of another country through persuasion.  Soft power policies can include [[student exchange program|student exchanges]] and the sponsoring of [[Cultural diplomacy | cultural and sporting events]].  Sharp power is also distinct from [[hard power]], which are coercive policies by one country to compel another country into taking action or changing its decisions.  Hard power can include [[war | military force]], [[economic sanctions]], and [[coercive diplomacy|diplomatic threats]].  

The term "sharp power" was coined in November of 2017 by the [[National Endowment for Democracy]], and published in an article in [[Foreign Affairs | Foreign Affairs Magazine]], to describe aggressive and subversive policies employed by authoritarian governments as a projection of state power in democratic countries, policies that cannot be described as either hard power or soft power.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Meaning of Sharp Power:  How Authoritarian States Project Influence|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2017-11-16/meaning-sharp-power|publisher=Foreign Affairs|author=Christopher Walker and Jessica Ludwig|date=Nov 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The NED article specifically names the Russian state-funded [[RT (TV network) | RT News Network]] and the Chinese state-sponsored [[Confucius Institute | Confucius Institute educational partnerships]] as examples of sharp power.  According NED, autocratic states "are not necessarily seeking to 'win hearts and minds,' the common frame of reference for soft power efforts, but they are surely seeking to manipulate their target audiences by distorting the information that reaches them."  

Since 2018, the term "sharp power" has been used in news articles, scholarly discussions, and Congressional hearings.  Even representatives of the Chinese Communist Party have used the term, dismissing Western claims that their country has engaged in sharp power practices.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference spokesman addresses Western charges of China using 'sharp power'.|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLe5ZF6qeX8|publisher=China Global Television Network|date=Mar 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''silent service code''' is a way for a diner to "talk" to [[Waiting staff|servers]] during a meal without saying a word, mainly to tell them that the diner is finished.  This will prevent any embarrassing situations where the server would take a meal prematurely.

To tell a server you have finished place your [[napkin]] to the left of your [[Plate (dishware)|plate]], and place all your [[food utensil|utensils]] together in a "4-o'clock" position on your plate.

Utensils crossed on a plate signify that a diner is still eating.

If you must leave during the meal, you should place the napkin on your chair to avoid any confusion.

The code is almost always taught during business dining [[etiquette]] classes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6187">The term "'''social defence'''" is used to describe non-military action by a society or [[social group]], particularly in a context of a sustained campaign against outside attack or dictatorial rule – or preparations for such a campaign in the event of external attack or usurpation. There are various near-synonyms, including "non-violent defence", "civilian defence", "civilian-based defence", and "defence by civil resistance". Whatever term is used, this approach involves preparations for and use of a range of actions – which can be variously called [[nonviolent resistance]] and [[civil resistance]] – for national defence against invasion, [[coup d'état]] and other threats.

Writings about this concept include works by Theodor Ebert (Germany),&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. the various contributions, including Theodor Ebert's, in the volume resulting from a September 1967 conference organized by the Vereinigung Deutscher Wissenschaftler, ''Tagungsbericht: Civilian Defence -- Gewaltloser Widerstand als Form der Verteidigungspolitik'', Bertelsmann Universitätsverlag, Bielefeld, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Martin (Australia),&lt;ref&gt;Brian Martin et al., ''Nonviolent Struggle and Social Defence'', ed. Shelley Anderson and Janet Larmore. War Resisters' International, London, 1991.[http://wri-irg.org/books/nvsd.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] (UK),&lt;ref&gt;Adam Roberts, ed. ''The Strategy of Civilian Defence: Non-violent Resistance to Aggression'', Faber, London, 1967. (Also published as ''Civilian Resistance as a National Defense'', Stackpole Books, Harrisburg, USA, 1968; and, with a new Introduction on "Czechoslovakia and Civilian Defence", as ''Civilian Resistance as a National Defence'', Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, UK, and Baltimore, USA, 1969. {{ISBN|0-14-021080-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Sharp]] (US),&lt;ref&gt;Gene Sharp, ''Social Power and Political Freedom'', [[Porter Sargent]], Boston, 1980, pp. 195-261. {{ISBN|0-87558-093-9}} (paperback); and ''Civilian-based Defence: A Post-military Weapons System'', Princeton University Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-691-07809-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Heinz Vetschera (Austria),&lt;ref&gt;Heinz Vetschera, ''Soziale Verteidigung, Ziviler Widerstand, Immerwährende Neutralität'', Wilhelm Braumüller, Vienna, 1978. {{ISBN|3-7003-0186-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Anders Boserup]] and Andy Mack, ''War Without Weapons: Non-violence in National Defence'', Frances Pinter, London, 1974. {{ISBN|0-903804-03-4}} (paperback).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application of idea to particular countries==

A number of studies have considered the possible application to particular countries of the idea of a defence policy based on civil resistance. In the [[United Kingdom]], in 1959 Commander Sir [[Stephen King-Hall]] supported unilateral nuclear disarmament by Britain, and proposed an alternative containing some reliance on conventional force plus "a defence system of non-violence against violence".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen King-Hall, ''Defence in the Nuclear Age'', Gollancz, London, 1959, pp. 145–7 &amp; 190.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 an independent non-governmental body in the UK, the Alternative Defence Commission, examined the idea thoroughly and saw possibilities in it, but came out in favour of NATO countries adopting a posture of "defensive deterrence" – i.e. deterrence based on non-nuclear weapons and strategies, including an element of military defence in depth.&lt;ref&gt;''Defence Without the Bomb: The Report of the Alternative Defence Commission'', Taylor and Francis, London, 1983. {{ISBN|0-85066-240-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding [[Sweden]], Adam Roberts did an officially-commissioned study in 1972 which concluded: "Civil resistance would be unlikely to be effective in replacing some of the functions of the Swedish armed forces – for example the defence of sparsely populated parts of the country. However, it might be the best means of resisting alien control in certain types of circumstance (e.g. total occupation by a super-power, attack by a liberal democratic state, occupation with the aim of economic exploitation; or occupation of urban and highly developed areas)."&lt;ref&gt;From the later summary of the 1972 Swedish study, Adam Roberts, "Civil Resistance and Swedish Defence Policy", in Gustav Geeraerts (ed.), ''Possibilities of Civilian Defence in Western Europe'', Swets &amp; Zeitlinger, Amsterdam, 1977, p. 123. {{ISBN|90-265-0252-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the Cold War the idea of defence by civil resistance has been pursued in a number of countries, including the [[Baltic states]]. However, with the partial and limited exception of Sweden, it has generally not attracted support from major political parties, and it has not been adopted as a major plank in the security policy of any country.&lt;ref&gt;For a short summary of developments, including in the Baltic states immediately after the end of the Cold War, see [[Michael Randle]], ''Civil Resistance''[http://www.civilresistance.info/randle1994 ''Civil Resistance''], Fontana, London, 1994, pp. 129–30. {{ISBN|0-586-09291-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 survey of various studies of the viability of defence by civil resistance, Adam Roberts concludes by raising a question, not about the utility of civil resistance generally, but about its capacity to be a complete substitute for military force.&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;Adam Roberts, Introduction, in Adam Roberts and Timothy Garton Ash (eds.), ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present'', Oxford University Press, 2009, pp. 10-12. {{ISBN|978-0-19-955201-6}}. [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other usages of term==

"Social defence" as defined and summarized here is distinct from certain other usages of this term. For example, within the framework of its system of [[Total Defence]], the Singapore government's civil defence/national security policy uses the term "social defence" as a synonym for social inclusion policies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9432">[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1485) [[Accademia, Venice]]]]
'''Somatocentrism''' is a [[cultural]] [[value system]] in which [[biological determinism]] is the basis for social organization.  The [[phenotypical]] variation of an individual in this system determines the individual’s [[social identity]] and [[social relations]], although it doesn’t necessarily denote their [[social position]].  
== Definition ==

The term ‘somatocentric’ is derived from 
* “soma”, [[New Latin]], meaning ‘[[Human body|body]]’
* and “centric” from the [[Greek language|Greek]] “kentrikos”, meaning of the center.  
In this system, the [[physical body]] of an individual is heavily emphasized, and valued in determining the [[social identity]] of the individual.

== Perception ==
A necessary precondition for individuals in a somatocentric system is the privileging of [[Visual perception|sight]] over other [[senses]] in perceiving [[reality]].  Using vision as the primary sense for constructing [[reality]] may cause one to miss complex and hidden nuances of [[existence]], limiting [[perception]].&lt;ref&gt;Coetzee, Pieter Hendrik, [https://books.google.com/books?id=eJCkw7e05p4C&amp;pg=PA467 ''Race and Gender''], 28 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  A comparison of [[Visual perception|sight]] and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] shows that sight is mono-directional and exclusive, while sound is proximate, fluid, and inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, David: ''History of Bourgeois Perception''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982, pp. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Privileging [[Visual perception|sight]] over other senses facilitates a type of [[self-image]] that focus on the individual's body, as vision is the primary means to delineate phenotypical difference.  Identifying these differences this way may lead to attributing social value to individuals who look a certain way.

=== Body Image ===
[[Body image]] is a [[subjectivity|subjective]] picture of one’s own [[human physical appearance|physical appearance]] established both by [[self-awareness]] and by noting the reactions of others.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Online, ''Body image'', "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/body%20image]", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Preoccupation with body image and the physical appearance of one’s body denotes how much value one ascribes to their phenotypical traits.  Body image may be valued highly, and more often than not, dissatisfaction with one’s own body image perverts that value with other social effects.

==== Body Dysmorphic Disorder ====
People who suffer from [[Body Dysmorphic Disorder]] (or BDD) fixate on a defect in their appearance.  People with BDD are affected daily with [[Stress (biology)|stress]] and [[anxiety]], which may impair their role in the social and occupational areas of their life. The amount of social value ascribed to the importance of body image affects the level of stress someone suffering from BDD feels. &lt;ref&gt;Fox, Kate. ''Body Image Studies'', 1997. "[http://www.mybodybeautiful.co.uk/body_image/BodyImage_Studies.htm]", 25 September 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; 
==== Height ====
Studies show that in some cultures, people who are relatively taller than others get relatively better treatment by their peers. 

A study conducted in [[Australia]] found that tall people earn higher [[wages]] than their equally competent shorter co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Kathy. ''Tall men earn $1000 more than short ones'', 17 May 2009. "[http://www.news.com.au/features/tall-men-earn-1000-more-than-short-ones/story-e6frfl49-1225713033720]", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  A study conducted in [[Southampton]] of ninety two normal teens who were shorter than their peers revealed that the shorter boys were twice as likely to be [[bullied]] than their average height controls matched by sex and age.&lt;ref&gt;Voss, Linda D. and Mulligan, Jean. ''Bullying in school: are short pupils at risk?'', 1 November 2000. "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC32258/]", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of these studies reveal a [[correlation]] between height and social value, indicating somatocentric issues.

The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists define ‘short stature’ as being two [[standard deviations]] below the [[average]] for a particular age and sex; in [[United States|America]], a male shorter than 5’7’’ and a female shorter than 5’2’’ are both short statured.&lt;ref&gt;"NOSSA, What is short statured?", 2011, "{{cite web |url=http://www.nossaonline.org/aboutus/whatisshortstatured.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926233901/http://www.nossaonline.org/aboutus/whatisshortstatured.html |archivedate=2011-09-26 |df= }}", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Groups have been formed by people who feel short, such as [[National Organization of Short Statured Adults|The National Organization of Short Statured Adults (NOSSA)]].  One of the primary functions of this group is to inform its members of the [[sociological]] and [[psychological]] aspects of being short statured as research continues.&lt;ref&gt;"NOSSA, About Us", 2011, "{{cite web |url=http://www.nossaonline.org/aboutus.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004121828/http://www.nossaonline.org/aboutus.html |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Racism ===
[[Racism]] is defined by a belief that [[Race (classification of humans)|race]] is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster Online, ''Racism'', "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism?show=0&amp;t=1316986204]", 25 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Racial differences are most easily compared by the phenotypical differences between peoples of a different race, i.e. [[Human skin color|skin tone]], facial features, [[hair color]], and [[body type]].  To place social value on any trait, whether positive or negative, is a product of somatocentric values.

=== Gender ===
A somatocentric culture may create [[Social constructionism|social constructs]] based on the interpretation of biological differences between its individuals.  The concept of ‘[[gender]]’ is an example of a [[social construct|construct]] that may arise from somatocentricity.  [[Sex and gender distinction|Sex and gender]] are loosely related as they both deal with the [[male]] and the [[female]]; however, one considers [[empirical]] distinction, while the other considers [[social]] distinction.&lt;ref name="Invention of Women"&gt;[[Oyèrónkẹ́ Oyěwùmí|Oyewumi, Oyeronke]], ''The Invention of Women'', 1997, 5 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

A sex refers to biological distinctions between males and females.  Certain [[Organ (anatomy)|biological structures]] are unique to either females or males; in humans, the [[ovary]] being unique to the former, the [[prostate gland]] being unique to the latter.  Biological differences between males and females govern the action of [[reproduction]] in any [[species]] that repopulates via [[sexual reproduction]], and in some cases, influence the action of child-rearing.

By contrast, [[gender roles]], [[gender identities]], and the concepts of [[masculine]] and [[feminine]] are all [[social constructs]] which may be extrapolated from phenotypical differences between men and women.&lt;ref name="Invention of Women"/&gt;

For example, in [[Western culture]], women may fill domestic [[Role|social roles]], with an emphasis on [[Parenting|childcare]].  Women are also unique members of a population that are outfitted with [[breasts]] which help feed [[infants]], while men lack these [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]].  While it is logical to assert that women may be biologically better suited for [[postnatal]] care of an [[infant]] than men, it does not follow from the ability to [[Breastfeeding|breast-feed]] that women are better suited to domestic [[Role|social roles]] than men.

==== Masculinity and Femininity ====
[[Masculinity]] and [[femininity]] are also engendered concepts that may draw from phenotypical difference between male and female.  A person who exhibits [[physical strength]] may be deemed [[masculine]], while a person who exhibits [[gentleness]] may be deemed [[feminine]].  Attributing significance to the phenotypical difference between the size or shape of men and women creates a [[binary opposition|binary]] between the two that allows the casual observer to presume social significance of a person in terms of this [[arbitrary]] scale.&lt;ref name="Invention of Women"/&gt;

== Background ==
Molyneux was born in Ireland and raised mainly in London before moving to Canada at age 11.&lt;ref name=Mississauga-2003 /&gt;  Molyneux attended the [[Glendon College]] of [[York University]], where he was an actor at Theatre Glendon&lt;ref name=Star-23Feb1988 /&gt; and a member of the Debating Society.&lt;ref name=ProTem-8Feb1988 /&gt; He then attended the [[National Theatre School of Canada]] in Montreal.&lt;ref name=Mississauga-2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Burg-Star /&gt; In 1991, Molyneux received a B.A. in History from [[McGill University]], where he was active in the [[Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate|McGill Debating Union]]. He then went on to receive an M.A. in History from [[University of Toronto]] in 1993.&lt;ref name=Burg-Star /&gt;&lt;ref name=Globe-2008 /&gt;

== Career ==
In early 1995, Molyneux and his brother Hugh founded Caribou Systems Corporation, a Toronto-based provider of environmental database software. The company was sold in 2000.&lt;ref name="Burg-Star" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2002-01-28_Blue292" /&gt;

In 2005, Molyneux began a podcast called ''Freedomain Radio'' (''FDR'').&lt;ref name="freedomainradio"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fdrpodcasts.com/#/0 |title=An Introduction to Freedomain Radio |website=Freedomainradio.com |date= |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He uses the same name for the website on which he distributes his own writings, hosts podcast archives, and provides an [[Internet forum]] for ''FDR'' listeners. Molyneux also produces videos and commentary on current events, and he presents a weekly call-in show on which listeners can ask questions or discuss personal issues.&lt;ref name="Globe-2008" /&gt; Molyneux funds his efforts by soliciting direct payment from listeners and viewers.&lt;ref name="Horsager-TheTrustEdge"&gt;{{cite book |last=Horsager |first=David |date=October 2012 |title=The Trust Edge: How top leaders gain faster results, deeper relationships, and a stronger bottom line |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |location=New York |pages=25–26 |oclc=820783989 |isbn=978-1-4767-1137-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Molyneux interviewed James Damore, the [[Google]] employee who was fired after writing the [[Google's Ideological Echo Chamber]] memo.&lt;ref name="Goo"&gt;{{cite news |last=Levin |first=Sam |date=August 9, 2017 |title=Fired Google memo writer gives first big interviews to rightwing YouTubers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/aug/09/james-damore-google-memo-youtube-interviews |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Molyneux and Canadian internet personality [[Lauren Southern]] toured the Australian cities of [[Sydney]] and [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kinsella |first1=Luke |title=What I learnt about the far right from Lauren Southern |url=https://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/real-life/true-stories/what-i-learnt-about-the-far-right-from-lauren-southern/news-story/0443ce7a7a09dc8431776f469b34ae0d |accessdate=31 July 2018 |publisher=[[News.com.au]] |date=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NITV]] quotes Simon Copland, an SBS freelance writer, who thinks that Molyneux disparaged pre-colonisation [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aboriginal]] culture, calling it "very violent", and downplayed massacres perpetrated against Aborigines, saying that the European takeover of Australia had been less violent than other such takeovers, and that the settlers "were trying to stop infanticide and mass rape".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Douglas |title=Far-right Canadian duo's vile rampage against Aboriginal culture at Sydney event |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/nitv/article/2017/07/30/far-right-canadian-duos-vile-rampage-against-aboriginal-culture-sydney-event |accessdate=31 July 2018 |publisher=[[National Indigenous Television]], [[Special Broadcasting Service]] |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molyneux and Southern subsequently traveled to New Zealand for their speaking engagement at [[Auckland]]'s Powerstation theatre. The event was cancelled at the last minute when the Powerstation's owner rescinded the booking, citing opposition from local groups and the offensive content of their speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux's speaking event cancelled |url=https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/08/lauren-southern-and-stefan-molyneux-s-secret-speaking-location-revealed-as-the-powerstation.html |accessdate=3 August 2018 |publisher=[[Newshub]] |date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Truebridge |first1=Nick |last2=Niall |first2=Todd |title=Auckland's Powerstation owner apologises for booking controversial speakers |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/106002242/aucklands-powerstation-owner-apologises-for-booking-controversial-speakers |accessdate=3 August 2018 |publisher=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Auckland venue cancels controversial far-right Canadian pair's speaking event |url=https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/auckland-venue-cancels-controversial-far-right-canadian-pairs-speaking-event |accessdate=3 August 2018 |publisher=[[1 News]] |date=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molyneaux has frequently hosted prominent white supremacists on his podcast, such as Peter Brimelow (founder of the white nationalist website VDare) and Jared Taylor (founder of the white supremacist magazine American Renaissance).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Views ==
=== A Voice for Men ===
Molyneux was a panelist at a 2014 Detroit conference held by the [[men's rights movement]] and [[manosphere]] organization, [[A Voice for Men]]. According to Jessica Roy of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Molyneux argued that violence in the world is the result of how women treat their children, and that "If we could just get people to be nice to their babies for five years straight, that would be it for war, drug abuse, addiction, promiscuity, sexually transmitted diseases, ... Almost all would be completely eliminated, because they all arise from dysfunctional early childhood experiences, which are all run by women."&lt;ref name="men"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roy |first=Jessica |date=July 2, 2014 |title=What I Learned as a Woman at a Men's-Rights Conference |url=http://time.com/2949435/what-i-learned-as-a-woman-at-a-mens-rights-conference/ |newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alt-right ===
Molyneux has been described as a part of the "[[alt-right]]" by ''Politico'', ''Metro'', ''NY Magazine,'' ''Vanity Fair,'' and ''CBS,'' and has been described as "one of the alt-right's biggest YouTube stars" by ''Washington Post'' columnist J. J. McCullough.&lt;ref name="Politico17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Washp17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Metro17&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Adam |date=August 19, 2017 |title=Heartbroken mother describes how she lost her son to alt-right movement |url=https://metro.co.uk/2017/08/19/heartbroken-mother-pens-open-letter-to-son-she-lost-to-alt-right-movement-6864145/ |newspaper=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |access-date=August 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kilgore |first=Ed |date=August 14, 2017 |title=Don’t Look Now, But Alt-Right Demonstrations Are Scheduled for Nine Cities Next Weekend [Update: Now Cancelled] |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/08/alt-right-demonstrations-scheduled-for-9-cities-next-weekend.html |newspaper=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kosoff |first=Maya |date=August 9, 2017 |title=The Fired Google Engineer Is Doubling Down |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/james-damore-google-silicon-valley-culture-war |newspaper=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=August 9, 2017 |title=Fired Google Engineer Who Wrote Controversial Gender Essay Speaks Out |url=http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2017/08/09/google-gender-essay-fired-engineer-james-damore-legal-options/ |publisher=[[KPIX-TV]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Business Insider]]'' and [[BuzzFeed]] have characterized Molyneux as [[far-right]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Tani |first=Maxwell |date=August 23, 2017 |title='UNLIMITED WAR': Breitbart and the far right start to turn on Trump over his Afghanistan decision |url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/far-right-trump-backers-pan-afghanistan-speech-2017-8 |newspaper=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ling |first=Justin |date=January 8, 2018 |title=The Far Right Can’t Decide If The Iran Protests Are A Good Thing, Or A George Soros Deep State Coup |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/justinling/the-far-right-cant-decide-if-the-iran-protests-are-a-good |publisher=[[BuzzFeed]] |access-date=May 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 YouTube video, Molyneux has denied that he identifies with the alt-right movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=S-Wn0J0eC6I|title=What Is The Alt-Right? Vox Day and Stefan Molyneux}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data &amp; Society, a research institute, described Molyneux as "a Canadian talk show host who promotes [[scientific racism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://datasociety.net/output/alternative-influence/|title=Alternative Influence|work=Data &amp; Society|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Family of origin (FOO) relationships ===
Molyneux refers to the family that people are born into as their "family of origin" or "FOO". Molyneux suggests that family of origin relationships may not necessarily be desirable, and in some circumstances may even be detrimental, and thus, for those individuals having suffered abusive childhood relationships, it would be advantageous for them to sever such involuntary relationships as adults, or "deFOO".&lt;ref name=Guardian-2008&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/15/family-relationships-fdr-defoo-cult |title=You will never see me again |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=January 7, 2009 |first=Kate |last=Hilpern |date=November 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, he views all adult relationships as being voluntary and discretionary rather than obligatory. According to a 2008 article in ''[[The Guardian]]'', both Molyneux and his wife have "deFOOed".&lt;ref name=Guardian-2008 /&gt;

=== Stateless society ===
Molyneux theorizes that the pursuit of virtue in our personal lives could bring about a [[stateless society]] that abhors the initiation of force (see [[non-aggression principle]]). In addition, the free market (see [[anarcho-capitalism]]), [[polycentric law|polycentric legal system]]s and private "dispute resolution organizations" (DROs) could be empowered to find new and more peaceful ways of adjudicating [[common law]] infractions and contractual disputes.&lt;ref name=molyneux-DRO&gt;{{cite web|last=Molyneux|first=Stefan|title=The Stateless Society An Examination of Alternatives|url=http://www.lewrockwell.com/2005/10/stefan-molyneux/the-stateless-society-an-examination-of-alternatives/|publisher=[[LewRockwell.com]]|date=October 24, 2005|accessdate= May 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, libertarian philosopher [[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]] gave a critical examination of Molyneux's 2007 ''Universally Preferable Behaviour: A Rational Proof for Secular Ethics'' in ''The Mises Review'', stating, "He fails, and fails miserably. His arguments are often preposterously bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mises.org/daily/6101/The-Molyneux-Problem |title=The Molyneux Problem &amp;#124; Mises Daily |publisher=Mises.org |date=2012-07-04 |accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordon would reply again to Molyneux's own response to the criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/mr-molyneux-responds |title=Mr. Molyneux Responds; Mises Daily |publisher=Mises.org |date=2012-07-11 |accessdate=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White genocide ===
Molyneux believes in the [[White genocide conspiracy theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.radionz.co.nz/news/national/362284/alt-right-speakers-stefan-molyneux-and-lauren-southern-anger-nz-muslims |title=Alt-right speakers Stefan Molyneux and Lauren Southern anger NZ Muslims |publisher=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=20 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2018 interview with [[Lauren Southern]] about [[South African farm attacks|violence against white farmers in South Africa]], he stated that the media and [[NGOs]] were under-reporting the subject because they "don’t want to scare the whites in the west with what happens when whites become a minority in a highly aggressive and tribalised world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=White Farmers Slaughtered in South Africa {{!}} Lauren Southern and Stefan Molyneux |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TfAq3LrIjg&amp;t=1288 |first=Stefan |last= Molyneux |date= February 10, 2018 |publisher= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2018/jul/16/news-corps-promotion-of-lauren-southern-is-disturbing |title=News Corp Australia’s promotion of Lauren Southern is disturbing |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After portrait painter [[Kehinde Wiley]] was chosen to paint [[Barack Obama]]'s [[President Barack Obama (painting)|presidential portrait]], Molyneux called Wiley a "white genocide [[fetish artist]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2018/07/free-speech-group-says-dangerous-precedent-will-be-set-if-they-lose-lawsuit.html |title=Free-speech group says 'dangerous precedent' will be set if they lose lawsuit |publisher=''[[Newshub]]'' |date=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that in 2012 Wiley had created two paintings of black women holding up the severed heads of white women, which Wiley later referred to as "sort of a play on the 'kill [[whitey (slang)|whitey]]' thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=President Obama's Anti-White Racism Portrait Scandal |url=https://www.liveleak.com/view?i=98d_1518555494 |first=Stefan |last=Molyneux |date= February 13, 2018 |publisher=LiveLeak}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kehinde Wiley's Obama portrait controversy proves Americans struggle to engage with art |url= https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/kehinde-wiley-s-obama-portrait-controversy-shows-americans-don-t-ncna849156 |first=Seph |last= Rodney |date= Feb 18, 2018 |publisher=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cult accusations==

According to [[Steven Hassan]], a mental health counselor with experience on cults, "Partly what's going on with the people on the Internet who are indoctrinated, they spend lots of hours on the computer. Videos can have them up all night for several nights in a row. Molyneux knows how to talk like he knows what he's talking about, despite very little academic research. He cites this and cites that, and presents it as the whole truth. It dismantles people's sense of self and replaces it with his sense of confidence about how to fix the world."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Collins, Ben (February 5, 2016). [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/02/05/meet-the-cult-leader-stumping-for-donald-trump.html Meet the 'Cult' Leader Stumping for Donald Trump.] ''The Daily Beast.'' Retrieved: October 12, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Tu Thanh Ha wrote that Molyneux was called the leader of a "therapy cult" following ''Freedomain Radio (FDR)'' community member Tom Bell breaking off all contact with his family.&lt;ref name="Globe-2008" /&gt; In April 2008, Bell had called in to the show asking about his [[veganism]] and his feeling of disgust towards people that eat meat.&lt;ref name="Times-2009"&gt;{{cite news |last=Whipple |first=Tom |date=January 10, 2009 |title=The mother and son torn apart by web 'cult' that destroys families |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-mother-and-son-torn-apart-by-web-cult-that-destroys-families-w8klkzndf50 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |accessdate= August 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molyneux suggested that this disgust could have come from witnessing an authority figure who was cruel to animals.&lt;ref name="Times-2009" /&gt; Bell responded by describing memories of his father being verbally and physically cruel to the family cat, causing him to feel intimidated by the father, and then described his [[emotional detachment]] toward his mother and the rest of his family.&lt;ref name="Times-2009" /&gt;

The following month, Bell left a note stating he no longer wanted contact and left home. It was reported that, of the estimated 50,000 users of the website, about 20 (0.04%) ''FDR'' members had also "deFOOed" (disassociate from family of origin), and that many parents chose not to speak to the media in an effort to avoid alienating their children further.&lt;ref name=Times-2009 /&gt; A representative of the British [[Cult Information Centre]] said they were following ''FDR'', and noted that one sign of cults was that they cut people off from their families. Molyneux responded by saying, "If I advised a wife to leave an abusive husband, there would not be articles about how I am a cult leader."&lt;ref name="Times-2009" /&gt;

Molyneux and FOO were subjects of an investigative documentary by [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] in the [[United Kingdom]], which aired on August 20, 2015.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.channel5.com/shows/trapped-in-a-cult |title=Trapped In A Cult? |publisher=Channel 5 |date=2015-08-20 |accessdate=2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wyatt |first=Daisy |date=August 20, 2015 |title= Trapped in a Cult? – TV review: Disappointing Channel 5 shock-doc fails to come up to scratch |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/trapped-in-a-cult-tv-review-disappointing-channel-5-shock-doc-fails-to-come-up-to-scratch-10464473.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |access-date= November 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molyneux and "deFOOing" were one of three subjects featured on the February 18, 2016 episode of the documentary series ''[[Dark Net (TV series)|Dark Net]]''. The episode calls ''Freedomain Radio'' a cult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sho.com/dark-net/season/1/episode/5/trapped |title=Dark Net – Season 1, Episode 5 |website= Showtime |accessdate= 12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a compliment to analyses of production and its processes, '''Sustainable Consumption''' (SC) is the study of resource and energy use (domestic or otherwise). As the term sustainability would imply, those who study SC seek to apply the concept of “continuance”—the capacity to meet both present and future human generational needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Paul Ekins|last2=Newby|first2=Les|date=1998|title=Sustainable Wealth Creation At The Local Level In An Age Of Globalization|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00343409850118013|journal=Regional Studies|language=en|volume=32|issue=9|pages=863–871|doi=10.1080/00343409850118013|issn=0034-3404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15489268|title=Our common future|date=1987|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=World Commission on Environment and Development.|isbn=019282080X|location=Oxford|oclc=15489268}}&lt;/ref&gt; SC, then, would also include analyses of efficiency, infrastructure, and waste, as well as access to basic services, green and decent jobs and a better quality of life for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/|title=Sustainable consumption and production|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shares a number of common features with and is closely linked to the terms [[Sustainable product development|sustainable production]] and [[sustainable development]]. Sustainable consumption as part of [[sustainable development]] is a prerequisite in the worldwide struggle against [[sustainability]] challenges such as [[climate change]], [[resource depletion]], famines or [[environmental pollution]].

Sustainable development as well as sustainable consumption rely on certain premises such as:

* Effective [[resource use|use of resources]], and minimisation of [[waste]] and [[pollution]]
* Use of [[renewable resource]]s within their capacity for renewal
* Fuller [[product life-cycle]]s
* [[Intergenerational equity|Intergenerational]] and intragenerational equity

==The Oslo definition==
The definition proposed by the 1994 Oslo Symposium on Sustainable Consumption defines it as "the use of services and related products which respond to basic needs and bring a better [[quality of life]] while minimizing the use of natural resources and toxic materials as well as emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardize the needs of future generations."&lt;ref&gt;Source: Norwegian Ministry of the Environment (1994) Oslo Roundtable on Sustainable Production and Consumption.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strong and weak sustainable consumption ==
{{tone|section|date=October 2017|reason=should be rephrased as encyclopedic definition, not as action plan from the proponents' PoV. Also, who coined these terms?}}
In order to achieve sustainable consumption, two developments have to take place: it requires both an increase in the efficiency of consumption as well as a change in consumption patterns and reductions in consumption levels in industrialized countries as well as rich social classes in developing countries which have also a large ecological footprint and give examples for increasing middle classes in developing countries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009|editor-last=Meier|editor-first=Lars|editor2-last=Lange|editor2-first=Hellmuth|title=The New Middle Classes|url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-1-4020-9938-0|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-9938-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The first prerequisite is not sufficient on its own and can be named weak sustainable consumption. Here, technological improvements and [[eco-efficiency]] support a necessary reduction in [[resource consumption]]. Once this aim has been met, the second prerequisite, the change in patterns and reduction of levels of consumption is indispensable. Strong sustainable consumption approaches also pay attention to the social dimension of [[well-being]] and assess the need for changes based on a risk-averse perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lorek|first1=Sylvia|last2=Fuchs|first2=Doris|title=Strong Sustainable Consumption Governance - Precondition for a Degrowth Path?|journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|date=2013|volume=38|pages=36–43|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2011.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve what can be termed strong sustainable consumption, changes in infrastructures as well as the choices customers have are required. In the political arena, weak sustainable consumption has been discussed whereas strong sustainable consumption is missing from all debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fuchs|first1=Doris|last2=Lorek|first2=Sylvia|title=Sustainable Consumption Governance: A History of Promises and Failures|journal=Journal of Consumer Policy|date=2005|volume=28|pages=261–288|doi=10.1007/s10603-005-8490-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called [[Attitude-behavior gap|attitude-behaviour]] or [[values-action gap]] describes a significant obstacle to changes in individual customer behavior. Many consumers are well aware of the importance of their consumption choices and care about environmental issues, however, most of them do not translate their concerns into their consumption patterns as the purchase-decision making process is highly complicated and relies on e.g. social, political and psychological factors. Young et al. identified a lack of time for research, high prices, a lack of information and the cognitive effort needed as the main barriers when it comes to [[green consumption]] choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Young|first1=William|title=Sustainable Consumption: Green Consumer Behaviour when Purchasing Products|journal=Sustainable Development|date=2010|issue=18|pages=20–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable conferences and programs==

*1992 - At the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) the concept of sustainable consumption was established in chapter 4 of the Agenda 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=United Nations|title=Agenda 21|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/Agenda21.pdf|format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*1994 - Sustainable Consumption Symposium in Oslo

*2002 – A ten-year program on sustainable consumption and production (SCP) was created in the Plan of Implementation at the [[Earth Summit 2002|World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD) in Johannesburg.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations (UN) (2002) Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development. In ''Report of the World Summit on Sustainable Development'', UN Document A/CONF.199/20*, New York: UN.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14419">'''The Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale (PIWBS)''' is a [[self-report inventory]] with a [[Likert scale]] format, designed to assess five distinct dimensions of [[Personal identity|identity]] and [[subjective well-being]] among Pacific populations in [[New Zealand]]:
# Group Membership Evaluation
# Pacific Connectedness and Belonging
# Religious Centrality and Embeddedness
# Perceived Familial Wellbeing
# Perceived Societal Wellbeing

The PIWBS was developed by Sam Manuela, a doctoral candidate at [[The University of Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;Manuela, S. (2010). The Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale. Published master’s thesis. The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manuela, S. &amp; Sibley, C. G. (2012). The Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale (PIWBS): A Culturally-Appropriate Self Report Measure for Pacific Peoples in New Zealand. Social Indicators Research, 1, 83-103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manuela, S. &amp; Sibley, C. G (2012). Why Do Pacific People with Multiple Ethnic Affiliations Have Poorer Subjective Wellbeing? Negative Ingroup Affect Mediates the Identity Tension Effect. Social Indicators Research, 1, 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The scale aims to provide a culturally sensitive, valid and reliable [[self-report inventory]] of Pacific identity and [[subjective well-being]] which aids the understanding and predicting of Pacific outcomes. The measure contributes to Pacific studies by providing a [[quantitative research|quantitative]], within-cultural research tool for Pacific peoples from a Pacific perspective. The PIWBS is associated with the [[New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study]].

The dimensions, Group Membership Evaluation, Pacific Connectedness and Belonging, and Religious Centrality and Embeddness all relate to identity. Answers to questions relating to identity are rated on a [[Likert scale]] ranging from 1 to 7 (1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree). The dimensions, Perceived Familial Wellbeing and Perceived Societal Wellbeing both relate to wellbeing. Answers to questions relating to [[wellbeing]] are rated on a [[Likert scale]] ranging from 1 to 7 (1 = completely dissatisfied and 7 = completely satisfied).

==The Five Dimensions==

===1. Group Membership Evaluation (GME)===

This factor reflects subjective evaluations of membership within the Pacific group. Positive group evaluations are shown through pride in one's [[ethnic identity]] and [[culture]],&lt;ref&gt;Mila-Schaaf, K., Robinson, E., Schaaf, D., Denny, S., &amp; Watson, P. D. (2008). A health profile of Pacific youth: Findings of youth 2000. A National Secondary School Youth Health Survey. Auckland: University of Auckland.&lt;/ref&gt; and represent a secure ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;Anae, M. (1998). Fofoa-i-vao-’ese: The identity journeys of NZ-born Samoans. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt; This factor includes an evaluation of positive effect brought about by Pacific group membership, and an evaluation of the extent to which one's Pacific identity is seen as a central and defining aspect of [[self-concept]]. High scores on this factor would indicate that positive/worthwhile feelings are derived from Pacific identification, and that affiliation with a Pacific group is seen as a desirable aspect of self-concept and is central to identity.

====Sample Group Membership Evaluation Items====

* The fact that I am an Islander is an important part of my identity
* Being an Islander is an important part of how I see myself
* I am glad to be a Pacific Islander
* I am proud to be a Pacific Islander
* Being a Pacific Islander gives me a good feeling

====2. Pacific Connectedness and Belonging (PCB)====
This factor is a measure of an individual's sense of [[belongingness|belonging]] and connectedness with Pacific others and groups. These feelings derive from shared experiences and commonalities and are particularly apparent among youth,.&lt;ref&gt;Macpherson, C. (1996). Pacific Islands identity and community. In P. Spoonley, D. Pearson, &amp; C. Macpherson (Eds.), Nga Patai: Racism and ethnic relations in Aotearoa/New Zealand (pp. 124–143). Palmerston North, NZ: Dunmore Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anae, M. (1998). Fofoa-i-vao-’ese: The identity journeys of NZ-born Samoans. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tiatia, J. (1998). Caught between cultures: A New Zealand-born Pacific Island perspective. Auckland: Christian Research Association.&lt;/ref&gt; This factor, which assesses the extent to which the individual believes the self to be an integral part of a Pacific group, is made up of two distinct dimensions. The first dimension concerns perceived connections/relationships with others, and the second dimension concerns an individual's subjective sense of belonging at a broader level. High scores on this factor would indicate that the individual feels similar to Pacific others, and perceives themselves to be an integral member of the wider, general group, and have a feeling of belonging.

=====Sample Pacific Connectedness and Belonging Items=====
* I feel at home around other Islanders, even if they are not from my Island
* I feel comfortable in places with lots of other Pacific peoples
* I don’t get along with other island groups (reverse coded)
* I feel connected to other Pacific peoples in general
* I feel connected to people from a different Pacific Island to myself
* I feel most comfortable in Pacific communities

====3. Religious Centrality and Embeddedness (RCE)====
This factor assesses the individual's evaluation of the extent to which [[religion]] is central to their identity as Pacific, and the extent to which they believe religion to be entwined with Pacific [[culture]]. [[Religion]] is an important aspect of Pacific identity, having a huge influence on many Pacific communities by providing social connections and support, and fulfilling cultural and religious needs.&lt;ref&gt;Anae, M. (2001). The New Vikings of the sunrise: New Zealand-born in the information age. In P. Spoonley, C. Macpherson, &amp; M. Anae (Eds.), Tagata o te Moana Nui: The evolving identities of Pacific peoples in Aotearoa, New Zealand (pp. 89–101). Palmerston North, NZ: Dunmore Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tiatia, J. (1998). Caught between cultures: A New Zealand-born Pacific Island perspective. Ellerslie, Auckland: Christian Research Association.&lt;/ref&gt; This factor focuses on [[Christianity]]-based religions which are the most common in Pacific societies. High scores on this factor would indicate that the individual feels that [[Christianity]]-based religion is a central aspect of self-identity, and is strongly linked to their Pacific [[culture]].

=====Sample Religious Centrality and Embeddedness Items=====
* Going to Church is part of my culture and religion
* God has a strong connection to my culture
* Religion is not important for my culture (reverse coded)
* Part of being a Pacific Islander is having a connection with God
* Religion is the root of our Pasifika culture
* Our religion is the centre of our culture as Pacific Islanders

====4. Perceived Familial Wellbeing (PFW)====
This factor assesses the individual's subjective satisfaction with their family, and the [[subjective well-being]] of and within their family. Family offers [[Human body|physical]], mental, [[cultural]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[social]] nurturance, and is an integral aspect of Pacific [[self-concept]], closely tied to wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;Tamasese, K., Peteru, C., &amp; Waldegrave, C. (1997). O le Taeo Afua—The new morning: A qualitative investigation into Samoan perspectives on mental health and culturally appropriate services. Wellington: The Family Centre &amp; NZ Health Research Council.&lt;/ref&gt; This factor assesses a variety of Pacific family values including [[respect]], [[communication]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] and [[happiness]]. High scores in this factor would indicate that the individual feels a strong sense of [[social support|support]] from their family, and that the individual perceives their family as a whole to have a high level of wellbeing.

=====Sample Perceived Familial Wellbeing Items=====
* Your relationship with your parents
* Your family's security
* The respect you give for your parents
* The respect you receive from your family
* Your position in your family
* Your family's happiness
* Communication with your family

====5. Perceived Societal Wellbeing (PSW)====
This factor reflects the individual's [[Contentment|satisfaction]] with [[society]] and the [[social support|support]] it offers. Satisfaction with society has a strong influence on the subjective wellbeing of Pacific people.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health. (1995). Pacific Islands peoples’ understanding of mental health. Strategic directions for the mental health services for Pacific Islands people. Wellington: Ministry of Health.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kupa, K. (2009). Te Vaka Atafaga: a Tokelau assessment model for supporting holistic mental health practice with Tokelau people in Aotearoa, New Zealand. Pacific Health Dialog, 15, 156–163.&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived support from society is assessed on various levels, from the local community level to the national government level and responses indicate how supported and integrated the Pacific individual feels in New Zealand. High scores on this factor would indicate that the individual feels satisfied, supported and accepted by all levels of New Zealand society.

=====Sample Perceived Societal Wellbeing Items=====
* Support provided to you by the New Zealand government to you as a Pacific Islander
* Your position in New Zealand as a Pacific person
* Your personal needs being met by New Zealand
* The support you receive as a Pacific Islander in the community you live in
* Your relationship with New Zealand society
* The support you receive in the community you live in
* The support you receive as a Pacific Islander in New Zealand

==Validation of the PIWBS==

The Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale was developed and validated using [[exploratory factor analysis]] (EFA) and [[confirmatory factor analysis]] (CFA).  The initial pool of 125 questions was developed based on previous Pacific research, a variety of other wellbeing and identity scales, discussions with Pacific peoples and the [[Multi-dimensional Model of Maori Identity and Cultural Engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;Houkamau, C. A., &amp; Sibley, C. G. (2010). The multi-dimensional model of Maori identity and cultural engagement. New Zealand Journal of Psychology, 39, 8–25.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Exploratory factor analysis]] (EFA) was conducted to organise the 125 possible questions into groups (factors) based on similarity of topic. Individual items that did not fit a group well or that related to more than one group were not used. Thirty-one questions were retained which were found to measure the five distinct, yet interconnected factors of Pacific identity and wellbeing. [[Confirmatory factor analysis]] (CFA) was later used to confirm the structure of the PIWBS. All 31 items were found to be strongly related to the predicted factors. 
[[Cronbach's alpha]] (internal reliability) measures the extent to which all the questions in a section measure the same construct/factor consistently. The five factors of the PIWBS showed excellent internal reliability, with [[Cronbach's alpha]]s all above α = 0.85. The minimum accepted standard of internal reliability is α = 0.70. 

The PIWBS has been used in several studies to investigate the low levels of [[subjective well-being]] found among Pacific peoples who identify with multiple [[ethnic group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Manuela, S. &amp; Sibley, C. G (2012). Why Do Pacific People with Multiple Ethnic Affiliations Have Poorer Subjective Wellbeing? Negative Ingroup Affect Mediates the Identity Tension Effect. Social Indicators Research, 1, 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Differences were found in levels of [[subjective well-being]] depending on the number of ethnic groups the individual associated with. For example, people who identified only as Pacific had higher levels of wellbeing than people who identified as both Pacific and non-Pacific (e.g. New Zealand European). However, there were no differences in wellbeing levels between people who identified as only Pacific, and people who identified with two Pacific groups (e.g. [[Tongans|Tongan]] and [[Samoans|Samoan]]). This suggests that lower wellbeing only occurred when the two [[ethnic group]]s associated with, were very different (e.g. Pacific and New Zealand European).

Identity Tension Effect: Associating with both a Pacific group and a majority ethnic group (e.g. [[New Zealand European]]) may lead to negative feelings about Pacific aspects of [[Personal identity|identity]]. This is because people who identify with multiple [[ethnic group]]s tend to be more likely to [[internalise]] negative [[stereotypes]] about Pacific people held by the majority. This can lead to identity confusion and lowered [[self-esteem]]. 

[[Population projection]]s suggest that the Pacific community will grow by 60% by 2026.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Social Development. (2008). Diverse communities: Exploring the refugee and migrant experience in New Zealand. Wellington, NZ: Ministry of Social Development.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately one third of Pacific people identify as both Pacific and non-Pacific. This means that a growing percentage of the New Zealand population may be at risk of a number of negative outcomes. These outcomes include both lower [[self-esteem]], as well as decreased feelings of support from family. Through applied research interventions such as challenging negative [[stereotype]]s and promoting positive [[stereotype]]s about Pacific peoples, it may be possible to address this problem.

A '''van der Corput sequence''' is an example of the simplest one-dimensional  [[low-discrepancy sequence]] over the [[unit interval]]; it was first described in 1935 by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] mathematician [[Johannes van der Corput|J. G. van der Corput]].  It is constructed by reversing the [[base (exponentiation)|base-''n'' representation]] of the sequence of [[natural number]]s (1, 2, 3, …).

The ''b''-ary representation of the positive integer ''n'' (≥ 1) is
:&lt;math&gt;
n=\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}d_k(n)b^k,
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''b'' is the base in which the number ''n'' is represented, and 0 ≤ ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') &lt; ''b'', i.e. the ''k''-th digit in the ''b''-ary expansion of ''n''.
The ''n''-th number in the van der Corput sequence is
:&lt;math&gt;
g_b(n)=\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}d_k(n)b^{-k-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples ==
For example, to get the [[decimal]] van der Corput sequence, we start by dividing the numbers 1 to 9 in tenths (''x''/10), then we change the denominator to 100 to begin dividing in hundredths (''x''/100). In terms of numerator, we begin with all two-digit numbers from 10 to 99, but in '''backwards''' order of digits. Consequently, we will get the numerators grouped by the end digit. Firstly, all two-digit numerators that end with 1, so the next numerators are 01, 11, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 91. Then the numerators ending with 2, so they are 02, 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, 62, 72, 82, 92. An after the numerators ending in 3: 03, 13, 23 and so on...

Thus, the sequence begins

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{ \tfrac{1}{10}, \tfrac{2}{10}, \tfrac{3}{10}, \tfrac{4}{10}, \tfrac{5}{10}, \tfrac{6}{10}, \tfrac{7}{10}, \tfrac{8}{10}, \tfrac{9}{10}, \tfrac{1}{100}, \tfrac{11}{100}, \tfrac{21}{100}, \tfrac{31}{100}, \tfrac{41}{100}, \tfrac{51}{100}, \tfrac{61}{100}, \tfrac{71}{100}, \tfrac{81}{100}, \tfrac{91}{100}, \tfrac{2}{100}, \tfrac{12}{100}, \tfrac{22}{100}, \tfrac{32}{100}, \ldots \right\},&lt;/math&gt;

or in floating-point representation:

:0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.01, 0.11, 0.21, 0.31, 0.41, 0.51, 0.61, 0.71, 0.81, 0.91, 0.02, 0.12, 0.22, 0.32, …,

The same can be done for the [[binary numeral system]], and the binary van der Corput sequence is

:0.1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.01&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.11&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.0001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.1001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.0101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.1101&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.0011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.1011&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.0111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0.1111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, …

or, equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}, \tfrac{1}{4}, \tfrac{3}{4}, \tfrac{1}{8}, \tfrac{5}{8}, \tfrac{3}{8}, \tfrac{7}{8}, \tfrac{1}{16}, \tfrac{9}{16}, \tfrac{5}{16}, \tfrac{13}{16}, \tfrac{3}{16}, \tfrac{11}{16}, \tfrac{7}{16}, \tfrac{15}{16}, \ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

The elements of the van der Corput sequence (in any base) form a [[dense set]] in the unit interval; that is, for any real number in [0, 1], there exists a [[subsequence]] of the van der Corput sequence that [[limit of a sequence|converges]] to that number.  They are also [[equidistributed]] over the unit interval.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20707">The '''von Neumann–Wigner interpretation''', also described as "'''consciousness causes collapse''' [of the wave function]", is an [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] in which [[consciousness]] is postulated to be necessary for the completion of the process of [[measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement]].

== Background: observation in quantum mechanics ==
In the orthodox [[Copenhagen interpretation]], quantum mechanics predicts only the probabilities for different outcomes of pre-specified observations. What constitutes an "observer" or an "observation" is not directly specified by the theory, and the behavior of a system upon observation is completely different than its usual behavior: the wavefunction that describes a system spreads out into an ever-larger superposition of different possible situations. However, during observation, the wavefunction describing the system collapses to one of several options. If there is no observation, this collapse does not occur, and none of the options ever becomes less likely.

It can be predicted using quantum mechanics, absent a collapse postulate, that an observer observing a quantum superposition will turn into a superposition of different observers seeing different things. The observer will have a wavefunction which describes all the possible outcomes. Still, in actual experience, an observer never senses a superposition, but always senses that one of the outcomes has occurred with certainty. This apparent conflict between a wavefunction description and classical experience is called the problem of observation (see [[Measurement problem]]).

== The interpretation ==

In his 1932 book ''The Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics'', [[John von Neumann]] argued that the mathematics of quantum mechanics allows the [[Wave function collapse|collapse of the wave function]] to be placed at any position in the causal chain from the measurement device to the "subjective perception" of the human observer.  In 1939, [[Fritz London]] and Edmond Bauer argued for the latter boundary (consciousness).&lt;ref&gt;F. London and E. Bauer, "La théorie de l’observation en mécanique quantique" (1939), English translation in ''Quantum Theory and Measurement'', edited by J. A. Wheeler and W. H. Zurek, Princeton University, Princeton, 1983, pp. 217–259.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s, [[Eugene Wigner]]&lt;ref name="Wigner"&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1119/1.1973829| volume = 35| issue = 12| pages = 1169–1170| last = Wigner| first = Eugene| author2 = Henry Margenau| title = Remarks on the Mind Body Question, in Symmetries and Reflections, Scientific Essays| journal = American Journal of Physics| accessdate = 2009-07-30| date = 1967| url = http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/35/1169/1| bibcode = 1967AmJPh..35.1169W| archive-url = https://archive.is/20130112081842/http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/35/1169/1| archive-date = 2013-01-12| dead-url = yes| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; reformulated the "[[Schrödinger's cat]]" [[thought experiment]] as "[[Wigner's friend]]" and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line that precipitates collapse of the wave function, independent of any realist interpretation.  See [[Wigner's friend#Consciousness and measurement|Consciousness and measurement]]. The non-physical mind is postulated to be the only true measurement apparatus.&lt;ref name=Schreiber&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9501014v5 Schreiber, Z. ''The Nine Lives of Schrödingers's Cat''].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Rudolf Peierls]] was also a proponent of this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;P. C. W. Davies and J. R. Brown (editors), ''The Ghost in the Atom'', Cambridge University Press, 1986, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

This interpretation has been summarized thus:&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The rules of quantum mechanics are correct but there is only one system which may be treated with quantum mechanics, namely the entire material world. There exist external observers which cannot be treated within quantum mechanics, namely human (and perhaps animal) ''minds'', which perform [[quantum measurement|measurement]]s on the brain causing wave function collapse.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Henry Stapp]] has argued for the concept as follows:&lt;ref name="Stapp2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=H. Stapp |title=Quantum Theory and the Role of Mind in Nature |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=31 |issue=10 |pages=1465–1499 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/A:1012682413597|arxiv=quant-ph/0103043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
From the point of view of the mathematics of quantum theory it makes no sense to treat a measuring device as intrinsically different from the collection of atomic constituents that make it up. A device is just another part of the physical universe...  Moreover, the conscious thoughts of a human observer ought to be causally connected ''most directly and immediately'' to what is happening in his brain, not to what is happening out at some measuring device...  Our bodies and brains thus become ... parts of the quantum mechanically described physical universe. Treating the entire physical universe in this unified way provides a conceptually simple and logically coherent theoretical foundation...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Objections to the interpretation ==

There are other possible solutions to the "Wigner's friend" thought experiment, which do not require consciousness to be different from other physical processes.  Moreover, Wigner actually shifted to those interpretations (and away from "consciousness causes collapse") in his later years. This was partly because he was embarrassed that "consciousness causes collapse" can lead to a kind of [[solipsism]], but also because he decided that he had been wrong to try to apply quantum physics at the scale of everyday life (specifically, he rejected his initial idea of treating macroscopic objects as isolated systems).&lt;ref name=Esfeld&gt;Michael Esfeld, (1999), [http://www.unil.ch/webdav/site/philo/shared/DocsPerso/EsfeldMichael/1999/SHPMP99.pdf Essay Review: Wigner’s View of Physical Reality], published in Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics, 30B, pp. 145–154, Elsevier Science Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Wigner's friend#Consciousness and Superposition|Consciousness and Superposition]].

To many scientists this interpretation fails to compete with other [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]] because "consciousness causes collapse" relies upon an [[Interactionism (philosophy of mind)|interactionist]] form of [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] that is inconsistent with the [[materialism]] presupposed by many physicists.&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt; The [[measurement problem]] notwithstanding, they point to a [[Causal closure|causal closure of physics]], suggesting a problem with how consciousness and matter might interact, reminiscent of objections to Descartes' [[substance dualism]].

{{quote|The only form of [[interactionist dualism]] that has seemed even remotely tenable in the contemporary picture is one that exploits certain properties of quantum mechanics. There are two ways this might go. First, some [e.g., [[How the Self Controls Its Brain|Eccles 1986&amp;#x5D;]] have appealed to the existence of [[quantum indeterminacy]], and have suggested that a nonphysical consciousness might be responsible for filling the resultant causal gaps, [[determinism|determining]] which values some physical magnitudes might take within an apparently "[[probabilistic]]" distribution… This is an audacious and interesting suggestion, but it has a number of problems… A second way in which quantum mechanics bears on the issue of [[causal closure]] lies with the fact that in some [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretations of the quantum formalism]], consciousness itself plays a vital causal role, being required to bring about the so-called "[[wave function collapse|collapse of the wave-function]]." This collapse is supposed to occur upon any act of [[measurement in quantum mechanics|measurement]]; and in one interpretation, the only way to distinguish a measurement from a nonmeasurement is via the presence of consciousness. This theory is certainly not universally accepted (for a start, it ''presupposes'' that consciousness is not itself [[physicalism|physical]], surely contrary to the views of most physicists), and I do not accept it myself, but in any case it seems that the kind of causal work consciousness performs here is quite different from the kind required for consciousness to play a role in [[free will|directing behavior]]… In any case, all versions of interactionist dualism have a conceptual problem that suggests that they are less successful in avoiding [[epiphenomenalism]] than they might seem; or at least they are no better off than &amp;#x5B;[[naturalistic dualism]]&amp;#x5D;. Even on these views, there is a sense in which the [[phenomenalism|phenomenal]] is irrelevant. We can always subtract the phenomenal component from any explanatory account, yielding a purely [[causality|causal]] component.&lt;ref name="Chalmers1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Chalmers |year=1996 |title=The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory |series=Philosophy of Mind Series |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=978-0-19-983935-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtgiH-feUyIC&amp;pg=PA156 |pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[David Chalmers]]|"The Irreducibility of Consciousness" in ''The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory''}}

The interpretation has also been criticized for not explaining which things have sufficient consciousness to collapse the wave function. Also, it posits an important role for the conscious mind, and it has been questioned how this could be the case for the earlier universe, before consciousness had evolved or emerged.  It has been argued that "[consciousness causes collapse] does not allow sensible discussion of [[Big Bang]] cosmology or biological [[evolution]]".&lt;ref name=Schreiber/&gt; For example, [[Roger Penrose]] remarked: "[T]he evolution of conscious life on this planet is due to appropriate mutations having taken place at various times.  These, presumably, are quantum events, so they would exist only in linearly superposed form until they finally led to the evolution of a conscious being—whose very existence depends on all the right mutations having 'actually' taken place!"&lt;ref&gt;R. Penrose, ''The Emperor's New Mind'', Penguin Books, 1989, p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others further suppose a universal mind (see also [[panpsychism]] and [[panexperientialism]]). To most physicists{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}, this merely pushes the problem back, which some see as a fatal [[Occam's razor|unparsimonious]] move in a competition with [[interpretations of quantum mechanics|other theories]].

Recently, it has been argued that the results of [[delayed-choice quantum eraser]] experiments preclude this interpretation.&lt;ref name=Yu_and_Nikolic&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yu S., Nikolić D. | year = 2011 | title = Quantum mechanics needs no consciousness | url = http://www.danko-nikolic.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Yu-and-Nikolic-Qm-and-consciousness-Annalen-Physik.pdf | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 523 | issue = 11| pages = 931–938 | doi = 10.1002/andp.201100078|bibcode = 2011AnP...523..931Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the experiment has also been used to argue for support of this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0610241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4834&lt;/ref&gt;  Other researchers have expressed similar objections to the introduction of any subjective element in the collapse of the wavefunction.&lt;ref name=Mandel&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mandel L. | year = 1999 | title = Quantum effects in one-photon and two-photon interference | journal = Rev.

== Reception ==

A poll was conducted at a quantum mechanics conference in 2011 using 33 participants (including physicists, mathematicians, and philosophers). Researchers found that 6% of participants (2 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer "plays a distinguished physical role (e.g., wave-function collapse by consciousness)". This poll also states that 55% (18 of the 33) indicated that they believed the observer "plays a fundamental role in the application of the formalism but plays no distinguished physical role". They also mention that "Popular accounts have sometimes suggested that the Copenhagen interpretation attributes such a role to consciousness. In our view, this is to misunderstand the Copenhagen interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. Schlosshauer |author2=J. Koer |author3=A.

=== Views of the pioneers of quantum mechanics ===

Many of the originators of quantum mechanical theory held that humans can effectively interrogate nature through interacting with it, and that in this regard quantum mechanics is not different from [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Wiley| last = Bohr| first = Niels| title = Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge| year = 1958}}, pp. 73, 81: "The freedom of experimentation, presupposed in classical physics, is of course retained and corresponds to the free choice of experimental arrangement for which the mathematical structure of the quantum mechanical formalism offers the appropriate latitude.  ...  In the great drama of existence we ourselves are both actors and spectators.”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper &amp; Row| last = Heisenberg| first = Werner| title = Physics and Philosophy| year = 1958}}, p. 32: "[T]he measuring device has been constructed by the observer, and we have to remember that what we observe is not nature in itself but nature exposed to our method of questioning."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Dialectica |author=Wolfgang Pauli| title= Naturwissenschaftliche und erkenntnistheoretische Aspekte der Ideen vom Unbewussten| volume=8| pages=283–301| year= 1954| doi=10.1111/j.1746-8361.1954.tb01265.x}} as translated in Harald Atmanspacher and Hans Primas, ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 13(3), 5-50 (2006):  "Pauli’s ideas on mind and matter in the context of contemporary science": “Once the physical observer has chosen his experimental arrangement, he has no further influence on the result which is objectively registered and generally accessible. Subjective properties of the observer or his psychological state are as irrelevant in the quantum mechanical laws of nature as in classical physics.”&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Werner Heisenberg maintained that [[wave function collapse]], "The discontinuous change in the probability function", takes place when the result of a measurement is registered in the mind of an observer. However, this is because he understood the probability function as an artifact of human knowledge: he also argued that the reality of the material transition from "possible" to "actual" was mind-independent. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Harper &amp; Row| last = Heisenberg| first = Werner| title = Physics and Philosophy| year = 1958}}, p. 28. ("The transition from the 'possible' to the 'actual' takes place  as soon as the interaction of the object with the measuring device, and thereby the rest of the world, has come into play; it is not connected with the act of registration of the result by the mind of the observer.   The discontinuous change in the probability function, however, takes place with the act of registration, because it is the discontinuous change of our knowledge in the instant of registration that has its image in the discontinuous change of the probability function.")&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Albert Einstein]], who believed in [[philosophical realism|realism]], and did not accept the theoretical completeness of quantum mechanics, similarly appealed for the merely epistemic conception of the wave function:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“[I advocate] that one conceives of the psi-function [i.e., wavefunction] only as an incomplete description of a real state of affairs, where the incompleteness of the description is forced by the fact that observation of the state is only able to grasp part of the real factual situation. Then one can at least escape the singular conception that observation (conceived as an act of consciousness) influences the real physical state of things; the change in the psi-function through observation then does not correspond essentially to the change in a real matter of fact but rather to the alteration in ''our knowledge'' of this matter of fact.”&lt;ref&gt;A. Einstein to W. Heitler, 1948, translated in A. Fine, ''Einstein’s Interpretations of Quantum Theory'' p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heisenberg and Bohr described quantum mechanics in [[logical positivism|logical positivist]] terms. Bohr also took an active interest in the philosophical implications of quantum theories such as his [[complementarity (physics)|complementarity]], for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Zygon: Journal of Religion &amp; Science |author=John Honner |title= Niels Bohr and the Mysticism of Nature |volume=17-3 |pages=243–253 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed quantum theory offers a complete description of nature, albeit one that is simply ill-suited for everyday experiences - which are better described by classical mechanics and probability. Bohr never specified a demarcation line above which objects cease to be quantum and become classical. He believed that it was not a question of physics, but one of philosophy or convenience.&lt;ref name="Bohr1928"&gt;{{cite journal| journal= Nature |author=Niels Bohr| title= The Quantum Postulate and the Recent Development of Atomic Theory| volume=121 |pages=580–590| year= 1928 |url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v121/n3050/abs/121580a0.html | doi=10.1038/121580a0|bibcode = 1928Natur.121..580B }} ": "[T]he quantum postulate implies that any observation of atomic phenomena will involve an interaction with the agency of observation not to be neglected. Accordingly, an independent reality in the ordinary physical sense can neither be ascribed to the phenomena nor to the agencies of observation.  After all, the concept of observation is in so far arbitrary as it depends upon which objects are included in the system to be observed.  Ultimately, every observation can, of course, be reduced to our sense perceptions.  The circumstance, however, that in interpreting observations use has always to be made of theoretical notions entails that for every particular case it is a question of convenience at which point the concept of observation involving the quantum postulate with its inherent "irrationality" is brought in."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yoko Ono''' ({{lang-ja|小野 洋子|Ono Yōko}}, &lt;small&gt;usually spelled in [[katakana]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|ja|オノ・ヨーコ}}; born February 18, 1933) is a Japanese [[multimedia artist]], [[singer]], [[songwriter]], and [[Peace movement|peace activist]] who is also known for her work in [[performance art]] and [[filmmaking]].&lt;ref name="my.entertainment.yahoo.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://my.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/yoko-ono-retrospective-opens-frankfurt-164740038.html|title=Yoko Ono retrospective opens in Frankfurt|date=February 16, 2013|publisher=Yahoo Malaysia|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912052307/http://my.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/yoko-ono-retrospective-opens-frankfurt-164740038.html|archivedate=September 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She performs in both [[English language|English]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. She is known for having been the second wife of [[singer-songwriter]] [[John Lennon]] of [[the Beatles]].

Ono grew up in [[Tokyo]] and also spent several years in [[New York City]]. She studied at Gakushuin University, but withdrew from her course after two years and moved to New York in 1953 to live with her family. She spent some time at [[Sarah Lawrence College]] and then became involved in [[New York City]]'s [[downtown]] artists scene, which included the [[Fluxus]] group. She first met Lennon in 1966 at her own [[art exhibition]] in [[London]], and they became a [[Couple (relationship)|couple]] in 1968 and wed the following year. With their [[Performance art|performance]] [[Bed-In|''Bed-Ins for Peace'']] in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Montreal]] in 1969, Ono and Lennon famously used their [[honeymoon]] at the [[Hilton Amsterdam]] as a stage for public [[protests against the Vietnam War]]. The [[feminism|feminist]] themes of her music have influenced musicians as diverse as the [[B-52s]] and [[Meredith Monk]]. She achieved commercial and critical acclaim in 1980 with the chart-topping album ''[[Double Fantasy]]'', a collaboration with Lennon that was released three weeks before [[Murder of John Lennon|his murder]].

[[File:Yoko Ono 4 - Echo of Moscow.jpg|thumb|Ono at a conference, 2007]]
Public appreciation of Ono's work has shifted over time and was helped by a [[retrospective]] at a [[Whitney Museum]] branch in 1989 and the 1992 release of the six-disc [[box set]] ''[[Onobox]].'' Retrospectives of her artwork have also been presented at the [[Japan Society (Manhattan)|Japan Society]] in [[New York City]] in 2001, in [[Bielefeld]], Germany, and the UK in 2008, [[Frankfurt]], and [[Bilbao]], [[Spain]], in 2013 and [[The Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City in 2015. She received a [[Golden Lion Award]] for lifetime achievement from the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2009 and the 2012 [[Oskar Kokoschka]] Prize, Austria's highest award for applied contemporary art.

As Lennon's widow, Ono works to preserve his legacy. She funded [[Strawberry Fields memorial|Strawberry Fields]] in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Central Park]], the [[Imagine Peace Tower]] in [[Iceland]], and the [[John Lennon Museum]] in [[Saitama, Saitama|Saitama]], Japan (which closed in 2010). She has made significant philanthropic contributions to the arts, [[peace]], [[Philippines|Philippine]] and Japan disaster relief, and other causes. In 2012 Ono received the Dr. Rainer [[Alexandra Hildebrandt|Hildebrandt]] Human Rights Award. The award is given annually in recognition of extraordinary, nonviolent commitment to [[human rights]]. Ono continued her social activism when she inaugurated a biennial $50,000 [[LennonOno Grant for Peace]] in 2002.  She also co-founded the group [[Artists Against Fracking]] in 2012. She has a daughter, Kyoko Chan Cox, from her marriage to Anthony Cox and a son, [[Sean Taro Ono Lennon]], from her marriage to Lennon. She collaborates musically with Sean.

==Early life and family==
Ono was born on February 18, 1933, in [[Tokyo|Tokyo, Japan]], to {{nihongo|Isoko Ono|小野 磯子|Ono Isoko}} and {{nihongo|Eisuke Ono|小野 英輔|Ono Eisuke}}, a wealthy banker and former [[classical pianist]].&lt;ref name="allmusicB"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/yoko-ono-mn0000521704/biography|title=Yoko Ono: biography|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=February 1, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130101749/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/yoko-ono-mn0000521704/biography|archivedate=January 30, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isoko's maternal grandfather {{nihongo|[[Zenjiro Yasuda]]|安田 善次郎|Yasuda Zenjirō}} was an affiliate of the [[Yasuda clan]] and [[Yasuda zaibatsu|zaibatsu]]. Eisuke came from a long line of [[samurai]] warrior-scholars.&lt;ref name=Stan/&gt; The [[kanji]] translation of [[Yoko (name)|''Yōko'']] ({{lang|ja|洋子}}) means "ocean child".&lt;ref name="allmusicB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nme/&gt;

Two weeks before Ono's birth, Eisuke was transferred to [[San Francisco]] by his employer, the [[Yokohama Specie Bank]].&lt;ref name="sayle"/&gt; The rest of the family followed soon after, with Ono meeting her father when she was two.&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Yoko Ono - Charts &amp; Awards - Billboard Singles|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/yoko-ono-p19685/charts-awards/billboard-singles|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her younger brother Keisuke was born in December 1936. Ono was enrolled in [[piano lesson]]s from the age of 4.&lt;ref name=MH231&gt;{{harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, the family was transferred back to Japan and Ono enrolled at Tokyo's elite [[Gakushuin]] (also known as the Peers School), one of the most exclusive schools in Japan.&lt;ref name="sayle"/&gt;

The family moved to [[New York City]] in 1940. The next year, Eisuke was transferred from New York City to [[Hanoi]], and the family returned to Japan. Ono was enrolled in Keimei Gakuen, an exclusive Christian [[primary school]] run by the [[Mitsui]] family. She remained in Tokyo throughout [[World War II]] and the great [[Bombing of Tokyo|fire-bombing of March 9, 1945]], during which she was sheltered with other family members in a special [[bunker]] in Tokyo's [[Azabu]] district, away from the heavy bombing. Ono later went to the [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]] [[mountain resort]] with members of her family.&lt;ref name="sayle"/&gt;

Starvation was rampant in the destruction that followed the Tokyo bombings; the Ono family was forced to beg for food while pulling their belongings with them in a wheelchair. Ono said it was during this period in her life that she developed her "aggressive" attitude and understanding of "outsider" status. Other stories tell of her mother bringing a large number of goods with them to the countryside, where they were [[barter]]ed for food. In one anecdote, her mother traded a German-made [[sewing machine]] for {{convert|60|kg}} of rice to feed the family.&lt;ref name="sayle"/&gt; During this time, Ono's father, who had been in Hanoi, was believed to be in a [[POW camp|prisoner of war camp]] in [[China]]. However, unbeknownst to them, he remained in the city. Ono told [[Amy Goodman]] of ''[[Democracy Now]]'' on October 16, 2007, that "He was in [[French Indochina]], which is [[Vietnam]] actually.... in Saigon. He was in a concentration camp."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/10/16/exclusive_yoko_ono_on_the_new|title=EXCLUSIVE: Yoko Ono on the New Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland, Art &amp; Politics, the Peace Movement, Government Surveillance and the Murder of John Lennon|last=Goodman|first=Amy|date=October 16, 2007|work=[[Democracy Now!]]|accessdate=February 25, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222184454/http://www.democracynow.org/2007/10/16/exclusive_yoko_ono_on_the_new|archivedate=February 22, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 1946, Gakushuin was reopened and Ono re-enrolled. The school, located near the [[Kōkyo|Tokyo Imperial Palace]], had not been damaged by the war, and Ono found herself a classmate of [[Akihito|Prince Akihito]], the future [[emperor of Japan]].&lt;ref name="allmusicB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stan/&gt; She graduated in 1951 and was accepted into the [[philosophy]] program of [[Gakushuin University]] as the first woman to enter the department. However, she left the school after two semesters.&lt;ref name="sayle"&gt;Murray Sayle, [http://www.jpri.org/publications/occasionalpapers/op18.html "The Importance of Yoko Ono"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221150020/http://www.jpri.org/publications/occasionalpapers/op18.html |date=December 21, 2007 }}, JPRI Occasional Paper No. 18, Japan Policy Research Institute, November 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York City==

===College and downtown beginnings===
After the war ended in 1945, Ono remained in Japan when her family moved to the [[United States]] and settled in [[Scarsdale, New York]], an affluent town 25 miles north of [[midtown Manhattan]]. When Ono later rejoined her family, she enrolled at nearby [[Sarah Lawrence College]]. Ono's parents approved of her college choice but she said that they disapproved of her lifestyle and chastised her for befriending people that they felt were beneath her. In spite of her parents' disapproval, Ono loved meeting artists, [[poet]]s, and others who represented the [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle to which she aspired. She visited [[Art galleries|galleries]] and art [[happening]]s in the city; this whetted her desire to publicly display her own artistic endeavors. [[American People|American]] [[avant-garde]] artist, [[composer]], and musician [[La Monte Young]] was her first important contact in the New York art world; he helped Ono start her career by using her [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]] loft in [[Tribeca]] as a performance space. After Ono set a painting on fire at one performance, her [[mentor]] [[John Cage]] advised her to treat the paper with [[flame retardant]].&lt;ref name=Stan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/january7/yoko-010709.html|title=Yoko Ono to speak at Stanford, Stanford Report|last=Haven|first=Cynthia|date=December 19, 2008|publisher=Stanford University|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112012256/http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/january7/yoko-010709.html|archivedate=November 12, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Japan, early career, and motherhood===
In 1956, Ono left college to [[elope]] with Japanese composer [[Toshi Ichiyanagi]],&lt;ref name=Stan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.biography.com/people/yoko-ono-9542162|title=Yoko Ono|publisher=biography.com|accessdate=February 14, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216080529/http://www.biography.com/people/yoko-ono-9542162|archivedate=February 16, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; a star in Tokyo's experimental community.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=23}} After living apart for several years, they filed for [[divorce]] in 1962. Ono returned home to live with her parents and was suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]] when she was briefly placed into a Japanese [[mental institution]].&lt;ref name="allmusicB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BioChannel&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono.html|title=Yoko Ono Biography|publisher=Biography Channel (UK)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213213142/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono.html|archivedate=December 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, on November 28, 1962, Ono married [[Anthony Cox (producer)|Anthony Cox]], an American [[jazz musician]], [[film producer]], and art promoter, who was instrumental in securing her release from the institution.&lt;ref name=Stan/&gt; Ono's second marriage was [[annullment|annulled]] on March 1, 1963, because she had neglected to finalize her divorce from Ichiyanagi. After finalizing that divorce, Cox and Ono married again on June 6, 1963. She gave birth to their daughter Kyoko Chan Cox two months later on August 8, 1963.&lt;ref name="allmusicB"/&gt;

The marriage quickly fell apart, but the Coxes stayed together for the sake of their joint [[career]]s. They performed at Tokyo's [[Sogetsu]] Hall, with Ono lying atop a piano played by John Cage. Soon, the couple returned to New York with Kyoko. In the early years of the marriage, Ono left most of Kyoko's parenting to Cox while she pursued her art full-time, with Cox also managing her [[publicity]]. Ono and Cox divorced on February 2, 1969, and she married John Lennon later that same year. In the midst of a 1971 [[custody battle]], Cox disappeared with their eight-year-old daughter. He won custody after successfully claiming that Ono was an unfit mother due to her drug use.&lt;ref name=BioChannel/&gt; Ono's ex-husband changed Kyoko's name to "Ruth Holman" and subsequently raised the girl in an organization known as the [[The Living Word Fellowship|Church of the Living Word]] (or "the Walk").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hockinson|first=Michael J.|title=The Ultimate Beatles Quiz Book|date=1992|publisher=Macmillan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ono and Lennon searched for Kyoko for years, but to no avail. She finally saw Kyoko again many years later in 1998.&lt;ref name=BioChannel/&gt;

==John Lennon==
[[Fluxus]], a loose association of [[Dada]]-inspired [[avant-garde]] artists that developed in the early 1960s, was active in New York and Europe.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=27}} Ono visited London to meet artist and political activist [[Gustav Metzger]]'s Destruction in Art Symposium in September 1966, as the only woman artist chosen to perform her own events and only one of two invited to speak.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=168}}

There are two versions of the story of how Lennon and Ono first met. According to the first account, on November 9, 1966 Lennon went to the [[Indica Gallery]] in London, where Ono was preparing her conceptual art exhibit, and they were introduced by gallery owner [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]].{{sfn|Harry|2001|p=682}} Lennon was initially unimpressed with the exhibits he saw, including a pricey bag of nails, but one piece, ''[[Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting]]'', had a ladder with a spyglass at the top. When he climbed the ladder, Lennon felt a little foolish, but he looked through the spyglass and saw the word "YES" which he said meant he didn't walk out, as it was positive, whereas most concept art he encountered was "anti" everything.&lt;ref name=HSW&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/john-lennon30.htm|title=John Lennon: John Lennon Meets Yoko Ono|last=Buskin|first=Richard|publisher=HowStuffWorks.com|accessdate=April 17, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427092641/http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/john-lennon30.htm|archivedate=April 27, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Lennons by Jack Mitchell.jpg|thumb|left|Lennon and Ono in 1980, shortly before his murder]]
Lennon was also intrigued by Ono's ''Hammer a Nail''. Viewers hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet opened, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him.  Dunbar asked her, "Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it."  Ono supposedly had not heard of the [[Beatles]], but relented on the condition that Lennon pay her five [[shilling (British coin)|shilling]]s, to which Lennon replied, "I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in."&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheff|first=David|title=All We Are Saying: The Last Major Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul McCartney]] told a second version of the first meeting of Ono and Lennon. In 1965, Ono was in London and compiling original musical scores for a book entitled ''[[Notations]]''; John Cage was working on the book. McCartney declined to give her any of his own manuscripts but suggested that Lennon might oblige. Lennon did, giving Ono the original handwritten lyrics to "[[The Word (song)|The Word]]".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=272}}

===Bed-Ins and other early collaborations===

[[Hilton Amsterdam]], March 1969]]
During the last two years that the Beatles performed, Lennon and Ono created and attended their own [[Protests against the Vietnam War|public protests against the Vietnam War]]. On March 20, 1969, they were married at the registry office in [[Gibraltar]] and spent their honeymoon in [[Amsterdam]], campaigning with a week-long [[Bed-In|Bed-In for Peace]]. They planned another Bed-In in the US, but were denied entry to the country.&lt;ref&gt;Kruse, Robert J.

Lennon detailed this period in the Beatles' song "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]".&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Ray, ''Lennon: The Definitive Biography'', 1992, p. 550&lt;/ref&gt;

Lennon changed his name by [[deed poll]] on April 22, 1969, switching out ''Winston'' for ''Ono'' as a middle name.  Although he used the name John Ono Lennon thereafter, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Ray, ''Lennon: The Definitive Biography'', 1984b, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The couple settled at [[Tittenhurst Park]] at [[Sunninghill, Berkshire]], in southeast England.&lt;ref name="PNorman"&gt;Norman, Philip, John Lennon The Life, Hammersmith, England: Harper Collins, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-00-719741-5}}, p. 615 et seq&lt;/ref&gt; When Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-sized bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' last recorded album, ''[[Abbey Road]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Emerick, Massey, 2006, pp. 279–80&lt;/ref&gt;

The two artists collaborated on many albums, beginning in 1968 when Lennon was still a Beatle, with ''[[Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins]]'', an album of experimental [[musique concrète]]. The same year, the couple contributed an experimental piece to ''[[The Beatles (album)|The White Album]]'' called "[[Revolution 9]]".  Also on ''The White Album,'' Ono contributed [[backing vocals]] on "[[Birthday (Beatles song)|Birthday]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibron|first=Bill|url=http://www.thewhitealbumproject.com/songs/side-three/|title=An in-depth Look at the Songs on Side-Three|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=The White Album Project|date=December 21, 1968|accessdate=February 1, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113003559/http://www.thewhitealbumproject.com/songs/side-three/|archivedate=January 13, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one line of lead vocals on "[[The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill]]".

===The Plastic Ono Band===
{{main|Plastic Ono Band|Live Peace in Toronto 1969}}

[[File:Jlbedin3.JPG|thumb|Lennon and Ono recording [[Give Peace a Chance]], at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]], Montreal, 1969]]
Ono influenced Lennon to produce more "autobiographical" output and, after "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]", they decided it would be better to form their own band rather than put the material out under the Beatles name.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ian MacDonald|McDonald, Ian]], ''[[Revolution in the Head]],'' 3rd ed., Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-55652-733-3}}, 1556527330&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, the Plastic Ono Band's first album, ''[[Live Peace in Toronto 1969]]'', was recorded during the [[Toronto Rock and Roll Revival]] festival. This first incarnation of the group also consisted of guitarist [[Eric Clapton]], bass player [[Klaus Voormann]], and drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]]. The first half of their performance consisted of rock standards. During the second half, Ono took to the microphone and performed an [[avant-garde]] set along with the band, finishing with music that consisted mainly of [[Audio feedback|feedback]], while she screamed and sang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpgr.co.uk/core2001.html|last=Calkin|first=Graham|title=Live Peace in Toronto 1969|publisher=Jpgr.co.uk|accessdate=February 1, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009190538/http://www.jpgr.co.uk/core2001.html|archivedate=October 9, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blaney, John (2005).

===First solo album and ''Fly''===
{{main|Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band|John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band|Fly (Yoko Ono album)}}
Ono released her first solo album, ''[[Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band]]'', in 1970 as a companion piece to Lennon's better-known ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]''. The two albums also had companion covers: Ono's featured a photo of her leaning on Lennon, and Lennon's a photo of him leaning on Ono. Her album included raw, harsh vocals, which bore a similarity with sounds in nature (especially those made by animals) and [[free jazz]] techniques used by wind and brass players. Performers included [[Ornette Coleman]], other renowned [[free jazz]] performers, and [[Ringo Starr]]. Some songs on the album consisted of wordless vocalizations, in a style that would influence [[Meredith Monk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/blog/women-music-trailblazing-female-singers-songwriters-and-musicians/6|title=Women in Music: Trailblazing Female Singers, Songwriters and Musicians|publisher=makers.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203025326/http://www.makers.com/blog/women-music-trailblazing-female-singers-songwriters-and-musicians/6|archivedate=February 3, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other musical artists who have used screams and vocal noise in lieu of words.

When Lennon was invited to play with [[Frank Zappa]] at the [[The Fillmore|Fillmore]] (then the Filmore West) on June 5, 1971, Ono joined them.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes to Disc 2, ''Sometime in New York City'' album.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, she released ''[[Fly (Yoko Ono album)|Fly]]'', a double album. In it, she explored slightly more conventional [[psychedelic rock]] with tracks including "Midsummer New York" and "Mind Train", in addition to a number of Fluxus experiments.  She also received minor airplay with the ballad "[[Mrs. Lennon]]".  The track "[[Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)|Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)]]" was an ode to Ono's missing daughter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Beatles: An illustrated record|page=83|year=1978|publisher=Harmony Books|isbn=0-517-53367-7|author1=Carr, R.|author2=Tyler, T.|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and featured Eric Clapton on guitar. In the late 1960s, while studying with [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] in [[Majorca]], Spain, Ono's ex-husband Anthony Cox accused Ono of abducting their daughter Kyoko from his hotel. Accusations flew between the two, as well as the matter of custody. Cox eventually moved away with Kyoko; Ono would not see her daughter until 1998.&lt;ref name=BioChannel/&gt; It was during this time that she wrote "Don't Worry Kyoko", which also appears on Lennon and Ono's album ''[[Live Peace in Toronto 1969]]'', in addition to ''Fly''. Kyoko is also referenced in the first line of "[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)|Happy Christmas (War Is Over)]]" when Yoko whispers "Happy Christmas, Kyoko", followed by Lennon whispering, "Happy Christmas, [[Julian Lennon|Julian]]."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Andrew Grant. ''Still the Greatest: The Essential Songs of The Beatles' Solo Careers,'' Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, July 2012, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;  The song reached No. 4 in the UK, where its release was delayed until 1972, and has periodically reemerged on the UK Singles Chart. Originally a [[Protest song|protest]] [[song about the Vietnam War]], "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" has since become a Christmas standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/now-thats-what-i-call-christmas%21-the-essential-mw0000797209|title=Various Artists: Now That's What I Call Christmas!: The Essential|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=February 14, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205062218/http://www.allmusic.com/album/now-thats-what-i-call-christmas%21-the-essential-mw0000797209|archivedate=February 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/happy-xmas-war-is-over-mt0029822393|title=Happy Xmas (War Is Over): Overview|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=February 14, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831223449/http://www.allmusic.com/song/happy-xmas-war-is-over-mt0029822393|archivedate=August 31, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; That August the couple appeared together at a benefit in [[Madison Square Garden]] with [[Roberta Flack]], [[Stevie Wonder]], and [[Sha Na Na]] for mentally handicapped children organized by [[WABC-TV]]'s [[Geraldo Rivera]].{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=320}}

In a 2018 issue of [[Portland Magazine]], editor [[Colin Sargent|Colin W. Sargent]] writes of interviewing Yoko while she was visiting Portland, Maine in 2005. She spoke of driving along the coast with Lennon and dreamed of buying a house in Maine. "We talked excitedly in the car. We were looking for a house on the water… We did examine the place! We kept driving north along the water until I don't really remember the name of the town. We went quite a ways up, actually, because it was so beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;Portland Magazine,2018&lt;/ref&gt;

==Separation from Lennon and reconciliation==
After the Beatles disbanded in 1970, Ono and Lennon lived together in London and then moved permanently to [[Manhattan]] in order to escape tabloid racism towards Ono.&lt;ref name=TA&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/02/john-lennon-radical-left-tariq-ali|title=John Lennon's power for the people|date=Feb 2, 2010|last=Ali|first=Tariq|newspaper=The Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109115346/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/feb/02/john-lennon-radical-left-tariq-ali|archivedate=January 9, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship became strained because Lennon was facing the threat of deportation due to drug charges that had been filed against him in England, and because of Ono's separation from her daughter. The couple separated in July 1973, with Ono pursuing her career and Lennon living between [[Los Angeles]] and New York with personal assistant [[May Pang]]; Ono had given her blessing to Lennon and Pang.&lt;ref name=Separation&gt;{{cite book|first=Geoffrey Giuliano|last=Brenda Giuliano|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kVpXvJn0ZZIC&amp;pg=RA2-PA260&amp;vq=Pang&amp;dq=%22may+pang%22#PRA2-PA213,M1|title=Press Release Interview with May Pang|accessdate=June 9, 2011|isbn=978-0-7119-6470-9|year=1998|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101162507/http://books.google.com/books?id=kVpXvJn0ZZIC&amp;pg=RA2-PA260&amp;vq=Pang&amp;dq=%22may+pang%22#PRA2-PA213,M1|archivedate=January 1, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Harry|2001|p=698-99}}

By December 1974, Lennon and Pang considered buying a house together, and he refused to accept Ono's phone calls. The next month, Lennon agreed to meet with Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her Lennon was unavailable, because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.{{sfn|Harry|2001|p=700-01}}

Ono and Lennon's son, [[Sean Lennon|Sean]], was born on October 9, 1975, which coincidentally was Lennon's 35th birthday. John did not help relations with his first son when he described [[Julian Lennon|Julian]] in 1980 as being part of the "ninety percent of the people on this planet [who resulted from an unplanned pregnancy]" and that "Sean is a planned child, and therein lies the difference." He said, "I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days."&lt;ref name="yahoo1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Willman|first=Chris|url=http://music.yahoo.com/blogs/stop-the-presses/julian-lennon-50-never-much-too-lennon-family-004241541.html?pt=2|title=Julian Lennon at 50: It's Never 'Much Too Late' For Lennon Family Discord &amp;#124; Stop The Presses!

===Lennon's murder, tributes, and memorials===
{{main|Murder of John Lennon}}

Following Sean's birth in 1975, Lennon took a hiatus from the music industry and became a [[househusband]] to care for his infant son. He resumed his songwriting career shortly before his December 1980 [[Death of John Lennon|murder]], which Ono witnessed at close range. She stated the couple was thinking about going out to dinner after spending several hours in a recording studio, but decided to return to their apartment instead, because Lennon wanted to see Sean before he was put to bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Lennon Remembered|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-lennon-remembered-08-12-2005/|publisher=CBS News|date=Dec 8, 2005|last=Dakss|first=Brian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426211600/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-lennon-remembered-08-12-2005/|archivedate=April 26, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her husband's murder, Ono went into complete seclusion for an extended period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ontheredcarpet.com/Yoko-Ono-headlining-shows-for-Japan-relief-efforts/8037478|title=Yoko Ono headlining shows for Japan relief efforts|publisher=On the Red Carpet|last=Allin|first=Olivia|date=March 27, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106130956/http://www.ontheredcarpet.com/Yoko-Ono-headlining-shows-for-Japan-relief-efforts/8037478|archivedate=November 6, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yoko Ono 2005.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ono delivering flowers to Lennon's memorial [[Strawberry Fields (memorial)|Strawberry Fields]] in [[Central Park]] on the 25th anniversary of his death, December 8, 2005.]]
Ono funded the construction and maintenance of the [[Strawberry Fields memorial]] in Manhattan's [[Central Park]], directly across from the [[The Dakota|Dakota Apartments]], which was the scene of the murder and remains Ono's residence to this day. It was officially dedicated on October 9, 1985, which would have been his 45th birthday. In 1990, Ono collaborated with music consultant [[Jeff Pollack (Media Consultant)|Jeff Pollack]] to honor what would have been Lennon's 50th birthday with a worldwide broadcast of [[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]].  Over 1,000 stations in over 50 countries participated in the simultaneous broadcast. Ono felt the timing was perfect, considering the escalating conflicts in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Worldwide Broadcast Planned in Honor of Lennon's 50th Birthday|newspaper=The Tufts Daily|date=October 5, 1990|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, she founded the [[John Lennon Museum]] in [[Saitama, Saitama]], Japan. In March 2002, she was present with [[Cherie Blair]] at the unveiling of a seven-foot statue of Lennon, to mark the renaming of [[Liverpool]] airport to [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]].&lt;ref name=Scot/&gt; (Julian and Cynthia Lennon were present at the unveiling of the [[John Lennon Peace Monument]] next to [[ACC Liverpool]] in the same city eight years later.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/news/a-monument-in-the-life|title=A Monument in the Life|author=Steve Hochman, GRAMMY.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221185840/http://www.grammy.com/news/a-monument-in-the-life|archivedate=February 21, 2014|df=mdy-all}}
&lt;/ref&gt; On October 9, 2007, she dedicated a new memorial called the [[Imagine Peace Tower]], located on the island of [[Viðey]], 1&amp;nbsp;km outside the Skarfabakki harbour in [[Reykjavík]], Iceland. Each year, between October 9 and December 8, it projects a vertical beam of light high into the sky. In 2009, Ono created an exhibit called "John Lennon: The New York City Years" for the NYC [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] Annex. The exhibit used music, photographs, and personal items to depict Lennon's life in New York, and a portion of the cost of each ticket was donated to Spirit Foundation, a charitable foundation set up by Lennon and Ono.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespiritfoundation.com|title=Spirit Foundation|accessdate=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every time Lennon's killer [[Mark David Chapman]] has a parole hearing – which is mandated by law every two years – Ono has come out strongly against his release from prison. She is the widow of the victim, and her opinion has a strong influence on the parole board's decision to keep Chapman behind bars.

===Fluxus===
Ono is often associated with the Fluxus group, which was founded by [[George Maciunas]], who was her friend during the 1960s. Maciunas admired and enthusiastically promoted her work and gave Ono her U.S. show at his AG Gallery in 1961. He formally invited her to join the Fluxus group, but she declined because she wanted to remain independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newhall|first=Edith|title=A Long and Winding Road|publisher=ARTnews|date=Oct 2000|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did, however, collaborate with him,{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=40-41}} [[Charlotte Moorman]], [[George Brecht]], and the poet [[Jackson Mac Low]], among others associated with the group.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233}}

[[John Cage]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] were significant influences on Ono's art.&lt;ref name=NYsl&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/21934/|title=Influences: Sean Lennon|date=Oct 9, 2009|last=Cardace|first=Sara|publisher=New York magazine|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708020759/http://nymag.com/arts/popmusic/features/21934/|archivedate=July 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=17}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/08/30/160327305/33-musicians-on-what-john-cage-communicates|title=33 Musicians on What John Cage Communicates|last=Blau|first=Max|date=Sep 5, 2012|publisher=npr.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221094215/http://www.npr.org/2012/08/30/160327305/33-musicians-on-what-john-cage-communicates|archivedate=February 21, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She learned of Cage at Sarah Lawrence&lt;ref name=MH232/&gt; and met him through his student Ichiyanagi Toshi in Cage's legendary experimental composition class at the [[New School for Social Research]]:{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=65}} She was thus introduced to more of Cage's unconventional [[neo-Dada]]ism first hand and his New York City protégés [[Allan Kaprow]], Brecht, Mac Low, [[Al Hansen]] and the poet [[Dick Higgins]].{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233}}

After Cage finished teaching at the New School in the summer of 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found an inexpensive loft in downtown [[Manhattan]] at 112 [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]] and used the apartment as a studio and living space. Ono supported herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the [[Japan Society of New York|Japan Society]], and she allowed composer [[La Monte Young]] to organize concerts in the loft.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233}} They both began organizing a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961;&lt;ref name=MH232/&gt; the events were attended by people such as [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Peggy Guggenheim]].&lt;ref name=MH21&gt;{{harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ono and Young both claimed to have been the primary curator of these events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kotz, Liz|title=Post-Cagean Aesthetics and the "Event" Score|journal=October|volume=95|date=Winter 2001|jstor=779200|pages=55–89 [56]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=65}} The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including ''Painting to Be Stepped On'', which was a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.&lt;ref name=MH21/&gt;

Ono is credited for the album cover art for ''Nirvana Symphony'' by [[Toshiro Mayuzumi]] (Time Records, 1962).

===''Cut Piece,'' 1964===
Ono was a pioneer of [[conceptual art]] and [[performance art]]. A seminal performance work is ''Cut Piece,'' first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto, Japan. The piece consisted of Ono, dressed in her best suit, kneeling on a stage with a pair of scissors in front of her. She invited and then instructed audience members to join her on stage and cut pieces of her clothing off. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion.&lt;ref name=MH158&gt;{{harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece was subsequently performed at the Sogetsu Art Centre in Tokyo that same year, New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1965 and London's [[Africa Centre, London|Africa Center]] as part of the [[Destruction in Art Symposium]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Phelan|first1=Peggy|editor1-last=Butler|editor1-first=Cornelia|editor1-link=WACK!: Art and the Feminist Revolution|title=The Returns of Touch: Feminist Performances, 1960-80|date=2007|publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art|location=Los Angeles|page=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the piece, John Hendricks in the catalogue to Ono's Japan Society retrospective wrote: "[''Cut Piece''] unveils the interpersonal alienation that characterizes social relationships between subjects, dismantling the disinterested Kantian aesthetic model..... It demonstrates the reciprocity between artists, objects, and viewers and the responsibility beholders have to the reception and preservation of art."&lt;ref name="MH158" /&gt;

Other performers of the piece have included Charlotte Moorman and John Hendricks.&lt;ref name="MH158" /&gt; Ono reprised the piece in [[Paris]] in 2003, in the low [[post-9/11]] period between the US and France, saying she hoped to show that this is "a time where we need to trust each other".&lt;ref name="Stan" /&gt; In 2013, the Canadian singer, [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]] reprised it at the multi-day Meltdown festival at the [[Southbank Centre]] in London, which Ono curated.&lt;ref name="guML"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/23/yoko-ono-meltdown-2013-review|last=Empire|first=Kitty|title=Yoko Ono's Meltdown – review|date=June 22, 2013|publisher=The Guardian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231011026/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jun/23/yoko-ono-meltdown-2013-review|archivedate=December 31, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Grapefruit'' book, 1964===
{{main|Grapefruit (book)}}

Ono's small book titled ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit]]'' is another seminal piece of conceptual art.  First published in 1964, the book reads as a set of instructions through which the work of art is completed-either literally or in the imagination of the viewer participant. One example is "Hide and Seek Piece: Hide until everybody goes home. Hide until everybody forgets about you. Hide until everybody dies."  ''Grapefruit'' has been published several times, most widely distributed by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1971, who reprinted it again in 2000. [[:de:David Bourdon|David Bourdon]], art critic for ''[[The Village Voice]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', called ''Grapefruit'' "one of the monuments of conceptual art of the early 1960s".  He noted that her conceptual approach was made more acceptable when white male artists like [[Joseph Kosuth]] and [[Lawrence Weiner]] came in and "did virtually the same things" she did, and that her take also has a poetic and lyrical side that sets it apart from the work of other conceptual artists.&lt;ref name=Whit/&gt;

Ono would enact many of the book's scenarios as performance pieces throughout her career, which formed the basis for her art exhibitions, including the highly publicized [[retrospective exhibition]], ''This Is Not Here'' in 1971 at the [[Everson Museum]] in [[Syracuse, New York]],&lt;ref name="Grove"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPGdBxzaWj0C&amp;q=596#v=snippet&amp;q=596&amp;f=false|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1|publisher=Oxford University Press|editor=Joan M.

Nearly fifty years later in July 2013, she released a sequel to ''Grapefruit'', another book of instructions, ''Acorn'' via [[OR Books]].&lt;ref name=OR&gt;{{cite book|last=Ono|first=Yoko|title=Acorn|publisher=OR Books|year=2013|isbn=978-1-939293-23-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental films, 1964–72===
Ono was also an [[experimental filmmaker]] who made 16 short films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply ''No. 4'', often referred to as ''Bottoms.''&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono/films.html|publisher=Biography Channel (UK)|title=Yoko Ono Biography: Films|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202100643/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono/films.html|archivedate=February 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICA/&gt; The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking on a treadmill. The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the [[gluteal cleft]] and the [[horizontal gluteal crease]]. The soundtrack consists of interviews with those who are being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company [[Swatch]] produced a [[limited edition]] watch that commemorated this film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swatch.com/zz_en/watches/finder-detail.sku-GB168.html|title=Film No. 4|publisher=swatch.com|accessdate=February 5, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217183705/http://www.swatch.com/zz_en/watches/finder-detail.sku-GB168.html|archivedate=December 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Wish Tree,'' 1981–present===
{{main|Wish Tree (Yoko Ono art series)}}

Another example of Ono's participatory art was her ''Wish Tree'' project, in which a tree native to the installation site is installed. Her 1996 ''Wish Piece'' had the following instructions:

:Make a wish
:Write it down on a piece of paper
:Fold it and tie it around a branch of a Wish Tree
:Ask your friends to do the same
:Keep wishing
:Until the branches are covered with wishes.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=294}}

Her ''Wish Tree'' installation in the [[Sculpture Garden]] of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, established in July 2010, has attracted contributions from all over the world.

=== ''Arising,'' 2015 ===
In 2015, Ono created the piece ''Arising'' in [[Venice]]. As part of the exhibition ''Personal Structures'', organised by Global Art Affairs, the installation was on view from June 1 through November 24, 2013, at the [[European Cultural Centre]]'s [[Palazzo Bembo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/call-women-whitehot-magazine-interview/2792|title=WM {{!}} whitehot magazine of contemporary art {{!}} June 2013: Yoko Ono: Arising a call for Women - the Whitehot Magazine Interview|website=whitehotmagazine.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113150417/https://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/call-women-whitehot-magazine-interview/2792|archivedate=January 13, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this feminist work of art, female [[silicon]] bodies were burnt in the [[Venetian lagoon]], evoking the imagery of mythical [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]]es. When asked for the resemblance between the naming of her record ''Rising'' and this piece, Ono responded: "''Rising'' was telling all people that it is time for us to rise and fight for our rights. But in the process of fighting together, women are still being treated separately in an inhuman way. It weakens the power of men and women all together. I hope ''Arising'' will wake up Women Power, and make us, men and women, heal together."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nyartsmagazine.com/?p=15615|title=Sarah Gold and Karlyn De Jongh Talk with Yoko Ono - NY Arts Magazine|date=January 31, 2014|work=NY Arts Magazine|access-date=July 11, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the [[Whitney Museum]] held a [[retrospective]] of her work, '''''Yoko Ono: Objects, Films''''', marking Ono's reentry into the New York art world after a hiatus. At the suggestion of Ono's live-in companion at the time,  interior decorator [[Sam Havadtoy]], she recast her old pieces in bronze after some initial reluctance. "I realized that for something to move me so much that I would cry, there's something there. There seemed like a shimmering air in the 60s when I made these pieces, and now the air is bronzified. Now it's the 80s, and bronze is very 80s in a way - solidity, commodity, all of that. For someone who went through the 60s revolution, there has of course been an incredible change. . . . I call the pieces petrified bronze. That freedom, all the hope and wishes are in some ways petrified."&lt;ref name=Whit&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Taylor|authorlink=Paul Taylor (art critic)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/05/arts/art-yoko-ono-s-new-bronze-age-at-the-whitney.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|title=Yoko Ono's New Bronze Age at the Whitney|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 5, 1989|accessdate=January 31, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113183517/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/05/arts/art-yoko-ono-s-new-bronze-age-at-the-whitney.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|archivedate=November 13, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==

===Early career===
Ono studied piano from the age of 4 to 12 or 13. She attended [[kabuki]] performances with her mother, who was trained in [[shamisen]], [[koto (instrument)|koto]], [[otsuzumi]], [[kotsuzumi]], [[nagauta]], and could read Japanese musical scores. At 14 Yoko took up vocal training in [[lieder]]-singing. At Sarah Lawrence, she studied poetry with [[Alastair Reid]], [[English literature]] with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the [[Vienna|Viennese]]-trained André Singer.&lt;ref name=MH231/&gt; Of this time Ono has said that her heroes were the [[twelve tone technique|twelve-tone composers]] [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Alban Berg]]. She said, "I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into [an] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and..... he said, 'Well, look, there are people who are doing things like what you do and they're called avant-garde.'" Singer introduced her to the work of [[Edgar Varèse]], [[John Cage]], and [[Henry Cowell]]. She left college and moved to New York in 1957, supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the Japan Society.&lt;ref name=MH232&gt;{{harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She met Cage through Ichiyanagi Toshi in Cage's legendary composition class at the [[New School for Social Research]],{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=65}} and in the summer of 1960, she found a cheap loft in downtown [[Manhattan]] at 112 [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]] and allowed composer [[La Monte Young]] to organize concerts in the loft with her,{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233}} with people like [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Peggy Guggenheim]] attending.&lt;ref name=MH21/&gt; Ono only presented work once during the series.&lt;ref name=MH232/&gt; In 1961, years before meeting Lennon, Ono had her first major public performance in a concert at the 258-seat [[Carnegie Hall|Carnegie Recital Hall]] (smaller than the "Main Hall"). This concert featured radical experimental music and performances. She had a second engagement at the Carnegie Recital Hall in 1965, in which she debuted ''Cut Piece.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/cut-piece/|title=Ono, Yoko: Cut Piece|publisher=Medien Kunst Netz (Media Art Net)|accessdate=2017-11-05|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107032346/http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/cut-piece/|archivedate=November 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She premiered ''The Fog Machine'' during her ''Concert of Music for the Mind'' at the Bluecoat Society of Arts in Liverpool, England in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/centre-creative-universe-liverpool-and-avant-garde/centre|title=Centre of the Creative Universe: Liverpool and the Avant-Garde: Timeline|publisher=tate.or.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302142908/http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/centre-creative-universe-liverpool-and-avant-garde/centre|archivedate=March 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
In early 1980, John Lennon heard [[Lene Lovich]] and [[the B-52's]]' "[[Rock Lobster]]" while on vacation in Bermuda. The latter reminded him of Ono's musical sound and he took this as an indication that she had reached the mainstream&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-eighties-20110418/john-lennon-and-yoko-ono-double-fantasy-20110322|title=#29: John Lennon and Yoko Ono, ''Double Fantasy''|accessdate=April 18, 2014|work=Rolling Stone|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203182000/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-best-albums-of-the-eighties-20110418/john-lennon-and-yoko-ono-double-fantasy-20110322|archivedate=February 3, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the band in fact had been influenced by Ono).&lt;ref name=ape/&gt; In addition to her collaborations with experimental artists including John Cage and jazz legend Ornette Coleman, many other musicians, particularly those of the [[New wave music|new wave]] movement, have paid tribute to Ono (both as an artist in her own right, and as a [[muse]] and [[icon|iconic figure]]). For example, [[Elvis Costello]] recorded a version of Ono's song "[[Walking on Thin Ice]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello/_/Walking+On+Thin+Ice|title=Elvis Costello-Walking on Thin Ice|publisher=last.fm|accessdate=February 7, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309053759/http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello/_/Walking+On+Thin+Ice|archivedate=March 9, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the B-52's (who drew from her early recordings)&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; covered "Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)" (shortening the title to "Don't Worry"), and [[Sonic Youth]] included a performance of Ono's early conceptual "Voice Piece for Soprano" on their [[Experimental music|experimental]] album ''[[SYR4: Goodbye 20th Century]]''.&lt;ref name=NME&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/artistKeyname/1664|title=SYR4 - Goodbye 20th Century|publisher=''NME''|date=December 1, 1999|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223061001/http://www.nme.com/reviews/artistKeyname/1664|archivedate=February 23, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the evening of December 8, 1980, Lennon and Ono were in the [[Record Plant|Record Plant Studio]] and working on Ono's song "Walking on Thin Ice". When they returned to The Dakota (their home in Manhattan), Lennon was shot dead by [[Mark David Chapman]], a deranged fan who had been stalking Lennon for two months. "Walking on Thin Ice (For John)" was released as a single less than a month later, and became Ono's first chart success, peaking at No. 58 and gaining major underground airplay. In 1981, she released the album ''[[Season of Glass]]'', which featured the striking cover photo of Lennon's bloody spectacles next to a half-filled glass of water, with a window overlooking Central Park in the background. This photograph sold at an auction in London in April 2002 for about $13,000. In the [[liner notes]] to ''Season of Glass'', Ono explained that the album was not dedicated to Lennon because "he would have been offended—he was one of us." The album received highly favorable reviews&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; and reflected the public's mood after Lennon's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/season-of-glass-r46036 AllMusic Season of Glass Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218232922/http://www.allmusic.com/album/season-of-glass-r46036 |date=December 18, 2010 }}.

In 1982, she released ''[[It's Alright (I See Rainbows)|It's Alright]]''. The cover featured Ono in her famous wrap-around sunglasses, looking towards the sun, while on the back the ghost of Lennon looks over her and their son. The album scored minor chart success&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/its-alright-i-see-rainbows-mw0000027137/awards|title=Yoko Ono, It's Alright (I See Rainbows), Billboard Albums|date=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and airplay with the single "[[Never Say Goodbye (single)|Never Say Goodbye]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/yoko-ono/id321559|title=Yoko Ono: Biography|publisher=iTunes|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412054213/https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/yoko-ono/id321559|archivedate=April 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, a tribute album titled ''[[Every Man Has a Woman]]'' was released, featuring a selection of Ono songs performed by artists such as Elvis Costello, [[Roberta Flack]], [[Eddie Money]], [[Rosanne Cash]], and [[Harry Nilsson]].&lt;ref name=Ev&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/every-man-has-a-woman-mw0000193725/credits|title=Various Artists, Every Man Has a Woman, Credits|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=February 7, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908235717/http://www.allmusic.com/album/every-man-has-a-woman-mw0000193725/credits|archivedate=September 8, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of Lennon's projects that he never got to finish.

Ono's final album of the 1980s was ''[[Starpeace]]'', a [[concept album]] that she intended as an antidote to [[Ronald Reagan]]'s "[[Strategic Defense Initiative|Star Wars]]" [[National missile defense|missile defense system]]. On the cover, a warm, smiling Ono holds the Earth in the palm of her hand. ''Starpeace'' became Ono's most successful non-Lennon effort.  The single "[[Hell in Paradise]]" was a hit, reaching No. 16 on the US dance charts and No. 26 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] Hot 100, and the video, directed by [[Zbigniew Rybczyński]] received major airplay on MTV and won "Most Innovative Video" at Billboard Music Video Awards in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ZBIG RYBCZYNSKI::FILM AND VIDEO AWARD|url=http://www.zbigvision.com/zbigsawards.html|work=ZBIG RYBCZYNSKI|accessdate=July 26, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723194533/http://www.zbigvision.com/zbigsawards.html|archivedate=July 23, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Ono set out on a goodwill world tour for ''Starpeace'', primarily visiting Eastern European countries.&lt;ref name=RS/&gt;

She was blamed for the breakup of the Beatles{{sfn|Badman|1999|p=40}}&lt;ref name=Dub/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/087/000023018/|title=Yoko Ono|publisher=Nndb.com|date=|accessdate=August 24, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905080411/http://www.nndb.com/people/087/000023018/|archivedate=September 5, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and repeatedly criticized for her influence over Lennon and his music.&lt;ref name="allmusicB"/&gt; Her experimental art was also not popularly accepted.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt; The British press was particularly negative and prompted the couple's move to the US.&lt;ref name=TA/&gt; As late as December 1999, ''[[NME]]'' was calling her a "no-talent charlatan".&lt;ref name=NME/&gt;

Her name still connotes the figure of the evil female interloper to the mainstream.

When American singer [[Jessica Simpson]] was dating [[Dallas Cowboys]] quarterback [[Tony Romo]] in 2007, the Simpson-Romo relationship was blamed for Romo's poor performances.

==Relationship with the Beatles==
{{main|Break-up of the Beatles}}

Lennon and Ono were injured in a car accident in June 1969, partway through recording ''[[Abbey Road]]''. According to journalist [[Barry Miles]], a bed with a microphone was then installed in the studio so that Ono could make artistic comments about the album.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=552}} Miles thought Ono's continual presence in the studio during the latter part of the Beatles' career put strain on Lennon's relationship with the other band members. [[George Harrison]] verbally assaulted her after she took one of his chocolate digestive biscuits without asking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/10/08/reviews/001008.08udovitt.html|title=Let Us Now Praise Famous Men|newspaper=New York Times|first=Mim|last=Udovitch|date=October 8, 2000|accessdate=February 21, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310222925/http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/10/08/reviews/001008.08udovitt.html|archivedate=March 10, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English press dubbed her "the woman who broke up the Beatles",{{sfn|Badman|1999|p=40}} but Ono has stated that the Beatles broke up themselves without any direct involvement from her, adding "I don't think I could have tried even to break them up."{{sfn|Badman|1999|p=41}} In an interview with [[Dick Cavett]], Lennon explicitly denied that Ono broke up The Beatles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IALrFZTS1yM|title=John Lennon-on Yoko Breaking Up the Beatles|publisher=YouTube|date=January 11, 2008|accessdate=August 24, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112025120/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IALrFZTS1yM|archivedate=November 12, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even Harrison said during an interview with Cavett that the problems within the Beatles began long before Ono came onto the scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vP84g-yn58|title=George harrison talks about Lennon, Paul, yoko ono and beatles beakup|publisher=YouTube|date=December 5, 1990|accessdate=August 24, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328214448/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vP84g-yn58|archivedate=March 28, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Beatles were together, every song written by Lennon or McCartney was credited as [[Lennon–McCartney]] regardless of whether the song was a [[collaboration]] or written solely by one of the two (except for those appearing on their first album, ''Please Please Me'', which originally credited the songs to McCartney–Lennon). In 1976, McCartney released a live album called ''[[Wings over America]]'', which credited the five Beatles tracks as P. McCartney–J. Lennon compositions, but neither Lennon nor Ono objected. After Lennon's death, however, McCartney again attempted to change the order to McCartney–Lennon for songs that were solely or predominantly written by him, such as "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/2588861.stm|title=Talking Point &amp;#124; Lennon-McCartney: Who do you give credit to?|publisher=BBC News|date=December 23, 2002|accessdate=April 18, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407163230/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/2588861.stm|archivedate=April 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Ono would not allow it, saying she felt this broke an agreement that the two had made while Lennon was still alive, and the surviving Beatle argued that such an agreement never existed. A spokesman for Ono said McCartney was making "an attempt to rewrite history".&lt;ref name="billboard_controversy"/&gt;

In a ''Rolling Stone'' interview in 1987, Ono pointed out McCartney's place in the process of the disintegration of the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/yoko-ono-blames-paul-mccartney-beatles-breakup-979558|title=Yoko Ono Blames Paul McCartney for the Beatles' Breakup?|last=Vultaggio|first=Maria|date=December 29, 2012|work=International Business Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231180229/http://www.ibtimes.com/yoko-ono-blames-paul-mccartney-beatles-breakup-979558|archivedate=December 31, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 1998 John Lennon anthology, ''[[Lennon Legend]]'', the composer credit of "Give Peace a Chance" was changed to "John Lennon" from its original composing credit of "Lennon–McCartney". Although the song was written by Lennon during his tenure with the Beatles, it was both written and recorded without the help of the band, and released as Lennon's first independent single under the "Plastic Ono Band" moniker. Lennon subsequently expressed regret that he had not given co-writing credit to Ono instead, who actually helped him write the song.&lt;ref name=PN/&gt; In 2002, McCartney released another live album, ''Back in the U.S. Live 2002'', and the 19 Beatles songs included are described as "composed by Paul McCartney and John Lennon", which reignited the debate over credits with Ono. Her spokesperson Elliott Mintz called it "an attempt to rewrite history", but nevertheless, Ono did not sue.&lt;ref name="billboard_controversy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73102/update-mccartney-reignites-beatles-credit-controversy|title=Update: McCartney Reignites Beatles Credit Controversy|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=February 14, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004204132/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73102/update-mccartney-reignites-beatles-credit-controversy|archivedate=October 4, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, after the Beatles released Lennon's "[[Free as a Bird]]" and "[[Real Love (John Lennon song)|Real Love]]", with demos provided by Ono, McCartney and his family collaborated with her and Sean to create the song "Hiroshima Sky is Always Blue", which commemorates the 50th anniversary of the [[Hiroshima Massacre|atomic bombing of that Japanese city]]. Of Ono, McCartney stated: "I thought she was a cold woman. I think that's wrong..... she's just the opposite..... I think she's just more determined than most people to be herself." Two years later, however, Ono publicly compared Lennon to [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], while McCartney, she said, more closely resembled his less-talented rival [[Antonio Salieri]].&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Gilbert. (January 27, 2003) "[http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/music/feature/2003/01/27/paul_yoko/index.html The ballad of Paul and Yoko] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619034926/http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/music/feature/2003/01/27/paul_yoko/index.html |date=June 19, 2009 }}". ''Salon''. Retrieved April 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This remark infuriated McCartney's wife [[Linda McCartney|Linda]], who was dying from breast cancer at the time, and when Linda died less than a year later, McCartney did not invite Ono to his wife's memorial service in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=Scot&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/features.cfm?id=531072002|location=Edinburgh, UK|work=The Scotsman|first=Precious|last=Williams|title=Eternal flame|date=May 19, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accepting an award at the 2005 [[Q Awards]], Ono mentioned that Lennon had once felt insecure about his songwriting. She had responded, "You're a good songwriter. It's not June with spoon that you write. You're a good singer, and most musicians are probably a little bit nervous about covering your songs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/yoko-ono-claims-she-was-misquoted-over-mccartney-outburst-319727.html?origin=internalSearch|work=The Independent|location=London|title=Yoko Ono claims she was misquoted over McCartney outburst|first=Ian|last=Herbert|date=October 15, 2005|accessdate=February 1, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225032027/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/yoko-ono-claims-she-was-misquoted-over-mccartney-outburst-319727.html?origin=internalSearch|archivedate=February 25, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2010 interview, Ono spoke about Lennon's "lost weekend" and her subsequent reconciliation with him. She credited McCartney with helping save her marriage to John. "I want the world to know that it was a very touching thing that [Paul] did for John."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/music/article2759900.ece#|title=Can't buy me love: Yoko tells how Paul saved her marriage to John|work=The Times|date=October 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While visiting with Ono in March 1974, McCartney, on leaving, asked "[W]hat will make you come back to John?"  McCartney subsequently passed her response to Lennon while visiting him in Los Angeles.  "John often said he didn't understand why Paul did this for us, but he did." In 2012, McCartney revealed that he did not blame Ono for the breakup of the Beatles and credited Ono with inspiring much of Lennon's post-Beatles work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul McCartney: Yoko Ono Didn't Break Up the Beatles|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/paul-mccartney-yoko-ono-didnt-break-up-the-beatles-20121029?fb_action_ids=10151294334734245&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_source=aggregation&amp;fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582|work=Rolling Stone|date=October 29, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901124457/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/paul-mccartney-yoko-ono-didnt-break-up-the-beatles-20121029?fb_action_ids=10151294334734245&amp;fb_action_types=og.likes&amp;fb_source=aggregation&amp;fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582|archivedate=September 1, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Julian Lennon===
{{main|John Lennon#Julian Lennon}}
Ono had a difficult relationship with her stepson [[Julian Lennon|Julian]], but the relationship has improved over the years. He has expressed disappointment at her handling of Lennon's estate, and at the difference between his upbringing and Sean's, adding, "when Dad gave up music for a couple of years to be with Sean, why couldn't he do that with me?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8933287/Julian-Lennon-blames-father-John-for-his-lack-of-children.html|title=Julian Lennon blames father John for his lack of children|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=December 4, 2011|accessdate=February 21, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327161916/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8933287/Julian-Lennon-blames-father-John-for-his-lack-of-children.html|archivedate=March 27, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; More egregiously, however, Julian was left out of his father's will, and he battled Ono in court for years, settling in 1996 for an unspecified amount that the papers reported was "believed to" be in the area of £20&amp;nbsp;million, which Julian has denied.&lt;ref name=Scot/&gt;

He has admitted that he is his "mother's boy", which Ono has cited as the reason why she was never able to get close to him: "Julian and I tried to be friends. Of course, if he's too friendly with me, then I think that it hurts his other relatives. He was very loyal to his mother. That was the first thing that was in his mind."&lt;ref name=yahoo1/&gt; Nevertheless, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian's photo exhibition at the Morrison Hotel in New York City in 2010,&lt;ref name="Rolling Stone"/&gt; appearing for the first time for photos with Cynthia and Julian.&lt;ref name=yahoo1/&gt; She also promoted the exhibition on her website, and Julian and Sean are close.&lt;ref name="Imagine Peace"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
Canadian rock band [[Barenaked Ladies]]' debut single was "[[Be My Yoko Ono]]," first released in 1990 and later appearing on their 1992 album ''[[Gordon (album)|Gordon]]''.&lt;ref name=FM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/_/Be+My+Yoko+Ono|title=Barenaked Ladies: Be My Yoko Ono|publisher=last.fm|accessdate=February 7, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105123126/http://www.last.fm/music/Barenaked+Ladies/_/Be+My+Yoko+Ono|archivedate=November 5, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lyrics are "a shy entreaty to a potential girlfriend, caged in terms that self-deflatingly compare himself to one of pop music's foremost geniuses".  It also has a "sarcastic imitation of Yoko Ono's unique vocal style in the bridge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/be-my-yoko-ono-mt0006937715|title=Barenaked Ladies: Be My Yoko Ono (Overview)|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=February 7, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129225235/http://www.allmusic.com/song/be-my-yoko-ono-mt0006937715|archivedate=January 29, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, American folk singer [[Dar Williams]] recorded a song titled "I Won't Be Your Yoko Ono".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.discogs.com/Dar-Williams-I-Wont-Be-Your-Yoko-Ono/release/3762272|title=Dar Williams - I Won't Be Your Yoko Ono|publisher=Discogs|accessdate=February 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryan Wawzenek of the website ''Ultimate Classic Rock'' described the song as "us[ing] John and Yoko as a starting point for exploring love, and particularly, love between artists".&lt;ref name="Ultimate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/yoko-ono-inspired-songs/|title=Top 10 Songs Inspired by Yoko Ono|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|accessdate=June 24, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619103724/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/yoko-ono-inspired-songs/|archivedate=June 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British band [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] mentioned Ono in their song "New York Morning" from their 2014 album ''[[The Take Off and Landing of Everything]]'' ("Oh, my giddy aunt, New York can talk / It's the modern Rome and folk are nice to Yoko"). In response Ono posted an open letter to the band on her website, thanking them and reflecting on her and Lennon's relationship with the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/elbow/75881|title=Yoko Ono thanks Elbow for new song 'New York Morning' in open letter|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=March 5, 2014|website=[[NME.com]]|accessdate=April 23, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308151301/http://www.nme.com/news/elbow/75881|archivedate=March 8, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s song "[[Bring the Noise]]", [[Chuck D]] and [[Flavor Flav]] rap, "Beat is for [[Sonny Bono]]/Beat is for Yoko Ono!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m07nCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=beat+is+for+sonny+bono+beat+is+for+yoko+ono&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_6z-qgvRPK&amp;sig=IcYIHza-HYHqw0LiPqmA1C50kYc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP89b825jVAhVD52MKHXSdB98Q6AEIRDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=beat+is+for+sonny+bono+beat+is+for+yoko+ono&amp;f=false|title=Dancing in Your Head: Jazz, Blues, Rock, and Beyond|first=Gene|last=Santoro|date=December 29, 1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=baaFL4PyjS0C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=beat+is+for+sonny+bono+beat+is+for+yoko+ono&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1rGgXCmp2f&amp;sig=u23Hdd8JxTX5m2hRro-ETNA3Kvc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP89b825jVAhVD52MKHXSdB98Q6AEISjAI#v=onepage&amp;q=beat+is+for+sonny+bono+beat+is+for+yoko+ono&amp;f=false|title=SPIN|first=SPIN Media|last=LLC|date=February 1, 1988|publisher=SPIN Media LLC|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
