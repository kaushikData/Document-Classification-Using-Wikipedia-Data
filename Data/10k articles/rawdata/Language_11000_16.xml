'''Abjuration''' is the solemn repudiation, abandonment, or renunciation by or upon [[oath]], often the [[renunciation of citizenship]] or some other [[right]] or [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]].  The term comes from the [[Latin]] ''abjurare'', "to forswear".

==Abjuration of the realm==
'''Abjuration of the realm''' was a type of abjuration in ancient [[English law]]. The person taking the oath swore to leave the country directly and promptly, never to return to the kingdom unless by permission of the sovereign. This was often taken by fugitives who had taken [[Sanctuary#Legal sanctuary|sanctuary]]:

{{quote|
I swear on the Holy Book that I will leave the realm of England and never return without the express permission of my Lord the King or his heirs. I will hasten by the direct road to the port allotted to me and not leave the King's highway under pain of arrest or execution. I will not stay at one place more than one night and will seek diligently for a passage across the sea as soon as I arrive, delaying only one tide if possible. If I cannot secure such passage, I will walk into the sea up to my knees every day as a token of my desire to cross. And if I fail in all this, then peril shall be my lot.
}}

==English Commonwealth==
Near the start of the [[English Civil War]], on 18 August 1643 Parliament passed "An Ordinance for Explanation of a former Ordinance for Sequestration of Delinquents Estates with some Enlargements." The enlargements included an oath which became known as the "Oath of Abjuration":
{{quote|I ..; Do abjure and renounce the Pope's Supremacy and Authority over the Catholic Church in General, and over my self in Particular; And I do believe that there is not any Transubstantiation in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, or in the Elements of Bread and Wine after Consecration thereof, by any Person whatsoever; And I do also believe, that there is not any Purgatory, Or that the consecrated Host, Crucifixes, or Images, ought to be worshipped, or that any worship is due unto any of them; And I also believe that Salvation cannot be Merited by Works, and all Doctrines in affirmation of the said Points; I do abjure and renounce, without any Equivocation, Mental Reservation, or secret Evasion whatsoever, taking the words by me spoken, according to the common and usual meaning of them. So help me God.&lt;ref&gt;C.H. Firth, R.S. Rait (editors (1911)). ''Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660'', "August 1643: An Ordinance for Explanation of a former Ordinance for Sequestration of Delinquents Estates with some Enlargements", [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=55851 pp. 254-260]. Date accessed: 16 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1656-7, it was reissued in what was for Catholics an even more objectionable form. Everyone was to be "adjudged a Papist" who refused this oath, and the consequent penalties began with the confiscation of two thirds of the [[Recusancy|recusant]]'s goods, and went on to deprive him of almost every civic right.&lt;ref name=CE-attribution&gt;{{catholic|inline=1|wstitle=English Post-Reformation Oaths}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Catholic Encyclopaedia]] make the point that the oath and the penalties were so severe that it stopped the efforts of the [[Gallicanism|Gallicanizing party]] among the English Catholics, who had been ready to offer forms of submission similar to the old oath of Allegiance, which was condemned anew about this time by Pope [[Innocent X]].&lt;ref name=CE-attribution/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=English Post-Reformation Oaths}} Cites Reusch, ''Index der verboten Bücher'' (Bonn, 1883)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland==
During [[The Killing Time]] of the 1680s an [[Abjuration Oath]] could be put to suspects where they were given the option to abjure or renounce their allegiances. The terms of the oath were deliberately designed to offend the consciences of the [[Presbyterian]] [[Covenanters]]. Those who would not swear "whether they have arms, or not" could be "immediately killed" by field trial "before two witnesses" on a charge of high treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wodrow |first1=Robert |title=The history of the sufferings of the Church of Scotland from the Restoration to the Revolution |date=1832 |publisher=Blackie |location=Glasgow |pages=154-155 |edition=Vol IV |url=https://archive.org/stream/thehistoryofthes04wodruoft#page/n163/search/refusing+to+answer |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Brown (Covenanter)|John Brown]] was included among those executed in this judicial process by John Graham (Bluidy Clavers) on 1 May 1685.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Terry |first1=Charles Sanford |title=John Graham of Claverhouse, viscount of Dundee, 1648-1689 |date=1905 |publisher=A. Constable |location=London |page=197 |url=https://archive.org/stream/johngrahamofclav00terruoft#page/196/search/abjuration |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wives and children of such men could also be put out of their houses if they had spoken to the suspect or refused the oath themselves.

==Great Britain and Ireland==
In England (and after 1707 Great Britain) the Oath of Abjuration denied the royal title of James II's heirs (i.e. the direct Catholic descendent of the House of Stuart exiled after the Glorious Revolution in 1688).  In [[England]], an Oath of Abjuration was taken by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]], clergy, and laymen, pledging to support the current [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] and repudiated the right of the [[House of Stuart|Stuarts]] and other claimants to the throne. This oath was imposed under [[William III of England|William III]], [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] and [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]]. It was superseded by the [[oath of allegiance]].  In Ireland the oath was imposed of state office holders, teachers and lawyers, and on clergy of the established church in from 1703, the following year it was on all Irish voters and from 1709 it could be demanded of any adult male by a magistrate.

==The Netherlands==
Another famous abjuration was brought about by the [[Act of Abjuration|Plakkaat van Verlatinghe]] of July 26, 1581, the formal [[declaration of independence]] of the [[Low Countries]] from the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish king]], [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. This oath was the climax of the [[Eighty Years' War]] (Dutch Revolt).

'''Akeu''' is a [[Loloish language]] mainly spoken in [[Jinghong]] and [[Mengla County]], China, with smaller populations of speakers in Burma, Laos, and Thailand. [[Gokhy language|Gokhy]] may be related.

==Distribution==
Akeu (Ake 阿克; autonym: Gouke 勾克) is spoken in the following locations of Yunnan (You 2013:172).&lt;ref name="You2013"&gt;You Weiqiong [尤伟琼]. 2013. ''Classifying ethnic groups of Yunnan'' [云南民族识别研究]. Beijing: Ethnic Publishing House [民族出版社].&lt;/ref&gt; The Akeu migrated from Mojiang County to the Sipsongpanna area 8 generations ago (about 300 years ago).

In [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]], '''articulation''' is the movement of the tongue, lips, jaw, and other speech organs (the '''articulators''') in ways that make [[Phone (phonetics)|speech sounds]]. 

Sound is produced simply by expelling air from the lungs.  However, to vary the sound quality in a way useful for speaking, two speech organs normally move towards each other to contact each other to create an obstruction that shapes the air in a particular fashion. The point of maximum obstruction is called the ''[[place of articulation]]'', and the way the obstruction forms and releases is the ''[[manner of articulation]]''.  For example, when making a ''p'' sound, the lips come together tightly, blocking the air momentarily and causing a buildup of [[air pressure]]. The lips then release suddenly, causing a burst of sound.  The place of articulation of this sound is therefore called ''{{lcons|bilabial}}'', and the manner is called ''{{lcons|stop}}'' (also known as a ''[[plosive]]'').

Articulation can be shown with [[magnetic resonance imaging]] to demonstrate how the tongue, lips and jaw move and the rise and fall of the [[soft palate]]. Such movement alters resonant properties of the vocal tract, and imposes a "time-varying formant structure" onto the speech signal.&lt;ref&gt;University of Southern California. [http://auditoryneuroscience.com/?q=vocalization/articulators Human articulators in action]. Video from the Speech Production and Knowledge Group website. Retrieved on 2013-01-01.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of articulation in making speech is called [[articulatory phonetics]].

==Place of articulation==
{{Place of articulation}}

An obstruction is necessarily formed when two articulators come close together.  Generally, one is moving (the [[active articulator]]), and the other is stationary (the [[passive articulator]]).  As a result, what is normally termed the "place of articulation" is actually a combination of a ''[[place of active articulation]]'' and a ''[[place of passive articulation]]''.  For example, the [[English language|English]] ''f'' sound is ''{{lcons|labiodental}}''—a shorthand way of saying that the active articulator is the lower lip, which moves up (along with the jaw in general) to contact the upper teeth.  The lower lip can also be the active articulator for other places of articulation (e.g. ''{{lcons|bilabial}}'', where it contacts the upper lip, as in English ''p'').  Likewise, the upper teeth can be the passive articulator for other places of articulation (e.g. ''{{lcons|dental}}'', where the tongue contacts the upper teeth, as in the English ''th'' sound).

The places of articulation used in English are:
*{{lcons|Bilabial}}: Both lips come together, as in ''p'', ''b'' or ''m''
*{{lcons|Labiodental}}: Lower lip contacts upper teeth, as in ''f'' or ''v''
*{{lcons|Dental}}: [[Tongue tip]] or [[tongue blade]] (part just behind the tip) contacts upper teeth, as in the two ''th'' sounds (e.g. ''thin'' vs. ''this'')
*{{lcons|Alveolar}}: Tongue tip contacts the [[alveolar ridge]] (the gums just behind the teeth), as in ''t'', ''d'', ''n'', or ''l''; or tongue blade contacts the alveolar ridge, as in ''s'' or ''z''
*{{lcons|Postalveolar}}: Tongue blade contacts the [[postalveolar]] region behind the alveolar ridge, as in ''sh'', ''ch'', ''zh'', or ''j''; or tongue tip contacts the postalveolar region, as in ''r''
*{{lcons|Palatal}}: Middle of tongue approaches or contacts the [[hard palate]], as in ''y''
*{{lcons|Velar}}: Back of tongue contacts the [[soft palate]] (or "velum"), as in ''k'', ''g'' or ''ng''
*[[Labialized velar consonant|Labiovelar]]: Back of tongue approaches the [[soft palate]] and lips also come close to each other, as in ''w''
*{{lcons|Laryngeal}}: No obstruction anywhere but in the [[vocal cord]]s down in the throat, as in ''h''

The place of articulation is clearest for [[consonant]]s, where there is generally a significant amount of obstruction.  For [[vowel]]s, part of the tongue moves closer to the roof of the mouth, but there is still enough of a gap that it is difficult to precisely specify the location of maximum obstruction.  As a result, vowels are normally described by ''height'' and ''frontness'' of the tongue (as well as amount of rounding of the lips) rather than by a specific place of articulation.  For example, the vowel in the first syllable of ''father'' is a ''[[low back unrounded vowel]]''; the vowel in ''tooth'' is a ''[[high back rounded vowel]]'', and the vowel in ''men'' is a ''[[low-mid front unrounded vowel]]''.

Sometimes there can be more than one obstruction (although rarely more than two).  There are two kinds of double obstruction: Either both obstructions block the air flow in equal amounts, or one obstruction blocks the air flow more than the other.  The former type, a [[doubly articulated consonant]], does not occur in English.  The latter type, however, is more common and does occur in English; ''w'' is one example.  With ''w'', the place of greatest obstruction, called the ''[[primary articulation]]'', occurs at the soft palate; the rounding of the lips causes less blockage, and is called the ''[[secondary articulation]]''.  Another example in English is the ''qu'' of words such as ''quit'', with the same primary and secondary articulations, but a complete blockage of the air at the soft palate rather than only a restriction of the flow (a difference in ''manner of articulation''; see below). (Note that the sound of ''qu'' is normally analyzed as a sequence of ''k'' plus ''w'', but both parts are actually pronounced at the same time.)

==Manner of articulation==
{{Manner of articulation}}
{{Main|Manner of articulation}}

"Manner of articulation" refers in general to characteristics of the speech organs other than the location of the obstruction(s).  There are multiple parameters involved here, and different types of each.  The manners of articulation used in English are:

1. Degree of stricture: How much blockage occurs at the [[primary articulation]] (the place of greatest obstruction).  The types in English are:
*[[stop consonant|Stop]]: Complete blockage followed by sudden release, as in ''t'', ''d'', ''p'', ''b'', ''k'', ''g''.  The blockage of air causes [[air pressure]] to build up; when released, the air bursts out, giving these sounds their characteristic sharp quality.
*[[Fricative]]: Incomplete blockage but still close enough to cause significant airflow turbulence, as in ''f'', ''v'', ''s'', ''z'', ''sh'', ''zh'' and both ''th'' sounds.  The turbulence causes the characteristic noisiness of fricatives.
*[[Affricate]]: Complete blockage followed by a gradual release, resulting in a combination of stop + fricative, as in ''ch'' and ''j''.
*[[Approximant]]: Incomplete blockage and far enough apart that airflow is smooth, as in ''r'', ''y'', ''w'', and ''h''.

2. Alternative air flow: The air travels a path other than down the center of the mouth: 
*{{lcons|Nasal}}: Complete blockage of air out the mouth but air can freely flow out the nose, as in ''m'', ''n'', ''ng''.
*{{lcons|Lateral}}: Complete blockage of air by the center of the tongue but air can flow out the sides of the tongue, as in ''l''.

3. Dynamic movement of the tongue: 
*{{lcons|Flap}}: Very brief complete blockage of air, in a way that doesn't cause any pressure buildup or release burst, as in the [[American English]] pronunciation of ''t'' and ''d'' between vowels.
*{{lcons|Trill}}: Multiple brief complete blockages in a row, caused by the active articulator (e.g. the tongue) vibrating.  A trilled ''r'' is well known in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and also occurs as the normal pronunciation of ''r'' by some [[Scottish English]] speakers.

Approximants, nasals, laterals, flaps, and trills are often grouped together as ''[[sonorant]]s'' or ''resonants'' (which also includes vowels); all of them have in common the fact that there is smooth airflow throughout the consonant, and they are nearly always voiced (see below).

==Voicing and aspiration==
{{Main|Phonation|voice onset time}}

[[Voice (phonetics)|Voicing]]: How closely the [[vocal cord]]s are placed together.  In English there are only two possibilities, ''voiced'' and ''unvoiced''.  Voicing is caused by the vocal cords held close by each other, so that air passing through them makes them vibrate.  All normally spoken vowels are voiced, as are all other sonorants except ''h'', as well as some of the remaining sounds (''b'', ''d'', ''g'', ''v'', ''z'', ''zh'', ''j'', and the ''th'' sound in ''this'').  All the rest are voiceless sounds, with the vocal cords held far enough apart that there is no vibration; however, there is still a certain amount of audible friction, as in the sound ''h''.  Voiceless sounds are not very prominent unless there is some turbulence, as in the stops, fricatives, and affricates; this is why sonorants in general only occur voiced. The exception is during [[whispering]], when all sounds pronounced are voiceless.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4759">'''Balaraba Ramat Yakubu''' (born 1959)&lt;ref&gt;Femke van Zeijl, [http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2016/03/illiterate-child-bride-famous-nigerian-novelist-160304155141087.html "From illiterate child bride to famous Nigerian novelist"], ''Al Jazeera'' (Features), 8 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Nigeria]]n author who writes in [[Hausa language|Hausa]]. She is a leader in the genre of ''[[littattafan soyayya]]'' or "love literature", and one of the very few Hausa-language writers whose work has been translated into English. She has also worked as a screenwriter, producer, and director of [[Kannywood]] films. Her stories have focused on issues such as forced marriages and women's education.

==Early life==
Balaraba Ramat Yakubu is the younger sister of General [[Murtala Ramat Muhammed]], who briefly served as the military ruler of Nigeria from 1975 until his assassination in 1976. 

At the age of 13, she was taken out of school and forced into an early marriage. She has said that this is the reason she writes in Hausa rather than English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=NigeriaFilms.com|title=I write in Hausa ‘cos I didn’t get Western education - Says Murtala Muhammed’s sister|url=http://www.nigeriafilms.com/content.asp?contentid=2774&amp;ContentTypeID=2|accessdate=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Basay''' was a [[Formosan language]] spoken around modern-day [[Taipei]] in northern [[Taiwan]] by the [[Basay people|Basay]], [[Qauqaut people|Qauqaut]], and [[Trobiawan]] peoples. Trobiawan, Linaw, and Qauqaut were other dialects (''see [[East Formosan languages]]'').

Basay data is mostly available from Erin Asai's 1936 field notes, which were collected from an elderly Basay speaker in Shinshe, [[Taipei]], as well as another one in [[Yilan City|Yilan]] who spoken the Trobiawan dialect (Li 1999). However, the Shinshe informant's speech was heavily influenced by Taiwanese, and the Trobiawan informant, named Ipai, had heavy Kavalan influence in her speech.

==Syntax==
There are four optional case markers in Basay (Li 1999:646).
*a &amp;ndash; nominative, ligature (Shinshe dialect)
*ta &amp;ndash; nominative (Trobiawan dialect)
*li &amp;ndash; locative (Shinshe dialect)
*u &amp;ndash; oblique (Trobiawan dialect)

Some function words include (Li 1999):
*pai 'future'

Trobiawan negators include (Li 1999):
*mia 'not' (Shinshe dialect: mayu 'not (yet)')
*asi 'don't' (Shinshe dialect: manai 'don't')
*(m)upa 'not to want'
*(Shinshe dialect: kualau 'not exist')

Yes-no questions are marked by ''u ~ nu'' (Li 1999:657).

==Morphology==
Basay verbs, like Kavalan verbs, distinguish between agent-focus (AF) and patient-focus (PF) verbs (Li 1999:650). The perfective prefixes na- and ni- are [[allomorph]]s.

'''Bicycle Mail''' - The topic of Bicycle Mail can cover two separate and distinctive areas. It can be used to describe the ''Thematic'' ([[topical stamp collecting|Topical]]) collecting and or study of stamps bearing the image of bicycles, or more commonly used to describe a specific category of [[Special delivery (postal service)|Special Delivery]], where mail was delivered by bicycle and is identified by stamp and or [[postal mark]] used.

==History==
Prior to the advent of Bicycle Mail, the most common forms of mail delivery was on foot, horse (local routes), and train for longer distances. In some countries Bicycle Mail became more prevalent during periods of railroad strikes to keep local mail routes active. It was also used as an alternative to horse and foot delivered mail in rural areas. By the 1930s most countries had greatly diminished the use of Bicycles for the delivery of mail in favor of the automobile for local delivery.

Some Bicycle Mail was used for local routes in an unofficial capacity. One example of this took place in 1896 in [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/05/09/102411141.pdf

|publisher = New York Times - 1896
| format=PDF
| date=1899-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States during the 1890s, a specific example of Bicycle Mail being used in place of rail delivery occurred during a strike on the established mail route between [[Fresno]] and [[San Francisco]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Bicycle mail is still used widely in Japan for delivery to government agencies which only accept the delivery of physical documents.

[[File:SevenSisterStates.svg|thumb|right|Northeastern states of India]]
The '''Bodo–Garo languages''' are a branch of [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] spoken in [[Northeast India]] and parts of [[Bangladesh]]. The name ''Bodo'' is not related with the Tibetan ethnonym ''bod'', which is the basis of the names ''Bodic'' and ''[[Bodish languages|Bodish]].''

Bodo–Garo languages were historically very widespread throughout the [[Brahmaputra Valley]] and in what are now the northern parts of [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name="Jacquesson2017"/&gt;

==Branches==
The Bodo–Garo languages are:
*'''[[Bodo languages]]''': [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Dimasa language|Dimasa]], [[Tiwa language (India)|Tiwa]], [[Kokborok]] (Tripuri), [[Kachari language|Kachari]] 
*'''[[Garo languages]]''': [[Garo language|Garo]], [[Megam language|Megam]]
*'''[[Koch languages]]''': [[Atong language (Sino-Tibetan)|Atong]], [[Koch language|Koch]], [[Ruga language|Ruga]], [[Rabha language|Rabha]]
*[[Deori language|Deori-Chutia]], [[Moran language|Moran]]
[[Hajong language|Old Hajong]] may have been a Bodo–Garo language.

[[Bodo language|Bodo]] is an official language of the Indian state of [[Assam]] and [[India]]. [[Kokborok]] (Tripuri) is one of the official languages of the state of [[Tripura]]. [[Garo language|Garo]] is an associate official language of [[Meghalaya]]. [[Megam language|Megam]] has been strongly influenced by [[Khasic languages]], while [[Deori language|Deori-Chutia]] by the [[Idu Mishmi language]]

Languages of the family feature [[subject–object–verb|verb-final]] word order.  There is some flexibility in the order of the arguments, but a [[nominative–accusative language|nominative–accusative]] distinction is marked with post-nominal [[clitic]]s.  The languages also prefix [[classifier (linguistics)|classifier]]s to [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s modifying nouns.  [[Grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]] are indicated using verbal [[suffix]]es.{{sfn|Wood|2008|p=7}}

==Classification==
===Joseph &amp; Burling (2006)===
Joseph &amp; Burling (2006:1-2) classify the Bodo-Garo languages into four major groups. Wood (2008:6) also follows this classification.
*[[Bodo languages]]: [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Tripuri language|Kokborok]], [[Tiwa language (India)|Tiwa]]
*[[Garo language|Garo]]
*[[Koch languages]]: [[Koch language|Koch]], [[Rabha language|Rabha]], Wanang, [[Atong language (Sino-Tibetan)|Atong]], and [[Ruga language|Ruga]]
*[[Deori language|Deori-Chutia]]

===Jacquesson (2017)===
Jacquesson (2017:112)&lt;ref name="Jacquesson2017"&gt;Jacquesson, François and van Breugel, Seino (2017). "The linguistic reconstruction of the past: The case of the Boro-Garo languages." In ''Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area'', 40, 90-122.{{doi|10.1075/ltba.40.1.04van}} [Note: English translation of the French original: Jacquesson, François (2006). ‘La reconstruction linguistique du passé: Le cas des language Boro-Garo’. ''Bulletin de la Société de Linguistique de Paris'' 101(1): 273–303.]&lt;/ref&gt; classifies the Bodo-Garo languages as follows, and recognizes three major branches (Western, Central, and Eastern). The [[Koch languages]] and [[Garo language|Garo]] are grouped together as Western Bodo-Garo.
*Western
**[[Garo language|Garo]]
**[[Rabha language|Rabha]], [[Koch language|Koch]]
*[[Bodo languages|Central]]
**[[Bodo language|Boro]], [[Bodo language|Mech]], Tiwa (Lalung)
**Bru
**[[Dimasa language|Dimasa]], 
**[[Tripuri language|Kokborok]]
*Eastern
**[[Deori language|Deori-Chutia]], [[Moran language|Moran]]

Jacquesson (2017)&lt;ref name="Jacquesson2017"/&gt; believes that the Bodo-Garo languages had arrived in their present location from the southeast, and notes similarities shared with [[Zeme languages]] and [[Kuki-Chin languages]].

==Reconstruction==
[[Wiktionary:Appendix:List of Proto-Bodo-Garo reconstructions|Proto-Bodo–Garo]] has been reconstructed by Joseph and Burling (2006) and by Wood (2008).

A '''boring bar''' is a [[tool]] used in [[metalworking]] and [[woodworking]]. [[Boring (manufacturing)|Boring]] is a technique used in many aspects of building.  Woodworkers have used boring as a form of drilling for centuries.  In woodworking, the boring tool is static in size and used to form circular plunge cuts. In metalworking, boring is slightly different in that the hole that results need not be circular. In metal boring the tool can be plunged and dragged on the X or Y axes to create a slot or asymmetrical hole or channel, or it may be moved only in an up-and-down motion (on the Z axis) to create a perfect circular hole.

==Components==
Modern boring tools have three primary components although many differing designs. The parts include the body, bar holder and dial screw (graduated micro screw). The body, made of solid stock, has two basic parts. The top part threads or presses into the supporting shank. The lower part (''bar holder'') is connected via dovetail, T-slots or a smooth notch with an adjustment for bore diameter via the ''dial screw''. As the dial screw is adjusted, the cutting bit/s are moved further out, creating a larger cut. This also can create some slight [[distortion]] if the cutting tool is moved further than the boring head is designed to support, if there is undue wear in the bearings supporting the tool or if the tool speed is too great for the off-balance effect caused by moving the tool too far from center. This is called ''unbalanced gyroscope precession''.&lt;ref&gt;http://physics-animations.com/Physics/English/mech.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Once the dial screw has been adjusted to give the proper cut a set screw is generally used to prevent any additional movement of the cutting head. The third basic part is the ''boring tool''.  Boring tools can be mounted vertically or horizontally in many boring head designs.

==Boring machines==
Boring can be done on [[milling machine|mills]], [[lathe]]s or [[drill press]] machines, either with a boring head or with just a boring tool. The shorter the distance between the tool holder and the material, the less distortion created from [[vibration]] or unbalanced gyroscopic effects. The greater the distance (static or dynamic mounts) the more flex in the tool or an increase in the imbalance of a moving tool. Use of a boring head increases the mass of the tool holder and decreases the distance. If a vibration is created it will be at a higher frequency and the deflection of the tool from the desired path will be much smaller and easier to erase through repetitive tool passes. In the case of a dynamic tool (mill or press), the balance of the tool can be adjusted with counterweights if the tool is mounted [[perpendicular]] to the shaft or the tool length can be decreased.

'''Brian Merriman''' or in Irish '''Brian Mac Giolla Meidhre''' (c. 1747 – 27 July 1805) was an [[Irish language]] poet and teacher. His single surviving work of substance, the 1000-line long {{lang|ga|Cúirt An Mheán Oíche}} ('''''The Midnight Court''''') is widely regarded as the greatest comic poem in the history of [[Irish literature]].

==Merriman's life==
Merriman in an oral account collected after his death was said to have been born illegitimately in [[Clondagad]] or [[Ennistymon|Ennistymon, County Clare]]. His mother was surnamed Quilkeen and his father's identity remains unknown.

Shortly after his birth, his mother married a stonemason who was working on the walls of the Deerpark estate in Ennistymon. The family moved to [[Feakle, County Clare|Feakle]] and some years later Merriman is known to have owned a 20-acre (81,000 m²) farm near Loch Gréine. He was a teacher of mathematics and is known to have taught the [[hedge school]] nearby in the townland of Kilclaren. He married around 1787 and had two daughters. In 1797, the [[Royal Dublin Society]] awarded him two prizes for his flax crop. Around 1800 he moved to [[County Limerick]], where he ran a school until his death. He is buried in Fiacla graveyard.

==''Cúirt An Mheán Oíche''==
The poem begins by using the conventions of the [[Aisling]], or vision poem, in which the poet is out walking when he has a vision of a woman from the other world. Typically, this woman is Ireland and the poem will lament her lot and/or call on her 'sons' to rebel against foreign tyranny. In Merriman's hands, the convention is made to take a satirical and deeply ironic twist.

In the opening section of the poem, a hideous female giant appears to the poet and drags him kicking and screaming to the court of Queen [[Aibell|Aoibheal]] of the Fairies. On the way to the ruined [[monastery]] at [[Moinmoy]], the messenger explains that the Queen, disgusted by the twin corruptions of [[Anglo-Irish]] landlords and [[English Law]], has taken the dispensing of justice upon herself. There follows a traditional court case under the [[Brehon law]] form of a three-part debate.

In the first part, a young woman calls on [[Aibell|Aoibheal]] declares her case against the young men of Ireland for their refusal to marry. She complains that, despite increasingly desperate attempts to capture a husband via intensive flirtation at [[hurling]] matches, [[wake (ceremony)|wake]]s, and [[pattern (devotional)|pattern days]], the young men insist on ignoring her in favour of late marriages to much older women. The young woman further bewails the contempt with which she is treated by the married women of the village.

She is answered by an old man who first denounces the wanton [[promiscuity]] of young women in general, suggesting that the young woman who spoke before was conceived by a [[Irish Traveller|Tinker]] under a cart. He vividly describes the [[infidelity]] of his own young wife. He declares his humiliation at finding her already pregnant on their wedding night and the gossip which has surrounded the "premature" birth of "his" son ever since. He disgustedly attacks the dissolute lifestyles of young women in general. Then, however, he declares that there is nothing wrong with his [[illegitimate child]]ren and denounces marriage as "out of date." He demands that the Queen outlaw it altogether and replace it with a system of [[free love]].

The young woman, however, is infuriated by the old' man's words and is barely restrained from physically attacking him. She mocks his inability to fulfill his marital duties with his young wife, saying that she was a homeless beggar who married him to avoid starvation. She vividly argues that if his wife has taken a lover, she well deserves one. She then calls for the abolition of [[priestly celibacy]], alleging that priests would otherwise make wonderful husbands and fathers. In the meantime, however, she will keep trying to attract an older man in hopes that her unmarried humiliation will finally end.

Finally, in the judgement section Queen Aoibheal rules that all laymen must marry before the age of 21, on pain of [[corporal punishment]] at the hands of Ireland's women. She advises them to equally target the romantically indifferent, homosexuals, and unmarried skirt chasers who boast of the number of notches on their belts. Aoibheal tells them to be careful, however, not to leave any man unable to father children. She also states that abolishing priestly celibacy is beyond her mandate and counsels patience.

To the poet's horror, the younger woman angrily points him out as a 30-year-old, [[bachelor]] and describes her many failed attempts to attract his interest in hopes of becoming his wife. She declares that he must be the first man to suffer the consequences of the new marriage law. As a crowd of infuriated women prepares to flog him into a quivering bowl of jelly, he awakens to find it was all a terrible nightmare.

The language of the poem is essentially the everyday [[Munster Irish]] of the time, the vernacular of Clare. In its frank and satirical treatment of sexuality, ironic parody of the [[battle of the sexes (game theory)|battle of the sexes]], and its biting [[social commentary]], ''Cúirt An Mheán Óiche'' is a unique document in the history of [[Irish poetry]] in either language.

''Cúirt An Mheán Oíche'' was never written down by its author and was preserved, like much Gaelic poetry, in an oral format. It was first published in 1850 in an edition by the Irish scholar [[John O'Daly]]. In the 20th century, a number of translations were produced, including notable English versions by [[Arland Ussher]], [[Frank O'Connor]], [[Edward Pakenham, 6th Earl of Longford]], [[David Marcus]], [[Ciarán Carson]], [[Thomas Kinsella]] and a partial translation by [[Seamus Heaney]]. [[Brendan Behan]] is believed to have written an unpublished version, since lost. O'Connor's translation, which is perhaps the most popular, was banned in Ireland by the [[Censorship of Publications Board (Ireland)|Censorship Board]] in 1946, because of the sexual frankness of the content.

''Cúirt an Mheán Oíche'' has been dramatised by Tom MacIntyre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irishplayography.com/person.aspx?personid=31938|title=www.irishplayography.com/person.aspx?personid=31938|website=www.irishplayography.com|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Celia de Fréine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.celiadefreine.com/biography.htm|title=Celia de Fréine - Biography|website=www.celiadefreine.com|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been turned into a comic opera by composer [[Ana Sokolovic|Ana Sokolović]] with English libretto by Paul Bentley.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.anasokolovic.com/en/music/work/vocal|title=Vocal|website=www.anasokolovic.com|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cumann Merriman'' was founded in 1967 to promote the poet's work. They run an annual [[Merriman Summer School]] in [[County Clare]] each August.

In 2005, the [[Clare County Library]] released a CD recording of a local [[seanchaí]] reciting ''Cúirt An Mheán Óiche'' in the traditional oral manner. Although it has not been made available for purchase, ''Cumann Merriman'' has posted excerpts on their website. For added contrast, the same passages are also reproduced from a modern dramatic reading of the poem.

In recent years, Merriman's poem and other Gaelic satires has been widely admired and translated by several modern Irish poets like [[Seamus Heaney]] and Thomas Kinsella.1

In a 1993 lecture on Merriman's life and work, Seamus Heaney declared, &lt;blockquote&gt;"Perhaps I can convey the ongoing reality of the poem's life more simply by recollecting a Saturday evening last August when I had the privilege of unveiling a memorial to Brian Merriman on the shore of [[Lough Graney]] in Co. Clare, where the opening scene of 'The Midnight Court' is set. The memorial is a large stone quarried from a hill overlooking the lake, and the opening lines are carved on it in Irish. The people who attended the ceremony were almost all from the local district, and were eager to point out the exact corner of the nearby field where the poet had run his [[hedge school]], and the spot on the lough shore where he had fallen asleep and had his vision. This was, and is, the first circle where Merriman's poem flourished and continues to flourish. Later that evening, for example, in a marquee a couple of miles down the road, we attended a performance by the [[Druid Theatre Company]] from Galway in which the poem was given a dramatic presentation with all the boost and blast-off that song and music and topical allusion could provide. Again, hundreds of local people were in the tent, shouting and taking sides like a football crowd, as the old man and the young woman battled it out and the president of the court gave her judgement. The psychosexual demons were no longer at bay but rampant and fully recognised, so that the audience, at the end of the performance, came away from the experience every bit as accused and absolved as the poet himself at the end of his poem. The 'profane perfection of mankind' was going ahead and civilisation was being kept on course; in a ceremony that was entirely convincing and contemporary, [[Orpheus]] has been remembered in Ireland."&lt;ref&gt;Seamus Heaney, ''The Redress of Poetry,'' faber and faber 1995, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Types of formulation==
Different psychological schools or models utilize clinical formulations, including [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT) and related therapies: [[systemic therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pinsof |first1=William |last2=Breunlin |first2=Douglas C. |last3=Russell |first3=William P. |last4=Lebow |first4=Jay |date=September 2011 |title=Integrative problem-centered metaframeworks therapy II: planning, conversing, and reading feedback |journal=[[Family Process]] |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=314–336 |doi=10.1111/j.1545-5300.2011.01361.x |pmid=21884073 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jay_Lebow/publication/51612401_Integrative_problem-centered_metaframeworks_therapy_II_planning_conversing_and_reading_feedback/links/02bfe50f5d274f10df000000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[psychodynamic therapy]],&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perry |first1=Samuel |last2=Cooper |first2=Arnold M. |last3=Michels |first3=Robert |authorlink3=Robert Michels (physician) |date=May 1987 |title=The psychodynamic formulation: its purpose, structure, and clinical application |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=144 |issue=5 |pages=543–550 |pmid=3578562 |ref=harv |doi=10.1176/ajp.144.5.543}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[applied behavior analysis]].&lt;ref name="Cipani"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cipani |first1=Ennio |last2=Golden |first2=Jeannie A. |date=2007 |title=Differentiating behavioral &amp; traditional case formulations for children with severe behavioral &amp; emotional problems |journal=International Journal of Behavioral Consultation and Therapy |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=537–545 |doi=10.1037/h0100821}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure and content of a clinical formulation is determined by the psychological model. Most systems of formulation contain the following broad categories of information: symptoms and problems; precipitating stressors or events; predisposing life events or stressors; and an explanatory mechanism that links the preceding categories together and offers a description of the precipitants and maintaining influences of the person's problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eells |first1=Tracy D. |last2=Kendjelic |first2=Edward M. |last3=Lucas |first3=Cynthia P. |date=Spring 1998 |title=What's in a case formulation?: development and use of a content coding manual |journal=The Journal of Psychotherapy Practice and Research |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=144–153 |pmid=9527958 |pmc=3330487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A model of formulation that is more specific to CBT is described by Jacqueline Persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Persons |first=Jacqueline B. |date=1989 |title=Cognitive therapy in practice: a case formulation approach |edition=1st |location=New York |publisher=[[W.W.

A psychodynamic formulation would consist of a summarizing statement, a description of nondynamic factors, description of core psychodynamics using a specific model (such as [[ego psychology]], [[object relations]] or [[self psychology]]), and a prognostic assessment which identifies the potential areas of [[psychological resistance|resistance]] in therapy.&lt;ref name="Perry"/&gt;

One school of psychotherapy which relies heavily on the formulation is [[cognitive analytic therapy]] (CAT).&lt;ref name="Ryle"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ryle |first=Anthony |authorlink=Anthony Ryle |date=2005 |chapter=Cognitive analytic therapy |editor1-last=Norcross |editor1-first=John C. |editor1-link=John C.

At around session four, a formal written reformulation letter is offered to the patient which forms the basis for the rest of the treatment. This is usually followed by a diagrammatic reformulation to amplify and reinforce the letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Denman |first=Chess |date=July 2001 |title=Cognitive–analytic therapy |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=243–252 |doi=10.1192/apt.7.4.243 |url=http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/7/4/243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many psychologists use an [[integrative psychotherapy]] approach to formulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Caspar |first1=Franz |last2=Silberschatz |first2=George |last3=Goldfried |first3=Marvin |last4=Watson |first4=Jeanne C. |date=March 2010 |title=Similarities and differences in four views of David |journal=[[Journal of Psychotherapy Integration]] |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=101–110 |doi=10.1037/a0018886}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eells |first=Tracy D. |date=December 2013 |title=In support of evidence-based case formulation in psychotherapy (from the perspective of a clinician) |journal=Pragmatic Case Studies in Psychotherapy |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=457–467 |doi=10.14713/pcsp.v9i4.1836 |url=http://pcsp.libraries.rutgers.edu/index.php/pcsp/article/view/1836}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is to take advantage of the benefits of resources from each model the psychologist is trained in, according to the patient's needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Persons |first=Jacqueline B. |date=December 2013 |title=Who needs a case formulation and why: clinicians use the case formulation to guide decision-making |journal=Pragmatic Case Studies in Psychotherapy |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=448–456 |doi=10.14713/pcsp.v9i4.1835 |url=http://pcsp.libraries.rutgers.edu/index.php/pcsp/article/view/1835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical evaluation of formulations==
The quality of specific clinical formulations, and the quality of the general [[theoretical model]]s used in those formulations, can be evaluated with criteria such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dawson |first1=David L. |last2=Moghaddam |first2=Nima G. |date=2016 |chapter=Formulation in action: an introduction |editor1-last=Dawson |editor1-first=David L. |editor2-last=Moghaddam |editor2-first=Nima G. |title=Formulation in action: applying psychological theory to clinical practice |location=Berlin; New York |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]] |pages=3–8 [7] |isbn=9783110470994 |oclc=932645602 |chapterurl=http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/20047/1/Formulation%20in%20Action%20-%20An%20introduction.pdf |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Clarity and parsimony'': Is the model understandable and [[Internal consistency|internally consistent]], and are key concepts discrete, specific, and non-redundant?
*''Precision and testability'': Does the model produce testable hypotheses, with [[Operational definition|operationally defined]] and [[Level of measurement|measurable]] concepts?
*''Empirical adequacy'': Are the posited [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanism]]s within the model [[Empirical research|empirically validated]]?
*''Comprehensiveness and generalizability'': Is the model [[holistic]] enough to apply across a range of clinical phenomena?
*''Utility and applied value'': Does it facilitate shared [[meaning-making]] between clinician and client, and are interventions based on the model shown to be [[Effectiveness|effective]]?

Formulations can vary in temporal scope from case-based to episode-based or moment-based, and formulations may evolve during the course of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schacht |first=Thomas E. |date=December 1991 |title=Formulation-based psychotherapy research: some further considerations |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |volume=46 |issue=12 |pages=1346–1347 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.46.12.1346 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ongoing monitoring, testing, and assessment during treatment are necessary: monitoring can take the form of session-by-session progress reviews using quantitative measures, and formulations can be modified if an intervention is not as effective as hoped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eells |first=Tracy D. |date=December 2013 |title=The case formulation approach to psychotherapy research revisited |journal=Pragmatic Case Studies in Psychotherapy |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=426–447 |doi=10.14713/pcsp.v9i4.1834 |url=http://pcsp.libraries.rutgers.edu/index.php/pcsp/article/view/1834}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Basseches |first1=Michael |last2=Mascolo |first2=Michael F. |date=2009 |chapter=Psychotherapy as a developmental process: implications and future directions for psychotherapy research, practice, and training |title=Psychotherapy as a developmental process |location=New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9780805857306 |oclc=244063508 |pages=283–312 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Psychologist [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]], who developed [[personal construct theory]] in the 1950s, noted his complaint against traditional diagnosis in his book ''The Psychology of Personal Constructs'' (1955): "Much of the reform proposed by the psychology of personal constructs is directed towards the tendency for psychologists to impose preemptive constructions upon human behaviour. Diagnosis is all too frequently an attempt to cram a whole live struggling client into a nosological category."&lt;ref name="Kelly vol.2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=George |authorlink=George Kelly (psychologist) |date=1991 |origyear=1955 |title=The psychology of personal constructs: volume two: clinical diagnosis and psychotherapy |location=London; New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] in association with the Centre for Personal Construct Psychology |isbn=9780415037983 |oclc=21760190 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iu6IAgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|154}} In place of nosological categories, Kelly used the word "formulation" and mentioned two types of formulation:&lt;ref name="Kelly vol.1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=George |authorlink=George Kelly (psychologist) |date=1991 |origyear=1955 |title=The psychology of personal constructs: volume one: theory and personality |location=London; New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] in association with the Centre for Personal Construct Psychology |isbn=9780415037976 |oclc=21760190 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V2KIAgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|337}} a first stage of ''structuralization'', in which the clinician tentatively organizes clinical case information "in terms of dimensions rather than in terms of disease entities"&lt;ref name="Kelly vol.2"/&gt;{{rp|192}} while focusing on "the more important ways in which the client can change, and not merely ways in which the psychologist can distinguish him from other persons",&lt;ref name="Kelly vol.2"/&gt;{{rp|154}} and a second stage of ''construction'', in which the clinician seeks a kind of negotiated integration of the clinician's organization of the case information with the client's personal meanings.&lt;ref&gt;See also, for example, the summary of Kelly's concepts in: {{cite thesis |type=D.Clin.Psy. thesis |last=White |first=Lauren |date=March 2014 |title=Borderline personality disorder: a personal construct approach |location=Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK |publisher=[[University of Hertfordshire]] |oclc=894598148 |url=http://uhra.herts.ac.uk/handle/2299/14439 |pages=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists [[Hans Eysenck]], [[Monte B. Shapiro]], [[Vic Meyer]], and Ira Turkat were also among the early developers of systematic individualized alternatives to diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Good practice guidelines on the use of psychological formulation |url=http://www.bps.org.uk/system/files/Public%20files/DCP/cat-842.pdf |website=bps.org.uk |location=Leicester, UK |publisher=[[British Psychological Society]] |date=December 2011 |accessdate=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} Meyer has been credited with providing perhaps the first training course of [[behaviour therapy]] based on a case formulation model, at the [[Middlesex Hospital Medical School]] in London in 1970.&lt;ref name="Bruch"/&gt;{{rp|13}} Meyer's original choice of words for clinical formulation were "behavioural formulation" or "problem formulation".&lt;ref name="Bruch"/&gt;{{rp|14}}

'''Collaborative editing''' is the editing  of groups producing works together through individual contributions. Effective choices in group awareness, participation, and coordination are critical to successful collaborative writing outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Lowry, Paul Benjamin, Aaron Mosiah Curtis and Michelle Rene Lowry. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=666141  "A Taxonomy of Collaborative Writing to Improve Empirical Research, Writing Practice, and Tool Development,"] ''Journal of Business Communication'' (JBC), Vol. 41, No. 1, pp. 66-99, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Collaborative writing is writing done by more than one person; they may discuss what they are going to write before they start, and discuss what they have written after they finish each draft they write.&lt;ref&gt;Dillon A. [https://arizona.openrepository.com/bitstream/handle/10150/105700/Ad1993.pdf?sequence=1 How Collaborative is Collaborative Writing? An Analysis of the Production of Two Technical Reports]., pages 69--86. Springer-Verlag, London, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The writing might be organized by dividing the writing into sub-tasks assigned to each group member, with the first part of the tasks done before the next parts, or they might work together on each task.&lt;ref&gt;Sharple M. [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-2009-4_5 Adding a Little Structure to Collaborative Writing]. Structure in what way. Springer-Verlag, London, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rimmershaw R. Collaborative Writing Practices and Writing Support Technologies, pages 15--28. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The writing is planned, written, and revised, and more than one person is involved in at least one of those steps.&lt;ref&gt;Ede L. and Lunsford A. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rQfEEhdKBnMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Singular Text/Plural Authors: Perspectives on Collaborative Authoring]. Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, discussions about the document's structure and context involve the entire group.&lt;ref&gt;Beck E.D. [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4471-2007-0_6 A Survey of Experiences of Collaborative Writing], pages 87--112. Springer-Verlag, London, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most usually it is applied to textual documents or programmatic [[source code]]. Such [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]] (non-simultaneous) contributions are very efficient in time, as group members need not assemble in order to work together. Generally, managing such work requires [[software]];&lt;ref&gt;Kuutti, Kari ''et al.'' (2003). [https://books.google.com/books?id=F_3RxNdMUNQC&amp;pg=PA315&amp;dq=collaborative+editing&amp;client=firefox-a#v=onepage&amp;q=collaborative%20editing&amp;f=false  ''ECSCW 2003: proceedings of the Eighth European Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work,'' p. 315.]&lt;/ref&gt; the most common tools for editing documents are [[wiki]]s, and those for programming, [[version control system]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
Most [[word processor]]s are also capable of recording changes; this allows editors to work on the same document while automatically clearly labeling who contributed what changes. New writing environments such as [[Google Docs]] provide collaborative writing/editing functionalities with revision control, synchronous/asynchronous editing. Another tool that uses collaborative editing is Addteq's [[Excellentable]]. Excellentable is an app for [[Confluence (software)|Confluence]] that enable users to collaborate on spreadsheets in real-time directly inside of Confluence.

[[Wikipedia]] is an example of a collaborative editing project on a large scale, which can be both good and bad, because of the large contributions by the public, Wikipedia has one of the widest ranges of material in the world. Unfortunately, this also leads to online 'graffiti', in which members of the public can submit incorrect information or random rubbish.
Collaborative writing can lead to projects that are richer and more complex than those produced by individuals. Many learning communities include one or more collaborative assignments. However, writing with others also makes the writing task more complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classweb.gmu.edu/nccwg/collab.htm |title=Online Writing Guide |publisher=Classweb.gmu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927055808/http://classweb.gmu.edu/nccwg/collab.htm |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is increasing amount of research literature investigating how collaborative writing can improve learning experiences.&lt;ref&gt;R.A Calvo and S.T O’Rourke and J.

See [[phrase structure rules]].]]

'''Colorless green ideas sleep furiously''' is a sentence composed by [[Noam Chomsky]] in his 1957 book ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'' as an example of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] that is [[grammatically]] correct, but [[semantically]] [[Nonsense|nonsensical]]. The sentence was originally used in his 1955 thesis "Logical Structure of Linguistic Theory" and in his 1956 paper "Three Models for the Description of Language".&lt;ref name="chomsky1956"&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Chomsky | first=Noam |date=September 1956 | doi=10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813 | title=Three Models for the Description of Language | journal=IRE Transactions on Information Theory | volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=113–124 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the sentence is grammatically correct, no obvious [[understandable]] meaning can be derived from it, and thus it demonstrates the distinction between [[syntax]] and [[semantics]]. As an example of a [[category mistake]], it was used to show the inadequacy of the then-popular probabilistic models of grammar, and the need for more structured models.

==Details==

Chomsky writes in his 1957 book ''[[Syntactic Structures]]'': {{quote|
# Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
# *Furiously sleep ideas green colorless.

It is fair to assume that neither sentence (1) nor (2) (nor indeed any part of these sentences) has ever occurred in an English discourse. Hence, in any statistical model for grammaticalness, these sentences will be ruled out on identical grounds as equally "remote" from English. Yet (1), though nonsensical, is grammatical, while (2) is not grammatical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Chomsky |first= Noam |authorlink= Noam Chomsky |title= Syntactic Structures |year= 1957 |publisher= Mouton |location= The Hague/Paris | page=15 |isbn= 3-11-017279-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the meaninglessness of the sentence is often considered fundamental to Chomsky's point, Chomsky was only relying on the sentences having never been spoken before. Thus, even if one were to ascribe a likely and reasonable meaning to the sentence, the [[grammaticality]] of the sentence is concrete despite being the first time a person had ever uttered the statement, or any part thereof in such a combination. This was used then as a counter-example to the idea that the human speech engine was based upon statistical models, such as a [[Markov chain]], or simple statistics of words following others.

==Attempts at meaningful interpretations==
The sentence can be partially interpreted through [[polysemy]]. Both ''green'' and ''colorless'' have figurative meanings, which allow ''colorless'' to be interpreted as "nondescript" and ''green'' as either "immature" or pertaining to environmental consciousness. The sentence can therefore be construed as "nondescript immature ideas have violent nightmares", a phrase with less oblique semantics. In particular, the phrase can have legitimate [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] too, if ''green'' is understood to mean "newly formed" and ''sleep'' can be used to figuratively express mental or verbal dormancy. "Furiously" remains problematic when applied to the verb "sleep", since "furiously" denotes "angrily", "violently", and "intensely energetically", meanings which are generally incompatible with sleep, dormancy, and unconscious agents typically construed as conscious ones, e.g. animals or humans, which truly "sleep".&lt;ref&gt;"Furiously" American Heritage Dictionary, 2014. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/furiously?s=t&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers have attempted to provide the sentence meaning through context, the first of which was written by Chinese linguist [[Yuen Ren Chao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Chao | first= Yuen Ren | authorlink= Yuen Ren Chao | title= Making Sense Out of Nonsense | url=http://www-linguistics.stanford.edu/Archives/Sesquipedalian/1996-97/msg00033.html  | work=The Sesquipedalian, vol. VII, no. 32 (June 12, 1997) | accessdate=2006-08-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060830210332/http://www-linguistics.stanford.edu/Archives/Sesquipedalian/1996-97/msg00033.html |archivedate = 2006-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, a literary competition was held at [[Stanford University]] in which the contestants were invited to make Chomsky's sentence meaningful using not more than 100 words of prose or 14 lines of verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/2/2-457.html#2 | title=LINGUIST List 2.457  | date= 1991-09-03| accessdate=2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- I've made some changes here to dictate sensical meaning vs. other meaning.  It's hard to argue that the sentence cannot have a meaning (meaningless) while it's easy to argue that it is patent nonsense (nonsensical).  The quote of Chomsky above indicates he felt the sentence to be nonsensical, not meaningless.  As such, providing any meaning at all to the sentence would be a counter-example to the position that it is meaningless, yet one would have to actually give a common and clear sensical meaning to be a counter-example of nonsense. [but "sensical" is not really a word] oops :( it's a colloquial word, but not appropriate for an encyclopedia entry. --&gt;
An example entry from the competition, from C.M. Street, is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It can only be the thought of verdure to come, which prompts us in the autumn to buy these dormant white lumps of vegetable matter covered by a brown papery skin, and lovingly to plant them and care for them. It is a marvel to me that under this cover they are labouring unseen at such a rate within to give us the sudden awesome beauty of spring flowering bulbs. While winter reigns the earth reposes but these colourless green ideas sleep furiously.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Using the triangle-box method, ''Colorless green ideas sleep furiously'' is divided into two phrases: [Colorless green ideas] and [sleep furiously] per the LINZ algorithm based on parts of intent. In the first phrase the word 'ideas' is the core (ZC), the main focus of the phrase. In the second phrase, there are no core but rather an action (TAP), which is the focus of the second phrase. Returning to the first phrase, the desire or intent of this phrase is 'ideas' (ZC). 'Colorless' and  'green' are boolean. Specifically description booleans (green) and its modifier (colorless). In the second phrase, 'sleep' is the action or intent of the phrase. Furiously is an intensity action type (ZAI). All triangle-box phrases consist of either a core, boolean and or TAP. This sentence contains the intent/desire or focus of ideas and sleep.  It can be inferred that sleep when done furiously produces colorless green ideas or ideas that are not clear and concrete.

==Statistical challenges==
Fernando Pereira of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] has fitted a simple statistical Markov model to a body of newspaper text, and shown that under this model, ''Furiously sleep ideas green colorless'' is about 200,000 times less probable than ''Colorless green ideas sleep furiously''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pereira |first=Fernando |year=2000 | url=http://www.cis.upenn.edu/%7epereira/papers/rsoc.pdf | title=Formal grammar and information theory: together again? | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society | volume=358 |issue=1769 |pages=1239–1253 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; | doi=10.1098/rsta.2000.0583}}. See also [http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000025.html this post] at [[Language Log]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This statistical model defines a similarity metric, whereby sentences which are more like those within a corpus in certain respects are assigned higher values than sentences less alike. Pereira's model assigns an ungrammatical version of the same sentence a lower probability than the syntactically correct form demonstrating that statistical models can learn grammaticality distinctions with minimal linguistic assumptions. However, it is not clear that the model assigns every ungrammatical sentence a lower probability than every grammatical sentence. That is, ''colorless green ideas sleep furiously'' may still be statistically more "remote" from English than some ungrammatical sentences. To this, it may be argued that ''no'' current theory of grammar is capable of distinguishing ''all'' grammatical English sentences from ungrammatical ones.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==Related and similar examples==
The pioneering [[France|French]] [[syntax|syntactician]] [[Lucien Tesnière]] came up with the [[French language]] sentence "[[Le silence vertébral indispose la voile licite]]" ("The vertebral silence indisposes the licit sail").

The game of ''[[exquisite corpse]]'' is a method for generating nonsense sentences. It was named after the first sentence generated in the game in 1925 ''Le cadavre exquis boira le vin nouveau'' (the exquisite corpse will drink the new wine).

In the popular game of "[[Mad Libs]]", a chosen player asks each other player to provide parts of speech without providing any contextual information (e.g., "Give me a proper noun", or "Give me an adjective"), and these words are inserted into pre-composed sentences with a correct grammatical structure, but in which certain words have been omitted. The humor of the game is in the generation of sentences which are grammatical but which are meaningless or have absurd or ambiguous meanings (such as 'loud sharks'). The game also tends to generate humorous [[double entendres]].

There are likely earlier examples of such sentences, possibly from the philosophy of language literature, but not necessarily uncontroversial ones, given that the focus has been mostly on borderline cases. For example, followers of [[logical positivism]] held that "metaphysical" (i.e. not [[Empirical validation|empirically verifiable]]) statements are simply meaningless; e.g. [[Rudolf Carnap]] wrote an article where he argued that almost every sentence from [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] was grammatically correct, yet meaningless. Of course, some philosophers who were not logical positivists disagreed with this.{{vague|date=April 2013|reason=pronoun reference}}

The philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] used the sentence "Quadruplicity drinks procrastination" in his “An Inquiry into Meaning and Truth” from 1940, to make a similar point; [[W.V. Quine]] took issue with him on the grounds that for a sentence to be false is nothing more than for it not to be true; and since quadruplicity doesn't drink ''anything'', the sentence is simply false, not meaningless.

In a sketch about linguistics, British comedy duo [[Fry and Laurie]] used the nonsensical sentence "Hold the newsreader's nose squarely, waiter, or friendly milk will countermand my trousers."

[[John Hollander]] wrote a poem titled [http://web.mit.edu/24.900/www/poem.html "Coiled Alizarine"] in his book ''[[The Night Mirror]]''. It ends with Chomsky's sentence.

[[Clive James]] wrote a poem titled "[[A Line and a Theme from Noam Chomsky]]" in his book ''[[Other Passports: Poems 1958-1985]]''. It opens with Chomsky's second meaningless sentence and discusses the [[Vietnam War]].

Another approach is to create a syntactically-correct, easily parsable sentence using nonsense words; a famous such example is "[[Gostak|The gostak distims the doshes]]". [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Jabberwocky]] is also famous for using this technique, although in this case for literary purposes; similar sentences used in neuroscience experiments are called [[Jabberwocky sentence]]s. In Russian schools of linguistics, the ''[[glokaya kuzdra]]'' example has similar characteristics.

Other arguably "meaningless" utterances are ones that make sense, are grammatical, but have no reference to the present state of the world, such as Russell's ''The present [[King of France]] is bald'' from [[On Denoting]] (also see [[definite description]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6259">'''Common Area Maintenance charges''', or '''CAM''' for short, are one of the net charges billed to tenants in a commercial [[triple net lease|triple net (NNN) lease]], and are paid by tenants to the landlord of a [[commercial property]]. A CAM charge is an additional rent, charged on top of base rent, and is mainly composed of maintenance fees for work performed on the [[common area]] of a property.

Each tenant pays their [[pro rata]] share of a property's total CAM charges, which prorated share is the percentage of the tenant's rented [[square footage]] of the total, rentable square footage of the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kovacs |first=Michael |url=http://www.orbablog.com/industries/real-estate/splitting-costs-cam-charges/ |title=Splitting Costs- CAM Charges » Ostrow Reisin Berk &amp; Abrams, Ltd |date= |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spadealaw.com/blog/2011/07/12/what-are-common-area-maintenance-charges-commercial-lease|title=What Are Common Area Maintenance Charges (CAM) In A Commercial Lease? &amp;#124; Spadea Lignana|last=|first=|date=2011-07-12|website=|publisher=Spadealaw.com|access-date=|accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common example of a CAM item is the cost of cleaning the walkways in a [[shopping mall]]. It is assumed that every tenant benefits from a clean environment, and should share in that cost. An example of a CAM that is charged to only a subset of tenants might be the charges for cleaning the [[food court]] area, where all of the vendors in the court collectively cover the higher cost of cleaning the tables on a frequent schedule.

== Breakdown of charges ==

Landlord and Tenant negotiate CAM charges before signing the [[lease]], so the charges vary from lease to lease, and operating costs that can be billed as CAM charges by the landlord vary from tenant to tenant. Generally, landlords want CAM charges defined so broadly that they can pass through a majority of their operating expenses to tenants.  The tenant generally wants CAM charges defined narrowly in hopes that the landlord pays a majority of the operating costs.

Examples of services often billed to tenants as CAM charges include [[portering]], parking lot striping, parking lot lighting, and landscaping.&lt;ref name="stevewatten.files.wordpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stevewatten.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/sp-3389981-v1-cam_costs__caps__audits_and_new_ideas12.pdf |title=CAM COSTS, CAPS, AUDITS AND NEW IDEAS: THE VIEW FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE TABLE |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
CAM charges can be broken into two subcategories—''controllable'' and ''uncontrollable''. Uncontrollable CAM charges are security costs, utilities, and snow removal expenses.  All other expenses charged as a CAM charge are considered controllable.

In certain leases, CAM charges also consists of administrative and management fees.  Administrative fees are a negotiated percentage of all costs of operating and maintaining a property. Management fees are a percentage of gross rents collected, which percentage is defined in the management agreement between the management company and ownership of the property.&lt;ref name="BeteshMarc"&gt;{{citation |author=Betesh, Marc E. and Nancy M. Davis |title=Negotiating Common Area Maintenance Costs |url=http://www.goulstonstorrs.com/portalresource/Article_ABAProbateProperty_N.Davids_5/09 |publisher=Probate &amp; Property |date=May–June 2009 |pages=40–45 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Caps and Floors ==
CAM charges are subject to wide variations as tenants move in and out and various inflationary items occur. This can make it difficult for both the tenant and landlord to predict their future cash flows with any accuracy. To address this, some leases include "cap" and "floor" terms which limit these changes to fixed values on a year-over-year basis.

A cap on CAM charges limits the amount by which CAM charges can rise each year, and are presented as a percentage.  Again, as with the CAM charges themselves, caps are also negotiated between the tenant and landlord, and thus vary from lease to lease.  Caps can be cumulative or compounded, and calculated year-over-base or year-over-year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Misonzhnik |first=Elaine |url=http://nreionline.com/mag/battle-over-cam-charges |title=The Battle over CAM Charges &amp;#124; mag content from National Real Estate Investor |publisher=Nreionline.com |date=1999-09-01 |accessdate=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Year-over-base caps allow the cap to raise each year by a certain, predetermined percentage of a pre-determined, initial (base) CAM charge.   Year-over-year caps mean the percentage increase applies not to a base amount, but to the actual CAM charge of the previous year. Cumulative caps allow the yearly percentage increase of the CAM Cap to accumulate.  Thus, a yearly 5% cap would grow the cap each year by 5%, so that the first year it was a 5% cap, the 2nd year a 10% cap, the third year 15, and so on. Compounded caps allow the yearly percentage increase of the CAM Cap to grow at a compounded rate each year.

If actual CAM charges are lower than the cap, the cap does not apply.&lt;ref name="BeteshMarc" /&gt; In these cases, a floor might be used instead. Floors are useful when there is some assumption that there will be inflation in CAM charges over time, even if there is no inflation in a given year. A floor will budget in a minimum increase in the charges, with the expectation that it will lessen a more major increase in the future.

== Recoveries ==

Also known as reconciliations, true-ups, and billbacks, CAM Recoveries are the annual reconciliation of the actual Common Area Maintenance Charges for a fiscal year versus the monthly charges billed to the tenant.

The monthly CAM charges a tenant pays as a part of the rent are actually estimates of that tenant's monthly, pro-rated CAM charge for the current fiscal year.  The estimate is created from a property's budget by the property manager.  After the fiscal year ends, an audit is done of the paid CAM charges versus the actual CAM charges, and the difference is either paid to the landlord, or the tenant.&lt;ref name="stevewatten.files.wordpress" /&gt;

'''Duruwa''' ([[Odia alphabet|Odia]]: ପରଜି, [[Devanagari]]: दुरुवा) or '''Parji''' is a [[Central Dravidian language]] spoken by the Dhurwa tribe, a [[scheduled tribe]] people of [[India]], in the districts of [[Koraput district|Koraput]] and [[Bastar district|Bastar]] in [[Chhattisgarh]] state. The language is related to [[Ollari language|Ollari]] and [[Kolami language|Kolami]], which is also spoken by other neighbouring tribes.

==Classification==
Duruwa is a member of the Central Dravidian languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Erik Mesterton''' (4 October 1903 &amp;ndash; 10 January 2004) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] author, literature critic and translator.

Together with poet [[Karin Boye]] he was editor for the influential culture magazine ''Spektrum'' in the 1930s ([[Modernist]] ([[T. S. Eliot]] was a favourite) and [[Freudian]] readings of literature were introduced. Mesterton lived in [[Gothenburg]] where he also did research on literature with scholars from the [[University of Gothenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oversattarlexikon.se/artiklar/Erik_Mesterton|title=Erik Mesterton – Svenskt översättarlexikon|website=www.oversattarlexikon.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n86132420/ Mesterton, Erik]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1951/lagerkvist-bibl.html Major translations into English]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=HTML&amp;rgn=div1&amp;byte=54505775&amp;pview=hide "Det öde landet." 1932.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''field card''' is a card that displays various pieces of data depicting field conditions of interest to [[real-estate]] agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Field cards and assessor's maps|url=http://www.bethel-ct.gov/content/117/125/129.aspx|website=Bethel, Connecticut|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assessor|url=http://chesterct.org/town-services/assessor/|website=Town of Chester|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The card is often modularized and shows abridged data for use in the field. The format of the card and the details listed follow a set template based on the nature and system of the work.

==Real estate==
A field card is used in the northeastern part of the [[United States]] to show real estate for properties. A typical field card provides a sketch of the property, description of the property, and information on owner, owner history, sales history, valuation, deed references, and dwelling and land details. Ancillary information such as past permits may also be shown on a field card.

In [[telecommunication]], a '''group alerting and dispatching system''' is a [[service feature]] that (a) enables a controlling [[telephone]] to place a [[telephone call|call]] to a specified number of telephones simultaneously, (b) enables the call to be recorded, (c) if any of the called lines is busy, enables the equipment to camp on until the busy [[telephone line|line]] is free, and (d) rings the free line and plays the recorded [[message]].

A '''gun chronograph''' or '''shooting chronograph''' is an instrument used to measure the velocity of a projectile fired by a gun.

==History==
[[Benjamin Robins]] (1707-1751) invented the [[ballistic pendulum]] that measures the [[momentum]] of the [[projectile]] fired by a [[gun]]. Dividing the momentum by the projectile [[mass]] gives the [[velocity]]. Robbins published his results as ''New Principles of Gunnery'' in 1742.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ingalls|1886|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Robins |first=Benjamin |title=New Principles of Gunnery |edition=New |year=1805 |publisher=F. Wingrave |url=http://google.com/books?id=3j8FAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ballistic pendulum could make only one measurement per firing because the device catches the projectile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bashforth|1866|p=3}}, "only one observation on each round".&lt;/ref&gt;  The gun's accuracy also limited how far down range a measurement could be made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bashforth|1866|p=3}}, "Beyond 295 feet the gun was not sufficiently accurate".&lt;/ref&gt;

An early chronograph that measures velocity directly was built in 1804 by [[Grobert]], a colonel in the French Army.  This used a rapidly rotating axle with two disks mounted on it about 13 feet apart.  The bullet was fired parallel to the axle, and the angular displacement of the holes in the two disks, together with the rotational speed of the axle, yielded the bullet velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Prony |contribution=Report of a method of measuring the initial Velocity of Projectiles discharged from Fire-arms, both horizontally and with different Elevations, made to the Physical and Mathematical Class of the National Institute |title=A Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts |editor-first=William |editor-last=Nicholson |volume=XI |year=1805 |location=London |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uwkAAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA42&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;f=false}} at page 42&lt;br/&gt; abridged from ''Journal des Mines'' No 92 p. 117, May 1804.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Harvtxt|Ingalls|1886|p=18}} describes Bashforth's chronograph that could make many measurements over long distances:
: In 1865 the Rev. [[Francis Bashforth]], M. A., who had then been recently appointed Professor of Applied Mathematics to the advanced class of artillery officers at [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Woolwich]], began a series of experiments for determining the resistance of the air to the motion of both spherical and oblong projectiles, which he continued from time to time until 1880.  As the instruments then in use for measuring velocities were incapable of giving the times occupied by a shot in passing over a series of successive equal spaces, he began his labors by inventing and constructing a chronograph to accomplish this object, which was tried late in 1865 in Woolwich Marshes, with ten screens, and with perfect success.

The Bashforth screens were made with several threads and series connected switches. A projectile passing through a screen would break one or more threads, the broken thread caused a switch to momentarily (about 20&amp;nbsp;ms) interrupt a current as the switch arm moved from its weighted position to its unweighted position, and the momentary interruption would be recorded on a paper chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bashforth|1866|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern chronograph==
The modern chronograph consists of two sensing areas called ''chronograph screens'', which contain [[photodetector|optical sensors]] that detect the passage of the bullet.  The bullet is fired so it passes through both screens, and the time it takes the bullet to travel the distance between the screens is measured electronically.

The first electronic ballistic chronograph was invented by Kiryako ("Jerry") Arvanetakis in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} As consulting engineer under contract by NACA (later [[NASA]]), he was asked to find a way to accurately measure the velocity of various projectiles fired at [[hypersonic|hyper-velocities]] into a variety of engineered materials in anticipation of manned space flight. His first design was an open rectangular frame of square [[aluminum]] tubing with a screen of fine copper wire at both ends. Breaking the first wire started charging a [[capacitor]], breaking the second wire stopped it. Measuring the accumulated voltage and knowing the rate of charge the elapsed time could be accurately calculated.

The '''Institute of English Studies''' (abbreviated as '''IES''') is a centre of excellence in the research, promotion and facilitation in the field [http://www.instituteofenglish4u.com/ English] Literature and Language.  With a specialisation in [[history of books|book history]], [[palaeography]] and textual scholarship, the IES facilitates the advanced study and research of English Studies in the national and international academic community.  The Institute, located in [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]], London,  is one of the nine [http://www.instituteofenglish4u.com/spoken-english/ institutes] that together comprise the [[School of Advanced Study]], [[University of London]].

==History==
The Institute was founded as  the Centre for English Studies in 1991. Institute status was conferred by the University Council on 2 December 1998, and it officially became known as the Institute of English Studies on New Year's Day, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ies.sas.ac.uk/about-us History and Overview of the Institute of English Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute faced closure in 2014&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/may/22/university-london-plan-close-institute-english-studies-damned Guardian: University of London plan to close Institute of English Studies condemned]&lt;/ref&gt;, but a successful campaign in 2014&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/news/institute-of-english-studies-planned-closure-put-on-hold/2013547.article THS: Institute of English Studies planned closure put on hold]&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in the reversal of this decision.

== Networks ==
The Institute is partner in a number of important research networks and collaborations.  In 2001 it helped establish the Centre for Manuscript and Print Studies, a collaboration between The British Library, St Bride Library, University of London Research Library Services (ULRLS), The English Department, University of Birmingham, School of English, University of Reading, Literature Department, Open University, The Shakespeare Institute, and The Centre for Textual Studies, De Montfort University. It hosts and administers two prestigious and distinguished societies: [http://www.bibsoc.org.uk The Bibliographical Society] and [http://malonesociety.com/ The Malone Society] and provides administrative support to the [http://palaeography.org.uk/ London Palaeography Teachers' Group]. The Institute has an established academic partnership with the [[Blackburn Museum and Art Gallery]].

== Research ==
The '''Institute''' is a leading organisation in the research of English literary studies. Current projects include:

The ‘’’Laius complex’’’ revolves around the paternal wish for [[filicide]], particularly for the extinction of the male heir, in an attempt to ensure one will have no successors.

==Mythological background==
Indo-European mythology contains a number of stories of foundlings, like [[Cyrus the Great]] or [[Romulus and Remus]], outcast after a prophesy that they will replace the dynasty into which they are born.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marino, in R. Preiss ed., ''Childhood, Education and the Stage in Early Modern England'' (Cambridge 2017) pp. 232–3&lt;/ref&gt;  In Greek mythology, [[Cronus]] (Roman [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]) had devoured his young because of his fear that one would supersede him.&lt;ref&gt;F Guirand, ''New Larousse Encyclopedia of Mythology'' (London 1968) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; [[Laius]] in the story of [[Oedipus]] similarly casts the latter out to die as an infant because of (in the words of [[Sophocles]]) "some wicked spell … . Saying the child would kill its father".&lt;ref&gt;Sophocles, ''The Theban Plays'' (Penguin 1973) p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==From myth to complex==
Whereas [[Freud]] had laid stress on Oedipus’s filial violence against his father, [[George Devereux]] in 1953 introduced the term 'Laius complex' to cover the corresponding feelings on the part of the father – what he called the "'counter-oedipal' (Laius) complex".&lt;ref&gt;G Devereux, ''Dreams in Greek Tragedy'' (1976) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Later explorations of [[masculinity]] have placed the aggressive aspects of the Laius complex within the broader frame of mammalian aggression against their young:&lt;ref&gt;J. M.

Two specific psychosexual aspects of the complex have been particularly highlighted.

Faimberg, ''The Telescoping of Generations'' (2005) pp. 72–3&lt;/ref&gt;

How far the playing down of the Laius neurosis (in orthodox psychoanalysis)&lt;ref&gt;H. Faimberg, ''The Telescoping of Generations'' (2005) p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; can be linked to what [[Julia Kristeva]] called Freud's "paternal vision of childhood",&lt;ref&gt;J. Kristeva, ''Desire in Language'' (New York 1980) pp. 274–5 &lt;/ref&gt; remains for the 21st century an open question.&lt;ref&gt;J. Marino, in R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33621">The '''language policies of Canada's province and territories''' vary substantially between different regions and also between different eras.

From the 1890s until the 1960s, English was the only language in which most government services were provided outside of [[History of Quebec|Quebec]] (which was functionally bilingual) and using French in the courts or in schools was often illegal. These developments led to fears by [[French Canadian|French-Canadian]] nationalists that French speakers would be assimilated into the increasingly Anglophone culture of Ontario, leading the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]] (1963–1969) to recommend that the [[Government of Canada]] and [[Provinces and territories of Canada|all provinces]] offer more services in French.

Since that time, Quebec has used provincial law to encourage the use of French (see [[Charter of the French Language]]) at the expense of other languages, while the other provinces have begun to offer more and more services in French and in [[Languages of Canada|other languages besides English]], including [[Languages of Canada#Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]] and [[immigrant language]]s.&lt;ref name="Morton2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Lee Morton|title=Law, Politics and the Judicial Process in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dj_4_H35nmYC&amp;pg=PA509|year=2002|publisher=University of Calgary Press|isbn=978-1-55238-046-8|page=509}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Amendments to the Constitution of Canada|1982 amendments]] to the [[Constitution of Canada]] included a right of minority-language education that has forced policy changes in all of the provinces. Quebec is unique in requiring private businesses to use French and requiring immigrants to send their children to French-language schools. In other provinces there is no requirement that businesses use a particular language, but English predominates, and immigrants may send their children to English, French or third-language schools.&lt;ref name="Carens1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph H. Carens|title=Is Quebec Nationalism Just?: Perspectives from Anglophone Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-agrT6RVkwoC&amp;pg=PA61|year=1995|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=978-0-7735-1342-6|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History (before 1982) ==
{{further|Timeline of official languages policy in Canada}}

At the time of [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, English and French were made the [[official language]]s of debate in the [[Parliament of Canada]] and the [[Quebec Legislature|Parliament of Quebec]]. No specific policies were enacted for the other provinces, and no provisions were made for the official languages to be used in other elements of the government such the courts, schools, post offices, and so on. The official language policies of the provinces and territories were initially set when they were created by the federal government, or in the case of provinces that were separate colonies before joining Confederation ([[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]], [[History of Prince Edward Island|Prince Edward Island]], and [[History of British Columbia|British Columbia]]) were inherited from their own histories. Language policies in all provinces have evolved over time in response to changing demographics, public attitudes, and legal rulings.

=== The Prairies ===
Prior to becoming part of Canada in 1869, English was a minority language in the [[Canadian Prairies|Prairies]], where French and Aboriginal languages were more common. The arrival of settlers from [[History of Ontario|Ontario]], the [[British Isles]], and the [[United States]] changed the demographic balance, however. One of the outcomes of the [[Red River Rebellion]] of 1870 was the creation of [[History of Manitoba|Manitoba]] as an officially bilingual province, to protect the French-speaking [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] from being overpowered by the incoming English speaking settlers. This guarantee failed, however, and in the aftermath of the [[Manitoba Schools Question]], that province was allowed to become officially English-only, until these policies were declared unconstitutional in 1985.

The [[Northwest Territories Act]] of 1891 made English and French official languages in the rest of the [[Western Canada|Canadian West]]. But in 1892 the [[Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories|Legislature of the Northwest Territories]] declared itself English-only.

This trend continued to the creation of the new provinces of [[History of Alberta|Alberta]] and [[History of Saskatchewan|Saskatchewan]] in 1905, and beyond. {{quote|By the time Alberta was made a province in 1905, the French language had been dealt a series of aggressive blows, and the use of French in government, the courts and schools was made illegal.|Alberta Online Encyclopedia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abheritage.ca/stvincent-stpaul/franco_alta/themes_language_en.html |title=Alberta Online Encyclopedia - Saint Vincent and St. Paul - Language |publisher=Abheritage.ca |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Effect of the ''Charter'' on the provinces and territories ==
[[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] guarantees that Canadian-born or educated parents (not recent immigrants) have a right to educate their children in their choice of either French or English wherever there are "sufficient numbers". This was a major change in that education is normally considered solely provincial jurisdiction, and policy had been [[Majority rule|majoritarian]]. Court cases such as ''[[Doucet-Boudreau v Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)]]'' have indicated that this is a [[Negative and positive rights|positive right]] that demands timely and sufficient action from the provincial governments.

==Officially bilingual or multilingual provinces/territories==
New Brunswick and Canada's three territories have all given official status to more than one language. In the case of New Brunswick, this means perfect equality. In the other cases, the recognition sometimes amounts to a formal recognition of official languages, but limited services in official languages other than English. Manitoba was officially bilingual at its creation, became officially Anglophone only, but this was later reversed by the courts.

=== The territories ===
{{see also|Franco-Ténois|Franco-Yukonnais}}
*[[Northwest Territories]]: [[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], [[Cree language|Cree]], English, French, [[Gwich’in language|Gwich’in]], [[Inuinnaqtun]], [[Inuktitut]], [[Inuvialuktun]], [[Slavey language|North Slavey]], South Slavey and [[Tłı̨chǫ language|Tłįchǫ or Dogrib]].
*[[Nunavut]]: English, Inuktitut, Inuinnaqtun, and French.
*[[Yukon]]: English and French.

=== New Brunswick ===
New Brunswick has been officially bilingual since the passing of the ''[[Official Languages in New Brunswick Act (1969)]]''. This was complemented by ''[[An Act Recognizing the Equality of the Two Official Linguistic Communities in New Brunswick]]'' in 1981. New Brunswick's bilingualism was constitutionally enshrined in the ''Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' in 1982. The ''Charter'' was amended in 1993 to clarify that the two language communities are legally equal. In 1999 the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled in ''[[Moncton (City) v. Charlebois]]'' that New Brunswick's official bilingualism also applied to municipalities in the province. In 2002 the ''[[Official Languages Act (New Brunswick)|Official Languages Act]]'' became New Brunswick's new language law, leading to the creation of the [[Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages for New Brunswick]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legal-info-legale.nb.ca/en/.../History_of_Language_Rights_ENG.pdf ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manitoba ===
{{see also|Franco-Manitoban}}
{{quote|Manitoba stands out amongst the provinces as a province with a small Francophone linguistic minority but above-average constitutional protection of this minority.|Fraser Institute&lt;ref&gt;Vallincourt et al., viii&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Manitoba was established as an officially bilingual province under section 23 of the [[Manitoba Act]], 1870. However, in subsequent years the provincial government moved to end French-language services and become English-only. In the famous Supreme Court of Canada case ''[[Reference Re Manitoba Language Rights]]'' of 1985 the court found these policies unconstitutional. The province of Manitoba is now overwhelmingly English-speaking and the first language of the courts, government ministries, and schools is English. However, in order to comply with the court's ruling the province is required to provide nearly all its services in French (as well as English). The government's policy is summarized in the ''French Language Services Policy'', last updated in March 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/fls-slf/pdf/fls_policy.pdf|format=PDF|title=French-Language Services Policy |date=May 2017|website=Gov.mb.ca|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regionalized bilingualism: Ontario ==
{{see also|Franco-Ontarian}}
Ontario has a regionalized language policy, where part of the province is English-only and other areas are bilingual. Province-wide services (such as websites and toll-free telephone numbers) are provided in both English and French. However individuals only have a ''right'' to French-language services in certain designated regions of the province under the ''[[French Language Services Act]]'' (1986). There are 25 regions so designated. These are: areas with 10% or more Francophones; urban centres with 5,000 or more Francophones; and areas previously designated by the [[Government of Ontario]] between 1978 and 1985.&lt;ref name="ontario.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/en/communities/francophones/profile/ONT05_024287.html |title=Profile of Ontario's Francophone Community, 2009: Concepts and Definitions |publisher=Ontario.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably this includes [[Toronto]], the provincial capital and Canada's largest municipality (although not all of the [[regional municipalities]] of the [[Greater Toronto Area|GTA]] are included), and the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]] including [[Ottawa]], the national capital, as well as many other cities, counties, districts, townships, and towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofa.gov.on.ca/en/flsa-mapdesig.html |title=Government of Ontario - Office of Francophone Affairs: Map of Designated Areas |publisher=Ofa.gov.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purposes of the policy, the definition of a "Francophone" was broadened in 2009. Previously it included only mother-tongue speakers, however it now includes [[Allophone (Canada)|allophones]] (people whose [[first language]] is neither French or English) who "have particular knowledge of French as an official language and use French at home, including many recent immigrants to Ontario for whom French is the language of integration".&lt;ref name="ontario.ca"/&gt;

==Officially French-only: Quebec==
Until 1969, Quebec was the only officially bilingual province in Canada and most public institutions functioned in both languages. English was also used in the legislature, government commissions and courts.

''[[An Act to promote the French language in Québec]]'' was passed in 1969 by the [[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]] government of [[Jean-Jacques Bertrand]]. It required the [[Ministry of Education, Recreation and Sports (Quebec)|education ministry]] to ensure that French as a [[second language]] was taught to all English-speakers and immigrants in Quebec, but allowed [[Québécois (word)|Quebecers]] freedom of choice in deciding in which language to educate their children. This was considered too weak by many [[Quebec nationalism|Quebec nationalists]], leading to the creation of the [[Mouvement Québec français]] and increased support for the new [[Parti Québécois]].

From 1968 to 1973, the [[Commission of Inquiry on the Situation of the French Language and Linguistic Rights in Quebec]] investigated how to strengthen the position of French in Quebec. Its recommendations led to the passage of the [[Official Language Act (Quebec)|''Official Language Act'']] or "Bill 22" in 1974 by the [[Quebec Liberal Party]] government of [[Robert Bourassa]]. This made French the sole official language of Quebec and required its use in business.

Bill 22 was replaced by the ''Charter of the French Language'' (Bill 101) by Quebec's [[National Assembly of Quebec|National Assembly]] in August 1977, under the Parti Québécois government led by [[René Lévesque]]. It is structured as a list of rights, where everyone in Quebec has the right to be served in French by the government and businesses, and also provides rights for speakers of English and aboriginal languages. Most government services are available in both French and English. Regional institutions in the [[Nunavik]] region of [[Nord-du-Québec|northern Quebec]] offer services in [[Inuktitut]] and [[Cree language|Cree]].

Several legal challenges have been raised against Bill 101 in the ongoing [[legal dispute over Quebec's language policy]]. In 1988, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in ''[[Ford v Quebec (AG)]]'' that the ban on outdoor signs in languages other than French was unconstitutional. The government of Quebec choose to invoke the "[[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|notwithstanding clause]]" to shield the legislation from the courts. The [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] ruled similarly in ''[[Ballantyne v Canada]]'' in 1993. The ban on non-French signs was lifted with the passage of [[Bill 86]] in 1993.

==Officially English with services in French and other languages==
Most provinces have laws that make either English or both English and French the official language(s) of the legislature and the courts, but may also have separate policies in regards to education and the bureaucracy.

=== Alberta ===
{{see also|Franco-Albertan}}
Alberta inherited its English-only status from the Northwest Territories in 1905, and this was strengthened over time. The [[Language Act]] 1988, reaffirmed the unilingual English nature of the province,&lt;ref&gt;Vaillancourt, et al., viii&lt;/ref&gt; while recognizing a right to use French in the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]] and before certain courts.&lt;ref name="municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca/documents/Francophone_Secretariat_Library/Alberta_-_Profil_linguistique_-_eng.pdf|title=Municipal Affairs: Error Message - 404 Page Not Found|first=Alberta|last=Government|website=www.municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Language Policy in Education (1978) requires [[Board of education|school boards]] to establish French programs at the request of a local advisory committee.&lt;ref name="municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca"/&gt; The [[Schools Act]] recognizes a right to instruction in French for the official language minority (1988) and right of Francophones to manage their own schools (1993).&lt;ref name="municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca"/&gt; Laws are drafted solely in English and there is no legal requirement that they be translated into French. French may be used [[Speech|orally]] in all [[Provincial Court of Alberta|provincial courts]] in Alberta. There is no requirement that healthcare services be provided in French, and it is left up to the initiative of individual hospitals and clinics.&lt;ref name="municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca"/&gt; There is no requirement that [[social services]] be provided in French and this is left up to individual [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and charities that work with the provincial government.&lt;ref name="municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca"/&gt; Other government services are provided in English only, except where the [[Executive Council of Alberta|provincial government]] sees a need for French, including tourism and immigration, or where the federal government has provided funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/offlangoff/entente-agreement/services/ab/index-eng.cfm |title=Canadian Heritage - Services - Alberta |publisher=Pch.gc.ca |date=2008-12-09 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no official policy requiring municipalities in Alberta to provide services in French, but the Alberta Bilingual Municipalities Network includes the communities of [[Beaumont, Alberta|Beaumont]], [[Legal, Alberta|Legal]], [[Falher]], [[Plamondon, Alberta|Plamondon]], [[Morinville]], [[St. Albert, Alberta|St. Albert]], [[St. Paul, Alberta|St. Paul]], [[Bonnyville]] and the [[Municipal District of Smoky River No. 130|Smoky River Municipal District]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=471088AC318FE-0275-478A-29387B822D1D55A4|title=Alberta unveils first French policy {{!}} Alberta.ca|last=Alberta|first=Government of|website=www.alberta.ca|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1993 there have been distinct [[List of school authorities in Alberta|separate and public]] Francophone school boards in Alberta in addition to the existing [[Education in Alberta|public]] and [[separate school]] boards which also offer [[French immersion]].&lt;ref name="municipalaffairs.gov.ab.ca"/&gt; Besides French the government does not offer most services in many other languages, but there are exceptions.

In June 2017 the province unveiled a [http://www.culturetourism.alberta.ca/francophone-secretariat/english/docs/FINAL_French%20Policy%20Document_English%20for%20Web_13JUNE17.pdf new French Policy] aimed at improving services for Franco-Albertans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The province maintains a partial French version of its website, bonjour.alberta.ca.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bonjour.alberta.ca/|title=Bonjour Alberta|last=Government of Alberta|first=|date=|website=www.bonjour.alberta.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nova Scotia ===
Nova Scotia has no legal requirement to provide any services in a language other than English, which was already well-established as the official language when the province joined Confederation in 1867. However the province has an Office of Gaelic Affairs whose mission is "to work with Nova Scotians in the renewal of [[Canadian Gaelic|Gaelic language]] and culture in the Province"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.ns.ca/oga/about_us.asp?lang=en |title=About Us - Office of Gaelic Affairs - Government of Nova Scotia |publisher=Gov.ns.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an Office of Acadian Affairs: {{quote|to offer advice and support to provincial government departments, offices, agencies and Crown corporations so that they can develop and adapt policies, programs, and services that reflect the needs of the [[Acadians|Acadian]] and francophone community.|Office of Acadian Affairs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/acadian/en/index.htm |title=Acadian Affairs - Home |publisher=Gov.ns.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The province also maintains a French-language web portal, gov.ns.ca/bonjour&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gov.ns.ca/bonjour/ |title=Bonjour! &amp;#124; Government of Nova Scotia |publisher=Gov.ns.ca |date=2011-07-25 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prince Edward Island ===
{{quote|During the first half of the 20th century, there were 60 French language schools in Prince Edward Island.

=== Saskatchewan ===
{{see also|Fransaskois}}
In Saskatchewan, a 1968 amendment to the School Act permitted the establishment of designated French schools. Prior to this date, English was the only language which could be used as a language of instruction in Saskatchewan schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sasked.gov.sk.ca/docs/policy/multi/hert.html.waq13102009 |title=Multicultural Education and Heritage Language Education policies |publisher=Sasked.gov.sk.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Language Act]] {{quote|provides that all acts and regulations can be enacted, printed and published in English or in English and French.

==''De facto'' English only==

=== British Columbia ===
{{see also|Franco-Columbian}}
Access to French-language education in British Columbia is determined not only by ''Charter'' rights under Section 23, but also by a provincial policy decision to extend French-language schooling to francophone non-citizens living in British Columbia. There are 59 regional English language school boards in the province and [[Conseil scolaire francophone de la Colombie-Britannique|one province-wide francophone board]]. There is one French language college ([[Educacentre College]]), no French-language universities but some French-medium instruction at [[Simon Fraser University]].

Outside of education, there is no legal framework for minority language services by the civil service or the courts.&lt;ref&gt;Vallincourt et al., 9&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Newfoundland and Labrador ===
{{see also|Franco-Newfoundlander}}
Many Aboriginal and European languages were once widely spoken in Newfoundland and Labrador. However, Britain eventually gained firm and unchallenged control of the island and adjacent coast following the French defeat in the [[Seven Years' War]], and English then became the language of administration and commerce, as in most of the [[British Empire]]. In isolated fishing villages many minority languages persisted in private use, however, until the coming of standardized education in the 19th, and more so the 20th centuries. When Newfoundland joined Confederation in 1949 it had already used English as the sole language of government for several centuries. Today, Newfoundland is the most linguistically homogeneous province in Canada. In 1999, 98% of the population spoke only English as their sole mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/society/language.html |title=Language: Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage |publisher=Heritage.nf.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Newfoundland and Labrador]] has no statutory language policy, simply having inherited English from colonial times. The [[Newfoundland (island)|island of Newfoundland]] was once the homeland of the [[Beothuk]] language, and also seen some [[Mi'kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]] speakers. The [[Labrador]] coast is home to the [[Innu-aimun]] and [[Inuttut]] languages. Newfoundland was also home to unique regional dialects of the [[Newfoundland French|French]] and [[Irish language in Newfoundland|Irish Gaelic]] languages, now extinct, as well as smaller groups of [[Old Norse]], [[Basque language|Basque]], Spanish, Portuguese, German, and [[Scottish Gaelic|Scots Gaelic]] speakers. Today the Government offers minimal French-language services through its French-language webisite,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exec.gov.nl.ca/frenchservices|title=Office of French Services - Bureau des services en français - Human Resource Secretariat|first=Service|last=NL|website=www.exec.gov.nl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; in all other respects, it is English-only, including in the legislature, the courts, the schools, and the civil service.

==Evaluation of provincial language policy==
In its January 2012 report on the costs and benefits of official bilingualism at the provincial level in Canada, the [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[think tank]], the [[Fraser Institute]], identified several potential methods for classifying the provinces based on language circumstances and policies (territories were not included).

First it stated that linguistic minorities were only of a significant size in three provinces, either in absolute numbers (Quebec [575,000] and Ontario [489,000]) or as a proportion (New Brunswick [just over 30%]), while in the other seven provinces minority communities are quite small, as low as 1.3% in British Columbia&lt;ref&gt;Vaillancourt, et al., v&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the report suggested that in six of the provinces, governments only offer those minority-language services they are obliged to under Section 23 of the ''Charter'' (i.e. education). In three provinces (Manitoba, New Brunswick, and Quebec) there are other constitutional rights that come into play, over and above Section 23. In Ontario, there is a developed policy of statutory (not constitutional) minority language rights.&lt;ref&gt;Vaillancourt, et al., vi&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caucasus-ethnic en.svg|thumb|upright=1.59|Ethnolinguistic groups in the Caucasus region]]

The [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] languages are a large and extremely varied array of languages spoken by more than ten million people in and around the [[Caucasus Mountains]], which lie between the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Caspian Sea]].

[[Comparative method (linguistics)|Linguistic comparison]] allows these languages to be classified into several [[language families]], with little or no discernible affinity to each other. However, the languages of the Caucasus are sometimes mistakenly referred to as a ''family'' of languages.

== Families indigenous to the Caucasus ==
Three of these families have no current members outside the Caucasus, and are considered indigenous to the area. The term '''Caucasian languages''' is generally restricted to these families, which are spoken by about 11.2 million people.

* '''[[Kartvelian languages|Kartvelian]]''' language family with a total of about 5.2 million speakers. Includes [[Georgian language|Georgian]], the official language of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], with four million speakers, [[Svan language|Svan]], [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]] and [[Laz language|Laz]].
* '''[[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]]''', also called the '''Nakho-Dagestanian''' or '''Caspian''' family, with a total of about 3.8 million speakers.  Includes the [[Chechen language]] with 1.5 million speakers, the [[Avar language]] with 1 million  speakers, the [[Ingush language]] with 500,000 speakers, the [[Lezgian language]] with 800,000 speakers, and others.
* '''[[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]]''', also called the '''Abkhazo-Adyghean''' or '''Pontic''' family, with a total of about 2.5 million speakers. Includes the [[Kabardian language]], with one million speakers.

It is commonly believed that all Caucasian languages have a large number of [[consonant]]s. While this is certainly true for most members of the Northeast and Northwest Caucasian families (inventories range up to the 80–84 consonants of [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]]), the consonant inventories of the South Caucasian languages are not nearly as extensive, ranging from 28 (Georgian) to 30 ([[Laz language|Laz]]) – comparable to languages like [[Russian phonology|Russian]] (up to 37 consonant [[Phoneme|phonemes]], depending on definition), [[Arabic phonology|Arabic]] (28 phonemes), and Western European languages (often more than 20 phonemes).

The autochthonous languages of the Caucasus share some [[areal feature]]s, such as the presence of [[ejective consonant]]s and a highly [[agglutinative]] structure, and, with the sole exception of [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]], all of them exhibit a greater or lesser degree of [[ergativity]]. Many of these features are shared with other languages that have been in the Caucasus for a long time, such as [[Ossetian language|Ossetian]] (which has ejective sounds but no ergativity).

===External relations===
Since the birth of comparative linguistics in the 19th century, the riddle of the apparently isolated Caucasian language families has attracted the attention of many scholars, who have endeavored to relate them to each other or to languages outside the Caucasus region. The most promising proposals are connections between the Northeast and Northwest Caucasian families and each other or with languages formerly spoken in [[Anatolia]] and northern [[Mesopotamia]].

====North Caucasian languages====
{{main|North Caucasian languages}}
Linguists such as [[Sergei Starostin]] see the Northeast (Nakh-Dagestanian) and Northwest (Abkhaz–Adyghe) families as related and propose uniting them in a single '''North Caucasian''' family, sometimes called '''Caucasic''' or simply '''Caucasian'''. This theory excludes the South Caucasian languages, thereby proposing two indigenous language families. While these two families share many similarities, their morphological structure, with many [[morpheme]]s consisting of a single consonant, make comparison between them unusually difficult, and it has not been possible to establish a genetic relationship with any certainty.

====Ibero-Caucasian languages====
{{main|Ibero-Caucasian languages}}
There are no known affinities between the South Caucasian and North Caucasian families. Nevertheless, some scholars have proposed the single name '''Ibero-Caucasian''' for all the Caucasian language families, North and South, in an attempt to unify the Caucasian languages under one family.

====Hattic====
Some linguists have claimed affinities between the Northwest Caucasian (Circassian) family and the extinct [[Hattic language]] of central Anatolia. See the article on [[Northwest Caucasian languages]] for details.

====Alarodian====
{{Main|Alarodian languages}}
Alarodian is a proposed connection between Northeast Caucasian and the extinct [[Hurro-Urartian languages]] of [[Anatolia]].

====Dené–Caucasian macrofamily====
{{Main|Dené–Caucasian languages}}
Linguists such as [[Sergei Starostin]] have proposed a [[Dené–Caucasian languages|Dené–Caucasian]] [[macrofamily]], which includes the North Caucasian languages together with [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]], [[Na-Dené languages|Na-Dené]], [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]], and [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]]. This proposal is rejected by most linguists.

==Families with wider distribution==
Other languages historically and currently spoken in the Caucasus area can be placed into families with a much wider geographical distribution.

===Indo-European===
The predominant [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language in the Caucasus is [[Armenian language|Armenian]], spoken by the [[Armenians]] (circa 11 million speakers). The Ossetians, speaking the [[Ossetian language]], form another group of around 700,000 speakers. Other Indo-European languages spoken in the Caucasus include [[Greek language|Greek]] ([[Pontic Greek]]), [[Persian language|Persian]] (including [[Tat language (Caucasus)|Tat Persian]]), [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Talysh language|Talysh]], [[Judeo-Tat language|Judeo-Tat]], and the [[Slavic languages]], such as [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], whose speakers number over a third of the total population of the Caucasus.

===Semitic (Afro-Asiatic)===
Two dialects of [[Neo-Aramaic languages|Neo-Aramaic]] are spoken in the Caucasus: [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]], with around 30,000 speakers, and [[Bohtan Neo-Aramaic]], with around 1,000 speakers. Both of these were brought to the Caucasus by ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] fleeing [[Assyrian Genocide]] during [[World War One]].

A dialect of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] known as [[Shirvani Arabic]] was spoken natively in parts of [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Dagestan]] throughout medieval times until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=WDG&gt;{{cite book|last=Owens|first=Jonathan|title=Arabic As a Minority Language|year=2000|publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]|isbn=9783110165784|pages=89–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CHC&gt;{{cite book|last=Zelkina|first=Anna|title=In Quest for God and Freedom: The Sufi Response to the Russian Advance in the North Caucasus|year=2000|publisher=[[C. Hurst &amp; Co.]]|isbn=9781850653844|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the nineteenth century, it was considered that the best [[Modern Standard Arabic|literary Arabic]] was spoken in the mountains of [[Dagestan]].&lt;ref name=CHC2&gt;{{cite book|last=Bryan|first=Fanny. E.B.|editor-last=Bennigsen-Broxup|editor-first=Marie|editor-link=Marie Bennigsen-Broxup|title=The North Caucasus Barrier: The Russian Advance Towards the Muslim World|year=1992|publisher=[[C. Hurst &amp; Co.]]|isbn=9781850653059|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkic===
Several [[Turkic languages]] are spoken in the Caucasus. Of these, [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] is predominant, with around 9 million speakers in Azerbaijan and more than 10 million in North Western Iran. Other Turkic languages spoken include [[Karachay-Balkar language|Karachay-Balkar]], [[Kumyk language|Kumyk]], [[Nogai language|Nogai]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]].

===Mongolic===
The [[Kalmyk language]], spoken by descendants of [[Oirat language|Oirat]]-speakers from East Asia, is a [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24250">This article is an outline of the '''grammar of [[Lingua Franca Nova]]''' (a.k.a. LFN,  Elefen), a proposed international auxiliary language originally created by C. George Boeree and elaborated by the members of the LFN community. LFN has an analytic grammar and resembles the grammars of languages such as the [[Haitian Creole]], [[Papiamento]], and [[Afrikaans]]. On the other hand, it uses a vocabulary drawn from several modern romance languages – [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[French language|French]], and [[Italian language|Italian]].&lt;ref name="Invented Languages"&gt;Harrison, Richard H. (2008) ''Lingua Franca Nova.'' '''Invented Languages, 1,''' pp.&amp;nbsp;30 –33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fisahn, Stefan (2005) ''Plansprache: Lingua Franca Nova.'' '''Contraste''', '''244''', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Complete grammars are available in English, French, Esperanto, and LFN.&lt;ref name="LFN grammar"&gt;[http://ccgi.esperanto.plus.com/lfn/grammar.pdf LFN Grammar]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Word order==

LFN has a strict [[word order]].&lt;ref name="Invented Languages" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LFN grammar" /&gt; The general word order is:

:''subject noun phrase'' — ''verb phrase'' (— ''object noun phrase'')
::''Joan core'' — "John runs"
::''Maria oia Joan'' — "Maria hears John"

A [[noun phrase]] has this order:

: (''determiners'' —) (''quantifiers'' —) ''noun'' (— ''adjectives'')
::''La tre omes grande...'' — "The three large men..."
::''La multe femes peti...'' — "The many small women..."

A [[verb phrase]] has this order:

: (''tense/mood'' —) (''leading verb'' —) ''verb'' (— ''adverb'')
::''...ia nesesa come rapida'' — "...needed to eat quickly..."
::''...va debe come lente'' — "...will have to eat slowly..."

A [[Adpositional phrase|prepositional phrase]] generally follows what it modifies, and has this order:

: ''preposition'' — ''noun phrase''
::''...en la cosina'' — "...in the kitchen"
::''...pos medianote'' — "...after midnight"

==Nouns==

The roles of [[nouns]] in a sentence are indicated through prepositions and word order. There are no [[Grammatical case|cases]].&lt;ref name="Invented Languages" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LFN grammar" /&gt;

Nouns are commonly preceded by [[determiner]]s. [[Plural]] nouns are formed by appending '''''-s''''' to nouns ending in vowels or '''''-es''''' to nouns ending in consonants. This does not alter the stress:
*''casa &gt; casa'''s''''' — house &gt; houses
*''fem &gt; fem'''es''''' — woman &gt; women

[[Mass noun]]s include liquids, powders, and substances, such as ''acua'' (water), ''arena'' (sand), and ''lenio'' (wood). They do not normally require determiners or the plural. However, one may add these to indicate specific examples or different types:
*''la acua'' — the water (e.g. in the cup)
*''lenios'' — woods (e.g. various kinds)

[[Grammatical gender|Gender]] is typically not indicated. If necessary, nouns may be followed by '''''mas''''' (male) or '''''fema''''' (female):
*''un cavalo '''mas''''' /  ''un cavalo '''fema''''' — a stallion / a mare

A few terms for family members and traditional roles do show distinctions of gender. For example:
*''madre / padre'' — mother / father
*''fi'''o''' / fi'''a''''' — son / daughter
*''prinse / prins'''esa''''' — prince / princess

[[Apposition]] — the use of one noun to modify another — is mostly limited to names and titles:
*''san Josef'' — Saint Joseph
*''mea sore Maria'' — my sister Mary

== Determiners ==

[[Determiner (linguistics)|Determiners]] in LFN precede the noun they modify. There are two [[Article (grammar)|articles]]: '''''la''''' (the) and '''''un''''' (a), used as in English:&lt;ref name="Invented Languages" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LFN grammar" /&gt;
* '''''la''' om, '''un''' fem, e enfantes'' — the man, a woman, and children

Other words function similarly:
:{| style="width: 90%"
|-
| style="width: 45%" | '''''tota''''' — all&lt;br&gt; '''''esta''''' — this, these&lt;br&gt; '''''acel''''' — that, those&lt;br&gt; '''''cada''''' — every, each&lt;br&gt; '''''cualce''''' — whatever, whichever &lt;br&gt; '''''alga''''' — some, several, a few &lt;br&gt;'''''no''''' — no, zero || '''''multe''''' — many, much&lt;br&gt; '''''poca''''' — few, little&lt;br&gt; '''''plu''''' — more&lt;br&gt; '''''min''''' — less, fewer&lt;br&gt; '''''otra''''' — other&lt;br&gt; '''''mesma''''' — same&lt;br&gt; '''''tal''''' — such
|}

In addition, numbers and possessive determiners (see below) are also used.

==Pronouns==

Personal [[pronoun]]s are invariant:&lt;ref name="Invented Languages" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LFN grammar" /&gt;
:{| style="width: 90%"
|-
| style="width: 45%" | '''''me''''' — I, me &lt;br&gt; '''''tu''''' — you (singular) &lt;br&gt; '''''el''''' — she, her, he, him &lt;br&gt; '''''lo''''' — it || '''''nos''''' — we, us &lt;br&gt; '''''vos''''' — you (plural) &lt;br&gt; '''''los''''' — they, them &lt;br&gt; '''''on''''' – one
|}

'''''El''''' is used for people and higher animals. Its use can be extended metaphorically to lower animals, robots, the moon, hurricanes, etc. '''''Lo''''' is used for things, simple animals, plants, ideas, etc. The exact dividing line is left to the speaker.

There is an indefinite pronoun '''''on''''', which is used like German "man" or French "on":
* '''''On''' debe segue la regulas'' — "One must follow the rules."

There are no [[grammatical gender|gender]] distinctions between "he" and "she".  If gender is significant, one can use words like '''''la fem, la om, la fia, la fio, la fema, la mas''''' (the woman, the man, the daughter, the son, the female, the male), etc, or gender-irrelevant terms such as '''''la plu grande''''', '''''la carnor''''', or '''''la otra''''' (the bigger one, the butcher, the other one).

Unlike in the Romance languages, there is no polite/impolite contrast for the second person: '''''tu''''' is always used for the singular, '''''vos''''' always for the plural.

The reflexive pronouns are also '''''me, nos, tu,''''' and '''''vos'''''. For the third person, singular and plural, lfn uses '''''se''''':
* ''Me ia lava '''me''''' — "I washed myself."
* ''El ama '''se''''' — "He loves himself," "She loves herself."
 
The [[possessive]] determiners are '''''mea, nosa, tua,''''' and '''''vosa'''''.  '''''Sua''''' is used for all third persons:
* '''''Tua''' gato es ala'' — "Your cat is over there."
*''Tu es sempre en '''mea''' mente'' — "You are always in my mind."

For the possessive pronouns, LFN uses the possessive determiners, preceded by '''''la''''':
* '''''La mea''' es plu grande ca '''la tua''''' — "Mine is bigger than yours."

Other pronouns include the following:
:{| style="width: 90%"
|-
| style="width: 45%" | '''''cadun''''' — everyone, everybody &lt;br&gt; '''''algun''''' — someone, somebody &lt;br&gt; '''''cualcun''''' — anyone, anybody &lt;br&gt; '''''nun''''' — no one, nobody &lt;br&gt; '''''esta''''' — this, these &lt;br&gt; '''''multe''''' — much
| '''''cada cosa''''' — everything &lt;br&gt; '''''alga cosa''''' — something  &lt;br&gt; '''''cualce cosa''''' — whatever, anything &lt;br&gt; '''''no cosa''''' — nothing &lt;br&gt; '''''acel''''' — that &lt;br&gt; '''''poca''''' — little

==Verbs==

There are no [[grammatical conjugation|conjugations]] of [[verb]]s in LFN. The basic form remains the same regardless of person, number, or tense.&lt;ref name="Invented Languages" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LFN grammar" /&gt;

The [[present tense]] is represented by the basic verb: 
*''La om '''come''''' — "The man eats", "The man is eating."

The present tense is also used to indicate habitual actions and states, facts of nature, and as a "historical" tense, such as when relating a story that has been clearly established as occurring in the past:
*''La sol '''leva''' en la este'' — "The sun rises in the east."
*''Me '''labora''' a la universia'' — "I work at the university."

The [[past tense]] is indicated by the particle '''''ia''''': 
*''Maria '''ia''' come'' — "Maria ate."

The [[future tense]] is indicated by the particle '''''va''''': 
*''Joan '''va''' come pronto'' — "John will eat soon."

The particle '''''ta'''''  indicates the [[irrealis mood]] and can be used where other languages might use a [[Conditional mood|conditional]] or [[subjunctive]] mood. Its use is optional:
*''Me ia duta ce el '''ta''' vade'' — "I doubted he would go."
*''Me '''ta''' es felis si la sol '''ta''' brilia'' — "I would be happy if the sun were shining."

One combination ― '''''ia ta''''' ― is used to express "would have":
*''Me '''ia ta''' es un bon re'' ― "I would have been a good king."

Certain [[adverbs]] and verbal constructions add precision to the tenses:
* ''Me come '''aora''''' ― "I am eating now."
*''Me ia come '''ja''''' ― "I ate already", "I have eaten", "I had eaten."
* ''Me va come '''a pos''''' ― "I will eat afterwards."
* ''Me ia '''fini''' leje la libro'' ― "I (have) finished reading the book."
* '''''Doman''', me va '''comensa''' leje un otra'' ― "Tomorrow, I will begin to read another."

[[Negation (linguistics)|Negation]] is indicated by putting '''''no''''' before the tense particle or (in the present tense) the verb. Double negatives should be avoided:
*''El '''no''' ia pensa ce algun ia es asi'' ― "He didn't think anyone was here."

[[Imperative mood|Commands]] are indicated by dropping the subject pronoun. [[Hortative]] sentences include the subject, but are preceded by '''''ta ce''''':
* ''Boli la acua!'' ― "Boil the water!"
* '''''Ta ce''' nos dansa!'' ― "Let's dance!" "Shall we dance?"

'''''Lo''''' and '''''on''''' are used as [[dummy pronoun]]s before verbs that refer to weather or other general situations:
* ''Lo va pluve'' ― "It's going to rain."
* ''Lo es tro calda en esta sala'' ― "It is too hot in this room." (Or ''Esta sala es tro calda'')
* ''Lo pare ce tu es coreta'' ― "It seems that you are correct."
* ''On no ave pexes en esta lago'' ― "There aren't fish in this lake." (Or ''No pexes es en esta lago'')

A verb that is fundamentally [[intransitive verb|intransitive]] may be used as a transitive [[Causative|causal verb]] by moving the original subject to the object position, and adding a new subject:
* ''La acua ia boli'' ― "The water boiled" &gt; ''Me ia boli la acua'' - "I boiled the water."
* ''La porte ia abri'' ― "The door opened" &gt; ''Me ia abri la porte'' ― "I opened the door."

Verbs can be made into adjectives: The [[participle|active participle]] is formed by adding '''''-nte''''' to the verb. For example, ''come'' becomes ''come'''nte''''', meaning "eating".  This should never be used as a gerund, as it often is in English (e.g. "I love eating").

One can emphasize the idea that the subject is in the midst of an activity or process ([[Continuous and progressive aspects|the progressive aspect]]) using the active participle. Or one can use expressions such as ''en la media de'':
*''Nos ia '''es comente''' cuando la tempesta ia comensa'' ― "We were eating when the storm began."
*''Nos ia es '''en la media de come''' cuando la tempesta ia comensa'' ― "We were in the middle of eating when the storm began."

The [[participle|passive participle]] is formed by adding '''''-da''''' to the verb. For example, ''come'' becomes ''come'''da''''', meaning "eaten". This should not be confused with the past tense.

The passive participle can be used to express the [[grammatical voice|passive voice]]. Or one can usa a generic subject pronoun instead:
*''Si tu no asconde la torta, '''lo va es comeda''''' ― "If you don't hide the cake, it will be eaten."
*''Si tu no asconde la torta, '''algun va come lo''''' ― "If you don't hide the cake, someone will eat it."

Verbs can be used as nouns without change by adding '''''la''''' or other determiner. Without a determiner, the word serves as an [[infinitive]] or [[gerund]]:
*''La samba es '''un''' dansa.'' ― "The samba is a dance."
*''Do es '''la''' dansa?'' ― "Where is the dance?"
*''Los gusta dansa.'' ― "They like to dance," "They like dancing."

In LFN, verbs often come in pairs. Some "leading" verbs are like [[modal verbs]] in English. However, the idea of leading verbs goes beyond modals to include "attitudinal" verbs such as '''''finje''''' (pretend) and '''''pare''''' (seem). There is no equivalent to the word "to," and the "following" verb is left in its simplest form: 
*''Me va '''atenta vola''' doman.'' ― "I will try to fly tomorrow."
*''On '''debe brosi''' la dentes a cada dia.'' ― "One should brush one's teeth every day."

[[Predicative expression|Subject  complements]] are introduced by '''''es''''' and words such as '''''pare''''' (seem) and '''''deveni''''' (become):
*''la fem ia '''es bela'''''. — "The woman was beautiful."
*''Me va '''deveni un psicolojiste''''' — "I will become a psychologist."

[[Predicative expression|Object complements]] are introduced by the preposition '''''a''''':
*''Me ia pinta la casa '''a roja'''''. — "I painted the house red."
* ''Los ia eleje el '''a presidente'''''. — "They elected him president."

==Adjectives==

[[Adjective]]s follow the noun they modify, with two exceptions:  '''''Bon''''' (good) and '''''mal''''' (bad) may come before the noun, due to their frequent use.  Unlike the natural Romance languages, adjectives in LFN do not have gender or plural forms, i.e. they don't "agree" with the nouns they describe.&lt;ref name="Invented Languages" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LFN grammar" /&gt;

The [[comparative]] is made with '''''plu''''' (more) or '''''min''''' (less).  "The most" is '''''la plu''''' and "the least" is '''''la min:'''''
*''Jan es '''plu''' bon '''ca''' Jo, ma Jil es '''la plu''' bon.'' ― "Jan is better than Jo, but Jill is the best."

Equivalence is indicated with '''''tan... como''''':
*''Marco es '''tan''' grande '''como''' Mona.'' ― "Mark is as big as Mona."

Like verbs, adjectives can be used as nouns. For example, ''bela'' means "beautiful", but ''un bela'' means "a beautiful one" or "a beauty." This works with participles, too:  ''la studiante'' and ''la studiada'' mean "the student" and "the studied," respectively, from the verb ''studia,'' "study."

An adjective can be made into an [[abstract noun]] by adding '''''-ia''''' (-ity, -ness, -ship, -hood).  In this way ''bela'' becomes ''bel'''ia''','' meaning beauty.  This can also be used with nouns:  ''madre'' (mother) becomes ''madr'''ia''''' (motherhood).

==Adverbs==

LFN doesn't have an explicit way of marking [[adverb]]s.&lt;ref name="Invented Languages" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LFN grammar" /&gt; Instead, any adjective can be used as an adverb by placing it after a verb or at the very beginning of the sentence. ''Un om felis'' for example means "a happy man", whereas ''el dansa felis'' means "he/she dances happily". Adverbs used to modify adjectives ''precede'' the adjective. Dedicated adverbs, such as ''aora'' and ''oji'' can fall anywhere, as long as they don't cause confusion.

Examples of common adverbs include the following:
:{| style="width: 90%"
|-
| style="width: 45%" | '''''aora''''' ― now &lt;br&gt;'''''alora''''' ― then &lt;br&gt;'''''ancora''''' ― still, yet&lt;br&gt;'''''ja''''' ― already &lt;br&gt;'''''sempre''''' ― always &lt;br&gt;'''''nunca''''' ― never &lt;br&gt;'''''cuasi''''' – almost&lt;br&gt;'''''an''''' ― even || '''''ier''''' ― yesterday &lt;br&gt;'''''oji''''' ― today &lt;br&gt;'''''doman''''' ― tomorrow &lt;br&gt;'''''asi''''' ― here &lt;br&gt;'''''ala''''' ― there &lt;br&gt;'''''tro''''' ― too&lt;br&gt;'''''apena''''' ― barely, scarcely&lt;br&gt;'''''cisa''''' – maybe
|}

==Prepositions==

[[Preposition]]s are placed before the noun or noun phrase, and the [[Adpositional phrase|prepositional phrase]] is placed after the noun being modified, or, if used adverbially, at the beginning of the sentence or after the verb.&lt;ref name="Invented Languages" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LFN grammar" /&gt;  There are 22 basic prepositions in LFN:
:{| style="width: 90%"
|-
| style="width: 45%" | '''''a''''' ― at, to &lt;br&gt;'''''ante''''' ― before, in front of &lt;br&gt;'''''asta''''' ― until &lt;br&gt;'''''ca''''' ― than &lt;br&gt;'''''como''''' ― like &lt;br&gt;'''''con''''' ― with &lt;br&gt;'''''contra''''' ― against &lt;br&gt;'''''de''''' ― of, from, since &lt;br&gt;'''''en''''' ― in, into, during &lt;br&gt;'''''entre''''' ― between, among &lt;br&gt;'''''estra''''' ― out of, except || '''''longo''''' ― along &lt;br&gt;'''''par''''' ― by &lt;br&gt;'''''per''''' ― for, in order to &lt;br&gt;'''''pos''''' ― after, behind, according to &lt;br&gt;'''''sin''''' ― without &lt;br&gt;'''''sirca''''' ― around, approximately &lt;br&gt;'''''su''''' ― below, under, beneath &lt;br&gt;'''''supra''''' ― above, over &lt;br&gt;'''''sur''''' ― on, about, concerning &lt;br&gt;'''''tra''''' ― through &lt;br&gt;'''''ultra''''' ― beyond, past, across
|}

Some prepositions can be used as adverbs by placing '''''a''''' or '''''de''''' before them.
*'''''a su''''' ― down, below, downstairs
*'''''a pos''''' ― after, afterwards, behind, out back
*'''''de supra''''' – from above

==Coordinating conjunctions==

There are three [[Grammatical conjunction|coordinating conjunctions]] in LFN and three correlative conjunctions:&lt;ref name="Invented Languages" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LFN grammar" /&gt;
:{| style="width: 90%"
|-
| style="width: 45%" | '''''e''''' ― and&lt;br&gt; '''''o''''' ― or &lt;br&gt; '''''ma''''' ― but, yet || '''''e ... e ...''''' ― both ... and ...&lt;br&gt;'''''o ... o ...''''' ― either ... or ...&lt;br&gt;'''''no ... (e) no ...''''' ― neither ... nor ...
|
|}

==Questions==

There are a number of [[interrogative word]]s that are used to introduce [[question]]s:&lt;ref name="Invented Languages" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LFN grammar" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christo Moskovsky &amp; Alan Libert (2006) Questions in Natural and Artificial Languages. '''Journal of Universal Language 7''', pp 65-120 http://www.unish.org/upload/word/7-2-03-QuestionsInNat%26ALs2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
:{| style="width: 90%"
|-
| style="width: 45%" |'''''cual''''' ― what, which &lt;br&gt;'''''ci''''' ― who, whom &lt;br&gt;'''''de ci''''' ― whose, of whom &lt;br&gt;'''''cuando''''' ― when || '''''do''''' ― where &lt;br&gt;'''''como''''' ― how &lt;br&gt; '''''cuanto''''' ― how much, how many &lt;br&gt; '''''perce''''' ― why
|}

(Most of these are also used to introduce [[subordinate clause]]s, discussed below.)

For example:
* '''''Cuanto''' on paia per lete asi?'' ― "How much does one pay for milk here?"
* '''''Cual''' auto tu gusta la plu?'' ― "Which car do you like the best?"
* '''''Perce''' tu no gusta esta?'' ― "Why don't you like this one?"
* '''''Cuando''' tu espeta ce el ariva?'' ― "When do you expect him to arrive?"

Questions may include one of these words or may be indicated by rising intonation alone. One may also express questions by beginning the sentence with the interrogative particle '''''esce''''' ("is it that... ?") or by adding '''''no''''' (no) or '''''si''''' (yes) to the end of the sentence. In writing, questions always end with a question mark (?):

* '''''Como''' on construi un casa per avias?'' ― "How do you make a bird house?"
* ''Tu vole dansa?'' ― "Do you want to dance?"
* '''''Esce''' tu parla Deutx?'' ― "Do you speak German?"
* ''Tu parla Italian, '''no'''?'' ― "You speak Italian, don't you?"

==Clauses==

[[Relative clauses]] (or adjective clauses) function like adjectives. There are two [[relative pronouns]] which typically introduce relative clauses:&lt;ref name="LFN grammar" /&gt;

: '''''cual''''' ― which, that	
: '''''ci''''' ― who, whom

Relative clauses follow the noun or noun phrase that they modify:

* ''La fem '''ci''' me ama veni de Frans.'' ― "The woman (whom) I love comes from France."
* ''La robot '''cual''' me ia construi no opera.'' ― "The robot (that) I built doesn't work."
* ''Me no comprende lo '''cual''' tu intende.'' ― "I don't understand what you mean."

Relative pronouns may be preceded by prepositions:
* ''La cosa '''per cual''' me espera la plu es un bisicle nova.'' ― "The thing I wish for the most is a new bicycle."
* ''La fem '''de ci''' nos parla labora a la me ofisia.'' ― "The woman of whom we speak works at my office."

'''''Cuando''''' and '''''do''''' can also be used to introduce relative clauses:

* ''Esta es la site '''do''' me vole abita.'' ― "This is the city where I want to live."
* ''Me ia vade ala en la anio '''cuando''' me ia fini mea studias.'' ― "I went there in the year when I finished my studies."

[[Dependent clause#Noun_clause|Noun clauses]] function the same way that nouns and noun phrases do in a sentence.&lt;ref name="LFN grammar" /&gt; Two [[subordinating conjunctions]] commonly introduce noun clauses:

: '''''ce''''' ― that
: '''''esce''''' ― whether

For example:

* ''Me pensa '''ce''' el es bela.'' ― "I think that she is beautiful."
* ''La gato entra la sala '''sin ce''' algun vide el.'' ― "The cat entered the room without anyone seeing it."
* ''Me demanda a me '''esce''' el ama me.'' ― "I wonder whether she loves me."

Relative pronouns and interrogative words can also introduce noun clauses:

* ''Me no pote recorda '''ci''' me es.'' ― "I can't remember who I am."
* ''Me gusta '''como''' el parla.'' ― "I like how he talks."
* ''Me no sabe '''cuando''' me va parti.'' ― I don't know when I will leave."
*''Me sabe '''cual''' tu desira per natal'' ― "I know what you want for Christmas."

[[Dependent clause#Adverbial_clause|Adverbial clauses]] function like adverbs, modifying the verb or the sentence as a whole. Some are introduced by these subordinating conjunctions:&lt;ref name="LFN grammar" /&gt;

: '''''si''''' ― if
: '''''afin''''' ― so that, in order that
: '''''car''''' ― because

Adverbial clauses usually follow the main clause:

* ''Me ta pote vade '''si''' me ta ave un auto.'' ― "I would be able to go if I had a car."
* ''Me no teme la can '''car''' el es multe peti.'' ― "I am not afraid of the dog because it is very small."
* ''Me core '''afin''' la rinoseros no catura me.'' ― "I'm running so that the rhinos don't catch me."

Some of the interrogative words can also be used to introduce adverbial clauses:

* ''La lupos cria '''cuando''' los vide la luna'' ― "The wolves howl when they see the moon."
* ''Me vole abita '''do''' la clima es bon'' ― "I want to live where the weather is good."
* ''Me vive '''como''' me vole vive.'' ― "I live as I want to live."

'''''Do''''' and '''''cuando''''' are often preceded by prepositions:

:{| style="width: 90%"
|-
| style="width: 45%" |  '''''a do''''' ― to where, whither &lt;br&gt; '''''de do''''' ― from where, whence &lt;br&gt; '''''de cuando''''' ― since &lt;br&gt; || '''''pos cuando''''' ― after  &lt;br&gt; '''''en cuando''''' ― while  &lt;br&gt;  '''''asta cuando''''' ― until   
|}

For example:

* ''El ia pote sci '''ante cuando''' el ia pote pasea.'' ― "He could ski before he could walk."
* ''Me gusta escuta a la radio '''en cuando''' me labora.'' ― "I like to listen to the radio while I work."

==Numbers==

Numbers in LFN are as follows:&lt;ref name="LFN grammar" /&gt;
:{| style="width: 90%"
|-
| style="width: 45%" | 0 ― '''''zero'''''&lt;br&gt;1 ― '''''un'''''&lt;br&gt; 2 ― '''''du'''''&lt;br&gt; 3 ― '''''tre'''''&lt;br&gt; 4 ― '''''cuatro'''''&lt;br&gt; 5 ― '''''sinco''''' || 6 ― '''''ses'''''&lt;br&gt; 7 ― '''''sete'''''&lt;br&gt; 8 ― '''''oto'''''&lt;br&gt; 9 ― '''''nove'''''&lt;br&gt; 10 ― '''''des'''''
|}

Higher numbers are constructed as follows:
:{| style="width: 90%"
|-
| style="width: 45%" |  11 ― '''''des-un'''''&lt;br&gt;  20 ― '''''dudes'''''&lt;br&gt;  100 ― '''''sento'''''&lt;br&gt;   321 ― '''''tresento-dudes-un'''''|| 1000 ― '''''mil'''''&lt;br&gt;  45 678 ― '''''cuatrodes-sinco mil sessento-setedes-oto'''''&lt;br&gt;  1 000 000 ― '''''milion'''''&lt;br&gt;  1 000 000 000 ― '''''mil milion'''''
|}

Numbers that express quantity precede the noun; numbers that express order follow the noun:
*''la '''tre''' omes,'' "the three men"
*''la om '''tre''','' "the third man"

Fractions are constructed with '''''-i,''''' e.g. '''''dui, tri, cuatri,... desi, senti, mili,''''' etc. These are also used as verbs meaning "to halve", "to divide into three parts", etc.

Multiples and groups can be referred to with '''''-uple,''''' as in '''''duple''''' ― "double, duo, couple, pair". Add '''''-i''''' to make a verb, such as '''''dupli''''' - "to double".

'''Low Dietsch''' ({{lang-nl|Platdiets}}, {{lang-li|Platduutsj}}, {{lang-fr|francique rhéno-mosan}} or {{lang|fr|platdutch}}) refers to a handful of transitional [[Limburgish]]–[[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian]] dialects spoken in a number of towns and villages (e.g., Gemmenich, [[Hombourg, Belgium|Hombourg]], Montzen, [[Welkenraedt]]).

This area, located in the Belgian ([[Wallonia|Walloon]]) "tri-state area" from [[Voeren]] (Fourons), to [[Plombières]] ([[Bleiberg]]), to [[Eupen]], is called the Low Dietsch zone ({{lang-nl|Platdietse streek}}). Classified by German dialectologists as [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian Franconian]] and by Dutch-language dialectologists as [[Southeast Limburgish]], Low Dietsch is more precisely a transitional dialect between both. Low Dietsch is one of several [[Meuse-Rhenish]] varieties that make the north-western part of the [[dialect continuum]] known as the [[Rhenish fan]]. As the southernmost dialect of Limburgish, the Low-Dietsch speech area corresponds to the core of the old [[Duchy of Limburg]].

==French usage==

In French, the term {{lang|fr|francique carolingien}} ("Carolingian Franconian") is also used,&lt;ref name="Le Soir"&gt;[http://www.lesoir.be/regions/liege/culture-pour-sauver-la-langue-2007-08-07-543405.shtml Obelit au secours du patois], ''[[Le Soir]]''&lt;/ref&gt; because it is thought to be the language of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty and court, although that would be an [[anachronism]]. Low Dietsch is thought to have been spoken from [[Tongeren]] to [[Cologne]], which would presumably make it the likeliest candidate for [[Charlemagne]]'s native language.&lt;ref name="Le Soir"/&gt; However, this expression is controversial since there is no way to prove that hypothesis. Nor is it possible that the current dialectal map was the same 1,500 years ago. Of those early documents that have survived, one, the [[Oaths of Strasbourg|Strasbourg Oaths]] (AD 842), is in [[Rhine Franconian]], and the other, the ''Wachtendonck Psalms'' (10th century), is in a form of southern Limburgish (with a few [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian Franconian]] traits).

In 1963 the Low Dietsch zone was incorporated to [[Wallonia]], and since 1992 the dialect has been recognized as a "regional language" by the Walloon authority, affording it certain rights and protections. It is not, however, related to Walloon, but French is the language of officialdom in the area. It forms the northwestern border of [[Ripuarian language|Ripuarian Franconian]] and the southeastern portion of the [[Meuse-Rhenish]] area.

==Southeast Limburgish==
'''[[Southeast Limburgish]]''' ({{lang-nl|Zuidoost-Limburgs}}), as spoken around [[Kerkrade]], [[Bocholtz]] and [[Vaals]] in the Netherlands, [[Aachen]] in Germany and [[Raeren]] and [[Eynatten]] in Belgium, also shows the gradual transition from Limburgish towards Ripuarian.  It is adjacent to the southeastern border of the Meuse-Rhenish language area, and is related to [[Southern Meuse-Rhenish]]. Limburgish straddles the borderline between Low Franconian and West Central German varieties. They are more-or-less mutually intelligible with the Ripuarian dialects, but show fewer [[High German consonant shift|'High German shifts']] (R. Hahn 2001).

Dialects belonging to the Ripuarian group almost always call themselves ''Platt'' like ''Öcher Platt'' (of Aachen) or ''Eischwiele Platt'' (of Eschweiler). The reason behind this is, that most of the far more than hundred Ripuarian dialects are bound to a village or municipality. Usually there are small distinctive differences between neighboring dialects, and increasingly bigger ones between the more distant ones. These are described by a set of [[isogloss]]es called the 'Rhenish fan' (''Rheinischer Fächer'' in linguistics). The way someone talks, even if he is not using Ripuarian, quite often makes it possible to trace him precisely to the village or city quarter where he learned to speak.

Currently, all varieties within a half circle some 15–20&amp;nbsp;km around Aachen, including two-thirds of Dutch South Limburg and also the Low Dietsch area between [[Voeren]] and [[Eupen]] in Belgium, can be considered a group of its own, which recently has been named '''Limburgish of the Three Countries''' ({{lang-nl|Drielandenlimburgs}}, {{lang-de|Dreiländerplatt}}), referring to the place where the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany meet (Frins 2005).{{fix|text=full citation needed|date=September 2017}} This variety still possesses interesting syntactic idiosyncrasies, probably dating from the period when the old Duchy of Limburg existed.

'''Monocropping''' is the [[agriculture|agricultural]] practice of growing a single crop year after year on the same land, in the absence of [[Crop rotation|rotation]] through other crops or growing multiple crops on the same land [[polyculture]]. [[Corn]], [[soybeans]], and [[wheat]] are three common crops often grown using monocropping techniques.

Monocropping allows for farmers to have consistent crops throughout their entire farm. They can use the same seed, pest control, machinery and growing method on their entire farm giving them a larger yield for a significantly lower cost.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} 

While economically a very efficient system, allowing for specialization in equipment and crop production, monocropping is also controversial, as it damages the soil ecology (including depletion or reduction in diversity of soil nutrients) and provide an unbuffered [[Ecological niche|niche]] for parasitic species, increasing crop vulnerability to opportunistic insects, plants, and microorganisms. The result is a more fragile ecosystem with an increased dependency on [[pesticide]]s and artificial [[fertilizer]]s.&lt;ref name="EcoWorld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoworld.com/Trees/ecoworld_trees_issues.cfm |title=EcoWorld - Trees Ecosystems |format= |work= |accessdate=2008-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522081011/http://www.ecoworld.com/trees/ecoworld_trees_issues.cfm |archivedate=May 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concentrated presence of a single cultivar, genetically adapted with a single resistance strategy, presents a situation in which an entire crop can be wiped out very quickly by a single opportunistic species. An example of this would be the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|potato famine]] of [[Ireland]] in 1845–1849, and according to Devlin Kuyek is the main cause of the current [[Food security#Risks to food security|food crisis]] with monoculture [[rice]] crops failing as the effects of [[climate change]] become more acute.&lt;ref name="Straight"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.straight.com/news/monocrops-bring-food-crisis |title=Monocrops bring food crisis - Straight.com |format= |work= |author=Alex Roslin |accessdate=2008-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monocropping as an agricultural strategy tends to emphasize the use of expensive specialized [[List of agricultural machinery|farm equipment]]—an important component in realizing its efficiency goals. This can lead to an increased dependency on [[fossil fuel]]s and reliance on expensive machinery that cannot be produced locally and may need to be financed. This can make a significant change in the economics of farming in regions that are accustomed to self-sufficiency in agricultural production. In addition, political complications may ensue when these dependencies extend across national boundaries.

The controversies surrounding monocropping are complex, but traditionally the core issues concern the balance between its advantages in increasing short-term food production—especially in [[Hunger|hunger-prone regions]]—and its disadvantages with respect to long-term land stewardship and the fostering of local [[Autarky|economic independence]] and [[Sustainable agriculture|ecological sustainability]]. Advocates of monocropping tend to claim that in its absence many human populations would be reduced to starvation or to a degraded level of civilization comparable to the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]. On the other hand, critics of monocropping dispute these claims and attribute them to corporate [[Advocacy group|special interest groups]], citing the damage that monocropping causes to societies and the environment.

==Effects of Monocropping==
A difficulty with monocropping is that the solution to one problem—whether  economic, environmental or political—may result in a cascade of other problems. For example, a well-known concern is pesticides and fertilizers seeping into surrounding soil and groundwater from extensive monocropped acreage in the U.S. and abroad. This issue, especially with respect to the pesticide [[DDT]], played an important role in focusing public attention on [[ecology]] and [[pollution]] issues during the 1960s when [[Rachel Carson]] published her landmark book ''[[Silent Spring]]''.

[[Land degradation|Soil depletion]] is also a negative effect of mono-cropping. [[Crop rotation]] plays an important role in replenishing soil nutrients, especially atmospheric nitrogen converted to usable forms by nitrogen-fixing plants used in fallow fields. In addition, it performs an important role in preventing pathogen and pest build-up. In a monocropping regime, farmers are less likely to rotate their crops and replenish such essential soil nutrients. In addition, artificial high-nitrogen fertilizers can "burn" the soil by creating an unfavorable environment for indigenous organisms, a phenomenon well-known to [[Organic farming|organic gardeners and farmers]] (who avoid it), resulting in further disruption of soil ecology and dependence on further short-term fertilizer strategies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Lacking a stable ecology, in the absence of substantial irrigation and chemical "fixes", the soil can become dry and begin to erode. As the soil becomes arid and useless, the need for more land becomes an issue, leading to the destruction of even more land—a high-tech version of [[slash and burn]] agriculture.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Under certain circumstances monocropping can lead to [[deforestation]]&lt;ref name="un.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/6session_crp6.doc|title=Oil Palm and Other Commercial Tree Plantations, Monocropping: Impacts on Indigenous Peoples' Land Tenure and Resource Management Systems and Livelihoods|date=May 2007|author=Victoria Tauli-Corpuz|author2=Parshuram Tamang|series=Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues Sixth session|location=New York|publisher=UN}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the displacement of [[indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt; For example, since 1970 the Amazon Rainforest has lost nearly 1/5 of its forest cover&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cfr.org/interactives/amazon-deforestation/#/en|title=Deforestation in the Amazon – Council on Foreign Relations|work=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A main cause of this deforestation is local farmers clearing land for more crops. In Colombia, the need for more farming land is causing the displacement of large populations of peasants.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In order to help reduce dependence on fossil fuels the U.S. government subsidizes the monocropping of corn and soybeans to be used in [[Ethanol fuel in the United States|ethanol production]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americas.irc-online.org/am/4510 |accessdate=December 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210005913/http://americas.irc-online.org/am/4510 |archivedate=December 10, 2008|title=Biofuels and Small Farmers|date= August 29, 2007|author=Victor M. Quintana S. |translator= Annette Ramos}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, monocropping itself is highly chemical- and energy-intensive, as studies by Nelson (2006)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agroforestry.net/events/afwksp2006/pres/Nelson_Monocrops_script.pdf Poly- and Monocultures: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly]&lt;/ref&gt; indicate. Such studies have shown that the "hidden" [[Energy economics|energy costs]] associated with producing each unit of bio-fuel are significantly larger than the amount of energy available from the fuel itself.

According to Prof. Mikail Bayram who made an extensive research on Nasreddin, his full name is Nasir ud-din Mahmood al-Khoyi, his title Ahi Evran (as being the leader of the ahi organization). According to him, Nasreddin was born in the city of [[Khoy]] in [[West Azerbaijan Province]] of [[Iran]], had his education in [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and became the pupil of famous Quran mufassir [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]] in Herat. He was sent to Anatolia by the Khalif in Baghdad to organize resistance and uprising against the Mongol invasion. He served as a [[kadı]] (an Islamic judge and ombudsman) in [[Kayseri]]. This explains why he addresses judicial problems in the jokes not only religious ones. During the turmoil of the Mongol invasion he became a political opponent of [[Persia]]n [[Rumi]]. He was addressed in [[Masnavi]] by juha anecdotes for this reason. He became the [[vizier|vazir]] at the court of [[Kaykaus II]]. Having lived in numerous cities in vast area and being steadfastly against the Mongol invasion as well as having his witty character, he was embraced by various nations and cultures from Turkey to Arabia, from Persia to Afghanistan, and from Russia to China, most of which suffered from those invasions.

As generations have gone by, new stories have been added to the Nasreddin corpus, others have been modified, and he and his tales have spread to many regions. The themes in the tales have become part of the folklore of a number of nations and express the national imaginations of a variety of cultures. Although most of them depict Nasreddin in an early small-village setting, the tales deal with concepts that have a certain timelessness. They purvey a pithy [[folk wisdom]] that triumphs over all trials and tribulations. The oldest manuscript of Nasreddin dates to 1571.

Today, Nasreddin stories are told in a wide variety of regions, especially across the [[Muslim world]] and have been translated into many languages. Some regions independently developed a character similar to Nasreddin, and the stories have become part of a larger whole. In many regions, Nasreddin is a major part of the culture, and is quoted or alluded to frequently in daily life. Since there are thousands of different Nasreddin stories, one can be found to fit almost any occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Ohebsion, Rodney (2004) ''A Collection of Wisdom'', Immediex Publishing, {{ISBN|1-932968-19-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nasreddin often appears as a whimsical character of a large [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], Chinese, [[Greek people|Greek]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi]], [[Judeo-Spanish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], Russian, and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] [[Folklore|folk]] tradition of [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]s, not entirely different from [[zen]] [[koan]]s.

1996–1997 was declared International Nasreddin Year by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rri.ro/art.shtml?lang=1&amp;sec=170&amp;art=27256 ''"...UNESCO declared 1996–1997 the International Nasreddin Year..."''].&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sicily and Southern Italy he is known as "[[Giufà]]".

In the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] and [[Indonesia]]n culture, many of his stories are being told under the name of "Abunuwasi" or "Abunawas", though this confuses Nasreddin with an entirely different man – the poet [[Abu Nuwas]], known for homoerotic verse.

In China, where stories of him are well known, he is known by the various [[transliteration]]s from his [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] name, 阿凡提 (Āfántí) and 阿方提 (Āfāngtí). The Uyghurs believe that he was from [[Xinjiang]], while the [[Uzbeks]] believe he was from [[Bukhara]].&lt;ref name=fedai /&gt; Shanghai Animation Film Studio produced a 13-episode Nasreddin related animation called 'The Story of Afanti'/ 阿凡提 in 1979, which became one of the most influential animations in China's history. The musical Nasirdin Apandim features the legend of Nasreddin [[effendi]] ("sir, lord"), largely sourced from Uighur folklore.

In Central Asia, he is commonly known as "Afandi". The Central Asian peoples also claim his local origin, as do Uyghurs.

== Tales ==
The Nasreddin stories are known throughout the Middle East and have touched cultures around the world. Superficially, most of the Nasreddin stories may be told as jokes or humorous anecdotes. They are told and retold endlessly in the teahouses and [[caravanserai]]s of Asia and can be heard in homes and on the radio. But it is inherent in a Nasreddin story that it may be understood at many levels. There is the joke, followed by a moral and usually the little extra which brings the consciousness of the potential mystic a little further on the way to realization.&lt;ref&gt;Idris Shah (1964), ''The Sufis'', London: W. H. Allen {{ISBN|0-385-07966-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples ===

==== The Sermon ====
:Once Nasreddin was invited to deliver a [[sermon]]. When he got on the pulpit, he asked, ''Do you know what I am going to say?'' The audience replied ''"no"'', so he announced, ''I have no desire to speak to people who don't even know what I will be talking about!'' and left.
:The people felt embarrassed and called him back again the next day. This time, when he asked the same question, the people replied ''yes''. So Nasreddin said, ''Well, since you already know what I am going to say, I won't waste any more of your time!'' and left.
:Now the people were really perplexed. They decided to try one more time and once again invited the Mulla to speak the following week. Once again he asked the same question – ''Do you know what I am going to say?'' Now the people were prepared and so half of them answered "yes" while the other half replied "no". So Nasreddin said ''Let the half who know what I am going to say, tell it to the half who don't,'' and left.&lt;ref&gt;Many written versions of this tale exist, for example in {{cite book|last=Kelsey|first=Alice|title=Once the Hodja|year=1943|publisher=David McKay Company Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:A neighbour came to the gate of Mulla Nasreddin's yard. The Mulla went to meet him outside.
:"Would you mind, Mulla," the neighbour asked, "can you lend me your donkey today? I have some goods to transport to the next town."
:The Mulla didn't feel inclined to lend out the animal to that particular man, however. So, not to seem rude, he answered:
:"I'm sorry, but I've already lent him to somebody else."
:All of a sudden the donkey could be heard braying loudly behind the wall of the yard.
:"But Mulla," the neighbour exclaimed. "I can hear it behind that wall!"
:"Whom do you believe," the Mulla replied indignantly, "the donkey or your Mulla?"&lt;ref&gt;Widely retold, for instance in {{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=[[The Sufis]]|year=1964|publisher=Jonathan Cape|isbn=0-86304-074-8 |pages=78–79|authorlink=Idries Shah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taste the same ====
:Some children saw Nasreddin coming from the vineyard with two baskets full of grapes loaded on his donkey. They gathered around him and asked him to give them a taste.
:Nasreddin picked up a bunch of grapes and gave each child a grape.
:"You have so much, but you gave us so little," the children whined.
:"There is no difference whether you have a basketful or a small piece. They all taste the same," Nasreddin answered, and continued on his way.&lt;ref&gt;A similar story is presented in {{cite book|last=Shah|first=Idries|title=The subtleties of the inimitable Mulla Nasrudin|year=1985|publisher=Octagon Press|location=London|isbn=0-86304-040-3|page=60|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reaching enlightenment ====
:Nasreddin was walking in the [[bazaar]] with a large group of followers. Whatever Nasreddin did, his followers immediately copied. Every few steps Nasreddin would stop and shake his hands in the air, touch his feet and jump up yelling "Hu Hu Hu!". So his followers would also stop and do exactly the same thing.
:One of the merchants, who knew Nasreddin, quietly asked him: "What are you doing my old friend? Why are these people imitating you?"
:"I have become a [[Sufi]] [[Sheikh]]," replied Nasreddin. "These are my [[Murid]]s [spiritual seekers]; I am helping them reach enlightenment!"
:"How do you know when they reach enlightenment?"
:"That’s the easy part! Every morning I count them. The ones who have left – have reached enlightenment!"
:{{Cite quote|date=May 2011}}

==== Nasreddin's ring ====
:Mulla had lost his ring in the living room. He searched for it for a while, but since he could not find it, he went out into the yard and began to look there. His wife, who saw what he was doing, asked: “Mulla, you lost your ring in the room, why are you looking for it in the yard?” Mulla stroked his beard and said: “The room is too dark and I can’t see very well. I came out to the courtyard to look for my ring because there is much more light out here.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/04/11/better-light/|title="Did You Lose the Keys Here?"

== Azerbaijani literature ==
[[File:Mollanas2.JPG|right|upright|thumb|Molla Nasraddin cover (1910, #22).]]
{{Main article|Molla Nasraddin (magazine)}}
Nasreddin was the main character in a magazine, called simply [[Molla Nasraddin (magazine)|Molla Nasraddin]], published in [[Azerbaijan]] and "read across the Muslim world from Morocco to Iran". The eight-page [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] [[satire|satirical]] periodical was published in [[Tiflis]] (from 1906 to 1917), [[Tabriz]] (in 1921) and [[Baku]] (from 1922 to 1931) in the [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]] and occasionally Russian languages. Founded by [[Jalil Mammadguluzadeh]], it depicted [[social inequality|inequality]], [[cultural assimilation]], and [[Police corruption|corruption]] and ridiculed the backward lifestyles and values of clergy and religious fanatics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/43_folder/43_articles/43_mollamag.html Molla Nasraddin – The Magazine: Laughter that Pricked the Conscience of a Nation] by Jala Garibova. ''Azerbaijan International''. #4.3. Autumn 1996&lt;/ref&gt; implicitly calling upon the readers to modernize and accept [[Westernization|Western]] social norms and practices.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} The magazine was frequently banned&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.baku.ru/enc-show.php?cmm_id=0&amp;id=410&amp;c=930 ''Molla Nasraddin''], an entry from the [[Great Soviet Encyclopaedia]] by A.Sharif.

BBC Persian. 6 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== European and Western folk tales, literary works and pop culture ==
Some Nasreddin tales also appear in collections of [[Aesop's fables]]. ''[[The miller, his son and the donkey]]'' is one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type1215.html|title=The Man, the Boy, and the Donkey|work=pitt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others are "The Ass with a Burden of Salt" ([[Perry Index]] 180) and "[[The Satyr and the Traveller]]."

In some [[Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] folk tales that originated during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, the name appears as an [[antagonist]] to a local wise man, named ''[[Sly Peter]]''. In [[Sicily]] the same tales involve a man named ''[[Giufà]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIGsU7bJ9ZcC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=giufa&amp;hl=cs#v=onepage&amp;q=giufa&amp;f=false|title=Mal'uocchiu|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic]]&lt;ref&gt;Ottoman Legends, Ankara Folklore Convention, Austin Legrasse, Book of Abstracts, p.23&lt;/ref&gt; culture, spread throughout the Ottoman Empire, a character that appears in many folk tales is named ''[[Djohá]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ladinokomunita.tripod.com/articles/djoha.html Tripod.com], Djoha – Personaje – Ponte en la Area del Mediterraneo&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sefarad.org/judeoespagnol/matilda/matilda.php/id/46/ Sefarad.org], European Sephardic Institute&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Republic of Romania|Romanian]], the existing stories come from an 1853 verse compilation edited by [[Anton Pann]], a philologist and poet renowned for authoring the current [[Romanian anthem]].&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/N%C4%83zdr%C4%83v%C4%83niile_lui_Nastratin_Hogea|title=Năzdrăvăniile lui Nastratin Hogea|work=wikisource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasreddin is mostly known as a character from short tales; whole novels and stories have later been written and production began on a never-completed [[The Thief and the Cobbler#Development and early production on Nasreddin (1964-1972)|animated feature film]].&lt;ref&gt;Dobbs, Mike (1996), [http://groups.google.com/group/rec.arts.animation/msg/e7fd132fc8aa689f "An Arabian Knight-mare"], Animato! (35)&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, Nasreddin is known mostly because of the Russian work ''Возмутитель спокойствия'' by [[Leonid Solovyov]] (English translations: "The Beggar in the Harem: Impudent Adventures in Old Bukhara", 1956, and "The Tale of Hodja Nasreddin: Disturber of the Peace", 2009&lt;ref name="translit"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). The composer [[Shostakovich]] celebrated Nasreddin, among other figures, in the second movement (''Yumor'', "Humor") of his Symphony No. 13. The text, by [[Yevgeny Yevtushenko]], portrays humor as a weapon against dictatorship and tyranny. Shostakovich's music shares many of the "foolish yet profound" qualities of Nasreddin's sayings listed above.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

The Graeco-Armenian mystic [[G. I. Gurdjieff]] often referred to "our own dear Mullah Nasr Eddin", also
calling him an "incomparable teacher", particularly in his book ''[[Beelzebub's Tales]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endlesssearch.co.uk/gurdjieff_eddin.htm |title=The 86 Sayings of Mullah Nassr Eddin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufi philosopher [[Idries Shah]] published several collections of Nasruddin stories in English, and emphasized their teaching value.

He is known as ''Mullah Nasruddin'' in South Asian children's books.&lt;ref name="Naqvi 2016"&gt;{{cite web | last=Naqvi | first=Hassan | title=Problems with privatisation | website=Pakistan Today | date=2016-02-06 | url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2016/02/06/features/problems-with-privatisation/ | accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SENSEX 1977"&gt;{{cite web | author=SENSEX | title=Ranga Shankara to provide professional help to amateur theatre companies in Karnataka | website=The Economic Times | date=1977-02-15 | url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/ranga-shankara-to-provide-professional-help-to-amateur-theatre-companies-in-karnataka/articleshow/50636879.cms | accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uzbek Nasreddin Afandi ==
For [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] people, Nasreddin is one of their own; he is said to have lived and been born in [[Bukhara]].&lt;ref name=fedai&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.folklore.ee/folklore/vol16/mulla.pdf|format=PDF|author=Hixarid Fedai|title=Mulla or Hodja Nasreddin as seen by Cypriot Turks and Greeks|website=folklore.ee}}&lt;/ref&gt; In gatherings, family meetings, and parties they tell each other stories about him that are called "latifa" of "afandi".
There are at least two collections of stories related to Nasriddin Afandi.

Books on him:

* "Afandining qirq bir passhasi" – (Forty-one flies of Afandi) – Zohir A'lam, [[Tashkent]]
* "Afandining besh xotini" – (Five wives of Afandi)

In 1943, the Soviet film ''[[Nasreddin in Bukhara]]'' was directed by [[Yakov Protazanov]] based on Solovyov's book, followed in 1947 by a film called ''The Adventures of Nasreddin'', directed by Nabi Ganiyev and also set in the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbekistan SSR]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mubi.com/lists/treasures-from-the-deep-cinema-of-uzbekistan Cinema of Uzbekistan list on mubi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;«Большой Словарь: Крылатые фразы отечественного кино», Олма Медиа Групп. 2001г., {{ISBN|978-5-7654-1735-5}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=S4ymeA9V2dYC&amp;pg=PA401&amp;dq=%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD+%D0%91%D1%83%D1%85%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0+1963&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=h9YSTueyKZCimQXYtrzJDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD&amp;f=false p. 401.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pahawh Hmong''' (&lt;small&gt;[[Romanized Popular Alphabet|RPA]]&lt;/small&gt;: ''Phajhauj Hmoob'' {{IPA-hmn|pʰâ hâu m̥ɔ́ŋ|}}, known also as ''Ntawv Pahawh, Ntawv Keeb, Ntawv Caub Fab, Ntawv Soob Lwj)'' is an indigenous [[Semi-syllabary|semi-syllabic]] [[writing system|script]], invented in 1959 by [[Shong Lue Yang]], to write two [[Hmong language]]s, Hmong Daw ''(Hmoob Dawb'' White Miao) and Hmong Njua &lt;small&gt;AKA&lt;/small&gt; Hmong Leng ''(Moob Leeg'' Green Miao).

==Form==
Pahawh is written left to right. Each syllable is written with two letters, an [[syllable onset|onset]] ''(la,'' an initial consonant or [[consonant cluster]]) and a [[syllable rime|rime]] ''(yu,'' a vowel, [[diphthong]], or vowel plus [[syllable coda|final consonant]]).&lt;ref&gt;The only final consonant is {{IPA|[ŋ]}}. However, this is sometimes analyzed as vowel nasalization: ''oo, ee, aa'' {{IPA|/ɔŋ, ɛŋ, aŋ/}} or {{IPA|/ɔ̃, ɛ̃, ã/}}. Thus Pahawh can be considered an alphabet where both consonants and vowels may be complex, much like ''x'' {{IPA|[ks]}} and ''i'' {{IPA|[aɪ]}} in English.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the order of these elements is rime-initial, the opposite of their spoken order. (That is, each syllable would seem to be written right to left, if it were transcribed literally into the Roman alphabet.) This is an indication that Shong conceived of the rimes as primary; Pahawh Hmong might therefore be thought of as a vowel-centered [[abugida]]. Tones and many onsets are distinguished by [[diacritic]]s.

The onset ''k'' is not written, so that a rime letter (V) written by itself is read as ''kV.'' Nor is the rime ''au'' (on mid tone) written, so that an onset letter (C) written by itself is read ''Cau,'' except following a bare rime, as otherwise these could be read as a single syllable. The ''absence'' of an onset, however, is indicated with a [[zero consonant|null-onset letter]]. Again, this is similar to an abugida, but with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Coincidentally, RPA also has an inherent consonant which is not written, [[glottal stop]], along with a null-consonant diacritic, the apostrophe: ''ai'' {{IPA|/ʔāi/}}, ''’ai'' {{IPA|/āi/}}. Few Hmong words are vowel initial, so writing  the absence of a consonant with an apostrophe is more economical than writing glottal stop with an apostrophe.&lt;/ref&gt;

For an example of the positional variation, consider the phrase (in RPA orthography) ''kuv rau tshais rau koj noj'' "I serve you breakfast". Since the first word, ''kuv,'' starts with a ''k,'' it is written as the bare rime ''uv'' in Pahawh. The word ''rau,'' with mid-tone ''au'' as the rime, is normally written as a bare onset ''r,'' and indeed this is the case for the second instance in this sentence. However, since the first ''rau'' follows a bare rime, it cannot be written as a bare onset ''r,'' or the combination might be read as ''ruv'' rather than ''kuv rau.'' Therefore, the combination ''kuv rau'' is written ''uv rau'' rather than ''uv r,'' with the rime ''au'' made explicit (Smalley ''et al.'' 1990:58).

[[Image:Pahawh la glossed.png|right|thumb|Pahawh onsets. Except for the null onset series at lower right, these are consistent for stages 2–4. Row 3 reads ''l-, dl-, dlh-'' in Hmong Njua.]]
[[Image:Pahawh yu glossed.png|left|thumb|Pahawh rimes, stage 2. The tone diacritics are irregular.  Note that ''-v'' tone is sometimes written with the left-hand rime glyph, sometimes with the right. In stage 3, it is consistently written with the right-hand glyph, and all tones have the diacritics of ''koo'' above: [left glyph] ''-b'' none, ''-m'' dot, ''-j'' [[Macron (diacritic)|macron]]; [right glyph] ''-v'' none, ''-'' dot, ''-s'' macron, ''-g'' [[trema (diacritic)|trema]]. When used, ''-d'' tone takes the left-hand glyphs with a stroke {{angle bracket|'}} diacritic. The ''ia'' and ''a'' rows may be read ''a'' and ''aa'' in Hmong Njua.]]
Pahawh has twenty onset letters to transcribe sixty phonemic onsets. This is accomplished with two diacritics, a dot and a tack, written above the onset. However, although there is some scattered similarity between the sounds of the resulting forms, there is no overall pattern to the system. For example, the letter for ''h'' with a dot is pronounced ''th,'' and with a tack is pronounced ''pl.'' The null consonant does not take diacritics in Hmong Daw, but does in Hmong Njua, for two onsets, ''ndl'' and ''ndlh,'' which only occur in Hmong Njua. (Similarly, Daw ''d'' and ''dh,'' which do not occur in Njua, are used for Njua ''dl'' and ''dlh,'' which do not occur in Daw.)

The rimes, in contrast, are over-specified. There are thirteen rime sounds, but twenty-six letters to represent them. One of each pair takes four of the eight [[tone (linguistics)|tones]], while the other takes the other four tones. Diacritics (none, dot, macron, and trema) distinguish the tones that each rime letter may carry. One of the tones, written ''-d'' in RPA, is not phonemic but is a [[prosodic unit]]-final [[allophone]] of the [[creaky voice|creaky]] [[register (phonology)|register]] ''-m.'' It may be written in Pahawh by changing the dot diacritic to a short stroke, but it is not used by many people.

Shong used the rimes with the values ''kiab'' and ''kab'' in Hmong Daw for ''kab'' and ''kaab'' ({{IPA|/káŋ/}}) in Hmong Njua. However, Cwjmem retains the Daw values for Njua and adds a pipe (|) to the left of ''kab'' etc. to write ''kaab'' etc.

In addition to phonetic elements, Pahawh Hmong has a minor [[logograph]]ic component, with characters for
*the numerals 0–10, {{e|2}} (hundreds), {{e|4}} (myriads), {{e|6}} (millions), {{e|8}}, {{e|10}}, and {{e|12}} (billions), though the higher numerals have been dropped leaving a positional decimal system
*[[arithmetic]]al signs
*periods of time: year, season, month, day, date
*the most common [[classifier (linguistics)|grammatical classifier]], ''lub,'' which when written out phonetically consists of two very similar letters, and
*eighteen [[clan]] signs. These were never disseminated, but were intended to clarify personal relationships in Hmong refugee camps, where people regularly met strangers of unknown clan. Strict taboos govern the behavior of Hmong men and women from the same clan.

Punctuation is derived from the Roman alphabet, presumably through French or Lao,&lt;ref&gt;Punctuation was introduced in 1969 when Chia Koua Vang, who was literate in RPA, wrote to Shong in prison asking him what to put at the ends of sentences. Neither Shong nor any of his other disciples were literate in any other script at this point, so presumably someone taught him punctuation there. (Smalley ''et al.'' 1990:76–77)&lt;/ref&gt; except for a sign introduced by one of Shong's disciples that replaced Shong's {{angle bracket|!}}, but also includes a native sign for [[reduplication]] and a native [[cantillation]] mark.

===Second and third stage tones===
There are two orthographic systems in use for Pahawh Hmong, the ''second reduced stage'' from 1965 and the ''third reduced stage'' from 1970 (see history, below). Some Hmong communities consider second stage to be more authentic, while others prefer third stage as more regular. It would appear that stage two is more widespread.

The differences are primarily in tone assignment. Bare rimes—that is, rime letters without a tone diacritic—have various values in stage two, but are regularly high tone ''(-b)'' or rising tone ''(-v)'' in stage three. Likewise, although the pedagogic charts are organized so that each column corresponds to a single tone, the tonic diacritics are scattered about the columns in stage two, but correspond to them in stage three. (Stage 4, which today is only used for shorthand, dispenses with the ''-v'' rime letters, replacing them with additional diacritics on the ''-b'' rime letters, so that each rime and tone has a single dedicated glyph.)

Tone transcription is that of the [[Romanized Popular Alphabet]].

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
[[Image:Pahawh Source rimes.png|thumb|right|Rimes of stage 1&lt;br&gt;(Hmong Daw values)]]
Pahawh Hmong was the product of a native messianic movement, based on the idea that, throughout history, God had given the Hmong power through the gift of writing, and revoked it as divine retribution.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In 1959 [[Shong Lue Yang]] (''Soob Lwj Yaj''), a Hmong spiritual leader from Laos, created Pahawh. Yang was not previously literate in any language.&lt;ref name="Fadiman291"&gt;[[Anne Fadiman|Fadiman, Anne]]. "Note on Hmong Orthography, Pronunciation, and Quotations." ''The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down''. Farrar, Straus and Giroux. 1997. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; An illiterate peasant, Shong claimed to be the Son of God, messiah of the Hmong and [[Khmu people]], and that God had revealed Pahawh to him in 1959, in northern Vietnam near the border with Laos, to restore writing to the Hmong and Khmu people. Over the next twelve years he and his disciples taught it as part of a Hmong cultural revival movement, mostly in Laos after Shong had fled Communist Vietnam. The Khmuic version of the script never caught on, and has disappeared. Shong continually modified the Hmong script, producing four increasingly sophisticated versions, until he was assassinated by Laotian soldiers in 1971 to stop his growing influence as part of the opposition resistance. Knowledge of the later stages of Pahawh come to us through his disciple Chia Koua Vang, who corresponded with Shong in prison.
[[Image:Pahawh Source onsets.png|thumb|right|Onsets of stage 1&lt;br&gt;(Hmong Daw values)]]
*The first stage of Pahawh, Pahawh Pa ''(Pajhawj Paj),'' common called the '''source''' version, had distinct glyphs for all 60 onsets and 91 rimes of both Hmong Daw and Hmong Njua. Although there were diacritics, there was no relationship between them and the sound values of the letters, and many of the diacritics are unique to a single letter. Among the rimes, there was a strong tendency for letters which differed only in diacritic to share the same vowel and differ in tone. However, this was not absolute. For example, a letter shaped like Ü stood for the rime ''iaj,'' while &lt;u&gt;U&lt;/u&gt;, differing only in its diacritic, stood for the rime ''us.'' Plain U without a diacritic did not occur. Similarly, the letter that, without a diacritic, represents the rime ''ag,'' when combined with a diacritic dot represents the onset ''rh.'' Thus it can be seen that at this stage the diacritics were integral parts of their letters, with only the beginnings of an independent existence.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

:Stage 1 was abandoned after Shong revealed the second stage, with only the occasional glyph showing up when people who know it write using other versions. However, it is not considered obsolete, as people remember Shong's instructions to use this source of all later Pahawh as a sacred script.

*The second stage, Pahawh Njia Dua O ''(Pajhawj Ntsiab Duas Ob)'' "second stage reduced version", was the first practical Hmong script. It was taught by Shong in 1965 and is supported today by the Australian Language Institute and Cwjmem (Everson 1999). The consonants are graphically regular, in that each column in the pedagogic charts contains the same diacritic, but are phonetically irregular, in that the diacritics have no consistent meaning. (This situation remained in all later stages.) Tone assignment is irregular, in that the diacritics do not represent specific tones with the rimes any more than they represent specific features with the consonants. For example, the trema sometimes represents the ''-b'' tone, sometimes ''-j, -v,'' or ''-g,'' depending on which rime it is added to. The one exception is the ''-d'' "tone", which is actually a [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] inflection of the ''-m'' tone. Shong added a specific diacritic for this when Chia, who was familiar with RPA, asked him how RPA ''-d'' should be written, but it was treated as extraneous to the tone system, was not included in the rime charts, and was not always taught to Shong's disciples.
*The third stage, Pahawh Njia Dua Pe ''(Pajhawj Ntsiab Duas Peb)'' "third stage reduced version", introduced in 1970, regularized tone assignment, which was irregular in the second stage. It restores the null onset, which with the addition of diacritics covers Hmong Njua consonants not found in Hmong Daw, that had been found in stage 1, but does not otherwise change the onsets. Chia believes the lack of this series in stage two was merely an oversight on his part in his prison correspondence with Shong (Smalley ''et al.'' 1990:70). It was not distributed as widely in Laos as the second stage, due to fear of admitting knowledge of the script after the Communist takeover. Both second and third stage are currently in use in different Hmong communities; however, because the third stage did not appear widely until after Shong's death, there is a suspicion in many communities that it and the fourth stage were invented by Shong's disciples, and therefore are not authentic Pahawh. In the third stage, there is also presence of different signs for month, tens, and zero.
*The final version, Pahawh Tsa ''(Pajhawj Txha)'' "core version", published in 1971 just a month before Shong's death, was a radical simplification with one letter per rime and one diacritic per tone. The onsets were not changed. The only graphic addition was that of three new tone marks, for seven total, but half of the rimes were eliminated: The ''-b, -m, -d, -j'' tones are written as in stage 3; the ''-v, -, -s, -g'' tones now use the same rime letters as the other tones but with different diacritics: [[circumflex]], underlined dot, underlined stroke, and [[Diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]]. (The diaeresis is retained from stage 3, so only the rime letter changes for this tone.) Stage 4 is not widely known, but is used as a kind of [[shorthand]] by some who do know it; indeed, it may be called "Hmong shorthand" in English.

Pahawh is not as widespread as RPA romanization for writing Hmong, partially because of the difficulties in typesetting it, but it is a source of great pride for many Hmong who do not use it, as in Southeast Asia every respectable language has a script of its own, which RPA does not provide.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} However, for some educated Hmong, Pahawh is considered an embarrassing remnant of a superstitious past (Smalley ''et al.'' 1990:165).

''Mother of Writing: The Origin and Development of a Hmong Messianic Script''. [[University of Chicago Press]], March 23, 1990. 10. Retrieved from [[Google Books]] on March 23, 2012. {{ISBN|0226762866}}, 9780226762869.&lt;/ref&gt;), an anti-Laotian government Hmong group, uses this writing system.&lt;ref name="Fadiman291"/&gt;

==Origin==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
Because Shong was illiterate, it is sometimes assumed that he invented Pahawh ''ex nihilo.'' However, Shong was acutely aware of writing and of the advantages that it provided; indeed, that was the basis of his messianic movement. It would appear that existing scripts provided his inspiration, even if he did not fully understand them, much as the Roman alphabet inspired the illiterate [[Sequoyah]] when he invented the [[Cherokee syllabary|Cherokee script]], in a process called [[trans-cultural diffusion]]. Not only do the forms of the majority of the letters in the oldest stage of Pahawh closely resemble the letters of the local [[Lao script|Lao alphabet]] and missionary scripts such as [[Pollard script|Pollard]] and [[Fraser alphabet|Fraser]], though they are independent in sound value (much like the relationship between Roman and Cherokee), but the appearance of vowel and tone diacritics in those scripts, which would appear nearly random to the illiterate, may explain the idiosyncratic use of diacritics in early Pahawh. Nevertheless, even if the graphic forms of Pahawh letters derive from other scripts, much of the typology of the script, with its primary rimes and secondary onsets, would appear to be Shong's invention.

The later stages of Pahawh became typologically more like Lao and the Roman alphabet, suggesting that perhaps they influenced its evolution. However, even from the start, Pahawh is "fascinatingly similar [...] and fascinatingly different" from the Lao alphabet (Smalley ''et al.'' 1990:90). For example, it resembles an [[abugida]] such as Lao where the order of writing does not reflect the order of speech, but with the roles of consonant and vowel reversed. There is an inherent vowel, as in Lao, though only on one tone, but also an inherent consonant. In Lao, tone depends on the consonant; it is modified with diacritics, but the patterns of modification are complex. In early Pahawh, tone depends on the rime and is modified with irregular diacritics. Starting with stage 2, there are two tone-classes of rime, just as in Lao there are two tone-classes of consonant.

Nearly all other scripts invented by illiterates are [[syllabary|syllabaries]] like Cherokee. However, to represent Hmong as a syllabary, Pahawh would have needed 60×91 = 5460 letters. By breaking each syllable in two in the fashion of Chinese phonetics, Shong was able to write Hmong, in his original version, with a mere 60+91 = 151 letters.

'''Seoirse Brún''' (George Browne), was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[scribe]], fl. 1876. Brún, a native of Creggduff, [[Annaghdown]], [[County Galway]], is known only from a manuscript called RBÉ F006. It contains the following note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''George Browne Cregg Duff This Book/Belongs to him For Certain No Other Person/in This Locality can claim on This/Book but him Alone When he is Dead/and his bones are rotten This Little Book/Will tell his Name when he is quite/Forgotten Given under My ha[n]d this 18th Day of Oct 1876 - George Browne/Cregg Duff Annadown/County of Galway Ireland, The European [[Iliad]].''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Annaghdown]]-[[Headford]] has Irish speakers as of 2009. He may have been descended from one of [[The Tribes of Galway]], the family Browne.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3539">'''Sergius of Reshaina''' (died 536) was a  physician and priest during the 6th century. He is best known for translating medical works from [[Greek language|Greek]] to [[Syriac language|Syriac]], which were eventually translated to [[Arabic]]. [[Reshaina]], where he lived, is located about midway between the then intellectual centres of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] and [[Nisibis]], in northern [[Mesopotamia]].  

The ninth-century translator [[Hunain ibn Ishaq]] gives the names of twenty-six medical texts by [[Galen]] which Sergius translated into Syriac; they were the first significant translations of medical works from Greek into a [[Semitic language]], and presumably were the textbooks Sergius himself had used when he studied at [[Alexandria]]. Hunain is not always complimentary about Sergius's translations, though some he thinks are better, as Sergius became more experienced.  Sergius also translated various other works, including the ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' of [[Aristotle]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''Introduction to the Categories'' and theological works by [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]]. He also composed two works of his own, ''On the Influence of the Moon'' and ''The Movement on the Sun'', probably drawing heavily on Greek sources.

Recently (early 21st century), a [[palimpsest]] with an undertext of [[Galen]], translated by Sergius from Greek to Syriac, gathered the attention of scientists. It contains chapters of Galen's ''On Simple Drugs'' that had been lost. The imaging and reading of the text is considered crucial, as it will elucidate the role that Sergius played in the transmission of medical knowledge from Greek into Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://academic.oup.com/jss/article-abstract/58/1/131/1673196?redirectedFrom=fulltext Siam Bhayro et al., "The Syriac Galen Palimpsest: Progress, Prospects and Problems", ''Journal of Semitic Studies'', Volume 58, Issue 1, 1 April 2013, Pages 131–148, https://doi.org/10.1093/jss/fgs042]&lt;/ref&gt; Sergius' translations of Galen were copied and recopied for centuries, and eventually became a bridge for moving the medical expertise of the ancient Greeks to Islamic societies. Syriac texts were much easier than Greek ones to translate into Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/science/medicines-hidden-roots-in-an-ancient-manuscript.html MARK SCHROPE, "Medicine’s Hidden Roots in an Ancient Manuscript", JUNE 1, 2015, The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Sergius kept in close contact with the mostly [[Nestorian Christian|Nestorian]] scholars nearby, he was himself a [[Monophysite]] [[Christian]] priest. In 535, he was sent to [[Rome]] by [[Ephrem of Amid|Ephrem]], Orthodox [[Patriarch of Antioch]], and escorted [[Pope Agapetus I]] to [[Constantinople]]. There he died, the following year.

'''Ahmad Shawqi Daif''' ({{lang-ar|أحمد شوقي ضيف}}; January 13, 1910{{spaced ndash}}March 13, 2005) was an Arabic literary critic and historian. He is considered one of the most influential Arab intellectuals in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=fais&gt;[http://kfip.org/professor-ahmad-shawqi-daif/ Professor Ahmad Shawqi Daif] at the King Faisal International Prize website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Daif was born in the village of Um Hamam in northern Egypt in 1910.&lt;ref name=fais/&gt; He earned his BA and PhD from Fuad al-Awal University,&lt;ref name=fais/&gt; which would later be known as [[Cairo University]]. He was later a professor of Arabic literature at his alma mater for several decades.&lt;ref name=fais/&gt; He was a member of the Egyptian Academy of Sciences and was president of the [[Academy of the Arabic Language in Cairo]] for a few years.&lt;ref name=fais/&gt;

==Work==
Daif studied [[Egyptian literature|Egyptian literary history]] under [[Ahmad Amin]] during the latter's 1939&amp;ndash;1946 tenure. Amin stated his initial belief that Egyptians had not contributed to [[Arabic poetry]] during the [[Middle Ages]] the way other Arab populations had.&lt;ref name=Mazyad47&gt;A. M. H. Mazyad, ''Ahmad Amin'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRAVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA47 page 47]. [[Leiden]]: Brill Archive, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Daif replied that the dearth of properly published Egyptian works from the period made such a judgement tenuous and suggested that he and Amin republish the Egyptian sections in anthologies of poetry from the period.&lt;ref name=Mazyad48&gt;A. M. H. Mazyad, ''Ahmad Amin'', pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Amin redily agreed, and they embarked on the long term project during which Daif wrote the preface and Amin wrote the introduction.&lt;ref name=Mazyad48/&gt; Fellow scholar [[Ihsan Abbas]] assisted with editing the folios for republishing from 1951 to 1952.&lt;ref name=Mazyad47/&gt;

Daif would later author more than 50 works in arts and literature. His study of the development of Arabic poetry during the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] is still considered to be the most important reference book on the topic.&lt;ref name=fais/&gt; His magnum opus was his 100-volume ''History of Arabic Literature'', a project that took 30 years to complete, and was an overview of all poetry, literary criticism and rhetorical studies from [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]] up to the post-[[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid era]].&lt;ref name=fais/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mursi Saad El-Din, [http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/770/cu3.htm Plain Talk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605075827/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/770/cu3.htm |date=2013-06-05 }}. [[Al-Ahram Weekly]] On-Line, #770, 24–30 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is considered indispensable for students of Arabic literature, and some volumes have been reprinted up to 20 times.&lt;ref name=fais/&gt;

Daif caused minor shockwaves during the mid-20th century when he rediscovered the ancient linguistic tract of [[Ibn Maḍāʾ]] known as ''Refutation of the Grammarians''.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam, vol. III, H-IRAM, pg. 856.&lt;/ref&gt; Daif agreed with the central theme of the ''Refutation'': [[Government (linguistics)|linguistic governance]] and [[analogy]] had rendered Arabic language education needlessly difficult and convoluted, and both took the theme as a rallying point for his calls to modernize language arts education in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://acc.teachmideast.org/texts.php?module_id=1&amp;reading_id=35&amp;print=1 "The Emergency of Modern Standard Arabic,"] by Kees Versteegh. Taken from ''The Arabic Language'' by permission of the [[Edinburgh University Press]]. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Daif was widely respected throughout the Arab world, having earned the [[King Faisal International Prize]] for literature in 1983 as well as the Egyptian Presidential Prize for Literature in 2003.&lt;ref name=fais/&gt; During his career, he was also awarded two state prizes in Egypt and the Academy of the Arabic Language Prize.&lt;ref name=fais/&gt;

Daif had many admirers and critics. Levantine writer and diplomat [[Shakib Arslan]] considered himself a defender of Daif against traditionalist criticisms, referring to himself as "the executioner of Shawqi's enemies."&lt;ref&gt;Mattityahu Peled, [https://books.google.com/books?id=doHXj8WsqNMC&amp;pg=PT122 Al-Muwailihi's Criticism of Shawqi's Introduction].

'''Staedtler Mars GmbH &amp; Co. KG''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃtɛtlɐ}}) is a [[Germany|German]] fine writing instrument company and a manufacturer and supplier of writing, artist, and [[engineering drawing]] instruments. The firm was founded by J.S. Staedtler in 1835 and produces a large variety of writing instruments, including [[technical drawing|drafting]] pencils, [[mechanical pencil|propelling pencil]]s, professional pens and standard wooden [[pencil]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.staedtler.com ''Staedtler Mars GmbH &amp; Co. KG (2007)''&lt;/ref&gt; It also produces plastic [[eraser]]s, [[ruler]]s, compasses and other drawing/writing accessories. Staedtler claims to be the largest European manufacturer of [[pencil|wood-cased pencils]], [[Overhead projector|OHP]] pens, [[mechanical pencil]] [[Pencil lead|leads]], [[eraser]]s, and [[modelling clay]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Company Profile."

Its "Noris" line of pencils are extremely common in [[United Kingdom|British]] schools.&lt;ref name="norisinthewild"&gt;{{cite web |title=Noris in the Wild |url=https://bleistift.blog/noris-in-the-wild/ |website=Bleistift.Blog |accessdate=12 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Olovke staedtler.JPG|thumb|Staedtler Noris [[HB lead|HB pencils]]]]
[[File:Staedtler.JPG|thumb|Staedtler [[ball point pen]]]]
[[File:STAEDTLER 925 65.JPG|thumb|Staedtler 925 65]]
The origins of the brand can be traced since the XVII century, when Friedrich Staedtler took over the totality of the pencil manufacturing process, from the lead to the wood. Nevertheless, that activity was forbidden by the Council of Nuremberg, which stated that the manufacturing had to be developed by two different experts. Finally, Staedtler's work helped to abolish that regulation, therefore facilitating the work of other pencils manufacturers in Nuremberg.&lt;ref name=cuatrosiglos/&gt;

The company was founded by Johann Sebastian Staedtler in 1835 as a pencil factory, first established in Nuremberg, but the roots of the company go back to 1662, when references to Friedrich Staedtler as a pencil-making craftsman were made in the city annals. Staedtler received permission from the municipal council to produce blacklead, red chalk and pastel pencils in his industrial plant. In 1866, the company had 54 employees and produced 15,000 gross (2,160,000 pencils) per year.&lt;ref name=hist&gt;[https://www.staedtler.com/premium/Quality-And-History Quality and history] on Staedtler website&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1900 and 1901 the ''Mars''&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; and ''Noris''&lt;ref name=cuatrosiglos&gt;[https://cincodias.elpais.com/cincodias/2015/06/18/sentidos/1434648348_110485.html Lápices alemanes con cuatro siglos de historia familiar] by María Matos Elices on ''El País''&lt;/ref&gt; brands were created. In 1922 the US subsidiary (located in New York) was established,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whsmith.co.uk/brands/staedtler Staedtler] on WHSmith website&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed by the Japan subsidiary four years later. In 1937 the name was changed to ''Mars Pencil and Fountain Pen Factory'' and the product range was expanded to include mechanical writing instruments. In 1949 began the production of [[ballpoint pen]]s, which started to be widely used instead of [[fountain pens]] (although Staedtler still produces the latter today).

In 1950 propelling pencils (or [[mechanical pencil]]s) began to be manufactured, the first being made out of [[wood]]. Four years later, the "Lumocolor" brand was registered. This brand was used to design the wide range of Staedtler [[Marker pen|markers]]. In 1962 the company began producing [[technical pen]]s.
 
As from 2010, [[FIMO]], MALI, Aquasoft and further brands are being marketed under the Staedtler name.  In addition, the company celebrated its 175th anniversary in 2010.&lt;ref name="Staedtler History"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bayley|first=Caroline|title=Staedtler and Faber-Castell's Productive Pencil Rivalry|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13019777|accessdate=15 March 2012|newspaper=BBS News|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual identity==
Staedtler's first logo came in 1908, when the company introduced the head of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] ([[list of war deities|the god of war]] in [[Religion in ancient Rome|Ancient Rome religion]]), for its homonymous brand of pencils. The Mars figure became the official logo of the whole company in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ofistore.com/blog/que-es-el-logotipo-de-staedtler/ Logotipo de Staedtler]&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of the head of Mars has had several style modifications since its creation, specifically in 1912, 1925, 1952, 1957, 1963, 1973 and 2001.&lt;ref name=hist/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8699">[[File:BCLM-Pot Kettle Black.jpg|thumb|Black pot and kettle]]
"'''The pot calling the kettle black'''" is a proverbial [[idiom]] that may be of Spanish origin of which English versions began to appear in the first half of the 17th century. The idiom is glossed in the original sources as being used of a person who is guilty of the very thing of which they accuse another and is thus an example of [[psychological projection]].

==Origin==
[[File:Cervantes Don Quixote 1620 1.jpg|thumb|Cover of Thomas Shelton's 1620 translation of Don Quixote]]
The earliest appearance of the idiom is in [[Thomas Shelton (translator)|Thomas Shelton's]] 1620 translation of the Spanish novel ''[[Don Quixote]]''. The protagonist is growing increasingly restive under the criticisms of his servant Sancho Panza, of which one is that "You are like what is said that the frying-pan said to the kettle, 'Avant, black-browes'."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/287950.html |title=Phrase Finder}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish text at this point reads: ''Dijo la sartén a la caldera, Quítate allá ojinegra'' (Said the pan to the pot, get out of there black-eyes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/996/996.txt|title= Ch. 67}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is identified as a proverb (''refrán'') in the text, functioning as a retort to the person who criticises another of the same defect that he plainly has. Among several variations, the one where the pan addresses the pot as ''culinegra'' (black-arse) makes clear that they are dirtied in common by contact with the cooking fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regino Etxabe| url= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wl6cQK1_vhIC&amp;lpg=PT178&amp;ots=aZWh74uilg&amp;dq=%22Dijo%20la%20sart%C3%A9n%20a%20la%20caldera%3A%20Qu%C3%ADtate%20all%C3%A1%20ojinegra%22&amp;pg=PT178#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Dijo%20la%20sart%C3%A9n%20a%20la%20caldera:%20Qu%C3%ADtate%20all%C3%A1%20ojinegra%22&amp;f=false |work= Diccionario de refranes comentado |location=Madrid |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version was also recorded in England soon afterwards as "The pot calls the pan burnt-arse" in John Clarke's collection of proverbs, ''Paroemiologia Anglo-Latina'' (1639).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Julia Cresswell|title=''Oxford Dictionary of Word Origins'' |date=2010| url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J4i3zV4vnBAC&amp;lpg=PA339&amp;dq=The%20pot%20calls%20the%20pan%20burnt-arse&amp;pg=PA339#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20pot%20calls%20the%20pan%20burnt-arse&amp;f=false |page= 339}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nearer approach to the present wording is provided by [[William Penn]] in his collection ''[[Some Fruits of Solitude in Reflections and Maxims]]'' (1682):
:"If thou hast not conquer'd thy self in that which is thy own particular Weakness, thou hast no Title to Virtue, tho' thou art free of other Men's. For a Covetous Man to inveigh against Prodigality, an Atheist against Idolatry, a Tyrant against Rebellion, or a Lyer against Forgery, and a Drunkard against Intemperance, is for the Pot to call the Kettle black."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/1/3/169.html |title= William Penn. (1644–1718).  Fruits of Solitude. The Harvard Classics|date=1909–1914|page=Lines 445–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Apart from the final example in this passage, there is not a strict accord between the behaviour of the critic and the person censured.

An alternative modern interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins|author=William Morris, Mary Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|date=1870|author=revised by Adrian Room (Millennium Edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt; far removed from the original intention, argues that while the pot is sooty (being placed on a fire), the kettle is shiny (being placed on coals only); hence, when the pot accuses the kettle of being black, it is the pot's own sooty reflection that it sees: the pot accuses the kettle of a fault that only the pot has, rather than one that they share. The point is illustrated by a poem that appeared anonymously in an early issue of ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]'' from 1876:
{{cquote|1="Oho!" said the pot to the kettle;&lt;br&gt;"You are dirty and ugly and black!&lt;br/&gt;Sure no one would think you were metal,&lt;br&gt;Except when you're given a crack."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
"Not so! not so!" kettle said to the pot;&lt;br&gt;"'Tis your own dirty image you see;&lt;br/&gt;For I am so clean – without blemish or blot – &lt;br&gt;That your blackness is mirrored in me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St Nicholas Magazine 3.4|date=February 1876|url=http://www.memoriademadrid.es/fondos/OTROS/Imp_122916_hem_saintnicholas187602.pdf|page=224|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701094248/http://www.memoriademadrid.es/fondos/OTROS/Imp_122916_hem_saintnicholas187602.pdf|archivedate=2015-07-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* In [[ancient Greece]], mention of '[[the Snake and the Crab]]' signified much the same, where the critic censures its own behaviour in another. The first instance of this is in a drinking song (''[[skolion]]'') dating from the late 6th or early 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francisco Rodríguez Adrados]], ''History of the Graeco-Latin fable'' I, Brill, Leiden NL 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=093Gl8KEktMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=crab%2C%20catching&amp;f=false p.146]&lt;/ref&gt; The fable ascribed to [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop]] concerns a mother crab and its young, where the mother tells the child to walk straight and is asked in return to demonstrate how that is done.&lt;ref&gt;''Folklore and Fable'' vol.XVII, New York 1909, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OSoO9UM3lx8C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%22The+Two+Crabs%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TWLwTsSRI-nl4QTu1Ji_AQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Two%20Crabs%22&amp;f=false p.30]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The same theme differently expressed occurs in the [[Aramaic]] version of the story of [[Ahiqar]], dating from about 500 BCE. 'The bramble sent to the pomegranate tree saying, "Wherefore the multitude of thy thorns to him that toucheth thy fruit?" The pomegranate tree answered and said to the bramble, "Thou art all thorns to him that toucheth thee".&lt;ref&gt;''The Words of Ahiqar'': Aramaic proverbs and precepts, [http://www.syriacstudies.com/AFSS/Syriac_Articles_in_English/Entries/2007/12/12_Aramaic_Proverbs_and_Precepts_%28Translator%3A__H._L._Ginsberg%29_.html Syriac Studies site] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126045419/http://www.syriacstudies.com/AFSS/Syriac_Articles_in_English/Entries/2007/12/12_Aramaic_Proverbs_and_Precepts_(Translator:__H._L._Ginsberg)_.html |date=2012-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In {{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=American Standard|book=Matthew|chapter=7|verse=3|range=-5}}, it is criticism of a less significant failing by those who are worse that is the target of the [[Sermon on the Mount]]: "Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4759">'''Wolfdietrich Schnurre''' (22 August 1920 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Weimar Republic|Germany]] – 9 June 1989 in [[Kiel]], [[West Germany]]) was a German writer.

Schnurre was an important literary figure of post-war West Germany. Apart from numerous short stories he also wrote novels, tales, diaries, poems, radio plays and (beginning in the 1960s) children's books which he partly illustrated himself.

== Life and work ==

Schnurre grew up in Frankfurt before his father, a librarian, moved to [[Berlin]] in 1928. Here Schnurre attended a socialist elementary school and grammar school. Between 1939 and 1945 he involuntarily became a Wehrmacht soldier. In April 1945 he fled to [[Westphalia]] and returned to Berlin after the end of war. In the beginning he lived in the Eastern part of the city, but in 1946 he moved to West Berlin. In the following years he worked as theatre and movie [[reviewer]] for ''[[Deutsche Rundschau]]'' and other Berlin newspapers.

From 1950 Schnurre was an independent writer. He was a founding member of the [[literary association]] ''[[Gruppe 47]]'' and his short story ''Das Begräbnis'' (The Funeral) was the first piece of literature read at the group's initial meeting. He was also member of [[International PEN|PEN]] in the Federal republic of Germany which he left in 1961 to protest against PEN's silence after the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]]. Since 1959 Schnurre was member of the German Academy for Language and Literature in [[Darmstadt]]. In 1964 he came down with severe [[polyneuritis]].

Schurre received several awards for his works including the ''Prize Young Generation of the Fontane Award of the City of Berlin'' (1958), the ''Immermann Award'' (1959), the ''Georg Marckensen Literature Award'' (1962), the ''Federal Cross of Merit'' ([[Bundesverdienstkreuz]], 1981), the ''Literature Award of the City of [[Cologne]]'' (1982), the ''[[Georg Büchner Prize]] (1983) and the Culture Award of the City of [[Kiel]] (1989).

'''Wolof''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|oʊ|l|ɒ|f}}) is a language of [[Senegal]], [[the Gambia]] and [[Mauritania]], and the native language of the [[Wolof people]]. Like the neighbouring languages [[Serer language|Serer]] and [[Fula language|Fula]], it belongs to the [[Senegambian languages|Senegambian branch]] of the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo language family]]. Unlike most other languages of the Niger-Congo family, Wolof is not a [[tonal language]]. 

Wolof originated as the language of the [[Lebu people]].&lt;ref name="FalolaSalm 280"&gt;Falola, Toyin; Salm, Steven J. Urbanization and African cultures. Carolina Academic Press, 2005. {{ISBN|0-89089-558-9}}. p 280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ngom 2"&gt;Ngom, Fallou. Wolof. Lincom, 2003. {{ISBN|3-89586-845-0}}. p 2&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most widely spoken language in Senegal, spoken natively by the Wolof people (40% of the population) but also by most other Senegalese as a second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nalrc.indiana.edu/brochures/wolof.pdf|title=Wolof Brochure|last=|first=|date=|website=Indiana.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolof [[dialect]]s vary geographically and between rural and urban areas. "[[Dakar]]-Wolof", for instance, is an urban mixture of Wolof, [[French language|French]], and [[Arabic]].

"Wolof" is the standard spelling and may refer to the Wolof people or to Wolof culture. Variants include the older French ''Ouolof'' and the principally Gambian ''Wollof'', ''Jolof'', ''jollof'', etc., which now typically refers either to the [[Jolof Empire]] or to [[jollof rice]], a common West African rice dish. Now-archaic forms include ''Volof'' and ''Olof''.

The [[English language]] is believed to have [[loanword|adopted]] some Wolof words, such as ''[[banana]]'', via [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=banana&amp;searchmode=none |title="banana" |last1=Harper |first1=Douglas |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=6 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''yum/yummy'', from Wolof ''nyam'' "to taste";&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Munro and Dieynaba Gaye, "Ay Baati Wolof/A Wolof Dictionary, Revised Edition, 1997, UCLA Occasional Papers in Linguistics, Number 19". Regents of the University of California, Los Angeles, 1997. p 145&lt;/ref&gt; ''nyam'' in several [[English-based creole languages#List|Caribbean English Creoles]] meaning "to eat" (compare [[Seychellois Creole]] ''nyanmnyanm'', also meaning "to eat").&lt;ref&gt;Danielle D'Offay &amp; Guy Lionet, ''Diksyonner Kreol-Franse / Dictionnaire Créole Seychellois – Français'', Helmut Buske Verlag, Hamburg, 1982. In all fairness, the word might as easily be from {{lang-ff|nyaamde}}, "to eat".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical distribution==
[[File:Wolof Empire.jpg|thumb|States of the Wolof Empire]]

Wolof is spoken by more than 10 million people and about 40 percent (approximately 5 million people) of Senegal's population speak Wolof as their native language. Increased mobility, and especially the growth of the capital Dakar, created the need for a common language: today, an additional 40 percent of the population speak Wolof as a second or acquired [[language]]. In the whole region from [[Dakar]] to [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]], and also west and southwest of [[Kaolack]], Wolof is spoken by the vast majority of the people. Typically when various ethnic groups in Senegal come together in cities and towns, they speak Wolof. It is therefore spoken in almost every regional and departmental capital in Senegal. Nevertheless, the official language of Senegal is [[French language|French]].

In [[The Gambia]], although about 20–25 percent of the population speak Wolof as a first language, it has a disproportionate influence because of its prevalence in [[Banjul]], the Gambian capital, where 75 percent of the population use it as a first language. Furthermore, in [[Serekunda]], The Gambia's largest town, although only a tiny minority are ethnic Wolofs, approximately 70 percent of the population speaks and/or understands Wolof. 

In [[Mauritania]], about seven percent of the population (approximately 185,000 people) speak Wolof. Most live near or along the Senegal River that Mauritania shares with Senegal. 

==Classification==
Wolof is one of the [[Senegambian languages]], which are characterized by [[consonant mutation]]. It is often said to be closely related to the [[Fula language]] because of a misreading by Wilson (1989) of the data in Sapir (1971) that have long been used to classify the Atlantic languages.

==Varieties==
Senegalese/Mauritanian Wolof and Gambian Wolof are distinct national standards: they use different orthographies and use different languages (French vs English) as their source for technical loanwords. However, both the spoken and written languages are mutually intelligible. [[Lebu Wolof]], on the other hand, is unintelligible with standard Wolof, a distinction that has been obscured because all Lebu speakers are bilingual in standard Wolof.&lt;ref&gt;Hammarström (2015) Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: a comprehensive review: online appendices&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography and pronunciation==
''Note:'' Phonetic transcriptions are printed between [[square brackets]] &lt;span style="letter-spacing:3px"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; following the rules of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA).

The [[Latin script|Latin]] orthography of Wolof in [[Senegal]] was set by government decrees between 1971 and 1985. The language institute "[[Centre de linguistique appliquée de Dakar]]" (CLAD) is widely acknowledged as an authority when it comes to spelling rules for Wolof. The complete alphabet is A, À, B, C, D, E, É, Ë, F, G, I, J, K, L, M, N, Ñ, Ŋ, O, Ó, P, Q, R, S, T, U, W, X, Y.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jangileen.kalam-alami.net/lessons/prononciation|title=Orthographe et prononciation du wolof {{!}} Jangileen|website=jangileen.kalam-alami.net|language=fr|access-date=2017-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/937136481|title=Dictionnaire wolof-français et français-wolof|last=Léopold.|first=Diouf, Jean|date=2003|publisher=Karthala|year=|isbn=284586454X|location=|pages=35|oclc=937136481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/938108174|title=J'apprends le wolof Damay jàng wolof|last=1944-|first=Yaguello, Marina,|publisher=Karthala|year=|isbn=2865372871|location=|pages=11|oclc=938108174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolof is most often written in this orthography, in which phonemes have a clear one-to-one correspondence to [[grapheme]]s.

Additionally, two other scripts exist: a traditional [[Arabic script|Arabic]]-based transcription of Wolof called [[Wolofal]], which dates back to the pre-colonial period and is still used by many people, and the [[Garay alphabet|Garay]] script, dating to 1961, which has been adopted by a small number of Wolof-speakers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2012/12139-n4261-garay.pdf |title=Preliminary proposal for encoding the Garay script in the SMP of the UCS |last1=Everson |first1=Michael |date=26 April 2012 |publisher=UC Berkeley Script Encoding Initiative (Universal Scripts Project)/International Organization for Standardization |format=PDF |access-date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first syllable of words is [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]]ed; long vowels are pronounced with more time, but are not automatically stressed, as they are in English.

===Vowels===
The vowels are as follows:{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

There may be an additional low vowel, or this may be confusion with orthographic ''à''.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

All vowels may be long (written double) or short.&lt;ref&gt;Long ''ëë'' is rare (Torrence 2013:10).&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/aː/}} is written {{angbr|à}} before a long (prenasalized or geminate) consonant. When ''é'' and ''ó'' are written double, the accent mark is often only on the first letter.

Vowels fall into two [[vowel harmony|harmonizing]] sets according to [[advanced tongue root|ATR]]:  ''i u é ó ë'' are +ATR, ''e o a'' are the −ATR analogues of ''é ó ë''.  For example,&lt;ref&gt;Torrence 2013:11&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Lekk-oon-ngeen'' {{IPA|/lɛkːɔːnŋɡɛːn/}}
:[eat-PAST-FIN.2pl]
:'You (plural) ate.'
:''Dóór-óón-ngéén'' {{IPA|/doːroːnŋɡeːn/}}
:[hit-PAST-FIN.2pl]
:'You (plural) hit.'

There are no −ATR analogues of the high vowels ''i u''. They trigger +ATR harmony in suffixes when they occur in a root, but in a suffix they may be transparent to vowel harmony.

The vowels of some suffixes or enclitics do not harmonize with preceding vowels. In most cases following vowels harmonize with them. That is, they reset the harmony, as if they were a separate word. However, when a suffix/clitic contains a high vowel (+ATR) occurs after a −ATR root, any further suffixes harmonize with the root. That is, the +ATR suffix/clitic is "transparent" to vowel harmony. An example is the negative ''-u-'' in,
:''Door-u-ma-leen-fa'' {{IPA|/dɔːrumalɛːnfa/}}
:[begin-NEG-1sg-3pl-LOC]
:'I did not begin them there'
where harmony would predict ''*door-u-më-léén-fë''.
That is, ''i u'' behave as if they are their own −ATR analogues.

Authors differ in whether they indicate vowel harmony in writing, as well as whether they write clitics as separate words.

All simple nasals, oral stops apart from ''q'' and glottal, and the sonorants ''l r y w'' may be geminated (doubled), though geminate ''r'' only occurs in ideophones.&lt;ref name=USPC&gt;Pape Amadou Gaye, ''Practical Cours in / Cours Practique en Wolof: An Audio–Aural Approach.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some are restricted or rare, and sources disagree about this. Torrence (2013) claims that all consonants but prenasalized stops may be geminate, while Diouf (2009) does not list the fricatives, ''q'', or ''r y w'', and does not recognize glottal stop in the inventor.  The differences may be dialectical or because some sounds are rare.&lt;/ref&gt; (Geminate consonants are written double.) ''Q'' is inherently geminate and may occur in initial position; otherwise geminate consonants and consonant clusters, including ''nt, nc, nk, nq'' ({{IPA|[ɴq]}}), are restricted to word-medial and -final position. Of the consonants in the chart above, ''p d c k'' do not occur in medial or final position, being replaced by ''f r s'' and zero, though geminate ''pp dd cc kk'' are common. Phonetic ''p c k'' do occur finally, but only as allophones of ''b j g'' due to [[final devoicing]].

==Grammar==

===Notable characteristics===

====Pronoun conjugation instead of verbal conjugation====

In Wolof, verbs are unchangeable stems that cannot be conjugated. To express different tenses or aspects of an action, personal pronouns are conjugated&amp;nbsp;– not the verbs. Therefore, the term ''temporal pronoun'' has become established for this part of speech. It is also referred to as a focus form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UFQbAQAAIAAJ|title=Wolof|last=Ngom|first=Fallou|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Lincom|isbn=9783895868450|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Example: The verb '''dem''' means "''to go''" and cannot be changed; the temporal pronoun '''maa ngi''' means "''I/me, here and now''"; the temporal pronoun '''dinaa''' means "''I am soon / I will soon / I will be soon''". With that, the following sentences can be built now: '''Maa ngi dem.''' "''I am going (here and now).''" – '''Dinaa dem.''' "''I will go (soon).''"

====Conjugation with respect to aspect instead of tense====
In Wolof, tenses like present tense, past tense, and future tense are just of secondary importance, they play almost no role. Of crucial importance is the aspect of an action from the speaker's point of view. The most important distinction is whether an action is perfective, i.e., finished, or imperfective, i.e., still going on, from the speaker's point of view, regardless whether the action itself takes place in the past, present, or future. Other aspects indicate whether an action takes place regularly, whether an action will take place for sure, and whether an action wants to emphasize the role of the subject, predicate, or object of the sentence.{{clarify|date=March 2017|reason=These meanings sound like something other than aspect: evidentiality or focus perhaps.}} As a result, conjugation is not done by tenses, but by aspects. Nevertheless, the term ''temporal pronoun'' became usual for these conjugated pronouns, although ''aspect pronoun'' might be a better term.

Example: The verb '''dem''' means "''to go''"; the temporal pronoun '''naa''' means "''I already/definitely''", the temporal pronoun '''dinaa''' means "''I am soon / I will soon / I will be soon''"; the temporal pronoun '''damay''' means "''I (am) regularly/usually''". Now the following sentences can be constructed: '''Dem naa.''' "''I go already / I have already gone.''" – '''Dinaa dem.''' "''I will go soon / I am just going to go.''" – '''Damay dem.''' "''I usually/regularly/normally/am about to go.''"

If the speaker absolutely wants to express that an action took place in the past, this is not done by conjugation, but by adding the suffix '''-(w)oon''' to the verb (in a sentence, the temporal pronoun is still used in a conjugated form along with the past marker).

Example: '''Demoon naa Ndakaaru.''' "''I already went to Dakar.''"

====Action verbs versus static verbs and adjectives====
{{Empty section|date=February 2011}}

====Consonant harmony====
{{Empty section|date=February 2011}}

====Gender====
Wolof does not mark for grammatical gender: there is one pronoun encompassing the English 'he', 'she', and 'it'. The descriptors '''bu góor''' (male / masculine) or '''bu jigéen''' (female / feminine) are often added to words like ''xarit'', 'friend', and ''rakk'', 'younger sibling' to indicate the person's sex.

Markers of noun definiteness (usually called "definite articles") agree with the noun they modify. There are at least ten articles in Wolof, some of them indicating a singular noun, others a plural noun. In Urban Wolof, spoken in large cities like Dakar, the article '''-bi''' is often used as a generic article when the actual article is not known.

Any loan noun from French or English uses '''-bi: butik-bi, xarit-bi''' "the boutique, the friend"

Most Arabic or religious terms use '''-ji: jumma-ji, jigéen-ji''', "the mosque, the girl"

===Numerals===

====Cardinal numbers====

The Wolof numeral system is based on the numbers "5" and "10". It is extremely regular in formation, comparable to [[Chinese numerals#Reading and transcribing numbers|Chinese]]. Example: '''benn''' "''one''", '''juróom''' "''five''", '''juróom-benn''' "''six''" (literally, "five-one"), '''fukk''' "''ten''", '''fukk ak juróom benn''' "''sixteen''" (literally, "ten and five one"), '''ñent-fukk''' "''forty''" (literally, "four-ten"). Alternatively, "thirty" is '''fanweer''', which is roughly the number of days in a lunar month (literally "fan" is day and "weer" is moon.)

====Ordinal numbers====
[[Ordinal number]]s (first, second, third, etc.) are formed by adding the ending '''–éél''' (pronounced ayl) to the [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]].

For example, two is '''ñaar''' and second is '''ñaaréél'''

The one exception to this system is "first", which is '''bu njëk''' (or the adapted French word ''premier'': '''përëmye''')

In urban Wolof it is common to use the forms of the 3rd person plural also for the 1st person plural.

It is also important to note that the verb follows certain temporal pronouns and precedes others.

==Literature==

The [[New Testament]] was translated into Wolof and published in 1987, second edition 2004, and in 2008 with some minor typographical corrections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblewolof.com/ |title=Biblewolof.com |publisher=Biblewolof.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boubacar Boris Diop published his novel ''Doomi Golo'' in Wolof in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of African Literature, p 801&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1994 song "[[7 Seconds (song)|7 Seconds]]" by [[Youssou N'Dour]] and [[Neneh Cherry]] is partially sung in Wolof.

* [[Pidgin Wolof]]
"[[List of proposed etymologies of OK|Okay]]" may be Wolof waaw-kay, “yes,” with a suffix of emphasis, becoming “I agree," or "I will comply.” Wolof is reputed to have been a lingua franca among slaves in the USA, and to have had a strong influence on colloquial American English. Significantly, the emergence of “okay” in the vocabulary of Euro-Americans dates from a period when many refugees from Southern slavery were arriving in the North, and this is where the word was first documented. The words banana, jive, dig (meaning "appreciate"), yam and sock (meaning "to hit") are Wolof. It has been suggested that "hep cat" may also be of Wolof origin.
