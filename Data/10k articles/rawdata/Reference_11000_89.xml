The '''''Annals of St Neots''''' is a Latin chronicle compiled and written at [[Bury St Edmunds]] in the English county of [[Suffolk]] between ''[[Circa|c]]''. 1120 and ''c''. 1140. It covers the history of Britain, extending from its invasion by [[Julius Caesar]] (60 B.C.) to the making of Normandy in 914. Like the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', it is chiefly concerned with Anglo-Saxon history, but it differs from it in adopting a distinct [[East Anglia]]n perspective on certain events and weaving a significant amount of Frankish history into its narrative.

==Manuscript==
Contrary to what the modern title may suggest, the work was not compiled at [[St Neots]] (Huntingdonshire). It owes its present title to antiquary [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]], who in the 1540s&amp;nbsp;– at the time of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution]]&amp;nbsp;– discovered the sole surviving manuscript at St Neots Priory.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, "The East Anglian Chronicle", p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leland, ''Commentarii de Scriptoribus Britannicis'', ed. Hall, vol 1, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Palaeographical analysis has shown that two hands using Late Caroline script were at work, Scribe A for the first quire (pp.&amp;nbsp;1–18) and Scribe B for the remaining part.&lt;ref name=ANxv /&gt; The script is typical of the first half of the 12th century and both hands have been detected in other manuscripts from Bury St Edmunds. According to Dumville, the evidence suggests then that the manuscript was compiled at Bury St Edmunds between ''c''. 1120 and ''c''. 1140.&lt;ref name=ANxvi&gt;Dumville, ''Annals of St Neots'', p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt;

After Leland's discovery, the manuscript passed into the possession of [[Matthew Parker]] (d. 1575), Archbishop of Canterbury, who supplied various annotations. Later, the dean of the college, Thomas Neville, donated the manuscript to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where it is preserved up to this day, under the shelfmark R.7.28. It is bound together with several unrelated documents, forming the first 74 leaves of the compilation.&lt;ref name=ANxv&gt;Dumville, ''Annals  of St Neots'', p. xv&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Antipodes''''' is a public artwork by [[United States|American]] sculptor [[Jim Sanborn]]  located outside of the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in [[Washington, DC]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Antipodes"&gt;{{cite web | author=Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden | year=2008 | title=Antipodes (sculpture). | work=Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture

==Description==

This sculpture consists of two copper curved pieces attached to a piece of petrified wood by steel bands. The "scrolls" have letters punched into them, one piece is in English and the other piece is "coded" in [[Cyrillic]].&lt;ref name="Antipodes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waymarking"&gt;{{cite web | author=vhasler | year=2010 | title=Antipodes - Washington, DC | work=Smithsonian Art Inventory Sculptures | publisher=Waymarking | url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM9D24_Antipodes_Washington_DC | accessdate= 3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition==

The original ''Antipodes'' is a 6 foot high version of the Hirshhorn sculpture that was created in 1992 which was purchased by art collectors Gilbert and Ann Kinney. The small piece was displayed on the terrace of the Kinney home and upon moving the couple donated the piece to the Hirshhorn. In 1997 the [[Neuberger Museum of Art]] commissioned a large scale version of ''Antipodes'' for the Neuberger Biennial. After the Biennial, Sanborn traded the large piece for the smaller version to the Hirshhorn, hence it now residing outside the Washington based museum. The smaller version of ''Antipodes'' has since been sold to a private collector in California via [[L.A. Louver]].&lt;ref name="Elonka"&gt;{{cite web | author=Elonka Dunin | year=2005 | title=Antipodes | work=Sanborn | publisher= | url=http://elonka.com/kryptos/sanborn/antipodes.html | accessdate= 4 January 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100105153302/http://elonka.com/kryptos/sanborn/antipodes.html| archivedate= 5 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==

This sculpture was inspired by Sanborn's ''[[Kryptos]]'' installation. The two texts refer to [[CIA]] and [[KGB]] [[covert]] operations. The English side of the sculpture repeats the text seen on ''Kryptos''. The ''Kryptos'' code is in four parts, three have been solved. However, select differences do exist between the text seen on ''Antipodes'' versus ''Kryptos'' such as spacing, additional dots and letters.

The Cyrillic side has a large amount of text from another of Sanborn's pieces, ''[[Cyrillic Projector]]'', as well as additional text; all of the Cyrillic text has since been solved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.austininc.com/SciRealm/Antipodes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asymptotic safety''' (sometimes also referred to as '''nonperturbative renormalizability''') is a concept in [[quantum field theory]] which aims at finding a consistent and predictive quantum theory of the [[Gravitation|gravitational field]]. Its key ingredient is a [[#Gaussian_and_non-Gaussian_fixed_points|nontrivial fixed point]] of the theory's [[renormalization group]] flow which controls the behavior of the [[coupling constants]] in the ultraviolet (UV) regime and renders physical quantities safe from divergences. Although originally proposed by [[Steven Weinberg]] to find a theory of [[quantum gravity]], the idea of a nontrivial fixed point providing a possible [[UV completion]] can be applied also to other field theories, in particular to [[Renormalization#Renormalizability|perturbatively nonrenormalizable]] ones.  In this respect, it is similar to [[quantum triviality]].

The essence of asymptotic safety is the observation that nontrivial renormalization group fixed points can be used to generalize the procedure of [[Renormalization|perturbative renormalization]]. In an asymptotically safe theory the [[coupling constant|couplings]] do not need to be small or tend to zero in the high energy limit but rather tend to finite values: they approach a nontrivial [[UV fixed point]]. The running of the coupling constants, i.e. their scale dependence described by the renormalization group (RG), is thus special in its UV limit in the sense that all their dimensionless combinations remain finite. This suffices to avoid unphysical divergences, e.g. in [[S-Matrix|scattering amplitudes]]. The requirement of a UV fixed point restricts the form of the [[Action (physics)|bare action]] and the values of the bare coupling constants, which become predictions of the asymptotic safety program rather than inputs.

As for gravity, the standard procedure of perturbative renormalization fails since [[Newton's constant]], the relevant expansion parameter, has negative [[classical scaling dimension|mass dimension]] rendering [[general relativity]] perturbatively nonrenormalizable. This has driven the search for nonperturbative frameworks describing quantum gravity, including asymptotic safety which — in contrast to other approaches—is characterized by its use of quantum field theory methods, without depending on perturbative techniques, however. At the present time, there is accumulating evidence for a fixed point suitable for asymptotic safety, while a rigorous proof of its existence is still lacking.

== Motivation ==
Gravity, at the classical level, is described by [[Einstein field equation|Einstein's field equations]] of general relativity,
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle R_{\mu \nu} - {1 \over 2}g_{\mu \nu}\,R + g_{\mu \nu} \Lambda = 8 \pi G \, T_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt;. These equations combine the [[spacetime]] geometry encoded in the [[metric tensor|metric]] &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; with the matter content comprised in the [[stress–energy tensor|energy–momentum tensor]] &lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. The quantum nature of matter has been tested experimentally, for instance [[quantum electrodynamics]] is by now one of the most accurately confirmed theories in physics. For this reason quantization of gravity seems plausible, too. Unfortunately the quantization cannot be performed in the standard way (perturbative renormalization): Already a simple power-counting consideration signals the perturbative nonrenormalizability since the [[classical scaling dimension|mass dimension]] of Newton's constant is &lt;math&gt;-2&lt;/math&gt;. The problem occurs as follows. According to the [[renormalization|traditional point of view]] renormalization is implemented via the introduction of counterterms that should cancel divergent expressions appearing in [[loop integral]]s. Applying this method to gravity, however, the counterterms required to eliminate all divergences proliferate to an infinite number. As this inevitably leads to an infinite number of free parameters to be measured in experiments, the program is unlikely to have predictive power beyond its use as a low energy [[Effective field theory|effective theory]].

It turns out that the first divergences in the quantization of general relativity which cannot be absorbed in counterterms consistently (i.e. without the necessity of introducing new parameters) appear already at one-loop level in the presence of matter fields.&lt;ref name=tHooft&gt;{{cite journal|last='t Hooft|first=Gerard|last2=Veltman |first2=Martinus J.

At two-loop level the problematic divergences arise even in pure gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goroff|first=Marc H.|author2=Sagnotti, Augusto|title=The ultraviolet behavior of Einstein gravity|journal=Nuclear Physics|year=1986|volume=266|series=B|issue=3–4|pages=709–736|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(86)90193-8|bibcode = 1986NuPhB.266..709G }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to overcome this conceptual difficulty the development of nonperturbative techniques was required, providing various [[Quantum gravity#Candidate theories|candidate theories of quantum gravity]].
For a long time the prevailing view has been that the very concept of quantum field theory — even though remarkably successful in the case of the other fundamental interactions — is doomed to failure for gravity. By way of contrast, the idea of asymptotic safety retains quantum fields as the theoretical arena and instead abandons only the traditional program of perturbative renormalization.

== History of asymptotic safety ==
After having realized the perturbative nonrenormalizability of gravity, physicists tried to employ alternative techniques to cure the divergence problem, for instance resummation or extended theories with suitable matter fields and symmetries, all of which come with their own drawbacks. In 1976, [[Steven Weinberg]] proposed a generalized version of the condition of renormalizability, based on a nontrivial fixed point of the underlying [[renormalization group]] (RG) flow for gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Steven|chapter=Critical Phenomena for Field Theorists |editor-last=Zichichi |editor-first=Antonino |title=Understanding the Fundamental Constituents of Matter |pages=1–52|year=1978|series= The Subnuclear Series|volume=14 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-0931-4_1|isbn=978-1-4684-0931-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This was called asymptotic safety.&lt;ref name="Weinberg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weinberg|first=Steven|chapter=Ultraviolet divergences in quantum theories of gravitation|year=1979|title=General Relativity: An Einstein centenary survey |editor1=S.

The idea of a UV completion by means of a nontrivial fixed point of the renormalization groups had been proposed earlier by [[Kenneth G. Wilson]] and [[Giorgio Parisi]] in [[scalar field theory]]&lt;ref name="WilsonReview"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Kenneth G.|author2=Kogut, John B.|title=The renormalization group and the ε expansion|journal=Physics Reports|year=1974|volume=12|issue=2|pages=75–199|doi=10.1016/0370-1573(74)90023-4|bibcode = 1974PhR....12...75W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Parisi| first= Giorgio | title=On Non-Renormalizable Interactions | journal= New Developments in Quantum Field Theory and Statistical Mechanics Cargèse | year=1976 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-8918-1_12 | pages=281–305| isbn= 978-1-4615-8920-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
(see also [[Quantum triviality]]).
The applicability to perturbatively nonrenormalizable theories was first demonstrated explicitly for the [[Non-linear sigma model]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Brezin | first= Eduard |author2= Zinn-Justin, Jean| title=Renormalization of the nonlinear sigma model in 2 + epsilon dimensions | journal=Physical Review Letters| year= 1976 | volume=36 | issue= 13 |pages=691–693|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.36.691 |bibcode = 1976PhRvL..36..691B }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for a variant of the [[Gross-Neveu model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaw&amp;#281;dzki|first=Krzysztof|author2=Kupiainen, Antti|title=Renormalizing the nonrenormalizable|journal=Physical Review Letters|year=1985|volume=55|issue=4|pages=363–365|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.363|bibcode = 1985PhRvL..55..363G|pmid=10032331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for gravity, the first studies concerning this new concept were performed in &lt;math&gt;d=2+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; spacetime dimensions in the late seventies. In exactly two dimensions there is a theory of pure gravity that is renormalizable according to the old point of view. (In order to render the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {1 \over 16\pi G} \int \mathrm{d}^2 x \sqrt{g} \, R&lt;/math&gt; dimensionless, Newton's constant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; must have [[classical scaling dimension|mass dimension]] zero.) For small but finite &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation theory]] is still applicable, and one can expand the [[Beta function (physics)|beta-function]] (&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-function) describing the renormalization group running of Newton's constant as a power series in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, in this spirit it was possible to prove that it displays a nontrivial fixed point.&lt;ref name="Weinberg" /&gt;

However, it was not clear how to do a continuation from &lt;math&gt;d=2+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;d=4&lt;/math&gt; dimensions as the calculations relied on the smallness of the expansion parameter &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. The computational methods for a nonperturbative treatment were not at hand by this time. For this reason the idea of asymptotic safety in quantum gravity was put aside for some years. Only in the early 90s, aspects of &lt;math&gt;2+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; dimensional gravity have been revised in various works, but still not continuing the dimension to four.

As for calculations beyond perturbation theory, the situation improved with the advent of new [[functional renormalization group]] methods, in particular the so-called ''effective average action'' (a scale dependent version of the [[effective action]]). Introduced in 1993 by [[Christof Wetterich]] and Tim R Morris for scalar theories,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wetterich|first=Christof|title=Exact evolution equation for the effective potential|journal=Phys.

In 1996, Martin Reuter constructed a similar effective average action and the associated flow equation for the gravitational field.&lt;ref name="MR1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reuter|first=Martin|title=Nonperturbative evolution equation for quantum gravity|journal=Phys.

It complies with the requirement of [[background independence]], one of the fundamental tenets of quantum gravity. This work can be considered an essential breakthrough in asymptotic safety related studies on quantum gravity as it provides the possibility of nonperturbative computations for arbitrary spacetime dimensions. It was shown that at least for the [[#The_Einstein–Hilbert_truncation|Einstein–Hilbert truncation]], the simplest ansatz for the effective average action, a nontrivial fixed point is indeed present.

These results mark the starting point for many calculations that followed. Since it was not clear in the pioneer work by Martin Reuter to what extent the findings depended on the truncation ansatz considered, the next obvious step consisted in enlarging the truncation. This process was initiated by Roberto Percacci and collaborators, starting with the inclusion of matter fields.&lt;ref name="DouPercacci"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dou|first=Djamel|author2=Percacci, Roberto|title=The running gravitational couplings|journal=Classical and Quantum Gravity|year=1998|volume=15|issue=11|pages=3449–3468|doi=10.1088/0264-9381/15/11/011|arxiv=hep-th/9707239|bibcode = 1998CQGra..15.3449D }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Up to the present many different works by a continuously growing community – including, e.g., &lt;math&gt;f(R)&lt;/math&gt;- and [[Weyl tensor]] squared truncations – have confirmed independently that the asymptotic safety scenario is actually possible: The existence of a nontrivial fixed point was shown within each truncation studied so far.&lt;ref name="reviews"&gt;For reviews on asymptotic safety and QEG with comprehensive lists of references see [[#Further_reading|Further reading]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although still lacking a final proof, there is mounting evidence that the asymptotic safety program can ultimately lead to a consistent and predictive quantum theory of gravity within the general framework of [[quantum field theory]].

== Asymptotic safety: The main idea ==

=== Theory space ===

[[File:UVCriticalSurfaceInTheorySpace.png|thumb|380px|Trajectories of the [[renormalization group]] flow in theory space, parametrized by infinitely many coupling constants. By convention, the arrows of the vector field (and the one on the green trajectory) point from UV to IR scales. The set of actions which lie inside the theory space and are pulled into the [[UV fixed point|fixed point]] under the inverse RG flow (i.e., going in the direction opposite to the arrows) is referred to as UV critical surface. The asymptotic safety hypothesis is that a trajectory can only be realized in Nature if it is contained in the UV critical surface since only then it has a well-behaved high energy limit (orange, blue, and magenta trajectories, by way of example). Trajectories outside this surface escape theory space for &lt;math&gt;k\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt; since they develop unacceptable divergences in the UV, while going to lower scales they approach the UV critical surface. This situation is represented by the green trajectory which lies above the surface and runs away from it for increasing RG scale (opposite to the green arrow).]]

The asymptotic safety program adopts a modern [[Renormalization group|Wilsonian viewpoint]] on quantum field theory. Here the basic input data to be fixed at the beginning are, firstly, the kinds of quantum fields carrying the theory's [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] and, secondly, the underlying [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetries]]. For any theory considered, these data determine the stage the renormalization group dynamics takes place on, the so-called theory space. It consists of all possible action functionals depending on the fields selected and respecting the prescribed symmetry principles. Each point in this theory space thus represents one possible action. Often one may think of the space as spanned by all suitable field monomials. In this sense any action in theory space is a linear combination of field monomials, where the corresponding coefficients are the [[coupling constants]], &lt;math&gt;\{g_\alpha\}&lt;/math&gt;. (Here all couplings are assumed to be dimensionless. Couplings can always be made dimensionless by multiplication with a suitable power of the RG scale.)

=== Renormalization group flow ===

The [[renormalization group]] (RG) describes the change of a physical system due to smoothing or averaging out microscopic details when going to a lower resolution. This brings into play a notion of scale dependence for the action functionals of interest. Infinitesimal RG transformations map actions to nearby ones, thus giving rise to a vector field on theory space. The scale dependence of an action is encoded in a "running" of the coupling constants parametrizing this action, &lt;math&gt;\{g_\alpha\} \equiv \{g_\alpha(k)\}&lt;/math&gt;, with the RG scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. This gives rise to a trajectory in theory space (RG trajectory), describing the evolution of an action functional with respect to the scale. Which of all possible trajectories is realized in Nature has to be determined by measurements.

=== Taking the UV limit ===

The construction of a quantum field theory amounts to finding an RG trajectory which is infinitely extended in the sense that the action functional described by &lt;math&gt;\{g_\alpha(k)\}&lt;/math&gt; is well-behaved for all values of the momentum scale parameter &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, including the [[infrared limit]] &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; and the ultraviolet (UV) limit &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;. Asymptotic safety is a way of dealing with the latter limit. Its fundamental requirement is the existence of a [[UV fixed point|fixed point]] of the RG flow. By definition this is a point &lt;math&gt;\{g_\alpha^*\}&lt;/math&gt; in the theory space where the running of all couplings stops, or, in other words, a zero of all [[Beta function (physics)|beta-functions]]: &lt;math&gt;\beta_\gamma(\{g_\alpha^*\})=0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;. In addition that fixed point must have at least one UV-attractive direction. This ensures that there are one or more RG trajectories which run into the fixed point for increasing scale. The set of all points in the theory space that are "pulled" into the UV fixed point by going to larger scales is referred to as ''UV critical surface''. Thus the UV critical surface consists of all those trajectories which are safe from UV divergences in the sense that all couplings approach finite fixed point values as &lt;math&gt;k\rightarrow\infty&lt;/math&gt;. The key hypothesis underlying asymptotic safety is that only trajectories running entirely within the UV critical surface of an appropriate fixed point can be infinitely extended and thus define a fundamental quantum field theory. It is obvious that such trajectories are well-behaved in the UV limit as the existence of a fixed point allows them to "stay at a point" for an infinitely long RG "time".

With regard to the fixed point, UV-attractive directions are called relevant, UV-repulsive ones irrelevant, since the corresponding scaling fields increase and decrease, respectively, when the scale is lowered. Therefore, the dimensionality of the UV critical surface equals the number of relevant couplings. An asymptotically safe theory is thus the more predictive the smaller is the dimensionality of the corresponding UV critical surface.

For instance, if the UV critical surface has the finite dimension &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; it is sufficient to perform only &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; measurements in order to uniquely identify Nature's RG trajectory. Once the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; relevant couplings are measured, the requirement of asymptotic safety fixes all other couplings since the latter have to be adjusted in such a way that the RG trajectory lies within the UV critical surface. In this spirit the theory is highly predictive as infinitely many parameters are fixed by a finite number of measurements.

In contrast to other approaches, a bare action which should be promoted to a quantum theory is not needed as an input here. It is the theory space and the RG flow equations that determine possible UV fixed points. Since such a fixed point, in turn, corresponds to a bare action, one can consider the bare action a prediction in the asymptotic safety program. This may be thought of as a systematic search strategy among theories that are already "quantum" which identifies the "islands" of physically acceptable theories in the "sea" of unacceptable ones plagued by short distance singularities.

=== Gaussian and non-Gaussian fixed points ===

A fixed point is called ''Gaussian'' if it corresponds to a free theory. Its [[critical exponents]] agree with the [[classical scaling dimension|canonical mass dimensions]] of the corresponding operators which usually amounts to the trivial fixed point values &lt;math&gt;g_\alpha^* = 0&lt;/math&gt; for all essential couplings &lt;math&gt;g_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Thus standard perturbation theory is applicable only in the vicinity of a Gaussian fixed point. In this regard asymptotic safety at the Gaussian fixed point is equivalent to perturbative renormalizability plus [[asymptotic freedom]]. Due to the arguments presented in the introductory sections, however, this possibility is ruled out for gravity.

In contrast, a nontrivial fixed point, that is, a fixed point whose critical exponents differ from the canonical ones, is referred to as ''non-Gaussian''. Usually this requires &lt;math&gt;g_\alpha^* \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for at least one essential &lt;math&gt;g_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. It is such a non-Gaussian fixed point that provides a possible scenario for quantum gravity. As yet, studies on this subject thus mainly focused on establishing its existence.

=== Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) ===

Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) is the generic name for any quantum field theory of gravity that (regardless of its [[Action (physics)|bare action]]) takes the [[metric tensor|spacetime metric]] as the dynamical field variable and whose symmetry is given by [[diffeomorphism invariance]]. This fixes the [[#Theory_space|theory space]] and an RG flow of the effective average action defined over it, but it does not single out a priori any specific action functional. However, the flow equation determines a vector field on that theory space which can be investigated. If it displays a non-Gaussian fixed point by means of which the UV limit can be taken in the "asymptotically safe" way, this point acquires the status of the bare action.

== Implementation via the effective average action ==

=== Exact functional renormalization group equation ===

{{Main article|Functional renormalization group}}
The primary tool for investigating the gravitational [[renormalization group|RG]] flow with respect to the energy scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; at the nonperturbative level is the effective average action &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k &lt;/math&gt; for gravity.&lt;ref name="MR1"/&gt; It is the scale dependent version of the [[effective action]] where in the underlying [[Functional integration|functional integral]] field modes with covariant [[momenta]] below &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; are suppressed while only the remaining are integrated out. For a given theory space, let &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of dynamical and background fields, respectively. Then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k &lt;/math&gt; satisfies the following [[Functional renormalization group|Wetterich-Morris-type functional RG equation]] (FRGE):&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
k \partial_k \Gamma_k\big[\Phi, \bar{\Phi}\big] = \frac{1}{2}\,\mbox{STr}\Big[\big(\Gamma_k^{(2)}\big[\Phi, \bar{\Phi}\big] + \mathcal{R}_k[\bar{\Phi}]\big)^{-1} k \partial_k \mathcal{R}_k[\bar{\Phi}] \Big] .
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k^{(2)} &lt;/math&gt; is the second [[functional derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the quantum fields  &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; at fixed &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt;. The mode suppression operator &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}_k[\bar{\Phi}]&lt;/math&gt; provides a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-dependent mass-term for fluctuations with covariant momenta &lt;math&gt;p^2 \ll k^2&lt;/math&gt; and vanishes for &lt;math&gt;p^2 \gg k^2&lt;/math&gt;.
Its appearance in the numerator and denominator renders the [[supertrace]] &lt;math&gt;(\mbox{STr})&lt;/math&gt; both infrared and UV finite, peaking at momenta &lt;math&gt;p^2 \approx k^2&lt;/math&gt;. The FRGE is an exact equation without any perturbative approximations. Given an initial condition it determines &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; for all scales uniquely.

The solutions &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; of the FRGE interpolate between the bare (microscopic) action at &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; and the [[effective action]] &lt;math&gt;\Gamma[\Phi] = \Gamma_{k=0}\big[\Phi, \bar{\Phi}=\Phi\big] &lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow 0&lt;/math&gt;. They can be visualized as trajectories in the underlying [[#Theory_space|theory space]]. Note that the FRGE itself is independent of the bare action. In the case of an asymptotically safe theory, the bare action is determined by the fixed point functional &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_* = \Gamma_{k\rightarrow\infty}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Truncations of the theory space ===

Let us assume there is a set of basis functionals &lt;math&gt;\{P_\alpha[\,\cdot\,]\}&lt;/math&gt; spanning the [[#Theory_space|theory space]] under consideration so that any action functional, i.e. any point of this theory space, can be written as a linear combination of the &lt;math&gt;P_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;'s. Then solutions &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; of the [[#Exact_functional_renormalization_group_equation|FRGE]] have expansions of the form

:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma_k[\Phi,\bar{\Phi}] = \sum\limits_{\alpha=1}^{\infty} g_\alpha(k) P_\alpha[\Phi,\bar{\Phi}] .
&lt;/math&gt;

Inserting this expansion into the FRGE and expanding the trace on its right-hand side in order to extract the [[Beta function (physics)|beta-functions]], one obtains the exact RG equation in component form: &lt;math&gt;k \partial_k g_\alpha(k) = \beta_\alpha(g_1,g_2,\cdots)&lt;/math&gt;. Together with the corresponding initial conditions these equations fix the evolution of the running couplings &lt;math&gt;g_\alpha(k)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus determine &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k&lt;/math&gt; completely. As one can see, the FRGE gives rise to a system of ''infinitely many'' coupled differential equations since there are infinitely many couplings, and the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions can depend on all of them. This makes it very hard to solve the system in general.

A possible way out is to restrict the analysis on a finite-dimensional subspace as an approximation of the full theory space. In other words, such a ''truncation of the theory space'' sets all but a finite number of couplings to zero, considering only the reduced basis &lt;math&gt;\{P_\alpha[\,\cdot\,]\}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\alpha=1,\cdots,N&lt;/math&gt;. This amounts to the ansatz

:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma_k[\Phi,\bar{\Phi}] = \sum\limits_{\alpha=1}^N g_\alpha(k) P_\alpha[\Phi,\bar{\Phi}] ,
&lt;/math&gt;

leading to a system of finitely many coupled differential equations, &lt;math&gt;k\partial_k g_\alpha(k) = \beta_\alpha(g_1,\cdots,g_N)&lt;/math&gt;, which can now be solved employing analytical or numerical techniques.

Clearly a truncation should be chosen such that it incorporates as many features of the exact flow as possible. Although it is an approximation, the truncated flow still exhibits the nonperturbative character of the FRGE, and the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions can contain contributions from all powers of the couplings.

=== The Einstein–Hilbert truncation ===

As described in the previous section, the [[#Exact_functional_renormalization_group_equation|FRGE]] lends itself to a systematic construction of nonperturbative approximations to the gravitational [[beta function (physics)|beta-functions]] by projecting the exact RG flow onto subspaces spanned by a suitable ansatz for &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k &lt;/math&gt;. In its simplest form, such an ansatz is given by the Einstein–Hilbert action where [[gravitational constant|Newton's constant]] &lt;math&gt;G_k&lt;/math&gt; and the [[cosmological constant]] &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_k&lt;/math&gt; depend on the RG scale &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{g}_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; denote the dynamical and the background metric, respectively. Then &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k &lt;/math&gt; reads, for arbitrary spacetime dimension &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
\Gamma_k[g,\bar{g},\xi,\bar{\xi}] = \frac{1}{16\pi G_k} \int\text{d}^d x\, \sqrt{g}\, \big( -R(g) + 2\Lambda_k \big) + \Gamma_k^\text{gf}[g,\bar{g}] + \Gamma_k^\text{gh}[g,\bar{g},\xi,\bar{\xi}] .
&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;R(g)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[scalar curvature]] constructed from the metric &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k^\text{gf}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[gauge fixing|gauge fixing action]], and &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_k^\text{gh}&lt;/math&gt; the [[Faddeev–Popov ghost|ghost action]] with the ghost fields &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{\xi}&lt;/math&gt;.

The corresponding &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions, describing the evolution of the dimensionless Newton constant &lt;math&gt;g_k=k^{d-2} G_k&lt;/math&gt; and the dimensionless cosmological constant &lt;math&gt;\lambda_k=k^{-2}\Lambda_k&lt;/math&gt;, have been derived for the first time in reference&lt;ref name="MR1" /&gt; for any value of the spacetime dimensionality, including the cases of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; below and above &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; dimensions. In particular, in &lt;math&gt;d=4&lt;/math&gt; dimensions they give rise to the RG flow diagram shown on the left-hand side. The most important result is the existence of a non-Gaussian fixed point suitable for asymptotic safety. It is UV-attractive both in &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;- and in &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-direction.

This fixed point is related to the [[#History_of_asymptotic_safety|one]] found in &lt;math&gt;d=2 + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; dimensions by perturbative methods in the sense that it is recovered in the nonperturbative approach presented here by inserting &lt;math&gt;d=2 + \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; into the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions and expanding in powers of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="MR1" /&gt; Since the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;-functions were shown to exist and explicitly computed for any real, i.e., not necessarily integer value of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, no analytic continuation is involved here. The fixed point in &lt;math&gt;d=4&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, too, is a direct result of the nonperturbative flow equations, and, in contrast to the earlier attempts, no extrapolation in &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is required.

=== Extended truncations ===

Subsequently, the existence of the fixed point found within the Einstein–Hilbert truncation has been confirmed in subspaces of successively increasing complexity. The next step in this development was the inclusion of an &lt;math&gt;R^2&lt;/math&gt;-term in the truncation ansatz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauscher|first=Oliver|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Flow equation of quantum Einstein gravity in a higher-derivative truncation|journal=Physical Review D|year=2002|volume=66|issue=2|pages=025026|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.66.025026|arxiv=hep-th/0205062|bibcode = 2002PhRvD..66b5026L }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This has been extended further by taking into account polynomials of the scalar curvature &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; (so-called &lt;math&gt;f(R)&lt;/math&gt;-truncations),&lt;ref name="fRgravity"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Codello|first=Alessandro|author2=Percacci, Roberto|author3= Rahmede, Christoph|title=Ultraviolet properties of f(R)-gravity|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics A|year=2008|volume=23|issue=1|pages=143–150|doi=10.1142/S0217751X08038135|arxiv=0705.1769|bibcode = 2008IJMPA..23..143C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and the square of the [[Weyl tensor|Weyl curvature tensor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benedetti|first=Dario|author2=Machado, Pedro F.|author3= Saueressig, Frank|title=Asymptotic safety in higher-derivative gravity|journal=Modern Physics Letters A|year=2009|volume=24|issue=28|pages=2233–2241|doi=10.1142/S0217732309031521|arxiv=0901.2984|bibcode = 2009MPLA...24.2233B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The contact to perturbation theory is established in: {{cite journal|last=Niedermaier|first=Max|title=Gravitational Fixed Points from Perturbation Theory|journal=Physical Review Letters|year=2009|volume=103|issue=10|pages=101303|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.101303|bibcode = 2009PhRvL.103j1303N|pmid=19792294}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, the impact of various kinds of matter fields has been investigated.&lt;ref name="DouPercacci" /&gt;
Also computations based on a field reparametrization invariant effective average action seem to recover the crucial fixed point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Donkin|first=Ivan|author2=Pawlowski, Jan M.|title=The phase diagram of quantum gravity from diffeomorphism-invariant RG-flows|year=2012|eprint=1203.4207|&lt;!--bibcode = 2012arXiv1203.4207D--&gt; |class=hep-th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In combination these results constitute strong evidence that gravity in four dimensions is a nonperturbatively renormalizable quantum field theory, indeed with a [[#Asymptotic safety: The main idea|UV critical surface]] of reduced dimensionality, coordinatized by only a few relevant couplings.&lt;ref name="reviews" /&gt;

== The microscopic structure of spacetime ==

Results of asymptotic safety related investigations indicate that the effective [[spacetime]]s of [[#Quantum_Einstein_Gravity_(QEG)|QEG]] have [[fractal]]-like properties on microscopic scales. It is possible to determine, for instance, their spectral dimension and argue that they undergo a dimensional reduction from 4 dimensions at [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic distances]] to 2 dimensions microscopically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauscher|first=Oliver|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Ultraviolet fixed point and generalized flow equation of quantum gravity|journal=Physical Review D|year=2001|volume=65|issue=2|pages=025013|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.65.025013|arxiv=hep-th/0108040|bibcode = 2002PhRvD..65b5013L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauscher|first=Oliver|author2=Reuter, Martin|title=Fractal spacetime structure in asymptotically safe gravity|journal=Journal of High Energy Physics|year=2005|volume=10|issue=10|pages=050|doi=10.1088/1126-6708/2005/10/050|arxiv=hep-th/0508202|bibcode = 2005JHEP...10..050L }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this context it might be possible to draw the connection to other approaches to quantum gravity, e.g. to [[causal dynamical triangulation]]s, and compare the results.&lt;ref&gt;For a review see [[#Further_reading|Further reading]]: Reuter; Saueressig (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physics applications of asymptotically safe gravity ==

{{Main article|Physics applications of asymptotically safe gravity}}

Phenomenological consequences of the asymptotic safety scenario have been investigated in many areas of gravitational physics. As an example, asymptotic safety in combination with the [[Standard Model]] allows a statement about the mass of the [[Higgs boson]] and the value of the [[fine structure constant]].&lt;ref name="appl"&gt;See main article [[Physics applications of asymptotically safe gravity]] and references therein.&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, it provides possible explanations for particular phenomena in [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]] and [[astrophysics]], concerning [[black holes]] or [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]], for instance.&lt;ref name="appl" /&gt; These different studies take advantage of the possibility that the requirement of asymptotic safety can give rise to new predictions and conclusions for the models considered, often without depending on additional, possibly unobserved, assumptions.

[[File:Otto Bettman cph.3f05867.jpg|thumb|[[Otto Bettmann]], founder of the Bettmann Archive (1947)]]

The '''Bettmann Archive''' is a collection of 19 million photographs and images, some going back to the United States [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and including some of the best known U.S. historic images.  The Archive also includes many images from Europe and elsewhere.  

It was founded in 1936 by [[Otto Bettmann]] (1903&amp;ndash;1998), a [[Germany|German]] [[curator]] who immigrated to the United States in 1935. He actively expanded his collection by adsvertising in magazines. e.g. in the Winter 1959 issue of [[Film Quarterly]] "Wanting to buy: Old movie stills - ca. 1915 to 1935; early comedies -- well-known stars and productions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date =  Winter 1959 | title = Film Quarterly | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Bettmann moved it from his apartment at 215 East 57th Street, in [[New York City]] to the [[666 Fifth Avenue|Tishman Building]]. In 1981, Bettmann sold the archive to the [[Kraus Thomson Organization]].

In 1995, the archive was sold to [[Branded Entertainment Network|Corbis]], a digital [[stock photography]] company founded by [[Bill Gates]].  Restrictions of access to the collection 
arising from this sale were described in the editorial "Goodbye to All That" in the May 2001 issue of [[American Heritage (magazine)|''American Heritage'' magazine]].&lt;ref name="ah-goodbye"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.americanheritage.com/content/goodbye-all | title = Goodbye To All That | first = Richard F. | last = Snow | page = 5 | work = [[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]] |date=May 2001 | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | publisher = American Heritage Publishing Company | location = New York City }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between late-2001 and March 2002, to preserve the photos and negatives, Corbis moved the archive from Manhattan to the [[Iron Mountain Incorporated|Iron Mountain]] [[National Underground Storage Facility]], a former [[limestone]] quarry located 220 feet (67 m) below ground in western [[Pennsylvania]]. The temperature of the storage room is gradually being lowered to -4 °F (-20 °C), which was determined by film preservationist Harry Wilhelm to be the optimal temperature for the long-term storage of the archive.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Weinberger|Weinberger, David]]. 2007. ''[[Everything is Miscellaneous: The Power of the New Digital Disorder]]''. New York: Henry Holt and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; At this temperature, the collection will degrade 500 times more slowly in than it did in Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm, Henry et al.

The archive began with Otto Bettmann's personal collection of 15,000 images which he brought with him in suitcases when he escaped from Nazi Germany.&lt;ref name="ah-goodbye"/&gt;  Over the years, it acquired other collections, including the Gendreau Collection of Americana in 1967, the [[Underwood &amp; Underwood]] Collection of material from late 19th century to World War I in 1971, and the [[United Press International]] collection in 1984.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10037">The '''Bliss bibliographic classification''' ('''BC''') is a [[library classification]] system that was created by [[Henry E. Bliss]] (1870–1955) and published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953. Although originally devised in the [[United States]], it was more commonly adopted by [[United Kingdom|British]] libraries.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;List of libraries using Bliss Classification. http://www.blissclassification.org.uk/bclink.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; A second edition of the system (BC2) has been in ongoing development in Britain since 1977.

==Origins of the system==
Henry E. Bliss began working on the Bliss Classification system while working at the [[City College of New York|City College of New York Library]] as Assistant Librarian.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was a critic of [[Melvil Dewey]]'s work with the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey Decimal System]] and believed that organization of titles needed to be done with an intellectual mind frame. Being overly pragmatic or simply alphabetical, would be inadequate. In fact, Bliss is the only theorist who created an organizational scheme based on societal needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Broughton|first=Vanda|date=2008|title=Henry Evelyn Bliss – the other immortal, or a prophet without honour?|url=|journal=Journal of Librarianship and Information Science|doi=10.1177/0961000607086620|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bliss wanted a classification system that would provide distinct rules yet still be adaptable to whatever kind of collection a library might have, as different libraries have different needs. His solution was the concept of "alternative location," in which a particular subject could be put in more than one place, as long as the library made a specific choice and used it consistently.

Bliss discusses his theories and basis of organization for the Bliss Classification for the first time in his 1910 article, "A Modern Classification for Libraries, with Simple Notation, Mnemonics, and Alternatives".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bliss|first=Henry E.|date=August 1910|title=A Modern Classification for Libraries, with Simple Notation, Mnemonics, and Alternatives|url=|journal=Library Journal|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication followed his 1908 reclassification of the City College collection. His work, ''Organization of Knowledge and the System of the Sciences'' was published in four volumes between 1940 and 1953.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blissclassification.org.uk/bchist.shtml|title=Bliss Classification Association : BC2 : History &amp; description|website=www.blissclassification.org.uk|access-date=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four broad underlying policies of the BC system are:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* alternative location 
* brief, concise notation 
* organizing knowledge according to academic expertise 
* subjects moving gradually from topic to topic as they naturally related to one another.
Bliss deliberately avoided the use of the [[decimal separator|decimal point]] because of his objection to Dewey's system. Instead he used capital and lower-case letters, numerals, and every typographical symbol available on his extensive and somewhat eccentric [[typewriter]].

==Adoption and change to BC2==
In 1967 the Bliss Classification Association was formed. Its first publication was the Abridged Bliss Classification (ABC), intended for school libraries. In 1977 it began to publish and maintain a revised version of Bliss's system, the Bliss Bibliographic Classification (Second Edition) or BC2. This retains only the broad outlines of Bliss's scheme, replacing most of the detailed notation with a new scheme based on the principles of [[faceted classification]]. 15 of approximately 28 volumes of schedules have so far been published. A revision of this nature has been considered by some to be a completely new system.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The City College library continued to use Bliss's system until 1967, when it switched to the [[Library of Congress]] system. It had become too expensive to train new staff members to use BC, and too expensive to maintain in general. Much of the Bliss stacks remain, however, as no-one has re-cataloged the books.

The case was different, however, in Britain. BC proved more popular there and also spread to other English-speaking countries. Part of the reason for its success was that libraries in teachers’ colleges liked the way Bliss had organized the subject areas on teaching and education. By the mid-1950s the system was being used in at least sixty British libraries and in a hundred by the 1970s The Bliss Classification system has been found to be successful in academic, specialty, government, and law libraries. It has also found success in libraries outside of the United States of America, as many of these libraries do not have a history of using either the Dewey Decimal, or the Library of Congress classification system.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

"'''Christmas Bells'''" is an American television commercial produced by [[the Hershey Company]] promoting [[Hershey's Kisses]]. The advertisement, produced with [[stop-motion animation]], features Hershey's Kisses, fashioned as a [[handbell choir]], playing the Christmas [[Carol (music)|carol]] "[[We Wish You a Merry Christmas]]". It debuted in 1989 and is shown in the United States each holiday season; as such, it is the longest-running television commercial for the Hershey brand.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

==Background==
In 1989, the Hershey Company began an advertising campaign for their product Hershey's Kisses, which was referred to as the "whimsy" campaign. [[Ogilvy &amp; Mather]] was the advertising agency behind the spot and David Apicella served as Creative Director. Television advertisements would utilize "tabletop stop-motion animation and CG product photography." [[Colossal Pictures]] was the animation studio, located in [[San Francisco]], who produced the commercial. Carl Willat directed the spots and performed the stop-motion animation with Gordon Clark. John Dunn, Hershey's brands manager, oversaw the production and helped develop the last-minute idea to create the "Christmas Bells" advertisement.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ringing in the Holidays: Hershey’s Kisses Chocolates
|url=http://blog.hersheyarchives.org/tag/tv-commercial/|website=[[The Hershey Company|HersheyArchives.com]]|date=January 18, 2011|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leah Longan, former marketing director for Hershey, told ''[[the New York Times]]'' in 1994 they continued to run the advertisement because they "don't wear out like normal commercials," as they are only shown seasonally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/09/business/the-media-business-advertising-perennial-holiday-messages-work.html|title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising; Perennial Holiday Messages Work|author=Stuart Elliot|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 9, 1994|accessdate=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
The '''''Chronicon Aquitanicum''''' is a set of [[annals]] covering the years 830 to 930 with several gaps and an added notice on the year 1025. It is found in the "great encyclopedia codex",&lt;ref&gt;Landes (1995), 123, calls it this and also "great science codex" on account of its variety of texts on history, computus, astronomy and arithmetic.&lt;/ref&gt; BN lat. 5239, of the [[Abbey of Saint Martial, Limoges|Abbey of Saint Martial]] at [[Limoges]].&lt;ref&gt;"BN lat. 5239" is the shelf mark, indicating it is among the [[Latin language|Latin]] manuscripts in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. The ''Chronicon'' occupies [[folio]] 21, both [[recto and verso]].&lt;/ref&gt; Its entries are annotations on an [[Easter cycle]].

The ''Chronicon'' was first published by [[Philippe Labbe]] in 1653.&lt;ref&gt;''Nova bibliotheca manuscriptorum librorum'' (Paris, 1653), vol. 1, p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt; It was next published in 1717 by [[Edmond Martène]] and [[Ursin Durand]] under the title ''Breve chronicon Normannicum sive Britannicum'' ("Short Chronicle of the Northmen, or Britons").&lt;ref&gt;''Thesaurus novus anecdotorum'' (Paris, 1717), vol. 3, p. 1448.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georg Pertz]] edited it for a third time for the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'' in 1829, using the title by which it is most commonly known.&lt;ref&gt;"Chronicon Aquitanicum", MGH, Scriptores, vol. 2, pp. 252–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Chronicon'' draws on the ''[[Annales Engolismenses]]'' for much of its information. Both sets of annals were used by [[Adhemar of Chabannes]] in composing his ''Historiae''. In 1025, while copying from BN lat. 5239, he added [[Marginalia|marginal notes]] of his own to the codex.&lt;ref&gt;Landes (1995), 123.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Limoges in 1026/7 to add a notice for the year 1025 to the ''Chronicon'', recording the deaths of Emperors [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] (who actually died in 1024) and [[Basil II]].&lt;ref&gt;Adhemar's notice reads: "''Eodem anno Eenricus imperator obiit, et Cono imperium suscepit. Eodem anno Basilius imperator Graecorum obiit, et Constantius frater eius imperium suscepit''" (That same year, Henry the emperor died, and Conon [Conrad] took up the imperium [empire]. That same year, Basil, the emperor of the Greeks died, and Constantine, his brother, took up the imperium [empire]). The translation is from Landes (1995), 164.&lt;/ref&gt; His notice appears right beneath another already added by another scribe, recording the death of the Viscount Guy of Limoges on 27 October of that year and his burial at Saint Martial's. The notice for 1025 is the only one added after the annals were compiled late in the tenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Landes (1995), 139.&lt;/ref&gt; The "false precision" of Adhemar's annal—Henry did not die in the same twelve-month period as Basil, nor did Conrad immediately succeed him—indicates a "sense of global drama and continuity" characteristic of the "excited optimism that reigned at Limoges".&lt;ref&gt;Landes (1995), 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cubi XII''''' is an abstract sculpture by [[David Smith (sculptor)| David Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!6410~!0#focus "Cubi XII, (sculpture)"], ''SIRIS''&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructed of stainless steel, completed on April 7 1963, it was purchased from his estate by the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hirshhorn.si.edu/visit/collection_object.asp?key=32&amp;subkey=12663 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091015214655/http://www.hirshhorn.si.edu/visit/collection_object.asp?key=32&amp;subkey=12663 |archivedate=2009-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hirshhorn.si.edu/search.asp?tags=scrabbil |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091015214718/http://www.hirshhorn.si.edu/search.asp?tags=scrabbil |archivedate=2009-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfact.com/auction-lot/david-smith-1906-1965-1-c-y45ubhprib&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a part of the [[Cubi]] series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.knowitall.org/artopia/sculpture/artcritic/text/text.cfm?artWorkID=49&lt;/ref&gt;
He used the shiny finish to contrast with the landscape. The circular grind marks change in varying lighting conditions.&lt;ref&gt;''A Garden for Art'', Valerie J. Fletcher, LOC # 97-61991, p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dirty War''' ({{lang-es|guerra sucia}}) is the name used by the [[military junta]] or '''civic-military dictatorship of Argentina''' ({{lang-es|dictadura cívico-militar de Argentina|links=no}}) for the period of [[state terrorism]] in [[Argentina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuestrasvoces.com.ar/a-vos-te-creo/guerra-sucia-la-importancia-las-palabras|title="Guerra sucia": la importancia de las palabras|trans-title="Dirty war": the importance of the words|author=Daniel Feierstein|language=es&lt;!--|date=May 1977--&gt;|date=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McSherry|first1=Patrice|title=Predatory States: Operation Condor and Covert War in Latin America|date=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=0742536874|page=78|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Predatory_states.html?id=2eFHAAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As can be seen from the archives declassified by the United States, the number of trials opened in the Southern Cone, the discovery of the Archives of the horror of Paraguay (1992), the appearance of the book ''The Trial of Henry Kissinger'' by British journalist and researcher Christopher Hitchens, as revealing as other books and documents accumulated in recent times on the role of the former Secretary of State of two governments of his country, those of the Republicans Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford: "Kissinger and his team devised the project to assassinate Chilean General René Schneider, who was not only a leader of the Chilean Armed Forces but who had not accepted the coup d'état", Hitchens says in an interview with the correspondent from newspaper ''Página 12'' in Paris. He adds: "It is an absolute atrocity and we have all the details of the attack planned by Kissinger and that cost Schneider his life". It must be said that it is an atrocity against Chilean democracy. that the Chileans chose their president".&lt;/ref&gt; from 1974 to 1983 as a part of [[Operation Condor]], during which military and security forces and [[right-wing]] [[death squads]] in the form of the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] (AAA, or Triple A)&lt;ref&gt;Right-wing violence was also on the rise, and an array of death squads was formed from armed sections of the large labor unions, parapolice organizations within the federal and provincial police; and the AAA (Alianza Anticomunista Argentina), founded by Perón's secretary of social welfare, López Rega, with the participation of the federal police.

About 30,000 people disappeared, many of whom were impossible to formally report due to the nature of state terrorism. The justification for the Dirty War was the armed actions of the Montoneros and the ERP. From 1969 to 1979, there were 239 kidnappings and 1,020 murders by the guerrillas.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Therefore, the targets were students, militants, trade unionists, writers, journalists, artists and anyone suspected to be a [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[Activism|activist]], included [[Peronism|Peronist]] [[guerrilla]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aliciapatterson.org/stories/argentinas-dirty-war|title=Argentina's Dirty War - Alicia Patterson Foundation|work=aliciapatterson.org|accessdate=16 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129015852/http://aliciapatterson.org/stories/argentinas-dirty-war|archive-date=29 January 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "disappeared" (victims kidnapped, tortured and murdered whose bodies were disappeared by the military government) included those thought to be politically or ideologically a threat to the military junta even vaguely, or contrary to the plan of [[neoliberal]] economic policies dictated by [[Operation Condor]].&lt;ref name="clarin.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Argentina, p. 145" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marguerite Guzmán Bouvard p. 22"/&gt; They were killed in an attempt by the junta to silence the social and political opposition.&lt;ref name="Robben"&gt;{{cite news|last=Robben|first=Antonius C.

== Overview ==
{{History of Argentina}}
In the decades before the [[1976 Argentine coup d'état|1976 coup]], the Argentinian military, supported by the Argentine establishment,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-192375-2012-04-21.html&lt;/ref&gt; opposed [[Juan Perón|Juan Domingo Perón]]'s populist government and [[List of coups d'état and coup attempts by country#Argentina|attempted a coup in 1951 and two in 1955]] before succeeding with the self-proclaimed ''[[Ley de Punto Final|Revolución Libertadora]]'' (Liberating Revolution). After taking control, the armed forces proscribed [[Peronism]], a decision that triggered the organization of Peronist resistance in workplaces and trade unions, as the working classes sought to protect the economic and social improvements obtained under Perón's rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/nuevajotape/4161.doc&amp;date=2009-10-25+23:51:07 WebCite query result&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the coup, Peronist resistance began organizing in workplaces and trade unions as the working classes sought economic and social improvements. Over time, as democratic rule was partially restored, but promises of legalizing the expression and political liberties for Peronism were not respected, guerrilla groups began to operate in the 1960s, namely ''Uturuncos&lt;ref&gt;Salas, Ernesto, ''Uturuncos. El origen de la guerrilla peronista'', Biblos, Buenos Aires, 2003, {{ISBN|950-786-386-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' and the ''EGP'' (People's Guerrilla Army). Both were small and quickly defeated.

As Perón returned from exile in 1973, the [[1973 Ezeiza massacre|Ezeiza massacre]] marked the end of the alliance between left- and right-wing factions of Peronism. In 1974, Perón withdrew his support for the [[Montoneros]] shortly before his death. During the presidency of his widow [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel]], the far-right paramilitary [[death squad]] [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] (AAA, or Triple A) emerged. In 1975, Isabel signed a number of decrees empowering the military and the police to "annihilate" left-wing activists. In 1976, her government was overthrown as a part of [[Operation Condor]] by a military coup led by General [[Jorge Rafael Videla]].

The junta, calling itself the [[National Reorganization Process]], organized and carried out strong repression of political dissidents (or perceived as such) through the government's military and security forces. They were responsible for the arrest, torture, killings and/or forced disappearances of an estimated 30,000 people. The junta would dictate Argentina's future.  With the help of Washington, the junta was aided with $50 million in military aid. Another group in the far right that was responsible for the death of many was, Alianza Anticomunista Argentina other wise known as Triple A. Triple A was ruled under Jose Lopez Rega, the Minister of Social Welfare who used Triple A as a death squad regime. Both the junta and Triple A targeted young professionals, high school and college students and trade union members. These groups of people became main targets because of their involvement in political organizations that exploited the work of the right-wing group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meade |first1=Teresa |title=A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present |date=December 21, 2009 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |edition= Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assassination occurred domestically in Argentina via mass shootings and the throwing of live citizens from airplanes to death in the South Atlantic. Additionally, 12,000 prisoners, many of whom had not been convicted through legal processes, were detained in a network of 340 secret concentration camps located throughout Argentina. Triple A partnered with the army, navy and the air force to terrorize the population. Navy captains such as [[Adolfo Scilingo]] performed massive number of executions. These actions against victims called ''desaparecidos'' because they simply "disappeared" without explanation were confirmed via Scilingo, who has publicly confessed his participation in the Dirty War, stating that the Argentinian military "did worse things than the Nazis".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.clarin.com/politica/piden-gobierno-proteja-familiares-scilingo_0_rJ7dDeWAtx.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the National commission on Disappeared People forced Scilingo to testify where he described how "prisoners were drugged, loaded onto military planes, and thrown, naked and semi-conscious, into the Atlantic Ocean". A vast majority of those who were killed left with no trace or record of their disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meade |first1=Teresa |title=A History of Modern Latin America: 1800 to the Present |date=December 21, 2009 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |edition= Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The junta referred to their policy of suppressing opponents as the [[National Reorganization Process]] (''Proceso de Reorganización Nacional''). Argentine military and security forces also created paramilitary death squads, operating behind "fronts" as supposedly independent units. Argentina coordinated actions with other South American dictatorships as in [[Operation Condor]]. Faced with increasing public opposition and severe economic problems, the military tried to regain popularity by occupying the disputed [[Falkland Islands]]. During the resulting [[Falklands War]], the military government lost any remaining favour after its defeat by Britain, forcing it to step aside in disgrace and allow for free elections to be held in late 1983.

=== Restoration of democracy and trial of the juntas ===
The [[Raúl Alfonsín|democratic government of Raúl Alfonsín]] was elected to office in 1983. Alfonsín organized the [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] (''Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas'', CONADEP) to investigate crimes committed during the Dirty War, and heard testimony from hundreds of witnesses and began to develop cases against offenders. The commission organized a tribunal to conduct a transparent prosecution of offenders, holding the [[Trial of the Juntas]] in 1985. Among the nearly 300 people prosecuted, many of the leading officers were charged, convicted and sentenced for their crimes.

The Argentinan armed forces opposed subjecting more of its personnel to the trials, threatening the civilian leadership with another coup.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} In 1986, the military forced the passage of the ''[[Ley de Punto Final]]'' (Full Stop Law) in 1986, which "put a line" under previous actions and ended prosecutions for crimes committed by the National Reorganization Process. Fearing military uprisings, Argentina's first two Presidents sentenced only the two top Dirty War former commanders. The Punto Final Law stated that military personnel involved in torture were doing their "jobs". In 1994, President [[Carlos Menem]] praised the military in their "fight against subversion".&lt;ref&gt;''Argentine Economy,'' Issue 33, p. 27, Consejo Técnico de Inversiones S.A., 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Repeal of laws ===
In 2003, Congress repealed the Pardon Laws, and in 2005 the Argentine Supreme Court ruled they were unconstitutional. Under the presidency of [[Nestor Kirchner]], the Argentine government re-opened its investigations on [[crimes against humanity]] and [[genocide]] in 2006 and began the prosecution of military and security officers.&lt;ref name="genocidio"&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/841762 Condenaron a Etchecolatz a reclusión perpetua], ''La Nación'' (19 September 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the term ==
The term "Dirty War" was used by the military junta, which claimed that a war, albeit with "different" methods (including the large-scale application of [[torture]] and [[rape]]), was necessary to maintain social order and eradicate political subversives. This explanation has been questioned in court by human rights NGOs, as it suggests that a "civil war" was going on and implies justification for the killings. During the 1985 Trial of the Juntas, public prosecutor Julio Strassera suggested that the term "Dirty War" was a "euphemism to try to conceal gang activities" as though they were legitimate military activities.&lt;ref name="Strassera"&gt;[http://www.nuncamas.org/juicios/juntas/acusa.htm "Julio Strassera's prosecution"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070116215845/http://www.nuncamas.org/juicios/juntas/acusa.htm|date=16 January 2007}} 1985 [[Trial of the Juntas]] (''Juicio a las Juntas Militares'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.com/nota/285046/abuelas-elogio-la-decision-de-obama-de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329145612/http://www.infonews.com/nota/285046/abuelas-elogio-la-decision-de-obama-de|deadurl=yes|archivedate=29 March 2016|title=Abuelas elogió la decisión de Obama de desclasificar archivos de la dictadura y deslizó algunas críticas - Política - INFOnews|date=29 March 2016|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the junta said its objective was to eradicate guerrilla activity because of its threat to the state, it conducted wide-scale repression of the general population, it worked against all [[Opposition (politics)|political opposition]] and those it considered on the left: trade unionists (half of the victims), students, intellectuals including journalists and writers, rights activists and other civilians and their families. Many others went into exile to survive and many remain in exile today despite the return of democracy in 1983. During the Trial of the Juntas, the prosecution established that the guerrillas were never substantial enough to pose a real threat to the state and could not be considered a [[belligerent]] as in a war:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The guerrilla had not taken control of any part of the national territory; they had not obtained recognition of interior or anterior belligerency, they were not massively supported by any foreign power, and they lacked the population's support.&lt;ref name="El Estado de necesidad"&gt;[http://www.desaparecidos.org/arg/doc/secretos/conde.html "El Estado de necesidad"]; Documents of the Trial of the Juntas at Desaparecidos.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The program of extermination of dissidents was referred to as genocide by a court of law for the first time during the trial of Miguel Etchecolatz, a former senior official of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police.&lt;ref name="genocidio"/&gt;

Crimes committed during this time ([[genocide]] of civilian population and other [[crimes against humanity]]) are not covered under the [[laws of war]] (''[[jus in bello]]''), which shields [[Enlisted rank|enlisted personnel]] from prosecution for acts committed under orders given by a superior officer or the state. [[Estela de Carlotto]], president of the Argentine human rights non-governmental organization [[Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[That term] is a way to minimize state terrorism and is a term born outside the country. It is a totally wrong concept; there was no war, dirty nor clean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.com/nota/285046/abuelas-elogio-la-decision-de-obama-de|title=Abuelas elogió la decisión de Obama de desclasificar archivos de la dictadura y deslizó algunas críticas - Política - INFOnews|date=29 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329145612/http://www.infonews.com/nota/285046/abuelas-elogio-la-decision-de-obama-de|archivedate=29 March 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minutouno.com/notas/1503137-carlotto-salio-al-cruce-macri-la-dictadura-no-fue-una-guerra-sucia-ni-limpia-fue-terrorismo-estado|title=No fue una guerra sucia ni limpia, fue terrorismo de Estado|date=29 March 2016|work=minutouno.com|trans-title=It was no war, nor dirty, nor clean, but state terrorism|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Return of Peronism ==
Since former army officer [[Juan Perón]] was ousted from the [[president of Argentina|presidency]] by a coup in 1955 (''[[Revolución Libertadora]]''), military hostility to [[Peronism]] and populist politics dominated Argentine politics. The 1963 [[Pedro Eugenio Aramburu|Aramburu decree]] prohibited the use of Perón's name and when [[Alejandro Agustín Lanusse|General Lanusse]], who was part of the [[Argentine Revolution]], called for elections in 1973, he authorized the return of political parties. However, Perón, who had been invited back from exile, was barred from seeking office.

In May 1973, Peronist [[Héctor José Cámpora]] was elected as President, but everyone understood that Perón was the real power behind him. Peronism has been difficult to define according to traditional political classifications and different periods must be distinguished. A [[populism|populist]] and [[Nationalism|nationalist]] movement, it has sometimes been accused of [[Fascism|fascist]] tendencies as Perón's admiration for [[Benito Mussolini]] is often cited in support of that assertion. After [[World War II]], Argentina became a popular country of exile for escaped [[Nazi war criminals]] who entered clandestinely via various [[ratlines (history)|ratlines]].&lt;ref&gt;Phayer, Michael. 2008, p. 173. ''Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War''. Indianapolis: Indiana University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-253-34930-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Following nearly two decades of weak civilian governments, economic decline and military interventionism, Perón returned from exile on the 20th of June in 1973,  as the country was becoming engulfed in immense financial, social and political disorder. The months preceding his return were marked by important [[social movement]]s as in the rest of South America and in particular of the [[Southern Cone]] before the military intervention of the 1970s, thus during [[Héctor Cámpora]]'s first months of government (May–July 1973) approximately 600 social conflicts, strikes and [[recovered factory|factory occupations]] had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, Hugo. ''Le désastre argentin. Péronisme, politique et violence sociale (1930–2001)'', Editions Syllepses, Paris p. 109 (2005) {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Perón's arrival at Buenos Aires Airport, snipers opened fire on the crowds of left-wing Peronist sympathizers. Known as the [[1973 Ezeiza massacre]], this event marked the split between left-wing and right-wing factions of Peronism. Perón was re-elected in 1973, backed by a broad coalition that ranged from trade unionists in the center to fascists on the right (including members of the neo-fascist ''[[Movimiento Nacionalista Tacuara]]'') and socialists like the Montoneros led by Mario Firmenich on the left.&lt;ref name=Navarrazo&gt;Servetto, Alicia.

Some leftist Peronist governors were deposed, among them [[Ricardo Obregón Cano]], governor of Córdoba, who was ousted by a police coup in February 1974. According to historian Servetto, "the Peronist right... thus stimulated the intervention of security forces to resolve internal conflicts of Peronism".&lt;ref name="Navarrazo"/&gt;

=== Isabel Perón's government ===
Perón died on 1 July 1974 and was replaced by his Vice President and third wife, [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel Perón]], who ruled Argentina until overthrown in March 1976 by the military. The 1985 [[CONADEP]] human rights commission counted 458 assassinations from 1973 to 1975 in its report ''Nunca Más'' (''Never Again''): 19 in 1973, 50 in 1974 and 359 in 1975, carried out by paramilitary groups, who acted mostly under the [[José López Rega]]'s [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance|Triple A death squad]] (according to ''Argenpress'', at least 25 trade-unionists were assassinated in 1974).&lt;ref name="Argenpress"/&gt; However, the repression of the social movements had already started before the attempt on Yrigoyen's life: on 17 July 1973, the [[General Confederation of Labour (Argentina)|CGT]] section in [[Salta]] was closed while the CGT, SMATA and Luz y Fuerza in [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]] were victims of armed attacks. Agustín Tosco, Secretary General of Luz y Fuerza, successfully avoided arrest and went into hiding until his death on 5 November 1975.&lt;ref name="Argenpress"&gt;Argenpress, 10 April 2006. [http://www.argenpress.info/nota.asp?num=029406 ''Represión en Argentina y memoria larga''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004145918/http://www.argenpress.info/nota.asp?num=029406 |date=4 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trade unionists were also targeted by the repression in 1973 as Carlos Bache was assassinated on 21 August 1973; Enrique Damiano, of the Taxis Trade Union of Córdoba, on 3 October; Juan Avila, also of Córdoba, the following day; Pablo Fredes, on 30 October in Buenos Aires; and Adrián Sánchez, on 8 November 1973 in the [[Province of Jujuy]]. Assassinations of trade unions, lawyers and so on continued and increased in 1974 and 1975 while the most combative trade unions were closed and their leaders arrested. In August 1974, Isabel Perón's government took away the rights of trade unionist representation&lt;!-- personería gremial --&gt; of the ''Federación Gráfica Bonaerense'', whose Secretary General [[Raimundo Ongaro]] was arrested in October 1974.&lt;ref name="Argenpress"/&gt; During the same month of August 1974, the SMATA Córdoba trade-union, in conflict with the company Ika Renault, was closed by the national direction of trade unions&lt;!-- dirección nacional del gremio --&gt; and the majority of its leaders and activists arrested. Most of them, including its Secretary General René Salamanca, were assassinated during the 1976–1983 dictatorship. Atilio López, General Secretary of the CGT of Córdoba and former Vice Governor of the Province, was assassinated in Buenos Aires on 16 September 1974.&lt;ref name="Argenpress"/&gt;

Peronist guerrillas, estimated on 300 to 400 active members (Montoneros) at 1977&lt;ref&gt;https://foia.state.gov/searchapp/DOCUMENTS/Argentina/0000A1F2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (and 2000 at his peak in 1975, though almost half of them related to militia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=El drama de la autonomía militar: Argentina bajo las juntas militares|last=García|first=Prudencio|year=1995|publisher=Alianza Editorial|isbn=8420694142|page=505}}&lt;/ref&gt;), committed a number of delicts in this period such as bombings at Goodyear and Firestone distributors, Riker and Eli pharmaceutical laboratories, Xerox Corporation, and Pepsi-Cola bottling companies.

==== Annihilation decrees ====
{{main|Operativo Independencia}}
In 1975, the [[Guevarist]] [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|People's Revolutionary Army]] (ERP), led by Roberto Santucho and inspired by [[Che Guevara]]'s [[foco theory]], began a small rural insurgency in the province of [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]]; with a campaign of no more than 100 men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Paul H. Lewis, ''Guerrillas &amp; Generals: The "Dirty War" in Argentina'', Praeger Paperback, 2001, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; which the Argentine Army defeated; Ítalo Luder, President of the National Assembly who acted as interim President substituting himself to Isabel Perón who was ill for a short period, signed in February 1975 the secret presidential decree 261, which ordered the army to illegally neutralize and/or "annihilate" the insurgency in [[Province of Tucumán|Tucumán]], the smallest province of Argentina. ''Operativo Independencia'' granted power to the armed forces to "execute all military operations necessary for the effects of neutralizing or annihilating the action of subversive elements acting in the Province of Tucumán".&lt;ref&gt;''[E]l comando general del Ejército procederá a ejecutar todas las operaciones militares que sean necesarias a efectos de neutralizar o aniquilar el accionar de los elementos subversivos que actúan en la provincia de Tucumán'' {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuncamas.org/document/decreto_261_75.htm Decree No. 261/75] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115180714/http://www.nuncamas.org/document/decreto_261_75.htm |date=15 November 2006 }}.

In July, there was a [[general strike]]. The government, presided temporarily by Italo Luder from the Peronist party, issued three decrees, 2770, 2771 and 2772, that created a Defense Council headed by the president and including his ministers and the chiefs of the armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuncamas.org/document/nacional/decr2770.htm Decree No. 2770/75] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185939/http://www.nuncamas.org/document/nacional/decr2770.htm |date=27 September 2007 }}.

==== March 1975 raid in Santa Fe ====
Isabel Perón's government ordered a raid on 20 March 1975, which involved 4,000 military and police officers, in Villa Constitución, [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]] in response to various trade-unionist conflicts. Many citizens and 150 activists and trade unionists leaders were arrested while the Unión Obrera Metalúrgica's subsidiary in Villa Constitución was closed down with the agreement of the trade unions' national direction, headed by Lorenzo Miguel.&lt;ref name="Argenpress"/&gt; Repression affected trade unionists of large firms such as [[Ford]], [[Fiat]], [[Renault]], [[Mercedes Benz]], [[Peugeot]] and [[Chrysler]] and was sometimes carried on with support from the firms' executives and from the trade unionist bureaucracies.&lt;ref name="Argenpress"/&gt;

== Military's rise to power ==
{{main|1976 Argentine coup}}
The sentence of the Trials to the Junta states: "The subversives had not taken control of any part of the national territory; they had not obtained recognition of interior or anterior belligerency, they were not massively supported by any foreign power, and they lacked the population's support".&lt;ref name="El Estado de necesidad"/&gt; However, the supposed threat was used for the coup.

In 1975, President [[Isabel Martínez de Perón|Isabel Perón]], under pressure from the military establishment, appointed Jorge Rafael Videla commander-in-chief of the Argentine Army. "As many people as necessary must die in Argentina so that the country will again be secure",&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/jorge-rafael-videla-argentine-junta-leader-dies-at-87/2013/05/17/f22ae8d0-2f5c-11e2-a30e-5ca76eeec857_story.html&lt;/ref&gt; falsely declared Videla in 1975 in support of the death squads. He was one of the military heads of the coup that overthrew Isabel Perón on 24 March 1976. In her place, a military junta was installed, which was headed by Admiral [[Emilio Eduardo Massera]], who stepped out in September 1978, General Orlando Agosti and Videla himself.

The junta, which dubbed itself National Reorganization Process, systematized the repression, in particular through the way of "forced disappearances" (''desaparecidos''), which made it very difficult as in [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s [[Chile]] to file legal suits as the bodies were never found. This generalization of state terror tactics has been explained in part by the information received by the Argentine militaries in the infamous [[School of Americas]] and also by French instructors from the [[French secret services|secret services]], who taught them "[[counter-insurgency]]" tactics first experimented during the [[Algerian War]] (1954–1962).&lt;ref name="Argenpress"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marie-Monique Robin]], 2004.

By 1976, [[Operation Condor]], which had already centralized information from South American intelligence agencies for years, was at its height. Chilean exiles in Argentina were threatened again and had to seek refuge in a third country. Chilean General [[Carlos Prats]] had already been assassinated by the Chilean [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] in Buenos Aires in 1974, with the help of former DINA agents [[Michael Townley]] and [[Enrique Arancibia]]. Cuban diplomats were also assassinated in Buenos Aires in the infamous ''Automotores Orletti'' torture center, one of the 300 clandestine prisons of the dictatorship, managed by the ''Grupo de Tareas 18'', headed by Aníbal Gordon, previously convicted for armed robbery and answered directly to the General Commandant of the [[SIDE]], Otto Paladino. ''Automotores Orletti'' was the main base of foreign intelligence services involved in Operation Condor. One of the survivors, José Luis Bertazzo, who was detained for two months there, identified Chileans, Uruguayans, Paraguayans and Bolivians among the prisoners. These captives were interrogated by agents from their own countries.&lt;ref name="Elcorreo"&gt;[http://www.elcorreo.eu.org/esp/article.php3?id_article=6378 Automotores Orletti el taller asesino del Cóndor] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516034522/http://www.elcorreo.eu.org/esp/article.php3?id_article=6378 |date=16 May 2007 }}, ''[[Juventud Rebelde]]'', 3 January 2006 (mirrored on ''El Correo.eu.org'') {{es icon}} / {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[John Dinges]]'s ''Los años del Cóndor'', Chilean [[Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile)|MIR]] prisoners in Orletti center told José Luis Bertazzo that they had seen two Cuban diplomats, Jesús Cejas Arias and Crescencio Galañega, tortured by Gordon's group and interrogated by a man who came one day from Miami to interrogate them. The two Cuban diplomats, charged with the protection of the Cuban ambassador to Argentina Emilio Aragonés, had been kidnapped on 9 August 1976 by 40 armed SIDE agents who blocked off all sides of the street with their [[Ford Falcon (Argentina)|Ford Falcon]]s, the cars used by the security forces during the dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;Suspected death squad cars found at Argentine base.[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/27/argentina-dictatorship-falcon-idUSL2E8QR0OQ20120327]. Reuters.&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Dinges, the [[FBI]] as well as the [[CIA]] were informed of their abduction. In his book, Dinges published a cable sent by Robert Scherrer, an FBI agent in Buenos Aires on 22 September 1976, where he mentions in passing that [[Michael Townley]], later convicted of the assassination on 21 September 1976 of former Chilean minister [[Orlando Letelier]] in Washington, D.C., had also taken part to the interrogation of the two Cubans. Former head of the DINA confirmed to Argentine federal judge María Servini de Cubría on 22 December 1999, in Santiago de Chile, the presence of Townley and Cuban [[Guillermo Novo Sampoll]] in the Orletti center. The two men traveled from Chile to Argentina on 11 August 1976 and "cooperated in the torture and assassination of the two Cuban diplomats".&lt;ref name="Elcorreo"/&gt; According to the "[[terror archives]]" discovered in Paraguay in 1992, 50,000 persons were murdered in the frame of Condor, 9,000–30,000 [[forced disappearances|disappeared (desaparecidos)]] and 400,000 incarcerated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martín Almada]], "Paraguay: The Forgotten Prison, the Exiled Country"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stella Calloni.

== Neoliberal policies of the juntas ==
During this period of [[neoliberal]] policies the level of the Argentine debt exploded; The economic policy of [[Martinez de Hoz]], Minister of Economy of the dictatorship, applied from April 2, 1976, marks the beginning of a process of destruction of the productive apparatus of the Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.clarin.com/politica/principal-programa-economico-martinez-hoz_0_S1G8FM_svme.html|date=May 2013|title=El principal sostén del programa económico de Martínez de Hoz |work=Clarin.com|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Your Money or your Life'', historian and political scientist [[Éric Toussaint]] writes:&lt;ref name="argentina.attac.org"&gt;http://www.argentina.attac.org/documentos/10.06.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=Most of the loans granted to the Argentine dictatorship came from the private banks of the U.S. It should be noted the complete agreement of the authorities of the United States (either the Federal Reserve or the American administration), with this policy of indebtedness. To obtain loans from private banks, the government demanded that Argentine companies borrow from international private banks. The public companies thus became the fundamental lever for the denationalization of the State, and the loss of national sovereignty.}}

The main Argentine public oil company, [[YPF]] (Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales), was forced to borrow abroad despite the fact that it had sufficient resources for its own development. At the time of the military coup of 24 March 1976, YPF's external debt was 372 million dollars. Seven years later at the end of the dictatorship, this debt reached 6,000 million dollars. The indebtedness had multiplied by 16 in seven years.&lt;ref name="argentina.attac.org"/&gt;

Because of the illegal character of the economic policies of Latin American dictatorships with banks as the [[International Monetary Fund]], a [[Committee for the Abolition of Illegitimate Debt]] was formed.

== Civil complices ==
There were also some companies complicit in crimes against humanity. There has been participation of senior executives of [[Ford]], [[Mercedes Benz]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavoz.com.ar/noticias/politica/juicio-civil-mercedes-benz-favorecer-represion|title=Juicio civil a Mercedes Benz por favorecer la represión|trans-title=Mercedes Benz civil trial for favoring repression |author=Agencia Télam|language=es|date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acindar, Dálmine Siderca, [[Ingenio Ledesma]], and [[Astarsa]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-268294-2015-03-17.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="periferiaactiva.files.wordpress.com"&gt;https://periferiaactiva.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/basulado-2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Victoria Basualdo, from Columbia University, investigated the complicity between large companies and armed forces. She found six companies in which dozens of union representatives were kidnapped and tortured, often detained inside the companies and transferred to clandestine detention centers (CDC) in vehicles provided by the companies. In the case of Dálmine Siderca, a CDC had been installed next to the factory, to which it communicated through a door. In the case of Acindar already during the Peronist government of María Estela Martínez de Perón in 1975, a detention center and interrogation by the Federal Police was installed inside the company.&lt;ref name="periferiaactiva.files.wordpress.com"/&gt;

Judge Alicia Vence was in charge of the investigation of acts of State terrorism committed in facilities and with the participation of authorities of the companies [[Ford]] and [[Mercedes Benz]], the latter led then by the race driver [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], involved in the acts by the witnesses. In 2015, the investigation was carried out to carry out the oral trial against the accused.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laretaguardia.com.ar/2015/04/demoliendo-mitos-el-rol-de-fangio-en.html&lt;/ref&gt;
José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, president of the metallurgical company Acindar, who was Minister of Economy between 1976 and 1980, was criminally prosecuted in the case of the kidnapping of the businessmen Federico and Miguel Gutheim, owners of SADECO cotton company.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.clarin.com/ediciones-anteriores/anularon-indulto-martinez-hoz-vuelven-investigar_0_r1ymnoXkRKg.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The direct participation of Catholic religious in the commission of crimes against humanity is also proven. [[Christian Von Wernich]] is a paradigmatic case. He is a Catholic priest, who served as a chaplain to the Police of the province of Buenos Aires and used to visit clandestine detention centers, and was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2007 for kidnappings, torture, and homicides that were considered crimes against humanity.

== False flag actions by SIDE agents ==
During a 1981 interview whose contents were revealed by documents declassified by the [[CIA]] in 2000, former DINA agent [[Michael Townley]] explained that Ignacio Novo Sampol, member of [[CORU]] anti-Castro organization, had agreed to commit the [[Cuban Nationalist Movement]] in the kidnapping in Buenos Aires of a president of a Dutch bank. The abduction, organized by civilian [[SIDE]] agents, the Argentine intelligence agency, was to obtain a ransom. Townley said that Novo Sampol had provided $6,000 from the Cuban Nationalist Movement, forwarded to the civilian SIDE agents to pay for the preparation expenses of the kidnapping. After returning to the United States, Novo Sampol sent Townley a stock of paper, used to print pamphlets in the name of ''Grupo Rojo'' (Red Group), an imaginary Argentine Marxist terrorist organization, which was to claim credit for the abduction of the Dutch banker. Townley declared that the pamphlets were distributed in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] and [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] in relation with [[false flag]] bombings perpetrated by SIDE agents, which had as aim to accredit the existence of the fake Grupo Rojo. However, the SIDE agents procrastinated too much and the kidnapping finally was not carried out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch02-09.htm Visit by Guillermo Novo Sampol to Chile in 1976, 1] and [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/ch02-10.htm 2], on the [[National Security Archive]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human rights violations from 1976 to 1983 ==

The exact chronology of the [[Political repression|repression]] occurring before the Operation Condor's beginning in March 1976 is still debated, but some sectors claim the long political conflict started in 1969 as individual cases of [[state-sponsored terrorism]] against Peronism and the left can be traced back to the [[bombing of Plaza de Mayo]] and ''[[Ley de Punto Final|Revolución Libertadora]]'' in 1955. The [[Trelew massacre]] of 1972, the actions of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance since 1973 and Isabel Martínez de Perón's "annihilation decrees"&lt;ref name="Argentina, Antonius C. G p. 145"&gt;In February 1975, the foundation was laid for a systematic assault on the revolutionary left by a secret decree ordering the Army to annihilate the encampments of Marxist insurgents in Tucumán. Political Violence and Trauma in Argentina, Antonius C. G. M. Robben, p. 145, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; against left-wing guerrillas during ''[[Operativo Independencia]]'' (Operation Independence) in 1975&lt;ref name="Argentina, Antonius C. G p. 145" /&gt; have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty War.

The target of the Junta was anyone believed to be associated with activist groups, including trade union members, students (including underage students, like in [[Night of the Pencils]], an operation directed by [[Ramón Camps]], General and head of the [[Buenos Aires Provincial Police]] from April 1976 to December 1977),&lt;ref name="Strassera" /&gt; people who had uncovered evidence of government corruption and people thought to hold left-wing views (including French nuns [[Léonie Duquet]] and [[Alice Domon]], kidnapped by [[Alfredo Astiz]]). Ramón Camps told ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'' in 1984 that he had used torture as a method of interrogation and orchestrated 5,000 forced disappearances and justified the appropriation of newborns from their imprisoned mothers "because subversive parents will raise subversive children".&lt;ref name="terra"&gt;Terra Actualidad, 18 March 2006.

In a declassified memorandum from the U.S. State Department dated May 1978, it is asserted that "if there has been a net reduction in reports of torture, this is not because torture has been forsworn but 'derives from fewer operations' because the number of terrorists and subversives has diminished" and presents that case that disappearances "include not only suspected terrorists but also encompass a broader range of people, for example, labor leaders, workers, clergymen, human rights advocates, scientists, doctors, and political party leaders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STATE DEPARTMENT OPENS FILES ON ARGENTINA'S DIRTY WAR|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB73/|publisher=National Security Archive|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report describes the torture methods used to intimidate and extract information, including electric shocks, prolonged immersion in water, cigarette burns, [[sexual abuse]], [[rape]], the removal of teeth and fingernails, burning with boiling water, oil and acid and castration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memorandum on Torture and Disappearance in Argentina, May 31, 1978|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB73/780531dos.pdf|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]], a Catholic human rights activist who had organized the Servicio de Paz y Justicia (Peace and Justice Service) and suffered torture while held without trial for 14 months in a Buenos Aires concentration camp, was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his efforts in the defense of human rights.

Declassified documents of the Chilean secret police cite an official estimate by the [[Batallón de Inteligencia 601]] of 22,000 killed or "[[disappeared]]" between 1975 and mid-1978. During this period, it was later revealed that at least 12,000 "disappeared" were detainees held by PEN (''Poder Ejecutivo Nacional'', anglicized as National Executive Power) and kept in [[Detention Centers in the Dirty War|clandestine detention camps]] throughout Argentina before eventually being freed under diplomatic pressure.&lt;ref&gt;''"Durante la vigencia del estado de sitio entre noviembre de 1974 y octubre de 1983, los organismos de derechos humanos denunciaron la existencia de 12 mil presos politicos legales en las distintas cárceles de 'maxima seguridad' a lo largo de todo el territorio de Argentina."''[http://www.elortiba.org/pdf/Memoria-de-ex-presas-y-presos-politicos.pdf Entre resistentes e "irrecuperables": Memorias de ex presas y presos políticos (1974-1983), p. 13.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224233740/http://www.elortiba.org/pdf/Memoria-de-ex-presas-y-presos-politicos.pdf|date=24 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] recorded the forced disappearance of 8,961 persons from 1976 to 1983, although it noted that the actual number is higher.&lt;ref name="edant.clarin.com"&gt;[http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2003/10/06/p-00801.htm "Una duda histórica: no se sabe cuántos son los desaparecidos"], ''Clarin'', 10 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The members of junta militar currently in prison convicted of crimes against humanity refused to give to the Argentine justice the lists of names and numbers of kidnapped, tortured, murdered or disappeared people, so the exact number of victims remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://notasperiodismopopular.com.ar/2016/07/25/desaparecidos-numero-definitivo-cuando-hablen-perpetradores/|title=Desaparecidos: "El número definitivo lo vamos a tener cuando hablen los perpetradores"|accessdate=July 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are: the delays incurred before foreign consuls can visit detainees of foreign nationality, (contravening article 34 of the Convention of Vienna.) the fact that those detained under Executive Power (PEN) are denied the right to legal advice or defense, the complete lack of information of persons detained under PEN, the fact that PEN detainees are not processed for long periods of time, the fact that there are no charges against detainees.

== Children of the disappeared ==
At the time when the CONADEP report was prepared, the ''Asociación Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo'' ([[Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] or ''Abuelas''), had records of 172 children who disappeared together with their parents or were born at the numerous concentration camps and had not been returned to their families.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sZrB1KhQ9voC&amp;pg=PA429&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=children%20of%20disappeared%20Argentina Human Rights from Exclusion to Inclusion: Principles and Practice, Theo Van Boven, p. 429, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 2000].

== Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo ==
[[File:Rallying to the Casa Rosada.jpg|thumb|[[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]], Argentine mothers whose children were "disappeared" during the Dirty War]]
The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo is the best-known Argentine human rights organization. For over thirty years, the Mothers have campaigned to find out about the fate of their lost relatives. The Mothers first held their vigil at Plaza de Mayo in 1977, where they continue to gather there every Thursday afternoon. An article of the Madres of the Plaza de Mayo monthly publication caused quite a stir in the mid-1980s, when the Human Rights Group Familiares were quoted as saying: "Familiares assumes the causes of their children's fight as their own, vindicates all the disappeared as fighters of the people, [...] [and when occurs] the defeat of imperialism and the sovereignty of the people, we will have achieved our objectives".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Norden|first=Deborah L.|title=Military Rebellion in Argentina: Between Coups and Consolidation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B07G2fua-z4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;q=Familiares%20assumes|accessdate=Dec 2013|year=1996|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|isbn=0803283695|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo split into two groups: Las Madres de Plaza de Mayo – Linea Fundadora (Founding Line) remains focused in recovering the remains of the missing and bringing former police and military commanders to justice. On the other hand, the Asociacion de Madres de Plaza de Mayo (Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo Association) is opposed to the search for and identification of the missing and have also rejected monetary compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lyZYS_GxglIC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq= Women and war: a historical encyclopedia from antiquity to the present], Volume 1, by Bernard A.

== Coordination on international criminal operations ==
{{further|Operation Charly}}
In 1980, the Argentine military helped [[Nazism|Nazi]] war criminal [[Klaus Barbie]], [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]] and major drug lords mount the bloody [[1980 Bolivian coup d'état|Cocaine Coup]] of [[Luis García Meza Tejada]] in neighboring [[Bolivia]]. They hired 70 foreign agents for this task,&lt;ref name=Steno26&gt;[http://www.parlamento.it/bicam/terror/stenografici/steno26.htm Hearing] of [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]] on 22 July 1997 before the Italian Parliamentary Commission on Terrorism headed by senator [[Giovanni Pellegrino]] {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was managed in particular by the [[Batallón de Inteligencia 601|601st Intelligence Battalion]] headed by General [[Guillermo Suárez Mason]]. After having been trained by the French military, in the frame of Operation Charly the Argentine Armed Forces would train their counterparts in Nicaragua, but also [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]] and [[Guatemala]]. From 1977 to 1984, after the Falklands War the Argentine Armed Forces exported [[counter-insurgency]] tactics, including the systemic use of torture, death squads and disappearances. [[Special forces|Special force]] units, such as ''[[Batallón de Inteligencia 601]]'', headed in 1979 by Colonel Jorge Alberto Muzzio, trained the Nicaraguan [[Contra (guerrillas)|Contras]] in the 1980s, in particular in [[Lepaterique]] base.

Following the release of classified documents and an interview with [[Duane Clarridge]], former [[CIA]] responsible for operations with the [[Contras]], the ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'' showed that with the election of President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1977 the CIA was blocked from engaging in the [[special warfare]] it had previously been engaged in. In conformity with the National Security Doctrine, the Argentine military supported U.S. goals in [[Latin America]] while they pressured the United States to be more active in counter-revolutionary activities. In 1981, following the election of [[Ronald Reagan]] the CIA took over training of the [[Contras]] from [[Batallón de Inteligencia 601|Batallón 601]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/suplementos/especiales/2006/03/24/l-01164353.htm "Los secretos de la guerra sucia continental de la dictadura"], ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]]'', 24 March 2006 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Chilean and Uruguayan exiles in Argentina were murdered by Argentine security forces (including high-profile figures such as General [[Carlos Prats]] in Buenos Aires in 1974, Héctor Gutiérrez Ruiz and [[Zelmar Michelini]] in Buenos Aires in 1976). Others, such as Wilson Ferreira Aldunate escaped death.&lt;ref name="NSA"&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB73/index3.htm Argentine Military Believed U.S. Gave Go-Ahead for Dirty War], [[National Security Archive]] Electronic Briefing Book No. 73 – Part II, CIA classified documents released in 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Buenos Aires, [[Robert C. Hill]], a five-time conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] ambassadorial appointee, worked behind the scenes to keep the Argentina military junta from engaging in massive human rights violations. Upon finding out that Kissinger had given the Argentine generals a "green light" for the [[state terrorism]] of the junta in June 1976 while at an Organization of American States meeting in Santiago (at the Hotel Carrera, later made famous as the Hotel Cabrera in the film ''[[Missing (1982 film)|Missing]]''), Hill quietly scrambled to try to roll back the Kissinger decision. Hill did this although Kissinger aides told him that if he continued, Kissinger would likely have him fired. During that meeting with Argentine foreign minister [[César Augusto Guzzetti]], Kissinger assured him that the United States was an ally.

In October 1987, ''The Nation'' noted: "'Hill was shaken, he became very disturbed, by the case of the son of a thirty-year embassy employee, a student who was arrested, never to be seen again,' recalled former ''New York Times'' reporter [http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blogs/juan-de-onis Juan de Onis]. 'Hill took a personal interest.' He went to the Interior Minister, an army general with whom he had worked on drug cases, saying, 'Hey, what about this? We're interested in this case.' He buttonholed (Foreign Minister Cesar) Guzzetti and, finally, President Jorge R. Videla himself. 'All he got was stonewalling; he got nowhere.' de Onis said. 'His last year was marked by increasing disillusionment and dismay, and he backed his staff on human rights right to the hilt." "It sickened me," said Patricia Derian, the Mississippi civil rights crusader who became President Jimmy Carter's State Department point person on human rights, after Hill reported to her Kissinger's real role, "that with an imperial wave of his hand, an American could sentence people to death on the basis of a cheap whim. As time went on I saw Kissinger's footprints in a lot of countries. It was the repression of a democratic ideal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Andersen |first=Martin Edwin |authorlink=Martin Edwin Andersen (journalist, born 1954) |title=Kissinger and the 'Dirty War,' |date=October 31, 1987 |work=[[The Nation]] |url=http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Kissinger/Kissinger_DirtyWar.html |accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor-last=Osorio |editor-first=Carlos |editor2-last=Costar |editor2-first=Kathleen |title=Kissinger to the Argentine Generals in 1976: 'If There Are Things That Have To Be Done, You Should Do Them Quickly' |date=August 27, 2004 |work=[[National Security Archive]] |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB133/index.htm |accessdate=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Campbell |first=Duncan |authorlink=Duncan Campbell (journalist, born 1944) |title=Kissinger Approved Argentinian 'Dirty War' |date=December 5, 2003 |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/dec/06/argentina.usa |accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |authorlink=Christopher Hitchens (journalist, born 1949) |title=Kissinger Declassified |date=December 2004 |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/12/hitchens200412 |accessdate=February 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Corn |first=David |title=New Memo: Kissinger Gave the 'Green Light' for Argentina's Dirty War |date=January 14, 2014 |work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2014/01/new-memo-kissinger-gave-green-light-argentina-dirty-war |accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, former Secretary Kissinger was feted by the "dirty war" generals as a much touted guest of honor at the World Cup soccer matches held in Argentina. In a letter to ''The Nation'' editor [[Victor Navasky]], protesting publication of the 1987 article, Kissinger claimed: "At any rate, the notion of Hill as a passionate human rights advocate is news to all his former associates". Ironically, Kissinger's posthumous lampooning of Hill (who had died in 1978) as human rights advocate was later shown to be false by none other than once and future Kissinger aide Henry Shlaudeman, later ambassador to Buenos Aires, who told [[William E. Knight]], an oral historian working for the [[Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training]] (ADST) Foreign Affairs Oral History Project:
{{quote|It really came to a head when I was Assistant Secretary, or it began to come to a head, in the case of Argentina where the dirty war was in full flower. Bob Hill, who was Ambassador then in Buenos Aires, a very conservative Republican politician -- by no means liberal or anything of the kind, began to report quite effectively about what was going on, this slaughter of innocent civilians.

He, at one time in fact, sent me a back-channel telegram saying that the Foreign Minister, who had just come for a visit to Washington and had returned to Buenos Aires, had gloated to him that Kissinger had said nothing to him about human rights. I don't know -- I wasn't present at the interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor=Foreign Affairs Oral History Project |title=Ambassador Harry W.

State Department documents obtained in 2003 during the [[George W. Bush]] administration by the [[National Security Archive]] under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] show that in October 1976 Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and high-ranking U.S. officials gave their full support to the Argentine military junta and urged them to hurry up and finish their actions before the Congress cut military aid.&lt;ref name="The Dirty War in Argentina"/&gt; On 5 October 1976, Kissinger met with Argentina's Foreign Minister and stated:
{{quote|Look, our basic attitude is that we would like you to succeed. I have an old-fashioned view that friends ought to be supported. What is not understood in the United States is that you have a civil war. We read about human rights problems but not the context. The quicker you succeed the better. [...] The human rights problem is a growing one. Your Ambassador can apprise you. We want a stable situation. We won't cause you unnecessary difficulties. If you can finish before Congress gets back, the better. Whatever freedoms you could restore would help.&lt;ref name="The Dirty War in Argentina"/&gt;}}

The United States was also a key provider of economic and military assistance to the Videla regime during the earliest and most intense phase of the repression.

In 1977 and 1978, the United States sold more than $120,000,000 in military spare parts to Argentina and in 1977 the Department of Defense was granted $700,000 to train 217 Argentine military officers.&lt;ref&gt;Guest, 1990; pg. 166&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the [[International Military Education and Training]] (IMET) program was suspended to Argentina in 1978, total U.S. training costs for Argentine military personnel since 1976 totalled $1,115,000. The [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], whose first term began in 1981, asserted that the previous Carter administration had weakened U.S. diplomatic relationships with [[Cold War]] allies in Argentina and reversed the previous administration's official condemnation of the junta's human rights practices. The re-establishment of diplomatic ties allowed for [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] collaboration with the Argentine intelligence service in training and arming the Nicaraguan [[Contras]] against the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] government.

== French connection ==
{{further|Torture during the Algerian War}}
Investigating French military influence in Argentina, French journalist [[Marie-Monique Robin]] found in 2003 the original document proving that a 1959 agreement between Paris and Buenos Aires initiated a "permanent French military mission" in Argentina and reported on it (she found the document in the archives of the ''[[Quai d'Orsay]]'', the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs). The mission was formed of veterans who had fought in the [[Algerian War]] and it was assigned to the offices of the chief of staff of the [[Argentine Armed Forces]]. It was continued until 1981, date of the election of [[French Socialist Party|socialist]] [[François Mitterrand]].&lt;ref name="Pagina12"&gt;[http://risal.collectifs.net/article.php3?id_article=1153 "Argentine – 'Escadrons de la mort, l’école française' "], interview with Marie-Monique Robin published by RISAL, 22 October 2004 available in French &amp; Spanish [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/espectaculos/6-42243-2004-10-13.html "Los métodos de Argel se aplicaron aquí"], ''[[Página/12]]'', 13 October 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

After release of her documentary film ''Escadrons de la mort, l'école française'' in 2003 which explored the French connection with South American nations, Robin said in an interview with ''[[L'Humanité]]'' newspaper: "French have systematized a military technique in urban environment which would be copied and pasted to Latin American dictatorships".&lt;ref name="Robin"&gt;[http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2003-08-30/2003-08-30-377887 L’exportation de la torture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050705132223/http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2003-08-30/2003-08-30-377887 |date=5 July 2005 }}, interview with [[Marie-Monique Robin]] in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 30 August 2003 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; She noted that the French military had systematized the methods they used to suppress the insurgency during the 1957 [[Battle of Algiers (1957)|Battle of Algiers]] and exported them to the War School in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="Pagina12"/&gt; [[Roger Trinquier]]'s famous book on [[counter-insurgency]] had a very strong influence in South America. In addition, Robin said she was shocked to learn that the [[Direction de surveillance du territoire|DST]] French intelligence agency gave DINA the names of refugees who returned to Chile (Operation Retorno) from France during their counterinsurgency. All of these Chileans have been killed: "Of course, this puts in cause [''sic'' – this makes responsible] the French government, and [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing|Giscard d'Estaing]], then President of the Republic. I was very shocked by the duplicity of the French diplomatic position which, on one hand, received with open arms the political refugees, and, on the other hand, collaborated with the dictatorships".&lt;ref name="Robin"/&gt;

On 10 September 2003, Green members of parliament [[Noël Mamère]], [[Martine Billard]] and [[Yves Cochet]] filed a request to form a Parliamentary Commission to examine the "role of France in the support of military regimes in Latin America from 1973 to 1984" before the Foreign Affairs Commission of the National Assembly, presided by [[Edouard Balladur]] ([[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]]). Apart from ''[[Le Monde]],'' French newspapers did not report this request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=820135 MM.

The Commission in December 2003 published a 12-page report claiming that the French had never signed a military agreement with Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;« Série B. Amérique 1952–1963.

When Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Dominique de Villepin]] travelled to Chile in February 2003, he claimed that no co-operation between France and the military regimes had occurred.&lt;ref name = "LeMonde_2003"&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=838522 Argentine : M. de Villepin défend les firmes françaises], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 5 February 2003 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; People in Argentina were outraged when they saw the 2003 film, which included three generals defending their actions during the Dirty War. Due to public pressure, President [[Néstor Kirchner]] ordered the military to bring charges against the three for justifying the crimes of the dictatorship. They were [[Albano Hargindeguy]], [[Reynaldo Bignone]] and [[Ramón Genaro Díaz Bessone]].&lt;ref name="sherry"&gt;[https://muse.jhu.edu/article/177953 J.

The next year, Robin published her book under the same title ''Escadrons de la mort: l'école française'' (''Death Squads: The French School'', 2004), revealing more material. She showed how [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]]'s government secretly collaborated with [[National Reorganization Process|Videla's junta]] in Argentina and with [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s regime in Chile.&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Monique Robin, ''Escadrons de la mort : l'école française,'' Paris: Éditions La Découverte, 2004. {{ISBN|2-7071-4163-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algeria-watch.org/fr/article/div/livres/escadrons_mort_conclusion.htm Conclusion] of [[Marie-Monique Robin]]'s ''Escadrons de la mort, l'école française'' {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcides Lopez Aufranc was among the first Argentine officers to go in 1957 to Paris to study for two years at the [[Ecole de Guerre]] military school, two years before the [[Cuban Revolution]] and when no Argentine guerrillas existed:&lt;ref name="Pagina12"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In practice, declared Robin to ''[[Página/12]]'', the arrival of the French in Argentina led to a massive extension of intelligence services and of the use of [[torture]] as the primary weapon of the anti-[[subversive]] war in the concept of modern warfare.&lt;ref name="Pagina12"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The annihilation decrees signed by [[Isabel Perón]] had been inspired by French texts. During the Battle of Algiers, the police forces were put under the authority of the Army. 30,000 persons were "disappeared". In Algeria. [[Reynaldo Bignone]], named President of the Argentine junta in July 1982, said in Robin's film: "The March 1976 order of battle is a copy of the Algerian battle".&lt;ref name="Pagina12"/&gt; The same statements were made by Generals [[Albano Harguindeguy]], Videla's Interior Minister; and Diaz Bessone, former Minister of Planification and ideologue of the junta.&lt;ref name="Rouge"&gt;[http://www.europe-solidaire.org/spip.php?article649 "Torture : l’école française"], Marie-Monique Robin, interview first published by ''[[Rouge (magazine)|Rouge]],'' September 2005 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French military would transmit to their Argentine counterparts the notion of an "internal enemy" and the use of torture, death squads and ''quadrillages'' (grids).

Marie-Monique Robin also demonstrated that since the 1930s, there had been ties between the French far-right and Argentina, in particular through the [[Catholic fundamentalist]] organisation ''[[Cité catholique]]'', created by [[Jean Ousset]], a former secretary of [[Charles Maurras]], the founder of the royalist ''Action Française'' movement. ''La Cité'' edited a review, ''Le Verbe'', which influenced militaries during the Algerian War, notably by justifying the use of torture. At the end of the 1950s, the ''Cité catholique'' founded groups in Argentina and organised cells in the Army. It greatly expanded during the government of General [[Juan Carlos Onganía]], in particular in 1969.&lt;ref name="Pagina12"/&gt; The key figure of the ''Cité catholique'' in Argentina was priest Georges Grasset, who became Videla's personal confessor. He had been the spiritual guide of the [[Organisation armée secrète]] (OAS), the pro-French Algeria terrorist movement founded in [[Franquist Spain]].

Robin believes that this Catholic fundamentalist current in the Argentine Army contributed to the importance and length of the French-Argentine co-operation. In Buenos Aires, Georges Grasset maintained links with Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]], founder of [[Society of St. Pius X]] in 1970, who was excommunicated in 1988. The Society of Pius-X has four monasteries in Argentina, the largest one in La Reja. A French priest from there said to Marie-Monique Robin: "To save the soul of a Communist priest, one must kill him." Luis Roldan, former Secretary of Cult under [[Carlos Menem]], President of Argentina from 1989 to 1999, was presented by Dominique Lagneau, the priest in charge of the monastery, to Robin as "Mr. Cité catholique in Argentina". [[Jordan Bruno Genta|Bruno Genta]] and Juan Carlos Goyeneche represent this ideology.&lt;ref name="Pagina12"/&gt;

[[Antonio Caggiano]], archbishop of Buenos Aires from 1959 to 1975, wrote a prologue to Jean Ousset's 1961 Spanish version of ''Le Marxisme-léninisme''. Caggiano said that "Marxism is the negation of Christ and his Church" and referred to a Marxist conspiracy to take over the world, for which it was necessary to "prepare for the decisive battle".&lt;ref&gt;Antonio Caggiano, Introduction to Jean Ousset, ''Le Marsisme-léninisme'' (1961 Spanish edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with President [[Arturo Frondizi]] ([[Radical Civic Union]], UCR), Caggiano inaugurated the first course on counter-revolutionary warfare in the Higher Military College.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} (Frondizi was eventually overthrown for being "tolerant of Communism").{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

By 1963, cadets at the [[Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics|Navy Mechanics School]] started receiving counter-insurgency classes. They were shown the film ''[[The Battle of Algiers (film)|The Battle of Algiers]]'', which showed the methods used by the French Army in Algeria. Caggiano, the military chaplain at the time, introduced the film and added a religiously oriented commentary to it. On 2 July 1966, four days after President [[Arturo Umberto Illia]] was removed from office and replaced by the dictator [[Juan Carlos Onganía]], Caggiano declared: "We are at a sort of dawn, in which, thanks to God, we all sense that the country is again headed for greatness".{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Argentine Admiral [[Luis María Mendía]], who had started the practice of "death flights", testified in January 2007 before Argentine judges, that a French intelligence agent, Bertrand de Perseval, had participated in the abduction of the two French nuns, [[Léonie Duquet]] and Alice Domont. Perseval, who lives today in Thailand, denied any links with the abduction. He has admitted being a former member of the [[Organisation armée secrète|OAS]] and having escaped from Algeria after the March 1962 [[Évian Accords]] put an end to the [[Algerian War]] (1954–1962).

During the 2007 hearings, Luis María Mendía referred to material presented in Robin's documentary, titled ''The Death Squads – the French School'' (2003). He asked the Argentine Court to call numerous French officials to testify to their actions: former French President, [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]], former French Premier [[Pierre Messmer]], former French embassador to Buenos Aires Françoise de la Gosse and all officials in place in the French embassy in Buenos Aires between 1976 and 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/international/20070206.FIG000000202_disparitions_un_ancien_agent_francais_mis_en_cause.html "Disparitions : un ancien agent français mis en cause"], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 6 February 2007 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this "French connection", María Mendía also charged former head of state [[Isabel Perón]] and former ministers [[Carlos Ruckauf]] and [[Antonio Cafiero]], who had signed the "anti-subversion decrees" before Videla's 1976 coup. According to Graciela Dalo, a survivor of the [[Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics|ESMA]] interrogations, Mendía was trying to establish that these crimes were legitimate, as the 1987 ''Obediencia Debida'' Act claimed them to be and further that the ESMA actions had been committed under Isabel Perón's "anti-subversion decrees" (which would give them a formal appearance of legality, although torture is forbidden by the Argentine Constitution).&lt;ref name="P12"&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-79898-2007-02-02.html "Impartí órdenes que fueron cumplidas"], ''[[Página/12]]'', 2 February 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfredo Astiz]] also referred to the "French connexion" when testifying in court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-79537-2007-01-25.html Astiz llevó sus chicanas a los tribunales], ''[[Página/12]]'', 25 January 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Truth commission and decrees revoked ==
The junta relinquished power in 1983. After democratic elections, President elect [[Raúl Alfonsín]] created the [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons]] (CONADEP) in December 1983, led by writer [[Ernesto Sábato]], to collect evidence about the Dirty War crimes. The gruesome details, including documentation of the disappearance of nearly 9,000 people, shocked the world. Jorge Rafael Videla, head of the junta, was among the generals convicted of human rights crimes, including forced disappearances, torture, murders and kidnappings. President Alfonsín ordered that the nine members of the military junta be judicially charged during the 1985 [[Trial of the Juntas]]. {{as of|2010}}, most of the military officials are in trial or jail. In 1985, Videla was sentenced to life imprisonment at the military prison of Magdalena. Several senior officers also received jail terms. In the Prologue to the ''Nunca Más'' report ("Never Again"), Ernesto Sábato wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;From the moment of their abduction, the victims lost all rights. Deprived of all communication with the outside world, held in unknown places, subjected to barbaric tortures, kept ignorant of their immediate or ultimate fate, they risked being either thrown into a river or the sea, weighted down with blocks of cement, or burned to ashes. They were not mere objects, however, and still possessed all the human attributes: they could feel pain, could remember a mother, child or spouse, could feel infinite shame at being raped in public.&lt;ref name="Victims"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reacting to the human rights trials, hardliners in the Argentine army staged a series of uprisings against the Alfonsín government. They barricaded themselves in several military barracks demanding an end of the trials. During Holy Week (''Semana Santa'') of April 1987, Lieutenant Colonel [[Aldo Rico]] (commander of the 18th Infantry Regiment in Misiones province) and several junior army officers, barricaded themselves in the Campo de Mayo army barracks. The military rebels, who were called the [[carapintadas]], called for an end to the trials and the resignation of army chief of staff General [[Héctor Ríos Ereñú]]. Rico believed that the Alfonsin government would be unwilling or unable to put down the uprising. He was correct as the Second Army Corps commander's orders to surround the barracks were ignored by his subordinates. Alfonsin called on the people to come to the Plaza de Mayo to defend democracy and hundreds of thousands responded.

After a helicopter visit by Alfonsin to Campo de Mayo, the rebels finally surrendered. There were denials of a deal, but several generals were forced into early retirement and General Jose Dante Caridi was soon replaced Erenu as commander of the army. In January 1988, a second military rebellion took place when Rico refused to accept the detention orders issued by a military court for having led the previous uprising. This time he set up base in the 4th Infantry Regiment in Monte Caseros and repudiated Caridi's calls to hand himself in. Rico again demanded an end to the human rights trials saying the promises of Alfonsin to the rebels had not been fulfilled. Caridi ordered several army units to suppress the rebellion. Their advance to the Monte Caseros barracks was slowed down by the rains and the news that rebel soldiers had laid mines that had wounded three loyal officers. Nevertheless, Rico's forces were defeated after a three-hour battle. They surrendered on 17 January 1988 and 300 rebels were arrested, and sentenced to jail.

A third uprising took place in December 1988. This time the uprising was led by Lieutenant-Colonel Mohammed Alí Seineldín and was supported by 1,000 rebel troops. This uprising proved successful. Several of the demands of Seineldin and his followers were met. Caridi was forced into retirement and replaced by General Francisco Gassino, who had served in the Falklands/Malvinas War and was held in high esteem by the carapintadas. On 5 October 1989, as part of a sweeping reform the newly elected President [[Carlos Menem]] [[pardon]]ed those convicted in the human right trials and the rebel leaders imprisoned for taking part in the military uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rnw.nl/international-justice/article/twenty-years-amnesty-end "Twenty years on, amnesty end"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608063255/http://www.rnw.nl/international-justice/article/twenty-years-amnesty-end |date=8 June 2011 }}. ''International Justice Tribune''. 27 June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; These amnesty laws were long unpopular first with surviving victims of the Dirty War and their families, later on between most of the population.

In 2005, under [[Nestor Kirchner]] presidency, the trials were opened again. Most of the Junta's members are currently in prison by charges of [[crimes against humanity]] and [[genocide]].

== Continuing controversies ==
On 23 January 1989, an armed group of around 40 guerrillas, a faction of the ''Movimiento Todos por la Patria'' (MTP or All for the Fatherland Movement), attacked the La Tablada army barracks on the outskirts of Buenos Aires to "prevent" a military coup. The attack resulted in 28 of the guerrillas killed, five "disappeared" and 13 imprisoned. Eleven police and military died, and 53 were wounded in the fighting. The guerrillas claimed to have acted to prevent a military coup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theargentimes.com/feature/la-tablada-the-guerrillas-last-stand-/ "La Tablada – the Guerrillas' Last Stand"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20090814042252/http://www.theargentimes.com/feature/la-tablada-the-guerrillas-last-stand-/ |date=14 August 2009 }}, ''The Argentine Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Among the dead at La Tablada was Jorge Baños, a human rights lawyer who had joined the guerrillas.

All of the Netherlands had wrestled in controversy over her suitability, but ultimately the marriage took place without the presence of her parents. Máxima thus became Queen when her husband ascended to the throne in 2013. In August 2016, Argentine President [[Mauricio Macri]] was widely condemned by human rights group for calling into question the number of 30,000 disappeared and for referring to the period as a "Dirty War".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2016/08/11/argentina/1470936255_170858.html|title=Mauricio Macri reactiva la polémica por el número de desaparecidos en Argentina|first=Ediciones El|last=País|date=11 August 2016|work=elpais.com|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repeal of Pardon Laws and renewal of prosecutions ==
Under [[Néstor Kirchner]]'s term as President in 2003, the Argentine Congress revoked the longstanding amnesty laws, also called the Pardon Laws. In 2005, the Argentine Supreme Court ruled these laws were unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infobae.com/politica/326085-100799-0-La-Corte-declar%F3-la-nulidad-los-indultos-Menem|title=La Corte declaró la nulidad de los indultos de Menem|publisher=Infobae|date=14 July 2007|accessdate=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government re-opened prosecution of war crimes. From then through October 2011, 259 persons were convicted for [[crimes against humanity]] and [[genocide]] and sentenced in Argentine courts, including [[Alfredo Astiz]], a notorious torturer, that month.

In 2006, 24 March was designated as a [[Public holidays in Argentina|public holiday in Argentina]], the [[Day of Remembrance for Truth and Justice]]. That year on the 30th anniversary of the coup, a huge crowd filled the streets to remember what happened during the military government and ensure it did not happen again.

In 2006, the government began its first trials of military and security officers since the repeal of the "Pardon Laws". [[Miguel Etchecolatz]], the police commissioner of the province of Buenos Aires in the 1970s, faced trial on charges of illegal detention, torture and homicide. He was found guilty of six counts of murder, six counts of unlawful imprisonment and seven counts of torture and sentenced in September 2006 to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name=Klein-100-102&gt;Klein, Naomi.

In February 2006, some former [[Ford]] Argentine workers sued the U.S.-based company, alleging that local managers worked with the security forces to detain union members on the premises and torture them. The civil suit against Ford Motor Company and Ford Argentina called for four former company executives and a retired military officer to be questioned.&lt;ref name="ford"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4746236.stm "Ford sued over Argentine abuses"], BBC News, 24 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pedro Norberto Troiani, one of the plaintiffs, 25 employees were detained in the plant, located {{convert|40|mi|km|-1}} from Buenos Aires. Allegations have surfaced since 1998 that Ford officials were involved in state repression, but the company has denied the claims. Army personnel were reported to have arrived at the plant on the day of the military coup on 24 March 1976 and "disappearances" immediately started.&lt;ref name="ford"/&gt;

In 2007, President [[Cristina Kirchner]] continued prosecution of military and security officers responsible for the "disappearances".

On 14 December 2007, some 200 men who were at military service during the dictatorship demanded an audience with the governor of Tucumán Province, claiming they too were victims of the Junta as they had no choice and suffered hunger, abandonment, physical and psychological injuries, demanding a military pension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsigloweb.com/portal_ediciones/246/portal_notas/10448-ex-soldados-exigen-una-pensin "Ex soldados exigen una pensión"] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20070808124411/http://www.elsigloweb.com/portal_ediciones/246/portal_notas/10448-ex-soldados-exigen-una-pensin |date=8 August 2007 }}, ''El Siglo'', 15 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, a German court issued an international arrest warrant for former dictator [[Jorge Videla]] in connection with the death of 20-year-old [[Rolf Stawowiok]] in Argentina. He was a German citizen born in Argentina while his father was doing development work there. Rolf Stawowiok disappeared on 21 February 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120803022236/http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=24&amp;art_id=nw20100125134712863C771158&amp;page_number=2 "Arrest warrant for ex-dictator"] , IOL: News for South Africa and the World, 25 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier cases, France, Italy and Spain had requested [[extradition]] of the Navy captain [[Alfredo Astiz]] for war crimes related to his work with [[Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics|ESMA]], but were never successful.&lt;ref name="csconviction"&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/2011/1027/Argentina-s-Blond-angel-of-death-convicted-for-role-in-dirty-war Sam Ferguson, "Argentina's 'Blond angel of death' convicted for role in dirty war"], ''The Christian Science Monitor'', 27 October 2011, accessed 12 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Participation of members of the Catholic Church ==
On 15 April 2005, a human rights lawyer filed a criminal complaint against Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio (now [[Pope Francis]]), accusing him of conspiring with the junta in 1976 to kidnap two [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests. So far, no hard evidence has been presented linking the cardinal to this crime. It is known that the cardinal headed the Society of Jesus of Argentina in 1976 and had asked the two priests to leave their pastoral work following conflict within the Society over how to respond to the new military dictatorship, with some priests advocating a violent overthrow. The cardinal's spokesman flatly denied the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/17/world/fg-cardinal17|title=Argentine Cardinal Named in Kidnap Lawsuit|first=From Associated|last=Press|date=17 April 2005|publisher=|accessdate=16 March 2017|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A priest, [[Christian von Wernich]], was chaplain of the [[Buenos Aires Province Police]] while it was under the command of General [[Ramón Camps]] during the dictatorship, with the rank of inspector. On 9 October 2007, he was found guilty of complicity in 7 homicides, 42 kidnappings and 32 instances of torture and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]].

Some Catholic priests sympathised with and helped the Montoneros. Radical priests, including Father Alberto Carbone, who was eventually indicted in the murder of Aramburu, preached Marxism and presented the early Church fathers as model revolutionaries in an attempt to legitimise the violence.&lt;ref&gt;MacLachlan, Colin M. ''Argentina: What Went Wrong'' (Praeger Publishers). p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; A Catholic youth leader, Juan Ignacio Isla Casares, with the help of the Montoneros commander Eduardo Pereira Rossi (nom de guerre "El Carlón") was the mastermind behind the ambush and killing of five policemen near San Isidro Cathedral on 26 October 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Rojas, Guillermo. ''30,000 desaparecidos. realidad, mito y dogma : historia verdadera y manipulación ideologica''. p. 246 (Santiago Apóstol: 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mario Firmenich]], who later became the leader of the Montoneros, was the ex president of the Catholic Action Youth Group and a former seminarian himself.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=e-kVgozyE8gC&amp;pg=PA281 Modern Tyrants: the power and prevalence of evil in our age, Daniel Chirot, p. 281]. Google Books.com (15 April 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; The Montoneros had ties with the [[Movement of Priests for the Third World]] and a Jesuit priest, [[Carlos Mugica]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=b8k4rEPvq_8C&amp;pg=PA201&amp;q= ''Encyclopedia of modern worldwide extremists and extremist groups''], Stephen E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5861">'''Document retrieval''' is defined as the matching of some stated user query against a set of [[free-text]] records. These records could be any type of mainly [[natural language|unstructured text]], such as [[newspaper article]]s, real estate records or paragraphs in a manual. User queries can range from multi-sentence full descriptions of an information need to a few words.

Document retrieval is sometimes referred to as, or as a branch of, '''text retrieval'''. Text retrieval is a branch of [[information retrieval]] where the information is stored primarily in the form of [[natural language|text]]. Text databases became decentralized thanks to the [[personal computer]] and the [[CD-ROM]]. Text retrieval is a critical area of study today, since it is the fundamental basis of all [[internet]] [[search engine]]s.

==Description==
Document retrieval systems find information to given criteria by matching text records (''documents'') against user queries, as opposed to [[expert system]]s that answer questions by [[Inference|inferring]] over a logical [[knowledge base|knowledge database]]. A document retrieval system consists of a database of documents, a [[classification algorithm]] to build a full text index, and a user interface to access the database.

A document retrieval system has two main tasks:
# Find relevant documents to user queries
# Evaluate the matching results and sort them according to relevance, using algorithms such as [[PageRank]].

Internet [[search engines]] are classical applications of document retrieval. The vast majority of retrieval systems currently in use range from simple Boolean systems through to systems using [[statistical]] or [[natural language processing]] techniques.

==Variations==
There are two main classes of indexing schemata for document retrieval systems: ''form based'' (or ''word based''), and ''content based'' indexing. The document classification scheme (or [[Search engine indexing|indexing algorithm]]) in use determines the nature of the document retrieval system.

===Form based===
Form based document retrieval addresses the exact syntactic properties of a text, comparable to substring matching in string searches. The text is generally unstructured and not necessarily in a natural language, the system could for example be used to process large sets of chemical representations in molecular biology. A [[suffix tree]] algorithm is an example for form based indexing.

===Content based===
The content based approach exploits semantic connections between documents and parts thereof, and semantic connections between queries and documents. Most content based document retrieval systems use an [[inverted index]] algorithm.

A ''signature file'' is a technique that creates a ''quick and dirty'' filter, for example a [[Bloom filter]], that will keep all the documents that match to the query and ''hopefully'' a few ones that do not. The way this is done is by creating for each file a signature, typically a hash coded version. One method is superimposed coding. A post-processing step is done to discard the false alarms. Since in most cases this structure is inferior to [[inverted file]]s in terms of speed, size and functionality, it is not used widely. However, with proper parameters it can beat the inverted files in certain environments.

==Example: PubMed==
The [[PubMed]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim W, Aronson AR, Wilbur WJ |title=Automatic MeSH term assignment and quality assessment |journal=Proc AMIA Symp |pages=319–23 |year=2001 |pmid=11825203 |pmc=2243528 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; form interface features the "related articles" search which works through a comparison of words from the documents' title, abstract, and [[Medical Subject Headings|MeSH]] terms using a word-weighted algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3827/#pubmedhelp.Computation_of_Related_Citati|title=Computation of Related Citations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=Oct 30, 2007|volume=8|pages=423|pmid=17971238|title=PubMed related articles: a probabilistic topic-based model for content similarity|author=Lin J1, Wilbur WJ|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-8-423|pmc=2212667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Everipedia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|v|ər|ɪ|ˈ|p|iː|d|i|ə|,_|ˌ|ɛ|v|ər|i|-}}) is a [[wiki]]-based [[online encyclopedia]]. Founded in December 2014, the site was launched in January 2015 as a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of [[Wikipedia]]. It is owned by Everipedia, Inc., a for-profit company headquartered in Westwood, Los Angeles, California. {{As of|October 2017}}, the majority of Everipedia pages are copies of Wikipedia articles.

The site's name is a portmanteau of the words "everything" and "encyclopedia". Everipedia aims to build the most accessible online encyclopedia, and not be as restrictive as Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Everipedia adapted [[social media]] elements such as letting celebrities communicate with fans,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.inc.com/chirag-kulkarni/the-dna-of-disruption-how-to-disrupt-an-industry-in-3-steps.html|title=How to Disrupt any Industry in 3 Steps|date=2016-01-09|work=Inc.com|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and allows users to create pages on any topic as long as the content is cited and neutral.&lt;ref name="Bowman2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="James2017" /&gt; {{As of|2018}}, the site has been criticized for presenting false information on [[breaking news]] events, and for its original articles being focused on sensational topics such as [[YouTuber]]s.

The company uses [[EOS.IO|EOS]] [[blockchain]] technology and a [[cryptocurrency]] token called IQ to encourage generating information.

The '''Fourth International''' ('''FI''') is a [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] [[international organisation]] consisting of followers of [[Leon Trotsky]], or [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]], with the declared goal of helping the working class overthrow [[capitalism]] and work toward [[world communism|international communism]]. The Fourth International was established in France in 1938 as Trotsky and his supporters, having been expelled from the [[Soviet Union]], considered the [[Third International]] or [[Comintern]] to have become lost to [[Stalinism]] and incapable of leading the [[proletarian internationalism|international working class]] to political power.&lt;ref name="transitional"&gt;''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1938/tp/index.htm The Transitional Program]''. Retrieved November 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Trotskyists founded their own competing Fourth International.

Today, there is no longer a single cohesive Fourth International. Throughout the better part of its existence, the Fourth International was hounded by agents of the [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|Soviet secret police]], repressed by capitalist countries such as France and the United States and rejected by followers of the Soviet Union and later [[Maoism]] as illegitimate. It struggled to maintain contact under these conditions of illegality and repression around much of the world during [[World War II]] because when workers' uprisings did occur they were often under the influence of Soviet-inspired, [[Anarchism|anarchist]], [[Social democracy|social democratic]], Maoist, or militant nationalist groups, leading to defeats for the FI and its Trotskyists, who seldom gathered similar support.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Mandel]], ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1976/xx/trots-ww2.htm Trotskyists and the Resistance in World War Two]''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, many parts of the world, including Latin America, Europe and Asia, continue to have large Trotskyist groupings who are attracted to its [[Anti-Stalinist left|anti-Stalinist]] positions and its defense of workers' internationalism. Quite a few of these groups carry the label Fourth Internationalist either in their organisation's name, major political position documents, or both.

In line with its Trotskyist underpinnings, the Fourth International tended to view the Comintern as [[deformed workers' state|worthy of conditional support even considering its corruption]] and although it regarded its own ideas as more advanced and thus superior to those of the Third International, it did not actively seek the Comintern's destruction. It does not operate as a cohesive entity in the manner of the prior internationals. The FI suffered a major split in 1940 and an even more significant split in 1953. A partial reunification occurred in 1963, but the international never recovered enough to re-emerge as a single transnational grouping. Trotskyists' response to that situation has been in the form of its many [[List of Trotskyist internationals|Internationals]], with some divided over ideas of which organisation represents the true political continuity of the Fourth International.

== Trotskyism ==
{{Trotskyism}}
{{main|Trotskyism|Left Opposition}}
Trotskyists regard themselves as working in opposition to both capitalism and Stalinism. Trotsky advocated [[proletariat|proletarian]] revolution as set out in his theory of "[[permanent revolution]]", and believed that a [[Socialist state|workers' state]] would not be able to hold out against the pressures of a hostile capitalist world unless [[communist revolution|socialist revolution]]s quickly took hold in other countries as well. This theory was advanced in opposition to the view held by the Stalinists that "[[Socialism in One Country|socialism in one country]]" could be built in the [[Soviet Union]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Trotsky]], ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1932/11/oct.htm In Defence of October]''&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Trotsky and his supporters harshly criticised the increasingly [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] nature of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s rule. They argued that socialism without democracy is impossible. Thus, faced with the increasing lack of democracy in the Soviet Union, they concluded that it was no longer a socialist workers' state, but a [[degenerated workers' state]].&lt;ref name="transitional" /&gt;

Trotsky and his supporters had been organised since 1923 as the [[Left Opposition]]. They opposed the [[bureaucratisation]] of the Soviet Union, which they analysed as being partly caused by the poverty and isolation of the [[economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet economy]].&lt;ref name="Comintern" /&gt; Stalin's theory of socialism in one country was developed in 1924 as an opposition to Trotsky's Theory of [[Permanent revolution|Permanent Revolution]], which argued that capitalism was a world system and required a [[world revolution]] in order to replace it with socialism. Prior to 1924, the [[Bolshevik]]s' international perspective had been guided by Trotsky's position. Trotsky argued that Stalin's theory represented the interests of bureaucratic elements in direct opposition to the working class.

Eventually, Trotsky was sent into internal exile and his supporters were jailed. However, the Left Opposition continued to work in secret within the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Serge, Victor, ''From Lenin to Stalin'', p70 ff, Pathfinder, (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Trotsky was eventually exiled to Turkey. He moved from there to France, Norway and finally to Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Deutscher, Isaac, ''Stalin'', p381, Pelican (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; He was assassinated on Stalin's orders in Mexico by [[Ramón Mercader]], a Spanish-born Soviet agent in August 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment'', Oxford University Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0-19-507132-8}}, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political internationals ==
A [[political international]] is an organisation of political parties or activists with the aim of co-ordinating their activity for a common purpose. There had been a long tradition of socialists organising on an international basis, and [[Karl Marx]] had led the [[International Workingmen's Association]], which later became known as the "first international".

After the International Workingmen's Association disbanded in 1876, several attempts were made to revive the organisation, culminating in the formation of the Socialist International ([[Second International]]) in 1889. This was disbanded in 1916 following disagreements over [[World War I]]. Although the organisation reformed in 1923 as the [[Socialist International|Labour and Socialist International]], supporters of the [[October Revolution]] and the Bolsheviks had already set up the [[Communist International]] (Comintern), which they regarded as the Third International.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.marxists.org/history/international/index.htm Working-class Internationalism &amp; Organisation]''&lt;/ref&gt; This was organised on a [[Democratic centralism|democratic centralist]] basis, with component parties required to fight for policies adopted by the body as a whole.

By declaring themselves the Fourth International, the "World Party of Socialist Revolution", the Trotskyists were publicly asserting their continuity with the Comintern, and with its predecessors. Their recognition of the importance of these earlier Internationals was coupled with a belief that they eventually degenerated. Although the Socialist International and Comintern were still in existence, the Trotskyists did not believe those organisations were capable of supporting revolutionary socialism and [[proletarian internationalism|internationalism]].&lt;ref name="Comintern"&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1938-1949/ww/1943-ww04.htm "Manifesto of the Fourth International on the Dissolution of the Comintern"], ''Fourth International'', July 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation of the Fourth International was therefore spurred in part by a desire to form a stronger political current, rather than being seen as the communist opposition to the Comintern and the Soviet Union. Trotsky believed that its formation was all the more urgent for the role he saw it playing in the impending [[World War II|World War]].&lt;ref name="transitional" /&gt;

== Decision to form the International ==
In the early 1930s, Trotsky and his supporters believed that Stalin's influence over the Third International could still be fought from within and slowly rolled back. They organised themselves into the International Left Opposition in 1930, which was intended to be a group of anti-Stalinist dissenters ''within'' the Third International. Stalin's supporters, who dominated the International, would no longer tolerate dissent. All Trotskyists, and those suspected of being influenced by Trotskyism, were expelled.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Stalin]], [http://www.marx2mao.com/Stalin/ICRD28.html "Industrialisation of the country and the right deviation in the C.P.S.U.(B.)"], ''Works'', Vol.11, pp. 255-302.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotsky claimed that the [[Third Period]] policies of the Comintern had contributed to the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] in Germany, and that its turn to a [[popular front]] policy (aiming to unite all ostensibly [[anti-fascist]] forces) sowed illusions in [[reformism]] and [[pacifism]] and "clear[ed] the road for a fascist overturn". By 1935 he claimed that the Comintern had fallen irredeemably into the hands of the Stalinist bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leon Trotsky]], [http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1935/xx/fi.htm "Open Letter For The Fourth International"], ''New Militant'', August 3, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; He and his supporters, expelled from the Third International, participated in a conference of the [[London Bureau]] of socialist parties outside both the Socialist International and the Comintern. Three of those parties joined the Left Opposition in signing a document written by Trotsky calling for a Fourth International, which became known as the "Declaration of Four".&lt;ref&gt;[http://marx.org/history/etol/document/1930s/four.htm "Declaration of the Four"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718092851/http://marx.org/history/etol/document/1930s/four.htm |date=2011-07-18 }}, ''The Militant'', September 23, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; Of those, two soon distanced themselves from the agreement, but the Dutch [[Revolutionary Socialist Party (Netherlands)|Revolutionary Socialist Party]] worked with the International Left Opposition to declare the International Communist League.&lt;ref name="rocky"&gt;[[George Breitman]], ''[http://www.bolshevik.org/history/Tr-breit.htm The Rocky Road to the Fourth International, 1933–38]''&lt;/ref&gt;

This position was contested by [[Andrés Nin]] and some other members of the League who did not support the call for a new International. This group prioritised regroupment with other communist oppositions, principally the [[International Communist Opposition]] (ICO), linked to the [[Right Opposition]] in the Soviet Party, a regroupment which eventually led to the formation of the [[International Bureau for Revolutionary Socialist Unity]]. Trotsky considered those organisations to be [[Centrist Marxism|centrist]]. Despite Trotsky, the Spanish section merged with the Spanish section of ICO, forming the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification ([[POUM]]). Trotsky claimed the merger was to be a capitulation to centrism.&lt;ref&gt;John G. Wright, [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/wright/1946/08/trotsky.htm "Trotsky's Struggle for the Fourth International"], ''Fourth International'', August 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Socialist Workers' Party of Germany]], a left split from the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] founded in 1931, co-operated with the International Left Opposition briefly in 1933 but soon abandoned the call for a new International.

In 1935, Trotsky wrote an ''Open Letter for the Fourth International'', reaffirming the ''Declaration of Four'', while documenting the recent course of the Comintern and the Socialist International. In the letter, he called for the urgent formation of a Fourth International.&lt;ref name="rocky" /&gt; The "First International Conference for the Fourth International" was held in Paris in June 1936, reports giving its location as [[Geneva]] for security reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workersrepublic.org/Pages/Ireland/Trotskyism/clrjames.html CLR James Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; This meeting dissolved the International Communist League, founding in its place the Movement for the Fourth International on Trotsky's perspectives.

The foundation of the Fourth International was seen as more than just the simple renaming of an international tendency that was already in existence. It was argued that the Third International had now degenerated completely and was therefore to be seen as a [[counter-revolutionary]] organisation that would in time of crisis defend capitalism. Trotsky believed that the coming [[World War II|World War]] would produce a [[revolutionary wave]] of class and national struggles, rather as [[World War I]] had done.&lt;ref name="transitional" /&gt;

Stalin reacted to the growing strength of Trotsky's supporters with a major political massacre of people within the Soviet Union, and the assassination of Trotsky's supporters and family abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/isr/vol24/no3/vorkuta.htm "Trotskyists at Vorkuta: An Eyewitness Report"], ''International Socialist Review'', Summer 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; He had agents go through historical documents and photos in order to attempt to erase Trotsky's memory from the history books.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.pbs.org/redfiles/prop/inv/prop_inv_ins.htm Propaganda in the Propaganda State]'', [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian Mario Kessler, Stalin's supporters turned to [[anti-semitism]] to whip up sentiment against Trotsky (as Trotsky was a Jew).&lt;ref&gt;Mario Kessler, [http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Newint/Kessler.html "Leon Trotsky's Position on Anti-Semitism, Zionism and the Perspectives of the Jewish Question"], ''New Interventions'', Vol. 5 No. 2, 1994 (transcript of a talk at the AGM of ''[[Revolutionary History]]'' magazine in October 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin's daughter later claimed that his fight with Trotsky laid the foundations for his later anti-semitic campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Beichman, ''[http://washingtontimes.com/books/20030816-105043-6895r.htm "How Stalin, the 'breaker of nations,' hated, murdered Jews"]'', ''[[Washington Times]]'', August 16, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founding Congress ==
The International's rationale was to construct new mass revolutionary parties able to lead successful workers' revolutions. It saw these arising from a revolutionary wave which would develop alongside and as a result of the coming World War. Thirty delegates attended a founding conference, held in September 1938, in the home of [[Alfred Rosmer]] just outside Paris. Present at the meeting were delegates from all the major countries of Europe, and from North America, although for reasons of cost and distance, few delegates attended from Asia or Latin America. An International Secretariat was established, with many of the day's leading Trotskyists and most countries in which Trotskyists were active represented.&lt;ref&gt;M. S., [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1938-1949/fi-1stcongress/ch01.htm "Foreword"], ''Founding Conference of the Fourth International]''&lt;/ref&gt; Among the resolutions adopted by the conference was the ''[[The Death Agony of Capitalism and the Tasks of the Fourth International|Transitional Programme]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Socialist Workers Party (US)|Socialist Workers Party]], ''[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1938-1949/fi-1stcongress/ ''The Founding Conference of the Fourth International]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Transitional Programme'' was the central programmatic statement of the congress, summarising its strategic and tactical conceptions for the revolutionary period that it saw opening up as a result of the war which Trotsky had been predicting for some years. It is not, however, the definitive programme of the Fourth International{{spaced ndash}} as is often suggested{{spaced ndash}} but instead contains a summation of the conjunctural understanding of the movement at that date and a series of transitional policies designed to develop the struggle for workers' power.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlie van Gelderen]], [http://www.isg-fi.org.uk/spip.php?article206 Sixty years of the Fourth International] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928032352/http://www.isg-fi.org.uk/spip.php?article206 |date=2008-09-28 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Price ''[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/transprog/wa01.htm The Transitional Programme in perspective]''&lt;/ref&gt;

== World War II ==
At the outbreak of [[World War II]], in 1939, the International Secretariat was moved to New York City. The resident International Executive Committee failed to meet, largely because of a struggle in the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|U.S. Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) between Trotsky's supporters and the tendency of [[Max Shachtman]], [[Martin Abern]] and [[James Burnham]]. The secretariat was composed of those committee members who happened to be in the city, most of whom were co-thinkers of Shachtman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1938-1949/emergconf/fi-emerg03.htm "Declaration on the status of the resident International Executive Committee"], in ''Documents of the Fourth International'', Vol. 1, pp. 351–355&lt;/ref&gt; The disagreement centred on the [[Shachtmanism|Shachtmanite]]s' disagreements with the SWP's internal policy,&lt;ref name="decline"&gt;[[Duncan Hallas]], ''[http://listserv.cddc.vt.edu/marxists/cd/cd1/Library/archive/hallas/works/1973/xx/fidecline.htm Fourth International in Decline] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080220223000/http://listserv.cddc.vt.edu/marxists/cd/cd1/Library/archive/hallas/works/1973/xx/fidecline.htm |date=2008-02-20 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; and over the FI's unconditional defence of the USSR.&lt;ref&gt;[[Trotsky]], ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/idom/dm/index.htm In Defense of Marxism]'', New York 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotsky opened a public debate with Shachtman and Burnham and developed his positions in a series of polemics written in 1939–1940 and later collected in ''[[Leon Trotsky|In Defense of Marxism]]''. Shachtman and Burnham's tendency resigned from the International in early 1940, alongside almost 40% of the SWP's members, many of whom became founder members of the [[Workers Party (US)|Workers Party]].&lt;ref name="factional"&gt;[[James P. Cannon]], [http://www.marxists.org/archive/cannon/works/1953/facstrug.htm "Factional Struggle And Party Leadership"], ''Fourth International'', November 1953; David Holmes, ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/cannon/bio/index.htm James P. Cannon: His Life and Work]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emergency conference ===
In May 1940 an emergency conference of the International met at a secret location "somewhere in the Western Hemisphere". It adopted a manifesto drafted by Trotsky shortly before his murder and a range of policies on the work of the International, including one calling for the reunification of the then-divided Fourth Internationalist groups in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1938-1949/emergconf "Emergency Conference of the Fourth International"], ''International Bulletin'', Nos. 1 &amp; 2, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secretariat members who had supported Shachtman were expelled by the emergency conference, with the support of Trotsky himself.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;[[Michel Pablo]], [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1938-1949/fi-2ndcongress/1948-congress01.htm "Report on the Fourth International Since the Outbreak of War, 1939–48"] ''Fourth International'', December 1948 &amp; January 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; While leader of the SWP [[James P. Cannon]] later said that he did not believe the split to be definitive and final, the two groups did not reunite.&lt;ref name="factional" /&gt; A new International Executive Committee was appointed, which came under the increasing influence of the [[Socialist Workers Party (US)|Socialist Workers Party]].&lt;ref name="report" /&gt;

The Fourth International was hit hard during World War II. Trotsky was assassinated, many of the FI's European affiliates were destroyed by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] and several of its Asian affiliates were destroyed by the [[Empire of Japan]]. The survivors, in Europe, Asia and elsewhere, were largely cut off from each other and from the International Secretariat. The new secretary, [[Jean Van Heijenoort]] (also known as Gerland), was able to do little more than publish articles in the SWP's theoretical journal ''Fourth International''.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; Despite this dislocation, the various groups sought to maintain links and some connections were kept up throughout the early part of the war by sailors enlisted in the [[U.S. Navy]] who had cause to visit [[Marseilles]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodolphe Prager]], [http://www.revolutionary-history.co.uk/backiss/Vol1/No3/Prager.html "The Fourth International during the Second World War"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227134205/http://revolutionary-history.co.uk/backiss/Vol1/No3/Prager.html |date=2005-12-27 }}, ''Revolutionary History, Vol. 1 No. 3, Autumn 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Contact was steady, if irregular, between the SWP and the British Trotskyists, with the result that the Americans exerted what influence they had to encourage the [[Workers' International League (1937)|Workers' International League]] into the International through a fusion with the [[Revolutionary Socialist League (UK, 1938)|Revolutionary Socialist League]], a union that had been requested by the Emergency Conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1938-1949/emergconf/fi-emerg07.htm "Resolution On The Unification of the British Section"], ''International Bulletin'', Nos. 1 &amp; 2, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, a debate on the [[national question]] in Europe opened up between the majority of the SWP and a movement led by Van Heijenoort, [[Albert Goldman (politician)|Albert Goldman]] and [[Felix Morrow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1938-1949/ww/index.htm The Fourth International During World War II (immediately afterward)].&lt;/ref&gt; This minority anticipated that the Nazi dictatorship would be replaced with capitalism rather than by a socialist revolution, leading to the revival of [[Stalinism]] and [[social democracy]]. In December 1943, they criticised the SWP's view as underestimating the rising prestige of Stalinism and the opportunities for the capitalists to use democratic concessions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Felix Morrow]], [http://www.marxists.org/archive/morrow-felix/1943/12/criticism.htm "The First Phase of the Coming European Revolution"], ''Fourth International'', December 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; The SWP's central committee argued that democratic capitalism could not revive, resulting in either military dictatorship by the capitalists or a workers' revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1938-1949/ww/1943-ww05.htm "Perspectives and Tasks of the Coming European Revolution"], ''Fourth International'', December 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; It held that this would reinforce the need for building the Fourth International, and adhered rigidly to their interpretation of Trotsky's works.

=== European Conference ===
[[File:fourthinternational.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The ''Fourth International'' magazine]]
The wartime debate about post-war perspectives was accelerated by the resolution of the February 1944 European Conference of the Fourth International. The conference appointed a new European Secretariat and elected [[Michel Raptis]], a Greek resident in France also known as Michel Pablo, the organisational secretary of its European Bureau. Raptis and other bureau members re-established contact between the Trotskyist parties. The European conference extended the lessons of a revolution then unfolding in Italy, and concluded that a revolutionary wave would cross Europe as the war ended.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1938-1949/ww/1945-ww02.htm "Theses on the Liquidation of World War II and the Revolutionary Upsurge"], ''Fourth International'', March &amp; May 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; The SWP had a similar perspective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1938-1949/ww/1944-ww07.htm "The European Revolution and the Tasks of the Revolutionary Party"], ''Fourth International'', December 1944.&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Revolutionary Communist Party (1944-1949)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] (RCP) disagreed and held that capitalism was not about to plunge into massive crisis but rather that an upturn in the economy was already underway.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Upham, ''[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/revhist/upham/12upham.html The History of British Trotskyism to 1949]'' (PhD thesis publische online on the ''[[Revolutionary History]]'' Website).&lt;/ref&gt; A group of leaders of the French [[Internationalist Communist Party]] (PCI) around [[Yvan Craipeau]] argued a similar position until they were expelled from the PCI in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schwarz, [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/may2004/lft4-m22.shtml "The politics of opportunism: the 'radical left' in France"], ''World Socialist Web Site''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International conference ===
In April 1946 delegates from the principal European sections and a number of others attended a "Second International Congress".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1938-1949/fi-2ndconf/1946-conf02.htm "The Conference of the Fourth International"], ''Fourth International'', June 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; This set about rebuilding the International Secretariat of the Fourth International with Michel Raptis appointed Secretary and [[Ernest Mandel]], a Belgian, taking a leading role.

Pablo and Mandel aimed to counter the opposition of the majorities inside the British Revolutionary Communist Party and French Internationalist Communist Party. Initially, they encouraged party members to vote out their leaderships. They supported [[Gerry Healy]]'s opposition in the RCP. In France, they backed elements, including [[Pierre Frank]] and [[Marcel Bleibtreu]], opposed to the new leadership of the PCI{{spaced ndash}} albeit for differing reasons.&lt;ref name="War"&gt;[[Sam Bornstein]] and [[Al Richardson (historian)|Al Richardson]], ''War and the International'', London 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stalinist occupation of Eastern Europe was the issue of prime concern, and it raised many problems of interpretation. At first, the International held that, while the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] was a [[degenerated workers' state]], the post-World War II East European states were still [[bourgeois]] entities, because revolution from above was not possible, and capitalism persisted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alex Callinicos]], ''[http://www.marxists.de/trotism/callinicos/2-2_crisis.htm Trotskyism]'', Maidenhead 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue that needed to be dealt with was the possibility that the economy would revive. This was initially denied by Mandel (who was quickly forced to revise his opinion, and later devoted his PhD dissertation to [[late capitalism]], analysing the unexpected "third age" of capitalist development). Mandel's perspective mirrored uncertainty at that time about the future viability and prospects of capitalism, not just among ''all'' Trotskyist groups, but also among leading economists. [[Paul Samuelson]] had envisaged in 1943 the probability of a "nightmarish combination of the worst features of inflation and [[deflation]]", worrying that "there would be ushered in the greatest period of unemployment and industrial dislocation which any economy has ever faced".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Samuelson, "Full Employment after the war," in S. Harris (ed.), ''Post war Economic Problems'', London &amp; New York 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Schumpeter]] for his part claimed that "[t]he general opinion seems to be that capitalist methods will be unequal to the task of reconstruction". He regarded it as "not open to doubt that the decay of capitalist society is very far advanced".&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Schumpeter, "Capitalism in the post-war world". in S. Harris (ed.), ''Post war Economic Problems'', London &amp; New York 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Second World Congress ==
The Second World Congress in April 1948 was attended by delegates from 22 sections. It debated a range of resolutions on the [[Jewish Question]], Stalinism, the colonial countries and the specific situations facing sections in certain countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1938-1949/fi-2ndcongress/index.htm 2nd Congress of the Fourth International]&lt;/ref&gt; By this point the FI was united around the view that the Eastern European "[[buffer state]]s" were still capitalist countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1938-1949/fi-2ndcongress/1948-congress02.htm "The USSR and Stalinism"], ''Fourth International'', June 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congress was especially notable for bringing the International into much closer contact with Trotskyist groups from across the globe. These included such significant groups as the [[Revolutionary Workers' Party (Bolivia)|Revolutionary Workers' Party]] of [[Bolivia]] and the [[Lanka Sama Samaja Party]] in what was then [[Ceylon]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.cddc.vt.edu/marxists/history/etol/document/fi/1950-1953/fi-3rdcongress/1951-congress12.htm "The Third World Congress of the Fourth International"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309045530/http://listserv.cddc.vt.edu/marxists/history/etol/document/fi/1950-1953/fi-3rdcongress/1951-congress12.htm |date=2006-03-09 }}, ''Fourth International'', November 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; but the previously large Vietnamese Trotskyist groups had mostly been eliminated or absorbed by the supporters of [[Ho Chi Minh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revolutionary-history.co.uk/backiss/Vol3/No2/Pirani.html "The Fourth International in Vietnam"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218092924/http://www.revolutionary-history.co.uk/backiss/Vol3/No2/Pirani.html |date=2006-02-18 }}, ''[[Revolutionary History]]'', Vol. 3 No. 2, Autumn 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Second World Congress in 1948, the International Secretariat attempted to open communications with [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s regime in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;International Secretariat of the Fourth International, [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/yugoslavia/yugo01.htm "An Open Letter to Congress, Central Committee and Members of the Yugoslav Communist Party"], ''Fourth International'', July 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; In their analysis, it differed from the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]] because it was established by the [[Partisan (military)|partisan]]s of World War II who had fought against Nazi occupation, as opposed to by Stalin's invading armies. The British RCP, led by [[Jock Haston]] and supported by [[Ted Grant]], were highly critical of this move.&lt;ref name="War" /&gt;

== Third World Congress ==
The Third World Congress in 1951 resolved that the economies of the East European states and their political regimes had come to resemble that of the USSR more and more. These states were then described as [[deformed workers state]]s in an analogy with the degenerated workers state in Russia. The term ''deformed'' was used rather than ''degenerated'', because no workers' revolution had led to the foundation of these states.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Frank]], [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/writers/frank/1951/08/eeurope.htm "Evolution of Eastern Europe"], ''Fourth International'', November 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Third World Congress envisaged the real possibility of an "international civil war" in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1950-1953/fi-3rdcongress/1951-congress06.htm "Theses on Orientation and Perspectives"], ''Fourth International, November 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; It argued that the mass Communist parties "may, under certain favourable conditions, go beyond the aims set for them by the Soviet bureaucracy and project a revolutionary orientation". Given the supposed closeness of war, the FI thought that the Communist Parties and social democratic parties would be the only significant force that could defend the workers of the world against the [[imperialist]] camp in those countries where there were mass forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1950-1953/fi-3rdcongress/1951-congress07.htm "The International Situation and Tasks in the Struggle against Imperialist War"], ''Fourth International'', November 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with this geopolitical perspective, Pablo argued that the only way the Trotskyists could avoid isolation was for various sections of the Fourth International to undertake long-term [[entryism]] in the mass Communist or Social Democratic parties.&lt;ref name="rearms"&gt;[[Michel Pablo]], [http://www.marxists.org/archive/pablo/1951/11/congress.htm "World Trotskism Rearms"], ''Fourth International'', November 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; This tactic was known as entrism ''sui generis'', to distinguish it from the short-term entry tactic employed before World War II. For example, it meant that the project of building an open and independent Trotskyist party was shelved in France, because it was regarded as not politically feasible alongside entry into the French Communist Party.

This perspective was accepted within the Fourth International, yet sowed the seeds for the split in 1953. At the Third World Congress, the sections agreed with the perspective of an international civil war. The French section disagreed with the associated tactic of [[entryism]] sui generis, and held that Pablo was underestimating the independent role of the working class parties in the Fourth International. The leaders of the majority of the Trotskyist organisation in France, Marcel Bleibtreu and [[Pierre Lambert]], refused to follow the line of the International. The International leadership had them replaced by a minority, leading to a permanent split in the French section.&lt;ref name="letters"&gt;''[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1950-1953/ic-issplit/05.htm Letters exchanged between Daniel Renard and James P. Cannon, February 16 and May 9, 1952]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the World Congress, the line of the International Leadership was generally accepted by groups around the world, including the U.S. SWP whose leader, James P. Cannon, corresponded with the French majority to support the tactic of entrism ''sui generis''.&lt;ref name="letters" /&gt; At the same time, however, Cannon, Healy and Mandel were deeply concerned by Pablo's political evolution. Cannon and Healy were also alarmed by Pablo's intervention into the French section, and by suggestions that Pablo might use the International's authority in this way in other sections of the Fourth International that felt entrism "sui generis" was not a suitable tactic in their own countries. In particular, minority tendencies, exemplified in Britain by [[John Lawrence (political activist)|John Lawrence]] and in the U.S. by [[Bert Cochran]], to support entrism "sui generis" hinted that Pablo's support for their views indicated that the International might also demand Trotskyists in those countries adopt that tactic.&lt;ref&gt;''International Committee Documents 1951–1954, Vol. 1'', Section 4, (Education for Socialists)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formation of the International Committee of the Fourth International ==
In 1953, the SWP's national committee issued an ''Open Letter to Trotskyists Throughout the World''&lt;ref name="SWP"&gt;SWP, [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/swp-us/doc01.htm "Open Letter to Trotskyists Throughout the World"], ''Militant'', November 16, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; and organised the [[International Committee of the Fourth International]] (ICFI). This was a public faction which initially included, in addition to the SWP, [[Gerry Healy]]'s British section [[The Club (Trotskyist)|The Club]], the Internationalist Communist Party in France (then led by [[Pierre Lambert|Lambert]] who had expelled Bleibtreu and his grouping), [[Nahuel Moreno]]'s party in Argentina and the Austrian and Chinese sections of the FI. The sections of the ICFI withdrew from the International Secretariat, which suspended their voting rights. Both sides claimed they constituted a majority of the former International.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1950-1953/ic-issplit/16.htm "Resolution forming the International Committee"], ''SWP Internal Bulletin''; [[Michel Pablo]], [[Pierre Frank]] and [[Ernest Germain]], [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1953-1963/ic/1955/ic01.htm "Letter from the Bureau of the IS to the leaderships of all sections", November 15, 1953], ''Education for Socialists Bulletin''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sri Lanka's Lanka Sama Samaja Party, then the country's leading workers' party, took a middle position during this dispute. It continued to participate in the ISFI but argued for a joint congress, for reunification with the ICFI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/nov2003/dnor-n21.shtml "David North addresses Sri Lankan Trotskyists on the 50th anniversary of the ICFI"], ''[[World Socialist Web Site]]'', November 21, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

An excerpt from the ''Open Letter'' explains the split as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To sum up: The lines of cleavage between Pablo's revisionism and orthodox Trotskyism are so deep that no compromise is possible either politically or organizationally. The Pablo faction has demonstrated that it will not permit democratic decisions truly reflecting majority opinion to be reached. They demand complete submission to their criminal policy. They are determined to drive all [[Orthodox Trotskyism|orthodox Trotskyists]] out of the Fourth International or to muzzle and handcuff them.

Their scheme has been to inject their Stalinist conciliationism piecemeal and likewise in piecemeal fashion, get rid of those who come to see what is happening and raise objections.&lt;ref name="SWP"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== From the Fourth World Congress to reunification ==
Over the following decade, the IC referred to the rest of the International as the "International Secretariat of the Fourth International", emphasising its view that the Secretariat did not speak for the International as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1950-1953/ic-issplit/01.htm "Resolution of the International Committee instructing publication of the documents", August 24, 1973], ''[[News Line|Workers Press]]'', August 29, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretariat continued to view itself as the leadership of the International. It held a Fourth World Congress in 1954 to regroup and to recognise reorganised sections in Britain, France and the U.S.

Parts of the International Committee were divided over whether the split with "Pabloism" was permanent or temporary,&lt;ref&gt;International Secretariat: [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/fi/1953-1963/ic/1955/ic01.htm "To all Members and All Organizations of the International Committee"], ''Education for Socialists Bulletin''.&lt;/ref&gt; and it was perhaps as a result of this that it did not declare itself to be ''the'' Fourth International. Those sections that considered the split permanent embarked on a discussion about the history of the split and its meanings.

The sections of the International that recognised the leadership of the International Secretariat remained optimistic about the possibilities for increasing the International's political influence and extended the [[entrism]] into [[social democratic parties]] which was already underway in Britain, Austria and elsewhere. The 1954 congress emphasised entrism into [[Communist party|communist parties]] and nationalist parties in the colonies, pressing for democratic reforms, ostensibly to encourage the left-wing they perceived to exist in the communist parties to join with them in a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pablo]], [https://www.marxists.org/archive/pablo/1953/xx/newcourse.htm "The Post-Stalin 'New Course'"], ''Fourth International'', March 1953; ''[[Michel Pablo]], ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/pablo/1958/fi/index.htm The 4th International: What it is, What it aims at]'', Publications of the Fourth International, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; Tensions developed between those who subscribed to the mainstream views of Pablo and a minority that argued unsuccessfully against open work. A number of these delegates walked out of the World Congress, and would eventually leave the International, including the leader of the new British section, [[John GM Lawrence|John Lawrence]], [[George Clarke (socialist)|George Clarke]], [[Michele Mestre]] (a leader of the French section), and [[Murray Dowson]] (a leader of the Canadian group).&lt;ref&gt;John McIlroy, [http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/Back/Wnext26/Lawrence.html "The Revolutionary Odyssey of John Lawrence"], ''What Next'', No. 26, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Secretariat organised a Fifth World Congress in October 1957. Mandel and [[Pierre Frank]] appraised the [[Algerian revolution]] and surmised that it was essential to reorient in the colonial states and neocolonies towards the emerging [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]]-led revolutions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Frank]], [http://marxists.org/history/etol/writers/frank/works/march/ch07.htm The Fourth International: The Long March of the Trotskyists]'', London 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Robert Alexander, Ernest Mandel has written that an organisation in Indonesia, the Partai Acoma, was affiliate to the FI from 1959 until the 1965 coup in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Alexander https://books.google.com/books?id=_eUtQjseKaIC&amp;lpg=PA534&amp;ots=AdRQT__QNJ&amp;dq=%22Fourth%20International%22%20%22tan%20malaka%22&amp;pg=PA534#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Fourth%20International%22%20%22tan%20malaka%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sixth World Congress in 1961 marked a lessening of the political divisions between the majority of supporters of the International Secretariat and the leadership of the SWP in the United States. In particular, the congress stressed support for the [[Cuban revolution]] and a growing emphasis on building parties in the imperialist countries. The sixth congress also criticised the Lanka Sama Samaja Party, its Sri Lankan section, for seeming to support the [[Sri Lanka Freedom Party]], which they saw as bourgeois nationalists; the U.S. SWP made similar criticisms.&lt;ref name="cuban"&gt;[http://www.whatnextjournal.co.uk/Pages/History/Cuba.html "Trotskyism and the Cuban Revolution: A Debate"], ''Intercontinental Press'', May 11, 1981, on the ''What Next?'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 the IC and IS formed a Parity Commission to organise a common World Congress. The supporters of Michel Pablo and [[J. Posadas|Juan Posadas]] opposed the convergence. The supporters of Posadas left the International in 1962.&lt;ref name="cuban" /&gt; At the 1963 reunification congress, the sections of the IC and IS reunified (with two exceptions: the British and French sections of the IC).&lt;ref name="Farrell"&gt;[[Farrell Dobbs]] and [[Joseph Hansen (socialist)|Joseph Hansen]], [http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/swp-us/reunif.htm Reunification of the Fourth International]'', International Socialist Review 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; This was largely a result of their mutual support for Ernest Mandel and [[Joseph Hansen (socialist)|Joseph Hansen]]'s resolution ''Dynamics of World Revolution Today'' and for the [[Cuban Revolution]]. This document distinguished between different revolutionary tasks in the imperialist countries, the "[[workers' state]]s", and the colonial and semi-colonial countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Mandel]] and [[Joseph Hansen (socialist)|Joseph Hansen]], [http://www.trotskyism.org/document/fi/1963-1985/usfi/7thWC/usfi01.htm "Dynamics of World Revolution Today"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728130440/http://www.trotskyism.org/document/fi/1963-1985/usfi/7thWC/usfi01.htm |date=2011-07-28 }}, International Socialist Review, Fall 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, the reunified [[Fourth International (1963)|Fourth International]] elected a United Secretariat of the Fourth International (USFI), by which name the organisation as a whole is often still referred.

== Since reunification ==
{{main|Fourth International (Post-Reunification)}}
Since the 1963 reunification, a number of approaches have developed within international Trotskyism towards the Fourth International.
* The reunified [[Fourth International (Post-Reunification)|Fourth International]] is the only current with direct organisational continuity to the original Fourth International at an international level. The International Committee and International Secretariat reunified at the 1963 congress, but without the [[Socialist Labour League]] and [[Internationalist Communist Organisation]].&lt;ref name="Farrell"/&gt; It is sometimes known as the United Secretariat of the Fourth International (USFI) after the name of its leading committee, although that committee was replaced in 2003. It is also the only current to have continuously presented itself as "the" Fourth International. It is the largest current and leaders of some other Trotskyist Internationals occasionally refer to it as "the Fourth International": ICFI secretary Gerry Healy, when proposing reunification discussions in the 1970s, described it as "the Fourth International";&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerry Healy]], "Letter to the Fourth International", in ''Marxism vs. ultraleftism : the record of Healy’s break with Trotskyism''. Edited by [[Joseph Hansen (socialist)|Joseph Hansen]]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Socialist Tendency]] also usually refers to it in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alex Callinicos]], [http://www.istendency.net/pdf/Regroupment.pdf "Regroupment, Realignment, and the Revolutionary Left"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515220747/http://www.istendency.net/pdf/Regroupment.pdf |date=2006-05-15 }}, ''IST Discussion Bulletin'', No. 1, July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[International Committee of the Fourth International]] member groups customarily describe themselves as sections of the Fourth International, and the organisation as a whole describes itself as the "leadership of the Fourth International".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/sections/category/icfi/icfi.shtml "About the International Committee of the Fourth International"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515211600/http://www.wsws.org/sections/category/icfi/icfi.shtml |date=2006-05-15 }}, ''[[World Socialist Web Site]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ICFI presents itself as the ''political continuity'' of the Fourth International and Trotskyism, not as the FI itself. It clearly dates its creation as 1953, rather than from 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schwarz, [http://www.wsws.org/articles/2003/dec2003/pets-d06.shtml "Meetings on 50 years of the International Committee of the Fourth International"], ''World Socialist Web Site''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some tendencies argue that the Fourth International became dislocated politically during the years between Trotsky's murder and the establishment of the ICFI in 1953; they consequently work to "reconstruct", "reorganise" or "rebuild" it. This view originated with [[Lutte Ouvriere]] and the [[international Spartacist tendency]] and is shared by others who diverged from the ICFI. For example, the [[Committee for a Workers' International]], whose founders dropped out of the reunified FI after 1965, call for a new "revolutionary Fourth International".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Taaffe]], ''[http://www.socialistworld.net/publications/history2/p13.html A Socialist World is Possible: The history of the CWI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050722085553/http://www.socialistworld.net/publications/history2/p13.html |date=2005-07-22 }}'', [[Committee for a Workers' International]].&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the [[Fourth International (ICR)]] reproclaimed the Fourth International at a congress attended by ICR sections in June 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225451/http://www.socialistorganizer.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=53 "Manifesto of the 4th World Congress"], on the ''[[Socialist Organizer]]'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Other Trotskyist groups argue that the Fourth International is dead. They call for the establishment of a new "workers' international" or a [[Fifth International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifthinternational.org/LFIfiles/LFIcallfor5th.html "Forward to the Fifth International!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519122015/http://www.fifthinternational.org/LFIfiles/LFIcallfor5th.html |date=2006-05-19 }}, on the [[League for the Fifth International]] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
In uniting the large majority of Trotskyists in one organisation, the Fourth International created a tradition which has since been claimed by many Trotskyist organisations.

Echoing Marx's ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'', the ''Transitional Programme'' ended with the declaration "Workers{{spaced ndash}} men and women{{spaced ndash}} of all countries, place yourselves under the banner of the Fourth International. It is the banner of your approaching victory!". It declared demands to be placed on capitalists, opposition to the bureaucracy in the Soviet Union, and support for workers' action against fascism.&lt;ref name="transitional" /&gt; Most of the demands on capitalists remain unfulfilled. The collapse of the Soviet Union occurred, but through a [[social revolution]] leading to the restoration of capitalism, rather than the [[political revolution]] proposed by the Trotskyists. Many Trotskyist groups have been active in anti-fascist campaigns, but the Fourth International has never played a major role in the toppling of a regime.

Those groups which follow traditions that left the Fourth International in its early years argue that, despite initially correct positions, it had little impact. [[Lutte Ouvriere]] claims that it "did not survive the Second World War".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.union-communiste.org/?FR-archp-show-2003-1-515-2735-x.html "Les fondements programmatiques de notre politique"], ''Lutte de classe'', No. 77, December 2003. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Workers Liberty]], which follows in the [[third camp]] tradition established by the [[Workers Party (US)|Workers Party]], holds that "Trotsky and everything he represented was defeated and{{spaced ndash}} as we have to recognise in retrospect{{spaced ndash}} defeated for a whole historical period."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sean Matgamna]], [https://archive.is/20120918083831/http://www.workersliberty.org/node/4109 "What we are, what we do and why we do it"] , ''Solidarity'' 3/72, April 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other groups point to a positive impact. The ICFI claim that "the [early] Fourth International consisted mainly of cadres who remained true to their aims"&lt;ref&gt;Peter Schwarz, ''[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/jun2004/left-j04.shtml "The politics of opportunism: the 'radical left' in France"], ''World Socialist Web Site''.&lt;/ref&gt; and describes much of the Fourth International's early activity as "correct and principled".&lt;ref&gt;[[David North (Socialist)|David North]], [http://www.wsws.org/polemics/1995/oct1995/mandel1.shtml "Ernest Mandel, 1923–1995: A critical assessment of his role in the history of the Fourth International"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626194635/http://wsws.org/polemics/1995/oct1995/mandel1.shtml |date=2006-06-26 }}, ''World Socialist Web Site''.&lt;/ref&gt; The reunified FI claim that "the Fourth International refused to compromise with capitalism either in its fascist or democratic variants." In its view, "many of the predictions made by Trotsky when he founded the Fourth International were proved wrong by history. But what was absolutely vindicated were his key political judgements."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isg-fi.org.uk/spip.php?rubrique5 "The Fourth International"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928032404/http://www.isg-fi.org.uk/spip.php?rubrique5 |date=2008-09-28 }}, [[International Socialist Group]] website.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:General Staff Building Eastern Wing.jpg|thumb|200px|Eastern Facade]]
The '''General Staff Building''' ({{lang-ru|Здание Главного штаба}}, ''Zdanie Glavnogo Shtaba'') is an edifice with a 580 m long bow-shaped facade, situated on [[Palace Square]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], in front of the [[Winter Palace]]. 

The monumental Neoclassical building was designed by [[Carlo Rossi (architect)|Carlo Rossi]] in the [[Empire style]] and built in 1819-1829. It consists of two wings, which are separated by a tripartite [[triumphal arch]] adorned by sculptors [[Stepan Pimenov]] and [[Vasily Demuth-Malinovsky]] and commemorating the Russian victory over [[Napoleonic France]] in the [[Patriotic War of 1812]]. The arch links Palace Square through Bolshaya Morskaya Street to [[Nevsky Prospekt]]. 

Until the capital was transferred to [[Moscow]] in 1918, the building served as the headquarters of the [[General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation|General Staff]] (western wing), [[Russian Foreign Ministry|Foreign Ministry]] and Finance Ministry (eastern wing). 

The western wing now hosts the headquarters of the [[Western Military District]]. The eastern wing was given to the [[Hermitage Museum]] in 1993 and was extensively remodeled inside.

The '''Hatton Gallery''' is [[Newcastle University]]'s [[art gallery]] in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[England]]. It is based in the University's [[Fine Art Building]].

The Hatton Gallery briefly closed in February 2016 for a £3.8 million redevelopment and reopened in 2017.

== History ==
[[File:Fineartbuildingnewcastle.jpg|thumb|The Fine Art Building of Newcastle University, home of the Hatton Gallery.]]
The Hatton Gallery was founded in 1925, by the [[Fine Art Building|King Edward VII School of Art]], Armstrong College, [[Durham University]] (Newcastle University's Department of Fine Art), in honour of Richard George Hatton, a professor at the School of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/hatton/ourhistory/ |title=History |publisher=Hatton Gallery |accessdate=20 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525203008/http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/hatton/ourhistory/ |archivedate=25 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]]'s seminal ''Man, Machine and Motion'' was first exhibited at the Hatton in 1955 before travelling to the ICA,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentgroup.org.uk/contributors/hamilton/index.html Richard Hamilton biography]&lt;/ref&gt; so the Hatton can claim to have been the birthplace of [[Pop Art]].

In 1997, the University authorities voted to close down the gallery, but a widespread public campaign against the closure, leading to a £250,000 donation by Dame [[Catherine Cookson]], ensured the survival of the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=/archive/1997/06/11/ngal11.html |title=Catherine Cookson throws lifeline to threatened gallery |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=11 June 1997 |accessdate=29 March 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207032509/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/htmlContent.jhtml?html=%2Farchive%2F1997%2F06%2F11%2Fngal11.html |archivedate=7 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Great North Museum]] project, the gallery's future is secure.  Unlike the university's other collections, the Hatton Gallery was not transferred into the Hancock, but remained in the [[Fine Art Building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/about/today/facilities/list/great+north+museum |title=Great North Museum |publisher=Newcastle University |accessdate=12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hatton Gallery closed on 27 February 2016 for a £3.8 million redevelopment and reopened in October 2017 with the exhibition Pioneers of Pop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twmuseums.org.uk/news/hatton-gallery-receives-green-light-for-redevelopment |title=Hatton Gallery receives green light for redevelopment |publisher=Tyne and Wear Archives and Museums |date=28 July 2015 |accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/sep/28/newcastle-hatton-gallery-reopen-pioneers-of-pop-art&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
The permanent collection comprises over 3,500 works, from the 14th century onward – including paintings, sculptures, prints and drawings&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newcastlegateshead.com/things-to-do/hatton-gallery-p24631&lt;/ref&gt; – and starring the ''Merzbarn'', the only surviving [[Merz (Art style)|Merz]] construction by [[Kurt Schwitters]], which was rescued from a barn near [[Elterwater]] in 1965&lt;ref&gt;[http://fredbrookes.co.uk/merzbarn_folder/moving_the_merzbarn.php Moving the Merzbarn - Fred Brooks]&lt;/ref&gt; and is now permanently installed in the gallery. 

Other important artists represented in the collection include [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]], [[Victor Pasmore]], [[William Roberts (painter)|William Roberts]] and [[Paolo di Giovanni Fei|Paolo di Giovanni]], [[Palma Giovane]], [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Panayiotis Kalorkoti]], [[Thomas Bewick]], [[Eduardo Paolozzi]], [[Camillo Procaccini]], [[Patrick Heron]] and [[Richard Ansdell]].

[[File:South_face_of_the_Waterloo_Barracks,_Tower_of_London,_2009.jpg|thumb|Waterloo Barracks, site of the museum]]
The '''Heralds' Museum''' was a museum of [[heraldry]] run by the [[College of Arms Trust]] at the [[Tower of London]] during the 1980s. It was situated in the old [[Waterloo Barracks]] within the Tower.

The original idea came from [[Anthony Wagner|Sir Anthony Wagner]], [[Garter Principal King of Arms]].  Wagner hoped to establish a [[museum]] in which to display the treasures of the [[College of Arms]] itself. A plan for a building adjacent to the college was commissioned from [[Raymond Erith]], but not taken forward due to the increasing financial demands of repairs to the college building.&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt;

In 1980 the Heralds' Museum was opened by the [[Duke of Kent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TlvoAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Heralds'+Museum%22+tower+london&amp;dq=%22Heralds'+Museum%22+tower+london&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiX8O6PyYraAhVBuhQKHZLWBi0Q6AEIPjAF|title=The Museums Journal|first1=Elijah|last1=Howarth|first2=F. R.|last2=Rowley|first3=W. Ruskin|last3=Butterfield|first4=Charles|last4=Madeley|date=26 March 1982|publisher=Museums Association|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the Tower of London. The museum was open during the summer season and admission was included in admission to the Tower. Exhibits included items from the collection of College of Arms and artifacts borrowed from other sources.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-anthony-wagner-1618877.html|title=OBITUARY : Sir Anthony Wagner|date=10 May 1995|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Spurrier]] served as its curator,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4v0i6yk2R7IC&amp;q=%22Heralds'+Museum%22+tower+london&amp;dq=%22Heralds'+Museum%22+tower+london&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiX8O6PyYraAhVBuhQKHZLWBi0Q6AEITDAI|title=Museum Bulletin|date=26 March 1981|publisher=Museum and Picture Gallery, Baroda|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Brooke-Little]] as its director.&lt;ref name="jbl"/&gt;

The museum closed later in the 1980s following the reorganisation of the Royal Palaces.&lt;ref name="jbl"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1510576/John-Brooke-Little.html|title=John Brooke-Little|date=16 February 2006|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hermitage Amsterdam''' is a branch museum of the [[Hermitage Museum]] of [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], located on the banks of the [[Amstel]] river in [[Amsterdam]]. The museum is located in the former [[Amstelhof]], a [[Classical architecture|classical]] style building from 1681. The dependency displayed small exhibitions in the adjacent Neerlandia Building from 24 February 2004 until the main museum opened on 19 June 2009.

It is currently the largest satellite of the Hermitage Museum, with a total area of {{convert|12846|m2|sqft|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="opening"&gt;{{cite web| title=Hermitage to open 20 June 2009| url=http://hermitage.nl/en/pers/algemeen/persberichten/persbericht_opening_hermitage_fase_2.htm| publisher=Hermitage Amsterdam| accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fits with the museum's plan to make its collections accessible to more people.&lt;ref name="formal"&gt;{{cite press release|title=The formal opening of the Hermitage Amsterdam Centre |url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/11/2009/hm11_1_215.html |date=19 June 2009 |publisher=State Hermitage Museum |accessdate=2013-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130105031827/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/11/2009/hm11_1_215.html |archivedate=5 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exhibition area covers {{convert|2172|m2|sqft|abbr=on}} and is contained within two large exhibition halls and smaller exhibition rooms.

==History==
[[File:Amstelhofo.jpg|thumb|A 1693 etching of the [[Amstelhof]], showing the building out of proportions]]

The structure opened in 1682 as a [[retirement home]] for elderly women under the name Diaconie Oude Vrouwen Huys ({{lang-en|Deanery Home for Old Women}}) on the east bank of the river [[Amstel]]. Beginning in 1817, the facility housed both elderly men and women, and was renamed Diaconie Oude Vrouwen- en [[Oude Mannenhuis|Mannenhuis]] (English: Deanery Home for Old Men and Women). The building was first named [[Amstelhof]] ({{lang-en|Amstel Court}}) in 1953.&lt;ref name="building"&gt;{{cite web| title=History of the Building| url=http://www.hermitage.nl/en/hermitage_amsterdam/geschiedenis_van_het_gebouw.htm| publisher=Hermitage Amsterdam| accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, operators of the facility determined that it was inadequate to meet the modern needs of its residents and sought to build a new structure elsewhere. They offered the historic structure to the city of Amsterdam, who, in turn, leased it to the museum. The last inhabitants left the Amstelhof in 2007.&lt;ref name="amstelhof"&gt;{{cite web| title=From Amstelhof to Hermitage Amsterdam| url=http://www.hermitage.nl/en/hermitage_amsterdam/van_amstelhof_naar_hermitage_amsterdam.htm| publisher=Hermitage Amsterdam| accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 June 2009, the museum was opened by Dutch [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] and [[Russian President]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]]. The museum was open to the public the following day.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news| publisher=Reuters.com| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE55H6OC20090618| title=Russia's Hermitage museum opens Amsterdam branch| first=Gilbert| last=Kreijger| date=18 June 2009| accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrc"&gt;{{cite news| title=Hermitage Amsterdam opened| url=http://www.nrc.nl/kunst/article2277306.ece/Hermitage_Adam_geopend| date=19 June 2009| publisher=nrc.nl| work=[[NRC Handelsblad]]| accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the more than 300 years that residents were housed in the Amstelhof, several renovations took place on the building interior and wings were added to provide needed space. Thus, little of the original interior remained when work for the museum began. While some areas were restored to their original appearance, many existing walls were removed and spaces reconfigured to accommodate the museum's needs. The total cost of the renovations was {{€}}40 million.&lt;ref name="background"&gt;{{cite web| title=Background Hermitage Amsterdam| url=http://www.hermitage.nl/en/pers/algemeen/persberichten/geschiedenis_van_het_project.htm| publisher=Hermitage Amsterdam| accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temporary museum in the Neerlandia Building on the Nieuwe Keizersgracht closed in 2008 to become the Hermitage for Children. It opened along with the main museum on 20 June 2009.

===The immortal Alexander the Great===
* ''The Immortal [[Alexander III of Macedon|Alexander the Great]] The Myth, The Truth, His Journey, His Legacy,'' 18 September 2010 – 18 March 2011.
Alexander the Great (356 BC&amp;nbsp;– 323 BC, king from 336 BC) appeals to the imagination more than any ruler of the ancient age. Beginning in his youth he inspired those around him. During his campaigns in the East, Alexander searched for the origins of Dionysus, whom the ancient Greeks believed came from the exotic East, possibly India. He followed in the footsteps of Dionysus to reach countries such as Bactria, Egypt, India, Mongolia, Persia and Syria. Everywhere he went he established cities,  naming many Alexandria, and left behind a legacy of Greek culture in the form of Hellenism.

Alexander's fame lived long after antiquity as an example to many European, Russian and Islamic rulers. His life and history were depicted through paintings, tapestries and decorative art from classical antiquity to the modern age, of Western and non-Western origins.&lt;ref name="alexander"&gt;{{cite press release| title=The Imortal Alexander the Great| url=http://www.hermitage.nl/en/pers/alexander_de_grote/persbericht.htm| date=18 September 2008|publisher=Hermitage Amsterdam| accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matisse to Malevich===

* ''Matisse to Malevich. Pioneers of Modern Art from the Hermitage'' 6 March to 17 September 2010
The exhibit was the first display in The Netherlands of works from the Hermitage Museum's collections of French paintings of the late 19th and early 20th century. The collection was started by Russian collectors Morozov and [[Sergei Shchukin|Shchukin]]. The exhibit contained hundreds of masterpieces by artists who pioneered [[Modernism]], including [[Henri Matisse|Matisse]], [[Kees van Dongen|Van Dongen]], De Vlaminck, [[André Derain|Derain]] and [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]. It looked at the concept of Modernism from a historical perspective and examined how artists joined the new movement. The guest curator for the exhibit was Henk van Os, Professor at the University of Amsterdam and chairman of the Specialists Council of the Hermitage Amsterdam.

The museum is planning a sequel exhibition that will examine the origins of this modern art through a display of works by Impressionists from the Hermitage.&lt;ref name="matisse"&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.hermitage.nl/nl/tentoonstellingen/verwacht.htm| title=Matisse to Malevich: Pioneers of Modern Art from the Hermitage| date=6 March 2010| publisher=Hermitage Amsterdam| accessdate=2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Shark Attack File''' is a global database of [[shark attack]]s. It began as an attempt to catalogue shark attacks on servicemen during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]]. The [[Office of Naval Research]] funded it from 1958 until 1968. During that time, a panel of shark experts developed a standard system for collecting accounts of shark attacks from around the world. The file was temporarily housed at the [[Mote Marine Laboratory]] in [[Sarasota, Florida]], until a permanent home was found at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]] at the [[University of Florida]]. It is currently under the direction of members of the [[American Elasmobranch Society]], including [[George H. Burgess]]. The file contains information on over 5,300 shark attacks, and includes detailed, often privileged, information including [[autopsy]] reports and graphic photos. The file is accessible only to scientists whose access is permitted only by a review board.

A similar project called '''Global Shark Attack File''' is accessible to everybody as an XLS file that can be sorted by date and location of the shark attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Incident log|url=http://www.sharkattackfile.net/incidentlog.htm|website=Global Shark Attack File}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11836">{{Redirect|JAH}}
'''Jah''' or '''Yah''' ({{lang-he-n|יהּ}}, ''Yah'') is a short form of [[Yahweh]] (in consonantal spelling YHWH {{lang-he-n|יהוה}}, called the [[Tetragrammaton]]), [[Names of God in Judaism|the proper name]] of [[God in Judaism|God]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref name="JE-Yah"&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=165&amp;letter=T#630 Abbreviated Tetragrammaton] in the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
This short form of the name occurs 50 times in the text of the Hebrew Bible, of which 24 form part of the phrase "[[Hallelujah]]", which is actually a two-word phrase, not one word.

In an English-language context, the name ''Jah'' is now most commonly associated with the [[Rastafari]]. It is otherwise mostly limited to the phrase ''Hallelujah'' and [[theophory in the Bible|theophoric names]] such as [[Elijah]]. "Jah" is an abbreviation of "Jehovah", the English transliteration of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton יהוה‬, God's name (Exodus 3:13).
In the [[King James Version]] (1611) there is only a single instance of ''JAH''  (capitalised), in [[Psalm 68]]:4. ''[[An American Translation]]'' (1939) follows KJV in using ''Yah'' in this verse.
The conventional English pronunciation of ''Jah'' is {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɑː}}, even though the letter [[J]] here transliterates the [[palatal approximant]] (Hebrew י [[Yodh]]). The spelling ''Yah'' is designed to make the pronunciation {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɑː}} explicit in an English-language context (see also [[romanization of Hebrew]]).

==Hebrew names of God: Yahweh, Yahu, Yah==
{{main|Yahweh}}
On the assumption that ''a'' and ''e'' are the correct vowels, [[Yahweh]] is a name of God in the Hebrew language. ''Yahu'' is a well-attested short form of the full or extended name ''[[Yahweh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=inRKaf_To5sC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=yahu+yahweh&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ3vGxo-LcAhWPN8AKHZtIB2oQ6AEIRzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=yahu%20yahweh&amp;f=false Gary A. Rendsburg, "Israel Without the Bible" in Frederick E. Greenspahn (editor), ''The Hebrew Bible: New Insights and Scholarship'' (NYU Press 2008), pp. 8−9]&lt;/ref&gt; The short form ''Jah/Yah'', which appears in Exodus 15:2 and 17:16, Psalm 89:9, Song of Songs 8:6,&lt;ref name=JBQ/&gt; is preserved also in [[Theophory in the Bible|theophoric names]] such as [[Elijah]] ("my god is Jah"), [[Malchijah]]  ("my king is Jah"), and ([[Adonijah]]) "my lord is Jah", etc. as well as in the phrase ''[[Hallelujah]]''. The name "Joel" is derived from combining the word ''Jah'' with the word ''El''.

While pronouncing the [[Tetragrammaton]] (generally believed to have corresponded to "Yahweh") is forbidden for Jews, articulating "Jah"/"Yah" is allowed, but is usually confined to prayer and study.&lt;ref name=JBQ&gt;[http://jbq.jewishbible.org/assets/Uploads/421/JBQ_421_4_Yah.pdf Clifford Hubert Durousseau, "Yah: A Name of God" in ''Jewish Bible Quarterly'', vol. 42:1 (January − March 2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rastafari usage ==
{{Rastafari}}
Rastafari use the terms "Jah" or sometimes "Jah Jah" as a term for the Lord God of Israel and/or [[Haile Selassie]], who some Rastafarians regard as the incarnation of The God of the Old Testament  or as the reincarnation of Jesus Christ who is also known by the [[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Negusa Nagast|title]] ''Janhoy''.&lt;ref&gt;Nathaniel Samuel Murrell, William David Spencer, Adrian Anthony McFarlane (1998).''Chanting Down Babylon: The Rastafari Reader''. p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the Old Testament ==
Yah occurs 50 times:&lt;ref&gt;G. Lisowsky, ''Konkordanz zum hebräischen Alten Testament'', Stuttgart 1958, p. 1612. Basic information about the form ''Jāh'', see L. Koehler, W. Baumgartner, J.J. Stamm, ''Wielki słownik hebrajsko-polski i aramejsko-polski Starego Testamentu'' (Great Dictionary of the Hebrew-Aramaic-Polish and Polish Old Testament), Warszawa 2008, vol 1, p. 327, code No. 3514.&lt;/ref&gt; 43 times in the Psalms, in Exodus 15:2; 17:16; Isaiah 12:2; 26:4, and twice in Isaiah 38:11.

== In the New Testament ==
At Revelation 19:1-6, ''Jah''&amp;mdash;a contraction of the name [[Yahweh]]&amp;mdash;is embedded in the phrase "[[hallelujah]]" ([[Tiberian Hebrew|Tiberian]] ''halləlûyāh''), a Hebrew expression that literally means "Praise Jah".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gerard Gertoux|title=The Use of the Name (''YHWH'') by Early Christians|publisher=Society of Biblical Literature|url=http://areopage.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Gertoux_UseNameEarlyChristians.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The short form "IA" (Yah or Jah (יה)) in the phrase hallelouia (Ἁλληλουιά) is transcribed by the Greek "Ia".&lt;ref name=jewishenciclopediatetra&gt;{{cite book|work=Jewish Enciclopedia|title=Tetragrammaton|author= Crawford Howell Toy, Ludwig Blau|year=1906|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14346-tetragrammaton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish and Christian Bibles==
In the [[King James Version]] of the [[Christian Bible]], the Hebrew יהּ&lt;ref name="JE-Yah"/&gt; is transliterated as "JAH" (capitalised) in only one instance: "Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Psalm|68:4|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[An American Translation]]'' renders the Hebrew word as "Yah" in this verse. In the 1885 Revised Version and its annotated study edition, The Modern Reader's Bible, which uses the Revised Version as its base text, also transliterates "JAH" in Psalms 89:8 which reads,"O LORD God of hosts, who is a mighty one, like unto thee, O JAH? and thy faithfulness is round about thee".

With the rise of the [[Reformation]], reconstructions of the Tetragrammaton became popular. The [[Tyndale Bible]] was the first English translation to use the anglicized reconstruction. The modern letter "[[J]]" settled on its current English pronunciation only around 500 years ago; in Ancient Hebrew, the first consonant of the Tetragrammaton always represents a "[[Y]]" sound.

Rotherham's ''Emphasised Bible'' includes 49 uses of ''Jah''. In the ''[[Sacred Scriptures Bethel Edition]]'' Bible, the [[Jerusalem Bible]], and the [[New Jerusalem Bible]] (prior to 1998) the name "YHWH" and its abbreviated form "Yah" is found. The ''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'', used primarily by [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], employs "Jah" in the [[Old Testament|Hebrew Scriptures]], and translates ''Hallelujah'' as "Praise Jah" in the [[New Testament|Greek Scriptures]]. The [[Sacred Name Bibles|Divine Name King James Bible]] employs "JAH" in 50 instances within the Old Testament according to the Divine Name Concordance of the Divine Name King James Bible, Second Edition.

The Spanish language [[Reina Valera]] Bible employs "JAH" in 21 instances within the Old Testament according to the ''Nueva Concordancia Strong Exhaustiva''. The [[Darby Bible]], [[Young's Literal Translation]], The Jubilee Bible 2000, [[Lexham English Bible]], The [[Complete Jewish Bible]], [[Sacred Name Bibles|Names of God Bible]], The [[Recovery Version]], [[Green's Literal Translation]], the New Jewish Publication Society or [[NJPS Tanakh]] and [[World English Bible]] includes "Jah" (Yah in the Lexham English Bible, Complete Jewish Bible, the NJPS Tanakh and the World English Bible) numerous times within the Old Testament (as well as in the New Testament or New Covenant as is the case in Christian and Messianic Jewish Bibles) as "Hallelujah!" or "Alleluia!" (Praise Jah or Yah in either instance) which is also employed throughout the Old Testament of these Bible versions.

"Hallelujah!" or "Alleluia!" is also used in other Bible versions such as the [[Sacred Name Bibles|Divine Name King James Bible]], [[American Standard Version]], the [[Recovery Version]], The [[Tree of Life Version]], [[Amplified Bible]], [[God's Word Translation]], [[Holman Christian Standard Bible]], [[International Standard Version]], [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]], [[New American Bible]] Revised Edition, The [[Jerusalem Bible]], The [[New Jerusalem Bible]], [[NJPS Tanakh]], [[Jewish Publication Society of America Version|The first JPS translation]], [[The Living Bible]], [[The Bible in Living English]], [[Young's Literal Translation]], [[King James Version]], The Spanish language [[Reina Valera]] and even in Bible versions that otherwise do not generally use the Divine Name such as the [[New King James Version]], [[English Standard Version]], J.B. Phillips New Testament, [[New International Version]], [[Douay-Rheims]] Version, [[God's Word Translation]], [[Revised Standard Version]], [[New Revised Standard Version]], The Jubilee Bible 2000, [[New American Standard Bible]], [[New Century Version]], [[New International Reader's Version]] and several other versions, translations and/or editions in English and other languages varying from once to numerous times depending on the Bible version especially and most notably in Revelation Chapter 19 in Christian and Messianic Jewish Bibles.

===In music===
Jah is referenced in many [[reggae]] songs. The popularity of this music form associated with the [[Rastafari]] has spread the name "Jah" (derived from the KJV Psalms 68:4) beyond the West Indies.

For example, it is referenced in [[Bob Marley]]'s "[[Is This Love (Bob Marley song)|Is This Love]]", in the line: "We'll share the same room, for Jah provide the bread". It appears in the title of [[Third World (band)|Third World]]'s hit song "Try Jah Love". [[The Mighty Diamonds]] song "Pass the Koutchie" has the following lyric: "Cause the spirit of Jah, you know he leads you on". Similarly, Mystic Roots "Pass the Marijuana" contains the words "Pass the marijuana, give Jah thanks and praise today". Also [[Stevie Wonder]]'s ode to Marley, "[[Master Blaster (Jammin')]]", contains the following verse lyric: "We've agreed to get together, joined as children in Jah". [[P.O.D.]]'s song "Strength of My Life" contains the words "If Jah is for me, tell me whom I gon' fear? (no I won't fear), and Jah of Jacob, deserving of my love". Also, Jah is referenced many times in Damian Marley's song "Road to Zion" and in the songs of Costa Rican singer Noah, such as "If you don't believe in Jah, we can not be together".  Additionally, Jah has been linked to acid-reggae music. For example, the name can be heard in [[Thievery Corporation]]'s song "The Outernationalist". Hardcore punk/reggae band [[Bad Brains]]' [[Bad Brains (album)|first album]] contains the songs "Jah Calling" and "I Luv I Jah". The use of Jah in music is also evident in the reggae band Soldiers of Jah Army, also known as SOJA. Jah also appears in [[The Lonely Island]]'s "Ras Trent" as well as being the subject of "Mount Zion" by the MC Young Zeus. Jah also appears in [[Massive Attack]]'s song "A Prayer for England": "Jah forgive us for forgetting, Oh Jah help us to be forgiving". Jah is also mentioned in the lyrics in "Prayer in C". Also of note is the 1991 release by American ska-punk band [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], titled "Jah Won't Pay the Bills". Another song in which "Jah" appears in is a song written by the Israeli band [[Hatikva 6]] called "If I'll Meet God", the first line of the chorus states "Eem be'yom min ha'yamim, Efgosh et Elohim, Et Allah, Jah Jah, God, Dieu, Melech hamlachim" which roughly translates to "If one day I'll meet god, Allah, Jah Jah, God, Dieu, King of Kings" which are all names of god.

"Jah" sometimes appears in other Christian music genres as well. [[P.O.D.]] recorded the song "Without Jah, Nothing," and the first line of [[Camper Van Beethoven]]'s song "[[Take the Skinheads Bowling]]" is "Every day, I get up and pray to Jah". [[Major Lazer]] released a song in 2012 called "Jah No Partial".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6309">'''Le Livre de Poche''' (literally "The Pocket Book") is the name of a [[Collection (publishing)|collection of publications]] which first appeared on 9 February 1953 under the leadership of [[Henri Filipacchi]] and published by the [[Librairie générale française]], a subsidiary of [[Hachette Livre|Hachette]]. In terms of its influence on the mainstream book market, it shares a similar popularity in France as publishers like [[Penguin Books|Penguin]] and [[Signet Books|Signet]] do in English-speaking territories.

==History==
Admittedly, books of a similar format, fitting in a pocket, already existed. Since 1905, Editions [[Jules Tallandier]] marketed themselves under the name ''Livre de poche'', popular novels at low cost&lt;!--, Hachette devra d'ailleurs leur racheter le nom--&gt;. But the successful reception of ''Le Livre de Poche'' was due to the combination of the new idea of ''consumerism'' with the era and the popular demand for a cheap book, presented in covers recalling cinema posters, but containing quality writing.

Henri Filipacchi supposedly had the idea after seeing an American soldier tearing up a book in order to fit it into the pockets of his uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historia.fr/web/lair-du-temps/le-9-fevrier-1953-lancement-du-livre-de-poche-17-01-2013-86414|title=Le 9 février 1953 : lancement du Livre de Poche|author=Denis Lefebvre|date=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filipacchi succeeded in convincing his editor friends [[Éditions Albin Michel|Albin Michel]], [[Calmann-Lévy]], [[Éditions Grasset|Grasset]] and [[Gallimard]] to join his project and become the "founding fathers" of Le Livre de Poche.

Thus ''[[Koenigsmark (novel)|Kœnigsmark]]'', by [[Pierre Benoît (novelist)|Pierre Benoit]], was the first title released, in 1953. Every fortnight a new title is released. It soon became a ''fait de société''. From 8 million copies in 1957-1958, sales climbed to 28 million in 1969. This success inspired competitors: [[J'ai lu]] created by [[Groupe Flammarion|Flammarion]] in 1958, [[Presses Pocket]] created by the [[Presses de la Cité]] and Folio created by [[Gallimard]] in 1972 after its withdrawal from the Librairie Générale Française. But, with nearly a billion volumes distributed since its creation and more than 18 million copies sold [[in 2002]], it remains the premier widely distributed French paperback collection.

==Some facts==
The capital of La Librairie générale française, a limited company, is owned 80% by Hachette-Livre and, up to 20%, by les [[Éditions Albin Michel]].
* 3,500 titles in its catalogue as of 31.12.2002

* 1 billion volumes distributed since its inception
* 360 new titles a year

The '''Letter of the Karaite elders of Ascalon''' (c. 1100) was a communication written by six elders of the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite]] Jewish community of [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] and sent to their coreligionists in [[Alexandria]] nine months after the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1099)|fall of Jerusalem]] during the [[First Crusade]]. The contents describe how the Ascalon elders pooled money to pay the initial ransom for pockets of Jews and holy relics being held captive in Jerusalem by the Crusaders, the fate of some of these refugees after their release (including their transport to Alexandria, contraction of the [[Bubonic plague|plague]], or death at sea), and the need for additional funds for the rescuing of further captives.&lt;ref&gt;Goitein, S.D. ''A Mediterranean Society: The Jewish Communities of the Arab World as Portrayed in the Documents of the Cairo Geniza. Vol. V: The Individual: Portrait of a Mediterranean Personality of the High Middle Ages as Reflected in the Cairo Geniza.'' University of California Press, 1988 ({{ISBN|0520056477}}), p. 374-379&lt;/ref&gt; It was written in [[Judeo-Arabic]], Arabic using the [[Hebrew alphabet]].&lt;ref name=kedar&gt;Kedar, Benjamin Z. "The Jerusalem Massacre of July 1099 in the Western Historiography of the Crusades." in ''The Crusades'' ( Vol. 3). ed. Benjamin Z. Kedar and Jonathan S.C. Riley-Smith. Ashgate Publishing Limited, 2004 ({{ISBN|075464099X}}); p. 60, footnote #146; p. 64, footnote #161&lt;/ref&gt;

This and other such letters related to the Crusader conquest of Jerusalem were discovered by noted historian [[S.D. Goitein]] in 1952 among the papers of the [[Cairo Geniza]]. Goitein first published his findings in ''Zion'', a Hebrew journal, and then presented a partial English translation of the letter in the ''Journal of Jewish Studies'' that same year. Since then, it has been retranslated in several other books pertaining to the [[Crusades]]. Goitein's final and most complete English translation appeared in his final book posthumously published in 1988.&lt;ref name=kedar/&gt;

A '''monosyllabic language''' is a language in which words predominantly consist of a single [[syllable]]. '''Monosyllabism''' is the name for the property of single-syllable word form. Monosyllabism is connected to [[ideographic writing systems]], because of the one-glyph for one word (idea) principle, and [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese]] and other languages of Southeast Asia are sometimes referred to as monosyllabic languages. The natural complement of monosyllabism is [[polysyllabism]].

The languages of the Asian region tend to be highly [[isolating languages|isolating]] and can be phonetically complex (the phonetic rules of Thai language permits 23 638 possible syllables, compared to, for example, Hawaiian language's 162). The difficulty of defining the term "word", such as the difficulty of telling apart [[collocation]]s, [[set phrase]]s and compound words in languages such as Chinese or English (is "dog house/doghouse" a single word or a two-word phrase?), the subjective question of what constitutes "most" words to make a language monosyllabic (there are no living languages that are strictly monosyllabic) and other such considerations render the topic non-scientific and unencyclopedic.

== Single-vowel form ==
A monosyllable may be complex and include seven or more consonants and a vowel ('''CCCCVCCC''' or '''CCCVCCCC''' as in English "strengths") or be as simple as a single vowel or a [[syllabic consonant]].

Few known recorded languages preserve simple '''CV''' forms which apparently are fully functional roots conveying meaning, ''i.e.'' are words—but are ''not'' the reductions from earlier complex forms that we find in Mandarin Chinese '''CV''' forms, almost always derived with tonal and phonological modifications from Sino-Tibetan '''*(C)CV(C)(C)/(V)''' forms.

Examples of monosyllabic languages include [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] and [[Old Chinese]]. However, all known varieties of modern Chinese are not monosyllabic;&lt;ref&gt;Hannas, Wm. C. (1997) Asia's Orthographic Dilemma. Honolulu: University of Hawai`i Press. {{ISBN|9780585344010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Chinese morphology]] and [[Vietnamese morphology]] for discussion.

=="Monosyllabic writing"==
Syllables are units of '''speech'''. The text below attempts to introduce the concept into a discussion about the '''writing''' systems.

One such language that does record simple '''C(V)''' forms as words is [[Egyptian language|hieroglyphic Egyptian]] where signs for single consonants (with implied vowel) denoting words are marked as words with a short horizontal line: ''e.g.'' '''3 ₵''', which means 'vulture (or perhaps 'the bird')'; and '''' ₳''', which means 'arm'. Another early language that allows us to see simple '''CV''' forms as words is cuneiform (and earlier pictographic) [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], in which, with some reservations based on the multiple readings of most signs, we can specify the final '''V''': ''e.g.'' '''da''', 'side'; and '''sa''', 'sinew'. Some scientists, however, believe that Sumerian may have been a tonal language, which seems plausible given the number of homonyms in the language.

'''Munk's Roll''' is a series of published works containing biographical entries of the Fellows of the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. The original title ''The Roll of the Royal College of Physicians of London'' has become commonly referred to as the colloquial ''Munk's Rolls''. The Roll has been continued, and has been published in eleven volumes (until 2004). The twelfth in electronic form, post 2004. The work has been reproduced in multiple editions. From 1860 to today, the work is compiled by the Librarians of the College.

==History==
Munk's Roll was initially the work of the College's Harveian Librarian, [[William Munk]].

The first published volume (1861) was originally prepared as manuscript in three large volumes with no thought to publication; with each volume of the manuscript being presented to the College library upon its completion. Of the manuscripts, the first volume was from the foundation of the College to 1600 (completed March 1855), the second covered 1601 to 1700 (completed December 1855), and the third volume 1701-1800 (completed in June 1856). The Council of the College, at the instigation of some influential Fellows, expressed the view in December 1860 that the work be published, and it subsequently was in 1861.&lt;ref name="Munks 2ed"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munk|first=William|authorlink=William Munk|title=The Roll of the Royal College of Physicians at London|url=https://archive.org/stream/rollroyalcolleg00goog#page/n12/mode/2up|accessdate=2013-01-21|edition=2|volume=1|year=1878|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|location=London|page=viii|chapter=Preface to the first edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RCP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/|title=RCP Heritage : Lives of the fellow|year=2013|publisher=Royal College of Physicians|accessdate=22 January 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initial publication in 1861:
* Volume 1, from 1518 to 1700
* Volume 2, from 1701-1800
contained past fellows and licentiates from 1518 to 1800. In 1878, the third volume was produced as part of the second edition, and again overseen by Munk, extended the dates of biographies to 1825. The work was set out in chronological order with an index at the front of both volumes.

Subsequent editions focused on fellows of the College, post 1825, which reflects the increasing qualifications and professionalism of physicians through the 19th century, and were entitled ''Lives of the Fellows of the Royal College of Physicians of London'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/vcdf/detail?coll_id=7160&amp;inst_id=8&amp;nv1=search&amp;nv2=|title=AIM25 collection description|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Volume 3, 1801-1825

==The Roll today==
The Roll is being reproduced by the Royal College of Physicians, and has become an invaluable biographical resource for those interested in medical and social history, and family historians. All the printed volumes are now available online, and the Roll is regularly updated with new obituaries of fellows.

"'''Noah bells'''" is the common name given to a distinct type of [[Bell (instrument)|bell]] hand-manufactured in [[India]] by ancient and inherited traditions. Some [[monasteries]] in India are credited with manufacturing Noah bells for hundreds of years. The profits from the selling of authentic Noah bells are used to finance the activities of the particular monastery which fashioned them.

These bells are popular among collectors because of their intricate resonances and also because of the mystique that surrounds them. One tale proclaims that these bells are divinely imbued with the power to ward off demons.

Maharani Imports was the first company to import these bells about 40 years ago. The founders, Bonny Karstadt and Ratilal Shah named them after their son Noah Shah. It has become the common name to describe these particularly shaped handmade copper shepard bells. They are often used in gardens for decoration in America.

'''Pap Saine''' is a [[Gambia]]n editor and publisher of the [[English-language]] independent newspaper, ''[[The Point (Gambia)|The Point]]''. In 2010, the [[International Press Institute]] named him a [[World Press Freedom Hero]] for his work.&lt;ref name=IPI&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freemedia.at/awards/pap-saine.html |title=Pap Saine: World Press Freedom Hero |author= |year=2010 |work= |publisher=[[International Press Institute]] |accessdate=4 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016064758/http://www.freemedia.at/awards/pap-saine.html |archivedate=16 October 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work with ''The Point''==
On 16 December 1991, Pap Saine co-founded ''The Point'' along with [[Deyda Hydara]] and Babucarr Gaye; Hydara and Saine had been friends since childhood.&lt;ref name=IPI3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freemedia.at/press-room/public-statements/africa/singleview/article/interview-with-ipi-world-press-freedom-hero-pap-saine.html |title=Interview with IPI World Press Freedom Hero Pap Saine |author=Valentin Ladstaetter and Laura Pannasch |date=21 September 2010 |work= |publisher=International Press Institute |accessdate=3 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121230065200/http://www.freemedia.at/press-room/public-statements/africa/singleview/article/interview-with-ipi-world-press-freedom-hero-pap-saine.html |archivedate=30 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaye resigned four months later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thepoint.gm/about |title=About the Point Newspaper |author= |date= |work= |publisher=''[[The Point (Gambia)|The Point]]'' |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hydara and Saine ran the paper together for the next decade. Saine also worked as a [[Reuters]] correspondent for [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name=IPI /&gt;

On 14 December 2004, the Gambia passed two new media laws. One, the Criminal Code (Amendment) Bill 2004, allowed prison terms for [[defamation]] and [[sedition]]; the other, the Newspaper (Amendment) Bill 2004, required newspaper owners to purchase expensive operating licenses, registering their homes as [[Security (finance)|security]]. Hydara announced his intent to challenge these laws, but on 16 December, was assassinated by an unknown gunman while driving home from work in [[Banjul]]. Hydara's murder was never solved.&lt;ref name=IPI2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freemedia.at/index.php?id=440 |title=Deyda Hydara |author= |year=2010 |work= |publisher=International Press Institute|accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he was posthumously awarded the [[PEN/Barbara Goldsmith Freedom to Write Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifex.org/2005/04/06/saudi_writer_gambian_journalist/ |title=Saudi Writer, Gambian Journalist Win Freedom to Write Awards |author= |date=6 April 2005 |work= |publisher=International Freedom of Expression Exchange |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Hydara's death, Saine continued to edit ''The Point'', making it a daily in 2006.&lt;ref name=IPI3/&gt; ''The Point'' soon became the only independent newspaper in the Gambia.&lt;ref name=RWB/&gt;

==2009 arrests==
On 2 February 2009, Saine and ''Point'' reporter Modou Sanyang were arrested by Gambian police for suspicion of "publishing and spreading false information". Sanyang was released with a warning, but Saine was formally charged. According to the [[Media Foundation of West Africa]], the arrests had been prompted by a ''Point'' story titled "Arrested Gambian Diplomat Sent to Mile 2", in which the paper reported that Lamini Sabi Sanyang, an arrested official from Gambia's US Embassy, had been transferred to Mile 2 Prison; Saine had been detained for refusing to reveal his [[Journalism sourcing|source]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifex.org/the_gambia/2009/02/03/the_point_editor_arrested_on_charges/ |title="The Point" editor arrested on charges of "spreading false information" |author= |date=3 February 2009 |work= |publisher=[[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; One week later, following another report on Gambia's US Embassy, Saine was arrested again, interrogated at length, and given a second charge of "publishing and spreading false information".&lt;ref name=PEN/&gt;

On 24 February, authorities also accused Saine of being [[Senegal]]ese and having obtained a Gambian birth certificate through "false statements". He faced separate trials for each set of charges, both on 12 March in Banjul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arabia.reporters-sans-frontieres.org/imprimer_ar.php3?id_article=30478 |title=Adjournment of trials facing editor of the daily The Point |author= |date=12 March 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Reporters Without Borders]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reporters Without Borders]] described the investigation of Saine as "hounding" and called on [[Kamalesh Sharma]], the [[Secretary General of the Commonwealth]], to intervene.&lt;ref name=RWB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,RSF,,GMB,,49be03c71a,0.html |title=Commonwealth secretary general urged to help "save The Point" |author= |date=4 March 2009 |work= |publisher=[[UNHCR]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 April, the charges of "publishing and spreading false information" were formally dropped.&lt;ref name=PEN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://penusa.org/DOTIW |title=Day of the Imprisoned Writer |author= |year=2009 |work= |publisher=[[PEN American Center]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydara murder controversy and defamation trial==
In November 2008, the International Press Institute began a "Justice Denied" campaign pressing for investigations into violence against journalists in the Gambia, particularly the still-unsolved murder of Deyda Haydara. At a June 2009 press conference, Gambian President [[Yahya Jammeh]] disparaged questions about the Hydara investigation, saying "And up to now one of these stupid Web sites carries 'Who Killed Deyda Hydara'?  Let them go and ask Deyda Hydara who killed him."&lt;ref name=IPI2 /&gt; [[The Gambia Press Union]] then published a statement criticizing the lack of press freedom in Gambia, the stalled progress of the investigation, and the president's remarks, which the union called  "inappropriate".&lt;ref name=PEN /&gt;&lt;ref name=RWB2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.rsf.org/gambia-reporters-without-borders-posts-19-08-2009,34183.html |title= Reporters Without Borders Posts Statement that Led to Two-Year Jail Terms for Six Journalists |author= |date=19 August 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Reporters Without Borders]] |accessdate=5 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement ran in ''The Point'' and a weekly newspaper, ''[[Foroyaa]]'', on 11 June.&lt;ref name=PEN /&gt;

The Gambian government responded by arresting six journalists: Pap Saine, News Editor Ebrima Sawaneh, and reporters Sarata Jabbi-Dibba and Pa Modou Faal of ''The Point''; and editor Sam Saar and reporters Emil Touray of ''Foroyaa''. The six were charged with sedition and criminal defamation of the president.&lt;ref name=CPJ2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpj.org/2010/02/attacks-on-the-press-2009-gambia.php |title=Attacks on the Press 2009: Gambia |author= |date=16 February 2010 |work= |publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jabbi-Dibba (the only woman) was held in Mile 2 prison, while Saine, Sawaneh, Faal, Saar, and Touray were held in Old Jeshwang prison. On 8 August, Jabbi-Dibba's seven-month-old baby was taken away.&lt;ref name=RWB2 /&gt;

Numerous human rights NGOs protested the arrests and called the charges against the journalists to be dropped. [[Amnesty International]] designated the six as [[prisoners of conscience]] and demanded their immediate release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/fr/node/11702 |title=Gambia: Six Journalists Condemned to Two Years in Mile 2 Prison |author= |date=7 August 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] also campaigned for Saine's release,&lt;ref name=CPJ2/&gt; as did the [[World Organization Against Torture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omct.org/human-rights-defenders/urgent-interventions/gambia/2009/09/d20242/ |title=The Gambia: Release of six trade union leaders and journalists |author= |date=11 September 2009 |work= |publisher=[[World Organization Against Torture]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Federation for Human Rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fidh.org/GMB-001-0609-OBS-088-1-Sentencing |title=GMB 001 / 0609 / OBS 088.1 Sentencing / Arbitrary detention |author= |date=18 August 2010 |work= |publisher=[[International Federation for Human Rights]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International PEN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englishpen.org/writersinprison/bulletins/gambiasixjournalistsjailedforcriticisingpresident/ |title=Gambia: Six journalists jailed for criticising President |author= |date=10 August 2009 |work= |publisher=[[International PEN]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[PEN American Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pen.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/3770/prmID/1610 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905213401/http://www.pen.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/3770/prmID/1610 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 September 2012 |title=PEN Appeal: Six Jouranlists [sic] in the Gambia |author= |date=11 August 2009 |work= |publisher=[[PEN American Center]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Front Line (NGO)|Front Line Defenders]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/fr/node/2063 |title=The Gambia: Arrest of seven journalists for fighting impunity and expressing press freedom concerns |author= |date=18 June 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Front Line (NGO)|Front Line Defenders]] |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jammeh continued to denounce the journalists, however, making a state television appearance to say "So they think they can hide behind so-called press freedom and violate the law and get away with it? They got it wrong this time&amp;nbsp;... We are going to prosecute them to the letter."&lt;ref name=CPJ2/&gt;

On 7 August 2009, the six were convicted and sentenced to two years' imprisonment in Mile 2 Prison, as well as a fine of 250,000 [[dalasi]] (£5,780) apiece.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/aug/07/gambia-journalists-jailed |title=Six journalists jailed in Gambia |author=Chris Tryhorn |date=7 August 2009 |work= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jammeh pardoned them in September, following a campaign of "domestic and international pressure".&lt;ref name=CPJ2/&gt; The pardons were issued to coincide with [[Ramadan]].&lt;ref name=IPI/&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
Saine was awarded the [[Johann Philipp Palm Award]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palm-stiftung.de/johann-philipp-palm-award/laureates/index.html |title=Laureates |author= |date= |work= |publisher=The Palm Foundation |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award is named for a bookseller executed by [[Napoleon]], and recognizes individuals who are "of outstanding prominence in the promotion of freedom of opinion and the press".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palm-stiftung.de/johann-philipp-palm-award/jpp-preis.html?changelang=2 |title=The Johann-Philipp-Palm-Award for Freedom of Speech and the Press |author= |date= |work= |publisher=The Palm Foundation |accessdate=3 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Saine was named a [[World Press Freedom Hero]] by the International Press Institute. He is the third West African to have won the title, following [[Kenneth Best]] (Liberia) and [[Freedom Neruda]] (Côte d'Ivoire). Saine described the award as a morale-booster and "an inspiration for journalists who are fighting for freedom of the press and the interests of justice, democracy and human rights not only in the Gambia but in all of Africa".&lt;ref name=IPI/&gt;

'''Robert William Chapman''' (5 October 1881 in [[Eskbank]], [[Scotland]] &amp;ndash; 20 April 1960 in [[Oxford]]), usually known in print as '''R. W. Chapman''', was a British scholar, book collector and editor of the works of [[Samuel Johnson]] and [[Jane Austen]].&lt;ref name=DLB&gt;{{Citation | editor-last=Baker | editor-first=William | editor2-last = Womack | editor2-first = Kenneth | title= Twentieth-Century British Book Collectors and Bibliographers, First Series | series=[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]] | volume=201 | year=1999 | place=Detroit | publisher=Gale Research | first=Sandra | last=Naiman | contribution=R. W. Chapman | pages=40–48|isbn=0-7876-3072-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Chapman was the youngest of six children born to an Anglican clergyman, who died when he was three years old. He was educated at the [[High School of Dundee]], [[St Andrews University]] and [[Oriel College, Oxford]], where he graduated with a First in classics and humanities. He worked as assistant to the secretary of the [[Clarendon Press]]. In 1913 he married Katherine Marion Metcalfe, an English tutor at [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]].
Chapman did military service in [[Salonika]] during [[World War I]], managing to study the works of Johnson there and continue to write for the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''.&lt;ref name=DLB /&gt;

After the war Chapman would remain in Oxford until his death. In 1920 he succeeded Charles Cannan as secretary of the Clarendon Press. He played a part in producing the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', combining editorial and administrative responsibilities at the press.&lt;ref name=DLB /&gt;

Although Chapman is generally credited as the scholar who established Austen’s canonical status in the twentieth century, his wife played a key role in igniting his interest in book collecting as well as Jane Austen’s works. He himself cited her antiquarian interests as the inspiration of his book collecting career, and her editions of Pride and Prejudice and Northanger Abbey both preceded Chapman’s own. Her contribution to his work is self-evident in her ubiquitous handwriting in the Chapman archives. However, Chapman’s own negligence in acknowledging his wife’s contribution to his Jane Austen edition caused her work to go uncredited until later scholars such as David Gilson and Kathryn Sutherland proved otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Harman, Claire (2009) ''Jane's Fame'' New York, NY: Henry Holt. pp.154-155 {{ISBN|978-0-8050-8258-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 Chapman produced an edition of five novels of [[Jane Austen]]; further Austen miscellania were published separately in the 1920s and 1930s before being collected together as a sixth volume, ''Minor Works'', of ''The Novels of Jane Austen''. He also edited (1932) Austen's correspondence, though this involved him in some controversy with Austen's critics.&lt;ref name=DLB /&gt;

After retirement from the Clarendon Press in 1943, Chapman worked on "what many consider his greatest accomplishment": a three-volume edition (1952) of [[Samuel Johnson]]'s letters.&lt;ref name=DLB /&gt;

In 1948, Chapman rejected the authenticity of [[the Rice portrait]] of Jane Austen based on costume evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=19693&amp;int_modo=2 Art Daily News]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7297">'''SPECint''' is a [[Benchmark (computing)|computer benchmark]] specification for [[CPU]] [[integer]] processing power. It is maintained by the [[Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation]] (SPEC). SPECint is the integer performance testing component of the SPEC test suite. The first SPEC test suite, CPU92, was announced in 1992. It was followed by CPU95, CPU2000, and CPU2006. The latest standard of SPECint is CINT2006 (aka SPECint2006).

==SPECint 2006==
CPU2006 is a set of benchmarks designed to test the CPU performance of a modern [[Server (computing)|server]] computer system.  It is split into two components, the first being CINT2006, the other being CFP2006 ([[SPECfp]]), for floating point testing.

SPEC defines a base runtime for each of the 12 benchmark programs.  For SPECint2006, that number ranges from 1000 to 3000 seconds.  The timed test is run on the system, and the time of the test system is compared to the reference time, and a ratio is computed.  That ratio becomes the SPECint score for that test. (This differs from the rating in SPECINT2000, which multiplies the ratio by 100.)

As an example for SPECint2006, consider a processor which can run 400.perlbench in 2000 seconds.  The time it takes the [[reference machine]] to run the benchmark is 9770 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrob.com/pub/comp/benchmarks/spec.html |title=The SPEC Benchmarks |date=2003-02-03 |accessdate=2008-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the ratio is 4.885.  Each ratio is computed, and then the [[geometric mean]] of those ratios is computed to produce an overall value.

==Background==
For a fee, SPEC distributes [[source code]] files to users wanting to test their systems.  These files are written in a standard [[programming language]], which is then compiled for each particular CPU architecture and [[operating system]].  Thus, the performance measured is that of the CPU, RAM, and [[compiler]], and does not test [[Input/output|I/O]], [[computer network|networking]], or [[graphics]].

Two metrics are reported for a particular benchmark, "base" and "peak".  Compiler options account for the difference between the two numbers. As the SPEC benchmarks are distributed as [[source code]], it is up to the party performing the test to compile this code.  There is agreement that the benchmarks should be compiled in the same way as a user would compile a program, but there is no consistent method for user compilation, it varies system by system. SPEC, in this case, defines two reference points, "base" and "peak".  Base has a more strict set of compilation rules than peak.  Less optimization can be done, the compiler flags must be the same for each benchmark, in the same order, and there must be a limited number of flags.  Base, then, is closest to how a user would compile a program with standard flags. The 'peak' metric can be performed with maximum compiler optimization, even to the extent of different optimizations for each benchmark.  This number represents maximum system performance, achieved by full compiler optimization.

SPECint tests are carried out on a wide range of hardware, with results typically published for the full range of system-level implementations employing the latest CPUs. For SPECint2006, the CPUs include [[Intel]] and [[AMD]] [[x86]] &amp; [[x86-64]] processors, [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[SPARC]] CPUs, [[IBM]] [[IBM POWER microprocessors|POWER]] CPUs, and [[IA-64]] CPUs.  This range of capabilities, specifically in this case the number of CPUs, means that the SPECint benchmark is usually run on only a single CPU, even if the system has many CPUs.  If a single CPU has [[Multi-core processor|multiple cores]], only a single core is used; [[hyper-threading]] is also typically disabled,

A more complete system-level benchmark that allows all CPUs to be used is known as SPECint_rate2006, also called "CINT2006 Rate".

== Benchmarks ==
The SPECint2006 test suite consists of 12 benchmark programs, designed to test exclusively the integer performance of the system.

The benchmarks are:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.spec.org/cpu2006/CINT2006/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critique==
In the SpecInt2006 benchmarks, the 462.libquantum benchmark is highly vectorizable.  The baseline computer for all benchmarks is a 1997 Sun Ultrasparc server computer.  Whereas most of the spec sub-benchmarks turn in a performance improvement of about 5x to 80x times faster than the Ultrasparc, the particular 462.libquantum sub-benchmark turns in a result that is up to 4082 times faster than the Sun Ultrasparc.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spec.org/cgi-bin/osgresults?conf=cpu2006;op=dump;format=csvdump|date=2013-04-04|accessdate=2013-04-04|title=SPEC Data Dump}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This suggests that for this sub-benchmark, most of the improvements over the Ultrasparc are due to vectorizing compiler improvements, NOT due to CPU hardware improvements, since 1997.

'''St. Louis Southwestern No. 819''' is a [[4-8-4]] [[steam locomotive]]. It was completed in 1943 and was the last engine built by the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, which was affectionately known as the "[[St. Louis Southwestern Railway|Cotton Belt Route]]". It was also the last locomotive built in Arkansas. It is located at the [[Arkansas Railroad Museum]].

==History==

The [[St. Louis Southwestern Railway|Cotton Belt]] initially purchased ten Northern [[4-8-4]] engines (#800–809) from [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]] located at Eddystone, Pennsylvania in 1930. Seven years later, Cotton Belt built five more Northern engines (#810–814) from their own shops in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]] in 1937. These Northern locomotives were Class L1 on the Cotton Belt. 
 
In 1942, Cotton Belt officials petitioned the War Production Board for authorization to buy five new [[EMD FT]] [[diesel locomotives]] for their growing freight business. Instead, they were granted approval to produce five more 4-8-4 type locomotives (#815–819). Although similar to the previous set of five steam engines, these new locomotives had many modern improvements.  
 
Since 819 was built during World War II, some materials were in short supply. The Cotton Belt emblems, which would have normally been made of [[brass]], were made of [[steel]] to save brass for the war effort. Decorative emblems, numbers, etc., were also made of steel and [[chromium plating]] was entirely eliminated. Work on the new L1 Northerns began on Tuesday June 2, 1942. But delivery of the boilers from the Baldwin Locomotive Works lagged. The five new boilers were shipped by Baldwin to Pine Bluff between November 5 and December 12, 1942. The rail journey from Philadelphia to Pine Bluff took about five days for each boiler. Work by the Cotton Belt shop forces took an additional five or six weeks to complete each new locomotive.  
 
On Monday February 8, 1943, the last of these five steam locomotives, Engine 819, was placed in active service. It was the final locomotive constructed by the Cotton Belt's own staff of mechanical engineers, mechanical officers, foremen and workers in the company shops at Pine Bluff, Arkansas. The cost to build was $143,607.00 and it was to be the last locomotive produced in Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;''Pine Bluff Commercial'', February 7, 1943&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Engine 819 traveled more than 804,000 miles during its 10½ years of service, before being forced aside by the more modern diesel locomotives. On July 19, 1955 Cotton Belt's President H. J. McKenzie presented retired Engine 819 to the City of Pine Bluff to show the Cotton Belt's gratitude for the part the city had played in their steam locomotive operations. McKenzie commented that this model engine is generally conceded to be one of the best designed and most attractive of its type ever built. He recalled how the engine had been built by local craftsmen, who were very proud of them and he hoped that the people of Pine Bluff would be equally proud to display it in their public park.

==Retirement==
 
In order to raise money for the cost of moving and constructing a permanent display structure for the engine, the City of Pine Bluff sold "shares" in the locomotive to the school children in [[Jefferson County, Arkansas|Jefferson County]]. Children were requested to "buy" Engine 819 by contributing one penny per pound (the engine &amp; tender weigh 541,300 pounds) and were presented with cards signed by the mayor indicating the number of "shares" purchased. It had been estimated they needed to raise $4,000.00 for the concrete based, metal roofed, pipe framed shed surrounded by a concrete walkway and {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} fence. The problem of getting the locomotive moved to the display was solved when Cotton Belt agreed to lend materials for a temporary spur to the park. Cotton Belt and [[Missouri Pacific]] employees contributed the labor in building the spur and moving the historic locomotive and tender.&lt;ref&gt;''Pine Bluff Commercial'', Hey Kids! You Can Buy Shares in a Real Choo-Choo by Jack Bradley - April 15, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;
 
However, just four years later, the ''Pine Bluff Commercial'' ran this note in the October 6, 1959 edition:
 
:A Commercial newsman's inspection this week of the Cotton Belt locomotive permanently on display on a site between Oakland and Townsend Parks revealed the old steam engine has been neglected by the city. When the railroad donated the engine to the city it did so with the stipulation that the locomotive would receive proper care. Not only had the engine been allowed to deteriorate through rust, the effects of the weather in non-metal portions and acts of vandalism, but the grounds have been allowed to grow up around the fenced-in area so that visitors must trudge through weeds to get an up-close look at the locomotive.&lt;ref&gt;''Pine Bluff Commercial'', October 6, 1959&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It took most of a year to get 819's situation improved. It was decided to move the engine to a new location approximately 150 yards west of its old spot, near the front of the Reserve building. The Pine Bluff [[Jaycees]] spearheaded the drive to build a green and white steel shed at the new location, while the move and reconditioning was being coordinated by members of the [[Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen]] and Cotton Belt employees. Several civic organizations talked of undertaking the project of restoring the engine to better condition, only to find out that such a project required technical know-how that only railmen possessed. That was when BRT stepped in and offered to assist with the engine.

"Before we're through," one of the men said "that old engine will look just like it did the day it rolled out of the shop she was built in. We hope to have her fixed where she'll be better taken care of, too."&lt;ref&gt;''Pine Bluff Commercial'', Trainmen Moving 'Old No. 819' to New Home - September 25, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;
 
During the move to her new location between Townsend and Oakland Parks, Engine 819 "broke loose" and coasted down an incline on her temporary track. The locomotive, after starting to coast, rammed the park's lake embankment and finally stopped against a large black oak tree. The workmen labored the next day to get the engine back on her rails and into place. Crews stated they expected to have the locomotive in her new quarters in about two more weeks.&lt;ref&gt;''Cotton Belt Railroad Historical Society Newsletter''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St. Louis Southwestern 819.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Engine 819 under the shed in the park.]]

Although the engine and tender were successfully relocated during the Fall of 1960, it was several more years before the steel shed was erected overhead to protect the locomotive. In addition to the Pine Bluff Jaycees, the City of Pine Bluff and the Pine Bluff Park Commission each donated $500. Pine Bluff Mayor Franks personally donated $250 and another $250 was donated by the Townsend Park Commission. Gene Gardner, an engineer with [[International Paper]], designed the green and white steel shed and drew up the plans for it. International Paper Company and the Pine Bluff Sand &amp; Gravel Company furnished the concrete footings for the shed, while Varco Steel did the construction work. Construction of the shed was completed in September 1965 when a chain-link fence was installed and the landscaping was finished.

Upon completion of Engine 819's new home in 1965, Mayor Austin Franks shared one of the two keys to the gate with long-time railfan James Norris. Norris' father had taken the locomotive out for her first run in 1943 and young James always remembered his late-father when he saw the engine. Despite being in his late 50s and in failing health, James Norris faithfully visited the locomotive every week to knock off the bird nests and occasionally replace some broken glass in the cab. He would open the gate on Sundays while he was there to let kids climb on the locomotive, ring the bell and answer their many questions.

"Every time I come out here I can see my daddy standing right on that step." Norris said "It kinda gets down in your heart."&lt;ref&gt;''Pine Bluff Commercial'', Locomotive at Oakland Park Now in Shape; Painting Over - September 3, 1965 (page 3)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is uncertain when Mr. Norris' health got so bad that he could no longer continue his weekly maintenance visits to the 819, but he admitted in 1965 that his doctor had told him to stay away from the locomotive. Records indicate that Mr. Norris died in 1970 and by 1983 the ''[[Arkansas Democrat]]'' described the locomotive as "covered in graffiti and vandals have removed, or tried to take, whatever wasn't too heavy to carry off." [[Miss Arkansas]] of 1958, Sally Miller Perdue, from Pine Bluff complained "It had been abandoned and stripped of all its dignity. It has become the iron-horse that was put out to pasture, neglected and abused."

Ms. Perdue, whose family had a long history with the railroad, agreed to chair a sub-committee of the Chamber of Commerce's Publicity &amp; Tourism to get the 819 rejuvenated and relocated. With a slogan of "Let's Put the Steam Back in Pine Bluff", she felt that a lot of volunteers, mainly retired Cotton Belt craftsmen and engineers, would be interested in working to restore the 819. Superintendent R. R. McClanahan of the Cotton Belt Pine Bluff Division worked hard to get the locomotive and tender transported from the park back to the shops to make those repairs.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Democrat'', Former Miss Arkansas Tries to Put the Steam Back Into '819' by Randy Tardy - April 10, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to the Cotton Belt shops==

On December 1, 1983, a force of between 50–100 Cotton Belt employees, most of them volunteers, assisted railfans and rail historical groups, placed Engine 819 back on Cotton Belt rails for the first time in nearly three decades and transported the engine {{convert|3+1/2|mi}} from the park back to the site of its manufacturing 40 years earlier. Members of the newly formed [[Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society]] moved the locomotive back to the Cotton Belt shops, where it was to be restored in a bold project to show Arkansans what past gigantic locomotives looked like.&lt;ref&gt;''Cotton Belt News'', Spring 1984. Vol. 31, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ownership of the locomotive was retained by the city, the restoration of the 819 was the responsibility of "Project 819", an all-volunteer effort by two rail historical preservation groups: the [[Arkansas Railroad Club]] and the Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society. The project leased space needed at the Cotton Belt shops in Pine Bluff to complete the restoration, which was projected to take 18–24 months.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', Restoration of the Old 819 to Start From the Ground Up by Randy Tardy - December 18, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

While the engine languished in the park, various parts disappeared including its bell, whistle, Cotton Belt emblems and many of the gauges. Jake Commer, President of the Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society at the time, offered a "no questions asked" policy for the return of these items and received many of the parts back, including the whistle and one of the emblems. The original bell was never located however and the one currently on the engine is from another 800 class locomotive. That bell was used for many years by the Wesley United Methodist Church in Pine Bluff before being donated to Project 819.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Democrat'', Restoration of Steam Locomotive Chugs Along by Randy Tardy - May 1, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Led by Bill B. Bailey, the Restoration Director for "Project 819", seven separate volunteer groups worked six days a week on various sections of the locomotive and tender in hopes of getting the engine totally restored and federally certified as worthy to run on the rails again. Mr. Bailey estimated that about 20% of the volunteers had actually worked on the locomotive or went through an apprenticeship in the early 1940s when the 819 or other 800-class steam locomotives were built in the Cotton Belt Shops at Pine Bluff.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Engine 819 was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2003.&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt;

== Excursions ==

On April 6, 1986, Engine 819 moved out of the Cotton Belt Route's yard at Pine Bluff marking the first time it had moved under its own power since 1953. The large crowd gathered at the railyard, including a number of railroad employees, burst into applause and shouted their approval as the locomotive's nose emerged from the shop building and into the bright sunshine. The American flag and the Arkansas state flag affixed to the right and left sides of the shiny black engine gave a patriotic air to the event. Members of the Cotton Belt Railroad Historical Society invested over 35,000 man-hours into this restoration project. Jake Commer praised the efforts the Cotton Belt Route had extended stating, "They helped us so much I can't even begin to tell you about all of it. If it hadn't been for the railroad, we couldn't have done it."&lt;ref&gt;''Arkansas Gazette'', '819' on the Rails Again by Philip Launius - April 10, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty days later, on April 26, 1986, Engine 819 pulled into [[Fordyce, Arkansas|Fordyce]] on her first full-fledged trip out of Pine Bluff in 31 years. School children from Pine Bluff, [[Rison, Arkansas|Rison]], Kingsland and Fordyce waved and shouted their delight at the engine. Cars of [[railfans]] followed the train's path, taking pictures.&lt;ref&gt;''Pine Bluff Commercial'', New 819 Rolls out to Cheers by Jane Gore - April 26, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:col train4.jpg|500px|thumb|center|Close-up of Engine 819's cylinders &amp; valve gear]]

On June 13, 1986, Engine 819 participated in the Arkansas State [[Sesquicentennial]] with a trip to [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] and was perhaps Pine Bluff's most visible contribution to the weekend events marking the state's 150th birthday. In addition to Pine Bluff's Mayor Robinson, Louis Ramsay - Chairman of the state's Sesquicentennial Commission, and Judge Earl Chadick, Sr. of Jefferson County, [[Hillary Clinton]] also rode up from Pine Bluff in the opulent VIP car named "The Houston" on loan from the Cotton Belt. Governor [[Bill Clinton]] joined his wife and the other riders on board when the train slowed to a crawl behind [[Barton Coliseum]], just minutes from [[Little Rock (Amtrak station)|Little Rock's Union Station]]. Engine 819 spent the weekend on display at Union Station, just a few blocks north of the state capitol, as part of Arkansas' Sesquicentennial celebration, before returning to Pine Bluff.&lt;ref&gt;''Pine Bluff Commercial'', Engine Travels to Capital by James M. Hopkins - June 14, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer of 1986, film crews came to Pine Bluff for the production of the movie ''[[End of the Line (1987 film)|End of the Line]]''.  Engine 819 played a major role along with 35 Pine Bluff residents turned-actors, many of them members of the Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society who had helped restore the steam engine. Arkansas-born actress [[Mary Steenburgen]] was the film's executive producer, who worked hard to be able to use the newly restored locomotive for the movie.&lt;ref&gt;''Pine Bluff Commercial'', Cameras Roll on 'Hot' Local Star by James M. Hopkins - July 27, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; On August 27, Pine Bluff residents were treated to a special premiere showing of the [[Orion Pictures]] film at the Pine Mall Cinema. Proceeds from the $5.00 tickets were given to the Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society.

For the next seven years, the locomotive traveled on numerous excursions, including a trip to the 1990 NRHS convention in St. Louis, where she stood at [[St. Louis Union Station|Union Station]] with [[Union Pacific Railroad]]'s [[Union Pacific 844|No. 844]], [[SLSF 1522|Frisco No. 1522]] and [[Norfolk &amp; Western 1218|Norfolk &amp; Western No. 1218]]. The last 819 excursion was to Tyler, Texas in October 1993.

Today, the engine is partially disassembled for its mandated 15-year [[Federal Railroad Administration]] inspection. The boiler has been “ultra-sounded” and documented, with only a small area of the firebox remaining to be checked. The flue tubes were removed with plans made for their replacement. A sudden increase in material costs and various emergency repairs needed at the museum over the years have exhausted funds that were hoped to be used to complete the project. The locomotive has sat idle inside the museum, awaiting its return to steam and possible future travels.&lt;ref&gt;"NRHS News" National Railway Historical Society, Chapter Seeks Funds to ‘re-steam’ Locomotive by Steve Rankin, April 2009 Newsletter, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="176893">'''Standards''' in the [[warez scene]] are defined by [[Warez group|groups]] of people who have been involved in its activities for several years and have established connections to large groups.&lt;ref name="War_Times-Razor1911"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=912 |title=War_Times-Razor1911 |date=2004-04-01 |quote=Recently it has been suggested that [[Razor 1911]] turned down an opportunity to become a part of a standards body to define and dictate standards for the ISO scene at large. We would like to take a brief moment now and debunk this myth.}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="invalidFlacV3" /&gt; These people form a committee, which creates drafts for approval of the large groups.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="tdx2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TorrentFreak-SDTV" /&gt; Outside the warez scene, often referred to as [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|p2p]],&lt;!--by sceners themselves--&gt; there are no global rules similar to the scene, although some groups and individuals could have their own internal guidelines they follow.

In warez distribution, all releases must follow these predefined standards to become accepted material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://filenetworks.blogspot.com/2009/11/know-all-about-scene-rules-standards.html |title=Know All About Scene Rules, Standards, Nuking And Nuke Reasons |work=FileNetworks |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708035619/http://filenetworks.blogspot.com/2009/11/know-all-about-scene-rules-standards.html |deadurl=no |archivedate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The standards committee usually cycles several drafts and finally decides which is best suited for the purpose, and then releases the draft for approval.
Once the draft has been e-signed by several bigger groups, it becomes ratified and accepted as the current standard.
There are separate standards for each category of releases. 
All groups are expected to know and follow the standards.&lt;ref name="basamanowicz" /&gt;

==What is defined==
There are rules of naming and organizing files, rules that dictate how a file must be packaged and an nfo file, that contains required information, must be added with the content.&lt;ref name="basamanowicz" /&gt;

===Format===
The first part of a standards document usually defines the format properties for the material, like codec, bitrate, resolution, file type and file size. Creators of the standard usually do comprehensive testing to find optimal codecs and settings for sound and video to maximize image quality in the selected file size.

When choosing file size, the limiting factor is the size of the media to be used (such as 700MB for [[CD-R]]). The standards are designed such that a certain amount of content will fit on each piece of media, with the best possible quality in terms of size.&lt;ref name="xrel-ende-dvd"/&gt; If more discs are required for sufficient quality, the standard will define the circumstances where it is acceptable to expand to a second or third disc. Newer video standards moved away from the size constraints and replaced them with a quality based alternative such as the use of [[Constant rate factor|CRF]].

New [[codec]]s are usually tested annually to check if any offer any conclusive enhancement in quality or compression time. In general, quality is not sacrificed for speed, and the standards will usually opt for the highest quality possible, even if this takes much longer. For example, releases using the [[Xvid]] encoder must use the two-pass encoding method, which takes twice as long as a single pass, but achieves much higher quality; similarly, [[DVD-R]] releases that must be re-encoded often use 6 or 8 passes to get the best quality.

When choosing the file format, platform compatibility is important. Formats are chosen such that they can be used on any major platform with little hassle. Some formats such as [[CloneCD]] can only be used on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] computers, and these formats are generally not chosen for use in the standards.

===Packaging===
Next, the standard usually talks about how to package the material. Allowed package formats today are limited to [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] and [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]], of which the latter is used only in [[Standard (warez)#Applications|0-day]] releases.

The sizes of the archives within the distributed file vary from the traditional 3½" [[floppy disk]] (1.44 [[Megabyte|MB]]) or extra-high density disk (2.88 MB) to 5 MB, 15 MB (typical for CD images) or 20MB (typical for CD images of console releases), 50 MB files (typical for DVD images), and 100MB (for dual-layer DVD images). These measurements are not equivalent to traditional measurement of file size (which is 1024 [[Kilobyte|KB]] to a MB, 1024 MB to a GB); in a typical DVD release, each RAR file is exactly 50,000,000 [[byte]]s, not 52,428,800 bytes (50 [[megabyte]]s in [[binary prefix]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hawa | first1 = M. | last2 = Rahhal | first2 = J. S. | last3 = Abu-Al-Nadi | first3 = D. I. | doi = 10.1007/s12083-011-0122-6 | title = File size models for shared content over the BitTorrent Peer-to-Peer network | journal = Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 279 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly, the size of volumes were limited by the RAR file naming scheme, which produced extensions .rar, .r00 and so on through .r99. This allowed for 101 volumes in a single release before the naming switched to s00, s01 and so on.&lt;!-- example: http://www.srrdb.com/details.php?release=3.On.Stage.Lowlands.2011.E02.DUTCH.WS.PDTV.XviD-iFH --&gt; For example, a [[DVD-R]] image (4.37 GiB), split into 101 pieces, produces volumes smaller than 50 MB. The new RAR naming format, name.part001.rar, removes the limit, although the individual split archives continue to be 50 MB for historical reasons and because the old RAR naming format is still being widely used.

Different compression levels are used for each type of material being distributed. The reason for this is that some material compresses much better than others. Movies and [[MP3]] files are already compressed with near maximum capacity. Repacking them would just create larger files and increase decompression time. Ripped movies are still packaged due to the large file size, but compression is disallowed and the RAR format is used only as a container. Because of this, modern playback software can easily play a release directly from the packaged files,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |title=How to play RAR files without unpacking them? |url=https://scenelingo.wordpress.com/2012/04/22/play-rar/ |work=SceneLingo |date=2012-04-22 |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even stream it as the release is downloaded (if the network is fast enough).

MP3 and [[music video]] releases are an exception in that they are not packaged into a single archive like almost all other sections. These releases have content that is not further compressible without loss of quality, but also have small enough files that they can be transferred reliably without breaking them up. Since these releases rarely have large numbers of files, leaving them unpackaged is more convenient and allows for easier scripting. For example, scripts can read [[ID3]] information from MP3s and sort releases based on those contents.

===Naming===
Rules for naming files and folders are an important part of the standards. Correctly named folders make it easier to maintain clean archives and unique filenames allow dupecheck to work properly. There's a defined character set which can be used in naming of the folders. The selected character set is chosen to minimize problems due to the many platforms a release may encounter during its distribution. Since [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] servers, [[operating systems]] or [[file systems]] may not allow special characters in file or directory names, only a small set of characters is allowed.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.ludibria.com/nfo.php?sys=ps2&amp;sysid=932 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714002327/http://www.ludibria.com/nfo.php?sys=ps2&amp;sysid=932 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-14 |title=Dragon_Quest_VIII_USA_PS2-ECHELON |date=2005-11-16 |publisher=LUDiBRiA |quote=Stop using those absurd file names like blah-gamename.part01.rar, how hard is it to use an 8.3 name really-g.uys Maybe not everyone wants to burn RARs onto [[Joliet (file system)|joilet filesystems]], but aside from that, its just tradition. Once upon a time, you'd be nuked for these kinds of offenses, and just because the scenes become much more public [...] doesn't mean it has to keep on this downward spiral. }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- "This is to avoid problems with windows/linux-filesystem and ftp-servers." --&gt;&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="mp3rules" /&gt; Substitutions are made where special characters would normally be used (e.g. ''ç'' replaced by ''c'') or these characters are omitted, such as an [[apostrophe]]. This can happen automatically by site scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Samurai_Shodown_IV_-_Amakusas_Revenge_USA_REPACK_VC_NEOGEO_Wii-OneUp nfo file |url=http://www.srrdb.com/release/details/Samurai_Shodown_IV_-_Amakusas_Revenge_USA_REPACK_VC_NEOGEO_Wii-OneUp |date=2012-05-03 |author=OneUp |quote=nuke both one is an auto rename because of the '}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a note, spaces are explicitly disallowed in current standards and are substituted with underscores or full stops.&lt;!-- "''NO spaces or double dots - single dots or underscores ONLY''" --&gt;&lt;ref name="txd2k9" group="ruleset" /&gt;

The ubiquitous character set includes the upper- and lower-case English alphabet, numerals, and several basic punctuation marks. It is outlined below:

 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
 abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
 0123456789-._()

A typical example of the folder name of a movie release would be:
 Title.Of.The.Movie.[[Year|YEAR]].[[Pirated movie release types|Source]].[[Codec]]-[[Warez group|GROUP]]
The Xvid scene does not allow the use of [[parentheses]]&lt;ref name="txd2k9" group="ruleset" /&gt; and 
the BDR scene also doesn't allow the use of an [[underscore]],&lt;ref name="BDRrules2" group="ruleset" /&gt; 
while those are common with music releases.&lt;ref name="mp3rules" group="ruleset" /&gt; 
[[Full stop|Dots]] aren't used in the required naming scheme for music videos.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="mvc6" /&gt; 
[[Square brackets]] aren't defined in any ruleset, however they are used by [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|p2p]] groups that do not follow these rules. The best known example is [[aXXo]].

===Date===
Standards documents have often a date defined when the rules take effect. The warez scene typically follows the [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] time standard.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.srrdb.com/showfile.php?release=MasterChef.US.S02E04.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION&amp;file=masterchef.us.204.720p-dimension.nfo |title=MasterChef.US.S02E04.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION |date=2011-06-15 |work=SrrDB |quote=Someone forgot to actually specify a timezone for when the new rules come in to play, but the scene typically follows UTC, so... away we go.}}&lt;!-- 2011-06-15 01:25:48 CET | 39 files | 1.79 GB |
Unnuked: fine_no.rules.in.place.at.time.of.release (LocalNet)
Nuked: crf.setting.used.doesnt.comply.with.any.ruleset (LocalNet)
--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
There is no formal record documenting correct times for all releases. Depending on geographical location and the timing of releases, release sites receive software releases at slightly different times. Release times in any single source may vary by as much as two weeks.&lt;ref name="goode" /&gt;

== Consequences ==
: {{details|Nuke (warez)}}
If a group violates a standard, the release will be [[Nuke (warez)|nuked]].&lt;ref name="TorrentFreak-SDTV" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Craig2005" /&gt; Another group will often ''proper'' the release.&lt;!-- e.g. not when nuked for dupe or MU (see book) --&gt; 
This proper usually requires a sample or a detailed explanation to prove the flaw in the material, unless the flaw was clear enough for the release to be nuked at releasing time.&lt;ref name="txd2k9" group="ruleset"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- XviD rules:
¦   - Releases not nuked on release lists and/or sites MUST include           ¦
¦     original sample of the technical flaw in the release sample dir.        ¦
--&gt; Flaws that aren't immediately visible can be found during testing of the material, such as a broken crack or a bad serial. These sanctions are social in nature and can be initiated by anyone within the community.&lt;ref name="Chandra2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chandra|first1=Priyank|title=Order in the Warez Scene|year=2016|pages=372–383|doi=10.1145/2858036.2858341|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2858036.2858341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video standards==
There are several standards to release movies, TV show episodes and other video material to the scene. VCD releases use the less efficient MPEG-1 format, are low quality, but can be played back on most standalone DVD players. SVCD releases use MPEG-2 encoding, have half the video resolution of DVDs and can also be played back on most DVD players. DVD-R releases use the same format as retail DVD-Videos, and are therefore larger in size. Finally DivX, Xvid, [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] and recently [[High Efficiency Video Coding|HEVC]] releases use the much more efficient MPEG standards. Generally, only middle to top-end [[DVD player]]s can play back DivX or Xvid files, while Blu-ray players are required to handle H.264 files.

There are many different formats because the whole thing was always a function of players, codec development and the pursuit of the best possible quality in terms of size. This results in a series of evolutionary stages and improvements that have been introduced gradually. The only film format that hasn't changed since the early days is the DVDR. The Scene still holds on to this format but it's becoming less important due to Blu-rays being the main source for retail releases.&lt;ref name="xrel-ende-dvd"&gt;{{cite web |title=Das Ende der DVD? |language=German |trans-title=The end of the DVD? |date=2014-03-11 |author=vote |url=http://www.xrel.to/2014-03-11/5332/Das-Ende-der-DVD.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{details|Pirated movie release types}}

===VCD===
Scene rules require the releasing group to spread theatrical [[VCD]]s in [[Cue sheet (computing)|.bin/.cue]] files that can be burned on a CD. Although often the CD size is dictated by the length of the movie or video. One movie typically uses two CDs, although length may force the release to be a 3 or 4 CD release. The source of these theatrical releases is typically analog, such as [[Cam (bootleg)|CAM]], [[Telecine (copying)|telecine]] or [[telesync]] releases (movies recorded by a camera in theatres, often with external audio sources). VCDs from other sources such as DVD, VHS, TV, Pay-Per-View specials, Porn or Anime may also be released in the .mpg or .asf format. DVD and VHS rips are only allowed if there was no screener released before.&lt;ref group="ruleset"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scenerules.irc.gs/t.html?id=vcd.nfo |title=VCD Guidelines}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene VCDs popped up in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defacto2.net/file/detail/9d226/the-net-monkey-weekly-report/ |title=Edition 33: Introduces a VCD section. |author=Bud, Lester, Ndetroit, Prozac |work=The Net Monkey Weekly Report |date=1999-02-02 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but digital unlicensed versions of films already appeared in early 1997 on private FTP networks.&lt;ref name="stevewilson" /&gt; Eviliso, VCD-Europe, FTF and Immortal VCD&lt;!-- iMMVCD --&gt; are groups that have released VCD movies.&lt;ref name="stevewilson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="spoils"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pirates on the Web, Spoils on the Street |first=Jennifer |last=Lee |date=2002-07-11 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/11/technology/pirates-on-the-web-spoils-on-the-street.html?pagewanted=print&amp;src=pm |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 there were 15 to 20 groups.&lt;ref name="stevewilson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/07/circuits/articles/29pira.html |title=Online Piracy: From Music to Film |date=1999-07-29 |first=Steve |last=Wilson |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191119/http://partners.nytimes.com/library/tech/99/07/circuits/articles/29pira.html |archivedate=2016-03-04 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its low quality, VCD releases declined in favor of SVCD and XviD. VCDs are often larger than these higher quality files, making VCDs even less attractive. VCDs once used for music videos got their own set of standards on October 1, 2002.&lt;ref group="ruleset"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scenerules.irc.gs/t.html?id=2003_MViD.nfo |title=Music.Video.Council.2.0.FINAL-MVID_RuLES |date=2005-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SVCD===
Scene rules require the releasing group to spread [[SVCD]]s in [[Cue sheet (computing)|.bin/.cue]] files, that fit on 700 MiB CDs.&lt;ref group="ruleset"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://scenerules.irc.gs/t.html?id=2002_SVCD.nfo |title=The SVCD releasing standards 2002
}}&lt;/ref&gt; One movie typically uses two CDs, although length may force the release to be a 3 or 4 CD release. Content source is sometimes analog, such as [[Cam (movie copyright infringement)|Cam]], [[telecine (piracy)|Telecine]] or [[telesync]] releases. Also [[R5 (bootleg)|R5]], DVDSCR or retail DVD is used as SVCD source.&lt;ref name="vcdqsvcd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vcdq.com/browse/0/0/12/0/0/0/0/0/0/0 |title=VCDQuality.com - SVCD releases |work=Vcdq.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of SVCD is that it can be played on any standalone DVD player, but when DivX-capable players are taking over the market and more bandwidth becomes available to download DVDRs, SVCD became obsolete. Around 2007, the stream of SVCD releases from the scene died out.&lt;ref name="xrel-ende-dvd"/&gt;&lt;!-- "Somit lassen sich die letzten SVCD Releases im Jahr 2008 finden." --&gt;&lt;ref name="vcdqsvcd"/&gt;

MPEG-4 release standards are set in the so-called TDX rules.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="tdx2k2"/&gt; The DivX codec originally gained popularity because it provided a good compromise between film quality and file size.&lt;ref name="Coursework02divx"/&gt; Approximately 25% of the space occupied by DVD is enough for a DivX encode to have DVD quality output.&lt;ref name="dvd-cdr"&gt;{{cite web |title=DivX: DVD quality movies on a CD-R? |first=Andrew |last=Hawkesworth |work=Department of Electronics &amp; Computer Science, University of Southampton |year=2001 |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.12.2040&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first standards were created by meetings and debates of Team DivX (TDX) in 2000. This group consisted of the leaders of the top 5 DivX [[Warez group|releasing groups]], [[Topsite (warez)|topsite]] operators along with [[Ripping|rippers]] and [[Data compression|encoders]]. It was formed because they thought ''the new Div/X scene was a bit unmoderated, sloppy and pretty much a free-for-all.''&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="tdx2000"/&gt; [[The iSONEWS|iSONEWS]] published the first standards on April 26.

The once generally accepted TDX2002 ruleset requires movie releases to contain a [[DivX]] 3.11 or [[Xvid]] encoded video stream with an [[MP3]] or [[Dolby AC-3|AC3]] encoded audio stream in an [[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] container file. Movies are released in one, two or more 700 MiB files, so that they can be easily stored on CD-R.&lt;ref name="dvd-cdr"/&gt; Two or four TV show episodes usually share one CD, hence 175 or 350 MiB releases are common. 233 MiB (three episodes per CD) are more rare but not forbidden, and are often used for full 30-minute programs with no adverts. 233 MiB is more used on whole season rips from retail sources or on single episodes that have a longer runtime.&lt;ref&gt;

More efficient formats such as [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|AVC]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] have not been adopted yet, but are still being pushed by some release groups. There are also considerations to replace the old proprietary AVI file format with a modern container such as [[MPEG-4 Part 14|MP4]] or [[Matroska|MKV]] that can include multiple audio streams, subtitles and DVD-like menus. However, few standalone DVD players support these formats yet, and cross-platform playback is an important consideration. Nonetheless the introduction of MPEG-4 playback capabilities in standalone DVD players was a result of the huge amount of TDX-compliant movie material available on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;

Subject: Re: The.XviD.Releasing.Standards.2009.REBUTTAL-CantBelieveTheMess
From: "staff@nukenet" &lt;staff AT nukenet.info&gt;

Hi,

I've read the txd2k9 rebuttal, and i, amongst the rest of the sane tv &amp; xvid don't believe it is valid.

Point 1:
many popular &lt;30$ xvid players don't fully support resolutions above 640px
on WS movies, the stigma (iirc) chip that is in most of these players messes up the PAR on releases that are &gt;640px making most movies unwatchable.

Point 2:
550mb was chosen as a "middleman" between the two filesizes, and it has had much backing since the leaked (+unofficial) 2007 tv-xvid rules.

Point 3:
The minimum/maximum filesize limits have always existed, they just weren't
explicitly mentioned in bytes in the rules before. halfway sizes are
generally allowed 1.5mb under, and 0.5mb over, as it has always been.

Point 4:
Year tagging has always been like this. Major groups would not sign the
rules if they were required to tag with the year, so the rules would be
useless if they had no backing. No sites would enforce this rule. It has
generally been, as long as the movie was previous or current year production, no year tag is required (although some nukenets enforce year on lesser more easily bullied groups)

Point 5:
Again, multiple avi's packed in a single rar. As always. Nothings changed.

Point 6:
TXD has always been for RETAIL sources, DVDSCR, WP aren't retail sources.
Although txd was made for retail sources, most rules apply to non-retail
sources also, however some aren't enforceable on non-retail sources.
(DVDSCR/DVDSCREENER + WP/WORKPRINT tags have always been used, it wouldn't
be possible to enforce groups to use one tag over the other, so it isn't
mentioned)

Point 7:
People in the know tend to know the repack reasons, or will ask the group
themselves. It isn't possible to enforce repack reasons in nfo's, so again, it isn't required.

Point 8:
It was deemed anything above 448kbps audio would make the video bitrate
suffer to much.

Point 9:
Badly done watermark removal will get propered regardless, it's up to the
groups to decide what method and scripts they use to remove/blurr them.

Point 10:
Not enforceable. Credits aren't allowed to be stripped, but they aren't
regarded as important. Many groups re-encode the credits at a lower bitrate, but it isn't noticeable (DOMiNO, FICO, VH-PROD, VoMiT come to mind).

Point 11:
Nuking for an undersized sample would never fly. moot issue.

Point 12:
Again, txd is mainly meant for retail sources. retail sources don't have
this issue. moot point.

Point 13:
Impossible to enforce.

The person who wrote the rebuttal is very well known in the tv/xvid scene,
and was specifically not invited to the meetings, as everyone knew he would try to push through trivial and time wasting things, in comparison to the txd2k5 rebuttal which has some valid points.

Hope this helps you understand why I didn't put the rebuttal on the website,

The introduction of [[HDTV]] and the availability of high-definition source material has resulted in the release of video files that exceed the maximum allowed resolution by the TDX rules, which anticipated [[DVD-Video]] rips as the ultimate source. Due to a missing standard these releases follow different rules. They are usually tagged as [[HR HDTV]] and use half the resolution of 1080i (960 × 540 px, vertically cropped to 528 or 544 px). Some releases also use a resolution of 1024 × 576 px to provide a proper aspect ratio of 16:9. Occasionally, shows (usually animated shows) aired in Standard Definition (PDTV) are often uploaded as HR (high resolution) PDTV using the H264 codec which offers much better compression than XviD, allowing a higher resolution in a file the same size as an XviD encoded video using a Standard Definition source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lost.S02E04.HR.HDTV.AC3.5.1.XviD-CTU |url=http://www.srrdb.com/release/details/Lost.S02E04.HR.HDTV.AC3.5.1.XviD-CTU |website=srrDB |author=CTU |date=2005-10-13 |quote=HR HDTV is a format originated by us in 2003, under our former group name of FUA.}}&lt;!-- Pre date: 2005-10-13 06:24:44 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 2012, more than a year after the appearance of the first draft,&lt;ref name="SDTVx2642011draft" group="ruleset" /&gt; the [[SD video|SD]] [[x264]] TV Release Standards document was released with the goal ''to bring quality control back to the SD releases''. According to the document x264 has become the most advanced [[H264]] video encoder&lt;!--Update.1--&gt; and compared to XviD it is able to provide higher quality and compression at greater SD resolutions. It also allows better control and transparency over encoding settings. With [[Constant rate factor|CRF]] (constant rate factor) in the mix it can be ensured that a diverse array of material will get the most appropriate [[Bitrate#Multimedia encoding|bitrate]] and not arbitrary fixed file sizes. The video container must be [[MPEG-4 Part 14|MP4]] and [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] is used for the audio. Thirteen groups, ASAP, BAJSKORV, C4TV, D2V, DiVERGE, FTP, KYR, LMAO, LOL, MOMENTUM, SYS, TLA and YesTV signed the document and began releasing TV shows in the new format.&lt;ref name="SDTVx2642012" group="ruleset" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TorrentFreak-SDTV" /&gt;&lt;ref name=SD_gizbrooker&gt;

A second reason FQM provided was that partial files can't be played back but LOL wrote the next day that the streaming issues were solved. On March 29, an updated version of the rules were released. This time 22 groups supported the document.&lt;!--New: aAF, BARGE, COMPULSiON, FUtV, OTV, RiVER, TASTETV, TRANSiENCE, W4F--&gt; MP4Box became the recommended [[muxer]] because it has support for file streaming and playing from [[RAR (file format)|RARs]].

Adding clarity and patching loopholes to once again allow for consistent and quality releases, which was the aim of this standard back in 2012.'' The video container in this revision was changed from [[MPEG-4 Part 14|mp4]] to [[matroska|mkv]] which frustrated many users.&lt;ref name="TF-TV2016"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/pirates-frustrated-after-tv-release-groups-swap-mp4-for-mkv-160408/ |title=Pirates Frustrated After TV Release Groups Swap .MP4 for .MKV |author=Ernesto |date=2016-04-08 |website=[[TorrentFreak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Xvid and x264 sport rips====
On June 24, 2009, five groups released the first rule set specifically designed for [[x264]] sport releases: TXSRS2K9. The idea was that the x264 encoder would be more suitable than [[Xvid]]. &lt;ref group="ruleset"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://scenerules.irc.gs/t.html?id=2009_X264_SPORTS.nfo |title=The.x264.Sports.Releasing.Standards.2009 |date=2009-06-21 |quote=x264 dupes xvid, use internal. Xvid doesn't dupe x264, hopefully all groups will move to x264 for sports then we can ban xvid for sports as it cannot cope with high motion sports, however better sources don't dupe xvid}}&lt;!--

--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some days after preing the rule set, a rebuttal was released with concerns about the decisions made and them being in conflict with the high definition TV-X264 rule set.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.scenenotice.org/details.php?id=1722 |title=The.x264.Sports.Releasing.Standards.2009.REBUTTAL-AreYouSerious |date=2009-06-24 |quote=Unless you're planning to push a SPORTS-X264 section, these rules conflict with the TV-X264 rules already in effect.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, a rule set for Xvid sports releases appeared: TXSRS10. Its aim is to improve the overall quality of sports releases while retaining the compatibility that Xvid provides. It should bring standardization and get rid of restrictions applicable to the ''ruleless world of TV-XVID''.&lt;ref name="2010sport" group="ruleset"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.scenenotice.org/details.php?id=1727 |title=The.2010.XviD.Sports.Releasing.Standards-SportsReleaseCouncil |date=2010-03-08 |quote=The Sports Release Council was formed to separate sports releases from the ruleless world of TV-XVID. This standard aims to improve the overall quality of our sports releases while retaining the compatibility we have enjoyed for so long. We hope to bring standardization to our scene and rid ourselves of some of the archaic quality-hampering restrictions that the sports scene has had to put up with based on the preferences/assumptions of nukers.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve groups signed the standards, including two of the original five of the x264 rule set.

The SD x264 TV Releasing Standards 2012 also cover sport releases, making the previous standards obsolete.&lt;ref name="SDTVx2642012" group="ruleset" /&gt;

===High definition video===

====x264 for retail sources====
The latest [[high-definition video|High Definition]] [[x264]] Standard is Revision 4.0 from 2011.&lt;ref group="ruleset"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scenerules.irc.gs/t.html?id=2011_X264.2.nfo |title=High.Definition.x264.Standards.Revision.4.0-HDX |date=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ruleset targets [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] sourced [[720p]] and [[1080p]] movie and TV-show rips. The releases are made available in a Matroska .[[matroska|mkv]] container, using the [[x264]] encoder. The file size must be a multiple of 1120 MiB.&lt;ref name="TorrentFreak-HD" /&gt; 
It has become quite normal that non-English spoken movies are tagged with their language tag, even when they contain English subtitles. This is different for Xvid releases.&lt;!-- or audio. Bambi.1942.DUTCH.1080p.BluRay.x264-HDEX --&gt; This practice has been accepted by all nukenets, but it was never written down in an addendum to the ruleset. Also the usage of both Dutch and Flemish audio tracks in one release has become a practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New.Kids.Nitro.2011.DUTCH.READNFO.1080p.BluRay.x264-VeDeTT |url=http://www.srrdb.com/showfile.php?release=New.Kids.Nitro.2011.DUTCH.READNFO.1080p.BluRay.x264-VeDeTT&amp;file=vedett-nwkdsntr1080p.nfo |author=VeDeTT |work=SrrDB |accessdate=2012-06-09 |date=2012-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a second ruleset from 2008 for x264 releases that has many similarities to the previous one, but it concentrates on [[Blu-ray Disc#BD9 and BD5|BD5]] and [[Blu-ray Disc#BD9 and BD5|BD9]] releases.&lt;ref group="ruleset"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scenerules.irc.gs/t.html?id=2008_BD.nfo |title=2008.BD.Standards}} High Definition x264 Standards (BD5/9)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
The purpose of these releases is that the initial [[matroska|mkv]] file can be burned as a Blu-ray image to a single or double-layer [[DVD-R]]. The mkv file accompanying this kind of release is 200-300MB smaller than a similar release following the other ruleset due to the overhead of the Blu-ray image that will be created.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.srrdb.com/details.php?release=ConAir.1997.720p.BD5.x264-DOWN |title=ConAir.1997.720p.BD5.x264-DOWN |date=2009-05-14 |work=SrrDB}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Around May 2012, the stream of BD9 releases came to a halt. 2011 only had around thirty BD5 releases.&lt;!-- 27 .BD5. on pre.corrupt-net.org; 2008-05-09 12:44:04 Sky.Fighters.2005.720p.BluRay.BD5.x264-DOWN the first BD5 release? --&gt;

====x264 for anime====
On August 13, 2009, the first version of the standard was released. This standard is only a recommendation for [[anime]] from Blu-ray and its purpose is to improve quality over the then current HDX standard. The document reads that anime was always something special for the video codec experts at [[Doom9]]. Without anime there wouldn't be any [[VirtualDub]] or many other video related things at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualdub.org/virtualdub_history.html |title=VirtualDub history |work=VirtualDub.org |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is why they decided to put out new standard to enjoy almost lossless anime quality.&lt;ref name="anime" group="ruleset"&gt;{{cite web |date=2009-08-13 &lt;!--20:52:14--&gt;

Because of the x264 scene, many people think WMV-HD is redundant. The authors of the first document think this is not true because of the compatibility WMV-HD provides. They write that the only reason many people are against WMV-HD, is because [[Windows Media Video|WMV]] is from Microsoft. In 2007 they wrote that it can be played on the [[Xbox 360]] and [[Home theater PC|HTPC]]'s while x264 is restricted to HTPC's. They point out that many movie studios utilize the [[VC-1]] codec for their retail BD-ROMs.&lt;ref name="wmvhd2007" group="ruleset" /&gt;

The changes in the 2008 ruleset were made because 1080p was getting more and more popular and the authors felt it was necessary to lower the 720p bitrate minimum as well to show x264 lovers WMV is equal quality. The video size wasn't determined by the length of the movie anymore, but by the minimum bitrate.&lt;ref name="wmvhd2008" group="ruleset" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wmvhd2007" group="ruleset" /&gt;

In the 2009 standards, a [[Nuke (warez)|nuke]] section was added to govern the WMV-HD section. All nukes based on any other rules are unacceptable. Because all the groups releasing WMV-HD have agreed to and signed this rule set, they are the only ones who will develop, implement, and mandate the rules governing the WMV-HD section. The groups are IGUANA, NOVO, BamHD and INSECTS. SMeG was added too in later versions.&lt;!--DEViANT is an other group that signed the 2k7 document--&gt;&lt;ref name="wmvhd2009" group="ruleset" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wmvhd35" group="ruleset" /&gt;

A special section for animated/anime titles was added in version 3.5 of the rule set.&lt;ref name="wmvhd35" group="ruleset" /&gt;
Version 4.0 of the rule set had a large ascii art added and was the first to have no minimum or maximum file size requirement for the final WMV file. WMV-HD was from then on purely quality driven by minimum bitrate.&lt;ref name="wmvhd40" group="ruleset" /&gt;
In version 4.1 the rule set was added that the group who releases an episode of a show first has exclusive rights to do the entire season of that show for a period of thirty days. This means that during those 30 days no other group can release an episode of the same show and season without being nuked.&lt;ref name="wmvhd41" group="ruleset" /&gt;

The source for a WMV release must be [[HD DVD]] or [[Blu-ray]].&lt;!--no HDTV etc.--&gt; The audio has to be encoded to [[Windows Media Audio#Windows Media Audio Professional|WMA 10 Pro]]&lt;!--minimum of 640 kbit/s WMA3 Pro 5.1 before that--&gt; and the video codec must be [[Windows Media Video#Windows Media Video|Windows Media 9 Advanced Profile]] (VC-1). A [[720p]] resolution dupes [[1080p]] but 1080p does not dupe 720p. The WMV file must be in stored in [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] with a recovery record. Compression is not allowed.&lt;ref name="wmvhd41" group="ruleset" /&gt;

In 2013, at least ten new movie releases were seen, all released by the group INSECTS.&lt;!-- The.Croods.2013.BluRay.1080p.VC1.5.1.WMV-INSECTS is the last release from 2013. 2013-11-01 09:49:34 --&gt; This category died out in favor of x264 MKV releases, a format that is ubiquitous for non pornographic ripped video in 2016.&lt;!--SD TV last category that switched over in 2016, except for retail SD XXX that still uses MP4--&gt;

The first ever scene TV-x264 release, ''The.Unit.S01E04.HD720p.x264-MiRAGETV'', was made by Spatula in early 2006.&lt;!--I can't find the release in predbs, but it would be on/after the day the episode aired (2006-03-29) and before The.Unit.S01E08.HD720p.x264-MiRAGETV (2006-04-30).--&gt;&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="tvx2642011-2"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2007, more than a year later, the first ruleset appeared.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="TVX2642K7"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; SAiNTS refused to sign this ruleset because it did not ban segmenting.

A fixed file size for the resulting .mkv was used based on the shows length.

The 2011 standards first introduced [[Constant rate factor|CRF]], instead of 2-pass based encoding.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="TVx2642k11"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, a total rewrite of the ruleset was released, addressing all known issues and patching loopholes.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="tvx264-2016"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--
A couple of revisions are or have been nuked. Questionable validity according to http://scenerules.irc.gs/. How was the response of the scene groups? Which nfos should I look at?
We should list all the versions?
All the CRF stuff, what's the story behind that? Links to nfos like in SD would be nice.

Conclusion

Grps, who created the new rules do CRF. Except aAF, FTP and NGCHD, but could be timezone issues. 
DIMENSION, 2HD, BAJSKORV and HILSWALTB switched sides to CRF. 
Nukes stopped after The.Nine.Lives.of.Chloe.King.S01E01.720p.HDTV.X264-DIMENSION. 
Settings are still undecided, but DIMENSION's suggestion seems good.

In 2016, a new standard was introduced for [[World Wide Web|web]]-sourced files, covering standard and high definition video. Web based streaming and video on-demand services have increased in popularity.

According to XeoN-VorTeX on October 31, 2002, a milestone in DVDR ripping was reached with the COMPLETE release of [[The Matrix]]. The DVD was generally regarded as the most complex DVD on the market. Only a movie only rip was available. The new rip included things such as the [[White Rabbit#Television and films|white rabbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The.Matrix.1999.COMPLETE.READNFO.PAL.DVDR-XV |date=2002-10-31 |quote=XeoN-VorTeX are proud to bring you the milestone in DVDR ripping, with the COMPLETE release of The Matrix. This DVD is Generally regarded as the most complex DVD on the market, and thus, only a movie only rip has been available; until now.

Over 200 hours have been spent creating this DVDR and throughout this project, a guide has been updated with the new techniques required to process such a DVD.

 Read nfo notes:
 Okay, we know we did this movie a while back, but no site seemed to have kept
 it, and the one version that does exist (but hard to find again) is missing the
 sample and nfo. So we thought we'd redo this movie again, since it's so damn
 awesome, but this time, we included the menus, director's cut commentary and
 also one of the extras. The menu is a pop-up menu, which is very nice and 
 easily accessed when watching the movie.

 Old notes:
 Okay, this is what we like to think would be a great breakthrough in the BDR
 scene, we have accomplished making a release which is fully functional in both
 in your BluRay standalone (we've tested it with our PS3) and it works fine!
 But what's so great about that? All other releases from us have worked too you
 say? Well, we have now included a working menu, as well as working extras, only
 stripping fbi warnings, plus some more items. Some of the extras have been 
 removed in order to keep a decent bitrate.
 We are very happy to have achieved this, and we are hoping for the other grps,
 who still do complete BluRays which weigh in at about 30-50GB, to follow us.
 But that's not all folks! Since our BluRay releases have no trace of copyrights
 left intact, they should be playable on any linux machine :)
 We also thought a new grpname would be good because of this discovery, hence the
 change.

 Be sure to checkout the BDR rules pred at 2009-05-28 that will be effective as
 of 2009-06-01.

  Mirage strongly endorses six rules concerning XXX as established
  by the scene approved Adult Movies Release Rules Revision {{sic|Comm|itee|expected=Committee}}
  headed by Smut and Mirage:

  a) production year must be: 2003-2004
  b) release date within 1 month of official store date. always by first available media (DVD/VHS)
  c) all our releases discs fit on 80min CD's
  d) 3 CD releases are ok for first run features but not for amateur or compilations
  e) all releases must have a VHS street date in the url and nfo, unless they are released first in DVD!
  f) software encoded quality captured releases are a must. too many poorly hardware capped releases floating around.

Standards for DVDR, [[paysite]] videos and imagesets have been released before.

==Audio standards==
Both [[MP3]] and [[FLAC]] releases can optionally include [[M3U]] playlist files.

===Lossy audio: MP3===
At the start of the MP3 scene in 1995, there was little organization or standardization.&lt;ref name="Wal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rau" /&gt; Between 1999-2004, the pre-dominantly used MP3 encoding quality was 192 kbit/s at 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz, which was nominal for the hardware and software encoding available at the time. This improved as computers got faster and the [[LAME]] MP3 encoder developed into its later versions.
&lt;!-- to be written: the sources are there! and check mp3scene.info --&gt;

Due to broad support in hardware devices, unauthorized audio material is usually released in [[MP3]] files at [[variable bit rate|VBR]] quality. In 2007, new rules put forth that it is recommended to encode all files with Lame 3.97, using the "-V2 --vbr-new" switch.&lt;ref group="ruleset"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scenerules.irc.gs/t.html?id=2007_MP3v1.1.nfo|title=Official_MP3_Release_Rules_1.1-2007-MP3COUNCIL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other formats such as [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] or [[Vorbis]] are currently not allowed.

In 2009, new rules were introduced.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="mp3rules"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scenerules.irc.gs/t.html?id=2009_MP3.nfo |title=Official_MP3_Release_Rules_2.0-2009-MP3COUNCIL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Homemade releases are forbidden.  Every release needs an [[ID3v1.1|ID3 v1.1]] AND [[ID3v2|ID3 v2]] tag.  Extra material that is available on the source material is allowed to be released. [[USB flash drive#Music storage and marketing|Flash storage mediums]] are allowed as sources to accommodate some retail releases made exclusively in those formats.

The early MP3 release groups, 1996-1997, were considered "[[lamers]]", bottom feeders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Where do you want to pirate today? |author=Adam L.

On October 2, 2011 the scene introduced a FLAC category by releasing a first ruleset.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="FLACv1.0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FLAC setzt sich durch - Neues Ruleset in der Musik-Szene|url=http://www.xrel.to/2011-10-09/3564/FLAC-setzt-sich-durch.html|date=2011-10-09|author=vote|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eight days later an updated revision was released.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="FLACv1.1" /&gt; According to the documents, the ruleset was created to satisfy the long lasting audiophile's demand for a music scene of higher quality than LAME mpeg compression encoding and because space and bandwidth were able to accommodate more. To avoid previously made mistakes in the music scene, a group of elder sceners gathered to decide upon the rules. A common understanding amongst all was that material from non-physical media can easily be of doubtful origin of source and hence of questionable quality. The rules consider only physical media as a valid source and they must be followed very strictly.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- pre date: 2011-10-24 10:12:57 --&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=2086 |title=Kanye_West-My_Beautiful_Dark_Twisted_Fantasy-PROPER-CD-FLAC-2010-PERFECT |author=PERFECT |date=2011-10-24 |website=SceneNotice.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of releases are being nuked for various cosmetic flaws.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--ref is an example--&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=2174 |title=RV800-Subsync-(FORM001)-READNFO-VINYL-FLAC-2012-dL |author=dL |date=2013-09-22 |quote=I feel a bit sorry, that a nuker who sits with his computer without the same experience and knowledge, interprets parts of the rules like they were carved into stone, unaware how the physical music industry works and has developed over the last 3 decades.  Use your common sense, instead of creating strife.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 2016, anonymous sceners voiced a concern that nukers lack technical understanding to nuke improperly ripped vinyl sources and showed examples of how the ruleset gets twisted or misinterpreted for minor issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Candlemass-Nightfall-PROPER-READNFO-LP-FLAC-1987-TRUE2496 |author=TRUE2496 |date=2016-01-31 |url=https://layer13.net/rls?id=7129210 |website=Layer13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Candlemass-Ancient_Dreams-PROPER-LP-FLAC-1988-TRUE2496--&gt; The release got nuked within the hour&lt;!--39m 7s--&gt; after pre by ZoNeNET with just ''invalid.proper'' as reason. In June later that year, 4 years after version 2.0, a new ruleset was made to address misinterpretations in the wording and to update some rules.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="FLACv3.0" /&gt;

In response to version 3 of the rules, a scene notice called the rules invalid because it was not created by leading groups in the section or a council. It also pointed out that its block on [[World Wide Web|WEB]] and [[Promotional recording|PROMO]] releases causes a void due to the digital only distribution of many originals .&lt;ref name="invalidFlacV3"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=2354 |title=INVALID_OFFICIAL_FLAC_STANDARD_RULES_V3.0-SCENENOTICE |date=2017-01-09 |website=SceneNotice.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group CUSTODES mentioned in their farewell message that the FLAC ruleset isn't professional enough to archive music in the best quality possible.&lt;ref name="custodes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=2366 |title=Farewell.CUSTODES-CD-FLAC-2017-CUSTODES |date=2017-02-12 |author=CUSTODES |website=SceneNotice.org |quote=The main goal of archive music in the best quality possible isn't from any real interest.

===Applications===
Application releases are usually split in two different categories, 0-day and ISO apps.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="zeroday2010.1"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://scenerules.irc.gs/t.html?id=2010.1_0DAY.nfo |title=Zeroday.Scene.Rules.v2010.1-Rules}}

--&gt; 0-day (pronounced as zero day) refers to any copyrighted work that has been released the same day as the original product, or sometimes even before.&lt;ref name=0dayartTheVerge&gt;{{cite web|last=Kopfstein|first=Janus |title=0-Day Art: saving digital art one torrent at a time - Net pirate provocateurs challenge the monetization of online works |url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/23/2961601/0-day-art-digital-art-torrents-piracy|work=TheVerge|date=2012-04-23|accessdate=2012-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gehring" /&gt; 
It is considered a mark of skill among warez distro groups to crack and distribute a program on the same day of its commercial release.

*0-day applications are usually 150MB or smaller, but can be 5GB or larger as long as they are not CD/DVD images. The release format allows almost anything in 0-day section, but often 0day releases are [[Software cracking|cracks]] or [[keygen]]s for different applications or small games with size varying from 1-50MB. Sometimes [[e-book]]s, imagesets, fonts or mobile software are released as 0-day. Executable programs such as keygens and cracks are often [[Executable compression|compressed]] with the open source [[UPX]] packer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Andy |date=2016-09-26 |title=MacOS Sierra Breaks Popular Keygens, Pirate Finds Fix |url=https://torrentfreak.com/macos-sierra-breaks-popular-keygens-pirate-finds-fix-160926/ |work=[[TorrentFreak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:LineZer0 indicated in the nfo file of their 20,000th release that they will change their packing ways to RAR/SFV and put the old ZIP/RAR/DIZ packaging to rest by the first of April 2012. They strongly encouraged other groups to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lz0 |date=2012-03-18 |title=PTC.Mathcad.Prime.v2.0.20000TH.RELEASE.READ.NFO-Lz0 |url=http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=2077 |work=SceneNotice.org |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;!--
This release will also mark the beginning of a new era. By the
first of April 2012 we will change our packaging ways to
RAR/SFV and put the old ZIP/RAR/DIZ packaging to rest. It is
long overdue, and this ancient way of packing has no meaning
in 2012. We strongly encourage all other groups to do the same
? and site operators, all you need to do is to add the 0DAY
path to the SFV path of your setup, and your site will during
the transition period do fine with both packaging standards.
It?s time to move forward. 
--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After some threats to release information on individuals, Lz0 returned to the old packaging ways for the time being until a new ruleset can be put in place.&lt;ref&gt;

a joint meeting now that groups finally are ready to get
together again, and perhaps aim for a more futuristic rule
set.
For the time being, until a new rule set can be put in
place, we will then return to the old (and very much
outdated) packaging ways of ZIP/DIZ. We will still push for
the change, and we do hope that others will share our
thoughts when a joint meeting will happen, and proper
discussions without childish actions can take place.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

:The Minor Update (MU) rule is unique to 0-day releases. It makes sure that each month not more than one release of the same application is released. Major updates do not follow this rule. The exception to the rule happens when a group motivates in their NFO that the changes are considered to be a major update.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="zeroday2010.1"/&gt; For example the group Unleashed choose to ignore the MU rule for a [[hotfix]], making a less blurry game available two weeks sooner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Clustertruck.incl.Hotfix.RIP.READ.NFO-Unleashed NFO |date=2016-09-28 |quote=NOTE: MU rule is pointless, when this hotfix updates most of the game content and without this fix, game is damn blurry.

*[[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] rules require folder naming to define which application and version the release contains.&lt;ref group="ruleset"&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://scenerules.irc.gs/t.html?id=2002_PDA.nfo |title=The PDA releasing standards |date=2002-04-14}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Also required are CPU type, operating system and cracktype. Optional information such as language is expected, if the release is non-English. Packaging follows 0day guidelines. Generally lax security, simple programming and small filesizes make mobile software an attractive target for infringers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dickinson|first=Eli|title=Mobile Software Piracy|url=http://www.fiercedeveloper.com/report/mobile-pda-software-piracy-and-warez|work=FierceDeveloper|accessdate=2012-04-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819054054/http://www.fiercedeveloper.com/report/mobile-pda-software-piracy-and-warez|archivedate=2010-08-19|deadurl=no|date=November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent times it covers other portable devices such as [[iPod]], [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] or systems running [[Android (operating system)|Android]].

*ISO applications are usually either in BIN/CUE or [[ISO image|ISO]] format. Allowed media is CD and DVD, but release can be smaller than the media size.

===Game rips===
This is the scene for game releases that are changed to minimize the size of the distributed files. A first ten point document was made by "The Faction" in 1998. The grouping that created the rules that should be adhered to, and the rules themselves, were disbanded the following year. The NSA rules, or "the new rules", outlines the codes of conduct regarding game ripping. Releasing can be done in two fields: games and applications. It can also be done in two ways: it is possible to release disc images or groups can 'rip'. In the process of ripping, groups remove things such as introductory movies, multiple texture modes, big sound files and the like.&lt;ref name="OrderedMisbehavior" /&gt;

===Games===
The game must fit on CDs or DVDs, and the format should be either BIN/CUE, or ISO, respectively. Some sites allow CCD images too, as defined in the site's rules. Media descriptor files (MDF/MDS) seem to be permitted now as well.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="NSA"&gt;

===DOX===
DOX is an abbreviation of ''documents'' or ''documentation'' (manuals). This category includes video game add-ons such as [[No-CD crack|No-CDs]], cracked updates, [[keygen]]s, covers, [[Trainer (games)|trainers]] or [[cheat codes]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Console standards==
The console scene survived decades without rules.&lt;ref name="Playstation3Response" /&gt; In 2009, a first set of rules for the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]], [[Xbox 360]] and the [[Wii]] was released.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="console2k9"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=758 |title=Console.Standards.2009-CONSOLE |date=2008-11-10}}&lt;!-- 2008-11-11 01:04:10 CET --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It's remarkable that a release must be pred no later than 30 days after retail date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=757 |title=Reply.To.2k9.Console.Rules-x360inT |work=Scenenotice |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the 0-day standards, most other rulesets nowadays don't have such limitations.

No folders were used.&lt;ref name="N64relto2001" /&gt; The ROM extensions "[[Doctor V64|.v64]]" and ".[[z64]]" were used as naming conventions. Shortly before the closure of 64dd.net in January 2015, there were 883 releases numbered on the site. The last releases listed were done by the group Carrot in 2012.&lt;ref name="64dd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://64dd.net/modules/specials/index.php?sa0000 |title=Nintendo 64 ROM Release List |work=64dd.net |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114105556/http://64dd.net/modules/specials/index.php?sa0000 |archivedate=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- https://web.archive.org/web/20070211221122/http://wiki.pocketheaven.com/Rom_Numbering
Rom Numbering is the somewhat absurd habit of numbering any valid releases in the order that they are released.

The origin and reasons for this numbering is shrouded in mystery, but the N64 Scene was the first to have their releases numbered by the website Dextrose. Since then scenes to have their releases numbered include GBC, WonderSwan, GBA and DS.

It should be noted that the people in the actual scene don't condone numbering at all, and the numbering and cataloguing is usually handled by websites unrelated to the scene.

Numbering often leads to much drama and arguing over which roms to count as valid for numbering, or even which the correct order the valid releases came out in.

http://www.doperoms.com/faq.php

What are all those weird (UEJ) [!] symbols next to the name of the ROM?
These are symbols used by Cowering's GoodTools to help us further identify the specific type of ROMs we have.--&gt;

===Wii===
[[Wii]] releases must be in standard DVD [[ISO image|ISO]] format.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="console2k9" /&gt; The [[RAR (file format)|rar archives]] must use compression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ludibria.com/nfo.php?sys=wii&amp;sysid=5221 |title=Endless_Ocean_2_PROPER_PAL_Wii-WiiZARD |date=2010-02-05 |accessdate=2010-02-13 |publisher=LUDiBRiA |quote=The iCON release had m0 compression, enjoy this WiiZARD proper.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PARADOX (warez)|PARADOX]] released the first Wii image on December 12, 2006.

On April 14, 2008, ''BlaZe'' was the first group to release a [[Virtual Console]] title.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://ludibria.com/nfo.php?sys=wii&amp;sysid=820 |title=Donkey.Kong.Country.2.Diddys.Kong.Quest.VC.PAL.Wii-BlaZe |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2010-02-13 |publisher=LUDiBRiA |quote=BlaZe brings you the first Virtual Console release. These are the raw, unencrypted files. To install this title, pack it into a [[Wii WAD|WAD]] using your favourite wad packer (for the moment, there are no public ones) And install them using an elf installer, or a modified ISO that installs the WAD.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emulated [[SNES]] [[Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest]] finally had a proper dump after its fourth release more than a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ludibria.com/index.php?sys=wii&amp;srg=Donkey.Kong.Country.2.Diddys.Kong.Quest |title=LUDiBRiA - Wii Releases: search result |accessdate=2010-02-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Downloadable content|DLC]] releases are tagged ''[[Virtual Console|VC]]'' or ''[[WiiWare]]'' and exist of a packed [[Wii WAD|WAD]] file. A large amount of these first releases were [[Nuke (warez)|nuked]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ludibria.com/index.php?sys=wii&amp;srg=.VC. |title=LUDiBRiA - Wii Releases: search result |accessdate=2010-02-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main nuke reason was ''modified.ticket.info''.

===Wii U===
On May 3, 2013, the group VENOM released the first game for the [[Wii U]]: [[Marvel Avengers: Battle for Earth]]. The disk image is a .iso file in Wii U Optical Disc format (WUOD), Nintendo's proprietary disc format for the Wii U. Like other console scene firsts, the game isn't playable on the console yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srrdb.com/release/details/The_Avengers_Battle_for_Earth_PAL_WiiU-VENOM |work=SrrDB |title=The_Avengers_Battle_for_Earth_PAL_WiiU-VENOM |quote=Today we give you the first full WiiU disc image! |date=2013-05-03}}&lt;!-- [2013-05-03 07:02:37 GMT] [ WIIU | 23823.4MB in 100F ]--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This first scene release was a few days after the Wii U was announced to be allegedly hacked by the mod chip developer [[WiiKey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/01/nintendo-wii-u-hack/ |title=Wii U allegedly hacked, Nintendo addresses would-be pirates (updated) |first=Mark |last=Hearn |date=2013-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the file date of the RAR archives, VENOM had already created the ISO file more than a month before [[predb|pre]]&lt;!--2013-03-24 to be exact--&gt;. This is the point in time when they first made the files available within the scene through their affiliated [[Topsite (warez)|sites]].&lt;ref name="Craig2005" /&gt;
Later, Venom's Release was found to be a bad dump, so the real first Wii U game dumped was by PoWeRUp, which has been confirmed as PROPER.

===Xbox One===
On November 19, 2013, a couple of days before the official console launch date, the group COMPLEX released the first game for the [[Xbox One]]: ''[[Call of Duty: Ghosts]]''. The release contained a 42GB .iso file without the security sectors. The file system format of the disk is XGD4 (Xbox Game Data 4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=2198 |work=SceneNotice |title=Call.of.Duty.Ghosts.XBOXONE-COMPLEX |quote=COMPLEX is proud to present the very first game data sector dump of an XBOX ONE game - even before the official console launch date ;) This release contains a 42gb .iso without security sectors. These can be patched in later on before burning the iso to disc. The disc itself has a new format (XGD4 / XBOX Game Data 4) and contains a few folders (licenses, msxc and metadata) with some .png and catalog files plus one large package1.xvc file of 41,285,020 kb length. |date=2013-11-19}}&lt;!--2013-11-19 21:40:14 GMT--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===PlayStation 4===

On May 31, 2014, the group WaYsTeD brought the first [[PlayStation 4]] game to the scene: ''[[Watch Dogs]]''. Just like with other console firsts, the 25GB .iso file isn't playable yet, hoping it will be hacked one day. It has the same file structure as the PlayStation 3 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Watch.Dogs.PS4-WaYsTeD |date=2014-05-31 |author=WaYsTeD |url=http://rom-news.org/ps4/nfo/Watch.Dogs.PS4-WaYsTeD |quote=We are now ripping PS4 games hopping it will be hacked one day and for everyone to enjoy. This pretty much has the same file structure as the ps3 games. Download these games and archive them we may need them one day.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two months, some other groups started doing raw image dumps too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The_Pinball_Arcade_PS4-QueLLBRUNN |date=2014-07-26 |author=QueLLBRUNN |url=http://rom-news.org/ps4/nfo/The_Pinball_Arcade_PS4-QueLLBRUNN |quote=This is a raw copy made like WaYsteD with some bddrive and [[ImgBurn]]. Don't expect any more.}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 3 years later on September 27, 2017, the group KOTF (Knights of the Fallen) released [[Grand Theft Auto V]] as the first playable decrypted game dump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Grand.Theft.Auto.V.READNFO.PS4-KOTF |url=http://rom-news.org/ps4/nfo/Grand.Theft.Auto.V.READNFO.PS4-KOTF |date=2017-09-27 |website=rom-news |author=KOTF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first releases were games such as [[Assassins Creed IV]] and [[Far Cry 4]] with RAR volumes of 250MB and even 500MB sized parts. The extremely old firmware that was required to play these games was a major drawback.&lt;ref name="kotf"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://torrentfreak.com/ps4-piracy-now-exists-if-gamers-want-to-jump-through-hoops-170930/ |website=[[TorrentFreak]] |title=PS4 Piracy Now Exists – If Gamers Want to Jump Through Hoops |author=Andy |date=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Handheld standards==
A [[handheld game console]] is a lightweight, portable electronic device with a built-in screen, game controls, speakers and replaceable and or rechargeable batteries or battery pack. Handheld game consoles are run on machines of small size allowing people to carry them and play them at any time or place. Unlike video game consoles, the controls, screen and speakers are all part of a single unit.

===Game Boy Advance===
[[Game Boy Advance]] releases are in their native [[ROM image|ROM]] format (.gba). However, like the 0day releases, due to their small size, these are often compressed into [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] files and then compressed into [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] format; otherwise, they are simply compressed into ZIP format.

===Nintendo DS===
The [[Nintendo DS]] scene started out as an extension of the Game Boy Advance scene, and carried forward with mostly the same set of rules. On May 31, 2010 a first ruleset was released with the goal of establishing a clear and concise listing of what should be expected of a valid Nintendo DS release. "Having an official list to reference should prevent needless nuking, and clean up what is at present a cluttered and confused scene." 7 groups signed the rules.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="NDS1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srrdb.com/release/details/The.NintendoDS.Release.Standards.2010-NDS |title=The.NintendoDS.Release.Standards.2010-NDS |date=2010-05-31 |website=srrDB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after, a second "official" ruleset was released but was nuked later on, although it is deemed to be the most relevant according to scenerules.irc.gs. Multiple of the 18 groups listed did not agree to sign the rules.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="NDS2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srrdb.com/release/details/The.Official.NintendoDS.Ruleset.2010.NDS-CONSOLE |title=The.Official.NintendoDS.Ruleset.2010.NDS-CONSOLE |date=2010-06-01 |website=srrDB}}&lt;!--2010-06-01 02:17:50 GMT--&gt;

Nintendo DS releases are in their native [[ROM image|ROM]] format (.neo or .nds){{citation needed|date=January 2016}}. The Scene has been doing .zip from the GBA days,&lt;ref name="concerned" /&gt; but now the releases need to be compressed into 5 [[Megabyte|MB]] split [[RAR (file format)|RAR]] volumes and contain a Nintendo DS title or a patch for a Nintendo DS title. Also an NFO file is a must. A patch is some modification or tool like a trainer, crack, language selector or save fix. The most common formats are .BDF and .IPS. The directory name must include the text "NDS" and the group name. [[Nintendo DSi|DSi]] related releases are regarded as NDS releases and must have the tag DSi.

===Nintendo 3DS===
[[Nintendo 3DS]] releases use the .3ds file format or the .cia file format. The group LEGACY (LGC) released the first three games on June 5, 2011. They included a picture of the dumper they used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tom_Clancys_Ghost_Recon_Shadow_Wars_EUR_3DS-LGC |url=http://www.ludibria.com/nfo.php?sys=3ds&amp;sysid=1 |work=LUDiBRiA |quote=Like our first DS and DSi dumps, we have included a picture of the dumper with this release. |date=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The packaging is done with compressed RAR files and an SFV for verification. As of October 2017, there are more than 2400 3DS releases.&lt;ref name="abgx-3ds"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abgx.net/3ds_releases_date.txt |title=3ds_releases_date.txt |website=ABGX.net |date=2017-12-23 |quote=Total releases: 2523 (including 62 nuked)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://3dsdb.com/ |title=3DS Rom Database |website=3dsdb.com |quote=2,428 entries}}&lt;!--Pong20302000 (admin); 2 days ago; sorry about the 3DS list being out of date people, the person that updated it has vanished :sad:--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===PSP===
Sony [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] releases are by convention specified as FULL [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] or UMD RIP, meaning some parts were removed either out of non-necessity, or to fit it to a certain-sized memory stick.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.ludibria.com/nfo.php?sys=psp&amp;sysid=936 |title=Tiger_Woods_PGA_Tour_USA_PSP_INTERNAL_RIP-pSyPSP |date=2005-06-27 |publisher=LUDiBRiA |quote=This game had dummy files probably to help loading times, which were removed along with some music and commentary. It comes to about 509mb which should be enough to fit on a 512mb memory stick in the future when the games will be playable.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; You can play an [[Disk image|ISO]] with custom firmware or an emulator such as [[devhook]]. [[Paradox (warez)|PARADOX]] released the first retail PSP game on May 4, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ludibria.com/index.php?sys=psp&amp;m=0&amp;y=2005 |title=LUDiBRiA - PSP Releases: search result |accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news090505umdcracked |title=PSP's UMD format cracked |date=2005-05-09 |website=Eurogamer |author=GamesIndustry International}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2006, the scene started releasing old [[PlayStation (console)|PSX]] games that can be played with the official [[emulator]] on the PSP. These games are bought from the [[PlayStation Store]] with a PS3. Depending on the releasegroup, they are tagged ''PSXPSP'', ''PSX_PSP'', ''PSX.To.PSP'', ''PSX.FOR.PSP'' or ''PS1_For_PSP''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; On May 19, 2006, PARADOX returned to the PSP scene to release a +9 [[Trainer (games)|trainer]] just to prove that trainers for Sony's handheld are possible. Since then, no other group or person has publicly released any trainers.&lt;ref&gt;

The first game release for the [[PlayStation Vita]] in the scene, ''[[Uncharted: Golden Abyss]]'', was done by the group PSiCO on February 8, 2016.&lt;ref name="wololo-vita1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wololo.net/2016/02/10/warez-group-psico-release-first-vita-cartridge-dump-uncharted-golden-abyss/ |title=Warez group PSiCO release first Vita cartridge dump: Uncharted Golden Abyss |author=WOLOLO |date=2016-02-10 |quote=there exists no way to actually run this content today}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was almost 4 years after the introduction of the PS Vita in Europe and North America.&lt;!-- on February 22, 2012 in Europe and North America--&gt; It was [[ROM image|dumped]] from a PS Vita [[PlayStation Vita card|NVG game cartridge]] and the [[Playstation File System|PFS]]&lt;!--correct link? https://www.reddit.com/r/vitahacks/comments/42c813/dumping_your_games_or_apps_without_pfs_protection/cz9cqb3 --&gt; encryption layer was removed since this data is not needed to become playable in the future.&lt;ref name="psv1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Uncharted_Golden_Abyss_EUR_MULTI5_READNFO_PSV-PSiCO |date=2016-02-08 |author=PSiCO |url=http://www.xrel.to/console-nfo/1091565/Uncharted-Golden-Abyss-EUR-MULTI5-READNFO-PSV-PSiCO.html |quote=Well here we are, the first PS Vita NVG game cartridge dump!}}&lt;/ref&gt; Releases are tagged with ''PSV'' in the directory name. There were already a handful of other PSV tagged releases before, but these contained [[Optical disc packaging|covers]].

The first releases were made to be used with the Cobra BlackFin [[dongle]] for the PlayStation Vita handheld, using the ''.psv'' (BlackFin) format for its data dump.&lt;ref name="wololo-vita2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wololo.net/2016/06/21/ps-vita-cartridge-dumps-available-warez-sites-cobra-blackfin/ |title=Warez groups start releasing Vita Cartridge dumps for Cobra Blackin |author=WOLOLO |date=2016-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the release of the Vitamin dumper in August 2016 following the HENkaku [[Homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] enabler, there weren't many new releases immediately after because of issues with this new tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Scene_Notice_For_Vitamin_Dumps_READNFO_PSV-PSiCO |url=http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=2341 |date=2016-08-30 |quote=We expected a flood of scene releases, which luckily for all of us didn't happen}}&lt;/ref&gt; A couple of weeks later the first ruleset was signed by 4 groups.&lt;ref name="psvita.standards.2016" group="ruleset"&gt;{{cite web |date=2016-09-10 |url=http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=2344 |title=PSVita.Standards.2016-CONSOLE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best tool to make a copy of the game cartridge data at that moment was MaiDumpTool in combination with Vitamin 2.0 when needed. The file format used for these newer dumps is ''.vpk'': a [[Zip (file format)|ZIP]] containing the decrypted files of the game folder.

===Other===

Other handheld platforms that had games released by the Scene include [[Neo Geo Pocket]], [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]], [[WonderSwan]], [[WonderSwan Color]], [[Tapwave Zodiac]], [[Gizmondo]], [[Game Boy]], [[Game Boy Color]], and [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketheaven.com/ph/wiki/Ngage_Scene |title=Ngage Scene - PHWiki |publisher=Pocketheaven.com |date=2009-08-03 |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketheaven.com/ph/wiki/GBC_Scene |title=GBC Scene - PHWiki |publisher=Pocketheaven.com |date=2009-08-03 |accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== E-books ==

The first traceable scene release of an [[e-book]] can be dated back to around the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchlores.org/h_ebook.htm |title=A brief history of the e-book scene |author=Ronin |date=October 2004 |work=[[Fravia]] |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724015529/http://www.searchlores.org/h_ebook.htm |archivedate=July 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EEn"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=1379 |title=VALEDiCTION.TO.THE.SCENE-EEn |author=EEn |work=SceneNotice.org |date=2004-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, sUppLeX wrote in one of their NFOs that ''ebooks do not really belong to 0day anymore, so we definitely need rules for that. Most countries got their own rules for the local ebook section in their country, but there's nothing similar for the whole world.'' sUppLeX were releasing their ebooks in RAR/SFV format at that time, but reverted two years later.&lt;ref name="sUppLeX-ebook"&gt;{{cite web |title=DC.Countdown.Vol.1.No.15.Jan.2008.READ.NFO.COMiC.eBOOk-sUppLeX |date=2008-03-25 |author=sUppLeX |quote=YES, WE PRE IN RAR/SFV WHiCH MiGHT BE A BiT TOO MUCH FOR MOST OF YOU ZiP/DiZ LOVERS, BUT GiVE iT A TRY. |url=http://www.srrdb.com/release/details/DC.Countdown.Vol.1.No.15.Jan.2008.READ.NFO.COMiC.eBOOk-sUppLeX}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=2318 |title=sUppLeX.reverting.back.to.0day.standards.READ.NFO-sUppLeX |date=2010-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Standards existed for the German and Polish ebook scenes.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="ger-ebook-draft0.7"&gt;{{cite web |title=German.Ebook.Rules.Beta.0.70.Denkanstoss-pxd |date=2003-12-04 |url=https://scenerules.org/t.html?id=2004_DE_EBOOK.nfo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="ger-ebook"&gt;{{cite web |title=eBook.Rules.v.2.0.Final.20.06.2004-GER |date=2004-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="PLeBookScene"&gt;{{cite web |title=Polish.eBooks.Releasing.Standards.v.1.0-PLeBookScene |date=2006-09-22 |url=https://scenerules.org/t.html?id=2006_PL_EBOOK.nfo |author1=BiL |author2=iMN |author3=KiOSK |author4=PiSToNS}}&lt;/ref&gt;	
In 2009, a new ruleset for German e-books was created,&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="ebook2009"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scenerules.irc.gs/t.html?id=2009_DE_EBOOK.nfo |title=German.eBOOk.Releasing.Standards.2009-GERMANBOOKS |date=2009-04-15 |work=SceneRules |quote=Ebooks developed into a whole new independent section which grew out of 0DAY.}}&lt;!-- 2009-04-15 19:31:45 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; which closely matches general rules for English releases and which since has been adopted in most e-book releases. There was the option to choose between ZIP/DIZ or RAR/SFV to package a release.

In 2012, international ebook rules were created. It was a ''unified agreement'' applicable to all groups ''to ensure high quality ebook releases''.&lt;ref group="ruleset" name="ebook2012"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=2096 |title=International.Ebook.Rules.2012.eBOOK-EBOOKCOUNCiL |date=2012-04-19 |work=SceneNotice}}&lt;!-- 2012-04-19 22:17:31 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital rights management|DRM]]-protection has to be removed prior to release and only the 0day ZIP/DIZ packaging can be used. Some examples showing naming conventions:

 Journal.Name.[[Volume (bibliography)|Vol]].xx.[[Issue (magazine)|No]].xx.Month.Year.LANGUAGE.SOURCE.COMiC.eBOOk-GROUPTAG (also for comics)

"These, along with rules of naming and organizing files, are rules that dictate 
how a file must be packaged—all groups are expected to know and to follow 
these standards. The packaging stage in the script ensures that the content is 
adequately packed to scene standards: files must be properly named, files must be

Data preparation proceeded in two stages. First, because different release sites may
receive software releases at slightly different times depending on geographical location
and timing of releases, there is no formal record documenting correct times for all
releases. In this respect, release times in any single source may vary (possibly by as
much as two weeks). In the interests of triangulation, the researcher compared the data
set against release lists of two other pirate software release sites to which the research
had access. This stage proved useful in confirming and verifying release dates, release
names and piracy groups, but also highlighted the fact that very little such information
from prior to 2005 is easily available.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it covered a wide range of genre and subject matter, ''Wimmen's Comix'' focused more than other anthologies of the time on [[feminism|feminist]] concerns, [[LGBT themes in comics|homosexuality]], [[sex]] and [[politics]] in general, and [[autobiographical comics]].&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt; ''Wimmen's Comix'' #1 featured the first-ever comic strip featuring an "out" lesbian, [[Trina Robbins]]' "Sandy Comes Out."&lt;ref name="Kaplan, Arie 2006"&gt;Kaplan, Arie.

(Chicago Review Press, 2006) {{ISBN|1-55652-633-4}}, p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wimmen's Comix'' was a launching pad for many cartoonists' careers, and it inspired other small-press and self-published titles like ''Dyke Shorts'' and ''Dynamite Damsels''.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

== History ==
''Wimmen's Comix'' debuted a few years after the publication of the 1970 one-shot (also published by Last Gasp) [[It Ain't Me, Babe (comics)|''It Ain't Me, Babe'']], the first American comic book entirely produced by women, which was put together by [[Trina Robbins]],&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;Johnson, Kjerstin. [http://bitchmagazine.org/post/adventures-in-feministory-women-comics-of-the-70s-and-80s "Adventures in Feministory: Women's Comics of the '70s and '80s,"] ''[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]'' magazine (April 6, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; the most prolific and influential of the women cartoonists in the underground scene. (''It Ain't Me Babe'' was a feminist newspaper in [[Berkeley, California]].)&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;Robbins, Trina. [http://www.comixgrrrlz.pl/2010/05/25/wimmen%E2%80%99s-studies/ "Wimmen's Studies,"] Comix Grrrlz (May 25, 2010). Accessed Sept. 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the creators from the ''It Ain't Me Babe'' comic went on to contribute to ''Wimmen's Comix''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jacobs|first=Rita D|date=March 2016|title=The Complete Wimmen's Comix|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=113266367&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=World Literature Today|volume=90|issue=2|doi=|pmid=|access-date=9 March 2016|subscription=yes|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the group behind ''Wimmen's Comix'' was not an official collective, but rather a few women artists who came together with a common interest to create at least one comic that women could get paid to be in, in a male-dominated comix culture.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; The first issue was edited by musician and artist Patricia Moodian.&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt; Later issues (17 total in 20 years) were edited by a different editor, or different editors who shared the job.&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

''Wimmen's Comix'' #1 featured [[Trina Robbins]]' "Sandy Comes Out", the first-ever comic strip featuring an "out" [[lesbian]].&lt;ref name="Kaplan, Arie 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Robin (July 31, 1994). "Where Women Rule: The World of Lesbian Cartoons". ''The Harvard Gay &amp; Lesbian Review'' 1 (3): 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, regular contributors [[Aline Kominsky-Crumb]] and [[Diane Noomin]] left to start their own title, ''[[Twisted Sisters (comic)|Twisted Sisters]]''. (Kominsky-Crumb has later claimed that a large part of her break with the ''Wimmen's Comix'' group was over [[feminist]] issues.)&lt;ref name=needmorelove&gt;Kominsky-Crumb, Aline. (2007). ''Need More Love''. New York: MQ Publications. {{ISBN|1-84601-133-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many ''Wimmen's Comix''' contributors, including [[Aline Kominsky-Crumb]], Penny Van Horn, [[Carol Tyler]], [[M.K. Brown]], [[Diane Noomin]], [[Phoebe Gloeckner]], [[Carol Lay]], Caryn Leschen, Leslie Sternbergh, [[Dori Seda]], [[Mary Fleener]], and [[Krystine Kryttre]], subsequently appeared in ''Twisted Sisters: A Collection of Bad Girl Art'' (Viking Penguin) and  ''Twisted Sisters: Drawing the Line'' ([[Kitchen Sink Press]]), both edited by Noomin.

[[Last Gasp]] published issues #1-10, when the title moved to [[Renegade Press]] for issues #11–13. [[Rip Off Press]] published the final three issues, #14–16.

In 1992, for issue #17, the title of the comic was changed to ''Wimmin's Comix'' following a discussion over the gender politics of words containing "man" or "men" (see [[womyn]]).&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt; This, and other political conflicts, along with financial difficulties and the increasing availability of other venues for independent female cartoonists, led to the end of the series after that issue.&lt;ref name="Robbins" /&gt;

Every issue of ''Wimmen's Comix'' is reprinted in ''The Complete Wimmen's Comix'', a two-volume collection released in February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fantagraphics.com/completewimmenscomix/ ''The Complete Wimmen's Comix'' page] at the Fantagraphics website.

'''Yelp''' is a local-search service powered by crowd-sourced [[review site|review]] forum run by an [[United States of America|American]] [[multinational corporation]] headquartered in [[San Francisco, California]]. It develops, hosts and markets Yelp.com and the Yelp [[mobile app]], which publish [[crowd-sourced]] reviews about local businesses, as well as the online reservation service Yelp Reservations. The company also trains small businesses in how to respond to reviews, hosts social events for reviewers, and provides data about businesses, including [[health inspection]] scores.  

Yelp was founded in 2004 by former [[PayPal]] employees [[Russel Simmons]] and [[Jeremy Stoppelman]]. Yelp grew quickly and raised several rounds of funding. By 2010 it had $30 million in revenues and the website had published more than 4.5 million crowd-sourced reviews. From 2009 to 2012, Yelp expanded throughout [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. In 2009 it entered several negotiations with [[Google]] for a potential acquisition. Yelp became a public company in March 2012 and became profitable for the first time two years later.&lt;ref name="Yelp-Mar-2012-424B4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/1861/119312512093131/filing-main.htm |title=Yelp, Form 424B4, Filing Date Mar 2, 2012 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yelp-Jul-2014-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/2445/114420414045812/filing-main.htm |title=Yelp, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Jul 30, 2014 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fourth quarter of 2017, Yelp has 77 million unique visitors via desktop computer and 64 million unique visitors via mobile website on a monthly average basis.&lt;ref name="Yelp-Feb-2018-8-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edgar.secdatabase.com/897/115752318000240/filing-main.htm |title=Yelp, Form 8-K, Current Report, Filing Date Feb 7, 2018 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2017, Yelp has 148 million reviews.&lt;ref name="Yelp-Feb-2018-10-K"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.secdatabase.com/1554/0001628280-18-002519.pdf |title=Yelp, Form 10-K, Annual Report, Filing Date Feb 28, 2018 |publisher=secdatabase.com |accessdate =May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's revenues come from businesses' advertising.

According to ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune Magazine]]'', Yelp's initial email-based system was "convoluted".&lt;ref name="oneone"/&gt; The idea was rejected by investors and did not attract users beyond the cofounders' friends and family.&lt;ref name="Chafkin"/&gt; Usage data showed that users were not answering requests for referrals, but were using the "Real Reviews" feature, which allowed them to write reviews unsolicited.&lt;ref name="oneone"/&gt; According to the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', "the site's popularity soared" after it was re-designed in late 2005.&lt;ref name="SFGate1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/06/18/LVGO9JDMDV1.DTL&amp;type=printable|work=San Francisco Chronicle|title=Casting the Net:Yelp is on the way|author=Heather Maddan|date=June 18, 2006|accessdate=November 27, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226134234/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2006%2F06%2F18%2FLVGO9JDMDV1.DTL&amp;type=printable|archivedate=February 26, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yelp raised $5 million in funding in 2005 from [[Bessemer Venture Partners|Bessemer Ventures]] and $10 million in November 2006 from [[Benchmark (venture capital firm)|Benchmark Capital]].&lt;ref name="oneone"/&gt; The number of reviewers on the site grew from 12,000 in 2005, to 100,000 in 2006.&lt;ref name="Chafkin"&gt;{{cite news|first=Max|last=Chafkin|newspaper=Inc.

In some cases, Yelp users that had a bad experience have updated their reviews more favorably due to the businesses' efforts to make it right. In other cases disputes between reviewers and business owners have led to harassment and physical altercations.&lt;ref name="Chafkin"/&gt; The system has led to criticisms that business owners can bribe reviewers with free food or discounts to increase their rating, though Yelp users say this rarely occurs.&lt;ref name="twotwotwo"/&gt; A business owner can "claim" a profile, which allows them to respond to reviews and see traffic reports.&lt;ref name="Chafkin"/&gt; Businesses can also offer discounts to Yelp users that visit often using the "check in" feature.&lt;ref name="lsoppio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lsoppio2"/&gt; In 2014, Yelp released an app for business owners to respond to reviews and manage their profiles from a mobile device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yelp Gives Business Owners Stronger Voice|first=Barbara|last=Hernandez|url=http://www.nbcbayarea.com/blogs/press-here/Yelp-Gives-Business-Owners-a-Voice-286279911.html|publisher=NBC Bay Area|accessdate=December 19, 2014|date=December 18, 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093822/http://www.nbcbayarea.com/blogs/press-here/Yelp-Gives-Business-Owners-a-Voice-286279911.html|archivedate=April 2, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business owners can also flag a review to be removed, if the review violates Yelp's content guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How do I flag a review|url=http://www.yelp-support.com/article/How-do-I-flag-a-review?l=en_US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150303053453/http://www.yelp-support.com/article/How-do-I-flag-a-review?l=en_US|archivedate=March 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==


According to ''BusinessWeek'', Yelp has a complicated relationship with small businesses.&lt;ref name="bwbwbw"&gt;{{cite news |first=Patrick |last=Clark |date=September 9, 2013 |title=Yelp's Newest Weapon Against Fake Reviews: Lawsuits |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-09/yelps-newest-weapon-against-fake-reviews-lawsuits |work=[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]] |accessdate=July 1, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702005747/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-09-09/yelps-newest-weapon-against-fake-reviews-lawsuits |archivedate=July 2, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of Yelp continues to focus on the legitimacy of reviews, public statements of Yelp manipulating and blocking reviews in order to increase ad spending, as well as concerns regarding the privacy of reviewers.

===Astroturfing===

As Yelp became more influential, the practice of fake reviews written by competitors or business owners became more prevalent.&lt;ref name="LA Times April 2013"/&gt; A study from Harvard professor Michael Luca analyzed 316,415 reviews in Boston and found that fake reviews rose from 6% of the site's reviews in 2006 to 20% in 2014.&lt;ref name="fake"/&gt; Yelp's own review filter identifies 25% of reviews as suspicious.&lt;ref name="CNN Money September 2013"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/09/26/yelps-fake-review-problem/ | title=Yelp's fake review problem | publisher=''CNN Money'' | date=September 26, 2013 | accessdate=September 27, 2013 | author=Roberts, Daniel | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926231147/http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/09/26/yelps-fake-review-problem/ | archivedate=September 26, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yelp has a proprietary algorithm that attempts to evaluate whether a review is authentic and filters out reviews that it believes are not based on a patron's actual personal experiences, as required by the site's Terms of Use.&lt;ref name="Chafkin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sia Furler Seeks Revenge on Twitter and Yelp after Dry Cleaning Staff Ruins Fave Clothes|url=http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/556323/20140619/sia-furler-revenge-twitter-yelp-dry-cleaner.htm#.U7LLHKggUZw|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714232734/http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/556323/20140619/sia-furler-revenge-twitter-yelp-dry-cleaner.htm#.U7LLHKggUZw|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 14, 2014|publisher=International Business Times|date=June 19, 2014|author=Ma Evelyn Castino Quilas|accessdate=July 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review filter was first developed two weeks after the site was founded and the company saw their "first obviously fake reviews."&lt;ref name="CNN Money September 2013"/&gt; Filtered reviews are moved into a special area and not counted towards the businesses' star-rating.&lt;ref name="CNN Money September 2013"/&gt; The filter sometimes filters legitimate reviews, leading to complaints from business owners.&lt;ref name="LA Times April 2013"/&gt; New York Attorney General [[Eric T.

According to ''[[Inc. (magazine)|Inc.

In some cases, they write reviews in order to lash out at corporate interests or businesses they dislike.&lt;ref name="Chafkin"/&gt; Reviewers may also be motivated by badges and honors, such as being the first to review a new location,&lt;ref name="SFGate1"/&gt; or by praise and attention from other users.&lt;ref name="nytloi"/&gt; Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner.&lt;ref name="SFGate1"/&gt; Some users post reviews as a matter of protest or support of the business's political views; Yelp attempts to filter these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Yelp Emerged as a Site for Social Protest|first=Amy|last=McKeever|date=May 19, 2015|url=http://www.eater.com/2015/5/19/8588185/yelp-social-protest-trolling-memories-pizza|publisher=Eater|accessdate=May 22, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521234144/http://www.eater.com/2015/5/19/8588185/yelp-social-protest-trolling-memories-pizza|archivedate=May 21, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can give a review a "thumbs-up" if it is "useful, funny or cool."&lt;ref name="LA Times April 2013"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-banks-yelp-20130420,0,7824145,full.column | title=Turning a critical eye on Yelp | newspaper=Los Angeles Times | date=April 20, 2013 | accessdate=June 1, 2014 | author=Banks, Sandy | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423055240/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-banks-yelp-20130420,0,7824145,full.column | archivedate=April 23, 2014 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each day a "Review of the Day" is determined based on a vote by users.&lt;ref name="twotwotwo"/&gt; According to ''The Discourse of Online Consumer Reviews'' many Yelp reviewers are internet-savvy adults aged 18–25 or "suburban baby boomers".&lt;ref name="discourse"/&gt;
