[[File:Azazel IMG 1758.JPG|right|250px|thumb|Cliffs of Mount Azazel (Jabel Munttar).]]
'''Azazel''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|z|eɪ|z|əl|,_|ˈ|æ|z|ə|ˌ|z|ɛ|l}}; {{lang-he-n|עֲזָאזֵל|ʿAzazel}}; {{lang-ar|عزازيل|ʿAzāzīl}}) appears in the [[Bible]] in association with the [[scapegoat]] rite. In some traditions of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]], it is the name for a [[fallen angel]].

==Hebrew Bible==
[[File:Detail of East Window, Lincoln Cathedral (14224253959).jpg|right|280px|thumb|"And Aaron shall cast lots"]]
In the Bible, the term is used thrice in [[Leviticus 16]], where two male [[goat]]s were to be sacrificed to [[Yahweh]]  and one of the two was [[cleromancy|selected by lot]], for Yahweh is seen as speaking through the lots.&lt;ref name=Jewish/&gt; One goat is selected by lot and sent into the wilderness {{hebrew|לַעֲזָאזֵל}}, "for Azazel". This goat was then cast out in the desert as part of [[Yom Kippur]].

In older English versions, such as the [[King James Version]], the phrase ''la-azazel'' is translated as "as a scapegoat", however, in most [[modern English Bible translations]], it is represented as a name in the text:
{{quotation|6 Aaron shall offer the bull as a sin offering for himself and shall make atonement for himself and for his house. 7 Then he shall take the two goats and set them before the Lord at the entrance of the tent of meeting. 8 And Aaron shall cast lots over the two goats, one lot for the Lord and the other lot for Azazel. 9 And Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the Lord and use it as a sin offering, 10 but the goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before the Lord to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away into the wilderness to Azazel.|Leviticus 16:6-10, [[English Standard Version]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esvbible.org/Leviticus+16/ ESV Leviticus 16]&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

Later rabbis, interpreting ''azazel'' as ''azaz'' (rugged) and ''el'' (of [[El (deity)|God]]), take it as referring to the rugged and rough mountain cliff from which the goat was cast down.&lt;ref name=JE-Azazel&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Azazel|title=Jewish Encyclopedia|date=1906|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2203-azazel|work=Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yoma 67b; Sifra, Aḥare, ii. 2; Targ. Yer. Lev. xiv. 10, and most medieval commentators&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="akaplan"&gt;For a delineation of the various [[Rabbinic literature#Meforshim|Rabbinic opinions]] here, see R. [[Aryeh Kaplan]]'s [http://www.bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=16#C2414 note] on "Azazel" (Lev 16:8).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judaism ==
=== Second Temple Judaism ===
Despite the expectation of Brandt (1889){{explain|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;Brandt "Die mandäische Religion" 1889 pp. 197, 198; Norberg's "Onomasticon," p. 31; [[Adriaan Reland]]'s "De Religione Mohammedanarum," p. 89; Kamus, s.v. "Azazel" [demon identical with Satan]; Delitzsch, "Zeitsch. f. Kirchl. Wissensch. u. Leben," 1880, p. 182)&lt;/ref&gt; to date no evidence has surfaced of Azazel as a demon or god prior to the earliest Jewish sources among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].&lt;ref&gt;Ralph D. Levy ''The symbolism of the Azazel goat'' 1998 "the midrash is less elaborate than in 1 Enoch, and, notably, makes no mention of Azazel or Asa' el at all."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dead Sea Scrolls ====
In the Dead Sea Scrolls, the name Azazel occurs in the line 6 of 4Q203, ''[[The Book of Giants]]'', which is a part of the [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enochic]] literature found at [[Qumran]].&lt;ref&gt;Loren T. Stückenbruck ''The Book of Giants from Qumran: texts, translation, and commentary''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Book of Enoch]], which brings Azazel into connection with the Biblical story of the [[War in Heaven|fall of the angels]], located on [[Mount Hermon]], a gathering-place of [[demon]]s of old,&lt;ref&gt;Enoch xiii.; compare Brandt, "Die mandäische Religion," 1889, p.&amp;nbsp;38&lt;/ref&gt; Azazel is one of the leaders of the rebellious [[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]] in the time preceding [[Genesis flood narrative|the Flood]]; he taught men the art of warfare, of making swords, knives, shields, and coats of mail, and taught women the art of deception by ornamenting the body, dyeing the hair, and painting the face and the eyebrows, and also revealed to the people the secrets of witchcraft and corrupted their manners, leading them into wickedness and impurity until at last he was, at Yahweh's command, bound hand and foot by the [[Raphael (archangel)|archangel Raphael]] and chained to the rough and jagged rocks of [Ha] [[Dudael]] (= Beth Ḥadudo), where he is to abide in utter darkness until the great [[Day of Judgment]], when he will be cast into the fire to be consumed forever.&lt;ref&gt;Enoch viii. 1, ix. 6, x. 4–6, liv. 5, lxxxviii. 1; see Geiger, "Jüd. Zeit." 1864, pp.&amp;nbsp;196–204&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In Greek Septuagint and later translations ====
The translators of the Greek [[Septuagint]] understood the Hebrew term as meaning ''the sent away'', and read: "&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;and Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats, one lot for the Lord and the other lot for '''the scapegoat''' (Greek ''apopompaio'' dat.).
:&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;And Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for the Lord, and offer it as a sin offering; &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;but the goat on which the lot of the '''sent away one''' fell shall be presented alive before the Lord to make atonement over it, that it may be sent away (Greek ''eis ten apopompen'' acc.) into the wilderness."

Following the Septuagint, the Latin [[Vulgate]],&lt;ref&gt;16:8 mittens super utrumque sortem unam Domino et alteram capro emissario&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther]]&lt;ref&gt;3 Mose 16:8 German: Luther (1545) Und soll das Los werfen über die zween Böcke, ein Los dem HERRN und das andere dem ledigen Bock.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[King James Version]] also give readings such as [[Young's Literal Translation]]: "And Aaron hath given lots over the two goats, one lot for Jehovah, and one lot for a '''goat of departure'''".

According to the ''[[Peshitta]]'', Azazel is rendered ''Za-za-e'il'' (the strong one against/of God), as in Qumran fragment 4Q180.&lt;ref&gt;D.J. Stökl in ''Sacrifice in religious experience '' ed. Albert I. Baumgarten p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==== In 1 Enoch and 3 Enoch ====
{{quotation|The whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by Azazel: to him ascribe all sin.|[[Book of Enoch]] 10:8|}}
According to the Book of Enoch (a book of the [[Apocrypha]]), Azazel (here spelled ''‘ăzā’zyēl'') was one of the chief [[Watcher (angel)|Grigori]], a group of [[fallen angel]]s who married women. This same story (without any mention of Azazel) is told in the [[book of Genesis]] 6:2–4: "That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose. […] There were giants in the earth in those days; and also afterward, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown."

Enoch portrays Azazel as responsible for teaching people to make [[weapon#History|weapons]] and [[cosmetics]], for which he was cast out of heaven. The Book of Enoch 8:1–3a reads, "And Azazel taught men to make swords and knives and shields and breastplates; and made known to them the metals [of the earth] and the art of working them; and bracelets and ornaments; and the use of antimony and the beautifying of the eyelids; and all kinds of costly stones and all colouring tinctures. And there arose much godlessness, and they committed [[fornication]], and they were led astray and became corrupt in all their ways."

The corruption brought on by Azazel and the Grigori degrades the human race, and the four [[archangel]]s ([[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], [[Gabriel]], [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], and [[Uriel]]) “saw much blood being shed upon the earth and all lawlessness being wrought upon the earth […]  The souls of men [made] their suit, saying, "Bring our cause before the Most High; […] Thou seest what Azazel hath done, who hath taught all unrighteousness on earth and revealed the eternal secrets which were in heaven, which men were striving to learn."

God sees the sin brought about by Azazel and has Raphael “bind Azazel hand and foot and cast him into the darkness: and make an opening in the desert – which is in Dudael – and cast him therein. And place upon him rough and jagged rocks, and cover him with darkness, and let him abide there forever, and cover his face that he may not see light.”

Several scholars have previously discerned that some details of Azazel's punishment are reminiscent of the scapegoat rite. Thus, Lester Grabbe points to a number of parallels between the Azazel narrative in Enoch and the wording of Leviticus 16, including "the similarity of the names Asael and Azazel; the punishment in the desert; the placing of sin on Asael/Azazel; the resultant healing of the land."&lt;ref name=Orlov&gt;[http://www.marquette.edu/maqom/azazelscapegoat.html Andrei Orlov, Azazel as the Celestial Scapegoat]&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Stökl also observes that "the punishment of the demon resembles the treatment of the goat in aspects of geography, action, time and purpose."&lt;ref name=Orlov/&gt; Thus, the place of Asael’s punishment designated in Enoch as Dudael is reminiscent of the rabbinic terminology used for the designation of the ravine of the scapegoat in later rabbinic interpretations of the Yom Kippur ritual. Stökl remarks that "the name of place of judgment (''Dudael'') is conspicuously similar in both traditions and can likely be traced to a common origin."&lt;ref name=Orlov/&gt;

Azazel's fate is foretold near the end of Enoch 2:8, where God says, “On the day of [[Apocalypse|the great judgement]] he shall be cast into the fire. […] The whole earth has been corrupted through the works that were taught by Azazel: to him ascribe all sin."

In the fifth-century [[3 Enoch]], Azazel is one of the three angels (Azza [Shemhazai] and Uzza [Ouza] are the other two) who opposed Enoch's high rank when he became the angel [[Metatron]]. Whilst they were fallen at this time they were still in Heaven, but Metatron held a dislike for them, and had them cast out.

==== In the Apocalypse of Abraham ====
In the [[Biblical canon|extra-canonical]] text the [[Apocalypse of Abraham]] (c.1stC CE), Azazel is portrayed as an unclean bird who came down upon the sacrifice which [[Abraham]] prepared. (This is in reference to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 15:11: "Birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away" [&lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;[[NIV]]&lt;/span&gt;]).

{{quotation|And the unclean bird spoke to me and said, "What are you doing, Abraham, on the holy heights, where no one eats or drinks, nor is there upon them food for men? But these all will be consumed by fire and ascend to the height, they will destroy you."&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
And it came to pass when I saw the bird speaking I said this to the angel: "What is this, my lord?" And he said, "This is disgrace – this is Azazel!" And he said to him, "Shame on you, Azazel! For Abraham's portion is in heaven, and yours is on earth, for you have selected here, [and] become enamored of the dwelling place of your blemish. Therefore the Eternal Ruler, the Mighty One, has given you a dwelling on earth. Through you the all-[[evil]] spirit [was] a liar, and through you [come] wrath and trials on the generations of men who live impiously.
|Abr. 13:4–9}}

The text also associates Azazel with [[Serpent (symbolism)#Judaic and Christian symbolism|the serpent]] and [[hell]]. In Chapter 23, verse 7, it is described as having seven heads, 14 faces, "hands and feet like a man's [and] on his back six wings on the right and six on the left."

Abraham says that the wicked will "putrefy in the belly of the crafty worm Azazel, and be burned by the fire of Azazel's tongue" (Abr. 31:5), and earlier says to Azazel himself, "May you be the firebrand of the furnace of the earth! Go, Azazel, into the untrodden parts of the earth. For your heritage is over those who are with you" (Abr. 14:5–6).

Here there is the idea that God's heritage (the created world) is largely under the dominion of evil – i.e., it is "shared with Azazel" (Abr. 20:5), again identifying him with [[Satan]], who was called "the prince of this world" by Jesus. ({{bibleref|John|12:31|NIV}} &lt;span style="font-variant:small-caps"&gt;niv&lt;/span&gt;)

===Rabbinical Judaism===
The [[Mishnah]] ([[Yoma]] 39a&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.39a?lang=bi Yoma 39]&lt;/ref&gt;) follows the Hebrew Bible text; two goats were procured, similar in respect of appearance, height, cost, and time of selection. Having one of these on his right and the other on his left, the high priest, who was assisted in this rite by two subordinates, put both his hands into a wooden case, and took out two labels, one inscribed "for [[Yahweh]]" and the other "for Azazel". The high priest then laid his hands with the labels upon the two goats and said, "A sin-offering to Yahweh" (thus speaking the [[Tetragrammaton]]); and the two men accompanying him replied, "Blessed be the name of His glorious kingdom for ever and ever." He then fastened a scarlet woolen thread to the head of the goat "for Azazel"; and laying his hands upon it again, recited the following confession of sin and prayer for forgiveness: "O Lord, I have acted iniquitously, trespassed, sinned before Thee: I, my household, and the sons of Aaron Thy holy ones. O Lord, forgive the iniquities, transgressions, and sins that I, my household, and Aaron's children, Thy holy people, committed before Thee, as is written in the law of Moses, Thy servant, 'for on this day He will forgive you, to cleanse you from all your sins before the Lord; ye shall be clean.'"

This prayer was responded to by the congregation present. A man was selected, preferably a priest, to take the goat to the precipice in the wilderness; and he was accompanied part of the way by the most eminent men of Jerusalem. Ten booths had been constructed at intervals along the road leading from Jerusalem to the steep mountain. At each one of these the man leading the goat was formally offered food and drink, which he, however, refused. When he reached the tenth booth those who accompanied him proceeded no further, but watched the ceremony from a distance. When he came to the precipice he divided the scarlet thread into two parts, one of which he tied to the rock and the other to the goat's horns, and then pushed the goat down (Yoma vi. 1–8). The cliff was so high and rugged that before the goat had traversed half the distance to the plain below, its limbs were utterly shattered. Men were stationed at intervals along the way, and as soon as the goat was thrown down the precipice, they signaled to one another by means of kerchiefs or flags, until the information reached the high priest, whereat he proceeded with the other parts of the ritual.

The scarlet thread is symbolically referenced in {{bibleverse||Isaiah|1.18|HE}}; and the Talmud states (ib. 39a) that during the forty years that [[Simeon the Just]] was [[High Priest of Israel]], the thread actually turned white as soon as the goat was thrown over the precipice: a sign that the sins of the people were forgiven. In later times the change to white was not invariable: a proof of the people's moral and spiritual deterioration, that was gradually on the increase, until forty years before the destruction of the [[Second Temple]], when the change of color was no longer observed (l.c. 39b).&lt;ref name=Jewish&gt;{{Cite Jewish Encyclopedia |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2203-azazel |title=Azazel (Scapegoat, Lev. xvi., A. V.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Medieval Jewish commentators ====
The medieval scholar [[Nahmanides]] (1194–1270) identified the Hebrew text as also referring to a demon, and identified this "Azazel" with [[Samael]].&lt;ref&gt;Israel Drazin, Stanley M. Wagner, {{Google books|id=4s5cLrx_n8gC|page=PA122|title=Onkelos on the Torah: Understanding the Bible Text Vol.3}}. Gefen, 2008. p. 122. {{ISBN|978-965-229-425-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not see the sending of the goat as honouring Azazel as a deity, but as a symbolic expression of the idea that the people's sins and their evil consequences were to be sent back to the spirit of desolation and ruin, the source of all impurity. The very fact that the two goats were presented before God, before the one was sacrificed and the other sent into the wilderness, was proof that Azazel was not ranked alongside God, but regarded simply as the personification of wickedness in contrast with the righteous government of God.&lt;ref name=Jewish/&gt;

[[Maimonides]] (1134–1204) says that as sins cannot be taken off one’s head and transferred elsewhere, the ritual is symbolic, enabling the penitent to discard his sins: “These ceremonies are of a symbolic character and serve to impress man with a certain idea and to lead him to repent, as if to say, ‘We have freed ourselves of our previous deeds, cast them behind our backs and removed them from us as far as possible’.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp182.htm#page_366 Guide to the Perplexed 3:46], featured on the [[Internet Sacred Text Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rite, resembling, on one hand, the sending off of the basket with the woman embodying wickedness to the land of [[Shinar]] in the vision of [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Zechariah|5:6-11|HE}}), and, on the other, the letting loose of the living bird into the open field in the case of the leper healed from the plague ({{bibleverse||Lev|14:7|HE}}), was, indeed, viewed by the people of Jerusalem as a means of ridding themselves of the sins of the year. So would the crowd, called Babylonians or Alexandrians, pull the goat's hair to make it hasten forth, carrying the burden of sins away with it (Yoma vi. 4, 66b; "Epistle of Barnabas," vii.), and the arrival of the shattered animal at the bottom of the valley of the rock of Bet Ḥadudo, twelve miles away from the city, was signalized by the waving of shawls to the people of Jerusalem, who celebrated the event with boisterous hilarity and amid dancing on the hills (Yoma vi. 6, 8; Ta'an. iv. 8). Evidently the figure of Azazel was an object of general fear and awe rather than, as has been conjectured, a foreign product or the invention of a late lawgiver. More as a demon of the desert, it seems to have been closely interwoven with the mountainous region of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Jewish/&gt;

==In Christianity==
===Latin Bible===
{{main article|scapegoat}}
The [[Vulgate]] contains no mention of "Azazel" but only of [[:wikt:caper#Latin|caper]] [[:wikt:emissarius#Latin|emissarius]], or "emissary goat":
{{quotation|8 mittens super utrumque sortem unam Domino et alteram '''capro emissario''' 9 cuius sors exierit Domino offeret illum pro peccato 10 cuius autem in '''caprum emissarium''' statuet eum vivum coram Domino ut fundat preces super eo et emittat illum in solitudinem |Latin Vulgate|Leviticus 16:8–10}}

English versions, such as the [[King James version]], followed the [[Septuagint]] and Vulgate in understanding the term as relating to a goat. The modern [[English Standard Version]] provides the footnote "16:8 The meaning of Azazel is uncertain; possibly the name of a place or a demon, traditionally a scapegoat; also verses 10, 26". Most scholars accept the indication of some kind of demon or deity,&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David P. "Azazel." Pages 1:536–37 in [[Anchor Bible Series]]. Edited by David Noel Freedman et al. New York: Doubleday, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; however Judit M. Blair notes that this is an argument without supporting contemporary text evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Judit M. Blair ''De-demonising the Old Testament: An Investigation of Azazel, Lilith, Deber'' p. 23–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Ida Zatelli (1998)&lt;ref&gt;Ida Zatelli, "The Origin of the Biblical Scapegoat Ritual: The Evidence of Two Eblaite Texts", ''[[Vetus Testamentum]]'' 48.2 (April 1998):254–263)&lt;/ref&gt;  has suggested that the Hebrew ritual parallels pagan practice of sending a scapegoat into the desert on the occasion of a royal wedding found in two ritual texts in archives at [[Ebla]] (24th C. BC). A she-goat with a silver bracelet hung from her neck was driven forth into the wasteland of 'Alini' by the community.&lt;ref&gt;David Pearson Wright, {{google books|id=uc7YAAAAMAAJ|title=The Disposal of Impurity: Elimination Rites in the Bible and in Hittite and Mesopotamian literature}}. Scholars Press, University of Michigan, 1987. {{ISBN|978-1-55540-056-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no mention of an "Azazel".&lt;ref&gt;Blair p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'', Azazel is the Hebrew word for scapegoat.  This is the only place that the Hebrew word is found in the whole Hebrew Old Testament.  It says that the Book of Enoch, (extra-biblical Jewish theological literature, dated around 200 B.C.) is full of demonology and reference to fallen angels.  The EBC (Vol 2) says that this text uses late Aramaic forms for these names which indicates that The Book of Enoch most likely relies upon the Hebrew Leviticus text rather than the Leviticus text being reliant upon the Book of Enoch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gabelein|first=Frank E.|title=The Expositor's Bible Commentary|year=1990|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids|isbn=978-0310364405 |pages=590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian commentators===
[[Cyril of Alexandria]] sees the ''apompaios'' (sent-away one, scapegoat) as a foretype of Christ.

[[Origen]] ("Contra Celsum," vi. 43) identifies Azazel with Satan.&lt;ref&gt;John Granger Cook ''The interpretation of the Old Testament in Greco-Roman paganism'' 299&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seventh-day Adventists===
[[File:Azazel_(DI).png|upright|thumb|A depiction of Azazel in his familiar form of a [[goat]]-like demon, from [[Jacques Collin de Plancy]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'' (Paris, 1825).]]
The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] teaches that the [[scapegoat]], or ''Azazel'', is a symbol for [[Satan]].  This was commonly taught among Christians of other centuries as well.&lt;ref&gt;"In later times the word Azazel was by many Jews and also by Christian theologians, such as Origen, regarded as that Satan himself who had fallen away from God. In this interpretation the contrast found in Lev_16:8, in case it is to be regarded as a full parallelism, would be perfectly correct," International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Azazel article, Eerdmen Publishing, 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;  The scapegoat scenario has been interpreted to be a prefigure of the final judgment by which sin is removed forever from the universe.  Through the sacrifice of Jesus, the sins of the believers are forgiven them, but the fact that sins were committed still exist on record in the "Books" of heaven (see {{bibleverse|Revelation|20:12}}).  After the final judgment, the responsibility for all those forgiven sins are accredited to the originator of sin, Satan, after which Satan is destroyed in the Lake of Fire.  Sin will no longer exist anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;White, E. G., 1911, ''The Great Controversy'', p. 422&lt;/ref&gt;

They believe that Satan will finally have to bear the responsibility for the sins of the believers of all ages, and that this was foreshadowed on the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]] when the high priest confessed the sins of Israel over the head of the scapegoat ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:21|HE}}).

Some critics have accused Adventists of giving Satan the status of sin-bearer alongside Jesus Christ. Adventists have responded by insisting that Satan is not a saviour, nor does he provide atonement for sin; Christ alone is the substitutionary sacrifice for sin, but holds no responsibility for it. In the final judgment, responsibility for sin is passed back to Satan who first caused mankind to sin.  As the responsible party, Satan receives the wages for his sin – namely, death. Jesus alone bore the wage of death for the sinful world, while the guilt of sin is ultimately disposed of on Satan who carried the responsibility of  "leading the whole world astray."  Thus, the unsaved are held responsible for their own sin, while the saved depend on Christ's righteousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdanet.org/atissue/books/qod/index.htm Seventh-day Adventists Answer Questions on Doctrine], Review and Herald Publishing Association, Washington D.C., 1957. Chapters 34 ''The Meaning of Azazel'' and 35 ''The Transaction With the Scapegoat''.&lt;/ref&gt; The SDA Sabbath School quarterly, 2013 asks the question, "Does Satan then play a role in our salvation, as some falsely charge we teach? Of course not. Satan never, in any way, bears sin for us as a substitute. Jesus alone has done that, and it is blasphemy to think that Satan had any part in our redemption."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ssnet.org/lessons/13d/less06m.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]]ic tradition, Azazel ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: عزازيل ''Azāzīl'', also known as [[Arabic language|Arabic]]: حارث ''Ḥārith'' ) is depicted as a former archangel, who is identified with [[Iblis]], that means "to despair". Accordingly Azazel despaired from God, thus earning him the name ''Iblis''.&lt;ref name="Peter Lamborn Wilson page 87"&gt;Peter Lamborn Wilson ''Sacred Drift: Essays on the Margins of Islam'' City Lights Books 1993 {{ISBN|978-0-872-86275-3}} page 87&lt;/ref&gt; The name Azazel is also related to the Arabic words ''Aziz'' and ''il'' with the meaning either ''God's strength'' or ''God's dear'', the latter referring to Azazil, as God's once favorite angel.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Saad Assel ''25 Icons of Peace in the Qur'an: Lessons of Harmony'' iUniverse 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-440-16901-4}} page 190&lt;/ref&gt; Although Azazel is not mentioned by name in [[Quran]], he is commonly mentioned in some reports of the ''[[Sahabah]]'' especially those attributed to [[Ibn Abbas]]. 

Sometimes Azazel is recognized as an angel different from Iblis, who accompanied [[Harut and Marut]] to earth. In this case, Azazel appears in direct reference to the [[Watcher (angel)|Watchers]].&lt;ref&gt;Haggai Ben-Shammai, Shaul Shaked, Sarah Stroumsa (and Patricia Crone in this certain chapter) ''Exchange and transmission across cultural boundaries'' Yehuda Greenbaum 2005 ISBN 928-965-208-188-9 p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Features ===
Traditionally Azazel is depicted as an angel with four wings,&lt;ref name="Scott B. Noegel page 295"&gt;Scott B. Noegel, Brannon M. Wheeler ''The A to Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'' Scarecrow Press 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-461-71895-6}} page 295&lt;/ref&gt; who was the leader and teacher of the other angels. Additionally he was appointed as the ruler of the lower heavens and the earths&lt;ref&gt;SUNY Press ''History of al-Tabari Vol. 1, The: General Introduction and From the Creation to the Flood, Band 1''2015 {{ISBN|978-1-438-41783-7}} page 254&lt;/ref&gt; and was member of an angelic group called 'jinn', who were the guardians of [[Jannah]].{{sfn|Stephen J. Vicchio|Biblical Figures in the Islamic Faith|page=184 ps.= Jinn here, designates a group of angels, the origin of their name came from "Jannah", because they were its keeper. Should not be confused with the "Jinn" as a spiritual entity on earth}}{{sfn| Patrick Hughes| ''Dictionary of Islam'' Asian Educational Services|page= 135 ps.= some Muslims hold, shares the same verbal root than the earthen Jinn (hidden) but here, due to his special position, he was veiled from the eyes of the other regular angels}} Then the [[Jinn|former inhabitants]] of earth caused corruption, Azazel came down from the heavens with an army of angels to defeat them.&lt;ref&gt;Brannon Wheeler ''Prophets in the Quran: An Introduction to the Quran and Muslim Exegesis'' A&amp;C Black 2002 {{ISBN|9780826449566}} Page 16&lt;/ref&gt; Then [[God in Islam|God]] created human to supersede the former inhabitants of earth, Azazil grow haughty, since he thought, the angels were now the favorite creation of God, thereupon He ordered the angels to prostrate before human as a test.&lt;ref&gt;Lucinda Mosher ''Sin, Forgiveness, and Reconciliation: Christian and Muslim Perspectives'' Georgetown University Press 2016 {{ISBN|978-1-626-16284-6}} page 46&lt;/ref&gt; Azazel along with the angels argued, why God should create a human being, who will shed blood and confusion like the former inhabitants, whom they had just defeated before, while the angels prostrate before God and sing his glory day and night, thus would never fail Gods orders.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel I. Ilega ''Studies in World Religions'' Hamaz Global Publishing {{ISBN|978-9-783-57580-6}} page 83&lt;/ref&gt; Since Azazel insisted on being superior than any other creature, even compared to other angels,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen J. Vicchio ''Biblical Figures in the Islamic Faith'' Wipf and Stock Publishers 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-556-35304-8}} page 184&lt;/ref&gt; he refused to prostrate himself, whereupon he was cast out of heaven.

The eleventh-century Islamic scholar [[Al-Tha`labi]] listed in his work ''Arāʾis al-madjālis fī ḳiṣaṣ al-anbiyā'' the ten punishments of Azazel for his refusal&lt;ref&gt;Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad Thaʻlabī ''Islamische Erzählungen von Propheten und Gottesmännern: Qiṣaṣ al-anbiyāʼ oder ʻArāʼis al-maǧālis'' Otto Harrassowitz Verlag 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-447-05266-5}} page 45 (german)&lt;/ref&gt;:
* He lost his rank as a member of the keepers of paradise.
* He was cast down to earth, expelled from the presence of God.
* He was turned from an angel into a [[Shaitan|demon]]. 
* His name was changed into ''iblis''.
* He became the head of the damned.
* He was cursed by God.
* His insights was taken away.
* The door of repentance was closed for him
* He was made unruly, someone who misses the mercy of God.
* He became the preacher of the hellfire.

Further Al-Tha`labi relates a story, in which Azazel tried to sneak back into the [[Garden of Eden|Garden Eden]] and tricked its keeper by hiding inside the mouth of a serpent and with the aid of a peacock.&lt;ref&gt; name="Scott B. Noegel page 295"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malays narrative===
In [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] lore, Azazel appears both as an angel and [[Jann (legendary creature)|''Al-Jann'']]. Accordingly, Azazel used to be  an angel, but was turned into Jann after his refusal to bow down before Adam and then begot the [[Jinn]]. They once dwelled in the lowest heaven, but descended to earth, then they battled each other and become disobedient towards God.&lt;ref&gt;name="Robert Lebling "&gt;Robert Lebling ''Legends of the Fire Spirits: Jinn and Genies from Arabia to Zanzibar'' I.B.Tauris 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-857-73063-3}} page 211&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mystic interpretations ===
==== Ismailism ====
Another example can be seen in the [[Isma'ilism|Isma'ili]] literature of the [[Ginans]]. [[Pir Sadardin]] explains in the fourth verse of his Ginan ''Allah ek kassam'':&lt;ref&gt;[http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/13705726?n=55 Pīr Ṣadr ad-Dīn. "100 ginānjī ćopaḍī ćogaḍīevārī". Bombay: Lāljībhāī Devrāj, Khojā Siñdhā Ćhāpākhānû, 1903. MS Indic 2534. Houghton Library, Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;All the present angels performed their prostrations to human and human accepted the prostrations
Azāzīl did not obey The Commandment, and as such he was reduced in his status earned [that is, of an angel and the blessings thereof]&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] work [[Umm al-Kitab (Ismaili book)|Umm al-Kitab]], Azazel is the first emanation of the ''high king'' (God) and loaned the power of creation from Him. Because he was also able to create, he boasted himself being another god besides his Creator.&lt;ref&gt;Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer ''The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition'' Shambhala Publications 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}} page 707&lt;/ref&gt; God answered him: "It is impossible, that there will be two gods."&lt;ref&gt;Yaron Friedman ''The Nuṣayrī-ʻAlawīs: An Introduction to the Religion, History, and Identity of the Leading Minority in Syria'' BRILL 2010 {{ISBN|978-9-004-17892-2}} page 97&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards God made a creation which exceeds these of Azazel, so Azazel may confess, he wholly depends on God. But Azazel refuses to accept the new creation 'Salman', therefore he sinned again. Everytime, Azazel sinned, God took away a colour until he and those who sided with him, became darker and more inferior. Finally they reach the earthen plane, that is accordingly made out of the essence of Azazels creation. In contrast, the lifeforce of human originated from the heavenly realm.&lt;ref&gt;Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer ''The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition'' Shambhala Publications 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}} page 726&lt;/ref&gt; Azazel whereupon  seduces humans, leading them into the material realm, trying to keep them trapped there. The depiction of Azazel in Umm al-Kitab, resembles the [[Gnostic]] [[Demiurge]].&lt;ref&gt;Willis Barnstone, Marvin Meyer ''The Gnostic Bible: Revised and Expanded Edition'' Shambhala Publications 2009 {{ISBN|978-0-834-82414-0}} page 803&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alevism ====
According to [[alevism|Alevi]] [[oral tradition]] regarding the creation of the world, the archangel [[Gabriel#Islam|Cebrail]] (Gabriel) taught the other archangels [[Michael (archangel)|Mikail]], [[Israfil]], [[Azrail]] and Azazel, they are all creatures made by God. All of these angels believed him, except Azazel. Thus Cebrail introduced Azazel to follow, showing him the truth about their origin. Thereupon Cebrail led Azazel to a lamp, which had seven doors, but these doors won't open. A voice sounded, they shall serve here for 1001 days. They all did, after that the doors opened and the angels entered the lamp. Inside the lamp there were two lights forming one body. A voice sounded again, commanding the angels to prostrate themselves before the light. Azazel responded: "This is also a created body", and refused to prostrate himself before the lights, but remained in service of God. In Alevi perspective, this narration shows that Azazel served God, until the "last door" opened, but then he despised it and moved into the "Ego-world". This causing the later enmity between Satan and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Handan Aksünger ''Jenseits des Schweigegebots: Alevitische Migrantenselbstorganisationen und zivilgesellschaftliche Integration in Deutschland und den Niederlanden'' Waxmann Verlag 2013 {{ISBN|978-3-830-97883-1}} page 83-84&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sufism ====
According to [[Sufism]], Azazel commonly served God over thousands of years before the creation of the world. God forbid him to worship something else than his Creator. Therefore Azazel declined, then God ordered the angels to prostrate themselves before Adam. He did not know, that worshiping by the command of God is equivalent to worshipping God. Thus, in reference to [[Surah]] {{cite quran|15|35|s=ns|b=n}}, God's curse lies upon Azazel until the [[Islamic eschatology|Day of Judgment]] and he became the representative for God's attributes in respect to misleading, darkness and majesty. After the world perishes, Azazel's curse is broken and he will return to his place in heaven. Some Sufi writers such as the tenth-century mystic [[Mansur Al-Hallaj]], hold that Azazel will indeed be dammned and not restored after the Day of Judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Reynold A. Nicholson ''Studies in Islamic Mysticism'' CUP Archive 1978 {{ISBN|978-0-521-29546-8}} page 120-121&lt;/ref&gt;

Mansur Al-Hallaj mentioned Azazel in his collection ''Tawasin''. Chapter Six of that writing is dedicated to the self-defence of Azazel, and in one section Hallaj explains how each of the letters of Azazel's name relate to his personality.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Sells, ''Early Islamic Mysticism'' (Mahwah, New Jersey: Paulist Press, 1996), 266–280&lt;/ref&gt;

Azazel is also mentioned three times  in [[Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī]]s [[Masnavi]], stating: &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Due to obedience the heaven became filled with light and due to obedience the angels became flawless and holy. Impudence darkened the sun  and because of his impudence Azazil was shown the door.&lt;ref&gt; Moulana Jalal ad-din Rumi ''Masnavi'' edition shershir translated by Bernhard Meyer, Kaveh and Jilla Dalir Azar (1. Edition 1999) Peter Finckh 2012 (2 Edition) {{ISBN|978-3-9-06-005-02-7}} p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; In the second mentioning, ''Azazil'' is used synonymously with ''Eblis'' (Iblis) and yet in another instance, ecstasy of excessive self-awareness turned him from ''Azazil'' to ''Elbis''.&lt;ref&gt; Moulana Jalal ad-din Rumi ''Masnavi'' edition shershir translated by Bernhard Meyer, Kaveh and Jilla Dalir Azar (1. Edition 1999) Peter Finckh 2012 (2 Edition) {{ISBN|978-3-9-06-005-06-5}} p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Yazidism==
In [[Yazidism]], Azazel appears as one of the Archangels, along with [[Gabriel|Jabra'il]], [[Michael (archangel)|Mika'il]], [[Raphael (archangel)|Rafa'il]] ([[Israfil]]), Dadra'il, [[Azrail]] and Shamkil (Shemna'il).&lt;ref&gt;Adam Valen Levinson ''The Abu Dhabi Bar Mitzvah: Fear and Love in the Modern Middle East'' W. W. Norton &amp; Company 2017 {{ISBN|978-0-393-60837-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Yazidi legend, Azazel was once banished to [[hell]], but then repented his sin, crying until the fires of hell were extinguished, eventually returned to God's grace.&lt;ref&gt;Birgül Acikyildiz ''The Yezidis: The History of a Community, Culture and Religion'' I. B. Tauris 2010 {{ISBN|978-1-848-85274-7}} page 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Till today, Beddawi remains the main connection between the northern most coast and the rest of Lebanon since the main coastal highway goes through the town.

Until the 1950s Beddawi was a little village surrounded by fields and had less than a 1,000 inhabitants.
In 1955 the [[Palestinian refugee]]s built a camp near the city and named it [[Beddawi camp]]. In 1983 the city underwent several battles between the Palestinian Militias and parts of it were severely damaged.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13185">{{Maya civilization}}
'''Bloodletting''' was the [[ritual]]ized self-cutting or [[piercing]] of an individual's body that served a number of [[ideology|ideological]] and [[cultural]] functions within ancient [[Mesoamerica]]n societies, in particular the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. When performed by ruling elites, the act of bloodletting was crucial to the maintenance of sociocultural and political structure. Bound within the Mesoamerican belief systems, bloodletting was used as a tool to legitimize the ruling [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]'s socio-political position and, when enacted, was important to the perceived well-being of a given society or settlement.

==Description==
[[File:Bloodletter Handle (left).jpg|thumb|left|[[Mexico]], probably Guerrero, Olmec Blood-letter Handle, 1000-600BC]]
Bloodletting was performed by piercing a soft body part, generally the [[tongue]] or [[penis]], and scattering the blood or collecting it on paper, which was subsequently burned.&lt;ref&gt;See Joyce et al., p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The act of burning the sacrificed blood symbolized the transferral of the offering to the gods via its transformation into the rising [[smoke]].

Piercing was accomplished using [[obsidian]] [[prismatic blade]]s, [[stingray]] spines, or [[shark]]'s teeth. Under some circumstances, a rope with attached [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorn]]s or obsidian flakes would be pulled through the tongue or earlobes.

[[Jade use in Mesoamerica|Jade]] or stone spines and teeth have been found in the [[Archaeological site|archaeological]] record. Some of these jade artifacts have rather dull points but might have been used once the initial cut was made, or might purely be ritualistic objects not used in actual bloodletting.&lt;ref&gt;Taube, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The location of the bloodletting on the body often correlated with an intended result or a corresponding symbolic representation. For example, drawing blood from the genitals, especially the male sex organs, would be done with the intent of increasing or representing human [[fertility]].

==Ritual performance==
[[File:British Museum Maya blood-letting relief.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Yaxchilan Lintel 24|Lintel 24]] at [[Yaxchilan]], depicting  [[Lady Xoc]] drawing a barbed rope through her tongue.]]
Ritualized bloodletting was typically performed by elites, settlement leaders, and religious figures (e.g., [[Maya shamanism|shamans]]) within contexts visible to the public. The rituals were enacted on the summits of [[Mesoamerican pyramid|pyramids]] or on elevated platforms that were usually associated with broad and open [[plaza]]s or courtyards (where the masses could congregate and view the bloodletting). This was done so as to demonstrate the connection the person performing the auto-sacrifice had with the sacred sphere and, as such, a method used to maintain [[political power]] by legitimizing their prominent social, political, and/or ideological position.

While usually carried out by a ruling [[Ajaw|male]], prominent females are also known to have performed the act. The [[El Perú (Maya site)|El Perú]] tomb of a female (called the "Queen's Tomb") contains among its many [[grave good]]s a ceremonial stingray spine associated with her genital region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/05/040506073833.htm|title=Archaeologists Announce Discoveries At The Ancient Maya Site Of Waka' In Northern Guatemala|date=May 6, 2004|accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best-known lintels from Mesoamerica, [[Yaxchilan]] [[Yaxchilan Lintel 24|Lintel 24]] (right), shows [[Lady Xoc]] drawing a barbed rope through her tongue. In front of her, her husband and the ruler of [[Yaxchilan]], [[Shield Jaguar]], is shown holding a [[torch]].

==Ideological undertones==
{{see also|Maya mythology|Maya religion}}
Among all the Mesoamerican cultures, sacrifice, in whatever form, was a deeply symbolic and highly ritualized activity with strong religious and political significance. Various kinds of sacrifice were performed within a range of sociocultural contexts and in association with a variety of activities, from mundane everyday activities to those performed by the elites and ruling lineages with the aim of maintaining social structure. The social structure was maintained by showing that rulers blood sacrifice to the gods showed the power they had. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org?stable20166705|title=JSTOR|website=www.jstor.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At its core, sacrifice symbolized the renewal of divine energy and, in doing so, the continuation of life. Its ability of bloodletting to do this is based on two intertwined concepts that are prevalent in the Maya belief system. The first is the notion that the [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|gods]] had given life to humankind by sacrificing parts of their own bodies. The second is the central focus of their mythology on human [[blood]], which signified life among the Maya. Within their belief system, human blood was partially made up of the blood of the gods, who sacrificed their own divine blood in creating life in humans. Thus, in order to continually maintain the order of their universe, the Maya believed that blood had to be given back to the gods. The rulers are giving their blood to empower the gods in return for giving them life. 

[[File:Olmec bloodletting spoon.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Olmec-style jadeite "spoon", believed to be a perforator, from Guerrero. 1500-300 BC&lt;ref&gt;This particular artifact, from the [[Snite Museum of Art]], is labelled as a bloodletter. This is echoed by Gillett Griffin, who states that the spoon "probably had a ritual function in bloodletting or in the absorption of hallucinogens for ritual purposes" (Griffin, p. 219).  There is some disagreement, however, in this identification: [[Justin Kerr]], for example, tentatively identifies similar Maya implements as "symbolic jade versions" of a paint container for a scribe (see [http://www.mayavase.com/sabak/sabak.html "Where Do You Wear Your Paint-Pot?"].&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Depictions of bloodletting in Mesoamerican cultures==
Unlike later cultures, there is no representation of actual bloodletting in Olmec art. However, solid evidence for its practice exists in the jade and ceramic replicas of stingray spines and shark teeth as well as representations of such paraphernalia on monuments and [[stelae]]&lt;ref&gt;Two apparent perforators hang across the chest of the figure in Monument 6 of ''Laguna de los Cerros''. Taube, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[iconography]].&lt;ref&gt;Icons which represent bloodletting are thought to include a [[fish]] zoo-morph. See Joyce et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposed translation of the [[Epi-Olmec culture]]'s [[La Mojarra Stela 1]], dated to roughly AD 155, tells of the ruler's ritual bloodletting by piercing his penis and his buttocks, as well as what appears to be a ritual sacrifice of the ruler's brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman (2000) and Justeson and Kaufman (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloodletting permeated Maya life. Kings performed bloodletting at every major political event. Building dedications, burials, [[marriage]]s, and births all required bloodletting.&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Miller, p. 175-176.&lt;/ref&gt; As demonstrated by Yaxchilan Lintels 24 and 25, and duplicated in Lintels 17 and 15, bloodletting in Maya culture was also a means to a [[vision quest]], where fasting, loss of blood, and perhaps [[List of psychoactive plants|hallucinogenics]] lead to visions of ancestors or gods.

Contemporaneous with the Maya, the south-central panel at the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic era]] South Ballcourt at [[El Tajín]] shows the rain god piercing his penis, the blood from which flows into and replenishes a vat of the [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]ic ritual drink ''[[pulque]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkerson, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early European reactions==
Following the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] conquest of the [[Aztec]]s in 1521, many Spanish missionary-ethnographers arrived and recorded graphic and often unsympathetic descriptions of these rituals among both the Mayan and [[Nahuatl]] speaking peoples. Although most understood the religious significance of the rites, such [[idolatry]] merely confirmed the need for rapid conversion to [[Christianity]]. Many also confused genital bloodletting with [[circumcision]], not least because they believed Indians were descendants of the [[lost tribes of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Diego Durán]]'s [https://books.google.com/books?id=193tKPdM-ykC&amp;pg=PR29 ''The History of the Indies of New Spain''], for Jewish origins and his [http://openlibrary.org/b/OL13741298M/Book_of_the_gods_and_rites Gods and Rites] for circumcision&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first to recognise the distinction was [[Diego de Landa]] in a 1566 manuscript:&lt;blockquote&gt;"At times they sacrificed their own blood, cutting all around the ears in strips which they let hang as a sign. At other times they perforated their cheeks or the lower lip; again they made cuts in parts of the body, or pierced the tongue crossways and passed stalks through, causing extreme pain; again they hewed at the superfluous part of the penis, leaving the flesh in the  form of two floppy ears. It was this custom which misled [''engaño''] the historian-general of the Indies to say that they practised circumcision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;(''original translation'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Nonetheless, the misconception that the Aztec and Maya people practised circumcision persists to this day.

The '''Bukhar Khudahs''' or '''Bukhar Khudats''' ([[Sogdian language|Sogdian]]: ''βuxārak Xwaday'') were a local [[Sogdia]]n dynasty, which ruled the city of [[Bukhara]] from an unknown date to the reign of the [[Samanid]] ruler [[Isma'il ibn Ahmad]], who incorporated Bukhara into the Samanid state.

== Etymology ==
[[Image:KhunakCoin.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Coin of Khunuk]]
The word “Bukhar” means Bukhara, while “khuda” means “lord”. Thus the word means “the lord of Bukhara”.

== History ==
The founding date of the Bukhar Khudahs remains unknown; the 10th-century [[Iranian people|Iranian]] historian [[Narshakhi]] is known to have mentioned several names of rulers of Bukhara, but it is not known if they were all from the same dynasty. The first ruler mentioned by Narshakhi is [[Abru'i]] (also spelled Abarzi). According to Narshakhi, he was a cruel ruler, who was overthrown by a certain [[Turkic people|Turkic]] king named [[Qara Jurjin]]. The next ruler is named [[Kana of Bukhara|Kana]], who is said to have introduced the minting of coins in Bukhara, which is, however, doubted by modern scholars. The next ruler is given as [[Makh of Bukhara|Makh]], who was credited with the building of a [[bazaar]] that was named after him. The first ruler mentioned with the title of Bukhar Khudah is named [[Bindu of Bukhara|Bindu]], who was killed in 681 by the [[Umayyad]] general [[Salm ibn Ziyad]] during the first Arab attempts to [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana|conquer]] [[Transoxiana]]. He was succeeded by his few months-old son [[Tughshada]]. However, the kingdom was in reality controlled by Tughshada's mother, who is only known by her title of [[Khatun]],{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=18}} and is celebrated in the local historical tradition for her wisdom and capable management.&lt;ref name="Hoyland"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert G. Hoyland|title=In Gods Path: The Arab Conquests and the Creation of an Islamic Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zvmKBAAAQBAJ|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|pages=120–121}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is reported to have held court daily, "inquired into the affairs of state and issued orders and prohibitions," while at a distance stood "two hundred youths from the landowners and the princes ready for service, girded with gold belts and bearing swords."&lt;ref name="Hoyland"/&gt; In 676 she dispatched a contingent to aid an Arab assault on [[Samarqand]].&lt;ref name="Hoyland"/&gt;

In 706, a civil war erupted in Bukhara and its surrounding cities and towns; the ruler of the nearby [[Wardana]], known as the ''Wardan Khudah'', had seized most of the principality, while a Sogdian magnate named [[Khunuk Khudah]], managed to rally the nobles of Bukhara around him and declared himself as the Bukhar Khudah. At the same time, the new Umayyad governor of [[Khurasan]], [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]], had captured [[Paykand]], a city near Bukhara. The city soon revolted, and the Arabs responded by sacking the city. The brutality of the sack of Paykand shocked the Sogdian world, and led the nobles of Bukhara under Khunuk to make an alliance with the Wardan Khudah. However, during the fighting between the Arabs and Sogdians, the Wardan Khudah was killed, which probably constituted a heavy blow to the Bukhara-Wardana alliance.{{sfn|Gibb|1923|pp=34–35}} Bukhara was shortly after captured by Qutayba, who imposed a tribute of 200,000 ''[[dirham]]s'', and installed an Arab garrison to secure against rebellion. During the same time, another Sogdian king named [[Tarkhun]], who was the ruler of [[Samarkand]], acknowledged the authority of the Umayyad Caliphate.{{sfn|Bosworth|1986|p=541}}{{sfn|Gibb|1923|pp=35-36}}{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=65}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1927|p=435}} After having settled an affair in [[Tokharistan]], Qutayba restored Bukhara to the young Tughshada, and the faction of Khunuk including himself were executed.

Later, in 712/3, in order to spread [[Islam]] in Bukhara, Qutayba built a mosque in the city's citadel, and even encouraged the natives to convert by paying them to attend the prayers. However, Islamization proceeded very slowly, and the rulers of Bukhara would remain [[Zoroastrian]] until their downfall.{{sfn|Bosworth|1986|p=541}}{{sfn|Gibb|1923|pp=38-39}}{{sfn|Shaban|1979|p=67}} Tughshada, however, still tried to achieve independence from the Umayyad Caliphate, and in 718, along with Tarkhun's successor [[Gurak]], Narayana, the king of Kumadh, and Tish, the king of [[Principality of Chaghaniyan|Chaghaniyan]], he sent an embassy to the [[Tang dynasty]] of [[China]], where they asked for aid against the Arabs.{{sfn|Gibb|1923|p=60}} In ca. 728, a anti-Arab revolt erupted in Bukhara, which was suppressed one year later. Tughshada was assassinated by two angry ''[[dehqan]]'' nobles in 739, and was succeeded by his son [[Qutayba of Bukhara|Qutayba]], who was named in honour of the Umayyad general.

In 750, the Umayyad Caliphate was conquered by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], who became the new masters of [[Central Asia]]. However, this erupted in a local rebellion in Bukhara led by a certain Sharik ibn Shaikh.{{sfn|Litvinsky|Dani|1996|p=458}} The Abbasid general [[Abu Muslim Khorasani]] sent an army under [[Ziyad ibn Salih]] to suppress the rebellion, but the rebels managed to emerge victorious. Qutayba, at the head of an army numbering 10,000 soldiers, aided the Abbasids in their fight against Sharik, and in the end managed to defeat and kill the latter.{{sfn|Litvinsky|Dani|1996|p=458}} However, because of Qutayba's attitude towards the Arabs, he was murdered in 750 at the orders of Abu Muslim Khorasani, and was succeeded by his brother Sakan, who ruled until ca. 757 when he too was murdered by Abbasid agents. He was succeeded by another brother named Bunyat, who, because of his support to [[al-Muqanna]], was murdered in 783. After the rule of Bunyat, there is no information about any of his successors, except for the last ruler of Bukhara, [[Abu Ishaq Ibrahim of Bukhara|Abu Ishaq Ibrahim]], whose kingdom was annexed by the [[Samanid]] ruler [[Isma'il ibn Ahmad]]. Abu Ishaq died in 913, but his descendants' royal status was still known during the lifetime of Narshakhi.

== Religion ==
The majority of the inhabitants of Bukhara, including the rulers of the city, were Zoroastrians. However, there were also traces of [[Nestorian Christianity]], and even a church in Bukhara during the rule of the Bukhar Khudahs is mentioned by Narshakhi.{{sfn|Litvinsky|Dani|1996|p=418}}

'''''Datura''''' is a [[genus]] of nine species of poisonous [[Vespertine (biology)|vespertine]] [[flowering plant]]s belonging to the family [[Solanaceae]]. They are commonly known as daturas, but also known as '''devil's trumpets''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Datura metel|url = https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/all/datura-metel/|website = plants.ces.ncsu.edu|access-date = 2016-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to be confused with angel's trumpets, its closely related genus ''[[Brugmansia]]''. They are also sometimes called '''moonflowers''', '''jimsonweed''', '''devil's weed''', '''hell's bells''', '''thorn-apple''', and many more. Its precise and natural distribution is uncertain, owing to its extensive [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] and [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalization]] throughout the temperate and tropical regions of the globe. Its distribution within the [[Americas]] and [[North Africa]], however, is most likely restricted to the United States, Mexico and Southern Canada in North America, and [[Tunisia]] in Africa where the highest species diversity occurs.

All species of ''Datura'' are poisonous, especially their seeds and flowers.

Some [[South America]]n plants formerly thought of as ''Datura'' are now treated as belonging to the distinct genus ''[[Brugmansia]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor = Hawkes, J. G. |author1=Lester, R. N. |author2=Nee, M. |author3=Estrada, N. | title = Solanaceae III – Taxonomy, Chemistry, Evolution (Proceedings of Third International Conference on Solanaceae) | publisher = Royal Botanic Gardens | year = 1991 | location = Kew | pages = 197–210 | isbn = 0-947643-31-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Brugmansia'' differs from ''Datura'' in that it is woody, making [[shrub]]s or small [[tree]]s, and it has pendulous flowers, rather than erect ones). Other related taxa include 
''[[Hyoscyamus niger]]'', ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', ''[[Mandragora officinarum]]'', [[ Physalis]], and many more.

==Etymology==
The name ''Datura'' is taken from [[Sanskrit]] धतूरा ''{{transl|hi|dhatūra}}'' 'thorn-apple',&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary: ''datura''&lt;/ref&gt; ultimately from [[Sanskrit]] धत्तूर ''{{IAST|dhattūra}}'' 'white thorn-apple' (referring to ''[[Datura metel]]'' of Asia).&lt;ref name="MWSD"&gt;{{MWSD}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] text [[Sushruta]] different species of Datura are also referred to as ''{{IAST|kanaka}}'' and ''{{IAST|unmatta}}''.&lt;ref name="MWSD"/&gt; Dhatura is offered to [[Shiva]] in [[Hinduism]]. Record of this name in English dates back to 1662.&lt;ref&gt;the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' or [[OED]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] refers to one type in ''[[The Scarlet Letter]]'' as ''apple-Peru''. In Mexico, its common name is ''toloache''.

==Description==
''Datura'' species are [[Herbaceous plant|herbaceous]], leafy [[annual plant|annuals]] and short-lived [[perennial plant|perennials]] which can reach up to 2 m in height. The [[leaf|leaves]] are alternate, 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm long and 5–18&amp;nbsp;cm broad, with a lobed or toothed margin. The [[flower]]s are erect or spreading (not pendulous like those of ''Brugmansia''), trumpet-shaped, 5–20&amp;nbsp;cm long and 4–12&amp;nbsp;cm broad at the mouth; colors vary from white to yellow, pink, and pale purple. The [[fruit]] is a spiny [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]] 4–10&amp;nbsp;cm long and 2–6&amp;nbsp;cm broad, splitting open when ripe to release the numerous [[seed]]s. The seeds disperse freely over pastures, fields and even wasteland locations.

''Datura'' belongs to the classic "witches' weeds", along with [[deadly nightshade]], [[henbane]], and [[Mandragora officinarum|mandrake]]. Most parts of the plants are toxic, and datura has a long history of use for causing delirious states and death. It was well known as an essential ingredient of potions and witches' brews.&lt;ref name="Preissel"/&gt;

In India it has been referred to as "Poisonous" and as an [[aphrodisiac]]. In little measures it was used in [[Ayurveda]] as a medicine from the ancient times. It is used in rituals and prayers to [[Shiva]]. It is also used in [[Ganesh Chaturthi]].

The [[Caterpillar|larvae]] of some [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species, including ''[[Hypercompe|Hypercompe indecisa]]'', eat some ''Datura'' species.

==Species and cultivars==
[[File:Datura FR 2012.jpg|thumb|''Datura metel'']]
It is difficult to classify ''Datura'' as to its species, and it often happens that the descriptions of new species are accepted prematurely. Later, these "new species" are found to be simply varieties that have evolved due to conditions at a specific location. They usually disappear in a few years. Contributing to the confusion is the fact that various species, such as ''D. wrightii'' and ''D. inoxia'', are very similar in appearance, and the variation within a species can be extreme. For example, ''Datura'' species can change size of plant, leaf, and flowers, all depending on location. The same species, when growing in a half-shady, damp location can develop into a flowering bush half as tall as an adult human of average height, but when growing in a very dry location, will only grow into a thin plant not much more than ankle-high, with tiny flowers and a few miniature leaves.&lt;ref name='Preissel'&gt;{{cite book |author1=Preissel, U. |author2=Preissel, H.-G. | title = Brugmansia and Datura: Angel's Trumpets and Thorn Apples | publisher = Firefly Books | year = 2002 | location = Buffalo, NY | pages = 106–129 |  isbn = 1-55209-598-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, experts classify only nine species of ''Datura'':&lt;ref name="Preissel"/&gt;

* ''[[Datura ceratocaula|D. ceratocaula]]'' &lt;small&gt;[[Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin|Jacq.]]&lt;/small&gt; – ''torna loco''

==Cultivation==

[[File:Datura innoxia fruit split open.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''D. inoxia'' with ripe, split-open fruit]]
''Datura'' species are usually planted annually from the seed produced in the spiny pods, but with care, plants can be overwintered. Most species are suited to being planted outside or in containers. As a rule, they need warm, sunny places and soil that will keep their roots dry. When grown outdoors in good locations, the plants tend to reseed themselves and may become invasive. In containers, they should have porous, aerated potting soil with adequate drainage. The plants are susceptible to fungi in the root area, so anaerobic organic enrichment such as anaerobically composted organic matter or manure, should be avoided.&lt;ref name="Preissel"/&gt;

==Toxicity==
All ''Datura'' plants contain [[tropane alkaloids]] such as [[scopolamine]], [[hyoscyamine]], and [[atropine]], primarily in their seeds and flowers. Because of the presence of these substances, ''Datura'' has been used for centuries in some cultures as a [[poison]].&lt;ref name="Preissel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Adams, J. D.

These variations make ''Datura'' exceptionally hazardous as a drug.

In traditional cultures, a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of ''Datura'' was critical to minimize harm.&lt;ref name="Preissel"/&gt; Many tragic incidents result from modern users ingesting ''Datura''. For example, in the 1990s and 2000s, the United States media contained stories of [[adolescent]]s and young adults dying or becoming seriously ill from intentionally ingesting ''Datura''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5233a2.htm |author1=Goetz, R. |author2=Siegel, E. |author3=Scaglione, J. |author4=Belson, M. |author5=Patel, M. | title = Suspected Moonflower Intoxication – Ohio, 2002 | journal = MMWR.

''Datura'' toxins may be ingested accidentally by consumption of [[honey]] produced by several wasp species, including ''[[Brachygastra lecheguana]]'', during the ''Datura'' blooming season. It appears that these semi-domesticated [[honey wasp]]s collect ''Datura'' nectar for honey production which can lead to poisoning.&lt;ref name="Bequaert"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bequaert, J.Q. |year=1932|title=The Nearctic social wasps of the subfamily polybiinae (Hymenoptera; Vespidae)|journal= Entomologica Americana|volume= 13|issue=3|pages=87–150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some parts of [[Europe]] and [[India]], ''Datura'' has been a popular [[poison]] for [[suicide]] and [[murder]]. From 1950 to 1965, the State Chemical Laboratories in [[Agra]], India, investigated 2,778 deaths caused by ingesting ''Datura.''&lt;ref name="Preissel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SS1"&gt;{{cite web| last=Andrews|first=Dale |title=Daturas| url=http://www.sleuthsayers.org/2012/02/daturas.html |work=Crime Poisons| publisher=SleuthSayers |accessdate=4 March 2013| location=Washington |date=2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported accidental poisoning resulting in hospitalization for a family of six who inadvertently ingested ''Datura'' used as an ingredient in stew.&lt;ref name='CDCStew'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Jimsonweed Poisoning Associated with a Homemade Stew – Maryland, 2008 | journal = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention – Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report | date = 2010-02-05 | first = W. | last = Bontoyan | volume = 59 | issue = 4 | pages = 102–103 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm5904.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = 2010-02-11 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some places, it is prohibited to buy, sell, or cultivate ''Datura'' plants.&lt;ref name="Preissel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SS1" /&gt;

===Effects of ingestion===
Due to the potent combination of [[anticholinergic]] substances it contains, ''Datura'' intoxication typically produces effects similar to that of an anticholinergic [[delirium]] (usually involving a complete inability to differentiate [[reality]] from [[fantasy]]); [[hyperthermia]]; [[tachycardia]]; bizarre, and possibly violent behavior; and severe [[mydriasis]] (dilated pupils) with resultant painful [[photophobia]] that can last several days. Muscle stiffness and temporary paralysis is often reported and pronounced [[amnesia]] is another commonly reported effect.&lt;ref name='Freye'&gt;{{cite book | last = Freye | first = E. | title = Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs | chapter = Toxicity of Datura Stramonium | publisher = Springer | year = 2010 | location = Netherlands | pages = 217–218 | isbn = 978-90-481-2447-3 | doi = 10.1007/978-90-481-2448-0_34 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychoactive use ===

In ''Pharmacology and Abuse of Cocaine, Amphetamines, Ecstasy and Related Designer Drugs'', Freye asserts:
Few substances have received as many severely negative recreational experience reports as has ''Datura''. The overwhelming majority of those who describe their use of ''Datura'' find their experiences extremely unpleasant both mentally and often physically dangerous.&lt;ref name = "Freye"/&gt;  However, anthropologists have found that indigenous groups, with a great deal of experience with and detailed knowledge of ''Datura'', have been known to use Datura spiritually (including the [[Navajo]] and especially the [[Havasupai]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3736/jintegrmed2013016|pmid=23506688|title=A review on the pharmacological and toxicological aspects of ''Datura stramonium'' L|journal=Journal of Integrative Medicine|volume=11|issue=2|pages=73|year=2013|last1=Gaire|first1=Bhakta Prasad|last2=Subedi|first2=Lalita}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stairways to Heaven: Drugs in American Religious History | first= Robert C | last=Fuller| year=2000| page=32| isbn=0813366127|publisher=Basic Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again, knowledge of Datura's properties is necessary to facilitate a healthy experience.&lt;ref name="Preissel"/&gt;
Southern Paiute Indians believe Datura can help locate missing objects.&lt;ref&gt;Southern Paiute Shamanism by ISABEL T. KELLY (1939) http://digitalassets.lib.berkeley.edu/anthpubs/ucb/text/ucar002-005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===
Due to their agitated behavior and confused mental state, victims of ''Datura'' poisoning are typically hospitalized. Gastric lavage and the administration of [[activated charcoal]] can be used to reduce the stomach's absorption of the ingested material. The drug [[physostigmine]] is used to reverse the effect of the poisons. [[Benzodiazepines]] can be given to curb the patient's agitation, and supportive care with oxygen, hydration, and symptomatic treatment is often provided. Observation of the patient is indicated until the symptoms resolve, usually from 24–36 hours after ingestion of the ''Datura''.&lt;ref name="SS1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bliss | first = M. | title = Datura Plant Poisoning | journal = Clinical Toxicology Review | year = 2001 | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | url = http://www.maripoisoncenter.com/assets/images/pdfs/ctrs/CTR%20Datura%20Plant%20Poisoning.pdf | format = pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ethiopic Collectio Monastica''''' is a book that includes some original sayings of the [[Desert Fathers]], and which is textually independent of the more well known ''[[Apophthegmata Patrum]]'' (''Sayings of the Desert Fathers''). It was first published by Victor Arras in 1963, based on two separate manuscripts that were likely based on Greek or Coptic sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arras|first=Victor|title=Collectio monastica: Ethiopic text|year=1963|publisher=Secrétariat du CorpusSCO|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Collectio_monastica.html?id=D_A2cgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmless2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harmless, William  |year=2000 |title=Remembering Poemen Remembering: The Desert Fathers and the Spirituality of Memory |journal=Church History |publisher=American Society of Church History |volume=15 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-66380509.html}}&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection consists of sixty-eight chapter of widely different lengths. Included in the book are collections of Desert Father sayings, most of which have no parallel in the ''Apophthegmata Patrum''. The original work appears to have been written by a 5th-century monk who either lived with the Desert Fathers at [[Scetis]], or knew the monks who lived there. He also appears to have known [[Abba Poemen]], because of several unique stories and sayings attributed to him.&lt;ref name="Harmless2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harmless, William |title=Desert Christians: an introduction to the literature of early monasticism |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=Appendix 8.5|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2004|isbn=0-19-516222-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIM0pWejvBgC&amp;pg=PT504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Fanjingshan''' ({{zh|c=梵净山|p=Fànjìngshān}}) or '''Mount Fanjing''', located in [[Tongren]], [[Guizhou]] province, is the highest peak of the [[Wuling Mountains]] in southwestern China, at an elevation of {{Convert|2,570|m||abbr=on}}. The '''Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve''' was established in 1978 and designated a [[UNESCO]] Biosphere Reserve in 1986. Fanjingshan is a sacred mountain in [[Chinese Buddhism]], considered to be the [[bodhimaṇḍa]] of the [[Maitreya]] Buddha. It became a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 2018.

== Name ==
The mountain's name "Fanjing" is an abbreviation of ''Fantian Jingtu'' (梵天净土), or "Brahma's Pure Land". ''Fantian'' is the Chinese name for the [[Four Heavenly Kings|Buddhist heavenly king]] [[Brahmā (Buddhism)|Brahmā]], and ''Jingtu'' is Chinese for "[[pure land]]", the focus of [[Pure Land Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Location and environment ==
Fanjingshan is located in [[Tongren]], Guizhou Province in southwest China. It is the highest peak of the [[Wuling Mountains]]. The elevation of its terrain ranges from {{convert|480|to(-)|2,570|m|sp=us}} above sea level.&lt;ref name="MAB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/mabdb/br/brdir/directory/biores.asp?mode=all&amp;code=CPR+04|title=Biosphere Reserve Information: Fanjingshan|work=UNESCO – MAB Biosphere Reserves Directory|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1559|title=Fanjingshan|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve was established in 1978 and designated a UNESCO [[Biosphere Reserve]] in 1986.&lt;ref name="MAB" /&gt; The reserve covers a total area of {{convert|567|km2|abbr=on}} and is a conservation area for primitive vegetation of the mid sub-tropic alpine region of western China.&lt;ref name="MAB" /&gt; The mountain was designated a [[World Heritage Site]] in July 2018.&lt;ref name="WHC" /&gt;

Fanjingshan's relative isolation has ensured a high degree of biodiversity. Endemic species such as the rare [[Guizhou golden monkey]] ''(Rhinopithecus brelichi)'' and the Fanjingshan fir ''(Abies fanjingshanensis)'' occur only in a small region centering on Fanjingshan.&lt;ref name="MAB" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WHC" /&gt; Several endangered species, including the [[Chinese giant salamander]], [[forest musk deer]], and [[Reeve's pheasant]] are also found in Fanjingshan. It is also home to the largest and most contiguous subtropical primeval beech forest.&lt;ref name="WHC" /&gt;

Fanjingshan is considered a sacred mountain of [[Chinese Buddhism]],&lt;ref name="MAB" /&gt; ranking just behind the [[Four Sacred Mountains of Buddhism]]. It is considered the [[bodhimaṇḍa]] (or ''daochang'')--a spot in which one reached enlightenment--of the [[Maitreya]] Buddha.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trsmzw.gov.cn/html/2014/zongjiao_1014/52.html|title=铜仁梵净山佛教文化综述|last=|first=|date=|website=Government of Tongren|language=Chinese|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of Buddhism reached Fanjingshan by the [[Tang dynasty]] at the latest, especially after Hou Hongren (侯弘仁) constructed the Zangke Road (牂牁道) in 639 AD, which facilitated transport in the mountainous region, and local gazettes record the construction of several temples in the area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; More temples were built during the ensuing [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] dynasties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Buddhism greatly prospered during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, when the cult of Tianguan Maitreya (天冠弥勒) became dominant in Fanjingshan. The [[Bozhou rebellion]] in the late 16th century caused great damages to Fanjingshan's temples. After suppressing the rebellion, the [[Wanli Emperor]] ordered the monk Miaoxuan (妙玄) to rebuild the Golden Peak of Fanjingshan and the Cheng'en Temple (承恩寺), and many other temples were constructed in the area, ushering in the golden era for Buddhism in Fanjingshan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Most temples during the Ming and Qing dynasties belonged to the [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] and the [[Linji school|Linji]] sects of Buddhism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the turmoil that toppled the Qing dynasty, many temples were destroyed by marauding armies and bandits, and few monks remained in the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] era.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After further destructions during the [[Cultural Revolution]], Buddhism has enjoyed a renaissance since the 1980s. Many old temples have been rebuilt and new ones constructed, including the Cheng'en Temple, Huguo Chan Temple (护国禅寺), Great Golden Buddha Temple (大金佛寺), and Longquan Temple (龙泉寺).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2010, the Fanjingshan Buddhist Cultural Park was opened, with a Golden Hall that houses a five-meter-tall statue of the [[Maitreya]] Buddha made with {{convert|250|kg}} of gold and thousands of gems.

{{COI|date=July 2016}}
'''Festive ecology''' explores the relationships between the [[symbol]]ism and the [[ecology]] of the [[plant]]s, [[fungi]] and [[animal]]s associated with cultural events such as [[festivals]], [[processions]], and special occasions.  Examples of topics are given below.

==Christmas==
The plants traditionally associated with [[Christmas]] – [[holly]], [[ivy]], [[mistletoe]], [[common yew]] - have had special roles in earlier religions and past cultures.  Some early religions in [[Europe]] had midwinter festivals to celebrate the return of the sun from the shortest day.  In the 4th and 5th centuries, 25 December was gradually adopted as the date for Christmas in Europe in order to superimpose on the existing mid-winter festivals.  The [[winter solstice]] in the Northern Hemisphere, on what is now 17 December, was the start of the Roman festival of [[Saturnalia]].  This was a week of public feasting, dancing, singing and gambling.  Houses were decorated with evergreens and bunches of holly were given as tokens of friendship.  When this festival was absorbed into the Christian calendar, holly and the other evergreens were absorbed as well.

===Holly===
Holly is palatable to livestock despite its spines and was extensively used as a winter fodder for livestock in medieval times in England and Wales, particularly in [[Cumbria]], the [[Pennines]] and the [[Welsh borders]].&lt;ref name=Spray&gt;Spray, M (1981). Holly as a fodder in England. ''Agricultural History Review'' '''29''', 97-110.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hay and grains for wintering stock would often have run short in these upland areas.  This would mean that the livestock would eventually have to be slaughtered, causing real problems to medieval economies in the following years.  Thus, a supply of fresh browse would have been extremely valuable.  Written records of payments and agreements involving the use of holly for livestock cover a wide period from the late 12th century to the mid-18th century, by which time the practice had been largely abandoned.&lt;ref name=Spray/&gt;  An early reference to the practice occurs in “[[The Dream of Rhonabwy]]”, a Welsh story from the [[Mabinogion]],  a remarkable collection of medieval literature.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gwyn &amp; Jones, Thomas (1949). ''The Mabinogion''.  Revised edition 1989. JM Dent &amp; Sons, London.&lt;/ref&gt;  Written before the 14th century, The Dream of Rhonabwy refers to the mid-12th century in [[Powys]].  The floor of the old black house of Heilyn Goch is described as being covered in the urine and dung of cows together with branches of holly whose tips had been eaten by the cattle.

===Ivy===
Ivy was used in garlands by the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] for religious ceremonies and for celebrating at other, more secular, occasions.  It was strongly associated with Bacchus ([[Dionysus]]), the Greco-Roman god of [[wine]].  Since Roman times, ivy has been associated with wine and wine-making.  Branches of evergreen ivy tied to a pole was often used as the “sign of the bush” indicating a place where wine or alcohol was for sale.  Hence, the proverb “Good wine needs no bush” meaning that it is not necessary to advertise well-made goods.  Ivy is less commonly seen in houses in Britain at Christmas compared to holly and mistletoe and it may be that established religions opposed its use in Christmas wreaths because of its association with drunkenness.

===Mistletoe===
[[File:Cutting the mistletoe (4541052376).jpg|thumb|left|Cuttting the Mistletoe in [[Builth Wells]] (1909]]

Mistletoe is an evergreen plant well known for its association with [[oak]] trees and [[Druids]] first documented by [[Pliny the Elder]] who wrote about the ceremonies of the [[Celt]]ic Druids in [[Gaul]] in his ''[[Naturalis]] Historia''.&lt;ref&gt;Rackham, H (1952). ''Pliny: Natural History'', Book XVI, para xcv. Heinemann, London.&lt;/ref&gt;  These Druids held the oak in particular veneration, used oak leaves in their ceremonies, and regarded anything growing on oak trees as having been sent from heaven.  On the rare occasions when mistletoe was found growing on an oak, it would be gathered with great ceremony.  A priest in white clothing would cut the mistletoe with a golden sickle and allow it to fall onto a white cloak; two white bulls would then be sacrificed.  According to Pliny, it was believed that mistletoe in a drink would make any barren animal fertile and that it was a remedy for all poisons.  Special powers are attributed to mistletoe by a wide range of cultures, both within Europe and further afield.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, J G (1922). ''The Golden Bough''. Macmillan, London.&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of mistletoe as an all-heal and a cure for barrenness is reputed to have a very ancient history.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, R (1955). ''The Greek Myths''. Penguin, Harmondsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;  The link between mistletoe and fertility persists to this day in Britain in the tradition of kissing underneath bunches of mistletoe at Christmas.  In the early 19th century, it was traditional for each man who kissed under the mistletoe to remove one berry.  Once all the berries are gone, so is the potency.

===Yew Trees===
Yew trees continually put out new stems which coalesce with the existing trunk resulting in trees of great age.  The merging of old and decaying wood with vibrant young shoots has led to the yew being traditionally associated with [[reincarnation]] and [[immortality]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornish, V (1946). ''The Churchyard Yew and Immortality''. Frederick Muller, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dressing the Arbor Tree, Aston-on-Clun, Shropshire, England==
[[File:Arbour tree, Aston on Clun (1293722).jpg|thumb|Arbour tree, [[Aston on Clun]], 1920's]]
The custom of dressing the Arbor tree – a [[black poplar]] growing in [[Aston-on-Clun]] in south Shropshire – with flags on flagpoles every 29 May is almost unique in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;Box, John (2003). Dressing the Arbor tree.  ''Folklore'' '''114''', 13-28.&lt;/ref&gt; although "[[Appleton_Thorn#Bawming_the_Thorn|Bawming the Thorn]]" at [[Appleton Thorn]] in [[Cheshire]] is not dissimilar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/customdetail.php?id=19|title=British Folk Customs, Bawming the thorn, Cheshire|author=|date=|website=www.information-britain.co.uk|accessdate=1 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New flags are attached to wooden flagpoles on the Arbor tree which remain throughout the year.  

The Arbor tree is a male black poplar tree growing beside a stream at a place where four roads meet.  Written records of the Arbor tree only extend back to 1898, but the tradition of dressing the tree is reputed to date back to a local wedding in 1786.  The custom has developed and acquired new meanings, particularly since the 1955 when a pageant was devised.  The pageant and the celebrations associated with the tree dressing are evolving in response to those living in the local community as well as to the external recognition now accorded to this unique tradition. 

The present black poplar grew from a rooted cutting taken from the old tree which was said to be at least 300 years old when it collapsed in 1995 and had been repeatedly pollarded.  Black poplar is an extremely unusual tree to be associated with notable events or traditions, which are more likely to involve [[pedunculate oak]], [[sessile oak]], common yew or hawthorn (''[[Crataegus]]'').

The black poplar (''Populus nigra'' var. ''betulifolia'') is an uncommon native tree in Britain.  Black poplars are associated with alluvial soils in river valleys and floodplains generally south of a line from the [[River Mersey]] to the estuary of the [[Humber]] with particular concentrations across the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] from the [[Welsh Marches]] to [[East Anglia]] and notably in the Vale of Aylesbury ([[Aylesbury Vale]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mabey, Richard (1996).  ''Flora Britannica''. [[Sinclair-Stevenson]], London.&lt;/ref&gt;  A male clone ([[cloning]]) was much planted in the suburbs of [[Manchester]] in the late 18th century as it grew well in the polluted atmosphere and it became known as the ‘Manchester poplar’.  Growing to a height of some 30&amp;nbsp;metres, the bark of the black poplar is distinctively ridged and furrowed and has characteristic large burrs or bosses.  When mature, the tree forms a huge dome of massive spreading branches which arch outwards.  This spreading habit is dramatically different from the elongated shape of the Lombardy poplar (''Populus nigra'' ‘Italica’) which, surprisingly, is a cultivated variety of the black poplar that was imported to [[Essex]] from [[Turin]] in 1758 and widely planted because of its unusual shape.  The black poplar is also a different species from the more widespread black Italian poplar (''Populus'' x&amp;nbsp;''euramericana'' or ''Populus'' x&amp;nbsp;''canadensi''s) which is a hybrid between the black poplar and the North American eastern cottonwood (''[[Populus deltoides]]'').

Poplars are unusual in that there are separate male and female trees.  Male black poplars are far more numerous than female trees in Britain and seedlings are, therefore, very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Redhead, Edgar (1990).  The BSBI black poplar survey, 1973-88.  ''Watsonia'' '''18''', 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Regrowth occurs from the branches or trunk of fallen trees which root into the underlying soil.  Growing in river valleys and floodplains, the trees can be uprooted by floods and grow again in a new location.

==Other==
Accounts of other traditional customs on 29 May are usually linked to Royal Oak Day ([[Oak Apple Day]]) and include the surviving customary rights in [[Grovely Wood]] at [[Great Wishford]], [[Wiltshire]], and [[Castleton Garland Day|Garland King Day]] at [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]] (Derbyshire).

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Graecus''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|r|iː|k|ə|s}} ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Γραικός}}) was the son of [[Pandora II]] and [[Zeus]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' fr. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother [[Pandora II]] (named after her grandmother [[Pandora]]) was the daughter of [[Deucalion]] and [[Pyrrha]] and sister of [[Hellen]] who together with his three sons [[Dorus]], [[Xuthus]] (with his sons [[Ion (mythology)|Ion]] and [[Achaeus, son of Xuthus|Achaeus]]) and [[Aeolus (son of Hellen)|Aeolus]], comprised the set of ancient tribes that formed the [[Greece|Greek]]/[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] nation.

==Later traditions==
According to [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], Graecus was a son of [[Thessalus]]. According  to [[Virgil]], [[Latinus]] is Graecus's brother. The [[Graecians]], a Hellenic tribe, took their name from Graecus, according to legend. They were one of the first Greek tribes to colonise [[Italy]]. The area that came to be known as [[Magna Graecia]] then took its name after them. The [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] used the term in reference to all [[Ancient Greeks|Hellenic]] people because the first [[Greeks|Hellenes]] they came into contact with were the Graecians.

Marsh was born in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], Somerset. He was educated at [[Sherborne School]] and [[New College, Oxford|New College]], Oxford.&lt;ref name="sailor site"/&gt;

==Career==
Marsh's first group was at school; [[Jeremy Irons]] was the drummer.&lt;ref name=who/&gt;
After Oxford, Marsh joined a group with, among others, [[John G. Perry]], at first called Toast, which expanded to become Gringo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Gringo web-site

|accessdate=23 Jan 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was invited in 1973 by [[Phil Pickett]] to join a group called 
Kajanus Pickett, after Pickett and [[Georg Kajanus]]. The group became [[Sailor (band)|Sailor]] with the inclusion of [[Grant Serpell]]. Sailor's original line-up split up in 1978,&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p20322/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Sailor |author=Thompson, Dave |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Pickett and Marsh released more material as Sailor with Gavin and Virginia David in 1980, with an album of Pickett compositions called ''Dressed for Drowning''.

After Sailor disbanded, he worked with Kajanus on [[DATA (band)|DATA]] and "And The Mamluks", a short-lived electronic-music project. Marsh eventually teamed up with writer [[Barry Mason]] in 1986. They and David H. Bell, a Broadway director, wrote a musical called ''Malibu'', first performed in 1991. He wrote another musical, ''Casper—The Musical'', with Pickett in 1999. Marsh has written musical scores for theatre productions including ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' and ''[[The Dark at the Top of the Stairs]]''. He received the [[Joseph Jefferson Award]] for Best Original Music in Theater Production in 1998 for ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'',&lt;ref name=who/&gt; and in 1999 for ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

His musical theatre work in the USA includes ''One Last Summer'', ''In Stitches'' and ''Female Problems'' for which he received a nomination for Best New Work. His musical theatre work in the UK includes ''The Mask'', ''Spider-Man'' and ''Casper''. Marsh has composed numerous scores for television. These include ''[[Eye of the Storm (TV series)|Eye of the Storm]]'' (ITV drama), ''Pirates'' (BBC drama), ''[[Blockbusters (UK game show)|Blockbusters]]'', ''[[Strike It Lucky|Strike It Rich]]'', ''Black Date'' (Channel 4), ''[[Win, Lose or Draw (UK game show)|Win Lose Or Draw]]'' (Granada Television), ''The Fastest Man On Earth'' (ITV and Discovery Channel) and ''[[House Invaders (TV series)|House Invaders]]'' (BBC). His library music has been used worldwide for film and television, including ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'', ''Private Parts (the movie)'', ''[[Father Ted]]'', ''[[Home and Away]]'', ''[[Peak Practice]]'' and many others.&lt;ref name="sailor site"/&gt; He composed the music for the film ''SON of Nosferatu'' (2011).&lt;ref name="imdb"/&gt;

In 1989 Sailor reformed with Marsh.&lt;ref name="AMG"/&gt; He left in 1999 but returned in 2005. Marsh's sons, Oliver and Thomas, have also performed with the band in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Hermetic Brotherhood of Light''' was a Fraternity that descended from the [[Fratres Lucis]] in the late 18th century (in turn, derived from the German [[Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross]]), and was the seed from which [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (O.T.O.) ('Order of the Temple of the East' or 'Order of Oriental Templars') was created. 

[[Carl Kellner (mystic)|Carl Kellner]] and [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] were members of the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light. In [[Theodor Reuss]]' 1917 O.T.O. Constitution, it states in Article 1, Section 1:
:''Under the style and title: ANCIENT ORDER OF ORIENTAL TEMPLARS, an organization, formerly known as: "The Hermetic Brotherhood of Light", has been reorganized and reconstituted. This reconstituted association is an international organization, and is hereinafter referred to as the O.T.O.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3616">'''Hisbah''' ({{lang-ar|حسبة}} ''ḥisbah'') is an [[Islam]]ic doctrine which means "accountability".&lt;ref name=sz&gt;Sami Zubaida (2005), Law and Power in the Islamic World, {{ISBN|978-1850439349}}, pages 58-60&lt;/ref&gt; Hisbah is the divinely-sanctioned duty of the ruler (government) to intervene and coercively "[[enjoining good and forbidding wrong]]" in order to keep everything in order according to [[sharia]] (Islamic law).&lt;ref name=lv&gt;Lorenzo Vidino (2013), [http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/Hisba_in_Europe.pdf Hisba in Europe?], European Foundation for Democracy, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is based on an expression from the [[Quran]] ({{lang|ar|الأمر بالمَعْرُوف والنَهي عن المُنْكَر}}).&lt;ref name=sz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]]: ''Commanding right and forbidding wrong in Islamic thought.'' Cambridge University Press. Cambridge 2000. {{ISBN|0-521-66174-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2016}} Clear procedures are required to be followed in order to enact punishment under sharia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lettertobaghdadi.com/ Open Letter to Al-Baghdadi] Accessed 16 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; however [[Al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya]] (considered a terrorist organization) suggests that it is the sacred duty of all Muslims, not just rulers.&lt;ref name=lv/&gt;

==Description==
The Hisbah has the following major aspects:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Cook (2003), ''Forbidding Wrong in Islam.'' Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-82913-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An obligation of a [[Muslim]].
*An obligation of a state to ensure its citizens comply with ''hisbah'' such as [[sharia]].
*In a broader sense, ''hisbah'' also refers to the practice of supervision of commercial, guild, and other secular affairs. Traditionally, a [[muhtasib]] (al-Muhtasib) was appointed by the [[caliph]] to oversee the order in marketplaces, in businesses, in medical occupations, etc. The position of muhtasib may be approximately rendered as "[[inspector]]". See [[Hisbah (business accountability)]] for this aspect.

For example, in [[Saudi Arabia]], the state establishment responsible for ''hisbah'' is the [[Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Saudi Arabia)|Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice]], or Hai'a.&lt;ref&gt;Sherifa Zuhur (2012), Saudi Arabia, {{ISBN|978-1598845716}}, pages 431-432&lt;/ref&gt;

In a minority of Islamic states, namely Saudi Arabia, Sudan, the Aceh province of Indonesia and Iran, there is an establishment of [[Islamic religious police]]. In some places, it is state-established; in others, it is independent of the state.

Hisbah doctrine has been invoked by Islamic prosecutors in cases of apostasy and acts of [[blasphemy]]. For example, in [[Egypt]], [[Nasr Abu Zayd]], a Muslim scholar "critical of old and modern Islamic thought" was prosecuted under the doctrine when his academic work was held to be evidence of [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Berger, Apostasy and Public Policy in Contemporary Egypt: An Evaluation of Recent Cases from Egypt's Highest Courts, Human Rights Quarterly, Volume 25, Number 3, August 2003, pages 720-740&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olsson, S. (2008), Apostasy in Egypt: Contemporary Cases of Ḥisbah. The Muslim World, 98(1): 95-115&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeanne Tripier''' (1869–1944) was a French [[Mediumship|medium]]&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Women Artists"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaze|first1=Delia ed.|title=Dictionary of Women Artists: Artists, J-Z|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0316589063|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; who produced works of text, drawing and embroidery under [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] influence. She is considered part of the [[Outsider  art|Art Brut]] canon.&lt;ref name="Wertkin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wertkin|first1=Gerard C. ed.|title=Encyclopedia of American Folk Art|year=2004|publisher=Routledge.|isbn=0-415-92986-5|page=400}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Life==

Jeanne Tripier was born in 1869 in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Maclagan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maclagan|first1=David|title=Outsider Art: From the Margins to the Marketplace|year=2009|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1861895219|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daughter of a wine merchant, she spent her childhood in the country with her grandmother.&lt;ref name="ABCD"&gt;{{cite web|title=TRIPIER jeanne|url=http://abcd-artbrut.net/collection/tripier-jeanne/|publisher=Art Brut Collection ABCD|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an adult she lived in the Montmartre district of Paris, working as a salesgirl at a department store. At 58 she developed a passion for [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] doctrines and divination. These activities became central to her existence, so much so that she eventually stopped going to work. In 1934 she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Paris.&lt;ref name="Collection de l'art Brut Lausanne"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tripier, Jeanne|url=http://www.artbrut.ch/fr/21004/1030/tripier--jeanne|publisher=Collection de l'art Brut Lausanne|accessdate=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Jeanne Tripier began creating works which blended image and text when she was in her 50s.  Tripier's work emerged during trance states&lt;ref name="Spiritualist Art"&gt;{{cite work|title=Spiritualist Art|publisher=Collection de l'Art Brut Lausanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; and utilized materials such as sugar and hair dye.&lt;ref name="Frieze"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zion|first1=Amy|title=Art Brut in America &amp; Unorthodox|url=https://frieze.com/article/art-brut-america-unorthodox|publisher=Frieze|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also produced figurative embroidery pieces. She ascribed responsibility for her output of texts, drawings, and embroideries to spiritual entities.&lt;ref name="Line Let Loose"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maclagan|first1=David|title=Line Let Loose: Scribbling, Doodling and Automatic Drawing|year=2014|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=1780230826|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harold Lawrence "Larry" Lea''' (born January 30, 1951) is a pastor and [[televangelist]] in [[Rockwall, Texas|Rockwall]], Texas.

==Early years==
He attended and graduated from [[Dallas Baptist University]] where he met his first wife, Melva.  He completed his graduate work at [[Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary]] in Fort Worth.&lt;ref name="evangelicalism333"&gt;Randall Herbert Balmer, ''Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism'', p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; Larry and Melva married in 1972, and together they have 3 children.&lt;ref name="wifeinterview"/&gt; He became the youth pastor of '''Beverly Hills Baptist Church''' in Dallas, where the youth department shot up from 40 to 1,000. While pastoring [[Church on the Rock]] in Rockwall, Texas, He also served as  Dean of Theological and Spiritual Affairs at [[Oral Roberts University]].&lt;ref name="evangelicalism333"/&gt;

==Church on the Rock==
Following a stint as an itinerant preacher in the late 1970s, Lea was invited to pastor Church on the Rock in 1980 with 12 people in [[Rockwall, Texas|Rockwall]], Texas, a suburb of Dallas. Within 5 years, the congregation had increased to over 5,000. In 1986, Lea began to travel again, holding what he called "Prayer Clinics" and later, "Prayer Rallies" or "Prayer Breakthroughs". Also, that year marked the beginning of Lea's television program, called ''Change Your Life''. Also, that year, Lea released his first book, the best-seller&lt;ref&gt;http://www.powells.com/biblio?show=TRADE%20PAPER:USED:9780884192107:6.50&lt;/ref&gt; ''Could You Not Tarry One Hour?'', which was his teaching on [[The Lord's Prayer]]. He also began a partnership group where his partners were referred to as "[[prayer warrior|Prayer Warriors]]".

In June 1990, Lea stepped aside as pastor to oversee Church on the Rock, which was a group of churches that was called a "virtual denomination" according to ''[[Christianity Today]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kim lawton, "Broadcasters face ethics questions - again," ''Christianity Today'', January 13, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; (The successor of this organization, still named COTRI, is led by former Church on the Rock assistant pastor Dr. Lawrence Kennedy. Under Lea COTRI had 45 churches nationwide; now the number includes over 350 in the U.S.{{Citation needed|reason=Cotri.org does not appear to specify this number.|date=August 2010}} and thousands worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://cotri.org/content.asp?menuid=About%20Us&amp;Contentid=Overview&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Controversies==
Lea found himself in some controversy later that year, when Lea and several ministers met at the [[Bill Graham Civic Auditorium|Civic Auditorium]] in [[San Francisco]]. Lea's ministry was heavily criticized by an assortment of gay-rights activists, pro-choice activists, and [[Wiccans]] led by Eric Pryor (who later converted to Christianity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/news/22317-wiccan-turned-bible-teacher-eric-pryor-dies?&lt;/ref&gt;). On Halloween (the first night of the crusade), there was a massive protest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toobeautiful.org/chron_901101.html |title=San Francisco Chronicle, 1 November 1990: 6,500 Christians Attend S.F. 'Exorcism' |publisher=Toobeautiful.org |date=1990-11-01 |accessdate=2010-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to many who came to the Civic Auditorium having to come through a very hostile crowd outside and concerns about potential violence forced Lea to drop plans for 5,000 attendees to conduct a [[Prayer walk|prayer march]] through the city's streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Mark A.|title=He Came, Saw but Couldn't Conquer : San Francisco: An evangelist and his 'prayer warriors' are met by 1,500 demonstrators on Halloween.

A year later, ABC's ''[[Primetime (U.S. TV program)|PrimeTime Live]]'' aired an exposé involving Lea and fellow Dallas-area televangelists [[W.V. Grant]] and [[Robert Tilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/DM/lib00377,0ED56291649D24AC.html | title=Judgment Day on `Prime Time Live' |publisher=[[Dallas Morning News]] | date=November 21, 1991 | first= Ed| last= Bark| accessdate = 2007-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident involving Lea came as a result of his fundraising appeals, questions as to how much money was going to mentioned projects (specifically a program involving helping start churches in [[Poland]]),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Susan Lockamy, "Ethics Panel Exonerates Lea," ''Charisma'', July 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and accusations that Lea implied a fire at one of his homes left his family almost destitute even though they still had a five-million-dollar home in the Dallas area.

==Aftermath==
Lea's organization had grown so quickly, he made the decision to allow the [[National Religious Broadcasters]] financial integrity arm, EFICOM (Ethics and Financial Integrity Commission), to audit his ministry to look into the charges.&lt;ref name="wifeinterview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.charismamag.com/index.php/features2/346-special-interview/5257-a-journey-toward-healing?format=pdf | title=Judgment A Journey Toward Healing |publisher=[[Charisma magazine]] | year=2002| first= | last= | accessdate = 2007-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; While EFICOM would determine he had been delinquent in sending his financial information, the group determined that Lea had not misused the funds for the Poland project. The EFICOM committee also accused [[ABC News]] of misleading Lea about the interview's purpose and ignoring "significant facts"; such as signed affidavits from Polish church officials that would have confirmed Lea's claims.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; By May 1992 (after ending his ''Change Your Life'' broadcasts the previous December after the expose), Lea would make a return to the airwaves with a show titled ''America, Let's Pray''.

His credibility and prominence in the charismatic community evaporated (though not as quickly as Tilton's), as he traveled with [[Morris Cerullo]] at the latter's crusades in the mid-1990s. Lea also claimed that he suffered a relapse of bipolar disorder.&lt;ref name="wifeinterview"/&gt; In 1994, he took a position as a pastor in [[San Diego]]. This lasted until 1997.

After 27 years of marriage, Larry filed for divorce in April 1999.&lt;ref name="wifeinterview"/&gt; During the divorce, his wife attended [[Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref name="wifeinterview"/&gt; Lea's son John started the '''Life Church''' in [[Rockwall, Texas|Rockwall]], Texas in the same Dallas suburb where Larry and his ex-wife began Church on the Rock in 1980.&lt;ref name="wifeinterview"/&gt; Lea has since remarried and has returned to the Rockwall area.&lt;ref name="wifeinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.larryleaministries.net/larryleanakedtruth.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412034906/http://www.larryleaministries.net/larryleanakedtruth.html |archivedate=2010-04-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church on the Rock main campus was later sold to '''Lake Pointe Baptist Church''', a [[Southern Baptist]] [[megachurch]] in the Rockwall area which relocated to the site and renamed itself '''Lake Pointe Church'''; while the church itself moved to the nearby [[Rowlett, Texas|Rowlett]] area and was renamed Church in the City in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://citcchurch.org/index.php/welcome-page/about-citc/our-pastors |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826164631/http://citcchurch.org/index.php/welcome-page/about-citc/our-pastors |archivedate=2013-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Limmud''' is a [[British Jews|British-Jewish]] educational charity&lt;ref name="Charity"/&gt; which, in the UK, produces a large annual winter festival and several other regional events throughout the year on the theme of Jewish learning. Limmud is not affiliated to any strand of Judaism and markets itself as open to "anyone interested in Jewish learning".

Limmud (from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word meaning "to learn")&lt;ref name="Jeffay"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2008/dec/16/limmud | title='It's more academic than academia' | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=16 December 2008 | accessdate=7 January 2014 | author=Jeffay, Nathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; was originally a conference for "educators",&lt;ref name="Jeffay"/&gt; basing itself on [[CAJE]], the Conference on Alternatives in Jewish Education of North America,&lt;ref name="Falk interview"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/122247/the-man-leading-front-class | title=The man leading from the front of the class  | work=''Interview with Alastair Falk in'' [[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=5 September 2014 | accessdate=5 September 2014 | author=Oliver, Charlotte}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed in 1976.  From CAJE, it took a volunteer ethos, not paying presenters, and not using people's titles.  During the 1990s there was the significant change as Limmud reinvented itself as a community gathering, giving rise to a significant increase in the number of attendees and leading it to be described as "British Jewry's greatest export".&lt;ref name="Export"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/all-jewish-all-the-time-1.335748 | title=All Jewish, all the time | work=[[Haaretz]] | date=7 January 2011 | accessdate=14 January 2014 | author=Harman, Danna}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Limmud model has now spread to many other countries.&lt;ref name="Charity"/&gt;

A distinctive feature of Limmud is that the events are organised by volunteers,&lt;ref name=" Kustanowitz "&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.haaretz.com/misc/iphone-article/.premium-1.557408 | title=Seven ways to disrupt a Jewish conference | work=[[Haaretz]] | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=14 January 2014 | author=Kustanowitz, Esther D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tulane"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tulane.edu/news/newwave/030810_limmud_fest.cfm |title=‘Volunticipants’ Needed for Jewish Fest |publisher=[[Tulane University]] |work=New Wave |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116085307/https://tulane.edu/news/newwave/030810_limmud_fest.cfm |archivedate=16 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who also take part as equals in what is now called the Limmud Festival.&lt;ref name="Export"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisner"/&gt;  Limmud's largest group of volunteers are in their 20s and 30s.&lt;ref name="Eisner"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://forward.com/articles/190369/what-limmud-can-teach-us/ | title=What Limmud Can Teach Us | work=[[The Forward]] | date=7 January 2014 | accessdate=14 January 2014 | author=Eisner, Jane | location=[[New York City|New York]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around half of the UK "Forty under 40" (a community-wide initiative to identify the future leaders of British Jewry, published by ''[[The Jewish News (newspaper)|The Jewish News]]'') have volunteered for Limmud and a former Chair of Limmud, Elliott Goldstein, topped the list.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.totallyjewish.com/news/elliott-is-number-one/ | title=Elliott is number one | work=[[The Jewish News (newspaper)|The Jewish News]] | date=17 June 2010 | accessdate=7 January 2014 | author=Marin, James | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==

Limmud is a company and a charity. It is run by a board of directors and trustees, all of whom are volunteers. Initially, there was no difference between Limmud the organisation and Limmud Conference, the annual event, so the chairs of the Conference/Festival team were the chairs of the organisation. In 1990, a chair for the organisation who was separate from the Conference chairs was appointed for the first time. In 2006, [[Limmud International]] was created, as a separate unit within Limmud to manage relationships with other Limmud groups around the world. Limmud International was absorbed back into Limmud at the end of 2016.

Limmud's first professional appointment in 1998 was of [[Clive Lawton]] as part-time Executive Director; he gradually became backed by a full-time administrator.   In 2006 Limmud recruited its first full-time Executive Director, [[Raymond Simonson]], former Director of UJIA Makor: The Centre for Informal Jewish Education.&lt;ref name="Simonson"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/70784/limmud-leader-simonson-heads-jcc | title=Limmud leader Simonson heads for the JCC | work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=2 August 2012 | accessdate=7 January 2014 | author=Lipman, Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Simonson became Chief Executive of London's Jewish Community Centre,&lt;ref name="Simonson" /&gt; now [[JW3]], in 2012, he was succeeded by Shelley Marsh.&lt;ref name="Marsh"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/community/community-life/84699/limmud-picks-shelley-marsh-top-job | title=Limmud picks Shelley Marsh for top job | work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=4 October 2012 | accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She stepped down from the role in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/132571/limmud-director-steps-down | title=Limmud director steps down | work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=25 March 2015 | accessdate=27 March 2015 | author=Doherty, Rosa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Schindler was the Limmud Director of Operations and the senior professional in the organisation between March and August 2015,&lt;ref name="Structure"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://limmud.org/volunteers/structure/ |title=Limmud the organisation&amp;nbsp;– who's who |publisher=Limmud |accessdate=2 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203174601/http://limmud.org/volunteers/structure/ |archivedate= 3 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then Dani Serlin was Acting Executive Director until February 2016.

===Limmud Festival===
'''Limmud Festival''' (until 2017 known as '''Limmud Conference'''),  takes place every year in the last week of December&lt;ref name=" Kahn-Harris"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/dec/29/limmud-conference-jewish | title=Limmud: a great Jewish alternative to Christmas | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=29 December 2010 | accessdate=7 January 2014 | author=[[Keith Kahn-Harris|Kahn-Harris, Keith]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the organisation's [[flagship]] event.

===Limmud summer events===
Limmud held a summer event in the last week of August which was called Limmud Fest from 2004 to 2012 and Limmud in the Woods from 2013 to 2016.&lt;ref name="Sheinman"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/110132/limmud-goes-camping-woods | title=Limmud goes camping in the Woods | work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=11 August 2013 | accessdate=7 January 2014 | author=Sheinman, Anna}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involved camping as well as staying indoors,&lt;ref name="Sheinman"/&gt; had a less intense programme centred on [[Shabbat]] and is more cultural and outdoors-focused than its winter sibling. Limmud Fest had a peak attendance of 650 people; Limmud in the Woods was attended by around 200–250 young adults and young families.&lt;ref name="Sheinman"/&gt;

===Day and weekend Limmud events===

==Relationships with Orthodoxy in Britain==
The former London [[United Synagogue]] [[Beth Din]]'s Head [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]], [[Chanoch Ehrentreu]], advised Orthodox rabbis not to attend Limmud Conference.&lt;ref name="Lebens"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/the-jewish-thinker/.premium-1.553846 | title=Why Orthodox rabbis shouldn’t boycott Limmud | work=[[Haaretz]] | date=22 October 2013 | accessdate=14 January 2014 | author=Lebens, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the UK many United Synagogue pulpit rabbis have attended Limmud. In December 2010 Rabbi [[Yitzchak Schochet]] of Mill Hill United Synagogue, who had been seen as a notable absentee and critic of Limmud, attended, took part in and taught at Limmud's 30th annual Conference. Following this he wrote on the synagogue's website: "''upon return all I could ask myself was, 'where was I until now?'''" &lt;ref name="Schochet"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shul.co.uk/readArticle.php?article=301 | title=When Lightning Didn’t Strike | publisher=Mill Hill, United Synagogue | work=Rabbi's Blog | date=3 January 2011 | accessdate=7 January 2014 | author=[[Yitzchak Schochet|Schochet, Yitzchak]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Sacks]] did not attend Limmud whilst being Chief Rabbi but attended when he was the head of [[Jews College]].  Sacks, when looking back on his rabbinate, considers Limmud to be one of the great successes of his time.&lt;ref name="Big Think"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-lord-rabbi-jonathan-sacks | title=Big Think Interview With Lord Rabbi Jonathan Sacks | publisher=Big Think | date=12 July 2010 | accessdate=7 January 2014 | author=Liebman, Jessica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy erupted again in 2013 when newly elected Chief Rabbi [[Ephraim Mirvis]] announced his decision to attend.&lt;ref name="Lebens"/&gt; Subsequently, a public notice signed by seven leading Orthodox rabbis including Dayan [[Chanoch Ehrentreu]] and Rabbi [[Avrohom Gurwicz]] and published in the ''[[Jewish Tribune (UK)|Jewish Tribune]]'',  attacked pluralism and urged "God-fearing Jews" not to participate in Limmud.&lt;ref name="Lebens"/&gt; This sparked condemnation by non-[[Charedi]] communal leaders, with [[Jewish Leadership Council]] chairman [[Mick Davis]], [[Board of Deputies]] president [[Vivian Wineman]] and United Synagogue president Stephen Pack writing to ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' saying that the statement showed "a shocking failure of leadership".&lt;ref name="Backlash"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/112475/limmud-backlash-over-visit-chief | title=Limmud backlash over visit by Chief | work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=17 October 2013 | accessdate=7 January 2014 | author=Rocker, Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Jewish Chronicle'' itself described the statement as "crass, ill-judged and ultimately self-defeating".&lt;ref name="Silence"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/leader/112494/chief-rabbi-mirviss-dignified-silence | title=Chief Rabbi Mirvis's dignified silence | work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=17 October 2013 | accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirvis's attendance at the 2013 Limmud Conference was well received by fellow participants.&lt;ref name="Mirvis"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishtelegraph.com/limmud_2.html | title=Mirvis: Great to be Jewish at Limmud | work=[[Jewish Telegraph]] | year=2013 | accessdate=14 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least nine other United Synagogue rabbis also attended the event.&lt;ref name="US rabbis"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thejc.com/node/114428 | title=We’ll be there again next year, say US rabbis | work=[[The Jewish Chronicle]] | date=2 January 2014 | accessdate=14 January 2014 | author=Rocker, Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohammed Marwa''' (died 1980), best known by his nickname '''Maitatsine''' (and less commonly, as ''AllahTatsine''), was a controversial preacher in [[Nigeria]]. ''Maitatsine'' is a [[Hausa language|Hausa]] word meaning "the one who damns" and refers to his curse-laden public speeches against the Nigerian state.&lt;ref name=adesoji&gt;{{cite journal | title = Between Maitatsine and Boko Haram: Islamic Fundamentalism and the Response of the Nigerian State | journal = Africa Today | date = Summer 2011 | first = Abimbola | last = Adesoji | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 98–119, 136| id = | url = http://search.proquest.com/docview/883393210?accountid=10475 | accessdate = 2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
He was originally from [[Maroua|Marwa]] in northern [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref name=Lubeck&gt;{{cite journal|title=Islamic Protest under Semi-Industrial Capitalism: 'Yan Tatsine Explained|author=Paul M. Lubeck|journal=Africa: Journal of the International African Institute |volume=55 |issue=4 |year=1985 |pages=369–389 |jstor=1160172}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his education he moved to [[Kano, Nigeria]] in about 1945, where he became known for his controversial preachings on the [[Qur'an]].  Although a Koranic scholar, he seemingly rejected the [[hadith]] and the [[sunnah]] and regarded the reading of any other book but the Koran as [[paganism]].  Maitatsine spoke against the use of radios, watches, bicycles, cars and the possession of more money than necessary.&lt;ref name='kastfelt1989'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Rumours of Maitatsine: A Note on Political Culture in Northern Nigeria | journal = African Affairs | year = 1989 | first = Niels | last = Kastfelt | volume = 88 | issue = 350 | pages = 83–90 | url = http://afraf.oxfordjournals.org/content/88/350/83.extract | accessdate = 2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='pham'/&gt;  

The British [[Colonial Nigeria|colonial authorities]] sent him into [[exile]], but he returned to Kano shortly after [[Nigerian Independence|independence]]. By 1972 he had a notable and increasingly militant following known as ''[[Yan Tatsine]]''.&lt;ref name='pham'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worlddefensereview.com/pham101906.shtml |title=In Nigeria False Prophets Are Real Problems |accessdate=2011-11-21 |last=Pham |first=J.

His preaching attracted largely a following of youths, unemployed migrants, and those who felt that mainstream Muslim teachers were not doing enough for their communities.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  By December 1980, continued Yan Tatsine attacks on other religious figures and police forced the Nigerian army to become involved.  Subsequent armed clashes led to the deaths of around 5,000 people, including Maitatsine himself.&lt;ref name='pham'/&gt;  Maitatsine died shortly after sustaining injuries in the clashes either from his wounds or from a heart attack.&lt;ref name='hiskett'&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Maitatsine Riots in Kano, 1980: An Assessment | journal = Journal of Religion in Africa | date = October 1987 | first = Mervyn | last = Hiskett | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 209–23 | jstor = 1580875 | doi=10.1163/157006687x00145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2010 article published by the [[Sunday Trust]] magazine the military cremated Maitatsine's remains, which now rest in a bottle kept at a police laboratory in Kano.&lt;ref name="sundayTrust20101226"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sundaytrust.com.ng/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5631:maitatsine-30-years-after-kanos-most-deadly-violence&amp;catid=44:feature&amp;Itemid=135 | title=Maitatsine: 30 Years After Kano’s Most Deadly Violence | publisher=Daily Trust | work=Sunday Trust | date=2010-12-26 | accessdate=May 25, 2012 | author=Adamu,  Lawan Danjuma}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Despite Mohammed Marwa's death, Yan Tatsine riots continued into the early 1980s. In October 1982 riots erupted in [[Bulumkuttu]], near [[Maidaguri]],&lt;ref name=Omotosho/&gt; and in [[Kaduna]],&lt;ref name=Omotosho/&gt; to where many Yan Tatsine adherents had moved after 1980.  Over 3,000 people died.  Some survivors of these altercations moved to [[Yola, Nigeria|Yola]], and in early 1984 more violent uprisings occurred in that city.&lt;ref name=Omotosho/&gt;  In this round of rioting, [[Musa Makaniki]], a close disciple of Maitatsine, emerged as a leader and Marwa's successor.&lt;ref name='pham'/&gt;&lt;ref name='hiskett'/&gt;  Ultimately more than 1,000 people died in Yola and roughly half of the city's 60,000 inhabitants were left homeless.  Makaniki fled to his hometown of [[Gombe, Nigeria|Gombe]],&lt;ref name=Omotosho&gt;[http://unilorin.edu.ng/publications/omotoshoao/Religious%20Violence%20in%20Nigeria.pdf Religious Violence in Nigeria – the Causes and Solutions: an Islamic Perspective], A. O. Omotosho. Swedish Missiological Theme 2003, P. 15-31.&lt;/ref&gt; where more Yan Tatsine riots occurred in April 1985.  After the deaths of several hundred people Makaniki retreated to Cameroon, where he remained until 2004 when he was arrested in Nigeria.&lt;ref name='pham'/&gt;

The Islamist Quranist group [[Kala Kato]] are an off-shoot of the Yan Tatsine.

Some analysts view the terrorist group [[Boko Haram]] as an extension of the Maitatsine riots.&lt;ref name='cfrBackgrounder'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cfr.org/africa/boko-haram/p25739 | title = Backgrounder: Boko Haram | accessdate = 2011-09-01 | last = Johnson | first = Toni | date = 31 August 2011 | publisher = Council on Foreign Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Man Ray''' (born '''Emmanuel Radnitzky'''; August 27, 1890&amp;nbsp;– November 18, 1976) was an American visual artist who spent most of his career in [[Paris]]. He was a significant contributor to the [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] movements, although his ties to each were informal. He produced major works in a variety of [[List of artistic media|media]] but considered himself a painter above all. He was best known for his photography, and he was a renowned [[fashion photography|fashion]] and portrait photographer. Man Ray is also noted for his work with [[photogram]]s, which he called "rayographs" in reference to himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,743589,00.html |title=Rayograms by Man Ray |work=Time |date=April 18, 1932 |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

===Background and early life===
[[File:WLA amart 1913 watercolor Landscape.jpg|thumb|upright|Man Ray, 1913, ''Landscape'' (''Paysage Fauve''),  watercolor on paper, 35.2 x 24.6 cm, [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]]]
During his career as an artist, Man Ray allowed few details of his early life or family background to be known to the public. He even refused to acknowledge that he ever had a name other than Man Ray.&lt;ref name= BaldwinBio&gt;[[Neil Baldwin (writer)|Baldwin, Neil]]. &lt;cite&gt;Man Ray: American Artist&lt;/cite&gt;; Da Capo Press; {{ISBN|0-306-81014-X}} (1988, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Man Ray's birth name was Emmanuel Radnitzky in [[South Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], US, in 1890.&lt;ref name="Jewish Identity" /&gt; He was the eldest child of [[History of the Jews in Russia#United States|Russian Jewish immigrants]]&lt;ref name="Jewish Identity" /&gt; Max, a tailor, and Minnie Radnitzky.&lt;ref name="Federal Census"&gt;1900 United States Federal Census&lt;/ref&gt; He had a brother, Sam, and two sisters, Dora and Essie,&lt;ref name="Federal Census" /&gt; the youngest born in 1897 shortly after they settled in the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]]&lt;ref name="Jewish Identity" /&gt; neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. In early 1912, the Radnitzky family changed their surname to Ray. Man Ray's brother chose the surname in reaction to the [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] discrimination and [[antisemitism]] prevalent at the time. Emmanuel, who was called "Manny" as a nickname, changed his first name to Man and gradually began to use Man Ray as his name.&lt;ref name=BaldwinBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conv2Mod&gt;[[Francis Naumann]]; &lt;cite&gt;Conversion to Modernism: The Early Work of Man Ray&lt;/cite&gt;; Rutgers University Press; {{ISBN|0-8135-3148-9}} (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Man Ray, Rencontre dans la porte tournante.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Man Ray, c. 1921–1922, ''Rencontre dans la porte tournante'', published on the cover (and page 39) of ''[[Der Sturm]]'', Volume 13, Number 3, March 5, 1922]]
Man Ray's father worked in a garment factory and ran a small tailoring business out of the family home. He enlisted his children to assist him from an early age. Man Ray's mother enjoyed designing the family's clothes and inventing [[patchwork]] items from scraps of fabric.&lt;ref name=BaldwinBio/&gt; Man Ray wished to disassociate himself from his family background, but their tailoring left an enduring mark on his art.

Mason Klein, curator of a Man Ray exhibition at the [[Jewish Museum (Manhattan)|Jewish Museum]] in New York, ''Alias Man Ray: The Art of Reinvention'', suggests that the artist may have been "the first Jewish avant-garde artist."&lt;ref name="Jewish Identity"&gt;{{ citation | url= http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c347_a17217/The_Arts/Museums.html | date= November 10, 2009 | title= Man Ray's Jewish Identity: 'Concealing And Revealing' | first= Eric | last= Herschthal | work = [[The Jewish Week]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100127075614/http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c347_a17217/The_Arts/Museums.html | archivedate = January 27, 2010 | deadurl=yes | quote=Klein suggests that Ray may have even been the first Jewish avant-garde artist, though it is a tenuous claim given both the movement and Man Ray's disavowal of ethnic identity.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Man Ray was the uncle of the photographer [[Naomi Savage]], who learned some of his techniques and incorporated them into her own work.&lt;ref name="HellerHeller2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jules Heller|author2=Nancy G.

===First artistic endeavors===

Man Ray displayed artistic and mechanical abilities during childhood. His education at Brooklyn's [[Boys and Girls High School|Boys' High School]] from 1904 to 1909 provided him with solid grounding in [[technical drawing|drafting]] and other basic art techniques. While he attended school, he educated himself with frequent visits to the local art museums, where he studied the works of the [[Old Master]]s. After his graduation, Ray was offered a scholarship to study architecture but chose to pursue a career as an artist. Man Ray's parents were disappointed by their son's decision to pursue art, but they agreed to rearrange the family's modest living quarters so that Ray's room could be his [[studio]].&lt;ref name=BaldwinBio/&gt; The artist remained in the family home over the next four years. During this time, he worked steadily towards becoming a professional painter. Man Ray earned money as a [[commercial art]]ist and was a [[Technical illustration|technical illustrator]] at several [[Manhattan]] companies.&lt;ref name=BaldwinBio/&gt;&lt;ref name=Conv2Mod/&gt;

The surviving examples of his work from this period indicate that he attempted mostly paintings and drawings in 19th-century styles. He was already an avid admirer of contemporary avant-garde art, such as the European modernists he saw at [[Alfred Stieglitz]]'s "[[291 (art gallery)|291]]" gallery and works by the [[Ashcan School]]. However, with a few exceptions, he was not yet able to integrate these trends into his own work. The art classes he sporadically attended, including stints at the [[National Academy of Design]] and the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]], were of little apparent benefit to him. When he enrolled in the [[Modern School (United States)|Ferrer School]] in the autumn of 1912, he began a period of intense and rapid artistic development.&lt;ref name=Conv2Mod/&gt;

While living in New York City, Man Ray was visually influenced by the 1913 [[Armory Show]] and galleries of European contemporary works. His early paintings display facets of [[cubism]]. After befriending [[Marcel Duchamp]], who was interested in showing movement in static paintings, his works began to depict movement of the figures. An example is the repetitive positions of the dancer's skirts in ''The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with Her Shadows'' (1916).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A3716&amp;page_number=5&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 |title=The Collection &amp;#124; Man Ray. The Rope Dancer Accompanies Herself with Her Shadows. 1916 |publisher=MoMA |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, Man Ray had his first solo show of paintings and drawings after he had taken up residence at an art colony in [[Grantwood, New Jersey]], across the [[Hudson River]] from New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D14FF345C137B93CBA8178AD95F428785F9 "Man Ray Is Dead in Paris at 86; Dadaist Painter and Photographer"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 19, 1976. Retrieved December 15, 2013. "His style changed in 1915 to 'reducing human figures to flat-patterned disarticulated forms.' He was living at the time in Ridgefield, N.&amp;nbsp;J."&lt;/ref&gt; His first proto-Dada object, an assemblage titled ''Self-Portrait'', was exhibited the following year. He produced his first significant photographs in 1918.

Man Ray abandoned conventional painting to involve himself with [[Dada]], a radical anti-art movement. He started making objects and developed unique mechanical and photographic methods of making images. For the 1918 version of ''Rope Dancer'', he combined a spray-gun technique with a pen drawing. Like Duchamp, he did ''[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymades]]''—ordinary objects that are selected and modified. His ''[[The Gift (sculpture)|Gift]]'' readymade (1921) is a [[Clothes iron|flatiron]] with metal tacks attached to the bottom, and ''Enigma of Isidore Ducasse''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imj.org.il/imagine/collections/item.asp?table=comb&amp;itemNum=194410 |title=IMAGINE – The Israel Museum's searchable collections database |publisher=Imj.org.il |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an unseen object (a sewing machine) wrapped in cloth and tied with cord. ''Aerograph'' (1919), another work from this period, was done with airbrush on glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.stedelijk.nl/en/artwork/27789-aerograph |title=Man Ray, ''Aerograph'', 1919, Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam |access-date=June 18, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618235648/http://www.stedelijk.nl/en/artwork/27789-aerograph |archive-date=June 18, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, Man Ray helped Duchamp make the ''[[Marcel Duchamp#Kinetic art|Rotary Glass Plates]]'', one of the earliest examples of [[kinetic art]]. It was composed of glass plates turned by a motor. That same year, Man Ray, [[Katherine Dreier]], and Duchamp founded the [[Société Anonyme (art)|Société Anonyme]], an itinerant collection that was the first museum of [[modern art]] in the U.S. In 1941 the collection was donated to [[Yale University Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name="Cabanne, P"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=4SNKDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT14&amp;dq=cabanne,+Marcel+Duchamp+military+service&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje6oi3mMDXAhXHWxQKHTsbBb8Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cabanne%2C%20Marcel%20Duchamp%20military%20service&amp;f=false Cabanne, P., &amp; Duchamp, M.

Man Ray teamed up with Duchamp to publish one issue of ''[[New York Dada]]'' in 1920. For Man Ray, Dada's experimentation was no match for the wild and chaotic streets of New York.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/man-ray/prophet-of-the-avant-garde/510/ |title=Man Ray – Prophet of the Avant-Garde &amp;#124; American Masters |publisher=PBS |date=September 17, 2005 |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that "Dada cannot live in New York. All New York is dada, and will not tolerate a rival."&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

In 1913, Man Ray met his first wife, the Belgian poet Adon Lacroix (Donna Lecoeur) (1887–1975), in New York. They married in 1914, separated in 1919, and formally divorced in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Lacroix's first marriage had been to Adolf Wolff, an immigrant anarchist sculptor and poet, born in Brussels, Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paris===

In July 1921, Man Ray went to live and work in Paris, France. He soon settled in the [[Montparnasse]] quarter favored by many artists. Shortly after arriving in Paris, he met and fell in love with Kiki de Montparnasse ([[Alice Prin]]), an artists' model and celebrated character in Paris bohemian circles. Kiki was Man Ray's companion for most of the 1920s. She became the subject of some of his most famous photographic images and starred in his experimental films, ''[[Le Retour à la Raison]]'' and ''[[L'Étoile de mer]]''. In 1929, he began a love affair with the Surrealist photographer [[Lee Miller]]. Miller left him in 1932.

For the next 20 years in Montparnasse, Man Ray was a distinguished photographer. Significant members of the art world, such as [[James Joyce]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Bridget Bate Tichenor]],&lt;ref name="Man Ray"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=1015080 |title=Christie's Photography Auction, London, May 1, 1996, Lot 213/Sale 558 ''Man Ray – Bridget Bate, 1941'' |publisher=Christies.com |accessdate=January 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Antonin Artaud]], posed for his camera.

Man Ray was represented in the first [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] exhibition with [[Jean Arp]], [[Max Ernst]], [[André Masson]], [[Joan Miró]], and [[Pablo Picasso]] at the Galerie Pierre in Paris in 1925. Important works from this time were a metronome with an eye, originally titled ''[[Object to Be Destroyed]]'', and the ''Violon d'Ingres,''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=61240 Getty collection].

''Violon d'Ingres'' is a popular example of how Man Ray could juxtapose disparate elements in his photography to generate meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Penrose, Roland. Man Ray. 1. Boston: New York Graphic Society, 1975. Pg 92&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, surrealist artist [[Méret Oppenheim]], known for her fur-covered teacup, posed nude for Man Ray in a well-known series of photographs depicting her standing next to a [[printing press]].

With [[Lee Miller]], his [[photographic assistant]] and lover, Man Ray reinvented the photographic technique of [[solarisation|solarization]]. He also created a type of [[photogram]] he called "rayographs", which he described as "pure dadaism".

Man Ray was in a relationship with the model Adrienne Fidelin during some time between 1936 and 1940, the two parting ways after Ray fled the Nazi occupation in France, while Adrienne chose to stay behind to care for her family.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/25/style/tmagazine/25tmodel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Man Ray directed a number of influential [[avant-garde]] short films, known as ''[[Cinéma Pur]]''. He directed ''[[Le Retour à la Raison]]'' (2 mins, 1923); ''[[Emak-Bakia]]'' (16 mins, 1926); ''[[L'Étoile de Mer]]'' (15 mins, 1928); and ''[[Les Mystères du Château de Dé]]'' (27 mins, 1929). Man Ray also assisted Marcel Duchamp with the cinematography of his film ''[[Anemic Cinema]]'' (1926), and Ray personally manned the camera on [[Fernand Léger]]'s ''[[Ballet Mécanique]]'' (1924). In [[René Clair]]'s film ''[[Entr'acte (film)|Entr'acte]]'' (1924), Man Ray appeared in a brief scene playing [[chess]] with Duchamp.

Duchamp, Man Ray, and [[Francis Picabia]] were friends and collaborators. The three were connected by their experimental, entertaining, and innovative art.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Winter Museum Preview: Top 5 London | first= Chris | last= Bors | work=Art+Auction  | date= January 9, 2008 | url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/26385/winter-museum-preview-top-5-london/ | accessdate=April 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=k5qvm7pOI8AC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=man%20ray%20american%20artist&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Neil Baldwin, ''Man Ray American Artist''].

Man Ray was forced to return from Paris to the United States due to the [[Second World War]]. He lived in Los Angeles from 1940 to 1951 where he focused his creative energy on painting. A few days after arriving in Los Angeles, Man Ray met [[Juliet Browner]], a first-generation [[Romanian American|American]] of [[Romanian-Jewish]] lineage. She was a trained dancer, who studied dance with [[Martha Graham]],&lt;ref name="Juliet's obituary"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/21/obituaries/juliet-man-ray-79-the-artist-s-model-and-muse-is-dead.html | title=Juliet Man Ray, 79, The Artist's Model And Muse, Is Dead | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 21, 1991 | accessdate=December 3, 2014 | author=Flint, Peter B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an experienced artists' model. The two married in 1946 in a double wedding with their friends [[Max Ernst]] and [[Dorothea Tanning]]. In 1948 Man Ray had a solo exhibition at the [[William Copley (artist)|Copley Galleries]] in Beverly Hills, which brought together a wide array of work and featured his newly painted canvases of the ''Shakespearean Equations'' series.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Strauss, "To Be Continued Unnoticed: Mathematics and Shakespeare in Hollywood," in Wendy A.

===Later life===
[[File:Man Ray by Wolleh.jpg|thumb|Man Ray portrayed by [[Lothar Wolleh]], Paris, 1975]]

Man Ray returned to Paris in 1951, and settled with Juliet into a studio at 2 bis rue Ferou near the Luxembourg Gardens in St. Germain des Pres, where he continued his creative practice across mediums.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Baldwin, Man Ray: American Artist, p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; During the last quarter century of his life, he returned to a number of his iconic earlier works, recreating them in new form. He also directed the production of limited-edition replicas of several of his objects, working first with Marcel Zerbib and later [[Arturo Schwarz]].

In 1963, he published his autobiography, ''Self-Portrait'', which was republished in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ray|first1=Man|year=1999|title=Self Portrait: Man Ray|edition=First paperback|publisher=Bulfinch|isbn=0-8212-2474-3|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Paris on November 18, 1976, from a lung infection. He was interred in the [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Scott. ''Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons'', 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 38837-38838). McFarland &amp; Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Ray's [[epitaph]] reads "unconcerned, but not indifferent". When Juliet Browner died in 1991, she was interred in the same tomb. Her epitaph reads "together again". Juliet organized a trust for his work and donated much of his work to museums. Her plans to restore the studio as a public museum proved too expensive; such was the structure's disrepair. Most of the contents were stored at the [[Pompidou Center]].&lt;ref name="Juliet's obituary"/&gt;

==Accolades==
In 1974, Man Ray received the [[Royal Photographic Society]]'s Progress Medal and Honorary Fellowship "in recognition of any invention, research, publication or other contribution which has resulted in an important advance in the scientific or technological development of photography or imaging in the widest sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rps.org/about/awards/history-and-recipients/progress-medal|title=Progress Medal|date=1974|website=Royal Photographic Society|access-date=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, ''[[ARTnews]]'' magazine named Man Ray one of the 25 most influential artists of the 20th century. The publication cited his groundbreaking photography, "his explorations of film, painting, sculpture, [[collage]], [[assemblage (art)|assemblage]] and prototypes of what would eventually be called [[performance art]] and [[conceptual art]]." ''ARTnews'' further stated that "Man Ray offered artists in all media an example of a [[Transcendental Meditation#Science of Creative Intelligence|creative intelligence]] that, in its 'pursuit of pleasure and liberty', unlocked every door it came to and walked freely where it would." Seeking pleasure and liberty was one of Ray's guiding principles, along with others such as doing things that are socially prohibited.&lt;ref name=artnews&gt;Coleman, A. D. "Willful Provocateur"; ''ARTnews'', May 1999.

* "There is no progress in art, any more than there is progress in making love. There are simply different ways of doing it."&amp;nbsp;– 1948 essay, "To Be Continued, Unnoticed".
*  "An original is a creation motivated by desire. Any reproduction of an original is motivated by necessity. It is marvelous that we are the only species that creates gratuitous forms.

*  "I paint what cannot be photographed, that which comes from the imagination or from dreams, or from an unconscious drive. I photograph the things that I do not wish to paint, the things which already have an existence."&amp;nbsp;– Undated interview, circa 1970s; published in ''Man Ray: Photographer'', 1981.

===About Man Ray===
* "Man Ray, n.m. synon. de Joie jouer jouir." (Translation: "Man Ray, masculine noun, synonymous with joy, to play, to enjoy.")&amp;nbsp;— [[Marcel Duchamp]], as the opening epigram for Man Ray's memoir ''Self-Portrait'', 1963.
* "With him you could try anything—there was nothing you were told not to do, except spill the chemicals. With Man Ray, you were free to do what your imagination conjured, and that kind of encouragement was wonderful."&amp;nbsp;– Artist and photographer, Naomi Savage, Man Ray's niece and protégée, in a 2000 newspaper interview.
* "Man Ray is a youthful alchemist forever in quest of the painter's [[philosopher's stone]]. May he never find it, as that would bring an end to his experimentations which are the very condition of living art expression."&amp;nbsp;– Adolf Wolff, "Art Notes", ''International 8'', no. 1 (January 1914), p.&amp;nbsp;21.
* "[Man Ray was] a kind of short man who looked a little like [[Mister Peepers]], spoke slowly with a slight Brooklynese accent, and talked so you could never tell when he was kidding."&amp;nbsp;– Brother-in-law Joseph Browner on his first impression of the artist; quoted in the ''Fresno Bee'', August 26, 1990.

The '''Master of Sacred Theology'''  (Latin: ''Sacrae Theologiae Magister''; abbreviated '''S.T.M.''') is a graduate-level, North American, academic degree in [[theology]] equivalent to [[Th.M.]]

One must normally have an [[Master of Divinity|M.Div.]] or an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in a theological field before being admitted to study for the S.T.M. The S.T.M. typically is designed to enhance a student's academic credentials for entrance to a doctoral program.

S.T.M. degrees are typically awarded after having completed twenty-four hours of study at the Master's level beyond that required for the first theological degree.  In some programs this degree may be awarded solely on the basis of taught academic courses.  However, many S.T.M. programs require or permit the student to write a thesis as a part of the degree requirements.  The thesis is especially helpful for those individuals who wish to use the S.T.M. to further their qualifications for [[doctoral]] study and who did not complete a thesis as a part of the first professional degree.  Some seminaries will also credit part of the work done for the S.T.M. towards a student moving on to the [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[theology]] degree once the S.T.M. has been awarded.

==Roman Catholic==
In Roman Catholic universities with [[pontifical charters]], the equivalent is the [[Licentiate in Sacred Theology]] (S.T.L.), the intermediate degree between the [[Bachelor of Sacred Theology|S.T.B.]] (bachelor's) and [[Doctor of Sacred Theology|S.T.D.]] (doctorate).  The S.T.L. is an additional two years of study beyond that required for the S.T.B. However, McGill University's graduate school of religious studies, considered partly a Catholic school of theology, offers the academic S.T.M. similar to the Protestant one.

In addition, the title "Sacrae Theologiae Magister" (S.T.M.) or "Master of [[Sacred theology|Sacred Theology]]" is also the name given to an honorary title bestowed by the Roman Catholic [[Order of Preachers]] (Dominicans) on its most distinguished scholars.  Thus it is a "master's degree" in the most ancient sense and thus can be likened to an honorary doctorate conferred only upon Dominicans who are already scholars of theology.  The recipient must be a full-time professor for ten years and have published books and articles of international scholarly repute.  The initial nomination is made by the friar's own province (local distrinct) and then must be approved by the intellectual commission of the Generalate in Rome.  The final decision is then made, after review, by the Master of this Order and his council.  The regalia of the S.T.M. is a four-finned black biretta today usually trimmed with scarlet, and a ring, which may be set with an amethyst.&lt;ref name="master"&gt;[http://www.varsitarian.net/witness/20100326/ust_historian_named_master_of_theology The Varsitarian Website]. ''UST Historian named Master of Theology'' May 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sacraer"&gt;[http://www.newliturgicalmovement.org/2008/04/domincian-sacrae-magister-theologiae.html New liturgical movement]. ''Dominican Sacrae Theologiae'' May 1, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The S.T.M., has the perpetual right to the title "very reverend." The Dominican archbishop of Cincinnati, [[John T. McNicholas]], [[Order of Preachers|OP]], was famous for refusing to use "D.D." ([[Doctor of Divinity]]) after his name; he insisted on using "S.T.M." because it was the more distinguished academic title.&lt;ref name="sacraer"/&gt; His STD, of course, is a yet more distinguished title than either DD or STM as the STD is an earnt degree and not an honorary one.

The '''Messianic Israel Alliance''' ('''MIA''') serves the Messianic community as an organization for [[Messianic Jews]] and other [[Christians]]. Particular emphasis is placed on the [[divinity]] of Jesus, observation of the ''[[Shabbat]]'' (Sabbath) from sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday, and celebration of the [[Jewish festivals|Biblical Festivals]] and following of [[Jewish dietary laws]]. [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] have long associated the term "[[Children of Israel|Israel]]" with their followers. The Messianic Israel Alliance was founded in 1999 as a service organization for [[Christians]] who were interested in the Hebraic foundations of Christianity. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.messianicisrael.com/ The Messianic Israel Alliance - About us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Le Mormont'''''  is a hill in the Swiss [[canton of Vaud]], rising to an elevation of 605 metres, with a [[Topographic prominence|prominence]] of about 115 metres. It is part of the   [[Éclépens]] municipality. The name is first recorded in AD 814, as ''Mauromonte''. It is derived from the Roman-era personal name ''Maurus''.&lt;ref&gt;
Hermann Gröhler, ''Über ursprung und bedeutung der französischen ortsnamen von Hermann Gröhler'' 	C. Winter, 1933, p. 336 (citing [[Ernst Förstemann|Förstemann]]). For speculation on an alternative (Celtic or Germanic)  derivation, see Gilbert Künzi, Charles Kraege, 'Montagnes romandes: à l'assaut de leur nom : étude étymologique des noms de montagnes de Suisse romande'',  Archives vivantes romandes, Editions Cabedita, 2001, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=icIYBKgQvjAC&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 34]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Mormont is about halfway between lakes [[Lake Neuchatel|Neuchatel]] and [[Lake Geneva|Geneva]], forming a watershed between the [[Rhine]] and the [[Rhone]] basins, separating the  [[Venoge (river)|Venoge]] and the  [[Orbe (river)|Orbe]] valleys to the south and north, respectively. The mountain is [[parent peak|topographically connected]] to the [[Jura Mountains]] to the west. East of Le Mormont runs the ''Entreroches'' gorge (460 m), through which the  [[Canal d’Entreroches]] was dug in the 17th century,  enabling water transportation between the Rhone and the Rhine rivers. The canal ceased to be profitable in the 18th century, and when a bridge across the canal collapsed in 1829, it was shut down altogether.
The course of the historical canal is now traversed by a [[Swiss railways|railway]] tunnel of the [[Lausanne]]-[[Yverdon]] line.
&lt;!--[[File:Canal d'Entreroches 03 11.jpg|thumb|upright|Map of the historical waterway between Lake Neuchatel and Lake Geneva]]--&gt;

Le Mormont has been substantially [[Open-pit mining|mined]] for chalk used in [[cement]] production.
It was planned to extend the mining pit to the hill's summit in 2006 to 2009; because of this, the cantonal archaeological office of Vaud performed a [[watching brief]] excavation, which led to the discovery of a late [[La Tène period]] (c. 100 BC) [[Helvetii|Helvetic]] cult site.
The site was reported as being of unprecedented size and richness for the period.  A total of 250 pits containing sacrificial deposits were recorded. Among the deposited goods were ceramic and bronze vessels, iron tools, jewelry, grinding stones, coins, and both animal and human remains.
It is unclear whether the human remains represent a cemetery or evidence of [[Celtic human sacrifice|human sacrifice]].
The site is of primary importance for [[Celtic polytheism|Gaulish religion]] on the eve of the [[Gallic Wars|Roman conquest]].
Because of the importance of the archaeological site, the mining operation has been put on hold until a more detailed archaeological excavation scheduled for 2014/15.

The '''Parable of the Invisible Gardener''' is a tale originally told by [[John Wisdom]]. It was later developed in the university debate by [[Antony Flew]], who made several important changes such as changing the gardeners to explorers and making original "long neglected garden" a clearing in the jungle. It is often used to illustrate the perceived differences between assertions based on [[faith]] and assertions based on [[scientific evidence]], and the problems associated with [[falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] beliefs. Flew's main claim in using the parable is that religious believers do not allow anybody to "falsify" their assertions, instead they simply change their beliefs to suit the questioner. Thus Flew concludes that religious believers cause God to "die the death of a thousand qualifications". In Flew's version, the tale runs as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Once upon a time two explorers came upon a clearing in the jungle. In the clearing were growing many flowers and many weeds. One explorer says, "Some gardener must tend this plot." The other disagrees, "There is no gardener." So they pitch their tents and set a watch. No gardener is ever seen. "But perhaps he is an invisible gardener." So they set up a barbed-wire fence. They electrify it. They patrol with bloodhounds. (For they remember how H. G. Well's ''The Invisible Man'' could be both smelt and touched though he could not be seen.) But no shrieks ever suggest that some intruder has received a shock. No movements of the wire ever betray an invisible climber. The bloodhounds never give cry. Yet still the Believer is not convinced. "But there is a gardener, invisible, intangible, insensible, to electric shocks, a gardener who has no scent and makes no sound, a gardener who comes secretly to look after the garden which he loves. At last the Skeptic despairs, "But what remains of your original assertion? Just how does what you call an invisible, intangible, eternally elusive gardener differ from an imaginary gardener or even from no gardener at all?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/flew_falsification.html|title=Antony Flew "Theology and Falsification," 1950|website=www.stephenjaygould.org|access-date=2016-09-26}} {{dead link|date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pholiotina smithii''''' is a rare member of the genus ''[[Pholiotina]]'' which contains the hallucinogenic alkaloid [[psilocybin]].  It was formerly known as ''Galera cyanopes''.

==Description==
*'''Cap''': 0.3 - 1(1.3) cm across [[Conic]] to [[wikt:convex|convex]] but expands to nearly plane in age, with a distinct umbo, smooth, ochraceous tawny to cinnamon-brown, darker at edges, glistening when wet, hygrophanous, even to [[wikt:striate|striate]] when moist. Lightens when it dries, turning a tan color.
*'''Gills''': [[wikt:Adnate|adnate]] to [[wikt:adnexed|adnexed]], crowded to subdistant, narrow to moderately broad, pale grayish yellow to brown with whitish edges, darkening to rusty cinnamon brown in age. 
*'''Spores''': Cinnamon brown, (6.5)7.0 - 9.0 x 4.0 - 4.5(5) micrometers smooth and [[ellipsoid]] with thick walls and a small but distinct germ-pore.
*'''[[Stipe (mycology)|Stipe]]''': (1)2 to 5(7.5) cm long, .75 - 1(1.5) mm thick, mostly equal but often slightly swollen at the base. Fragile, whitish with fine fibrils but becoming smooth, lacks an [[Annulus (mycology)|annulus]], slightly twisting striatulations, often slightly grayish at the base when young, becoming an azure shade of blue in age, quickly bruising blue when handled.
*'''Taste''': 
*'''Odor''': farinaceous.
*'''Microscopic features''': Subcapitate cheilocystidia.

==Distribution and habitat==

''Pholiotina smithii'' is found in [[North America]] and often grows in bogs, ditches and swampy areas, commonly in [[sphagnum]] moss.  Also found along river banks and in lawns.

It is known to occur in [[Canada]], [[Oregon]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], and [[Northern Michigan, (on ancient man-made earthen mounds)]], but is probably more widely distributed.

On the west coast of America, ''Pholiotina smithii'' is an early summer mushroom, almost never appearing after the first week of June.

==Edibility==

Mildly hallucinogenic, containing [[psilocin]], [[psilocybin]], and [[baeocystin]].  Most mycologists recommend against eating this mushroom because it is difficult to distinguish from poisonous species.

'''''Pratikramana''''' ({{lang-sa|प्रतिक्रमण}}; also spelled ''Pratikraman'') (lit. "introspection"), is a ritual during which [[Jainism|Jains]] repent (''prayaschit'') for their sins and non-meritorious activities committed knowingly or inadvertently during their daily life through thought, speech or action. 

Pratikramana also refers to a combition of six ''avashyaks'' (essential rituals), being ''[[Samayik]]'' (state of total equanimity), ''Chauvisantho'' (honoring the 24 [[Tirthankar]]s), ''Vandana'' – (offering salutations to [[Jain monks|''sadhus'' (monks) and ''sadhvis'' (nuns)]]), ''Pratikramana'' (introspection and repentance), ''[[Kayotsarga]]'' (meditation of the soul) and ''Pratyakhyan'' (renunciation).

Although frequency of repenting varies, devout Jains often practice Pratikraman at least twice a day. It is one of the 28 primary attributes (''mūla guņa'') of both [[Śvētāmbara]] and [[Digambara]] monks.

== Etymology ==
''Pratikramana'' is the combination of two words, ''Pra'' meaning "return" and
''atikramana'' meaning "violation". Literally, it means "returning from
violations".&lt;ref&gt;http://umich.edu/~umjains/jainismsimplified/chapter18.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of ''Pratikramana''==
There are five types of ''Pratikramana'':
#Devasi
#Rayi
#Pakhi
#Chaumasi
#[[Samvatsari]]

===''Devasi Pratikramana'' ===
''Devasi Pratikramana''' is performed daily in the evening.

=== ''Rayi Pratikramana'' ===
''Rayi Pratikramana'' is performed in the early morning.

===''Pakhi Pratikramana''===
''Pakhi Pratikramana'' is done once every fifteen days. 

===''Chaumasi Pratikramana''===
''Chaumasi Pratikramana'' is done once in four months on the [[Purnima (day)|Purnima]] (full moon) of the [[Kartika (month)|Kartik]], [[Falgun]] and [[Asharh|Aṣaṛh]] months of the [[Vira Nirvana Samvat]] calendrical year for the sins committed during that period.

=== ''Samvatsari Pratikramana''===
{{Expand section|date=March 2018}}
[[Samvatsari]] Pratikraman is done once per year on the last day of [[Paryushana]] mahaparv for the [[sin]]s committed during the whole year.

Samvatsari Pratikraman includes all six things a ''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|Śrāvaka]]'' (householders) must do:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umich.edu/~umjains/jainismsimplified/chapter18.html |title=Jainism Simplified Chapter 18 – Pratikraman |publisher=Umich.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Jainism considers the soul, in its pure form, to have infinite perception, knowledge, and vigor, and to be non-attached. These attributes are not seen in a worldly soul because it is soiled with karmas. By following religious principles principals and activities, Jains believe they overcome karmas and promote liberation of the soul. There are various rituals, of which Pratikraman is the most important. During pratikraman, Jains repent for non-meritorious activities on a daily basis.

''Pratikraman'' must be performed twice every day, or at least once every day after sunset. If that is not possible, at least on every Pakkhi (24 times in a year).

== Sāmāyika ==
{{Main|Samayik}}
''Pratikramana'' is also done while performing the ''sāmāyika'' (periodic concentration). In performing ''sāmāyika'', the ''śrāvaka'' has to stand facing north or east and bow to the ''[[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]]''.&lt;ref name=Householder/&gt; He then sit down and recites the [[Namokara mantra]] a certain number of times, and finally devotes himself to holy meditation. This consists in:&lt;ref name=Householder&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLAlAQAAIAAJ | title=The Householder's Dharma: English Translation of The Ratna Karanda Sravakachara | publisher=The Central Jaina Publishing House | date=1917 | author=Jain, Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|p=44–45, 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''pratikramana'', recounting the sins committed and repenting for them,
#''pratyākhyanā'', resolving to avoid particular sins in future,
#''sāmāyika karma'', renunciation of personal attachments, and the cultivation of a feeling of regarding every body and thing alike,
#''stuti'', praising the four and twenty Tīrthankaras,
#''vandanā'', devotion to a particular Tīrthankaras, and
#''kāyotsarga'', withdrawal of attention from the body (physical personality) and becoming absorbed in the contemplation of the spiritual Self.

==Chauvisantho==
Chauvisantho, also called Chaturvinshatistava, means adoration of the twenty-four [[Tirthankara]]s. While reciting it, Jains show their respect for the Tirthankaras and are reminded of how victorious these [[Arihant (Jainism)|Jina]]s were, who overcame inner enemies like anger, ego, greed, deceit, etc. Chauvisantho encourages Jains to emulate [[Tirthankar]]s and strive to be like them.

==Pratyakhyan==
This is a formal renunciation of certain activities, which stops or reduces the inflow of karmas to a great extent. This activity helps us to learn to control our desires and prepares us for a much bigger renunciation.

The relationship between '''religion and divorce''' is complicated and varied. This article attempts to summarize the dominant views in a number of major world faiths.

The great majority of [[Christian denominations]] affirm that marriage is intended as a lifelong covenant, but vary in their response to its dissolubility through divorce. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] treats all [[consummate]]d [[Sacraments|sacramental]] marriages as permanent during the life of the spouses, and therefore does not allow remarriage after a divorce if the other spouse still lives and the marriage has not been [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulled]]. However, divorced Catholics are still welcome to participate fully in the life of the church so long as they have not remarried against church law, and the Catholic Church generally requires civil divorce or annulment procedures to have been completed before it will consider annulment cases. Annulment is not the same as divorce - it is a declaration that the marriage was never valid to begin with.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;''Divorce in Christianity'' at [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ritesrituals/divorce_1.shtml www.bbc.co.uk] retrieved 17 Aug 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Christian denominations, including the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and many [[Protestant]] churches, will allow both divorce and remarriage even with a surviving former spouse, at least under certain conditions. For example, the [[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]], in its 2014 Discipline, teaches:&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"/&gt;
{{quotation|We believe that the only legitimate marriage is the joining of one man and one woman (Gen. 2:24; Rom. 7:2; 1 Cor. 7:10; Eph. 5:22, 23). We deplore the evils of divorce and remarriage. We regard adultery as the only scripturally justifiable grounds for divorce; and the party guilty of adultery has by his or her act forfeited membership in the church. In the case of divorce for other cause, neither party shall be permitted to marry again during the lifetime of the other; and violation of this law shall be punished by expulsion from the church (Matt. 5:32; Mark 10:11, 12). In the carrying out of these principles, guilt shall be established in accordance with judicial procedures set forth in ''The Discipline''.&lt;ref name="AWMC2014"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Discipline of the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection (Original Allegheny Conference)|year=2014|publisher=[[Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection]]|location=[[Salem, Ohio|Salem]]|language=English|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In societies that practised [[Puritan]]ism, divorce was allowed if one partner in the marriage was not completely satisfied with the other, and remarriage was also allowed. The [[Church of England]] also took an indissolublist line until 2002, when it agreed to allow a divorced person to remarry in church under exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

Bible commentary on divorce comes primarily from the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and the epistles of Paul. [[Expounding of the Law#Divorce|Jesus taught on the subject of divorce]] in three of the [[Gospels]], and Paul gives a rather extensive treatment of the subject in his [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] chapter 7: "Let not the wife depart from her husband...let not the husband put away his wife" (1 Corinthians 7:10-11), but he also includes the [[Pauline privilege]].  He again alludes to his position on divorce in his [[Epistle to the Romans]], albeit an allegory, when he states "For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth. . . . So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress" (Romans 7:2-3).

In {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:31-32|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Matthew|19:1-10|KJV}} and {{bibleverse||Mark|10:1-5|KJV}}, Jesus came into conflict with the [[Pharisees]] over divorce concerning their well-known controversy between [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] and [[Shammai]] about {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|24:1-4|KJV}}—as evidenced in [[Nashim]] Gittin 9:10 of the [[Mishnah]]. Do Jesus’ answers to the Pharisees also pertain to Christians? Are Christians who adopt these teachings [[Judaizers]]? The differences in opinions about these questions usually arise over whether Jesus [[Antinomianism|opposed the Law of Moses]] or just some of the viewpoints of the Pharisees, and whether Jesus just addressed a [[Jewish Christians|Jewish audience]] or expanded his audience to include Christians, for example "all nations" as in the [[Great Commission]].    
Since Deuteronomy 24:1-4 did not give Jewish women the right to directly initiate a divorce (See ''[[Agunah]]''), did Jesus' answers "in the house" to his disciples expand the rights of women or did they merely acknowledge that some Jewish women, such as [[Herodias]] who divorced Herod Boethus, were wrongfully taking rights because Jewish women were being assimilated by other cultures? (See {{bibleverse||Matthew|14:3-4|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Mark|10:10-12|KJV}}.) In other words, did Jesus confine his remarks to the Pharisaical questions, and did he appeal to his own authority by refuting the oral authority of the Pharisees with the formula [[Expounding of the Law|"You have heard...But I say to you"]] in {{bibleverse||Matthew|5:20-48|KJV}}? Expressions used by Jesus such as "you have heard", "it hath been said", "it is written", "have you never read", "keep the commandments", "why do you break the commandments with your traditions?" and "what did Moses Command you?" seem to indicate that Jesus generally respected the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] and sometimes opposed [[Oral law|Pharisaical Opinions]]. He was [[Woes of the Pharisees|critical of the Pharisees]].

==Buddhism==
Buddhism has no religious concept of marriage (see [[Buddhist view of marriage]]). In Buddhism, marriage is a secular affair, subject to local customs.

==Islam==
{{main|Divorce in Islam}}
{{See also|Sharia}}

According to the Quran, marriage is intended to be unbounded in time, but when marital harmony cannot be attained, the Quran allows the spouses to bring the marriage to an end (2:231).&lt;ref name=EoQ-279&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Harald Motzki | year= 2006 | title=Marriage and divorce|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān|editor=Jane Dammen McAuliffe|volume=3|page=279|publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Divorce in Islam can take a variety of forms, some initiated by the husband and some initiated by the wife. The main traditional legal categories are ''talaq'' (repudiation), ''khulʿ'' (mutual divorce), judicial divorce and oaths. The theory and practice of divorce in the Islamic world have varied according to time and place.&lt;ref name=OEIW-modern&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Maaike Voorhoeve|title=Divorce. Modern Practice|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199764464.001.0001/acref-9780199764464-e-0108|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the rules of divorce were governed by [[sharia]], as interpreted by [[Fiqh|traditional Islamic jurisprudence]], and they differed depending on the [[Madhhab|legal school]].&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Maaike Voorhoeve|title=Divorce. Historical Practice|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Women|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2013|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref:oiso/9780199764464.001.0001/acref-9780199764464-e-0108|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historical practice sometimes diverged from legal theory.&lt;ref name=OEIW-hist/&gt; In modern times, as personal status (family) laws were codified, they generally remained "within the orbit of Islamic law", but control over the norms of divorce shifted from traditional jurists to the state.&lt;ref name=OEIW-modern/&gt;

==Judaism==
[[Judaism]] has always accepted divorce as a fact of life, though an unfortunate one: e.g., see [[Deuteronomy]] chapters 22 and 24.  Judaism generally maintains that it is better for a couple to divorce than to remain together in a state of bitterness and strife. It is said that ''[[shalom bayit]]'' (domestic harmony) is a desirable state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewfaq.org/divorce.htm Judaism 101/divorce]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, it is accepted that for a Jewish divorce to be effective the husband must hand to the wife, and not vice versa, a bill of divorcement, called a [[get (divorce document)|get]], which also acts as proof of the divorce. From ancient times, the get was considered to be very important to show all those who needed to have proof that the woman was in fact free from the previous marriage and free to remarry. In Jewish law, besides other things, the consequences of a woman remarrying and having a child while still legally married to another is profound: the child would be a [[mamzer]], to be avoided at any cost. Also, the woman would be committing [[adultery]] should she remarry while still legally married to another. An enactment called '''Herem de-Rabbenu Gershom''' (literally, the proscription of [[Gershom ben Judah#Synod and bans|Rabbenu Gershom]])--accepted universally throughout European Jewish communities—prohibited a husband from divorcing his wife against her will.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowitz, Chaim; [http://www.jlaw.com/Articles/getart3.html "The New York State Get Bill and its Halachic Ramifications"], ''Jewish Law Articles''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jewish law divorce is an act of the parties to the marriage, which is different from the approach adopted by many other legal systems. That is, a Jewish divorce does not require a decree from a court. The function of the court, in the absence of agreement between the parties, is to decide whether the husband should be compelled to give the ''get'' or for the wife to accept the ''get''. But, notwithstanding any such ruling, the parties remain married until such time as the husband actually delivers the ''get''.

Jewish law, in effect, does not require proof or even an allegation of moral or other fault by either party. In the first place, as noted above, if both parties agree to a divorce and follow the prescribed procedure, then the court would not need to establish responsibility for the marriage break-down. In the second place, if either party does not wish to continue co-habiting with the other is sufficient [[grounds for divorce]]. (Anything else, it is said, would amount to rape of the woman.) In this sense it is a "no-fault" approach to divorce. This approach has been accepted for thousands of years {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}. It was the approach advocated by followers of [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]], a very influential school of thought in ancient [[Judea]], which predated the current era. This is the approach which is now generally accepted in most, if not all, Jewish communities around the world.

On the other hand, the refusal of a husband to give his wife a [[get (divorce document)|get]] (the document) can be for purely vindictive or even extortion motives. This situation has resulted in numerous social problems in modern times. For example, where pre-nuptial agreements are enforceable in civil courts, appropriate provisions may be made to compel the giving of the get by the husband in the event of a civil divorce being obtained. A woman who has been refused a get is typically referred to as an "[[agunah]]".

A wife can initiate a divorce process on several grounds (including lack of satisfaction in her sexual life).  However, this right extends only so far as petitioning a court to force her husband to divorce her. Also see ''Jewish Attitude Toward Divorce''.&lt;ref&gt;

and [[Get (conflict)|Get in the Conflict of Laws]].

Furthermore, from the philosophical and mystical point of view, divorce is a unique procedure of tremendous importance and complexity, because it nullifies the holiest of connections that can exist in the Universe (similar to a connection between a person and God).  Because of the danger of the birth of illegitimate children ([[mamzer]]im) if the process is not performed properly, and because divorce law is extraordinarily complex, the process is generally supervised by experts.

In some Jewish mythologies, Adam had a wife before Eve named [[Lilith]] who left him. The earliest historically documentation of this legend appears in the  8th-10th centuries ''[[Alphabet of Ben Sira]]''. Whether this particular tradition is older is not known.

In [[Unitarian Universalism]], divorce is allowed and should be a decision by the individual person and is seen as ending a rite of passage.

{{Hatnote|This article is about religion in Korea up to the division of Korea in 1945. For subsequent history, see [[Religion in North Korea]] and [[Religion in South Korea]].}}
{{Culture of Korea}}

'''Religion in Korea''' refers the various religious traditions practiced on the [[Korean Peninsula|Korean peninsula]]. The oldest indigenous religion of [[Korea]] is [[Korean shamanism]], which has been passed down from prehistory to the present.{{sfnp|Yu|2012|p=41}} [[Buddhism]] was introduced to Korea from China during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] era in the 4th century, and the religion flourished until the [[Joseon]] Dynasty, when [[Korean Confucianism]] became the state religion.{{sfnp|Encyclopaedia Britannica|2008|p=162}} During the Late Joseon Dynasty, in the 19th century, [[Christianity]] began to gain a foothold in Korea.{{sfnp|Kim|2012}} While both Christianity and Buddhism would play important roles in the resistance to the [[Japanese occupation of Korea]] in the first half of the 20th century,{{sfnp|Yu|2012|p=xv}} only about 4% of Koreans were members of a religious organization in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making Sense of the Secular: Critical Perspectives from Europe to Asia|last=Baker|first=Don|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1136277214|editor-last=Ghosh|editor-first=Ranjan|location=|pages=182–193|chapter=Korea's Path of Secularisation|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0v7ipRmW6M0C&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=page182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[division of Korea]] into two sovereign states in 1945—[[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]]—religious life in the two countries has diverged, shaped by different political structures. [[Religion in South Korea]] has been characterized by a rise of Christianity and a revival of Buddhism, though the majority of South Koreans have [[Irreligion in South Korea|no religious affiliation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RCBe9w9C2UkC&amp;printsec=frontcover|title=Korean Spirituality|last=Baker|first=Donald L.|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0824832339|location=|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kosis.kr/statHtml/statHtml.do?orgId=101&amp;tblId=DT_1PM1502&amp;conn_path=I2|title=성, 연령 및 종교별 인구 - 시군구|last=|first=|date=2015|website=Korean Statistical Information Service|language=ko|trans-title=Population by Gender, Age, and Religion - City/Country|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Religion in North Korea]] is characterized by [[state atheism]] in which [[Freedom of religion in North Korea|freedom of religion]] is nonexistent.

'''Ronald M. Enroth''' (born October 28, 1938) has been a Professor of Sociology at [[Westmont College]]&lt;ref name="Westmont"&gt;

==Academic career==
Enroth is a graduate of [[Houghton College]] and earned his M.A. and Ph.D. at the [[University of Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="Westmont"/&gt; He began his career in teaching sociology during his doctoral studies, and held the post of an instructor at [[Westmont College]] from 1965-67. He was appointed as an assistant professor (1967–71), and then associate professor (1971–76) at Westmont. He became a full professor in 1976.

Although Enroth's doctoral work was in the field of medical sociology, he has pursued research and teaching in the [[sociology of religion]], [[new religious movements]], social problems, and the sociology of deviant behavior. He holds memberships within four professional organizations: American Sociological Association, Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, [[American Academy of Religion]], and the Association for the Sociology of Religion.

Enroth won the [[Leo J. Ryan]] commemorative award in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://griess.st1.at/enroth.htm Bio Sheet, Ronald M. Enroth, June 1, 1996.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Westmont2"&gt;http://www.westmont.edu/_offices/provost/documents/Faculty_C_V/Enroth,%20Ron%20F2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

In 1987 he delivered the Tanner Annual Lecture at the [[Trinity Evangelical Divinity School]], [[Deerfield, Illinois|Deerfield]], [[Illinois]]. In 1994, Westmont College awarded Enroth twice for both Faculty Researcher of the Year and also Teacher of the Year in Social Sciences.&lt;ref name="Westmont"/&gt;

==Writings==
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2015}}
Enroth has written, co-written and edited a number of books and essays where he presents an evangelical interpretation of the sociology of cults and new religious movements. He has also written and edited works specifically concerned with the evangelization of adherents of cults.

He was an early chronicler of the countercultural movement within [[evangelicalism]] that was known in the 1970s as the [[Jesus People]] movement or the Jesus revolution movement. His co-written book ''The Jesus People'' covered para-church organizations that held to Christian orthodox doctrines, and also examined controversial groups whose orthodoxy was open to dispute among evangelicals (such as the [[Family International|Children of God]].)

Another early work of his examined the emergence, sociology and [[theology]] of gay churches within [[Protestant]]ism.

In the late 1970s he wrote ''Youth, Brainwashing and the Extremist Cults'', where he explored the dynamics of conversion and member participation through some case studies of various controversial minority religious groups such as: [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] (ISKCON), [[Family International|Children of God]], [[Alamo Christian Foundation]], the [[Love Family]], the [[Unification Church]], the [[Way International]], and the [[Divine Light Mission]]. Enroth argued there were characteristics to cult commitment that were aberrant, such as the separation of youth from their families, intensive and manipulative activities of instruction and recruitment, and tests of loyalty to the group. He argued that the sociological and psychological processes of recruitment and [[indoctrination]] involved some form of [[brainwashing]] or [[mind control]]. The final part of his study explored the spiritual problems he discerned with cults from the standpoint of evangelical Christianity.

Although Enroth argued in support of the brainwashing theory of cult conversions, he was nonetheless very critical of the tactics of secular anti-cult individuals who engaged in [[deprogramming]]. In the early 1980s Enroth criticized the views of the deprogrammer [[Ted Patrick]]. In an interview with Neil Duddy, Enroth rejected deprogramming as a remedy for dealing with cults. [[J. Gordon Melton]] also reported Enroth's views about opposing deprogramming in ''[[Christianity Today]]'' magazine.

During the mid-1980s Enroth had a formal and frank exchange of views with [[J. Gordon Melton]] on a range of questions and methodological approaches to studying cults. This dialogue first appeared in an abridged version in ''Christianity Today'' in March 1984, and was then expanded into a book ''Why Cults Succeed Where The Church Fails''. One of the important outcomes of this dialogue was an agreement between Enroth and Melton that a technically precise demarcation was needed to differentiate the [[Christian countercult movement]] from the secular [[anti-cult movement]].

Enroth complained that Melton, together with co-author [[Robert L. Moore]], had lumped Christians in with secularists in their 1982 book ''The Cult Experience''. Enroth also accused [[David G. Bromley|David Bromley]], [[Anson Shupe]], and Lowell Streiker, of committing the same error in their writings. Enroth stated: "I recognize the distinction Gordon was mentioning between the Christian and the secular anticult movement, but he doesn't, unfortunately, make the distinction in his published writing. We're all painted with the same brush." (p.&amp;nbsp;30). Melton, who acknowledged the distinct differences between the two movements, promised to rectify this point in his writings. In the 1986 edition of his ''Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America'' Melton introduced [[religious studies]] scholars to the neologism Christian countercult as a means of demarcating it from the secular anti-cult movement.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s Enroth turned his attention on to the subject of marginal or fringe churches. In his studies Enroth has pinpointed church groups that operate outside mainstream denominations that promote a legalist understanding of the gospel, and operate with manipulative processes of membership. He discusses these problems in ''[[Churches That Abuse]]'' and ''Recovering from Churches That Abuse''.

==Cults and evangelism==
{{BLP unsourced section|date= August 2015}}
Although Enroth has explored sociological questions in many of his books, he has also been an advocate of Christian evangelism toward members of so-called cults and new religious movements. In his book ''Evangelizing the Cults'' he recommends that Christians explain the gospel message to adherents. He emphasizes the role of prayer in this activity. Enroth urges Christians to adopt the style of evangelism used by St.Paul in his Areopagus speech in affirming the search while unwavering from the gospel.

In his recent{{when|date=October 2014}} text ''A Guide to New Religious Movements'', Enroth reiterates many of these points. However he also suggests that Christians follow the example set in Christian missions' literature of understanding the customs, culture and beliefs of groups and adopting a less confrontational attitude in evangelism and [[apologetics]].

==Praise==
In general, Enroth's writings have been acknowledged in Christian circles as significant contributions on the subject of "cults". In 1992 [[J. Gordon Melton]] made special mention of Enroth as an important figure in the [[Christian countercult movement]]. Unlike most of the apologists who concentrate on doctrinal questions, Enroth is distinguished as one of the few writers in the movement to both hold credentials in sociology and to apply sociological tools in his analyses. Melton stated that Enroth was "the single most widely read of the Evangelical Christian counter-cult writers." &lt;ref&gt;Melton, J.G. 1992. Encyclopedic Handbook of Cults in America: Garland Pub.&lt;/ref&gt;

==JPUSA Controversy==
In 1993, Enroth's book ''Recovering from Churches That Abuse'' set off a "firestorm of debate among religious scholars," centered around a chapter on the group [[Jesus People USA]] which included several stories of alleged abuse within the group.&lt;ref name="CommuneIronGrip"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James T. Richardson]], former president of the [[Association for the Sociology of Religion]] and currently Professor of [[Sociology]] and [[Judicial Studies]] ([[University of Nevada, Reno]]), criticized Enroth's book and research methods in an issue of [[JPUSA]]'s [[Cornerstone]] magazine, writing in part:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Enroth's book can be viewed as another in a long line of popular books that teach people how to become good victims by reinterpreting their past. Ironically, this thoroughly non-sociological book makes use of a sociological truth--that people are constantly reinterpreting their past to make their view of that past more functional for their present--as he delivers the message that people's problems are not really their fault. Someone else is always to blame. This line of thought is controversial from several perspectives, of course, including the theological and the therapeutic. ... Enroth reminds the reader several times that he is a sociologist, thus implying that he is doing sociology in the book, but this slim volume is not sociological. There is no attempt to sample properly, or to limit generalizations in any explicit way. There is no effort to discuss the issue of self-serving accounts that plague all such books of this 'anticult' bent, and there is a glossing over of the writer's own particular religious persuasion. Furthermore, there is virtually no recognition of the considerable scholarly research that might be used to counter the apparent thesis of Enroth, who seems to believe that religious groups that require heavy discipline and commitment should be avoided in favor of less demanding mainstream groups.&lt;ref&gt;

JPUSA elders, who attempted to convince Enroth to remove the chapter prior to the release of the book, referred to the chapter as "poison in the well." [[Ruth Tucker]], a professor at [[Trinity Evangelical Divinity School]] also defended [[JPUSA]] saying Enroth was "sadly misdirected and his research methods seriously flawed."&lt;ref name="CommuneIronGrip"/&gt;

In defense of Enroth's work, [[Paul R. Martin]], the director of [[Wellspring Retreat and Resource Center]], one of the few residential treatment centers in the world for former members of [[cult]]s and "abusive groups," supported Enroth's findings, saying that his facility had seen a flood of requests for help from former members and that JPUSA "displays virtually every sign that I watch for in overly [[authoritarian]] and totalistic groups."&lt;ref name="CommuneIronGrip"/&gt;

Ronald Enroth himself responded to the controversy (some of which had occurred prior to the release of the book) in the book itself, in part with:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There has been much correspondence between leaders of the Covenant Church and JPUSA and me since I began to do the research for this book. They have questioned the integrity of my reports, the reliability of my respondents, and my sociological methodology, but I have conducted more than seventy hours of in-depth interviews and telephone conversations with more than forty former members of JPUSA. They have also largely discounted the reports of abusive conditions past and present in the JPUSA community. ... Unwilling to admit serious deficiencies and insensitivity in their pastoral style, the leaders of JPUSA have instead sought to discredit the former members who have cooperated with my research efforts.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As a result of the book's chapter on JPUSA, according to a later newspaper article, "scores" of members read it and decided to leave the group.&lt;ref name="CommuneIronGrip2"&gt;

'''Satyananda Saraswati''' (25 December 1923 – 5 December 2009), was a [[sannyasin]], [[yoga]] teacher and [[guru]] in both his native [[India]] and the West. He was a student of [[Sivananda Saraswati]], the founder of the [[Divine Life Society]], and founded the [[Bihar School of Yoga]] in 1964.{{sfnp|Melton|2010|p=1483}} He wrote over 80 books, including ''Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha''.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Satyananda Saraswati was born 1923 at Almora, [[Uttaranchal]],{{sfnp|Aveling|1994|p=60}} into a family of farmers and [[zamindar]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

As a youth he was classically educated and studied [[Sanskrit]], the [[Vedas]] and the [[Upanishads]]. He says that he began to have spiritual experiences at the age of six, when his awareness spontaneously left the body and he saw himself lying motionless on the floor. Many saints and [[sadhu]]s blessed him and reassured his parents that he had a very developed awareness. This experience of disembodied awareness continued, which led him to many saints of that time such as [[Anandamayi Ma]]. He also met a [[Tantra|tantric]] [[bhairavi]], [[Sukhman Giri]], who gave him [[shaktipat]] and directed him to find a guru to stabilise his spiritual experiences.{{sfnp|Saraswati|2004}}{{page needed|date=December 2014}} However, in one of his early publications, ''Yoga from Shore to Shore'', he says he would become unconscious during meditation and that "One day I met a mahatma, a great saint, who was passing by my birthplace...So he told me I should find a guru." {{sfnp|Saraswati|1974|p=8}}

At age eighteen, he left his home to seek a spiritual master. In 1943 at the age of twenty, he met his [[guru]] [[Sivananda Saraswati]] and went to live at Sivananda's ashram in [[Rishikesh]].{{sfnp|Melton|2010|p=1483}} Sivananda initiated him into the Dashnam Order of Sannyasa on 12 September 1947 on the banks of the Ganges and gave him the name of Swami Satyananda Saraswati. He stayed with Sivananda for a further nine years but received little formal instruction from him.{{sfnp|Aveling|1994|p=60}}

===Bihar School of Yoga===
In 1956, Sivananda sent Satyananda away to spread his teachings. Basing himself in [[Munger]], [[Bihar]], he wandered as a mendicant travelling through India, [[Afghanistan]], [[Nepal]], [[Burma]] and [[Ceylon]] for the next seven years (although on several occasions he said he travelled only through India{{sfnp|Saraswati|1974|p=10, 72}}), extending his knowledge of spiritual practices and spending some time in seclusion.{{sfnp|Aveling|1994|p=60}}

In 1962 Satyananda established the International Yoga Fellowship Movement (IYFM) in [[Rajnandgaon]].{{sfnp|Aveling|1994|p=60}}{{sfnp|Saraswati|2011|p=159}} IYFM inspired the  establishment of ashrams and yoga centers spiritually guided by Swami Satyananda in India and all over the world.{{sfnp|Aveling|1994|p=61}}{{sfnp|Melton|2010|p=1483}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2006/gjuly06/iyfm.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;  
In 1964, he founded the [[Bihar School of Yoga]] (BSY) at Munger,{{sfnp|Melton|2010|p=1483}}{{sfnp|Saraswati|2011|p=188}} with the intention that it would act as a centre of training for future teachers of yoga as well as offer courses on yoga.{{sfnp|Aveling|1994|p=61}}

Among those who attended courses at BSY were students from abroad and students who subsequently emigrated from India. Some of these people in turn invited Satyananda to teach in their own countries. He lectured and taught for the next twenty years, including a tour of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, North America between April and October 1968. The foreign and expatriate students also established new centres of teaching in their respective countries.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

===Seclusion===
In 1988 Satyananda handed over the active work of his ashram and organisation to his spiritual successor, [[Niranjanananda Saraswati]], and left Munger.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

From September 1989 he was in Rikhia, [[Deoghar]], [[Jharkhand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lifepositive.com/body/yoga/swami-satyananda.asp |title=Paramhamsa Swami Satyananda, the Sadhana of a Sage |publisher=life-positive.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718223705/http://www.lifepositive.com/body/yoga/swami-satyananda.asp |archivedate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he lived as a [[paramahamsa]] sannyasin and performed vedic sadhanas including panchagni, an austerity performed before five blazing fires outdoors during the hottest months of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2002/esep02/panch.shtml |title=Panchagni – the Bath of Fire |first=Satyasangananda |last=Saraswati}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Rikhia, Satyananda conducted a 12-year Rajasooya Yajna which began in 1995 with the first Sat Chandi Maha Yajna, invoking the Cosmic Mother through a tantric ceremony. During this event, Satyananda passed on his spiritual and sannyasa sankalpa to Niranjanananda.&lt;ref&gt;''Past, Present and Future: consolidated history of Bihar School of Yoga'', Swami Yogakanti, Swami Yogawandana (eds.), 2009, Yoga Publications Trust&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on 5 December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.yogamag.net/yogas/3synop.shtml|title=Yoga Magazine - Synopsis of the Life of Swami Satyananda Saraswati|website=www.yogamag.net|access-date=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
Satyananda's teachings emphasise an "Integral Yoga" with a strong emphasis on [[Tantra]], known as the "Bihar Yoga" system or "Satyananda Yoga". This system addresses the qualities of head, heart and hands – intellect, emotion and action -  and attempts to integrate the physical, psychological and spiritual dimensions of yoga into each practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yogamag.net/archives/2000/ajan00/growth.shtml|title=The Growth of Satyananda Yoga or Bihar Yoga |first=Niranjanananda |last=Saraswati |accessdate=9 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His system of tantric yoga involves the practice of:
* [[Kundalini Yoga]], in the tradition following Sivananda's explanation. Kundalini Yoga is the yoga of the evolutionary energy of the universe.
* [[Kriyā|Kriya Yoga]] through the practices of pratyahara, dharana and dhyana, which are the three
components of Kriya yoga, in combination with other practices such as asana, pranayama, mudras
and badhas. Kriya Yoga aims to awaken the dimensions of consciousness where our dormant potential
and creativity lies. 
* [[mantra|Mantra Yoga]], the repetition of sacred sounds.
* [[Laya yoga]], the practice of a state of absorption on an object of meditation.
* The four advanced stages of the Eight Limbs of Yoga as codified by [[Patanjali]]: [[Pratyahara]], [[Dharana]], [[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]] and [[Samādhi|Samadhi]].

Satyananda classified and expounded the techniques given in the tantras as a series of different stages and levels of pratyahara, such as antar mouna, and different stages of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;Meditations From the Tantras, Satyananda Saraswati, Yoga Publications Trust&lt;/ref&gt; He invented a technique of [[yoga-nidra]], now known worldwide as Satyananda Yoga Nidra, and defined and codified the different stages of the technique.&lt;ref&gt;Yoga Nidra, Swami Satyananda Saraswati, Yoga Publications Trust&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Satyananda wrote over 80 books, including ''Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha''. Satyananda's writings have been published by the Bihar School of Yoga and, since 2000, by the Yoga Publications Trust established by his disciple Niranjanananda to promote his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yoga Publications Trust |publisher=Satyananda Yoga |url=http://www.sypublications.com/en/satyananda-yoga/yoga-publications-trust.html |accessdate=2014-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227194249/http://www.sypublications.com/en/satyananda-yoga/yoga-publications-trust.html |archivedate=27 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tbilisi Cathedral, 1900s.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The Tbilisi [[Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, Tiflis|Alexander Nevsky Orthodox Cathedral]] was demolished in 1930 to make way for the [[Parliament of Georgia|House of Government]] of the [[Georgian SSR]].]]
'''Secularism and irreligion''' in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] was most popular in the 20th century when the country was part of the [[Soviet Union]]. In the 21st century, secular and non-religious currents have seen a precipitous decline due to the rising popularity of the [[Georgian Orthodox Church]] and the fact that religious faith in general “has become fashionable” in Georgian society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insightb/articles/eav021109.shtml Georgia: Faith Is the Fashion, as Church Influence Soars] [[Eurasianet]], 10 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex and childbearing out of wedlock==

According to a 2015 statistically sampled opinion research, 37% of the Georgian population thought that childbearing by women outside of wedlock (a [[sin]] for most traditional faiths in Georgia) was sometimes or always justified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caucasusbarometer.org/en/eu2015ge/JUSTWOMCH/ Knowledge and attitudes toward the EU in Georgia, 2015 : woman bearing a child without marriage (%)], [[Caucasus Research Resource Centers]], Retrieved: 30 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Georgian public opinion on the matter of pre-marital sex (also a sin for traditional faiths in Georgia), showed different levels of tolerance for women and men: 23% of the public thought that female pre-marital sex was sometimes or always justified,&lt;ref&gt;[http://caucasusbarometer.org/en/eu2015ge/JUSTWOMSEX/ Knowledge and attitudes toward the EU in Georgia, 2015 : woman having sex before marriage (%)], [[Caucasus Research Resource Centers]], Retrieved: 30 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; but a higher 55% thought the same about male pre-marital sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caucasusbarometer.org/en/eu2015ge/JUSTMANSEX/ Knowledge and attitudes toward the EU in Georgia, 2015 : man having sex before marriage (%)], [[Caucasus Research Resource Centers]], Retrieved: 30 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abortion==
{{further|Abortion in Georgia (country)}}

Although the Georgian Orthodox Church views [[abortion]] as a "terrible sin",&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=26028 Georgian Orthodox Church Calls for Anti-Abortion Law], [[Civil Georgia]] 7 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and 69% of Georgians say they can never justify abortion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://caucasusbarometer.org/en/cb2013ge/JUSABOR/ Caucasus Barometer 2013 Georgia: Always justified/never justified: Having an abortion (%)], [[Caucasus Research Resource Centers]], Retrieved: 30 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; as of 2005 a Georgian woman was estimated to have an average of three abortions in her lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/georgia-sex-selection-abortion/24979979.html Georgians Wrestle With Abortion Issue As Gender Imbalance Grows], [[RFERL]], 8 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, the abortion rates have been somewhat reduced, but due to the increase in the use of [[contraception]] among Georgians, which the Church also condemns.&lt;ref&gt;Haley Edwards, [http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/from-abortion-to-contraception-in-georgia/?_r=1 From Abortion to Contraception], [[New York Times]], 20 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homosexuality==

{{further|LGBT rights in Georgia (country)}}
{{see also|2013 Tbilisi anti-homophobia rally protests}}

Georgian population maintains negative views about [[homosexuality]].However according to a 2013 statistically sampled survey of [[Tbilisi]] on the subject of [[2013 Tbilisi anti-homophobia rally protests|anti-gay violence]], 87% of residents said that violence is "always unacceptable" and 91% agreed that "everyone should be equal before the law - including the [[clergy]]". At the same time, 57% thought that clergy who participated in violence against [[LGBT]] persons should not face trial. 40% of respondents disagreed with the notion that church should be intolerant towards sexual minorities, 45% agreed with church intolerance of sexual minorities, while 15% were uncertain. 57% stated that the successful organization of a peaceful demonstration marking the annual [[IDAHOT]] would endanger Georgia in some way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crrccenters.org/2088/Survey-on-the-May-17th-Events-in-Tbilisi Survey on the May 17th Events in Tbilisi], [[Caucasus Research Resource Centers]], 26 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;According to 2011 social attitude questionnaires, homosexuals remained one of the most disliked groups in society&amp;nbsp;– with most respondents preferring an alcoholic rather than homosexual colleague at work.&lt;ref&gt;Lomsadze, Giorgi. [http://www.eurasianet.org/node/62902 Georgia: Time for Homosexuality to Come Out of the Closet?] EurasiaNet.Org. Published:15 February 2011. Retrieved:25 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same questionnaires, an estimated 91.5 percent of Georgians think that homosexuality is "completely unacceptable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/62902|title=Georgia: Time for Homosexuality to Come Out of the Closet?|work=EurasiaNet.org|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges to secular governance==
Article 9 of the current [[Constitution of Georgia (country)|Constitution of Georgia]] guarantees "complete freedom of belief and religion."  While recognizing the "special role ... in the history of Georgia" of the Georgian Orthodox Church (GOC), the Church remains separate of the State.&lt;ref name=Constitution&gt;{{cite web | title=Constitution of Georgia (in English) | url=http://www.parliament.ge/files/68_1944_951190_CONSTIT_27_12.06.pdf | publisher=[[Parliament of Georgia]] | accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A special [[Concordat of 2002|Concordat]] (legal agreement) between the Georgian state and the GOC was ratified in 2002, giving the GOC special legal rights not given to other religious groups—including immunity for the Georgian Orthodox Patriarch, exemption from military service for GOC clergy, and a consultative role in education and other aspects of the government. 

In December 2015, the head of GOC [[Ilia II]] stated that he would like to have the power to grant pardons to individuals convicted of crimes, which is a power afforded by the Georgian Constitution only to the President. The proposal caused a backlash among Georgian civil society groups, who warned against creeping "theocracy". The [[Chairperson of the Parliament of Georgia|Speaker of the Parliament]] [[David Usupashvili]] politely dismissed the Patriarch's idea, saying that issuing pardons and forgiving sins are two separate matters and that legal pardons are a prerogative of the Head of State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=28834 Parliament Speaker Comments on Patriarch’s Request on Pardon Powers], [[Civil Georgia]] 6 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Following the backlash, GOC backtracked Patriarch's request for pardon powers, saying that it was made after meeting with prison inmates in a "very emotional" atmosphere and that the idea was to be taken as an expression of compassion towards the inmates, and "not as a demand to discuss this proposal at a legislative level".&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=28836 Georgian Church ‘Explains’ Patriarch’s Remarks on Pardon Powers], [[Civil Georgia]] 7 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, GOC unsuccessfully lobbied the Georgian government to ban abortions, which it described as a "terrible sin" and "heinous murder", while blaming it for the supposed "grave demographic situation" in the country. Georgia's then Prime Minister [[Bidzina Ivanishvili]] brushed off the proposal, stating that solving demographic problems "first and foremost needs economic development".&lt;ref&gt;[http://civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=26028 Georgian Orthodox Church Calls for Anti-Abortion Law], [[Civil Georgia]] 7 December 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Sikh]] is required by the [[Sikh Gurus]] to live a disciplined life by doing pure and righteous deeds and actions. The following are the list of activities that a Sikh should engages in:

[[5 Banis]] - The initiated Sikh is asked by the [[Panj Piare]] during the [[Amrit Sanchar]] ceremony to recite the following 5 banis every morning as a commitment to the [[Sikh Gurus]] and [[Waheguru]].  The 5 Banis are: [[Japji Sahib]], [[Jaap Sahib]], [[Anand Sahib]], [[Chaupai (Sikhism)|Benti Chaupai]] and [[Tav parsad Savaiye]] - these banis are usually recited daily by all devoted Sikhs in the early morning.

[[Image:Sikh Articles of Faith.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Kanga, Kara and Kirpan - three of the five articles of faith endowed to the Sikhs by Guru Gobind Singh]]
[[Five Ks]] or ''panj kakaar/kakke'', are five items of faith that baptised [[Khalsa]] [[Sikh]]s wear at all times at the command of the tenth Sikh [[Guru]], [[Guru Gobind Singh]] who so ordered at the [[Baisakhi]] [[Amrit Sanchar]] in 1699. The Five Ks are not merely symbols but articles of faith which collectively form the external visible symbols to identify and clearly and outwardly advertise and display one's commitment and dedication to the order ([[Hukam]]) of the tenth master. Guru Gobind Singh ordered his followers to wear the Five Ks so that they could actively use them to make a difference to their own and to others' spirituality.  However, Sikhism recognises the concept of a [[Sikhism Other Observations|multi-level approach]] to achieving one's target as a disciple of the faith as well. For example, “Sahajdhari” (slow adopters) are those Sikhs who have not yet donned the full Five Ks.

[[Five Thieves]] or pancadokh or panj vikar as they are referred to in [[Sikh Scripture]], the [[Guru Granth Sahib]], are, according to [[Sikhism]], the five thieves that steal the senses of the human personality and sre at variance with its spiritual essence.These five "thieves" comprise [[Kam]] (Lust), [[Krodh]] (Rage), [[Lobh]] (Greed), [[Moh]] (Attachment) and [[Ahankar]] (ego) in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].

[[Five Virtues]] - For [[Sikh]]s, the final goal of life is to reunite or merge with God ([[Moksha|Mukti]]). The [[Sikh Gurus]] taught that to achieve this goal it was important to work hard at developing '''positive human qualities''' which lead the soul closer to God. The [[Gurus]] taught that all human beings have the '''qualities they need to reunite with God''' but they must train their minds to make the most of these qualities. In order to reach the final goal of life, [[Sikh]]s believe that they must constantly develop their '''love for God''' by developing '''compassion for all God’s creation'''.

[[Simran (Sanskrit word)|Simran]] - In [[Sikhism]], '''Simran''' ({{Lang-pa|ਸਿਮਰਨ}}) refers to the repetition or recital of the God Names:  [[Nām]] or of the [[Holy Text]] from the Two Granths of the Sikhs: the Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]] and the [[Dasam Granth]]. The word is derived from [[Sanskrit]] word ''smarana'' meaning Remembrance. Also translates to ‘Meditation’ – The verb ''Simar'', which is derived from ''Simran'' means ''meditating''.

[[Selfless service|Sewa]] - To perform selfless service, without any thought of reward or personal benefit. All Sikhs are encouraged by their Guru (Shiri Guru Granth Sahib) to perform Seva or Selfless Service. This is not only good for community relations but also is good for the moral upliftent. You will find Sikhs engaged in free service in [[Gurdwara]]s washing dishes or cleaning the floors, etc. Sikhs are also encouraged to help the community by performing unpaid work in Hospitals, Old Peoples' Homes, Community Centres, etc.

'''[[Three pillars of Sikhism]]'''
* The Guru led the Sikhs directly to practise [[Simran (Sanskrit word)|Simran]] and [[Naam Japna]] – meditation on God and reciting and chanting of God’s name - [[Waheguru]]. The Sikh is to recite the [[Nitnem]] [[Gurbani|banis]] daily in remembrance of the grace and [[kirpa]] of the Almighty.
* He asked the Sikhs to live as householders and practise [[Kirat Karni]] – To honestly earn by ones physical and mental effort while accepting God's gifts and blessing. One is to speak the truth at all times and only fear God. Live a life of decency, high moral values and spirituality.
* The Sikhs were asked to share their wealth within the community by practising [[Vand Chakna]] – “Share and Consume together”. The community or [[Sadh Sangat]] is an important part of [[Sikhism]]. One must be part of a community that is pursuing the values set out by the [[Sikh Gurus]] and every Sikh has to give in whatever way possible to the community. This spirit of '''Giving''' is an important message from [[Guru Nanak]].

On May 31, 2014, in [[Waukesha, Wisconsin]], 12-year-olds Anissa Weier and Morgan Geyser lured their friend Payton Leutner into the woods and stabbed her 19 times in an attempt to impress the fictional character [[Slender Man]]. Leutner crawled to a road where she was found; she recovered after six days in the hospital. Weier and Geyser were found [[insanity defense|not guilty by reason of insanity]] and, by February 2018, convicted and sentenced to long periods in mental health institutions.

==Background==
{{further|Slender Man}}
Slender Man is a fictional entity created for a 2009 [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] contest on [[Something Awful]], an online forum, the goal of which was to create [[paranormal]] images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Shira|last1=Chess|title=Open-Sourcing Horror|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=London, England|date=1 April 2012|volume=15|issue=3|pages=374–375|doi=10.1080/1369118X.2011.642889|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118x.2011.642889|issn=1369-118X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Slender Man mythos was later expanded by a number of other people who created [[fan fiction]] and additional artistic depictions of the entity.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Abigail|last=Jones|title=The Girls Who Tried to Kill for Slender Man|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2014/08/22/girls-who-tried-kill-slender-man-264218.html|work=[[Newsweek]]|publisher=[[IBT Media/Newsweek Media Group]]|location=New York City|date=August 22, 2014|accessdate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slender Man is a tall, thin character, with a featureless white face and head. He is depicted as wearing a black suit, and is sometimes shown with [[tentacle]]s growing out of his back. According to the Slender Man mythos, the entity can cause [[amnesia]], bouts of coughing and [[Paranoia|paranoid behavior]] in individuals. He is often depicted hiding in forests or stalking children.&lt;ref name=newsweek /&gt;

Weier, Geyser, and Leutner were all 12 years old at the time of the stabbing, and were classmates enrolled in the same school. Their principal later said that none had any disciplinary issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Christina|last1=Palladino|title=Principal says stabbing suspects were good students, no history of bad behavior |url=http://www.wisn.com/news/principal-says-stabbing-suspects-were-good-students-no-history-of-bad-behavior/26336494|website=ABC Wisconsin|date=June 5, 2014 |accessdate=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had been at a sleepover together the night before the stabbing.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite web |first=Jason|last=Hanna| url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/03/justice/wisconsin-girl-stabbed/ | title=12 year-old Wisconsin girl stabbed 19 times; friends arrested | work=[[CNN]] | date=June 3, 2014 | accessdate=February 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The attackers had discovered Slender Man on the Creepypasta Wiki, a website that hosts [[creepypasta]]. They later said they had believed Slender Man to be real, and had wanted to prove their loyalty to him so they could become his "proxies", prove his existence, and prevent him from harming their families; they believed that the only way to do this would be to kill someone,&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt; after which they would become servants of the Slender Man and live in his mansion, which they thought was located in [[Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest|Nicolet National Forest]].&lt;ref name="nbc"&gt;{{cite web |first=Elisha|last=Fieldstadt |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/slender-man-stabbing/slender-man-stabbing-suspects-blamed-each-other-interrogations-n310176 | title='Slender Man' Stabbing Suspects Blamed Each Other in Interrogations | work=NBC News | date=February 22, 2015 | accessdate=February 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attack==
Weier and Geyser initially planned to attack Leutner on May 30, 2014, during a sleepover. They planned to tape the victim's mouth shut, stab her in the neck, and flee. They did not carry out that attack; Geyser is believed to have wanted to give Leutner one more day to live.&lt;ref name=newsweek /&gt; A second plan called for attacking Leutner in a bathroom at a local park.&lt;ref name=newsweek /&gt;

The actual attack took place in a nearby forest during a game of hide-and-seek on May 31, 2014. Leutner was pinned down and stabbed 19 times in the arms, legs, and torso with a five-inch-long (13 cm) kitchen knife. Two wounds were to major arteries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Elahe|last=Izadi|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/08/10/slender-man-stabbing-13-year-old-wisconsin-girls-will-be-tried-as-adults/|title='Slender Man' stabbing: 13-year-old Wisconsin girls will be tried as adults|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=Nash h Holdings LLC|date=August 10, 2015 |access-date=September 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one missed her heart by less than a millimeter and the other went through her diaphragm, cutting into her liver and stomach.&lt;ref name="effron"&gt;{{cite web|first=Lauren|last=Effron|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/slender-man-stabbing-survivors-parents-describe-horrific-ordeal/story?id=25787516|title=Slender Man stabbing survivor's parents: 'She's Meant to Do Something Special'|date=September 26, 2014|work=ABC News|accessdate=February 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weier and Geyser then told Leutner they would get help for her, but instead simply left.&lt;ref name=newsweek /&gt; Leutner dragged herself to a nearby road where she was found by a cyclist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first1=Monica|last1=Davey|first2=Steven|last2=Yaccino|title=Milwaukee Suburb Tries to Cope With Girl’s Stabbing |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/us/milwaukee-suburb-tries-to-cope-with-slender-man-stabbing.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=June 7, 2014 |accessdate=May 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weier and Geyser were apprehended near [[Interstate 94]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Christopher|last=Kuhagen |title=Waukesha stabbing sends chills even through police|url=http://www.waukeshanow.com/news/waukesha-stabbing-sends-chills-even-through-police-b99282661z1-261612201.html|newspaper=Waukesha Now|publisher=Now News Group|location=Waukesha, Wisconsin|date=June 2, 2014|accessdate=May 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The knife used in the stabbing was in a bag they carried. Weier and Geyser were described as feeling guilty for stabbing their friend, but felt that the attack was needed to appease Slender Man.&lt;ref name=newsweek /&gt;

Members of the creepypasta community held a 24-hour live stream on [[YouTube]] June 13-14, 2014, to raise money for the stabbing victim. Joe Jozwowski, an administrator on a creepypasta website, said the purpose of the stream was to show that members of the community wanted to help the victim and to demonstrate that they were not horrible people just because they liked scary stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sanchick|first1=Myra|title=CreepyPasta narrators organize to raise money for stabbing victim|url=http://fox6now.com/2014/06/05/creepy-pasta-narrators-rally-plan-to-raise-money-for-stabbing-victim/|website=fox6now.com|date=June 13, 2014 |accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, Wisconsin Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] issued a proclamation declaring Wednesday, August 13, 2014, "Purple Hearts for Healing Day" and encouraged the people of Wisconsin to wear purple on that day to honor the victim of the stabbing. He also praised the "strength and determination" exhibited by the victim during her recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Governor Scott Walker Issues Proclamation Declaring "Purple Hearts for Healing Day" in Honor of Waukesha Girl|url=http://walker.wi.gov/newsroom/press-release/governor-scott-walker-issues-proclamation-declaring-%E2%80%9Cpurple-hearts-healing|website=Office of the Governor|accessdate=October 18, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015181348/http://walker.wi.gov/newsroom/press-release/governor-scott-walker-issues-proclamation-declaring-%E2%80%9Cpurple-hearts-healing|archivedate=October 15, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Madison, Wisconsin]], held a one-day [[bratwurst]] festival to honor the victim on August 29, several days before the victim returned to school. [[Hot dog]]s and bratwurst were sold to raise money towards the victim's medical costs. The event was run by over 250 volunteers, and raised over $70,000 for the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Robinson|first1=Kelley|title='Slender Man' Stabbing Survivor Returns to School|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/slender-man-stabbing-survivor-returns-school/story?id=25230582|website=ABC News|date=September 3, 2014 |accessdate=May 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate on the impact of the Internet on children===
The stabbing resulted in extensive debate about the role of the [[Internet]] in society and its impact on children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maddox|first1=Jessica|title=Of Internet born: idolatry, the Slender Man meme, and the feminization of digital spaces|journal=Feminist Media Studies|date=2017|volume=18|issue=2|pages=235–248|doi=10.1080/14680777.2017.1300179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell Jack, Waukesha Police Chief, said that the stabbing "should be a wake-up call for all parents", adding that the Internet "is full of information and wonderful sites that teach and entertain", but that it "can also be full of dark and wicked things".&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt; John Egelhof, a retired agent of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], argued that the Internet had become a "blackhole" with the ability to expose children to a more sinister world.&lt;ref name=black&gt;{{cite news|first1=Kristin|last1=Tillotson|title=How kids fall into the Internet's 'black hole'|publisher=Star Tribune|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |date=June 6, 2014|series=News|page=2OP|url=http://www.startribune.com/how-kids-fall-into-the-internet-s-black-hole/262182311/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the best way to avoid future incidents was for parents to keep track of their children's web habits and to educate them on the differences between right and wrong.&lt;ref name=black/&gt; Shira Chess, an assistant professor of mass media arts at the [[University of Georgia]], stated that creepypasta was no more dangerous than stories about [[vampire]]s or [[zombie]]s. She argued that creepypasta websites were beneficial, and that they gave people the opportunity to become better writers.&lt;ref name=procreepy&gt;{{cite news|first1=Farhad|last1=Manjoo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/10/technology/personaltech/slender-man-story-and-the-new-urban-legends.html|title=Urban Legends Told Online|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=July 10, 2014 |access-date=September 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary film on the incident called ''[[Beware the Slenderman]]'' was released by [[HBO Films]] in March 2016, and was broadcast on [[HBO]] on January 23, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Tommy|last1=DePaoliStaff|title=Slenderman Is Coming to HBO In A True-Crime Documentary|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/3813085|website=Movie Pilot|accessdate=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FairchildFamily1818Title.jpg|alt=Simple, unadorned book cover.|right|thumb|Title page from the first edition of ''The Fairchild Family, Part I'']]
'''''The History of the Fairchild Family''''' by [[Mary Martha Sherwood]] was a series of bestselling [[children's literature|children's books]] in nineteenth-century Britain. The three volumes, published in 1818, 1842 and 1847, detail the lives of the Fairchild children. Part I, which was in print for over a century, focuses on Emily, Lucy and Henry's realization of their "human depravity" ([[original sin]]) and their consequent need for redemption; Parts II and III emphasize more worldly lessons such as etiquette and virtuous [[consumerism]].&lt;ref name="Cutt, 76"&gt;Cutt, 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the nineteenth century, ''The Fairchild Family'' was renowned for its [[Literary realism|realistic]] portrayal of childhood and its humor, but Sherwood's book fell from favor as Britain became increasingly secularized and new fashions in children's literature came to dominate the literary scene, represented by works such as [[Lewis Carroll|Lewis Carroll's]] ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. In the twentieth century the books have most often been viewed as quintessential examples of the [[didactic]] style of children's writing popular before ''Alice''.&lt;ref name="Dawson, 270; Harper, 2-3"&gt;Dawson, 270; Harper, 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
[[Mary Martha Sherwood|Sherwood]] published the first part of ''The Fairchild Family'' in 1818 with the firm of [[John Hatchard]] in [[Piccadilly]], thereby assuring it "social distinction". Hatchard was associated with the [[Clapham Sect]] of [[Evangelicalism|evangelicals]], which included [[Hannah More]], and his customers were wealthy businessmen, [[landed gentry|gentry]], and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]].&lt;ref name=Cutt60&gt;Cutt, 60.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was popular, remaining in print until 1913. Urged by her readers, her printer and her own desire to capitalize on Part I's success, Sherwood published Parts II and III in 1842 and 1847, respectively.

==Structure of the text==
[[File:SherwoodFairchild1853.jpg|alt=A woman, a man, and a child sit outside on a wall under trees, with water in the background.|left|thumb|Frontispiece to an 1853 edition of ''The Fairchild Family'']]
''The Fairchild Family, Part I'' tells the story of a family striving towards godliness and consists of a series of lessons taught by the Fairchild parents to their three children (Emily, Lucy and Henry) regarding not only the proper orientation of their souls towards Heaven but also proper earthly morality (envy, greed, lying, disobedience, and fighting, for example, are immoral). The text incorporates a series of [[tract (literature)|tract]]-like stories into an overarching narrative in order to illustrate these moral lessons. The stories of the deaths of two neighborhood children, Charles Trueman and Miss Augusta Noble, for instance, help the Fairchild children to understand how and why they need to prepare their own hearts for salvation. The faithful and "true" Charles has a transcendent deathbed experience (much like [[Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens's]] Little Nell in ''[[The Old Curiosity Shop]]'' (1840–1)), suggesting that he was saved; by contrast, the heedless and disobedient Augusta, who plays with candles, burns up and is presumably damned.&lt;ref&gt;Vallone, 84-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parts II and III have a similar structure; an overarching narrative of the Fairchild family is interspersed with inset moral tales. Both are noticeably less evangelical than Part I. Part II begins with the recognition by the Fairchild parents that their children have "a new and divine nature, which works against your evil natures, causing you to know when you have done wrong, and making you truly and deeply sorrowful when you have committed a sin."&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, ''The History of the Fairchild Family, Part II'', 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Emily, Lucy and Henry have finally learned to discipline their own souls. Parts II and III focus to a greater extent on good breeding, virtuous consumption and one's duty to the poor than does Part I. One of the most important lessons that the children learn, for instance, is respect for their elders. Moreover, the [[gibbet]] to which the children had been taken to observe a rotting corpse and instructed regarding the spiritual perils of sibling rivalry in Part I, has disappeared in Part II; Henry and his father walk by the spot where it used to stand and note its absence.

In all three books, thematically-relevant prayers and hymns by the likes of [[Philip Doddridge]], [[Isaac Watts]], [[Charles Wesley]], [[William Cowper]] and [[Ann Taylor (poet)|Ann]] and [[Jane Taylor (poet)|Jane Taylor]] follow each chapter.&lt;ref&gt;Cutt, 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

===Evangelicalism===
The theme that dominates ''The Fairchild Family, Part I'' is the evangelical need to recognize one's innate "depravity" and prepare oneself for eternity.&lt;ref&gt;Cutt, 38–39; Demers, "Mrs. Sherwood and Hesba Stretton, 133.&lt;/ref&gt; In this volume, the most important lessons in life are "faith, resignation, and implicit obedience to the will of God."&lt;ref name="Cutt3839"&gt;Cutt, 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sherwood articulates this theology in the very first pages of the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mr. and Mrs. Fairchild loved and feared God, and had done so, by the mercy of God, ever since their younger days. They knew that their hearts were very bad, and that they could not be saved by any good thing they could do: on the contrary, that they were by nature fitted only for everlasting punishment: but they believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, and loved him for having died for them; and they knew he would save them, because he saves all those who trust in him.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, ''The History of the Fairchild Family'', 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The book encourages its readers to adopt these beliefs not only through its stories but also through its prayers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Hear, therefore, my prayer, O Lord, and send thy Holy Spirit to shew unto me the wickedness of my own heart; that I may hate myself, and know, that, had I my deserts, I should now be living with the devil in hell. [sic]&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, ''The Fairchild Family'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
But unlike previous [[allegorical]] literature with these themes, such as [[John Bunyan|John Bunyan's]] ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]'' (1678), Sherwood domesticated her story—all of the actions in the children's day-to-day lives are of supreme importance because they relate directly to their [[salvation]].&lt;ref name=Cutt66&gt;Cutt, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Emily, for example, succumbs to the temptation to eat some forbidden plums: “no eye was looking at her, but the eye of God, who sees every thing we do, and knows even the secret thoughts of the heart; but Emily, just at that moment, did not think of God."&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, ''The Fairchild Family'', 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Sherwood scholar M. Nancy Cutt argues, "the great overriding metaphor of all [Sherwood's] work is the representation of divine order by the harmonious family relationship (inevitably set in its own pastoral Eden). . . No writer made it clearer to her readers that the child who is dutiful within his family is blessed in the sight of God; or stressed more firmly that family bonds are but the earthly and visible end of a spiritual bond running up to the very throne of God."&lt;ref&gt;Cutt, 41; see also Vallone, 85 and Harper, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This is made clear in the Fairchild parents' description of their own authority:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whilst you are a little child, you must tell your sins to me; and I will shew [sic] you the way by which only you may hope to overcome them: when you are bigger, and I and your papa are removed from you, then you must tell all your sins to God.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, ''The Fairchild Family'', 48.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Children's literature scholar Patricia Demers has referred to this connection between the family and the divine as the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] element in Sherwood's writing, arguing that her "characters’ zeal in finding and defining an earthly home prompts their almost automatic longing for a heavenly home. Sherwood's is a consciously double vision, glimpsing the eternal in the natural, the sublime in the quotidian."&lt;ref&gt;Demers, "Mrs. Sherwood and Hesba Stretton," 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

All three parts of ''The Fairchild Family'' "taught the lessons of personal endurance, reliance on Providence, and acceptance of one's earthly status."&lt;ref name=P4167&gt;Peterson, 416-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasizing individual experience and one's personal relationship with God, they discouraged readers from attributing their successes or failures to "larger economic and political forces."&lt;ref name=P4167/&gt; This is particularly true for the poor characters in the texts, such as the Truemans in the first volume and the beggar children, Jane and Edward, in the second volume.

===Victorianism===
Parts II and III reflect Sherwood's changing values as well as those of the [[Victorian era|Victorian period]]. Significantly, the servants in Part I, "who are almost part of the family, are pushed aside in Part III by their gossiping, flattering counterparts in the fine manor-house."&lt;ref name=Cutt60/&gt; The second two volumes also outline narrower roles for each sex.&lt;ref name=D277&gt;Dawson, 277.&lt;/ref&gt; In Part I Lucy and Emily learn to sew and keep house while Henry tends the garden and learns [[Latin]], but in Part II, Henry's scrapes involve letting loose a bull while the girls focus intently on how to make purchases in an economical yet fair fashion. The most extensive thematic change in the series, however, was the disappearance of its strident [[evangelicalism]]. Whereas all of the lessons in Part I highlight the children's "human depravity" and encourage the reader to think in terms of the afterlife, in Parts II and III, other Victorian values such as "respectability" and filial obedience are brought to the fore.&lt;ref name="Cutt, 76"/&gt; Children's literature scholar Janis Dawson describes the difference in terms of parental indulgence; in Parts II and III, the Fairchild parents employ softer disciplinary tactics than in Part I.&lt;ref name=D277/&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:FairchildFamily1818Frontispiece.jpg|alt=A drawing of a woman watching three children play in a  room with a large, draped window.|thumb|right|Frontispiece from the first edition of ''The Fairchild Family, Part I'' (1818). The illustration reads: "Don't tease me Henry," said Lucy, "don't you see I'm reading?"]]
''The Fairchild Family'' continued to be a bestseller despite the increasingly popular [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworthian]] image of childhood innocence and the sentimental picture of childhood presented in novels such as [[Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens's]] ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1837–39).&lt;ref name=Cutt66/&gt; One scholar has suggested that it "influenced Dickens's depictions of Pip's fears of the convict, the gibbet, and 'the horrible young man' at the close of Chapter 1" in ''[[Great Expectations]]'' (1860–61).&lt;ref&gt;Chaney, Lois E. "Pip and the Fairchild Family." ''Dickensian'' 79.3 (1983): 162–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Children's literature scholar [[Gillian Avery]] has argued that ''The Fairchild Family'' was "as much a part of English childhood as ''Alice'' was later to become."&lt;ref name="Qtd. in Harper, 3"&gt;Qtd. in Harper, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As late as the 1900s, [[Lord Frederick Spencer Hamilton|Lord Frederic Hamilton]]&lt;!--I'm pretty sure I chose the right one--&gt; states that he attended a party at which each guest dressed up as a character from the book.&lt;ref&gt;Harper, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the book was popular, some scraps of evidence have survived suggesting that readers did not always interpret it as Sherwood would have wanted. Lord Hamilton writes, for instance, that "there was plenty about eating and drinking; one could always skip the prayers, and there were three or four very brightly written accounts of funerals in it."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Cutt, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the series was republished later in the century, the books were severely edited; often Mr. Fairchild's sermons were removed from Part I and the phrase "human depravity" was replaced with the word "naughtiness." Many of the changes also served to further emphasize the authority of the parents: "as the religious framework was weakened or removed, the parent became the ultimate authority, and the Victorian cult of the family was reinforced in a way that Mrs. Sherwood had never intended."&lt;ref&gt;Cutt, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''The Fairchild Family'' has gained a reputation in the twentieth century as an oppressively [[didactic]] book,&lt;ref name="Dawson, 270; Harper, 2-3"/&gt; in the early nineteenth century it was viewed as delightfully [[Literary realism|realistic]].&lt;ref&gt;Cutt, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; It was often described as humorous and [[Charlotte Yonge]] (1823–1901), a critic who also wrote children's literature, praised "the gusto with which [Sherwood] dwells on new dolls" and "the absolutely sensational naughtiness" of the children.&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Dawson, 277; see also Rosman, 114-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Although twentieth-century critics have tended to view the tale as harsh ([[John Rowe Townsend]] described it as "unspeakably cruel"&lt;ref name="Qtd. in Harper, 3"/&gt;), often pointing to the Fairchilds' visit to the [[gibbet]], Cutt and others argue that the positive depiction of the nuclear family in the text, particularly Sherwood's emphasis on parents' responsibility to educate their own children, was an important part of the book's appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Cutt, 68; see also Harper, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that Sherwood's "influence," via books such as the ''Fairchild Family'', "upon the domestic pattern of Victorian life can hardly be overestimated."&lt;ref&gt;Cutt, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Orwell]] had a very negative view.  "This evil book is now issued in pretty-pretty expurgated editions, but it is well worth reading in the original version.  It gives one some idea of the lengths to which child-discipline was sometimes carried. Mr. Fairchild, for instance, when he catches his children quarrelling, first thrashes them, reciting Dr. Watts's 'Let dogs delight to bark and bite' between blows of the cane, and then takes them to spend the afternoon beneath a gibbet where the rotting corpse of a murderer is hanging.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Orwell, George|title=Charles Dickens|url=http://george-orwell.org/Charles_Dickens/0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Northern Celestial Masters''' type of the '''Way of the Celestial Master''' ({{zh|s=天师道|t=天師道|p= Tiān Shī Dào}}) [[Daoist]] movement existed in the north of [[China]] during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]. The Northern Celestial Masters were a continuation of the [[Way of the Celestial Masters]] as it had been practiced in [[Sichuan]] province by [[Zhang Lu (Three Kingdoms)|Zhang Lu]] and his followers. After the community was forced to relocate in 215 CE, a group of Celestial Masters established themselves in Northern China.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kou Qianzhi]], from a family who followed the Celestial Master, brought a new version of Celestial Master Daoism to the [[Northern Wei]]. The Northern Wei government embraced his form of Daoism and established it as the state religion, thereby creating a new Daoist [[theocracy]] that lasted until 450 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 284-285.&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrival of [[Buddhism]] had great influence on the Northern Celestial Masters, bringing monasticism and influencing the diet of practitioners. Art produced in areas dominated by the Northern Celestial Masters also began to show Buddhist influence. When the theocracy collapsed, many Daoists fled to Louguan, which quickly became an important religious center. The Northern Celestial Masters survived as a distinct school at Louguan until the late 7th century CE, when they became integrated into the wider Daoist movement.

==History==
{{Taoism}}

===Northern Wei (424-450)===
[[Kou Qianzhi]] was a member of Celestial Master family that came from an area near [[Chang'an]]. Inspired by the burgeoning Daoist movement in Southern China, Kou retreated to [[Mount Song]] in [[Henan]] to receive inspiration. On the mountain, as described by the text ''The History of the Wei Dynasty'', he was visited twice by [[Laozi]]. In his first visit in 415, Laozi revealed to Kou a text known as the ''Laojun Yinsong Jiejing'' (New Code).&lt;ref&gt;Ware (1933), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;  This text contained precepts designed for a new religious community. In 423, a messenger of Laozi came and offered Kou a new text called the ''Lutu Zhenjing'' (Perfect Scripture of Registers and Charts), which is now lost, and appointed him as the new Celestial Master.&lt;ref name="Kohn 2000, p. 284"&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 424, Kou took these texts with him to the Wei court. There, he was welcomed by [[Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei|Emperor Taiwu]] and garnered the support of [[Cui Hao]], the prime minister.&lt;ref name="Kohn 2000, p. 284"/&gt; Even though Cui Hao was a [[Confucianist]], he greatly admired Kou and was immediately drawn to him. Cui also appreciated Kou's mathematical skills and hoped that he might help him improve his own longevity techniques. They also shared a dream of a 'purified society,' a land where peace and justice prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1979), p. 112-113.&lt;/ref&gt; Kou's 'New Code' was promulgated throughout the realm, and a large altar was built near the capital where 120 Daoist practitioners performed rites and prayers daily. Cui gained a great deal of power in the court, and in 444 began to purge the Buddhist clergy. This led to a major [[Three Disasters of Wu|persecution against Buddhists]] in 446.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1979), p. 116-117.&lt;/ref&gt; In 448, Kou Qianzhi was 'released' from his body, and Cui lost his greatest supporter at the court. Shortly after Kou's death, Cui had a national history of Wei dynasty containing unflattering portraits of its rulers carved in stone. This so enraged the emperor, that he had Cui executed in 450.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1979), p. 120-121.&lt;/ref&gt;  After Cui's execution, the Daoist community was forced to flee, with many of them settling at the Daoist center of [[Louguan]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Louguan (450-688)===
By the late 470s, Daoists fleeing from the Northern Wei court had transformed Louguan into an important religious center. According to legend, Louguan used to be the home of [[Yin Xi]], the first recipient of the ''[[Dao de jing]]''. At this time, the center's buildings were greatly expanded, and many Daoist scriptures were collected, including materials from the [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] and [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 286-287.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 7th century, the school had a prominent role in a series of debates that examined whether Buddhism or Daoism would be better suited to bring stability to the realm. The first debate surrounded Fuyi, a scholar and Daoist who proposed that Buddhism be abolished in China. Naturally, the Buddhists were not happy with his suggestions and countered his arguments in several treatises. The second debate concerned Lu Zhongqing, a friend of Fu Yi, who wrote about Buddhism's inferiority to Daoism. The [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] emperors were in support of the Daoists, and in 637 issued an edict that secured the precedence of Daoism over Buddhism. This edict remained in place until 674, when Empress [[Wu Zetian]] came to power. At the same time, Louguan also served as a refuge for Daoists fleeing the persecution of Emperor Wu of the [[Liang dynasty]] to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2008), p. 710.&lt;/ref&gt; The final Northern Celestial Master, [[Yin Wencao]] arrived at Louguan in 636 and later achieved the favor of the [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Gaozong Emperor]]. After Yin's death in 688, Louguan remained an important place of Daoist learning, but ceased to be considered part of a distinct school.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 289-290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texts==
The most important text from the Northern Wei period of the Northern Celestial Masters is the ''Laojun Yinsong Jiejing'' (New Code). This text was revealed to Kou Qianzhi in 415, and is now mostly lost apart from a few fragments. The surviving text contains thirty-six precepts that outline rules which a Daoist had to abide by. The behavioral rules outlined proper public conduct and what to do in case of sickness. There were also guidelines describing how banquets were to be set up, as well ritual instructions concerning funeral rites, immortality practice and petitions.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2008), 609-610.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most important text's from the school's Louguan period is called the ''[[Xishengjing]]'' (The Scripture of Western Ascension). This text describes Laozi's emigration to [[India]] and the transmission of the ''Daode Jing'' to Yin Xi. However, the text is not really a narrative, but uses the stories as a framework to describe how an adept should live his life. The text describes how an adept can make use of the [[Tao|Dao]] that is inherent in the world, outlines meditation techniques, and discusses the results of living a sagely life and what happens after death.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2008), 1135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
The Northern Celestial Master variety of Daoism was both similar and different from Zhang Lu's earlier form. Unlike prior incarnations of the Celestial Masters, which supported [[Taoist Sexual Practices|sexual practices]] as a means of achieving immortality, Kou's text urged that the sexual arts be purged from the religion.&lt;ref&gt;Despeux, (2000), 399.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he also states that religion must be purged of the imposition of religious taxes on the faithful and the inheritance of religious titles. In the Northern Celestial Masters, [[Laozi]] became closely linked with the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], who was claimed to be a student of Laozi.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also very specific dietary requirements that had to be followed, as well as other rules, many of which were influenced by [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="Kohn 2000, p. 302"&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Northern Celestial Masters were also the first Daoists to practice a form of monasticism, another idea that came from Buddhism. Kou also condemned messianic movements and called for texts such as the ''[[Daodejing]]'' to be copied and recited. Those people who were good in life would gain immortality in a new age, whereas those who were bad would be reborn as insects or animals.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kohn 2000, p. 304"&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:LaoGod.jpg|thumbnail|left|280px|Laozi, depicted as the Taoist god.]]
Some similarities between earlier Celestial Master Daoism include the role of [[Laozi]]. Laozi was  viewed as the personification of the Dao, who existed for eternity and created the world. He was believed to be the creator of the universe and came to earth intermittently to bring forth sacred scriptures, including the ''Daode Jing'' and ''Xisheng Jing''. Moreover, Laozi continued to appear periodically and bring forth new scriptures to both Kou Qianzhi and adherents at Louguan, surrounded by a celestial entourage and announced by a celestial envoy. Laozi was also extremely closely linked with the Buddha, and in certain sources, even became the Buddha or announced Yinxi as the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 298-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practices==
The Northern Celestial Masters followed certain regular, communal rites. One of these communal rites involved formal [[banquet]]s. These feasts could last as long as seven days. In order to purify themselves for feasts, members had to abstain from eating meat, garlic, green onions, ginger, leeks and onions. A banquet consisted of three courses – wine, rice and a [[vegetarian]] meal. [[Ritual]] activity during feasts and other activities usually involved a series of bows and prostrations as well as the burning of incense.&lt;ref name="Kohn 2000, p. 302"/&gt; Banquets were also held when someone died. During these banquets, attendees would perform rituals aimed at remitting the sins of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Toshiaki, (1995), 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

While monasticism had existed in Chinese Buddhism, the Northern Celestial Masters were one of the first Daoist groups to practice it. Kou lived a monastic lifestyle on [[Mount Song|Songshan]], known today for being the location of the [[Shaolin Monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;Goosseart (2008), p. 916.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monasticism]] developed further during the Louguan phase of the Northern Celestial Masters due to this influence of Buddhism. During this period, a clear distinction developed between lay and monastic followers in Daoism. The ordination, precepts and way in which monks sought salvation were all influenced by Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Kohn 2000, p. 304"/&gt;

==Art==
Many art objects were produced in [[Northern and southern China|Northern China]] during the time of the Northern Celestial Masters. These objects were closely modeled on Buddhist designs. The image of the god (usually Laozi), would be carved on the front side of a stone stele, with inscriptions on the back or side of the carving. The inscriptions were usually prayers to the dead, a wish for the happiness of family members or wishes for political peace. The iconography and contents of the inscriptions show that a close relationship between Daoism and Buddhism existed in the Northern Wei state.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn (2000), p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship is especially evident in some four-sided stelae that had carvings of both Laozi on two sides and the Buddha on the other two.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn and Lafargue (1998), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five fables of ancient Greek origin that deal with '''the statue of Hermes'''. All have been classed as burlesques&lt;ref&gt;Henk Versnel, ''Coping with the gods: wayward readings in Greek theology'', Brill 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jSANEJjPHAIC&amp;lpg=PA329&amp;ots=tbYPDiS98c&amp;dq=Hermes%20%20%22fable%22%20%20%20statue&amp;pg=PA329#v=onepage&amp;q=Hermes%20%20%22fable%22%20%20%20statue&amp;f=false pp.329-30]&lt;/ref&gt; that show disrespect to the god involved and some scepticism concerning the efficacy of religious statues as objects of worship.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wojciechowsky, “Ancient criticism of religion”, in ''Deuterocanonical Additions of the Old Testament Books: Selected Studies'', Walter de Gruyter 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a5Ar-KSEfh4C&amp;lpg=PA68&amp;dq=statue%20fable%20Hermes&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q=statue%20fable%20Hermes&amp;f=false p.68]&lt;/ref&gt; Statues of Hermes differed according to function and several are referenced in these stories. Only one fable became generally retold in later times, although two others also achieved some currency.

==1 Hermes and the sculptor==
The fable appears as number 88 in the [[Perry Index]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/88.htm Aesopica]]&lt;/ref&gt; and was to become a favourite in Europe from the [[Renaissance]] on. It is directed against self-conceit in general and concerns a visit to a statue maker made in human disguise by the god [[Hermes]]. Finding that [[Jove]], the king of the gods, was set at a low price and his queen at only a little more, he felt sure that, since he was their messenger, his own statue must command much more. When he asked about it, however, the sculptor told him that if he would buy the other two statues he could have that one free.

A [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]] poem on the theme appeared in [[Gabriele Faerno]]'s ''Centum Fabulae'' (1563) with the moral that 'Many who fancy themselves are set at nothing'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wlATAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=Mercurius&amp;f=false ''Mercurius et statuarius'', p.79]&lt;/ref&gt; In England prose versions appeared in the collections of [[Roger L'Estrange]] (1692)&lt;ref&gt;"Mercury and the Statuary", [http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/lestrange/169.htm fable 169]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Samuel Croxall]] (1722).&lt;ref&gt;"Mercury and the carver" [https://books.google.com/books?id=vjYXAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22samuel%20croxall%22%20fables&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q=mercury&amp;f=false fable 156]&lt;/ref&gt; In all of these, the name of the Greek god is changed to [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], his Latin equivalent. There were also two English verse retellings. In Edward Arwaker's ''Truth in Fiction'' (1708), the story is subtitled "Vain-glory mortified" and is a much more circumstantial account. Statues of the gods are described as currently ‘a drug on the market’ to explain the low price asked and, in addition, the statue of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] is cheaper since she is a woman.&lt;ref&gt;Book 4, Fable 7, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YWRFAAAAMAAJ&amp;lpg=PR15&amp;ots=IwEHLuKk8V&amp;dq=mercury%20and%20the%20statue%20%20fable&amp;pg=PA287#v=onepage&amp;q=mercury%20and%20the%20statue%20%20fable&amp;f=false p.289]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1820, Jefferys Taylor wrote a sprightly version for children in which the sculptor assures Mercury that his statue merely serves as a make-weight when a set of the gods is bought.&lt;ref&gt;''Aesop in Rhyme'', [https://archive.org/stream/aesopinrhymewith00tayliala#page/30/mode/2up/search/Mercury pp.30-1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Illustrations of the tale, starting from the miniature in the Greek Medici Manuscript of about 1470, invariably feature the god pointing out his statue to the sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=mercurius%20et%20statuarius Laura Gibbs Flickr site]&lt;/ref&gt;  An English copper engraving by [[David Jones (poet)|David Jones]] for the specially commissioned ''Seven Fables of Aesop'' (1928) shows an up-to-date sculptor at work on the statue.&lt;ref&gt;"Hermes and the sculptor", the fourth print at the [http://www.artwales.com/artists-detail-print-mtg-en.php?artistID=27 Martin Tinney Gallery site]&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian linocut by John Ryrie is more sly in its updating. The god wears a collar, tie and smart overcoat as he enters into negotiation with the aproned workman. It is only the detail of sandals on his feet and the wings fluttering from beneath the trousers at his ankles that give his identity away.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chrysalis.com.au/TXfbS/Artwork-Ryrie-MercuryandtheSculptor-666.htm Chrysalis Gallery]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2 Hermes and the dog==
The fable is numbered 308 in the Perry Index and is a broad piece of Greek [[Scatology#Literature|scatalogical]] humour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/308.htm Aesopica]&lt;/ref&gt; There is a poetical version in the Greek of [[Babrius]], but thereafter written accounts do not seem to continue. The Victorian translator of his work, Rev. John Davies, omitted it from his ''Fables of Babrius'' (1860),&lt;ref&gt;Fable 48, [http://elfinspell.com/ClassicalTexts/Babrius/Part1-Fables40-79.html Elfinspell transcription]&lt;/ref&gt; although the story is harmless enough. A dog of a pious turn of mind salutes the god's four-sided [[herma]], a statue of the kind used to mark boundaries and stages along a road. When the animal announces its intention to anoint him, the god hastily begs it not to and says he does not need to be honoured any further.

==3 The sculptor’s dream==
The story is numbered 307 in the Perry Index&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/307.htm Aesopica]&lt;/ref&gt; and there are poetical versions in the Greek of Babrius&lt;ref&gt;Rev. John Davies, ''Fables of Babrius'', [http://elfinspell.com/ClassicalTexts/Babrius/Part1-Fables1-39.html#fable30 fable 30]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Latin of [[Avianus]], although the latter account is told of [[Bacchus]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Pedlar and the Merchant", [https://archive.org/stream/fablesofavianusn00ohai#page/n49/mode/2up Fable 23]&lt;/ref&gt; The type of statue involved in this case would be of the god as a handsome young man. Two customers approach the statuary, one wishing to place his work in the tomb of his son, one proposing to use it for private worship. Deciding to sleep on the matter, he is visited by Hermes in a dream and is told that he has in his hands the decision to make him either a dead man or a divinity. Although the fable is light-hearted, the 2nd century physician and philosopher, [[Galen]], gave it a more serious turn by applying the story to human potentiality. In a work on ethics, he tells the fable and then continues by commenting that similarly “You have a choice between honouring your soul by making it like the gods and treating it contemptuously by making it like the brute beasts”.&lt;ref&gt;The work only exists now in an Arabic translation, [http://purplemotes.net/2012/12/05/galen-godly-man-hermes-herm Purple Motes site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==4 The wish-fulfilling image==
[[File:Winterpalais Hermes Statue.jpg|thumb|An 18th century Viennese statue of Hermes the wealth-bringer]]
The fable numbered 99 in the Perry Index&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/99.htm Aesopica]&lt;/ref&gt; was not translated into English until it appeared in the substantial collection of [[Roger L'Estrange]] under the title “An image expos’d to sale”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aesopus.pbworks.com/w/page/1472402/lestrange44 Fable 446]&lt;/ref&gt;
A sculptor hawks his newly finished statue at market by declaring that this is a wonder-working god and will profit its owner. When asked why he is selling such a valuable asset, the huckster replies that he is in need of immediate funds while Hermes takes his time in granting favours. Later English versions include "The Seller of Images" in George Fyler Townsend's ''Aesop's Fables'' (1867)&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/townsend/207.htm Aesopica]&lt;/ref&gt; and V.S. Vernon-Jones' new translation as "The Image Seller" in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythfolklore.net/aesopica/vernonjones/109.htm Aesopica]&lt;/ref&gt;

==5 The statue and the treasure== 
The story is numbered 285 in the Perry Index&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/285.htm Aesopica]&lt;/ref&gt; and was versified in Greek by Babrius, drawing the moral that evil men will only comply when insulted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://elfinspell.com/ClassicalTexts/Babrius/Part1-Fables80-129.html#fable117 Fable 119]&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the wealth-bringing Hermes does not deliver the expected benefits and his frustrated worshipper smashes the image on the floor. When a flood of gold coins pours from the head, the man reproaches the kind of personality that will not render good for good but does so when ill-treated. While Babrius specifically named the god involved, [[Hieronymus Osius]] did not when he versified the fable in Latin,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/osius/203.htm Fable 203]&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Pantaleon Candidus]] specifically states that he does not know in his Latin poem,''Homo et statua''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-mannheim.de/mateo/camena/del2/deliciae2.html#delb0056 Fable 10]&lt;/ref&gt; Neither did [[William Caxton]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/caxton/66.htm Book 6.6]&lt;/ref&gt; and Roger L'Estrange&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/lestrange/105.htm Fable 105]&lt;/ref&gt; say who it is in their English prose versions, which end with reflections on misdirected worship. [[La Fontaine's Fables|Jean de la Fontaine]] is equally reticent about the god's identity in his ''L’homme et son idole de bois'' (The man and his wooden idol, ''Fables'' IV.8).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la-fontaine-ch-thierry.net/fourassman.htm English translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been surmised that one explanation for the scepticism of these last two fables was that Hermes was the god of trade and merchants and the Greeks had a certain ambivalence towards wealth making.&lt;ref&gt; Christos A. Zafiropoulos, ''Ethics in Aesop's Fables: The Augustana Collection'', Brill 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-blOQAp553IC&amp;lpg=PA111&amp;ots=OvLpgE9Wbl&amp;dq=augustana%20collection%20%20%22Hermes%22&amp;pg=PA111#v=onepage&amp;q=augustana%20collection%20%20%22Hermes%22&amp;f=false p.111]&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th century Byzantine Greek lexicon known as the [[Suda]] explains what form of statue is involved here. "They say Hermes was responsible for profit and an overseer of the businesses: consequently they set up the statue of him weighing a purse."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted on [http://www.theoi.com/Olympios/HermesGod.html#Trade Theoi.com]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is to such sculptures that the statue on the  stairs of  the [[Winter Palace of Prince Eugene]] in Vienna can be referred, although it is itself ambiguous. The sculptor rests with chisel in hand on the statue's right as it looks down towards another similarly dressed individual on the other side who raises his hand towards the god. It might therefore remind viewers of the first of the fables here, which was well known. But it is the purse held well away in the god's right hand which seems to be drawing the gaze of the man below, whose hand is cupped as if in supplication. The statue can therefore be read alternatively as referencing either of the last two fables here.

'''''The Tao of Zen''''' is a [[nonfiction]] book by [[Ray Grigg]], published by [[Charles E. Tuttle Company]] in 1994, and reprinted by [[Alva Press]] in 1999.

The work argues that what we recognize as traditional Chinese [[Ch’an]]/Japanese [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] is in fact almost entirely grounded in Chinese [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[philosophy]], though this fact is well shrouded by the persistence of [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhist]] institutional trappings.  Utilizing an array of scholarly commentary on the two traditions and historical deduction from what can be considered to be the best primary source material available, the author traces the development of [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] in [[China]] and [[Japan]] for two millennia.  

The story unfolds in [[China]] as Buddhism appears on the scene and is accepted by the Chinese population as a “simplified version of Taoism” that the Western barbarians ([[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]] Indians and [[Central Asian]]s, e.g. [[Tibetans]], et al.) could understand. They shared many philosophical similarities that made Chinese acclimation to Buddhism much easier – but the more dogmatic ways in which Buddhism was practiced helped it to get the fast track on becoming the predominant religion in China. 

Its predisposition to [[Buddhist monasticism|monastic institutionalization]] throughout the empire allowed it to eventually assimilate and co-opt Taoist perspectives. The dominance of the [[Ch’an]] Buddhist tradition was most responsible for this trend. However, when it was eventually exported to [[Japan]], the Taoist strands had the opportunity in a new cultural framework to once again assert themselves.  

Grigg is able to trace the submergence and eventual resurgence of Taoism in Japan and the [[Western culture|modern West]] by identifying how its specific tendencies ([[paradox]], [[Nondualism|nonduality]], aversion to [[Institutionalisation|institutionalization]], emphasis on informal and varied paths to “[[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]”, focus on the practical matters of influencing the social world, etc.) clearly manifested themselves in very different times and places.  

What he seeks to do in this book is vindicate the importance of Taoist thought in the [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese religious history]] and displace the notion of Zen Buddhism as a coherent whole. To him, these are very different spiritual systems that only coexist today because of the almost wholly unacknowledged lingering of the original Buddhist colonization of Taoist China. The popularity of Zen today owes much more to its persistent Taoist origins than to Buddhist doctrine.

'''Thomagata''' or '''Fomagata''' was a [[Muisca mythology|mythical]] ''[[cacique]]'' who was said to have been ''[[zaque]]'' of [[Tunja|Hunza]], present-day Tunja, [[Colombia]], then part of the [[Muisca Confederation]]. He is remembered as one of the most [[Muisca religion|religious]] in the history of the ''zaques'', after [[Idacansás]].&lt;ref name=p85/&gt;

== Background ==
In the centuries before the arrival of the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s, the central highlands of Colombia were ruled by ''[[zaque]]s'' (northern [[Muisca Confederation]]) and ''[[zipa]]s'' (southern territories of the [[Muisca people|Muisca]]). The first confirmed human ''zaque'' and ''zipa'' were respectively [[Hunzahúa]] and [[Meicuchuca]], inaugurated in 1450. The time before those rulers are based on [[Muisca mythology|mythology]].

== Mythography ==
Thomagata allegedly had a [[tail]], as that of a [[jaguar]] that reached to the ground, hence the name ''Cacique Rabón'' ("Taily Chief"). Thomagata had four ears and only one eye because he was blind on the other.&lt;ref name=p85/&gt;

Thomagata was a [[saint]], traveling each night between Tunja and the [[Sun Temple (Sogamoso)|Temple of the Sun]] in [[Sogamoso|Sugamuxi]] along the [[Iraka Valley]]. His walks were a [[pilgrimage]], ten times back and forth, praying in the sacred sites he encountered on his way. Muisca traditions tell he was so holy that whom he made angry, he converted into a [[snake]], [[lizard]] or other animal. Thomagata got this ability from Idacansás and the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name=p85/&gt;

Thomagata looked upon his [[vassal]]s with disrespect and turned them into animals, so the Muisca didn't dare look him in the face. ''Zaque'' Tomaghata never married.&lt;ref name=p86&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.14, p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop [[Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita]], chronicler of most of the Muisca mythology and traditions, wrote in the 17th century about Thomagata:&lt;ref name=p86/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...habiéndose inclinado en su mocedad al matrimonio y queriéndolo efectuar, reconoció que estaba inhabilitado para ello porque desagradado el Sol de semejante pretensión y empeñado en que le sucediese en el reino Tutazúa, su hermano, lo despojó la noche antes de la potencia germinativa, por lo cual vivió toda la vida en celibato y después de ciento y tantos años murió...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

translated as

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...having tended towards marriage in his youth and wanting to carry that out, he recognized that he was unable for that because the Sun was too ambitious and determined that Tutazúa, his brother, would succeed the reign of the zacazgo ["kingdom"], [the Sun] deprived him from his genital power so he lived all his life in celibacy and after more than 100 years he died...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tutazúa succeeded Thomagata as ''cacique'' of Hunza. In the [[Chibcha language]] Tutazúa means "son of the Sun".&lt;ref name=p86/&gt; The first confirmed human ''zaque'' of the northern Muisca, [[Hunzahúa]], is said to have descended from Thomagata.&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} Acosta, Joaquín, 1800-1852 [http://www.banrepcultural.org/blaavirtual/historia/descol/comp12a.htm Mitología de los Chibchas, sus usos y costumbres; Mythology of the Chibcha-speaking people, their use and customs] - Banco de la República - accessed 22-04-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Selection====
The Maharishi is reported to have standardized and "mechanized" the mantra selection process by using a specific set of mantras and making the selection process "foolproof".&lt;ref name=Needleman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jefferson&gt;{{Cite book|last=Jefferson|first=William|title=The Story of The Maharishi|location=New York|publisher=Pocket (Simon and Schuster)|year=1976|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor of psychiatry [[Norman E. Rosenthal]] writes that during the training given by a certified TM teacher, "each student is assigned a specific mantra or sound, with instructions on its proper use".&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt; The Maharishi said that the selection of a proper thought or mantra "becomes increasingly important when we consider that the power of thought increases when the thought is appreciated in its infant stages of development".&lt;ref name="Science of Being"/&gt;{{rp|p 51}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Meditation of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi|author=Maharishi Mahesh Yogi|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1968|pages=106–107|isbn=1-4303-0372-7}}{{Request quotation|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that mantras chosen for initiates should "resonate to the pulse of his thought and as it resonates, create an increasingly soothing influence",&lt;ref name="Religion in Amer"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Columbia University Press | isbn = 978-0-231-12155-2 | last = Allitt | first = Patrick | title = Religion in America Since 1945: A History | date = 2005-09-20|page=141 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the chosen mantra's vibrations "harmonize" with the meditator, and suits their "nature and way of life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = H.

====Meaning and sound value====
In his 1963 book ''The Science of Being and Art of Living'', the Maharishi writes that words create waves of vibrations, and the quality of vibration of a mantra should correspond to the vibrational quality of the individual. Likewise, religious studies scholar [[Thomas Forsthoefel]] writes, "the theory of mantras is the theory of sound".&lt;ref name=Forsthoefel/&gt; Author William Jefferson writes that the "[[euphonic]]s" of mantras are important.&lt;ref name=Jefferson/&gt; Sociologist [[Stephen J. Hunt]] and others say that the mantra used in the Transcendental Meditation technique "has no meaning", but that "the sound itself" is sacred.&lt;ref name="Hunt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barrett/&gt; In [[Kerala]], India, in 1955, the Maharishi spoke of mantras in terms of personal deities, and according to religious studies scholar [[Cynthia Ann Humes]], similar references can be found in his later works.&lt;ref name=Forsthoefel /&gt;{{rp|p 63}}&lt;ref name=Beacon&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.paulmason.info/gurudev/sources/pdf/Beacon%20Light%20of%20the%20HImalayas.pdf|format=PDF|author=Maharishi Mahesh Yogi|title=Beacon Light of the Himalayas|year=1955|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to authors Peter Russell and [[Norman Rosenthal]], the sounds used in the technique are taken from the ancient [[Vedic]] tradition, have "no specific meaning",&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Russell1/&gt;{{rp|pp 49–50}} and are selected for their suitability for the individual.&lt;ref name="Phelan, Michael 1979"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Phelan, Michael |year=1979 |title=Transcendental Meditation.

Supp. 1288 {{Full citation needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, philosophy of science scholar and former [[Maharishi International University]] professor Jonathan Shear writes in his book ''The Experience of Meditation: Experts Introduce the Major Traditions'' that the mantras used in the TM technique are independent of meaning associated with any [[language]], and are used for their mental sound value alone.&lt;ref name=Shear&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Shear | first1 = J.

Transcendental Meditation in education (also known as Consciousness-Based Education) is the application of the Transcendental Meditation technique in an educational setting or institution. These educational programs and institutions have been founded in the USA, United Kingdom, Australia, India, Africa and Japan.

The TM technique has been incorporated in a variety of U.S. social programs for criminals, the homeless and war veterans. In 1979, the TM technique was offered to inmates at [[Folsom prison]], [[San Quentin]] and the [[Deuel Vocational Institute]].

==Theoretical concepts==

===Views on consciousness (1963)===
In his 1963 book, ''The Science Of Being and Art Of Living,'' Maharishi Mahesh Yogi says that, over time, through the practice of the TM technique, the conscious mind gains familiarity with deeper levels of the mind, bringing the subconscious mind within the capacity of the conscious mind, resulting in expanded awareness in daily activity. He also teaches that the Transcendental Meditation practitioner transcends all mental activity and experiences the 'source of thought', which is said to be pure silence, 'pure awareness' or 'transcendental Being', 'the ultimate reality of life'.&lt;ref name="Science of Being"/&gt;{{rp|pp 44–53}}&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt;&lt;ref name="Phelan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Interview with Larry King|first =Larry |last=King|date=May 12, 2002|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; TM is sometimes self described as a technology of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Hunt"/&gt; Pathologist Vimal Patel, says TM has been shown to produce states that are physiologically different from waking, dreaming and sleeping.&lt;ref name=Patel&gt;{{Cite book|last=Patel|first=Vimal|publisher= Humana Press|isbn = 978-0-89603-440-2|editor1-last = Humber| editor1-first = James M.|editor2-first = Robert F. |editor2-last=Almeder|title = Alternative medicine and ethics|year = 1998|pages=55–56|chapter=Understanding the Integration of Alternative Modalities Into an Emerging Healthcare Model In the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7X7d_DZlLkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to author Michael Phelan "The fundamental premise of the psychology of fulfillment is that within every person exists a seemingly inexhaustible center of energy, intelligence, and satisfaction... To the extent that our behavior depends on the degree of energy and intelligence available to us, this center of pure creative intelligence may be described as that resource which gives direction to all that we experience, think and do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Transcendental Meditation.

According to the Maharishi, there are seven levels of consciousness: (i) waking; (ii) dreaming; (iii) deep sleep; (iv) transcendental consciousness; (v) cosmic consciousness; (vi) God consciousness; and, (vii) unity consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Patrick Gresham (2000) The Spiritual Recovery Manual: Vedic Knowledge and Yogic Techniques to Accelerate Recovery,  page 202&lt;/ref&gt; The Maharishi says that transcendental consciousness can be experienced through Transcendental Meditation, and that those who meditate diligently could become aware of cosmic consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dkuHUWYnW80C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=maharishi+%22god+consciousness%22#v=onepage&amp;q=maharishi%20%22god%20consciousness%22&amp;f=false Tillery, Gary, ''The Cynical Idealist; A Spiritual Biography of John Lennon''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140304013412/http://books.google.com/books?id=dkuHUWYnW80C&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=maharishi+%22god+consciousness%22 |date=2014-03-04 }} Quest Books, 2009 {{ISBN|0-8356-0875-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8356-0875-6}} pp 66-67&lt;/ref&gt; An indication of cosmic consciousness is "ever present wakefulness" that is present even during sleep.&lt;ref name="Walsh R, Shapiro SL 2006 227–39"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Walsh R, Shapiro SL |title=The meeting of meditative disciplines and Western psychology: a mutually enriching dialogue |journal=The American Psychologist |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=227–39 |date=April 2006|pmid=16594839 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.61.3.227 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on long-term TM practitioners experiencing what they describe as cosmic consciousness, has identified unique EEG profiles, muscle tone measurements, and REM indicators that suggest physiological parameters for this self described state of consciousness.&lt;ref name="Walsh R, Shapiro SL 2006 227–39"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Shauna L.|last1=Shapiro|first2=Roger|last2=Walsh|url=http://www.brittonlab.com/publications/Shapiro,%20Walsh,%20Britton%2003.pdf|title=An Analysis of Recent Meditation Research and Suggestions for Future Directions|journal=Journal for Meditation and Meditation Research|year=2003|volume=3|pages=69–90|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123031814/http://www.brittonlab.com/publications/Shapiro,%20Walsh,%20Britton%2003.pdf|archivedate=2009-11-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Cambridge Handbook of Consciousness notes that it is premature to say that the EEG coherence found in TM is an indication of a higher state of consciousness.&lt;ref name=Lutz&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 978-0-521-85743-7 | editor1-first = Philip David | editor1-last = Zelazo | editor2-first = Morris | editor2-last = Moscovitch | editor3-first = Evan | editor3-last = Thompson | title = The Cambridge handbook of consciousness | year = 2007 | pages = 534–535 | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TM and altered states of consciousness ===

Transcendental Meditation is linked with changes in the states of consciousness of the practitioners.  For centuries, mystics and practitioners of meditation have held that people may attain ‘higher’ states of consciousness through meditation techniques. Transcendental Meditation is sometimes associated with what is called ‘a fourth state of consciousness’, which is gained through the practice of meditation, and is therefore termed ‘higher’ and more valuable because repeated experiences presumably enable a person with increased energy, intelligence and satisfaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Studies involving the link between transcendental meditation and altered states of consciousness have existed since the beginning of the practice itself.  Many early studies have reported brain wave patterns not seen in other states of consciousness.  One, for instance, studied four Indian meditators who showed prominent alpha-wave activity in their normal resting periods, and a marked increase in the amplitude of their alpha waves during meditation.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Bloomfield, Harold (1977) Pocket Books, Happiness: the TM program, Psychiatry and Enlightenment&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the Japanese neuropsychiatrists Kasamatsu and Hirrai reported the appearance of waves other than alpha in zen meditators within fifty seconds after the beginning of the meditation period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Bloomfield (1975) links the continuous practice of TM with a ‘fourth state of consciousness’ which is different from the waking, sleeping, and dreaming states of consciousness.  He claims that the psychophysiological state gained during the practice of TM is so unique that it qualified as a fourth major state of consciousness.  He noted that the state had characteristic brain waves, level of Oxygen consumption and blood chemistry, suggesting that this state is distinctly different from waking, dreaming, and sleeping, as well as altered states such as hypnosis or autosuggestion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Science of Creative Intelligence (1971)===

The Science of Creative Intelligence is not science.&lt;ref name=sci/&gt; Theologian [[Robert M.

===Maharishi effect (1974)===
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi claimed that the quality of life would noticeably improve if one percent of the population practiced the Transcendental Meditation technique. This is known as the "Maharishi effect" and according to the Maharishi, it was perceived in 1974 after an analysis of crime statistics in 16 cities.&lt;ref name="Science of Being"/&gt;{{rp|329}}&lt;ref name="Karam"&gt;Karam, Ted (2005) Jumping on Water: Awaken Your Joy, Empower Your Life, page 137&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wager&gt;{{Cite news|title=Musicians Spread the Maharishi's Message of Peace|first=Gregg|last=Wager|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 11, 1987 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Ted Karam claims that there have been numerous studies on the Maharishi effect including a gathering of over 4,000 people in Washington, D.C. in the summer of 1993.&lt;ref name="Karam"/&gt; With the introduction of the [[TM-Sidhi program]] including Yogic Flying, the Maharishi proposed that the square root of 1 percent of the population practicing this advanced program together at the same time and in the same place would create benefits in society. This was referred to as the "Extended Maharishi Effect".&lt;ref name="Karam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maharishi University of Management"/&gt; The TM organization has linked the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and a reduction in global terrorism, US inflation and crime rates to the Maharishi effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Maharishi mob meditates on Limerick's ills|first=Liam|last=Fay|work=Sunday Times|location=London (UK)|date=June 13, 2004|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholars===
The technique has been variously described by sociologists and religious scholars as religious and non-religious.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chryssides, George D.]]. [http://www.cesnur.org/conferences/riga2000/chryssides.htm Defining the New Spirituality] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010110132000/http://www.cesnur.org/conferences/riga2000/chryssides.htm |date=2001-01-10 }} ''One possible suggestion is that religion demands exclusive allegiance: this would ipso facto exclude Scientology, TM and the Soka Gakkai simply on the grounds that they claim compatibility with whatever other religion the practitioner has been following. For example, TM is simply – as they state – a technique. Although it enables one to cope with life, it offers no goal beyond human existence (such as moksha), nor does it offer rites or passage or an ethic. Unlike certain other Hindu-derived movements, TM does not prescribe a dharma to its followers – that is to say a set of spiritual obligations deriving from one's essential nature.''&lt;/ref&gt; Its adherents says it is a non-religious, "scientific strategy", yet it appears to have "spiritual elements" such as the puja ceremony performed during the TM instruction.&lt;ref name=Hunt/&gt; Religious studies scholar [[Eugene V. Gallagher]] writes that, "practitioners describe TM as a science rather than a religious discipline", but its "principles were clearly derived from Hindu practice".&lt;ref&gt;[[Gallagher, Eugene V.]] (2004) [[Greenwood Press]], ''The new religious movements experience in America'',  page 106&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Cults and new religious movements'', author [[Roy Wallis]] characterizes TM as a "world affirming new religion" that "lacks most of the features traditionally associated with religion".&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Lorne L. (editor) (2003) Blackwell Publishing, ''Cults and new religious movements: a reader'', page 44&lt;/ref&gt; Liebler and Moss write that "unlike some forms of meditation, the TM technique does not require adherence to any belief system".&lt;ref&gt;Liebler, Nancy; Moss, Sandra; [https://books.google.com/books?id=AWf303UKhDUC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vt_UT9i8KaSi2QXKoaGfDw&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;f=false Healing depression the mind-body way] page 102&lt;/ref&gt; Religious studies scholars Michael Phelan, [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] and Tamar Gablinger say that TM participants "may meditate for relaxation, but otherwise have no contact with TM", and that TM "attracts a large number of people with low levels of commitment around a much smaller group of highly committed followers."&lt;ref name=Phelan/&gt;
&lt;ref name="Melting Point"&gt;{{cite book | title=The religious melting point: on tolerance, controversial religions and the state | publisher=Tectum Verlag | author=Gablinger, Tamar | year=2010 | location=Germany | pages=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James R. Lewis (scholar)|Lewis, James R.]] (2004) [[Oxford University Press]], ''The Oxford handbook of new religious movements''&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Phelan writes that TM is "being opposed by many religious groups who believe that it is a religious practice", and that "the TM objectives and methods are congruous with the criteria of revitalization movements [as] defined by [[Anthony F.C. Wallace]] ... whose goal is to create a better culture."&lt;ref name=Phelan/&gt; [[Charles H. Lippy]] writes that earlier spiritual interest in the technique faded in the 1970s, and "it became a practical technique ... that anyone could employ without abandoning their religious identification."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Lippy | first1 = Charles H. | title = Pluralism comes of age: American religious culture in the twentieth century | year = 2000 | publisher = [[M.E.

On the other hand, [[William Sims Bainbridge|Bainbridge]] finds TM to be a "... highly simplified form of Hinduism, adapted for Westerners who did not possess the cultural background to accept the full panoply of Hindu beliefs, symbols, and practices",&lt;ref name="Bainbridge"/&gt;&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=//religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/tm.html |publisher=Religious Movements Homepage Project |title=Transcendental Meditation |date=January 12, 2001 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831081613/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/tm.html |archivedate=August 31, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and describes the TM [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] ceremony  as "... in essence, a religious initiation ceremony".&lt;ref name=Bainbridge/&gt; [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] Maximos of Pittsburgh of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] describes TM as "a new version of Hindu Yoga" based on "pagan pseudo-worship and deification of a common mortal, Guru Dev".&lt;ref name="Aghiorgoussis 21, 34"/&gt;

In the book ''Cults and new religions'', [[Douglas E. Cowan|Cowan]] and Bromley write that TM is presented to the public as a meditation practice that has been validated by science, but is not a religious practice nor is it affiliated with a religious tradition. They say that "although there are some dedicated followers of TM who devote most or all of their time to furthering the practice of Transcendental Meditation in late modern society, the vast majority of those who practice do so on their own, often as part of what has been loosely described as the New Age Movement."&lt;ref name=Bromley&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cowan|first=Douglas E.|last2=Bromley|first2=David G.|title=Cults and New Religions: A Brief History|series=Blackwell Brief Histories of Religion|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |year=2007 |page=18 |isbn=1-4051-6128-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They say that most scholars view TM as having elements of both therapy and religion, but that it "has no designated scripture, no set of doctrinal requirements, no ongoing worship activity, and no discernible community of believers." They also say that Maharishi did not claim to have special divine revelation or supernatural personal qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cowan|first=Douglas E.|last2=Bromley|first2=David G.|title=Cults and new religions: a brief history|series=Blackwell Brief Histories of Religion|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2007 |pages=48–71 |isbn=1-4051-6128-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.equinoxjournals.com/ojs/index.php/FIR/article/viewFile/7015/4718|title= Book review: Cults and new religions: a brief history|journal=Fieldwork in Religion|format=pdf |first=George D.|last=Chryssides |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George D. Chryssides]] and [[Margaret Z. Wilkins]] write in ''A reader in new religious movements'' that TM and other new religious movements have been criticized for "surreptitiously smuggling in forms of Eastern religion under the guise of some seemingly innocuous technique of self improvement or health promotion".&lt;ref name="Chryssides, George D.; Margaret Lucy Wilkins 2006 7"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Chryssides, George D. |author2=Margaret Z. Wilkins |title=A reader in new religious movements |publisher=Continuum |location=London |year=2006 |pages=7 |isbn=0-8264-6167-0 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chryssides went on to say in ''Exploring new religions'' that although one can identify the yogi's Hindu background, Hindu lineage, mantras and initiation ceremony, TM is unlike religion in its "key elements": "there is no public worship, no code of ethics, no scriptures to be studied, and no rites of passage that are observed, such as dietary laws, giving to the poor, or pilgrimages."&lt;ref name="Chryssides 2001 301–303"/&gt; Psychiatry professor [[Norman E. Rosenthal]], author of ''[[Transcendence: Healing and Transformation Through Transcendental Meditation]]'', wrote that "Maharishi extracted the TM technique from its religious context and distilled it to its essence, which he believed could be of value to people of all creeds."&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"/&gt;{{rp|p 4}}

===Government===
In 1968, the yogi conducted a one-hour meeting with [[Secretary General of the United Nations]] [[U Thant]]. In the 1970s, courses in the TM technique were conducted at 47 military installations around the world (including eight in the U.S.), with 150 enrolling in the course at the [[West Point]] military academy. The TM technique was also taught at five U.S. federal prisons, and three in Germany and Canada. During this period, ten U.S. senators and more than 100 Congressional staff members learned the technique.&lt;ref name=Jefferson/&gt; In 1972, the Maharishi met with the Governor of Illinois ([[Dan Walker (politician)|Daniel Walker]]) and received a standing ovation when he addressed the [[Illinois]] state legislature before they passed a resolution characterizing Maharishi's Science of Creative Intelligence as useful for Illinois public schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kyIrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XZ4FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3743,2143748&amp;dq=maharishi+illinois+legislature&amp;hl=en] "People", ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]'', 1973-03-14.

Note: "The legislature in the State of Illinois passed a resolution this past year recommending the inclusion of SCI teaching in the public schools." Retrieved on 2010-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, TM was cited in two Congressional records regarding the SCI course being offered at 30 American universities and the technique being "in use" in some American prisons, mental institutions and drug rehabilitation centers.&lt;ref name="TM ABC guide"/&gt;

In 1975, the yogi met with [[Pierre Trudeau]] to discuss "the possibility of structuring an ideal society" through TM,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3-BYAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=b1IMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4744,1878994&amp;dq=trudeau+maharishi] "Maharishi says Trudeau 'Receptive'", ''Canadian Press'', ''[[The Windsor Star]]'', 1975-03-22. Retrieved on 2010-10-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Gazette, March 22, 1975, "PM and TM leader"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Citizen, March 22, 1975, "Trudeau "intelligent man" guru says after long talk".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 a U.S. district court in New Jersey held that a curriculum comprising the Science of Creative Intelligence and TM was religious in nature (''Malnak v Yogi''). The decision was appealed and in 1979 the 3rd Circuit opinion affirmed the decision and held that although SCI/TM is not a theistic religion, it deals with issues of ultimate concern, truth, and other ideas analogous to those of well-recognized religions and it therefore violated the [[Establishment Clause]]. Beginning in 1979 the German government released a number of booklets about problems arising for seven new religious movements in Germany, with the German term for these organizations variously translated as "psychogroups" and "psychotheraphy groups". These organizations, including TM, filed lawsuits trying to block the reports. The courts ruled that the booklets must only include factual information and exclude speculation, rumors, and matters that are unclear, and the booklets were re-released primarily containing quotations from materials of the organizations themselves.&lt;ref name=SFGate&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1995/12/29/MN65432.DTL|last=Epstein|first=Edward,|title=Politics and transcendental meditation|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=December 29, 1995|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120163700/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=%2Fchronicle%2Farchive%2F1995%2F12%2F29%2FMN65432.DTL|archivedate=January 20, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Middle East, abstracts and index, Part 1 24Ei |author= Library Information and Research Service |year=2001 |publisher=Northumberland Press |location= |isbn= |page=609|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quotation needed|date=June 2012}}&lt;ref name=Schoen/&gt; In 1996 a commission appointed by the German government concluded that new religious movements and "psychotherapy groups" did not present any danger to the state or to society.&lt;ref name=Schoen&gt;{{cite journal |first=Brigitte |last=Schoen |title=New Religions in Germany: The Publicity of the Public Square |journal=[[Nova Religio]] |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=266–274 |quote=It concluded that at present new religious and ideological communities and psychotherapy groups presented no danger to state and society or to socially relevant areas. |date=April 2001 |doi=10.1525/nr.2001.4.2.266}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, an Israeli government report defined TM as a "cult group ... targeted by anti-cult activists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gabriel Cavaglion |title=The theoretical framing of a social problem: the case of societal reaction to cults in Israel|journal=Israel Affairs |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=87–89 |date=January 2008 |pmid= |doi=10.1080/13537120701705882 |url=|ref=harv}} p. 87: "However, cult groups that were more positively oriented towards the central values of society and more likely to accommodate values of Judaism and Zionism, such as Transcendental Meditation . . . were also targeted by anti-cult activists." p. 89: "An inter-ministerial Commission of Inquiry on Cults report was published almost a decade after the first major responses from anti-cult activists. . .

{{nihongo||淘宮術|'''Tōkyūjutsu'''}} or '''Tōdō''' ({{nihongo2|淘道}}) is a Japanese [[divination]] (fortune telling) method, created by [[Yokoyama Marumitsu]] in the 1830s ([[Edo period]]). It was developed from [[Tengenjutsu (fortune telling)|tengenjutsu]], a system with origins in China and was well established at the time. Tōkyūjutsu teaches that ones personality and character can be determined by factors such as the date of birth and facial features. Good fortune is allegedly achieved by finding and understanding this inner self that has been obscured.&lt;ref name="Sawada"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sawada|first=Janine Anderson Tasca|title=Practical pursuits: religion, politics, and personal cultivation in nineteenth-century Japan|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|year=2004|pages=30–42, 202|isbn=0-8248-2752-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_5bQxGr6IHEC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotobank.jp/word/%E6%B7%98%E5%AE%AE%E8%A1%93 淘宮術] from [[Shogakukan]] Digital Daijisen&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hashimoto"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hashimoto|first=Atsuo|date=July 1967|title=Kaiun-Tokyujutsu and its modern interpretation|journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences|publisher=Wiley Periodicals|volume=3|issue=3|pages=236–255|doi=10.1002/1520-6696(196707)3:3&lt;236::AID-JHBS2300030303&gt;3.0.CO;2-V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marumitsu gained many followers from the upper and middle classes of [[Edo]]. In 1848 they were forbidden from taking disciples and holding meetings by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], but Marumitsu was not exiled like many other leaders of groups outside the [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhist]] institutions. The group survived underground and revived after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. Today Tōkyūjutsu is practiced by an organization called Tōdōkai.&lt;ref name="Sawada" /&gt;

== Biography ==
Celms was educated at the [[Art Academy of Latvia]]. He is considered one of the founders of [[kinetic art]] in Latvia due to his exploration of the artform in the 1960s. He became prominent in the Latvian artworld in the 1970s with his kinetic art, [[photomontage]]s and [[graphic design]].&lt;ref&gt;Līga Rušeniece. 14 November 2016.

In 2016 he published ''Baltu dievestības pamati'' ("Fundamentals of the Baltic Gods"), where he, influenced by [[Ernests Brastiņš]], [[Marija Gimbutas]] and [[Janīna Kursīte-Pakule]], gives an introduction to the Baltic deities and how to be aware of them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lsm.lv/raksts/dzive--stils/tautas-maksla/iznakusi-valda-celma-gramata-par-baltu-dievibam.a214812/ Iznākusi Valda Celma grāmata par baltu dievībām]. 15 December 2016.

[[File:Joseph Smith, Jr. portrait owned by Joseph Smith III.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], first leader of the Latter-day Saints (Mormons), made an 1843 statement, an apparently-embellished version of which, in around 1900, would become known as the White Horse Prophecy.]]

The '''White Horse Prophecy''' is the popular name given an influential but disputed version given by 
Edwin Rushton, in about 1900, of statements supposedly made in 1843 by [[Joseph Smith, Jr.]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], on the future of the [[Latter Day Saints]] (popularly called Mormons) and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://byustudies.byu.edu/journal-issue-ids/journal-493|journal = [[BYU Studies]]|title = Edwin Rushton as the Source of the White Horse Prophecy|author = Don L. Penrod|volume = 49|issue = 3|pages = 75&amp;ndash;115|year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latter Day Saints, according to Rushton's version, would "go to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and... be a great and mighty people," associated in the prophecy's figurative language, with one of the biblical [[four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] in the [[Book of Revelation]].  

Smith's supposed original statement predicts that the [[US Constitution]] will one day "hang like a thread" but be saved by Latter-day Saints. The embellished version portrays it to be "by the efforts of the White Horse."&lt;ref name=White_Horse_FAIR /&gt;

On the basis of either Rushton's version, which is widely known as "the White Horse Prophecy," or Smith's original statement, both some critics of Mormonism and some Mormon folk doctrine enthusiasts hold that Mormons should or actually expect that the US will eventually become a [[theocracy]] dominated by the LDS Church.&lt;ref name=Under_Gods /&gt;&lt;ref name=An_American_president /&gt; However, some observers interpret the Mormon cultural artifact more blandly.

The idea that members of the LDS Church will someday or at various times take action to save an imperiled  US Constitution has been referenced by numerous of LDS Church leaders, but as to the Rushton version of the Prophecy, the LDS Church has stated that "the so-called 'White Horse Prophecy'... is not embraced as Church doctrine; while numerous [[Mormon fundamentalists]] continue to preach the doctrine."&lt;ref name=LDS_Disclaimer /&gt;

==Background==
[[File:EdwinRushton.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Edwin Rushton, half a century after Joseph Smith's death, described what would become known as the White Horse Prophecy.]]

[[Latter Day Saint Church]] founder [[Joseph Smith, Jr.|Joseph Smith]] went to [[Washington, DC]], in November 1839 in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain help for his persecuted followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]] | last=Bushman | first=Richard L. | year=2005 | publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]] | place=[[New York City|New York]] | isbn=1-4000-4270-4 | pages=392–394 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pat Bagley]] of the ''[[Salt Lake Tribune]]'' wrote that from then on, Smith and his followers "considered themselves the last Real Americans" and "the legitimate heirs of the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|pilgrims]] and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]]," who would be called upon one day to save the US Constitution.&lt;ref name=I_Have_a_Question_1976_Stewart&gt;{{cite web | title=I Have a Question | magazine=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] | date=June 1976 | url=https://www.lds.org/ensign/1976/06/i-have-a-question?lang=eng | author=Stewart, D. Michael | accessdate=17 August 2015 | quote=The documents show that Joseph Smith did prophesy a number of times that the United States and the Constitution would be imperiled and that the elders would have a hand in saving them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "HPMilbank" /&gt; Smith is believed to have said in 1840 that when the Constitution hung by a thread, Latter Day Saint [[elder (Latter Day Saints)|elders]] would step in "on the  [[White horse (mythology)|white horse]]" to save the country.&lt;ref name = "HPMilbank" /&gt;

Joseph Smith is said to have made his statement in early May 1843, while the Latter Day Saints were headquartered in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]]. One of Smith's associates who heard the statement was Edwin Rushton. The most complete copy of Rushton's version of Joseph Smith's statement is contained in a 1902 diary entry made by John Roberts of [[Paradise, Utah]]. That rendering asserted that in his statement, Smith had prophesied that the Mormons "will go to the Rocky Mountains and will be a great and mighty people established there, which I will call the White Horse of peace and safety." Smith added "I shall never go there" and predicted continued persecution by enemies of the church, and he reportedly said, "You will see the Constitution of the United States almost destroyed. It will hang like a thread as fine as a silk fiber.... I love the Constitution; it was made by the inspiration of God; and it will be preserved and saved by the efforts of the White Horse, and by the Red Horse&lt;ref&gt;The identity of the "Red Horse" is not stated in the prophecy.&lt;/ref&gt; who will combine in its defense." Smith also said, according to the diary, that Mormons would send missionaries to "gather the honest in heart from among the Pale Horse, or people of the United States, to stand by the Constitution of the United States as it was given by the inspiration of God." The account quotes Smith as predicting numerous wars involving Great Britain, France, Russia, China, and other countries, and saying that the European nobility "knows that [Mormonism] is true, but it has not pomp enough, and grandeur and influence for them to yet embrace it." He is also reported to have said that a [[temple lot|temple]] that the Latter Day Saints had planned to build in [[Jackson County, Missouri]] "will be built in this generation."&lt;ref name=White_Horse_FAIR&gt;[http://www.fairlds.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cobabe-whitehorse.pdf "The White Horse Prophecy"], George Cobabe, [[Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research]] (2004).

In 1844, Smith rejected the platforms of the major candidates for [[president of the United States]] and decided to conduct his own third-party [[United States presidential election, 1844|campaign]]&lt;ref name=An_American_president&gt;{{cite news | author=Wolff, Elaine | title=An American president | newspaper=[[San Antonio Current]] | date=October 17, 2007 | page=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Smith|first=Joseph, Jr.|authorlink=Joseph Smith, Jr.|year=1844|title=General Smith's Views on the Powers and Policy of the Government of the United States|url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/NCMP1820-1846,2597| accessdate=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was cut short by his [[death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|murder]] on June 27 that year. After a [[succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]] in which [[Brigham Young]] was accepted as Smith's successor by the majority of the Latter Day Saints, the [[Mormon migration]] to the [[Intermountain West]] began, under Young's direction, in February 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=We'll Find the Place: The Mormon Exodus, 1846–1848 | author=Bennett, Richard E. | publisher=Deseret Book Company | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-8061-3838-1 | page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disputed authenticity==
The authenticity of the White Horse Prophecy is much disputed. Most of its symbolistic content was not attested to during Smith's lifetime but was instead asserted by Rushton many years after Smith's death.&lt;ref name=White_Horse_FAIR /&gt; Whereas a philosophical kernel in Rushton's version is confirmed by contemporary LDS Church leaders as having been taught by Smith, Rushton's formulation, as a whole, has often been repudiated by the LDS Church over the years since as early as 1918.&lt;ref name=penrod&gt;{{cite journal | author=Don L. Penrod | title=Edwin Rushton as the Source of the White Horse Prophecy | journal=[[BYU Studies]] | volume=49 | issue=3 | year=2010 | pages=75–131 | url=http://byustudies.byu.edu/showTitle.aspx?title=8625 | accessdate=November 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the White Horse Prophesy was included, along with mentions of its questioned authenticity, as an appendix within ''Prophecy: Key to the Future,'' by [[LDS canon|scriptural]] scholar and [[lay theologian]] Duane Crowther in 1962;&lt;ref name=Crowther_Prophecy&gt;{{cite book | author=Crowther, Duane S. | title=Prophecy, Key to the Future | publisher=Horizon Publishers | year=1962 | isbn=0-88290-781-6 | pages=301–322 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more recently, the Prophecy has been referenced in the writings of speculative theology by the [[Mormon fundamentalist]] [[Ogden Kraut]].&lt;ref name=Kraut&gt;{{cite book | author=Kraut, Ogden | title=The White Horse Prophecy | publisher=Pioneer Publishing | year=1993 | url=http://ogdenkraut.com/White%20Horse%20times%20new%20roman.htm | accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, LDS president [[Joseph F. Smith]] dismissed the White Horse Prophecy as a "ridiculous story... and a lot of trash that has been circulated about... by two of our brethren who put together some broken sentences from [Joseph Smith] that they may have heard from time to time."&lt;ref name=FAIR&gt;{{cite web | title=The White Horse Prophecy | author=Cobabe, George | url=http://www.fairmormon.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/cobabe-whitehorse.pdf | publisher=[[FairMormon]] | date=December 2011 | accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1966 book ''[[Mormon Doctrine (book)|Mormon Doctrine]]'', LDS theologian (and later [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]]) [[Bruce R. McConkie]] wrote, "From time to time, accounts of various supposed visions, revelations, and prophecies are spread forth by and among the Latter-day Saints, who should know better than to believe or spread such false information. One of these false and deceptive documents that has cropped up again and again for over a century is the so-called White Horse Prophecy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Mormon Doctrine | edition=2nd | author=McConkie, Bruce R. | publisher=Bookcraft | year=1966 | page=835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010, the LDS Church issued a statement stating that "the so-called 'White Horse Prophecy' is based on accounts that have not been substantiated by historical research and is not embraced as Church doctrine."&lt;ref name=LDS_Disclaimer&gt;[http://newsroom.lds.org/blog/2010/01/church-statement-on-white-horse-prophecy-and-political-neutrality.html "Church Statement on 'White Horse Prophecy' and Political Neutrality"], Public Affairs Department, LDS Church, January 6, 2010. Retrieved August 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2010, LDS historian Don L. Penrod examined significant differences in two early handwritten accounts of the prophecy, noted some words and phrases that were not characteristic of Joseph Smith's speaking style or current in his time, and speculated that Rushton had "in his elderly years recorded some things that [Smith] actually said, mixing in words of his own creation." It additionally noted that "memories of words and events, especially many years later, are often faulty."&lt;ref name=penrod/&gt;

==Similar statements==
Several sources attribute to Smith the idea that the US Constitution would one day hang by a thread, and LDS Church leaders have issued similar warnings about the Constitution.&lt;ref name=HPMilbank /&gt;&lt;ref name=White_Horse_White_House /&gt;

In 1855, [[Brigham Young]] reportedly wrote that "when the Constitution of the United States hangs, as it were, upon a single thread, they will have to call for the 'Mormon' Elders to save it from utter destruction; and they will step forth and do it."&lt;ref name="HPMilbank" /&gt;&lt;ref name=JD_2_182&gt;''[[s:Journal of Discourses/Volume 2/The Priesthood and Satan, etc.|A discourse by President Brigham Young]]'', delivered in the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle|Tabernacle]], [[Salt Lake City|Great Salt Lake City]], February 18, 1855.

===Orson Hyde===
In 1858, [[Orson Hyde]], another contemporary of Smith, wrote that Smith believed "the time would come when the Constitution and the country would be in danger of an overthrow; and... if the Constitution be saved at all, it will be by the elders of [the LDS] Church."&lt;ref name="HPMilbank" /&gt;&lt;ref name=JD_6_152&gt;''[[s:Journal of Discourses/Volume 6/Self-Government, etc.|A sermon by Elder Orson Hyde]]'', delivered in the Tabernacle, Great Salt Lake City, January 3, 1858.

Yes, but it will still hang, and there will be enough of good people, many who may not belong to our Church at all, people who have respect for law and for order, and for Constitutional rights, who will rally around with us and save the Constitution."&lt;ref name="Tears_Milbank"&gt;{{cite book | title=Tears of a Clown: Glenn Beck and the Tea Bagging of America | author=Milbank, Dana | page=48 | publisher=Doubleday | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-385-53388-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melvin J. Ballard===
In 1928, the LDS [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|apostle]] [[Melvin J. Ballard]] remarked that "the prophet Joseph Smith said the time will come when, through secret organizations taking the law into their own hands... the Constitution of the United States would be so torn and rent asunder, and life and property and peace and security would be held of so little value, that the Constitution would, as it were, hang by a thread. This Constitution will be preserved, but it will be preserved very largely in consequence of what the Lord has revealed and what [the Mormons], through listening to the Lord and being obedient, will help to bring about, to stabilize and give permanency and effect to the Constitution itself. That also is our mission."&lt;ref name = "Tears_Milbank" /&gt;

===J. Reuben Clark===
In 1942, [[J. Reuben Clark]], an LDS apostle and a member of the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], said that "You and I have heard all our lives that the time may come when the Constitution may hang by a thread.... I do know that whether it shall live or die is now in the balance." On the Constitution, Clark went on to cite its "free institutions," [[separation of powers under the United States Constitution|separation of powers]], and the [[Bill of Rights (United States)|Bill of Rights]]. He added that "if we are to live as a Church, and progress, and have the right to worship... we must have the great guarantees that are set up by our Constitution."&lt;ref name=Clark_1942&gt;{{cite web | title=Private Ownership...under the United Order | magazine=Conference Report | date=October 1942 | pages=54–59 | url=http://scriptures.byu.edu/gettalk.php?ID=43 | accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ezra Taft Benson===
In a 1986 [[Brigham Young University]] speech, LDS president [[Ezra Taft Benson]] stated, "I have faith that the Constitution will be saved as prophesied by Joseph Smith. But it will not be saved in Washington. It will be saved by the citizens of this nation who love and cherish freedom. It will be saved by enlightened members of this Church – men and women who will subscribe to and abide by the principles of the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;Ezra Taft Benson, [http://www.latterdayconservative.com/ezra-taft-benson/the-constitution-a-heavenly-banner/ The Constitution: A Heavenly Banner], ''Latter Day Conservative'', (16 September 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dallin H. Oaks===
In 2010, Elder [[Dallin H. Oaks]] spoke at a Constitution Day Celebration and warned about the importance of preserving the US Constitution. To that end, he claimed that "all citizens—whatever their religious or philosophical persuasion" should maintain several responsibilities regarding the Constitution: understand it, support the law, practice civic virtue, maintain civility in political discourse, and promote patriotism.&lt;ref&gt;Oaks, Dallin H.

September 17, 2010. http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/fundamentals-of-our-constitutions-elder-dallin-h-oaks&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Questions on LDS attitudes towards the United States government, whether they are considered on their own or as parts of the White Horse Prophecy, have arisen from time to time as prominent Latter-day Saints have become involved in American politics. The White Horse Prophecy has been characterized as "effectively plac[ing] believers on perpetual Red Alert for the Constitution's possible demise"&lt;ref name=Latterday_Taint&gt;{{cite news | author=Reilly, Adam | title=Latterday Taint | newspaper=[[Boise Weekly]] | date=October 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as admonishing Mormons to "come to the rescue and restore the true Constitution by any means necessary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Wurth, Michael | title=Teabooking 101: Tears of a Clown: Glenn Beck and the Tea Bagging of America | newspaper=[[San Antonio Current]] | date=January 19, 2011 | page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writers such as [[Richard Abanes]] and Elaine Wolff have speculated, on the basis of the prophecy, that Mormons expect that the US will eventually become a "Mormon-ruled theocracy divinely ordained to 'not only direct the political affairs of the Mormon community, but eventually those of the United States and ultimately the worldk'"&lt;ref name=Under_Gods&gt;''[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1568582838 One Nation Under Gods: A History of the Mormon Church],'' [[Richard Abanes]], [[Basic Books]] (2003), p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "a Mormon, if he were elected president, would take his orders from Salt Lake City."&lt;ref name=An_American_president /&gt;

Besides many LDS members of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], some LDS [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have also been inspired to run for office by the White Horse Prophecy.&lt;ref name=White_Horse_White_House&gt;{{cite news | author=Sheffield, Carrie | title=Houses of Worship: White Horse in the White House | newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] | date=November 3, 2006 | page=13 | quote=Still, the prophecy continues to inspire Mormons to run for office, on both sides of the aisle.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romney family===
In 1967, US presidential candidate [[George W. Romney]] said the following on the White Horse Prophecy:  "I have always felt that they meant that sometime the question of whether we are going to proceed on the basis of the Constitution would arise and at this point government leaders who were Mormons would be involved in answering that question."&lt;ref name=Romney_Trib /&gt; In 2007, US presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]], George's son, told the ''Salt Lake Tribune'', "I haven't heard my name associated with [the White Horse Prophecy] or anything of that nature.  That's not official church doctrine.... I don't put that at the heart of my religious belief."&lt;ref name=Romney_Trib /&gt;&lt;ref name=Beck_AOL&gt;{{cite web | publisher=AOL News | url=http://www.aolnews.com/2010/10/05/is-glenn-beck-attempting-to-fulfill-the-mormon-white-horse-prop/ | title=Is Glenn Beck Attempting to Fulfill the Mormon 'White Horse Prophecy'? | date=October 5, 2010 | accessdate=August 27, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824102649/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/10/05/is-glenn-beck-attempting-to-fulfill-the-mormon-white-horse-prop/ | archivedate=August 24, 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Romney_Trib&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=[[Salt Lake Tribune]] | title=Romney candidacy has resurrected last days prophecy of Mormon saving the Constitution | date=June 4, 2007 | url=http://www.sltrib.com/lds/ci_6055090 | accessdate=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Conservatism in the United States|Conservative]] media figure [[Glenn Beck]], who joined the LDS Church in 1999, has alleged that President [[Barack Obama]] "is going to bring us to the verge of shredding the Constitution, of massive socialism."&lt;ref name=HPMilbank /&gt; On November 14, 2008, after Obama's election, Beck appeared on [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]]'s show ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' and said that "we are at the place where the Constitution hangs in the balance, I feel the Constitution is hanging in the balance right now, hanging by a thread unless the good Americans wake up."&lt;ref name = "HPMilbank"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dana-milbank/post_996_b_749750.html?view=print Mormon Prophecy Behind Glenn Beck's Message] by [[Dana Milbank]], ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', October 5, 2010. Retrieved August 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier in November, while interviewing [[US Senator]] [[Orrin Hatch]] of Utah, also a Mormon, Beck had remarked, "I heard Barack Obama talk about the Constitution and I thought, we are at the point or we are very near the point where our Constitution is hanging by a thread."&lt;ref name = "HPMilbank" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Latter_Day_Taint&gt;{{cite news | author=Reilly, Adam | title=Latter-Day Taint | newspaper=[[Salt Lake City Weekly]] | date=December 3, 2009 | pages=20–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glennbeck.com/content/articles/article/196/17711/ Glenn Beck with Sen.

LDS blogger and religious commentator [[Joanna Brooks]] has said that "it is likely that Beck owes his brand of Founding Father–worship to Mormonism....

In 2009, Idaho [[Idaho gubernatorial election, 2010|gubernatorial]] candidate [[Rex Rammell]] announced plans to hold a series of meetings with believing Mormon men, which were to include discussion of the White Horse Prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=Rexburg Standard Journal | location=[[Rexburg, Idaho]] | title=Rammell unapologetic about meeting with LDS elders | date=December 23, 2009 | url=http://www.rexburgstandardjournal.com/news/rammell-unapologetic-about-meeting-with-lds-elders/article_720058ba-227b-556a-9fbf-51d192ec1186.html | accessdate=December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=Deseret News | title=Idaho candidate Rammell holding LDS meetings | date=December 22, 2009 | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705353413/Idaho-candidate-Rammell-holding-LDS-meetings.html | accessdate=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, LDS Church officials issued a statement that said that the church is "politically neutral" and hoped that "the campaign practices of political candidates would not suggest that their candidacy is supported by or connected to the church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=Deseret News | title=LDS Church responds to Idaho candidate's 'elders only' meetings | date=December 26, 2009 | url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705379759/LDS-Church-responds-to-Idaho-candidates-elders-only-meetings.html | accessdate=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=Rexburg Standard Journal | title=LDS Church issues statement on Rex Rammell | date=December 24, 2009 | url=http://www.rexburgstandardjournal.com/news/lds-church-issues-statement-on-rex-rammell/article_ad0674be-53ce-55e4-aad6-c070e10ab848.html | accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rammell later retracted his original plan to limit his meetings to LDS men and apologized to "all those citizens who are not members of the LDS faith, who have expressed a sincere interest in attending my meetings and discussing this prophecy and how we can step forward and save the United States Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=Rexburg Standard Journal | title=Rammell apologizes for LDS elders only meetings | date=January 9, 2010 | url=http://www.rexburgstandardjournal.com/news/rammell-apologizes-for-lds-elders-only-meetings/article_8c7e05cf-4430-59c8-bdd4-f35158a23cdd.html | accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was produced by Tyler, the Creator. The single was released [[Music download|digitally]] on February 14, 2011. The song received controversy due to its violent lyrics and numerous "[[Diss track|disses]]", although it was critically acclaimed, landing on numerous year-end lists. Tyler also directed a [[music video]] for the single, which was also met with positive critical reception, giving Tyler the [[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist]] at the [[2011 MTV Video Music Awards]].

==Background==
The song's title is named after the city of [[Yonkers, New York]]. Tyler claimed to have created the beat in eight minutes as a parody of a typical '90s [[New York City|New York]] hip hop instrumental.&lt;ref&gt;https://pitchfork.com/news/63619-tyler-the-creator-yonkers-was-made-as-a-joke/&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Dude, niggas don't know that that beat was made as a joke. I was trying to make a shitty New York beat and we was just rapping like we was from New York like we were retarded. And then, I just had some random verses and I was just like 'I'll just record it to this beat, this beat is kinda cool.' And then niggas really liked it. That's so nuts, because that shit was actually a fucking joke. I made that beat in literally eight minutes.}}

==Content and controversy==

Tyler, the Creator also disses Mars in [[Game (rapper)|Game]]'s song "[[Martians vs. Goblins]]", in which he and [[Lil Wayne]] are featured artists. In response, B.o.B released a similar diss track, entitled "No Future" that also references Tyler's group, Odd Future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/singles/id.14325/title.bob-no-future-odd-future-diss |title=B.o.B., "No Future [Odd Future Diss]" |author= |date=25 March 2011 |work=Hip Hop DX |publisher= |accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyler praised the song, and initially did not think it was a diss track.&lt;ref name=response&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.com/2011/05/bruno-mars-responds-tyler-creators-dis/ |title=Bruno Mars Responds to Tyler, the Creator's Dis |author=Goodman, William |date=10 May 2011 |work= |publisher=''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' |accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruno Mars, in response to the verse "stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus", said, "[Tyler] has to wait in line if he wants to stab me...[Tyler's] definitely not the first guy that's said something like that to me and he's not going to be the last."&lt;ref name=response /&gt; The late American rapper Capital Steez sampled it in his song "Negus", using the same opening line: "I'm a fucking walking paradox".&lt;ref name=xxlrev&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xxlmag.com/features/2011/12/top-100-songs-of-2011/#80 |title=Top 100 Songs of 2011 |author= |date=15 December 2011 |work= |publisher=''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' |accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/may/11/bruno-mars-tyler-creator |title=Bruno Mars: Tyler, the Creator will have to wait in line to stab me |author=Martin, Dan |date=11 May 2011 |work= |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
