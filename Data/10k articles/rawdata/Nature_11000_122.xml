'''2008 HJ''' is a sub-kilometer [[asteroid]], classified as [[near-Earth object]] of the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollo group]].

It was discovered by [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research|Lincoln Laboratory ETS]], New Mexico. Observers M. Bezpalko, D. Torres, R. Kracke, G. Spitz, J. Kistler. [Richard Miles using the [[Faulkes Telescope South]] at [[Siding Spring Observatory]], [[Australia]] determined that the asteroid rotates rapidly. It measures only 12 m by 24 m and is very dense, having a mass of about 5,000 [[tonne]]s. If the asteroid were not dense, it is probable that the rapid rotation would cause the asteroid to disrupt and fly apart.

At the time of discovery, {{mp|2008 HJ}} had the smallest known [[period of revolution|rotation period]] in the [[Solar System]], completing one revolution every 42.7 seconds.&lt;ref name=jpldata/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

It is listed on the [[Sentry (monitoring system)|Sentry Risk Table]] with a 1 in 17,000 chance of [[Impact event|impacting]] Earth on May 2, 2081.&lt;ref name=summary/&gt; An impact from this object would be comparable to the [[Chelyabinsk meteor]].

'''Samantha Davon James''' (born December 18, 1986), better known by her stage name '''3D Na'Tee''', is an American [[rapper]], songwriter, and video director. She was born in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and grew up in the [[3rd Ward of New Orleans|3rd Ward]]. 3D Na'Tee has been featured on several national media outlets such as [[MTV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MTV: SuckaFree Freestyle: 3D Na'Tee|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/651008/sucker-freestyle-3dnatee.jhtml|accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Source (magazine)|The Source Magazine]],&lt;ref name="thesource"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE SOURCE MAGAZINE: Top Up &amp; Coming Female Rapper Releases Her Latest Project|url=http://www.thesource.com/articles/235038/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[XXL (magazine)|XXL Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=XXL: Surviving The Times: Erick Sermon Talks About New Mixtape, Digital Label &amp; Reviving Skills|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/features/2012/05/surviving-the-times-erick-sermon-talks-about-new-mixtape-digital-label-reviving-skills/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SHAHEEM REID: 5 STAR REVIEW FROM XXL'S EDITOR-AT-LARGE SHAHEEM REID &amp; @TEAMSHAHEEM|url=http://3dnatee.com/main/?p=1340}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fader Magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE FADER MAGAZINE: Features 3D Na'Tee - Lil Kim|url=http://www.thefader.com/index.php?s=na%27tee&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0&amp;submit=Go}}&lt;/ref&gt; RapRadar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAPRADAR: RapRadar Search Features|url=http://rapradar.com/?s=3D+na%27tee&amp;x=0&amp;y=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and RapRehab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAPREHAB: RapRehab's Featured Artist|url=http://raprehab.com/2012/08/3d-natee-new-orleans/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also received attention from Louisiana newspapers and music magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE SMOKING SECTION: 3D Na'Tee is Back and we have been invited to her Coronation|url=http://smokingsection.uproxx.com/TSS/2012/07/3d-natee-the-coronation-mixtape}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NOLA.COM: 4X Nola HipHop Award Winner 3D Na'Tee Raises The Bar Again By Being The First Native HipHop Artist With A Mobile App|url=http://www.nola.com/music/index.ssf/2011/09/industry_influence_celebrates.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
In her middle school years, 3D Na'Tee honed her skills by what is called in New Orleans, ribbin' (rib - ing). Most people know this as "Playing the Dozens". Someone would start a beat by beating on a lunch room table or a garbage can, and off she went, lyrically attacking someone who was bold enough to test her skill. The rhymes were mostly about what they were wearing, how lame they were, or silly they looked.

In 1999, she began recording with local label called '''Clientell Records'''. Over the next five years, she would record multiple mixtapes under the "Snypa Squad" and feature on other projects Clientell Records came out with. However, in 2006, a year after [[Hurricane Katrina]], Clientell Records dismantled and 3D Na'Tee, who had previously established herself as a battler rapper amongst the local rap scene in New Orleans, released her first mix tape project '''"3's Company Vol.1: The Rapper, The Hustler, the Diva"''' followed by '''Volume 2''' in 2007. After the release of her second project, she appeared on '''The Kush 2''' DVD which was produced by [[YMCMB]] president [[Mack Maine]]. The DVD featured other Cash Money/Young Money artist like [[Lil Wayne]], [[Nicki Minaj]], and [[Birdman (entertainer)|Birdman]] as well as [[Curren$y]] of [[Warner Bros. Records]]

==Career==
After the local success of her first two releases and her critically acclaimed appearance on '''The Kush 2''', she released her third mix tape '''Heavy Is the head That Wears The Crown''' followed by a music video for a song she titled, '''Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner'''. That video piqued the interest of [[G-Unit Records]] affiliate and [[Shade 45]] [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius XM]] radio host Nelson Gomez who invited her to [[New York City|New York]] for an interview on his XM show as well as on rapper [[50 Cent|50 Cents']] wildly popular ThisIs50.com website. Soon after, the talk of her third release also got her featured in HipHop Weekly Magazine by [[Benzino]], former co-owner of [[The Source Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=3DNATEE.COM: BIO|url=http://3dnatee.com/main/?page_id=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of video releases like Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner which spoofed many mainstream hip hop artists, 3D Na'Tee's music has been described as controversial and sometimes offensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WOMEN OF HIPHOP: 3D Na'Tee Explains How HipHop Saved Her Life, Talks Female Rap, and More|url=http://thewomenofhiphop.com/2012/08/04/wohh-exclusive-3d-natee-explains-how-hip-hop-saved-her-lifetalks-female-rap-more/}}&lt;/ref&gt; That song also shared the title of her for mix tape released in 2010.

'''Guess Who's Coming 2 Dinner''' (The Mixtape) lead to 3D Na'Tee being nominated for a total of 5 Nola HipHop Awards by her in her home town at the NOLA Hiphop Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OFFBEAT MAGAZINE: Nola HipHop Awards Nominees Finalized|url=http://www.offbeat.com/2010/10/14/nola-underground-hip-hop-award-nominees-finalized/}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won three awards (the most awards won by a single artist) for '''Lyricist of the Year''', '''Mixtape of the Year''', and '''Female Artist of the Year'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASHLEE NICOLE SPILLS: Winners of the 2010 HipHop Awards Announced|url=http://www.ashleenicolespills.com/2010/10/20/winners-of-the-2010-nola-underground-hip-hop-awards/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mixtape included collaborations from [[Curren$y]] (courtesy of Warner Bros. Records), '''Ebony Eyez''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STL TODAY: Ebony Eyez Returns With A Story 2 Tell|url=http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/music/ebony-eyez-returns-with-a-story-to-tell/article_6a65d3ae-d2bb-11e1-985c-0019bb30f31a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Babs Bunny''' (formally of [[Sean Combs|Sean "Diddy" Combs]]) founded group, [[Da Band]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SYFFAL: Forming Da Band|url=http://www.syffal.com/making-the-band}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALL MUSIC.COM: Da Band's Discography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/da-band-mn0000764981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2011 3D Na'Tee was featured on [[MTV|MTV's]] SuckerFree Freestyle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MTV: SUCKERFREE FREESTYLE: 3DNATEE|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/misc/651008/sucker-freestyle-3dnatee.jhtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosted by [[DJ Envy]]. 3D Na'Tee and Syleena collaborated on a song called '''Go Head'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RHAPSODY: Syleena Johnson|url=http://www.rhapsody.com/artist/syleena-johnson/album/chapter-v-underrated/track/go-head-feat-natee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

July 27, 2011 3D Na'Tee released a video for '''Switch'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WORLDSTARHIPHOP: 3D Na'Tee's Switch|url=http://hp-www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video800.php?v=wshhd71614snrClf6d9H&amp;set_size=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she shot and edited herself. The song included several previously released instrumental versions of songs produced by super producer [[Timbaland]]. This video gained her a nomination for '''Director of the Year''' and an award for '''Video of the Year'''. Because of the momentum the Switch video gained the day of its release, Timbaland viewed it online and in less than 24 hours, flew 3D Na'Tee to [[The Hit Factory|Miami's Hit Factory Studio]] to work with her on her next project, The Coronation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE FADER MAGAZINE: 3D Na'Tee - Lil Kim|url=http://www.thefader.com/2012/07/30/video-natee-lil-kim/#comments}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ONWAX MAGAZINE: Rapper 3D Na'Tee shoots 'Wild' video in New Orleans, produced by Lex Luger|url=http://onwaxmagazine.com/owm/index.php/rapper-3d-natee-shoots-wild-video-in-new-orleans-produced-by-lex-luger/}}&lt;/ref&gt; After several months spent traveling with Timbaland and other artist signed to his label, a contract was presented to 3D Na'Tee to sign to Timbaland's production company [[Mosley Music Group|Mosely Music Group]] and to be managed by members of Timbaland's management team. 3D Na'Tee and Timbaland later announced via [[Twitter]] that she was no longer a part of Timbaland's company because she decided not to sign the contract presented. In a later interview, 3D Na'Tee explained that there was no ill feelings towards Timbaland and cited her reasons for not signing were strictly because of contractual clauses that could not be agreed upon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DJSMALLZ.COM: INTERVIEW: SOUTHERN SMOKE TV! 3D NA'TEE (@3DNATEE) SPEAKS ON TURNING DOWN RECORD DEAL WITH TIMBALAND|url=http://www.djsmallz.com/blog/2012/5/18/interview-southern-smoke-tv-3d-natee-3dnatee-speaks-on-turni.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WOMEN OF HIPHOP: [WOHH EXCLUSIVE]!|url=http://thewomenofhiphop.com/2012/08/04/wohh-exclusive-3d-natee-explains-how-hip-hop-saved-her-lifetalks-female-rap-more/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exactly two years after 3D Na'Tee's last mix tape release, she released her highly anticipated street album ''The Coronation'' which featured artists like [[Keri Hilson]], Young Fletcher, and Lyrica Anderson. The Coronation also featured production from Mizay Entertainment's [[Lex Luger (producer)|Lex Luger]], [[Maybach Music Group|Maybach Music Group's]] Yung Shun, Heartbeatz, Casa Di, Versive Manhattan, Serious Beats, Da Smokestarz, among others.

In August 2012 it was announced by DJ Skee, Sirius Satellite Radio Host, that the first release from The Coronation entitled '''NO LOVE''' produced by [[Maybach Music Group|MMG's]] '''Young Shun''' was the #9 most requested song in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SIRIUS XM: #9 Song in the Country|url=https://twitter.com/DontHateBeHated/status/235174781102747648}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coronation's second release, '''Lil Kim''' produced by '''Casa Di''' gained tons of recognition as well as it was featured on both [[The Source (magazine)|The Source]] and [[The Fader]] Magazines' websites.&lt;ref name="thesource" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FADER MAGAZINE: 3D Na'Tee Releases Lil Kim|url=http://www.thefader.com/2012/07/30/video-natee-lil-kim/#comments}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lil Kim was a cautionary tale of a young girl with an absentee father who, because of her father's absence, unfortunately grew up and "fell in love" too fast. The song and its video (directed by Charley Mac), gained a lot of attention from tons of hiphop artist like [[Trina]], [[Missy Elliott]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WEBSTAGRAM: Trina Talks to 3D Na'Tee about 'Lil Kim|url=http://web.stagram.com/p/251601262639516075_14212753}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Grammy Award Winning [[Chamillionaire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BIG DOOR: Chamillionaire|url=http://www.bigdoor.com/company/press/grammy-award-winning-artist-and-bigdoor-ceo-to-speak-at-gamification-summit/}}&lt;/ref&gt; who featured 3D Na'Tee's video on his famed social site [https://web.archive.org/web/20120802044043/http://www.chamillionaire.com/videos/play/608 www.chamillionaire.com].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1134">An '''anemoscope''' is a device invented to show the direction of the [[wind]], or to foretell a change of wind direction or weather.

[[Hygroscopic]] devices, in particular those utilizing [[catgut]], were considered as very good anemoscopes, seldom failing to foretell the shifting of the wind.{{cn|date=March 2015}} The ancient anemoscope seems, by [[Vitruvius]]'s description of it, to have been intended to show which way the wind actually blew, rather than to foretell into which quarter it would change.

[[Otto von Guericke]] gave the title ''anemoscope'' to a machine invented by him to foretell the change of the weather, as to fair and rain. It consisted of a small wooden man who rose and fell in a glass tube as the atmospheric [[pressure]] increased or decreased. Accordingly, [[M. Comiers]] has shown that this was simply an application of the common [[barometer]]. This form{{huh?|date=March 2015}} of the anemoscope was invented by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

'''Angolan miombo woodlands''' cover most of central Angola and extend into the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. This is part of the larger [[miombo]] ecosystem that covers much of eastern and southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Angolan_Miombo_woodlands/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111064725/http://www.eoearth.org/article/Angolan_Miombo_woodlands/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-01-11|title=Angolan Miombo woodlands - Encyclopedia of Earth|date=2008-01-11|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location and description==
This area of savanna and woodland covers an area of plateau and gentle hills in central Angola, in the [[Okavango River|Cubango]]-Zambezi Basin which drains into the [[Zambezi River]] to the east. The area lies east of the range of hills that parallel the Atlantic coast and north of the [[Kalahari Desert]] reaching up as far as the rainforests of the Congo.

It has a [[tropical climate]], wetter than the surrounding savanna, with most of the rain falling in the hotter summer months (November–March).&lt;ref&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=at0701|name=Angolan Miombo woodlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
The [[flora]] is moist [[deciduous]] broadleaf [[savanna]] and woodland. Between these areas is open [[grassland]]. Three species of tree dominate [[miombo]] woodland: ''[[Brachystegia]]'', ''[[Julbernardia]]'', and ''[[Isoberlinia]]''. Under the trees there is a rich variety of other flora while the grassland areas in the region lie on sandy soil. One particular feature of miombo woodland is its vulnerability to fire, as the area is dry most of the year round.

==Fauna==
[[Fauna]] inhabiting the area include a number of bird species and mammals including the [[giant sable antelope]]. Endemic mammals include [[Vernay's climbing mouse]] (''Dendromus vernayi''). Large mammals include [[giraffe]] (in the wetter areas), [[bushbuck]] (''Tragelaphus scriptus''), [[blue duiker]] (''Cephalophus monticola'') and [[yellow-backed duiker]] (''C. silvicultor'') in the thickly wooded areas and giraffe, [[sitatunga]] (''Tragelaphus spekei'') and [[waterbuck]] (''Kobus ellipsiprymnus'') in the wetter areas, with [[tsessebe]] (''Damaliscus lunatus'') in the grasslands.

Other large mammals found in the ecoregion include [[hippopotamus]] (''Hippopotamus amphibius''), [[zebra]] (''Equus burchellii''), and their predators such as [[lion]] (''Panthera leo''), [[leopard]] (''P. pardus''), [[cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus''), [[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus''), [[side-striped jackal]] (''Canis adustus'') and [[spotted hyaena]] (''Crocuta crocuta'') as well as smaller carnivores such as  [[wild cat]] (''Felis sylvestris''), [[serval]] (''F. serval''), [[caracal]] (''F. caracal'') and, appropriately the [[Angolan genet]] (''Genetta angolensis''). Before the [[Angolan Civil War]] in the 1970s the area was home to large populations of [[elephant]]s and [[black rhinoceros]] but these have almost completely been removed, mainly by poachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://worldwildlife.org/wildworld/profiles/photos/at/at0701aS.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007180042/http://worldwildlife.org/wildworld/profiles/photos/at/at0701aS.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-10-07|title=Terrestrial Ecoregions -- Angolan Miombo woodlands (AT0701)|date=2006-10-07|access-date=2017-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only known endemic bird species is the [[black-tailed cisticola]] (''Cisticola melanura'') although there is a fairly rich selection of bird life. Following rains the following can be found in the wetlands: [[greater swamp-warbler]] (''Acrocephalus rufescens''), [[African yellow warbler]] (''Iduna natalensis''), [[chirping cisticola]] (''Cisticola pipiens''), [[Bocage's weaver]] (''Ploceus temporalis''), [[saddle-billed stork]] (''Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis''), [[marabou stork]] (''Leptoptilos crumeniferus''), [[Goliath heron]] (''Ardea goliath''), and [[wattled crane]] (''Bugeranus carunculatus'').

Amphibians are less common. They include two endemic frog species, ''[[Hildebrandtia ornatissima]]'' and ''[[Leptopelis anchietae]]'', plus one that is found almost entirely in this region, ''[[Hyperolius vilhenai]]''.

Finally, in miombo woodland the many [[termites]] and [[caterpillars]] play an important role in clearing leaves.

==Urban areas and settlements==
Towns and cities in the region include [[Kuito]], [[Menongue]] and [[Luena, Moxico Province|Luena]] all areas that saw much conflict during the 1975-2002 [[Angolan Civil War]].

==Threats==
The intense and long-lasting civil war has caused immense damage to this environment, leaving the forests exposed to poaching and uncontrolled clearance, and conservation has obviously become a low priority issue for the government. Also due to this conflict the area cannot be properly studied by scientists. However the woodland is not threatened by clearance for agriculture or logging as along with the effects of war there are other factors keeping the population of the region to a minimum; the sandy soil does not sustain agriculture, and the woods and grassland are rife with [[tsetse fly]]. Some forest is being cleared on the edge of towns or for strip-mining.

There are a number of Angolan national parks in the area, but these have had to be abandoned at various periods due to the fighting. One of these in particular [[Cangandala National Park]] is an important haven for the giant sable antelope.

[[File:Alfons Mucha - 1896 - Spring.jpg|thumb|upright|''Spring'' ([[Alfons Mucha]], 1896)]]
'''Antheia''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀνθεία}}) was one of the [[Charites]], or Graces, of [[Greek mythology]] and was the goddess of flowers and [[Wreath (attire)|flowery wreaths]]. She was depicted in [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Athenian vase painting]] as one of the attendants of [[Aphrodite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Kharities | url=http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/Kharites.html | publisher=Theoi Project | accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her name Antheia is derived from the Ancient Greek word [[wikt:ἄνθος#Ancient_Greek|ἄνθος]] means "flower" or "[[blossom]]".  Her symbols are gold colored items.  She was known to the Romans as Anthea. Her center of worship was on the island of [[Crete]]. The name Antheia was also given to [[Hera]] and connected to the [[Horae]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Joan V. O'Brien | year=1993 | title=The Transformation of Hera | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0847678083 | page=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; under which she had a temple at [[Argos]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''[[Description of Greece]]'' ii. 22. § 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also an [[epithet]] of Aphrodite at [[Knossos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=R. F. Willetts | year=1977 | title=The Civilization of Ancient Crete |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520034066 |page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Aphrodite}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the goddess of [[Vegetation deity|vegetation]], gardens, blossoms, especially worshipped in [[Spring (season)|spring]] and near [[lowland]]s and [[marsh]]lands, favorable to the growth of vegetation. She was also the goddess of [[love|human love]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Ramesh Chopra | year=2005 | title=Academic Dictionary Of Mythology | url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=8182052327 | page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antheia is also the Greek name of Ancient [[Sozopolis, Thrace|Sozopolis]] in modern Bulgaria, and another Antheia was a village which was later adopted into [[Patras]] around 1000 BC.

In [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]] mythology, '''Asintmah''' is an earth and nature [[goddess]]; the first woman on Earth.

== Asintmah Corona ==
In 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]]'s Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (IAU/WGPSN) officially adopted the name ''Asintmah'' for a [[Corona (planetary geology)|corona]] on the planet [[Venus]].

Asintmah Corona is located at latitude 25.9° North, longitude 208.0° West.  The diameter of this surface feature is {{convert|150.0|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

'''Base-richness''' in [[ecology]] is the level in water or [[soil]] of [[Base (chemistry)|chemical base]]s, such as [[calcium]] or [[magnesium]] [[ion]]s.  Many [[organism]]s are restricted to base-rich environments.  Chemical bases are [[alkali]]s, and so '''base-rich''' environments are [[pH|neutral]] or alkaline.  Because '''base-poor''' environments have few bases, they are dominated by environmental [[acid]]s (usually [[organic acid]]s) and so are [[pH|acidic]].  However, the relationship between base-richness and acidity is not a rigid one &amp;ndash; changes in the levels of acids (such as [[Carbonic acid|dissolved carbon dioxide]]) may significantly change acidity without affecting base-richness.  

Base-rich terrestrial environments are characteristic of areas where the underlying rocks are [[limestone]].  [[Seawater]] is also base-rich, so maritime and [[Ocean|marine]] environments are themselves base-rich.

Base-poor environments are characteristic of areas where the underlying rocks are [[sandstone]] or [[granite]], or where the water is derived directly from rainfall ([[ombrotrophic]]).

==Examples of base-rich environments==
* [[Calcareous grassland]]
* [[Fen]]
* [[Limestone pavement]]
* [[Maquis shrubland]]
* [[Taxus|Yew]] woodland

==Examples of base-poor environments==
* [[Bog]]
* [[Heath (habitat)]]
* [[Poor fen]]
* [[Moorland]]
* [[Pine]] woodland
* [[Tundra]]

[[Amsterdam]], capital of the [[Netherlands]], has more than one hundred kilometers of ''[[gracht]]en'' ([[canal]]s), about 90 [[island]]s and 1,500 [[bridge]]s. The three main canals (Herengracht, Prinsengracht and Keizersgracht), dug in the 17th century during the [[Dutch Golden Age]], form concentric belts around the city, known as the [[Grachtengordel_(Amsterdam)|Grachtengordel]]. Alongside the main canals are 1550 [[Monument|monumental buildings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monumenten Amsterdam|work=Monumenten en Archeologie Amsterdam|publisher=[[Amsterdam|City of Amsterdam]]|url=http://www.bmz.amsterdam.nl/adam/uk/intro/intro.html|accessdate=2008-02-22|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208132713/http://www.bmz.amsterdam.nl/adam/uk/intro/intro.html|archivedate=2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17th-century canal ring area, including the Prinsengracht, Keizersgracht, Herengracht and Jordaan, were listed as [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site|World Heritage Site]] in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1349|title=Seventeenth-century canal ring area of Amsterdam inside the Singelgracht - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|publisher=Whc.unesco.org|accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributing to Amsterdam's fame as the "[[Venice of the North]]".&lt;ref name="Venice1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amsterdamhotspots.nl/architecture.html|title=Amsterdamhotspots.nl|accessdate=2007-04-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404161938/http://www.amsterdamhotspots.nl/architecture.html|archive-date=2007-04-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Venice3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldexecutive.com/cityguides/amsterdam/|title=World Executive City Guides - Amsterdam|accessdate=2007-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Much of the Amsterdam canal system is the successful outcome of [[city planning]]. In the early part of the 17th century, with [[immigration]] rising, a comprehensive plan was put together, calling for four main, concentric half-circles of canals with their ends resting on the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] Bay. Known as the "grachtengordel",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jlgrealestate.com/English/Amsterdam/Grachtengordel/|title=Grachtengordel|publisher=Jlgrealestate.com|accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; three of the canals are mostly for residential development (Herengracht or ‘’Patricians' Canal’’; Keizersgracht or ‘’Emperor's Canal’’; and Prinsengracht or ‘’Prince's Canal’’), and a fourth, outer canal, the Singelgracht, for purposes of defense and water management. The plan also envisaged interconnecting canals along radii; a set of parallel canals in the [[Jordaan]] quarter (primarily for the transportation of goods, for example, beer); the conversion of an existing, inner  perimeter canal (Singel) from a defensive purpose to residential and commercial development; and more than one hundred bridges. The defensive purpose of the Nassau/Stadhouderskade was served by moat and [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthen dikes]], with gates at transit points but otherwise no masonry [[superstructure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taverne|first=E. R. M.|title=In ‘t land van belofte, in de nieue stadt: ideaal en werkelijkheid van de stadsuitleg in de Republiek, 1580-1680 (In the land of promise, in the new city: ideal and reality of the city lay-out in the [Dutch] Republic, 1580-1680)|publisher=Schwartz|date=1978|location=Maarssen|isbn=90-6179-024-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction proceeded from west to east, across the breadth of the layout, like a gigantic windshield wiper as the historian [[Geert Mak]] calls it – ''not'' from the center outwards as a popular myth has it. Construction of the north-western sector was started in 1613 and was finished around 1625. After 1664, building in the southern sector was started, although slowly because of an economic depression.{{which|date=October 2018}} The eastern part of the concentric canal plan, covering the area between the [[Amstel]] river and the IJ Bay, was not implemented for a long time. In the following centuries, the land went mostly for park, the [[Hortus Botanicus Amsterdam|Botanical garden]], old age homes, theaters and other public facilities – and for waterways without much plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mak|first=G.|title=Een kleine geschiedenis van Amsterdam|publisher=Uitgeverij Atlas|date=1995|location=Amsterdam/Antwerp|isbn=90-450-1232-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several parts of the city and of the [[urban area]] are [[polder]]s, recognizable by their [[Suffix|postfix]] ''-meer'' meaning 'lake', such as [[Aalsmeer]], [[Bijlmermeer]], [[Haarlemmermeer]], and [[Watergraafsmeer]]. The canals in Amsterdam are now used for tourism, recreation, [[house boat]]s, and a relatively small amount of private transport compared to the main modes of walking, light rail, subway, and bicycle. Most of the canals are paralleled by automobile roads on both sides.

Inward to outward, the canals are as follows:

===Singel===
{{Main|Singel}}
Singel encircled the medieval city of Amsterdam. It served as a [[moat]] around the city from 1480 until 1585, when Amsterdam expanded beyond Singel. The canal runs from the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] Bay, near [[Amsterdam Centraal|Central Station]], to the [[Muntplein (Amsterdam)|Muntplein]] square, where it meets the [[Amstel]] river. It is now the inner-most canal in Amsterdam's semicircular ring of canals. The canal should not be confused with Singelgracht canal, which became the outer limit of the city during the [[Dutch Golden Age]] in the 17th Century.

===Herengracht===
Herengracht (Patricians' Canal or Lords' Canal) is the first of the three major canals in the city centre of Amsterdam. The canal is named after the [[regenten|heren regeerders]] who governed the city in the 16th and 17th century. The most fashionable part is called the [[Golden Bend]], with many double wide mansions, inner gardens and coach houses on Keizersgracht.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monumenten Amsterdam|work=Monumenten en Archeologie Amsterdam|publisher=[[Amsterdam|City of Amsterdam]]|url=http://www.bmz.amsterdam.nl/cgi-bin/database.pl|accessdate=2007-04-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407081115/http://www.bmz.amsterdam.nl/cgi-bin/database.pl|archivedate=2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Sarphati]] (1813-1868) lived at the house at number 598 and [[Peter the Great]] stayed at the house at number 527 during his second visit to Amsterdam.

===Keizersgracht===
Keizersgracht (literal [[English language|English]] translation: Emperor's Canal) is the second and widest of the three major canals in the city centre of Amsterdam, in between Herengracht and Prinsengracht. It is named after [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jlgrealestate.com/English/Amsterdam/Keizersgracht] http://www.jlgrealestate.com/English/Amsterdam/Keizersgracht&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source|date=February 2014}} [[John Adams]] stayed at the house at number 529, [[Heinrich Schliemann]] worked for almost three years at number 71, [[Daniel Fahrenheit]] at 463-465, and during his first visit to Amsterdam (1693), Peter the Great stayed at the house at number 317.

The [[Homomonument]] (Gay Monument) faces the Keizersgracht.

===Prinsengracht===
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
Prinsengracht (Prince's Canal) is the fourth and the longest of the main canals in Amsterdam. It is named after [[William the Silent|the Prince of Orange]]. Most of the canal houses along it were built during the [[Dutch Golden Age]] of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]]. The bridges over the Prinsengracht canal connect with the streets in the [[Jordaan]].

Notable buildings along Prinsengracht include the [[Noorderkerk (Amsterdam)|Noorderkerk]] (Northern Church), the [[Noordermarkt]] (Northern Market),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thatdamguide.com/best-saturday-market/|title=Noordermarkt - Best Saturday Market - That Dam Guide|date=2013-05-30|newspaper=That Dam Guide|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne Frank House]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amsterdam.info/museums/anne_frank_house/|title=Anne Frank House in Amsterdam {{!}} Amsterdam.info|website=www.amsterdam.info|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iamsterdam.com/en/visiting/what-to-do/museums-and-galleries/museums/anne-frank-house|title=Anne Frank House|website=www.iamsterdam.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Westerkerk]] (Western Church, Amsterdam's tallest church).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amsterdam.info/westerkerk/|title=Westerkerk in Amsterdam {{!}} Amsterdam.info|website=www.amsterdam.info|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brantasgracht - panoramio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Brantasgracht]]

===Zwanenburgwal===
{{Main|Zwanenburgwal}}
Zwanenburgwal is a canal and street in the center of [[Amsterdam]]. The painter [[Rembrandt]] and philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] lived here. In 2006 it was voted one of the most beautiful streets in Amsterdam by readers of ''[[Het Parool]]'', a local daily newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parool.nl/dossiers/mooistestraat/100606.html Het Parool: Mooiste Amsterdamse straat] (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

Zwanenburgwal flows from Sint Antoniessluis [[sluice gate]] (between the streets [[Sint Antoniesbreestraat]] and [[Jodenbreestraat]]) to the [[Amstel]] river. The canal was originally named ''Verversgracht'' ("dyers' canal"), after the textile industry that once dominated this part of town. Dyed textiles were hung to dry along the canal.

===Brouwersgracht===
Brouwersgracht is a canal in the city centre of [[Amsterdam]] and is part of the canal belt connecting the Singel, Herengracht, Keizergracht and Prinsengracht and marks the northern border of the canal belt. The canal served as a site for ships returning from [[Asia]] with spices and silks, therefore Brouwersgracht had many warehouses and storage depots for the ships inventories. Likewise some officials of the [[Dutch East India Company]] lived here such as their cartographer (1708-1743) [[Isaak de Graaf]]. [[Brewery|Breweries]] were also prevalent in the area due to the access to fresh water shipments. Today the warehouses are now apartments, some of the most expensive in Amsterdam. Houseboats also are seen in the canal.&lt;ref name="Dunford2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Dunford|title=The Rough Guide to The Netherlands|year=2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-84836-882-8|page=71}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 November 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Brouwersgracht was voted the most beautiful street in Amsterdam by readers of ''[[Het Parool]]'', a national daily newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234338/http://www.parool.nl/dossiers/mooistestraat/051807-straat2.html Het Parool - Mooiste Amsterdams straat] (Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kloveniersburgwal===
{{Main|Kloveniersburgwal}}
Kloveniersburgwal is a canal running south from [[Nieuwmarkt]] to the [[Amstel]] River on the edge of the medieval city. The east side became populated in the 17th century and has a few grand mansions, like the [[Trippenhuis]], now housing the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (KNAW). Kloveniersburgwal was popular with administrators at the [[Dutch East India Company]], being close to its nerve center on Oude Hoogstraat and its warehouse.

===Brantasgracht, Lamonggracht, Majanggracht and Seranggracht===
These four canals are the newest in Amsterdam, constructed on Java Island in 1995, a manmade island in the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ Harbor]], north-east of the City Center. The canals are lined with modern interpretations of classic Amsterdam canal houses, which were designed by 19 young Dutch architects. Each house is 4.5 meters wide and 4 or 5 stories tall, but the designs are totally unique and are often featured in Amsterdam travel guides despite being off the beaten path of most tourists. Nine ornate metal bridges, designed by artist couple Guy Rombouts and Monika Droste, cross the canals for pedestrians and cyclists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.holland.com/global/tourism/information/history-of-the-canals-in-holland.htm |title=Holland.com: History of the canals in Holland|publisher=www.holland.com|accessdate=2017-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charbagh''' or '''Chahar Bagh''' ([[Urdu|Urdu:]] چارباغ, ''chār bāgh,'' [[Persian Language|Persian]]: چهارباغ, ''chahār bāgh'', meaning "four gardens") is a [[Persian gardens|Persian]] and [[Islamic garden|Islamic]] quadrilateral garden layout based on the four gardens of Paradise mentioned in the [[Qur'an]]. The quadrilateral garden is divided by walkways or flowing water into four smaller parts.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, Vincent J. (2007) ''Voices of Islam: Voices of art, beauty, and science''  (volume 4 in the ''Voices of Islam'' series) Praeger, Westport, Connecticut, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RNTAHx95RqQC&amp;pg=PA94 pages 94-95], {{ISBN|978-0-275-98735-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
The quadrilateral Charbagh concept is based on the four gardens of Paradise mentioned in Chapter (Surah) 55, [[Ar-Rahman]] "The Beneficient", in the Qur'an:

"And for him, who fears to stand before his Lord, are two gardens." (Chapter 55: Verse 46)&lt;br&gt;
"And beside them are two other gardens." (Chapter 55: Verse 62)

One of the hallmarks of Charbagh garden is the four-part garden laid out with axial paths that intersect at the garden's centre. This highly structured geometrical scheme, called the chahar bagh, became a powerful method for the organization and domestication of the landscape, itself a symbol of political territory.&lt;ref&gt;[[D. Fairchild Ruggles]], ''Islamic Gardens and Landscapes'', University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous Charbagh gardens==
[[File:View from atop the left minaret 008.jpg|thumb|Layout of the Charbagh at the [[Tomb of Jahangir]] in [[Lahore]]]]
The [[Charbagh, Isfahan|Chahrbagh-e Abbasi]] (or Charbagh Avenue) in [[Isfahan]], [[Iran]], built by [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas the Great]] in 1596, and the garden of the [[Taj Mahal]] in [[India]] are the most famous examples of this style. In the Charbagh at the Taj Mahal, each of the four parts contains sixteen flower beds.

In India, the Char Bagh concept in imperial mausoleums is seen in [[Humayun's Tomb]] in [[Delhi]] in a monumental scale. Humayan's father was the Central Asian Conqueror Babur who succeeded in laying the basis for the Mughal dynasty in the Indian Subcontinent and became the first Mughal emperor. The tradition of [[paradise garden]] originated among the [[Mughals]], originally from Central Asia, which is found at [[Babur]]'s tomb, [[Bagh-e Babur]], in [[Kabul]].&lt;ref name=gar&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wnKiKy9_2u4C&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=Humayun%27s+Tomb&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0 Mughul Tomb Gardens]''The poetics of gardens'', by Charles Willard Moore, William J. Mitchell. Published by MIT Press, 2000. {{ISBN|0-262-63153-9}}. ''Page 17''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
This tradition gave birth to the [[Mughal gardens]] design and displayed its high form in the [[Taj Mahal]] — built by [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]], the great, great, grandson of the Central Asian Conqueror Babur, as a tomb for his favourite Indian wife [[Mumtaz Mahal]], in [[Agra]], India. Here, unlike most such tombs, the [[mausoleum]] is not in the centre of the garden, but on its northern end. The garden features Italian [[Cupressaceae|cypress]] trees (''[[Cupressus sempervirens]]'') that symbolize death. Fruit trees in the garden symbolize life. The garden attracts many birds, which are considered one of the features of the garden.

In [[Pakistan]], the Mughal [[Shalimar Gardens, Lahore|Shalimar Gardens]] and the garden in the [[Tomb of Jehangir]] in [[Lahore]] are based on the Charbagh concept.

==Contemporary==
A charbagh is located on the roof top of the [[Ismaili Centre, London|Ismaili Centre]] in [[South Kensington]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/people/features/place_in_paradise/islamic.shtml A Place in Paradise] - radio coverage from the [[BBC]] about the charbagh garden on top of the Ismaili Centre in South Kensington&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Delegation of the Ismaili Imamat]], located on [[Sussex Drive]] in the Canadian capital [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]] contains a charbagh in a modern setting.{{cn|date=September 2016}} The Ismaili Center and Aga Khan Museum in Toronto features a modern interpretation of a charbagh between the buildings.{{cn|date=September 2016}}

'''Deccan Traps''' are a [[large igneous province]] located on the [[Deccan Plateau]] of west-central [[India]] (17°–24°N, 73°–74°E) and are one of the largest [[volcanic]] features on Earth.

Before an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs, Earth experienced a short burst of intense volcanism." Jennifer Chu | "MIT News Office," 11 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; with a correspondingly larger original volume.

==Etymology==
The term "[[Trap rock|trap]]" has been used in [[geology]] since 1785–1795 for such [[rock formation]]s. It is derived from the Swedish word for stairs ("trappa") and refers to the step-like hills forming the landscape of the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/trap Trap] at dictionary.reference.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Deccan Traps began forming 66.25 [[geologic timescale|million years ago]],&lt;ref name="MIT-Chu2014" /&gt; at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] period. The bulk of the volcanic eruption occurred at the [[Western Ghats]] some 66&amp;nbsp;million years ago. This series of eruptions may have lasted less than 30,000&amp;nbsp;years in total.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/08/050810130729.htm India's Smoking Gun: Dino-killing Eruptions]." ''ScienceDaily,'' 10 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original area covered by the [[lava flow]]s is estimated to have been as large as 1.5&amp;nbsp;million km², approximately half the size of modern [[India]]. The Deccan Traps region was reduced to its current size by [[erosion]] and plate tectonics; the present area of directly observable lava flows is around {{convert|500000|km2|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}.

==Effect on mass extinctions and climate==
The release of [[volcanic gas]]es, particularly [[sulfur dioxide]], during the formation of the traps contributed to [[climate change]]. Data point to an average drop in temperature of 2&amp;nbsp;°C in this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Royer, D. L., Berner, R. A., Montañez, I. P., Tabor, N. J., [[Beerling, D. J.]]|year=2004| title=CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a primary driver of Phanerozoic climate|journal=GSA Today|volume=14|issue=3|pages=4–10|issn=1052-5173|url=http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/14/3/pdf/i1052-5173-14-3-4.pdf|doi=10.1130/1052-5173(2004)014&lt;4:CAAPDO&gt;2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its magnitude, scientists have speculated that the gases released during the formation of the Deccan Traps played a role in the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) extinction event]] (also known as the Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v263/n4/pdf/scientificamerican1090-85.pdf|title = A Volcanic Eruption|last = Courtillot|first = Vincent|date = 1990|journal = Scientific American|doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1090-85|pmid = |access-date = |issue = |volume = 263|format = |pages = 85–92|bibcode = 1990SciAm.263d..85C}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been theorized that sudden cooling due to sulfurous volcanic gases released by the formation of the traps and toxic gas emissions may have contributed significantly to the K–Pg, as well as other mass extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v258/n4/pdf/scientificamerican0488-37b.pdf|title = Star-Struck?|last = Beardsley|first = Tim|date = 1988|journal = Scientific American|doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican0488-37b|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 258|pages = 37–40|bibcode = 1988SciAm.258d..37B}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most popular current consensus among the scientific community is that the extinction was triggered by the [[Chicxulub crater|Chicxulub impact event]] in North America (which would have produced a sunlight-blocking dust cloud that killed much of the plant life and reduced global temperature, called an [[impact winter]]).&lt;ref name="science"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schulte|first=Peter|date=5 March 2010|title=The Chicxulub Asteroid Impact and Mass Extinction at the Cretaceous-Paleogene Boundary|journal=Science|publisher=AAAS|volume=327|issue=5970|pages=1214–1218|issn=1095-9203 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/327/5970/1214|accessdate=5 March 2010|doi=10.1126/science.1177265|pmid=20203042|bibcode=2010Sci...327.1214S|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work published in 2014 by geologist [[Gerta Keller]] and others on the timing of the Deccan volcanism suggests the extinction may have been caused by both the volcanism and the impact event.&lt;ref&gt;Keller, G., ''Deccan volcanism, the Chicxulub impact, and the end-Cretaceous mass extinction: Coincidence? Cause and effect?,'' in ''Volcanism, Impacts, and Mass Extinctions: Causes and Effects,'' GSA Special Paper 505, Pp. 29-55, 2014 [http://specialpapers.gsapubs.org/content/early/2014/06/10/2014.2505_03.1.abstract abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schoene, B., et al., ''U-Pb geochronology of the Deccan Traps and relation to the end-Cretaceous mass extinction,'' Science, 12 Nov. 2014, [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/doi/10.1126/science.aaa0118 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by a similar study in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=State shift in Deccan volcanism at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, possibly induced by impact |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/350/6256/76 |date=2 October 2015 |work=Science |accessdate=2 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Asteroid that killed dinosaurs also intensified volcanic eruptions - study |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/01/asteroid-that-killed-dinosaurs-also-intensified-volcanic-eruptions-study |date=2 October 2015 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petrology==
[[File:World geologic provinces.jpg|thumb|right|The Deccan Traps shown as dark purple spot on the geologic map of India]]
[[File:Epistilbite-Calcite-170550.jpg|thumb|Crystals of [[epistilbite]] and [[calcite]] in a [[vug]] in Deccan Traps basalt lava from Jalgaon District, Maharashtra]] 
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2018}}

Within the Deccan Traps at least 95% of the lavas are [[tholeiitic basalt]]s.  Other rock types present include: [[alkali basalt]], [[nephelinite]], [[lamprophyre]] and [[carbonatite]].

Mantle [[xenolith]]s have been described from [[Kachchh]] (northwestern India) and elsewhere in the western Deccan.

==Fossils==
The Deccan Traps are famous for the beds of fossils that have been found between layers of lava. Particularly well known species include the frog ''Oxyglossus pusillus'' (Owen) of the [[Eocene]] of [[India]] and the toothed frog ''Indobatrachus'', an early lineage of modern frogs, which is now placed in the Australian family Myobatrachidae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Noble | first1 = Gladwyn Kingsley | authorlink = Gladwyn Kingsley Noble | year = | title = The Fossil Frogs of the Intertrappean Beds of Bombay, India | url = http://hdl.handle.net/2246/3061 | journal = American Museum of Natural History | volume = 401 | issue = | page = 1930 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tolweb.org/Myobatrachinae/16946&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Infratrappean Beds|Infratrappean]] and [[Intertrappean Beds]] also contain fossil freshwater mollusks.&lt;ref&gt;Hartman, J.H., Mohabey, D.M., Bingle, M., Scholz, H., Bajpai, S., and Sharma, R., 2006, Initial survivorship of nonmarine molluscan faunas in end-Cretaceous Deccan intertrappean strata, India: Geological Society of America (annual meeting, Philadelphia) Abstracts with Programs, v. 38, no. 7, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories of formation ==
It is postulated that the Deccan Traps eruption was associated with a deep [[mantle plume]]. The area of long-term eruption (the [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]), known as the [[Réunion hotspot]], is suspected of both causing the Deccan Traps eruption and opening the [[rift]] that once separated the [[Mascarene Plateau|Seychelles plateau]] from India. [[Seafloor spreading]] at the boundary between the Indian and [[African Plate]]s subsequently pushed India north over the plume, which now lies under [[Réunion]] island in the [[Indian Ocean]], southwest of India.  The mantle plume model has, however, been challenged.&lt;ref name="mantleplumes"&gt;Sheth, Hetu C. "[http://www.mantleplumes.org/Deccan.html The Deccan Beyond the Plume Hypothesis]." ''MantlePlumes.org,'' 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data continue to emerge which supports the plume model. The motion of the Indian tectonic plate and the eruptive history of the Deccan traps show strong correlations. Based on data from marine magnetic profiles, a pulse of unusually rapid plate motion begins at the same time as the first pulse of Deccan flood basalts, which is dated at 67 million years ago. The spreading rate rapidly increased and reached a maximum at the same time as the peak basaltic eruptions.  The spreading rate then dropped off, with the decrease occurring around 63 million years ago, by which time the main phase of Deccan volcanism ended. This correlation is seen as driven by plume dynamics.&lt;ref name=Cande&gt;S.C. Cande &amp; D.R. Stegman;  Indian and African plate motions driven by the push force of the Réunion plume head; Nature; Volume 475; pp. 47–52; (7 July 2011) {{doi|10.1038/nature10174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian and African plates' motions have also been shown to be coupled, with the common element being the position of these plates relative to the location of the Réunion plume head. The onset of accelerated motion of India coincides with a large slowing of the rate of counterclockwise rotation of Africa. The close correlations between the plate motions suggest that they were both driven by the force of the Réunion plume.&lt;ref name=Cande/&gt;

==Suggested link to impact events==

===Chicxulub crater===
There is some evidence to link the Deccan Traps eruption to the asteroid impact which created the [[Chicxulub crater]] in the Mexican state of Yucatán. Although the Deccan Traps began erupting well before the impact, [[argon-argon dating]] suggests that the impact may have caused an increase in permeability that allowed magma to reach the surface and produced the most voluminous flows, accounting for around 70% of the volume.&lt;ref name=Richards2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richards|first1=Mark A.|last2=Alvarez|first2=Walter|last3=Self|first3=Stephen|last4=Karlstrom|first4=Leif|last5=Renne|first5=Paul R.|last6=Manga|first6=Michael|last7=Sprain|first7=Courtney J.|last8=Smit|first8=Jan|last9=Vanderkluysen|first9=Loÿc|last10=Gibson|first10=Sally A.|authorlink2=Walter Alvarez|authorlink5=Paul Renne|authorlink6=Michael Manga|title=Triggering of the largest Deccan eruptions by the Chicxulub impact|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|volume=127|issue=11–12|pages=1507–1520|doi=10.1130/B31167.1|year=2015|bibcode=2015GSAB..127.1507R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of the asteroid impact and the resulting increase in eruptive volume may have been responsible for the mass extinctions that occurred at the time that separates the Cretaceous and [[Paleogene]] periods, known as the [[K–Pg boundary]].

===Shiva crater===
A geological structure that exists in the sea floor off the west coast of India has been suggested as a possible impact crater, in this context called the [[Shiva crater]].  It has also been dated at approximately 66&amp;nbsp;million years ago, potentially matching the Deccan traps. The researchers claiming that this feature is an impact crater suggest that the impact may have been the triggering event for the Deccan Traps as well as contributing to the acceleration of the Indian plate in the early [[Paleogene]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sankar Chatterjee|Chatterjee, Sankar]]. "[http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2003AM/finalprogram/abstract_58126.htm The Shiva Crater: Implications for Deccan Volcanism, India-Seychelles Rifting, Dinosaur Extinction, and Petroleum Entrapment at the KT Boundary]." Paper No. 60-8, Seattle Annual Meeting, November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the current consensus in the Earth science community is that this feature is unlikely to be an actual impact crater.&lt;ref name="Leslie2008a"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mullen, Leslie|date=2 November 2004|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/deepimpact-04r.html|title=Shiva: Another K-Pg Impact?|work=Spacedaily.com|accessdate=20 February 2008}} - original article at [http://www.astrobio.net/news/article1281.html source]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/091018-dinosaur-crater.html |title=New Dino-destroying Theory Fuels Hot Debate |first=Clara |last=Moskowitz |publisher=space.com |date=18 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23546">'''Diane Swanson''' (born 5 April 1944) is a Canadian writer of science books for children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lccn.loc.gov/n89623125 "Swanson, Diane, 1944–"]. Library of Congress Authorities. Retrieved 2015-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kidscanqa/&gt;

==Biography==
Swanson was born and raised in [[Lethbridge]], [[Alberta]].&lt;ref name="kidscan"/&gt; As a child, she and her terrier Sammy would spend summers looking for ladybugs and spiders outside.&lt;ref name="readclub"/&gt;

She graduated from the [[University of Alberta]] with an Honors Bachelor of Arts in the social sciences.&lt;ref name="kidscanqa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kidscan"/&gt; 
She taught in the [[West Indies]] for two years.&lt;ref name="kidscan"/&gt;  She researched [[water resources]] for the Canadian government while living in [[Ottawa]].&lt;ref name="kidscan"/&gt;

Swanson's first book was published when she was 18.&lt;ref name="kidscanqa"/&gt; She has written over 70 books and 450 magazine articles.&lt;ref name="kidscan"/&gt;

Swanson lives in [[Victoria, British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="kidscan"/&gt; Her hobbies are hiking, piano-playing, and reading.&lt;ref name="kidscanqa"/&gt;  She is married and has two children.&lt;ref name="annick"/&gt;

==Reception==

The Toronto ''Globe and Mail'' described Swanson's ''A Crash of Rhinos, A Party of Jays'' as providing "a cheerfully educational vantage point from which to view the natural world and its denizens".&lt;ref name="gm-crash"/&gt;  ''Booklist'' called it "part science and part English lesson", deeming it "great for individual or classroom consumption".&lt;ref name="booklist-crash"/&gt;

The ''Globe and Mail'' called ''The Wonder in Water'' a "well-laid-out and attractively illustrated book".&lt;ref name="gm-water"/&gt;

Nzong Xiong, writing for ''The Fresno Bee'', described ''The Dentist &amp; You'' as an "easy-to-read" book designed to help make dentist visits for children ages 4 to 7 "easier and less fearful".&lt;ref name="bee-dentist"/&gt; ''Resource Links'' found it to be useful for "parents wanting to prepare their children for their first visit to the dentist" or teachers, but found the book "a bit too long and detailed" for the target audience.&lt;ref name="rl-dentist"/&gt; ''School Library Journal'', however, tagged it as "excellent in relation to other titles on the same subject".&lt;ref name="slj-dentist"/&gt;

''Buffalo Sunrise'' was called "a full-bodied photo essay" and an "exemplary book" that "ably" recounts the history of the [[American Bison|American buffalo]] by the ''San Francisco Chronicle''.&lt;ref name="chron-west"/&gt;  ''Booklist'' called it "a useful resource for middle-graders".&lt;ref name="booklist-buffalo"/&gt;

Reviewing ''Alligators and Crocodiles'', ''Frogs and Toads'' and ''Penguins'' from the ''Welcome to the World of Animals'' series for the ''School Library Journal'', Arwen Marshall of the Minneapolis Public Library criticized the narrow scope of the books, saying "These serviceable overviews might be useful for brief reports, but they don't cover any new ground."&lt;ref name="slj-arwen"/&gt; ''Resource Links'' found the series to provide "enough information to satisfy [students'] curiosity while also meeting their research needs",&lt;ref name="rl-series"/&gt; recommending the books "for any elementary school library".&lt;ref name="rl-series-2"/&gt;

The '''Expiring Provisions Improvement Reform and Efficiency (EXPIRE) Act''' legislation was a bill, introduced by Sen. [[Ron Wyden]] (D-OR) in the U.S. Senate during the 113th Congress, that would have extended 26 tax breaks due to expire at the end of that year, and more than 50 expired tax breaks, including the Health Coverage Tax Credit, deduction for expenses of elementary and secondary school teachers, mortgage debt forgiveness, mass transit parity, mortgage interest premium deduction, renewable energy protection tax credit and $4,000 tax deduction for tuition costs and more through December 31, 2015. The bill would have also changed the definition of transit to include bike-sharing, thereby making bike sharing membership fees eligible for the federal bicycle commuter benefit.

Organizations such as the [[American Wind Energy Association]] actively lobbied for the passage of this bill because it would benefit [[wind power in the United States]]. The bipartisan [[US Senate Finance Committee]] passed the legislation on April 3, 2014 but on May 16, the bill failed to pass due to a Republican filibuster. Republicans wanted to strike the approximately $13 billion tax break for wind power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/05/16/3438589/senate-kills-tax-extenders/|title=Senate Blocks $85 Billion Tax Cut Bill Because It Would Have Helped Wind Energy|website=Thinkprogress.org|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All Democrats except Reid (D-NV), Manchin (D-WV), and Rockefeller (D-WV) voted yea. All Republicans voted nay or no vote except Kirk (R-IL). Reid only voted no so that the bill could be reintroduced later.

The vote for H.R. 3474 cloture (carrying the EXPIRE Act) was as follows (53 yea, 40 nay, 7 no vote):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&amp;session=2&amp;vote=00157|title=U.S. Senate: U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes 113th  Congress - 2nd  Session|website=Senate.gov|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill never passed.

==History==
Iran is in a constant battle to use its energy resources more effectively in the face of [[Iranian targeted subsidy plan|subsidization]] and the need for technological advances in energy exploration and production. Energy wastage in Iran amounts to six or seven billion dollars (2008). The energy consumption in the country is extraordinarily higher than international standards. Iran recycles 28 percent of its used oil and gas whereas the figure for certain countries stands at 60 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/08/oct/1303.html |title=Energy Wastage In Iran Equals 6-7 Billion Dallars Per Year |publisher=Payvand.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran paid $84 billion in subsidies for oil, gas and electricity in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3111/html/economy.htm |accessdate=June 18, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612142508/http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3111/html/economy.htm |archivedate=June 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran is one of the most energy-intensive countries of the world, with [[List of countries by energy consumption per capita|per capita energy consumption]] 15 times that of [[Japan]] and 10 times that of [[European Union]]. Also due to [[Iranian Economic Reform Plan#Subsidy reform plan|huge energy subsidies]], Iran is one of the most energy inefficient countries of the world, with the [[energy intensity]] three times higher than global average and 2.5 times the middle eastern average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taghizadeh |first=Reza |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Sanctions_And_Irans_Achilles_Heel/2066744.html |title=Sanctions And Iran's Achilles Heel |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2010-06-10 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half of the country’s energy is wasted in domestic sector, 3.4 of which is wasted through [[single-occupancy vehicle]] use and 2/3 parts of [[List of power stations in Iran|power plants]]' energy are also wasted.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.mehrnews.com/detail/News/102219&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran is one of the leading members of [[OPEC]] (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) and the [[GECF|Organization of Gas Exporting Countries]] (GECF). Iran received $47 billion in oil export revenues, which accounts for about 50% of state revenues.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, “Iran Energy:  Overview”, http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4688984.stm, April 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural gas and oil consumption both account for about half of Iran’s [[domestic energy consumption]].  With its heavy dependence on oil and gas revenues Iran continues to explore for new sources of natural gas and oil.  Recently Iran has focused its energy sector on the exploration of the [[South Pars]] offshore natural gas fields in the [[Persian Gulf]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;EIA, “Iran’s Energy Data”, {{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Iran/Background.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402152533/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Iran/Background.html |archivedate=2009-04-02 |df= }}, April 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran has become self-sufficient in designing, building and operating dams and power plants and it has won a good number of international bids in competition with foreign firms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3266/html/economy.htm ]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/mar/1073.html |title=Iran to build power plants in Ecuador |publisher=Payvand.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy generation capacity of Iranian thermal power plants reached 173 terawatt hours in 2007. Accounting for 17.9 percent of energy production in the Middle East and African region. Natural gas has been the main energy in Iran in 2007, comprising over 55 percent of energy needs, while oil and hydroelectricity accounted for 42 and 2 percent respectively. The region’s energy need will increase by 26.8 percent until 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3280/html/economy.htm |accessdate=November 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204232447/http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3280/html/economy.htm |archivedate=December 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Energy plays an important role in [[Politics of Iran|Iranian politics]]. [[Robert Baer]] in his book ''The Devil We Know: Dealing with the New Iranian Superpower'' argues that Iran has attained the status of an [[energy superpower]] and is on its way to become a military-political superpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Baer|title=The Devil We Know: Dealing with the New Iranian Superpower|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztdT0tncFnUC|year=2008|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=978-0-307-40864-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran has the second largest oil reserves in the world, and the third largest exporter of it. According to 2006 estimates Iran produced about five percent of total global crude oil production. They produced {{convert|4.2|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} of total liquids and 3.8&amp;nbsp;million of those barrels were crude oil. Iran plans to invest $100 billion during the next four years in different sections of its oil industry (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=99089&amp;sectionid=351020103 PressTV:Iran invests $100b in oil industry in 4 years] Retrieved July 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2009, Iranian oil [[Reserves-to-production ratio|R/P ratio]] was 89.4 years which is the world's highest.&lt;ref name="bp.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2010_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2010.pdf |title=BP Statistical Review of World Energy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825171459/http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2010_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2010.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2009, Iran had 52 active [[Oil platform|rigs]] and 1,853 producing [[oil well]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opec.org/opec_web/static_files_project/media/downloads/publications/ASB2009.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran possesses abundant [[fuels]] from which to generate energy. Since 1913 [[Iran]] has been a major oil-exporting country. Oil industry output averaged {{convert|4|Moilbbl|m3}} per day in 2005, compared with the peak output of {{convert|6|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}} reached in 1974. Following the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution|revolution]], however, the government reduced daily oil production in accordance with an oil conservation policy. Further production declines occurred as result of damage to oil facilities during the [[Iran–Iraq War|war with Iraq]]. In the early 2000s, industry infrastructure was increasingly inefficient because of technological lags. Few exploratory wells were drilled in 2005. Iranian oil was [[nationalization of the Iranian oil industry|nationalized in 1953]] and thus is owned and operated by the [[National Iranian Oil Company]] (NIOC).

Iran held 10.3% of the world's total proven [[oil reserves]] and that figures out to be about {{convert|137.6|Goilbbl|m3}} of oil reserves at the end of 2009.&lt;ref name="bp.com"/&gt; Oil also is found in northern Iran and in the offshore waters of the [[Persian Gulf]]. Nevertheless, in 2005 Iran spent US$4 billion on [[gasoline]] imports, mainly because of [[contraband]] and inefficient domestic use that result from [[Ministry of Petroleum of Iran#Gasoline subsidies|subsidies]]. Iran is one of the largest [[gasoline]] consumers in the world ranking second behind [[United States]] in consumption per car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iran-e-sabz.org/news/iranenv.html |title=Green Party of Iran - News |publisher=Iran-e-sabz.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a growing recognition that prices must rise faster to curb consumption and ease the burden on the public finances. Cheap energy has encouraged wasteful consumption in Iran, and a brisk business in smuggling petrol into [[Iraq]], [[Turkey]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Demand has also been supported by rapid increases in car production in recent years. In the absence of imports, [[Iranian automobile industry|the car industry]] has developed strongly (albeit from a low base) with output reaching over 1m vehicles in fiscal year 2006/07 (March 21 – March 20).&lt;ref name='Iran'/&gt;

[[File:Oil Balance Iran.svg|thumb|right|Iran oil production, domestic consumption and exports]]
The growth in consumption of domestically produced oil has been modest, owing to [[National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company|refining constraints]]. By contrast, fuel imports rose to {{convert|180000|oilbbl/d}} in January 2005 from {{convert|30000|oilbbl/d}} in 2000, and petrol consumption is estimated to have been around {{convert|1800000|oilbbl/d}} in 2007 (before [[rationing]]), of which about one-third is imported. These imports are proving expensive, costing the government about US$4bn in the first nine months of 2007/08, according to parliamentary sources.&lt;ref name='Iran'/&gt; Nearly 40% of refined oil consumed by Iran is imported from [[India]].&lt;ref name=LaFranchi&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0718/p25s05-usfp.html Does US road to better relations with Iran pass through India?], ''The Christian Science Monitor'', July 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:USGS world oil endowment.png|thumb|right| A [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] map of countries where [[oil]] is located.]]
Iran contains 27&amp;nbsp;onshore and 13&amp;nbsp;offshore oil-producing fields, largely concentrated in the southwestern [[Khuzestan]] region near the [[Iraq]]i border.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  The Iranian government is heavily reliant on oil revenues and they have heavily subsidized the energy industries, which figures out to be about 12% of Iran’s [[GDP]]. However, domestic oil consumption has decreased due to the alternative use of natural gas. Economic growth from these resources is uncertain and stunted in Iran due to these subsidies and population growth. Iran has been unable to reach it full production levels due to a combination of [[Economic sanctions|sanctions]] and war plaguing the region. Iran’s oil fields have a natural decline rate at 8 percent for onshore wells and 10% for offshore fields. The Iranian recovery rate is currently approximately 27 percent, which is well below the world average. Iran needs structural improvements made to coincide with their [[enhanced oil recovery]] efforts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Natural gas==
{{Main|Natural gas reserves in Iran}}
{{See also|National Iranian Gas Company|South Pars Gas Field}}
[[File:Gas Balance Iran.svg|thumb|right|Iran's gas production, domestic consumption and exports]]
Iran is the world's third producer of [[natural gas]] (5.1% of the world's total and 184 BCM); which is primarily used for domestic electricity generation or heat production.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/KeyWorld2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It contains an estimated  {{convert|1187.3|e12cuft|km3}} (Tcf) in proven natural gas reserves.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 2005 a large share of Iran’s natural [[gas]] reserves were believed to remain untapped. About 62% of these reserves are located in non-associated fields. Iranian production of natural gas is expected to increase over the next few years due to continuing discoveries in the [[North Pars]] and [[South Pars]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Iranian Gas Company]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic consumption has matched production at {{convert|3.6|e12cuft|km3|abbr=on}} in the year of 2005. Domestic consumption is expected to go up at about 7% per year for the following decade. The Iranian government has also subsidized natural gas prices along with [[gasoline]] prices, and this is expected to sustain this high level of domestic consumption. In lieu of this increasing domestic demand, natural gas exports are expected to decrease in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;EIA, [http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Iran/Background.html Iran’s Energy Data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402152533/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Iran/Background.html |date=2009-04-02 }}, April 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran has the third largest consumption of [[natural gas]] in the world after [[United States]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2181rank.html?countryName=Iran&amp;countryCode=ir&amp;regionCode=me&amp;rank=4#ir |title=CIA - The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran also has the world's largest growth rate in natural gas consumption.&lt;ref name="bp.com"/&gt;

Iran’s domestic consumption and production have steadily grown together since 1984 and it is still heavily reliant on traditional [[Thermal power station|thermal]] energy sources of electricity, with a small fraction being produced by [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3103/html/economy.htm#s295833 retrieved April 2, 2008.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012074726/http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3103/html/economy.htm#s295833 |date=October 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumption has steadily risen and it is expected to rise at about 6 percent per year for the following decade.

The exploration efforts for sources of power generation are wide and diverse in Iran. Plans are being made to make oil efficient power plants as well as an emphasis on natural gas production in order to meet their growing electricity demand. [[Nuclear power]] and hydroelectric power are not focused on for the time being, but they are part of an overall strategy to meet electricity demands. The electricity sector is also heavily subsidized and mostly state owned companies control power distribution, transmission and generation. In order to meet the demands of the electricity sector, however, Iran is beginning to look into private investment.&lt;ref&gt;EIA, “Iran’s Energy Data”, {{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Iran/Background.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402152533/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Iran/Background.html |archivedate=2009-04-02 |df= }}, Retrieved April 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foreign Direct Investment in Iran#FIPPA|A by-law]] has been passed allowing the energy ministry to conclude rial or combined rial/foreign-currency contracts for the purchase of electricity from private companies.&lt;ref name='Iran'/&gt; Private companies in Iran generated 14,440 megawatts of electricity in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=115682&amp;sectionid=351020103 |title=No Operation |publisher=Presstv.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527130330/http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=115682&amp;sectionid=351020103 |archive-date=2012-05-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some criticize Iran's hydroelectric power plans as potentially dangerous to the environment, most agree that the country's current state of hydroelectric production is much better off than in the past. Iran has displayed a new approach to this sector.  After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the construction of hydroelectric power plants became both a popular private and public venture. Often, construction projects did not meet basic environmental standards, engineering standards, and technical requirements. As a result, many of these dams were destroyed or left in dilapidated conditions.&lt;ref&gt;International Journal of Water Resources Development; Mar2002, Vol. 18 Issue 1, p179-182, 4p&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Karun3-dam.jpg|thumb|The [[Karun-3 dam]] &amp; [[hydroelectric power plant]] in Iran was commissioned in 2005. Iran has emerged as one of the world's largest [[dam]] builders in recent years.&lt;ref name='Elec'&gt;[http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2771/html/economy.htm Iran Daily - Domestic Economy - 02/01/07] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930183642/http://www.iran-daily.com/1385/2771/html/economy.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
By 2004, the addition of new hydroelectric stations and the streamlining of conventional [[coal]]- and [[oil]]-fired stations increased installed capacity to 33,000 megawatts (MW). Of that amount, about 75 percent was based on [[natural gas]], 18 percent on [[oil]], and 7 percent on [[hydroelectric power]]. However, in 2004 Iran opened its first [[wind]]-powered and [[Geothermal power|geothermal]] plants, and the first solar thermal plant was to come online in 2009. Iran has recoverable coal reserves of nearly 1.9bn short tonnes. The country produces about 1.3m short tonnes of coal annually and consumes about 1.5m short tonnes, making it a small net importer of coal.&lt;ref name='Iran'/&gt;

[[Demographics of Iran|Demographic trends]] and intensified industrialization have caused electric power demand to grow by 8 percent per year. The government’s goal of 53,000 megawatts of installed capacity by 2010 is to be reached by bringing on line new gas-fired plants financed by independent power producers, including those with [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] backing, and by adding hydroelectric and nuclear power generating capacity. It has also been estimated that Iran has the potential to produce at least 6,150 MWh of electricity by [[Wave power]] from its coastline on [[Persian Gulf]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilica.com/EnPaper-NSMI07-NSMI07_068.html |title=Study on feasibility of establishing a wave power-plant in Persian Gulf |publisher=Civilica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iran is also experimenting with electricity generation from organic wastes and plans to build power plants using sewage and organic waste of domestic and industrial origin as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Suna |url=http://www.suna.org.ir/projectdetail-fa-28.html |title=مطالعه امکان سنجی و طراحی مفهومی نیروگاه بیوگاز ساوه سازمان انرژی های نو ایران |publisher=Suna.org.ir |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another area in which there is ongoing research is assessment of Iran's [[tidal power]] potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unjobs.org/tags/tidal-power |title=Tidal Power |publisher=Unjobs.org |date=2003-11-13 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilica.com/Paper-NSMI08-NSMI08_072.html |title=Study and calculation of extractable tidal power in south coastal zones of Iran |publisher=Civilica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; With about 300 clear sunny days a year and an average of 2,200 kilowatt-hour [[solar radiation]] per square meter, Iran has a great potential to tap [[solar energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20101220044922 |title=Solar Power Plants To Replace Fossil Fuel |publisher=Zawya |date=2010-12-20 |accessdate=2012-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable energy==
{{See also|Iranian targeted subsidy plan}}
[[Image:Manjeel windmills.jpg|thumb|right|As a further drive toward diversification of energy sources, Iran has established wind farms in several areas, this one near [[Manjeel]].]]

In 2010, the [[Iranian government]] announced plans to build 2,000MW of renewable energy capacity between 2010-2015. As of 2010, Iran had 8,500MW of hydroelectric capacity and 130MW of wind energy capacity. As at 2010, private companies had signed contracts to build more than 600MW of [[biomass]] systems and 500MW of new [[wind energy]] projects.&lt;ref name=CS&gt;http://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/Energy-Voices/2012/0910/Invest-in-Iran-s-renewable-energy-Not-so-crazy&lt;/ref&gt; 

Iran is also working to make [[renewable energy]] commercially viable and the [[Ministry of Energy (Iran)|Ministry of Energy]] is required to buy privately produced renewable energy at world market prices. A feed-in-tariff ([[FiT]]) for wind and biomass energy around 13 cents/kWh is helpful.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

In 2012, Iran allocated €500 million from the [[National Development Fund]] for renewable energy projects. Also supporting the solar industry is the state-sponsored [[Renewable Energy Organization of Iran]] (SUNA), which is attached to the Energy Ministry and enjoys a budget of around $60 million.&lt;ref name=CS/&gt;

===Hydro===
{{See also|List of dams and reservoirs in Iran}}
[[Hydropower]] makes up 10,000 megawatts or 14% of Iran’s overall energy mix (2015).&lt;ref name="presstv.com"&gt;http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2015/07/23/421482/iran-electricity-turbine-power-&lt;/ref&gt; Iran is able to build its [[Francis turbine|water turbine]]s domestically.&lt;ref name="presstv.com"/&gt;

===Biofuel===
In 2016, the [[Iranian Biofuel Society (IBS)]] in collaboration with the Vice Presidency for Science of Technology and Tehran and the Suburbs Bus Company executed the first urban pilot project for the consumption of waste cooking oil biodiesel in Tehran`s bus fleet in an attempt to generate public awareness regarding ''Global Climate Change'', wherein they recommend “reducing net [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[CO2]] emissions to the atmosphere” and “minimizing anthropogenic disturbances of” atmospheric gasses by partial replacement of fossil fuels with waste-oriented biofuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= تفاهم نامه استفاده از سوخت های زیستی در اتوبوسرانی تهران امضا شد| url= http://www.irna.ir/fa/News/81895032/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was also supported by Small Grant Programme, [[Global Environmental Facility]], United Nation Development Program (SGP/GEF/UNDP) Office in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= UNDP-GEF Small Grant Programme| url= http://www.sgp.undp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar===
{{main|Solar power in Iran|List of solar thermal power stations}}
Iran's unique geographical position means 90% of the country has enough sun to generate [[solar power]] 300 days a year. According to [[PressTV]] Iran has 520 watts per hour per square meter of solar radiation every day.&lt;ref name=PTV/&gt; Other sources give an average of 2,200 kilowatt-hour [[solar radiation]] per square meter.&lt;ref name="zawya.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20101220044922 |title=Solar Power Plants To Replace Fossil Fuel |publisher=Zawya |date=2010-12-20 |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy generated by solar power reached 53 MW in 2005 and 67 MW in 2011.&lt;ref name=PTV&gt;http://presstv.com/Program/251519.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind===
{{main|Wind power in Iran}}
Iran has the potential to generate 20 to 30 GW of [[wind energy]]. That is half of the total energy consumption needs of the country. As at 2012 Iran had 163 [[wind turbine]]s with an installed capacity of 92470 kWh.&lt;ref name=PTV/&gt; [[Sadid Industrial Group]] is a well known domestic manufacturer in this field. India's [[Sulzon Energy]] and Germany's [[Siemens]] are also potential providers of [[wind turbine]]s to Iran.&lt;ref name="presstv.com"/&gt;

===Geothermal===
Iran has the potential to become the 9th largest [[geothermal energy]] producer.&lt;ref name=PTV/&gt;
According to global tectonics Iran is impacted by subduction of the Arabian Plate under the Central Iranian Plate and four thrust faults: two that make the Southern Caspian Sea Depression and two in the north of Iran, part of the Caucasian Range. Mt. Sabalan and Mt. Sahand are two Quaternary Volcanos in the area. Sabalan is a large stratovolcano consisting of 3 summits named Soltan (4811), Heram (4612m) and Kasra (4573m). The stratovolcano is situated on a possible horst trending northeast-southwest and erupted at latest in the Holocene. Caldera collapsing has caused a depression about 400 m in height and 12 km in diameter. The lava flows consists of trachyandesite, andesite and dacite and pyroclastic deposits. There are 9 hot springs with a temperature in the range of 25-85°C.

[[Image:Giebichenstein.jpg|right|thumbnail|250px|The "Giebichenstein" in [[Stöckse]], Germany]]

The '''Giebichenstein''' in [[Stöckse]], Germany, is one of the largest [[Glacial erratic|erratic boulders]] of northern Germany. A picture of the Giebichenstein is part of the emblem of the Stöckse municipality.

There is the supposition that during [[Wolstonian Stage]] the stone was deposited by glaciers as a part of a [[moraine]]. Near the Giebichenstein there are the remains of a [[dolmen]], and at the stone itself there were found the remains of a [[stone age]] hunter's camp.

She has worked as the lead author on the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] chapter on ''North America'' in the report ''Climate Change 2001: Impacts, Adaptations and Vulnerability.''

She is based at the United States [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] in [[Colorado]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Miller undertook her doctorate in Economics at the [[University of Washington]] in 1985. Her dissertation was entitled ''The Right to Use vs. the Right to Sell: Water Rights in the Western United States''.  It explored the evolution of property institutions governing access to water in the arid western states and modelled the operation and effects of these institutions in the presence of both scarcity and inter-temporal variability in water supplies.

In [[planetary science]], the '''Kombayashi–Ingersoll limit''' represents the maximum solar flux a planet can handle without a [[runaway greenhouse effect]] setting in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kombayashi, M. |date=1967 |title=Discrete equilibrium temperatures of a hypothetical planet with the atmosphere and the hydrosphere of one component-two phase system under constant solar radiation |journal=J. Meteor. Soc. Japan |volume=45 |pages=137–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ingersoll, A. P. |date=1969 |title=The runaway greenhouse: A history of water on Venus |journal=J. Atmos.

Principles of Planetary Climate. Cambridge University Press. 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

For planets with temperature-dependent sources of [[greenhouse gases]] such as liquid water and [[Optical depth|optically thin]] atmospheres the [[outgoing longwave radiation]] curve (which indicates how fast energy can be radiated away by the planet) flattens at high temperatures, reaching a horizontal [[asymptote]] – the Kombayashi–Ingersoll limit itself. Since the equilibrium temperature is the intersection of this curve and a horizontal line representing solar flux, for fluxes above this point the planet heats up indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=262|title=Does positive feedback necessarily mean runaway warming?|accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kasting estimated the limit for Earth to be 320 watts per square meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kasting, J. F. |title=Runaway and moist greenhouse atmospheres and the evolution of Earth and Venus |journal=Icarus |volume=74 |pages=472–494 |date=1988 |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(88)90116-9 |pmid=11538226 |issue=3|bibcode=1988Icar...74..472K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The limit is relevant for estimating the inner edge of the [[circumstellar habitable zone]]. However, the limit also depends on the surface gravity of the planet, making heavy worlds somewhat more resistant to the runaway effect.&lt;ref name="Pierre" /&gt;

The '''Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC)''' is the national [[energy]] agency for Lebanon. LCEC is a governmental organization affiliated to the Lebanese Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW). LCEC is the technical arm of the Ministry in all subjects related to [[energy conservation|energy efficiency]], [[renewable energy]], and [[green buildings]].&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;MED-DESIRE. (2015). LCEC. Retrieved from: http://www.med-desire.eu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=129&amp;Itemid=687&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

LCEC has succeeded in establishing itself as the main national reference on sustainable energy in [[Lebanon]]. It is the leading provider of energy efficiency and renewable energy programs to the public and private sectors in Lebanon. LCEC offers expertise and support to the Government of Lebanon (GoL) to develop and implement national strategies towards saving energy, saving money, reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions with the final target being to improve durability, safety and comfort of the Lebanese population.&lt;ref name="intro1"&gt;Pierre El Khoury. (2013). Insights on the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Development in Lebanon. Retrieved from: http://www.institutdesfinances.gov.lb/english/pdf/Pierre%20Khoury-CHEDE%20MED%20Presentation-%20050613.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

LCEC is a financially and administratively independent organization and operates under the direct supervision of the Minister of Energy and Water. LCEC has been an independent national organization ever since 2011. Actually, LCEC is registered at [[Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (Lebanon)|the Lebanese Ministry of Interior and Municipalities]] in January 2011. However, the actual work of LCEC started back in 2005 when it was initiated as a joint project between the Ministry of Energy and Water and [[United Nations Development Programme|the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)]] Lebanon.&lt;ref name="intro3"&gt;Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation Project. (2013). About Us. Retrieved from: http://www.lcecp.org.lb/aboutus.php?i=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

LCEC is the technical arm of the government of Lebanon working towards institutionalizing all national efforts to:
* Improve and raise awareness energy efficiency in the main sectors of the economy.
* Encourage the use of renewable energy technologies through technical and policy support.
* Provide reliable data on energy demand patterns and distribution.
* Produce measurable and sustainable global benefits in terms of long-term [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions]] reductions.&lt;ref name="intro3"/&gt;

It tries to reduce greenhouse gases emissions by:
* Providing business and the public sector with expert advice, finance and accreditation.
* Stimulating demand for energy efficiency and renewable energy products through developing national awareness campaigns.
* Developing energy efficiency standards and labels.
* The creation and support of [[Energy service company|Energy Services Companies (ESCOs)]].
* Establishing partnerships with public and private sectors.
* Representing Lebanon in international energy efficiency and renewable energy associations.
* Providing a national energy database.
* Promoting the [[Clean Development Mechanism|Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)]] for [[carbon offsets]].&lt;ref name="intro3"/&gt;

==History==
Back in 2002, the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in signed an agreement to create a new project called “Cross-sectoral energy efficiency and removal of barriers to ESCO operation”. The project was co-funded by [[The Global Environment Facility|the Global Environment Facility (GEF)]] and the Ministry of Energy and Water and under the direct management of UNDP Lebanon.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;

One main objective of this project was to create a national energy agency for Lebanon to be called the Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC). The project team started its operation in early 2005, and gradually the project name changed to LCEC. The LCEC project succeeded in implementing a number of activities to push for energy efficiency development in Lebanon. Gradually, LCEC gradually established itself as an independent technical national center offering the Lebanese Government and more specifically the Ministry of Energy and Water all kinds of services dedicated to energy efficiency and renewable energy.&lt;ref name="intro1"/&gt;

The role of the LCEC project was consolidated as an independent technical national center in the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that signed between MEW and UNDP on 18 June 2007. GEF and UNDP extended their support to the LCEC in 2009 until the end of 2013.

In 2011, LCEC finally achieved to stand out as an independent organization affiliated to the Ministry of Energy and Water and is now financially and administratively independent. LCEC operates under the direct supervision of the Lebanese Minister of Energy and Water.

In 2013, the financial and administrative support of GEF and UNDP to LCEC came to an end. During that same year, LCEC received its first financial support from the Lebanese Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW). The MEW support ensured the sustainability of the center for a minimum of 5 years. LCEC also benefits from the support of the European Union (EU) through a contract signed with the Central Bank of Lebanon (BDL).&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;

== What Does LCEC Do? ==
LCEC has established itself as a technical point of reference specialized in [[energy conservation]] issues within the Lebanese Ministry of Energy and Water. LCEC targets fundamental energy issues.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;

LCEC works on setting national strategies and action plans to be adopted by the Lebanese Government. LCEC also works on the implementation and the quality control of national projects and initiatives in the country. Moreover, LCEC is involved in the update and development of the legal and administrative framework needed for the greening of the energy sector. Until date, LCEC has implemented numerous energy efficiency and renewable energy projects and initiatives that have resulted in many positive changes within the Lebanese society and economy.&lt;ref name="intro3"/&gt;

The main driver of the LCEC is the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) that summarizes the national efforts in energy efficiency and renewable energy. At [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Summit]], Lebanon voluntarily pledged to increase the renewable energy share to 12% by 2020. This voluntary commitment was anchored within the “Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector” prepared by the Ministry of Energy and Water and officially adopted by the Council of Ministers in June 2010. The policy paper includes ten strategic initiatives for the improvement of infrastructure, supply and demand systems and the definition of legal framework. Two key initiatives target respectively the renewable energy and the demand side management/ energy efficiency.

Following this, LCEC developed the NEEAP Lebanon 2011-2015 which was adopted in August 2010 by the Ministry of Energy and Water and approved in November 2011 by the Lebanese Government. NEEAP summarizes all national objectives, programmes and policies in 14 independent but correlated initiatives in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors. NEEAP was prepared in conformance with the Arab EE guideline (based on the EU directive 2006/32/EC on energy end-use efficiency and energy service) and Lebanon was the first Arab country to officially adopt such plan. LCEC is currently updating the NEEAP while preparing the Renewable Energy Strategy for Lebanon that will include several scenarios in achieving the set target of 12% RE by 2020 and that will also be in accordance with the Arab renewable energy guideline under preparation.&lt;ref&gt;MED-ENEC. (2015). Lebanese Council of Ministers Approves Lebanon’s National Energy Efficiency Action Plan. Retrieved from: http://www.med-enec.com/news/lebanese-council-ministers-approves-lebanon%E2%80%99s-national-energy-efficiency-action-plan-neeap&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, LCEC provides both the public and private sector with expert advice, finance and accreditation, develops energy efficiency standards and labels, and provides national energy database indicators.&lt;ref name="intro3"/&gt;

==Partnerships==
The work of LCEC is characterized by various partnerships with national and international private and public entities.

the Ministry of Energy and Water is the central public organization in charge of the energy sector in Lebanon. LCEC is affiliated to the Ministry of Energy and Water in all major decisions, initiatives and projects related to energy efficiency and renewable energy.

LCEC is also the technical partner of the [[Banque du Liban|Central Bank of Lebanon]] (BDL) in the review and evaluation of all technical applications to low-interest energy loans submitted to BDL.

==Policy Development==
At the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Summit, Lebanon voluntarily pledged to increase the renewable energy shares to 12% by 2020. This voluntary commitment was anchored within the “Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector” prepared by the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) and officially adopted by the Council of Ministers in June 2010: it includes ten strategic initiatives for the improvement of infrastructure, supply and demand systems and the definition of legal framework. Two key initiatives target respectively the Renewable Energy and the Demand Side Management / Energy Efficiency.

===National Energy Efficiency Action Plan===
Following the “Policy Paper for the Electricity Sector” prepared by the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) and officially adopted by the Council of Ministers in June 2010, LCEC developed the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan 2011-2015 for Lebanon (NEEAP) to achieve the national target of 12% renewable energy share by 2020. NEEAP summarizes all national objectives, programmes and policies in 14 initiatives in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sectors.
The initiatives of the NEEAP are the following:
* Initiative 1: Towards Banning the Import of [[Incandescent lamp|Incandescent Lamps]] to Lebanon
* Initiative 2: Adoption of the Energy Conservation Law and Institutionalization of the Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC) as the National Agency for Lebanon
* Initiative 3: Promotion of Decentralization Power Generation by [[Photovoltaics|PV]] and Wind Applications in the Residential and Commercial Sectors 
* Initiative 4: [[Solar water heater|Solar Water Heaters]] for Buildings and Institutions 
* Initiative 5: Design and implementation of a national strategy for efficient and economic public street Lighting in Lebanon 
* Initiative 6: Electricity Generation from [[Wind Power]] 
* Initiative 7: Electricity Generation from [[Solar Energy]] 
* Initiative 8: [[Hydropower|Hydro Power]] for Electricity Generation 
* Initiative 9: [[Geothermal energy in Lebanon]], [[Waste-to-energy|Waste to Energy]], and Other Technologies 
* Initiative 10: [[Building Code]] for Lebanon 
* Initiative 11: Financing Mechanisms and Incentive
* Initiative 12: Awareness and Capacity Building 
* Initiative 13: Paving the Way for [[Energy audit|Energy Audit]] and ESCO Business 
* Initiative 14: Promotion of Energy Efficient Equipment&lt;ref name="NEEAP"&gt;Regional Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency. (2011). the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) for Lebanon. Retrieved from: http://www.rcreee.org/content/national-energy-efficiency-action-plan-neeap-lebanon&lt;/ref&gt;

===NEEAP 2012-2020, NREAP and RES===
LCEC is currently updating and developing the NEEAP 2015-2020 while preparing the Renewable Energy Strategy (RES) and the National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) for Lebanon. The Lebanese NEEAP was prepared in conformance with the Arab EE guideline (based on the EU directive 2006/32/EC on energy end-use efficiency and energy service) and Lebanon was the first Arab country to officially adopt such plan.&lt;ref name="NEEAP"/&gt;

== Pilot projects ==

The activities of the Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC) expand to the implementation of pilot projects in the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector. Through grants, donations, and partnerships, LCEC was successful in implementing different pilot projects and is currently working on the implementation of many others. Pilot projects help initiate a new momentum in the market, and most importantly offer an opportunity to benefit from the lessons learnt.

===2006: 500 solar water heaters===

The [[Chinese government]] donated 500 solar water heaters to be installed in the liberated areas in [[South Lebanon]]. The Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC) was assigned by the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) to support its installation both technically and financially. The workload consisted of handling all project logistics, hosting Chinese experts to conduct an intensive training workshop, assisting in the selection of beneficiaries.&lt;ref&gt;Paving the Way for the Mediterranean Solar Plan. (2011). Benchmarking of existing practice against EU norms. Retrieved from: {{cite web |url=http://www.pavingtheway-msp.eu/index.php?option=com_downloads&amp;task=category&amp;cid=7&amp;Itemid=56 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902194052/http://www.pavingtheway-msp.eu/index.php?option=com_downloads&amp;task=category&amp;cid=7&amp;Itemid=56 |archivedate=2013-09-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the above, a sum of 112,500 USD was raised to cater for the installation of the units.

Unfortunately and as a result of the July war in Lebanon, 200 solar units were destroyed. In this regards, and after the impressive success of the project, LCEC has followed up with the Chinese Embassy to provide Lebanon with similar donation due to its direct results on the beneficiaries. This could be achieved and will be offered under the second phase of the project.&lt;ref name="ST"&gt;Solar Thermal World. (2009).

===2008: Solar water heaters for not-for-profit facilities===

The United Nations Development Program, through its Energy and Environment Programme, with the funding of [[Swedish International Development Agency|the Swedish International Development Agency (SIDA)]], has launched a pilot project to install solar water heaters at public / NGO facilities in selected damaged areas of Beirut, Bekaa &amp; South Lebanon due to July 2006 war.
Under the supervision of the Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation (LCEC), the project consisted of installing 93 individual (natural circulation) solar water heaters, and 11 collective (forced circulation) solar water heaters, covering a total of 1,040 square meters of collection area.
The solar water heating units were executed by three qualified firms through an international bid, and divided into 5 lots.&lt;ref&gt;Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation Project. (2013).Pilot Projects. Retrieved from: http://www.lcecp.org.lb/pilotprojects.php?li=5&amp;pproject=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===CFL pilot project in Niha, Bekaa===

Based on a collaboration agreement signed between LCEC and Electricité de Zahlé (EDZ), EDZ installed around 1,048 [[Compact fluorescent lamp|Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs)]] in the village of Niha in the [[Bekaa]] area, completely free-of-charge. The 1,048 CFLs were purchased by LCEC and the installation was offered free-of-charge by EDZ as an in-kind contribution.

The direct objective of the pilot project is to reduce the energy bill of the different consumers and therefore remove part of the financial burden on families in this area. Another major objective is the reduction of GHG emissions generated by inefficient lighting. In addition, setting this project as a success story supported by real achieved savings can increase the market share of energy efficient lighting in Lebanon and consequently boost the market toward the phase out of incandescent bulbs in the country. This strategy goes with the different strategies followed by many countries in [[Europe]], [[United States|America]], and [[Australia]]. Finally, the project shall achieve a percentage of dollars savings in the national energy bill.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Environment. (2010). Energy Crisis. Retrieved from: http://test.moe.gov.lb/Documents/SOER%20Chap%209.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two very important reasons for which the project has chosen EDZ for this installation. EDZ is a professional electrical utility that has online control on the electricity consumption in each and every house. This means that EDZ is able to track the changes in the energy bills resulting from the project implementation and can therefore report on the measurement and savings in kWh and in dollars. The second reason is that the management at EDZ is ready to support this program financially at a later stage.

Following a site survey done by EDZ, LCEC supplied around 1,048 CFL's of different sizes to EDZ with a total cost not exceeding 2,500 USD.

Due to the importance of this pilot project, the event was covered by the media in every aspect. In fact, a press release was distributed to the main newspapers in town, namely [[An-Nahar|Annahar]], [[As-Safir|Assafir]], [[Al Anwar]], and [[Al-Mustaqbal (newspaper)|Al Mustaqbal]]. In addition, the project was covered by two main television stations in Lebanon, namely [[Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation|LBCI]] and NTV.

Recently, LCEC in collaboration with EDZ has worked on developing a complete study report on the success of this project, one year after its completion. The results of the study will be published soon by LCEC.

These pilot projects are preparing the ground towards implanting a clear DSM strategy developing currently. The strategy shall target the installation of a massive number of CFL fixtures all over Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation. (2010). Pilot Projects. Retrieved from: http://www.lcecp.org.lb/pilotprojects.php?li=5&amp;pproject=1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese government grant - phase 2===

After the success of the 500 solar water heaters donated by the People’s Republic of China and subsequent to the Israeli’s attacks in July 2006 leading to the destruction of 200 of units earlier that year, the LCEC and the Ministry of Energy &amp; Water (MEW) have been closely coordinating with the Chinese government to proceed with a phase 2 grant that will include 600 solar water heaters of similar capacity and type of phase 1 (208 L tank capacity and 28 glass tubes).

===Beirut River Solar Snake===
The “Beirut River Solar Snake” (BRSS) is the 1st pilot project in Lebanon to produce electricity from solar energy. It was launched by the Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW) in 2013 and is under the supervision and management of LCEC. The project will be extended over a distance of 6.5 Km on the top of the Beirut River and have 10 MW installed capacity to be the first grid connected solar farm that seeks to generate and supply EDL with clean energy. The project will also have a technical building. The implementation of the first phase has an installed capacity of 1 MW extending over an area of 16,000 m2.&lt;ref&gt;Association of Lebanese Industrialists. (2013). Phoenix Offer to Ali Members. Retrieved from: http://www.ali.org.lb/english/morearticles.asp?newsid=123&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the 1st phase of the project is 3.1 Million USD (with a budget of 4 million USD) and is completely financed by MEW. The execution of the first phase started in July 2014 is now completed.&lt;ref&gt;BRSS Lebanon. (2015). Beirut River Solar Snake (BRSS). Retrieved from: http://brsslebanon.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public Street Lighting===
LCEC was engaged in the public street lighting project and managed the installation of 500 solar street lights at the end of December 2014 through a grant by the Chinese Government in the Dora, Jounieh, Cornet Chehwan and Batroun areas.

===French FASEP Initiative for Solar Photovoltaic Educational Platform===
The “Educational and Demonstration Platform for Renewable Energies in Lebanon" project is a joint initiative between the French company Transénergie and the Ministry of Energy and Water represented by LCEC with the direct support of the Industrial Research Institute (IRI) and UNDP Lebanon. It aims at the installation of an educational platform to be used by researchers, educational institutions, university students, as well as professionals in the solar photovoltaic sector.&lt;ref&gt;Economy and Ecology Online. (2014). French FASEP Initiative Finances Solar Photovoltaic Educational Platform. Retrieved from: http://www.eecoy.com/content/french-fasep-initiative-finances-solar-photovoltaic-educational-platform&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global Solar Water Heating Market Transformation and Strengthening Initiative ===
A main component of LCEC’s work is the GEF-funded project “Global Solar Water Heating Market Transformation and Strengthening Initiative” aiming at the installation of around 190,000 square meters of solar water heaters (SWHs) during the timeline of the project from 2010 till the end of 2014. Another aim of the project is to help the market reach a total annual sale of 50,000 m2 and the installation of 1,050,000 square meters of SWHs capacity by 2020. To achieve these goals, the project worked on pilot installation of solar water heating, on training engineers and technicians, advertisement and marketing, and all other aspects that affect the solar water heating market growth.

Till july 2014, a total of 5,878 installations were approved for SWH loans, and 49.63% of which benefited from the USD 200 subsidy. In total, 33,239 systems sold between 2012 and 2013.
 
Moreover, LCEC provides both the public and private sector with expert advice, finance and accreditation, develops energy efficiency standards and labels, and provides national energy database indicators.&lt;ref&gt;Data Bank.

===ESCO Companies===
Since 2001, a nationwide program on energy audits for medium and large consuming facilities was initiated. This was a project financed by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), managed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and called “Lebanon Cross Sectoral Energy Efficiency and Removal of Barriers to ESCO Operation”. The initial period 2002-2004 saw delays in project implementation; consequently, the project was essentially restarted with a new project team in 2005 and was operational until the end of 2009.
The project was mainly targeting the high combined consumption of energy in industrial plants and buildings, where the potential for energy savings is important and promising. In 2006, LCEC aimed and worked on creating a market for ESCOs (Energy Service Companies that offer energy efficiency improvement services) where the end user can request a specialized ESCO to conduct an energy audit.

Over 125 audits were completed within the project, mostly for large facilities.
 
Only one ESCO was operational at the beginning of the programme. In 2010 only 8 ESCOs where active, nowadays more than 30 are available and the market is still expanding rapidly. 
To further support the growth of the ESCOs market, LCEC launched an initiative in NEAAP called “Paving the Way for Energy Audit and ESCO Business”. The purpose of this initiative is to support the development of the ESCO working in the energy audit business and provide them with the suitable financial, fiscal and technical incentives to remove all the obstacles hindering their growth. To support this initiative, LCEC has offered periodical trainings, workshops and seminars on energy audit activities and procedures to technician, engineers, bankers and to all those involved in the field.
The ESCO pre-qualification programme was launched by LCEC by 2014 in order to regulate the market and have a recommended list of companies for potential projects.&lt;ref&gt;Lebanese Center for Energy Conservation Project.

== Financing ==

The National Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Action (NEEREA) is a green financing mechanism that allows private sector entities to apply to subsidized loans for any type of EE and/or RE projects.
The loan has a ceiling of 20 million USD and is offered at an interest rate of 0.6% for 14 years. The greens loans are provided through any of the Lebanese commercial banks to directly reach the end user.&lt;ref&gt;Intercontinental Bank of Lebanon. (2014). Green Loans. Retrieved from: http://www.ibl.com.lb/RetailProducts/Loans/GreenLoans/tabid/184/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The European Union is contributing to NEEREA by offering a grant over a share of the investment cost of maximum 5 million USD, 15% for nonsubsidized sectors and 5% for subsidized sectors.

By January 2015, more than 200 projects were approved under the NEEREA financing mechanism with a total amount of more than 200 Million USD. Results show that around 60% of the projects were for solar photovoltaic while 82% of loans amount were for green buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Regional Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency.

This '''list of culinary fruits''' contains the names of some [[fruit]]s that are considered [[Eating|edible]] in some [[cuisine]]s. The word "fruit" is used in several different ways.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Vegetable#Terminology]]&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of fruit for these lists is a culinary fruit, i.e. "Any sweet, edible part of a [[plant]] that resembles fruit, even if it does not develop from a floral ovary; also used in a technically imprecise sense for some sweet or sweetish [[vegetable]]s, some of which may resemble a true fruit or are used in cookery as if they were a [[:wiktionary:fruit|fruit]], for example [[rhubarb]]."&lt;ref&gt;See the [[:wiktionary:fruit#Usage notes|Wiktionary definition of fruit]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Many edible plant parts that are ''[[fruit|true fruits]]'' botanically speaking, are not considered culinary fruits. They are classified as [[vegetable]]s in the [[food|culinary]] sense (for example: the [[tomato]], [[zucchini]], and so on), and hence they do not appear in this list. Similarly, some botanical fruits are classified as nuts (e.g. [[Brazil nut]] and various [[almond]]s), or staples (e.g. [[breadfruit]]), and likewise do not appear here. There also exist many fruits which are edible and palatable but for various reasons have not become popular.

{{TOC limit|2}}
&lt;!-- {{horizontal TOC}}} needs line breaks
each of {{List TOC}}, {{List TOC Letters}}, or {{TOC 2D}}
needs too much data entry,
as well as changes when section headers change.

The following was an attempt to include the last three top level sections, which the prior ToC didn't show (and readers should see in the ToC).
I decided to go with just "TOC limit|2" instead.
If you feel a need to do something else, let's discuss it on the Talk page. -lentower

==Culinary fruits by climate==

===Temperate fruits===

[[Fruit]]s of [[temperate]] climates are almost always borne on [[tree]]s or [[woody plant|woody]] [[shrub]]s or [[liana]]s. They will not grow adequately in the [[tropics]], as they need a period of cold (a [[chilling requirement]]) each year before they will flower. The [[apple (fruit)|apple]], [[pear]], [[cherry]], and [[plum]] are the most widely grown and eaten, owing to their adaptability. Many other fruits are important regionally but do not figure prominently in commerce. Many sorts of small fruit on this list are gathered from the wild, just as they were in [[Neolithic]] times.

===Fruits of North American origin===
[[File:LocationNorthAmerica.png|thumb|right]]

Canada and the United States are home to a surprising number of edible plants, especially berries; however, only three are commercially grown/known on a global scale (grapes, cranberries, and blueberries.) Many of the fruits below are still eaten locally as they have been for centuries and others are generating renewed interest by eco-friendly gardeners (less need for bug control) and chefs of the region alike.

==Culinary fruits by type of flora==

===Family Rosaceae===
The family [[Rosaceae]] dominates the temperate fruits, both in numbers and in importance. The pome fruits, stone fruits and brambles are fruits of plants in Rosaceae.

The [[pome]] fruits:
{{div col}}
* [[#apple|Apple]] and crabapple
* [[#chokeberry|Chokeberry]]
* [[#hawthorn|Hawthorn]]
* [[#loquat|Loquat]]
* [[#medlar|Medlar]]
* [[#pear|Pear]]
* [[#quince|Quince]]
* [[#rose hip|Rose hip]]
* [[#rowan|Rowan]]
* [[#service tree|Service tree]]
* [[#serviceberry|Serviceberry]]
* [[#shipova|Shipova]]
{{div col end}}

The stone fruits, [[drupe]]s of [[genus]] ''[[Prunus]]'':

{{div col}}
* [[#apricot|Apricot]] (''Prunus armeniaca'' or ''Armeniaca vulgaris'')
* [[#cherry|Cherry]], including sweet, black, sour, and wild species
* [[#chokecherry|Chokecherry]]
* [[#greengage|Greengage]]
* [[#peach|Peach]] and nectarine
* [[#plum|Plum]] of several species
* [[#drupe hubrids|Hybrids]] of the preceding species
{{div col end}}

===Berries===
In non-technical usage, '''[[berry]]''' means any small fruit that can be eaten whole and lacks objectionable seeds. The '''bramble fruits''', [[compound fruit]]s of [[genus]] ''[[Rubus]]'' (blackberries), are some of the most popular of these that are not true berries:

{{div col}}
* [[#blackberry|Blackberry]], including many species and hybrids
* [[#cloudberry|Cloudberry]]
* [[#loganberry|Loganberry]]
* [[#raspberry|Raspberry]] of several species
* [[#salmonberry|Salmonberry]]
* [[#thimbleberry|Thimbleberry]]
* [[#wineberry|Wineberry]]
{{div col end}}

The true berries are dominated by the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Ericaceae]], many of which are hardy in the [[subarctic]]:

{{div col}}
* [[#bearberry|Bearberry]]
* [[#bilberry|Bilberry]]
* [[#blueberry|Blueberry]]
* [[#crowberry|Crowberry]]
* [[#cranberry|Cranberry]]
* [[#falberry|Falberry]]
* [[#huckleberry|Huckleberry]]
* [[#lingonberry|Lingonberry]]
* [[#strawberry tree|Strawberry tree]]
{{div col end}}

Other berries not in [[Rosaceae]] or [[Ericaceae]]:
{{div col}}
* [[#acaí|Açaí]]
* [[#barberry|Barberry]]
* [[#currant|Currant]]
* [[#elderberry|Elderberry]]
* [[#gooseberry|Gooseberry]]
* [[#hackberry|Hackberry]]
* [[#honeysuckle|Honeysuckle]]&lt;ref name="honeysuckle" /&gt;

* [[#sea buckthorn|Sea-buckthorn]]
* [[#sea grape|Sea grape]]
* [[#ugni|Ugniberry]]
* [[#wolfberry|Wolfberry]]
{{div col end}}

===Cacti and other succulents===
Several [[cactus|cacti]] yield edible fruits, which are important traditional foods for some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] peoples:

{{div col}}
* [[#cardon|Cardón]]
* [[#dragonfruit|Dragonfruit]]
* [[#prickly pear|Prickly pear]]
* [[#saguaro|Saguaro]]
* [[#cereus peruvianus|Cereus peruvianus]]
* Numerous other cactus species
{{div col end}}

===Gymnosperms with fruit-like structures===
Only [[Angiosperm]]s have fruit, a structure that surrounds the seed. [[Gymnosperm]]s have naked seeds, but some of them have reproductive structures that resemble fruit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gifford, E.M. |author2=Foster, A.S. |year=1989 |title= Morphology and evolution of vascular plants |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company |location=New York }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Podocarps====
Podocarps are conifers in the family [[Podocarpaceae]], The seed [[conifer cone|cones]] are highly modified and, in some, the seed is surrounded by fleshy scale tissue, resembling a drupe. These berry-like cone scales are eaten by birds which then disperse the seeds in their droppings and the cones can be eaten in many species. Podocarps are either half-hardy or frost tender, depending on species. Many genera are similar in that they have edible "fruits" and often don't have a common name.

{{div col}}

* [[#nageia|Nageia]]
* [[#podocarpus|Podocarpus]]
* [[#prumnopitys|Prumnopitys]]
* [[#rimu|Rimu]]
* [[#totara|Tōtara]]
{{div col end}}

====Other gymnosperms====
* [[#juniper berry|Juniper berry]] (a berry-like cone)

===Melons and other members of family Cucurbitaceae===

Most gourds and many melons are regarded as culinary vegetables. The
following are generally regarded as fruits:

{{div col}}
* [[#bitter melon|Bitter melon]]
* [[#cantaloupe|Cantaloupe]]
* [[#galia|Galia]]
* [[#honeydew|Honeydew]]
* [[#horned melon|Horned melon]]
* [[#muskmelon|Muskmelon]]
* [[#watermelon|Watermelon]]
{{div col end}}

===Accessory fruits===

The [[accessory fruit]]s, seed organs which are not botanically berries at all:
* [[#cashew apple|Cashew apple]]
* [[#raisin tree|Raisin tree]]
* [[#strawberry|Strawberry]]

Aside from the Sun, stars are exceedingly small in apparent size, requiring the use of special high-resolution equipment to image. For example, the first star, other than the Sun, to be directly imaged was [[Betelgeuse]]. It has an angular diameter of only 50&amp;nbsp;[[milliarcsecond]]s (mas).&lt;ref name=aj116_2501/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16115">[[File:Lineman changing transformer.jpg|thumb|280px|right|A lineman wearing equipment for hot glove work]]
In [[electrical engineering]], '''live-line working''', also known as '''hotline maintenance''', is the maintenance of electrical equipment, often operating at [[high voltage]], while the equipment is energised. The first techniques for live-line working were developed in the early years of the 20th century, and both equipment and work methods were later refined to deal with increasingly higher voltages. In the 1960s, methods were developed in the laboratory to enable [[Lineman (technician)|field workers]] to come into direct contact with high voltage lines. Such methods can be applied to enable safe work at the highest transmission voltages.

== Background ==

=== Electrical hazards  ===
Electricity is hazardous: an [[electric shock]] from a current as low as 35&amp;nbsp;milliamps is sufficient to cause [[fibrillation]] of the heart in vulnerable individuals.&lt;ref name="Brauer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brauer|first= Roger L.|title=Safety and Health for Engineers|publisher=Wiley-IEEE|year=2006|pages=163–165|isbn=978-0-471-75092-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRjz5wJWZecC&amp;pg=PA163}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even a healthy individual is at risk of falling from a high structure due to loss of muscle control. Higher currents can cause [[respiratory failure]] and result in extensive and life-threatening [[Burn#Causes of burns|burns]].&lt;ref name="Brauer" /&gt; The first recorded human fatality occurred in 1879 when a stage carpenter in [[Lyon]], [[France]] touched a 250&amp;nbsp;volt wire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=R.C.|author2=Rudall, D. |year=1992|title=Injury Mechanisms And Therapeutic Advances In The Study Of Electrical Shock|journal=Proceedings of the Annual International Conference of the IEEE|volume=7|pages=2825–2827|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel2/1028/12827/00593814.pdf?arnumber=593814|doi=10.1109/iembs.1992.593814}}{{Dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of any visible sign that a conductor is energised, even at high voltages, makes electricity a particular hazard.

At high voltages, it is unnecessary to come into direct contact with charged equipment to be shocked. An [[electric field]] surrounds all charged devices. Bringing a conducting object such as a human body into that field can intensify the field enough for [[electrical breakdown]] of the air and an [[electric arc|arc]] to jump from the equipment to [[ground (electricity)|earth]] via that person. In the U.S., the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] establishes clearance guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=9870|title=Working on Exposed Energized Parts|work=Regulations (Standards - 29 CFR) |publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|accessdate=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solid materials such as rubber, while excellent insulators at low voltages, are also subject to electrical failure if subjected to a high enough field.

=== Avoiding loss of supply ===
[[Electric utility|Electricity utilities]] wish to avoid [[power outage|loss of supply]], for which they receive customer complaints or are financially penalised. At the same time they are obligated to maintain and replace their electrical equipment on a regular basis. Due to the hazard of high voltage, it is normally necessary for equipment to be isolated from the supply before being worked upon, termed a ''planned outage''.

In a [[wikt:radially|radially]]-supplied system, a planned outage results in a loss of supply, unless equipment is connected in parallel, back up supplies are available or the grid is reswitched to transfer the [[electrical load]] elsewhere. An interconnected grid results in no loss of power, but security of supply is compromised, and [[economic dispatch|out-of-merit generation]] may need to be ordered to maintain system security, which can be expensive.

== Methods ==
In general, there are three methods of live-line working which help workers avoid the considerable hazards of live line working.&lt;ref name="EPRI" /&gt; In various ways, they all serve to prevent current flowing from the live equipment through the worker.

; Hot stick or Live Line Tool 
[[Hot stick]]s are used in live line work by having the worker remain at a specified distance from the live parts and carry out the work by means of an insulating stick. Tools can be attached to the stick, allowing work to be performed with the worker himself safely away from the live conductors.

; Insulating Gloves or Rubber Gloves
A live line worker is electrically protected by insulating gloves and other insulating equipment, and carries out the work in direct mechanical contact with live parts.

; Barehand or Potential
The barehanded approach has a live line worker performing the work in direct electric contact with live parts. Before contact, the worker's body is raised to the same [[electric potential]] as the live parts, and then held there by electric connection, while maintaining suitable isolation from the surroundings which are at different potentials, like the ground, other people or trees. Because the worker and the work are at the same potential, no current flows through the worker.

; Unearthed or De-energised
Some organizations additionally consider working on unearthed de-energised equipment to be another form of live-line working. This is because the line might become inadvertently charged (e.g. through a back-charged transformer, possibly as a result of an improperly connected, inadequately isolated emergency generator at a customer facility), or [[mutual inductance|inductively coupled]] from an adjacent in-service line. To prevent this, the line is first grounded via a clamp known as a bond or drain earth. Once this is in place, further work is not considered to be live-line working.

=== Hot stick ===
{{main|Hot stick}}
Hot-stick working appeared in the second decade of the 20th century, when insulating poles made from baked wood were used for tasks such as replacing [[fuse (electrical)|fuses]], replacing post insulators, and transferring lines onto temporary supports.&lt;ref name="EPRI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/public/000000000001008746.pdf|title=Live Work Guide for Substations|date=October 2004|publisher=[[EPRI]]|accessdate=8 December 2008}}{{Dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sticks enabled the linemen to carry out the work without infringing on the minimum clearance distances from live equipment. As experience with the techniques developed, then the operating voltages at which the work was performed increased. With the advent of [[fibreglass]] poles in the late 1950s, which neither split nor soaked up rainwater, utilities were prepared to carry out hot-stick working to their highest operating voltages, perhaps 765&amp;nbsp;kV.&lt;ref name="EPRI" /&gt;

Tools, such as hooks or [[socket wrench]]es can be mounted at the end of the pole. More sophisticated poles can accept pneumatically  or hydraulically driven power tools which allow, for example, bolts to be unscrewed remotely. A rotary wire brush allows a terminal to be scoured clean before a connection is made. However, a worker's dexterity is naturally reduced when operating tools at the end of a pole that is several metres long.&lt;ref name="Stix"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stix|first=Gary|date=September 1988|title=Working hot: life at 765 kV|journal=IEEE Spectrum|volume=25|issue=9|pages=54&amp;nbsp;56|issn=0018-9235|url=http://www.simson.net/ref/1988/IEEE_Working_Live.pdf|doi=10.1109/6.7169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insulating glove or rubber glove working===

Usually applied for work above 1 kV AC 1.5 kV DC
The primary classes are:
Class 1 - phase to phase working voltage 7.5 kV
Class 2 - phase to phase working voltage 17 kV
Class 3 - phase to phase working voltage 26.5 kV
Class 4 - phase to phase working voltage 36 kV

Gloves protect the worker from exposure to the live part being worked upon sometimes referred to as the 1st point of contact; the point where current would enter the body should an inadvertent contact be made.
Covers of insulating material such as blankets and linehose are employed in rubber glove working to protect the worker from exposure to a part at a different potential sometimes referred to as the 2nd point of contact;  the point where current would leave the body should an inadvertent contact be made.

=== Bare hand ===
Bare-hand, or potential working involves placing the worker in direct electrical contact with an energized overhead line. The worker might work alongside the lines, from a platform that is suspended from them, or may sit or stand directly on the line itself.&lt;ref name="Stix" /&gt; In all cases, the worker's body is maintained at the same voltage as the line. It is imperative that the worker maintain appropriate and adequate limits of approach to any part at a different potential.

The first procedures for barehand working were developed in 1960 by Harold L. Rorden, a high-voltage engineer for [[American Electric Power]].&lt;ref name="EPRI"/&gt; Techniques were further refined following field and laboratory tests.

There are a number of ways in which the worker can access the live parts:

* The worker can access from a specialist type of mobile elevating work platform (MEWP) termed an insulating aerial device (IAD) which has a boom of insulating material and which all conductive parts at the platform end are bonded together.  There are other requirements for safe working such as gradient control devices, a means of preventing a vacuum in the hydraulic lines,  etc.
* The worker can stand on an insulating ladder which is maneuvered to the line by means of non-conductive rope.
* The worker is lowered from a helicopter and transfers himself to the line.
* The worker is brought alongside the wire in a hovering helicopter and works from that position.

As the lineman approaches the wire, an arc will form between them as the worker is charged. This arc can be debilitating, and the worker must immediately bond himself electrically to the line to prevent further arcing.&lt;ref name="Stix" /&gt; A worker may use a conducting wand during the approach to first make the connection. Once on the line, the worker is safe from shock as both the lineman and the wire are at the same [[electric potential]], and no current passes through his body. This is the same principle that allows birds to safely alight on power lines.&lt;ref name="Stix" /&gt;

When the work is completed, the process is reversed to remove the worker safely from the wire. Barehand working provides the lineman with greater dexterity than the hot stick method, and may be the preferred option if conditions permit it.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=R.H.|author2=Malinowski, J.H. |title=Power System Operation|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Professional]]|year=1970|pages=178–180|isbn=978-0-07-041977-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tk6yXzu62IC&amp;pg=PA178}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this technique, [[Insulator (electrical)|insulator strings]], conductor spacers and [[Stockbridge damper|vibration dampers]] can be replaced, or lines [[Rope splicing|spliced]], without any loss of supply.&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;

The strong electric field surrounding charged equipment is enough to drive a current of approximately 15&amp;nbsp;μA for each kV·m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; through a human body.&lt;ref&gt;

The suit is in effect a wearable [[Faraday cage]], which equalizes the potential over the body, and ensures there is no through-tissue current.&lt;ref&gt;

== General precautions ==
Calculation of minimum approach distances take account of switching surges and other transients.  Transmission systems are often fitted with coordinated protection devices called [[autorecloser]]s, which are [[circuit breaker]]s that automatically attempt to remake a circuit after a [[short circuit|fault]]. In the event that a fault did occur it would be most undesirable for the autorecloser to re-energise the circuit because the limits of approach would be greatly reduced and the workers' position could be compromised. Hence, auto-reclosing equipment is rendered inoperative while live working takes place. Additional protection against unplanned overvoltage events (such as switching surges) can be provided by means of a [[surge diverter]] known as portable protective air gap.&lt;ref name="EPRI" /&gt;

An [[electric arc]] is extremely bright, including in the [[ultraviolet]], and can cause [[arc eye]], a painful and potentially [[blindness|blinding]] condition. Workers may be provided with appropriately tinted goggles that protect their vision in the event of a flash, and provide defence against debris ejected by an arc.

Government regulations may regulate conditions for live working conditions.&lt;ref name="Stix" /&gt; For example, in United States, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] may require that more than one worker be present on site when working on live equipment above a specified voltage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=9868#1910.269(l)(1)(i)|title=Electric Power Generation, Transmission, and Distribution|work=Regulations (Standards - 29 CFR) |publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|accessdate=3 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work may be postponed if adverse weather conditions such as lightning or rainfall are anticipated.

The '''Lockheed Martin Compact Fusion Reactor''' is a proposed nuclear fusion reactor. It is the goal of a project at [[Lockheed Martin]]’s [[Skunk Works]]. It is a high-beta fusion reactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=FuseNet: The European Fusion Education Network|url=http://www.fusenet.eu/node/400|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506035703/http://www.fusenet.eu/node/400|deadurl=no|archivedate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The high-[[Beta (plasma physics)|beta]] configuration allows a [[Compact toroid|compact fusion reactor]] (CFR) design and expedited development. 

''High beta'' implies that the ratio of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] pressure to magnetic pressure is greater than or equal to 1. By contrast [[tokamak]] designs reach only 0.05.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==History==

The project began in 2010,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.theengineer.co.uk/news/news-analysis/new-details-on-compact-fusion-reveal-scale-of-challenge/1019393.article|title = New details on compact fusion reveal scale of challenge|last = Nathan|first = Stuart|date = 22 October 2014|work = The Engineer|accessdate = 24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was publicly presented at the Google [[Solve for X]] forum on February 7, 2013.

In October 2014 [[Lockheed Martin]] announced a plan to "build and test a compact fusion reactor in less than a year with a prototype to follow within five years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/lockheed-says-makes-breakthrough-fusion-energy-project-123840986--finance.html|title=Lockheed says makes breakthrough on fusion energy project|last1=Shalal|first1=Andrea|accessdate=15 October 2014|agency=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2016, Rob Weiss announced that Lockheed Martin continued to support the project and would increase its investment in it.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nextbigfuture.com/2016/05/lockheed-portable-fusion-proejct-still.html|title=Lockheed Portable Fusion project still making progress|first=Brian|last=Wang|date=May 3, 2016|website=[[Next Big Future]]|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story/defense/innovation/2016/05/03/lockheed-nuclear-fusion-generator-investment/83870398/|title=Lockheed Still Supporting Portable Nuclear Generator|first= Aaron |last=Mehta|date=May 3, 2016|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Lockheed Martins' Compact Fusion Reactor.png|thumb|A sketch of the plasma geometry and magnetic coils inside an early model of Lockheed Martins' compact fusion reactor. This design has since been superseded with a model using only two main cusps.]]

CFR plans to achieve high beta (the ratio of plasma pressure to the magnetic pressure) by combining cusp confinement and [[magnetic mirror]]s to confine the plasma. Cusps are sharply bent magnetic fields. Ideally, the plasma forms a sheath along the surface of the cusps and plasma leaks out along the axis and edges of the sharply bent field.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, Thomas. "The Lockheed Martin Compact Fusion Reactor." Thursday Colloquium. Princeton University, Princeton. 6 Aug. 2015. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt; The plasma lost along the edges recycles back into the cusps.

CFR uses two mirror sets. A pair of ring mirrors is placed inside the cylindrical reactor vessel at either end. The other mirror set encircles the reactor cylinder. The ring magnets produce a type of [[magnetic field]] known as a [[diamagnetic]] cusp, in which magnetic forces rapidly change direction and push the nuclei towards the midpoint between the two rings. The fields from the external magnets push the nuclei back towards the vessel ends.

Magnetic field strength is an increasing function of distance from the center. This implies that as the plasma pressure causes the plasma to expand, the magnetic field becomes stronger at the plasma edge, increasing containment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

CFR employs [[superconducting magnets]]. These allow strong magnetic fields to be created with less energy than conventional magnets. The CFR has no net current, which Lockheed claimed eliminates the prime source of plasma instabilities. The plasma has a favorable surface-to-volume ratio, which improves confinement. The plasma's small volume reduces the energy needed to achieve fusion.

The project plans to replace the [[microwave]] emitters that heat the plasma in their prototypes with [[neutral beam injection]], in which electrically neutral [[deuterium]] atoms transfer their energy to the plasma. Once initiated, the energy from fusion maintains the necessary temperature for subsequent fusion events.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The eventual device may reach {{val|21|u=m}} in width.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The company claims that each design iteration is shorter and far lower cost than large-scale projects such as the [[Joint European Torus]], [[ITER]] or [[National Ignition Facility|NIF]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.technologyreview.com/news/531836/does-lockheed-martin-really-have-a-breakthrough-fusion-machine/|title = Does Lockheed Martin Really Have a Breakthrough Fusion Machine?|last = Talbot|first = David|date = October 20, 2014|work = [[Technology Review]]|accessdate = 24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{val|200|u=MW}} [[Thermal power station|P&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;]] reactor, {{val|18|u=m}} long by {{val|7|u=m}} in diameter, produces about a {{val|2000|u=ton}} reactor, similar in size to an [[United States naval reactors|A5W]] nuclear submarine fission reactor.&lt;ref name="T4B"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lockheed Martin Compact Fusion Reactor Concept, Confinement Model and T4B Experiment|url=http://fusion4freedom.us/pdfs/McGuireAPS.pdf|publisher=Lockheed Martin Corporation|accessdate=25 December 2017|date=2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225092237/http://fusion4freedom.us/pdfs/McGuireAPS.pdf|archive-date=December 25, 2017|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=wang|first1=brian|title=Lockheed compact fusion reactor design about 100 times larger than first plans|url=https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2017/05/lockheed-compact-fusion-reactor-design-about-100-times-larger-than-first-plans.html|website=NextBigFuture.com|publisher=New big future Inc.|accessdate=25 December 2017|date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenges===
Ring magnets require protection from the plasma's neutron radiation. Plasma temperatures must reach many millions of [[kelvin]]s. Superconducting magnets must be kept just above [[absolute zero]] to maintain [[superconductivity]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The ''blanket'' component that lines the reactor vessel has two functions: it captures the neutrons and transfers their energy to a coolant, and forces the neutrons to collide with [[lithium]] atoms, transforming them into tritium to fuel the reactor. The blanket must be an estimated 80–150&amp;nbsp;cm thick and weigh 300–1000 tons.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Prototypes==
The prototype was planned to be a 100-megawatt [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] reactor measuring {{convert|7 by 10|ft}} that could fit on the back of a large truck and would be about one tenth the size of current reactor prototypes. 100 megawatts is enough to provide power for 80,000 people.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Norris|first1=Guy|date=20 October 2014|title=Fusion Frontier|magazine=[[Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A series of prototypes were constructed to approach this goal.

===T-4===
Technical results presented on the T4 experiment in 2015 showed a cold, partially ionized plasma with the following parameters: peak electron temperature of 20 [[Electron volts]], {{val|e=16|u=m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;}} electron density, less than 1% ionization fraction and {{val|3|u=kW}} of input power. No confinement or fusion reaction rates were presented.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

McGuire presented two theoretical reactor concepts in 2015. One was an ideal configuration weighing 200 metric tons with 1 meter of cryogenic radiation shielding and 15 [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] magnets. The other was a conservative configuration weighing 2,000 metric tons, with 2 meters of cryogenic radiation shielding and 5 Tesla magnets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=Regina|title=Preliminary density and temperature measurements in Lockheed Martin's magnetically encapsulated linear ring cusp confinement configuration|journal=57th Annual Meeting of the APS Division of Plasma Physics|date=November 20, 2015|volume=60|issue=10|ref=YP12.00044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Physics professor and director of the [[Culham Centre for Fusion Energy|UK's national Fusion laboratory]] [[Steven Cowley]] called for more data, pointing out that the current thinking in fusion research is that "bigger is better". Other fusion reactors achieve 8 times improvement in heat confinement when machine size is doubled.&lt;ref name=cowl&gt;{{citation |author=McGarry, Brendan |url=http://defensetech.org/2014/10/16/scientists-skeptical-of-lockheeds-fusion-breakthrough/ |title=Scientists Skeptical of Lockheed's Fusion Breakthrough |work=DefenseTech' |date=16 October 2014 |accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Half of embryonic miscarriages (25% of all miscarriages) have an [[aneuploidy]] (abnormal number of chromosomes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1980|title=Anatomic and chromosomal anomalies in 639 spontaneous abortuses|journal=Human Genetics|volume=55|issue=1|pages=87–98|doi=10.1007/BF00329132|pmid=7450760|vauthors=Kajii T, Ferrier A, Niikawa N, Takahara H, Ohama K, Avirachan S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common chromosome abnormalities found in miscarriages include [[Trisomy|autosomal trisomy]] (22-32%), [[Turner syndrome|monosomy X]] (5-20%), [[Polyploid|triploidy]] (6-8%), [[tetraploidy]] (2-4%), or other structural chromosomal abnormalities (2%).&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt; Genetic problems are more likely to occur with older parents; this may account for the higher rates observed in older women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pregnancy Over Age 30 | website=MUSC Children's Hospital | url = http://www.musckids.com/health_library/hrpregnant/over30.htm | accessdate = December 18, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061113233603/http://www.musckids.com/health_library/hrpregnant/over30.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = November 13, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no evidence that progesterone given in the first trimester reduces the risk of miscarriage, and luteal phase progesterone deficiency may or may not be a contributing factor to miscarriage.&lt;ref name="Cochrane"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wahabi HA, Fayed AA, Esmaeil SA, Al Zeidan RA | title = Progestogen for treating threatened miscarriage | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 12 | pages = CD005943 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22161393 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD005943.pub4 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0013622/ | editor1-last = Wahabi | editor1-first = Hayfaa A | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131020003112/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0013622/ | archivedate = October 20, 2013 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update inline|reason=Updated version https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30081430|date = November 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bukulmez O, Arici A | title = Luteal phase defect: Myth or reality | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 727–44, ix | year = 2004 | pmid = 15550332 | doi = 10.1016/j.ogc.2004.08.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second and third trimesters===
Second trimester losses may be due to maternal factors such as [[uterine malformation]], growths in the uterus ([[Uterine fibroid|fibroid]]s), or [[Cervical incompetence|cervical problems]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; These conditions also may contribute to [[premature birth]].&lt;ref name="webmd" /&gt; Unlike first-trimester miscarriages, second-trimester miscarriages are less likely to be caused by a genetic abnormality; chromosomal aberrations are found in a third of cases.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt; Infection during the third trimester can cause a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

=== Age ===
{{Further|Advanced maternal age}}
The age of the pregnant woman is a significant risk factor.  Miscarriage rates increase steadily with age, with more substantial increases after age 35.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bray I, Gunnell D, [[George Davey Smith|Davey Smith G]]|year=2006|title=Advanced paternal age: How old is too old?|journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health|volume=60|issue=10|pages=851–3|doi=10.1136/jech.2005.045179|pmc=2566050|pmid=16973530}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In those under the age of 35 the risk is about 10% while it is about 45% in those over the age of 40.&lt;ref name="John2012" /&gt; Risk begins to increase around the age of 30.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Epi" /&gt; Paternal age is associated with increased risk.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=175}}

===Obesity, eating disorders and caffeine===
Not only is obesity associated with miscarriage, it can result in sub-fertility and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recurrent miscarriage is also related to obesity. Women with [[bulimia nervosa]] and [[anorexia nervosa]] may have a greater risk for miscarriage. Nutrient deficiencies have not been found to impact miscarriage rates but [[hyperemesis gravidarum]] sometimes precedes a miscarriage.
{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}}

[[Caffeine]] consumption also has been correlated to miscarriage rates, at least at higher levels of intake.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; However, such higher rates have been found to be statistically significant only in certain circumstances.

Vitamin supplementation has generally not shown to be effective in preventing miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue = 5|pages = CD004073|last=Balogun|first=Olukunmi O|last2=da Silva Lopes|first2=Katharina|last3=Ota|first3=Erika|last4=Takemoto|first4=Yo|last5=Rumbold|first5=Alice|last6=Takegata|first6=Mizuki|last7=Mori|first7=Rintaro|date=2016-05-06|isbn = |language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd004073.pub4|pmid = 27150280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese traditional medicine has not been found to prevent miscarriage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Endocrine disorders===
Disorders of the thyroid may affect pregnancy outcomes. Related to this, iodine deficiency is strongly associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}} The risk of miscarriage is increased in those with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}} Women with well-controlled diabetes have the same risk of miscarriage as those without diabetes.&lt;ref name=Ferri2017&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred F.

===Food poisoning===
Ingesting food that has been contaminated with [[listeriosis]], [[toxoplasmosis]], and [[salmonella]] is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name = gloss/&gt;

===Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling===
Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are procedures conducted to assess the fetus. A sample of amniotic fluid is obtained by the insertion of a needle through the abdomen and into the uterus. Chorionic villus sampling is a similar procedure with a sample of tissue removed rather than fluid. These procedures are not associated with pregnancy loss during the second trimester but they are associated with miscarriages and birth defects in the first trimester.&lt;ref name="Alfirevic"/&gt; Miscarriage caused by invasive prenatal diagnosis ([[chorionic villus sampling]] (CVS) and [[amniocentesis]]) is rare (about 1%).&lt;ref name="Agarwal-Alfirevic-2012"/&gt;

===Surgery===
The effects of surgery on pregnancy are not well-known including the effects of [[bariatric]] surgery. Abdominal and pelvic surgery are not risk factors in miscarriage. Ovarian tumors and cysts that are removed have not been found to increase the risk of miscarriage. The exception to this is the removal of the corpus luteum from the ovary. This can cause fluctuations in the hormones necessary to maintain the pregnancy.{{sfn|Hoffman|pages=172–173}}

===Medications===
Immunizations have not been found to cause miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=72}} There is no significant association between [[antidepressant]] medication exposure and spontaneous abortion.&lt;ref name="Ross LE 436–443"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross LE|last2=Grigoriadis S|last3=Mamisashvili L|display-authors=etal|date=2013-04-01|title=Selected pregnancy and delivery outcomes after exposure to antidepressant medication: A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=JAMA Psychiatry|volume=70|issue=4|pages=436–443|doi=10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2013.684|pmid=23446732|issn=2168-622X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of miscarriage is not likely decreased by discontinuing [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|SSRI]] prior to pregnancy.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalke|first=Katharine Baratz|last2=Wenzel|first2=Amy|last3=Kim|first3=Deborah R.|date=2016-04-19|title=Depression and Anxiety During Pregnancy: Evaluating the Literature in Support of Clinical Risk-Benefit Decision-Making|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|language=en|volume=18|issue=6|pages=1–12|doi=10.1007/s11920-016-0698-x|pmid=27091646|issn=1523-3812}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some available data suggest that there is a small increased risk of miscarriage for women taking any [[antidepressant]],&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=Gestational exposure to antidepressants and the risk of spontaneous abortion: A review|journal=Current Drug Delivery|volume=7|issue=1|pages=76–92|doi=10.2174/156720110790396508|pmid=19863482|vauthors=Broy P, Bérard A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=Use of antidepressants during pregnancy and the risk of spontaneous abortion|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=182|issue=10|pages=1031–7|doi=10.1503/cmaj.091208|pmc=2900326|pmid=20513781|vauthors=Nakhai-Pour HR, Broy P, Bérard A}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this risk becomes less [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] when excluding studies of poor quality.&lt;ref name="Ross LE 436–443"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yonkers|first=Kimberly A.|last2=Blackwell|first2=Katherine A.|last3=Glover|first3=Janis|last4=Forray|first4=Ariadna|date=2014-01-01|title=Antidepressant Use in Pregnant and Postpartum Women|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=10|issue=1|pages=369–392|doi=10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032813-153626|pmc=4138492|pmid=24313569}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medicines that increase the risk of miscarriage include:

* retinoids&amp;nbsp;
* nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)&amp;nbsp;, such as ibuprofen
* misoprostol&amp;nbsp;
* methotrexate&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Chemotherapy and radiation treatments for cancer===
Ionizing radiation levels given to a woman during cancer treatment cause miscarriage. Exposure can also impact fertility. The use of chemotherapeutic drugs used to treat childhood cancer increases the risk of miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=173}}

===Intercurrent diseases===
Several [[intercurrent diseases in pregnancy]] can potentially increase the risk of miscarriage, including diabetes, [[polycystic ovary syndrome]] (PCOS), hypothyroidism, certain infectious diseases, and autoimmune diseases. PCOS may increase the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Two studies suggested treatment with the drug [[metformin]] significantly lowers the rate of miscarriage in women with PCOS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jakubowicz DJ, Iuorno MJ, Jakubowicz S, Roberts KA, Nestler JE | title = Effects of Metformin on Early Pregnancy Loss in the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome | journal = Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism | volume = 87 | issue = 2 | pages = 524–9 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11836280 | doi = 10.1210/jc.87.2.524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khattab S, Mohsen IA, Foutouh IA, Ramadan A, Moaz M, Al-Inany H | title = Metformin reduces abortion in pregnant women with polycystic ovary syndrome | journal = Gynecological Endocrinology | volume = 22 | issue = 12 | pages = 680–4 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17162710 | doi = 10.1080/09513590601010508 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the quality of these studies has been questioned.&lt;ref name="RCOG-PCOS"&gt;{{cite web|last=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|title=Long-term consequences of polycystic ovarian syndrome|url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/GT33_LongTermPCOS.pdf|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20100710113119/http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/uploaded-files/GT33_LongTermPCOS.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-07-10|website=Green-top Guideline No. 27|publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists|accessdate=2 July 2013|date=December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metformin treatment in pregnancy has not been shown to be safe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lilja AE, Mathiesen ER | title = Polycystic ovary syndrome and metformin in pregnancy | journal = Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica | volume = 85 | issue = 7 | pages = 861–8 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16817087 | doi = 10.1080/00016340600780441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists also recommended against use of the drug to prevent miscarriage.&lt;ref name="RCOG-PCOS" /&gt; Thrombophilias or defects in coagulation and bleeding were once thought to be a risk in miscarriage but have been subsequently questioned.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=174}}
Severe cases of [[hypothyroidism]] increase the risk of miscarriage. The effect of milder cases of hypothyroidism on miscarriage rates has not been established. A condition called luteal phase defect (LPD) is a failure of the uterine lining to be fully prepared for pregnancy. This can keep a fertilized egg from implanting or result in miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/you-get-pregnant/trying-conceive/#4|title=Trying to conceive {{!}} womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' infection is associated with increased risk of [[preterm birth]] and miscarriage.&lt;ref name="LisRowhani-Rahbar2015"/&gt;

Infections can increase the risk of a miscarriage: rubella&amp;nbsp;(German measles), cytomegalovirus, bacterial vaginosis, HIV, chlamydia, gonorrhoea,&amp;nbsp;syphilis,&amp;nbsp;and malaria.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

===Immune status===
Autoimmunity is possible cause of recurrent or late-term miscarriages. In the case of an autoimmune-induced miscarriages the woman's body attacks the growing fetus or prevents normal pregnancy progression.&lt;ref name="CarpSelmi2012"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=The autoimmune bases of infertility and pregnancy loss|journal=J Autoimmun|type=Review|volume=38|issue=2–3|pages=J266–74|doi=10.1016/j.jaut.2011.11.016|pmid=22284905|vauthors=Carp HJ, Selmi C, Shoenfeld Y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2007|title=Female infertility due to abnormal autoimmunity: Frequently overlooked and greatly underappreciated.

===Anatomical defects and trauma===
Fifteen percent of women who have experienced three or more recurring miscarriages have some anatomical defect that prevents the pregnancy from being carried for the entire term.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=181}} The structure of the [[uterus]] has an effect on the ability to carry a child to term. Anatomical differences are common and can be congenital.

In some women, [[cervical incompetence]] or cervical insufficiency occurs with the inability of the cervix to stay closed during the entire pregnancy.&lt;ref name="American College of Obstetricians and 372–9"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It does not cause first trimester miscarriages. In the second trimester it is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. It is identified after a premature birth has occurred at about 16–18 weeks into the pregnancy.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=181}} During the second trimester, major trauma can result in a miscarriage.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=172}}

===Smoking===
{{See also|Smoking and pregnancy}}
Tobacco (cigarette) smokers have an increased risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; There is an increased risk regardless of which parent smokes, though the risk is higher when the gestational mother smokes.&lt;ref name="paternal smoking"/&gt;

===Morning sickness===
Nausea and vomiting of pregnancy (NVP, or [[morning sickness]]) are associated with a decreased risk. Several possible causes have been suggested for morning sickness but there is still no agreement.&lt;ref name="Kor2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koren|first1=G|title=Treating morning sickness in the United States--changes in prescribing are needed|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=December 2014|volume=211|issue=6|pages=602–6|pmid=25151184|doi=10.1016/j.ajog.2014.08.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; NVP may represent a defense mechanism which discourages the mother's ingestion of foods that are harmful to the fetus; according to this model, a lower frequency of miscarriage would be an expected consequence of the different food choices made by women experiencing NVP.&lt;ref name=Haviland2016&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FPgWDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA310&amp;dq=nausea+vomiting+pregnancy+defense+mechanism+2017&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjjj9q4yoveAhUKJMAKHbmoAnAQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=nausea%20vomiting%20pregnancy%20defense%20mechanism%202017&amp;f=false|title=Anthropology: The Human Challenge|last=Haviland|first=William A.|last2=Prins|first2=Harald E.

===Chemicals and occupational exposure===
Chemical and [[occupational exposure]]s may have some effect in pregnancy outcomes. A cause and effect relationship almost can never be established. Those chemicals that are implicated in increasing the risk for miscarriage are [[DDT]], [[lead]], [[formaldehyde]], [[arsenic]], [[benzene]] and [[ethylene oxide]]. [[Video display terminal]]s and ultrasound have not been found to have an effect on the rates of miscarriage. In dental offices where [[nitrous oxide]] is used with the absence of [[anesthetic gas scavenging equipment]], there is a greater risk of miscarriage. For women who work with cytotoxic [[antineoplastic chemotherapeutic agent]]s there is a small increased risk of miscarriage. No increased risk for [[cosmetologist]]s has been found.{{sfn|Hoffman|page=272}}

===Other===
Alcohol increases the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Progesterone has not been found to be effective in preventing miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Progestogen for preventing miscarriage; Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue = 10|last=Haas|first=David M|last2=Ramsey|first2=Patrick S|date=2013-10-31|year=|isbn = |pages=CD003511|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd003511.pub3|pmid = 24173668}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cocaine intoxication|Cocaine]] use increases the rate of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="x"/&gt; Some infections have been associated with miscarriage.

==Diagnosis==
In the case of blood loss, pain, or both, [[Obstetric ultrasonography|transvaginal ultrasound]] is performed.  If a viable intrauterine pregnancy is not found with ultrasound, blood tests (serial [[human chorionic gonadotropin|βHCG]] tests) can be performed to rule out ectopic pregnancy, which is a life-threatening situation.&lt;ref name="followHCG"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Condous G, Okaro E, Khalid A, Bourne T | title = Do we need to follow up complete miscarriages with serum human chorionic gonadotrophin levels? | journal = BJOG | volume = 112 | issue = 6 | pages = 827–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15924545 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2004.00542.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bmj&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://us.bestpractice.bmj.com/best-practice/monograph/666.html|title=Miscarriage|last=BMJ Best Practice|first=|date=|website=us.bestpractice.bmj.com|language=en|others=Ida Muslim, Jothi Doraiswamy, Acknowledgements|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If [[hypotension]], [[tachycardia]], and [[anemia]] are discovered, exclusion of an ectopic pregnancy is important.&lt;ref name = bmj/&gt;

A miscarriage may be confirmed by an [[obstetric ultrasound]] and by the examination of the passed tissue. When looking for microscopic [[pathology|pathologic]] symptoms, one looks for the [[products of conception]]. Microscopically, these include [[Chorionic villi|villi]], [[trophoblast]], fetal parts, and background gestational changes in the [[endometrium]]. When chromosomal abnormalities are found in more than one miscarriage, genetic testing of both parents may be done.&lt;ref name="RCOG-recurrent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/GTG17recurrentmiscarriage.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130705172612/https://www.rcog.org.uk/files/rcog-corp/GTG17recurrentmiscarriage.pdf |archive-date=July 5, 2013|title=The investigation and treatment of couples with recurrent first-trimester and second-trimester miscarriage |last=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) |date=April 2011 |publisher=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) |website=Green-top Guideline No. 17 |accessdate=2 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultrasound criteria===
A review article in [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] based on a consensus meeting of the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound in America (SRU) has suggested that miscarriage should be diagnosed only if any of the following criteria are met upon ultrasonography visualization:&lt;ref name="Doubilet2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doubilet PM, Benson CB, Bourne T, Blaivas M, Barnhart KT, Benacerraf BR, Brown DL, Filly RA, Fox JC, Goldstein SR, Kendall JL, Lyons EA, Porter MB, Pretorius DH, Timor-Tritsch IE | title = Diagnostic Criteria for Nonviable Pregnancy Early in the First Trimester | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 15 | pages = 1443–1451 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24106937 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra1302417 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
A threatened miscarriage describes any bleeding during pregnancy, prior to viability, that has yet to be assessed.. At investigation it may be found that the fetus remains viable and the pregnancy continues without further problems.{{Medical citation needed|date=November 2017}}

An [[Anembryonic gestation|anembryonic pregnancy]] (also called an "empty sac" or "blighted ovum") is a condition where the [[gestational sac]] develops normally, while the embryonic part of the pregnancy is either absent or stops growing very early. This accounts for approximately half of miscarriages. All other miscarriages are classified as embryonic miscarriages, meaning that there is an embryo present in the gestational sac. Half of embryonic miscarriages have [[aneuploidy]] (an abnormal number of chromosomes).&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;

An inevitable miscarriage occurs when the cervix has already dilated,&lt;ref name="isbn 0-07-144874-8"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Latha |last1=Stead |first2=S. Matthew |last2=Stead |first3=Matthew |last3=Kaufman|first4=Luis |last4=Suarez |title=First Aid for The Obstetrics and Gynecology Clerkship |publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York |year=2006 |page=138 |isbn=978-0-07-144874-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the fetus has yet to be expelled. This usually will progress to a complete miscarriage. The fetus may or may not have cardiac activity.

[[File:Complete miscarriage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Transvaginal ultrasonography]] after an episode of heavy bleeding in an intrauterine pregnancy that had been confirmed by a previous ultrasononography. There is some widening between the [[uterine wall]]s, but no sign of any [[gestational sac]], thus in this case being diagnostic of a complete miscarriage.]] A complete miscarriage is when all products of conception have been expelled; these may include the [[trophoblast]], [[chorionic villi]], [[gestational sac]], [[yolk sac]], and [[fetal pole]] ([[embryo]]); or later in pregnancy the [[fetus]], [[umbilical cord]], [[placenta]], amniotic fluid, and [[amniotic sac|amniotic membrane]]. The presence of a [[pregnancy test]] that is still positive as well as an empty uterus upon [[transvaginal ultrasonography]] does, however, fulfill the definition of [[pregnancy of unknown location]]. Therefore, there may be a need for follow-up pregnancy tests to ensure that there is no remaining pregnancy, including an ectopic pregnancy. [[File:Incomplete miscarriage.jpg|thumb|[[Transvaginal ultrasonography]], with some products of conception in the [[cervix]] (to the left in the image) and remnants of a [[gestational sac]] by the [[fundus of the uterus|fundus]] (to the right in the image), indicating an incomplete miscarriage.]] An incomplete miscarriage occurs when some [[products of conception]] have been passed, but some remains inside the uterus.&lt;ref name="MedlinePlus"&gt;{{cite web |author=MedlinePlus | authorlink =MedlinePlus | date = October 25, 2004 |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000904.htm | title =Abortion – incomplete | website=Medical Encyclopedia| accessdate =May 24, 2006 |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20060425090648/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000904.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an increased distance between the [[uterine wall]]s on transvaginal ultrasonography may also simply be an increased endometrial thickness and/or a [[polyp]].

{{anchor|missed}}[[File:Delayed or missed miscarriage at 13 weeks.gif|thumb|left|160px|A 13-week fetus without cardiac activity located in the uterus (delayed or missed miscarriage)]]A missed miscarriage is when the embryo or fetus has died, but a miscarriage has not yet occurred.  It is also referred to as delayed miscarriage, silent miscarriage, or missed abortion.&lt;ref name="Farquharson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutchon-1997"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hutchon DJ | title = Missed abortion versus delayed miscarriage | journal = British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology | volume = 104 | issue = 6 | pages = 753 | date = June 1997 | pmid = 9197887 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-0528.1997.tb11994.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Septic abortion|septic miscarriage]] occurs when the tissue from a missed or incomplete miscarriage becomes infected, which carries the risk of spreading infection ([[septicaemia]]) and can be fatal.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;

[[Recurrent miscarriage]] ("recurrent pregnancy loss" (RPL) or "habitual abortion") is the occurrence of multiple consecutive miscarriages; the exact number used to diagnose recurrent miscarriage varies.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt; If the proportion of pregnancies ending in miscarriage is 15% and assuming that miscarriages are independent events,&lt;ref name="rcog2003" /&gt; then the probability of two consecutive miscarriages is 2.25% and the probability of three consecutive miscarriages is 0.34%. The occurrence of recurrent pregnancy loss is 1%.&lt;ref name="rcog2003"&gt;{{cite web |author=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |authorlink=Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists |date=May 2003 |title=The investigation and treatment of couples with recurrent miscarriage |website=Green-top Guideline No. 17 |url=http://www.rcog.org.uk/womens-health/clinical-guidance/investigation-and-treatment-couples-recurrent-miscarriage-green-top- |accessdate=October 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104235744/http://www.rcog.org.uk/womens-health/clinical-guidance/investigation-and-treatment-couples-recurrent-miscarriage-green-top- |archivedate=January 4, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large majority (85%) of those who have had two miscarriages will conceive and carry normally afterward.

The physical symptoms of a miscarriage vary according to the length of pregnancy, though most miscarriages cause pain or cramping. The size of blood clots and pregnancy tissue that are passed become larger with longer gestations. After 13 weeks' gestation, there is a higher risk of placenta retention.&lt;ref name="ausbirth"&gt;{{cite web| date=October 2004| title=miscarriage| url=http://www.birth.com.au/Info.asp?class=6620&amp;page=13| accessdate=3 January 2014| author=Home page at www.birth.com.au| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201112940/http://www.birth.com.au/Info.asp?class=6620&amp;page=13| archivedate=December 1, 2008| df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Prevention of a miscarriage can sometimes be accomplished by decreasing risk factors.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Pre" /&gt; This may include good [[prenatal care]], avoiding drugs and alcohol, preventing infectious diseases, and avoiding x-rays.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Pre" /&gt; Identifying the cause of the miscarriage may help prevent future pregnancy loss, especially in cases of recurrent miscarriage. Often there is little a person can do to prevent a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="NIH2013Pre" /&gt; Vitamin supplementation before or during pregnancy has not been found to affect the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=|year=2016|title=Vitamin supplementation for preventing miscarriage|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=5|issue=5|pages=CD004073|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004073.pub4|pmid=27150280|vauthors=Balogun OO, da Silva Lopes K, Ota E, Takemoto Y, Rumbold A, Takegata M, Mori R|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modifiable risk factors===
Maintaining a healthy weight and good pre-natal care can reduce the risk of miscarriage.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Some risk factors can be minimized by avoiding the following:
*Smoking&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;&lt;ref name="paternal smoking"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
*Cocaine use&lt;ref name="x"/&gt;

*Drug abuse&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

==Management==
Women who miscarry early in their pregnancy usually do not require any subsequent medical treatment but they can benefit from support and counseling.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jeve"/&gt; Most early miscarriages will complete on their own; in other cases, medication treatment or aspiration of the products of conception can be used to remove remaining tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babycentre.co.uk/a1039515/understanding-early-miscarriage#ixzz2x52G1IYu |title=Understanding early miscarriage |date=January 2017 |accessdate=June 4, 2017 |publisher=BabyCenter, L.L.C. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905095051/https://www.babycentre.co.uk/a1039515/understanding-early-miscarriage#ixzz2x52G1IYu |archivedate=September 5, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[bed rest]] has been advocated to prevent miscarriage, this has not been found to be of benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Christina A.|last1=McCall|first2=David A.|last2=Grimes|first3=Anne Drapkin|last3=Lyerly|title="Therapeutic" bed rest in pregnancy: unethical and unsupported by data|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=1 June 2013|issn=1873-233X|pages=1305–1308|volume=121|issue=6|pmid=23812466|doi=10.1097/AOG.0b013e318293f12f}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hoffman|page = 176}} Those who are or who have experienced an abortion benefit from the use of careful medical language. Significant distress can often be managed by the ability of the clinician to clearly explain terms without suggesting that the woman or couple are somehow to blame.&lt;ref name="Chris2014"&gt;{{cite book|title=Recurrent pregnancy loss|last=Christiansen|first=Ole|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2014|isbn=9780470672945|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|pages=98–99|quote=It is important to bear in mind that some clinical terms can cause great distress and even anger.  It is not acceptable to use the term "abortion" for miscarriage, despite its historical clinical prevalence.  To the lay person, "abortion" means the elective termination of pregnancy and while they may have no theoretical objections to that procedure, they are likely to be distressed and even angered at its use in their situation.  "Miscarriage" (qualified by adjectives such as recurrent, delayed, early, late, etc.) is easily understood and well accepted.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence to support [[Rho(D) immune globulin]] after a spontaneous miscarriage is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karanth|first1=L|last2=Jaafar|first2=SH|last3=Kanagasabai|first3=S|last4=Nair|first4=NS|last5=Barua|first5=A|title=Anti-D administration after spontaneous miscarriage for preventing Rhesus alloimmunisation|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Mar 28, 2013|volume=3|issue=3|pages=CD009617|pmid=23543581|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009617.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, Rho(D) immune globulin is recommended in Rh-negative women after 12 weeks [[gestational age]] and before 12 weeks gestational age in those who need surgery or medication to complete the miscarriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Royal College of Obstetric and Gynecologists|title=The Use of Anti-D Immunoglobulin for Rhesus D Prophylaxis|url=https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg22antidjuly2013.pdf|accessdate=25 September 2014|page=5|date=March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141128192127/https://www.rcog.org.uk/globalassets/documents/guidelines/gtg22antidjuly2013.pdf|archivedate=November 28, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods===
No treatment is necessary for a diagnosis of complete miscarriage (so long as ectopic pregnancy is ruled out). In cases of an incomplete miscarriage, empty sac, or missed abortion there are three treatment options: watchful waiting, medical management, and surgical treatment. With no treatment ([[watchful waiting]]), most miscarriages (65–80%) will pass naturally within two to six weeks.&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kripke C | title = Expectant management vs. surgical treatment for miscarriage | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 74 | issue = 7 | pages = 1125–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17039747 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/1001/p1125.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140525195924/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2006/1001/p1125.html | archivedate = May 25, 2014 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This treatment avoids the possible side effects and complications of medications and surgery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tang OS, Ho PC | title = The use of misoprostol for early pregnancy failure | journal = Current Opinion in Obstetrics and Gynecology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 581–6 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17099326 | doi = 10.1097/GCO.0b013e32800feedb }}&lt;/ref&gt; but increases the risk of mild bleeding, need for unplanned surgical treatment, and incomplete miscarriage. Medical treatment usually consists of using [[misoprostol]] (a [[prostaglandin]]) to contract the uterus, expelling remaining tissue out of the cervix. This works within a few days in 95% of cases.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;  Vacuum aspiration or sharp curettage can be used, though vacuum aspiration is lower-risk and more common.&lt;ref name="afp" /&gt;

===Delayed and incomplete miscarriage===
In delayed or incomplete miscarriage, treatment depends on the amount of tissue remaining in the uterus. Treatment can include surgical removal of the tissue with [[vacuum aspiration]] or [[misoprostol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333519/|title=Surgery for Family Planning, Abortion, and Postabortion Care|last=Babigumira|first=Joseph B.|last2=Vlassoff|first2=Michael|last3=Ahimbisibwe|first3=Asa|last4=Stergachis|first4=Andy|date=2015-01-01|publisher=The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank|isbn=9781464803468|editor-last=Debas|editor-first=Haile T.|location=Washington (DC)|pmid=26741012|editor-last2=Donkor|editor-first2=Peter|editor-last3=Gawande|editor-first3=Atul|editor-last4=Jamison|editor-first4=Dean T.|editor-last5=Kruk|editor-first5=Margaret E.|editor-last6=Mock|editor-first6=Charles N.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170910181311/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK333519/|archivedate=September 10, 2017|df=mdy-all|doi=10.1596/978-1-4648-0346-8_ch7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies looking at the methods of anaesthesia for surgical management of incomplete miscarriage have not shown that any adaptation from normal practice is beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calvache|first1=JA|last2=Delgado-Noguera|first2=MF|last3=Lesaffre|first3=E|last4=Stolker|first4=RJ|title=Anaesthesia for evacuation of incomplete miscarriage|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=18 April 2012|issue=4|pages=CD008681|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008681.pub2|pmid=22513963}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some organizations recommend delaying sexual relations immediately after a miscarriage to prevent [[infection]].&lt;ref name="misorg" /&gt; However, there is not sufficient evidence for the routine use of antibiotic to try to avoid infection in incomplete abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=May|first1=W|last2=Gülmezoglu|first2=AM|last3=Ba-Thike|first3=K|title=Antibiotics for incomplete abortion|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=17 October 2007|issue=4|pages=CD001779|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001779.pub2|pmid=17943756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women are able to begin planning their next pregnancy after a few weeks of having the miscarriage. For others, planning another pregnancy can be difficult.&lt;ref name="uk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="misorg"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.miscarriageassociation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Thinking-about-another-pregnancy.pdf | title = Thinking About Another Pregnancy | publisher = Miscarriage Association | accessdate = 4 September 2017 | date = 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170905051002/https://www.miscarriageassociation.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Thinking-about-another-pregnancy.pdf | archivedate = September 5, 2017 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some facilities acknowledge the loss. Parents can name and hold their infant. They may be given mementos such as photos and footprints. Some conduct a funeral or memorial service.

===Subsequent pregnancies===
Some parents want to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The decision of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and want to know about the risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one [[menstrual cycle]] before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage or [[molar pregnancy]], or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.&lt;ref name="misorg"/&gt;

The risks of having another miscarriage vary according to the cause. The risk of having another miscarriage after a molar pregnancy is very low. The risk of another miscarriage is highest after the third miscarriage. Pre-conception care is available in some locales.&lt;ref name="misorg" /&gt;

===Later cardiovascular disease===
There is a significant association between miscarriage and later development of [[coronary artery disease]], but not of [[cerebrovascular disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oliver-Williams CT, Heydon EE, Smith GC, Wood AM | title = Miscarriage and future maternal cardiovascular disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Heart | volume = 99 | issue = 22 | pages = 1636–1644 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23539554 | pmc = 3812894 | doi = 10.1136/heartjnl-2012-303237 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hoffman|page = 172}}

==Epidemiology==
Among women who know they are pregnant, the miscarriage rate is roughly 10% to 20%, while rates among all [[Fertilisation|fertilized zygotes]] are around 30% to 50%.&lt;ref name="John2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NIH2013Epi" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name="jeve" /&gt; A 2012 review found the risk of miscarriage between 5 and 20 weeks from 11% to 22%.&lt;ref name=Avalos-2012 /&gt; Up to the 13th week of pregnancy, the risk of miscarriage each week was around 2%, dropping to 1% in week 14 and reducing slowly between 14 and 20 weeks.&lt;ref name=Avalos-2012 /&gt;

The precise rate is not known because a large number of miscarriages occur before pregnancies become established and before the woman is aware they are pregnant.&lt;ref name="Avalos-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ammon Avalos L, Galindo C, Li DK | title = A systematic review to calculate background miscarriage rates using life table analysis | journal = Birth Defects Research. Part A, Clinical and Molecular Teratology | volume = 94 | issue = 6 | pages = 417–23 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22511535 | doi = 10.1002/bdra.23014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, those with bleeding in early pregnancy may seek medical care more often than those not experiencing bleeding.&lt;ref name="Avalos-2012" /&gt; Although some studies attempt to account for this by recruiting women who are planning pregnancies and testing for very early pregnancy, they still are not representative of the wider population.&lt;ref name="Avalos-2012" /&gt;

The prevalence of miscarriage increases with the age of both parents.&lt;ref name=Avalos-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Andersen&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nybo Andersen AM, Wohlfahrt J, Christens P, Olsen J, Melbye M | title = Maternal age and fetal loss: Population based register linkage study | journal = BMJ | volume = 320 | issue = 7251 | pages = 1708–12 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10864550 | pmc = 27416 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.320.7251.1708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kleinhaus K, Perrin M, Friedlander Y, Paltiel O, Malaspina D, Harlap S | title = Paternal Age and Spontaneous Abortion | journal = Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology | volume = 108 | issue = 2 | pages = 369–77 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16880308 | doi = 10.1097/01.AOG.0000224606.26514.3a }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Slama R, Bouyer J, Windham G, Fenster L, Werwatz A, Swan SH | title = Influence of Paternal Age on the Risk of Spontaneous Abortion | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 161 | issue = 9 | pages = 816–23 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15840613 | doi = 10.1093/aje/kwi097 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Danish register-based study where the prevalence of miscarriage was 11%, the prevalence rose from 9% at 22 years of age to 84% by 48 years of age.&lt;ref name=Andersen /&gt;{{Update inline|date=October 2017}} Another, later study in 2013 found that when either parent was over the age of 40, the rate of known miscarriages doubled.&lt;ref name=Will2013 /&gt;

In 2010, 50,000 inpatient admissions for miscarriage occurred in the UK.&lt;ref name="radford" /&gt;

==Terminology==
Most affected women and family members refer to miscarriage as the loss of a baby, rather than an embryo or fetus, and healthcare providers are expected to respect and use the language that the person chooses.&lt;ref name="Chris2014" /&gt; Clinical terms can suggest blame, increase distress, and even cause anger. Terms that are known to cause distress in those experiencing miscarriage include:

* ''abortion'' (including ''spontaneous abortion'') rather than miscarriage, 
* ''habitual aborter'' rather than a woman experiencing [[recurrent pregnancy loss]], 
* ''products of conception'' rather than [[baby]], 
* ''blighted ovum'' rather than early pregnancy loss or delayed miscarriage, 
* ''cervical incompetence'' rather than [[cervical weakness]], and 
* ''evacuation of retained products of conception'' (ERPC) rather than [[surgical management of miscarriage]].&lt;ref name="Chris2014" /&gt;

''Pregnancy loss'' is a broad term that describes miscarriage, ectopic and molar pregnancies.&lt;ref name="Chris2014" /&gt; The term ''[[fetal death]]'' applies variably in different countries and contexts, sometimes incorporating weight, and gestational age from 16 weeks in Norway, 20 weeks in the US and Australia, 24 weeks in the UK to 26 weeks in Italy and Spain.&lt;ref name="Mohangoo-2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mohangoo AD, Blondel B, Gissler M, Velebil P, Macfarlane A, Zeitlin J | title = International comparisons of fetal and neonatal mortality rates in high-income countries: should exclusion thresholds be based on birth weight or gestational age? | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = e64869 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23700489 | pmc = 3658983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0064869 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...864869M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIHW-2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Li|first=Z|title=Australia's Mothers and Babies 2010|url=http://www.aihw.gov.au/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=60129542372|website=Perinatal statistics series no. 27.

==History==

==Society and culture==
Society's reactions to miscarriage changed over time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;In the early 20th century, the focus was on the mother's physical health and the difficulties and disabilities that miscarriage could produce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Other reactions, such as the expense of medical treatments and relief at ending an unwanted pregnancy, were also heard.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the 1940s and 1950s, people were more likely to express relief, not because the miscarriage ended an unwanted or mistimed pregnancy, but because people believed that miscarriages were primarily caused by birth defects, and miscarrying meant that the family would not raise a child with disabilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The dominant attitude in the mid-century was that a miscarriage, although temporarily distressing, was a blessing in disguise for the family, and that another pregnancy and a healthier baby would soon follow, especially if women trusted physicians and reduced their anxieties.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Media articles were illustrated with pictures of babies, and magazine articles about miscarriage ended by introducing the healthy baby—usually a boy—that had shortly followed it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Beginning in the 1980s, miscarriage in the US was primarily framed in terms of the individual woman's personal emotional reaction, and especially her grief over a tragic outcome.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The subject was portrayed in the media with images of an empty crib or an isolated, grieving woman, and stories about miscarriage were published in general-interest media outlets, not just [[women's magazines]] or health magazines.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Family members were encouraged to grieve, to memorialize their losses through funerals and other rituals, and to think of themselves as being parents.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;This shift to recognizing these emotional responses was partly due to medical and political successes, which created an expectation that pregnancies are typically planned and safe, and to women's demands that their emotional reactions no longer be dismissed by the medical establishments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;It also reinforces the [[Pro-Life movement|pro-life movement's]] belief that human life begins at conception or early in pregnancy, and that [[Pronatalism|motherhood is a desirable life goal]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The modern one-size-fits-all model of grief does not fit every woman's experience, and an expectation to [[Performativity|perform]] grief creates unnecessary burdens for some women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The reframing of miscarriage as a private emotional experience brought less awareness of miscarriage and a sense of silence around the subject, especially compared to the public discussion of miscarriage during campaigns for access to birth control during the early 20th century, or the public campaigns to prevent miscarriages, stillbirths, and infant deaths by reducing industrial pollution during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/04/the-history-of-talking-about-miscarriage.html|title=The History of Talking About Miscarriage|last=Blei|first=Daniela|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-04-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In places where induced abortion is illegal or carries social stigma, suspicion may surround miscarriage, complicating an already sensitive issue.

In the 1960s, the use of the word ''miscarriage'' in Britain (instead of ''spontaneous abortion'') occurred after changes in legislation.

Developments in ultrasound technology (in the early 1980s) allowed them to identify earlier miscarriages.&lt;ref name="pmid23429567" /&gt;

According to French statutes, an infant born before the age of viability, determined to be 28 weeks, is not registered as a 'child'. If birth occurs after this, the infant is granted a certificate that allows women who have given birth to a stillborn child, to have a symbolic record of that child. This certificate can include a registered and given name with the purpose of allowing a funeral and acknowledgement of the event.&lt;ref&gt;Communiqué de presse de [[Rachida Dati]], Garde des Sceaux, ministre de la Justice et de [[Roselyne Bachelot|Roselyne Bachelot-Narquin]], ministre de la Santé, de la Jeunesse, des Sports et de la Vie associative, « Possibilité de demande d’un acte d’enfant sans vie », 22 août 2008, [http://www.sante.gouv.fr/possibilite-de-demande-d-un-acte-d-enfant-sans-vie.html lire en ligne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.service-public.fr/|title=Accueil Particuliers {{!}} service-public.fr|website=www.service-public.fr|language=fr|access-date=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Décret n°74-449 du 15 mai 1974 relatif au livret de famille et à l'information des futurs époux sur le droit de la famille - Article 9|date=15 May 1974|url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexteArticle.do?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006285245&amp;cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000328986|accessdate=2017-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
{{anchor|In animals}}
Miscarriage occurs in all animals that experience pregnancy, though in such contexts it is more commonly referred to as a "spontaneous abortion" (the two terms are synonymous). There are a variety of known risk factors in non-human animals. For example, in sheep, miscarriage may be caused by crowding through doors, or being chased by dogs.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, James.

The national '''Museum of World Culture''' ({{lang-sv|Världskulturmuseet}}) opened in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, in 2004. It is a part of the public authority [[Swedish National Museums of World Cultures]] and builds on the collections of the former [[Göteborgs Etnografiska Museum]] that closed down in the year 2000. Its aim is to interpret the subject of [[world culture]] in an interdisciplinary way. The museum is situated next to the [[Universeum]] science centre and the amusement park [[Liseberg]], and close to [[Korsvägen]].&lt;ref name=sfv&gt;{{cite web|title=Världskulturmuseet, Göteborg|url=http://www.sfv.se/sv/fastigheter/sverige/vastra-gotalands-lan-o/varldskulturmuseet-i-goteborg/|website=www.sfv.se|publisher=[[National Property Board of Sweden]]|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
"''The museum interprets the concept of world culture in a dynamic and open-ended manner. On the one hand, various cultures are incorporating impulses from each other and becoming more alike. On the other hand, local, national, ethnic and gender differences are shaping much of that process. World culture is not only about communication, reciprocity, and interdependence, but the specificity, concretion and uniqueness of each and every individual.''" (From the background info on the museums homepage.)

The opening exhibitions of the museum were:
* No Name Fever: [[AIDS]] in the age of [[globalization]]
* Horizons: Voices from a global [[Africa]]
* Sister of Dreams: People and [[Mythology|myths]] of the Orinoco
* Fred Wilson: Site unseen - Dwellings of the Demons
* 390 m2 [[Spirituality]]

== Architecture ==
[[Image:Göteborg Museum of World Culture grand stairs.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The grand stairs in the atrium (Fotograf: [[Hélène Binet]])]]
The cement and glass building, located on a slope leading up to the Liseberg amusement park, is graceful, compact and modernistic. Its four-storey glass atrium looks out on mountains and woods.&lt;ref name=sfv /&gt;

The exhibition halls are in the closed part of the building, facing Södra vägen road. The upper storeys hang freely {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} over a footpath. A {{convert|43|m|ft|abbr=on}} long section of a display window provides passers-by with a view straight into the largest exhibition hall.&lt;ref name=sfv /&gt;

The architects behind the museum, who were chosen after an international competition, were the French-Cuban-English couple Cécile Brisac and Edgar Gonzalez of Brisac Gonzalez Architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of World Culture, Gothenburg|url=http://www.brisacgonzalez.com/projects/mwc/mwc01.html|website=www.brisacgonzalez.com|publisher=Brisac Gonzalez|accessdate=29 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919025144/http://www.brisacgonzalez.com/projects/mwc/mwc01.html|archivedate=19 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
In February 2005 the museum decided to remove the painting "[[Scène d'Amour]]" by [[Louzla Darabi]]. The painting was part of a temporary exhibition about [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], and depicted a man and a woman having sexual intercourse. The artist and the curator had received numerous death threats from Muslims saddened and frustrated over the [[Koran]] quotations which were featured in a corner of the painting. Some threats were telling the artist to "learn from the Netherlands", referring to the murder of van Gogh and threats against Hirsi Ali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressen.se/index.jsp?a=236913|title=Dödshot stoppar kärlekstavlan |trans-title=Death threat stops love painting|last=Lilja|first=Mats|publisher=[[Expressen]]|website=www.expressen.se|date=3 February 2005|language=Swedish|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Moonfromoakland04052006.jpg|thumb|The [[Moon]] is the most often viewed major object in the night sky, while sometimes visible during [[daytime]].]]
[[File:Flammarion.jpg|thumb|The [[Flammarion engraving]], Paris 1888]]

The term '''night sky''', usually associated with [[astronomy]] from [[Earth]], refers to the [[night]]time appearance of [[astronomical object|celestial objects]] like [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, and the [[Moon]], which are visible in a clear [[sky]] between [[sunset]] and [[sunrise]], when the [[Sun]] is below the [[horizon]].

Natural light sources in a night sky include [[moonlight]], [[starlight]], and [[airglow]], depending on location and timing. [[Aurora]]e light up the skies above the [[polar circle]]s. Occasionally, a large [[coronal mass ejection]] from the Sun or simply high levels of [[solar wind]] may extend the phenomenon toward the [[Equator]].&lt;ref name="Northern Lights"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Yukon |first1=Northwestel |title=Aurora Borealis Explained |url=http://www.northernlightscentre.ca/northernlights.html |publisher=Northern Lights Centre |accessdate=2015-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The night sky and studies of it have a historical place in both ancient and modern cultures. In the past, for instance, [[farmer]]s have used the status of the night sky as a [[calendar]] to determine when to [[agriculture|plant crops]]. Many cultures have drawn [[constellation]]s between [[star]]s in the sky, using them in association with [[legend]]s and [[mythology]] about their [[deity|deities]].

The [[history of astrology|anciently developed]] belief of [[astrology]] is generally based on the belief that relationships between heavenly bodies influence or convey information about events on Earth. The ''scientific'' study of celestial objects visible at night takes place in the science of [[observational astronomy]].



The visibility of celestial objects in the night sky is affected by [[light pollution]]. The presence of the Moon in the night sky has historically hindered astronomical observation by increasing the amount of [[sky brightness|ambient brightness]]. With the advent of artificial light sources, however, light pollution has been a growing problem for viewing the night sky. [[Optical filter]]s and modifications to light fixtures can help to alleviate this problem, but for optimal views, both professional and [[amateur astronomy|amateur astronomers]] seek locations far from [[urban area|urban]] [[skyglow]].

== Brightness ==
{{Main|Sky brightness}}

[[File:Starry Night at La Silla.jpg|thumb|The [[Milky Way]] is brighter in the Southern Hemisphere than in the North. (Photo taken at [[La Silla Observatory]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Starry Night at La Silla|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1333a/|accessdate=20 August 2013|newspaper=ESO Picture of the Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]

The fact that the sky is not completely dark at night, even in the absence of moonlight and city lights, can be easily observed, since if the sky were absolutely dark, one would not be able to see the silhouette of an object against the sky.

The intensity of the sky varies greatly over the day and the primary cause differs as well. During daytime when the sun is above the horizon direct scattering of sunlight ([[Rayleigh scattering]]) is the overwhelmingly dominant source of light. In twilight, the period of time between sunset and sunrise, the situation is more complicated and a further differentiation is required. Twilight is divided in three segments according to how far the sun is below the horizon in segments of 6°.

After sunset the [[civil twilight]] sets in, and ends when the sun drops more than 6° below the horizon. This is followed by the [[nautical twilight]], when the sun reaches heights of -6° and -12°, after which comes the [[astronomical twilight]] defined as the period from -12° to -18°. When the sun drops more than 18° below the horizon the sky generally attains its minimum brightness.

Several sources can be identified as the source of the intrinsic brightness of the sky, namely [[airglow]],  indirect scattering of sunlight, scattering of starlight, and artificial [[light pollution]].

Depending on local sky cloud cover, pollution, humidity, and light pollution levels, the stars visible to the unaided naked eye appear as hundreds, thousands or tens of thousands of white pinpoints of light in an otherwise near black sky together with some faint nebulae or clouds of light .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/ast99/ast99238.htm |title=Number of Stars in the Sky |last1=Hawley |work=NEWTON Ask A Scientist |publisher=US Department of Energy |accessdate=October 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ancient times the stars were often assumed to be equidistant on a dome above the earth because they are much too far away for [[stereopsis]] to offer any depth cues.  Visible stars range in color from blue (hot) to red (cold), but with such small points of faint light, most look white because they stimulate the [[rod cell]]s without triggering the [[cone cell]]s.  If it is particularly dark and a particularly faint celestial object is of interest, [[averted vision]] may be helpful.

The stars of the night sky cannot be counted unaided because they are so numerous and there is no way to track which have been counted and which have not.  Further complicating the count, fainter stars may appear and disappear depending on exactly where the observer is looking.  The result is an impression of an extraordinarily vast star field.

Because [[stargazing]] is best done from a dark place away from city lights, dark [[adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] is important to achieve and maintain.  It takes several minutes for eyes to adjust to the darkness necessary for seeing the most stars, and surroundings on the ground are hard to discern.  A red [[flashlight]] (torch) can be used to illuminate star charts, telescope parts, and the like without undoing the dark adaptation.  (See [[Purkinje effect]]).

=== Constellations ===
There are no markings on the night sky, though there exist many [[star chart|sky maps]] to aid stargazers in identifying [[constellation]]s and other celestial objects.  Constellations are prominent because their stars tend to be brighter than other nearby stars in the sky.  Different cultures have created different groupings of constellations based on differing interpretations of the more-or-less random patterns of dots in the sky.  Constellations were identified without regard to distance to each star, but instead as if they were all dots on a dome.

[[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is among the most prominent and recognizable constellations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~dolan/constellations/constellations/Orion.html |title=Orion |first=Chris |last=Dolan |accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Big Dipper]] (which has a wide variety of other names) is helpful for navigation in the northern hemisphere because it points to [[Polaris]], the north star.

The [[pole star]]s are special because they are approximately in line with the Earth's axis of rotation so they appear to stay in one place while the other stars rotate around them through the course of a night (or a year).

=== Planets ===
[[Planet]]s, named for the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for "wanderer," process through the star field a little each day, executing loops with time scales dependent on the length of the planet's year or orbital period around solar system.  Planets, to the naked eye, appear as points of light in the sky with variable brightness. Planets shine due to sunlight reflecting or scattering from the planets' surface or atmosphere. Thus the relative sun-planet-earth positions determine the planet's brightness. With a telescope or good binoculars, the planets appear as discs demonstrating finite size, and it is possible to observe orbiting moons which cast shadows onto the host planet's surface. [[Venus]] is the most prominent planet, often called the "morning star" or "evening star" because it is brighter than the stars and often the only "star" visible near sunrise or sunset, depending on its location in its orbit. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] are also visible to the naked eye.

=== The Moon ===
Earth's [[Moon]] is a grey disc in the sky with cratering visible to the naked eye.  It spans, depending on its exact location, 29-33 [[minute of arc|arcminutes]] - which is about the size of a thumbnail at arm's length, and is readily identified.  Over 28 days, the moon goes through a full cycle of [[lunar phase]]s.  People can generally identify phases within a few days by looking at the moon.  Unlike stars and most planets, the light reflected from the moon is bright enough to be seen during the day. (Venus can sometimes be seen even after sunrise.)

Some of the most spectacular moons come during the full moon phase near sunset or sunrise.  The moon on the horizon benefits from the [[moon illusion]] which makes it appear larger.  The light reflected from the moon traveling through the atmosphere also colors the moon orange and/or red.

=== Comets ===
[[Comet]]s come to the night sky only rarely.  Comets are illuminated by the sun, and their tails extend away from the sun.  A comet with visible tail is quite unusual - a [[great comet]] appears about once a decade.  They tend to be  visible only shortly before sunrise or after sunset because those are the times they are close enough to the sun to show a tail.

=== Clouds===
[[Cloud]]s obscure the view of other objects in the sky, though varying thicknesses of cloudcover have differing effects.  A very thin [[cirrus cloud]] in front of the moon might produce a rainbow-colored ring around the moon.  Stars and planets are too small or dim to take on this effect, and are instead only dimmed (often to the point of invisibility).  Thicker cloudcover obscures celestial objects entirely, making the sky black or reflecting city lights back down.  Clouds are often close enough to afford some depth perception, though they are hard to see without moonlight or light pollution.

=== Other objects ===
{{wide image|Deathvalleysky nps big.jpg|500px|The [[Milky Way]] can be seen as a very large streak or arc across the night sky if the [[visibility]] conditions are good enough. This [[panoramic]] photo was taken at [[Death Valley]].}}

[[File:Where Heaven and Earth Collide.jpg|thumb|The [[Milky Way]] contains billions of stars, arranged in two strikingly different structures: [[Milky Way#Halo|halo]] and [[Disc galaxy|disc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Heaven and Earth Collide|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1635a/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On clear dark nights in unpolluted areas, when the moon is thin or below the horizon, the [[Milky Way]], a band of what looks like white dust, can be seen.

The [[Magellanic Clouds]] of the southern sky are easily mistaken to be Earth-based clouds (hence the name) but are in fact collections of stars found outside the Milky Way known as [[Dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]].

[[Zodiacal light]] is a glow that appears near the points where the sun rises and sets, and is caused by sunlight interacting with [[Interplanetary dust cloud|interplanetary dust]].

Shortly after sunset and before sunrise, artificial [[satellite]]s often look like stars—similar in brightness and size—but move relatively quickly. Those that fly in [[low Earth orbit]] cross the sky in a couple of minutes. Some satellites, including [[space debris]], appear to blink or have a periodic fluctuation in brightness because they are rotating. [[Satellite flare|Satellite flares]] can appear brighter than [[Venus]], with notable examples including the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) and [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium Satellites]].

[[Meteor]]s (commonly known as shooting stars) streak across the sky very infrequently. During a [[meteor shower]], they may average one a minute at irregular intervals, but otherwise their appearance is a random surprise. The occasional meteor will make a bright, fleeting streak across the sky, and they can be very bright in comparison to the night sky.

[[Aircraft]] are also visible at night, distinguishable at a distance from other objects because their lights blink.

{{see also|Agriculture in the United Kingdom#Manure, nitrogen and Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZ)}}
A '''nitrate vulnerable zone''' is a [[conservation designation]] of the [[Environment Agency]] for areas of land that drain into [[nitrate]] polluted waters, or waters which could become polluted by nitrates. Nitrate vulnerable zones were introduced by the UK government in response to the EU mandate that all EU countries must reduce the nitrate in drinking water to a maximum of 50&amp;nbsp;mg/l. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/envir/nitrates/index_en.htm|title=Agriculture and nitrates -      Agriculture and rural development|website=ec.europa.eu|access-date=2016-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The NVZs covered large areas of land that had been identified as exceeding or being at risk of exceeding 50&amp;nbsp;mg NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/l. 

NVZs have fairly relaxed rules on fertiliser application involving not fertilising at certain times of the year (during the winter when runoff is greatest and uptake by plants at a minimum), reducing the amount of fertiliser used, and changing the times when animal waste is applied to the land (waste must be held in tanks over the period when it cannot be applied). Farmers who do not adhere to these restrictions can be fined by the Government. The restrictions are within the guidelines of GAP (Good Agricultural Practice) and so the farmers are expected to adhere without receiving any subsidies. 

These NVZs are part of the scheme involved in NSAs (nitrate sensitive areas) which are assigned on a farm scale basis and have much more stringent rules on nitrate application and also include remuneration for profits lost from keeping to the rules.

The '''Nootka Fault''' is an [[Active fault|active]] [[transform fault]] running southwest from [[Nootka Island]], near [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].

==Geology==
The Nootka Fault lies between the [[Explorer Plate]] in the north and [[Juan de Fuca Plate]] in south. These are remnants of the once vast [[Farallon Plate]]. The fault is at the [[triple junction]] of the [[North American Plate|North American]], [[Explorer Plate|Explorer]], and [[Juan de Fuca plate]]s.

'''Philip Percy Cooper Drabble''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (13 May 1914 &amp;ndash; 29 July 2007) was an [[England|English]] [[wikt:countryman|countryman]], [[author]] and [[television presenter]]. Brought up in the [[Black Country]], he later lived in – and wrote mostly about – the countryside of north [[Worcestershire]] and at [[Abbots Bromley]] in East [[Staffordshire]], where he created a [[nature reserve]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Drabble was an only child, whose mother died when he was young.&lt;ref name="DogsLife"&gt;''It's a Dog's Life''&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a [[General practitioner|GP]] and they lived in a terraced house in [[Bloxwich]]. He began work as a factory lad and rose to the board of [[Salter Housewares|Salters]] and membership of the management board of the Midland Engineering Employers Association.

In 1947, he made his first radio broadcast, and in 1952 his first television appearance. At the age of 47 he became a full-time writer, and he and his wife Jess purchased a derelict [[folly]]-styled cottage and {{convert|90|acres|ha}} of neglected [[ancient woodland]] in [[Abbots Bromley]], [[Staffordshire]], a remnant of the [[Needwood Forest]].

===''One Man and His Dog'' and later life===

[[File:Pub sign One Man and His Dog.jpg|thumb|upright|Pub sign]]

Drabble was best known as presenter of the long-running TV series ''[[One Man and His Dog]]'', in which he commentated on [[sheepdog trial]]s for 17 years from 1976 to 1993. At its peak the BBC programme attracted more than 8 million viewers and even the Queen was a fan, asking Drabble for advice after her liberty budgies were attacked by hawks at Windsor. Declared [[Midlander of the Year]] in 1992, and made OBE in the year he retired from the programme, he announced in 1993 that it had become "a bit boring watching dogs chase stroppy sheep round a field."

A [[pub]] very near Drabble's former home in Bloxwich is named "One Man and His Dog" in his honour.

===Later life===
Drabble, who also wrote a newspaper column for the [[Express &amp; Star]], took few holidays, travelled abroad only a couple of times, and was proud to have never lived more than 20 miles from his place of birth.

He and his wife turned the woodland they had bought and lived next to into the [[Goat Lodge Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;Drabble, Phil - ''One Man and his Conservation Area'' - 1992, {{ISSN|1367-983X}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a fight with [[Center Parcs]] who wanted to build a centre just outside its borders, it became a recognised [[Site of Special Scientific Interest]].

Predeceased eighteen months earlier by his wife,&lt;ref name="will"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1021652/Phil-One-Man-And-His-Dog-Drabble-leaves-1m-fortune-secretary-loved-like-daughter.html|title=Phil 'One Man And His Dog' Drabble leaves £1m fortune to the secretary he loved like a daughter|author=Phillips, Rhodri|publisher=Daily Mail|date=24 May 2008|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drabble died at his home in Abbots Bromley on 29 July 2007, at the age of 93.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = BBC presenter Phil Drabble dies | publisher = BBC News | date = 2007-07-30| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/6922526.stm | accessdate = 2007-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having never had any children, he left the majority of his £1,013,523 estate to his PA of 25 years, Ruth Froggatt.&lt;ref name="will" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47096">A '''renewable resource''' is a [[natural resource]] which replenishes to overcome [[resource depletion]] caused by usage and consumption, either through biological reproduction or other naturally recurring processes in a finite amount of time in a human time scale. Renewable resources are a part of Earth's natural environment and the largest components of its [[Ecosphere (ecology)|ecosphere]]. A positive life cycle assessment is a key indicator of a resource's sustainability.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Management for a Small Planet" by Jean Garner Stead and W. Edward Stead, M.E.

Definitions of renewable resources may also include agricultural production, as in [[sustainable agriculture]] and to an extent [[water resources]].&lt;ref name="What are Renewable Resources"&gt;[http://www.oas.org/dsd/publications/Unit/oea79e/ch05.htm What are “Renewable Resources”?], by A.

==Air, food and water==

===Water resources===

{{Main article|Water resources}}

[[Water]] can be considered a ''renewable'' material when carefully controlled usage, treatment, and release are followed. If not, it would become a non-renewable resource at that location. For example, [[groundwater]] is usually removed from an [[aquifer]] at a rate much greater than its very slow natural recharge, and so groundwater is considered non-renewable. Removal of water from the pore spaces may cause permanent compaction ([[subsidence]]) that cannot be renewed. 97.5% of the water on the Earth is salt water, and 3% is [[fresh water]]; slightly over two thirds of this is frozen in [[glacier]]s and [[Polar climate|polar]] [[ice cap]]s.&lt;ref name="USGS dist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ga.water.usgs.gov/edu/waterdistribution.html|title=Earth's water distribution|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining unfrozen freshwater is found mainly as groundwater, with only a small fraction (0.008%) present above ground or in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Scientific Facts on Water: State of the Resource| publisher=GreenFacts Website | accessdate=2008-01-31 | url= http://www.greenfacts.org/en/water-resources/index.htm#2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Water pollution]] is one of the main concerns regarding water resources. It is estimated that 22% of worldwide water is used in industry.&lt;ref name="WBCSD Water Facts &amp; Trends"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA |title=WBCSD Water Facts &amp; Trends |date= |accessdate=2009-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301011840/http://www.wbcsd.org/includes/getTarget.asp?type=d&amp;id=MTYyNTA |archivedate=2012-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Major industrial users include hydroelectric dams, [[Electricity generation#Other generation methods|thermoelectric power plants]] (which use water for cooling), [[ore]] and [[Petroleum|oil]] refineries (which use water in chemical processes) and manufacturing plants (which use water as a solvent).

[[Desalination]] of seawater is considered a renewable source of water, although reducing its dependence on fossil fuel energy is needed for it to be fully renewable.&lt;ref name=LowCDesal&gt;{{cite web | last=Lienhard | first=John H. | last2=Thiel | first2=Gregory P. | last3=Warsinger | first3=David M. | last4=Banchik | first4=Leonardo D. | title=Low Carbon Desalination: Status and Research, Development, and Demonstration Needs, Report of a workshop conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in association with the Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance | publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology | date=2016-12-08 | url=http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/105755 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non agricultural food===
[[File:Alaska wild berries.jpg|thumb|right|Alaska wild "berries" from the [[Innoko National Wildlife Refuge]] - Renewable Resources]]
Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212568/food Encyclopædia Britannica definition]&lt;/ref&gt; Most food has its origin in renewable resources. Food is obtained directly from plants and animals.

Hunting may not be the first source of meat in the modernised world, but it is still an important and essential source for many rural and remote groups. It is also the sole source of feeding for wild carnivores.&lt;ref&gt;Mammals: Carnivores. Duane E. Ullrey. Encyclopedia of Animal Science.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable agriculture===
{{main article|Sustainable agriculture}}
The phrase [[sustainable agriculture]] was coined by Australian agricultural scientist [[Gordon McClymont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rural Science Graduates Association |year=2002 |url=http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html |title={{sic|In Memo|rium|hide=y|expected=In Memoriam}}&amp;nbsp;— Former Staff and Students of Rural Science at UNE |publisher=[[University of New England (Australia)|University of New England]] |accessdate=21 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606220152/http://agbu.une.edu.au/~aaabg/rsga/im.html |archivedate=6 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been defined as "an integrated system of plant and animal production practices having a site-specific application that will last over the long term".&lt;ref&gt;Gold, M. (July 2009). [http://www.nal.usda.gov/afsic/pubs/agnic/susag.shtml What is Sustainable Agriculture?]. United States Department of Agriculture, Alternative Farming Systems Information Center.&lt;/ref&gt; Expansion of agricultural land reduces [[biodiversity]] and contributes to [[deforestation]]. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations estimates that in coming decades, cropland will continue to be lost to industrial and urban development, along with reclamation of wetlands, and conversion of forest to cultivation, resulting in the [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] and increased [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4252e/y4252e14.htm |title=FAO World Agriculture towards 2015/2030 |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |year=2003 |accessdate=2013-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Polyculture.JPG|thumb|250px|Polyculture practices in [[Andhra Pradesh]]]]
Although [[air]] and [[sunlight]] are available everywhere on [[Earth]], [[Agriculture|crops]] also depend on [[soil]] [[nutrients]] and the availability of [[water resources|water]]. [[Monoculture]] is a method of growing only one crop at a time in a given field, which can damage land and cause it to become either unusable or suffer from reduced [[Crop yield|yields]]. Monoculture can also cause the build-up of [[pathogen]]s and pests that target one specific species. The [[Great Irish Famine|Great Irish Famine (1845–1849)]] is a well-known example of the dangers of monoculture.

[[Crop rotation]] and [[shifting cultivation|long-term crop rotations]] confer the replenishment of nitrogen through the use of [[green manure]] in sequence with cereals and other crops, and can improve [[soil structure]] and [[fertility (soil)|fertility]] by alternating deep-rooted and shallow-rooted plants. Other methods to combat lost soil nutrients are returning to natural cycles that annually flood cultivated lands (returning lost nutrients indefinitely) such as the [[Flooding of the Nile]], the long-term use of [[biochar]], and use of crop and livestock [[landrace]]s that are adapted to less than ideal conditions such as pests, drought, or lack of nutrients.

Agricultural practices are the single greatest contributor to the global increase in [[Erosion|soil erosion]] rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authors=Committee on 21st Century Systems Agriculture|title=Toward Sustainable Agricultural Systems in the 21st Century|publisher=National Academies Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-309-14896-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wdm4qMW1azgC&amp;pg=PT88}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that "more than a thousand million tonnes of southern Africa's soil are eroded every year. Experts predict that crop yields will be halved within thirty to fifty years if erosion continues at present rates."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musokotwane Environment Resource Centre for Southern Africa CEP Factsheet |url=http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |accessdate=2013-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213002938/http://www.sardc.net/imercsa/Programs/CEP/Pubs/CEPFS/CEPFS01.htm |archivedate=2013-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dust Bowl]] phenomenon in the 1930s was caused by severe [[drought]] combined with farming methods that did not include crop rotation, fallow fields, [[cover crop]]s, soil terracing and wind-breaking trees to prevent [[Aeolian processes|wind erosion]].&lt;ref name=drought&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tillage]] of agricultural lands is one of the primary contributing factors to erosion, due to mechanised agricultural equipment that allows for deep plowing, which severely increases the amount of soil that is available for transport by [[water erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Blanco, Humberto &amp; Lal, Rattan|chapter=Tillage erosion|title=Principles of Soil Conservation and Management|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-90-481-8529-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wj3690PbDY0C&amp;pg=PA109}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lobb, D.A.|chapter=Soil movement by tillage and other agricultural activities|editor=Jorgenson, Sven E.|title=Applications in Ecological Engineering|publisher=Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-444-53448-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aRKO6ZazC8UC&amp;pg=PA247}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The phenomenon called ''peak soil'' describes how large-scale factory farming techniques are affecting humanity's ability to grow food in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Peak Soil: Why cellulosic ethanol, biofuels are unsustainable and a threat to America |url=http://culturechange.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=107&amp;Itemid=1 |accessdate=2013-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without efforts to improve soil management practices, the availability of [[Arable land|arable soil]] may become increasingly problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CopperWiki Soil erosion |url=http://www.copperwiki.org/index.php?title=Soil_erosion |accessdate=2013-01-05}}{{unreliable source?|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods to combat erosion include [[no-till farming]], using a [[keyline design]], growing [[Hedge|wind breaks]] to hold the soil, and widespread use of [[compost]]. [[Fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s can also have an effect of soil erosion,{{cn|date=July 2018}} which can contribute to [[soil salinity]] and prevent other species from growing. [[Phosphate]] is a primary component in the chemical fertiliser applied most commonly in modern agricultural production. However, scientists estimate that rock phosphate reserves will be depleted in 50–100 years and that ''Peak Phosphate'' will occur in about 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095937800800099X |title=The story of phosphorus: Global food security and food for thought |author=Cordell|journal= Global Environmental Change |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2013-01-06|display-authors=etal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2008.10.009 |volume=19 |pages=292–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Industrial process]]ing and [[logistics]] also have an effect on agriculture's sustainability. The way and locations crops are [[selling|sold]] requires energy for transportation, as well as the energy cost for materials, [[labour (economics)|labour]], and [[transport]]. Food sold at a local location, such a [[farmers' market]], have reduced energy overheads.

===Air===
Air is a renewable resource. All [[living organisms]] need [[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]] (directly or indirectly), [[carbon]] (directly or indirectly) and many other gases in small [[quantities]] for their [[survival skills|survival]].

==Non-food resources==
[[File:Douglas des farges 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Douglas fir]] forest created in 1850, [[Meymac]] (Corrèze), France]]
{{main article|Energy crop|Non-food crop}}
An important renewable resource is [[wood]] provided by means of [[forestry]], which has been used for construction, housing and firewood since ancient times.
&lt;ref Name=unece&gt;[http://www.unece.org/unece-main/info-resources/presscurrent-press-h/forestry-and-timber/2012/wood-confirmed-as-the-primary-source-of-renewable-energy-in-europe/wood-confirmed-as-the-primary-source-of-renewable-energy-in-europe.html Wood confirmed as the primary source of renewable energy in Europe, UNECE February 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=fao&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/014/am859e/am859e08.pdf FAO Factsheet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref Name=woodecon&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/business/21575771-environmental-lunacy-europe-fuel-future  Wood The fuel of the future] Environmental lunacy in Europe, Economist title story Apr 6th 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Plants provide the main sources for renewable resources, the main distinction is made between [[energy crop]]s and [[non-food crop]]s. A large variety of [[Grease (lubricant)|lubricants]], industrially used vegetable oils, textiles and fibre made e.g. of [[cotton]], [[copra]] or [[hemp]], [[paper]] derived from [[wood]], [[Textile|rags]] or [[grass]]es, [[bioplastic]] are based on plant renewable resources. A large variety of chemical based products like [[latex]], [[ethanol]], [[resin]], [[sugar]] and [[starch]] can be provided with plant renewables. Animal based renewables include [[fur]], [[leather]], technical [[fat]] and lubricants and further derived products, as e.g. [[animal glue]], [[tendon]]s, [[Casing (sausage)|casings]] or in historical times [[ambergris|ambra]] and [[baleen]] provided by [[whaling]].

With regard to pharmacy ingredients and legal and illegal drugs, plants are important sources, however e.g. venom of snakes, frogs and insects has been a valuable renewable source of pharmacological ingredients. Before GMO production set in, [[insulin]] and important [[hormones]] were based on animal sources. [[Feather]]s, an important byproduct of poultry farming for food, is still being used as filler and as base for [[keratin]] in general. Same applies for the [[chitin]] produced in farming [[Crustacean]]s which may be used as base of [[chitosan]]. The most important part of the human body used for non-medical purposes is [[human hair]] as for [[artificial hair integrations]], which is being traded worldwide.

===Historical role===
[[File:Japan Factory Ship Nisshin Maru Whaling Mother and Calf.jpg|left|thumb|An adult and sub-adult [[Minke whale]] are dragged aboard the [[Nisshin Maru]], a Japanese whaling vessel]]
[[File:Hanfdaemmstoff CG.jpg|right|thumb|[[Hemp#Building material|Hemp]] insulation, a renewable resource used as [[Sustainable living#Sustainable building materials|building material]]]]

Historically, renewable resources like firewood, [[latex]],  [[guano]], [[charcoal]], [[wood ash]], plant colors as [[indigo]], and whale products have been crucial for human needs but failed to supply demand in the beginning of the industrial era.&lt;ref name=rad/&gt; Early modern times faced large problems with overuse of renewable resources as in [[deforestation]], [[overgrazing]] or [[overfishing]].&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

In addition to fresh meat and milk, which as food items are not the topic of this section, [[livestock]] farmers and artisans used further animal ingredients as  [[tendon]]s, horn, bones, bladders. Complex technical constructions as the [[composite bow]] were based on combination of animal and plant based materials. The current distribution conflict between biofuel and food production is being described as [[Food vs. fuel]].

The [[British Agricultural Revolution]] was mainly based on a new system of [[crop rotation]], the  four-field rotation. [[United Kingdom|British]] agriculturist [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]] recognised the invention in Dutch [[Waasland]] and popularised it in the 18th century UK, [[George Washington Carver]] in the USA. The system used [[wheat]], [[turnip]]s and [[barley]] and introduced as well [[clover]]. Clover is able to fix nitrogen from air, a practically non exhaustive renewable resource, into fertilizing compounds to the soil and allowed to increase yields by large. Farmers opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop. Thus [[livestock]] could to be bred year-round and winter [[culling]] was avoided. The amount of manure rose and allowed more crops but to refrain from [[wood pasture]].&lt;ref name=rad/&gt;

Early modern times and the 19th century saw the previous resource base partially replaced respectively supplemented by large scale chemical synthesis and by the use of fossil and mineral resources respectively.&lt;ref name= DCH/&gt; Besides the still central role of wood, there is a sort of renaissance of renewable products based on modern agriculture, genetic research and extraction technology. Besides fears about an upcoming [[peak oil|global shortage of fossil fuels]], local shortages due to boycotts, war and blockades or just transportation problems in remote regions have contributed to different methods of replacing or substituting fossil resources based on renewables.

===Challenges===
The use of certain basically renewable products as in [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Animal substances|TCM]] [[endangered species|endangers various species]]. Just the black market in [[rhinoceros horn]] reduced the world's rhino population by more than 90 percent over the past 40 years.&lt;ref name=RH&gt;''"Rhino horn: All myth, no medicine"'', ''National Geographic'', Rhishja Larson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FTCMRH&gt;''Facts about traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): rhinoceros horn'', Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/1035448/traditional-Chinese-medicine-TCM-as-discussed-in-rhinoceros-mammal Facts about traditional Chinese medicine (TCM): rhinoceros horn, as discussed in rhinoceros (mammal):&amp;nbsp;– Britannica Online Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewables used for self sufficiency===
[[Image:FA Geisenheim22.jpg|thumb|In vitro-culture of Vitis (grapevine), [[Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute]]]]
The success of the German chemical industry till World War I was based on the replacement of colonial products. The predecessors of [[IG Farben]]  dominated the world market for [[Dye|synthetic dyes]] at the beginning of the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aftalion|1991|p=104}}, {{Harvnb|Chandler|2004|p=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; and had an important role in artificial [[Drug|pharmaceuticals]], [[photographic film]], [[Agrichemical|agricultural chemicals]] and [[Electrochemistry|electrochemicals]].&lt;ref name= DCH&gt;{{Cite book|title = The German Chemical Industry in the Twentieth Century|last = Lesch|first = John E.|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2000|isbn = |location = |pages = 219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the former [[Plant breeding]] research institutes took a different approach. After the loss of the [[German colonial empire]], important players in the field as [[Erwin Baur]] and [[Konrad Meyer]] switched to using local crops as base for economic [[autarky]].&lt;ref name="heim"&gt;Autarkie und Ostexpansion: Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus, (agrarian research during the NS regime) Susanne Heim, Wallstein, 2002, {{ISBN|389244496X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Autarkie und Ostexpansion: Pflanzenzucht und Agrarforschung im Nationalsozialismus, (agrarian research during the NS regime)|last = Heim|first = Susanne|publisher = Wallstein|year = 2002|isbn = 389244496X|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer as a key agricultural scientist and spatial planner of the Nazi era managed and lead [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]] resources and focused about a third of the complete research grants in Nazi Germany on agricultural and genetic research and especially on resources needed in case of a further German war effort.&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt;  A wide array of agrarian research institutes still existing today and having importance in the field was founded or enlarged in the time.

There were some major failures as trying to e.g. grow [[Hardiness (plants)|frost resistant]] olive species, but some success in the case of [[hemp]], [[flax]], [[rapeseed]], which are still of current importance.&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt; During World War 2, German scientists tried to use Russian [[Taraxacum]] (dandelion) species to manufacture [[natural rubber]].&lt;ref name="heim"/&gt;  Rubber dandelions are still of interest, as scientists in the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) announced 2013 to have developed a cultivar that is suitable for commercial production of natural rubber.&lt;ref name=sciencedaily&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Rubber from Dandelion Juice|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/10/131028114547.htm|work=sciencedaily.com|publisher=sciencedaily.com|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal situation and subsidies==
Several legal and economic means have been used to enhance the market share of renewables.
The UK uses [[Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation]]s (NFFO), a collection of [[Statutory Instrument|orders]] requiring the electricity [[Distribution Network Operator]]s in [[England]] and [[Wales]] to purchase electricity from the [[nuclear power]] and [[renewable energy]] sectors. Similar mechanisms operate in [[Scotland]] (the Scottish Renewable Orders under the Scottish Renewables Obligation) and [[Northern Ireland]] (the Northern Ireland Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation). In the USA, [[Renewable Energy Certificates]] (RECs), use a similar approach. German [[Energy transition|Energiewende]] is using fed-in tariffs. An unexpected outcome of the subsidies was the quick increase of pellet byfiring in conventional fossil fuel plants (compare [[Tilbury power stations]]) and cement works, making wood respectively biomass accounting for about half of Europe’s renewable-energy consumption.&lt;ref Name=woodecon/&gt;

==Examples of industrial use==

===Biorenewable chemicals===
Biorenewable chemicals are chemicals created by biological organisms that provide feedstocks for the chemical industry.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nikolau|first=Basil J.|last2=Perera|first2=M.

The tremendous diversity of enzymes in biological organisms, and the potential for [[synthetic biology]] to alter these enzymes to create yet new chemical functionalities, can drive the chemical industry.  A major platform for creation of new chemicals is the [[polyketide]] biosynthetic pathway, which generates chemicals containing repeated [[alkyl]] chain units with potential for a wide variety of [[functional group]]s at the different carbon atoms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garg|first=Shivani|last2=Rizhsky|first2=Ludmila|last3=Jin|first3=Huanan|last4=Yu|first4=Xiaochen|last5=Jing|first5=Fuyuan|last6=Yandeau-Nelson|first6=Marna D.|last7=Nikolau|first7=Basil J.|title=Microbial production of bi-functional molecules by diversification of the fatty acid pathway|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1096717616000045|journal=Metabolic Engineering|volume=35|pages=9–20|doi=10.1016/j.ymben.2016.01.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leber|first=Christopher|last2=Da Silva|first2=Nancy A.|date=2014-02-01|title=Engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the synthesis of short chain fatty acids|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.25021/abstract|journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering|language=en|volume=111|issue=2|pages=347–358|doi=10.1002/bit.25021|issn=1097-0290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides their role as a resource for fuel and building material, trees protect the environment by absorbing carbon dioxide and by creating oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chemistry.about.com/od/environmentalchemistry/f/oxygen-produced-by-trees.htm How Much Oxygen Does One Tree Produce?] By Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D., About.com Guide&lt;/ref&gt;  The destruction of rain forests is one of the critical causes of [[climate change]]. Deforestation causes carbon dioxide to linger in the atmosphere. As carbon dioxide accrues, it produces a layer in the atmosphere that traps radiation from the sun. The radiation converts to heat which causes [[global warming]], which is better known as the [[greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;Mumoki, Fiona. “The Effects of Deforestation on our Environment Today.” Panorama.

Deforestation also affects the [[water cycle]].

{{main article|Endangered species}}

Some renewable resources, species and organisms are facing a very high risk of extinction caused by growing human population and over-consumption. It has been estimated that over 40% of all living species on Earth are at risk of going extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species/|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525032656/http://www.conservationandwildlife.com/threatened-species/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=25 May 2017|title=Threatened Species|publisher=Conservation and Wildlife|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many nations have laws to protect hunted species and to restrict the practice of hunting. Other conservation methods include restricting land development or creating preserves. The [[IUCN Red List|IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]] is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |title=Red List Overview |date=February 2011 |publisher=IUCN |accessdate=2 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527175928/http://www.iucnredlist.org/about/red-list-overview |archivedate=27 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, 199 countries have signed an accord agreeing to create [[Biodiversity Action Plan]]s to protect endangered and other threatened species.

{{nihongo|'''Takeminakata-no-Kami'''|建御名方神}} or {{nihongo|'''Takeminakata-no-Mikoto'''|建御名方命}}, also known as {{nihongo|'''Minakatatomi-no-Kami'''|南方刀美神}} or {{nihongo|'''Takeminakatatomi-no-Mikoto'''|建御名方富命}} is the name of one of the two principal [[Kami|deities]] of [[Suwa taisha|Suwa Grand Shrine]] in [[Nagano Prefecture]] (historical [[Shinano Province]]). Also known under the epithet {{nihongo|'''Suwa [[Myōjin]]'''|諏訪明神}} or {{nihongo|'''Suwa Daimyōjin'''|諏訪大明神}}, he is considered to be a god of [[List of wind deities|wind]], [[List of water deities|water]] and [[List of nature deities|agriculture]], as well as a patron of [[List of hunting deities|hunting]] and [[List of war deities|warfare]], in which capacity he enjoyed a particularly fervent cult from various [[samurai]] clans during the medieval period such as the [[Hōjō clan|Hōjō]] or the [[Takeda clan|Takeda]]. The deity was also held to be the original ancestor of certain families who once served at the shrine as priests, foremost among them being the [[Suwa clan]], the high priests of the Upper Shrine of Suwa who were also revered as the living incarnations of the god.

The Suwa deity is the subject of a number of different, often conflicting myths. For instance, in the ''[[Kojiki]]'' (720 CE) and later derivative accounts, Takeminakata appears as one of the sons of [[Ōkuninushi]], god of [[Izumo Province|Izumo]] and lord of [[Ashihara no Nakatsukuni]] (i.e. the land of Japan), who was forced into exile in the region of Suwa after being defeated by [[Takemikazuchi]], an envoy sent by the gods of [[Takama-ga-hara|heaven]], whereas other stories portray the god as being among other things a heavenly deity who conquered the Suwa region, an enlightened ruler of an Indian kingdom, a bodiless entity, or even a human [[Samurai|warrior]] named [[Kōga Saburō]].

==Name==
[[File:Suwa_Taisha.JPG|thumb|The main shrine or ''Honmiya'' (本宮) of the Upper Shrine (上社 ''Kamisha'') of Suwa, one of the two main sites that make up Suwa Grand Shrine. The Suwa deity is enshrined in the Upper Shrine located on the southeast end of [[Lake Suwa]], while his consort is worshipped on the Lower Shrine (下社 ''Shimosha'') on the opposite shore.]]

===Etymology===
The god is named 'Takeminakata' ({{nihongo|建御名方神}} ''Takeminakata-no-Kami'') in both the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and the ''[[Kujiki|''Sendai Kuji Hongi'']]'' (aka ''Kujiki''). Variants of the name found in the imperially commissioned [[Rikkokushi|national histories]] and other literary sources include 'Minakatatomi' ({{nihongo|南方刀美神}} ''Minakatomi-no-Kami'' or {{nihongo|御名方富命神}} ''Minakatatomi-no-Mikoto-no-Kami'') or 'Takeminakatatomi' ({{nihongo|建御名方富命神}} ''Takeminakatatomi-no-Mikoto-no-Kami'').

The name's etymology is unclear. While most commentators seem to agree that ''take-'' (and probably ''-tomi'') are honorifics, they differ in how to interpret the other components of the name. Some of the proposed solutions are as follows.

*The [[Edo period]] ''[[kokugaku]]'' scholar [[Motoori Norinaga]]&lt;ref name="Norinaga1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Motoori|first1=Norinaga|title=古事記伝 (Kojiki-den), vol. 14|date=1764–1798|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/2556374/35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norinaga2"&gt;Motoori, Norinaga (1937).

(Original work written 1764–1798)&lt;/ref&gt; explained both ''take-'' (建) and ''mi-'' (御) as honorifics (称名 ''tatae-na''), with ''kata'' (方) as yet another ''tatae-na'' meaning 'hard' or 'firm' (堅). [[Basil Chamberlain]] followed Motoori's lead and rendered the god's name as 'Brave-August-Name-Firm' in his translation of the ''Kojiki''.&lt;ref name="Chamberlain"&gt;Chamberlain, Basil (trans.)

Yokohama: Lane, Crawford &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Historian [[:ja:太田亮|Ōta Akira]] (1926) interpreted ''take-'', ''mi-'' and ''-tomi'' as honorifics and took ''Nakata'' (名方) to be a place name: Nakata District ([[:ja:名方郡|名方郡]]) in [[Awa Province (Tokushima)|Awa Province]] (modern [[Ishii, Tokushima|Ishii]], [[Tokushima Prefecture]]), where [https://www.google.co.jp/maps/place/%E3%80%92779-3200+Tokushima-ken,+My%C5%8Dzai-gun,+Ishii-ch%C5%8D,+Urash%C5%8D,+Suwa%E2%88%92213%E2%88%921,+%E5%A4%9A%E7%A5%81%E5%BE%A1%E5%A5%88%E5%88%80%E5%BC%A5%E7%A5%9E%E7%A4%BE/@34.0723826,134.4092873,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x35530a6f7db45037:0x3b0f62dd7dc4f1db!8m2!3d34.0723861!4d134.4114833 Takeminatomi Shrine] (多祁御奈刀弥神社) stands.&lt;ref&gt;Ōta (1926). p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Owa Iwao (1990) explains the similarity between 'Takeminakata(tomi)' and 'Takeminatomi' by proposing that the name may have been brought to Suwa by immigrants from Nakata in Awa.&lt;ref&gt;Ōwa (1990). pp. 214–216.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Minakata'' has also been linked to the [[Munakata Taisha|Munakata]] (宗像) of [[Kyushu]].&lt;ref name="Yoshii"&gt;{{Citation|title = Takeminakata-no-Kami (建御名方神)|author=Yoshii, Iwao|encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Nipponica|volume=14|publisher=Shōgakukan|isbn=978-4-09-526114-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Imperial Navy]] colonel and amateur ethnographer [[:ja:松岡静雄|Matsuoka Shizuo]] (1936) interpreted Minakatatomi as originally being a goddess – citing the fact that the deities of Munakata shrine were female – that was later conflated with the male god Takeminakata.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Matsuoka|first1=Shizuo|title=Minzokugaku yori mitaru Azuma-uta to Sakimori-uta (民族學より見たる東歌と防人歌)|date=1936|publisher=Ōokayama-shoten|pages=197–199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QLb0QBVHZW8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A number of more recent scholars have theorized that ''mina'' most likely means "water" (水), pointing to the god originally being a [[water deity]] and/or a connection to [[Lake Suwa]].&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yamaguchi, Yoshinori and Kōnoshi, Takamitsu (eds.)|title=Shinpen nihon koten bungaku zenshū, vol. 1.

*An alternative explanation for the word ''-tomi'' (as well as the ''-tome'' in 'Yasakatome', the name of this god's consort) is to link it with dialectal words for 'snake' (''tomi'', ''tobe'', or ''tōbe''), thereby seeing the name as hinting to the god being a kind of [[Snake worship|serpentine]] water deity (''[[mizuchi]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Tomiku, Takashi (1970).

===''Suwa Daimyōjin''===

{{see also|Myōjin}}

A common epithet for the god enshrined in [[Suwa taisha|Suwa Grand Shrine]] – specifically, in the Upper Shrine (''Kamisha'') located southeast of [[Lake Suwa]] – since the Middle Ages is ''Suwa Myōjin'' ({{nihongo|諏訪明神}}) or ''Suwa Daimyōjin'' ({{nihongo|諏訪大明神}}), a name also applied via [[metonymy]] to the shrine itself. A variant associated with the syncretic [[Shinto sects and schools#Early period schools and groups|Ryōbu Shintō]] sect, ''Suwa (Nangū) Hosshō (Kamishimo) Daimyōjin'' (諏訪(南宮)法性(上下)大明神), "[[Reality in Buddhism|Dharma-Nature]] ''Daimyōjin'' of (the Upper and Lower) Suwa (''Nangū''{{efn|The precise meaning of ''Nangū'' (南宮, lit.

==Suwa Myōjin in mythology==

While the deity of Suwa Shrine, officially named '(Take)minakata(tomi)' in the imperially-commissioned [[Rikkokushi|national histories of Japan]], is already associated with the Takeminakata of the ''Kojiki'' (a son of Ōkuninushi and a deity of [[Izumo Province]]) in the ''Sendai Kuji Hongi'' (compiled 807-936 CE),&lt;ref name="Hongi2"&gt;{{cite web|title=先代舊事本紀卷第四|url=http://miko.org/~uraki/kuon/furu/text/sendaikuji/sendaikuji04.htm|website=私本 先代舊事本紀}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hongi"&gt;先代舊事本紀 巻第四 (''Sendai Kuji Hongi'', book 4), in {{cite book|editor=Keizai Zasshisha|title=国史大系 第7巻 (Kokushi-taikei, vol. 7)|date=1898|publisher=Keizai Zasshisha|pages=243–244|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/991097/136}}&lt;/ref&gt; an identification repeated and popularized by the ''[[Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba]]'' (1356), other myths and legends, some from within Suwa itself, give completely different accounts of the god's origin and nature. In fact, most of the religious rituals of Suwa Shrine are actually not so much concerned with the official identities of its deities but with their character as [[Mishaguji]], local agricultural and fertility deities.&lt;ref&gt;Grumbach (2005). pp. 153-154.&lt;/ref&gt; The name 'Takeminakata' in fact does not appear in historical records of the Upper Shrine's ceremonies; rather, the focus of worship in many of these rituals are often identified in these texts as the Mishaguji.&lt;ref name="Mishaguji"&gt;{{cite web|title=ミシャグジ (Mishaguji)|url=http://japangod.dip.jp/%E3%83%9F%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A3%E3%82%B0%E3%82%B8.html|website=日本の神様辞典 (Nihon no Kamisama Jiten)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). p. 689.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanigawa, ed. (1987). p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

To reflect this distinction, this article shall use 'Takeminakata (of Izumo)' to refer to the figure described in the ''Kojiki'', the ''Kuji Hongi'', and other sources which use the name or some variant thereof, and 'Suwa Myōjin' or 'the Suwa deity' to refer to the god of Suwa Shrine as portrayed in other myths and in his capacity as shrine deity.

===Origins===

[[File:Shinpukuji-bon_Kojiki_(真福寺本古事記).png|thumb|230px|left|The passage concerning Takeminakata's appearance and defeat from the oldest extant manuscript of the ''[[Kojiki]]'', the Shinpukuji-bon (真福寺本, written 1371-1372)]]
====As Takeminakata of Izumo====

=====Parentage=====

Takeminaka is portrayed in both the ''Kojiki'' and the ''Sendai Kuji Hongi'' as a son of earthly deity (''kunitsukami'') [[Ōkuninushi]], ruler of [[Izumo Province]]. The ''Kojiki'' does not include him in its genealogy of Ōkuninushi's children,&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain (1882). [http://sacred-texts.com/shi/kj/kj033.htm Section XXVI.—The Deities the August Descendants of the Deity Master-of-the-Great-Land]&lt;/ref&gt; although the corresponding section in the ''Kuji Hongi'' reckons him as the son of one of Ōkuninushi's wives, Nunakawahime of [[Koshi Province|Koshi]].&lt;ref name="Hongi" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain (1882). [http://sacred-texts.com/shi/kj/kj031.htm Section XXIV.—The Wooing of the Deity-of-Eight-Thousand-Spears.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Takeminakata and Takemikazuchi=====

{{see also|Kuni-yuzuri}}

Takeminakata appears in the ''Kojiki'' and the ''Kuji Hongi'' in the context of Ōkuninushi's "transfer of the land" (''kuni-yuzuri'') to the ''amatsukami'', the gods of [[Takama-ga-hara|heaven]] (Takamagahara).&lt;ref name="Chamberlain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KujiHongi03"&gt;{{cite web|title=先代舊事本紀卷第三|url=http://miko.org/~uraki/kuon/furu/text/sendaikuji/sendaikuji03.htm|website=私本 先代舊事本紀}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the gods of Takamagahara sent [[Takemikazuchi]] and another messenger{{efn|[[Kamiumi#Birth of the gods|Ame-no-Torifune]] in the ''Kojiki'', [[Futsunushi]] in the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' and the ''Kuji Hongi''}} to demand that Ōkuninushi relinquish his authority over the Central Land of Reed-Plains ([[Ashihara no Nakatsukuni]]) to the progeny of the sun goddess [[Amaterasu]], he asked to confer with two sons of his first before giving his decision. While the first son, [[Kotoshironushi]], immediately accepted their demands and advised his father to do likewise, the second, Takeminakata, carrying an enormous rock (千引之石 ''chibiki no ishi'', i.e. a boulder so large it would take a thousand men to pull) on the fingertips of one hand, challenged Takemikazuchi to a test of strength, grabbing the messenger's arm.

Upon having his arm seized by Takeminakata, Takemikazuchi transformed it into an icicle and then a sword blade, preventing Takeminakata from holding onto it. In return, Takemikazuchi grasped Takeminakata's arm, crushing it like a reed and throwing it (or him) aside. The injured Takeminakata then fled in fear, pursued by the heavenly messenger. Upon arriving at "the sea of [[Suwa, Nagano|Suwa]] in the [[Shinano Province|province of Shinano]]" (科野国州羽海), Takeminakata begged for his life, vowing not to leave Shinano at any pretext.

With Takeminakata's surrender, Ōkuninushi finally agreed to cede the land to the heavenly deities.&lt;ref name="Chamberlain" /&gt;&lt;ref name="KujiHongi03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hackin1932"&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

The opening section of the ''[[Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba]]'' gives a summary of the ''Kuji Hongi'' version of this story, notably omitting any mention of Takeminakata's defeat under Takemikazuchi.&lt;ref name="SuwaShishi685689"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai (諏訪市史編纂委員会)|title=Suwa Shishi, vol. 1 (諏訪市史 上巻 原始・古代・中世)|date=1995|location=Suwa|pages=685, 689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Amaterasu-Ōmikami gave a decree and sent two gods, [[Futsunushi|Futsunushi-no-Kami]] (of [[Katori Shrine]] in [[Shimōsa Province|Sōshū]]) and [[Takemikazuchi|Takeikatsuchi-no-Kami]] (of [[Kashima Shrine]] in [[Hitachi Province|Jōshū]]), down to the land of Izumo, where they declared to [[Ōkuninushi|Ōanamuchi]] (of [[Izumo-taisha|Kitsuki]] in [[Izumo Province|Unshū]] [and] [[Ōmiwa Shrine|Miwa]] in [[Yamato Province|Washū]]), "The Central Land of Reed-Plains is the land entrusted to our heir. Are you willing to give it up to the heavenly deities?"&lt;br /&gt;
Ōanamuchi said, "Ask my son, [[Kotoshironushi|Kotoshironushi-no-Kami]] (of [[Nagata Shrine]] in [[Settsu Province|Sesshū]]; eighth [patron deity of] the [[Department of Divinities|Jingi-kan]]); he will give you an answer."&lt;br /&gt;
Kotoshironushi-no-Kami said, "My father ought respectfully to withdraw, nor will I disobey."&lt;br /&gt;
[The messengers said,] "Do you have any other sons who ought to speak?"&lt;br /&gt;
"There is also my son, Takeminakata-no-Kami (of Suwa Shrine)."&lt;br /&gt;
[He] came, bearing a boulder that would take a thousand men to pull (''chibiki no ishi'') on his fingertips, saying, "Who is this that has come to our land, talking so furtively? I wish to challenge you to a test of strength."&lt;br /&gt;
When he took his hand, it turned into an icicle, and then it turned into a sword blade [or 'he took a sword']. Upon arriving at the sea of Suwa in the land of Shinano, Takeminakata-no-Kami said, "I will go to no other place but this," etc. This is the origin story of this shrine's [[Honji suijaku|manifestation]] (当社垂迹の本縁 ''tōsha suijaku no hon'en'').{{efn|「天照太神ミコトノリシテ経津主ノ&lt;small&gt;総州香取社&lt;/small&gt;神武甕槌ノ&lt;small&gt;常州鹿島社&lt;/small&gt;神二柱ノ神ヲ出雲国ニ降タテマツリテ、大己貴&lt;small&gt;雲州杵築・和州三輪&lt;/small&gt;ノ命ニ問テノタマハク、葦原ノ中津国者我御子の知ラスヘキ国ナリ。汝マサニ此国ヲモテ天ノ神ニ奉ンヤ、大己貴ノ命申サク、我子事代主&lt;small&gt;摂州長田社・神祇官第八&lt;/small&gt;ノ神ニ問テ返事申サント申、事代主神申サク、我父ヨロシクマサニサリ奉ルヘシ。ワレモ我タカウヘカラスト申。又申ヘキ子アリヤ、又我子建御名方&lt;small&gt;諏訪社&lt;/small&gt;ノ神、千引ノ石ヲ手末ニサヽケテ来テ申サク、是我国ニキタリテ、シノヒテカクイフハ、シカウシテ力クラヘセント思、先ソノ御手ヲ取テ即氷ヲ成立、又剣ヲ取成、科野ノ国洲羽ノ海ニイタルトキ、当御名方ノ神申サク、ワレ此国ヲ除者他処ニ不行云々、是則当社垂迹ノ本縁也。」&lt;ref&gt;''Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba'', in Kanai (1982). p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;Yamashita (2006). p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A local legend in [[Shimoina District, Nagano|Shimoina District]] claims that Takemikazuchi caught up with the fleeing Takeminakata in the modern village of [[Toyooka, Nagano|Toyooka]], at which they both agreed to cease hostilities. The two then left imprints of their hands on a rock as a sign of their agreement. The rock, bearing the gods' supposed handprints (''tegata''), is found in Otegata Shrine (御手形神社) in Toyooka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=佐原諏訪神社(御手形神社) 下伊那郡豊丘村佐原 |url=http://yatsu-genjin.jp/suwataisya/suwasya/tegata.htm |website=諏訪大社と諏訪神社（附･神社参拝記）|publisher=八ヶ岳原人}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=国護りと天孫降臨の神話ー御手形石ー |url=http://www.ja-mis.iijan.or.jp/gotominami/hometown/2016/11/post_140.php |website=JA Minami Shinshu official website}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Takemikazuchi's departure, Takeminakata temporarily resided in the neighboring village of [[Ōshika, Nagano|Ōshika]], hunting deer in the mountains, before making his way northward to Suwa.

In a few late retellings of the story, Takeminakata goes to Suwa not so much to flee from Takemikazuchi but to pacify it under the orders of his father Ōkuninushi.&lt;ref&gt;Miyachi (1931b). pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The contest between Takemikazuchi and Takeminakata has also sometimes been interpreted as an [[origin myth]] for [[Sumo|sumo wrestling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pate|first1=Alan Scott|title=Ningyo: The Art of the Japanese Doll|date=2013|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|isbn=978-1462907205|pages=135–136|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EzzRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Spracklen|editor1-first=Karl|editor2-last=Lashua|editor2-first=Brett|editor3-last=Sharpe|editor3-first=Erin|editor4-last=Swain|editor4-first=Spencer|title=The Palgrave Handbook of Leisure Theory|date=2017|publisher=978-1137564795|pages=173–175|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_2yDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

======Alternative locations======

Whereas the place where Takeminakata was caught, "the sea of Suwa," is commonly understood as referring to [[Lake Suwa]] in Nagano, there have been a number of attempts in the past to identify this "Suwa" with other areas, such as the provinces of [[Suō Province|Suō]] (based on its proximity to Izumo and the claimed similarity between the two toponyms) or [[Hizen Province|Hizen]] (cf. [[Suwa Shrine (Nagasaki)|Suwa Shrine]] in [[Nagasaki]]).&lt;ref&gt;Miyachi (1931b). pp. 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the abolition of the Suwa Grand Shrine's traditional priestly offices during the [[Meiji period]], the Upper Shrine of Suwa's high priest or ''Ōhōri'' (大祝  'great priest'; also ''Ōhafuri'') was a young boy chosen from the [[Suwa clan]], who was, during his term of office, considered to be [[Arahitogami|a living god]], the visible incarnation or 'body' of the unseen Suwa deity.&lt;ref name="Ihara"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ihara|first1=Kesao|title=鎌倉期の諏訪神社関係史料にみる神道と仏道 : 中世御記文の時代的特質について (Shinto and Buddhism as Depicted in Historical Materials Related to Suwa Shrines of the Kamakura Period : Temporal Characteristics of Medieval Imperial Writings)|journal=Bulletin of the National Museum of Japanese History|date=2008-03-31|volume=139|pages=157–185|url=https://rekihaku.repo.nii.ac.jp/?action=pages_view_main&amp;active_action=repository_view_main_item_detail&amp;item_id=1538&amp;item_no=1&amp;page_id=13&amp;block_id=41}} {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1988|editor1-last=Hall|editor1-first=John Whitney|title=The Cambridge History of Japan, Volume 1: Ancient Japan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0521223522|page=343|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A3_6lp8IOK8C&amp;pg=PA343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend of how Suwa Myōjin chose his first priest is recounted in various sources, such as the ''Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;At the beginning of the god's [[Honji suijaku|manifestation]], he took off his robe, put them on an eight-year-old boy, and dubbed him 'great priest' (''Ōhōri''). The god declared, "I do not have a body and so make this priest (''hōri'') my body."&lt;br /&gt;
This [boy] is Arikazu (有員), the priest of the sacred robe (御衣祝 ''Misogihōri''), the founding ancestor of the Miwa/Jin (神, i.e. Suwa) clan.{{efn|「祝は神明の垂迹の初。御衣を八歳の童男にぬぎきせ給ひて。大祝と称し。我において体なし。祝を以て躰とすと神勅ありけり。是則御衣祝有員神氏の始祖なり。」&lt;ref name="EkotobaHori"&gt;''Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba'', in Hanawa (1919). pp. 521–522.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although most sources (such as the ''Ekotoba'' above) identify the boy with the semi-legendary priest Arikazu, who is said to have lived during the reign of [[Emperor Kanmu]] (781-806) or his immediate successors [[Emperor Heizei|Heizei]] (806-809) or [[Emperor Saga|Saga]] (809-823),&lt;ref name="Shinenpyo"&gt;Suwa Kyōikukai (1938). p. 11.{{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miyasaka35"&gt;Miyasaka (1987). p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=大祝有員 (Ōhōri Arikazu)|url=http://www.city.suwa.lg.jp/scm/dat/nandemo/koumoku/0300/030504.htm|website=Official website of Suwa City {{ja icon}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=諏方氏 (Suwa Clan)|url=http://www.city.suwa.lg.jp/scm/dat/nandemo/koumoku/0300/030503.htm|website=Official website of Suwa City {{ja icon}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; two recently discovered genealogical lists - of disputed historical reliability&lt;ref&gt;Ihara (2008). pp. 260-262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fukushima, Masaki (福島正樹)|title=信濃古代の通史叙述をめぐって (Shinano kodai no tsūshi jojutsu wo megutte)|url=http://user1.matsumoto.ne.jp/~fukusima/yamakawa.htm|website=科野太郎の古代・中世史の部屋|accessdate=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Itō, Rintarō (伊藤麟太朗)|title=所謂『阿蘇氏系図』について (Iwayuru 'Aso-shi Keizu' ni tsuite)|journal=Shinano (信濃)|date=1994|volume=46|issue=8|pages=696-697|publisher=Shinano Shigakukai (信濃史学会)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Murasaki, Machiko (村崎真智子)|title=異本阿蘇氏系図試論 (Ihon Aso-shi keizu shiron)|journal=Hito, mono, kotoba no jinruigaku: Kokubu Naoichi Hakushi beiju kinen ronbunshū (ヒト・モノ・コトバの人類学. 国分直一博士米寿記念論文集)|date=1996|pages=202-218|publisher=Keiyūsha (慶友社)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Asoshina, Yasuo (阿蘇品 保夫)|title=阿蘇社と大宮司―中世の阿蘇 (Aso-sha to Daiguji: chusei no Aso)|date=1999|publisher=Ichinomiya-machi (一の宮町)|isbn=978-4877550462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a contrary viewpoint, cf. {{cite web|author1=Hōga, Yoshio (宝賀寿男)|title=村崎真智子氏論考「異本阿蘇氏系図試論」等を読む|url=http://wwr2.ucom.ne.jp/hetoyc15/|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; - instead identify the first priest with Otoei (乙頴) or Kumako (神子 or 熊古), a son of Mase-gimi (麻背君) or Iotari (五百足), head of the Kanesashi (金刺, also 'Kanasashi') clan and ''[[kuni no miyatsuko]]'' of Shinano Province during the late 6th century.&lt;ref name="Kanasashi"&gt;{{cite web|title=金刺氏 (Kanasashi-shi)|url=http://www2.harimaya.com/sengoku/html/kanazasi.html|website=播磨屋 (harimaya.com)}} {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1992), pp. 7–11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1987). pp. 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Otoei (''Ōhōri'' of the great god of Suwa): also known as Kumako (神子) or Kumako (熊古).&lt;br /&gt;
When he was eight years old, the great god Minakatatomi-no-Mikoto appeared, took off his robe and put them on Kumako, declaring, "I do not have a body and so make you my body." In the third month of the second year of [[Emperor Yōmei|Iware Ikebe no Ōmiya]] (587), a sanctuary (社壇) was built at the foot of the mountain at the southern side of the lake (i.e. Lake Suwa) to worship the great god of Suwa and various other gods ...{{efn|「乙頴 (諏訪大神大祝)：一名神子、又云、熊古　生而八歳、御名方富命大神化現脱着御衣於神子勅曰、吾無体以汝為体、盤余池辺大宮朝二年丁未三月搆壇于湖南山麓、祭諏訪大明神及百八十神、奉千代田刺忌串斎之」&lt;ref name="Asoshi" /&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====As a god from heaven====

Whereas the ''Kojiki'' portrays Takeminakata as an earthly god defeated by a deity from heaven, a myth from Suwa itself features the exact opposite scenario, in which Takeminakata / Suwa Myōjin is the heavenly deity who descends and conquers the land below.

A petition (解状 ''gejō'') submitted to the [[Kamakura shogunate]] in 1249 by Suwa Nobushige, then high priest of the Upper Shrine,&lt;ref name="GejoEkotoba"&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed.

====As an Indian king====

A medieval Buddhist legend portrays Suwa Myōjin as a king from India who later achieved enlightenment and went to Japan [[Honji suijaku|to become a native ''kami'']].

[[File:御射山神社鳥居 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|Misayama Shrine (御射山神社) in [[Fujimi, Nagano|Fujimi]], Nagano. During the medieval period, the hunting ceremony held at Misayama - Suwa Shrine's sacred hunting ground - was the largest of Suwa's religious ceremonies and one of its most important, attracting thousands of people.]]

The ''Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba'' relates a slightly different, fuller version of the first half of this story as an origin myth for the Upper Shrine's hunting ceremony held every seventh month of the year at Misayama (御射山) on the slopes of the [[Yatsugatake Mountains]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If one should inquire about the origins (因縁 ''in'en'', lit. 'causes and conditions') of this hunt: long ago, the Daimyōjin was the king of the land of Hadai in [[Tianzhu (India)|India]] who went out to hunt at [[Sarnath|Deer Park]] from the twenty-seventh to the thirtieth day of [[Chinese calendar|the seventh month]]. At that time, a traitorous vassal named Bikyō (美教) suddenly organized an army and sought to kill the king. The king, ringing a golden bell, looked up to heaven and shouted eight times: "I am now about to be killed by this rebel. I have hunted animals, not for my own enjoyment, but in order to lead them to the Buddhist path. If this my action is in accordance with Heaven's will, may [[Brahmā]] save me."&lt;br /&gt;
Brahmā then saw this and commanded the [[Four Heavenly Kings|four great deva-kings]] to wield [[vajra]]-poles and destroy the army. It is said that the Misayama (三齋山) of today reflects that event.&lt;br /&gt; ... One should know, therefore, that the deity's compassionate hunting is an [[Upaya|expedient means]] for the salvation of creatures.&lt;ref&gt;Translation based on Grumbach (2005). p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|「扨も此御狩の因縁をたづぬれば、大明神昔天竺波提國の王たりし時、七月廿七日より同卅日にいたるまで鹿野園に出で狩をせさせ給ひたる時、美教と云亂臣忽に軍を率して王を害し奉らんとす。其時王金鈴を振て、蒼天に仰て八度さけびてのたまはく、『我今逆臣の為に害せられむとす、狩る所の畜類全く自欲の爲にあらず。佛道を成ぜしめむが爲也。是若天意にかなはば、梵天我をすくひたまへ』と。其時梵天眼を以て是を見て、四大天王に勅して金剛杖を執て群黨を誅せしめ給ひにけり。今の三齋山、其儀をうつさるゝ由傳たり。(...)爰に知ぬ、神明慈悲の畋獵は郡類濟度の方便なりと云事を。」&lt;ref name="Ekotoba534"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hanawa|editor1-first=Hokiichi|title=諏訪大明神繪詞 (Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba)|date=1914|publisher=Zoku Gunsho-ruijū Kanseikai|series=''[[Gunsho Ruijū|Zoku Gunsho-ruijū]]'' (続群書類従)|volume=3|page=534|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/936498/65}} {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding the Upper Shrine's hunting rituals, the ''Monoimi no rei'' asserts that

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The shrine's] hunts began in the deer park of Hadai-no-kuni [in India]. [The use of] hawks began in [[Magadha|Magada-no-kuni]].&lt;ref&gt;Grumbach (2005). p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second half of the legend (the slaying of the dragon in Persia and the king's migration to Japan) is used by the ''Ekotoba''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s compiler, Suwa Enchū, in a liturgical text, the ''Suwa Daimyōjin Kōshiki'' (諏方大明神講式),&lt;ref name="Koshikitaikei"&gt;諏方大明神講式 (''Suwa Daimyōjin Kōshiki''), in {{cite book|editor1-last=Takeuchi|editor1-first=Hideo|title=神道大系 神社編30 諏訪 (Shintō Taikei, Jinja-hen vol. 30: Suwa)|date=1982|publisher=Shintō Taikei Hensankai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=諏方大明神講式 (''Suwa Daimyōjin Kōshiki'')|url=http://base1.nijl.ac.jp/iview/Frame.jsp?DB_ID=G0003917KTM&amp;C_CODE=KSRM-287105&amp;IMG_SIZE=&amp;PROC_TYPE=null&amp;SHOMEI=%E3%80%90%E8%AB%8F%E6%96%B9%E5%A4%A7%E6%98%8E%EF%A8%99%E8%AC%9B%E5%BC%8F%E3%80%91&amp;REQUEST_MARK=null&amp;OWNER=null&amp;IMG_NO=4|website=国文学研究資料館 (National Institute of Japanese Literature)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chusei" /&gt; where it is introduced as an alternative, if somewhat less credible, account of the Suwa deity's origins (in comparison to the myth of Takeminakata of Izumo as found in the ''Kuji Hongi'', touted by the same text as the authoritative origin story of the god) that nevertheless should not be suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuda; Nihonmatsu; Tokuda, eds. (2015). p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ancestry=====

[[File:Shaka Nyorai.jpg|thumb|120px|Medieval Buddhist legends claim the Suwa deity to be a relative of [[Gautama Buddha]] (pictured)]]

The ''Suwa Daimyōjin Kōshiki'' claims the king of Hadai to be a great-great-grandson of [[Sihahanu|King Siṃhahanu]] (獅子頬王 ''Shishikyō-ō''), [[Gautama Buddha]]'s grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuda; Nihonmatsu; Tokuda, eds. (2015). p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar account appears in a work known as the ''Suwa Jinja Engi'' (諏訪神社縁起) or ''Suwa Shintō Engi'' (諏訪神道縁起),&lt;ref&gt;''Suwa Jinja Engi'' (諏訪神社縁起 上下卷), in {{cite book |editor1-last=Suwa Kyōikukai |title=諏訪史料叢書 巻26 (Suwa Shiryō Soshō, vol. 26) |date=1937 |publisher=Suwa Kōikukai |pages=54-64 |url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1185900/41}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the Suwa deity is identified as the son of Kibonnō (貴飯王), the son of Amṛtodana (甘呂飯王 ''Kanrobonnō''), one of Siṃhahanu's four sons. The Lower Shrine's goddess, meanwhile, is the daughter of [[Pasenadi|Prasenajit]] (波斯匿王 ''Hashinoku-ō''), claimed here to be the son of Dronodana (黒飯王 ''Kokubonnō''), another son of Siṃhananu.&lt;ref&gt;Miyachi (1931b). p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====The ''Suwa Mishirushibumi''=====

During the Misayama festival as performed during the medieval period, the ''Ōhōri'' recited a [[Norito|ritual declaration]] supposedly composed by the Suwa deity himself known as the ''Suwa Mishirushibumi'' (陬波御記文),&lt;ref&gt;Text and commentary in Kanai (1982). pp. 162-172.&lt;/ref&gt; which begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I, Great King Suwa (陬波大王), have hidden my person during [[Sexagenary cycle|[the year/month/day of] the Yang Wood Horse]] (甲午 ''kinoe-uma'').&lt;br /&gt;
[The name] 'Suwa' (陬波) and [the sign] Yang Wood Horse [and] the seal (印文){{efn|The 'seal' referred to here is interpreted to be either the Upper Shrine's sacred seal made of deer antler&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Mishirushibumi'' itself.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuda; Nihonmatsu; Tokuda, eds. (2015). pp. 117-118.&lt;/ref&gt;}} - these three are all one and the same.{{efn|「陬波大王　限甲午隠身、陬波与甲午　印文同一物三名。」&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Yabusame00.jpg|thumb|left|[[Yabusame]] archers in hunting gear, Edo period]]
Within the text, King Suwa (i.e. Suwa Myōjin) declares the ''Ōhōri'' to be his 'true [[Shintai|body]]' (真神体 ''shin no shintai'') and the Misayama (三斎山) hunting grounds below Yatsugatake (here likened to [[Vulture Peak]] in India) to be another manifestation of himself that cleanses (斎) the three (三) evils: [[Manasa, vacha, karmana|evil thoughts, evil speech and evil actions]].&lt;ref&gt;Fukuda; Nihonmatsu; Tokuda, eds. (2015). pp. 119-120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). pp. 168-169.&lt;/ref&gt; He promises that whoever sets foot at Misayama will not fall into [[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)#Realms of rebirth|the lower, evil realms of existence]] (悪趣 ''akushu''); conversely, the god condemns and disowns whoever defiles this place by cutting down its trees or digging out the soil.&lt;ref name="Kanai169"&gt;Kanai (1982). p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commentary on the ''Mishirushibumi'', the ''Suwa Shichū'' (陬波私注 "Personal Notes on the ''Suwa Mishirusibumi''," written 1313-1314),&lt;ref name="KanaiShichu"&gt;Text and commentary in Kanai (1982). pp. 173-187.&lt;/ref&gt; elaborates on the text by retelling the legend of Suwa Myōjin's consecration of his first priest:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Daimyōjin was born during [the year/month/day of] the Yang Wood Horse and disappeared during [the year/month/day of] the Yang Wood Horse.&lt;br /&gt;
Sokutan Daijin (続旦大臣) was the Daimyōjin's uncle who accompanied him from India. When the Daimyōjin was to disappear, he took off his garments, put them on the Daijin, and dubbed him the ''Misogihōri'' (御衣木法理). He then pronounced a vow: "You shall consider this priest to be my body."{{efn|「一、大明神甲午&lt;sub&gt;仁&lt;/sub&gt;有御誕生甲午&lt;sub&gt;仁&lt;/sub&gt;隠御身給&lt;sub&gt;フ&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
一、続旦（ソクタン）大臣&lt;small&gt;ト&lt;/small&gt;申&lt;small&gt;ハ&lt;/small&gt;大明神&lt;small&gt;ノ&lt;/small&gt;叔父御前自&lt;sub&gt;リ&lt;/sub&gt;天竺御同道、大明神御体&lt;sub&gt;ヲ&lt;/sub&gt;隠&lt;sub&gt;サセ&lt;/sub&gt;給&lt;sub&gt;シ&lt;/sub&gt;時御装束ヲ奉抜著（ヌキキセ）彼大臣給&lt;small&gt;テ&lt;/small&gt;号御衣木（ミソキ）法理&lt;small&gt;ト&lt;/small&gt; 我之躰以法理&lt;small&gt;ヲ&lt;/small&gt;躰&lt;small&gt;ト&lt;/small&gt;セヨトハ誓給&lt;sub&gt;シ&lt;/sub&gt;也」&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). pp. 173-174.&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same text identifies the god's uncle Sokutan Daijin with Arikazu.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuda; Nihonmatsu; Tokuda, eds. (2015). pp. 117, 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). pp. 176-177.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|「一、御衣木法理殿御実名&lt;sub&gt;ハ&lt;/sub&gt;者有員&lt;sub&gt;云〻&lt;/sub&gt;」&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====As Kōga Saburō====

{{see also|Kōga Saburō}}

[[File:Tateshina03.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mount Tateshina]] on the border of the municipalities of [[Chino, Nagano|Chino]] and [[Tateshina, Nagano|Tateshina]] in [[Nagano Prefecture]].]]
A popular story promulgated by wandering preachers associated with the shrines of Suwa during the medieval period claimed the Suwa deity to have originally been a man who temporarily became a dragon or a snake after a journey into the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1987). pp. 51-54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BreenTeeuwen2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Breen|author2=Mark Teeuwen|title=Shinto in History: Ways of the Kami|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MADlfH002mAC&amp;pg=PA35|date=January 2000|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-2363-4|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blacker2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carmen Blacker|title=The Catalpa Bow: A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mR6PAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA134|date=2 August 2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1-135-31872-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). pp. 278–317.&lt;/ref&gt; Many variants on the basic story exist; the following summary is based on the earliest literary version of the tale found in the ''[[Shintoshu|Shintōshū]]''.&lt;ref name="SuwaEngi"&gt;諏訪縁起の事 (''Suwa engi-no-koto'') in {{cite book|author=Kishi, Shōzō (trans.)|title=Shintōshū (神道集)|series=Tōyō Bunko (東洋文庫) vol. 94|date=1967|publisher=Heibonsha|isbn=978-4-582-80094-4|pages=238–286}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kanai17"&gt;Kanai (1982). p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third son of a local [[Jitō|landlord]] of [[Kōka District, Shiga|Kōka District]] in [[Ōmi Province]], a distinguished warrior named Kōga Saburō Yorikata (甲賀三郎諏方) was searching for his lost wife, Princess Kasuga (春日姫 ''Kasuga-hime'') in a cave in [[Mount Tateshina]] in Shinano, with his two elder brothers. The second brother, who was jealous of Saburō's prowess and fame and who coveted Kasuga, traps the latter inside the cave after they had rescued the princess.

With no way out, Saburō has no other choice but to go deeper into the cave, which was actually an entrance to various underground realms filled with many wonders. After [[Katabasis#Trip into the underworld|travelling through these subterranean lands for a long period of time]], he finally finds his way back to the surface, only to find himself transformed into a giant snake or dragon. With the help of Buddhist monks (who turn out to be gods in disguise), Saburō regains his human form and is finally reunited with his wife. Saburō eventually becomes Suwa Myōjin, the god of the Upper Shrine of Suwa, while his wife becomes the goddess of the Lower Shrine.&lt;ref name="SuwaEngi" /&gt;

This version of the legend explains the origin of the name 'Suwa' (諏訪 or 諏方) via [[folk etymology]] as being derived from Saburō's personal name, Yorikata (諏方).&lt;ref&gt;Kishi (trans.) (1967). p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proposed that the Kōga Saburō legend arose as a result of the collapse of the Kamakura shogunate and the downfall of the [[Hōjō clan]], which the Suwa clan had faithfully served as [[Gokenin|retainers]]. The status and prestige of the ''Ōhōri'' having been diminished in the aftermath of these events, localized stories about Suwa Myōjin such as that of Kōga Saburō began to circulate among devotees of the Suwa cult.&lt;ref&gt;Fukuda; Nihonmatsu; Tokuda, eds. (2015). pp. 130-132.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrival in Suwa===

Both the official records of the central Yamato government and local myths agree in portraying the god of Suwa as an outsider who migrated into the region.&lt;ref&gt;Grumbach (2005). pp. 155-156.&lt;/ref&gt; Stories of how Suwa Myōjin arrived in Suwa and established himself therein are related below.

====Entering Shinano====

[[File:Ikushimatarushima-jinja torii.JPG|thumb|200px|Ikushima-Tarushima Shrine (生島足島神社) in [[Ueda, Nagano|Ueda City]]]]
One folk story relates that Takeminakata, upon being driven away from Izumo, first went to visit his mother Nunakawahime in [[Koshi Province|Koshi]] before proceeding southwards into Shinano. Upon reaching Azumi (modern [[Kitaazumi District]]) on the northernmost part of the province, the local deity would not let him through the pass of Sanosaka (modern [[Hakuba, Nagano|Hakuba Village]]). Takeminakata temporarily retreated to Mount Minekata (also in Hakuba), where messengers sent by the gods Ikushima-no-Kami (生島神) and Tarushima-no-Kami (足島神) arranged safe passage for him into the province.&lt;ref&gt;Imai (1976). p. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

En route to Suwa, Takeminakata visited the gods Ikushima and Tarushima in what is now [[Ueda, Nagano|the city of Ueda]] and offered them [[Congee|gruel]].&lt;ref&gt;Kobuzoku Kenkyūkai, ed. (2017b). p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ono-jinja (Shiojiri) keidai.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Ono Shrine (小野神社) in [[Shiojiri, Nagano|Shiojiri]]]]
Before entering Suwa, Takeminakata stayed for some time in what is now Ono Shrine in [[Shiojiri, Nagano|Shiojiri]], as he tried to find a way to defeat the god Moreya.&lt;ref&gt;Imai (1976). pp. 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanigawa, ed. (1987). p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Ono Shrine's Nenjiribō Matsuri held in January 6th, a contest in which locals scramble for long wooden poles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=小野神社ねんじり棒祭 |url=http://www.82bunka.or.jp/bunkazai/detail.php?no=2336&amp;seq=0 |website=The Hachijuni Culture Foundation |publisher=The Hachijuni Culture Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; is claimed in legend to have been originally devised by Takeminakata and his retinue as a way to boost their morale during their stay.&lt;ref&gt;Imai (1976). p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanigawa, ed. (1987). p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Moreya====

{{see also|Moreya}}

[[File:Fujishima Shrine (藤島社).png|thumb|Fujishima Shrine (藤島社) in what is now [[Suwa City]] during the early 20th century. It is one of two 'Fujishima Shrines' associated with Suwa Myōjin's battle against Moreya; the other is located in [[Okaya, Nagano|the city of Okaya]] by the Tenryū River.]]
One god that opposed Suwa Myōjin upon his arrival in Suwa according to local myths was the god [[Moreya]] (Moriya).

Suwa Nobushige's 1249 petition relates a story from "the ancient customs" (舊貫) that the Suwa deity came down from heaven in order to take possession of the land of Moriya Daijin (守屋大臣). The conflict between the two escalated into a battle, but as no winner could be declared, the two finally compete in a [[tug of war]] using hooks (''kagi''): Suwa Myōjin, using a hook made out of the [[wisteria]] plant (藤鎰), emerges victorious against Moriya, who used an iron hook (鐵鎰). After his victory, the god built his dwelling (what would become the Upper Shrine) in Moriya's land and planted the wisteria hook, which became a grove known as the 'Forest of Fujisuwa' (藤諏訪之森 ''Fujisuwa no mori'').{{efn|「一 守屋山麓御垂跡事&lt;br&gt;

The ''Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba'' relates a variant of this myth as an origin story of Fujishima Shrine in [[Suwa, Nagano|Suwa City]], one of the Upper Shrine's [[Setsumatsusha|auxiliary shrines]] where its yearly rice-planting ceremony is traditionally held.&lt;ref name="Suwashishi681"&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). pp. 681-683.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1992). pp. 88-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fujishimayatsu"&gt;{{cite web|title=藤島社・藤島大明神|url=http://yatsu-genjin.jp/suwataisya/sanpo/hujisimasya.htm|website=諏訪大社と諏訪神社（附･神社参拝記）|publisher=八ヶ岳原人}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=諏訪大社上社「御田植祭」|url=http://yatsu-genjin.jp/suwataisya/sinji/otaue.htm|website=諏訪大社と諏訪神社（附･神社参拝記）|publisher=八ヶ岳原人}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this version, the Suwa deity defeats "Moreya the evil outlaw" with a wisteria branch:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As for this so-called Fujishima no Myōjin (藤島明神): long ago, when the revered deity (尊神 ''sonshin'') [[Honji suijaku|manifested himself]], Moreya the evil outlaw (洩矢の惡賊) sought to hinder the god's stay and fought him with an iron ring (鐵輪), but the ''Myōjin'', taking up a wisteria branch (藤の枝), defeated him, thus finally subduing heresy (邪輪 ''jarin'', lit. "wheel/circle/ring of evil") and establishing [[Dharma (Buddhism)|the true Dharma]]. When the Myōjin swore an oath and threw the wisteria branch away, immediately it took root [in the ground], its branches and leaves flourishing in abundance, and [sprouted] beautiful blossoms, leaving behind a marker of the battleground for posterity. 'Fujishima no Myōjin' is named thus for this reason.{{efn|「抑此藤島の明神と申は。尊神垂迹の昔。洩矢の惡賊神居をさまたげんとせし時。洩矢は鐵輪を持してあらそひ。明神は藤枝を取りて是を伏し給ふ。終に邪輪を降して正法を興す。明神誓を發て。藤枝をなげ給しかば。則根をさして枝葉をさかへ花蘂あざやかにして。戰場のしるしを萬代に殘す。藤島の明神と號此故也。」}}&lt;ref&gt; Hanawa, ed. (1914). p. 530.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Fujishima Shrine, Okaya City (藤島神社 岡谷市).jpg|thumb|Fujishima Shrine (藤島神社) in [[Okaya, Nagano|Okaya]]]]
The ''Suwa Daimyojin Kōshiki'' integrates this story into the legend of the king of Hadai by portraying Moreya as an incarnation of Bikyō, the rebel who raised up an army against the king in India (cf. the version in the ''Monoimi no rei'', wherein the king is opposed by a rebel named 'Moriya').&lt;ref&gt;Fukuda; Nihonmatsu; Tokuda, eds. (2015). pp. 114-115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later versions of this story which combine it with the ''kuni-yuzuri'' myth, Moreya opposes Takeminakata after the latter had fled from Izumo. After being defeated, Moreya swears fealty to Takeminakata and becomes a faithful ally.&lt;ref name="Imai1960"&gt;Imai (1960). pp. 3-15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Imai1976"&gt;Imai (1976). p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreya is reckoned as the divine ancestor of the Moriya (守矢) clan, one of the former priestly lineages of the Upper Shrine.&lt;ref name="Moriya"&gt;Moriya, Sanae (2017).

While earlier sources such as Nobushige's petition and the ''Ekotoba'' situate the battle between the two gods somewhere in the vicinity of the Upper Shrine (modern [[Suwa, Nagano|Suwa City]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=洩矢神社 岡谷市川岸橋原 |url=http://yatsu-genjin.jp/suwataisya/sanpo/moreya.htm |website=諏訪大社と諏訪神社（附･神社参拝記） |publisher=八ヶ岳原人}}&lt;/ref&gt; modern retellings instead place it on the banks of the [[Tenryū River]] (modern [[Okaya, Nagano|Okaya City]]).&lt;ref name="Imai1960" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Imai1976" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moriya" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=洩矢神社 (Moriya Shrine) |url=http://www.nagano-jinjacho.jp/shibu/04nansin/02suwa/4030.html |website=長野県神社庁 (Nagano-ken Jinjachō)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yatsukao (Ganigawara)====

Another god that is said to have opposed Suwa Myōjin and his new ally Moreya in local folklore was Yatsukao-no-Mikoto (矢塚男命), also known as Ganigawara (蟹河原長者 ''Ganigawara-chōja'').&lt;ref name="Kobuzoku79"&gt;Kobuzoku Kenkyūkai, ed. (2017b). p 79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=蟹河原 （茅野市ちの横内）|url=http://tateshina-times.jp/?p=7866|website=たてしなの時間|publisher=蓼科企画}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="suwashi-keizu"&gt;''Shinano-no-kuni Kansha Suwa-jinja Jinchōkan Moriya-ke Ryaku-keizu'' (信濃國官社諏訪神社神長官守矢家略系圖), in {{cite book|author1=Nobukawa, Kazuhiko (延川和彦)|author2=Iida, Kotaro (飯田好太郎)|title=諏訪氏系図 続編 (Suwa-shi Keizu, Zokuhen)|date=1921|page=19|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/927368/21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Moreya's defeat, Ganigawara held Moreya in contempt for surrendering to Takeminakata and had messengers publicly harass him by calling him a coward. When Ganigawara's servants began to resort to violence, Takeminakata retaliated by invading Ganigawara's turf. Mortally wounded by an arrow in the ensuing battle, Ganigawara begs forgiveness from Moreya and entrusts his youngest daughter to Takeminakata, who gives her in marriage to the god Taokihooi-no-Mikoto (手置帆負命) a.k.a.

====Other deities====

A few scattered local legends make reference to other deities who either submitted to the Suwa deity or refused to do so.

In one legend, a god named Takei-Ōtomonushi (武居大伴主 or 武居大友主) swore allegiance to Suwa Myōjin and became the ancestor of a line of priests in the Lower Shrine known as the ''Takeihōri'' (武居祝).&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1987). p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kobuzoku79" /&gt; Another story relates that the Suwa deity forbade the goddess of Sakinomiya Shrine in Owa, [[Suwa, Nagano|Suwa City]] from building a bridge over the creek before her shrine as punishment for her refusal to submit to him.&lt;ref name="Kobuzoku79" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=先宮神社 |url=https://www.jinriki.info/kaidolist/koshukaido/kamisuwa_shimosuwa/sakinomiyajinja.html |website=人力（じんりき）- 旧街道ウォーキング}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subduing the toad god===

Two texts, the ''Monoimi no rei''&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). pp. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Takei (1999), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Suwa Shichū'' (陬波私注 "Personal Notes on the ''Suwa Mishirusibumi''," written 1313-1314),&lt;ref name="KanaiShichu"&gt;Text and commentary in Kanai (1982). pp. 173-187.&lt;/ref&gt; mention an oral legend about Suwa Myōjin pacifying the waves of the [[Four Seas|four seas]] by subduing an unruly and savage [[toad]] god (蝦蟆神).{{efn|「正一月日之蝦蟆狩之事　蝦蟆神成　大荒神　惱乱天下時、大明神彼&lt;sub&gt;ヲ&lt;/sub&gt;退治御座&lt;sub&gt;し&lt;/sub&gt;時、四海静謐之間、陬波&lt;sub&gt;卜&lt;/sub&gt;云字&lt;sub&gt;ヲ&lt;/sub&gt;波陬なりと讀り、口傅多し」(''Monoimi no rei'')

:The term 'Suwa' (陬波) means (lit. 'is read as') "a corner wave" (''namishizuka'', i.e. a wave lapping onto the sea's edge&lt;ref&gt;Takei (1999), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;). Many oral legends exist [about this event].}}{{efn|「一、陬波&lt;sub&gt;ト&lt;/sub&gt;申事&lt;sub&gt;ナミシツカナリトヨメリ&lt;/sub&gt;　蝦蟆&lt;sub&gt;カニタ&lt;/sub&gt;神&lt;sup&gt;カエルノ事ナリ&lt;/sup&gt;荒神惱&lt;sub&gt;ト&lt;/sub&gt;天下時、大明神退治之御坐時 四海静謐之間 陬波&lt;sub&gt;卜云〻&lt;/sub&gt; 口傅在之」(''Suwa Shichū'')}} After defeating the toad, Suwa Myōjin then blocked the way to its dwelling - a hole leading to the underwater palace of the [[Ryūjin|dragon god of the sea]], the [[Ryūgū-jō]] - with a rock and sat on it (御座石 ''Goza-ishi'' or 石(之)御座 ''ishi no goza'' "stone seat").{{efn|「一、御座石&lt;sub&gt;ト&lt;/sub&gt;申&lt;sub&gt;ハ&lt;/sub&gt;正面之内&lt;sub&gt;二&lt;/sub&gt;在&lt;sub&gt;リ&lt;/sub&gt;、件之蝦蟆神之住所之穴通龍宮城&lt;sub&gt;エ&lt;/sub&gt;、退治蝦蟆神、破穴以石塞其&lt;sub&gt;ノ&lt;/sub&gt;上坐玉&lt;sub&gt;シ&lt;/sub&gt;間、名&lt;sub&gt;ヲ&lt;/sub&gt;石之御座&lt;sub&gt;ト&lt;/sub&gt;申也 口傅在之」(''Monoimi no rei'')

This story functions as an [[Etiology|etiological legend]] for the annual sacrifice of frogs held every [[Japanese New Year|New Year's Day]] in the Suwa ''Kamisha'' ([[Takeminakata#As god of hunting|see below]])&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1992). p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; as well as yet another [[folk etymology]] for the toponym 'Suwa', here explained as deriving from a term for a wave lapping onto the sea's edge (陬波 ''namishizuka'').&lt;ref name="Kanai177178"&gt;Kanai (1982). pp. 177-178.&lt;/ref&gt;

The portrayal of Suwa Myōjin's enemy as a toad or a frog also hints at Suwa Myōjin's character as a serpentine water god, frogs being preyed upon by snakes.&lt;ref name="Kanai177178" /&gt; (As a point of comparison, the obscure snake god [[Ugajin]] was also credited with defeating a malevolent frog deity.&lt;ref name="Hara2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hara|first1=Naomasa|title=龍蛇神: 諏訪大明神の中世的展開 (Ryūjashin: Suwa Daimyōjin no chūseiteki tenkai)|date=2012|publisher=Ningensha|isbn=978-4931388710|pages=40-41|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The toad god itself has been interpreted either as representing the native deities [[Mishaguji]] and/or Moreya, with its defeat symbolizing the victory of the cult of Suwa Myōjin over the indigenous belief system,&lt;ref&gt;Takei (1999). pp. 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; or as a symbol of the Buddhist concept of the [[three poisons]] (ignorance, greed, and hatred), which Suwa Myōjin, as [[Honji suijaku|an incarnation]] of the bodhisattva [[Samantabhadra]], his esoteric aspect [[Vajrasattva]] and the [[Wisdom King]] [[Trailokyavijaya]] (interpreted as a form of Vajrasattva), is said to destroy.&lt;ref name="Hara2012" /&gt;

The current whereabouts of the ''Goza-ishi'' is unclear. The ''Monoimi no rei'' claims it to have been located "within the ''Shōmen''" (正面之内ニ在リ, i.e. the 'upper plateau' (上壇 ''jōdan'') of the ''Kamisha Honmiya'' where the inner sanctum is) and reckons it as one of seven sacred stones or rocks (七石 ''nana-ishi'') associated with the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;Hara (2012). p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=諏訪七石「小玉石・児玉石」|url=http://yatsu-genjin.jp/suwataisya/sanpo/suwa7isi.htm|website=諏訪大社と諏訪神社（附･神社参拝記）|publisher=八ヶ岳原人}}&lt;/ref&gt; While three of the seven stones are indeed located within the ''Kamisha Honmiya''&lt;nowiki /&gt; - the ''Suzuri-ishi'' (硯石),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=硯石（諏訪七石）|url=http://yatsu-genjin.jp/suwataisya/zatugaku/iwakura.htm|website=諏訪大社と諏訪神社（附･神社参拝記）|publisher=八ヶ岳原人}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''(O)kutsu-ishi'' (御沓石),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=御沓石（諏訪七石）|url=http://yatsu-genjin.jp/suwataisya/zatugaku/okutu.htm|website=諏訪大社と諏訪神社（附･神社参拝記）|publisher=八ヶ岳原人}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Kaeru-ishi'' (蛙石)&lt;ref name="Kaeru"&gt;{{cite web|title=「蛙石」諏訪七石|url=http://yatsu-genjin.jp/suwataisya/zatugaku/kaeru.htm|website=諏訪大社と諏訪神社（附･神社参拝記）|publisher=八ヶ岳原人}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Kabuto-ishi'' (甲石) - none of these are currently referred to as ''Goza-ishi''.&lt;ref&gt;Hara (2012). p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gozaishi"&gt;{{cite web|title=「御座石」 諏訪七石|url=http://yatsu-genjin.jp/suwataisya/zatugaku/gozaisi.htm|website=諏訪大社と諏訪神社（附･神社参拝記）|publisher=八ヶ岳原人}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, attempts have been made to identify the ''Goza-ishi'' with any one of these three rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Hara (2012). pp. 65-71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hara (2012) proposes the ''Goza-ishi'' to have been the same rock as the ''Kaeru-ishi'' / ''Kabuto-ishi'' (the precise location of which is itself under dispute), noting that two sources from the [[Edo period]] both claim the ''Kaeru-ishi'' to be beneath a stone [[pagoda]] once located in the inner sanctum known as the ''Tettō'' (鉄塔 "[[Vajrasattva#Shingon Buddhism|iron tower]]"; [[Takeminakata#Under shinbutsu-shūgō|see below]]), considered before the [[Shinbutsu bunri|separation of Buddhism and Shinto]] in the [[Meiji period]] to be the physical 'body' (''[[Shintai|go-shintai]]'') of the god of Suwa and the ''Kamisha''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s main object of worship,&lt;ref name="Inoue349350" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hara6971"&gt;Hara (2012). p. 69-71.&lt;/ref&gt; and that the 18th-century traveller and [[ethnologist]] Sugae Masumi (菅江真澄, 1754-1829&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Louis Frédéric|translator=Roth, Käthe|title=Japan Encyclopedia|date=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674017535|page=908|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA908}}&lt;/ref&gt;) reported that the frogs sacrificed during the New Year's Day ritual were offered up to an ''iwakura'' (磐座, a 'rock-throne' or sacred rock) in the shrine.&lt;ref name="Hara6971" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaeru" /&gt;

===Travel to Izumo===

According to a local folktale, Suwa Myōjin is one of the very few ''kami'' in Japan who do not leave their shrines during the month of [[Kannazuki]], when most gods are thought to gather at [[Izumo Province]] and thus are absent from most of the country.

The folktale relates that Suwa Myōjin once came to Izumo in the form of a dragon so gigantic that only his head can be seen; his tail was still at Suwa, caught in a tall pine tree by the shores of the lake. The other gods, upon seeing him, were so astounded and frightened at his enormous size that they exempted him from attending their yearly meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Matsutani, Miyoko (1960). ''Shinano no minwa'' (信濃の民話). Miraisha. p. 48, cited in Kanai (1982). p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shinano no kuni no Kannazuki (信濃の国の神無月)|url=http://minwa.fujipan.co.jp/area/nagano_012/|website=Fuji Baking Co., Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The supposed tree where the dragon's tail was caught (currently reduced to a stump) is locally known as ''Okakematsu'' ({{nihongo|尾掛松}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Okakematsu (尾掛松)|url=http://suwaarea-examine.com/okakematu.html|website=Mahoroba Suwa-ken (まほろば諏訪圏)|access-date=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of this story transposes the setting from Izumo to the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]] in [[Kyoto]]; in this version, the various ''kami'' are said to travel to the ancient capital every [[Japanese New Year|New Year's Day]] to greet the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Ōbayashi, Taryō (1987).

===''Omiwatari''===

[[Pressure ridge (ice)|Cracks and ridges]] that form on a frozen [[Lake Suwa]] during cold winters have traditionally been interpreted as the trail left behind by Suwa Myōjin as he leaves the ''Kamisha'' and crosses the lake to meet his wife enshrined on the ''Shimosha'' on the opposite (northern) shore.&lt;ref name="railways1922"&gt;{{cite book|author=Japan.

===As god of war===

====Apparition to Sakanoue no Tamuramaro====
The association of Suwa Myōjin with warfare and hunting is most apparent in another legend about his apparition to the general [[Sakanoue no Tamuramaro]] during the latter's campaign to subjugate the [[Emishi]] of northeastern Japan.&lt;ref name="NobushigeGejo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;諏訪大明神秋山祭の事 (''Suwa Daimyōjin Akiyama-sai no koto''), in Kishi (1967). pp. 49–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Konishi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Konishi|first1=Jin'ichi|title=A History of Japanese Literature, Volume 3: The High Middle Ages|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1400861828|page=526|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szAABAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA526}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following summary is based on the version found in the ''Ekotoba''.&lt;ref name="Hanawa"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Hanawa|title=''Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba''|date=1914|pages=499–501|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/936498/47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kanai225226"&gt;Kanai (1982). pp. 225-226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamashita1314"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yamashita|first1=Masaharu|title=訓読・諏訪大明神絵詞 (一) (Kundoku: Suwa Daimyojjn Ekotoba 01)|journal=Annual report of the Institute of Cultural Sciences, Risshō University|date=2006|issue=16|pages=13–14|url=http://ci.nii.ac.jp/els/110007324031.pdf?id=ART0009178568&amp;type=pdf&amp;lang=jp&amp;host=cinii&amp;order_no=&amp;ppv_type=0&amp;lang_sw=&amp;no=1365910179&amp;cp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sakanoue Tamuramaro.jpg|thumb|216px|right|Sakanoue no Tamuramaro is credited with instituting the religious festivities of Suwa-taisha after the god of Suwa came to his aid during the campaigns against the Emishi peoples.]]

During the reign of [[Emperor Kanmu]], an Emishi chief named Abe no Takamaru (安倍高丸) staged a rebellion against the imperial court. The emperor, in response, appointed Sakanoue no Tamuramaro as ''[[Shōgun|Sei-i Taishōgun]]'', sending him to [[Mutsu Province|Ōshū]] to quell the Emishi threat. Knowing that Takamaru cannot be defeated without divine aid, Tamuramaro prays to Suwa Myōjin for victory. As he and his troops [[Tōsandō|were passing by]] the [[Ina, Nagano|Ina]] and Suwa districts of Shinano Province, a warrior riding a dapple horse – Suwa Myōjin in disguise – joins their company.&lt;ref name="Hanawa" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamashita1314" /&gt;

Upon arriving at Takamaru's impregnable stronghold by the sea, the horseman from Shinano miraculously splits into five identical mounted warriors (the manifestations of Suwa Myōjin's thirteen divine children), while twenty men dressed in yellow (the god's attendants) appear from out of nowhere. The horsemen and the men in yellow then begin to hold a ''[[yabusame]]'' ([[mounted archery]]) competition over the surface of the sea, which succeeds in luring Takamaru out of hiding. The horseman then blinds Takamaru with his last remaining arrow as the twenty men in yellow proceed to capture and behead him, mounting his head onto a spear.&lt;ref name="Hanawa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kanai225226" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamashita1314" /&gt;

On the return journey, the warrior's horse suddenly rises into the air as the rider assumes the aspect of a deity attired in [[Sokutai|court dress]].&lt;ref name="Konishi" /&gt; He then announces to the company his true identity as the god of Suwa and his love of hunting. Tamuramaro questions why the god revels in such an activity that involves taking the lives of sentient beings, to which Suwa Myōjin gives an explanation to the effect that being hunted and killed actually helps sinful and [[Moha (Buddhism)|ignorant]] animals to reach [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. He then bequeaths to Tamuramaro a written [[dhāraṇī]] - probably a reference to the ''Suwa Mishirushibumi''&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; - and finally disappears. In accordance with Suwa Myōjin's request, Tamuramaro then petitions the court to institute the religious festivals of the shrines of Suwa.&lt;ref name="Hanawa" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yamashita1314" /&gt;

====Repelling the Mongol invasions====

Suwa Myōjin has also been credited with repelling the attempted [[Mongol invasions of Japan]] under [[Kublai Khan]].

The ''[[Taiheiki]]'' recounts a story where a five-colored cloud resembling a serpent (a manifestation of Suwa Myōjin) rose up from [[Lake Suwa]] and spread away westward to assist the Japanese army against the Mongols.{{efn|「如此御祈祷已に七日満じける日、諏訪の湖の上より、五色の雲西に聳き、大蛇の形に見へたり。八幡御宝殿の扉啓けて、馬の馳ちる音、轡の鳴音、虚空に充満たり。日吉の社二十一社の錦帳の鏡動き、神宝刃とがれて、御沓皆西に向へり。住吉四所の神馬鞍の下に汗流れ、小守・勝手の鉄の楯己と立て敵の方につき双べたり。」

:On the seventh day, when the Imperial devotions were completed, from Lake Suwa there arose a cloud of many colours, in shape like a great serpent, which spread away towards the west. The doors of the Temple-treasury of [[Hachiman]] flew open, and the skies were filled with a sound of galloping horses and of ringing bits.

==Analysis==

===Takeminakata's absence in other Izumo-related contexts===

Takeminakata's rather abrupt appearance in the ''Kojiki''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s version of the ''kuni-yuzuri'' myth has long puzzled scholars, as the god is mentioned nowhere else in the work, including the genealogy of Ōkuninushi's progeny that precedes the ''kuni-yuzuri'' narrative proper.&lt;ref&gt;Chamberlain (1882). [http://sacred-texts.com/shi/kj/kj033.htm Section XXVI.—The Deities the August Descendants of the Deity Master-of-the-Great-Land.]&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the parallel account contained in the ''Kuji Hongi'' (which was itself based on the ''Kojiki''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s&lt;ref name="Suwashishi2"&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). pp. 684-685, 687.&lt;/ref&gt;), he is altogether absent from the ''Nihon Shoki''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s version of the myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|Nihongi: Chronicles of Japan from the Earliest Times to A.D. 697|chapter=Book II|author=Aston, William George|date=1896|pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1987). p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, early sources from Izumo such as the province's ''[[Fudoki]]'' also fail to mention any god named '(Take)minakata'; neither is there any trace of such a deity being worshipped in Izumo in antiquity.&lt;ref name="Suwashishi2" /&gt;

Pre-modern authors such as [[Motoori Norinaga]] tended to explain Takeminakata's absence outside of the ''Kojiki'' and the ''Kuji Hongi'' by conflating the god with certain obscure deities found in other sources thought to share certain similar characteristics (e.g. [[Isetsuhiko]]).&lt;ref name="Norinaga3"&gt;Motoori, Norinaga (1937). [http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/1109355/81 古事記傳 (''Kojiki-den''), vol. 14] in Motoori Toyokai (ed.), 本居宣長全集 (''Motoori Norinaga Zenshū''), vol. 2. Tokyo: Yoshikawa Kōbunkan. pp. 683–684. (Original work written 1764–1798)&lt;/ref&gt; While some modern scholars still suppose some kind of connection between the deity and Izumo by postulating that Takeminakata's origins lie either in peoples that migrated from Izumo northwards to Suwa and the [[Hokuriku region]]&lt;ref&gt;Muraoka (1969). pp. 60-66.&lt;/ref&gt; or in Hokuriku itself (a region once under Izumo's [[sphere of influence]]), specifically in [[Echigo Province]] (modern [[Niigata Prefecture]]),&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; others, in light of the aforementioned silence, think it more likely that the connection between Takeminakata and Izumo was an artificial construct by the ''Kojiki''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s compilers.&lt;ref name="Yoshii" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Matsumae"&gt;{{cite book|author=Matsumae, Takeshi|title=Nihon shinwa no nazo ga yoku wakaru hon (日本神話の謎がよく分かる本)|date=2007|publisher=Daiwa Shobō (大和書房)|isbn=978-4-479-39166-1|pages=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suwashishi2" /&gt;

===The Yamato state's expansion into Suwa===

Yamato rule is thought to have entered Suwa from the south (the modern districts of [[Kamiina District, Nagano|Kamiina]] and [[Shimoina District, Nagano|Shimoina]]) somewhere around the latter half of the 6th century.&lt;ref name="Suwashishi686"&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). "Suwa-jinja Kamisha Shimosha (諏訪神社上社・下社)". p. 686.&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of corridor-type (横穴式石室 ''yokoana-shiki sekishitsu'') ''[[kofun]]'' in the region, markedly different from the mounds (thought to be the tombs of influential local priest-chiefs) built on the southern side of [[Lake Suwa]] - the site of the Suwa ''Kamisha'' - during the 5th-6th centuries, which were characterized by ditches surrounding the burial area, are taken to be the signs of the expansion of the Yamato state in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Oh (2011). pp. 160-163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suwashishi686" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miyasaka920811"/&gt;

The ''Kuji Hongi''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Keizai Zasshisha|title=国史大系 第7巻 (Kokushi-taikei, vol. 7)|date=1898|publisher=Keizai Zasshisha|location=Tokyo|page=413|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/991097/220}}&lt;/ref&gt; mentions a grandson (or descendant) of Kamuyaimimi-no-Mikoto (a son of [[Emperor Jimmu]]), Takeiotatsu-no-Mikoto, (建五百建命) who was appointed the governor or ''[[kuni no miyatsuko]]'' of Shinano (科野国造) during the reign of [[Emperor Sujin]] (traditionally dated to the 1st century BCE but most likely somewhere around the 4th century CE&lt;ref&gt;Hall, ed. (1988). p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The ''Ihon Aso-shi keizu'', of disputed historicity, ([[Takeminakata#The_Misogi-hōri|see above]]) claims that Takeiotatsu's descendant, Kaneyumi-no-kimi (金弓君), served as ''toneri'' (舎人, attendant or palace guard) of the [[Emperor Kinmei]] (reigned 539-571) in his palace, the Kanasashi-no-miya (金刺宮) in modern-day [[Sakurai, Nara|Sakurai City]], [[Nara Prefecture]], receiving the ''[[kabane]]'' ''atai'' (直) from said emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). p. 615.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Kaneyumi's sons, Mase-gimi (麻背君), who became the ''kuni no miyatsuko'' of Shinano (reestablished for the first time in a few generations), had two sons: the first, Kuratari (倉足), was appointed the administrator (''[[Districts of Japan|kōri no kami''/''hyōtoku]]'') of Suwa district (諏訪評督), while the second, Otoei or Kumako (see [[Takeminakata#The Misogi-no-hōri|above]]), became the priest or ''ōhōri'' of the god of Suwa (諏訪大神大祝).&lt;ref name="Rekishi40"&gt;Rekishi REAL Henshūbu, ed. (2016). p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1992). p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). pp. 106-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turnover of authority===

{{see also|Mishaguji|Suwa clan}}

The Suwa region during the late [[Yayoi period]] was thought to have been originally populated by autonomous [[village communities]], the chiefs of which also functioned as the ritual heads of their respective communities. These villages were eventually united under a single leader who governed the religious practices of these communities, which were centered around the worship of the god(s) [[Mishaguji]],&lt;ref&gt;Oh (2011). pp. 155-163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suwashishi2" /&gt; spirits that were thought to descend upon and [[Animism|inhabit natural objects]] [[List of nature deities|like trees or rocks]] and function as [[List of fertility deities|life-giving]] [[Genius loci|guardians]] of local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1987). pp. 23–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanigawa (1987). pp. 191–194.&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend of the battle between the god [[Moreya]] and Suwa Myōjin ([[Takeminakata#Arrival in Suwa|see above]]) may suggest that the advent of Yamato rule in Suwa during the late 6th century was initially met with resistance, especially on the southern side of Lake Suwa, the stronghold of the indigenous Mishaguji cult.&lt;ref name="Suwashishi686" /&gt; This intransigence was ultimately quelled, and politico-religious rule over the region was soon turned over from an indigenous lineage of priest-chiefs, what would later become known as the Moriya clan (守矢氏), to Yamato-appointed authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). pp. 620-623, 683-688, 694.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miyasaka920811"&gt;Miyasaka (1992). pp. 8-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was probably around this time that the [[Shamanism|shamanistic]] concept of the ''misogi-hōri''/''ōhōri'',  the physical manifestation of an invisible divinity, came into being as a way to subsume native religious practices into the Yamato belief system.&lt;ref name="Miyasaka920811" /&gt; The office of ''ōhōri'' was probably meant to rival that of the ''okō'' (神使), a young boy (or boys) who became vessels for Mishaguji during religious rituals who later became interpreted as representatives of the ''ōhōri''.&lt;ref name="Owa197"&gt;Ōwa (1990). p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oh (2011). p. 170-175.&lt;/ref&gt; The priest-chieftain of the Moriya clan meanwhile was integrated into the new system as the ''kan no osa''/''jinchō'' (神長) or ''jinchōkan'' (神長官), the sole priest who could call upon Mishaguji.&lt;ref&gt;Oh (2011). p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Moriya's submission to and cooperation with the new system enabled the local Mishaguji cult to survive underneath it: while officially subservient to the ''ōhōri'', in reality the Moriya ''jinchōkan'', who presided over religious rites, continued to hold actual power while the ''ōhōri'' was but a symbolic figurehead.&lt;ref&gt;Oh (2011). p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ōhōri''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s investiture ceremony even involved the ''jinchōkan'' summoning Mishaguji to enter the young candidate's body during the ritual; it is only by being possessed by Mishaguji that the candidate became a god himself.&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1987). p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Owa197" /&gt;

===The rise of Takeminakata===

Both the Aso and the Suwa clan genealogies refer to the foundation of a sanctuary (社壇) on the southern side of Lake Suwa (where the Suwa ''Kamisha'' currently stands) by Otoei/Kumako, claimed to be in both sources as the first ''ōhōri'', where the "great god of Suwa" (諏訪大神) and other divinities were worshipped in the third month of the second year of the [[Emperor Yōmei]] (587 CE).{{efn|「乙頴 (諏訪大神大祝)：一名神子、又云、熊古　生而八歳、御名方富命大神化現脱着御衣於神子勅曰、吾無体以汝為体、盤余池辺大宮朝二年丁未三月構壇于湖南山麓、祭諏訪大明神及百八十神、奉千代田刺忌串斎之」}}&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1992). p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). pp. 619-620.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ono-Yasumaro.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Ō no Yasumaro by [[Kikuchi Yōsai]] (19th century)]]In 691 CE, the ''Nihon Shoki'' refers to envoys of the Yamato court going to [[Shinano Province]] to worship "the gods of Suwa and Minochi"(須波水内等神). This reference suggests that the cult of the ''ōhōri'' and the sanctuary at Suwa had become established and influential enough to attract attention from the Yamato imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). p. 623.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suwa694"&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). p. 694.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just twenty years after this, the name '(Take)minakata(tomi)' - which may have originated as a name for (the deity manifest in) the ''ōhōri''&lt;ref&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). p. 686, 693-694.&lt;/ref&gt; - appears in the historical record for the first time in the ''Kojiki'' (711–712 CE).&lt;ref name="Suwa687" /&gt; Due to the absence of Takeminakata in other sources dealing with Izumo, it is thought that the god was interpolated into the ''Kojiki'' by its chief compiler, [[Ō no Yasumaro]], who may have either adapted a preexisting myth or created one outright.&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1987). pp. 17–26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ōwa (1990). pp. 212–214.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oh (2011). pp. 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suwa687"&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). pp. 687–689.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars believe various factors were at play for Takeminakata's introduction in the ''Kojiki''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s narrative - one being that Yasumaro's clan, the Ō (太氏; also written variously as 多, 意富, or 於保), were distantly related to the clan who ruled the Suwa region, the Kanasashi-no-toneri (金刺舎人), in that both were supposedly descendants of Kamuyaimimi-no-Mikoto:&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1987). p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ōwa (1990). pp. 213, 220-222.&lt;/ref&gt; Takeminakata's inclusion in the ''Kojiki'' was thus a means to advertise the 'new' god of the Kanasashi.&lt;ref&gt;Ōwa (1990). p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible reason was the special interest [[Emperor Tenmu]] (the one who commissioned both the ''Kojiki'' and the ''Nihon Shoki'') showed to Shinano: the ''Nihon Shoki'' speaks of Tenmu sending envoys to inspect the province "perhaps with the object of having a capital there" in the thirteenth year of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|Nihongi: Chronicles of Japan from the Earliest Times to A.D. 697|chapter=Book XXIX|author=Aston, William George|date=1896|pages=362, 364}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the ''Kojiki'' does not yet explicitly mention the worship of Takeminakata in Suwa, by the following century, we see the name applied to the god worshipped in what is now the Grand Shrine of Suwa: aside from the ''Kuji Hongi''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s (807-936 CE) reference to Takeminakata being enshrined in 'Suwa Shrine in Suwa [[Districts of Japan|District]]'&lt;ref name="Hongi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hongi2" /&gt; the ''[[Shoku Nihon Kōki]]'' mentions the deity 'Minakatatomi-no-Kami of Suwa District, Shinano Province' (信濃国諏訪郡 ... 南方刀美神) being promoted from rankless (无位) to junior fifth rank, lower grade (従五位下) by the imperial court in the year 842 CE ([[Jōwa (Heian period)|Jōwa]] 9).{{efn|「丁未。奉授信濃國諏方郡无位勳八等南方刀美神從五位下。」}}&lt;ref name="Shoku1"&gt;{{cite web|title=續日本後紀|url=http://www.j-texts.com/chuko/shokukouki.html|website=J－TEXTS 日本文学電子図書館}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shoku2"&gt;{{cite wikisource |chapter=卷第十一|wslink=zh:續日本後紀|plaintitle=''[[Shoku Nihon Kōki]]'' (續日本後紀)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Database"&gt;{{cite web|title=南方刀美神社二座（建御名方富命神）|url=http://21coe.kokugakuin.ac.jp/db/jinja/kindex2.php?J_ID=240101|website=神社資料データベース (Shinto Jinja Database)|publisher=Kokugakuin University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suwa689"&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). p. 689.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 850-60s, Takeminakata and his shrine rose very rapidly in rank (''[[Nihon Montoku Tennō Jitsuroku|Montoku Jitsuroku]]'', ''[[Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku]]''), being promoted to the rank of junior fifth, upper grade (従五位上) in 850 ([[Kashō]] 3),{{efn|「己未。信濃國御名方富命神、健御名方富命前八坂刀賣命神、並加從五位上。」}}&lt;ref name="Montoku"&gt;{{cite wikisource |chapter=卷第二|wslink=zh:日本文德天皇實錄|plaintitle= ''[[Nihon Montoku Tennō Jitsuroku]]'' (日本文德天皇實錄)}}&lt;/ref&gt; to junior third (従三位) in 851 ([[Ninju]] 1),{{efn|「乙丑。進信濃國建御名方富命、前八坂刀賣命等兩大神階、加從三位。」}}&lt;ref name="Montoku2"&gt;{{cite wikisource |chapter=卷第三|wslink=zh:日本文德天皇實錄|plaintitle= ''[[Nihon Montoku Tennō Jitsuroku]]'' (日本文德天皇實錄)}}&lt;/ref&gt; to junior (従二位){{efn|「廿七日甲申。 (...) 信濃國正三位勳八等建御名方冨命神從二位。」}} and then senior second (正二位){{efn|「十一日丁酉。(...) 授信濃國從二位勳八等建御名方富命神正二位。」}} in 859 ([[Jōgan]] 1),&lt;ref name="NihonSandai"&gt;{{cite wikisource |chapter=卷第十|wslink=zh:日本三代實錄|plaintitle= ''[[Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku]]'' (日本三代實錄)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finally to junior first rank (従一位) in 867 (Jōgan 9).{{efn|「十一日辛亥。信濃國正二位勳八等建御名方富命神進階從一位。」}}&lt;ref name="NihonSandai2"&gt;{{cite wikisource |chapter=卷第十四|wslink=zh:日本三代實錄|plaintitle= ''[[Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku]]'' (日本三代實錄)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Database" /&gt; The influence of the Kanasashi-no-toneri clan is thought to be behind the deity's sudden progress in rank.&lt;ref name="Suwa689" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Owa221"&gt;Ōwa (1990). p. 221-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a few decades, the 'Register of Deities' (神名帳 ''Jinmyōchō'') section of the ''[[Engishiki]]'' (927) speaks of the 'Minakatatomi Shrine(s)' (南方刀美神社) as enshrining two deities and being the two [[Myōjin|major ('eminent') shrines]] of Suwa district.{{efn|「諏方郡&lt;sub&gt;二座 並大&lt;/sub&gt; 南方刀美神社&lt;sub&gt;二座 名神大&lt;/sub&gt;」}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engishiki, vol. 10 (延喜式 第十巻)|url=http://supercluster.cias.kyoto-u.ac.jp/berkeley/jhti/cgi-bin/jhti/image.cgi?page=9&amp;kan=10&amp;honname=3|website=Japanese Historical Text Initiative (JHTI)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227231608/http://supercluster.cias.kyoto-u.ac.jp/berkeley/jhti/cgi-bin/jhti/image.cgi?page=9&amp;kan=10&amp;honname=3|archivedate=2017-02-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 940 ([[Tengyō]] 3), the deity had been promoted to the highest rank of senior first (正一位).&lt;ref name="Suwa689" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=社家の姓氏-諏訪氏-|url=http://www.harimaya.com/o_kamon1/syake/middle/s_suwa.html|website=播磨屋 (www.harimaya.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Takeminakata and Suwa Myōjin===

While the above sources (compiled by the imperial court in [[Heian-kyō]]) apply the name '(Take)minakata' to the god of Suwa Grand Shrine, within Suwa itself the god was never worshipped or referred to under that name.&lt;ref name="Suwa689" /&gt; A testament to the enduring influence of the pre-Yamato Mishaguji belief system is the fact that many of the religious ceremonies of the Suwa ''Kamisha'' and surviving descriptions of said rituals feature Mishaguji as the focus of worship rather than 'Takeminakata', who never appears at all in these rites.&lt;ref name="SuwaShishi671"&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). p. 671.&lt;/ref&gt; Even local stories that feature the god of the Suwa ''Kamisha'' recorded in medieval texts ([[Takeminakata#Legends of Suwa Myōjin|see above]]) refer to the deity in question with such generic terms as ''sonshin'' (尊神 'revered deity') or ''[[myōjin]]'' (明神 'manifest deity').&lt;ref&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). p. 688.&lt;/ref&gt; Takeminakata's portrayal in the ''Kojiki'' and the ''Kuji Hongi'' as one who suffered a humiliating defeat was apparently seen as something of an embarrassment during the Middle Ages, leading to the appearance of alternative stories which portray Suwa Myōjin's origins in a more positive light such as the Kōga Saburō legend.&lt;ref name="Kanai17" /&gt;

The earliest documents from within (or connected to) Suwa to explicitly call Suwa Myōjin 'Takeminakata' or identify him with the god from Izumo are the ''Monoimi no rei'' (1238) - which refers in passing to Suwa Myōjin's name being 'Takeminakata Myōjin' (武御名方明神)&lt;ref name="Takei129130" /&gt; - and the ''[[Suwa Daimyōjin Ekotoba]]'' (1356), the latter creatively retelling the Izumo ''kuni-yuzuri'' legend as found in the ''Kuji Hongi'' by omitting any mention of Takeminakata being defeated.&lt;ref name="Ekotoba494"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hanawa|editor1-first=Hokiichi|title=''Suwa Daimyōjin ekotoba'' (諏訪大明神繪詞)|date=1914|publisher=Zoku Gunsho-ruijū Kanseikai|series=''[[Gunsho Ruijū|Zoku Gunsho-ruijū]]'' (続群書類従)|volume=3|pages=494–495|url=http://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/936498/45}} {{ja icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SuwaShishi685689" /&gt; The ''Ekotoba''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s popularity among a wide audience that included the priestly families of the Suwa Grand Shrine seems to have contributed to eventually cementing the identification of Suwa Myōjin with the Takeminakata of the official histories: Ōkuninushi's son who came to Suwa from Izumo.&lt;ref name="Suwa689" /&gt;

==Consort and Offspring==

[[File:Suwa taisha akimiya01bs3200.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Akimiya'' (秋宮) or Autumn Shrine, one of the two component shrines of the Suwa ''Shimosha''.]]

===Yasakatome===

Suwa Myōjin's spouse is the goddess {{nihongo|'''Yasakatome-no-Kami'''|八坂刀売神}}, most often considered to be the deity of the Lower Shrine of Suwa or the ''Shimosha''.&lt;ref&gt;Muraoka (1969). pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the relatively well-documented Suwa ''Kamisha'', very little concrete information is available regarding the origins of the ''Shimosha'' and its goddess.&lt;ref&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). p. 696.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yasakatome]]'s first historical attestation is in the ''Shoku Nihon Kōki'', where the goddess is given the rank of junior fifth, lower grade (従五位下) by the imperial court in the tenth month of [[Jōwa (Heian period)|Jōwa]] 9 (842 CE), five months after the same rank was conferred on Takeminakata.{{efn|「奉授安房國從五位下安房大神正五位下。无位第一后神天比理刀咩命神。信濃國无位健御名方富命前八坂刀賣神。阿波國无位葦稻葉神。越後國无位伊夜比古神。常陸國无位筑波女大神竝從五位下。」}}&lt;ref name="Shoku1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=南方刀美神社二座（八坂刀売命神）|url=http://21coe.kokugakuin.ac.jp/db/jinja/kindex2.php?J_ID=240201|website=神社資料データベース (Shinto Jinja Database)|publisher=Kokugakuin University}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Takeminakata rose up in rank, so did Yasakatome,&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1987). pp. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Montoku" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Montoku2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NihonSandai" /&gt; so that by 867 CE, Yasakatome had been promoted to senior second (正二位).&lt;ref name="NihonSandai2" /&gt; The goddess was finally promoted to senior first rank (正一位) in 1074 ([[Jōhō]] 1).&lt;ref name="Owa221" /&gt;

Stories and claims about the goddess are diverse and contradictory. Regarding her parentage for instance, the lore of Kawaai Shrine (川会神社) in [[Kitaazumi District]] identifies Yasakatome as the daughter of [[Watatsumi]], god of the sea,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=八坂刀売神（ヤサカトメノカミ|url=http://japangod.dip.jp/%E5%85%AB%E5%9D%82%E5%88%80%E5%A3%B2%E7%A5%9E.html|website=日本の神様辞典 (Nihon no Kamisama Jiten)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which has been seen as hinting to a connection between the goddess and the seafaring [[Azumi people|Azumi clan]] ([[:ja:阿曇氏|安曇氏]]).&lt;ref name="Miyasaka39"&gt;Miyasaka (1987). p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Another claim originating from sources dating from the [[Edo period]] is that Yasakatome was the daughter of Ame-no-yasakahiko (天八坂彦命), a god recorded in the ''Kuji Hongi'' as one of the companions of [[List of Japanese deities#Minor kami|Nigihayahi-no-Mikoto]] when the latter came down from heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ponsonby-Fane|first1=R.

The ice cracks that appear on Lake Suwa during cold winters, the ''omiwatari'' ([[Takeminakata#Omiwatari|see above]]) are reputed in folklore to be caused by Suwa Myōjin's crossing the frozen lake to visit Yasakatome.&lt;ref name="railways1922" /&gt;

====Princess Kasuga====

The Kōga Saburō legend identifies the goddess of the Shimosha with Saburō's wife, whose name is given in some variants of the story as 'Princess Kasuga' (春日姫 ''Kasuga-hime'').&lt;ref name="SuwaEngi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kanai17" /&gt;

===Children===

In Suwa, a number of local deities are popularly considered to be the children of Suwa Myōjin and his consort. Ōta (1926) lists the following gods:&lt;ref name="Ota4445"&gt;Ōta (1926). pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship==
===Shrines===
As the gods of the Grand Shrine of Suwa, Suwa Myōjin/Takeminakata and Yasakatome also serve as the deities of shrines belonging to the Suwa shrine network (諏訪神社 ''Suwa-jinja'') all over Japan.

===As god of wind and water===

(1995). p. 686.&lt;/ref&gt;

Snake-shaped iron [[Kama (weapon)|sickle]] blades called ''nagikama'' (薙鎌) were traditionally used in the Suwa region to ward off strong winds, typhoons and other natural disasters; it was once customary for ''nagikama'' to be attached to wooden staves and placed on one corner of the rooftop of the house during the autumn typhoon season.&lt;ref name="Yazaki98" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1992). pp. 172-173.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). p. 677.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nagikama'' are also traditionally hammered onto the trees chosen to become the ''[[onbashira]]'' of the Suwa ''Kamisha'' and ''Shimosha'' some time before these are actually felled.&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1992). pp. 164-172.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these and other uses, the blades are also distributed to function as ''[[shintai]]'' for branch shrines of the [[Shinto shrine#Shrine networks|Suwa shrine network]].&lt;ref name="Yazaki98"&gt;Yazaki, ed. (1986). pp. 98-100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suwa Shishi Hensan Iinkai, ed. (1995). p. 674.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Association with snakes and dragons===

Suwa Myōjin's association with the [[Snakes in mythology|snake]] or the [[Japanese dragon|dragon]] in many stories featuring the god such as the Kōga Saburō legend (see [[Takeminakata#Legends of Suwa Myōjin|'Legends of Suwa Myōjin']] above) might be related to his being considered as a deity presiding over wind and water, due to the association of dragons with winds and the rain in Japanese belief.&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). pp. 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Visser|first1=Marinus Willem|title=The Dragon in China and Japan|date=1913|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mpg6Xd2jW2YC&amp;pg=PA153}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See also ''[[mizuchi]]''.)

===Under ''shinbutsu-shūgō''===

During the Middle Ages, under the then-prevalent [[Shinbutsu-shūgō|synthesis of Buddhism and Shinto]], Suwa Myōjin was [[honji suijaku|identified]] with the [[bodhisattva]] [[Samantabhadra]] (Fugen),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yoshii|first1=Yoshitaka (ed.)|title=えびす信仰事典 (Ebisu shinkō jiten)|date=1999|isbn=978-4-900901-08-7|page=306|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=glXcN9r6GhAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inoue (2003) p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; with the goddess of the ''Shimosha'' being associated with the [[Avalokiteśvara#Thousand-armed Avalokiteśvara|thousand-armed form of the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara]] (Senju Kannon).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miyachi|title=諏訪史 第二卷 (Suwa-shi, vol. 2)|date=1931|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHYSgY4lTZcC&amp;pg=PA28|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the medieval period, [[Jingū-ji|Buddhist temples and other edifices]] were erected on the precincts of both shrines, including a stone [[pagoda]] called the ''Tettō'' (鉄塔 "iron tower") - symbolizing the legendary [[Vajrasattva#Shingon Buddhism|iron tower in India]] where, according to [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] tradition, [[Nagarjuna]] was said to have received esoteric teachings from [[Vajrasattva]] (who is sometimes identified with Samantabhadra) - and a sanctuary to Samantabhadra (普賢堂 ''Fugendō''), both of which served at the time as the ''Kamisha''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s [[Shintai|main objects of worship]].&lt;ref name="Inoue349350"&gt;Inoue (2003). pp. 349-350.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Suwa Kamisha Tettō.png|thumb|200px|The ''Kamisha Honmiya''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s Iron Tower or ''Tettō'' photographed during the early 20th century. After the removal or demolition of Buddhist structures in Suwa Shrine following the [[Shinbutsu bunri|separation of Buddhism and Shinto]], this pagoda was moved to Onsenji Temple (温泉寺) in [[Suwa, Nagano|Suwa City]], where it currently resides.]]With the establishment of [[State Shinto]] after the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868 and the subsequent [[Shinbutsu bunri|separation of Buddhism and Shinto]], the shrine monks (''shasō'') attached to Buddhist temples in the Suwa shrine complex were laicized, with Buddhist symbols and structures being either removed or destroyed; Buddhist ceremonies performed in both the ''Kamisha'' and the ''Shimosha'', such as the yearly offering of the [[Lotus Sutra]] to Suwa Myōjin (involving the placing of a copy of the sutra inside the ''Tettō''), were discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;Inoue (2003). pp. 362-371.&lt;/ref&gt;

===As god of hunting===

Suwa Myōjin is also worshipped as a [[List of hunting deities|god of hunting]]; not surprisingly, some of the ''Kamisha''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s religious ceremonies traditionally involve(d) ritual [[hunting]] and/or [[animal sacrifice]].

For instance, the Frog Hunting Ritual (蛙狩神事 ''kawazugari shinji'') held every New Year's Day involves the shooting (or rather, piercing) of frogs captured from a sacred river or stream within the ''Kamisha''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s precincts with miniature arrows.&lt;ref name="Miyasaka9216"&gt;Miyasaka (1992). pp. 16-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yazaki, ed. (1986). p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanigawa (1987). pp. 154-155.&lt;/ref&gt; This ritual - which has come under harsh criticism from local activists and animal rights groups for its perceived cruelty to the frogs involved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suwa taisha skewering live frogs (生きたカエルを串刺しにする諏訪大社)|url=http://blog.livedoor.jp/liablog/archives/1790677.html|website=NGO Life Investigation Agency (LIA)|access-date=2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rabid animal rights activists go head-to-head with tradition|url=https://japantoday.com/category/features/kuchikomi/rabid-animal-rights-activists-go-head-to-head-with-tradition|website=Japan Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; - was traditionally performed to secure peace and a bountiful harvest for the coming year.&lt;ref name="Miyasaka9216" /&gt;

Another festival, the ''Ontōsai'' (御頭祭) or the ''Tori no matsuri'' (酉の祭, so called because it was formerly held on the [[Earthly Branches|Day of]] [[Rooster (zodiac)|the Rooster]]) currently held every April 15, feature the offering of seventy-five [[Taxidermy|stuffed deer heads]] (a substitute for freshly cut heads of deer used in the past), as well as the consumption of [[venison]] and other [[Game (hunting)|game]] such as [[wild boar]] or [[rabbit]], various kinds of seafood and other foodstuffs by the priests and other participants in a ritual banquet.&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1992). pp. 69-72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yazaki, ed. (1986). pp. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oh (2011). pp. 173-175.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tanigawa (1987). pp. 155-156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fujimori, Terunobu (1991). ''Maemiya Jikkenrō de no saishi'' (前宮十間廊での祭祀). In Jinchōkan Moriya Historical Museum, ed. pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Suwa ''Kamisha''&lt;nowiki /&gt;'s hunting festivals, the Misayama Festival (御射山祭), formerly held in a field - the ''kōya'' (神野 'the god's plain') - at the foot of the [[Yatsugatake Mountains]] for five days (from the 26th to the 30th of [[Japanese calendar#Months|the seventh month]]),{{efn|Currently three days: from the 26th to the 28th of August.&lt;ref&gt;Tanigawa (1987). p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;}} was one of the grandest festivals in Suwa during the [[Kamakura period]], attracting many of the [[Samurai|samurai class]] from all across Japan who engaged in displays of [[Yabusame|mounted archery]], bouts of [[sumo wrestling]] and [[Takagari|falconry]] as part of the festivities, as well as people from all walks of life.&lt;ref&gt;Tanigawa (1987). pp. 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yazaki, ed. (1986). pp. 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1992). pp. 115-118.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Shimosha'' also held its own Misayama Festival at the same time as the ''Kamisha'' (albeit in a different location), in which various warrior clans also participated.&lt;ref&gt;Tanigawa (1987). pp. 158-159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1992). pp. 119-124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suwa Myōjin's association with the mountains and hunting is also evident from the description of the ''ōhōri'' as sitting upon a deer hide (the deer being an animal thought to be sacred to Suwa Myōjin) during the ''Ontōsai'' ritual as practiced during medieval times.&lt;ref&gt;Tanigawa (1987). p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oh (2011). pp. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Suwa Myōjin and meat eating====

At a time when slaughter of animals and consumption of meat was frowned upon due to [[Mahayana Buddhism]]'s [[Buddhist vegetarianism#Mahayana view|strict views on vegetarianism]] and [[Buddhist ethics#Killing|the general Buddhist opposition against the taking of life]], the cult of Suwa Myōjin was a unique feature in the Japanese religious landscape for its celebration of hunting and meat eating.&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). p. 21-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

A four-line verse attached to the Kōga Saburō legend popularly known as the ''Suwa no kanmon'' (諏訪の勘文) encapsulates the justification of meat eating within a Buddhist framework: by being eaten by humans and 'dwelling' inside their bodies, ignorant animals could achieve [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] together with their human consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Kanai (1982). p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miyasaka (1987). pp. 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Kamisha'' produced special talismans (鹿食免 ''kajiki-men'' "permit to eat [[venison]]") and [[chopsticks]] (鹿食箸 ''kajiki-bashi'') that were held to allow the bearer to eat meat.&lt;ref name="EOSsuwashinko"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nogami|first1=Takahiro|title=Suwa Shinkō|url=http://k-amc.kokugakuin.ac.jp/DM/dbSearchList.do?class_name=col_eos&amp;search_condition_type=1&amp;db_search_condition_type=4&amp;View=2&amp;startNo=1&amp;focus_type=0&amp;searchFreeword=Suwa%20Shink%C5%8D&amp;searchRangeType=0|website=Encyclopedia of Shinto|publisher=Kokugakuin University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miyasaka5556"&gt;Miyasaka (1987). pp. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Uehara|first1=Yoshiko|title=Revival of Japan's Wild Game Cuisine|url=http://www.nippon.com/en/views/b01712/|website=nippon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kajikimen"&gt;''Kajikimen'' (鹿食免).

Suwa Myōjin is also considered to be a [[List of war deities|god of war]], one of a number of such deities in the Japanese pantheon. Besides the legend of the god's apparition to [[Sakanoue no Tamuramaro]] ([[Takeminakata#Apparition to Sakanoue no Tamuramaro|see above]]), the ''[[Songs to Make the Dust Dance on the Beams|Ryōjin Hishō]]'' compiled in 1179 (the late [[Heian period]]) also attest to the worship of the god of Suwa in the capacity of god of warfare at the time of its compilation, naming the shrine of Suwa among famous shrines to martial deities in the eastern half of the country.

{{Quote|text=&lt;poem&gt;These gods of war live [[Kantō|east of the barrier]]:{{efn|During the Heian period, the expression 'east of the barrier' (関の東 ''seki-no-hi(n)gashi'', whence derives the term 関東 ''Kantō'') referred to the provinces beyond the checkpoints or barrier stations (関 ''seki'') at the eastern fringes of [[Kinai|the capital region]], more specifically the land east of the checkpoint at Ōsaka/Ausaka Hill (逢坂 'hill of meeting', old orthography: ''Afusaka''; not to be confused with the modern city of [[Osaka]]) in modern [[Ōtsu]], [[Shiga Prefecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=Yuko|title=Heterogeneous Japan: The Cultural Distinctions Between Western and Eastern Japan|date=2008|page=6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8EdvhO4Xkn4C&amp;pg=PA6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the Edo period, ''Kantō'' was reinterpreted to mean the region east of the checkpoint in [[Hakone]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]].}}

During the Kamakura period, the Suwa clan's association with the [[Kamakura shogunate|shogunate]] and the [[Hōjō clan]] helped further cement Suwa Myōjin's reputation as a martial deity.&lt;ref name="Yazaki25"&gt;Yazaki (1986). p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The shrines of Suwa and the priestly clans thereof flourished under the patronage of the Hōjō, which promoted devotion to the god as a sign of loyalty to the shogunate.&lt;ref name="Yazaki25" /&gt; Suwa branch shrines became numerous all across Japan, especially in territories held by clans devoted to the god (for instance, the [[Kantō region]], traditional stronghold of the [[Minamoto]] ([[Seiwa Genji]]) clan).&lt;ref&gt;Muraoka (1969). p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph "Tex" Geddes''' (24 October 1919{{spaced ndash}}11 April 1998) was a Scottish author, adventurer, and self-styled [[Laird]] of [[Soay, Skye|Soay]] best known for the memoir ''Hebridean Sharker'' (1960) about his adventures on sharking boats off the west coast of Scotland with [[Gavin Maxwell]] and others. Geddes was a central character in Maxwell's ''Harpoon at a Venture'' (1952), an account of their failed shark oil extraction venture on Soay and also featured in [[Ian Mitchell (author)|Ian Mitchell]]'s ''Isles of the West'' (1999).

== Biography ==

Geddes was born in Scotland in 1919 and claimed to have been raised by his father in Canada. He was said to have worked as a lumber camp monkey boy sawing tree tops and as a rum runner in the North Atlantic before returning to Britain during World War II, although some details are disputed. Geddes was a special forces instructor alongside Gavin Maxwell in [[Arisaig]] during the war, where as a sergeant in the [[Seaforth Highlanders]] he specialised in amphibious warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Quetteville|first=Harry|date=8 Nov 2012|title=Thinker, Failure, Soldier, Jailer: An Anthology of Great Lives in 365 Days|publisher=Aurum Press|isbn=1781310270}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the war and his marriage to [[Cheltenham Ladies College]]-educated Jeanne, Geddes served on the [[Mallaig]] lifeboat. He joined Gavin Maxwell's basking shark oil extraction venture in the late 1940s, harpooning basking sharks in [[the Minch]] from the Traveller, the remains of which boat are still visible in Soay Harbour.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/39245032@N08/3888602129/ The Traveller, Tex Geddes shark hunting boat at Soay Harbour]&lt;/ref&gt;
After Maxwell's business venture failed and he abandoned the island, Geddes and his wife purchased Soay in 1952. Geddes continued fishing basking sharks, selling unprocessed livers rather than processed oil to Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fairfax|first=Denis|date=1 Jan 1998|title=The Basking Shark in Scotland: Natural History, Fishery and Conservation|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=1862320942}}&lt;/ref&gt; While much of the remaining population of the island evacuated to Mull in 1953, Geddes and his family remained. Geddes protested at the lack of emergency telephone services&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/item/item_page.jsp?item_id=67970 Letter from J Geddes to The Clarion of Skye Issue 43, August 1954]&lt;/ref&gt; and with the threat of loss of postal service to the remaining inhabitants of the island, he asked people to send him registered letters and packages. As a result the service was kept with post arriving once a month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marccalhoun.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/shark-factory-soay.html Marc Calhoun: Shark Factory Soay]&lt;/ref&gt;
Historian of Gaelic culture [[Margaret Fay Shaw]] said of him: "Tex was a great storyteller and important as such. He was also immensely kind, and had that hunger for life and fun that is essential if you are to make a go of living in these islands. The Hebrides needs more people like Tex Geddes. So does the world."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-tex-geddes-1157542.html Independent Obituary: Tex Geddes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Geddes died during a return journey from a bagpiping competition in the [[Outer Hebrides]]. A memorial to Tex and his wife is placed at a stone bench on the trail pass over the middle of Soay.

'''''The Future Is Wild''''' is a British 2002 thirteen-part pseudo-[[documentary]] television [[miniseries]]. Based on research and interviews with several scientists, the miniseries shows how life could evolve in the future if humans were to disappear from the [[Earth]] altogether through [[extinction]]. The version broadcast on the [[Discovery Channel]] modified this premise, supposing instead that the human species had completely abandoned the Earth and had sent back probes to examine the progress of life on the planet as time progressed. The show styled itself after the format of a nature documentary. It is narrated by [[John de Lancie]] in the Discovery Channel version.

The miniseries was released with a companion book written by geologist [[Dougal Dixon]], the author of several [[speculative evolution]] books, or "anthropologies and zoologies of the future" (such as ''[[After Man: A Zoology of the Future]]''), in conjunction with [[natural history]] television producer John Adams. For a time in 2005, a theme park based on this program was opened in Japan. In 2008 a special on the Discovery Channel about the development of the video game ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore]]'' was combined with airings of ''The Future Is Wild''.

A documentary film version of the series was originally set to be picked up by [[Warner Bros.]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tezer|first=Adnan|title=Warner sees the 'Future'|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/movies/news/article_1504724.php/Warner-sees-the-Future|work=Monsters and Critics|accessdate=31 October 2011|date=2 October 2009}}{{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the series may be rebooted by production company [[Vanguard Animation]] and broadcasting at [[HBO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tbivision.com/news/2016/01/shrek-producer-reboot-evolution-show/532312/|title=Shrek producer to reboot evolution show/532312/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2-part 2005 series ''[[Extraterrestrial (TV documentary)|Extraterrestrial]]'' (also known as ''Alien Worlds'') takes a similar scientific approach to the creation of speculative ecologies and the depiction of their inhabitants. As the title suggests, however, these are set on [[extrasolar planets]] with no connection to terrestrial evolution.

==Ecosystems==
Twelve ecosystems were presented, four in each of the three future periods.

===5 million years' time===
The early episodes describe a world after an [[ice age]], when giant sea-birds roam the beaches and carnivorous bats rule the skies. Ice sheets extend as far south as [[Paris]] in the northern hemisphere and as far north as [[Buenos Aires]] in the southern hemisphere. The [[Amazon rainforest]] has dried up and become [[grassland]]. The North American plains have become cold desert, and Africa has collided with Europe, enclosing the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Without water to replace it in the dry climate, the Mediterranean has dried out into a salt flat dotted with brine lakes, as it [[Messinian salinity crisis|has been in the past]]. Most of Europe is frozen [[tundra]]. The part of Africa east of the [[African Rift Valley]] has broken away from the rest of the continent. Asia has dried up and is now mountainous. The once warm, tropical area of Central America has been transformed into a dry area. Australia has moved north and collided with eastern [[Indonesia]].

;Profiled species

*[[Ephydridae|Brine flies]], flies that thrive on [[hypersaline]] water; the very same species alive today.
;Hypothesized species

*Babookari, a ground-living [[New World monkey]] descended from the present-day [[uakari]];
*Carakiller, a giant, 2 meter (7 foot) tall, flightless bird of prey, descended from the present-day [[caracara]];
*Cryptile, a lizard that inhabits salt flats and has a sticky [[neck frill]] for catching [[fly|flies]];
*Deathgleaner, a giant, carnivorous [[bat]] descended from the [[spectral bat]] of [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]];
*Gannetwhale, a large, flightless, [[pinniped|seal]]-like seabird descended from the present-day [[gannet]];
*Rattleback, an armoured [[rodent]] descended from the present-day [[agouti]]; there are two species, one in the Amazonian grasslands and the other in the northern deserts;
*Gryken, a slender terrestrial [[mustelid]] descended from the present-day [[pine marten]];
*Scrofa, a wild pig living on the Mediterranean salt flats descended from the [[wild boar]].
*Shagrat, a giant, [[capybara]]-like rodent found in the tundra of northern Europe; descended from the present-day [[marmot]];
*Snowstalker, a large, white, saber-toothed mustelid from northern Europe, descended from the present-day [[wolverine]];
*Spink, a small, [[Mole (animal)|mole]]-like, burrowing [[bird]] found in southern North America, descended from the present-day [[New World quail|quail]].

===100 million years' time===
In the scenario for 100 million years in the future, the world is much hotter than at present. [[Octopus]]es and enormous [[tortoise]]s have come on to the land, much of which is flooded by shallow seas surrounded by brackish swamps. Antarctica has drifted towards the tropics and is covered with dense rainforests, as it was before. Australia has collided with North America and Asia, forcing up an enormous, 12-kilometre-high mountain plateau much taller than the modern Himalayas. [[Greenland]] has been reduced to a small, temperate island. There are cold, deep ocean trenches. The Sahara has once again become the rich grassland it was millions of years ago

;Profiled species

*[[Rhodophyta|Red algae]], a protist that is alive today and evolves into a plant-like shape to form reefs in the absence of [[coral]]s and forge a symbiosis with the Reef Gliders.

;Hypothesized species

*Falconfly, a giant predatory [[wasp]] descended from the [[Bembicini|sand wasp]];
*Grass Tree, a plant species of the Great Plateau, harvested by Silver Spiders to feed the Poggles; descended from [[bamboo]];
*Great Blue Windrunner, a giant, blue, 3 meter (9 foot) wingspan, four-winged crane whose legs have flight feathers that can act as gliding surfaces; it is descended from a present-day [[crane (bird)|crane]];
*Lurkfish, a giant, big-mouthed, charge up with 1,000 volt, electric fish descended from the [[electric catfish]];
*Nursery Vase, a plant that traps water within it and is used as a nursery by the Swampus in a very close [[symbiosis]]. It is similar to the present-day [[pineapple]] and [[bromeliad]] and is possibly a descendant from their lineage.
*Ocean Phantom, a giant descendant of the [[Portuguese man o' war]];
*Poggle, the last surviving [[mammal]], living inside mountains and descended from a species of social [[rodent]];
*Reef Glider, a giant, swimming [[sea slug]];
*Roachcutter, a swift species of Flutterbird, a variety of birds unique to Antarctica that descended from modern-day [[Procellariiformes|tubenosed seabirds]];
*Silver Spider, a large colonial spider
*Spindle Trooper, a giant [[sea spider]] that lives in Ocean Phantoms, which they defend against enemies;
*Spitfire Bird, a species of Flutterbird that shoots acidic flower nectar from its nostrils as a defense;
*False Spitfire Bird, a Flutterbird species that mimics the Spitfire Bird to frighten such predators as the Falconfly;
*Spitfire Beetle, a cooperative, predatory [[beetle]] that preys on Spitfire Birds;
*Spitfire Tree, a flowering tree that makes two chemicals collected by Spitfire Birds, which pollinate the tree in the process;
*Swampus, a semi-terrestrial, brackish [[swamp]]-dwelling [[octopus]];
*Toraton, a giant [[tortoise]] that grows to 120 tons.

===200 million years' time===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pangaea Ultimania corrected.jpg|thumb|400px|Map of a hypothetical future Earth ~200 million years hence]] --&gt;

The hypothetical world of 200 million years from now is recovering from a [[mass extinction]] caused by a [[flood basalt]] eruption even larger than the one that created the [[Siberian Traps]], wiping out 99% of the species on the planet. Fish have taken to the skies, squid to the forests, and the world's largest-ever desert is filled with strange worms and insects. All the continents have collided with one another and fused into a single [[supercontinent]], a [[Pangea Ultima|second Pangaea]]. (A few present-day geographical features can still be discerned, including [[Hudson Bay]], [[Novaya Zemlya]] and the [[Scandinavian Peninsula]], as well as the general outline of [[Africa]].) One large global ocean with a single-current system gives rise to deadly hurricanes called hypercanes, which batter the coastlines of the continent all year long. The northwestern side of Pangaea II, drenched with an endless supply of [[rain]], has become a temperate forest. Mountains resting at the end of the coast prevent most of the rain's moisture from reaching a long line of scrubby [[Rain shadow|rainshadow deserts]]. The very center of the continent receives no rain at all and has become a barren, plantless desert. Only fish, arthropods, worms and mollusks were left to repopulate the Earth.

;Hypothesized species

*Bumblebeetle, a fast-flying beetle that lives and breeds inside the carcasses of dead Ocean Flish;
*Deathbottle, a carnivorous plant living in the Rainshadow Desert;
*Desert Hopper, a hopping snail with a modified single foot;
*Forest Flish, a small, forest-dwelling, [[hummingbird]]-like fish that no longer lives in the oceans but instead flies like a bird (Flish being a portmanteau of flying and fish);
*Ocean Flish, another type of Flish which relies on the ocean more than does the Forest Flish; like the Forest Flish, it is a descendant of [[flying fish]];
*Garden Worm, an algae-filled worm that feeds only on sunlight;
*Lichen Tree, a descendant of living [[lichen]]s that has grown gigantic due to the high levels of moisture in its environment, reaching 10 feet (3 meters) in height; 
*Megasquid, a 5-meter-high (16.5-feet-high), 8-ton, omnivorous, terrestrial cephalopod; its eight arms have evolved into walking legs like an elephant's; it uses its two long tentacles for feeding (The megasquid is implied in the series to be a distant relative of the swampus of 100 million years earlier);
*Rainbow squid, a 25-meter-long (82-feet-long), gentle, ocean-going cephalopod descended from [[squid]]s;
*Sharkopath, a [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] shark that hunts in packs, descended from [[sharks]];
*Silverswimmers, fish-sized [[neoteny|neotenous]] [[crustacean]]s;
*Slickribbon, a cave-dwelling, 1-meter-long (3.2-feet-long), predatory worm with a striking resemblance to [[Opabinia]] of the [[Cambrian]];
*Slithersucker, a large, predatory [[slime mold]];
*Squibbon, a terrestrial cephalopod that swings from tree branches; it is highly intelligent and the likeliest ancestor for future life that may allow civilization to once again reestablish itself on [[Earth]]; like the Megasquid it is a descendent of the [[cephalopod]]s;
*Terabyte (not to be confused with the information unit), a highly specialized colonial descendant of [[termite]]s;
*Gloomworm, a primitive-looking, [[bacteria]]-eating worm.

==Production==
''The Future is Wild'' is a £5-million co-production of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC), the Franco-German channel [[Arte]], the German [[ZDF]], the Austrian [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]], the Italian [[Mediaset]], and [[Animal Planet]] and [[Discovery Channel|Discovery Channels Inc]] of the United States.&lt;ref name="zdf"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mainz|title=''The Future is Wild'' is ZDF Enterprises’ bestselling documentary in 2003|url=http://enterprise-test.zdf.de/en/the_future_is_wild_is_zdf_enterprises’_bestselling_documentary_in_2003.2094.htm|publisher=ZDF Enterprises|accessdate=19 October 2011|date=26 November 2003}} {{Dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC intended that the miniseries would repeat the success it had with its prehistoric documentary series ''[[Walking With Dinosaurs]]'', which attracted 17 million viewers in 1999. The program used [[computer-generated imagery]] to show the possible future of [[life|life on Earth]]. The 13-part series was produced in four years by independent producer John Adams, who conceived it in 1997.&lt;ref name=fish&gt;{{cite news|last=Byrne|first=Ciar|title=Fish in trees and elephant-sized squid - the future as seen on TV|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/fish-in-trees-and-elephantsized-squid--the-future-as-seen-on-tv-568162.html|accessdate=19 October 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=30 March 2004}} {{Dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8306">'''Transpartisanship''' represents an emerging school of political thought which accepts the validity of truths across a range of political perspectives and seeks to synthesize them into an inclusive, pragmatic container beyond typical political dualities.  It is distinct from [[bipartisanship]], which aims to negotiate between “right” and “left,” resulting in a dualistic perspective, and [[nonpartisanship]], which tends to avoid political affiliation altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ivn.us/2014/05/28/transpartisanship-new-idea-bring-people-together/|title=Transpartisanship: A New Idea to Bring People Together|date=2014-05-28|website=IVN.us|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

Transpartisanship is a movement to support and advance a common ground - or "new center" - that already exists in U.S. politics, emerging periodically into public view in the form of "unusual coalitions" of [[progressives]] and [[conservatives]] around issues ranging from [[war]] and the [[Military budget of the United States|military budget]] to [[corporate power]] and the [[surveillance state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ivn.us/2016/09/06/the-transpartisan-grassroots-movement-to-overturn-citizens-united/|title=The Transpartisan, Grassroots Movement to Overturn Citizens United is Gaining Serious Momentum|date=2016-09-06|website=IVN.us|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.utne.com/Politics/Americas-Transpartisan-Future-Partisan|title=America’s Transpartisan Future|newspaper=Utne|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Husseini, Sam [http://husseini.posthaven.com/the-perennially-unusual-yet-somehow-ubiquitous-left-right-alliance-towards-acknowledging-an-anti-establishment-center "The Perennially 'Unusual' Yet Somehow Ubiquitous Left-Right Alliance: Towards Acknowledging an Anti-Establishment Center"]. http://husseini.posthaven.com. 2013-07-25. Retrieved 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerzon 2016 p."&gt;{{cite book|title=The Reunited States of America : how we can bridge the partisan divide|last=Gerzon|first=Mark|publisher=Berrett-Koehler Publishers, Inc|year=2016|isbn=978-1-62656-658-3|location=Oakland, CA|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement builds on methods of facilitated dialogue, [[deliberation]] and [[conflict resolution]].

Current examples of transpartisan initiatives include [http://www.transpartisancenter.org Transpartisan Center], [http://TheSolution.org TheSolution.org], [http://www.reunitingamerica.org Reuniting America], [http://www.meetup.com/TranspartisanSeattle/ Transpartisan Alliance], and [http://www.libertycoalition.net Liberty Coalition].

* &lt;blockquote&gt; Transpartisanship is an emerging field that advocates pragmatic and effective solutions to social and political problems, transcending and including preexisting political ideologies. Transpartisanship encompasses the idea that all systems are inextricably interconnected, and that successful outcomes can best be reached through inclusive, genuine, and respectful cooperation. Transpartisan democracy, in part, seeks to reintegrate the public’s voice in identifying, debating, and shaping governmental policies, while continuing to protect the sovereignty of the individual. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
* &lt;blockquote&gt; The term “Transpartisanship” has emerged to provide a meaningful alternative to “Bipartisanship,” and “Nonpartisanship.” Bipartisanship limits the dialogue process to two political viewpoints or entities, striving for compromise solutions. Nonpartisanship, on the other hand, tends to deny the existence of differing viewpoints in exchange for cooperation. Both the bipartisan and nonpartisan approaches can discount the multiplicity of viewpoints that exist, which often results in incomplete and therefore unsuccessful outcomes. In contrast to these, transpartisanship recognizes the existence and validity of many points of view, and advocates a constructive dialogue aimed at arriving at creative, integrated, and therefore, breakthrough solutions that meet the needs of all present. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Transpartisan gatherings have resulted not only in surprisingly civil conversations noted by mainstream media&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/joegarofoli/article/MoveOn-founder-Tea-Party-figure-meet-4204384.php|title=MoveOn founder, Tea Party figure meet|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also in shifts from traditional ideological stances by some participants.&lt;ref&gt;Atlee, Tom. "[http://co-intelligence.org/polarization-Fetzer.html A Personally Transformational Encounter of Left and Right]". http://co-intelligence.org. 2004. Retrieved 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

A close relative of transpartisanship is [[Integral politics]]. A transpartisan approach to policy would necessarily include individual and collective, as well as subjective and objective, perspective. Furthermore, similar to [[Integral theory (Ken Wilber)|Integral theory]], transpartisanship places politics in a developmental context, viewing democracy and prosperity not as static attainments, but rather emergent properties along a continuum of developmental stages.

==En Marche!==
In 2016, [[Emmanuel Macron]] created a new French political party, [[En Marche]]. The party sought to transcend traditional political boundaries to be a transpartisan organisation.

Macron has described the party as being a [[Progressivism|progressive]] party uniting the left and the right.&lt;ref name="lse"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lelab.europe1.fr/emmanuel-macron-refuse-detre-loblige-de-francois-hollande-2726290|title=Finalement, le parti d'Emmanuel Macron est "et de droite, et de gauche" (mais surtout progressiste) – Le Lab Europe 1|language=fr-FR|access-date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observers and political commentators have described the party as being both [[Social liberalism|socially]] and [[Economic liberalism|economically liberal]] in ideology,&lt;ref name="Cowley2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cowley|first1=Jason|title=Emmanuel Macron: a populist eruption from the liberal centre|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2017/02/emmanuel-macron-populist-eruption-liberal-centre|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=[[New Statesman]]|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Endeweld2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Endeweld|first1=Marc|title=La démonstration de force du social-libéral Emmanuel Macron|url=https://www.marianne.net/politique/la-demonstration-de-force-du-social-liberal-emmanuel-macron|accessdate=25 April 2017|work=[[Marianne (magazine)|Marianne]]|date=10 December 2016|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Milner2017"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Milner|first1=Susan|title=Emmanuel Macron and the building of a new liberal-centrist movement|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2017/02/06/emmanuel-macron-liberal-centrist-movement/|website=EUROPP|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|accessdate=25 April 2017|date=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Venturini2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Venturini|first1=Lionel|title=En marche !

The party also won the National Assembly elections a month later, as candidates in the legislative elections included members of the Democratic Movement, as well as dissidents from the Socialist Party, The Republicans and minor parties. It won an absolute majority of seats in the National Assembly, securing 308 under its label and 42 for the MoDem.

[[File:HS 1924 Tulipwood sx.jpg|thumb|[[Hispano-Suiza H6]] 1924 Tulipwood]]
Most commonly, '''tulipwood''' is the pinkish yellowish wood yielded from the [[Liriodendron tulipifera|tulip tree]], found on the Eastern side of North America and also in some parts of China. In the United States, it is commonly known as [[tulip poplar]] or yellow poplar, even though the tree is not related to the [[Populus|poplars]]. In fact, the reference to poplar is a result of the tree's height, which can exceed 100 feet. The wood is very light, around 490&amp;nbsp;kg per cubic meter,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120303011440/http://www.nichetimbers.co.uk/hardwood/north-american-hardwood/tulipwood/ ''Tulipwood''] published by Niche Timbers.&lt;/ref&gt; but very strong and is used in many applications, including [[furniture]], [[Joinery (woodworking)|joinery]] and [[Molding (decorative)|molding]]s. It can also be stained very easily and is often used as a low-cost alternative to walnut and cherry in furniture and doors.

== Other type s==
[[File:Bahia01.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Brazilian tulipwood from ''Dalbergia decipularis'']]

=== Brazilian ===
Brazilian tulipwood is a different species. A classic high-quality wood, it is very dense with a lovely figure. It is used for inlays in furniture and for small turned items. Available only in small sizes, it is rarely used in the solid for luxury furniture. Like other woods with a pronounced figure it is rather strongly subject to fashion.

In the nineteenth century Brazilian tulipwood was thought to be the product of the brazilian [[rosewood]] ''[[Physocalymma scaberrimum]]'' (West indian tulipwood), but in the twentieth century it became clear it was yielded by a species of ''[[Dalbergia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Record S.J., Clayton D.M.: ''Timbers of tropical America.'' Yale Univ. Press, 1924, p. 288, 455, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015006149275;view=1up;seq=571 online] on babel.hathitrust.org.&lt;/ref&gt; At some point it was misidentified as ''[[Dalbergia frutescens]]'', a misidentification which can still be found in books aimed at the woodworker. For some decades it has been known to be yielded by ''[[Dalbergia decipularis]]'', a species restricted to a small area in Western-[[Brazil]]. But both ''Dalbergia fructescens'' and ''Dalbergia decipularis'' are named (Brazilian tulipwood).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wood-database.com/brazilian-tulipwood/ ''Brazilian tulipwood''] on wood-database.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Also ''[[Dalbergia cearensis]]'' kingwood or violetwood, is named tulipwood and ''[[Dalbergia oliveri]]'' the burmese rosewood is sometimes called "burma tulipwood".

=== American Tulipwood ===
The cheap, soft and pale wood from the tuliptree ''[[Liriodendron tulipifera]]'' is know as american tulipwood or poplar and american whitewood,  canary whitewood and canary wood, it is widely used.

=== Australian ===
There also exists the "australian tulipwood", "tulipwood trees" the common name of ''[[Harpullia]]'',  ''[[Harpullia pendula]]'' (Black or Queensland, Moreton Bay tulipwood) and ''[[Harpullia arborea]]'' (Cooktown tulipwood) or ''[[Harpullia hillii]]'' (Blunt leaf tulipwood) and ''[[Harpullia alata]]'' (Wing-leaved tulipwood) etc. Certain varieties of ''Harpullia'' were prized for their dark coloured timber. The one most commonly known to horticulture is ''Harpullia pendula'' which is widely planted as a street tree along the east coast of Australia. Also ''[[Drypetes acuminata]]'' and ''[[Drypetes deplanchei]]''  (Yellow tulipwood) are from Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper W.: ''Australian Rainforest Fruits.''

=== Others ===
Also exists the tuliptrees, ''[[Thespesia populnea]]'' and ''[[Thespesia acutiloba]]'', ''[[Spathodea campanulata]]'', ''[[Stenocarpus sinuatus]]'', and ''[[Licaria guianensis]]'', ''[[Dicypellium caryophyllatum]]'' and ''[[Hibiscus elatus]]'', these trees resp. their wood are also occasionaly named tulipwood.&lt;ref name="Wiers"&gt;Wiersema J.H., León B.: ''World Economic Plants: A Standard Reference.''
