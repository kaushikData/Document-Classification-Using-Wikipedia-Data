The [[Kyrgyzstan Emergency Ministry]] said that few buildings remained standing in the village: "Almost all buildings in the village have been destroyed.

The '''A607''' is an [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] in England that starts in [[Leicester]]&lt;ref&gt;Leicester (Southern) end: {{coord|52.6415|-1.1294|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A607 road (southern end)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and heads northeastwards through [[Leicestershire]] and the town of [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]], terminating at [[Bracebridge Heath]],&lt;ref&gt;Bracebridge Heath (Northern) end: {{coord|53.1962|-0.5347|type:landmark_region:GB|display=inline|name=A607 road (northern end)}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[village]] on the outskirts of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]]. It is a [[primary route]] from [[Thurmaston]] to the A1 junction at [[Grantham]].

==History==
The road used to begin at the junction with the A46 (Fosse Way) in [[Syston]].

===Leicester to Grantham===
[[File:GE Lighting Ltd - geograph.org.uk - 473481.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Former GE Lighting factory in [[Rushey Mead]] ]]
The road begins in Leicester on the [[A594 road (Leicester)|A594]] inner ring road from the ''Burleys Flyover'' intersection, near Thames Tower, as ''Belgrave Gate''. The section of road was the [[A46 road|A46]], and also the A6. {{citation needed span|text=As ''Belgrave Road'' it is well known in Leicester as a place of curry houses, and the city council promotes this fact.|date=June 2016}} At ''Belgrave Circle'' (a grade separated junction - the ''Belgrave Flyover'') it meets ''[[Abbey Park, Leicester|Abbey Park]] Road'' (B5327) north of the [[Murco|Murco Petroleum Ltd]] ''Flyover Filling Station'' and [[Leicester College]]'s Abbey Park Campus&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leicestercollege.ac.uk/about-us/centres-and-campuses/abbeypark-campus/ Abbey Park Campus] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405205513/http://www.leicestercollege.ac.uk/about-us/centres-and-campuses/abbeypark-campus/ |date=5 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at ''Painter Street'', with the college's Technology and Engineering Centre&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leicestercollege.ac.uk/about-us/centres-and-campuses/technology-and-engineering-centre/ Technology and Engineering Centre] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405205525/http://www.leicestercollege.ac.uk/about-us/centres-and-campuses/technology-and-engineering-centre/ |date=5 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the eastern side of the flyover, next to the ''Bridle Lane Tavern''. The ''Belgrave Road''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/sol/storelocator/storelocator_detail_view.jsp?storeId=824&amp;bmForm=store_details Sainsbury's]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sainsbury's]] is on the right. In [[Belgrave, Leicester|Belgrave]], ''[[Loughborough]] Road'' leaves to the left, which was the former [[A6 road (England)|A6]]. The road now becomes ''[[Melton Mowbray|Melton]] Road'' and meets the former [[A6030 road|A6030]] at crossroads.  On the corner of ''Sandringham Avenue'' there is the [[BP]] ''Sandringham Service Station'' on the left, and from here the road becomes a dual-carriageway. There is a roundabout with the ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat|Owl &amp; Pussycat]]'' on the left.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pub-explorer.com/leics/pub/owl&amp;pussycatleicester.htm Owl &amp; Pussycat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820141027/http://pub-explorer.com/leics/pub/owl%26pussycatleicester.htm |date=20 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Rushey Mead]] it passes [[Rushey Mead Academy]] on the right, and meets the [[A563 road|A563]] Leicester outer ring road (''Troon Way'') at crossroads. The former site of the GE Lighting factory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetlightonline.co.uk/Visits/geleicester.htm GE Lighting]&lt;/ref&gt; (closed in 2007) is on the right (originally [[British Thomson-Houston]], then [[Associated Electrical Industries|AEI]]). The [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] (former [[Total S.A.|TOTAL]]) ''Fosseway Service Station'' is on the left.

[[File:The A607 Newark Road - geograph.org.uk - 497638.jpg|thumb|140px|right|''[[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]] Road'' - [[Thurmaston]] Bypass (former A46)]]
The road becomes a primary route, leaves the unitary authority of Leicester and enters [[Leicestershire]] and the district of [[Charnwood (borough)|Charnwood]]. The road used to pass through the centre of [[Thurmaston]], but there is now a bypass to the east (built as the A46) known as ''[[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]] Road'', where the road leaves the route of the [[Fosse Way]]. At the large ''Thurmaston Roundabout'' with ''[[Barkby Thorpe]] Lane'', there is a large [[Asda]] to the right, with a [[McDonald's]], [[Pizza Hut]] and the Thurmaston Shopping Centre [[retail park]]. The Syston bypass was originally built as the A46, before the [[Leicester Western Bypass]] was built in November 1995. Near [[The Roundhill Academy]] in Syston, the road used to diverge from the A46. The Syston bypass is quite some distance longer than driving through Syston itself. It passes the headquarters of [[Lafarge Tarmac|Lafarge Cement UK]] on the right, and there is a left turn for the [[Watermead Country Park]]. At Syston the road now meets with the Leicester Western Bypass (A46) at a roundabout, known locally as the ''Hobby Horse Roundabout'' which was widened in May 2006, where there is the ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110519181424/http://www.pub-explorer.com/leics/pub/hobbyhorsesyston.htm Hobby Horse]'' on the exit to the right, for Syston. At [[Cossington, Leicestershire|Cossington]] it crosses the [[Midland Main Line]] and leaves the A46 (Fosse Way) at an interchange in the parish of [[Ratcliffe on the Wreake]]. The Syston Northern Bypass opened in October 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100908230216/http://www.highways.gov.uk/roads/projects/5836.aspx Syston Northern Bypass]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Entering the Borough of Melton - geograph.org.uk - 1208472.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Entering the district of [[Melton (borough)|Melton]] at the end of the Rearsby bypass]]
There is a small roundabout as ''Cossington Lane'' with the former Fosse Way, and the road crosses the [[River Wreake]] then the [[Birmingham to Peterborough Line]]. It meets the former route (east of Syston) at the ''[[Queniborough]] Roundabout''. The road used to pass through [[East Goscote]] and [[Rearsby]] (and access for the [http://www.beedleslake.co.uk Beedles Lake Golf Centre]), but is now bypassed to the east. The £7 million bypass was opened on 15 December 2004 by [[Charlotte Atkins]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/leicestershire/4096721.stm Rearsby bypass]&lt;/ref&gt; and construction had begun in April 2004. At the end of the bypass the road enters the district of [[Melton (borough)|Melton]]. There is a left turn for an [[agricultural college]] ([[Brooksby Melton College]]) at [[Hoby with Rotherby]], where the road is crossed by the [[Midshires Way]]. The road is crossed by the [[Leicestershire Round]] at [[Frisby and Kirby]]. At [[Kirby Bellars]] it passes ''[http://www.flyingchilderspub.co.uk The Flying Childers]'', named after the [[Flying Childers]] race horse.

[[File:Bridge Over the Eye - geograph.org.uk - 1284318.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Crossing the [[River Eye, Leicestershire|River Eye]] in [[Melton Mowbray]] ]]
Entering [[Melton Mowbray]] as ''Leicester Road'', it passes the headquarters of [[Samworth Brothers]] on the Leicester Road Industrial Estate and crosses the former Northampton to Nottingham railway and then the [[Birmingham to Peterborough Line]]. It meets two roundabouts and passes [[Long Field Academy]] to the left. It meets ''[[Great Dalby|Dalby]] Road'' (B6047, for [[Tilton on the Hill]]) to the right at the [[Total S.A.|TOTAL]] (former [[BP]]) ''Malthurst [[Egerton Park]] Filling Station'', and crosses the two sections of the [[River Eye, Leicestershire|River Eye]]. It passes through the middle of [[Melton Mowbray]], and meets the A606 from the right. Opposite [[Brooksby Melton College]], it meets the A6006 (for Loughborough) to the left, and the A606 exits straight ahead. It follows the exit to the right at the traffic lights crossroads, and passes to the north of the town centre. At the traffic lights junction with the B676 (for [[Pedigree Petfoods]]), it leaves to the left, where it is crossed by the [[Jubilee Way]]. As ''Thorpe Road'' it passes the small [[Melton Mowbray Hospital]] on the right, near the B676 junction, and passes the [[Jet (brand)|JET]] ''Brobot Melton Mowbray'' garage and a Tesco on the right. It bends to the right, and the road ahead, ''Melton Spinney Road'', is the exit for [[Twinlakes Theme Park]] (in the parish of [[Waltham and Thorpe Arnold]]).

[[File:Cross roads in the centre of Waltham - geograph.org.uk - 33231.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Waltham crossroads]]
In Thorpe Arnold (Waltham and Thorpe Arnold parish) it passes the church, then ascends the Leicestershire wolds, passing Melton Mowbray Golf Club on the right. The [[Waltham transmitting station]] dominates the view of the area to the right, and is situated next door to the [[Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition]]. At [[Waltham on the Wolds]], it is crossed by the [[Mowbray Way]], and the primary school is on the left. There is a crossroads next to St Mary Magdalene church, on the right. The ''Royal Horseshoes'' is on the left and the ''Marquis of Granby'' is on the right of the crossroads.

[[File:The A607 enters Lincolnshire - geograph.org.uk - 808250.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Entering Lincolnshire]]
In the parish of [[Croxton Kerrial]] at Lings Farm, it meets the ''[[Salters Way]]'' from the west - a [[Roman road]] along the top of the wolds from Six Hills, which eventually reaches Saltersford near Grantham. At this point, Lings Hill, the road is at its highest point of 173 metres. There is a right turn for [[Branston, Leicestershire|Branston]]. In Croxton Kerrial, it passes the ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110420130517/http://www.peacockcroxton.co.uk/ Peacock]'' on the left, and there is a right turn for Knipton (and [[Belvoir Castle]]), and a left turn for [[Saltby]]. The road bends to the left and the Roman road carries straight on. The road is still on top of the wolds, and at Top Ash Plantation near Hill Top Farm, it meets the [[Viking Way]] ([[Sewstern]] Lane), and enters [[South Kesteven]] and [[Lincolnshire]].

At this point it descends from the top of the wolds down into [[Denton, Lincolnshire|Denton]], which it passes to the south. It gently ascends a hill to reach [[Harlaxton]]. There is a crossroads, with the left exit for [[Barrowby]]. To the right is the entrance to [[Harlaxton Manor]]. It descends down the hill towards the A1 and the 400&amp;nbsp;kV pylon line. There is a roundabout for the northbound A1, where there is a Premier Inn,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.premierinn.com/en/hotel/GRABRE/grantham Premier Inn Grantham]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[http://www.pub-explorer.com/lincs/pub/farrier.htm Farrier]'' ([[Brewers Fayre]]) pub.

===Grantham to Lincoln===
This route follows broadly the former route of the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] Grantham to Lincoln line which had stations at [[Barkston railway station|Barkston]], [[Honington railway station|Honington]], [[Caythorpe railway station|Caythorpe]], [[Leadenham railway station|Leadenham]], [[Navenby railway station|Navenby]], [[Harmston railway station|Harmston]], [[Waddington railway station|Waddington]] and [[Bracebridge railway station|Bracebridge]].

[[File:Grantham fire station - geograph.org.uk - 835966.jpg|thumb|140px|right|Grantham fire station on ''[[Harlaxton]] Road'']]
The road passes under the A1 as ''Harlaxton Road'', with the exit to the southbound A1 (for the [[Ramada]] [http://www.ramadagrantham.co.uk Grantham] and the former Fenland Foods), on the left where the road loses its primary route status. It passes close to [[Walton Girls High School]], on the right. Grantham Fire station&lt;ref&gt;[http://microsites.lincolnshire.gov.uk/lfr/section.asp?docId=53377 Grantham Fire Station]&lt;/ref&gt; is on the left, and at a cross roads with traffic lights it meets ''Trent Road'', to the left, and ''Springfield Road'', to the right. ''Springfield Road'' is a spur of the A607, and passes under the [[East Coast Main Line]] at a (13&amp;nbsp;ft - 3.8 m) low bridge, with single-lane access, to meet the A52. Both bridges are regularly hit by lorries, between 10 and 20 times a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lincolnshire/6936901.stm Most bashed bridge in 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-515122/Three-bridges-mile-hit-SIXTY-TWO-times-curse-satnav.html Low bridges in 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; The main section of the road passes a large [[Malthouse|maltings]] and Grantham Magistrates Court (now the main [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|magistrates court]] in south Lincolnshire) on the right, then the ''Huntingtower Arms'', off ''Huntingtower Road''. The [[BP]] ''Archways Service Station'' is on the left, and it passes under the ECML at the ''Harlaxton Road'' bridge (arched, 15&amp;nbsp;ft - 4.5 m at the centre - the highest clearance of the three low railway bridges for journeys across the town), meeting the A52 at the traffic lights (former roundabout) for [[Grantham railway station]]. The A607 from the A1 is the most popular, and quickest, route to the railway station.

[[File:St.John's church, Manthorpe, Lincs. - geograph.org.uk - 119668.jpg|thumb|140px|left|St John the Evangelist church in [[Manthorpe, Grantham|Manthorpe]] ]]
The road follows the A52 on ''[[Sankt Augustin]] Way'', following alongside the ECML. It used to follow ''Westgate'' into the Market Place. It passes [[Asda]] on the right and meets a small roundabout, taking the exit to the right. It crosses the former ''Great North Road'', and on the corner is the former residence of [[Margaret Thatcher]], Prime Minister from 1979–90, now a [[chiropractic]] clinic. On the right hand side is [[The King's School, Grantham]], and there is the JET ''Grantham Service Station'' on the right, followed by the ''Waggon &amp; Horses''. At this point the road begins to follow the [[River Witham]], which is to the east. It meets ''Belton Lane'' at traffic lights and [[Grantham and Kesteven Hospital|Grantham and District Hospital]] is on the left which is near [[The Priory Ruskin Academy]]. ''Manthorpe Road'' passes through [[Manthorpe, Grantham|Manthorpe]], and the [[John the Evangelist|St John the Evangelist]] [http://www.stjohnmanthorpe.org.uk church] is on the left. There is a left turn for [[Great Gonerby]].

At [[Belton, Lincolnshire|Belton]] there is a left exit for the Belton Woods Hotel, country club and golf course. The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] [[Belton House]] is to the east. The road used to pass through Belton, to the left, but is bypassed. [[Syston, Lincolnshire|Syston]] is now bypassed to the east. The road takes a shorter route through [[Barkston]], passing ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716215852/http://www.the-stag.com/ The Stag]'' and the [[BP]] ''Barkston Service Station''. The former route went past the primary school and church. At the Twelve Acre Plantation at [[Honington, Lincolnshire|Honington]], the route leaves the main road to the left, which continues as the [[A153 road|A153]] (for [[Sleaford]]). It crosses the [[Poacher Line|Grantham to Skegness Line]] at a level crossing. At [[Carlton Scroop]] the [[Viking Way]] follows the road from the church of St Nicholas, and passes over the former Grantham-Lincoln railway. [http://www.sudbrookmoor.co.uk Sudbrook Moor] golf club is to the south, and in front is a [[Telecommunications towers in the United Kingdom|BT transmitter]] on the southern beginnings of the [[Lincoln Cliff]], which follows the road to Lincoln. The Viking Way leaves the road to the east, and the road passes through [[Normanton, Lincolnshire|Normanton-on-Cliffe]].

[[File:Looking down the A607 towards the Post Office - geograph.org.uk - 1191573.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Leadenham]]
The former Grantham-Lincoln railway crosses the road at the point where it enters [[Frieston]]. The road passes to the west of [[Caythorpe, Lincolnshire|Caythorpe]] on higher ground. On leaving [[Fulbeck]], the road enters [[North Kesteven]] and passes over the [[A17 road (England)|A17]] Leadenham bypass (built in March 1995). It passes the church of St Swithun, and there are traffic lights at crossroads where the road formerly met the A17. In the north of the village is the [[Total S.A.|TOTAL]] ''F Troop &amp; Son'' garage.  At [[Welbourn]] it crossed the former Grantham-Lincoln railway with the William Robertson school accessed to the right.

[[File:Lincoln Cliff - geograph.org.uk - 327576.jpg|thumb|140px|right|[[Lincoln Cliff]] between Boothby Graffoe and Coleby]]
Entering [[Wellingore]] the road ascends the [[Lincoln Cliff]] and the villages from here to Lincoln are known as the cliff villages. It passes All Saints church and is crossed by the [[Viking Way]]. The villages of Wellingore and [[Navenby]] run into each other. The Viking Way follows road, to the west, from here to Lincoln. At [[Boothby Graffoe]] the road passes St Andrews church and meets the B1202, for [[Metheringham]] to the east and is crossed by 400&amp;nbsp;kV pylons. It passes to the east of [[Coleby, North Kesteven|Coleby]] and at [[Harmston]] the road is briefly joined by the [[Viking Way]] and there is crossroads with the B1178, to the east. [[RAF Waddington]]'s airfield is nearby to the right. The road passes through [[Waddington, Lincolnshire|Waddington]], and bisects the older village to the left with the newer RAF housing to the right, passing the JET (former [[Texaco]]) ''Waddington Service Station''. On the road to [[Bracebridge Heath]], there are views from the [[Lincolnshire limestone|limestone]] edge of [[North Hykeham]] to the west. Entering Bracebridge Heath as ''Grantham Road'', it briefly follows the line of the former [[Roman road]] [[Ermine Street]], passing the [[Total S.A.|TOTAL]] ''Bracebridge Heath Filling Station'', then diverts to right, passing St John's church and meets the [[A15 road (England)|A15]] at traffic lights and a T junction.

'''Avala''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Авала}}, {{IPA-sh|âv̞ala|pron}}) is a [[List of mountains in Serbia|mountain]] in [[Serbia]], overlooking [[Belgrade]]. It is situated in the south-eastern corner of the city and provides a great panoramic view of Belgrade, [[Vojvodina]] and [[Šumadija]], as the surrounding area on all sides is mostly lowlands. It stands at {{convert|511|m}} above [[sea level]], which means that it enters the mountain category just by {{convert|11|m|abbr=on}}.

== Location ==

Avala is located {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="Politika"&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Marija Brakočević| title = Avala – lepotiva Beograda: Zaboravljena planina | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 13 November 2016 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/367701/Zaboravljena-planina}}&lt;/ref&gt; south-east of downtown Belgrade. The entire area of the mountain belongs to the Belgrade City area, majority of it being in the municipality of [[Voždovac]], with the eastern slopes being in the municipality of [[Grocka]], and the southernmost extension in the municipality of [[Sopot, Serbia|Sopot]]. It is possible that in the future the entire area of Avala will create a separate municipality of Belgrade, named [[Avalski Venac]].

== Geography ==

Avala is a low type of the [[Pannonian Island Mountains|Pannonian island mountain]], though it is actually the northernmost mountain in [[Šumadija]]. Until 600,000 years ago, when the surrounding low areas were flooded by the inner [[Pannonian Sea]], Avala was an island, just as the neighboring mountains (Kosmaj, [[Fruška Gora]], etc.), thus earning its geographical classification. However, the Avala remains an "island mountain" as the area around it, [[Pinosava]] plateau of the northern Low Šumadija, is low and mostly flat. In the north it extends into the woods of [[Stepin Lug]].

The mountain is built of [[serpentinite]], [[limestone]] and [[magmatic rock]]s, which are injected in the shape of [[cone (geometry)|cone]] ([[laccolith]]). Other peaks include Ladne vode ({{convert|340|m|abbr=on}}), Zvečara ({{convert|347|m|abbr=on}}), Sakinac ({{convert|315|m|abbr=on}}). The Avala had deposits of [[ore]]s, most notably [[lead]] and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]'s ore of [[cinnabarite]] but mining activities which can be traced to the pre-[[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] times. Archeologist [[Miloje Vasić]] believed that the vast mines of cinnabarite (mercury-sulfide) on Avala were crucial for the development of the [[Vinča culture]], on the banks of the [[Danube]] circa 5700 BC. Settlers of Vinča apparently melted cinnabarite and used it in metallurgy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srpska enciklopedija, Vol. II, page 142-143|date=2013|publisher=''[[Matica Srpska]]'', ''[[Srpska akademija nauka i umetnosti]]'', ''Zavod za udžbenike''|isbn=978-86-7946-121-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Medieval Serbia]] mining began in c.1420, after the Law on mines was issued by the Despot [[Stefan Lazarević]] in 1412.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | author = Novak Bjelić | title = Казивања о "Трепчи": 1303-2018 - Рудници под једном капом | trans-title = Tales of "Trepča": 1303-2018 - Mines under one administration | newspaper = Politika | page = 20 | language = Serbian | date = 30 Mar 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, the cinnabarite was used for the [[fresco]] paintings and was exported to Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Branka Jakšić | title = Pogled s neba i podzemne avanture | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 24 September 2017 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/389373/Pogled-s-neba-i-podzemne-avanture }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mining activities ceased by the 1960s, when the last two mines, Šuplja Stena and Crveni Breg, were closed.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt; Šuplja Stena ("Hollow Boulder") was a mercury mine while in Crveni Breg ("Red Hill"), lead, zinc, silver and gold were extracted. Crveni Breg was closed in 1953 and has traces of the usage from the Roman period. It has seven levels, out of which four are flooded, and the [[stalactites]] are being formed inside. By 2009 upper level was prepared for the visitations, being cleaned and lighted for some {{convert|300|m|abbr=on}} but the project of turning it into the tourist attraction failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Marija Brakočević | title = Rudnik na Avali čeka posetioce | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 29 May 2009 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/89049/Rudnik-na-Avali-ceka-posetioce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avala is also a location where the mineral [[avalite]], named after the mountain, was found. A greenish mineral, [[chromium|chromian]], [[magnesium|magnesian]] or [[potassium|potassic]] alumosilicate (variety of the mineral [[illite]]), it was discovered by Serbian chemist [[Sima Lozanić]] who established its formula. Optically examined by the [[Israel]]i mineralogist [[Tamir Grodek]] who classified it as a member of the [[mica]] mineral group.&lt;ref&gt;''Srpska porodična enciklopedija'', Vol. I, "Narodna knjiga" &amp; "Politika", 2006, {{ISBN|86-331-2730-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the southern slopes, in the area of Ripanj, the closed ''Tešićev Majdan'' ("Tešić Quarry") is located. The [[stone pit]] was privately owned, but was confiscated by the state after [[World War II]] and stopped operating before 1960. In the process of the restitution after 2000, the quarry was returned to the surviving owners, but they live abroad so the quarry is still not operational. It is the only known location of [[kersantite]] in Serbia, a worldwide rare type of greenish [[granite]]. For decades, kersantite was used for the Belgrade buildings, including some of the most representative ones. Features built with this stone include the fountain between the [[Novi Dvor]] and [[Stari Dvor]], bordure of the [[Hotel Bristol, Belgrade|Hotel Bristol]], [[Small Staircase in Kalemegdan Park]], pedestal of the Play of Black Horses statues in front of the [[House of the National Assembly of Serbia]] and buildings of [[Belgrade Cooperative]], [[Elementary School King Petar I]], [[Cathedral Church of St. Michael the Archangel]] and [[Main Post Office Building]]. As the buildings began to deteriorate in time, city authorities showed interest in the quarry, not only for the repairs but also for the future construction. For now, when some deteriorated kersantine feature has to be replaced, the artificial stone is used (as in the case of the pedestal of the Play of Black Horses). Geologists suggested to the city to obtain the ownership over the land on which the pit is located and to reopen it. City government announced in 2012 that it will unilaterally explore the pit until it gets reopened and inspected it in 2013. They found still existing large amounts of already cut kersantite and that locals illegally extract the stone and crush it to cover the roads with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author =Marija Brakočević  | title = Malo stepenište na Kalemegdanu čeka beogradski kamen | newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 27 October 2013 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/274086/Malo-stepeniste-na-Kalemegdanu-ceka-beogradski-kamen#!}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the political change in Belgrade in the late 2013, the motion was dropped.

On the mountain itself, there are several springs, of which the Sakinac is best known.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt; Despite being the only mountain in the area, the Avala is not a source of many rivers. The [[Topčiderka]] river, originating in the woods of [[Lipovička šuma]] on the south-west, flows on the western slopes of Avala, while the river [[Bolečica]] flows on the eastern slopes. Other minor flows include the Vranovac, a tributary to the Bolečica. Small artificial lake near the village of Pinosava is created on the western slope of the mountain. The settlements in the area are notorious for problems with shortages of drinking water during summer.

=== Protection ===
[[File:Avala sa Ibarske magistrale.png|thumb|270px|View of Avala]]

Despite being officially protected for almost 150 years, it was only in 2007 that preservation plans for the mountain were made. That way, Avala entered a circle of protected green areas of Belgrade, which also included the mountain of Kosmaj, the island of [[Veliko Ratno Ostrvo]] and the woods of Stepin Lug, with the forests of [[Košutnjak]] and [[Topčider]] to be added next. Protected areas of Avala spread over {{convert|489,13|ha|abbr=off}}

=== Plant life ===

Avala is known for its diverse plant life, despite not being a tall mountain. There are over 600 plant species living on the mountain. Some of them are protected by the law as natural rarities, like certain types of [[laburnum]], [[box tree]], [[black broom]], [[common holly]] and [[martagon lily]].&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt; The area is also abundant in medical [[herbs]], like the [[early-purple orchid]] and [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]. Almost 70% of Avala is forested.&lt;ref name="prestonica"&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author =Vladimir Vukasović | title = Prestonica dobija još devet prirodnih dobara| newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = 9 July 2013 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/260268/Prestonica-dobija-jos-devet-prirodnih-dobara }}&lt;/ref&gt; High woods mostly consist of [[durmast oak]], [[Quercus cerris|Turkey oak]], [[hornbeam]], [[beech]], [[Tilia|linden]], [[European black pine|black pine]], [[black locust]] and other trees.

=== Animal life ===

Almost 100 species of birds live on Avala, including strictly protected [[Eurasian sparrowhawk]], [[European honey buzzard]] and [[European green woodpecker]].&lt;ref name="prestonica"/&gt;

A section of the mountain is organized as a game hunting ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Branka Vasiljević | title = Lovci u Beograd stižu porodično | trans-title = Hunters travel to Belgrade with their families | newspaper = Politika | language = Serbian | date = 5 August 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/408612/Lovci-u-Beograd-stizu-porodicno }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
[[File:Zrnov1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Žrnov fortress, destroyed in 1934]]

In the [[Middle Ages]], the town of [[Žrnov]] or "Avalski Grad" (Avala town) was located on top of Avala. In 1442. it was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]], which built a new town in Žrnov's place as a counter-fortress to the Belgrade city fort, and renamed it "havale", which originally comes from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and means "obstacle" or "shelter".

== Human history ==
{{also|Žrnov}}

The mountain has been protected since 1859&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=|first=|author=J.Lucić|title=Avala&amp;nbsp;– predeo izuzetnih odlika|newspaper=[[Politika]]|pages=23|language =Serbian|date=29 March 2008|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[natural monument]], or, by the modern standards, "sight of the exquisite values". That year, Prince [[Miloš Obrenović]] of Serbia issued an order for the Avala to get fenced and protected that way. Remains of the medieval Žrnov were removed in 1934 to make way for the [[Monument to the Unknown Hero]]. The destruction of Žrnov, which was demolished with dynamite, caused a massive discontent among the citizens of Belgrade.&lt;ref name="detalj"&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Staniša B. Jovanović | title = Detaljnije o Avali | newspaper = Politika | pages =  | language = Serbian | date = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], the mountain was declared a [[national park]], in 1936. In 1946, by the [[ukaz]] of the [[Presidium]] of the [[National Assembly of Serbia]], Avala was reduced to the status of the "public property of general benefit" and placed under direct management of the [[Government of Serbia]].

Avala was a key point during the [[Belgrade Offensive]] in October 1944, a fighting for the liberation of Belgrade in World War II. Germans halted their mechanized units along the Smederevo road, at [[Mali Mokri Lug]], continued equipped with the light weapons and spread over Avala. German units were commanded by lieutenant general {{ill|Walter Stettner|de|Walter Stettner Ritter von Grabenhofen}}, who was killed during the battle. Germans also had a [[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen|7th SS division]] at the mountain, but after the joint attack of Yugoslav Partisans and Red Army, Belgrade was liberated on 20 October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Dimitrije Bukvić | title = Noć kad se usijalo nebo nad Beogradom | trans-title = The night when the sky above Belgrade incandescent | newspaper = Politika | page = 08 | language = Serbian | date = 21 October 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/413801/Noc-kad-se-usijalo-nebo-nad-Beogradom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, a {{convert|202|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} [[Avala TV Tower]] was constructed, one of the tallest structures in the [[Balkans]], by the architects [[Uglješa Bogunović]], [[Slobodan Janjić]] and M. Krstić. It had a restaurant-look out on {{convert|120|m|abbr=on}}. The tower was destroyed during the [[NATO bombing of Serbia]] in 1999. Its total reconstruction began in 2006 and was officially opened at a ceremony on 21 April 2010. The new tower is almost the exact replica of the destroyed one, including the unique three-feet base. Belgrade's General Urbanistic Plan (GUP) for the 2001-2021 period defines the mountain as a sports and recreation area.

=== Settlements ===

Settlements near the mountain are not much populous. They include [[Ripanj]] (on the south, the largest one, with a population of  11,088 by the 2011 census of population), [[Pinosava]] (on the west, 3,151), [[Zuce]] (on the north-east, 2,001), [[Beli Potok (Belgrade)|Beli Potok]] (on the north, 3,621), all in the municipality of Voždovac, and [[Vrčin]] (on the east, 9,088), in the municipality of Grocka.

=== Administration ===

A motion is in the process of creating a new municipality called Avalski Venac, which would include all these settlements and possible few others, but Zoran Alimpić, the acting mayor of Belgrade from September 2007 to August 2008, stated that new municipalities will probably not be formed before 2011 or 2012. The idea was later put on hiatus.

== Transportation ==

Avala is well connected with Belgrade and other parts of Serbia via roads, highway and railroads.

''Avalski drum'' ("Avala road") is an extension of the Boulevard of the Liberation, which directly connects the mountain to downtown Belgrade (via neighborhoods of [[Selo Rakovica]], [[Jajinci]], [[Banjica]], Voždovac, [[Autokomanda]], [[Karađorđev Park]] and [[Slavija Square|Slavija]]). On the mountain, ''Avalski drum'' divides in three:
* one section is a circular road which goes to the top of the mountain.
* second section continues to the south-west, through [[Ripanj]], Lipovička Šuma and [[Barajevo]], and makes a connection to the major road in the western Serbia, ''Ibarska magistrala''.
* third section goes south-east, parallel to the highway, through [[Trešnja]] and [[Ralja (Sopot)|Ralja]] and further to the south and east (where it meets the highway).
Sub-Avalan settlements are directly connected to Belgrade by the bus lines of the city's public transportation, with terminus in the Belgrade's neighborhood of [[Trošarina]].

The [[E75 in Serbia|Belgrade–Niš highway]], a section of one of the major European roads, [[European route E75]], runs east of the mountain, through Vrčin. North of the mountain runs ''Kružni put'', the most important road in the southern outskirts of Belgrade, which connects all the southern sections of the city. It is also a projected route of the future [[Belgrade beltway]] which would continue through the Bolečica river valley and the projected [[Vinča]]-[[Omoljica]] bridge over [[the Danube]] into Vojvodina.

Railroads also run on both sides of the mountain. Eastern branch is a section of the Belgrade-Niš railroad. It runs through the tunnel under the Avala at Beli Potok and then through Včrin. Western branch runs through Ripanj and the long "Ripanj tunnel" (though not under the Avala), and continues into western Serbia and further into [[Montenegro]], as part of the [[Belgrade–Bar railway]].

== Tourism ==
 [[File:Avala TV Tower.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Avala TV Tower]]

Avala is a traditional picnic resort for Belgraders, but its capacities are not being used much. In 1984 number of tourists was only 15,700 despite over 1.5 million of inhabitants in Belgrade. Some attractions and capacities on the mountain include:
* [[Šuplja Stena]], a former very popular children's resort, located on the mountain's [[wind rose]]; after the 1990s it turned into a residential place refugees from the [[Yugoslav Wars]] but was reconstructed and reopened in 2012;
* [[Avala Tower]], landmark TV Tower that was destroyed during the [[1999 NATO bombing of Serbia]], later rebuilt in 2010; In June 2017 the tourist complex was opened at the base of the tower. It includes, among other facilities, a restaurant, ethno-gallery, souvenir shop, sports fields and outdoor gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Ana Vuković | title = Kompleks na Avali dobio novi izgled | newspaper = Politika | pages = 14 | language = Serbian | date = 10 June 2017 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Weekend-settlement on the southern slopes;
* Motel "1000 Ruža" in Beli Potok; now adapted into the 3-star hotel;
* Hotel "Avala"; built in 1928 by the Russian architect Viktor Lukomsky. Russian sculptor Aleksandr Zagrodnyuk sculpted two sphinx which are located at the hotel’s north side, on the staircase to the hotel’s terrace. The hotel was privatised in 2005, but in 2007 it was declared a cultural monument;&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;
* [[Ripanj#Boroughs|Trešnja resort]], in the southernmost extension of the mountain;
* Mountaineering camp of [https://web.archive.org/web/20100723125241/http://www.brest.co.rs/ ''Čarapićev  brest'']; Projected by the architect Slobodan Mihajlović in the 1960s, on the northern slopes of the Avala, above Beli Potok. It was renovated in 2003;&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;
* Mountaineering camp of ''Mitrovićev dom''. It was made of wood and stone and named (“Mitrović Home”) after dr Dušan Špirta Mitrović, a medical doctor and volunteer on the [[Salonika Front]]. In 1981 it was declared a [[cultural monument]] but in 2014 it burned to the ground in the fire. In 2016-17 it was reconstructed to look exactly the same way it looked before the fire.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;
* One of only three officially designated [[campsites]] in Belgrade by 2018 is located on the mountain. A small camping ground, it is situated on the slopes in the Ripanj section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Ana Vuković | title = Kamping turizam – neiskorišćena šansa | trans-title = Camping tourism - missed chance | newspaper = Politika | page = 14 | language = Serbian | date = 16 August 2018 | url = http://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/409400/Kamping-turizam-neiskoriscena-sansa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monuments on Avala ===

Special attractions of the Avala are several monuments. They include:
[[File:Monument to the Unknown Hero Avala1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Monument to the Unknown Hero]]
[[File:Avala soviet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Monument to the Soviet war veterans]]

* [[Monument to the Unknown Hero]] - dedicated to the unknown Serbian soldier from [[World War I]]; sculptured by [[Ivan Meštrović]] in the form of [[mausoleum]] with 8 [[caryatide]]s ([[column]]s shaped like female figures, in this case each one representing a woman from a different historical region of [[Yugoslavia]]), it was completed in 1938. An earlier monument was erected in 1915 at the location by the German soldiers, on the orders of [[Field marshal]] [[August von Mackensen]].
* [[Monument to the Soviet war veterans]] - dedicated to the members of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military delegation which died in an airplane crash on the Avala on October 19, 1964. They were flying to Belgrade for the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the liberation of Belgrade in [[World War II]], October 20, 1944, as [[Red Army]] forces participated in the expulsion of [[Germans]]. Among those killed in the crash were [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Sergey Semyonovich Biryuzov]], chief of the [[Staff (military)|General Staff]] and [[first deputy defense minister]] of the Soviet Union and General [[Vladimir Ivanovich Zhdanov]]. The monument was sculptured by [[Jovan Kratohvil]].
* Memorial Park&amp;nbsp;– dedicated to the victims of the [[World War II]]
* Monument to [[Vasa Čarapić]] - dedicated to Vasa Čarapić, one of the leaders of the [[First Serbian Uprising]] in 1804 and liberator of Belgrade from the Turks, built in Beli Potok, his birthplace, near the mountaineers home ''Čarapićev brest''. It was sculptured in 1991 by [[Dušan Nikolić]].

=== Mountaineering camp ===

Annually, from July 1 until July 10, a traditional camp of Serbian mountaineers is held on the Avala. Among other mountaineering activities, there are competitions in:
* [[Orienteering]]
* [[Climbing]] (on an outdoor [[Climbing wall]])
* [[Mountain biking]]
* [[Mountain running]]

=== Ski center ===

The first skiing competition in Yugoslavia was held on Avala in 1929 and the first local, Serbian competition after World War II was also held here, in 1946. The usual route was the one starting at the logger's cabin and ending all the way to the foothills above Ripanj. The tracks were quite crude. Despite low altitude, construction of the [[ski resort]], with sports and recreational venues and a [[Aerial lift|cable car]] have been proposed in 1994 and 2005. In October 2018, city government announced plans to set a {{convert|550|m|abbr=on}} long [[piste]]. The construction of the complex, which is planned to be operational over the entire year (skiing specifically from November to February), should start in 2019. The piste will start in the immediate vicinity of the tower and end at the logger's cabin. Due to the altitude and the climate, the north-western slope is chosen. The track has been labeled as the "blue", which means it is of and intermediate level of difficulty.&lt;ref name=crta&gt;{{cite news | author = Ana Vuković | title = Avala izlazi na crtu Kopaoniku | trans-title = Avala dares Kopaonik | newspaper = Politika | page = 15 | language = Serbian | date = 14 October 2018 | url = http://www.politika.co.rs/sr/clanak/413234/Avala-izlazi-na-crtu-Kopaoniku}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phase I includes the construction of the piste, [[ski lift]], training trail, [[snowmaking]] cannons, decorative lights, parking lots and special machinery. Phase II comprises the building of the [[bobsled]] on rails track, [[zip-line]], mini golf course, artificial climbing rock, children playground and an [[adventure park]]. Projected price is €5 million.&lt;ref name=crta/&gt;

==History==
This ancient route predates the [[Norman Conquest]]&lt;ref&gt;The Normans in Norfolk, By Sue Margeson, Fabienne Seillier and Andrew Rogerson, Pub:1994,Link between Norman Castles in Norfolk, {{ISBN|0-903101-62-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was used by pilgrims who travelled between the Saxon cathedral, seat of the [[Bishop of East Anglia]], at [[North Elmham]] and the abbey at [[Walsingham#Priory|Walsingham]] and [[Binham Priory]]. This ancient road also can be seen very clearly on William Faden’s map of Norfolk&lt;ref&gt;Faden’s Map of Norfolk 1797, Digitally redrawn in 2005 by Andrew Macnair. North Central Map {{ISBN|978-0-9550398-2-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was surveyed between 1790 and 1794. This map, the first large-scale map (at one inch to the mile) of the whole county, is a record of the landscape and transport system of the county of Norfolk in late 18th century, and shows that despite the [[Inclosure Act|Parliamentary Enclosure]] of the early 19th century the route has changed very little. Much of the route on the map is highlighted in a pale pink which marks it out as an important artery of the time.

The '''Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route''' ({{lang-ru|Главное Управление Северного Морского Пути |translit=Glavnoe upravlenie Severnogo morskogo puti}}), also known as '''Glavsevmorput''' or '''GUSMP''' ({{lang-ru|ГУСМП}}), was a Soviet government organization in charge of the maritime [[Northern Sea Route]], established in January 1932 and dissolved in 1964.

==History==

The organization traces its roots to AO Komseverput ({{lang-ru|Комитет Северного морского пути |translit= Komitet Severnogo morskogo puti}}) or KSMP, a shipping company established by the [[Aleksandr Kolchak|Kolchak government]] in 1919 and subsequently nationalized by the [[Bolsheviks]]. In May 1931 AO Komseverput was reorganized into VO Glavkomseverput; the organization employed 35,000 men scattered all over Arctic, as well as a sizable staff in Moscow and in other mainland cities. A new office, Glavsevmorput, was established in December 1932 and absorbed VO Glavkomseverput in May 1933.&lt;ref&gt;75 years of Northern Sea Route, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; Overall management was assigned to the Arctic explorer [[Otto Schmidt]], who had previously managed the Arctic Institute (VAI, later AANII). Glavsevmorput had its own Polar Air service [[Aviaarktika]], headed by [[Mark Shevelev]].
 
Glavsevmorput, in addition to running Arctic shipping, also became the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agency for exploiting resources across the [[Russian Far North | far north]] and coordinating supplies and transport. It aimed to contribute to the development of northern coastal [[Siberia]]; the office was empowered to establish seaports, conduct extensive research, and trade with the [[United States]] and [[Japan]] as was necessary to its principal function. The organization's quick unchecked expansion, especially in its Moscow offices, was initially masked by the successes of the 1934-1936 seasons.&lt;ref name=B22&gt;Barr 1980, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the season of 1937, through a combination of unrealistic plans, bad weather and bad luck, proved a disaster.&lt;ref name=B23&gt;Barr 1980, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; Twenty-five of 64 ships dispatched on the route (many of them not fit for Arctic conditions) were trapped with crews and cargoes in the Arctic winter; one, ''Rabochiy'', sank.&lt;ref name=B22&gt;Barr 1980, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; The débâcle, which coincided with the [[Great Purge]] of 1936-1938, led to a string of arrests; at least 673&lt;ref&gt;75 years of Northern Sea Route, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; Glavsevmorput personnel were arrested in a [[domino effect | domino-effect]] [[NKVD]] operation. The oversized organization was streamlined and stripped of auxiliary functions that were delegated to [[Dalstroy]] (land facilities) and to the State trading company {{ill|Gostorg|ru|Госторг}} (foreign trade). Glavsevmorput was to concentrate exclusively on maintaining the Northern Sea Route, specifically running its coastal shipping line. 

Otto Schmidt, once an extremely highly publicized personality, was spared but demoted to scientific duties; overall management of the organization was assigned{{by whom?|date=June 2017}} to [[Ivan Papanin]], a famous [[North Pole|polar]] explorer. Papanin's first season, 1939, was a relatively safe and successful one; the Northern SeaRoute had become a functioning regular line, rather than a dangerous experiment.&lt;ref name=P4&gt;75 years of Northern Sea Route, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953 the organization, previously enjoying the status of a national ministry, was downgraded to a department within the Ministry of Merchant Fleet. In 1964 the department was dissolved. Its units were reassigned to the {{ill|Ministry of the Merchant Fleet|ru|Список министров транспорта СССР и России}}, the {{ill|Hydrometeorological Service of the USSR|ru|Федеральная служба по гидрометеорологии и мониторингу окружающей среды}} and the {{ill|Soviet Ministry of Civil Aviation|ru|Министерство гражданской авиации СССР}}. The system continued working and reached peak capacity in 1987.&lt;ref name="P4"/&gt;

A large island at the mouth of the [[Kolyma River]] (Mikhalkino) was named Glavsevmorput (or GUSMP) Island in honour of the organization {{coord|69|30|N|161|30|E|}}.

'''Clement Adams''' (1519? – 1587), was an English schoolmaster and author, noted for producing an engraving of [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]]'s map of the world, sometime after 1544.

==Biography==
Adams was born at [[Buckington]], Warwickshire, about 1519. He was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], and thereafter elected to [[King's College, Cambridge]], 17 August 1536, of which he is supposed to have been elected fellow in 1539.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=ADMS536C|name=Adams, Clement}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the degree of [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1540–1, and of M.A. in 1544, and was appointed schoolmaster to the "young courtly companions of [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]"&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Baldwin | first =R. C. D. | title =Adams, Clement (c.1519–1587), schoolmaster and map engraver| work = [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] | publisher =Oxford University Press  |year =2004 | url =http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/112 | accessdate = 2009-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Greenwich]] 3 May 1552, at a salary of £10 per annum. He died 9 Jan 1586–7, and was buried at St. Alphege, Greenwich.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Coote | first =C.

The earliest mention of Adams in the printed literature of the sixteenth century is by his contemporary, [[Richard Eden]], the father of English geography. From the pages of his little read and less known ''Decades'' we learn that Clement Adams was a schoolmaster and not a traveller. To Adams we owe the first written account of the earliest English intercourse with Russia. Eden writes: ‘Wheras I have before (p. 252) made mention howe Moscouia was in our tyme discoured by the direction and information of the sayde master Sebastian [Cabote] who longe before had this secreate in his minde, I shall not neede here to describe that viage, forasmuch as the same is largely and faithfully written in the Latyn tonge by that lerned young man, Clement Adams, scol mayster to the Queenes henshemen (i.e. pages of honour) as he received it at the mouth of the sayde Richard Chancelor.'&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

The incidental allusion to the old pilot major Sebastian Cabot has some significance in connection with Adams. Cabot, it is well known, made a famous Mappe-monde, recording, among other things, the discoveries of himself and his father, [[John Cabot]], along the coast of 'Newfoundland' (either [[Nova Scotia]] or [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]) in 1497, the date of which discovery has been the subject of much debate among geographers and antiquaries. A contemporary copy of Cabot's map, discovered in Germany, is preserved in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], the original of which is now lost, in a volume edited by Nathan Chytræus, first published in 1594. It would appear that there was also a copy preserved at Oxford at the period named; be this as it may, we learn from [[Richard Hakluyt|Hakluyt]], in 1584, that yet another copy was made and 'cut' by Adams, which was evidently well known at the period, for we read in a manuscript by Hakluyt on ''Westerne Planting'' (discovered in 1854) of 'the copye of [Gabote's] map sett out by Mr. Clemente Adams, and is in many marchants houses in London.' Hakluyt, five years later, amplifies this statement as to the map by Adams, in quoting a legend relating to the discoveries of the Cabots to be found upon it, described by him as 'an extract taken out of the mappe of Sebastian Cabot, cut by Clement Adams, concerning his [Cabot's] discovery of the West Indias which is to be seene in her Maiesties privie gallerie at Westminster, and in many other ancient merchants houses.' No copy of this map engraved by Adams is now known to exist.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

The only basis for the assumption that he was a traveller is the association of his name with that of [[Richard Chancellor]]. That he did not accompany Chancellor in his first voyage to Russia in 1553 is certain, for the name of every person above the rank of an ordinary seaman that accompanied both Sir [[Hugh Willoughby]] and Chancellor in the voyage is preserved to us in the pages of Hakluyt (cf. edition of 1589, p.&amp;nbsp;266). The name of the only clerkly person among the two crews was that of John Stafford, 'minister' on board the 'Edward Bonaventure,' commanded by Chancellor.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

The work referred to by Eden was committed to writing by Adams upon Chancellor's return from his first voyage to Russia in 1554. The title runs thus: ‘Nova Anglorum ad Moscovitas navigatio Hugone Willowbeio equite classis præfecto, et Richardo Cancelero nauarcho. Authore Clemente Adamo, Anglo.’ It was first printed by Hakluyt in his Collections of 1589. This is followed by a translation headed thus: ‘The newe Nauigation and discouerie of the kingdome of Moscouia, by the North east, in the yeere 1553; Enterprised by Sir Hugh Willoughbie, knight, and perfourmed by Richard Chanceler, Pilot maior of the voyage. Translated out of the former Latine into English,’ probably by Hakluyt himself. In the two subsequent editions of Hakluyt the Latin text by Adams is omitted.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

The '''Daunians''' ({{lang-el|Δαύνιοι|Daúnioi}}; {{lang-la|Daunii}}) were an [[Iapygians|Iapygian]] tribe which inhabited northern [[Apulia]] in [[classical antiquity]]. Two other Iapygian tribes, the [[Peucetians]] and the [[Messapians]], inhabited central and southern Apulia respectively. All three tribes spoke the [[Messapian language]], but had developed separate [[archaeological culture|archaeological cultures]] by the seventh century BC. The Daunians lived in the eponymous region '''Daunia''', which extended from the [[Ofanto]] river in the southeast to the [[Gargano]] peninsula in the northwest.{{sfn|Carpenter|Lynch|Robinson|2014|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=WmSnBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2 2], [https://books.google.com/books?id=WmSnBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18 18] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=WmSnBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38 38]}} This region is mostly coincident with the [[Province of Foggia]] today.

Towards the late [[Bronze Age]] (11th-10th centuries BC), [[Illyrian tribes|Illyrian populations]] from the eastern [[Adriatic]] arrived in [[Apulia]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Anthon [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn949Sr-POkC&amp;pg=PA417&amp;lpg=PA417&amp;dq=ancient+city+of+daulia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DUIhdTGV-f&amp;sig=ulOrvMvN_Qr2K7srxB0b0TpfqoU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ynYwTZbxMdjPjAeOzIDFCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=daunia&amp;f=false A Classical Dictionary: Containing the Principle Proper Names Mentioned in Ancient Authors - Part One] (Daunia, page 417) {{ISBN|1-4191-7384-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Illyrians in Italy, united with the pre-existing people and groups from the Aegean, probably from Crete, created the Iapygian civilization which consisted of three tribes: [[Peucetia]], [[Messapi]] and the Dauni.&lt;ref name=ICCD&gt;{{cite web|title=The origins of the Daunia civilization and the early Iron Age |website=ICCD (Istituto Centrale per il Cataklogo e la Documentazione  |url=http://www.itinerarimusividaunia.beniculturali.it/index.php?en/89/the-origins-of-the-daunia-civilization-and-the-early-iron-age}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region was previously inhabited by [[Italic peoples]] of [[Southern Italy]]; among them are the [[Ausones]]/[[Osci|Oscans]], [[Sabines]], [[Lucani (ancient people)|Lucani]], [[Paeligni]], [[Bruttii]], [[Campanians]], [[Aequi]], [[Samnites]] and [[Frentani]].

The Dauni were similar to but also different from the Peucetii and Messapii, who settled in central and southern Puglia.{{r|ICCD}}  Having been also less influenced by the Campanian civilization, it had thus a more peculiar culture, featuring in particular the [[Daunian stele]]s, a series of funerary monuments sculpted in the 7th-6th centuries BC in the plain south of [[Siponto]], and now mostly housed in the National Archeological Museum of Manfredonia. Particularly striking is the [[Daunian pottery]] (as yet little studied) which begins with geometric patterns but which eventually includes crude human, bird and plant figures.

The main Daunian centers were ''Teanum Apulum'' (within the modern [[San Paolo di Civitate]]), 
Uria Garganica, the location of which though is not known with certainty, Casone, [[Lucera]], ''Merinum'' ([[Vieste]]), Monte Saraceno (near [[Mattinata]]), [[Siponto]], Coppa Navigata, Cupola, [[Salapia]] (near [[Cerignola]] and [[Manfredonia]]), Arpi (near [[Foggia]]), ''Aecae'' (near [[Troia (FG)|Troia]]), ''Vibinum ''([[Bovino]]), [[Castelluccio dei Sauri]], ''Herdonia'' ([[Ordona]]), ''Ausculum ''([[Ascoli Satriano]]), Ripalta (near Cerignola), [[Canosa di Puglia]], [[Melfi]], [[Lavello]] and [[Venosa]].

==Etymology==
The ethnonym is connected to the name of the wolf, plausibly the totemic animal of this nation. The cult of the wolf was widespread in ancient Italy and was related to the Arcadian mystery cult. In fact, ''daunos'' means wolf, according to ancient glosses, and is the correspondent of Greek ''taunos'' from an [[Indo-European root]] *dhau- to strangle, meaning literally ''strangler''. Among the Daunian towns one may mention Lucera (Leucaria) and among other nations the ethnonym of the Lucani (Loucanoi) and that of the Hirpini, from another word meaning wolf. The outcome of the [[Proto-Indo-European]] voiced aspirate ''dh'' is proper of the Illyrian languages and so is different from the corresponding Latin ''faunus'' and Oscan, which is not attested.

==Presence in ancient Italy==
There are numerous testimonies among ancient authors ([[Pseudo-Scylax]], [[Virgil]], [[Festus (historian)|Festus]], [[Servius]]) of a presence of the Daunians beyond the Apennines in [[Campania]] and [[Latium]] where some towns claimed Diomedian origins. The most notable instance is [[Ardea, Lazio|Ardea]], the centre of the [[Rutulians]] who were considered Daunians: Vergil writes that Turnus' father was Daunus. Festus writes that a King [[Lucerus]] of Ardea fought along with [[Romulus]] against [[Titus Tatius]] and this is the origin of the name of the Roman [[List of Roman tribes|Luceres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Dominique |last=Briquel |authorlink = Dominique Briquel|title=Le problème des Dauniens |journal=Mélanges de l'Ecole française de Rome.

'''Demir Hisar''' ({{lang-mk|Демир Хисар}}), also known as ''Železnec'' ({{lang|mk|Железнец}}), is an area spreading on the South West part of [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] to the North West of the Pelagonian plain, around the river flow of the Black River (''Crna Reka'') with her inflows. The greater parts of the surrounding area of Demir Hisar are smaller hills and mountains, and a small part which is spread around the mentioned river is low lands. A signature of this area are the mountains [[Bigla]], [[Ilinska]] and [[Plakenska]], on which is the highest peak reaching 2000 m which separates the region of Demir Hisar with the lake regions of [[Prespa]] and [[Ohrid]].

==Name==
The name of Demir Hisar derives from the treasure of iron which the surrounding mountains in this region have, which is why it is called ''Iron Fortress''. The name has been changed according to the ruler and his ruling period. When it was ruled by the [[Greeks]], it was known as [[Sidero Kastron]] which in translation means ‘Iron Fortress’, and when it was overtaken by the Ottoman army, the name was changed into ”Demir Hisar” which in their language also means ‘’ Iron Fortress’’. “[[Demir Hisar (town)|Demir Hisar]]” was maintained as the town's name when in [[Yugoslavia]], and remained so in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. 

==Population==

The community of Demir Hisar comprises 10,610 inhabitants, 0.53% of the population of [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], and 21% of them live in the town [[Demir Hisar (town)|Demir Hisar]]. The town is spread over 473&amp;nbsp;km² and it is accounted that nearly 23.6 people live per square kilometre. With the new structure of the territory of the Republic of Macedonia, the municipality of Sopotnica was integrated into [[Demir Hisar municipality]]. Today the municipality of Demir Hisar is spread over a territory of 473&amp;nbsp;km². As part of this municipality, 41 inhabited places are included, from which the central part is the town Demir hisar with a population of 2,447.

==History==

The community started developing somewhere in 1945 soon after the end of the [[Second World War]]. First in Demir Hisar was formed a political – social administrative community – Local public administration, and it was placed in the village of [[Lopatica, Bitola|Lopatica]] but then, with the change of the territorial and urban laws in the republic, it was set in [[Murgaševo]]. 

Demir Hisar as a  community is an independent society which is in constant progress, and now is a well-developed and well-known place in the Republic, with their own systems for water, electricity, garbage disposal systems and extensive roads that lead to neighbouring communities.

==Culture==
[[File:Demir-hisarska nosija.jpg|thumb|Couple wearing traditional dress in 1915 in Demir Hisarka]]

Folk ensemble "Ilinden" works in the Cultural Educational Centre. It has a small, middle, and big group, own orchestra with a total of 150 members. The ensemble was formed in 1993. With it work three choreographers as external collaborators of the CEC. At repertoire of folk ensemble there are 10 choreographies which are presented afore citizens of Demir Hisar, in neighborhood municipalities and wide in Macedonia and abroad (Serbia and Montenegro, Bulgaria and Austria). In these places ensemble "Ilinden" has received widespread recognition and awards.

Mention must be made of participation in festivals like "Ilindenski Denovi" [[Bitola]], "Injevo" -[[Radovis]], "10 days Krusevo Republic" - [[Krusevo]], days of Cultural Educational Centres of Macedonia, etc.
 
Guests of ensemble "Ilinden" have been many ensembles from many countries like, "Ograzdence" - [[Petrich|Petric]] (Bulgaria), "Nisan" - [[Sandanski]] ([[Bulgaria]]), "Kapance" - Razgrad (Bulgaria), "Tanasko Rajic" - Cacak (Serbia and Montenegro), "Stubline" -[[Obrenovac]] ([[Serbia and Montenegro]]) and "Floricanka" - [[Razin]] ([[Moldavia]]).
Cultural Educational Centre "Ilinden" - Demir Hisar, with [[Folk Ensemble]] up to now have great cooperation with other Cultural Educational Centers in Macedonia, and that cooperation brings many collective concerts (with Krusevo, Makedonski Brod, Demir Kapija) and concerts with ensembles "Ilinden" - Bitola, and "Vlado Tasevski" - Skopje.

Ilinden plans many new visits for the future in Macedonia as well as abroad.

There are a number of uncertainties and '''disputed issues in the early''' [[history of Islam]].{{efn|[[Islam]] started with Muhammad. [[Muslim]]s believe that Islam did not start with him, but that it represents even previous [[Prophet]]s, such as [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]], [[David in Islam|David]], [[Moses in Islam|Moses]], [[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]], [[Noah in Islam|Noah]] and [[Adam in Islam|Adam]].&lt;ref name="Esposito1998"&gt;{{cite book |last=Esposito |first=John |title= Islam: The Straight Path (3rd ed.) |year=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-511234-4 |pages=9, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Esposito2002b"&gt;Esposito (2002b), pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peters |first=F.E. |title=Islam: A Guide for Jews and Christians |year=2003 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-11553-2 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Most of these disputes can be traced to [[Shi'a]]-[[Sunni]] disagreements. Shi'a often argue that history has been distorted to further a [[Banu Umayyad]] agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Some 20th-century Shia scholars have protested the conversion of history into mythology. Prominent critics include: [[Morteza Motahhari]] ([http://al-islam.org/al-tawhid/ashura/ Meaning of 'Ashura: Misrepresentations &amp; Distortions], [http://www.al-islam.org/al-tawhid/ashura/1.htm 'Ashura - History and Popular Legend] and [http://www.imamalinet.net/vigenam/moharam1422/en/e2.htm 'Ashura - Misrepresentations and Distortions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051114091437/http://www.imamalinet.net/vigenam/moharam1422/en/e2.htm |date=November 14, 2005 }}), Abbas Qomi, author of ''Nafas al-Mahmoum'' ([http://www.al-islam.org/nafas/ Nafasul Mahmoom]), and Sayyid Abd-al-Razzaq Al-Muqarram, author of Maqtalul-Husayn ([http://www.bookrags.com/research/usayn-ibn-al-al--eorl-06/ Ḥusayn Ibn ʿAlī, Al, Encyclopedia of Religion])&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, complications with the [[historiography of early Islam]] have also resulted in lack of consensus within denominations of Islam.

The '''Eötvös effect''' is the change in perceived gravitational force caused by the change in centrifugal acceleration resulting from eastbound or westbound velocity.  When moving eastbound, the object's angular velocity is increased (in addition to the [[earth's rotation]]), and thus the centrifugal force also increases, causing a perceived reduction in gravitational force.

In the  early 1900s (decade), a German team from the Institute of [[Geodesy]] in Potsdam carried out gravity measurements on moving ships in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. While studying their results the Hungarian nobleman and physicist Baron Roland von Eötvös ([[Loránd Eötvös]]) noticed that the readings were lower when the boat moved eastwards, higher when it moved westward. He identified this as primarily a consequence of the rotation of the earth. In 1908 new measurements were made in the Black Sea on two ships, one moving eastward and one westward. The results substantiated Eötvös' claim. Since then geodesists use the following formula to correct for velocity relative to the Earth during a measurement run.

:&lt;math&gt; a_r = 2  \Omega  u  \cos \phi + \frac{u^2 + v^2}{R}. &lt;/math&gt;

Here,
:&lt;math&gt;a_r&lt;/math&gt; is the relative acceleration
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the rotation rate of the Earth
:&lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity in latitudinal direction (east-west)
:&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the latitude where the measurements are taken.
:&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity in longitudinal direction (north-south)
:&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the Earth

The first term in the formula, 2''Ωu''&amp;nbsp;cos(φ), corresponds to the Eötvös effect. The second term is a refinement that under normal circumstances is much smaller than the Eötvös effect.

== Physical explanation ==

The most common design for a [[gravimeter]] for field work is a spring-based design; a spring that suspends an internal weight.  The suspending force provided by the spring counteracts the gravitational force. A well manufactured spring has the property that the amount of force that the spring exerts is proportional to the extension of the spring from its equilibrium position ([[Hooke's law]]). The stronger the effective gravity at a particular location, the more the spring is extended; the spring extends to a length at which the internal weight is sustained. Also, the moving parts of the gravimeter will be dampened, to make it less susceptible to outside influences such as vibration.

For the calculations it will be assumed that the internal weight has a mass of 10 kilograms, 10,000&amp;nbsp;grams. It will be assumed that for surveying a method of transportation is used that gives good speed while moving very smoothly: an airship. Let the cruising velocity of the airship be 25 meters per second (90&amp;nbsp;km/h, 55 miles/h).

=== Motion along the equator ===
[[File:Eotvos efect on 10Kg.png|thumb|300 px|Graph of the force experienced by a 10 kilograms object as a function of its speed moving along Earth's equator (as measured within the rotating frame). (Positive force in the graph is directed upward. Positive speed is directed eastward and negative speed is directed westward).]]
To calculate what it takes for the internal weight of a gravimeter to be neutrally suspended when it is stationary with respect to the Earth, the Earth's rotation must be taken into account. At the equator, the velocity of Earth's surface is about 465 meters per second. The amount of centripetal force required to cause an object to move along a circular path with a radius of 6378 kilometres (the Earth's equatorial radius), at 465&amp;nbsp;m/s, is about 0.034 newtons per kilogram of mass. For a 10,000-gram internal weight, that amounts to about 0.34 newtons. The amount of suspension force required is the mass of the internal weight (multiplied by the acceleration of gravity) minus those 0.34 newtons. In other words: any object co-rotating with the Earth at the equator has its measured weight reduced by 0.34 percent, thanks to the Earth's rotation.

When cruising at 10&amp;nbsp;m/s due East, the total velocity becomes 465&amp;nbsp;+ 10&amp;nbsp;= 475&amp;nbsp;m/s, which requires a centripetal force of about 0.0354 newtons per kilogram. Cruising at 10&amp;nbsp;m/s due West the net velocity is 465&amp;nbsp;− 10&amp;nbsp;= 455&amp;nbsp;m/s, requiring about 0.0325 newtons per kilogram. So if the internal weight is neutrally suspended while cruising due East, after reversing course it will not be neutrally suspended any more: the apparent mass of the 10,000-gram internal weight will increase by about 3&amp;nbsp;grams, and the spring of the gravimeter must extend some more to accommodate this greater weight.

In high-performance meteorological models, this effect needs to be taken into account on a terrestrial scale. Air masses with significant velocity with respect to the Earth have a tendency to migrate to another [[altitude]], and when the accuracy demands are strict this must be taken into account.

=== Derivation of the formula for simplified case ===

Derivation of the formula for motion along the Equator.

A convenient coordinate system in this situation is the inertial coordinate system that is co-moving with the center of mass of the Earth. Then the following is valid: objects that are at rest on the surface of the Earth, co-rotating with the Earth, are circling the Earth's axis, so they are in centripetal acceleration with respect to that inertial coordinate system.

What is sought is the difference in centripetal acceleration of the surveying airship between being stationary with respect to the Earth and having a velocity with respect to the Earth. The following derivation is exclusively for motion in east-west or west-east direction.

Notation:
:&lt;math&gt; a_u &lt;/math&gt; is the total centripetal acceleration when moving along the surface of the Earth.
:&lt;math&gt; a_s &lt;/math&gt; is the centripetal acceleration when stationary with respect to the Earth.
:&lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; is the angular velocity of the Earth: one revolution per [[Sidereal day]].
:&lt;math&gt; \omega_r &lt;/math&gt; is the angular velocity of the airship relative to the angular velocity of the Earth.
:&lt;math&gt; \left(\Omega +  \omega_r\right) &lt;/math&gt; is the total angular velocity of the airship.
:&lt;math&gt; u = \omega_r R &lt;/math&gt; is the airship's velocity (velocity relative to the Earth).
:&lt;math&gt; R&lt;/math&gt; is the Earth's radius.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a_r &amp; = a_u - a_s \\
    &amp; = \left(\Omega + \omega_r\right)^2 R - \Omega^2 R \\
    &amp; = \Omega^2 R + 2 \Omega \omega_r R + \omega_r^2 R  - \Omega^2 R \\
    &amp; = 2 \Omega \omega_r R + \omega_r^2 R \\
    &amp; = 2 \Omega u + \frac{u^2}{R} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It can readily be seen that in the case of motion along the equator the formula for any latitude simplifies into the formula above.
:&lt;math&gt; a_r = 2 \Omega u \cos\phi + \frac{u^2 + v^2}{R} &lt;/math&gt;

The second term represents the required [[centripetal acceleration]] for the airship to follow the curvature of the earth. It is independent of both the Earth's rotation and the direction of motion. For example, when an aeroplane carrying gravimetric reading instruments cruises over one of the poles at constant altitude, the aeroplane's trajectory follows the curvature of the  earth. The first term in the formula is zero then, due to the cosine of the angle being zero, and the second term then represents the centripetal acceleration to follow the curvature of the Earth's surface.

=== Explanation of the cosine in the first term ===

[[Image:Forces oblate spheroid2.gif|frame|right|The force of gravity and the [[normal force]]. The resultant force acts as the required centripetal force.]]

The mathematical derivation for the Eötvös effect for motion along the Equator explains the factor 2 in the first term of the Eötvös correction formula. What remains to be explained is the cosine factor.

Because of its rotation, the Earth is not spherical in shape, there is an [[Equatorial bulge]]. The force of gravity is directed towards the center of the Earth. The [[normal force]] is perpendicular to the local surface.

On the poles and on the equator the force of gravity and the normal force are exactly in opposite direction. At every other latitude the two are not exactly opposite, so there is a resultant force, that acts towards the Earth's axis. At every latitude there is precisely the amount of centripetal force that is necessary to maintain an even thickness of the atmospheric layer. (The solid Earth is ductile. Whenever the shape of the solid Earth is not entirely in equilibrium with its rate of rotation, then the [[shear stress]] deforms the solid Earth over a period of millions of years until the shear stress is resolved.)

Again the example of an airship is convenient for discussing the forces that are at work. When the airship has a velocity relative to the Earth in latitudinal direction then the weight of the airship is not the same as when the airship is stationary with respect to the Earth.

If an airship has an eastward velocity, then the airship is in a sense "speeding". The situation is comparable to a racecar on a banked circuit with an extremely slippery road surface. If the racecar is going too fast then the car will drift wide. For an airship in flight that means a reduction of the weight, compared to the weight when stationary with respect to the Earth.

If the airship has a westward velocity then the situation is like that of a racecar on a banked circuit going too slow: on a slippery surface the car will slump down. For an airship that means an increase of the weight.

The first term of the Eötvös effect is proportional to the component of the required centripetal force perpendicular to the local Earth surface, and is thus described by a cosine law: the closer to the Equator, the stronger the effect.

The same gravimeter is used again, its internal weight has a mass of 10,000&amp;nbsp;grams.

Calculating the weight reduction when stationary with respect to the Earth: &lt;br/&gt;
An object located at 60 degrees latitude, co-moving with the Earth, is following a circular trajectory, with a radius of about 3190 kilometer, and a velocity of about 233&amp;nbsp;m/s. That circular trajectory requires a centripetal force of about 0.017 newton for every kilogram of mass; 0.17 newton for the 10,000&amp;nbsp;gram internal weight. At 60 degrees latitude, the component that is perpendicular to the local surface (the local vertical) is half the total force. Hence, at 60 degrees latitude, any object co-moving with the Earth has its weight reduced by about 0.08 percent, thanks to the Earth's rotation.

Calculating the Eötvös effect: &lt;br/&gt;
When the airship is cruising at 25&amp;nbsp;m/s towards the east the total velocity becomes 233&amp;nbsp;+ 25&amp;nbsp;= 258&amp;nbsp;m/s, which requires a centripetal force of about 0.208 newton; local vertical component about 0.104 newton. Cruising at 25&amp;nbsp;m/s towards the west the total velocity becomes 233&amp;nbsp;− 25&amp;nbsp;= 208&amp;nbsp;m/s, which requires a centripetal force of about 0.135 newton; local vertical component about 0.068 newton. Hence at 60 degrees latitude the difference before and after the U-turn of the 10,000&amp;nbsp;gram internal weight is a difference of 4&amp;nbsp;grams in measured weight. (Popularly spoken as the weight is a force being measured in newtons, not in grams.)

The diagrams also show the component in the direction parallel to the local surface. In [[meteorology]] and in [[oceanography]], it is customary to refer to the effects of the component parallel to the local surface as the [[Coriolis effect]].

[[File:Aruba World Wind.jpg|{{largethumb}}|Satellite image of [[Aruba]]]]

[[Aruba]] is an island in the south of the [[Caribbean]] in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. It is westernmost island of the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC Islands]] and of the [[Leeward Antilles]]. It is located at {{coord|12|30|N|69|58|W|region:AW_type:isle|display=inline}}, 25&amp;nbsp;km north of the coast of [[Venezuela]] and 68&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Curaçao]]. The island has a total area of {{convert|193|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} and a coast line of {{convert|68.5|km|mi|abbr=on}}. [[Mount Jamanota]] of {{convert|188|m|ft|abbr=on}} is the highest point.

Politically, Aruba is a [[Countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands|constituent country]] of the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]] is the largest settlement with a population of 32,748.

== Natural geography ==


Aruba's terrain is mostly flat with a few hills. There are some little ways of vegetation or outstanding physical features and no inland water. Aruba's best-known geographical feature is its white-sand beaches, which are the basis of an active tourism industry that is the mainstay of the island's economy. Aruba is situated on the Caribbean Plate Caribbean Tectonic Plate. Aruba, as well as the rest of the ABC islands and also Trinidad and Tobago, lies on the continental shelf of South America, and is thus geologically considered to lie entirely in South America.

The core of the island is made up of Turonian submarine and subaerial basalts which were formed in the Caribbean large igneous province. These basalts were intruded by a pluton shortly after their eruption. The shore areas are mainly limestone that capped hills and ridges, with cliffs on the northern and northeastern coasts and coral reefs on the southern coast.

===Mountains and hills===
Aruba's terrain is almost entirely flat,Rock formations characterize the interior of the island. The two most known rock formations are Ayo Rock Formations and Casibari, both are tourist attractions.

Along the northern coast it is more hilly, especially in the Arikok National Park. The highest elevation, so-called Mount Jamanota, is only {{convert|188|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level and the Arikok itself is {{convert|186|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The Hooiberg is {{convert|165|m|ft|abbr=on}}. While the Hooiberg is not the highest point on the island, it does look so, because of the flat surroundings it lies in. The Hooiberg can be seen from nearly every point of the island and is so known it has its on place on the Coat of arms of Aruba.

===Coast and beaches===
Aruba has three deepwater harbors located at Oranjestad, Aruba-Oranjestad, Barcadera, and San Nicolaas. The southern coastal area is known for its white-sand beaches and the calm waters surrounding Aruba are clear, making it a popular tourist destination. While its northern coast is rocky and mostly formed by corral plateaus with many small sandy bay like openings called 'Bocas', Papiamento for mouths. The sea is rough and dark blue compared with the southern coastal areas and swimming here is discouraged.

==Climate==
Aruba’s [[Semi-arid climate#hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] varies little seasonally, with an average annual temperature of {{convert|28.1|°C|1}}, varying from about {{convert|26.7|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|29.2|°C|1}} in September.

The rainy season occurs between October and December, but exhibits very high variability due to the powerful influence of the [[Southern Oscillation]].&lt;ref&gt;Dewar, Robert E. and Wallis, James R; ‘Geographical patterning of interannual rainfall variability in the tropics and near tropics: An L-moments approach’; in ''[[Journal of Climate]]'', 12; pp. 3457-3466&lt;/ref&gt; During strong [[El Niño]] years like 1911/1912, 1930/1931, 1982/1983 and 1997/1998 annual (fiscal year) rainfall can be as little as {{convert|150|mm|in|0|disp=or}}, while in contrast, as much as {{convert|1000|mm|in|0|disp=or}} may fall during a strong [[La Niña]] year like 1933/1934, 1970/1971, 1988/1989, 1999/2000 or 2010/2011. The highest monthly totals during these La Niña events are between {{convert|350|and|400|mm|in|0}}.

Most rain brought by the prevailing easterly winds of the region falls on the [[Windward Islands]] of the [[Lesser Antilles]], leaving Aruba in a [[rain shadow]]. Rainfall averages {{convert|472|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} or less annually, and the island’s residents rely on one of the world’s largest [[desalination]] plants for most of their drinking water.

[[Belize]] is a small [[Central America]]n [[nation]], located at 17°15' north of the [[equator]] and 88°45' west of the [[Prime Meridian]] on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. It borders the [[Caribbean Sea]] to the east, with 386&amp;nbsp;km of coastline. It has a total of 542&amp;nbsp;km of land borders—[[Mexico]] to the north-northwest (272&amp;nbsp;km) and Guatemala to the south-southwest (266&amp;nbsp;km). Belize's total size is 22,966&amp;nbsp;km², of which 22,806&amp;nbsp;km² is land and 160&amp;nbsp;km² is water.

Belize is the only country in Central America without a [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coastline. Many [[coral reef]]s, [[cay]]s, and [[island]]s to the east—such as [[Ambergris Caye]], [[Lighthouse Reef]], [[Glover's Reef]], and the [[Turneffe Islands]]—are part of Belize's territory, forming the [[Belize Barrier Reef]], the longest in the western hemisphere stemming approximately {{convert|322|km|mi|abbr=on}} and the second longest in the world after the [[Great Barrier Reef]]. Belize's largest river is the eponymous [[Belize River]]. Belize's lowest [[elevation]] is at [[sea level]]. Its highest point is [[Doyle's Delight]] at {{convert|1124|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

The climate in Belize is tropical, with a rainy season from June to November and a dry season from January to May. [[Natural hazard]]s include [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] (mostly in the late [[Atlantic hurricane season]], September to December) and coastal [[flooding]], especially in the south.

==Physical features==
Topographical feature divide the Belizean landscape into two main physiographic regions. The most visually striking of these regions is distinguished by the [[Maya Mountains]] and the associated basins and plateaus that dominate all but the narrow coastal plain in the southern half of the country. The mountains rise to heights of about 1,100 metres, with the highest point being [[Doyle's Delight]] (1,124 m) in the Cockscomb Range, a spur of the [[Maya Mountains]] in Western Belize. Covered with shallow, highly erodible soils of low fertility, these heavily forested highlands are very sparsely inhabited.

The second region comprises the northern lowlands, along with the southern coastal plain. Eighteen major rivers and many perennial streams drain these low-lying areas. The coastline is flat and swampy, with many lagoons, especially in the northern and central parts of the country. Westward from the northern coastal areas, the terrain changes from mangrove swamp to tropical pine savanna and hardwood forest.

[[File:Maritime Boundaries of Belize.svg|thumb|left|Map of Belize's [[exclusive economic zone]]]]
Belize claims an [[exclusive economic zone]] of {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|lk=in}} and a [[Territorial waters|territorial sea]] of {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1}}. From the mouth of the [[Sarstoon River]] to Ranguana Cay, Belize's territorial sea is {{convert|3|nmi|km mi|1|abbr=on}}; according to Belize's Maritime Areas Act, 1992, the purpose of this limitation is to provide a framework for the negotiation of a definitive agreement on territorial differences with Guatemala.

Belize is the only country in Central America without a coastline on the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific Ocean]].

===Rivers===
{{See also|List of rivers of Belize}}
The interlocking networks of rivers, creeks, and lagoons have played a key role in the historical geography of Belize. The largest and most historically important river is the [[Belize River]], which drains more than one-quarter of the country as it winds along the northern edge of the Maya Mountains across the center of the country to the sea near Belize City. Also known as the Old River, the Belize River is navigable up to the Guatemalan border and served as the main artery of commerce and communication between the interior and the coast until well into the twentieth century.

Other historically important rivers include the [[Sibun River]], which drains the northeastern edge of the Maya Mountains, and the [[New River (Belize)|New River]], which flows through the northern sugar-growing areas before emptying into [[Chetumal Bay]]. Both of these river valleys possess fertile alluvial soils and have supported considerable cultivation and human settlement.

===Islands===
{{See also|List of islands of Belize}}

==Climate==
Belize has a tropical climate with pronounced wet and dry seasons, although there are significant variations in weather patterns by region. Temperatures vary according to elevation, proximity to the coast, and the moderating effects of the northeast trade winds off the Caribbean. Average temperatures in the coastal regions range from {{convert|24|°C}} in January to {{convert|27|°C}} in July. Temperatures are slightly higher inland, except for the southern highland plateaus, such as the Mountain Pine Ridge, where it is noticeably cooler year round. Overall, the seasons are marked more by differences in humidity and rainfall than in temperature.

Average rainfall varies considerably, ranging from {{convert|1350|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in the north and west to over {{convert|4500|mm|in|1|sp=us}} in the extreme south. Seasonal differences in rainfall are greatest in the northern and central regions of the country where, between January and April or May, fewer than {{convert|100|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of rain fall per month. The dry season is shorter in the south, normally only lasting from February to April. A shorter, less rainy period, known locally as the "little dry," usually occurs in late July or August, after the initial onset of the rainy season.

=== Hurricanes ===
Hurricanes have played a devastating role in Belizean history. In 1931 an unnamed hurricane destroyed over two-thirds of the buildings in Belize City and killed more than 1,000 people. In 1955 [[Hurricane Janet]] leveled the northern town of Corozal. Six years later, [[Hurricane Hattie]] struck the central coastal area of the country, with winds in excess of {{convert|300|km/h|mph|0|sp=us}} and {{convert|4|m|ft|1|adj=on|sp=us}} storm tides. The devastation of Belize City for the second time in thirty years prompted the relocation of the capital some {{convert|80|km|mi|0|sp=us}} inland to the planned city of [[Belmopan]]. A hurricane that devastated Belize was [[Hurricane Greta-Olivia|Hurricane Greta]], which caused more than US$25 million in damages along the southern coast in 1978.

There was a period of 20 years that Belize was considered as a hurricane-free zone by many until [[Hurricane Mitch]] (October 1998) caused quite a stir and gave rise to hurricane awareness and the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO).  Two years later [[Tropical Storm Chantal (2001)|Tropical Storm Chantal]] and [[Hurricane Keith]] did much to put the country on the hurricane map.

In 2001, [[Hurricane Iris]] swept through the southern part of Belize causing damage that ranged in the hundreds of millions due largely to wiping away the [[banana]] industry, crippling the [[citrus]] and tourism in the area.  Six years later, the fury of [[Hurricane Dean|Category Five Dean]] landed on the Yucatán coast at Mahahual and Corozal in northern Belize, was not spared the brunt of reportedly Category 3 to 4 winds.  Hurricane Dean did tens of millions in damages, especially to the infantile [[papaya]] industry and to a lesser extent to the endemic [[sugar cane]] industry.

[[File:Mountain Pine Ridge Uploaded on November 28, 2007 by tomeppy (cropped).jpg|thumb|center|800px|The [[Mountain Pine Ridge Forest Reserve]], Belize.]]

==Geology==
Belizean geology consists largely of varieties of [[limestone]], with the notable exception of the [[Maya Mountains]], a large uplifted block of intrusive [[Paleozoic]] [[granite]] and sediments running northeast to southwest across the south-central part of the country. Several major [[Fault (geology)|faults]] rive these highlands, but much of Belize lies outside the [[Tectonics|tectonically active]] zone that underlies most of Central America. During the [[Cretaceous]] Period, what is now the western part of the Maya Mountains stood above sea level, creating the oldest land surface in Central America, the Mountain Pine Ridge plateau.

The hilly regions surrounding the Maya Mountains are formed from Cretaceous limestone. These areas are characterized by a [[karst topography]] that is typified by numerous [[sinkhole]]s, [[cave]]rns, and underground streams. In contrast to the Mountain Pine Ridge, some of the soils in these regions are quite fertile and have been cultivated during at least the past 4,000 years.

Much of the northern half of Belize lies on the Yucatán Platform, a tectonically stable region. Although mostly level, this part of the country also has occasional areas of hilly, karst terrain, such as the Yalbac Hills along the western border with Guatemala and the Manatee Hills between Belize City and [[Dangriga]]. Alluvial deposits of varying fertility cover the relatively flat landscapes of the coastal plains.

== Environmental issues ==
[[Environmental degradation]] issues in Belize include [[deforestation]], [[water pollution]] from [[sewage]], industrial [[effluent]]s, [[agricultural runoff]], and [[solid waste]] disposal.

Belize is party to the [[Basel Convention]], [[Convention on Biological Diversity]], [[Ramsar Convention]], [[CITES]], [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter]], [[International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[MARPOL 73/78]], [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]].

==Natural resources==
Although a number of economically important minerals exist in Belize, none has been found in quantities large enough to warrant their mining. Those minerals include dolomite, barite (source of barium), bauxite (source of aluminum), cassiterite (source of tin), and gold. In 1990 limestone, used in roadbuilding, was the only mineral resource being exploited for either domestic or export use.

The similarity of Belizean geology to that of oil-producing areas of Mexico and Guatemala prompted oil companies, principally from the United States, to explore for petroleum at both offshore and on-land sites in the early 1980s. Initial results were promising, but the pace of exploration slowed later in the decade, and production operations never commenced. As a result, Belize remains almost totally dependent on imported petroleum for its energy needs.

Belize has considerable potential for hydroelectric and other renewable energy resources, such as solar and biomass. In the mid-1980s a Belizean businessman proposed the construction of a wood-burning power station for the production of electricity, but the idea foundered in the wake of ecological concerns and economic constraints. In late 2005, a company named Belize Natural Energy found oil in commercial quantities in the [[Spanish Lookout]] area of Belize.

== Extreme points ==

* Northernmost point – [[Subteniente Lopez]]
* Southernmost point – Southwestern border with [[Guatemala]], near [[Chocon]]
* Westernmost point – Border with [[Guatemala]], at [[Sarstoon River]]
* Easternmost point – [[Lighthouse Reef]]
* Highest point – [[Doyle's Delight]]: 1124 m
* Lowest point – [[Atlantic Ocean]]: 0 m

{{Wiktionary}}
'''Hinterland''' is a German word meaning "the land behind" (a [[city]], a port, or similar).&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.pons.eu/english-german/hinterland Hinterland] – pons.eu, Pons Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; The term's use in English was first documented by geographer [[George Chisholm (geographer)|George Chisholm]] in his ''[[Handbook of Commercial Geography]]'' (1888).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9040530/hinterland Definition of the term ''hinterland'' on ''Encyclopædia Britannica''], britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and usage==

The term ''hinterland'' has several meanings. It may refer to:

==Geographic region==
* An area behind a coast or the shoreline of a river. Specifically, by the ''doctrine of the hinterland,'' the hinterland is the inland region lying behind a port and is claimed by the state that owns the coast.&lt;ref name="Kerr2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas Kerr|title=Eastern Figures: Orient and Empire in British Writing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUjqAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11#v=snippet&amp;q=%22doctrine%20of%20the%20hinterland%22&amp;f=false|date=June 1, 2008|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|isbn=978-962-209-934-0|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The area from which products are delivered to a port for shipping elsewhere is that port's hinterland.
* The term is also used to refer to the area around a city or town.
* More generally, ''hinterland'' can refer to the rural area economically tied to an urban [[catchment area]]. The size of a hinterland can depend on geography, or on the ease, speed, and cost of transportation between the port and the hinterland.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Woodburn, [http://www.unece.org/trans/doc/2009/wp5/ECE-TRANS-WP5-GE1-03-inf04e.ppt#257,1, Hinterland connections to seaports], unece.org, January 23, 2009.  Accessed 2009.10.01.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In [[shipping]] usage, a port's hinterland is the area that it serves, both for imports and for exports.
* In [[History of colonialism|colonial]] usage, the term was applied to the surrounding areas of former European colonies in Africa, which, although not part of the colony itself, were influenced by the colony. By analogous general economic usage, hinterland can refer to the area surrounding a service from which customers are attracted, also called the market area.
* In German, ''Hinterland'' is sometimes used more generally to describe any sparsely populated area where the infrastructure is underdeveloped, although ''Provinz'' (analogous to ''province'') is more common. In the United States, and particularly in the [[American Midwest]] (a region of German cultural heritage located far from ocean ports), it is this meaning and not the one relating to ports that predominates in common use. Analogous terms include  "the countryside", "the sticks", "the boonies", ''[[backcountry]]'', ''[[boondocks]]'', [[The Bush (Alaska)|the Bush]] (in Alaskan usage), and the [[outback]] (in Australian usage).

==Breadth of knowledge==
A further sense in which the term is commonly applied, especially by British politicians, is in talking about an individual's depth and breadth of knowledge of other matters (or lack thereof), specifically of academic, artistic, cultural, literary and scientific pursuits. For instance, one could say, "X has a vast hinterland", or "Y has no hinterland". The spread of this usage is usually credited to [[Denis Healey]] (British [[Secretary of State for Defence|Defence Secretary]] 1964–1970, [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] 1974–1979) and his wife [[Edna Healey]], initially in the context of the supposed lack of hinterland of former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/apr/14/biography.politicalbooks Roy Hattersley's review of Edward Pearce's biography of Healey], and Healey's autobiography ''Time of My Life'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Arrowsmith''' (1790–1873) was an [[England|English]] [[geography|geographer]] (mapmaker) and member of the Arrowsmith family of geographers. He was born at [[Winston, County Durham]].

In 1810 he joined his uncle [[Aaron Arrowsmith]] in his mapmaking business in [[London]].  In 1821, they published a map of  North America using a combination of a maps obtained from the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and Aaron's own previous work. After his uncle died in 1823, the business was carried on by his sons Aaron and Samuel Arrowsmith until 1839 when John Arrowsmith took over the business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Hayes | first = Derek | title =Historical Atlas of British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest | place=Vancouver | publisher = Cavendish Books | year =1999 | isbn = 1-55289-900-4|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1834 John published his ''London Atlas'', which were the best set of such maps then in existence. He followed the atlas with a long series of elaborate and carefully executed maps, those of [[Australia]], [[Americas|America]], [[Africa]] and [[India]] being especially valuable. In 1863 he received the gold medal of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], of which body he was one of the founders.

His maps were very numerous, and their neatness and finished style gained John a very extensive reputation. Arrowsmith was also a most industrious collector of materials.

[[Mount Arrowsmith]], situated east of [[Port Alberni]] on [[Vancouver Island]], [[British Columbia]], is named for John Arrowsmith and his uncle [[Aaron Arrowsmith]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20070815193807/http://ilmbwww.gov.bc.ca/bcgn-bin/bcg10?name=9247 Integrated Land Management Bureau, Government of British Columbia.] Geographic place names.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arrowsmith River]] in [[Western Australia]] was named by Sir [[George Grey]] after Arrowsmith, who later produced the maps for the published journals of Grey's two Western Australian expeditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Grey | first1 = George | title = Journals of two expeditions of discovery in North-West and Western Australia, during the years 1837, 38, and 39, describing many newly discovered, important, and fertile districts, with observations on the moral and physical condition of the aboriginal inhabitants, etc. etc. | volume = 2 | publisher = T. and W.

A '''land ethic''' is a philosophy or theoretical framework about how, ethically, humans should regard the land. The term was coined by [[Aldo Leopold]] (1887–1948) in his ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' (1949), a classic text of the environmental movement. There he argues that there is a critical need for a "new ethic," an "ethic dealing with human's relation to land and to the animals and plants which grow upon it".&lt;ref name=Leopold1949&gt;Leopold, A. 1949. ''A Sand County Almanac''. Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}} 

Leopold offers an ecologically based land ethic that rejects strictly human-centered views of the environment and focuses on the preservation of healthy, self-renewing ecosystems. ''A Sand County Almanac'' was the first systematic presentation of a holistic or ecocentric approach to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, Joseph R. ''Environmental Ethics: An Introduction to Environmental Philosophy'', 5th ed. Boston: Wadsworth, 2013, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; Although Leopold is credited with coining the term "land ethic," there are many philosophical theories that speak to how humans should treat the land. Some of the most prominent land ethics include those rooted in economics, utilitarianism, libertarianism, egalitarianism, and ecology.

==Economics-based land ethic==

This is a land ethic based wholly upon economic self-interest.&lt;ref name=Leopold1949/&gt;  Leopold sees two flaws in this type of ethic. First, he argues that most members of an ecosystem have no economic worth. For this reason, such an ethic can ignore or even eliminate these members when they are actually necessary for the health of the biotic community of the land. And second, it tends to relegate conservation necessary for healthy ecosystems to the government and these tasks are too large and dispersed to be adequately addressed by such an institution. This ties directly into the context within which Leopold wrote ''A Sand County Almanac.''

For example, when the [[US Forest Service]] was founded by [[Gifford Pinchot]], the prevailing ethos was economic and [[utilitarian]]. Leopold argued for an [[ecological]] approach, becoming one of the first to popularize this term coined by [[Henry Chandler Cowles]] of the [[University of Chicago]] during his early 1900s research at the [[Indiana Dunes]]. Conservation became the preferred term for the more anthropocentric model of [[resource management]], while the writing of Leopold and his inspiration, [[John Muir]], led to the development of [[environmentalism]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

==Utilitarian-based land ethic==

Utilitarianism was first put forth by British philosophers [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Though there are many varieties of [[utilitarianism]], generally it is the view that a morally right action is an action that produces the maximum good for people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/ ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''/ "History of Utilitarianism"]&lt;/ref&gt; Utilitarianism has often been used when deciding how to use land and it is closely connected with an economic-based ethic. For example, it forms the foundation for industrial farming; an increase in yield, which would increase the number of people able to receive goods from farmed land, is judged from this view to be a good action or approach. In fact, a common argument in favor of [[industrial agriculture]] is that it is a good practice because it increases the benefits for humans; benefits such as food abundance and a drop in food prices. However, a utilitarian-based land ethic is different from a purely economic one as it could be used to justify the limiting of a person's rights to make profit. For example, in the case of the farmer planting crops on a slope, if the runoff of soil into the community creek led to the damage of several neighbor's properties, then the good of the individual farmer would be overridden by the damage caused to his neighbors. Thus, while a utilitarian-based land ethic can be used to support economic activity, it can also be used to challenge this activity.

==Libertarian-based land ethic==

Another philosophical approach often used to guide actions when making (or not making) changes to the land is [[libertarianism]]. Roughly, libertarianism is the ethical view that agents own themselves and have particular moral rights, including the right to acquire property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/libertarianism/ Vallentyne, Peter, "Libertarianism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt; In a looser sense, libertarianism is commonly identified with the belief that each individual person has a right to a maximum amount of freedom or liberty when this freedom does not interfere with other people's freedom. A well-known libertarian theorist is [[John Hospers]]. For libertarians, property rights are natural rights. Thus, it would be acceptable for the above farmer to plant on a slope as long as this action does not limit the freedom of his or her neighbors.

This view is closely connected to utilitarianism. Libertarians often use utilitarian arguments to support their own arguments. For example, in 1968, [[Garrett Hardin]] applied this philosophy to land issues when he argued that the only solution to the "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]" was to place soil and water resources into the hands of private citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, Garrett. (1968) "The Tragedy of the Commons." ''Science'', 162, 1243-1248&lt;/ref&gt; Hardin supplied utilitarian justifications to support his argument. However, it can be argued that this leaves a libertarian-based land ethics open to the above critique lodged against economic-based approaches. Even excepting this, the libertarian view has been challenged by the critique that numerous people making self-interested decisions often cause large ecological disasters, such as the [[Dust Bowl]] disaster.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Paul 2010"&gt;Thompson, Paul. (2010) "Land." ''Life Science Ethics.'' ed. Gary L. Comstock. Raleigh: Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, libertarianism is a philosophical view commonly held within the United States and, especially, held by U.S. ranchers and farmers.

{{Dubious |Libertarian based |reason= Libertarianism is generally agreed to be a philosophy of the individual and the morality of ownership.  The Land Ethic, as described by Aldo Leopold, is a philosophy of community and interdependence.  These two ideas remain mutually exclusive despite the dogmatic attempt by the former to redefine the later.  |date=June 2013}}

==Egalitarian-based land ethic==

Egalitarian-based land ethics are often developed as a response to libertarianism. This is because, while libertarianism ensures the maximum amount of human liberty, it does not require that people help others. In addition, it also leads to the uneven distribution of wealth. A well-known egalitarian philosopher is [[John Rawls]]. When focusing on land use, egalitarianism evaluates its uneven distribution and the uneven distribution of the fruits of that land.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Paul 2010"/&gt; While both a utilitarian- and libertarian-based land ethic could conceivably rationalize this mal-distribution, an egalitarian approach typically favors equality, whether that be equal entitlement to land and/or access to food.&lt;ref&gt;Arneson, Richard, "Egalitarianism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is also the question of negative rights when holding to an egalitarian-based ethic. In other words, if it is recognized that a person has a right to something, then someone has the responsibility to supply this opportunity or item; whether that be an individual person or the government. Thus, an egalitarian-based land ethic could provide a strong argument for the preservation of soil fertility and water because it links land and water with the right to food, with the growth of human populations, and the decline of soil and water resources.&lt;ref name="Thompson, Paul 2010"/&gt;

==Ecologically based land ethic==

Land ethics may also be based upon the principle that the land (and the organisms that live off the land) has intrinsic value. These ethics are, roughly, based on an ecological or systems view. This position was first put forth by Ayers Brinser in ''Our Use of the Land'', published in 1939. Brinser argued that white settlers brought with them "the seeds of a civilization which has grown by consuming the land, that is, a civilization which has used up the land in much the same way that a furnace burns coal.”{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Later, [[Aldo Leopold]]'s posthumously published ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' (1949) popularized this idea. 

Another example is the [[deep ecology]] view, which argues that human communities are built upon a foundation of the surrounding ecosystems or the biotic communities, and that all life is of inherent worth.&lt;ref&gt;Naess, Arne (1973) "The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology Movement." ''Inquiry'' 16: 95-100&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to egalitarian-based land ethics, the above land ethics were also developed as alternatives to utilitarian and libertarian-based approaches. Leopold's ethic is one of the most popular ecological approaches in the early 21st century. Other writers and theorists who hold this view include [[Wendell Berry]] (b. 1934), [[N. Scott Momaday]], [[J. Baird Callicott]], [[Paul B. Thompson (philosopher)|Paul B. Thompson]], and [[Barbara Kingsolver]].

==Aldo Leopold's land ethic==
In his classic essay, "The Land Ethic," published posthumously in ''[[A Sand County Almanac]]'' (1949), Leopold proposes that the next step in the evolution of ethics is the expansion of ethics to include nonhuman members of the [[biotic community]],&lt;ref name=Leopold1949/&gt; collectively referred to as "the land." Leopold states the basic principle of his land ethic as: "A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise."

He also describes it in this way: "The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land . . . [A] land ethic changes the role of ''Homo sapiens'' from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it. It implies respect for his fellow-members, and also respect for the community as such."{{page needed|date=April 2018}}

Leopold was a naturalist, not a philosopher. There is much scholarly debate about what exactly Leopold's land ethic asserts and how he argues for it. At its core, the land ethics claims (1) that humans should view themselves as plain members and citizens of biotic communities, not as "conquerors" of the land; (2) that we should extend ethical consideration to ecological wholes ("soils, waters, plants, and animals"), (3) that our primary ethical concern should not be with individual plants or animals, but with the healthy functioning of whole biotic communities, and (4) that the "summary moral maxim" of ecological ethics is that we should seek to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. Beyond this, scholars disagree about the extent to which Leopold rejected traditional human-centered approaches to the environment and how literally he intended his basic moral maxim to be applied. They also debate whether Leopold based his land ethic primarily on human-centered interests, as many passages in ''A Sand County Almanac'' suggest, or whether he placed significant weight on the intrinsic value of nature. One prominent student of Leopold, [[J. Baird Callicott]], has suggested that Leopold grounded his land ethics on various scientific claims, including a Darwinian view of ethics as rooted in special affections for kith and kin, a Copernican view of humans as plain members of nature and the cosmos, and the finding of modern ecology that ecosystems are complex, interrelated wholes.&lt;ref&gt;Callicott, J. Baird. ''In Defense of the Land Ethic: Essays in Environmental Philosophy''. Albany: State University of New York Press, 1989, pp. 75-99.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this interpretation has recently been challenged by [[Roberta Millstein]], who has offered evidence that Darwin's influence on Leopold was not related to Darwin's views about moral sentiments, but rather to Darwin's views about interdependence in the struggle for existence.&lt;ref&gt;Millstein, Roberta L. (2015) “Re-examining the Darwinian Basis for Aldo Leopold’s Land Ethic,” Ethics, Policy &amp; Environment 18: 301-317.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attractions of Leopold's land ethic==

Leopold's ecocentric land ethic is popular today with mainstream environmentalists for a number of reasons. Unlike more radical environmental approaches, such as [[deep ecology]] or [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]], it does not require huge sacrifices of human interests. Leopold does not, for example, believe that humans should stop eating or hunting or experimenting on animals. Nor does he call for a massive reduction in human population, or for permitting humans to interfere with nature only to satisfy vital human needs (regardless of economic or other human costs). As an environmental ethic, Leopold's land ethic is a comparatively moderate view that seeks to strike a balance between human interests and a healthy and biotically diverse natural environment. Many of the things mainstream environmentalists favor--preference for native plants and animals over invasive species, hunting or selective culling to control overpopulated species that are damaging to the environment, and a focus on preserving healthy, self-regenerating natural ecosystems both for human benefit and for their own intrinsic value--jibe with Leopold's ecocentric land ethic.

A related understanding has been framed as [http://www.nature.com/news/govern-land-as-a-global-commons-1.22065 global land as a commons]. In this view biodiversity and terrestrial carbon storage - an element of climate change mitigation - are global public goods. Hence, land should be governed on a global scale as a commons, requiring increased international cooperation on nature preservation &lt;ref&gt;Creutzig, F. [http://www.nature.com/news/govern-land-as-a-global-commons-1.22065 Govern land as a global commons]. Nature 546:7656 pp. 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticisms==

Some critics fault Leopold for lack of clarity in spelling out exactly what the land ethic is and its specific implications for how humans should think about the environment.&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, ''Environmental Ethics'', pp. 186-88.&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that Leopold did not intend his basic normative principle ("A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community") to be regarded as an ethical absolute. Thus construed, it would prohibit clearing land to build homes, schools, or farms, and generally require a "hands-off" approach to nature that Leopold plainly did not favor. Presumably, therefore, his maxim should be seen as a general guideline for valuing natural ecosystems and striving to achieve what he terms a sustainable state of "harmony between men and land." But this is vague and, according to some critics, not terribly helpful.

A second common criticism of Leopold is that he fails to state clearly why we should adopt the land ethic.&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, pp. 185-88.&lt;/ref&gt; He often cites examples of environmental damage (e.g., soil erosion, pollution, and deforestation) that result from traditional human-centered, "conqueror" attitudes towards nature. But it is unclear why such examples support the land ethic specifically, as opposed to biocentricism or some other nature-friendly environmental ethic. Leopold also frequently appeals to modern ecology, evolutionary theory, and other scientific discoveries to support his land ethic. Some critics have suggested that such appeals may involve an illicit move from facts to values.&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, pp. 185-88.&lt;/ref&gt; At a minimum, such critics claim, more should be said about the normative basis of Leopold's land ethic.

Other critics object to Leopold's ecological holism. According to animal rights advocate, Tom Regan, Leopold's land ethic condones sacrificing the good of individual animals to the good of the whole, and is thus a form of "environmental fascism."&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Tom. ''The Case for Animal Rights''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983, pp. 361-62.&lt;/ref&gt; According to these critics, we rightly reject such holistic approaches in human affairs. Why, they ask, should we adopt them in our treatment of non-human animals?

Finally, some critics have questioned whether Leopold's land ethic might require unacceptable interferences with nature in order to protect current, but transient, ecological balances.&lt;ref&gt;DesJardins, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; If the fundamental environmental imperative is to ''preserve'' the integrity and stability of natural ecosystems, wouldn't this require frequent and costly human interventions to prevent naturally occurring changes to natural environments? In nature, the "stability and integrity" of ecosystems are disrupted or destroyed all the time by drought, fire, storms, pests, newly invasive predators, etc. Must humans act to prevent such ecological changes, and if so, at what cost? Why should we place such high value on current ecological balances? Why think it is our role to be nature's steward or policeman? According to these critics, Leopold's stress on preserving existing ecological balances is overly human-centered and fails to treat nature with the respect it deserves.

This is a '''list of ancient cities, towns, villages, and fortresses in and around Thrace and Dacia'''. A number of these settlements were [[Dacians|Dacian]] and [[Thracian]], but some were [[Celt]]ic, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Paeonian]], or [[Persian people|Persian]].

A number of cities in [[Dacia]] and [[Thrace]] were built on or close to the sites of preexisting Dacian or Thracian settlements. Some settlements in this list may have a double entry, such as the Paeonian ''Astibo'' and [[Latin]] ''Astibus''. It is believed that Thracians did not build true cities even if they were named as such; the largest Thracian settlements were large villages.&lt;ref name="The Cambridge Ancient History 1992, page 612"&gt;The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC by John Boardman, I. E. S. Edwards, E. Sollberger, and N. G. L. Hammond ,{{ISBN|0-521-22717-8}}, 1992, page 612: "Thrace possessed only fortified areas and cities such as Cabassus would have been no more than large villages. In general the population lived in villages and hamlets..."&lt;/ref&gt; The only known attempt to build a [[polis]] by the Thracians was [[Seuthopolis]].,&lt;ref&gt;An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis: An Investigation Conducted by The Copenhagen Polis Centre for the Danish National Research Foundation by Mogens Herman Hansen, 2005, page 888, "It was meant to be a polis but this was no reason to think that it was anything other than a native settlement."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 by Christopher Webber, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, 2001, page 1, "...the city of Seuthopolis seems to be the only significant town in Thrace not built by Greeks..."&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Strabo]] considered the Thracian cities with "bria" ending polises. Some of the Dacian settlements and fortresses employed the traditional [[Murus Dacicus]] construction technique.

Note: Throughout these lists, an asterisk [*] indicates that the [[toponym]] is reconstructed.

Many city names were composed of an initial [[lexeme|lexical element]] affixed to ''-dava'', ''-daua'', ''-deva'', ''-deba'', ''-daba'', or ''-dova'', which meant "city" or "town"   Endings on more southern regions are exclusively ''-bria'' ("town, city"), ''-disza'', ''-diza'', ''-dizos'' ("fortress, walled settlement"), ''-para'', ''-paron'', ''-pera'', ''-phara'' ("town, village"). [[Strabo]] translated -bria as polis, but that may not be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume 3, Part 2: The Assyrian and Babylonian Empires and Other States of the Near East, from the Eighth to the Sixth Centuries BC by John Boardman, I. E. S. Edwards, E. Sollberger, and N. G. L. Hammond, {{ISBN|0-521-22717-8}}, 1992, page 612: "According to Strabo (vii.6.1cf.st.Byz.446.15) the Thracian -bria word meant polis but it is an inaccurate translation."&lt;/ref&gt; Thracian ''-disza'', ''-diza'', and ''-dizos'' are derived from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*dheigh-'', "to knead clay", hence to "make bricks", "build walls", "wall", "walls", and so on. These Thracian lexical items show a [[satemization]] of [[PIE]] ''*gh-''. [[Cognates]] include [[Ancient Greek]] ''teichos'' ("wall, fort, fortified town", as in the town of [[Didymoteicho]]) and [[Avestan]] ''da?za'' ("wall").

It is suggested that the "dava" endings are from the [[Dacian language]], while the rest from the [[Thracian language]]. However "dava" towns can be found as south as [[Sandanski]] and [[Plovdiv]]. Some "dava" toponyms contain the same linguistic features as "diza" toponyms, e.g. [[Pirodiza]] and [[Pirodava]]. The first written mention of the name "Dacians" is in Roman sources. Strabo specified that the Daci are the Getae, identified as a Thracian tribe.  The [[Dacians]], [[Getae]] and their kings were always considered as Thracians by the ancients (Dio Cassius, Trogus Pompeius, Appian, Strabo, Herodotus and Pliny the Elder) and were said to speak the same language. The [[Dacian language]] is considered a variety of the [[Thracian language]].&lt;ref&gt;Peregrine, Peter N.; Ember, Melvin (2001). Encyclopedia of Prehistory. 4 : Europe. Springer. {{ISBN|978-0-306-46258-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such lexical differentiation -dava vs. para, would be hardly enough evidence to separate Dacian from Thracian, thus they are classified as dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Polomé, Edgar Charles (1982). "20e". In Boardman, John. Balkan Languages (Illyrian, Thracian and Daco-Moesian). The Cambridge Ancient History. Vol. 3, Part 1: The Prehistory of the Balkans; and the Middle East and the Aegean world, tenth to eighth centuries B.C. (2nd ed.). London: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-22496-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that '-dava' and '-bria' mean two different things in the same language, rather than meaning the same thing in two different languages. Thus bria could have been used for urbanized settlements, similar in scale and design to those of the "civilised" peoples like Greeks and Romans, whereas '-dava' could mean a settlement which is rural, being situated in the steppe-like part of the Thracian lands.

[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|mountain peak]] of [[North America]].  Denali is the third-most [[Topographic prominence|topographically prominent]] and third-most [[Topographic isolation|topographically isolated]] [[summit]] on Earth after [[Mount Everest]] and [[Aconcagua]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the '''200 [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|mountain peaks]] of [[North America|greater North America]]&lt;ref name=NA&gt;This article defines [[North America|greater North America]] as the portion of the [[Continent|continental landmass]] of the [[Americas]] extending westward and northward from the [[Isthmus of Panama]] plus the [[Island|ocean islands]] surrounding that landmass.  This article defines the ocean islands of greater North America to include the [[Island#Continental islands|coastal islands]] of [[Geography of North America|North America]], the [[Caribbean|islands of the Caribbean Sea]], the [[Lucayan Archipelago]], the [[List of islands of Greenland|islands of Greenland]] ([[Greenland|Kalaallit Nunaat]]), the [[List of islands of Canada|islands of Canada]], and the [[List of islands of Alaska|islands of Alaska]].  The [[Hawaiian Islands]] are not included because they are considered part of [[Oceania]].&lt;/ref&gt; with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]]'''.&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In greater North America, only [[Denali]] exceeds {{convert|6000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation.  Three major summits exceed {{convert|5500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, [[List of the major 5000-meter summits of North America|11 exceed {{convert|5000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}]], 21 exceed {{convert|4500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, [[List of the major 4000-meter summits of North America|124 exceed {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}]], 277 exceed {{convert|3500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, and [[List of the major 3000-meter summits of North America|401 exceed 3000 meters' (9843 feet) elevation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1462">'''''Merindad''''' ({{IPA-es|meɾinˈdað}}) is a [[Mediaeval]] [[Spanish language|Spanish]] administrative term for a [[country subdivision]] smaller than a [[province]] but larger than a [[municipality]].  The officer in charge of a merindad was called a '''merino''', roughly equivalent to the [[English language|English]] ''[[county|count]]'' or ''[[bailiff]]''.

It was used in the [[kingdom of Castile|kingdoms of Castile]] and [[kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]].
Connected to the birth of Castile, the [[Merindades]], standing for a northernmost ''[[comarca]]'' of the province of Burgos, was part of the creation of the administrative division by [[Peter of Castile|King Peter]].

Currently, the Foral Community of [[Navarre]] is still divided into five ''merindades'' standing for different judicial districts. The historic ''Merindad de Ultrapuertos'' lying to the north of the Pyrenees is nowadays [[Lower Navarre]]. 

Administratively, they have been substituted by the ''[[partido judicial]]''.
In [[Biscay]], the ''mancomunidades comarcales'' keep the place of the old ''merindades'', such as [[Duranguesado]].

The name of the [[Franks]] (Latin ''Franci'') and the derived names of ''[[Francia]]'' and ''[[Franconia]]'' (and the adjectives ''Frankish'' and ''Franconian'') are derived from the name given to a [[Germanic tribal confederation]] which emerged in the 3rd century.

The [[Frankish Empire]] rose to the main successor of Roman imperial power in Western Europe, and as a result, the Franks ultimately gave their name to both the [[kingdom of France]], and to [[Duchy of Franconia|Franconia]], one of the [[stem duchy|stem duchies]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

==Etymology==
It is traditionally assumed that Frank comes from the Germanic word for "[[Migration period spear|javelin]]" (such as in [[Old English]] ''franca'' or [[Old Norse]] ''frakka'', Latinized  ''[[francisca]]'' "throwing axe").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=frank Online Etymology Dictionary entries for "frank"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Words in other Germanic languages meaning "bold" or "fierce" ([[Middle Dutch]] ''vrac'', Old English ''frǣc'' and [[Old Norwegian]] ''frakkr''), may also be significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Alexander Callander | last=Murray | title=From Roman to Merovingian Gaul: A Reader | year=2000 | location=Peterborough | publisher=Broadview Press Ltd | page=1 | quote=The etymology of 'Franci' is uncertain ('the fierce ones' is the favourite explanation), but the name is undoubtedly of Germanic origin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Eumenius]] addressed the Franks in the matter of the execution of Frankish prisoners in the circus at [[Trier]] by [[Constantine I]] in 306 and certain other measures:&lt;ref&gt;Panegyric on Constantine, xi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howorth|1884|p=217}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ubi nunc est illa ferocia? Ubi semper infida mobilitas?'' ("Where now is that famed ferocity of yours, that ever untrustworthy fickleness?"). 
''Feroces'' was used often to describe the Franks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1857|p=43}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary definitions of Frankish ethnicity vary both by period and point of view.

In a tradition going back to the 7th-century [[Chronicle of Fredegar]], the name of the Franks is taken from ''Francio'', one of the Germanic kings of [[Sicambri]], c. 61 BCE, whose dominion extended all along those lands immediately joining the west-bank of the [[Rhine River]], as far as [[Strasbourg]] and Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Gans|David Solomon Ganz]], ''Tzemach David'', part 2, Warsaw 1859, p. 9b (Hebrew); Polish name of book: ''Cemach Dawid''; cf. J.M. Wallace-Hadrill, ''Fredegar and the History of France'', University of Manchester, n.d. pp. 536–538&lt;/ref&gt; This nation is also explicitly mentioned by [[Julius Caesar]] in his ''Notebooks on the [[Gallic War]]'' (''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'').

Writing in 2009, Professor [[Christopher Wickham]] pointed out that "the word 'Frankish' quickly ceased to have an exclusive ethnic connotation. North of the [[Loire (river)|Loire]] everyone seems to have been considered a Frank by the mid-seventh century at the latest; Romani were essentially the inhabitants of [[Gallia Aquitania|Aquitaine]] after that".&lt;ref name=wick123&gt;{{cite book | title=The Inheritance of Rome: Illuminating the Dark Ages 400-1000 | series=Penguin History of Europe, 2 | first=Chris | last=Wickham | location=New York | publisher=Penguin Books | year=2010 | origyear=2009 | isbn=978-0-670-02098-0 | page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, a [[Formulary (model documents)|formulary]] written by [[Marculf]] about AD 700 described a continuation of national identities within a mixed population when it stated that "all the peoples who dwell [in the official's province], Franks, Romans, Burgundians, and those of other nations, live&amp;nbsp;... according to their law and their custom."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|James|1988|p=187}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adjective ''frank'' "free"==
{{wiktionary|frank}}

The Middle English adjective ''frank," "free, liberal, generous," was adopted in c. 1300 from Old French ''franc'' "free (not servile)", from [[Medieval Latin]] ''francus'' "free, at liberty", as a noun "a freeman, a Frank".
&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. {{cite encyclopedia | title=frank | encyclopedia=American Heritage Dictionary | ref=harv}} {{cite encyclopedia | title=frank |encyclopedia=Webster's Third New International Dictionary | ref=harv}}; {{harvnb|Perry|1857|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The generalised meaning of "freeman" and adjectival "free" developed because under Frankish rule in Gaul, only Franks were free of taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Private Life: From Pagan Rome to Byzantium|editor=Paul Veyne|publisher=Belknap Press|chapter=The Early Middle Ages in the West|author=Michel Rouche|year=1987|isbn=0-674-39974-9|oclc=59830199|page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gallo-Roman population held a  lower rank in Frankish society. ''[[Salic law]]'' 
was the [[germanic law]] codified in the early 6th century to apply to Franks within the Frankish Empire. The legal system in Francia tried every man according to the law of his own race, the Gallo-Roman subject population fell under separate laws, and yet separate laws concerned the interaction between Franks (freemen) and Gallo-Roman subjects. The most notable of these are the ''Lex Romana Visigothorum'' or  ''[[Breviary of Alaric]]'' (506), the ''Lex Romana Curiensis'' and the ''[[Lex Romana Burgundionum]]''.
This led to obvious complications, as expressed by [[Agobard]] of Lyons, who was pleading for a unified legal system in the Frankish Empire, "Of five men sitting or walking together none will have the same law as his fellow."

The Modern French adjective ''franc'' (feminine ''franche'', adverb ''franchement'') still means "free, tax-exempt" as well as "frank, outspoken".
It is seen in the name of [[Franche-Comté]], the area of the [[Free County of Burgundy]] (982&amp;ndash;1678), so named because its sovereign had the unusual title of  "free count" ({{lang|de|[[Freigraf]]}}, or ''{{lang|fr|franc comte}}'').

''[[Franklin (class)|Franklin]]'' (''fraunclein'') was the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] term for a free landowner not of noble birth, giving rise to the [[Franklin (given name)|given name ''Franklin'']] and eventually the [[Franklin (surname)|surname]].

==Francia (France)==
{{main article|Name of France}}
The name of [[France]] directly continues Latin ''[[Francia]]'', originally applied to the entire Frankish Empire.
Under the reign of the Franks' Kings [[Clovis I]], [[Charles Martel]], [[Pepin the Short]], and [[Charlemagne]], the country was known as [[Kingdom of Franks]] or [[Francia]]. At the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843, the Frankish Empire was divided in three parts : [[West Francia]] (''Francia Occidentalis''), [[Middle Francia]] and [[East Francia]] (''Francia Orientalis'').

The rulers of ''Francia Orientalis'', who soon claimed the imperial title and wanted to reunify the Frankish Empire, dropped the name ''Francia Orientalis'' and called their realm the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (see [[History of Germany]]). The kings of ''Francia Occidentalis'' successfully opposed this claim and managed to preserve ''Francia Occidentalis'' as an independent kingdom, distinct from the Holy Roman Empire. The [[Battle of Bouvines]] in 1214 definitively marked the end of the efforts by the Holy Roman Empire to reunify the old Frankish Empire by conquering France.

Since the name ''Francia Orientalis'' had disappeared, there arose the habit to refer to ''Francia Occidentalis'' as ''Francia'' only, from which the word France is derived. The French state has been in continuous existence since 843 (except for a brief interruption in 885-887), with an unbroken line of heads of states since the first king of ''Francia Occidentalis'' ([[Charles the Bald]]) to the current president of the French Republic. Noticeably, in [[German language|German]], France is still called ''Frankreich'', which literally means "''[[Reich]]'' (empire) of the Franks". In order to distinguish it from the Frankish Empire of [[Charlemagne]], France is called ''Frankreich'', while the Frankish Empire is called ''Frankenreich''.

In most of the [[Germanic languages]], France is known as the historical "Land of the Franks", for example ''Frankreich'' ([[Reich]] of the Franks) in German, ''Frankrijk'' ([[Rijk]] of the Franks) in Dutch, ''Frankrike'' ([[Rike]] of the Franks) in Swedish and Norwegian, ''Frankrig'' in Danish.

In a more restricted meaning, "France" refers specifically to the [[provinces of France|province]] of [[Île-de-France]] (with [[Paris]] at its centre) which historically was the heart of the royal demesne. This meaning is found in some geographic names, such as French Brie (''Brie française'') and [[French Vexin]] (''Vexin français''). French Brie, the area where the famous [[Brie cheese]] is produced, is the part of [[Brie]] that was annexed to the royal demesne, as opposed to Champagne Brie (''Brie champenoise'') which was annexed by [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]]. Likewise, French Vexin was the part of [[Vexin]] inside Île-de-France, as opposed to [[Norman Vexin]] (''Vexin normand'') which was inside [[Normandy]].

This meaning is also found in the name of the [[French language]] (''langue française''), whose literal meaning is "language of Île-de-France". It is not until the 19th and 20th centuries that the language of Île-de-France indeed became the language of the whole country France. In modern French, the French language is called ''le français'', while the old language of Île-de-France is called by the name applied to it according to a 19th-century theory on the origin of the French language - ''le [[francien]]''.

==Franconia==
{{further|Franconia|Rhenish Franconia}}
''Franconia'' became the Latin name of [[East Francia]], derived from the German name ''Franken'' "realm of the Franks",&lt;ref&gt;in origin simply the dative plural of the name of the Franks, following a German model of naming territories also applied to the other stem duchies: [[Bavaria]] (''Bayern''), [[Thuringia]] (''Thüringen''), [[Saxony]] (''Sachsen''), [[Swabia]] (''Schwaben''); see also [[name of Sweden]].&lt;/ref&gt;
''Franconia'' was introduced as a synonym of ''Francia orientalis'' by the 12th century ([[Annalista Saxo]]),&lt;ref&gt;K.H. Ludwig in Kasten (ed.), ''Festschrift Hägermann'', Franz Steiner Verlag, 2006, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=mOD-e8JQT-gC&amp;pg=PA246  p. 246].&lt;/ref&gt;
and came to be used of the [[Duchy of Franconia]] as it stood during the 9th and 10th centuries, divided Franconia during the later medieval period, and the [[Franconian Circle]] of the early modern period.

==Franconian vs. Frankish==
The division made between ''Franconia'' and ''Francia'' for German and French territories of the former Frankish Empire leads to terminological difficulties in English.

English has the two adjectives ''Franconian'' and ''Frankish'' translating what in Dutch and German is expressed by a single adjective (''frankisch'' and ''fränkisch'', respectively).
''Franconian'' translates German ''fränkisch'' when referring to the ''Franconia'' within the Holy Roman Empire from the 10th century onward, while ''Frankish'' tends to refer to the period of the unified Frankish realm, during the 5th to 9th centuries.

But there are exceptions, most notably in the context of linguistics, where the term [[Franconian languages]] translates German '' fränkische Sprachen'', French ''Langues franciques''.
This group of dialects has a complicated history due to the geographical spread of the [[High German consonant shift]] as it developed during the medieval period.
[[Low Franconian]] ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]) remained unaffected by the consonant shift and is technically part of [[Low German]], but classified as a separate language for historical and political reasons,&lt;ref&gt;compare the name "[[Dutch language|Dutch]]", which until the 18th century was used of German in general; see 
{{cite book | title=A new geographical and historical grammar: wherein the geographical part is truly modern; and the present state of the several kingdoms of the world is so interspersed, as to render the study of geography both entertaining and instructive | first=Thomas | last=Salmon | authorlink=Thomas Salmon (historian) | location=Edinburgh | publisher=Sands, Murray, and Cochran, for J. Meuros | year=1767 | edition=new | page=147 }}
"The language of the Germans is High Dutch, of which there are many dialects, so different, that the people of one province scarce understand those of another."&lt;/ref&gt;
while [[Central Franconian dialects|Central]] and [[Rhine Franconian dialects|Rhenish]] and [[High Franconian German|High Franconian]] form a dialect continuum within [[High German]].

Since these dialects are all derived from the early medieval [[Frankish language|language of the Franks]], linguistic terminology in English varies between the names "Frankish" and "Franconian", the Germanic language of Merowingian Francia being variously known as "Old Frankish", "Old Franconian" or simply "Frankish".

===Old Franconian===
The German term ''altfränkisch'' as it was introduced in the mid 19th century did not refer to the early medieval period, but was used as a nostalgic term for "old-timey" Franconia (compare [[Old English]] vs. [[Merry Old England|Olde England]]).
This was rendered into English as "Old Franconian", with 19th-century sources talking about Old Franconian towns, songs, people, etc.
But the same term ''altfränkisch'' came to be used of the Frankish language of the Merovingian period.

Gustave Solling's ''Diutiska'' (1863) used the adjective "Franconian" in reference to the Merowingian period, and "Old Franconian" for the language of the [[Oaths of Strasbourg|Pledge of Charles the Bald]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Diutiska: an historical and critical survey of the literature of Germany, from the earliest period to the death of Göthe | first=Gustav | last=Solling | location=London | publisher=Tübner | year=1863 | pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890 Ernest Adams defined "Old Franconian" as an [[Old High German]] dialect spoken on the middle and upper Rhine;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The elements of the English language | first=Ernest | last=Adams | location=London | publisher=George Bell and Sons | year=1890 | page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., it went beyond the limits of Franconia to comprise also the dialect continuum of the Rhineland.

In 1862 [[Max Müller]] pointed out that [[Jacob Grimm]] had applied the concept of "German" grammar to ten languages, which "all appear to have once been one and the same."
One of these was the "Netherland Language, which appears to have been produced by the combined action of the older Franconian and Saxon, and stands therefore in close relation to the Low German and the Friesian. Its descendants now are the Flemish in Belgium and Dutch in Holland." Müller, after describing Grimm's innovation of the old, middle and new phases of High German, contradicts himself by reiterating that Franconian was a dialect of the upper Rhine.&lt;ref name=MM18-20&gt;{{cite journal | first=Robert | last=Vaughan | first2=Henry | last2=Allon | title=The Science of Language | journal=British Quarterly Review | volume=36 | number=71 | date=July 1, 1862 | pages=218–220}} In this review Vaughan and Allon are paraphrasing from Max Müller's ''Science of Language'' lecture series, German language, later translated and published in English.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low Franconian vs. Dutch===
{{further|Names for the Dutch language}}
{{split section|Names for the Dutch language|Low Franconian languages|date=June 2015}}
The overlapping concepts of "Franconian" and the division of German into [[High German]] and [[Low German]] dialects by the 1880s gave rise to the term "Low Franconian" for the 
"Franconian" dialects that fall into the Low German category.
Strong and Meyer (1886) defined Low Franconian as the language "spoken on the lower Rhine."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Herbert Augustus | last=Strong | first2=Kuno | last2=Meyer | title=Outline of a history of the German language | location=London | publisher=Swan Sonnenschein, Le Bas &amp; Lowrey | year=1886 | page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their presentation included an Upper, Middle and Lower Franconian, essentially the modern scheme.

According to  Strong and Meyer, "Franconian ceases to be applied to this language; it is then called Netherlandish (Dutch)…." Only the English ever applied Franconian anywhere; moreover, Netherlandish had been in use since the 17th century, after which Dutch was an entirely English word. The error had been corrected by the time of Wright's ''Old High German Primer'' two years later, in 1888. Wright identifies Old Low Franconian with Old Dutch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Wright | first=Joseph | year=1888 | title=An Old High-German primer | location=Oxford | publisher=Clarendon Press | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; both terms used only in English.

[[Jan van Vliet|Van Vliet]] and his 17th century contemporaries inherited the name and the concept "Teutonic". ''Teutones'' and ''Teutoni'' are names from [[classical Latin]] referring to the entire population of Germanics in the Proto-Germanic era, although there were tribes specifically called [[Teutons]]. Between "Old Dutch" (meaning the earliest Dutch language) and "Old Teutonic", Van Vliet inserted "Frankish", the language of the Old Franks. He was unintentionally ambiguous about who these "Old Franks" were linguistically. At one point in his writing they were referred to as "Old High German" speakers, at another, "Old Dutch" speakers, and at another "Old French" speakers. Moreover, he hypothesized at one point that Frankish was a reflection of [[Gothic language|Gothic]]. The language of the literary fragments available to him was not clearly identified. Van Vliet was searching for a group he thought of as the "Old Franks", which to him included everyone from Mainz to the mouth of the Rhine.

By the end of the 17th century the concept of Old Frankish, the ancestor language of Dutch, German, and the Frankish words in Old French had been firmly established. After the death of [[Franciscus Junius (the younger)|Junius]], a contemporary of Van Vliet, [[Johann Georg Graevius]] said of him in 1694 that he collected fragments of ''vetere Francica'', "Old Frankish," ''ad illustrandam linguam patriam'', "for the elucidation of the mother tongue."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first=Ph. H. | last=Breuker | contribution=On the Course of Franciscus Junius' Germanic Studies, with Special Reference to Frisian | editor-first=Rolf H. Jr. | editor-last=Bremmer | editor2-first=Geart | editor2-last=Van der Meer | editor3-first=Oebele | editor3-last=Vries | title=Aspects of Old Frisian Philology | series=Amsterdam Beiträge zur ãlteren Germanistik Bd. 31/32; Estrikken 69 | location=Amsterdam | publisher=Rodopi | year=2007 | page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the Dutch ''vetere Francica'', a language spoken by the Franks mentioned in [[Gregory of Tours]] and of the [[Carolingian Dynasty]], which at one end of its spectrum became Old Dutch, and at the other, Old High German, threw a shadow into neighboring England, even though the word "Franconian", covering the same material, was already firmly in use there. The shadow remains.

The term "Old Frankish" in English is vague and analogous, referring either to language or to other aspects of culture. In the most general sense, "old" means "not the present", and "Frankish" means anything claimed to be related to the Franks from any time period. The term "Old Frankish" has been used of manners, architecture, style, custom, government, writing and other aspects of culture, with little consistency. In a recent history of the Germanic people, Ozment used it to mean the Carolingian and all preceding governments and states calling themselves Franks through the death of the last admittedly Frankish king, [[Conrad I of Germany]], in 919, and his replacement by a Saxon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=A mighty fortress: a new history of the German people | first=Steven | last=Ozment | location=New York | publisher=HarperCollins | year=2005 | page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "Old Frankish" period, then, beginning in the Proto-Germanic period and lasting until the 10th century, is meant to include Old High German, Old Dutch and the language that split to form [[Low German]] and [[High German]].

A second term in use by Van Vliet was ''oud Duijts'', "Old Dutch", where ''Duijts'' meant "the entire Continental Germanic continuum". The terms ''Nederlandsch'' and ''Nederduijts'' were coming into use for contemporary Dutch. Van Vliet used the ''oud Duijts'' ambiguously to mean sometimes ''Francks'', sometimes Old Dutch, and sometimes Middle Dutch, perhaps because the terms were not yet firm in his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dekker|1998|pp=255–256}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Duijts'' had been in general use until about 1580 to refer to the Dutch language, but subsequently was replaced by ''Nederduytsch''.

English linguists lost no time in bringing Van Vliet's ''oud Duijts'' into English as "Old Dutch". The linguistic noun "Old Dutch", however, competed with the adjective "Old Dutch", meaning an earlier writing in the same Dutch, such as an old Dutch rhyme, or an old Dutch proverb. For example, Brandt's "old Dutch proverb", in the English of his translator, John Childe, mentioned in 1721:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Gerard | last=Brandt | first2=John (Translator) | last2=Childe | title=The history of the Reformation and other ecclesiastical transactions in and about the Low-countries: from the beginning of the eighth century, down to the famous Synod of Dort, inclusive.

Wood | volume=Vol II | page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Unity makes strength|Eendracht maekt macht, en twist verquist]]'', "Unity gives strength, and Discord weakness," means contemporary Dutch and not Old Dutch. On the frontispiece, Childe refers to the language in which the book was written as "the original Low Dutch". Linguistic "Old Dutch" had already become "Low Dutch", the contemporary language, and "High Dutch", or [[High German]]. On the other hand, "Old Dutch" was a popular English adjective used in the 18th century with reference to people, places and things.

The '''Namib''' is a [[coastal desert]] in [[southern Africa]]. The name ''Namib'' is of [[nama language|Nama]] origin and means "vast place". According to the broadest definition, the Namib stretches for more than {{convert|2000|km}} along the Atlantic coasts of [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], and [[South Africa]], extending southward from the Carunjamba River in Angola, through Namibia and to the [[Olifants River (Western Cape)|Olifants River]] in Western Cape, South Africa.&lt;ref name="Goudie"&gt;{{cite book|author=Goudie, Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Goudie (geographer) |chapter=Chapter 17: Namib Sand Sea: Large Dunes in an Ancient Desert |editor1-first=Piotr |editor1-last=Migoń|editor-link=Piotr Migoń|title=Geomorphological Landscapes of the World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TI55urJYyEC&amp;lpg=PR2&amp;dq=Geomorphological%20Landscapes%20of%20the%20World&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2010 |publisher=Springer |location=New York, NY |pages=163–169 |isbn=978-90-481-3054-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gates-Appiah"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Africa |editor1-first=Henry Louis |editor1-last=Gates |editor1-link=Kwame Anthony Appiah |editor2-first=Kwame Anthony|editor2-last=Appiah |editor2-link=Kwame Anthony Appiah |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-533770-9 |page=213 |volume=2 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Namib's northernmost portion, which extends {{convert|450|km}} from the Angola-Namibia border, is known as [[Moçâmedes Desert]], while its southern portion approaches the neighboring [[Kalahari Desert]].

The desert geology consists of [[sand sea]]s near the coast, while gravel plains and scattered mountain outcrops occur further inland.

The Namib Desert is one of the 500 distinct [[Physical Geography|physiographic]] provinces of the South African [[Platform (geology)|Platform]] physiographic division. It occupies an area of around 80,950&amp;nbsp;km²&lt;ref&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=at1315|name=Namib desert}}&lt;/ref&gt; (31,200&amp;nbsp;square miles), stretching from the [[Usiab River]] (north) to the town of [[Lüderitz]] (south) and from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] (west) to the Namib Escarpment (east). It is about {{convert|1,000|mi|km}} long from north to south and its east-west width varies from {{convert|30|to|100|mi|km|abbr=off}}. To the north, the desert leads into the [[Kaokoveld]]; the dividing line between these two regions is roughly at the [[latitude]] of the city of [[Walvis Bay]], and it consists in a narrow strip of land (about 50&amp;nbsp;km wide) that is the driest place in Southern Africa. To the south, the Namib borders on the [[South Africa]]n [[Karoo]] semi-desert.

Southern Namib (between Lüderitz and the [[Kuiseb]] River) comprises a vast dune sea with some of the tallest and most spectacular dunes of the world, ranging in color from pink to vivid orange. In the Sossusvlei area, several dunes exceed {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in height. The complexity and regularity of dune patterns in its [[dune sea]] have attracted the attention of [[geologist]]s for decades, but it remains poorly understood.

Moving north from Sossusvlei, the sand gradually gives way to a rocky desert that extends all the way from Sossusvlei to the [[Swakop]] river. This area is traversed by the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] and is mostly flat, although some scenic canyons and elevations are found in some areas, for example in the Moon Valley system. While most of the soil is rocky, sand dunes are still occasionally found in this region; for example, sand dunes occupy much of the coastline between Walvis Bay and Swakopmund.

The Namib desert is an important location for the mining of [[tungsten]], [[salt]] and [[diamond]]s.

Several rivers and streams run through the Namib, although all of the rivers south of the [[Cunene River]] and north of the [[Orange River]] are [[ephemeral]] and rarely or never reach the ocean.&lt;ref name="Goudie" /&gt; These rivers arise in the interior mountains of Namibia and flow after summer rain storms.&lt;ref name="Goudie" /&gt;

== Climate ==

The Namib's aridity is caused by the descent of dry air of the [[Hadley Cell]], cooled by the cold [[Benguela current]] along the coast. It has less than {{convert|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} of rain annually and is almost completely barren. Besides rain being scarce, it is also hardly predictable. The western Namib gets less rain (5&amp;nbsp;mm) than the eastern Namib (85&amp;nbsp;mm). This is due to several factors. Winds coming from the Indian Ocean lose part of their humidity when passing the [[Drakensberg]] mountains, and are essentially dry when they reach the Namib Escarpment at the eastern end of the desert. Winds coming from the Atlantic Ocean, on the other hand, are pressed down by hot air from the east; their humidity thus forms clouds and fog. Morning fogs coming from the ocean and pushing inwards into the desert are a regular phenomenon along the coast, and much of the life cycle of animals and plants in the Namib relies on these fogs as the main source of water.

The dry climate of the Namib reflects the almost complete lack of bodies of water on the surface. Most rivers flow underground and/or are dry for most of the year, and even when they are not, they usually drain into [[endorheic basin|endorheic]] basins, without reaching the sea. The Swakop and the [[Omaruru River|Omaruru]] are the only rivers that occasionally drain into the ocean.

All along the coast, but mostly in the northernmost part of it, interaction between the water-laden air coming from the sea via southerly [[wind]]s, some of the strongest of any coastal desert, and the dry air of the desert causes immense [[fog]]s and strong currents. It causes sailors to lose their way; this is testified by the remnants of a number of [[shipwreck]]s that can be found along the [[Skeleton Coast]], in northern Namib. Some of these wrecked ships can be found as much as {{convert|50|m|yd|abbr=off}} inland, as the desert slowly moves westwards into the sea, reclaiming land over a period of many years.
Benguela's El Niño (similar to the Pacific event in its environmental change in the seas) spreads from the Kunene estuary southward to, on occasion, south of Luderitz. Warm waters with depth and associated water flows from the northwest were first fully catalogued by Sea Fisheries researchers, Cape Town (L V Shannon ''et al.''). The research noted the positive effect of Benguela's El Niño on the rainfall of the interior. Rainfall records also show positive values variously across the Namib, Desert Research Station, Gobabeb for instance. This event recurs approximately mid-decade (1974, 1986, 1994, 1995 and 2006 are recent examples)

== Animals and plants ==
A number of unusual [[species]] of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s are found in this desert, many of which are [[endemism|endemic]] and highly adapted to the specific climate of the area. One of the most well-known endemic plants of the Namib is the bizarre ''[[Welwitschia]] mirabilis''; a shrub-like plant, it grows two long strap-shaped leaves continuously throughout its lifetime. These leaves may be several meters long, gnarled and twisted from the desert winds. The [[taproot]] of the plant develops into a flat, concave disc in age.  ''Welwitschia'' is notable for its survival in the extremely arid conditions in the Namib, mostly deriving moisture from the coastal sea fogs. An area where ''Welwitschias'' are a common sight is found in the surroundings of the Moon Valley, including the eponymous Welwitschia Plains.

The Namib fauna mostly comprises [[arthropod]]s and other small animals that can live on little water, but a few species of bigger animals are also found, including [[antelope]]s (such as [[oryx]]es and [[springbok]]s), [[ostrich]]es, and in some areas even [[desert elephant]]s. All these species have developed techniques to survive in the Namib environment. A number of endemic [[darkling beetle]]s [[species]] — such as the [[Namib Desert beetle]] — have bumpy [[elytron]]s with a pattern of hydrophilic bumps and hydrophobic troughs. These cause humidity from the morning fogs to condense into droplets, which roll down the beetle's back to its mouth; they are collectively known as "fog beetles". Another beetle, the ''Lepidochora discoidalis'', builds "water-capturing" webs. [[Black-backed jackal]]s lick humidity from stones. [[Gemsbok]]s (also known as Oryxes) can raise the temperature of their bodies to 40&amp;nbsp;°C in the hottest hours of the day. The desert is also home to [[meerkats]] and several species of lizards.

== Human activity ==
[[File:Sperrgebiet-001.jpg|thumb|A warning sign in the [[Sperrgebiet]] from the government of [[South West Africa]], picture taken in 1947]]
Before the 20th century, some [[San people|San]] roamed the Namib, gathering edible plants on the shore, hunting in the interior, and drinking the juice of the [[Citrullus lanatus|tsama melon]] for water. Nowadays, some [[Herero people|Herero]] still herd their livestock in the [[Kaokoveld]] in the Namib and take them from waterhole to waterhole. A few [[Nama people|Nama]] [[Khoikhoi]] still graze their livestock on the banks of the [[Kuiseb River]] in the desert. Most of the native people have left, however, leaving the vast majority of the desert uninhabited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Namib|title=Namib {{!}} desert, Africa|last=Logan|first=Richard F.|date=|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-07-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The steppes in the southern half of the desert are mostly made up of ranches run by Europeans, who raise [[Karakul sheep]] with local help and send the wool of the lambs to Europe for use in fur coats. Most of the rest of the desert is set aside for conservation. A vast portion of the desert, called the [[Sperrgebiet]], was access-restricted due to the presence of diamonds, which are mined in the area at the mouth of the [[Orange River]]. Although the desert is largely unpopulated and inaccessible, there are year-round settlements at [[Sesriem]], close to the famous [[Sossusvlei]] area, and other small outposts in other locations. [[Moçâmedes]] in Angola, and [[Lüderitz]], [[Walvis Bay]] and [[Swakopmund]] in Namibia, bordering on the desert, are the main settlements in the area.

== Namib-Naukluft National Park ==
{{Main|Namib-Naukluft National Park}}
The Namib-Naukluft National Park, that extends over a large part of the Namib Desert, is the largest game reserve in [[Africa]] and one of the largest of the world. While most of the park is hardly accessible, several well-known [[visitor attraction]]s are found in the desert. The prominent attraction is the famous [[Sossusvlei]] area, where high orange sand dunes surround vivid white salt pans, creating a fascinating landscape.

Access to the park is either by [[gravel road]]s or dust roads (except for 60&amp;nbsp;km of [[asphalt concrete|concrete road]] from the [[Sesriem]] gate to Sossusvlei) or by light aircraft from [[Windhoek]] (the capital of Namibia, about {{convert|480|km|mi|abbr=on}} north-east of the centre of the desert), or [[Swakopmund]] and [[Walvis Bay]] at the north end of the desert.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7254">'''Oliver Edwin Baker''' (September 10, 1883 &amp;ndash; December 2, 1949) was an American [[Economic geography|economic geographer]].  

==Education and early career==
Baker was born in [[Tiffin, Ohio]].  His father, Edwin Baker, was a merchant, and his mother, Martha Ranney Thomas, had been a schoolteacher.  His health in his early life was so poor that he did not begin school until the age of 12, before which time he was taught by his mother.&lt;ref name=anb&gt;{{cite book | year = 2004 | title = American National Biography | publisher = Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After graduating public school he went on to [[Heidelberg College]].  He graduated with a B.S. degree in history and mathematics at the age of 19 in 1903, and took an M.S. degree in philosophy and sociology a year later.  The next year he went on to [[Columbia University]], receiving an M.A. in political science in 1905.  He studied forestry at [[Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies|Yale University School of Forestry]] from 1907 to 1908, and later did graduate work at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in agriculture.  From 1908 to 1912 he worked with the University of Wisconsin–Madison's Agricultural Experiment Station. Baker co-authored a bulletin for the Experiment Station, which studied the climate of Wisconsin and its effects on agriculture, published in 1912.  From 1910 to 1912 he also worked with the Wisconsin Soil Survey during the summers.&lt;ref name=ag&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Stephen Sargent Visher|Visher, S. S.]] |author2=Hu, Charles Y. |date=December 1950 | title = Oliver Edwin Baker, 1883-1949 | journal = Annals of the Association of American Geographers | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 328–34 | doi = 10.1080/00045605009352033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912 he took a job with the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], where he would stay for the next thirty years.  Baker's work was noticed rather quickly, in part because of his contributions to the ''Yearbooks'' from 1915 to 1938, several of which he edited.  For the first eighteen years at the USDA he was devoted to studying the geographical aspects of land use.  One of his first works, co-authoring ''Geography of the World's Agriculture'' (1917) with [[Vernor Clifford Finch]], led him to even wider recognition.  Shortly after its publication, Baker returned to the University of Wisconsin–Madison for further graduate study, in economics, and earned his Ph.D. in 1921 with a dissertation on land utilization.  While there, Baker had been influenced by [[Henry Charles Taylor]] and [[Richard T. Ely]], two notable economists, to shift his work more toward the economic aspect of geography and agriculture.  In 1922 he joined the USDA's new Bureau of Agricultural Economics, headed by Henry C. Taylor.&lt;ref name=anb/&gt;  With the success of the ''Geography of the World's Agriculture'', he instigated work on the ''Atlas of American Agriculture'', on which he himself was planner and editor.  The massive work was released in six parts between 1918 and 1936.&lt;ref name=ag/&gt;

Baker acted as a part-time professor at [[Clark University]] from 1923 to 1927, and later gave several series of lectures at other universities.  With the appearance of the journal ''[[Economic Geography (journal)|Economic Geography]]'', Baker became associate editor, and later a contributor of a notable series of articles on regional agricultural geography of North America.  His interest in farm populations started around 1920, however it was during the 1930s that this field became a major focus of the USDA.  Baker was particularly interested in the migration of rural youths into urban areas.  Even into his later years, populations problems occupied much of his research and energies.  Baker recognized that only a minority of the world's population lived under decent living conditions.  He turned his attention to improving standards for American farmers.  He hoped to achieve this by raising the level of appreciation for farmers and their contributions within the United States, and studying recent trends to aid in planning and forecasting potential problems.  He also tried to encourage Americans to have larger families in order to ensure successful future generations in the country.&lt;ref name=ag/&gt;

Baker had been critical of many aspects of urban life, and collaborated with [[Ralph Borsodi]] on ''Agriculture in Modern Life'' (1939), advocating a return to rural living.  He himself however suggested more of a "rurban" lifestyle, which combined aspects of both urban and rural life.  He married in 1925 to Alice Hargrave Crew.  They had four children together- Helen, Sabra, Edwin, and Mildred- and raised them in then-suburban College Park, Maryland with five acres where they were able to raise chicken and cows and have a garden.  He later bought a large farm near New Market, Virginia where he could take up his interest in soil conservation.&lt;ref name=anb/&gt;

In 1931 he was elected president of the [[Association of American Geographers]], and received honorary doctorates from Heidelberg College in Ohio and the [[Georg-August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = [[Irene Barnes Taeuber|Taeuber, Irene B]] |date=January 1950 | title = Oliver Edwin Baker (1883-1949) | journal = Population Index | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career at College Park, Maryland==
Baker left Washington D.C. for the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] in 1942, accepting an invitation to establish a Department of Geography there.  Baker assembled the Department's faculty himself and attracted many students, as well as promoted many research projects.  He retired from his position in July 1949 in order to devote himself to completing his various research projects.  His main work at the time was the ''Atlas of World Resources'', which was being created by the USDA and the [[United States Bureau of Mines|Bureau of Mines]],&lt;ref name=geo&gt;{{cite journal | author = Unknown author |date=April 1950 | title = Obituary: Oliver Edwin Baker | journal = Geographical Review | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 333–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also initiated the ''China Atlas'', continuing a long interest of his in China.  However, neither of these works were completed by the time of his death.  Baker had always been highly dedicated to teaching and gave his time generously to students and visitors.&lt;ref name=ag/&gt;

Having suffered from health problems his entire life,&lt;ref name=anb/&gt; he died in his home in [[College Park, Maryland]].&lt;ref name=geo/&gt;

[[File:palsaaerialview.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A group of well developed palsas as seen from above]]
A '''palsa''' is a low, often oval, [[frost heaving|frost heave]] occurring in [[polar climate|polar]] and [[subpolar climate]]s, which contain [[permafrost|permanently frozen]] [[Ice Lens|ice lenses]]. Like [[pingo]]s, palsas consist of an ice core with overlying soil, but they are generally smaller than pingos, often occur in groups and may develop from ground water without additional hydrostatic pressure. Palsas are characteristically found in areas with [[discontinuous permafrost]], and in such areas they may be the only reliable surface evidence of permafrost.  Surface water, found in [[bog]]s, enhances palsa formation in areas called [[palsa bog]]s.

==Genesis==
Palsas may be initiated in areas of a moor or bog where the winter freezing front penetrates relatively faster than surrounding areas, perhaps due to an unusually thin cover of [[snow]].  The lack of thermal insulation provided by thick snow permits much deeper freezing in winter.  This ice may then last through the summer with a persistent 'bump' of up to several cm due to frost heave.  The elevated surface of a palsa will tend also to have thinner snow cover, allowing greater winter cooling, while in summer the surface material (especially if organic) will dry out and provide thermal insulation.  Thus the interior temperature is consistently lower than that of adjacent ground.  This contributes to the formation of an ice lens which grows by drawing up surrounding water.  The expansion of the ice upon freezing exerts pressure on the surrounding soil, further forcing water out of its pore spaces which then accumulates on and increases the volume of the growing ice lens.  A [[positive feedback]] loop develops.  Changes in surface moisture and vegetation will then be such as to preserve the newly formed permafrost. 

The overlying soil layer is gradually lifted up by [[frost heaving]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In cross-section, the ice cores of a palsa show layering, which is caused by the successive winter freezing intervals. The pressing out of water from the pores is not crucial, however, since the boggy soil is water-saturated and thus always provides enough water for ice core growth.

Palsas appear to go through a developmental cycle that eventually leads to thawing and collapse. Open cracks that commonly accompany palsa growth and the water that tends to accumulate around palsas, probably as a result of their weight depressing the adjacent bog surface, are important factors in this process.   The fact that palsas in various stages of growth and decay occur together shows that their collapse is not necessarily indicative of climatic change. All that is usually left after a palsa collapses is a depression surrounded by a rim.

==Morphology==
[[File:storflaket.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Storflaket]] [[peat bog]] near [[Abisko]] in northern [[Sweden]] is a permafrost plateau. It shows some signs of collapse such as cracks at its borders]]
Palsa forms include mounds, moderately straight ridges, and winding ridges. Palsas in Iceland have been described as hump shaped, dike shaped, plateau shaped, ring shaped, and shield shaped, those in Norway as palsa plateaus, esker palsas, string palsas, conical or dome-shaped palsas, and palsa complexes.  

Widths are commonly 10–30 m, and lengths 15–150 m.  However, lengths of up to 500 m have been reported for esker-like palsa ridges running parallel to the gradient of a [[bog]]. Heights range from less than 1 m to about 10 m at a maximum above the surrounding area.  Large forms tend to be considerably less conical than small ones.  In places, palsas combine to form complexes several hundred meters in extent.  The permafrost core contains ice lenses no thicker than 2–3&amp;nbsp;cm, though locally lenses up to almost 40&amp;nbsp;cm thick have been described.  

Palsas form in groups or "fields" and the individual palsa can show its age difference from the others.

Palsa surfaces are frequently traversed by open cracks, caused by doming (dilation cracking), frost cracking, or desiccation.  The vegetation of a palsa may comprise low shrubs and lichen in addition to the sedges characterizing the peat. Also, the higher a palsa grows the dryer the peat covering the palsa becomes leading to more insulation which protects the inner core from melting.

There are two types of palsas, those with a peat core and those with a core of mineral soil, usually [[silt]].  The [[peat]]-core type is the most common, the other being regarded as exceptional by some, but more common than formerly thought.

===Permafrost plateau===
Permafrost plateaus are structures of coalesced palsas that form a continuous elevated flatland area usually in a [[peat bog]]. Permafrost plateaus may have parts suffering decay while others are growing at the same time. Permafrost plateaus are usually surrounded by wetlands but have often internal water pools during summer due to uneven relief, partial decay and thaw.

==Geographic distribution==
[[File:zoneofpalsas.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Anders Rapp]]'s map of the limit of palsas and discontinuous permafrost in [[Fennoscandia]].]] 
Palsas are typical forms of the [[permafrost|discontinuous permafrost zone]] regions and are therefore found in [[Subarctic]] regions of northern [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]], [[Siberia]], northern [[Fennoscandia]] and [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are almost exclusively associated with bogs and commonly occur in areas where the winters are long and the snow cover tends to be thin. In some places palsas extend into underlying permafrost; in others they rest on an unfrozen substratum.  

In the southern hemisphere palsa remains from the [[last glacial maximum]] have been identified on the Argentine side of [[Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego]] just north of [[Cami Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq1W6eoUa_cC&amp;pg=PA256&amp;lpg=PA256&amp;dq=palsa+patagonia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FC9h9sklVY&amp;sig=cza4Waukm0rqC_BtWHag-5JbReY&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=Law4SoigPI_Q-Qacq5SWAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5 The Late Cenozoic of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego], retrieved 17 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Remainders of [[Ice-Age]] palsas are to be found also in [[Hochmooren]] of Central Europe, such as [[High Venn|Hohen Venn]] in the German-Belgian border area.

==Differences and commonalities between pingos and palsas==
Palsas are structurally similar to [[pingo]]s, however with heights between approx. 0.5 and 2&amp;nbsp;m and lengths between approx. 5 and 25&amp;nbsp;m, palsas are significantly smaller than pingos. Both however are considered to be true perennial permafrost mounds since both occur in areas of continuous permafrost.  Moreover, contrary to pingos which are usually isolated, palsas usually arise in groups with other palsas, such as in a so-called [[palsa bog]]. Unlike pingos, palsas do not require surrounding permafrost to grow, seeing as palsa are permafrost. Pingos also grow below the active layer, which is the depth that the annual freeze-thaw cycle occurs, and palsa grow in the active layer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Both palsas and pingos result from freezing of water to an ice core. Palsas, however, do not necessarily require positive hydrostatic pressure (to inject water), since the boggy soil is water-saturated and therefore has sufficient supply for the growing ice core.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Terminology and synonyms==

Palsa (plural: palsas) is a term from the [[Finnish language]] meaning "a hummock rising out of a bog with a core of ice," which in turn is a borrowing from [[Northern Sami]], ''balsa''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/palsa dictionary.com definition of palsa]&lt;/ref&gt; As palsas particularly develop in [[moorland]]s they are therefore also named ''palsamoors''. ''Bugor'' and ''bulginniakhs'' are general terms in the [[Russian language]] (the latter of [[Sakha language|Yakutian]] origin) for both palsas and pingos.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12555">'''Quantitative storytelling''' ('''QST''') is a systematic approach to explore the multiplicity of frames potentially legitimate in a scientific study or controversy.&lt;ref name="QST1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.futures.2016.11.012 |title=What is wrong with evidence based policy, and how can it be improved? |journal=Futures |volume=91 |pages=62–71 |year=2017 |last1=Saltelli |first1=Andrea |last2=Giampietro |first2=Mario }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giampietro2014"&gt;[Giampietro, M., Aspinall, R. J., Ramos-Martin, J. and Bukkens, S. G. F. (2014) Resource Accounting for Sustainability Assessment: The Nexus between Energy, Food, Water and Land Use. Taylor &amp; Francis (Routledge Explorations in Sustainability and Governance).](https://books.google.es/books?id=Vb6uAwAAQBAJ)&lt;/ref&gt; QST assumes that in an interconnected society more frameworks and worldviews are legitimately upheld by different constituencies and social actors. QST looks critically to models used in evidence-based policy (EBP). These are often in the form of risk analyses or cost benefit analyses, and necessarily focus on a single framing of the issue under consideration. QST suggest corrective approaches to this practice.  

==Context==
Quantitative storytelling (QST) addresses evidence based policy and can be considered as a reaction to a style of quantification based on cost benefir or risk analysis which - in the opinion of QST proponents - may contain important implicit normative assumptions.&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt;

In the logic of QST, a single quantification corresponding to a single view of what the problem is runs the risk of distracting from what could be alternative readings.&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt;

Alternative frames (Ravetz, 1987&lt;ref name="Ravetz1997"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1177/107554708700900104 |title=Usable Knowledge, Usable Ignorance |journal=Knowledge |volume=9 |pages=87–116 |year=2016 |last1=Ravetz |first1=Jerome R }}&lt;/ref&gt; ; Rayner, 2012&lt;ref name="Rayner2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/03085147.2011.637335 |title=Uncomfortable knowledge: The social construction of ignorance in science and environmental policy discourses |journal=Economy and Society |volume=41 |pages=107–25 |year=2012 |last1=Rayner |first1=Steve }}&lt;/ref&gt;) may represent ‘uncomfortable knowledge’, which is removed from the policy discourse. Thus, extensive mathematical modelling in EBP to support a given policy may lead to a simplification of the available perceptions and generate - rather than resolve – controversies. The word ‘hypo-cognition’ has been used in the context of these instrumental use of frames (Lakoff et al., 2008&lt;ref name="Lakoff2008"&gt;[Lakoff, G., Dean, H. and Hazen, D. (2008) Don’t Think of an Elephant!: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate. Chelsea Green Publishing.](https://books.google.es/books?id=zbJ1oxHC9a0C)
&lt;/ref&gt;; Lakoff, 2010&lt;ref name="Lakoff2010"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/17524030903529749 |title=Why it Matters How We Frame the Environment |journal=Environmental Communication |volume=4 |pages=70–81 |year=2010 |last1=Lakoff |first1=George }}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

Under this critical viewpoint, mathematical models can be seen as a tool for ‘displacement’. Displacement occurs where a model becomes the end instead of the tool, e.g. when an institution chooses to monitor and manage the outcome of a model rather than what happens in reality&lt;ref name="Rayner2012" /&gt;. Once exposed, the strategic use of hypo-cognition erodes the trust in the involved actors and institutions.&lt;ref name="Rayner2012" /&gt;

==Approach==
QST suggests acknowledging ignorance, as to work out ‘clumsy solutions’ (Rayner, 2012&lt;ref name="Rayner2012" /&gt;), which may accommodate unshared epistemological or ethical principles. This is in turn close to the [[Post-normal science|PNS]] suggested style of inquiry known as ‘working deliberatively within imperfections’ (van der Sluijs and Petersen, 2008&lt;ref name="Sluijs2012"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/3/2/024008 |title=Exploring the quality of evidence for complex and contested policy decisions |journal=Environmental Research Letters |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=024008 |year=2008 |last1=Van Der Sluijs |first1=Jeroen P |last2=Petersen |first2=Arthur C |last3=Janssen |first3=Peter H M |last4=Risbey |first4=James S |last5=Ravetz |first5=Jerome R }}&lt;/ref&gt;), and to the exigence for a ‘rediscovery of ignorance’ (see preface to Pereira and Funtowicz, 2015&lt;ref name="Pereira2012"&gt;[Pereira, A. G. and Funtowicz, S. (2015) Science, Philosophy and Sustainability : the End of the Cartesian dream.{{pn|date=April 2018}}](https://www.crcpress.com/Science-Philosophy-and-Sustainability-The-End-of-the-Cartesian-dream/Pereira-Funtowicz/p/book/9781138796409)&lt;/ref&gt;).
QST also calls attention to the power relationships at play in the use of evidence. Saltelli and Giampietro (2017)&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt; suggest that our present approach to evidence-based policy, even in the more nuanced formulation of evidence-informed policy (Gluckman, 2014&lt;ref name="Gluckman2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/507163a |pmid=24627919 |title=Policy: The art of science advice to government |journal=Nature |volume=507 |issue=7491 |pages=163–5 |year=2014 |last1=Gluckman |first1=Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt;)– needs our urgent attention. Unavoidable asymmetries are generated by the fact that stronger players have access to better evidence, and can use it strategically (Boden and Epstein, 2006&lt;ref name="Boden2006"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/14767720600752619 |title=Managing the research imagination? Globalisation and research in higher education |journal=Globalisation, Societies and Education |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=223–36 |year=2006 |last1=Boden |first1=Rebecca |last2=Epstein |first2=Debbie }}&lt;/ref&gt;; Strassheim and Kettunen, 2014&lt;ref name="Strassheim2014"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1332/174426514X13990433991320 |title=When does evidence-based policy turn into policy-based evidence? Configurations, contexts and mechanisms |journal=Evidence &amp; Policy: A Journal of Research, Debate and Practice |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=259–77 |year=2014 |last1=Strassheim |first1=Holger |last2=Kettunen |first2=Pekka }}&lt;/ref&gt;).  The decline of pollinators challenge (Insectageddon, Mombiot, 2017&lt;ref name="Monbiot2017"&gt;[Monbiot G., 2017. Insectageddon: farming is more catastrophic than climate breakdown, The Guardian, October 20, 2017]( https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/20/insectageddon-farming-catastrophe-climate-breakdown-insect-populations)&lt;/ref&gt;) show that interest groups have more scope to capture regulators than the average citizen ad consumer.

QST encourages an effort in the pre-analytic, pre-quantitative phase of the analysis to map a socially robust (i.e. inclusive of the interest of different stakeholders) universe of possible frames. QST expands on one of the rules [[sensitivity auditing]] by asking the question of ‘what to do’ in order to avoid that an issue is framed unilaterally. Obviously, the medicine for a diseased evidence-based policy is not a prejudice - or superstition-based policy, but a more democratic and dialogic access to the provision of evidence – even in terms of agenda setting. For this a new institutional setting is needed&lt;ref name="QST1" /&gt;. 

QST does not eschew the use quantitative tools altogether. It suggests instead to explore quantitatively multiple narratives, avoiding spurious accuracy and focusing on some salient features of the selected stories. Rather than attempting to amass evidence in support to a given reading or policy, or to optimise it with modelling, QST operates ‘via negativa’, i.e. it tries to test whether the said framing runs afoul of a quantitative or qualitative analytical check. Here QST borrows from system ecology and attempts to refute the frames if these violate constraints of (Giampietro et al., 2014&lt;ref name="Giampietro2014" /&gt;): 

# feasibility (can we afford a given policy in terms of external constraints, e.g. existing biophysical resources?), 
# viability (can we afford it in the context of our internal constraints, governance, socioeconomic and technological arrangements?), and 
# desirability (will the relevant constituency accept it?).

==Applications==
Perhaps the best application of the concept of QST is an old study of GMO-related perceptions (Marris, 2001&lt;ref name="Marris2001"&gt;[Marris, C. (2001) Final Report of the PABE research project funded by the Commission of European Communities.]( http://csec.lancs.ac.uk/archive/pabe/docs/pabe_finalreport.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;) which has lost very little of its actuality since the ongoing GMO and pesticide debate. 
By direct interview and measurements of stakeholders’ expectation and worldviews, Marris and co-authors showed that the prevailing narrative of the reaction to GMO as a ‘food scare’ – i.e. as an issue of safety to consume GMO food – did not show up among the concerns raised by the interviewed citizens, which worried instead about who would benefit from these technologies, why were they introduced in the first place, and whether existing regulatory authorities would be up to the task of resisting regulatory capture from powerful industrial incumbents.

Other applications of approaches which can be referred to QST are to the analyses for the cost of climate change,&lt;ref name="Saltelli-d’Hombres2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2009.12.003 |title=Sensitivity analysis didn't help.

'''Sepharad''' ({{Lang-he|סְפָרַד}} ''Sp̄āraḏ''; also ''Sefarad'', ''Sephared'', ''Sfard''), is a [[List of biblical names|biblical place name]] of uncertain location. It is mentioned only once in the [[Hebrew Bible|Bible]], in the [[Book of Obadiah]] ({{bibleverse||Obadiah|1:20|HE}}, 6th century BC). There are, however, [[Old Persian]] inscriptions that refer to two places called ''[[Saparda]]'' (alternative reading: ''Sparda''): one area in [[Media (region)|Media]] and another in [[Asia Minor]]. It is speculated that Sepharad could have been [[Sardis]], whose native [[Lydian language|Lydian]] name is ''Sfard'' or ''Sward''.&lt;ref name="DusinberreDusinberre2003"&gt;On the Lydian name for Sardis, see {{cite book|author1=Elspeth R.

Since the period of 2nd century [[Ancient Rome]], [[Spanish Jews]] gave the name "Sepharad" to the [[Iberian peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Remembering Sepharad: Jewish culture in medieval Spain |last=Torviso |first=Isidro Gonzalo Bango |year=2003 |publisher=State Corp. for Spanish Cultural Action Abroad |location=Washington National Cathedral |isbn=978-8496008274 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The descendants of [[Iberian Jews]] refer to themselves as [[Sephardi Jews]] (Hebrew, plural: ''Sephardim'') and identify [[Spain]] as "Sepharad" in [[Israeli Hebrew|modern Hebrew]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31010">The '''Severn Valley''' is the setting of several fictional towns and other locations created by [[horror fiction|horror]] writer [[Ramsey Campbell]]. Part of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]] started by [[H. P. Lovecraft]], the fictional milieu is arguably the most detailed mythos setting outside of [[Lovecraft Country]] itself.

==Real-world location==

The [[River Severn]] is an actual river in Wales and western [[England]]. Campbell's stories mention various real-world locales, including the [[Cotswolds|Cotswold Hills]],&lt;ref&gt;"The Church in High Street"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], and the [[A38 road]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Room in the Castle"&lt;/ref&gt; These references place "Campbell Country" in the southern part of [[Gloucestershire]],  roughly between the cities of [[Gloucester]] and [[Bristol]]. This area is more correctly referred to as the [[Vale of Berkeley]] or the [[Severn Estuary]]; the real-world [[Severn Valley (England)|Severn Valley]] refers to an area around fifty miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) further north.

==Ramsey Campbell==

Campbell invented his locales, when, as a 15-year-old Lovecraft fan, he submitted Lovecraftian pastiches, set in Lovecraft's [[New England]], to [[Arkham House]]'s [[August Derleth]]. "Derleth told me to abandon my attempts to set my work in [[Massachusetts]]," Campbell wrote in the introduction to his collection ''Cold Print'', and he accordingly rewrote his stories with an English setting. His short story "The Tomb-Herd", for example, was originally set in Lovecraft's [[Kingsport (Lovecraft)|Kingsport, Massachusetts]]. It was transposed to the Cotswold town of Temphill when it appeared as "The Church in High Street", Campbell's first published story, in the 1962 Arkham House anthology ''Dark Mind, Dark Heart''.

In that story, Campbell refers to hints "of actual worship of [[Great Old Ones|trans-spatial beings]] still practiced in such towns as Camside, Brichester, Severnford, Goatswood, and Temphill," indicating that he had already conceived of most of the principal locations of his Severn Valley setting. At the time, the teenage Campbell had never been to the actual Severn Valley; the imaginary landscapes he described may relate more to the post-[[World War II]] [[Merseyside]] scenes he was familiar with. He recalled in an interview:

There was probably a period when I was reading and trying to imitate Lovecraft, whilst equally exploring what was then a considerably ruined Merseyside landscape. Whole slews of ruined streets, which I was perfectly happy to wander through on my way to odd, out of the way cinemas. And because I saw the city all around me as this kind of gothic, almost supernatural landscape, I think a lot of that fed into my writing.&lt;ref&gt;Cold Print (website), "A Demon by Daylight"&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell's first collection of short stories, ''The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants'' (1964), was filled with stories that take place in the Severn Valley setting, including "The Room in the Castle", "The Horror From the Bridge", "The Insects From Shaggai", "The Render of the Veils", "The Inhabitant of the Lake", "The Moon-Lens", "The Mine on Yuggoth", "The Plain of Sound", and "The Stone on the Island". His next collection, ''Demons by Daylight'' (1973), though described by Campbell as a conscious effort to throw off Lovecraft's influence, again used this Cthulhu Mythos-linked setting for several tales: "Potential", "The Sentinels", "The Interloper", "The Enchanted Fruit", "Made in Goatswood", and a [[metafiction]]al examination of Campbell's own Lovecraftian beginnings called "The Franklyn Paragraphs".

After ''Demons by Daylight'', Campbell returned to the Severn Valley sporadically, in such works as "Dolls" (in 1986's ''Scared Stiff''), "The Tugging" (''The Disciples of Cthulhu'' 1996), and the 2003 novel ''The Darkest Part of the Woods''. In 1995 he contributed a rather tongue-in-cheek story set in the Severn Valley, "The Horror Under Warrendown", to an anthology of horror fiction called ''Made in Goatswood''.

==''Made in Goatswood''==

''Made in Goatswood'', edited by Scott David Aniolowski, and published by [[Chaosium]], is a collection of stories by various writers set in Campbell's fictionalized Gloucestershire. Contributors to the anthology include [[A. A. Attanasio]], [[Richard A. Lupoff]] and [[Robert M. Price]].

==Locations==

Some of the major sites of Campbell's Severn Valley include Brichester, Goatswood, Temphill, Severnford, Clotton and Camside.

===Brichester===

'''Brichester''' is the main town of Campbell's Severn Valley, the setting of several tales and often a background element of stories that take place elsewhere. (It plays the same role in Campbell's stories that [[Arkham]] does in Lovecraft's.) "These days Brichester has an impressively mundane surface," Campbell writes in "The Franklyn Paragraphs", "but I still sense that it may crack."

"The Enchanted Fruit" portrays "the daily press of Brichester, the false harsh rainbow of packed cars," and "churches robbed of dignity by plummeting iron balls" (though the protagonist recalls "streets where some lone house had struck him speechless with its silent pride, the noble bearing of its age and history").

Brichester has a wide variety of media outlets. "The Moon Lens" refers to the ''Brichester Weekly News''. "The Tugging" establishes that the town also has a daily&amp;mdash;''The Brichester Herald'', advertised as "Brichester's Evening Voice"&amp;mdash;as well as a radio station, Radio Brichester. A reporter for the ''Herald'', Ingels, is that story's main character; he complains at one point that the town lacks a TV studio. "The Franklyn Paragraphs" gives Brichester a horror fanzine, ''Spirited''.

"Cold Print" refers to Brichester's Ultimate Press, who are described as publishing an important manuscript, once written by the medieval heretic Johannes Henricus Pott,&lt;ref&gt;Pott's untitled manuscript is mentioned in "The Mine on Yuggoth".&lt;/ref&gt; a new 12th volume of the ''[[Books in the Cthulhu Mythos#Revelations of Glaaki|Revelations of Glaaki]]'', and an entire line of bondage-related pornography. Brichester also has the True Light Press, mentioned in "The Franklyn Paragraphs," which turns out to be Roland Franklyn's self-publishing operation.

Brichester Central Library appears in "The Franklyn Paragraphs", where Errol Undercliffe notes of it, "You couldn't get farther from a Lovecraft setting." It does, however, carry a copy of Roland Franklyn's ''We Pass From View''—as well as Ramsey Campbell's ''The Inhabitant of the Lake''.

"Potential" opens at the town's Cooperative Hall, site of "Brichester's First Be-In-Free Flowers and Bells!" (The name of one of the bands that plays the be-in, the Faveolate Collosi, alludes to Campbell's story "The Mine on Yuggoth.") The Co-operative Social Club is also referred to in "The Interloper."

====Brichester University====

While "The Enchanted Fruit" mentions "the hard bleached University smashing and swallowing ornate facades," in ''The Darkest Part of the Woods,'' Brichester University's architecture is more traditional, with a "long, lofty Gothic facade, and high pointed windows." An "echoing vaulted sandstone corridor" leads from "the towering front doors of the university." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''The Darkest Part of the Woods'', Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first mentions of Brichester University' is in "The Horror From the Bridge," where it is said "they were familiar with things whose existence is not recognized by science." In that story, Philip Chesterton, formerly a librarian at the [[British Museum]], takes a job in the university's library in 1901 in order to keep an eye on strange goings on in Clotton. The library once kept copies, in a locked case, of "the ''[[Necronomicon]]'', the ''[[Books in the Cthulhu Mythos#Revelations of Glaaki|Revelations of Glaaki]]'', ''[[De Vermis Mysteriis]]'', and other titles as ominous," but in the 1960s "a Muslim student... spray(ed) them with lighter fluid and set fire to them," destroying them completely.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkest Part of the Woods'', Chapter 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Mine on Yuggoth", Brichester native Edward Taylor enrolled in the university in 1918, where he "led a witch cult, centering around a stone slab in the woods off the Severnford road." Taylor, along with other participants including "the artist Nevil Craughan, and the occultist Henry Fisher," were subsequently expelled.

There is a science-fiction shop, ''Worlds Unlimited'', near the University campus "in the dilapidated Victorian streets which have become the student quarter".&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkest Part of the Woods'', Chapter 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; In the same neighborhood is the Scholar's Rest: "Beneath a jauntily sagging slate roof the squat sandstone building faced the university campus... Each window of the pub held a swelling like a great blind eye... (T)he dim low-timbered interior was lined with old books." The pub's strongest ale is called Witch's Brew.&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkest Part of the Woods'', Chapter 10&lt;/ref&gt; Another near-campus dining option is Peace &amp; Beans, a vegetarian restaurant with "rough wooden tables" and a clientele of "students and a few health-conscious oldsters."&lt;ref&gt;''The Darkest Part of the Woods'', Chapter 11&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mercy Hill====

'''Mercy Hill''', a Brichester neighbourhood with "ribs of terraced streets," &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; stands out in Campbell's world for its "mundanity," as he describes the scene in "The Franklyn Paragraphs":

''In the streets, couples were taking their ice-creams for a walk; toward the Hill, tennis-balls were punctuating their pauses, girls were leaping, bowls were clicking, and from behind the houses, a procession was bearing trays of cakes to the pavilion.''

In the same story, however, at the "bottom of Mercy Hill" is Dee Terrace, the address of the house of Roland Franklyn, which is described as "look(ing) like [[Satan]] was in residence":

''(A)n extra room had been added on the left, and its windows had been blocked out with newer brick; all the curtains, except those of one ground-floor window draped in green, were black. The house looked deserted, the more so for its garden, which could not have been tended for years; grass and weeds grew knee-high.''

Mercy Hill is mentioned in "The Horror From the Bridge" as the site of a 19th-century prison; in "The Moon Lens," Mercy Hill Hospital is the name of the institution where, in 1961, Roy Leakey seeks mercy killing from Dr. James Linwood, an advocate of [[euthanasia]]. The story "The Mine on Yuggoth" records that Edward Taylor was taken to Mercy Hill Hospital, shortly after his failed 1924 ascent of the Devil's Steps, and ever since then, his X-ray scans have been placed in a restricted file.

Franklyn is buried in the graveyard next to Mercy Hill Hospital, where:

''(w)illows, their branches glowing stippled curves, were spaced carefully toward the Hill out of which the cemetery was carved; in the hill itself were catacombs, black behind ivy or railings, and straight above stood the hospital, a grey reminder of hope or despair... The avenues were guarded by broken-nosed angels yearning heavenward; one showed a leprous patch where her left eye and cheek had sloughed away. Urns stood here and there like empty glasses at a sick bed.''

====Lower Brichester====

The seedier side of town is known as '''Lower Brichester''', a neighborhood described in "The Franklyn Paragraphs" as "the sort of miniature cosmopolis one finds in most major English towns: three-story houses full of errant lodgers, curtains as varied as flags at a conference but more faded, the occasional smashed pane, and the frequent furtive watchers." While in "The Tugging", a tale with an apocalyptic theme, the neighborhood is depicted as being in an advanced state of dereliction:

''Dogs scrabbled clattering in gouged shop-fronts, an uprooted streetlamp lay across a road, humped earth was scattered with disembowelled mattresses, their entrails fluttering feebly. He passed houses where one window was completely blinded with brick, the next still open and filmy with a drooping curtain... (W)hole streets were derelict... gaping houses and uneven pavements... Houses went by, shoulder to shoulder, ribs open to the sky, red-brick fronts revealing their jumble of shattered walls and staircases.''

The observer finds himself sympathizing with the district's "abandonment, and indifference to time".

In "The Franklyn Paragraphs", Lower Brichester's Pitt Street is the former address of Errol Undercliffe (1937&amp;ndash;1967), a writer who specializes in "contemporary treatments of traditional macabre themes." In "The Tugging," it's the location of the Brichester Arts Lab, a program run by Annabel Pringle that practices "associational painting"&amp;mdash;a technique that uses [[free association (psychology)|free association]] to discover images, starting with suggestions from the ''[[I Ching]]''.

"Cold Print" takes place in Lower Brichester, at a bookshop known only in the story as American Books Bought and Sold. This store was the site of a manifestation of the entity [[Y'golonac]].

====Lakeside Terrace====

North of Brichester is the body of water referred to in "The Inhabitant of the Lake". Supposedly once an impact-crater, the lake is overlooked by a row of houses called '''Lakeside Terrace''', built to serve as dwellings for a small cult who worshiped the extraterrestrial being [[Glaaki]]. Led by one Thomas Lee, and remaining at the lake from 1790 until shortly after 1865, the cult received the ''Revelations of Glaaki'' as dream-sendings, and soon published an expurgated nine-volume set from an original 11-volume manuscript. Long after the cult's disappearance, local painter, Thomas Cartwright, took up residence at Lakeview Terrace, where he worked on the painting ''The Thing in the Lake'', before his mysterious demise.

====The Devil's Steps====

As described in "The Mine on Yuggoth", the '''Devil's Steps''' are a "rock formation beyond Brichester" which:

''stretched fully 200 feet up in a series of steps to a plateau; from some way off the illusion of a giant staircase was complete, and legend has it that Satan came from the sky to walk the earth by way of those steps... In the center of the plateau stood three stone towers joined by narrow catwalks of black metal between the roofs... The (central) tower is approximately 30 ft. in height, windowless, and with a strangely angled doorway opening on a staircase leading into darkness.''

At the top of the main tower is a dimensional gate to the planet [[Yuggoth]]. The towers are surrounded by an "alien species" of fungus, with "a grey stem covered with twining leaves" that uncurl toward approaching visitors.

===Goatswood===

'''Goatswood''', first described in the short story "The Moon-Lens", is an isolated town surrounded by woods to the east of Brichester. The narrator of that story is struck by the town's atmosphere: "The close-set dull-red roofs, the narrow streets, the encircling forests&amp;mdash;all seemed somehow furtive." As in Lovecraft's [[Innsmouth]], the residents of Goatswood have a distinctive, offputting appearance; a typical resident is described as "revoltingly goatlike," resembling "a medieval woodcut of a [[satyr]]," and clad in "grotesquely voluminous" garments. Instead of worshiping a race of monsters from the sea (the [[Deep Ones]]), however, they worship [[Shub-Niggurath]].

The most prominent feature of Goatswood is the titular Moon-Lens: A "metal pylon, 50 feet high, rose from the center of the square. At the top (is)... a large convex lens surrounded by an arrangement of mirrors, and all hinged on a pivot attached to the ground by taut ropes." It is said, by perhaps an unreliable character, to have originally been built by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]].

Goatswood is sometimes an unavoidable connection on the train route from Exham to Brichester. The infrequent visitors to Goatswood, "The Moon Lens" reveals, eat at the Station Cafe and stay at the Central Hotel.

In a later story, "Made in Goatswood", the village has more to offer to outsiders: a curiosity shop with a toad-like proprietor whose "hands were brown and crinkled as the paper in which he wrapped the parcels," selling disturbing lawn ornaments; a fruit stand in a "canvas stall like a shrine" where fruit resembling peaches are offered by a girl whose "eyelids lowered wickedly." There's even a red light district, Fitzroy Street, on the edge of town:

''Before the woods closed in, a last street of dingy houses lay exhausted between gardens high with grass, uneven with rocks, and, on the corner, a newspaper-shop, its cramped windows full of yellow cards; baked mud preserved the tracks of cars.''

"The Franklyn Paragraphs" mentions a number of places visited by "the circle of young men" around occultist Roland Franklyn; Goatswood is among them.

In the "woods toward Goatswood" is a clearing, according to "The Insects of Shaggai", where a meteorite once fell in the 17th century; a coven that subsequently worshiped there was executed by real-life witchfinder [[Matthew Hopkins]]. Within the clearing is a mysterious gray cone, home to the titular creatures; the story "The Moon Lens" also alludes to this artifact.

These woods are also featured in "The Enchanted Fruit", whose protagonist at first finds them enticing; "Each corridor of trees seemed made to be explored, each green shadow promised mystery;" and later forbidding; "A screen of leaves seemed secretive; parted, it revealed only vistas of dim branches." In the forest, he finds a tree whose "rich trunk, dark yet warm, stood alone on a mound of autumn built high from the edge of the glade;" he eats the fruit of this tree, "large as apples, soft and shaped as peaches," to his immediate delight and eventual regret.

===Temphill===

'''Temphill''' is the main setting for "The Church in High Street", Campbell's first published story in the Severn Valley. There it's described as a "decaying Cotswold town" and "a place of ill repute." Describing the town, the narrator notes that:

''around the blackened hotel at the center of Temphill, the buildings were often greatly dilapidated... gabled dwellings, often with broken windows, and patchily unpainted fronts, but still inhabited. Here scattered unkempt children stared resignedly from dusty front steps or played in pools of orange mud on a patch of wasted ground, while the older tenants sat in twilit rooms.''

The church of the title is set on a hill near the center of town, around which the town was built. It is said to exist "conterminously" with a temple of [[Yog-Sothoth]]. It is described:

''The steps... rose between green ruins of brick walls, to the black steeple of a church, among pallid gravestones... The tottering gravestones, overgrown with repulsively decaying vegetation, cast curious shadows over the fungus-strewn grass.''

Those who penetrate the catacombs beneath the church; reached via a trap door beneath the first set of pews; find themselves unaccountably unable to leave the town, as if the streets were turning back on themselves.

In "The Church on High Street", Temphill is home to John Clothier, "a man possessed of an extraordinary amount of ancient knowledge," and Albert Young, a young man working on a "book on witchcraft and witchcraft lore." In the subsequent story "The Horror From the Bridge," Temphill is where James Phipps acquires "extremely rare chemicals," as well as his mysterious wife.

"The Franklyn Paragraphs" lists Temphill as one of the places that "the circle of young men" around Roland Franklyn visit. Franklyn's widow, complaining about the horrors he had put her through, says: "He took me down to Temphill, and made me watch those things dancing on the graves."

===Severnford===

'''Severnford''', a community on the River Severn, almost directly northwest of Brichester, is described in "The Plain of Sound" as a dull place to visit:

''Once one leaves behind the central area of Severnford, where a group of archaic buildings is preserved, and comes to the surrounding red-brick houses, there is little to interest the sight-seer. Much of Severnford is dockland, and even the country beyond is not noticeably pleasant to the forced hiker... (S)ome of the roads are noticeably rough.''

The ''forced'' is a reference to the fact there is only one bus-route daily from Severnford to Brichester, which leaves in the morning; if visitors miss it, walking may be the only alternative. It is a full morning's walk away, and the route is not well-marked.&lt;ref name="The Plain of Sound"&gt;"The Plain of Sound"&lt;/ref&gt; (The motor route between Brichester and Severnford passes by "hills... like sleeping collosi.")&lt;ref&gt;"Potential"&lt;/ref&gt;

One attraction is the Inn at Severnford, a facility in central Severnford which is said to be "one of the oldest (inns) in England". However, in 1958 it was found to be "temporarily" closed to the public, reportedly because of repeated [[vandalism]].&lt;ref name="The Plain of Sound"/&gt;

Severnford and its outskirts are the main setting of Campbell's "The Room in the Castle", in which the Anglican church in Severnford is noted for having "a stone carving depicting an angel holding a large [[Elder Sign|star-shaped object]] in front of a cowering toad-like object."

The castle of the title is a ruined mansion on the outskirts of town, past Cotton Row: "It was set on the crest of the hill, three walls still standing, though the roof had long ago collapsed. A lone tower stood like a charred finger against the pale sky." It was once the home of Sir Gilbert Morley, described as an "18th-century warlock" who imprisoned the Great Old One [[Byatis]] in the castle's basement.

Campbell returned to Severnford in the story "Potential", a setting in which "(t)he streets were lit by gas-lamps, reflected flickering in windows set in dark moist stone." The climactic scene of that story is set in a disused Severnford pub called ''The Riverside'', used as a sort of clubhouse by cultists who listen to [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]] and read Roland Franklyn and Ultimate Press pornography. There is a suggestion that the Severnford authorities are complicit in the cult's activities: "Oh, the police know about this," one cult member says. "They're used to it by now, they don't interfere."

About two-and-a-half miles (by foot) out of Severnford, after passing a "thickly overgrown forest, where (one) would certainly have become further lost," and crossing "montonous fields (without) seeing a building or another human being," one comes to "an area of grassy hillocks," followed by a region of "miniature valleys". It is in one of these that the title phenomenon of "The Plain of Sound" was encountered, next to a house once inhabited by former Brichester University professor Arnold Hird. This peculiar phenomenon can become a gateway into the Gulf of S'glhuo.

In the story "The Faces at Pine Dunes," Severnford is named by the fictional book ''Witchcraft in England'' as one of several centers of witchcraft activity&amp;mdash;apparently the only place in the Severn Valley so listed.

====The Island beyond Severnford====

'''The island beyond Severnford''' is referred to in the title of the story "The Stone on the Island". Notes found in the story describe it:

''Approx. 200 feet across. roughly circular. Little vegetation except short grass. Ruins of [[Roman mythology|Roman]] temple to unnamed deity at the center of island (top of slight hill). Opp. side of hill from Severnford, about 35 ft. down, artificial hollow extending back 10 ft. and containing stone.''

''Island continuously site of worship. Poss. pre-Roman nature deity (stone predates Roman occupation); the Roman temple built. In medieval times [[European witchcraft|witch]] supposed to live on island. In 17th cen. witch-cult met there and invoked [[Elemental|water elementals]]. In all cases stone avoided. Circa. 1790, witch-cult disbanded, but stray believers continued to visit.''

In the 19th century, the island became associated with a series of shocking mutilations. Victims, only some of whom survive the ordeal, began with witch-cult follower Joseph Norton in 1803, followed by Severnford [[clergyman]] Nevill Rayner in 1826, an unnamed [[prostitute]] in 1866, who was taken to Brichester Central Hospital, a local [[folklore|folk customs]] investigator named Alan Thorpe in 1870, a Brichester University student in 1930, and Mercy Hill [[paranormal]] researcher Dr. Stanley Nash and his son Michael (the latest victim) in 1962.

"The island beyond Severnford" is visited by Franklyn's circle in "The Franklyn Paragraphs". The island is reachable via: "a small hut" "on the edge of the docks" that advertises, "Hire a boat and see the Severn at its best!" &lt;ref&gt;"The Stone on the Island"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clotton===

'''Clotton''', the scene of Campbell's "[[The Dunwich Horror|Dunwich Horror]]" pastiche, "The Horror From the Bridge", is a small town set where the river Ton flows into the Severn. Only a "few leaning red-brick houses... remain of the uptown section of the once-prosperous town;" the rest of the town was deliberately destroyed in 1931, for reasons explained in the story. In "The Horror Under Warrendown," Clotton is mentioned as "a small settlement which appeared to be largely abandoned, its few occupied houses huddling together on each side of a river." The story notes the town's "stagnant almost reptilian smell and chilly haze."

The town's most noteworthy feature, also dating to 1931, is a "20-foot high concrete building...on the bank of the Ton", with an "eldritch sign clumsily engraved on each wall",&lt;ref name="The Horror From the Bridge"&gt;"The Horror From the Bridge"&lt;/ref&gt; carvings that "were blurred by moss and weather."&lt;ref&gt;"The Horror Under Warrendown"&lt;/ref&gt;

The town was once home to James Phipps, "a gaunt pallid-faced man, with jet-black hair, and long bony hands" who died in 1898, aged well over a century, and his son Lionel Phipps (1806&amp;ndash;1931). Both were odd individuals given to "unorthodox scientific researches" and nocturnal excavation. They lived on Riverside Alley, "a little-tenanted street within sight of a bridge over the Ton".&lt;ref name="The Horror From the Bridge"/&gt;

Outside of Clotton, according to "The Horror From the Bridge", there is a "pit on a patch of waste ground on what used to be Canning Road, near the river," containing "roughly-cut steps, each carrying a carven five-pointed sign, which led down into abysmal darkness."

In "The Franklyn Paragraphs," which mentions Clotton as another place visited by the Franklyn circle, Franklyn's widow notes that "we went down the steps below Clotton."

===Camside===

'''Camside''' is home to the occultist Henry Fisher, who summons the Elder God [[Daoloth]] in the story "The Render of the Veils".&lt;ref&gt;Fisher was expelled from Brichester University in "The Mine on Yuggoth".&lt;/ref&gt; The town's paper, the ''Camside Observer'', is mentioned in that story, as well as in "The Room in the Castle", which also notes that the town was the home of James Phipps, until he was expelled in 1800 for practicing weird science, resettling in Clotton.

In "The Mine on Yuggoth", Edward Taylor is committed to the Camside Home for the Mentally Disturbed in 1924, after his ascent of the Devil's Steps.

===Warrendown===

In "The Horror Under Warrendown", written for the 1995 Severn Valley anthology ''Made in Goatswood'', Campbell introduced '''Warrendown''', a village off the main road between [[Birmingham]] and Brichester. (Clotton, the story notes, is between Brichester and Warrendown.) The narrator describes it as:

''an insignificant huddle of buildings miles from anywhere.... Where the road descended to the level of the village it showed me that the outermost cottages were so squat they appeared to have collapsed or to be sinking into the earth of the unpaved road. Thatch obscured their squinting windows.... At the center of Warrendown the cottages, some of which I took to be shops without signs, crowded towards the road as if forced by the mounds behind them, mounds as broad as the cottages but lower, covered with thatch or grass. Past the center the buildings were more sunken; more than one had collapsed, while others were so overgrown that only glimpses through the half-obscured unglazed windows of movements, ill-defined and sluggish, suggested that they were inhabited.''

Near the edge of the village, which is only half a mile wide, there is a school, described as "one long mound fattened by a pelt of thatch, grass, and moss." The school is connected to a rotting, half-ruined church that "once possessed a tower, the overgrown stones of which were scattered beyond the edge of the village." Inside the church, "the dozen or so pews on either side of the aisle, each pew broad enough to accommodate a large family, were only bloated green with moss and weeds; but the altar before them had been levered up, leaning its back against the rear wall of the church and exposing the underside of its stone." Where the altar used to be is the entrance to a system of tunnels that lead to the entity referred to in the story's title.

The air in the village is filled with a "rotten vegetable sweetness". The inhabitants, like those of Lovecraft's [[Innsmouth]], share a "look", but while the people of Innsmouth resemble frogs, those of Warrendown call to mind rabbits, with "plump yet flattish face(s)" that sometimes appear furry, "swollen" eyes, "bestial" teeth, and outsized ears and feet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1556">'''Sulaiman''' or '''Soleiman al-Tajir''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] for "Soloman the Merchant") was a 9th-century [[Muslim]] [[merchant]], [[travel]]er and writer initially from [[Siraf]] in modern-day [[Iran]]. He traveled to [[India]] and [[China]] and wrote an account of his voyages around {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;850.

==Historical Accounts==
Sulaiman visited India during the time of the [[Pala Empire]], which then ruled present day [[West Bengal]] and [[Assam]] provinces of India and present day [[Bangladesh]]. He calls Pala kingdom 'Ruhma' and attests to their military power.

During his stay in the city of [[Guangzhou]] he noted that the Chinese used fingerprint records to maintain the identities of newly arrived foreigners, charged extortionate rates for imported goods and that the route to China by sea was dangerous due to piracy and frequent rain. He mentions that the local [[Muslim]] populace of Guangzhou had their own [[Mosque]] and [[bazaar]]s. He mentioned that the Muslim community had its own [[Imam]] and Judge (appointed by [[Emperor Xuānzong of Tang]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.muslimheritage.com/uploads/China%201.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He also observes the manufacturing of [[porcelain]], the [[granary]] system of Guangzhou, and how its municipal administration functioned.

After arriving home from China with goods he landed at [[Basra]] and then traveled to [[Baghdad]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3515">The '''Taixinan Basin''' ({{zh|c=台西南盆地|p=Táixīnán Péndì}}), sometimes rendered literally as '''Southwest Taiwan Basin''' or '''Southwestern Taiwan Basin''', also called the '''Tainan Basin''' (Chinese: 台南盆地), is a [[Structural basin|basin]] located in the southern [[Taiwan Strait]] and the northeastern [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;"台西南盆地和北港隆起的中生界及其沉积环境" by 周蒂&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
[[File:TaixinanPendi.JPG|thumb|320px|right|Map of the approximate location of the Taixinan Basin]]

The Taixinan Basin is in the southern Taiwan Strait and the northeastern South China Sea. It is bordered by the Penghu Uplift (Chinese: 澎湖隆起) in the north, the Dongsha Uplift in the southwest, and the South China Sea basin in the south. It is separated from the Zhujiangkou Basin (Chinese: 珠江口盆地) by the Dongsha Uplift. In the northeast, it stretches inland onto the southwest [[Taiwan Island]].&lt;ref name="利用重力資料估算台灣海峽之莫霍面深度 史旻弘"&gt;"利用重力資料估算台灣海峽之莫霍面深度" by 史旻弘&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
Taixinan Basin is located on the continental shelf, on the margin of the continental crust.&lt;ref name="利用重力資料估算台灣海峽之莫霍面深度 史旻弘"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Its tectonic evolution can be divided in three periods. The first period was from Paleocene to Oligocene. Starting in the Paleocene, Taixinan Basin had been experiencing the effect of rifting, which eventually caused the formation of the basin. The tensile stress field was in the NE-SW direction. Many normal faults developed at this period. The second period was the end of Oligocene. During this period, the Taixinan Basin experienced the effect of compression. Part of the early normal faults underwent tectonic inversion, and a lot of reverse faults and related folds developed. The third period was the thermal subsidence beginning from Miocene. Since the late Miocene, the South China Sea basin stopped its expansion. During this period, the [[sediment]] layers are horizontal and basically not controlled by the effects of faulting.&lt;ref&gt;"台西南盆地新生代主要断裂发育特征" by 丁巍伟, 王渝明, 陈汉林, 杨树锋, and 吴能有&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"南海北部深水盆地沉积－构造的差异性及其油气意义" by 吕宝凤 and 袁亚娟&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"南海盆地生物礁形成条件及发育趋势" by 魏喜, 祝永军, 尹继红, 陈亦寒, and 刘东齐&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topography==
The Taixinan Basin is in the direction of NE, with a length of about 400km, average width of 150 km, and an area of more than 60000 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="利用重力資料估算台灣海峽之莫霍面深度 史旻弘"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Taixinan Basin, there are two depressions in the north and the south, separated by an uplift in the NE direction. The thickness of the Cenozoic sediments in the depressions can reach 8000 m, increasing from west to east. In the eastern part of the basin, the thickness of the sediments can reach 7000 m offshore [[Kaohsiung]].&lt;ref name="利用重力資料估算台灣海峽之莫霍面深度 史旻弘"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Onshore, on the southwest Taiwan Island, there is a distribution of normal faults of Paleogene.&lt;ref&gt;"以中尺度反射震测法研究屯子脚断层活动机制及构造上的意义" by 李奕亨&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Pages Conservation Park''' is a [[protected area]] in the [[Australia|Australian state]] of  [[South Australia]] located about {{convert|25|km|abbr=off}} south-east of [[Cape Jervis]]  and about {{convert|98|km|abbr=off}} south south-west of [[Adelaide city centre]].  It consists of the island group known as [[The Pages]] and adjoining waters.  The protected area status exists to protect the island group’s use as a breeding area by [[Australian sea lion]]s and sea birds.  The proclamation as The Pages Conservation Park in 1972 after the enactment of the ''[[National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972]]'' replaced the island group’s previous protected status as a Fauna Conservation Reserve proclaimed under the ''Crown Lands Act 1929-1967'' in 1967.  The boundary of the conservation park was extended {{convert|3|nmi|km|0}} seawards during the 1990s in order to control berleying associated with both [[shark tourism|shark cage diving]] and shark fishing.  The conservation park is classified as an [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] [[IUCN protected area categories#Category Ia — Strict Nature Reserve|Category IA protected area]].&lt;ref name=CAPAD2012SASum/&gt;&lt;ref name=mp&gt;{{cite book |title=Island conservation parks of Backstairs Passage and Encounter Bay management plans|author= |year=1983 |series= |publisher=National Parks and Wildlife Service |location=Adelaide |isbn=0-7243-4588-4|pages=iii, 2 &amp;3|url= http://www.environment.sa.gov.au/files/3a256f5d-26ce-4c7a-a634-9e4f00b1a650/PARKS_PDFS_ISLD_CP_BACKST_P_MP.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker421&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=J.L|title=Towards a System of Ecologically Representative Marine Protected Areas in South Australian Marine Bioregions - Technical Report.

The '''United Nations Spatial Data Infrastructure''' (UNSDI) is an institutional and technical mechanism for establishing system coherence for the exchange and applications of [[Geographic data and information|geospatial data]] and information for [[United Nations|UN]] activities and supporting [[Spatial data infrastructure|SDI]] (Spatial Data Infrastructure) development activities in [[Member states of the United Nations|Member Countries]].

__TOC__

==Background of UNSDI==
[http://www.ungiwg.org/content/united-nations-spatial-data-infrastructure-unsdi UNSDI] is an initiative of the [http://www.ungiwg.org United Nations Geographic Information Working Group (UNGIWG)], a voluntary network of UN professionals working in the fields of cartography and geographic information science.

UNSDI aims to contribute to the mission of the United Nations, from to [[United Nations peacekeeping|peacekeeping]] to humanitarian relief, from climate change to disaster reduction, response and recovery, from environmental protection to poverty reduction, food security, water management and economic development and to contribute to the realization of the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]]. By facilitating efficient global and local access, exchange and utilization of geospatial information, UNSDI will make the United Nations system more effective and support its “Delivering as One” policies.

Spatial data infrastructures provide the institutional and technical foundation of policies, standards and procedures that enable organizations and information systems to interact in a way that facilitates spatial data discovery, evaluation and applications.

Given that UN agencies vary in their ability to utilise and manage geospatial information it is foreseen{{By whom|date=April 2017}} that UNSDI will reduce development and operational costs by working together to achieve economies of scale through generic standards, guidelines and implementation tools. Thus, the development of UNSDI is considered essential{{By whom|date=April 2017}} for increasing system coherence in the use and exchange of geospatial data and information for UN activities.

In the short term, UNSDI is an investment into the capacities of the [[United Nations System]] to manage its existing geo-spatial assets more effectively. Additionally UNSDI may serve as a model and vehicle for capacity building in some Member States that request assistance from the United Nations in managing and applying geospatial data to support their national development agenda.

==Development at global level==
At present the Center of Excellence for UNSDI has been established. The first phase of UNSDI developments consist of a Gazetteer, a Geospatial Data Warehouse, and a Visualization Facility. Two donor countries are involved in the present developments: [[Australia]] and [[Germany]]. Australia is funding the Gazetteer project, Germany has supplied office and staffing facilities for the UNSDI Center of Excellence in [[Bonn]]. The proposal for funding of the Geospatial Data Warehouse and associated activities is to be submitted to the [[Netherlands]] in Q4 of 2012.

==Development at regional level==
The following Regional Organizations joined the process:
* [http://www.rcmrd.org Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD)] in Nairobi, [[Kenya]]
* [[ICIMOD|International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD)]] in Kathmandu, Nauru, [[Nepal]]
* [http://www.rectas.org Regional Centre for Training in Aerospace Surveys (RECTAS)] in Ile-Ife, [[Nigeria]].

==Development at national level==
Underlying the UNSDI is the need to link UNSDI with '''national''' public and private geospatial and SDI capacities, both in developed and developing countries. To this end National Coordination Offices (NCOs) for UNSDI are to be established. Below the established NCOs are listed.

Although some of the NCOs use the acronym UN and the UN emblem in their official title, they are not affiliated with the United Nations. Use of the emblem is restricted, based on [https://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/maplib/flag.htm General Assembly resolution 92(I),1946], and should be not be used by non-UN entities.

With the following countries discussions on UNSDI participation are ongoing: [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Brazil]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Chile]], [[Jamaica]], [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Mexico]], [[Morocco]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Spain]] and [[South Africa]].

The '''Vector Map (VMAP)''', also called '''Vector Smart Map''', is a [[vector graphics|vector]]-based collection of [[geographic information system]] (GIS) data about [[Earth]] at various levels of detail. Level 0 (low resolution) coverage is global and entirely in the [[public domain]]. Level 1 (global coverage at medium resolution) is only partly in the public domain.

==Description==
*[[Geographic coordinate system|Coordinate reference system]]: Geographic coordinates stored in decimal degrees with southern and western hemispheres using negative values for latitude and longitude, respectively.
*[[Map projection|Horizontal Datum]]: [[World Geodetic System]] 1984 (WGS 84).
*Vertical Datum: [[Sea level|Mean Sea Level]].

===Thematic data layers===
Features and data attributes are tagged utilizing the international Feature and Attribute Coding Catalogue (FACC).
#major [[road]] networks
#[[Rail transport|railroad]] networks
#[[Hydrology|hydrologic]] drainage systems
#utility networks (cross-country [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and [[Electric power transmission|communication lines]])
#major [[airport]]s
#[[elevation]] contours
#coastlines
#[[Border|international boundaries]]
#populated places
#index of geographical names

==Levels of resolution==
The '''vector map''' product are usually seen as being of three different types: low resolution (level 0), medium resolution (level 1) and high resolution (level 2).

===Level Zero (VMAP0)===
'''Level 0''' provides worldwide coverage of geo-spatial data and is equivalent to a small [[Scale (map)|scale]] (1:1,000,000). The data are offered either on CD-ROM or as direct download, as they have been moved to the [[public domain]]. Data are structured following the [[Vector Product Format]] (VPF),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.mil/portal/site/nga01/index.jsp?epi-content=GENERIC&amp;itemID=a2986591e1b3af00VgnVCMServer23727a95RCRD&amp;beanID=1629630080&amp;viewID=Article Vector Product Format] - at [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|National Geospatial Intelligence Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt; compliant with standards MIL-V-89039 and MIL-STD 2407

====Data sets====
The entire coverage has been divided into four data sets:
#[[North America]] (NOAMER) [http://geoengine.nga.mil/ftpdir/archive/vpf_data/v0noa.tar.gz v0noa]
#[[Europe]] and North [[Asia]] (EURNASIA) [http://geoengine.nga.mil/ftpdir/archive/vpf_data/v0eur.tar.gz v0eur]
#[[South America]], [[Africa]], and [[Antarctica]] (SOAMAFR) [http://geoengine.nga.mil/ftpdir/archive/vpf_data/v0soa.tar.gz v0soa]
#South [[Asia]] and [[Australia]] (SASAUS) [http://geoengine.nga.mil/ftpdir/archive/vpf_data/v0sas.tar.gz v0sas]

===Level One (VMAP1)===
Level 1 data are equivalent to a medium scale resolution (1:250,000). Level 1 tiles follow the ''MIL-V-89033'' standard.
* Horizontal accuracy: 125-500m
* Vertical accuracy: 0.5-2 Contour Interval (for example: if contour interval 50 m, accuracy will be 25 to 100m)

====Data sets====
VMAP Level 1 is divided in 234 geographical tiles. Only 57 of them are currently (2006) available for download from [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|NGA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://geoengine.nga.mil/geospatial/SW_TOOLS/NIMAMUSE/webinter/rast_roam.html NGA raster roam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721212504/http://geoengine.nga.mil/geospatial/SW_TOOLS/NIMAMUSE/webinter/rast_roam.html |date=2012-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the available datasets, coverage can be found for parts of [[Costa Rica]], [[Libya]], [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Iraq]], [[Russia]], [[Panama]], [[Colombia]] and [[Japan]].

===Level Two (VMAP2)===
Level 2 data are equivalent to a large scale resolution. Level 2 tiles follow the ''MIL-V-89032'' standard.
* Horizontal accuracy: 50-200m
* Vertical accuracy: 0.5-2 Contour Interval (for example: if contour interval 50 m, accuracy will be 25 to 100m)

==Debate about availability of data==
The USA [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] and the Electronic Freedom of Information Act guarantee access to virtually all GIS data created by the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]]. Following [[Freedom of information legislation|the trend]] of the [[United States]], much of the VMAP data has been offered to the [[public domain]].

But many countries consider mapping and [[cartography]] a [[state monopoly]]; for such countries, the VMAP Level1 data are kept out of the public domain. With the privatization of public agencies, some data are sold for a profit.

Various public groups are making efforts to have all VMAP1 data moved to the public domain in accordance with [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georeference.org/doc/manifold.htm#public_access_to_public_data.htm Initiative regarding VMAP under FOIA]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further steps have been taken by the ''Free World Maps Foundation'' and others to have the data licensed under the [[GNU General Public License]], while remaining copyrighted, as an alternative to the public domain. This is an ongoing debate (as of 2006).

==Copyrights==

===VMAP0===
The U.S. government has released the data into public domain, with the following conditions imposed (quotation from VMAP0 Copyright Statement):

{{quote|
As an agency of the United States government, NIMA makes no copyright claim under Title 17 of the United States Code with respect to any copyrightable material compiled in these products, nor requires compensation for their use.

The VMAP0 download page&lt;ref&gt;[http://geoengine.nga.mil/muse-cgi-bin/rast_roam.cgi NGA VMAP0 download page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703023454/http://geoengine.nga.mil/muse-cgi-bin/rast_roam.cgi |date=2006-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; states:

{{quote|Internal data reference to the CD-ROM being "LIMITED DISTRIBUTION" should be ignored.}}

However, all is not quite what it seems. There is a 'readme1.txt' file located in the v0eur, v0sas, and v0soa directories. This file contains information saying that layers: Boundaries Coverage and the Reference Library, are copyrighted to the [[Environmental Systems Research Institute]].

If these copyrighted layers are not used there is no violation of any copyrights.

==Tools to read and convert VMAP data==
*VPFView (V2.1) - developed by [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|NIMA]], is available from [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|NGA]] or [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] (as part of the NIMAMUSE package&lt;ref&gt;[http://earth-info.nga.mil/geospatial/SW_TOOLS/NIMAMUSE/ NGA] - NIMAMUSE package&lt;/ref&gt;); this tool can render simple plots and export [[GIS]] data to other [[GIS file formats]]
* "[[GDAL|OGR]] with OGDI driver":&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ OGR with ODGI driver]&lt;/ref&gt; this [[free software]] tool can convert VMAP format to standard [[GIS file formats]] such as [[Shapefile|SHAPE]], [[PostGIS]] etc.

==History==
[[Image:NGA-seal.jpg|thumb|150px|''National Geospatial Intelligence Agency'']]
*1991-1993: The ''National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA)'' develops the [[Digital Chart of the World|Digital Chart of the World (DCW)]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maproom.psu.edu/dcw/ Digital Chart of the World] - [[Digital Chart of the World|DCW]] data access site&lt;/ref&gt; for the US Defense Mapping Agency (DMA) with themes including Political/Ocean Populated Places, Railroads, Roads, Utilities, Drainage, [[Hypsography]], Land Cover, Ocean Features, Physiography, Aeronautical, Cultural Landmarks, Transportation Structure and Vegetation. One of the sources for the data was the ''Operational Navigation Chart'' that compiles military mapping from Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, and the United States.
VMAP (level 0) is a slightly more detailed reiteration of the DCW.&lt;br&gt;
VMAP (level 1) has much higher resolution data.
*2004 The ''National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA)'' is renamed to [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] which will include other mapping agencies such as the ''Defense Mapping Agency (DMA)'', the ''Central Imagery Office (CIO)'' and the ''Defense Dissemination Program Office (DDPO)''. All VMAP data will subsequently be distributed through the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|NGA]].

'''Yuly Mikhailovich Shokalsky''' ({{lang-ru|Юлий Михайлович Шокальский}}; October 17, 1856 in [[Saint Petersburg]] &amp;ndash; March 26, 1940 in [[Leningrad]]) was a [[Russia]]n [[oceanographer]], [[cartographer]], and [[geographer]]. 
==Career==
A grandson of [[Anna Petrovna Kern|Anna Kern]], [[Pushkin]]'s celebrated mistress,  Shokalsky graduated from the Naval Academy in 1880 and made a career in the [[Imperial Russian Navy]], helping establish the [[Sevastopol Marine Observatory]] and rising to the rank of Lieutenant-General in 1912. At the same time, he developed interest in [[limnology]] and [[meteorology]] and became the most prolific Russian author on the subjects. In the ''Marine Miscellanies'' alone, he published some 300 articles. [[File:Russian_Empire_Map.jpg|thumb|A 1912 map of the Russian Empire by Shokalsky, with his personal dedication to the [[Library of Congress]] in the upper left corner.]]

Shokalsky's most important monograph was ''Oceanography'' (1917), a collection of his lectures which examined connection between [[meteorology]] and [[hydrology]] and emphasized the importance of monitoring marine phenomena in order to understand global changes of climate. Shokalsky insisted on differentiating oceanography and [[hydrography]] and coined the term "[[World Ocean]]". 

In 1904, Shokalsky was elected into the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. Ten years later, he was put in charge of the Russian Geographical Society and retained the post until 1931. 

==Honours==
His name was given to the [[Shokalsky Strait]] connecting the [[Laptev Sea]] and the [[Kara Sea]], to the large [[Shokalskogo Island|Shokalsky Island]] in the Kara Sea, and to the ship ''[[Akademik Shokalskiy]]''.
