[[File:Three Main Abrahamic Religions.svg|200px|thumb|[[Religious symbol|Symbols]] of the three largest Abrahamic religions: the Jewish [[Star of David]], the [[Christian cross]], and the Islamic [[star and crescent]].]]

The '''Abrahamic religions''', also referred to collectively as '''Abrahamism''', are a group of [[Semitic people|Semitic]]-originated [[Religion|religious]] communities of faith that claim descent from the [[Judaism]] of the ancient [[Israelites]] and the worship of the [[Yahweh|God of Abraham]]. The Abrahamic religions are monotheistic religions: they worship only one god, the unique God. The term derives from patriarch Abraham, a major biblical figure from ''The Old Testament'', which is recognized by Christians, Muslims and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2010 |title=Philosophy of Religion |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497132/philosophy-of-religion |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=24 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100721151923/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/497132/philosophy-of-religion |archivedate=21 July 2010  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Abrahamic religion spread globally through [[Christianity]] being adopted by the [[Roman Empire]] in the 4th century and [[Islam]] by the [[List of Muslim states and dynasties|Islamic Empires]] from the 7th century. Today the Abrahamic religions are one of the major divisions in [[comparative religion]] (along with [[Indian religions|Indian]], [[Iranian religions|Iranian]], and [[East Asian religions]]).&lt;ref name="Adams2"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-38030/classification-of-religions C.J.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Worldwide percentage of Adherents by Religion.png|thumb|450px|Major religious groups as a percentage of world population]]
It was suggested by Louis Massignon that the phrase "Abrahamic religion" means that all these religions come from one spiritual source.&lt;ref name="Massignon 1949" /&gt; [[Paul the Apostle]] referred to Abraham as the "father of us all".{{bibleref2c|Rom.|4}} There is a Quranic term, ''[[millat Ibrahim]]'', 'religion of Ibrahim',&lt;ref name="J.Smith98" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anidjar2001" /&gt; indicating that Islam sees itself as standing in a tradition of religious practice from Abraham.&lt;ref&gt;The Quran, albaqarah; v. 135&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish tradition claims that the Jews are descended from Abraham, and adherents of Judaism derive their spiritual identity from Abraham as the first of the three "fathers" or [[Patriarchs (Bible)|biblical Patriarchs]]: Abraham, [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]].

All the major Abrahamic religions claim a direct lineage to [[Abraham]], although in Christianity this is understood in spiritual terms:
* Abraham is recorded in the [[Torah]] as the ancestor of the [[Israelites]] through his son [[Isaac]], born to [[Sarah]] through a promise made in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].{{bibleref2c|Gen.|17:16}}&lt;ref&gt;Scherman, pp.&amp;nbsp;34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Most Christians affirm the ancestral origin of the Jews in Abraham, but, as [[gentiles]], they consider themselves as grafted into the family tree under the [[New Covenant]]: see [[#For Christians|significance of Abraham for Christians]] for details.
* It is the Islamic tradition that Muhammad, as an [[Arabs|Arab]], is descended from Abraham's son [[Ishmael]]. Jewish tradition also equates the descendants of Ishmael, [[Ishmaelites]], with Arabs, while the descendants of Isaac by Jacob, who was also later known as Israel, are the Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;Saheeh al-Bukharee, Book 55, hadith no. 584; Book 56, hadith no. 710&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Báb]], regarded by Bahá'í's as a predecessor to Bahá'u'lláh, was a [[Sayyid]], or a direct descendant of Muhammad and thus traces his ancestry to Abraham's son Ishmael. Tradition also holds that [[Bahá'u'lláh]] is a descendant of Abraham through his third wife, [[Keturah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Part Four – On the Origin, Powers and Conditions of Man |url=http://www.bahai-library.com/writings/abdulbaha/saq/57.html |website=Bahai-library.com |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam Dodds argues that the term "Abrahamic faiths", while helpful, can be considered misleading, as it conveys an unspecified historical and theological commonality that is problematic on closer examination. While there is commonality among the religions, in large measure their shared ancestry is peripheral to their respective foundational beliefs and thus conceals crucial differences.&lt;ref name="Dodds" /&gt; For example, the common Christian beliefs of [[Incarnation]], [[Trinity]] and the [[resurrection of Jesus]] are not accepted by Judaism or Islam (see for example [[Islamic view of Jesus' death]]). There are key beliefs in both Islam and Judaism that are not shared by most of Christianity (such as strict [[monotheism]] and [[religious law|adherence to Divine Law]]), and key beliefs of Islam, Christianity, and the Bahá'í Faith not shared by Judaism (such as the [[prophet]]ic and [[Messiah|Messianic]] position of [[Jesus and Messianic prophecy|Jesus]], respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Greenstreet, p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges to term ==
The appropriateness of grouping Judaism, Christianity, and Islam by the terms "Abrahamic religions" or "Abrahamic traditions" has been challenged.

In 2012, Alan L. Berger, Professor of Judaic Studies at Florida Atlantic University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.fau.edu/aberger/web/bio.htm |title=Dr. Alan L. Berger |website=Florida Atlantic University}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his Preface to ''Trialogue and Terror: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam after 9/11'' wrote that there are "commonalities", but "there are essential differences between the Abrahamic traditions" both "historical and theological". Although "Judaism birthed both Christianity and Islam", the "three monotheistic faiths went their separate ways". The three faiths "understand the role of Abraham" in "differing ways", and the relationships between Judaism and Christianity and between Judaism and Islam are "uneven". Also, the three traditions are "demographically unbalanced and ideologically diverse".&lt;ref&gt;Alan L. Berger, ed., ''Trialogue and Terror: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam after 9/11'' (Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2012), xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2012, [[Aaron W. Hughes]] published a book about the category Abrahamic religions as an example of "abuses of history." He said that only recently the category "Abrahamic religions" has come into use and that it is a "vague referent." It is "largely a theological neologism" and "an artificial and imprecise" term. Combining the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions into this one category might serve the purpose of encouraging "interfaith trialogue", but it is not true to the "historical record". Abrahamic religions is "an ahistorical category". There are "certain family resemblances" among these three religions, but the "amorphous" term Abrahamic religions prevents an understanding of the "complex nature" of the interactions among them. Furthermore, the three religions do not share the same story of Abraham. For these and other reasons, Hughes argued that the term should not be used, at least in academic circles.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron W. Hughes, ''Abrahamic Religions: On the Uses and Abuses of History'' (Oxford University Press, 2012), 3–4, 7–8, 17, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religions ==
=== Judaism ===
{{Main article|Jewish history}}
[[File:Skverer Rebbe With Torah.jpg|thumb|200px|A Jewish Rebbe holds Torah]]
One of Judaism's primary texts is the [[Tanakh]], an account of the [[Israelite]]s' relationship with God from their earliest history until the building of the [[Second Temple]] (c. 535 BCE). [[Abraham]] is hailed as the first [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] and the father of the [[Jews|Jewish people]]. One of his great-grandsons was [[Judah (Biblical person)|Judah]], from whom the religion ultimately gets its name. The Israelites were initially a number of tribes who lived in the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah]].

After being conquered and exiled, some members of the Kingdom of Judah eventually returned to Israel. They later formed an independent state under the [[Hasmonean dynasty]] in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE, before becoming a client kingdom of the [[Roman Empire]], which also conquered the state and dispersed its inhabitants. From the 2nd to the 6th centuries Jews wrote the [[Talmud]], a lengthy work of legal rulings and Biblical exegesis which, along with the Tanakh, is a key text of Judaism.

=== Christianity ===
{{Main article|History of Christianity}}
[[File:Central Italian School 16th century Head of God the Father.jpg|thumb|200px|Central Italian School 16th century Head of God the Father]]
Christianity [[Christianity in the 1st century|began in the 1st century]] as a sect within Judaism initially led by Jesus. His followers viewed him as the [[Messiah]], as in the [[Confession of Peter]]; after his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and death they came to view him as [[Incarnation|God incarnate]],&lt;ref&gt;Pavlac, Brian A (2010). ''A Concise Survey of Western Civilization: Supremacies and Diversities''.  Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt; who was [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected]] and will [[Second Coming|return]] at the end of time to [[Last Judgment|judge the living and the dead]] and create an eternal [[Kingdom of God]]. Within a few decades the new movement [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|split from Judaism]].

After several periods of alternating persecution and relative peace ''vis a vis'' the Roman authorities under different administrations, Christianity became the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in 380, but has been [[Early centers of Christianity|split into various churches from its beginning]]. An attempt was made by the [[Byzantine Empire]] to unify [[Christendom]], but this formally failed with the [[East–West Schism]] of 1054. In the 16th century, the birth and growth of Protestantism further split Christianity into many denominations.

=== Islam ===
{{Main article|History of Islam}}
[[File:Abraham tomb.JPG|thumb|200px|The tomb of [[Abraham]], a [[cenotaph]] above the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] traditionally considered to be the burial place of Abraham.]]
Islam is based on the teachings of the [[Quran]]. Although it considers Muhammad to be the [[Seal of the prophets]], Islam teaches that every [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]] preached Islam, providing a historical back-story for the religion by independently recognizing Jewish and Christian prophets, and adding others. The teachings of Quran are presented as the direct revelation and words of [[Allah]]. Islam (meaning "submission", in the sense of submission to God) is universal (membership is open to anyone); like Judaism, it has a strictly unitary conception of God, called ''[[tawhid]]'', or "strict" or "simple" monotheism.&lt;ref name="BBCIslam"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/ataglance/glance.shtml Religions » Islam » Islam at a glance], BBC, 5 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Abrahamic religions ===
Historically, the Abrahamic religions have been considered to be Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Some of this is due to the age and larger size of these three. The other, similar religions were seen as either too new to judge as being truly in the same class, or too small to be of significance to the category.

However, some of the restriction of Abrahamic to these three is due only to tradition in historical classification. Therefore, restricting the category to these three religions has come under criticism.&lt;ref name="trialogue"&gt;*{{cite web| last = Micksch | first = Jürgen | title = Trialog International – Die jährliche Konferenz | publisher = Herbert Quandt Stiftung |year=2009 |url=http://www.herbert-quandt-stiftung.de/root/index.php?lang=de&amp;page_id=885 |accessdate=19 September 2009}}

==== Bahá'í Faith ====
{{Main article|Bahá'í Faith}}
[[File:Bahai star.svg|thumb|110px|Nine-point star of Bahá'í Faith]]
The Bahá'í Faith, which dates only to the late 19th century, has sometimes been listed as Abrahamic by scholarly sources in various fields.&lt;ref name="Lubar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="human rights"&gt;{{cite conference |author=Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies |title=Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and related forms of Intolerance, follow-up and implementation of the Durhan Declaration and Programme of Action |booktitle=Human Rights Council; Ninth session; Agenda item 9 |publisher=United Nations |date=29 August 2008 |url=http://www.ecoi.net/file_upload/1227_1225896113_egypt.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=19 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lawson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lawson |first=Todd |editor-last=Cusack |editor-first=Carole M. |editor2-last=Hartney |editor2-first=Christopher |title=Baha'i Religious History |journal=Journal of Religious History |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=463–470 |date=13 December 2012 |url=http://bahai-library.com/lawson_bahai_religious_history |jstor= |issn=1467-9809 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9809.2012.01224.x |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though smaller and younger than the well-known Abrahamic religions, the Bahá'í Faith is significant because of its activities, distribution and numbers. The religion is almost entirely contained in a single, organized community with international, national, regional, and local administration, without sects or subdivisions, and is recognized as the second-most geographically widespread religion after Christianity.&lt;ref name="britannica_stats_b"&gt;{{Cite book |chapter=Worldwide Adherents of All Religions by Six Continental Areas, Mid-2002 |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |author=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-85229-555-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Denis |last=MacEoin |chapter=Baha'i Faith |editor=Hinnells, John R. |title=The New Penguin Handbook of Living Religions: Second Edition |publisher=[[Penguin books|Penguin]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-14-051480-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] estimated some 7.3&amp;nbsp;million Bahá'ís in 2005&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web |title=World Religions (2005) |work=QuickLists – The World – Religions |publisher=The Association of Religion Data Archives |year=2005 |url=http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_125.asp |accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the only religion to consistently surpass population growth in each major region of the planet over the last century, often growing at twice the rate of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnson |first=Todd M. |author2=Brian J.

====  Bábism ====
{{Main article|Bábism}}Bábism{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} ({{lang-fa|بابیه}}, ''Babiyye''), also known as the Bayání Faith&lt;ref&gt;This has been the standard term which the modern followers of Bábism have adopted in order to identify themselves, however it has not been popular within scholarship, modern and contemporary to the religion's founders, the majority of scholars—such as Browne for instance—choosing to refer to the religion as Bábism or the Bábí Faith&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Varnava, Andrekos, Nicholas Coureas, and Marina Elia, eds. The Minorities of Cyprus: Development patterns and the identity of the internal-exclusion. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009. p.&amp;nbsp;362&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Arabic]]: {{Lang|ar|بيانة}}, ''Bayání''), is an Abrahamic [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] religion which professes that there is one incorporeal, unknown, and incomprehensible God&lt;ref&gt;[[Báb|Báb, The]] (1848). [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/trans/bayan/bayan.htm ''Persian Bayán''], Exordium.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="browne15"&gt;[[Edward Granville Browne|Browne, E.G.]] [https://www.h-net.org/~bahai/areprint/nk/n-q-p-5.pdf ''Kitab-i-Nuqtatu'l-Kaf''], p.&amp;nbsp;15&lt;/ref&gt; who manifests his will in an unending series of [[Theophany|theophanies]], called Manifestations of God (Arabic: {{Lang|ar|ظهور الله}}). It is an extremely small religion, with no more than a few thousand adherents according to current estimates, most of which are concentrated in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Azali | encyclopedia = Britannica Concise Encyclopedia | volume = 2006 | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica | url = http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9356264/Azali | accessdate = 26 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barret (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;246&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=Azali Babism | first = Dennis | last = MacEoin | url = http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v3f2/v3f2a070.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Báb|‘Ali Muhammad Shirazi]] who first assumed the title of [[Bab (gateway)|Báb]] ({{abbr|lit.|literally}}&amp;nbsp;"Gate") from which the religion gets its name, out of the belief that he was the gate to the [[Twelfth Imam]].&lt;ref name="saiedi19"&gt;{{cite book | title = Gate of the Heart | first = Nader | last = Saiedi | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | location = Waterloo, ON |page=19 | isbn = 978-1-55458-035-4 | year = 2008 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=XTfoaK15t64C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+the+Writings+of+the+B%C3%A1b&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However throughout his ministry his titles and claims underwent much evolution as the Báb progressively outlined his teachings.&lt;ref name="evlambden"&gt;Lambden, Stephen. [http://hurqalya.ucmerced.edu/node/2971 The Evolving Clains and Titles of Mirza `Ali Muhammad Shirazi, the Bab (1819–1850 CE)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1844, Bábism flourished in [[Persian Empire|Persia]] until 1852, then lingered on in exile in the [[Ottoman Empire]], especially [[Cyprus]], as well as underground. An anomaly amongst Islamic messianic movements, the Bábí movement signaled a break with Islam, beginning a new religious system with its own unique laws, teachings, and practices. While Bábism was violently opposed by both clerical and government establishments, it led to the founding of the Bahá'í Faith, whose followers consider the religion founded by the Báb as a predecessor to their own.

====  Samaritanism ====
Samaritanism is based on some of the same books used as the basis of Judaism but differs from the latter. Samaritan religious works include the [[Samaritan Pentateuch|Samaritan version of the Torah]], the Memar Markah, the Samaritan liturgy, and Samaritan law codes and biblical commentaries. Many{{who|date=April 2017}} claim the Samaritans appear to have a text of the Torah as old as the [[Masoretic Text]]; scholars have various theories concerning the actual relationships between these three texts.

====  Yazdânism (the Yezidi, Yarsani and Alevi faiths) ====
Yazdânism, or the Cult of Angels, is a proposed pre-Islamic, [[native religion]] of the [[Kurds#religion|Kurds]]. The term was introduced by Kurdish scholar [[Mehrdad Izady]] to represent what he considers the "original" religion of the Kurds&lt;ref name="Foltz 219"&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Foltz |chapter=Two Kurdish Sects: The Yezidis and the Yaresan |title=Religions of Iran: From Prehistory to the Present |isbn=978-1-78074-307-3 |chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/9387407 |page=219 |registration=yes|date=2013-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the primary inhabitants of the [[Zagros Mountains]], until their increasing [[Islamization]] in the course of the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.krd/a/d.aspxr=61&amp;l=12&amp;a=40&amp;s=&amp;s=010000|title=Kurdish History and Culture|last=Izady|first=M. R.|date=December 2004|website=Kurdistan Regional Government|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Izady, Yazdânism is now continued in the denominations of Yazidism, Yarsanism, and Alevism.&lt;ref&gt;Izady, 1992. pp.&amp;nbsp;170 passim&lt;/ref&gt; The three traditions subsumed under the term Yazdânism are primarily practiced in relatively isolated communities, from [[Khorasan Province|Khurasan]] to [[Anatolia]] and parts of western Iran.

The concept of Yazdânism has found a wide perception both within and beyond [[Kurdish nationalism|Kurdish nationalist]] discourses, but has been disputed by other recognized scholars of [[Iranian religions]]. Well established, however, are the "striking" and "unmistakable" similarities between the [[Yazidis]] and the Yaresan or ''Ahl-e Haqq'',{{sfn|Kreyenbroek|1995|pages=54; 59}} some of which can be traced back to elements of an ancient faith that was probably dominant among [[Western Iranian languages|Western Iranians]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Foltz|first1=Richard|title=Two Kurdish Sects: The Yezidis and the Yaresan|pages=219|url=https://www.academia.edu/9387407|access-date=7 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204071202/http://www.academia.edu/9387407/Religions_of_Iran_From_Prehistory_to_the_Present|archive-date=4 February 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and likened to practices of pre-Zoroastrian [[Mithra]]ic religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Foltz |chapter=Mithra and Mithraism |title=Religions of Iran: From Prehistory to the Present |isbn=978-1-78074-307-3 |chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/9387407 |page=30 |registration=yes|date=2013-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mehrdad Izady defines the Yazdanism as an ancient [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] religion and states that [[Mitanni]]s could have introduced some of the [[Vedic]] tradition that appears to be manifest in Yazdanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exploring Kurdish Origins|url=http://www.kurdistanica.com/?q=node/74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====  Shabakism  ====
[[Shabakism]] is the name given to the beliefs and practices of the [[Shabak people]] of [[Kurdistan region]] and around [[Mosul]] in [[Iraq]]. A majority of Shabaks regard themselves as Shia, and a minority identify as [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]].&lt;ref name="aina"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20140721084628.htm|title=Iraq: The Minorities of the Nineveh Plain|author=Mina al-Lami|date=21 August 2014|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niqash.org/en/articles/society/2219/|title=The Shabak Search for Identity|first=Adel|last=Kamal|website=Niqash.org|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-28351073|title=Iraq: The minorities of Nineveh|first=Mina|last=al-Lami|date=21 July 2014|accessdate=1 August 2018|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nonprofitquarterly.org/2016/07/07/iraqs-religious-ethnic-minorities-disappearing-due-isis-violence-global-inaction/|title=Iraq's Religious, Ethnic Minorities Disappearing Due to ISIS Violence and Global Inaction - Non Profit News - Nonprofit Quarterly|website=nonprofitquarterly.org|accessdate=1 August 2018|date=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, their actual faith and rituals differ from Islam, and have characteristics that make them distinct from neighboring [[Muslim]] populations. These include features from Christianity including [[Confession (religion)|confession]], and the consumption of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], and the fact that Shabaks often go on pilgrimage to [[Yazidi]] shrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/shabak.religion.htm|title=Shabak / Religion – LookLex Encyclopaedia|first=Tore|last=Kjeilen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the Shabak people also go on pilgrimages to Shia holy cities such as [[Najaf]] and [[Karbala]], and follow many Shiite teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Imranali Panjwani|title=Shi'a of Samarra: The Heritage and Politics of a Community in Iraq|page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization of Shabakism appears to be much like that of a [[Sufi order]]: adult laymen ([[Murid]]s) are bound to spiritual guides ([[Pir (Sufism)|pîrs]] or [[Murshid]]s) who are knowledgeable in matters of religious doctrine and ritual. There are several ranks of such pîrs; at the top stands the Baba, or supreme head of the order. Theoretically individuals can choose their own pîr, but in practice the pir families often become associated with lay families over several generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurdishacademy.org/?q=node/133|title=The Shabak and the Kakais - Kurdish Academy of Language|website=Kurdishacademy.org|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shabakism combines elements of [[Sufism]] with the uniquely Shabak interpretation of "divine reality." According to Shabaks, this divine reality supersedes the literal, or [[Shar'ia]], interpretation of the [[Quran]]. Shabaks comprehend divine reality through the mediation of the "Pir" or spiritual guide, who also performs Shabak rituals.&lt;ref name="AVino"&gt;A. Vinogradov, "Ethnicity, Cultural Discontinuity and Power Brokers in Northern Iraq: The Case of the Shabak", ''American Ethnologist'', pp.&amp;nbsp;214–215, [[American Anthropological Association]], 1974. {{doi|10.1525/ae.1974.1.1.02a00110}}. {{JSTOR|643810}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The structure of these mediatory relationships closely resembles that of the Yarsan.&lt;ref name=KaW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kurdishacademy.org/?q=node%2F133|title=The Shabak and the Kakais|first=Michiel|last=Leezenberg|accessdate=2 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412221746/http://kurdishacademy.org/?q=node%2F133|archivedate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary Shabak religious text is the [[Buyruk (Shabak)|Buyruk]] or ''Kitab al-Managib'' (Book of Exemplary Acts) and is written in [[Iraqi Turkmens#Language|Turkoman]].&lt;ref name=KaW/&gt;&lt;ref name=vIk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aina.org/news/20050816114539.htm|title=Kurdish Gunmen Open Fire on Demonstrators in North Iraq|date=16 August 2005|accessdate=7 October 2014|author=Assyrian News Agency|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224028/http://www.aina.org/news/20050816114539.htm|archivedate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shabaks also consider the poetry of [[Ismail I]] to be revealed by God, and they recite Ismail's poetry during religious meetings.&lt;ref name="AVino" /&gt;

====  Mandeanism ====
[[Mandaeism]] or Mandaeanism ({{lang-ar|مندائية}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Mandāʼīyah}}'') is a [[Gnosticism|gnostic]] religion&lt;ref name="Mandaens"&gt;{{citation|last=Buckley|first=Jorunn Jacobsen|title=The Mandaeans: ancient texts and modern people|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195153859|url=http://mandaeannetwork.com/Mandaean/books/english/2The_Mandaeans_Ancient_Texts_and_Modern_People_American_Academy_of_Religion_Books_Jorunn_Jacobsen_Buckley.pdf?bcsi_scan_955b0cd764557e80=0&amp;bcsi_scan_filename=2The_Mandaeans_Ancient_Texts_and_Modern_People_American_Academy_of_Religion_Books_Jorunn_Jacobsen_Buckley.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4}} with a strongly [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] worldview. Its adherents, the [[Mandaeans]], revere [[Adam]], [[Cain and Abel|Abel]], [[Seth]], [[Enos (biblical figure)|Enos]], [[Noah]], [[Shem]], [[Aram, son of Shem|Aram]], and especially [[John the Baptist]]. Abraham, however, is considered a false prophet in Mandeanism.&lt;ref&gt;Lupieri, Edmondo. (Charles Hindley, trans.) 2002. ''The Mandaeans: The Last Gnostics'', p.166. Grand Rapids, MI: Wm. B.

==== Druze faith ====
The Druze faith is a [[monotheistic]] and [[Abrahamic religion]] based on the teachings of high Islamic figures like [[Hamza ibn-'Ali ibn-Ahmad]] and [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], and Greek [[philosophy|philosophers]] such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref name="Entrepreneurship and Religion"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Léo-Paul Dana|title=Entrepreneurship and Religion|date=1 January 2010|publisher=[[Edward Elgar Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-84980-632-9|page=314}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 January 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Adams Media"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Terri Morrison|author2=Wayne A.

The Druze Faith is often classified as a branch of Isma'ili Shia Islam.

====  Rastafari====
Rastafari, sometimes termed Rastafarianism, is an [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] [[religion]]. Classified as both a [[new religious movement]] and [[social movement]], it developed in [[Jamaica]] during the 1930s. It lacks any centralised authority and there is much heterogeneity among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.

Rastafari refer to their beliefs, which are based on a specific interpretation of the [[Bible]], as "Rastalogy". Central is a [[monotheistic]] belief in a single God—referred to as [[Jah]]—who partially resides within each individual. The former emperor of Ethiopia, [[Haile Selassie]], is given central importance. Many Rastas regard him as an incarnation of Jah on Earth and as the [[Second Coming of Christ]].  Others regard him as a human prophet who fully recognised the inner divinity within every individual. Rastafari is [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] and focuses its attention on the [[African diaspora]], which it believes is oppressed within Western society, or "Babylon". Many Rastas call for the resettlement of the African diaspora in either Ethiopia or Africa more widely, referring to this continent as the [[Promised Land]] of "Zion". Other interpretations shift focus on to the adoption of an Afrocentric attitude while living outside of Africa. Rastas refer to their practices as "livity". Communal meetings are known as "groundations", and are typified by music, chanting, discussions, and the [[Entheogenic use of cannabis|smoking of cannabis]], the latter being regarded as a [[sacrament]] with beneficial properties. Rastas place emphasis on what they regard as living 'naturally', adhering to [[ital]] dietary requirements, allowing their hair to form into [[dreadlocks]], and following [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] gender roles.

Rastafari originated among impoverished and socially disenfranchised [[Afro-Jamaican]] communities in 1930s Jamaica. Its Afrocentric ideology was largely a reaction against Jamaica's then-dominant [[Colony of Jamaica|British colonial culture]]. It was influenced by both [[Ethiopian movement|Ethiopianism]] and the [[Back-to-Africa movement]] promoted by [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] figures like [[Marcus Garvey]]. The movement developed after several Christian clergymen, most notably [[Leonard Howell]], proclaimed that the crowning of Haile Selassie as Emperor of Ethiopia in 1930 fulfilled a Biblical prophecy. By the 1950s, Rastafari's [[counter-culture|counter-cultural]] stance had brought the movement into conflict with wider Jamaican society, including violent clashes with law enforcement. In the 1960s and 1970s it gained increased respectability within Jamaica and greater visibility abroad through the popularity of Rasta-inspired [[reggae]] musicians like [[Bob Marley]]. Enthusiasm for Rastafari declined in the 1980s, following the deaths of Haile Selassie and Marley.

The Rasta movement is organised on a largely cellular basis. There are several denominations, or "[[Mansions of Rastafari]]", the most prominent of which are the [[Nyahbinghi]], [[Bobo Ashanti]], [[Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church]], and the [[Twelve Tribes of Israel (Rastafari)|Twelve Tribes of Israel]], each of which offers different interpretations of Rasta belief. There are an estimated 700,000 to 1 million Rastas across the world; the largest population is in Jamaica although communities can be found in most of the world's major population centres.

== Origins and history ==
{{See also|Ancient Canaanite religion|Yahweh|Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia}}
The civilizations that developed in [[Mesopotamia]] influenced some religious texts, particularly the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Book of Genesis]] in particular; Abraham is said to have originated in Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bertman|first1=Stephen|title=Handbook to life in ancient Mesopotamia|date=2005|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0195183641|page=312|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judaism regards itself as the religion of the descendants of Jacob,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Jacob is also called Israel, a name the [[Bible]] states he was given by God.&lt;/ref&gt; a grandson of Abraham. It has a [[God in Judaism|strictly unitary]] view of God, and the central holy book for almost all branches is the [[Masoretic Text]] as elucidated in the [[Oral Torah]]. In the 19th century and 20th centuries Judaism developed a small number of branches, of which the most significant are [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]], and [[Reform Judaism|Reform]].

Christianity began as a [[Jewish Christian|sect of Judaism]]&lt;ref group="n"&gt;cf. [[Judaizer]], [[Messianic Judaism]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Mediterranean Basin]]&lt;ref group="n"&gt;With several centers, such as [[Early centers of Christianity#Rome|Rome]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Alexandria|Alexandria]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Greece|Thessaloniki and Corinth]], [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Antioch]], and later spread outwards, eventually having two main centers in the empire, one for the [[Western Church]] and one for the [[Eastern Church]] in Rome and [[Constantinople]] respectively by the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century CE]]&lt;/ref&gt; of the first century [[Common Era|CE]] and [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|evolved into a separate religion]]—Christianity—with distinctive beliefs and practices. [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] is the central figure of Christianity, considered by almost all denominations to be [[God the Son]], one [[Hypostasis (philosophy and religion)|person]] of the [[Trinity]]. See [[God in Christianity]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;[[Trinity|Triune God]] is also called the "Holy Trinity"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian biblical canons]] are usually held to be the ultimate authority, alongside [[sacred tradition]] in some [[Christian denomination|denominations]] (such as the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]). Over many centuries, Christianity divided into three main branches (Orthodox, Catholic, and [[Protestantism|Protestant]]), [[List of Christian denominations|dozens of significant denominations]], and hundreds of smaller ones.

Islam arose in the [[Arabian Peninsula]]&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Islam arose specifically in [[Tihamah]] city of [[Mecca]] and [[Hejaz]] city of [[Medina]] of Arabia&lt;/ref&gt; in the 7th century CE with a [[God in Islam|strictly unitary view of God]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;The monotheistic view of God in Islam is called ''[[tawhid]]'' which is essentially the same as the conception of God in Judaism&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muslim]]s hold the Quran to be the ultimate authority, as revealed and elucidated through the [[Sunnah|teachings and practices]]&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Teachings and practices of Muhammad are collectively known as the ''[[sunnah]]'', similar to the [[Halakha|Judaic concepts of oral law]] and [[exegesis]], or ''[[talmud]]'' and ''[[midrash]]''&lt;/ref&gt; of a central, but not divine prophet, [[Muhammad]]. The Islamic faith considers all [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|prophets and messengers]] from [[Adam]] through the final messenger (Muhammad) to carry the same Islamic monotheistic principles. Soon after its founding, Islam split into two main branches (Sunni and Shia Islam), each of which now has a number of denominations.

The Bahá'í Faith began within the context of Shia Islam in 19th-century Persia, after a merchant named [[Báb|Siyyid `Alí Muḥammad Shírází]] claimed divine revelation and took on the title of the Báb, or "the Gate". The Bab's ministry proclaimed the imminent advent of "[[He whom God shall make manifest]]", who Bahá'í's accept as [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. Bahá'í's revere the Torah, Gospels and the Quran, and the writings of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh, and `Abdu’l-Bahá' are considered the central texts of the faith. A vast majority of adherents are unified under a single denomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Bahá'í Faith – The website of the worldwide Bahá'í community |url=http://www.bahai.org |website=Bahai.org |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesser-known Abrahamic religions, originally offshoots of Shia Islam, include Bábism&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Historically, the Bahá'í Faith arose in 19th-century Persia, in the context of Shia Islam, and thus may be classed on this basis as a divergent strand of Islam, placing it in the Abrahamic tradition. However, the Bahá'í Faith considers itself an independent religious tradition, which arose from a Muslim context but also recognizes other traditions. The Bahá'í Faith may also be classed as a [[new religious movement]], due to its comparatively recent origin, or may be considered sufficiently old and established for such classification to not be applicable.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Druze faith.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite news |last=Dolbee |first=Sandi |title=Faith, Hope and Understand: Teenagers Questions and learn about each other's Faiths |newspaper=The San Diego Union–Tribune |page=E.1 |date=27 March 2003 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/319404861.html?dids=319404861:319404861&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+27%2C+2003&amp;author=Sandi+Dolbee&amp;pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=E.1&amp;desc=FAITH%2C+HOPE+AND+UNDERSTAND+%7C+TEENAGERS+QUESTIONS+AND+LEARN+ABOUT+EACH+OTHER%27S+FAITHS |accessdate=3 March 2012}}

== Common aspects ==
The unifying characteristic of Abrahamic religions is that all accept the tradition that [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] revealed himself to the patriarch Abraham.&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt; All are monotheistic, and conceive God to be a [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] [[Creator deity|creator]] and the source of [[Morality|moral law]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |year=2002 |title=Religion: Three Religions – One God |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/globalconnections/mideast/themes/religion/index.html |work=Global Connections of the Middle East |publisher=[[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] Educational Foundation |accessdate=20 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [[religious texts]] feature many of the same figures, histories, and places, although they often present them with different roles, perspectives, and meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kunst |first1=J.

In these four{{which?|date=October 2018}} Abrahamic religions the individual, God, and the universe are highly separate from each other. The Abrahamic religions believe in a judging, paternal, fully external god to which the individual and nature are subordinate. One seeks [[salvation]] or transcendence not by contemplating the natural world or via philosophical speculation, but by seeking to please God (such as obedience with God's wishes or his law) and see [[divine revelation]] as outside of self, nature, and custom.

=== Monotheism ===
{{Main article|Monotheism}}
All Abrahamic religions claim to be monotheistic, worshiping an exclusive God, although one known by different names.&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{Cite book |last= Peters |first= Francis E. |authorlink= Francis E.

Since the conception of a divine Trinity is not amenable to ''[[tawhid]]'', the Islamic doctrine of monotheism, Islam regards Christianity as variously [[polytheism|polytheistic]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/grebel/sites/ca.grebel/files/uploads/files/IslamicMonotheismandtheTrinity.pdf|title=Islamic Monotheism and the Trinity|last=Hoover|first=Jon|date=|website=University of Waterloo|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Christianity, Islam, and the Bahá'í Faith each revere Jesus ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: ''[[Jesus in Islam|Isa]]'' or ''Yasu'' among Muslims and [[Arab Christians]] respectively) but with vastly differing conceptions:
* Christians view Jesus as the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|saviour]] (and most Christians also regard him as [[Incarnation|God incarnate]]).
* Muslims see Isa as a [[Prophet of Islam]]&lt;ref name="EoQP"&gt;Uri Rubin, ''Prophets and Prophethood'', ''[[Encyclopaedia of the Qur'an]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and Messiah.
* Bahá'í's rank Jesus as the Messiah and as a [[Manifestation of God]] (not as God incarnate, but as the presence of God).&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the worship of Jesus, or the ascribing of partners to God (known as ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'' in Islam and as ''[[shituf]]'' in Judaism), is typically viewed as the [[heresy]] of [[idolatry]] by Islam and Judaism and as misguided by the Bahá'ís. Judaism, Islam, and the Bahá'í Faith also see the incarnation of God into human form as a heresy.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Theological continuity ===
{{See also|Messianism}}
All the Abrahamic religions affirm one eternal God who created the universe, who rules history, who sends [[prophecy|prophetic]] and angelic messengers and who reveals the [[divine law|divine will]] through inspired [[revelation]]. They also affirm that obedience to this [[creator deity]] is to be lived out historically and that one day God will unilaterally intervene in human history at the [[Last Judgment]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Scripture ===
{{See also|Development of the Hebrew Bible canon|Development of the Christian biblical canon|History of the Quran}}
All Abrahamic religions believe that God guides humanity through [[revelation]] to prophets, and each religion recognizes that God revealed teachings up to and including those in their own scripture.

=== Ethical orientation ===
{{See also|Ethical monotheism}}
An [[Ethics|ethical]] orientation: all these religions speak of a choice between good and evil, which is associated with obedience or disobedience to a single God and to [[Divine Law]].

=== Eschatological world view ===
An [[eschatology|eschatological]] world view of history and destiny, beginning with the [[Creation myth|creation]] of the world and the concept that God works through history, and ending with a [[resurrection of the dead]] and [[Last Judgment|final judgment]] and [[world to come]].&lt;ref&gt;Wiener, Philip P.

=== Importance of Jerusalem ===
{{See also|Jerusalem in Judaism|Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem in Islam}}
Jerusalem is considered Judaism's holiest city.

Jews thrice daily pray in its direction, including in their prayers pleas for the restoration and the rebuilding of the [[Holy Temple]] (the [[Third Temple]]) on mount Moriah, close the Passover service with the wistful statement "Next year in built Jerusalem," and recall the city in the blessing at the end of each meal. Jerusalem has served as the only capital for the five Jewish states that have existed in Israel since 1400 BCE (the [[United Kingdom of Israel]], the [[Kingdom of Judah]], [[Yehud Medinata]], the [[Hasmonean Kingdom]], and modern Israel). It has been majority Jewish since about 1852 and continues through today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Morgenstern |first=Arie |author2=Translated by Joel A.

[[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem was an early center of Christianity]]. There has been a continuous Christian presence there since.&lt;ref name=Wilken&gt;Wilken, Robert L. "From Time Immemorial? Dwellers in the Holy Land." ''Christian Century'', 30 July – 6 August 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;678.&lt;/ref&gt; William R. Kenan, Jr., professor of the history of Christianity at the [[University of Virginia]], Charlottesville, writes that from the middle of the 4th century to the [[Islamic conquests|Islamic conquest]] in the middle of the 7th century, the [[Syria Palaestina|Roman province of Palestine]] was a Christian nation with Jerusalem its principal city.&lt;ref name=Wilken/&gt; According to the [[New Testament]], Jerusalem was the city Jesus was brought to as a child to be presented at the temple{{Bibleref2c|Luke|2:22}} and for the feast of the [[Passover]].{{Bibleref2c|Luke|2:41}} He preached and healed in Jerusalem, unceremoniously drove the [[Jesus and the money changers|money changers]] in disarray from the temple there, held the [[Last Supper]] in an "upper room" (traditionally the [[Cenacle]]) there the night before he is said to have died on the cross, was arrested in [[Gethsemane]]. The six parts to Jesus' trial—three stages in a religious court and three stages before a Roman court—were all held in Jerusalem. His [[crucifixion]] at [[Calvary|Golgotha]], his burial nearby (traditionally the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]), and his resurrection and ascension and [[Second Coming|prophecy to return]] all are said to have occurred or will occur there.

Jerusalem became holy to Muslims, third after [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]. The [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]], which translates to "farthest mosque" in [[sura]] [[Al-Isra]] in the Quran and its surroundings are addressed in the Quran as "the holy land". Muslim tradition as recorded in the [[ahadith]] identifies al-Aqsa with a mosque in Jerusalem. The first Muslims did not pray toward [[Kaaba]], but toward Jerusalem (this was the ''[[qibla]]'' for 13 years): the qibla was switched to Kaaba later on to fulfill the order of Allah of praying in the direction of Kaaba (Quran, Al-Baqarah 2:144–150). Another reason for its significance is its connection with the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Miʿrāj]],&lt;ref name="Miraj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/384897/Miraj,|title=Mi'raj – Islam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where, according to traditional Muslim, Muhammad ascended through the [[Seven heavens]] on a winged mule named [[Buraq]], guided by the [[Archangel Gabriel]], beginning from the [[Foundation Stone]] on the [[Temple Mount]], in modern times under the [[Dome of the Rock]].&lt;ref name="Britannica_J"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/302812/Jerusalem "Jerusalem (Britannica)"], ''Jerusalem(Britannica)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AlAqsa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/30995/Al-Aqsa-Mosque|title=Al-Aqsa Mosque – mosque, Jerusalem|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Significance of Abraham ===
{{Main article|Covenant of the pieces|Abraham#Christianity|Abraham in Islam}}

Even though members of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam do not all claim Abraham as an ancestor, some members of these religions have tried to claim him as exclusively theirs.&lt;ref name="Lubar"&gt;{{cite web |title=Why 'Abrahamic'? |publisher=Lubar Institute for Religious Studies at [[University of Wisconsin - Madison]] |year=2007 |url=http://lisar.lss.wisc.edu/welcome/Why%20Abrahamic.html |accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Jews]], Abraham is the founding [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarch]] of the children of Israel. God promised Abraham: "I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you."{{Bibleref2c|Gen.|12:2}} With Abraham, God entered into "an everlasting covenant throughout the ages to be God to you and to your offspring to come".{{Bibleref2c|Gen.|17:7}} It is this covenant that makes Abraham and his descendants children of the covenant. Similarly, converts, who join the covenant, are all identified as sons and daughters of Abraham.{{Citation needed|date = April 2018}}

Abraham is primarily a revered ancestor or [[patriarch]] (referred to as ''Avraham Avinu'' (אברהם אבינו in [[Hebrew]]) "Abraham our father") to whom God made several promises: chiefly, that he would have numberless descendants, who would receive the land of Canaan (the "[[Promised Land]]"). According to Jewish tradition, Abraham was the first post-[[Genesis flood narrative|Flood]] prophet to reject [[idolatry]] through rational analysis, although [[Shem]] and [[Eber]] carried on the tradition from [[Noah]].&lt;ref&gt;Shultz, Joseph P.

[[Abraham#Christianity|Christians view Abraham]] as an important exemplar of [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], and a spiritual, as well as physical, ancestor of Jesus. For Christians, Abraham is a spiritual forebear as well as/rather than a direct ancestor depending on the [[Paul the Apostle and Judaism|individual's interpretation of Paul the Apostle]],{{bibleref2c|Rom.|4:9–12}} with the [[Abrahamic covenant]] "reinterpreted so as to be defined by faith in Christ rather than biological descent" or both by faith as well as a direct ancestor; in any case, the emphasis is placed on faith being the only requirement for the Abrahamic Covenant to apply&lt;ref&gt;Blasi, Turcotte, Duhaime, p.&amp;nbsp;592.&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[New Covenant]] and [[supersessionism]]). In Christian belief, Abraham is a [[role model]] of faith,{{bibleref2c|Heb.|11:8–10}}{{primary source inline|date=August 2017}} and his obedience to God by [[Binding of Isaac|offering Isaac]] is seen as a [[foreshadowing]] of God's offering of his son Jesus.{{bibleref2c|Rom.|8:32}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = MacArthur | first = John | authorlink = John F.

Christian commentators have a tendency to interpret God's promises to Abraham as applying to Christianity subsequent to, and sometimes rather than (as in supersessionism), being applied to Judaism, whose adherents [[Rejection of Jesus|rejected Jesus]]. They argue this on the basis that just as Abraham as a [[Gentile]] (before he was [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]]) "believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness" {{bibleref2c|Gen.|15:6}} (cf. Rom. 4:3, James 2:23), "those who have faith are children of Abraham" {{bibleref2c|Gal.|3:7}} (see also John 8:39).  This is most fully developed in [[Pauline Christianity|Paul's theology]] where all who believe in God are spiritual descendants of Abraham.{{bibleref2c|Rom.|4:20}} {{bibleref2c|Gal.|4:9}}&lt;ref&gt;"So those who have faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith."  "In other words, it is not the children by physical descent who are God's children, but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as Abraham's offspring." (Rom. 9:8)&lt;/ref&gt; However, with regards to {{Biblesource|Rom.|4:20}} and {{Biblesource|Gal.|4:9}}, in both cases he refers to these spiritual descendants as the "[[sons of God]]"{{bibleref2c|Gal.|4:26}} rather than "children of Abraham".&lt;ref&gt;Bickerman, p.&amp;nbsp;188cf.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Muslims, Abraham is a [[Prophet of Islam|prophet]], the "[[apostle (Islam)|messenger]] of God" who stands in the line from Adam to Muhammad, to whom God gave revelations,{{Cite quran|4|163}}, who "raised the foundations of the House" (i.e., the [[Kaaba]]){{Cite quran|2|127}} with his first son, [[Isma'il]], a symbol of which is every mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Leeming | first = David Adams | title = The Oxford companion to world mythology | publisher = Oxford University Press |year = 2005 | location = US | page = 209 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=kQFtlva3HaYC&amp;lpg=PA209&amp;pg=PA209#v=onepage&amp;q| isbn = 978-0-19-515669-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim ([[Abraham]]) is the first in a [[genealogy]] for Muhammad.

Also, the same as Judaism, Islam believes that Abraham rejected idolatry through logical reasoning. Abraham is also recalled in certain details of the annual [[Hajj]] pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Hawting | first = Gerald R.  | title = The development of Islamic ritual; Volume 26 of The formation of the classical Islamic world | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | year = 2006 | pages = xviii, xix, xx, xxiii | url = https://books.google.com/?id=oCvf76uT3wMC&amp;lpg=PR18&amp;pg=PR18#v=onepage&amp;q | isbn = 978-0-86078-712-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Differences ==

=== God ===
{{Main article|God in Abrahamic religions|God in Judaism|God in Christianity|God in Islam|Yahweh|Tetragrammaton|El (deity)}}
The Abrahamic God is conceived of as [[Eternity#God and eternity|eternal]], [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]] and as the [[Creator deity|creator of the universe]]. God is further held to have the properties of holiness, justice, [[omnibenevolence]] and [[omnipresence]]. Proponents of Abrahamic faiths believe that God is also [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], but at the same time [[personal God|personal]] and involved, listening to [[prayer]] and reacting to the actions of his creatures.

[[File:JudaismSymbol.PNG|thumb|right|The [[Star of David]] (or ''Magen David''), is a generally recognized symbol of modern Jewish identity and Judaism.]]
In [[Jewish theology]], God is strictly [[monotheistic]]. God is an absolute one, indivisible and incomparable [[being]] who is the ultimate cause of all existence. Jewish tradition teaches that the true aspect of God is incomprehensible and unknowable and that it is only God's revealed aspect that brought the universe into existence, and interacts with mankind and the world. In Judaism, the one God of Israel is the God of [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]], who is the guide of the world, delivered [[Israelites|Israel]] from [[The Exodus|slavery in Egypt]], and gave them the [[613 Mitzvot]] at [[Mount Sinai]] as described in the [[Torah]].

The [[national god]] of the [[Israelite]]s has a [[Theonym|proper name]], written [[YHWH]] ({{Hebrew name|יְהֹוָה|Yehovah|Yəhōwāh}}) in the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]]. The name YHWH is a combination of the future, present, and past tense of the verb "howa" ({{lang-he|הוה}}) meaning "to be" and translated literally means "The self-existent One". A further explanation of the name was given to Moses when YHWH stated ''Eheye Asher Eheye'' ({{lang-he|אהיה אשר אהיה}}) "I will be that I will be", the name relates to God as God truly is, God's revealed essence, which transcends the universe. It also represents God's compassion towards the world. In Jewish tradition another name of God is [[Elohim]], relating to the interaction between God and the universe, God as manifest in the physical world, it designates the justice of God, and means "the One who is the totality of powers, forces and causes in the universe".

[[File:Christianity Symbol.png|thumb|right|The [[Christian cross]] (or crux) is the best-known religious symbol of Christianity; this version is known as a Latin Cross.]]
In [[Christian theology]], God is the [[Eternity#God and eternity|eternal being]] who [[Genesis creation narrative|created]] and [[Divine providence|preserves]] the world. Christians believe God to be both transcendent and [[immanent]] (involved in the world).&lt;ref name=Leith55&gt;''Basic Christian Doctrine'' by John H.

Around the year 200, [[Tertullian]] formulated a version of the doctrine of the [[Trinity]] which clearly affirmed the divinity of Jesus and came close to the later definitive form produced by the [[First Council of Constantinople|Ecumenical Council of 381]].&lt;ref name=Prestige29&gt;Prestige G.L.

The theology of the [[Attributes of God in Christianity|attributes and nature of God]] has been discussed since the earliest days of Christianity, with [[Irenaeus]] writing in the 2nd century: "His greatness lacks nothing, but contains all things".&lt;ref name=Irena27&gt;''Irenaeus of Lyons'' by Eric Francis Osborn (26 November 2001) {{ISBN|0521800064}} pages 27–29&lt;/ref&gt; In the 8th century, [[John of Damascus]] listed eighteen attributes which remain widely accepted.&lt;ref name=Globe352&gt;''Global Dictionary of Theology'' by William A.

[[File:IslamSymbolAllahComp.PNG|thumb|right|The word [[God]] written in [[Arabic]].]]
In [[Islamic theology]], God ({{lang-ar|{{large|الله}}}} ''[[Allāh|{{transl|ar|ALA|Allāh}}]]'') is the [[Omnipotence|all-powerful]] and [[Omniscience|all-knowing]] creator, sustainer, ordainer and judge of everything in existence.&lt;ref name="EoQ-Quran"&gt;Gerhard Böwering ''God and his Attributes'', [[Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān]] Quran.com, ''Islam: The Straight Path'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;22&lt;/ref&gt; Islam emphasizes that God is strictly singular (''[[tawhid|{{transl|ar|ALA|tawḥīd}}]]'')&lt;ref&gt;John L. Esposito, ''Islam: The Straight Path'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;88&lt;/ref&gt; unique (''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāḥid}}'') and inherently One (''{{transl|ar|ALA|aḥad}}''), all-merciful and omnipotent.&lt;ref name="Britannica_A"&gt;"Allah". [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; According to Islamic teachings, God exists without place&lt;ref name="Britannica p3"&gt;Britannica Encyclopedia, "Islam", p.&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the Quran, "No vision can grasp him, but His grasp is over all vision: He is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|6|103|style=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; God, as referenced in the Quran, is the only God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|29|46|style=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters1"&gt;F. E. Peters, ''Islam'', p.&amp;nbsp;4, Princeton University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic tradition also describes the [[Names of God in the Qur'an|99 names of God]]. These 99 names describe attributes of God, including Most Merciful, The Just, The Peace and Blessing, and the Guardian.

Islamic belief in God is distinct from Christianity in that God has no progeny. This belief is summed up in [[Sura|chapter]] 112 of the Quran titled [[Al-Ikhlas]], which states "Say, he is Allah (who is) one, Allah is the Eternal, the Absolute. He does not beget nor was he begotten. Nor is there to Him any equivalent".{{cite quran|112|1|4}}

=== Scriptures ===
{{Main article|Tanakh|Bible|Old Testament|New Testament|Quran|Hadith}}
All these religions rely on a body of scriptures, some of which are considered to be the word of God—hence sacred and unquestionable—and some the work of religious men, revered mainly by tradition and to the extent that they are considered to have been divinely inspired, if not dictated, by the divine being.

The sacred scriptures of Judaism are the [[Hebrew Bible|Tanakh]], a Hebrew acronym standing for ''[[Torah]]'' (Law or Teachings), ''[[Nevi'im]]'' (Prophets) and ''[[Ketuvim]]'' (Writings). These are complemented by and supplemented with various (originally oral) traditions: ''[[Midrash]]'', the ''[[Mishnah]]'', the ''[[Talmud]]'' and collected rabbinical writings. The Tanakh (or [[Hebrew Bible]]) was composed between 1,400 BCE, and 400 BCE by Jewish [[:Category:Jewish prophets|prophets]], kings, and [[Kohen|priests]].

The Hebrew text of the Tanakh, and the Torah in particular is considered holy, down to the last letter: transcribing is done with painstaking care. An error in a single letter, ornamentation or symbol of the 300,000+ stylized letters that make up the Hebrew Torah text renders a Torah scroll unfit for use; hence the skills of a Torah scribe are specialist skills, and a scroll takes considerable time to write and check.

[[File:Bible.malmesbury.arp.jpg|thumb|250px|A Bible handwritten in [[Latin]], on display in [[Malmesbury Abbey]], Wiltshire, England. This Bible was transcribed in Belgium in 1407 for reading aloud in a monastery.]]
The sacred scriptures of most Christian groups are the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]]. Latin Bibles originally contained 73 books; however, 7 books, collectively called the [[Apocrypha]] or [[Deuterocanon]] depending on one's opinion of them, were removed by [[Martin Luther]] due to a lack of original Hebrew sources, and now vary on their inclusion between denominations. Greek Bibles contain additional materials.

The New Testament comprises four accounts of the life and teachings of Jesus (the [[Four Gospels]]), as well as several other writings (the [[Epistle#New Testament epistles|epistles]]) and the [[Book of Revelation]]. They are usually considered to be [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]], and together comprise the [[Bible|Christian Bible]].

The vast majority of Christian faiths (including Catholicism, Orthodox Christianity, and most forms of Protestantism) recognize that the Gospels were passed on by oral tradition, and were not set to paper until decades after the resurrection of Jesus and that the extant versions are copies of those originals. The version of the Bible considered to be most valid (in the sense of best conveying the true meaning of the word of God) has varied considerably: the Greek [[Septuagint]], the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Peshitta]], the [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]], the English [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Version]] and the Russian Synodal Bible have been authoritative to different communities at different times.

The sacred scriptures of the Christian Bible are complemented by a large body of writings by individual Christians and councils of Christian leaders (see [[canon law]]). Some Christian churches and denominations consider certain additional writings to be binding; other Christian groups consider only the Bible to be binding ([[sola scriptura]]).

[[File:Quran rzabasi1.JPG|thumb|9th-century Quran in [[Reza Abbasi Museum]]]]
Islam's holiest book is the Quran, comprising 114 [[Sura]]s ("chapters of the Qur'an"). However, Muslims also believe in the religious texts of Judaism and Christianity in their original forms, albeit not the current versions. According to the Quran (and mainstream Muslim belief), the verses of the Quran were revealed by God through the Archangel [[Jibrail]] to Muhammad on separate occasions. These revelations were written down and also memorized by hundreds of companions of Muhammad. These multiple sources were collected into one official copy. After the death of Mohammed, Quran was copied on several copies and Caliph [[Uthman]] provided these copies to different cities of Islamic Empire.

The Quran mentions and reveres several of the Israelite prophets, including Moses and [[Jesus#Islamic views|Jesus]], among others (see also: [[Prophets of Islam]]). The stories of these prophets are very similar to those in the Bible. However, the detailed precepts of the Tanakh and the [[New Testament]] are not adopted outright; they are replaced by the new commandments accepted as revealed directly by God (through Gabriel) to Muhammad and codified in the Quran.

Like the Jews with the Torah, Muslims consider the original [[Arabic language|Arabic]] text of the Quran as uncorrupted and holy to the last letter, and any translations are considered to be interpretations of the meaning of the Quran, as only the original Arabic text is considered to be the divine scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = [[Mona Baker|Baker, Mona]] |author2= Saldanha, Gabriela | title = Routledge encyclopedia of translation studies | publisher = Routledge | year = 2008 | page = 227 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=eXsDckV5GuMC&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q | isbn = 978-0-415-36930-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Rabbinic [[Oral Law]] to the Hebrew Bible, the Quran is complemented by the ''[[Hadith]]'', a set of books by later authors recording the sayings of the prophet Muhammad. The Hadith interpret and elaborate Qur'anic precepts. Islamic scholars have categorized each Hadith at one of the following levels of authenticity or [[isnad]]: genuine (''sahih''), fair (''hasan'') or weak (''da'if'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = ʻUthmān ibn ʻAbd al-Raḥmān Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ al-Shahrazūrī |author2= Eerik Dickinson | title = An Introduction to the Science of Hadith: Kitab Ma'rifat Anwa' 'ilm Al-hadith | publisher = Garnet &amp; Ithaca Press | year = 2006 | page = 5 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Yq-aprUAyuUC&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q | isbn = 978-1-85964-158-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 9th century, [[six major Hadith collections]] were accepted as reliable to Sunni Muslims.
* [[Sahih al-Bukhari]]
* [[Sahih Muslim]]
* [[Sunan ibn Majah]]
* [[Sunan Abu Dawud]]
* [[Jami al-Tirmidhi]]
* [[Sunan an-Nasa'ii]]

Shia Muslims, however, refer to other authenticated hadiths instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Momen | first = Moojan | title = An introduction to Shiʻi Islam: the history and doctrines of Twelver Shiʻism| publisher = Yale University Press | year = 1985 | pages = 173–4 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=zot5IK1csp0C&amp;dq| isbn = 978-0-300-03531-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are known collectively as [[The Four Books]].

The Hadith and the life story of Muhammad ([[Sirah Rasul Allah|sira]]) form the [[Sunnah]], an authoritative supplement to the Quran. The legal opinions of Islamic jurists ([[Faqīh]]) provide another source for the daily practice and interpretation of Islamic tradition (see [[Fiqh]].)

The Quran contains repeated references to the "religion of Abraham" (see Suras 2:130,135; 3:95; 6:123,161; 12:38; 16:123; 22:78). In the Quran, this expression refers specifically to Islam; sometimes in contrast to Christianity and Judaism, as in Sura 2:135, for example: 'They say: "Become Jews or Christians if ye would be guided (to salvation)." Say thou (O Muslims): "Nay! (I would rather) the Religion of Abraham the True, and he joined not gods with God." ' In the Quran, Abraham is declared to have been a Muslim (a ''[[hanif]]'', more accurately a "[[fitra|primordial monotheist]]"), not a Jew nor a Christian (Sura 3:67).

=== Eschatology ===
{{Main article|Eschatology|Jewish eschatology|Christian eschatology|Islamic eschatology}}
In the major Abrahamic religions, there exists the expectation of an individual who will herald the [[Eschatology|time of the end]] or bring about the [[Kingdom of God]] on Earth; in other words, the [[Messianic prophecy]]. Judaism awaits the coming of the [[Jewish Messiah]]; the Jewish concept of Messiah differs from the Christian concept in several significant ways, despite the same term being applied to both. The Jewish Messiah is not seen as a "god", but as a mortal man who by his holiness is worthy of that description. His appearance is not the end of history, rather it signals the coming of the [[Jewish eschatology#Olam Haba|world to come]].

Christianity awaits the [[Second Coming]] of Christ, though [[Full Preterism|Full Preterists]] believe this has already happened. Islam awaits both the second coming of Jesus (to complete his life and die) and the coming of [[Mahdi]] (Sunnis in his first incarnation, Shia as the return of [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]]).

Most Abrahamic religions agree that a human being comprises the body, which dies, and the [[soul]], which is [[Immortality of the Soul|capable of remaining alive beyond human death]] and carries the person's essence, and that God will judge each person's life accordingly after death. The importance of this and the focus on it, as well as the precise criteria and end result, differ between religions.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Judaism's views on the afterlife ("the Next World") are quite diverse. This can be attributed to the fact that although there clearly are traditions in the [[Hebrew Bible]] of an afterlife (see [[Naboth]] and the [[Witch of Endor]]), Judaism focuses on this life and how to lead a holy life to please God, rather than future reward.

Christians have more diverse and definite teachings on the [[end times]] and what constitutes [[afterlife]]. Most Christian approaches either include different abodes for the dead ([[Heaven (Christianity)|Heaven]], [[Hell]], [[Limbo]], [[Purgatory]]) or [[universal reconciliation]] because all souls are made in the [[image of God]]. A small minority teach [[annihilationism]], the doctrine that those persons who are not reconciled to God simply cease to exist.

In Islam, God is said to be "Most Compassionate and Most Merciful" (Quran 1:2, as well as the start of all suras but one). However, God is also "Most Just"; Islam prescribes a literal [[Hell#Islam|Hell]] for those who disobey God and commit gross sin. Those who obey God and submit to God will be rewarded with their own place in Paradise. While sinners are punished with fire, there are also many other forms of punishment described, depending on the sin committed; Hell is divided into numerous levels.

Those who worship and remember God are promised eternal abode in a physical and spiritual Paradise. Heaven is divided into eight [[Jannah|levels]], with the highest level of Paradise being the reward of those who have been most virtuous, the prophets, and those killed while fighting for Allah (martyrs).

Upon repentance to God, many sins can be forgiven, on the condition they are not repeated, as God is supremely merciful. Additionally, those who believe in God, but have led sinful lives, may be punished for a time, and then eventually released into Paradise. If anyone dies in a state of [[Shirk (polytheism)|Shirk]] (i.e. associating God in any way, such as claiming that He is equal with anything or denying Him), this is not pardonable—he or she will stay forever in Hell.

Once a person is admitted to Paradise, this person will abide there for eternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=al-Misri|first=Ahmad ibn Naqib|title=Reliance of the Traveler (edited and translated by Nuh Ha Mim Keller)|publisher=Amana Publications|year=1994|pages=995–1002|isbn=978-0-915957-72-9|title-link=Nuh Ha Mim Keller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Worship and religious rites ===
{{Main article|Christian worship}}
Worship, ceremonies and religion-related customs differ substantially among the Abrahamic religions. Among the few similarities are a seven-day cycle in which one day is nominally reserved for worship, prayer or other religious activities—''[[Shabbat]]'', [[Christian Sabbath|Sabbath]], or ''[[jumu'ah]]''; this custom is related to the biblical story of Genesis, where God created the universe in six days and rested in the seventh.

[[Orthodox Judaism]] practice is guided by the interpretation of the [[Torah]] and the [[Talmud]]. Before the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], Jewish priests offered [[korban|sacrifices]] there two times daily; since then, the practice has been replaced, until the Temple is rebuilt, by Jewish men being required to pray three times daily, including the [[Cantillation|chanting]] of the [[Torah]], and facing in the direction of [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Temple Mount]]. Other practices include [[Brit milah|circumcision]], [[Kashrut|dietary laws]], [[Shabbat]], [[Passover Seder|Passover]], [[Torah study]], [[Tefillin]], [[Niddah|purity]] and [[613 Mitzvot|others]]. [[Conservative Judaism]], [[Reform Judaism]] and the [[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]] movement all move away, in different degrees, from the strict tradition of the law.

Jewish women's prayer obligations vary by [[Jewish religious movements|denomination]]; in contemporary Orthodox practice, women do not read from the [[Torah]] and are only required to say certain parts of these daily services.

All versions of Judaism share a common, specialized calendar, containing many festivals. The calendar is lunisolar, with lunar months and a solar year (an extra month is added every second or third year to allow the shorter lunar year to "catch up" to the solar year). All streams observe the same festivals, but some emphasize them differently. As is usual with its extensive law system, the Orthodox have the most complex manner of observing the festivals, while the Reform pay more attention to the simple symbolism of each one.

Christian worship varies from [[Christian denominations|denomination to denomination]]. Individual [[Prayer in Christianity|prayer]] is usually not ritualised, while group prayer may be ritual or non-ritual according to the occasion. During church services, some form of [[liturgy]] is frequently followed. Rituals are performed during [[sacraments]], which also vary from denomination to denomination and usually include [[Baptism]] and [[Eucharist|Communion]], and may also include [[Confirmation]], [[Confession (religion)|Confession]], [[Last Rites]] and [[Holy Orders]].

Catholic worship practice is governed by the [[Roman Missal]] and other documents. Individuals, churches and denominations place different emphasis on ritual—some denominations consider most ritual activity optional, see [[Adiaphora]], particularly since the [[Protestant Reformation]].

The followers of Islam (Muslims) are to observe the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]. The first pillar is the belief in the oneness of Allah, and in Muhammad as his final and most perfect prophet. The second is to pray five times daily ([[salat]]) towards the direction ([[qibla]]) of the [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]]. The third pillar is almsgiving ([[Zakah]]), a portion of one's wealth given to the poor or to other specified causes, which means the giving of a specific share of one's wealth and savings to persons or causes, as is commanded in the Quran and elucidated as to specific percentages for different kinds of income and wealth in the [[hadith]]. The normal share to be paid is two and a half percent of one's earnings: this increases if labour was not required, and increases further if only capital or possessions alone were required (i.e. proceeds from renting space), and increases to 50% on "unearned wealth" such as treasure-finding, and to 100% on wealth that is considered [[haram]], as part of attempting to make atonement for the sin, such as that gained through financial interest ([[riba]]).

[[Fasting]] ([[sawm]]) during the ninth month of the Muslim lunar calendar, [[Ramadan]], is the fourth pillar of Islam, to which all Muslims after the age of puberty in good health (as judged by a Muslim doctor to be able fast without incurring grave danger to health: even in seemingly obvious situations, a "competent and upright Muslim physician" is required to agree), that are not menstruating are bound to observe—missed days of the fast for any reason must be made up, unless there be a permanent illness, such as diabetes, that prevents a person from ever fasting. In such a case, restitution must be made by feeding one poor person for each day missed.

Finally, Muslims are also required, if physically able, to undertake a [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]] at least once in one's life: it is strongly recommended to do it as often as possible, preferably once a year. Only individuals whose financial position and health are severely insufficient are exempt from making Hajj (e.g. if making Hajj would put stress on one's financial situation, but would not end up in homelessness or starvation, it is still required). During this pilgrimage, the Muslims spend three to seven days in worship, performing several strictly defined rituals, most notably circumambulating the [[Kaaba]] among millions of other Muslims and the "[[stoning of the devil]]" at [[Mina, Saudi Arabia|Mina]].

At the end of the [[Hajj]], the heads of men are shaved, sheep and other [[halal]] animals, notably [[camel]]s, are slaughtered as a ritual sacrifice by bleeding out at the neck according to a strictly prescribed ritual slaughter method similar to the Jewish [[kashrut]], to commemorate the moment when, according to Islamic tradition, Allah replaced Abraham's son [[Ishmael]] (contrasted with the [[Judaeo-Christian]] tradition that [[Isaac]] was the intended sacrifice) with a sheep, thereby preventing human sacrifice. The meat from these animals is then distributed locally to needy Muslims, neighbours and relatives. Finally, the hajji puts off ''[[ihram]]'' and the hajj is complete.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

=== Circumcision ===
{{See also|Circumcision in the Bible|Brit Milah|Khatna|Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|History of male circumcision}}
Judaism practices [[brit milah|circumcision]] for males as a matter of religious obligation at the age of 8 days old, as does [[Khitan (Circumcision)|Islam]] as part of Sunnah.

[[Western Christianity]] replaced that custom with a [[baptism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=222&amp;letter=B&amp;search=Baptism Jewish Encyclopedia: Baptism]: "According to rabbinical teachings, which dominated even during the existence of the Temple (Pes. viii. 8), Baptism, next to circumcision and sacrifice, was an absolutely necessary condition to be fulfilled by a [[proselyte]] to Judaism (Yeb. 46b, 47b; Ker. 9a; 'Ab. Zarah 57a; Shab. 135a; Yer. Kid. iii. 14, 64d). Circumcision, however, was much more important, and, like baptism, was called a "seal" (Schlatter, "Die Kirche Jerusalems", 1898, p.&amp;nbsp;70). But as circumcision was discarded by Christianity, and the sacrifices had ceased, Baptism remained the sole condition for initiation into religious life. The next ceremony, adopted shortly after the others, was the [[Laying on of hands|imposition of hands]], which, it is known, was the usage of the Jews at the ordination of a rabbi. [[Anointing]] with oil, which at first also accompanied the act of Baptism, and was analogous to the anointment of priests among the Jews, was not a necessary condition".&lt;/ref&gt; ceremony varying according to the denomination, but generally including [[Baptism by immersion|immersion]], [[aspersion]], or [[anointment]] with water. The [[Early Church]] (Acts 15, the [[Council of Jerusalem]]) decided that circumcision is not required for [[Gentile Christians]]. The [[Council of Florence]] in the 15th century&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cirp.org/library/cultural/councilflorence/ "Ecumenical Council of Florence (1438–1445)"]. The Circumcision Reference Library.

=== Food restrictions ===
{{Main article|kashrut|halal|ital}}
{{See also|Apostolic Decree}}
Judaism and Islam have strict [[dietary laws]], with permitted food known as [[kosher]] in Judaism, and [[halal]] in Islam. These two religions prohibit the consumption of pork; Islam prohibits the consumption of alcoholic beverages of any kind. Halal restrictions can be seen as a modification of the [[kashrut]] dietary laws, so many kosher foods are considered halal; especially in the case of meat, which Islam prescribes must be slaughtered in the name of God.  Hence, in many places, Muslims used to consume kosher food.  However, some foods not considered kosher are considered halal in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundvision.com/info/halalhealthy/halal.kosher.asp "Halal &amp; Healthy: Is Kosher Halal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823055532/http://www.soundvision.com/info/halalhealthy/halal.kosher.asp |date=23 August 2009 }}, SoundVision.com—Islamic information &amp; products. 5 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

With rare exceptions, Christians do not consider the Old Testament's strict food laws as relevant for today's church; see also [[Biblical law in Christianity]]. Most Protestants have no set food laws, but there are minority exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Schuchmann, Jennifer. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/tc/todaysculture/healthhealing/3.40.html?start=1 "Does God Care What We Eat?"], ''Today's Christian'', January/February 2006. Retrieved 6 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church believes in observing abstinence and penance. For example, all Fridays through the year and the time of Lent are penitential days.&lt;ref&gt;Canon 1250, 1983. The 1983 Code of Canon Law specifies the obligations of Latin Rite Catholic.&lt;/ref&gt; The law of abstinence requires a Catholic from 14 years of age until death to abstain from eating meat on Fridays in honor of the Passion of Jesus on Good Friday. The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] obtained the permission of the Holy See for Catholics in the U.S. to substitute a penitential, or even a charitable, practice of their own choosing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/clife/lent/abfast.php "Fasting and Abstinence"], Catholic Online. 6 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eastern Rite Catholics]] have their own penitential practices as specified by the Code of Canons for the Eastern Churches.

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] (SDA) embraces numerous Old Testament rules and regulations such as tithing, Sabbath observance, and Jewish food laws. Therefore, they do not eat pork, shellfish, or other foods considered unclean under the [[Old Covenant]]. The "Fundamental Beliefs" of the SDA state that their members "are to adopt the most healthful diet possible and abstain from the unclean foods identified in the Scriptures".{{Bibleref2c|Leviticus|11:1–47}} &lt;sup&gt;among others&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html "Fundamental Beliefs"], No. 22. Christian Behavior. Seventh-Day Adventist Church website. 6 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Christian Bible]], the consumption of strangled animals and of [[Taboo food and drink#Blood|blood]] was forbidden by [[Apostolic Decree]]{{Bibleref2c|Acts|15:19–21}} and are still forbidden in the [[Greek Orthodox]] Church, according to German theologian [[Karl Josef von Hefele]], who, in his Commentary on Canon II of the Second Ecumenical Council held in the 4th century at Gangra, notes: "We further see that, at the time of the Synod of [[Gangra]], the rule of the Apostolic Synod [the [[Council of Jerusalem]] of Acts 15] with regard to blood and things strangled was still in force. With the [[Greek Orthodox|Greeks]], indeed, it continued always in force as their Euchologies still show." He also writes that "as late as the eighth century, [[Pope Gregory III|Pope Gregory the Third]], in 731, forbade the eating of blood or things strangled under threat of a penance of forty days."&lt;ref&gt;Schaff, Philip. "Canon II of The Council of Gangra". ''The Seven Ecumenical Councils.'' 6 August 2009. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.viii.v.iv.ii.html Commentary on Canon II of Gangra].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] abstain from eating blood and from [[blood transfusions]] based on {{bibleref2|Acts|15:19–21}}.

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] prohibits the consumption of alcohol, coffee, and non-herbal tea. While there is not a set of prohibited food, the church encourages members to refrain from eating excessive amounts of red meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/89|title=Doctrine and Covenants 89|website=Lds.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sabbath observance ===
{{See also|Biblical Sabbath|Shabbat|Christian Sabbath|Jumu'ah}}
Sabbath in the Bible is a weekly day of [[leisure|rest]] and time of [[worship]]. It is observed differently in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam and informs a similar occasion in several other Abrahamic faiths. Though many viewpoints and definitions have arisen over the millennia, most originate in the same textual tradition.

=== Proselytism ===
Judaism accepts converts, but has had no explicit [[missionary|missionaries]] since the end of the [[Second Temple Judaism|Second Temple era]]. Judaism states that non-Jews can achieve righteousness by following [[Noahide Laws]], a set of moral imperatives that, according to the [[Talmud]], were given by God&lt;ref&gt;According to Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, Entry ''Ben Noah'', page 349), most [[Rishonim|medieval authorities]] consider that all seven commandments were given to [[Adam]], although [[Maimonides]] ([[Mishneh Torah]], Hilkhot M'lakhim 9:1) considers the dietary law to have been given to Noah.&lt;/ref&gt; as a binding set of laws for the "children of [[Noah]]"—that is, all of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Talmudit (Hebrew edition, Israel, 5741/1981, entry ''Ben Noah'', introduction) states that after the giving of the [[Torah]], the Jewish people were no longer in the category of the sons of Noah; however, Maimonides (Mishneh Torah, Hilkhot M'lakhim 9:1) indicates that the seven laws are also part of the Torah, and the Talmud (Bavli, [[Sanhedrin]] 59a, see also Tosafot ad. loc.) states that Jews are obligated in all things that Gentiles are obligated in, albeit with some differences in the details.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare {{bibleverse||Genesis|9:4–6|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that as much as ten percent of the Roman Empire followed the Judaism either as fully ritually obligated Jews or the simpler rituals required of non-Jewish members of that faith.&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite book |trans-title=[[The Times Atlas of World History]] |title=Spectrum–Times Atlas van de Wereldgeschiedenis |editor-first=Geoffrey |editor-last=Barraclough |editor-link=Geoffrey Barraclough |year=1981 |orig-year=1978 |publisher=Het Spectrum |pages=102–103}} {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Moses Maimonides]], one of the major Jewish teachers, commented: "Quoting from our sages, the righteous people from other nations have a place in the world to come if they have acquired what they should learn about the Creator". Because the commandments applicable to the Jews are much more detailed and onerous than [[Noahide]] laws, Jewish scholars have traditionally maintained that it is better to be a good non-Jew than a bad Jew, thus discouraging conversion. In the U.S., as of 2003 28% of married Jews were married to non-Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Kornbluth, Doron. ''Why marry Jewish?''. Southfield, MI: Targum Press, 2003. {{ISBN|978-1-56871-250-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''See also [[Conversion to Judaism]].''

[[File:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|''The [[Sermon on the Mount]]'' by [[Carl Heinrich Bloch]].]]
Christianity encourages [[evangelism]]. Many Christian organizations, especially Protestant churches, send [[missionary|missionaries]] to non-Christian communities throughout the world. ''See also [[Great Commission]]''. [[Forced conversion]]s to Catholicism have been alleged at various points throughout history. The most prominently cited allegations are the [[Constantine I turn against Paganism|conversions of the pagans after Constantine]]; of Muslims, Jews and Eastern Orthodox during the [[Crusades]]; of Jews and Muslims during the time of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], where they were offered the choice of exile, conversion or death; and of the Aztecs by [[Hernán Cortés]]. Forced conversions to Protestantism may have occurred as well, notably during the [[Reformation]], especially in England and Ireland (see [[recusancy]] and [[Popish plot]]).

Forced conversions are condemned as sinful by major denominations such as the Roman Catholic Church, which officially states that forced conversions pollute the Christian religion and offend human dignity, so that past or present offences are regarded as a scandal (a cause of unbelief). According to [[Pope Paul VI]], "It is one of the major tenets of Catholic doctrine that man's response to God in faith must be free: no one, therefore, is to be forced to embrace the Christian faith against his own will."&lt;ref&gt;Pope Paul VI.

[[Dawah]] is an important Islamic concept which denotes the preaching of Islam. Da‘wah literally means "issuing a summons" or "making an invitation". A Muslim who practices da‘wah, either as a religious worker or in a volunteer community effort, is called a dā‘ī, plural du‘āt. A dā‘ī is thus a person who invites people to understand Islam through a dialogical process and may be categorized in some cases as the Islamic equivalent of a missionary, as one who invites people to the faith, to the prayer, or to Islamic life.

Da'wah activities can take many forms. Some pursue Islamic studies specifically to perform Da'wah. [[Mosques]] and other Islamic centers sometimes spread Da'wah actively, similar to evangelical churches. Others consider being open to the public and answering questions to be Da'wah. Recalling Muslims to the faith and expanding their knowledge can also be considered Da'wah.

In [[Islamic theology]], the purpose of Da‘wah is to invite people, both Muslims and non-Muslims, to understand the commandments of God as expressed in the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet, as well as to inform them about Muhammad. Da‘wah produces converts to Islam, which in turn grows the size of the Muslim [[Ummah]], or community of Muslims.

== Dialogue between Abrahamic religions ==

This section reports on writings and talks which describe or advocate dialogue between the Abrahamic religions.

'''Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi'''&lt;br /&gt;
{{External media | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AJW8GxJtXI Jesus meets him says [[Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi]].]}}
In 1997, [[Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi]] claims to have met [[Jesus]] in [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goharshahi.com/|title=Awaited Imam Mehdi (Messiah) Riaz Ahmed Gohar Shahi -=Gohar Shahi International=-|first=His Holiness Riaz Ahmed Gohar|last=Shahi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then he has exalted God's love above all religious differences. He describes the situation in this way: "A Muslim says, 'I am superior to all.' A Jew declares, 'I am even better than the Muslim.' And a Christian says, 'I am greater than both the Muslim and the Jew, and the rest of the religions, because I am the nation of God's Son.'" However, Gohar Shahi himself "declares that superior and best of all is the one who possesses God's love in his heart, in spite of his indifference to any religion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goharshahi.us/about/|title=Imam Mehdi Gohar Shahi – About Imam Mehdi|first=His Holiness Ra Riaz Gohar|last=Shahi|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amir Hussain'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2003, a book called ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'' contains a chapter by [[Amir Hussain]] on "Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue" which he shows how interfaith dialogue has been an integral part of Islam from its beginning. From his "first revelation" for the rest of his life, Muhammad was "engaged in interfaith dialogue." Islam would not have spread without "interfaith dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;Amir Hussain, "Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue," in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi, 252–253 (Oneworld Publications, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Hussain gives an early example of "the importance of pluralism and interfaith dialogue" to Islam. When some of Muhammad’s followers suffered "physical persecution" in [[Mecca]], he sent them to [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]], a Christian nation, where they were "welcomed and accepted" by the Christian king. Another example is [[Córdoba, Andalusia]] in Muslim Spain, in the ninth and tenth centuries. Córdoba was "one of the most important cities in the history of the world". In "Christians and Jews were involved in the Royal Court and the intellectual life of the city." Thus, there is "a history of Muslims, Jews, Christians, and other religious traditions living together in a pluralistic society."&lt;ref&gt;Amir Hussain, "Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue," in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi, 253–254 (Oneworld Publications, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Turning to the present, Hussain says that one of the challenges faced by Muslims now is the conflicting passages in the Qur̀an some of which support interfaith "bridge-building," but others can be used "justify mutual exclusion." 
&lt;ref&gt;Amir Hussain, "Muslims, Pluralism, and Interfaith Dialogue," in ''Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism'', ed. Omid Safi, 254 (Oneworld Publications, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trialogue'''&lt;br /&gt;
The 2007 book ''Trialogue: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Dialogue'' puts the importance of interfaith dialogue starkly: "We human beings today face a stark choice: dialogue or death!"&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Swidler, Khalid Duran, Reuven Firestone, ''Trialogue: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Dialogue'' (Twenty-Third Publications, 2007), 1, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''Trialogue'' book gives four reasons why the three Abrahamic religions should engage in dialogue:&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Swidler, Khalid Duran, Reuven Firestone, ''Trialogue: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Dialogue'' (Twenty-Third Publications, 2007), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
:1. They "come from the same Hebraic roots and claim Abraham as their originating ancester."
:2. "All three traditions are religions of ethical monotheism."
:3. They "are all historical religions."
:4. All three are "religions of revelation."

'''Pope Benedict XVI'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2010, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] spoke about "Interreligious dialogue."  He said that "the Church's universal nature and vocation require that she engage in dialogue with the members of other religions." For the Abrahamic religions, this "dialogue is based on the spiritual and historical bonds uniting Christians to Jews and Muslims." It is dialogue "grounded in the sacred Scriptures" and "defined in the Dogmatic Constitution on the Church ''Lumen Gentium'' and in the Declaration on the Church's Relation to Non-Christian Religions ''Nostra Aetate''. The Pope concluded with a prayer: "May Jews, Christians and Muslims . . .  give the beautiful witness of serenity and concord between the children of Abraham."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/apost_exhortations/documents/hf_ben-xvi_exh_20120914_ecclesia-in-medio-oriente.html|title=Ecclesia in Medio Oriente: Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation on the Church in the Middle East: Communion and Witness (14 September 2012) – BENEDICT XVI|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Learned Ignorance'''&lt;br /&gt;
In the 2011 book ''Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims'', the three editors address the question of "why engage in interreligious dialogue; its purpose?":
*[https://dornsife.usc.edu/tools/mytools/PersonnelInfoSystem/DOC/Faculty/REL/vita_1012733.pdf James L. Heft], a Roman Catholic priest, suggests "that the purpose of interreligious dialogue is, not only better mutual understanding . . . but also trying . . . to embody the truths that we affirm."&lt;ref&gt;James L. Heft, Reuven Firestone, and Omid Safi, ''Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2011), 301–302.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Omid Safi]], a Muslim, answers the question of "why engage in interreligious dialogue?" He writes, "because for me, as a Muslim, God is greater than any one path leading to God." Therefore, "neither I nor my traditions has a monopoly on truth, because in reality, we belong to the Truth (God), Truth to us."&lt;ref&gt;James L. Heft, Reuven Firestone, and Omid Safi, editors, ''Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2011), 305.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[http://huc.edu/directory/reuven-firestone# Reuven Firestone], a Jewish Rabbi writes about the "tension" between the "particularity" of one's "own religious experience" and the "universality of the divine reality" that as expressed in history has led to verbal and violent conflict. So, although this tension may never be "fully resolved," Firestone says that "it is of utmost consequence for leaders in religion to engage in the process of dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;James L. Heft, Reuven Firestone, and Omid Safi, editors, ''Learned Ignorance: Intellectual Humility Among Jews, Christians and Muslims'' (Oxford University Press, USA, 2011), 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Interfaith Amigos'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2011, [[TED (conference)|TED]] broadcast a 10-minute program about "Breaking the Taboos of Interfaith Dialogue" with Rabbi Ted Falcon (Jewish), Pastor Don Mackenzie (Christian), and Imam Jamal Rahman (Muslim) collectively known as [http://interfaithamigos.com/Home.html The Interfaith Amigos] See their TED program [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPnZArtsG_c by '''clicking here'''.]

'''Divisive matters should be addressed'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2012, a [[PhD]] thesis ''Dialogue Between Christians, Jews and Muslims'' argues that "the paramount need is for barriers against non-defensive dialogue conversations between Christians, Jews, and Muslims to be dismantled to facilitate the development of common understandings on matters that are deeply divisive." As of 2012, the thesis says that this has not been done.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traubman.igc.org/frythesis.pdf Ian Rex Fry, ''Dialogue Between Christians, Jews and Muslims'' (PhD Thesis, 2012), 37, 333. Retrieved July 3, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cardinal Koch'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2015, Cardinal [[Kurt Koch]], the President of the [[Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity]] and who is "responsible for the Church's dialogue with the Jewish people," was interviewed in 2015. He noted that the Church is already engaged in "bilateral talks with Jewish and Muslim religious leaders." However, he said that it is too early for "trialogue" talks among the three Abrahamic religions. Yet, Koch added, "we hope that we can go in this [direction] in future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2015/05/22/cardinal_koch_trialogue_among_catholics,_jews,_muslims/1145856|title=Cardinal Koch: Trialogue among Catholics, Jews, Muslims?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Omid Safi'''&lt;br /&gt;
In 2016, a 26-minute interview with Professor [[Omid Safi]], a Muslim and Director of the [http://islamicstudies.duke.edu/ Duke Islamic Studies Center], was posted on YouTube.com. In it, Safi said that his life had been trying to combine "love and tenderness" which are the "essence of being human" with "social justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRX0XlgTvzo |title=Interview with Professor Omid Safi [Eng Subs] |author=Parmida Mostafavi |date=19 April 2016 |website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Violent conflicts ==

=== Between Abrahamic religions ===
In most of their common history, the three Abrahamic religions have been "ignorant about each other, or worse, especially in the case of Christians and Muslims, attacked each other." In the [[La Convivencia]] (The Coexistence) in the 14th and 15th centuries, Muslims, Christians and Jews co-existed in relative peace, but, otherwise, there has been "very little genuine dialogue" between believers in these Abrahamic religions. They have "kept their distance from one another, or were in conflict. . . there has been very little genuine dialogue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifacs.com/the-necessity-of-inter-faith-diplomacy-the-catholicmuslim-dialogue/|title=The Necessity of Inter-Faith Diplomacy: The Catholic/Muslim Dialogue – Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aspect La Convivencia is shown in a six-minute video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7_GT2yqUAQ Cities of Light] that documents collaboration between [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Spanish Jewish]], Muslim and Christian scientists in 12th century Spain. It features the works of [[Maimonides]] (Jewish philosopher) and [[Averroes]] (Muslim philosopher).

Examples of violent conflict follow:
* Jews killed Christians during the Bar Kochba revolt.&lt;ref name="livius"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/ja-jn/jewish_wars/bk03.html#Justin|title=Texts on Bar Kochba: Eusebius|author=Eusebius|publisher=livius.org|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm|title=CHURCH FATHERS: The First Apology (St. Justin Martyr)|website=Newadvent.org|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Yemeni Jewish Himyar tribe, led by King [[Dhu Nuwas]] massacred [[Christians]].&lt;ref&gt;Simon's letter is part of Part III of ''The Chronicle of Zuqnin'', translated by Amir Harrack (Toronto: [[Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies]], 1999), pp.&amp;nbsp;78–84.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Sasanian conquest and occupation of Jerusalem]] led to the massacre of Christians by Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historynewsnetwork.org/article/125435|title=What We Choose to Remember: Jerusalem in World History|website=historynewsnetwork.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Byzantine–Arab Wars|wars]] between the emerging Islamic [[Caliphates]] and the Christian [[Byzantine]] or [[Eastern Roman Empire]] between the 7th and the 11th centuries CE were a series of military, political and religious conflicts which led to the Islamization of large territories in the [[Near East]] such as Egypt and Syria.
* The [[Crusades]] (end of 11th – end of 13th century CE) were a series of military expeditions from Western Europe to the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean: a rather unsuccessful response by Western (Catholic) Christians to aid their Eastern counterparts in retaking what was perceived by all Christians as the [[Holy Land]] from its Muslim inhabitants. In passing, Crusades were also marked with conflicts between Western and Eastern ([[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]], [[Syro-Jacobite]] and [[Armenians|Armenian]]) Christians and unilateral damage inflicted by Western Christians to Jews along the path of travel and in the Holy Land.
* The [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquest]] and the following [[Reconquista]] of Spain, and founding of Portugal (beginning of 8th – end of 15th century CE) were a series of wars between Muslims and Christians in the [[Iberian peninsula]] resulting in the founding of several Muslim and Christian Medieval states and the final victory of the Catholic [[Crown of Castile]] and [[Aragon]] against the Muslim Emirate of [[Granada]].
* The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the [[Balkan peninsula]] (mid-14th – end of 15th century CE) followed by a series of wars between the Islamic [[Ottoman Empire]] and various Christian powers and alliances (end of 14th – beginning of 20th century CE) was an important political, military and cultural process for South-Eastern Europe resulting in the fall of the Eastern Roman (or Byzantine) Empire and its successor states and finally leading to the emerging of several modern nations in that region.
* The [[Spanish inquisition]] was an attempt by the Christian Catholic church in Spain in the wake of the centuries-long [[Reconquista]] to suppress or expel Jews and Muslims and to prosecute Christian heretics. Openly Jewish and Muslim people were expelled rather than killed, but many submitted to [[forced conversion]] to Catholicism to avoid expulsion. The [[Inquisitors]] often did not trust the converts, and persecuted them cruelly for being secret adherents of their original religions, which was often [[crypto-Jews|true]] but sometimes fabricated. Jewish forced converts were known as "[[anusim]]," or sometimes by the pejorative "[[morrano]] (pig)."{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}
* At various points in history [[pogroms]] against Jews were common in Christian Europe, and in many Islamic areas. See [[blood libel]].
* [[Persecution of Bahá'ís]] and [[Political accusations against the Bahá'í Faith]] review the substantive efforts in parts of the world against the Bahá'ís and their religion.

=== Between branches of the same Abrahamic religion ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
* The [[Fourth Crusade]] and subsequent wars between Catholic Europeans and the Orthodox Byzantine Greeks following the [[East–West Schism|Great Schism]].
* The Christian [[Reformation]] of the 16th century CE was an attempt towards a religious reform in the Catholic Christian Church which resulted in a series of [[Religious Wars]] between Catholic and emerging Reformist/Protestant Christian forces during the 16th and 17th centuries CE throughout Western Europe.
* The [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)]] was due to a religious conflict between Catholic and Protestant Christians, and economic causes.
* There have been many violent conflicts between the Sunni and Shia branches of Islam; see [[Shi'a–Sunni relations]].
* [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|After]] the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] by a [[Coalition of the Willing|western coalition]] there was an armed conflict between branches of Islam, with fighting and bombings, even of mosques.

=== Between Abrahamic religions and non-adherents ===
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
* Religious hostility fueled the [[Maccabean Revolt|Jewish revolt against the Selucid Empire]] and [[Jewish–Roman wars]].
* Earlier Roman emperors persecuted Christians. For example, see [[Diocletianic Persecution]].
* In the initial expansion of both Christianity and Islam, a number of pagan communities were converted.
* Wars between the Hindu [[Majapahit|Majapahit Empire]] (modern-day [[Indonesia]]) and Islamic states led to the decrease of Hinduism in [[South East Asia]].

==Early life==

Hodgkin was born in [[Banbury]], Oxfordshire, to George Hodgkin and Mary Wilson Hodgkin. His father died of dysentery in [[Baghdad]] in 1918. His mother was remarried to Lionel Smith, with whom they lived. He was educated at [[The Downs School (Herefordshire)|The Downs School]] near [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], [[Gresham's School]], and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Benson, S. G. G., Crossley Evans, Martin, ''I Will Plant Me a Tree: an Illustrated History of Gresham's School'' (James &amp; James, London, 2002) {{ISBN|0-907383-92-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, he was the winner of a bronze medal in the Public Schools Essay Competition organised by the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]].&lt;ref&gt;''Protection of Birds Measures Urged By Royal Society'' in ''The Times'', Saturday, 29 March 1930; pg. 14; Issue 45474; col C&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

During the Second World War, he volunteered on Aviation Medicine at [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|Farnborough]] and was subsequently transferred to the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] (TRE) where he worked on the development of centimetric [[radar]], including the design of the [[Automatic Gun-Laying Turret|Village Inn]] AGLT airborne gun-laying system. Earlier, in March 1941, Hodgkin had flown on the test flight of a [[Bristol Blenheim]] fitted with the first airborne centimetric radar system. As the war ended in 1945, he joined the faculty of physiology department in Cambridge University. He was the Foulerton Professor of the [[Royal Society]] between 1951 and 1969. He served on the Royal Society Council from 1958 to 1960 and on the Medical Research Council from 1959 to 1963. He was foreign secretary of the Physiological Society from 1961 to 1967. He was appointed the John Humphrey Plummer Professor of Biophysics at Cambridge University in 1970. He also held additional administrative posts such as Chancellor, [[University of Leicester]], from 1971 to 1984, and Master, Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1978 to 1985.

==Achievements==

With [[Andrew Fielding Huxley]], Hodgkin worked on experimental measurements and developed an [[Hodgkin–Huxley model|action potential theory]] representing one of the earliest applications of a technique of [[electrophysiology]], known as the "[[voltage clamp]]". The second critical element of their research was the use of the [[squid giant axon|giant axon]] of the [[Loligo forbesii|veined squid]] (''Loligo forbesii''),&lt;ref name=hodgkin52&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hodgkin|first1=AL|last2=Huxley|first2=AF|last3=Katz|first3=B|title=Measurement of current-voltage relations in the membrane of the giant axon of ''Loligo''|journal=The Journal of Physiology|year=1952|volume=116|issue=4|pages=424–48|pmid=14946712|url=http://jp.physoc.org/content/116/4/424.full.pdf+html?ijkey=279b646a71339ce37f9961fa93b43503ac7e2c25&amp;keytype2=tf_ipsecsha|pmc=1392219|doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1952.sp004716}}&lt;/ref&gt; which enabled them to record ionic currents as they would not have been able to do in almost any other [[neuron]], such cells being too small to study using the techniques of the time. The experiments started at the [[University of Cambridge]], beginning in 1935 with frog [[sciatic nerve]], and soon after they continued their work using squid giant axons at the [[Marine Biological Association]] Laboratory in Plymouth. In 1939, reporting work done in Plymouth, Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley published a short paper in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' announcing their achievement of recording action potentials from inside a nerve fibre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/144710a0|title=Action Potentials Recorded from Inside a Nerve Fibre|year=1939|last1=Hodgkin|first1=A.

With Huxley, he established the propagation mechanism of nerve impulse called "[[action potential]]s", the electrical impulses which enable the activity of an organism to be coordinated by a [[central nervous system]]. In addition Hodgkin and Huxley's findings led them to hypothesize the existence of [[ion channel]]s on cell membranes, which were confirmed only decades later. Confirmation of ion channels came with the development of the [[patch clamp]] leading to a Nobel prize in 1991 for [[Erwin Neher]] and [[Bert Sakmann]], and in 2003 for [[Roderick MacKinnon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwiening|first=C.

Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, Andrew Fielding Huxley, and John Carew Eccles (for his research on [[synapse]]s) were jointly awarded the 1963 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for their discoveries concerning the ionic mechanisms involved in excitation and inhibition in the peripheral and central portions of the nerve cell membrane".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1963|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1963/|website=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB|accessdate=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodgkin was knighted (KCB) in 1972 and appointed to the [[Order of Merit]] in 1973. He was elected President of the [[Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom]] in 1966. From 1970 to 1975 he was [[President of the Royal Society|President]] of the [[Royal Society]]. The Royal Society awarded him its [[Royal Medal]] in 1958 and [[Copley Medal]] in 1965. He was also elected to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], [[American Philosophical Society]], [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]], [[Deutsche Akademie]], and [[Indian National Science Academy]].

==Personal life==

Alan Hodgkin married [[Marni Hodgkin|Marion Rous]] in 1944, whom he met while at Rockefeller Institute in 1938. She was the daughter of an American pathologist, [[Francis Peyton Rous]], who won the 1966 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. She became Children's Book Editor at [[Macmillan Publishing Company]] and a successful writer of children's literature, including ''Young Winter's Tales'' and ''Dead Indeed''. They had three daughters, Sarah, Deborah, and Rachel, and a son Jonathan. [[Jonathan Hodgkin]] became a molecular biologist at Cambridge University. Deborah Hodgkin is also a successful psychologist.

[[Thomas Hodgkin]] (1798-1866), who first described [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]], was Alan Hodgkin's ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saxon|first1=Wolfgang|title=Sir Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, 84, A Nobelist in Nerve Research|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/22/world/sir-alan-lloyd-hodgkin-84-a-nobelist-in-nerve-research.html|accessdate=March 23, 2017|work=New York Times|date=December 22, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alf Niels Christian Ross''' (10 June 1899 – 17 August 1979) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] legal and moral philosopher and scholar of international law. He is best known as one of the leading exponents of [[Scandinavia]]n [[legal realism]]. He is known for [[Imperative logic#Ross' paradox|Ross' paradox]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Copenhagen]], Alf Ross graduated from high school in 1917. He studied [[law]], graduating in 1922. He consequently worked in a barrister’s office. In 1923, he commenced a study tour, which would last for two and a half years, visiting France, England and Austria. He spent 1928–1929 in Uppsala, receiving a degree in philosophy in 1929 from the [[Uppsala University|university]]. In 1935, he was appointed to teach at the University of Copenhagen in Constitutional Law. In 1953, Ross published ''Om Ret og Retfærdighed'' (which he would later publish in English, under the title ''On Law and Justice'').

In this book, he states that there is no a priori validity to give the law some special position. Experience serves as a guideline. This means, for example, that the famous dictum ‘suum cuique tribuere’, ‘to give to everyone his own’, has no meaning until it has been determined what actually belongs to someone, which means that this is a matter of [[begging the question]] (''On Law and Justice'', § 64 (p.&amp;nbsp;276)). His determination not to rely on anything but the facts leads to statements as the following: “The legal rule is neither true nor false; it is a directive.” (''On Law and Justice'', § 2 (p.&amp;nbsp;2)). Furthermore, the norm is directed at judges rather than citizens (''On Law and Justice'', § 7 (p.&amp;nbsp;33)).

In this line of thought, he opposes [[natural law]]-approaches: “Like a harlot, natural law is at the disposal of everyone. The ideology does not exist that cannot be defended by an appeal to the law of nature. And, indeed, how can it be otherwise, since the ultimate basis for every natural right lies in a private direct insight, an evident contemplation, an intuition. Cannot my intuition be just as good as yours? Evidence as a criterion of truth explains the utterly arbitrary character of the metaphysical assertions. It raises them up above any force of inter-subjective control and opens the door wide to unrestricted invention and dogmatics.” (''On Law and Justice'', § 58 (p.&amp;nbsp;261).)

==Biography==
Aloysius P. Martinich was born June 28, 1946 in [[Euclid General Hospital]], [[Euclid]], [[Ohio]]. He attended Catholic schools in the [[Cleveland]] area and graduated from [[Villa Angela-St. Joseph High School|St. Joseph High School]] in 1964. He graduated from the [[University of Windsor]], [[Ontario]] in 1969 with a B.A. (First Honours), with a major in Honours Philosophy. He received his Ph.D. in December, 1972, with a dissertation, Reference and the Axiom of Existence, under the direction of Avrum Stroll. Later, he and Stroll co-authored the major article, “Epistemology,” in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] and the book, Much Ado about Non-Existence.

He became assistant professor of philosophy at the [[University of Texas]] at [[Austin]] in 1973, and eventually became Roy Allison Vaughan Centennial Professor in Philosophy. He is also professor of History and Professor of Government, through courtesy appointments. He has lectured at many universities in the United States, Europe, and China.

He has specialized in the philosophy of language and the philosophy of [[Thomas Hobbes]]. His book, The Two Gods of Leviathan (1992), argued for two main theses: that Hobbes was trying to reconcile traditional Christian doctrine with the new science of Copernicus and Galileo and that properly understood Christianity is not politically destabilizing. His biography ''Hobbes'', which won the [[Robert W. Hamilton Book Award]]  in 2000&lt;ref&gt;https://research.utexas.edu/honors-recognition/university-coop-awards/hamilton-book-author-awards-winners/&lt;/ref&gt; is currently the standard one.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

'''Anatoly Rykov''' is a [[Russians|Russian]] art and [[Political Theorist|political theorist]], [[History of art|art historian]], and [[professor]] at the [[Saint Petersburg State University]].&lt;ref&gt;https://history.spbu.ru/zi-sotrudniki/details/6/155.html&lt;/ref&gt; In his numerous writings Professor Rykov argues that [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] projects in art and [[culture]] often employ [[Psychological repression|repressive]] and [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] concepts and metaphors. He introduced the notion of “radical [[conservatism]]” in order to explain this phenomenon in the theoretical matrix of the [[avant-garde]] and its postmodern interpretation. An expert on both Russian and Western art history and theory, he has written on a range of subjects in the [[Renaissance]], 18th, 19th and 20th Century art. In his award-winning book, Postmodernism as radical conservatism (2007), he analyses the connotations of [[right-wing politics]] and philosophy in the work of eminent representatives of American [[Aesthetics|art theory]]. His other publications include Marxism and Loneliness (On the “Political Unconscious” of the Contemporary Humanities in the West, Foundations of Art Theory (2007), Origins of the avant-garde (2016), and [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]]: Sociology of art (2016). His current research project Russian Art Theory: between Fascism and Shamanism concerns the issues of convergence between different political and sacral discourses in Russian twentieth-century theories of art.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ias.uwa.edu.au/lectures/rykov&lt;/ref&gt;

'''António Fernando de Vasconcelos Nogueira''' (born 26 September 1961) is a Portuguese [[philosopher]], [[Social Science]] researcher, author, [[dramatist]], and [[freelance]] [[journalist]].

==Biography==
António de Vasconcelos Nogueira was born in Águeda, Portugal. He spent his childhood and part of his adolescence in Luanda, Angola, a former Portuguese colony in Africa, where he attended Catholic primary schools. Back in mainland Portugal, he continued his secondary education at [http://www.esmcastilho.pt  Escola Secundária Marques de Castilho] (founded 1927) in Águeda and at [https://web.archive.org/web/20100531175844/http://es-homemcristo.edu.pt/  Liceu Homem Cristo] (founded 1860) in Aveiro.

António de Vasconcelos graduated in Philosophy from [[Saint Petersburg University]] (founded 1724). As a second year undergraduate he was admitted as a reader to the prestigious [[Library of the Russian Academy of Sciences]] (founded 1747). Subsequently, he gained a degree and master's from the [[University of Lisbon]] (founded 1290-1308; 1911) and later a Ph.D. in philosophy from the [[University of Aveiro]], where he undertook post doctoral research in economic history.

Early in his career he started teaching. From 1991 to 1993 António de Vasconcelos taught philosophy and psychology at public high schools such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20100416150415/http://www.eps-jose-falcao.rcts.pt/escola.html  Escola C+S José Falcão de Miranda do Corvo] (founded 1972), [[Coimbra]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100531175844/http://es-homemcristo.edu.pt/  Liceu Homem Cristo] (founded 1860) and [https://web.archive.org/web/20100528100603/http://linemas.dyndns.org/escola/  Escola Secundária Dr. Mário Sacramento] (founded 1893), all in Aveiro.

His academic career has been, since the middle 1990s, at different private institutes and public colleges, lecturing in Social Science disciplines. From 1993 to 1996 António de Vasconcelos was Visiting Professor of [[Anthropology]] and [[Ethics]] at [https://web.archive.org/web/20100412160154/http://www.ipiaget.org/vn-gaia/  Instituto Piaget], [[Vila Nova de Gaia]]. From 1996 to 1998, of [[Sociology]] at [http://www.ipam.pt/  Instituto Português de Administração de Marketing]; and again from 2001 to 2002, of [[Culture]]; II Semester 2002 of [[Economic History]] at [[University of Aveiro]]; and I Semester 2005 of [[Interfaith|Interfaith Dialogue]] at [http://www.iscra.pt/  Instituto Superior de Ciências Religiosas de Aveiro]. From 2002 to 2004 he had tutorial groups at [https://web.archive.org/web/20100602102751/http://www2.cifop.ua.pt/  Centro Integrado de Formação de Professores], University of Aveiro.

Specialized research work followed these fields. From 1999 to 2001 António de Vasconcelos focused on Jewish Studies and Portuguese diaspora; from 2003 to 2005, he concentrated on Portuguese emigration from Madeira to the British West Indies, British Guyana, Hawaii, the Midwest in the US, and Brazil, during the second half of 19th century. Since 2006 he has been doing research on Portuguese immigration to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.

As a freelance journalist, since 2007 he has worked for [http://www.jornal-contacto.lu/  Contacto], a Portuguese weekly newspaper (founded 1970) published in Luxembourg. From 1996 to 1997 he worked for [http://www.diarioaveiro.pt/  Diário de Aveiro] (founded 1985), a regional daily newspaper, and in 1988 for [[O Diário]] (1976–1990), published in Lisbon.

Other interests include Travelling, History of Art, Drawing and Painting, Creative Writing, Shiatsu as a therapy and Christian Meditation.

==Works==
António de Vasconcelos’ views on Philosophy and Social Science deal with Ethics, History of Philosophy, Economic History, Portuguese Studies and Jewish Studies. Main sources, subjects and influences, stem from Ancient Philosophical writings and authors such as Plato, Seneca and Augustine of Hippo; from Modern Philosophy – René Descartes, Brother Lawrence, Blaise Pascal and Immanuel Kant; and from Contemporary Philosophy and Social Science – Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo, Nicolau Berdiaev, Albert Schweitzer, António Sérgio, Wladyslaw Tatarkiewicz, Joaquim de Carvalho, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, María Zambrano, Hannah Arendt, Emmanuel Lévinas, Simone de Beauvoir, Soeur Emmanuelle, António José Saraiva, Joel Serrão, Primo Levi, Eduardo Lourenço and José Gil.

'''Writing'''

In 2007 he was awarded The Portuguese National Prize for Theatre ‘Bernardo Santareno’ for The Lamentations of [[Glückel of Hameln]], published in 2008. This drama deals with the vulnerability of human beings, questioning the meaning of life and death, according to one’s faith, beliefs and attitudes. It was inspired by Glückel of Hameln’s Memoirs (1689–1699; 1715–1719), and in certain books of the Bible such as Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Wisdom, Sirach and Lamentations. Other sources are: (1) the dramatic works of Gil Vicente, considered the main reference for Portuguese and Spanish drama; Luis Vaz de Camoens’ lyrical poetry in Portuguese and Spanish; Joseph de la Vega; William Shakespeare; Samuel Beckett and Bernardo Santareno. (2) the poetry of Rainer Maria von Rilke and Marina Tsvetaeva; (3) the autobiographical works of Frank McCourt .

In 2001 António de Vasconcelos was awarded The Portuguese Literary Prize ‘José Régio’ for the drama The Master of [[Königsberg]]. This first drama was published in 2004, on the occasion of the bi-centennial of Immanuel Kant’s death and it portrays aspects of his life, thoughts and sayings, questioning morals and stereotyping. It is based on: (1) Kant’s correspondence and biographies written by G.B. Jäsche, L. E. Borowski, R. B. Jachmann and A. Ch. Wasianski; (2) and influenced by the dramatic works of Bertolt Brecht and Samuel Beckett.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8866">'''''Black Art''''' is a poem written by African-American poet and writer [[Amiri Baraka]]. It was written in 1965 after the assassination of [[Malcolm X]], soon after the poet (formerly LeRoi Jones) had taken on a new name.The poem issued a clarion call for art by and for [[Black people]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;We want a black poem. And a 
Black World.
Let the world be a Black Poem
And Let All Black People Speak This Poem
Silently
or LOUD&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The poem sparked the beginning of the [[Black Arts Movement]] in poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=David L.|date=1986|title=Amiri Baraka and the Black Arts of Black Art|url=|journal=boundary 2|volume=15|issue=1/2|pages=235–254|doi=10.2307/303432|issn=01903659|jstor=303432|quote=One of Baraka's most controversial poems, it rapidly became a central icon of the Black Arts Movement.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Black Art" was published in ''The Liberator'' in January 1966, and subsequently re-published in numerous anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culturalfront.org/2011/09/from-black-art-poem-to-black-arts.html|title=From a 'Black Art' Poem to 'The Black Arts Movement'|website=www.culturalfront.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/2606/blog/study-race-and-culture-america/103874/amiri-baraka-and-two-consequential-poems|title=Amiri Baraka and two consequential poems from 1965 {{!}} H-Afro-Am {{!}} H-Net|last=Rambsy II|first=Howard|date=December 27, 2015|website=networks.h-net.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==
The poem is described as one of Baraka’s most expressive political poems, as it uses sharp language, onomatopoeia and violence to call out the nation. The poem itself is about poems and how black artists must stand for being black and not copy or imitate white poets. Baraka is calling for black artists to have meaning in their art and produce content that defends their blackness. Baraka felt that his work should fully divulge the nationwide racism and create “poems that kill”. Barack uses terms such as “negroleader”, “jewlady’s”, and “whities” to clearly explain that his message is targeting the race hardships faced for people of color living in the south in the 1960s.  

It uses strong imagery to focus on the violence and allow the readers to slip into the mind of Baraka and experience the poem as their own life. “Let there be no love poems written until love can exist freely and cleanly.” Baraka calls for realism in [[black poetry]], to stop cookie cutting away and over-glorifying the lives that black people must live in a racist nation. He wants the black people to understand that they must achieve a black aesthetic and a black worldview in order to be free from the race constraints placed on them by white society.

A poem such as "Black Art" (1965), according to [[Werner Sollors]], of Harvard University, expressed the authors need to commit the violence required to "establish a Black World".&lt;ref&gt;Sollors, Werner (1978). Amiri Baraka / LeRoi Jones: The Quest for a "Populist Modernism". Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baraka even uses onomatopoeia in "Black Art" to express that need for violence: "rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr . . . tuhtuhtuhtuhtuhtuht . . ." More specifically, lines in "Black Art" such as "Let there be no love poems written / until love can exist freely and cleanly" juxtaposed with "We want a black poem. / And a Black World" demonstrate Baraka's cry for political justice during a time when racial injustice was rampant, despite the Civil Rights Movement.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson (2000). Anthology of Modern American Poetry. pp. 998–999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amiri Baraka's "Black Art" serves as one of his most controversial, yet poetically profound supplements to the Black Arts Movement. In this piece, Baraka merges politics with art, criticizing poems that are not useful to or adequately representative of the Black struggle. First published in 1966, a period particularly known for the Civil Rights Movement, the political aspect of this piece underscores the need for a concrete and artistic approach to the realistic nature involving racism and injustice. Serving as the recognized artistic component to and having roots in the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Arts Movement aims to grant a political voice to black artists (including poets, dramatists, writers, musicians, etc.). Playing a vital role in this movement, Baraka calls out what he considers to be unproductive and assimilatory actions shown by political leaders during the Civil Rights Movement. He describes prominent Black leaders as being "on the steps of the white house...kneeling between the sheriff's thighs negotiating coolly for his people."&lt;ref name="Black Art"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nathanielturner.com/blackart.htm|title=Black Art|website=www.nathanielturner.com|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baraka also presents issues of euro-centric mentality, by referring to Elizabeth Taylor as a prototypical model in a society that influences perceptions of beauty, emphasizing its influence on individuals of white and black ancestry.&lt;ref name="Black Art"/&gt; Baraka aims his message toward the Black community, with the purpose of coalescing African Americans into a unified movement, devoid of white influences. "Black Art" serves as a medium for expression meant to strengthen that solidarity and creativity, in terms of the Black Aesthetic. Baraka believes poems should "shoot…come at you, love what you are" and not succumb to mainstream desires.&lt;ref name="Black Art"/&gt;

He ties this approach into the emergence of hip-hop, which he paints as a movement that presents "live words…and live flesh and coursing blood."&lt;ref name="Black Art"/&gt; Baraka's cathartic structure and aggressive tone are comparable to the beginnings of hip-hop music, which created controversy in the realm of mainstream acceptance, because of its  "authentic, un-distilled, unmediated forms of contemporary black urban music."&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/facing-new-millennium/essays/pop-music-and-spatialization-race-1990s|title=Pop Music and the Spatialization of Race in the 1990s {{!}} The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|date=2012-07-12|website=www.gilderlehrman.org|access-date=2016-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baraka believes that integration inherently takes away from the legitimacy of having a Black identity and Aesthetic in an anti-Black world. Through pure and unapologetic blackness, and with the absence of white influences, Baraka believes a black world can be achieved. Though hip-hop has been serving as a recognized salient musical form of the Black Aesthetic, a history of unproductive integration is seen across the spectrum of music, beginning with the emergence of a newly formed narrative in mainstream appeal in the 1950s. Much of Baraka's cynical disillusionment with unproductive integration can be drawn from the 50s, a period of rock and roll, in which "record labels actively sought to have white artists "cover" songs that were popular on the rhythm-and-blues charts"&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"/&gt; originally performed by African American artists. The problematic nature of unproductive integration is also exemplified by Run-DMC, an American Hip-Hop group founded in 1981, who became widely accepted after a calculated collaboration with the rock group Aerosmith on a remake of the latter's "Walk This Way" took place in 1986, evidently appealing to young white audiences.&lt;ref name="gilderlehrman.org"/&gt; Hip-Hop emerged as an evolving genre of music that continuously challenged mainstream acceptance, most notably with the development of rap in the 1990s. A significant and modern example of this is Ice Cube, a well-known American rapper, songwriter, and actor, who introduced subgenre of hip-hop known as "gangsta rap," merged social consciousness and political expression with music. With the 1960s serving as a more blatantly racist period of time, Baraka notes the revolutionary nature of hip-hop, grounded in the unmodified expression through art. This method of expression in music parallels significantly with Baraka's ideals presented in "Black Art," focusing on poetry that is also productively and politically driven.

The '''Mouth of Truth''' ({{lang-it|Bocca della Verità}} {{IPA-it|ˈbokka della veriˈta|}}) is a marble mask in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], which stands against the left wall of the portico of the [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]] church, at the Piazza della Bocca della Verità, the site of the ancient [[Forum Boarium]] (the ancient cattle market). It attracts visitors who audaciously stick their hand in the mouth.

The massive marble mask weighs about 1300&amp;nbsp;kg and probably depicts the face of the sea god [[Oceanus]]. The eyes, nostrils and mouth are open.  Historians aren't quite certain what the original purpose of the disc was. It was possibly used as a drain cover in the nearby [[Temple of Hercules Victor]], which had an oculus—a round open space in the middle of the roof, similar to that of the Pantheon. Hence, it could rain inside. It is also thought that cattle merchants used it to drain the blood of cattle sacrificed to the god Hercules. In the thirteenth century the disc was probably removed from the temple and placed against the wall of the Santa Maria in Cosmedin. In the seventeenth century it eventually moved to its current location inside the portico of the church.

Coin-operated [[fortune teller machine]]s have been developed and installed in different parts of the world, including one on display in the [[Musee Mecanique]].&lt;ref name=dps&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpsusa.com/bocca_verita_history.shtml#deity |title=BOCCA DELLA VERITA' facts and history |publisher=Dpsusa.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=San Francisco Chronicle|title=Old and in the way / The Musee Mecanique will soon be history|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Old-and-in-the-way-The-Musee-Mecanique-will-2868971.php#photo-2233497|date=27 February 2002|last=Nolte|first=Carl|accessdate=19 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mouth of Truth has also been featured as a theme in historical European art. [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], a German painter during the Renaissance period, created two paintings depicting a woman placing her hand in the mouth of a statue of a lion while onlookers watched, a subject which was drawn by [[Albrecht Altdorfer]] and made into a woodcut by the Dutch printmaker [[Lucas van Leyden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Property From An Important European Private Collection - Lucas Cranach the Elder|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2015/old-master-british-paintings-evening-sale-l15033/lot.8.html|website=sothebys.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mouth of Truth is referenced in one chapter of [[Devil Lady|Devilman Lady]], by a Devil Beast known as Mita, who utters its Italian name alongside an illustration of the Mouth, before transforming into a spider-like creature with a mouth full of fangs on its back, which rapidly descends and bites off the top of the head of its victims before they can react.

The Mouth of Truth is depicted as a teacher in the japanese manga Shishunki Renaissance David-kun, the teacher uses his mouth to verify if students are telling the truth or not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3628">{{Music of China}}

'''Chinese musicology''' is the academic study of traditional [[Chinese music]].  This discipline has a very long history. The concept of music ''yue'' stands among the oldest categories of Chinese thought, however, in the known sources it does not receive a fairly  clear definition until the writing of the ''[[Classic of Music]]'' (lost during the Han dynasty).

==Music scales==
The first [[musical scale]]s were derived from the [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. On the [[Guqin]] (a traditional instrument) all of the dotted positions are equal string length divisions related to the open string like 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, 1/4, 3/4, etc. and are quite easy to recognize on this instrument. The Guqin has a scale of 13 positions all representing a natural harmonic position related to the open string.

The ancient Chinese defined, by mathematical means, a gamut or series of ''[[Shí-èr-lǜ]]'' (called the 十二律 12 ''lü'') from which various sets of five or seven frequencies were selected to make the sort of "do re mi" major [[scale (music)|scale]] familiar to those who have been formed with the [[Musical notation|Western Standard notation]]. The 12 ''lü'' approximate the frequencies known in the West as the chromatic scale, from A, then B-flat, through to G and A-flat.

==Scale and tonality==

Most Chinese music uses a [[pentatonic scale]], with the intervals (in terms of ''lǜ'') almost the same as those of the major pentatonic scale. The notes of this scale are called ''gōng'' 宫, ''shāng'' 商, ''jué'' 角, ''zhǐ'' 徵 and ''yǔ'' 羽. By starting from a different point of this sequence, a scale (named after its starting note) with a different interval sequence is  created, similar to the construction of [[Musical mode#Modern modes|modes]] in modern Western music.

Since the Chinese system is not an [[equal tempered]] tuning, playing a melody starting from the ''lǜ'' nearest to A will not necessarily sound the same as playing the same melody starting from some other ''lǜ'', since the [[wolf interval]] will occupy a different point in the scale. The effect of changing the starting point of a song can be rather like the effect of shifting from a [[major key|major]] to a [[minor key]] in Western music. The scalar tunings of [[Pythagoras]], based on 2:3 ratios (8:9, 16:27, 64:81, etc.), are a western near-parallel to the earlier calculations used to derive Chinese scales.

&lt;!--this image is not limited in width to 400px due to the amount of small detail--&gt;
[[File:Chinese_Music_Gamut_&amp;_Scales.svg|800px|left|thumb|How the scales are produced: Start with a fundamental frequency. (440 hertz is used here.) Apply the ratios to make the first column. Copy the second and all further elements in this column to the respective heads of the other eleven columns. Apply the ratios to make the second through the twelfth columns. So doing produces 144 frequencies (with some duplications). From each column five different selections of non-adjacent frequencies can be made. (See the colored blocks at the far left.) So each column can produce 60 different pentatonic scales.]]

'''Critical practice''' is the methodology used by a [[critic]] or observer to understand and evaluate a [[Field of study|field of knowledge]].  While sometimes the fields of knowledge studied are academic, non-academic fields such as merchandising, law enforcement and medical clinical practice have been extensively studied. Critical practice is grounded in the concepts of [[critical theory]]. Consultants employing critical practice skills aim to help people improve outcomes. Analysis is applied to groups working in a particular area of expertise and with identifiable practice skills, and usually to a defined range of problems and situations. Thus, practice tends to be based on a restricted view of people and their problems with a limited range of values applied in that practice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} 

Critical practice aims to develop the ability and skill to see beyond the usual concerns of any given profession, into its unintended side effects, causes and consequences, and to do so from a critical and evaluative perspective.

Thus, for example, the profession of [[social work]] might be practiced critically through practitioners being conscious that their role may be seen, and could operate, as an agent of [[social control]], rather than just one of promoting some degree of liberation or of empowerment. In such a case the practitioner would be both the observer and the observed.

Suzuki was also a prolific translator of Chinese, Japanese, and [[Sanskrit literature]].  Suzuki spent several lengthy stretches teaching or lecturing at Western universities, and devoted many years to a professorship at [[Ōtani University]], a Japanese Buddhist school.

He was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=12957 Nomination Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
[[File:Daisetsu Teitarō Suzuki da giovane.jpg|upright|thumb|right|His student days.]]
D. T. Suzuki was born Teitarō Suzuki in Honda-machi, [[Kanazawa, Ishikawa|Kanazawa]], [[Ishikawa Prefecture]], the fourth son of physician Ryojun Suzuki. The Buddhist name ''Daisetsu'', meaning "Great Humility", the kanji of which can also mean "Greatly Clumsy", was given to him by his Zen master [[Soyen Shaku|Soen (or Soyen) Shaku]].&lt;ref name="Fields138"&gt;Fields 1992, pg. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Although his birthplace no longer exists, a humble monument marks its location (a tree with a rock at its base). The [[samurai]] class into which Suzuki was born declined with the fall of [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan (1185-1603)|feudalism]], which forced Suzuki's mother, a [[Jōdo Shinshū]] Buddhist, to raise him in impoverished circumstances after his father died. When he became old enough to reflect on his fate in being born into this situation, he began to look for answers in various forms of religion. His naturally sharp and philosophical intellect found difficulty in accepting some of the [[cosmologies]] to which he was exposed.&lt;ref&gt;D. T. Suzuki  "Introduction: Early Memories" in ''The Training of the Zen Buddhist Monk''.  New York: University Books. 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

===Study===
Suzuki studied at [[the University of Tokyo]]. Suzuki set about acquiring knowledge of Chinese, [[Sanskrit]], [[Pāli|Pali]], and several European languages. During his student years at Tokyo University, Suzuki took up Zen practice at [[Engaku-ji]] in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].&lt;ref name="Fields138" /&gt; (See Zen Training section, below.)

Suzuki lived and studied several years with the scholar [[Paul Carus]]. Suzuki was introduced to Carus by [[Soyen Shaku]] (also written Soen Shaku), who met him at the [[World Parliament of Religions]] held in Chicago in 1893.  Carus, who had set up residence in [[LaSalle, Illinois]], approached Soyen Shaku to request his help in translating and preparing Eastern spiritual literature for publication in the West. Soyen Shaku instead recommended his student Suzuki for the job.  Suzuki lived at Dr. Carus's home, the [[Hegeler Carus Mansion]], and worked with him, initially in translating the classic ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' from ancient Chinese.  In Illinois, Suzuki began his early work ''Outlines of Mahayana Buddhism''.

Carus himself had written a book offering an insight into, and overview of, Buddhism, titled ''[[The Gospel of Buddha]]''.  Soyen Shaku wrote an introduction for it, and Suzuki translated the book into Japanese.  At this time, around the turn of the century, quite a number of Westerners and Asians (Carus, Soyen, and Suzuki included) were involved in the worldwide Buddhist revival that had begun slowly in the 1880s.

===Marriage===
In 1911, Suzuki married Beatrice Erskine Lane, a [[Radcliffe College|Radcliffe]] graduate and [[Theosophist]] with multiple contacts with the [[Bahá'í Faith]] both in America and in Japan.{{sfn|Tweed|2005}} Later Suzuki himself joined the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]] and was an active Theosophist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Algeo|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Algeo 2007"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Algeo|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tweed 2005"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Tweed|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Hu Shih and D. T. Suzuki.jpg|thumb|right|Hu Shi and DT Suzuki during his visit to China in 1934.]]

===Professor of Buddhist philosophies===
Besides living in the United States, Suzuki traveled through Europe before taking up a professorship back in Japan. Suzuki and his wife dedicated themselves to spreading an understanding of Mahayana Buddhism. Until 1919 they lived in a cottage on the Engaku-ji grounds, then moved to [[Kyoto]], where Suzuki began professorship at [[Ōtani University]] in 1921. While he was in Kyoto, he visited Dr. Hoseki [[Shin'ichi Hisamatsu]], a famous Zen Buddhist scholar, and they discussed Zen Buddhism together at [[Shunkō-in]] temple in the [[Myōshin-ji]] temple complex.

In 1921, the year he joined Ōtani University, he and his wife founded the Eastern Buddhist Society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.otani.ac.jp/EBS/index.html the Eastern Buddhist Society]&lt;/ref&gt; The Society is focused on [[Mahayana Buddhism]] and offers lectures and seminars, and publishes a scholarly journal, ''The Eastern Buddhist''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.otani.ac.jp/EBS/about_journal.html ''The Eastern Buddhist''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218062921/http://web.otani.ac.jp/EBS/about_journal.html |date=18 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suzuki maintained connections in the West and, for instance, delivered a paper at the World Congress of Faiths in 1936, at the [[University of London]] (he was an exchange professor during this year).

Besides teaching about Zen practice and the history of Zen (Chan) Buddhism, Suzuki was an expert scholar on the related philosophy called, in Japanese, [[Kegon]], which he thought of as the intellectual explication of Zen experience.

Suzuki received numerous honors, including Japan's [[Japanese honors system|National Medal of Culture]].

===Studies===
Still a professor of Buddhist philosophy in the middle decades of the 20th century, Suzuki wrote some of the most celebrated introductions and overall examinations of Buddhism, and particularly of the Zen school.  He went on a lecture tour of American universities in 1951, and taught at [[Columbia University]] from 1952 to 1957.

Suzuki was especially interested in the formative centuries of this Buddhist tradition, in China.  A lot of Suzuki's writings in English concern themselves with translations and discussions of bits of the Chan texts the ''[[Biyan Lu]]'' (Blue Cliff Record) and the ''[[The Gateless Gate|Wumenguan]]'' (Mumonkan/Gateless Passage), which record the teaching styles and words of the classical Chinese masters. He was also interested in how this tradition, once imported into Japan, had influenced Japanese character and history, and wrote about it in English in ''Zen and Japanese Culture''. Suzuki's reputation was secured in England prior to the U.S.

In addition to his popularly oriented works, Suzuki wrote a translation of the ''Lankavatara Sutra'' and a commentary on its Sanskrit terminology.  Later in his life he was a visiting professor at [[Columbia University]]. He looked in on the efforts of Saburō Hasegawa, [[Judith Tyberg]], [[Alan Watts]] and the others who worked in the California Academy of Asian Studies (now known as the [[California Institute of Integral Studies]]), in San Francisco in the 1950s.

In his later years, he began to explore the [[Jōdo Shinshū]] faith of his mother's upbringing, and gave guest lectures on Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism at the [[Buddhist Churches of America]].

D.T. Suzuki also produced an incomplete English translation of the [[Kyogyoshinsho]], the ''magnum opus'' of [[Shinran]], founder of the Jōdo Shinshū school.  However, Suzuki did not attempt to popularize the Shin doctrine in the West, as he believed Zen was better suited to the Western preference for Eastern mysticism{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, though he is quoted as saying that Jōdo Shinshū Buddhism is the "most remarkable development of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism ever achieved in East Asia".&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Suzuki ''Buddha of Infinite Light: The Teachings of Shin Buddhism: the Japanese Way of Wisdom and Compassion'' Boulder: Shambhala; New Ed edition. 2002 {{ISBN|1-57062-456-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzuki also took an interest in Christian mysticism and in some of the most significant mystics of the West, for example, [[Meister Eckhart]], whom he compared with the Jōdo Shinshū followers called [[Myokonin]]. Suzuki was among the first to bring research on the Myokonin to audiences outside Japan as well.

Other works include ''Essays in Zen Buddhism'' (three volumes), ''Studies in Zen Buddhism'', and ''Manual of Zen Buddhism''. Additionally, American philosopher [[William Barrett (philosopher)|William Barrett]] compiled many of Suzuki's articles and essays concerning Zen into a volume entitled ''Zen Buddhism''.

===Scholarly opinions===
Suzuki's Zen master, Soyen Shaku, who also wrote a book published in the United States (English translation by Suzuki), had emphasized the [[Mahayana Buddhist]] roots of the Zen tradition.  Suzuki's contrasting view was that, in its centuries of development in China, Zen (or Chan) had absorbed much from indigenous Chinese [[Taoism]]. Suzuki believed that the Far Eastern peoples were more sensitive, or attuned, to nature than either the people of Europe or those of Northern India.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Suzuki subscribed to the idea that religions are each a sort of organism, which is (through time) subject to "irritation" and having a capacity to change or evolve.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

It was Suzuki's contention that a Zen ''[[satori]]'' (awakening) was the goal of the tradition's training, but that what distinguished the tradition as it developed through the centuries in China was a way of life radically different from that of Indian Buddhists. In India, the tradition of the mendicant (holy beggar, ''bhikku'' in Pali) prevailed, but in China social circumstances led to the development of a temple and training-center system in which the abbot and the monks all performed mundane tasks. These included food gardening or farming, carpentry, architecture, housekeeping, administration (or community direction), and the practice of folk medicine. Consequently, the enlightenment sought in Zen had to stand up well to the demands and potential frustrations of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Suzuki ''Studies in Zen'', pp. 155–156. New York:Delta. 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Suzuki ''Zen and Japanese Culture''. New York: Bollingen/Princeton University Press, 1970 {{ISBN|0-691-09849-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzuki is often linked to the [[Kyoto School]] of philosophy, but he is not considered one of its official members.{{OR|date=April 2017}}  Suzuki took an interest in other traditions besides Zen. His book ''Zen and Japanese Buddhism'' delved into the history and scope of interest of all the major Japanese Buddhist sects.

==Zen training==
While studying at Tokyo University Suzuki took up Zen practice at [[Engaku-ji]] in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] studying initially with Kosen Roshi. After Kosen's passing, Suzuki continued with Kosen's successor at Engaku-ji, Soyen Shaku.&lt;ref&gt;Andreasen 1998, pg. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Soyen Shaku, Suzuki's studies were essentially internal and non-verbal, including long periods of sitting meditation (''[[zazen]]''). The task involved what Suzuki described as four years of mental, physical, moral, and intellectual struggle. During training periods at Engaku-ji, Suzuki lived a monk's life. He described this life and his own experience at Kamakura in his book ''The Training of the Zen Buddhist Monk''. Suzuki characterized the facets of the training as: a life of humility; a life of labor; a life of service; a life of prayer and gratitude; and a life of meditation.&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Suzuki ''The Training of the Zen Buddhist Monk''. New York: University Books. 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzuki was invited by Soyen Shaku to visit the United States in the 1890s, and Suzuki acted as English-language translator for a book written by him (1906). Though Suzuki had by this point translated some ancient Asian texts into English (e.g. [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana#English translations|Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]]), his role in translating and ghost-writing aspects of Soyen Shaku's book was more the beginning of Suzuki's career as a writer in English.&lt;ref&gt;Fields 1992 Chapter Ten&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in life Suzuki was more inclined to Jodo Shin (True Pure Land) practice on a personal level, seeing in the doctrine of Tariki, or other power as opposed to self power, an abandonment of self that is entirely complementary to Zen practice and yet to his mind even less willful than traditional Zen. In his book ''Buddha of Infinite Light'' (2002), (originally titled, ''Shin Buddhism'') Suzuki declared that, "Of all the developments that Mahayana Buddhism has achieved in East Asia, the most remarkable one is the Shin teaching of Pure Land Buddhism." (p.&amp;nbsp;22)

==Spread of Zen in the West==

===Zen-messenger===
Suzuki was the foremost important person in spreading Zen in the West. Philosopher [[Charles A. Moore]] said:
{{quote|Suzuki in his later years was not just a reporter of Zen, not just an expositor, but a significant contributor to the development of Zen and to its enrichment.}}

This is echoed by [[Nishitani Keiji]], who declared:
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;in Dr. Suzuki's activities, Buddhism came to possess a forward-moving direction with a frontier spirit&amp;nbsp;... This involved shouldering the task of rethinking, restating and redoing traditional Buddhism to transmit it to Westerners as well as Easterners&amp;nbsp;... To accomplish this task it is necessary to be deeply engrossed in the tradition, and at the same time to grasp the longing and the way of thinking within the hearts of Westerners. From there, new possibilities should open up in the study of the Buddha Dharma which have yet to be found in Buddhist history&amp;nbsp;... Up to now this new Buddhist path has been blazed almost single-handedly by Dr. Suzuki. He did it on behalf of the whole Buddhist world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}}}

===Buddhist modernism===
That Suzuki was a university-educated intellectual steeped in knowledge of Western philosophy and literature allowed him to be particularly successful and persuasive in presenting his case to a Western audience. As Suzuki portrayed it, Zen Buddhism was a highly practical religion whose emphasis on direct experience made it particularly comparable to forms of mysticism that scholars such as [[William James]] had emphasized as the fountainhead of all religious sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;William James "The Varieties of Religious Experience" (New York: Collier Books, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; It is this idea of a common essence which made Suzuki's ideas recognizable to a Western audience, who could identify with the Western esotericism concealed in it, disguised as eastern metaphysics.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} Suzuki presents a version of Zen that can be described as [[Detraditionalization|detraditionalized]] and essentialized. This resemblance is not coincidental, since Suzuki was also influenced by Western esotericism,&lt;ref name="Tweed 2005"/&gt; and even joined the Theosophical Society.&lt;ref name="Algeo 2007"/&gt;

Several scholars have identified Suzuki as a [[Buddhist modernism|Buddhist modernist]]. As scholar David McMahan describes it, Buddhist modernism consists of
{{quote|forms of Buddhism that have emerged out of an engagement with the dominant cultural and intellectual forces of modernity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McMahan|2008|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Most scholars agree that the influence of Protestant and Enlightenment values have largely defined some of the more conspicuous attributes of Buddhist modernism.&lt;ref&gt;See Tomoko Masuzawa "The Invention of World Religions" (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005), amongst others&lt;/ref&gt; McMahan cites
{{quote|western monotheism; rationalism and scientific naturalism; and Romantic expressivism" as influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McMahan|2008|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Buddhist modernist traditions often consist of a deliberate de-emphasis of the ritual and metaphysical elements of the religion, as these elements are seen as incommensurate with the discourses of modernity. Buddhist modernist traditions have also been characterized as being "detraditionalized," often being presented in a way that occludes their historical construction. Instead, Buddhist modernists often employ an essentialized description of their tradition, where key tenets are described as universal and ''sui generis''. It was this form of Zen that has been popularized in the West:
{{quote|The popular "lay" image of Zen, notably the notion that Zen refers not to a specific school of Buddhism but rather to a mystical or spiritual gnosis that transcends sectarian boundaries, is largely a twentieth-century construct. Beginning with the persecution of Buddhism in the early Meiji (haibutsu kishaku) Zen apologists have been forced to respond to secular and empiricist critiques of religion in general, and to Japanese nativist critiques of Buddhism as a "foreign funerary cult" in particular. In response, partisans of Zen drew upon Western philosophical and theological strategies in their attempt to adapt their faith to the modern age.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Sharf|1995|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Criticism===
Suzuki has been criticized for this essentialist approach. As early as 1951 [[Hu Shih]],{{sfn|McRae|2001|p=71-74}}{{sfn|Faure|1996|p=89-99}} criticized Suzuki for presenting an idealist picture of Zen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Hu Shih|1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMahan states:
{{quote|In his discussion of humanity and nature, Suzuki takes Zen literature out of its social, ritual, and ethical contexts and reframes it in terms of a language of metaphysics derived from German Romantic idealism, English [[Romanticism]], and American [[Transcendentalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McMahan|2008|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Suzuki's approach has been marked as "incomprehensible":
{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;D. T. Suzuki, whose most cherished methodology seems to have been to describe some aspect of Zen as beyond ordinary explanation, then offer a suitably incomprehensible story or two by way of illustration. Obviously, Suzuki's approach captured the imaginations of generations of readers. However, while this approach substantiated Suzuki's authority as one with insider access to the profound truths of the tradition, another result was to increase the confusion in reader's minds. To question such accounts was to admit one did not "get it", to distance oneself even further from the goal of achieving what Suzuki termed the "Zen enlightenment experience".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|McRae|2003|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Involvement with Japanese nationalism ==
According to Sharf and Victoria, Suzuki was associated with Japanese nationalism and its propagation via the appraisal of Japanese Zen.&lt;ref name="Sharf 1993"&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Sharf|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been criticised for defending the Japanese war-efforts,{{sfn|Victoria|2006}} though Suzuki's thoughts on these have also been placed in the context of western supremacy in the first half of the 20th century, and the reaction against this supremacy in Asian countries.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Sympathy for Nazism and anti-Semitism===
[[Brian Victoria]] delivered lectures in Germany in 2012 in which he revealed evidence of Suzuki's sympathy for the Nazi regime.&lt;ref name="buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140101000000*/https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/fileadmin/pdf/Vortragsreihen/Suzuki_s_View_of_the_Nazis.docx Lecture: Universität Hamburg 14.05.2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131109170637/http://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/SoSe-2012.133.0.html Abstract, lecture at the Universität Hamburg 14.05.2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  Victoria writes,

"D. T. Suzuki left a record of his early view of the Nazi movement that was included in a series of articles published in the Japanese Buddhist newspaper, Chūgai Nippō, on October 3, 4, 6, 11, and 13, 1936."  In this Suzuki expresses his agreement with Hitler's policies as explained to him by a relative living in Germany.

"While they don't know much about politics, they have never enjoyed greater peace of mind than they have now.  For this alone, they want to cheer Hitler on. This is what my relative told me.  It is quite understandable, and I am in agreement with him." He also expresses agreement with Hitler's expulsion of the Jews from Germany.

"Changing the topic to Hitler's expulsion of the Jews, it appears that in this, too, there are a lot of reasons for his actions.  While it is a very cruel policy, when looked at from the point of view of the current and future happiness of the entire German people, it may be that, for a time, some sort of extreme action is necessary in order to preserve the nation."

Suzuki expressed sympathy with individual Jews. "As regards individuals, this is truly a regrettable situation."&lt;ref name="buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de"/&gt;

Suzuki was a close friend of Gestapo officer Karlfried Graf von Dürckheim. Durkheim, also a noted expounder of Japanese Zen philosophy in the West, was a committed Nazi and had been a Gestapo officer in Tokyo during the war. He helped his a friend Suzuki introduce Zen Buddhism to the western world. Dürckheim was arrested by the Allies during their occupation of Japan and served more than a year in prison as a member of the Gestapo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=C_W0AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT243&amp;vq=suzuki&amp;dq=the%20hitler%20legacy&amp;pg=PT243#v=snippet&amp;q=suzuki&amp;f=false|title=The Hitler Legacy: The Nazi Cult in Diaspora: How it was Organized, How it was Funded, and Why it Remains a Threat to Global Security in the Age of Terrorism|last=Levenda|first=Peter|date=2014-11-08|publisher=Nicolas-Hays, Inc.|isbn=9780892545919|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Buddhism===
&lt;!--"Faith in Buddhism#Modern developments" links here. Please adjust the corresponding wikilink accordingly, if deleting or renaming this section. Thanks.--&gt;
At the onset of modernization in the Meji period, in 1868, when Japan entered the international community, Buddhism was briefly persecuted in Japan{{sfn|Victoria|2006}} as "a corrupt, decadent, anti-social, parasitic, and superstitious creed, inimical to Japan's need for scientific and technological advancement".{{sfn|Sharf|1993|p=3}} The Japanese government intended to eradicate the tradition, which was seen as a foreign "other", incapable of fostering the nativist sentiments that would be vital for national, ideological cohesion. In addition to this, industrialization led to the breakdown of the parishioner system that had funded Buddhist monasteries for centuries.{{sfn|Sharf|1993|p=4}} However, a group of modern Buddhist leaders emerged to argue for the Buddhist cause.{{sfn|Sharf|1993|p=4}} These leaders stood in agreement with the government persecution of Buddhism, accepting the notion of a corrupt Buddhist institution in need of revitalization.

As a response to the modernisation of Japan and the persecution of Buddhism, the ''shin bukkyo'', or "New Buddhism" came into existence. It was led by university-educated intellectuals who had been exposed to a vast body of Western intellectual literature. Advocates of New Buddhism, like Suzuki's teachers Kosen and his successor Soyen Shaku, saw this movement as a defense of Buddhism against government persecution, and also saw it as a way to bring their nation into the modern world as a competitive cultural force.{{sfn|Sharf|1993|p=7}}

Scholars such as Martin Verhoeven {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and Robert Sharf, as well as Japanese Zen monk G. Victor Sogen Hori,{{sfn|Hori|2005}} have argued that the breed of Japanese Zen that was propagated by New Buddhism ideologues, such as Imakita Kosen and Soyen Shaku, was not typical of Japanese Zen during their time, nor is it typical of Japanese Zen now. Its importance lies especially within western Zen:
{{quote|Suffice it to say that, just as the writings of Suzuki and Hisamatsu are not representative of traditional (i.e., pre-Meiji) Zen exegetics, the style of Zen training most familiar to Western Zen practitioners can be traced to relatively recent and sociologically marginal Japanese lay movements which have neither the sanction nor the respect of the modern Rinzai or Sōtō monastic orthodoxies. 

Indeed, the one feature shared by virtually all of the figures responsible for the Western interest in Zen is their relatively marginal status within the Japanese Zen establishment. While Suzuki, Nishida, and their intellectual heirs may have shaped the manner in which Westerners have come to think of Zen, the influence of these Japanese intellectuals on the established Zen sects in Japan has been negligible. At this point, it is necessary to affirm that Japanese Zen monasticism is indeed still alive, despite the shrill invectives of some expatriate Zen missionaries who insist that authentic Zen can no longer be found in Japan.&lt;ref name="Sharf 1993"/&gt;}}

The traditional form of Zen has been greatly altered by the Meiji restoration, but Japanese Zen still flourishes as a monastic tradition. The Zen tradition in Japan, in its customary form, required a great deal of time and discipline from monks that laity would have difficulty finding. Zen monks were often expected to have spent several years in intensive doctrinal study, memorizing sutras and poring over commentaries, before even entering the monastery to undergo [[kōan]] practice in [[sanzen]] with a [[Zen master]].&lt;ref&gt;See Giei Sato, Unsui: a Diary of Zen Monastic Life (Honolulu: University Press of Hawaii, 1973), amongst others&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Suzuki himself was able to do so (as a layman) was largely the invention of New Buddhism.

===Japanese nationalism===
During the [[Meiji period|Meiji restoration]] the [[Nihonjinron|Nihonjinron philosophy]] took prevalence. It emphasizes the uniqueness of the Japanese. This uniqueness has been attributed to many different factors. Suzuki attributed it to Zen. In his view, Zen embodies the ultimate essence of all philosophy and religion. He pictured Zen as a unique expression of Asian spirituality, which was considered to be superior to the western ways of thinking.&lt;ref name="Sharf 1993"/&gt;

Sharf criticizes this uniqueness-thesis, as propagated by Suzuki:
{{quote|The ''nihonjinron'' [[exceptionalism|cultural exceptionalism]] polemic in Suzuki's work—the grotesque caricatures of 'East' versus 'West'—is no doubt the most egregiously inane manifestation of his nationalist leanings.{{sfn|Sharf|1995}}}}

Sharf also doubts the motivations of Suzuki:
{{quote|One is led to suspect that Suzuki's lifelong effort to bring Buddhist enlightenment to the Occident had become inextricably bound to a studied contempt for the West.{{sfn|Sharf|1993}}}}

Kemmyō Taira Satō does not agree with this critical assessment of Suzuki:
{{quote|In cases where Suzuki directly expresses his position on the contemporary political situation—whether in his articles, public talks, or letters to friends (in which he would have had no reason to misrepresent his views)—he is clear and explicit in his distrust of and opposition to State Shinto, rightwing thought, and the other forces that were pushing Japan toward militarism and war, even as he expressed interest in decidedly non-rightist ideologies like socialism. In this Suzuki's standpoint was consistent from the late nineteenth century through to the postwar years. These materials reveal in Suzuki an intellectual independence, a healthy scepticism of political ideology and government propaganda, and a sound appreciation for human rights.{{sfn|Sato|2008|p=118}}}}

==Praise of Suzuki's work==
[[File:DT Suzuki by Okamura.jpg|thumb|right|His later years.]]
Contemporaries of Suzuki acclaimed his works.

Suzuki's books have been widely read and commented on by many important figures. A notable example is ''[[An Introduction to Zen Buddhism]]'', which includes a 30-page commentary by famous [[analytical psychology|analytical psychologist]] [[Carl Jung]], who wrote of Suzuki:

{{quote|Suzuki's works on Zen Buddhism are among the best contributions to the knowledge of living Buddhism. We cannot be sufficiently grateful to the author, first for the fact of his having brought Zen closer to Western understanding, and secondly for the manner in which he has achieved this task.&lt;ref&gt;[[D.T. Suzuki]] An Introduction to Zen Buddhism , Foreword by C. Jung. New York: Grove Press, p.9. 1964 {{ISBN|0-8021-3055-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
But Jung was also critical, warning against an uncritical borrowing from Asian spirituality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8022">'''Edgar Bauer''' (7 October 1820 &amp;ndash; 18 August 1886) was a German political philosopher and a member of the [[Young Hegelians]]. He was the younger brother of [[Bruno Bauer]]. According to Lawrence S. Stepelevich, Edgar Bauer was the most anarchistic of the Young Hegelians, and "...it is possible to discern, in the early writings of Edgar Bauer, the theoretical justification of political terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;Stepelevich, Lawrence S. (1983). The Young Hegelians: An Anthology. Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; German anarchists such as [[Max Nettlau]] and [[Gustav Landauer]] credited Edgar Bauer with founding the anarchist tradition in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Nettlau, M., ''Der Vorfrühling der Anarchie.'' Berlin, 1925, p. 178.  Landauer, G., "Zur Geschichte des Wortes Anarchie." In: ''Der Sozialist'', June 1, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1840s, Marx' and Engels' critique of the Bauer brothers marked the beginning of their collaboration and an important stage in the development of Marxist thought. Edgar Bauer participated in the Revolution of 1848. Subsequently he became a conservative.

==Young Hegelianism and radical politics==

Edgar Bauer was born in [[Charlottenburg]]. He studied jurisprudence and philosophy at the University of Berlin, where he became a member of the Young Hegelian circle around his brother Bruno Bauer. Other members of his circle were [[Arnold Ruge]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Stirner]], [[Friedrich Engels]], [[Georg Herwegh]], [[Karl Grün]], [[Moses Hess]] and [[Mikhail Bakunin]]. He was especially close to Engels at that time. Edgar Bauer soon became a regular contributor to a variety of philosophical and political publications, distinguishing himself by a particularly enthusiastic revolutionary ideology. He did not follow the 'materialist turn' in Young Hegelian philosophy inaugurated by [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] (as Marx, Engels, Grün and others did), but instead remained true to the [[J. G. Fichte|Neo-Fichtean]] idealist 'philosophy of action' propagated by his brother Bruno. Like Bruno, Edgar was a staunch anti-theist and considered the emancipation from religion a necessary precondition of social emancipation. Unlike Bruno, who was sceptical of socialism, Edgar considered himself a socialist and was usually associated with the 'True Socialists' around Hess and Grün. When Bruno Bauer was dismissed from his academic position because of his atheism, it became clear to Edgar that, given his brother's reputation and his own growing track record as a radical publicist, an academic career was closed to him. In 1842 he abandoned his studies and became a free-lance writer and journalist. He contributed to the liberal ''Rheinische Zeitung'', among other publications.

==Imprisonment, revolution and exile==

In 1843 he published a book titled ''The Conflict of Criticism with Church and State''. This caused him to be charged with sedition. He was imprisoned for four years in the fortress at [[Magdeburg]]. While he was in prison, his former associates Marx and Engels published a scathing critique of him and his brother Bruno, titled ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'' (1844). They resumed the attack in ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1846), which was not published at the time. In spite of this, Edgar Bauer seems to have remained on friendly terms with Marx and Engels. Released on the eve of the [[German revolutions of 1848–49|Revolution of 1848]], Edgar Bauer participated in the revolutionary fighting in Berlin and Hamburg. After the defeat of the revolutionaries he went into hiding and then lived under an assumed name in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] for several years, working as a journalist. During the [[First Schleswig War|German-Danish war over Schleswig-Holstein]] (1848–51), he supported the Danish side.

In 1851, facing imminent arrest, he escaped to Denmark and thence to London, England, where he lived in exile for several years. During this time he often met Karl Marx, who was living in London, but the relationship was not one of mutual respect.&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to Friedrich Engels from August 14, 1857, [[Jenny Marx]] writes: "A few evenings ago that clown Edgar Bauer came to see us; truly a dried cod — without any cod-liver oil and on top of that with pretensions to wit. So frightful were his efforts that I almost fainted, while Karl was sick — not just figuratively but in fact." Cf. Marx/Engels ''Collected Works''. Vol. 40. Moscow (Progress Publishers), p. 565. Published online at: http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/letters/jenny/57_08_14.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; During one argument with Marx, Bauer even "lost his temper and punched Marx in the face".&lt;ref&gt;Eric v.d. Luft. "Edgar Bauer and the Origins of the Theory of Terrorism" in Douglas Moggach (ed.) The New Hegelians. Cambridge University Press. 2006. p.148.&lt;/ref&gt; Disillusioned by the failure of the revolution and alienated from most of his fellow refugees, Bauer became increasingly conservative (as did his brother Bruno). From 1852 to 1861 he worked secretly as an informant for the Danish police. In 1856 he publicly distanced himself from his former revolutionary views.

==Amnesty and conservatism==

In 1861, an amnesty enabled Bauer to return to Germany. By now thoroughly conservative, he had renounced anarchism, socialism, democracy, atheism and critical philosophy. He settled in [[Hanover]], became a Prussian civil servant and in 1870 founded the conservative periodical ''Kirchliche Blätter''. He died in Hanover on August 18, 1886. His literary remains are in the ''Archiv der sozialen Demokratie'' (Archive of Social Democracy) in [[Bonn]].

In [[classical scholarship]], the '''''editio princeps''''' ([[plural]]: ''editiones principes'') of a work is the first printed edition of the work, that previously had existed only in [[manuscript]]s, which could be circulated only after being copied by hand.

For example, the ''editio princeps'' of [[Homer]] is that of [[Demetrius Chalcondyles]], now thought to be from 1488. The most important texts of classical Greek and Roman authors were for the most part produced in ''editiones principes'' in the years on either side of 1500, following the invention of the [[printing press]] around 1440.&lt;ref name=Needham&gt;{{cite book |title=Paper and Printing |author=[[Tsien Tsuen-Hsuin]] |author2=[[Joseph Needham]] |series=Science and Civilisation in China|volume=5 part 1|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=158,201|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases there were possibilities of partial publication, of publication first in translation (for example from Greek to Latin), and of a usage that simply equates with [[first edition]]. For a work with several strands of manuscript tradition that have diverged, such as ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', ''editio princeps'' is a less meaningful concept.

The term has long been extended by scholars to works not part of the Ancient Greek and Latin literatures. It is also used for legal works, and other significant documents.

|Edited by [[Ludovico Carbone]]. The edition does not include all ten books of the ''Epistulae'' but only the first seven and the ninth, for a total of 122 letters of the currently existing 375. These were increased to 236 letters in nine books with the publication of the Roman edition in 1490. Still missing was the tenth book, found by [[Giovanni Giocondo]] between 1495 and 1500 in the [[Abbey of St. Victor, Paris|Abbey of St. Victor]] near Paris. Giocondo made a transcription, as did briefly after another Italian, Pietro Leandro, who once returned from France gave his partial copy of the tenth book to Girolamo Avanzi who printed the new 46 letters in [[Verona]] in 1502. For an edition of all Pliny's letters it was necessary to wait 1508, when [[Aldus Manutius]] printed in Venice a complete edition taking advantage of the transcript and other Plinian manuscripts Giocondo had given him.&lt;ref name="MVA1155"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GGNV"&gt;{{it icon}} P.

|rowspan=5|Edited by [[Demetrios Chalkokondyles|Demetrius Chalcondyles]], the book was printed with the help of {{Interlanguage link multi|Demetrius Damilas|el|3=Δημήτριος Δαμιλάς}} that reelaborated the Greek types he had previously used in Milan. The editorial project was completed thanks to the financial support of [[Giovanni Acciaiuoli]] and the patronage of Neri and [[Bernardo de' Nerli]] ([[:it:Nerli|it]]) together with, the latter also author of an opening dedication to [[Piero the Unfortunate|Piero de' Medici]]. The edition included not only the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', but also the so-called ''Homeric Hymns'', the ''Batrachomyomachia'' and passages on Homer from works attributed to [[Plutarch]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Dio Chrysostom|Dio Cocceianus]]. As for the typography the volume has traditionally been attributed to the prolific printer Bartolomeo de' Libri, attribution denied by recent scholarship.

|This edition contains only 6 of Aeschylus' 7 surviving tragedies: missing is the ''Choephoroe''. This is because the manuscripts had fused ''Agamemnon'' and ''Choephoroe'', omitting lines 311-1066 of ''Agamemnon'', a mistake that was corrected for the first time in 1552 in the Venetian edition edited by [[Francesco Robortello|Franciscus Robortellus]]. The separation was not fully successful as the text was not correctly divided, leaving it to the 1557 Paris edition by [[Petrus Victorius]], printed with an appendix by Henricus Stephanus, to finally obtain an adequate edition of Aeschylus' plays.&lt;ref name="JL98-121"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grafton10-411"&gt;A.

|A part of Book VI had been already printed in Venice in 1529 by Joannes Antonius de Sabio, edited by [[Janus Lascaris]] with his Latin translation incorporated. The 1530 edition, edited by [[Vincentius Opsopoeus]], only contained Books I–V together with their Latin translation made by [[Niccolò Perotti|Nicolaus Perottus]]. What survived of the rest of Polybius thanks to the ''excerpta antiqua'' of the other Books was first printed by Joannes Hervagius in Basel in 1549 together with a Latin translation by Wolfgang Musculus. Further Polybian excerpts came to light thanks to [[Fulvio Orsini|Fulvius Ursinus]] that in Antwerp in 1582 published [[Constantine VII|Constantinus Porphyrogenitus]]' ''Excerpta de legationibus''. All this additional material was incorporated in [[Isaac Casaubon]]'s 1609 Polybius Paris edition.&lt;ref name="catalogus7-171"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

'''''Eihei Kōroku''''' ({{CJKV|j=永平広録}}), also known by its English translation '''''Dōgen's Extensive Record''''', is a ten volume collection of works by the [[Sōtō]] [[Zen]] monk [[Eihei Dōgen]]. The bulk of the text, accounting for volumes one through seven, are formal [[Dharma talks|Dharma hall discourses]], or ''jōdō'' (上堂) as they are known in [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese]], given from 1236 to 1252. Volume eight consists of "informal meetings" or ''shōsan''　(小參) that would have taken place in Dōgen's quarters with select groups of monks, as well as "Dharma words" or ''hōgo'' (法語), which were letters containing practice instructions to specific students. Volume nine includes a collection of 90 traditional [[kōan]]s with verse commentary by Dōgen, while volume 10 collects his [[Classical Chinese poetry|Chinese poetry]].&lt;ref name=taigen&gt;{{citation|title=Dogen's Extensive Record: A Translation of the Eihei Koroku|last1=Leighton|first1=Taigen Dan|last2=Okumura|first2=Shohaku|pages=1–67|isbn=9780861716708|publisher=Wisdom Publications|place=Boston|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Dōgen's other major work the ''[[Shōbōgenzō]]'', which was written in vernacular [[Late Middle Japanese]], the text of ''Eihei Kōroku'' is written in the Japanese version of [[Classical Chinese]], known as [[Kanbun]]. While Dōgen is also better known for the essays that make up the ''Shōbōgenzō'', most of them were completed by 1244. After that date, nearly coinciding with his move from [[Kyoto]] to [[Eihei-ji]], he wrote 405 of the 531 Dharma hall discourses that make up ''Eihei Kōroku'', indicating that he may have come to prefer the ''jōdō'' format over the ''jishu'' style used in the Shōbōgenzō essays. [[Taigen Dan Leighton]], a modern Zen priest and translator of the ''Eihei Kōroku'', believes that the Dharma hall discourses tell us more about Dōgen the individual than the Shōbōgenzō as they reveal his training methodology, humor, and even emotional states.&lt;ref name=taigen/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9521">'''Electoral integrity''' refers to international standards and global norms governing the appropriate conduct of elections.&lt;ref&gt;Pippa Norris. 2014. Why electoral integrity matters. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

These standards have been endorsed in a series of authoritative conventions, treaties, protocols, and guidelines by agencies of the international community, notably by the decisions of the UN General Assembly, by regional bodies such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ([[OSCE]]), the Organization of American States ([[Organization of American States|OAS]]), and the African Union ([[African Union|AU]]), and by member states in the United Nations. Following endorsement, these standards apply universally to all countries throughout the electoral cycle, including during the pre-electoral period, the campaign, on polling day, and in its aftermath.&lt;ref&gt;John Hardin Young. 2009. International Election Principles: Democracy and the Rule of Law. Chicago: American Bar Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral malpractices==

[[File:William Hogarth 031.jpg|thumbnail|William Hogarth The Polling 1774-1775]]

The contrary notion of 'electoral malpractice' refers to contests violating international standards and global norms. Problems can arise at every stage of the process, from electoral and ballot access laws favoring incumbents to lack of a level playing field in money and media during campaigns to inaccurate voter registers, flawed counts and partial electoral management bodies.

There is nothing novel about problems of flawed or failed elections which suffer from fraud, corruption, or vote-rigging. Indeed, during the 18th and 19th Centuries, such practices were common in countries holding popular contests, including in [[rotten and pocket boroughs]] in Britain and [[machine politics]] in the United States. Concern about malpractices has grown in recent decades, however, along with the spread of elections to almost every state worldwide.

Contemporary campaigns attracting considerable international concern include allegations of irregularities occurring during the [[Russian presidential election, 2012]], problems of violence during and after the [[Kenyan general election, 2007]], and controversies in the [[Cambodian general election, 2013]].

==Origins in international law and human rights==

The foundation of these standards rests on Article 21(3) in the ''Universal Declaration of Human Rights'' (1948). This specifies that "[t]he will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government; this will shall be expressed in periodic and genuine elections which shall be by universal and equal suffrage and shall be held by secret vote or by equivalent free voting procedures."

These commitments were further developed in Article 25 of the UN International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR of 1966), namely the need for:

* periodic elections at regular intervals;
* universal suffrage that includes all sectors of society;
* equal suffrage, in the idea of one-person, one-vote;
* the right to stand for public office and contest elections;
* the rights of all eligible electors to vote;
* the use of a secret ballot process;
* genuine elections;
* elections that reflect the free expression of the will of the people.

The ''1990 Copenhagen Document of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe'' (CSCE) made commitments that included free elections at regular intervals; the popular election of all seats in at least one chamber; universal and equal suffrage; the right to establish political parties and their clear separation from the state; campaigning in a free and fair atmosphere; unimpeded access to media; secret ballots, with counting and reporting conducted honestly and the results reported publicly; and the due winners being installed and allowed to serve their full terms.

The ''2002 Venice Commission’s Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters'' spells out in detail what is meant by principles such as the universal, equal, free, secret, and direct suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/CDL-AD(2002)023rev-e.aspx European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission). October 2002. Code of Good Practice in Electoral Matters: Guidelines and Explanatory Report. Venice: Venice Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most detailed standards are contained in the practical guidelines for electoral observers published by regional intergovernmental organizations, exemplified by the ''OSCE Election Observation Handbook''.&lt;ref&gt;Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ([[OSCE]]). 2010. Election Observation Handbook, 6th edition. Warsaw: OSCE/ODIHR.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar principles have been adopted in the guidelines developed by the African Union, European Union, and Organization of American States.&lt;ref name="Carter"&gt;[http://www.cartercenter.org/des-search/des/Introduction.aspx Carter Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent statement of these norms in the ''UN General Assembly resolution 63/163'' (April 12, 2012): “Strengthening the role of the United Nations in enhancing periodic and genuine elections and the promotion of democratization.” The language in this document reflects and extends a series of similar statements of principle endorsed regularly by the United Nations since 1991. Resolution 63/163 reaffirms that “democracy is a universal value based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives.” Thus, democratic principles are explicitly endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly, along with a commitment to “the importance of fair, periodic and genuine elections” as the primary mechanism that allows citizens “to express their will.”

This does not imply, however, that the United Nations or the international community endorse any specific institutional design or constitutional mechanisms that can best achieve global norms, leaving this as a matter for national sovereignty. The UN resolution recognizes the responsibility of member states, “for ensuring free and fair elections, free of intimidation, coercion and tampering of vote counts, and that all such acts are sanctioned accordingly.” The United Nations’ role (especially through the Electoral Assistance Division of the Department of Political Affairs and the United Nations Development Programme) is seen as one of providing electoral assistance and support for the promotion of democratization, but only at the specific request of the member state.

==Evidence for electoral integrity and malpractices==

Attempts to document evidence of violations of international standards of electoral integrity can be found in the electoral observer monitoring reports published after each election by regional organizations.&lt;ref name="Carter" /&gt;

Comparative evidence is also available from the expert survey of Perceptions of Electoral Integrity conducted by the [[Electoral Integrity Project]]. This includes the report, part of an annual series, "The year in Elections, 2013" monitoring the quality of 73 presidential and parliamentary elections.  In 2016, Arizona scored the worst in the U.S., with a 53, and Vermont the best, with a 75, on a scale of 100, the [[Arizona Republic]] reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaila White|title=Arizona the worst for electoral integrity, experts say|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2016/12/28/election-electoral-integrity-arizona-rank-worst/95885790/|accessdate=30 December 2016|work=The Arizona Republic (USA Today)|quote=Those indicators were interpreted into a 100-point scale. Arizona scored a total of 53, while the best state, Vermont, scored 75.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' reported that a score of 58 is around the same as Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daniel Politi|title=Sorry, North Carolina, But You Don’t Really Qualify as a Democracy Anymore|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/12/23/north_carolina_doesn_t_really_qualify_as_a_democracy_anymore.html|accessdate=31 December 2016|work=Slate|quote=scored 58/100 in the 2016 election, according to the Electoral Integrity Project, a joint effort between Harvard University and the University of Sydney. That places the state alongside the likes of Cuba, Indonesia and Sierra Leone.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[WSJ]] remarked that with a score of 56, Cuba "jails political dissidents, hasn’t transferred power since 1959, unless the 2008 presidential handoff to Raúl Castro from Fidel Castro counts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=North Carolina’s Iron Curtain|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/north-carolinas-iron-curtain-1483056773|accessdate=31 December 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|quote=Cuba, which jails political dissidents, hasn’t transferred power since 1959, unless the 2008 presidential handoff to Raúl Castro from Fidel Castro counts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24835">'''Eraclie Sterian''' (also known as '''Eracle''' or '''Eracli Sterian'''; November 23, 1872 – 1948) was a [[Romania]]n physician, writer, and political activist, known for introducing [[sexology]] and sex education in his country. Trained as a pathologist, he established his reputation as a popularizer of conventional and [[alternative medicine]] (primarily [[hydrotherapy]]), putting out the influential magazine ''Medicul Poporului''. His early work also dealt with [[life extension]] practices and warnings about the effects of pollution. Sterian was additionally a publisher of textbooks and literary works, and author of dramas—including the [[Natalism|pro-natalist]] propaganda play, ''Tout pour l'enfant'', performed at the [[Théâtre Antoine-Simone Berriau|Théâtre Antoine]] in 1913.

As a doctor and a social critic, Sterian held unconventional views on [[eugenics]], [[human evolution]], and the social role of sexual experiences. These caused a lasting scandal for their challenging of ancestral taboos—although, overall, Sterian remained a conservative and an avowed Christian, who claimed to have found a cure for compulsive masturbation. His [[sex manual]]s, aimed at a young audience, enjoyed success nationwide, and went through several editions in the 1910s.

A Colonel in the [[Romanian Land Forces]], Sterian was also an expert of [[typhus]], having taken part in the World War I campaign against epidemics. In old age, Sterian focused on defending his status as a property owner in [[Bucharest]], founding an Association of Mortgaged Owners and Debtors, and then joining the nation-wide [[League Against Usury]]. He was survived by his son, the writer-politician [[Paul Sterian]], and by his daughter in law, painter [[Margareta Sterian]].

==Biography==

===Early activities===
Born in the port city of [[Galați]], Eraclie Sterian was the son of Dimitrie and Maria. Both parents were natives of [[Craiova]], and had participated in the [[Romanian War of Independence]]: Dimitrie as an officer in combat, Maria as a field nurse.&lt;ref name="vdpaul"&gt;{{ro icon}} Victor Durnea, [http://www.romlit.ro/cazul_paul_sterian_-_ortodox_i_futurist "Cazul Paul Sterian - Ortodox și futurist"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 29/2007&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal uncle may have been the pioneering microbiologist [[Constantin Levaditi]]; on his paternal side, Eraclie was the nephew of actors [[Aristide Demetriade]] and [[Aristizza Romanescu]],&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt; and of poet [[Mircea Demetriade]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Rodica Zafiu]], "Demetriade Mircea", in Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', Vol. I, p. 471. Pitești: [[Editura Paralela 45]], 2004.  {{ISBN|973-697-758-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sterians were widely thought of as [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish]], and, more specifically, Eraclie was rumored to have been baptized a Christian from Judaism.&lt;ref name="vbcapșa"&gt;[[Vlaicu Bârna]], ''Între Capșa și Corso'' (e-book version). Chapter: "Despre judecățile istoriei". Iași: [[Polirom]], 2014.  {{ISBN|978-973-46-4566-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family rejected such claims.&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt;

Eraclie left Galați as a child and moved with his family to Craiova, where he would later graduate from [[Carol I National College]],&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt; in the same class as mathematician [[Gheorghe Țițeica]].&lt;ref&gt;V. Mihăilescu, "O amintire despre Gheorghe Țițeica", in ''Arhivele Olteniei'', Nr. 69–70, September–December 1933, pp. 432–433&lt;/ref&gt; From 1891 to 1897, he took courses at the [[University of Bucharest]] medical school,&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt; and then was an [[Internship (medicine)|intern]] at [[Brâncovenesc Hospital]].&lt;ref name="angh379"&gt;Angheluță, p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the Medical Students' Society from 1892, he gave lectures on the treatment of [[gonorrhea]] and the state of [[physician–patient privilege]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Gomoiu]], ''Istoricul Societăței Studenților în Medicină, 1875–1906. Partea 1'', pp. 138–139, 184, 323. Bucharest: Tipografia Ziarului ''Cronica'' Thoma Basilescu, 1906&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1897, he became a [[Doctor of Medicine]] with a thesis on [[aspergillosis]], following up with papers on [[malaria]] (1899) and [[tuberculosis]] transmission (1902); he also edited for print I. T. Thomescu's courses on pathology and internal medicine,&lt;ref name="angh379–80"&gt;Angheluță, pp. 379–380&lt;/ref&gt; and lectured at the [[Romanian Atheneum]] on the prevention of [[gout]].&lt;ref&gt;"Noutăți. Dela Ateneu", in ''Tribuna Poporului'', December 6/19, 1903, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Settling in Bucharest, where he briefly put out the magazine ''Spitalul'' ("The Hospital"),&lt;ref name="angh379"/&gt; Sterian married Alexandrina Gulimănescu, daughter of a florist from [[Pitești]]. Together, they had four children, including sons Paul (born 1904) and Constantin.&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt; Their home by 1912 was on Bibescu-Vodă Street, 22.&lt;ref name="botez"&gt;Elvira Botez, "Aniversări astronomice centenare", in ''Studii și Comunicări'', Vol. II, 2009, pp. 372, 375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dinor"&gt;"Din originalitățile d-luĭ dr. Eraclie Sterian. Un apel către centenarii romîni de pretutindeni", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', December 30, 1912, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel to his work in conventional medicine, Sterian was becoming a follower of [[Sebastian Kneipp]]'s [[Water cure (therapy)|water cures]]. He published his own introduction on the subject, including a biography of Kneipp, in 1904.&lt;ref name="angh380"&gt;Angheluță, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903, he relaunched his work in medical journalism with a review called ''Tribuna Sănătăței'' ("Health Tribune"),&lt;ref&gt;D-na D-r ⁂, "Poșta medicului", in ''Moda Nouă Ilustrată'', Nr. 12/1904, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and then involved himself in public debates over the medical implications of wearing [[corset]]s. By late 1904, he was arguing, against [[Dimitrie Gerota]], that corsets were not harmful in themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"Treanca-fleanca. Chestia corsetului. Balul lăutarilor din Brăila", in ''[[Furnica (magazine)|Furnica]]'', Nr. 20/1905, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; From November 1, 1905, to May 7, 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Baiculescu ''et al.'', pp. 398–399&lt;/ref&gt; Sterian put out a weekly magazine, first as ''Medicina Populară'' ("Popular Medicine"), then as ''Medicul Poporului'' ("People's Physician"). He began writing occasional articles for ''[[Familia (magazine)|Familia]]'', including a 1906 piece on [[life extension]], advertising [[iodine]]-based cures.&lt;ref&gt;Eraclie Sterian, "Prelungirea vieții", in ''[[Familia (magazine)|Familia]]'', Nr. 21/1906, p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; His other opinion pieces were published under pseudonyms: Ester (in [[Alexandru Macedonski]]'s ''Liga Conservatoare''), Est, and Ilcare.&lt;ref&gt;Straje, pp. 256, 343, 676&lt;/ref&gt;

Sterian's popularization of health subjects earned him a following among the youth and working-class readers. This is attested by writer [[Panait Istrati]], who grew up reading ''Medicina Populară''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Henric Sanielevici]], ''Clasicismul proletariatului: Panait Istrati'', p. 62. Bucharest: [[Adevărul|Editura Adevĕrul]], 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, Sterian published his best-seller, ''Educația sexelor'' ("Sex Education"). It had another edition published that same year, and three more, including a French translation, before 1915.&lt;ref name="angh379–80"/&gt; It was complimented by a [[sex manual]], ''În noaptea nunții'' ("On Your Wedding Night"), published in two editions in 1909.&lt;ref name="angh380"/&gt; Popular with the regular public, such works were found unpalatable by Christian critics, who objected in particular to Sterian's claim that sexual refinement was one of "the holy ancestral values".&lt;ref&gt;Dumitru Neda, "Sfântul în redingotă. Ven. Contardo Ferrini, prof. univ. † 1902", in ''Blajul'', September 1934, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]] intellectual Teofil A. Bălibanu, who read ''Educația sexelor'' in high school, called it "a diabolic work", alleging that "tens of thousands of young men and women" had been driven astray by Sterian.&lt;ref&gt;Ioan Vultur, Teofil A. Bălibanu, "Presa rea. Romane senzaționale, reviste și ziare, cărți de educație sexuale {{sic}}", in ''Flori de Crin. Revistă Femenină'', Nr. 6/1934, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Doctor Ștefan Irimescu dismissed Sterian as a profiteer, noting that the sexology books, rich in "tiny disgusting details", "excite the morbid curiosity of his various readers".&lt;ref name="știchestie"&gt;Ștefan Irimescu, "În chestie personală", in ''[[Viața Romînească]]'', Nr. 1/1911, pp. 100–102&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the books took a conservative view on issues such as masturbation. Sterian believed that recluse male youth were driven into compulsive self-stimulation by "lack of exercise, lack of fresh air, [and by] reading sensual stories and novels", as well as by [[oxalic acid]] as found in chocolate.&lt;ref name="ddportr"&gt;{{ro icon}} Diana Deleanu, [http://adevarul.ro/locale/galati/portretul-medical-onanistului-urma-secol-mai-cearcane-vinete-jurul-ochilor-pupila-e-mai-dilatata-1_56489fc87d919ed50e3fd75b/index.html "Portretul medical al onanistului în urmă cu un secol: 'Mai toți au cearcăne vinete în jurul ochilor, pupila e mai dilatată'"], in ''[[Adevărul]]'' (Galați edition), November 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Sterian thought that chronic male masturbators could be recognized by their "pervasive scent of sperm",&lt;ref&gt;[[Uta Ranke-Heinemann]], ''Eunucos por el reino de los cielos. Iglesia católica y sexualidad'', p. 291. Madrid: Editorial Trotta, 1994.  {{ISBN|84-87699-86-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also by mannerisms, such as laughing for no apparent reason.&lt;ref name="ddportr"/&gt; He also claimed to have cured thousands of "[[Ephebos|ephebes]]" with iodine syrup and injections of [[cacodylic acid]]. He used similar treatments for impotence, where he also recommended [[electroconvulsive therapy]].&lt;ref name="ddportr"/&gt;

===Eugenics and natalism===
His range of interests extended over those years. His topical brochures dealt with life extension treatments, as well as with [[balneotherapy]] (at [[Băile Govora]] and on the [[Romanian Black Sea resorts|Black Sea Littoral]]).&lt;ref name="angh379"/&gt; His proposal that baths could cure tuberculosis was detailed in another 1908 pamphlet, ''Omul oceanic'' ("The Oceanic Man").&lt;ref name="angh380"/&gt; Also that year, he attended a congress of [[thalassotherapy]] in [[Opatija]].&lt;ref&gt;Aleš Fischinger, Duša Fischinger, Janez Fischinger, Ante Škrobonja, "100th Anniversary of the Fourth International Congress of Thalassotherapy in Opatija", in ''Acta Medico-Historica Adriatica'', Vol. 6, Issue 2, 2008, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; First stated in 1909, his claim that he could cure tuberculosis with physiotherapy was met with indignation by the medical establishment. Irimescu, as head physician of [[Filaret Hospital]], called him "illiterate", and suggested that ''Medicul Poporului'' was "intoxicating the public" with "repugnant" information.&lt;ref name="știchestie"/&gt; In a March 1910 article for ''Medicul Poporului'', Sterian challenged [[Eugenics in the United States|American eugenicists]] and their policy of [[compulsory sterilization]], as well as orthodox [[degeneration theory]]. In his view, sterilization could provide some form of [[racial hygiene]], but could do nothing to curb crime, mental disease, or alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;Marius Turda, Aaron Gillette, ''Latin Eugenics in Comparative Perspective'', pp. 104, 287. [[Bloomsbury Publishing]], London &amp; New York City, 2014.  {{ISBN|978-1-4725-3140-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first involvement in political life, as a [[Romanian nationalism|Romanian nationalist]], came late in 1908, and was occasioned by the [[Bosnian crisis]]. Speaking to a nationalist crowd at Dacia Hall, he protested against [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], and even called for the re-annexation of [[Bukovina]] by the [[Kingdom of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;"Intrunirea naționalistă din sala Dacia. Cuvântările oratorilor", in ''Tribuna'', October 16/29, 1908, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; A while after, as concerned members of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]], Sterian and his uncle Mircea Demetriade joined the movement supporting [[Gherasim Safirin]], the [[Archdiocese of Roman and Bacău|Bishop of Roman]], in his conflict with the secularizing [[Romanian Synod]]. At the time, Sterian publicly referred to the Synod as manipulated by "atheists" and "gave sinners".&lt;ref&gt;C. Cernăianu, ''Biserica din Regat, 1908—1918 (Semnele timpului în Biserica noastră. Publicație specială pentru cazuri extraordinare)'', pp. 173–174. Bucharest: Apollo, 1920&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Alexandrina soon became a major patron of Saint Catherine Church, Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;C. Bobulescu, ''Cronica Bisericii Sf. Ecaterine din București, 1577—1 octomvri 1924'', pp. 72–73. Bucharest: [[Convorbiri Literare]], 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Romanian general election, 1912|elections of 1912]], Sterian was also a public speaker at rallies organized by the [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880–1918)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Constantin Bacalbașa]], ''Bucureștii de altă dată'', Vol. IV, pp. 41–42. Bucharest: [[Universul]], 1936&lt;/ref&gt; To May 15, 1912, he served in the Conservative administration as [[Comptroller]] at the [[Ministry of Small and Medium Enterprises, Commerce and Business Environment (Romania)|Ministry of Commerce]].&lt;ref&gt;"Parte oficială. Ministerul Industriei și Comerțului", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', Nr. 37, June 1, 1912, p. 1794&lt;/ref&gt; He was co-opted as a medical expert by the [[Romanian Army]] bulletin, ''Buletinul Armatei și Marinei'', and also wrote for the nationally circulated weekly ''Săptămâna Politică și Culturală''.&lt;ref&gt;Baiculescu ''et al.'', pp. 72, 608&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1912, he joined [[Victor Anestin]]'s Astronomical Society.&lt;ref name="botez"/&gt;

In 1913, Sterian edited for print the poem "Ali's Dream", by his uncle Demetriade.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara Teodorescu, Rodica Fochi, Florența Sădeanu, Liana Miclescu, Lucreția Angheluță, ''Bibliografia românească modernă (1831–1918). Vol. II: D–K'', p. 60. [[Editura științifică și enciclopedică]], Bucharest, 1986.  {{OCLC|462172635}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own [[tragicomedy]], ''Tout pour l'enfant'' ("All for the Child"), was staged in Paris by [[Théâtre Antoine-Simone Berriau|Théâtre Antoine]]. Starring [[Ève Francis]] and [[Allain Dhurtal]],&lt;ref name="emery"&gt;Emery, "Les Répétitions génerales. Au Théâtre Antoine. ''Tout pour l'Enfant'', pièce en trois actes, du Dr. Eraclie Sterian", in ''Comoedia'', June 29, 1913, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rdftout"&gt;[[Robert de Flers]], "Les Théatres. Théatre Antoine: ''Tout pour l'enfant'', pièce en trois actes, du docteur Eraclie Stérian", in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', July 1, 1913, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; it registered significant success during the summer 1913 season.&lt;ref&gt;"Courrier des spectacles", in ''[[Le Gaulois]]'', July 3, 1913, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; If followed the tribulations of a sterile lady, Jeanne Montrose, who encourages her husband to force himself on the much younger Fernande. The conflict over the resulting child is miraculously resolved when Jeanne agrees to let Fernande replace her as Mrs. Montrose.&lt;ref name="rdftout"/&gt; Emery, the staff critic at ''Comoedia'', gave the play a poor review, calling it a "loony bin".&lt;ref name="emery"/&gt; [[Robert de Flers]] wrote in ''[[Le Figaro]]'': "Dr. Eraclie Stérian—apparently well-known in Romania for his scientific works—has set for himself no less a goal than to provide France with a new means to combat depopulation [...]. But heavens, how could Mr. Stérian imagine that in order to produce children for the French—something not at all easy to do—he should first set himself to produce a play—that which is even more difficult? [...] Mr. Eraclie Stérian has an exceedingly large conception of the family, but he also has only a faint notion of what dramatic art is."&lt;ref name="rdftout"/&gt;

With the 1913 book ''Cum putem mări cantitatea de vieață și Paradoxele longevității'' ("How Me May Enhance Life Quantitatively, and The Paradoxes of Longevity"), Sterian produced a more radical critique of degeneration theory, proposing a new take on [[human evolution]]. He hypothesized that modern man was an ape species that had suffered adaptation to [[syphilis]], which, in his reading, meant increased intelligence. Although he believed that syphilitic infection was a "civilizing hero", Sterian noted that the modern form of the epidemic needed to be kept in check.&lt;ref&gt;Titus Malaiu, "Un capitol din domeniul evoluției darviniste. Omul 'copil degenerat' al maimuței sifilizate?", in ''Cultura Creștină'', Nr. 11/1916, pp. 341–345&lt;/ref&gt; The book mainly insisted on solutions for the increase of man's lifespan. During the research phase, Sterian offered free consultations to all of Bucharest's centenarians.&lt;ref name="dinor"/&gt; His overall conclusion was that, through control of one's effort and cultivation of one's intellect, people could live up to age 124.&lt;ref&gt;Leontin Iliescu, "Ex-libris", in ''[[Universul Literar]]'', Nr. 12/1913, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I and after===
In summer 1914, shortly before the start of World War I, ''La Presse Médicale'' published his French-language essay on the supposed medical hazards of [[asphalt concrete]]. Sterian argued that, being impossible to sweep clean, asphalt created unhygienic dust, and also warned that asphalt roads had a serious risk of structural collapse.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georges Vitoux]], "Les trous de Paris, le pavage et l'hygiène", in ''[[Le Petit Parisien]]'', July 31, 1914, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; During the following two years, in [[Romania in World War I|still-neutral Romania]], he returned to his literary work, this time published in Romanian. ''Tout pour l'enfant'' was translated as ''Copilul'' ("The Child"), and bound together with Sterian's second comedy, ''O invenție ciudată'' ("A Strange Invention").&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="angh379"/&gt; Following Romania's [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|entry into the war]], Sterian joined the medical officers' corps of the [[Second Army (Romania)|Second Army]], becoming a Major on April 1, 1917, and a Lieutenant Colonel exactly four years later.&lt;ref&gt;"Parte oficială. Ministerul de Răsboi", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', Nr. 119, August 31, 1921, p. 4707&lt;/ref&gt; He earned distinction with his work in combating [[typhus]], contracting the disease himself and publishing his observations in 1918,&lt;ref name="angh379"/&gt; when other articles of his also saw print in [[Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion|Ionescu-Caion]]'s magazine, ''Cronicarul''.&lt;ref&gt;Straje, p. 676&lt;/ref&gt; The year also marked his son Paul's debut in literature, at age 14.&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt;

Decommissioned and promoted to reserve Colonel on October 1, 1924,&lt;ref&gt;"Parte oficială. Ministerul de Răsboi", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', Nr. 81, April 10, 1925, pp. 4034–4035&lt;/ref&gt; Sterian returned to his native city in April 1926 to give a lecture on [[social medicine]] and [[social hygiene]]—this enterprise was sponsored by the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Dimitriu, "Viața din Moldova. Redacție și la Iași", in ''Cultura Poporului'', Nr. 162/1926, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Having built himself a townhouse at his old home on Bibescu-Vodă,&lt;ref&gt;Chiriță Vasilescu, V. Costantinescu, "Sectorul III Albastru. Proces verbal", in ''Monitorul Comunal al Municipiului București'', October 13, 1929, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; he joined a protest movement of the Bucharest property-owners against the tax rates.&lt;ref&gt;"Legea chiriilor. Intrunirea proprietarilor", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', March 1, 1927, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This was formalized into a Property Owners' Syndicate, founded on December 21, 1925, and presided upon by Constantin Tamara.&lt;ref&gt;"Deciziuni. Tribunalul Ilfov, secția I civilo-corecțională. Extract", in ''[[Monitorul Oficial]]'', Nr. 153, July 11, 1926, p. 10506&lt;/ref&gt;

Sterian also made a brief return to politics following the [[Great Depression]], when he founded the activist Association of Mortgaged Owners and Debtors.&lt;ref name="intrlcc"&gt;"Intrunirea Ligii contra cametei și proprietarilor ipotecați", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', November 4, 1930, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; It was especially active during early 1930, when, together with the larger [[League Against Usury]] (LCC), it preached anti-capitalist rebellion at [[agricultural show]]s. The authorities kept it under watch, viewing it as an outside associate of the outlawed [[Romanian Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Dumitrescu, F. Dumitrescu, "Frămîntări sociale în județul Argeș în anii crizei economice (1929—1933)", in ''Studii și Comunicări'', Vol. II, 1969, pp. 265–266, 272–273&lt;/ref&gt; Sterian's Association finally merged into the LCC in November 1930.&lt;ref name="intrlcc"/&gt; Sterian later made returns to medical research, and, in 1936, claimed to have cured [[Pott disease]] using seawater ("marine plasma") injections.&lt;ref&gt;Ygrec, "O importantă ședință a Societății anatomo-clinice din Capitală", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', November 8, 1936, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Over those years, Paul Sterian had surpassed his father's renown, becoming one of the leading poets of the ''[[Gândirea]]'' circle, as well as a noted economist, sociologist, and diplomat. He may have joined the fascist [[Iron Guard]] at some point in the early-to-mid 1930s and was alleged to be hosting shooting practice for its members on one of Eraclie's properties.&lt;ref name="vbcapșa"/&gt; Married to artist [[Margareta Sterian]], Paul was later head of legation in Washington, D. C., then, during World War II, a public servant of the [[Ion Antonescu]] regime. As the regime adopted [[Holocaust in Romania|hard-line antisemitic policies]] (Paul Sterian was tasked with auctioning off confiscated Jewish property),&lt;ref&gt;[[Mihail Sebastian]], ''Journal, 1935–1944'', pp. 520–521. London: [[Random House]], 2003.  {{ISBN|0-7126-8388-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; the family again had to dismiss public rumors according to which they were Jewish.&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt;

At that late stage of his life, Sterian Sr returned to publishing under the pen name Ave Caesar, with ''Încercări de etimologie'' ("Essays in Etymology", 1939–1940).&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt; Under his real name, he presented his findings to the Friends of Literary History in late November 1940.&lt;ref&gt;"Comunicările ținute la soc. 'Prietenii Istoriei Literare' în anii 1940 și 1941", in ''Preocupări Literare'', Nr. 12/1942, p. 642&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian Victor Durnea, this contribution was forgettable, "obviously the work of a dilettante, often ridiculous in its claims."&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt; Eraclie Sterian died in 1948, just as Romania was entering a period of [[Communist Romania|communist rule]]. The new regime marginalized, imprisoned, and ultimately [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|rehabilitated]] his writer son.&lt;ref name="vdpaul"/&gt;

'''Eugen Fink''' (11 December 1905 – 25 July 1975) was a  [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]].

==Biography==
Fink was born in 1905 as the son of a government official in [[Germany]]. He spent his first school years with an uncle who was a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] priest. Fink attended a grammar school in [[Konstanz]] where he succeeded with his extraordinary memory. After his graduation exam in 1925, he studied philosophy, history, German language and economics, initially at Münster and Berlin and then in Freiburg with [[Edmund Husserl]].

==Philosophy==
As Husserl's assistant, he was a representative of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] [[idealism]] and later a follower of [[Martin Heidegger]]. He approached the problem of Being as a manifestation of the cosmic movement with Man being a participant in this movement. Fink called the philosophical problems pre-questions, that will lead to the true philosophy by the way of an ontological practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6039">An '''evolutionarily significant unit''' ('''ESU''') is a population of [[organism]]s that is considered distinct for purposes of [[Conservation ethic|conservation]]. Delineating ESUs is important when considering conservation action. 
This term can apply to any [[species]], [[subspecies]], [[Race (biology)|geographic race]], or [[population]]. Often the term "species" is used rather than ESU, even when an ESU is more technically considered a subspecies or variety rather than a [[species|biological species]] proper. In [[Marine biology|marine animals]] the term "stock" is often used as well.

==Definition==
Definitions of an ESU generally{{weasel-inline|date=December 2016}} include at least one of the following criteria:&lt;ref name="Conner"&gt;Jeffrey Conner, Daniel Hartl. ''A Primer of Ecological Genetics''. 2004, {{ISBN|978-0878932023}}{{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Current geographic separation,
# Genetic differentiation at [[Genetic_monitoring#Types|neutral markers]] among related ESUs caused by [[Population bottleneck|past restriction of gene flow]], or
# Locally adapted [[Phenotype|phenotypic traits]] caused by differences in [[Natural selection|selection]].

Criterion 2 considers the gene flow between populations, measured by [[fixation index|F&lt;sub&gt;ST&lt;/sub&gt;]]. A high degree of differentiation between two populations among genes that provide no adaptive advantage to either population (known as ''neutral markers'') implies a lack of gene flow, showing that [[Genetic drift|random drift]] has occurred in isolation from other populations. Very few migrants per generation are needed to prevent strong differentiation of neutral markers. Even a single migrant per generation may be enough for neutral markers to show gene flow between populations, making it difficult to differentiate the populations through neutral markers.

Criterion 3 does not consider neutral genetic markers, instead looking at locally adapted traits of the population. Local adaptations may be present even with some gene flow from other populations, and even when there is little differentiation at neutral markers among ESUs. Reciprocal transplantation experiments are necessary to test for genetic differentiation for phenotypic traits, and differences in selection gradients across habitats. Such experiments are generally more difficult than the fixation index tests of criterion 2, and may be impossible for very rare or [[endangered species]].

For example, [[Hemileuca maia|Cryan's buckmoth]] (''Hemileuca maia'') feeds only on the herb ''[[Menyanthes trifoliata]]'', commonly known as buckbean, and while indistinguishable morphologically from related buckmoths, and not differentiated at the genetic markers tested, the moth is highly adapted to its host plant, having 100% survivorship on ''Menyanthes'', while close genetic relatives all died when reared on the plant.&lt;ref name=Buckmoth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=John|first1=Legge|last2=Richard|first2=Roush|last3=Rob|first3=Desalle|last4=Alfried|first4=Vogler|last5=Bernie|first5=May|title=Genetic Criteria for Establishing Evolutionarily Significant Units in Cryan's Buckmoth|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1996.10010085.x |journal=Conservation Biology|date=February 1996|volume=10|issue=1|pages=85–98|ref=http://animalscience.ucdavis.edu/gvl/Conservation_Genetics_Fund/Publications_4_files/1996%20-%20Cryan%27s%20buckmoth.pdf}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 January 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In this case gene flow was sufficient to reduce differentiation at neutral markers, but did not prevent local [[host adaptation]].

Both criteria 2 and 3 have the problem that there is no clear dichotomy between ESU and not-ESU, as genetic differentiation between populations forms a continuum, prompting a contention for consideration of both genetic and ecological processes in identifying ESUs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Crandall | display-authors=etal   | year=2000 | title=Considering evolutionary processes in conservation biology | journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume=15 | issue=| pages=290–295 | doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(00)01876-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the different approaches to designating ESUs each have their benefits, and the need and form of management prescriptions may vary across contexts, some support an "adaptive" approach to identification of ESUs, for instance suggesting consideration of facets from numerous designation methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Fraser | first1= | last2=Bernatchez | year=2001 | title=Adaptive evolutionary conservation: towards a unified concept for defining conservation units | journal=Molecular Ecology | volume=10 | issue=| pages=2741–2752 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-294x.2001.t01-1-01411.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8621">The idea and practice of '''explication''' is rooted in the verb [[wiktionary:explicate|to explicate]], which concerns the process of "unfolding" and of "making clear" the meaning of things, so as to make the implicit explicit. The expression "explication" is used in both [[analytic philosophy]] and literary theory.

== Carnap's notion of explication ==

=== Summary ===

Explication can be regarded as a scientific process which transforms and replaces "an inexact prescientific concept" (which [[Carnap]] calls the explicandum), with a "new exact concept" (which he calls the explicatum). An extended document, like an essay or thesis which describes and explains the new explicit knowledge, is usually called an "Explication".  But an explication may also be contained and expressed in shorter formats, such as in paragraphs and sentences, which are deliberately drafted to emphasise the nature and impact of new explicit knowledge which draws on, and are improvements upon, previous knowledge.

=== On explication and truth ===

An explication in the Carnapian sense is purely stipulative, and thus a subclass of normative definitions. Hence, an explication can not be true or false, just more or less suitable for its purpose. (Cf. Rorty's argument about the purpose and value of philosophy in Rorty, (2003), “A pragmatist view of contemporary analytic philosophy”, in Egginton, W. and Sandbothe, M. (Eds), The Pragmatic Turn in Philosophy, Suny Press, New York, NY.)

Examples of inexact daily life concepts in need of explication are our concepts of cause and of conditionals. Our daily life concept of cause does not distinguish between necessary causes, sufficient causes, complete causes etc. Each of these more precise concepts is an explication of our natural concept of cause.

Natural language will only specify [[truth conditions]] for propositions of the form "If p, then q" for situations where "p" is true. (Most of us probably don't have any clear intuitions regarding the truth conditions of the sentence "If I go out in the sun, I will get sunburned" in situations where I never go out in the sun.) An explication of the conditional will also specify truth conditions for situations where "p" is not true.

=== Reviews of Carnap's argument ===
Carnap's argument provides a helpful foundation in understanding and clarifying the nature and value of explication in defining and describing "new" knowledge.

Others' reviews of Carnap's argument offer additional insights about the nature of explication.  In particular, Bonolio's paper (2003) "Kant’s Explication and Carnap’s Explication: The Redde Rationem", and Maher's (2007) "Explication defended", add weight to the argument that explication is an appropriate methodology for formal philosophy.

== Explication as a process versus explication as an outcome ==
When working with explication, it is essential to be clear, and to make clear whether you are dealing with the explication ''process'' (and hence working with the verb or gerund), or dealing with the ''outcomes'' of the process, such as a work which documents, describes and explains the new explicit knowledge.

== Explication as an interpretative process ==
Based on the etymology of the word explication, studies using explication, and extended argumentation we can deduce that explication in the arts, humanities and social sciences is largely an ''interpretative'' process where the outcomes - the new explicit knowledge - is open to subsequent dispute, with the possibility of additional and/or different meanings being derived in the future.

On this argument, new explicit knowledge is therefore contingent and context specific.  New explicit knowledge is also informed by the explicant's competence in dealing with the explication process, plus an ethical concern that the outcomes (i.e. the new explicit knowledge) can be considered to be an improvement and "true" (i.e.  not yet disaffirmed). (cf. Harrison, 2006).

== Semantic explication ==
In the [[Natural semantic metalanguage]] theory, explications are semantic representations of vocabulary. These explications are made up of a very limited set of words called [[semantic primes]] which are considered to have universal meaning across all languages.

An example of an explication of the word ''happy''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lexical Meaning|last=Murphy|first=M. Lynne|publisher=Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;'':''&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
X feels happy = 
     sometimes someone thinks something like this:
          something good happened to something
          I wanted this
          I don't want other things now
     because of this, someone feels something good
     X feels like this
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;What sets the Natural Semantic Metalanguage Theory's explications apart from previous theories, is that these explications can fit into natural language, even if it sounds very awkward. For example:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
The clown looks [happy]

The clown looks like [the clown thinks something like this: 'something good happened to me; I wanted this; I don't want other things now'; because of this, the clown feels something good].
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;Explications in the Natural Semantic Metalanguage are neither exact dictionary definitions, nor encyclopedic explanations of a concept. They often differ slightly depending upon the personal experiences of the person writing them. In this way, they can be said to "rely heavily on 'folk theories,' that is, the rather naive understandings that most of us have about how life, the universe, and everything work."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Explications of abstract concepts, such as color, do not list any scientific facts about the object or concrete definitions. Instead, the explications use comparisons and examples from the real world.

== Explication, explication de texte, and literary criticism ==

The terms 'Explication' and 'Explication de texte' have different meanings.

As argued by Carnap (1950), in science and philosophy, 
"explication consists in transforming a given more or less inexact concept into an exact one or, rather, in replacing the first by the second. We call the given concept (or the term used for it) the explicandum, and the exact concept proposed to take the place of the first (or the term proposed for it) the explicatum. The explicandum may belong to everyday language or to a previous stage in the development of scientific language. The explicatum must be given by explicit rules for its use, for example, by a definition which incorporates it into a well-constructed system of scientific either logicomathematical or empirical concepts."

In this context, 'explication' is now regarded as "an appropriate methodology for formal philosophy". (Maher, 2007).

By contrast, in [[literary criticism]], the term 'explication' is used as a proxy for the term ''[[explication de texte]]'', where additional understandings and meanings are derived from the "[[close reading]]" of (say) a poem, novel or play.

In this process, explication often involves a line-by-line or episode-by-episode commentary on what is going on in a text. While initially this might seem reasonably innocuous, ''[[explication de texte]]'', and explication per se, is an interpretative process where the resulting new knowledge, new insights or new meanings, are open to subsequent debate and disaffirmation by others.

'''George Chatterton-Hill''' (1883&amp;ndash;1947) was the [[Ireland|Irish]] writer of several books on [[evolution]] and [[sociology]]. He wrote at the start of the 20th century, when the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work, had created turmoil over [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of evolution by [[natural selection]]. He was also very influenced by the writings of [[Herbert Spencer]] regarding evolution and society, and of [[Benjamin Kidd]] regarding society and religion.

He emphasises the impossibility of [[liberalism]], which recommends individual freedom insofar as it does not restrict the individual freedom of others. The objection, he says, is that it is inconsistent with competition. Liberalism, he says, is not possible in the context of evolutionary theory, given man's ceaseless urge for expansion which conflicts with the idea of equality for all. In reality, he claims, the superior group or class always oppresses the inferior masses, who eventually revolt. All revolutions result simply in the replacement of the ruling class by a new ruling class. He refers to the [[Germany|German]] concept of [[Rechtsstaat]], and his ideas reflect the prominence of [[social Darwinism]] of the time. 

Chatterton-Hill spent [[World War I]] in [[German Empire|Germany]] out of [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalist]] sentiment and corresponded with [[Roger Casement]]. He was said to have worked for German politician [[Matthias Erzberger]] as his private secretary according to Charles Curry's book and described there also as "born in Ceylon of an Irish father and native mother but never to have put foot on Irish soil".&lt;ref&gt;pp 219-226, Charles Curry, 'Sir Roger Casement’s Diaries - His Mission to Germany and the Findlay Affair', Arche, Munich, 1922; http://www.irishbrigade.eu/other-men/chatterton-hill/chatterton-hill.html&lt;/ref&gt;

"He was ... married to a German lady, and lived in Germany for some time prior to the outbreak of [the Second World War]. When war broke out he was actually in hospital, suffering very acutely. He was allowed out of hospital by the Germans in January or February, 1940, but was immediately put into a concentration camp, where he was labelled as an undesirable alien. He was kept there until January, 1941, when, on account of the very extreme state into which his health had got, ... it was thought that he would be better outside than in. He had no means of earning his livelihood, and engaged himself in translating the British news into German for the Germans in Berlin. This, presumably, went on, ... until the end of the war when [the British] arrived in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1948/apr/09/germany-dr-chatterton-hill HC Deb 09 April 1948 vol 449 cc571-90]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatterton-Hill died on 12 January 1947. His German wife was airlifted to the United Kingdom on 19 February 1947 sent to a hostel in Renfrewshire and given an ex gratia payment of £1,084 which enabled her to have an income of a 35s. a week annuity.&lt;ref&gt;House of Commons debates, 5 March 1947, cols.451-3 and http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1948/apr/09/germany-dr-chatterton-hill#S5CV0449P0_19480409_HOC_269&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Heidegger: A (Very) Critical Introduction''''' is a 2008 book by [[Sean McGrath (philosopher)|Sean J. McGrath]], in which the author provides a [[theological]] analysis of [[Martin Heidegger]]'s thought and its relation with his political endeavors.&lt;ref name=charlesguignon/&gt;

==Synopsis==
This book can be said to be an extension of McGrath's previous work ''[[The Early Heidegger and Medieval Philosophy]]''. McGrath argues for a clear connection between [[Heidegger’s Nazi sympathies]] and his relationship to [[Christianity]].

==Reception==
''Heidegger: A (Very) Critical Introduction'' was commissioned by the Centre for Theology and Philosophy at the [[University of Nottingham]], the theological think-tank headed by the Anglican theologian [[John Milbank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Department of Philosophy |url=https://www.mun.ca/philosophy/people/mcgrath.php |website=[[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] |accessdate=30 September 2018 |language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been reviewed in ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'', ''Dialog: A Journal of Theology'', ''[[Religious Studies Review]]'', ''[[The Heythrop Journal]]'' and ''[[Expository Times]]''.&lt;ref name=charlesguignon&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Guignon |first1=Charles |authorlink=Charles Guignon|title=Review of Heidegger: A (Very) Critical Introduction |journal=[[Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews]] |date=17 March 2009 |url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/heidegger-a-very-critical-introduction/ |accessdate=3 September 2018 |issn=1538-1617}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mattes |first1=Mark |title=Heidegger: A (Very) Critical Introduction by S.J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18649">The [[type theory]] was initially created to avoid paradoxes in a variety of formal [[mathematical logic|logic]]s and [[rewrite system]]s.  Later, type theory referred to a class of [[formal systems]], some of which can serve as alternatives to [[naive set theory]] as a foundation for all mathematics.

It has been tied to formal mathematics since ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' to today's [[proof assistant]]s.

== 1900–1927 ==

=== Origin of Russell's theory of types ===

In a letter to [[Gottlob Frege]] (1902) Russell announced his discovery of the paradox in Frege's [[Begriffsschrift]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell's (1902) ''Letter to Frege'' appears, with commentary, in van Heijenoort 1967:124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; Frege promptly responded, acknowledging the problem and proposing a solution in a technical discussion of "levels". To quote Frege:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Incidentally, it seems to me that the expression "a [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]] is predicated of itself" is not exact. A predicate is as a rule a first-level function, and this function requires an object as argument and cannot have itself as argument (subject). Therefore I would prefer to say "a concept is predicated of its own extension".&lt;ref&gt;Frege (1902) ''Letter to Russell'' appears, with commentary, in van Heijenoort 1967:126–128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He goes about showing how this might work but seems to pull back from it. &lt;!--(In a footnote, van Heijenoort notes that Frege, in his ''Grundgesetze der Arithmetik'' (1893), had used the symbol ∩ "for reducing second-level functions to first-level functions"&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:128&lt;/ref&gt;).--&gt; As a consequence of what has become known as [[Russell's paradox]] both Frege and Russell had to quickly amend works that they had at the printers. In an Appendix B that Russell tacked onto his ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'' (1903) one finds his "tentative" theory of types. The matter plagued Russell for about five years.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Quine's commentary before Russell (1908) ''Mathematical Logic as based on the theory of types'' in van Heijenoort 1967:150&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willard Quine]]&lt;ref&gt;cf. commentary by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] before Russell's (1908) ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types'' in van Hiejenoort 1967:150–153&lt;/ref&gt; presents a historical synopsis of the origin of the theory of types and the "ramified" theory of types: after considering abandoning the theory of types (1905), Russell proposed in turn three theories:
{{ordered list|list_style_type=lower-roman
| the zigzag theory
| theory of limitation of size,
| the no-class theory (1905–1906) and then,
| readopting the theory of types (1908ff)
}}

Quine observes that Russell's introduction of the notion of "apparent variable" had the following result:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the distinction between 'all' and 'any': 'all' is expressed by the bound ('apparent') variable of universal quantification, which ranges over a type, and 'any' is expressed by the free ('real') variable which refers schematically to any unspecified thing irrespective of type.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quine dismisses this notion of "bound variable" as "''pointless apart from a certain aspect of the theory of types''".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Quine's commentary before Russell (1908) ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types'' in van Heijenoort 1967:151&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The 1908 "ramified" theory of types ===

Quine explains the ''ramified'' theory as follows: "It has been so called because the type of a function depends both on the types of its arguments and on the types of the apparent variables contained in it (or in its expression), in case these exceed the types of the arguments".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Stephen Kleene]] in his 1952 ''Introduction to Metamathematics'' describes the ''ramified'' theory of types this way:

:The primary objects or individuals (i.e. the given things not being subjected to logical analysis) are assigned to one type (say ''type 0''), the properties of individuals to ''type 1'', properties of properties of individuals to ''type 2'', etc.; and no properties are admitted which do not fall into one of these logical types (e.g. this puts the properties 'predicable' and 'impredicable' ... outside the pale of logic). A more detailed account would describe the admitted types for other objects as relations and classes. Then to exclude [[impredicativity|impredicative]] definitions within a type, the types above type 0 are further separated into orders. Thus for type 1, properties defined without mentioning any totality belong to ''order 0'', and properties defined using the totality of properties of a given order belong to the next higher order. ... But this separation into orders makes it impossible to construct the familiar analysis, which we saw above contains impredicative definitions. To escape this outcome, Russell postulated his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]'', which asserts that to any property belonging to an order above the lowest, there is a coextensive property (i.e. one possessed by exactly the same objects) of order 0. If only definable properties are considered to exist, then the axiom means that to every impredicative definition within a given type there is an equivalent predicative one (Kleene 1952:44–45).

=== The axiom of reducibility and the notion of "matrix" ===

But because the stipulations of the ramified theory would prove (to quote Quine) "onerous", Russell in his 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''&lt;ref&gt;Russell (1908) ''Mathematical Logic as based on the theory of types'' in van Heijenoort 1967:153–182&lt;/ref&gt; also would propose his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]''. By 1910 Whitehead and Russell in their ''Principia Mathematica'' would further augment this axiom with the notion of a '' matrix '' — a fully extensional specification of a function. From its matrix a function could be derived by the process of "generalization" and vice versa, i.e. the two processes are reversible — (i) generalization from a matrix to a function (by using apparent variables) and (ii) the reverse process of reduction of type by courses-of-values substitution of arguments for the apparent variable. By this method impredicativity could be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;cf. in particular p. 51 in Chapter II ''The theory of Logical Types'' and *12 ''The Hierarchy of Types and the Axiom of Reducibility'' pp. 162–167. Whitehead and Russell (1910–1913, 1927 2nd edition) ''Principia Mathematica''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Truth tables ===

Eventually [[Emil Post]] (1921) would lay waste to Russell's "cumbersome"&lt;ref&gt;Post (1921) ''Introduction to a general theory of elementary propositions'' in van Heijenoort 1967:264–283, in particular p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of Types with his "truth functions" and their truth tables. In his "Introduction" to his 1921 Post places the blame on Russell's notion of apparent variable: "Whereas the complete theory [of Whitehead and Russell (1910, 1912, 1913)] requires for the enunciation of its propositions real and apparent variables, which represent both individuals and [[propositional function]]s of different kinds, and as a result necessitates the cumbersome theory of types, this subtheory uses only real variables, and these real variables represent but one kind of entity, which the authors have chosen to call elementary propositions".

At about the same time [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] made short work of the theory of types in his 1922 work [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]] in which he points out the following in parts 3.331–3.333:

{{quote|3.331 From this observation we get a further view – into Russell's Theory of Types. Russell's error is shown by the fact that in drawing up his symbolic rules he has to speak of the meanings of his signs.

3.332 No proposition can say anything about itself, because the propositional sign cannot be contained in itself (that is the whole "theory of types").

3.333 A function cannot be its own argument, because the functional sign already contains the prototype of its own argument and it cannot contain itself...}}

Wittgenstein proposed the truth-table method as well. In his 4.3 through 5.101, Wittgenstein adopts an unbounded [[Sheffer stroke]] as his fundamental logical entity and then lists all 16 functions of two variables (5.101).

The notion of matrix-as-truth-table appears as late as the 1940–1950s in the work of Tarski, e.g. his 1946 indexes "Matrix, see: Truth table"&lt;ref&gt;Tarski 1946, ''Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of Deductive Sciences'', Dover republication 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russell's doubts ===

Russell in his 1920 ''Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'' devotes an entire chapter to "The axiom of Infinity and logical types" wherein he states his concerns: "Now the theory of types emphatically does not belong to the finished and certain part of our subject: much of this theory is still inchoate, confused, and obscure. But the need of ''some'' doctrine of types is less doubtful than the precise form the doctrine should take; and in connection with the axiom of infinity it is particularly easy to see the necessity of some such doctrine".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1920:135&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Russell abandons the axiom of reducibility''': In the second edition of ''Principia Mathematica'' (1927) he acknowledges Wittgenstein's argument.&lt;ref&gt;cf. "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xiv and Appendix C&lt;/ref&gt; At the outset of his Introduction he declares "there can be no doubt ... that there is no need of the distinction between real and apparent variables...".&lt;ref&gt;cf. "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:i&lt;/ref&gt; Now he fully embraces the matrix notion and declares "A ''function can only appear in a matrix through its values''" (but demurs in a footnote: "It takes the place (not quite adequately) of the axiom of reducibility"&lt;ref&gt;cf. "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xxix&lt;/ref&gt;). Furthermore, he introduces a new (abbreviated, generalized) notion of "matrix", that of a "logical matrix . . . one that contains no constants. Thus ''p''|''q'' is a logical matrix".&lt;ref&gt;The vertical bar " | " is the Sheffer stroke; cf. "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xxxi&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Russell has virtually abandoned the axiom of reducibility,&lt;ref&gt;"The theory of classes is at once simplified in one direction and complicated in another by the assumption that functions only occur through their values and by the abandonment of the axiom of reducibility"; cf. "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xxxix&lt;/ref&gt; but in his last paragraphs he states that from "our present primitive propositions" he cannot derive "Dedekindian relations and well-ordered relations" and observes that if there is a new axiom to replace the axiom of reducibility "it remains to be discovered".&lt;ref&gt;These quotes from "Introduction" to 2nd edition, Russell 1927:xliv–xlv.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theory of simple types ===
In the 1920s, [[Leon Chwistek]]&lt;ref&gt;L. Chwistek, Antynomje logikiformalnej, ''Przeglad Filozoficzny'' 24 (1921) 164–171&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frank P. Ramsey]]&lt;ref&gt;F. P. Ramsey, The foundations of mathematics, ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'', Series 2 25 (1926) 338–384.&lt;/ref&gt; noticed that, if one is willing to give up the [[vicious circle principle]],
the hierarchy of levels of types in the "ramified theory of types" can be collapsed.

The resulting restricted logic is called the theory of simple types&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1944, pages 126 and 136–138, footnote 17: "Russell's mathematical logic" appearing in ''Kurt Gödel: Collected Works: Volume II Publications 1938–1974'', Oxford University Press, New York NY, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514721-6}}(v.2.pbk).&lt;/ref&gt; or, perhaps more commonly, simple type theory.&lt;ref&gt;This does not mean the theory is "simple", it means that the theory is ''restricted'': types of different orders are not to be mixed: "Mixed types (such as classes containing individuals and classes as elements) and therefore also transfinite types (such as the class of all classes of finite types) are excluded." Gödel 1944, pages 127, footnote 17: "Russell's mathematical logic" appearing in ''Kurt Gödel: Collected Works: Volume II Publications 1938–1974'', Oxford University Press, New York NY, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514721-6}}(v.2.pbk).&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed formulations of simple type theory were published in the late 1920s and early 1930s
by R. Carnap, F. Ramsey, W.V.O. Quine, and A. Tarski. In 1940 [[Alonzo Church]] (re)formulated it as [[simply typed lambda calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Church, A formulation of the simple theory of types, Journal of Symbolic Logic 5 (1940) 56–68.&lt;/ref&gt; and examined by Gödel in 1944. A survey of these developments is found in Collins (2012).&lt;ref&gt;J. Collins, A History of the Theory of Types: Developments after the Second Edition of 'Principia Mathematica'. LAP Lambert Academic Publishing (2012). {{ISBN|978-3-8473-2963-3}}, esp. chs. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1940s–present ===
&lt;!--&gt;Quine reports that Ramsey 1931 urged the "dropping of the ramification and the axiom of reducibility"; Quine opines that "Russell's failure [was] due to this failure to distinguish between propositional functions as notations and propositional functions as attributes and relations.[Quine's commentary before Russell 1908 in van Heijenoort 1967:151–152]."&lt;/!--&gt;

==== Gödel 1944 ====
[[Kurt Gödel]] in his 1944 ''Russell's mathematical logic'' gave the following definition of the "theory of simple types" in a footnote:
:By the theory of simple types I mean the doctrine which says that the objects of thought (or, in another interpretation, the symbolic expressions) are divided into types, namely: individuals, properties of individuals, relations between individuals, properties of such relations, etc. (with a similar hierarchy for extensions), and that sentences of the form: " ''a'' has the property ''φ'' ", " ''b'' bears the relation ''R'' to ''c'' ", etc. are meaningless, if ''a, b, c, R, φ'' are not of types fitting together. Mixed types (such as classes containing individuals and classes as elements) and therefore also transfinite types (such as the class of all classes of finite types) are excluded. That the theory of simple types suffices for avoiding also the epistemological paradoxes is shown by a closer analysis of these. (Cf. ''Ramsey 1926'' and ''Tarski 1935'', p. 399).".&lt;ref&gt;Gödel 1944:126 footnote 17: "Russell's mathematical logic" appearing in ''Kurt Gödel: Collected Works: Volume II Publications 1938–1974'', Oxford University Press, New York NY, {{ISBN|978-0-19-514721-6}}(v.2.pbk).&lt;/ref&gt;

He concluded the (1) theory of simple types and (2) axiomatic set theory, "permit the derivation of modern mathematics and at the same time avoid all known paradoxes" (Gödel 1944:126); furthermore, the theory of simple types "is the system of the first ''Principia'' [''Principia Mathematica''] in an appropriate interpretation. . . . [M]any symptoms show only too clearly, however, that the primitive concepts need further elucidation" (Gödel 1944:126).

==== Curry–Howard correspondence, 1934–1969 ====
The [[Curry–Howard correspondence]] is the interpretation of proofs-as-programs and formulae-as-types.  The idea starting in 1934 with [[Haskell Curry]] and finalized in 1969 with [[William Alvin Howard]].  It connected the "computational component" of many type theories to the derivations in logics.

Howard showed that the typed lambda calculus corresponded to intuitionistic [[natural deduction]].  (That is, natural deduction without the [[Law of excluded middle]].)  The connection between types and logic lead to a lot of subsequent research to find new type theories for existing logics and new logics for existing type theories.

==== de Bruijn's AUTOMATH, 1967–2003 ====
[[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn]] created the type theory [[Automath]] as a mathematical foundation for the Automath system, which could verify the correctness of proofs.  The system developed and added features over time as type theory developed.

==== Martin-Löf's Intuitionistic type theory, 1971–1984 ====
[[Per Martin-Löf]] found a type theory that corresponded to [[predicate logic]] by introducing [[dependent types]], which became known as [[intuitionistic type theory]] or Martin-Löf type theory.

Martin-Löf's theory uses inductive types to represent unbounded data structures, such as natural numbers.

==== Barendregt's lambda cube, 1991 ====
The [[lambda cube]] was not a new type theory but a categorization of existing type theories.  The eight corners of the cube included some existing theories with [[simply typed lambda calculus]] at the lowest corner and the [[calculus of constructions]] at the highest.

'''Jacques Maritain''' ({{IPA-fr|maʁitɛ̃|lang}}; 18 November 1882&amp;nbsp;– 28 April 1973) was a French [[Catholic]] [[philosopher]]. Raised [[Protestant]], he was agnostic before converting to Catholicism in 1906. An author of more than 60 books, he helped to revive [[Thomas Aquinas]] for modern times, and was influential in the development and drafting of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. [[Pope Paul VI]] presented his "Message to Men of Thought and of Science" at the close of [[Vatican II]] to Maritain, his long-time friend and mentor. The same pope had seriously considered making him a lay Cardinal, but Maritain rejected it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ewtn.com/library/THEOLOGY/FR91201.HTM |title=The Christian Personalism of Jacques Maritain |author=Donald DeMarco |publisher=[[EWTN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maritain's interest and works spanned many aspects of [[philosophy]], including [[aesthetics]], [[political theory]], [[philosophy of science]], [[metaphysics]], the nature of [[education]], [[liturgy]] and [[ecclesiology]].

==Life==
Maritain was born in Paris, the son of Paul Maritain, who was a lawyer, and his wife Geneviève Favre, the daughter of [[Jules Favre]], and was reared in a liberal Protestant milieu. He was sent to the [[Lycée Henri-IV]]. Later, he attended the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], studying the natural sciences: chemistry, biology and physics.

At the Sorbonne, he met [[Raïssa Maritain|Raïssa Oumançoff]], a [[Russia]]n Jewish émigré. They married in 1904. A noted poet and mystic, she participated as his intellectual partner in his search for [[truth]]. Raissa's sister, Vera Oumançoff, lived with Jacques and Raissa for almost all their married life.

At the Sorbonne, Jacques and Raïssa soon became disenchanted with [[scientism]], which could not, in their view, address the larger existential issues of life. In 1901, in light of this disillusionment, they made a pact to commit suicide together if they could not discover some deeper meaning to life within a year. They were spared from following through on this because, at the urging of [[Charles Péguy]], they attended the lectures of [[Henri Bergson]] at the [[Collège de France]]. Bergson's critique of scientism dissolved their intellectual despair and instilled in them "the sense of the absolute." Then, through the influence of [[Léon Bloy]], they converted to the Roman Catholic faith in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanna|1996|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1907 the Maritains moved to [[Heidelberg]], where Jacques studied biology under [[Hans Driesch]]. Hans Driesch’s theory of neo-vitalism attracted Jacques because of its affinity with Henri Bergson. During this time, Raïssa fell ill, and during her convalescence, their [[spirtuality|spiritual]] advisor, a [[Dominican friar]] named Fr. Humbert Clérissac, introduced her to the writings of Thomas Aquinas. She read them with enthusiasm and, in turn, exhorted her husband to examine the saint’s writings. In Thomas, Maritain found a number of insights and ideas that he had believed all along. He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Thenceforth, in affirming to myself, without chicanery or diminution, the authentic value of the reality of our human instruments of knowledge, I was already a Thomist without knowing it...When several months later I came to the ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'', I would construct no impediment to its luminous flood."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From the Angelic Doctor (the honorary title of Aquinas), he was led to "The Philosopher", as Aquinas called [[Aristotle]]. Still later, to further his intellectual development, he read the [[Neo-Thomist]]s.

Beginning in 1912, Maritain taught at the [[Collège Stanislas de Paris|Collège Stanislas]]. He later moved to the [[Institut Catholique de Paris]]. For the 1916–1917 academic year, he taught at the [[Petit Séminaire de Versailles]].  In 1930 Maritain and [[Étienne Gilson]] received honorary doctorates in philosophy from the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']].&lt;ref&gt;Piero Viotto, ''Grandi amicizie: i Maritain e i loro contemporanei'', 38, https://books.google.com/books?id=aonOg8KLOdIC&amp;pg=PA38 Accessed 28 February 2016.

He also taught at [[Columbia University]]; at the Committee on Social Thought, [[University of Chicago]]; at the [[University of Notre Dame]], and at [[Princeton University]].

From 1945 to 1948, he was the French ambassador to the Holy See.

Afterwards, he returned to Princeton University where he achieved the "Elysian status" (as he put it) of a professor emeritus in 1956. Raissa Maritain died in 1960. After her death, Jacques published her journal under the title "Raissa's Journal." For several years Maritain was an honorary chairman of the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], appearing as a keynote speaker at its 1960 conference in Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/What-was-the-Congress-for-Cultural-Freedom--5597 Hilton Kramer, "What was the Congress for Cultural Freedom?"  ''The New Criterion'', Volume 8, January 1990, page 7, January 1990.]&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1961, Maritain lived with the [[Little Brothers of Jesus]] in Toulouse, France. He had an influence on the order since its foundation in 1933. He became a Little Brother in 1970.

Jacques and Raïssa Maritain are buried in the cemetery of [[Kolbsheim]], a little French village in [[Alsace]] where he had spent many summers at the estate of his friends, Antoinette and Alexander Grunelius.&lt;ref&gt;The most comprehensive biography of the Maritians is: Jean-Luc Barre, "Jacques And Raissa Maritain: Beggars For Heaven", University of Notre Dame Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A cause for [[beatification]] of him and his wife Raissa is being planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|KRbxS5FfAf0|Beatification process for Jacques and Raissa Maritain could begin}} (8 February 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
The foundation of Maritain's thought is Aristotle, Aquinas, and the [[Thomism|Thomistic]] commentators, especially [[John of St. Thomas]]. He is eclectic in his use of these sources. Maritain's philosophy is based on evidence accrued by the senses and acquired by an understanding of first principles. Maritain defended [[philosophy]] as a science against those who would degrade it and promoted philosophy as the "queen of sciences".

In 1910, Jacques Maritain completed his first contribution to modern philosophy, a 28-page article titled, "Reason and Modern Science" published in ''Revue de Philosophie'' (June issue). In it, he warned that science was becoming a divinity, its methodology usurping the role of reason and philosophy. Science was supplanting the humanities in importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hanna|1996|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, a committee of French bishops commissioned Jacques to write a series of textbooks to be used in Catholic colleges and seminaries. He wrote and completed only one of these projects, titled ''Elements de Philosophie'' (Introduction of Philosophy) in 1920. It has been a standard text ever since in many Catholic seminaries. He wrote in his introduction:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the philosophy of Aristotle, as revived and enriched by [[Thomas Aquinas]] and his school, may rightly be called the [[Christian philosophy]], both because the church is never weary of putting it forward as the only true philosophy and because it harmonizes perfectly with the truths of faith, nevertheless it is proposed here for the reader's acceptance not because it is Christian, but because it is demonstrably true. This agreement between a philosophic system founded by a pagan and the dogmas of revelation is no doubt an external sign, an extra-philosophic guarantee of its truth; but from its own rational evidence, that it derives its authority as a philosophy&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the Second World War, Jacques Maritain protested the policies of the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] government while teaching at the Pontifical Institute for Medieval Studies in Canada. "Moving to New York, Maritain became deeply involved in rescue activities, seeking to bring persecuted and threatened academics, many of them Jews, to America. He was instrumental in founding the [[École Libre des Hautes Études]], a kind of university in exile that was, at the same time, the center of Gaullist resistance in the United States". After the war, in a papal audience on 16 July 1946, he tried unsuccessfully to have [[Pope Pius XII]] officially denounce [[anti-semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Richard Francis Crane |title=Heart-Rending Ambivalence: Jacques Maritain and the Complexity of Postwar Catholic Philosemitism |journal=Studies in Christian-Jewish Relations |volume=6 |year=2011 |url=http://ejournals.bc.edu/ojs/index.php/scjr/article/view/1820/1698 |pages=8-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of his American papers are held by the [[University of Notre Dame]], which established [[The Jacques Maritain Center]] in 1957. The Cercle d'Etudes Jacques &amp; Raïssa Maritain is an association founded by the philosopher himself in 1962 in Kolbsheim (near [[Strasbourg]], France), where the couple is also buried. The purpose of these centers is to encourage study and research of Maritain’s thought and expand upon them. It is also absorbed in translating and editing his writings.

==Metaphysics and epistemology==
Maritain's philosophy is based on the view that [[metaphysics]] is prior to [[epistemology]]. Being is first apprehended implicitly in [[Empirical evidence|sense experience]], and is known in two ways. First, being is known reflexively by abstraction from sense experience. One experiences a particular being, e.g. a cup, a dog, etc. and through reflexion ("bending back") on the judgement, e.g. "this is a dog", one recognizes that the object in question is an existent. Second, in light of attaining being reflexively through apprehension of sense experience one may arrive at what Maritain calls "an Intuition of Being". For Maritain this is the point of departure for metaphysics; without the intuition of being one cannot be a metaphysician at all. The intuition of being involves rising to the apprehension of ''ens secundum quod est ens'' (being insofar as it is a being). In ''Existence and the Existent'' he explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is being, attained or perceived at the summit of an abstractive intellection, of an eidetic or intensive visualization which owes its purity and power of illumination only to the fact that the intellect, one day, was stirred to its depths and trans-illuminated by the impact of the act of existing apprehended in things, and because it was quickened to the point of receiving this act, or hearkening to it, within itself, in the intelligible and super-intelligible integrity of the tone particular to it." (p. 20)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In view of this priority given to metaphysics, Maritain advocates an epistemology he calls "Critical Realism". Maritain's epistemology is not "critical" in Kant's sense, which held that one could only know anything after undertaking a thorough critique of one's cognitive abilities. Rather, it is critical in the sense that it is not a naive or non-philosophical realism, but one that is defended by way of reason. Against Kant's critical project Maritain argues that epistemology is reflexive; you can only defend a theory of knowledge in light of knowledge you have already attained. Consequently, the critical question is not the question of modern philosophy{{spaced ndash}}how do we pass from what is perceived to what is. Rather, "Since the mind, from the very start, reveals itself as warranted in its certitude by things and measured by an esse{{clarify|reason=while this word exists in my dictionary, I still have no idea of what work it does for this sentence|date=April 2014}} independent of itself, how are we to judge if, how, on what conditions, and to what extent it is so both in principle and in the various moments of knowledge?"

In contrast idealism inevitably ends up in contradiction, since it does not recognize the universal scope of the first principles of identity, contradiction, and finality. These become merely laws of thought or language, but not of being, which opens the way to contradictions being instantiated in reality.

Maritain's metaphysics ascends from this account of being to a critique of the philosophical aspects of modern science, through analogy to an account of the existence and nature of God as it is known philosophically and through mystical experience.

==Ethics==
Maritain was a strong defender of a natural law ethics. He viewed ethical norms as being rooted in human nature. For Maritain the natural law is known primarily, not through philosophical argument and demonstration, but rather through "Connaturality". Connatural knowledge is a kind of knowledge by acquaintance. We know the natural law through our direct acquaintance with it in our human experience. Of central importance, is Maritain's argument that natural rights are rooted in the natural law. This was key to his involvement in the drafting of the UN's [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

Another important aspect of his ethics was his insistence upon the need for moral philosophy to be conducted in a theological context. While a Christian could engage in speculative thought about nature or metaphysics in a purely rational manner and develop an adequate philosophy of nature of metaphysics, this is not possible with ethics. Moral philosophy must address the actual state of the human person, and this is a person in a state of grace. Thus, "moral philosophy adequately considered" must take into account properly theological truths. It would be impossible, for instance, to develop an adequate moral philosophy without giving consideration to properly theological facts such as original sin and the supernatural end of the human person in beatitude. Any moral philosophy that does not take into account these realities that are only known through faith would be fundamentally incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;Maritain, An Essay on Christian Philosophy, (NY: Philosophical Library, 1955), pp. 38 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political theory==
Maritain advocated what he called "Integral Humanism."  He argued that secular forms of humanism were inevitably anti-human in that they refused to recognize the whole person. Once the spiritual dimension of human nature is rejected, we no longer have an integral, but merely partial humanism, one which rejects a fundamental aspect of the human person. Accordingly, in ''Integral Humanism'' he explores the prospects for a new [[Christendom]], rooted in his philosophical pluralism, in order to find ways Christianity could inform political discourse and policy in a pluralistic age. In this account he develops a theory of cooperation, to show how people of different intellectual positions can nevertheless cooperate to achieve common practical aims. Maritain's political theory was extremely influential, and was a primary source behind the [[Christian democracy|Christian Democratic movement]].

Maritain also corresponded with, and was a friend of&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cssronline.org/CSSR/Current/Articles%20-%20Wolfe.pdf  Wolfe, C.J. “Lessons from the Friendship of Jacques Maritain with Saul Alinsky” he Catholic Social Science Review 16 (2011): 229-240] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233422/http://www.cssronline.org/CSSR/Current/Articles%20-%20Wolfe.pdf |date=26 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the American radical [[Community organizing|community organizer]] [[Saul Alinsky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Thomistic Papers|volume=3|chapter=Jacques Maritain and His Two Authentic Revolutionaries|pages=91–116|location=Houston, Tex.|publisher=[[Center for Catholic Studies (University of St. Thomas)|Center for Thomistic Studies]]|editor-last=Kennedy|editor-first=Leonard A|last=Doering|first=Bernard E.|oclc=17307550|year=1987|url=http://www.u.arizona.edu/~aversa/modernism/Maritain%20and%20His%20Two%20Authentic%20Revolutionaries%20(Thomistic%20Papers%20III.).pdf|isbn=0-268-01865-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and French Prime Minister [[Robert Schuman]].&lt;ref name="Fimister"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZ7ncyFsEGMC&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=%22jacques%20maritain%20is%20considered%20a%20heretic%22&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jacques%20Maritain%20is%20considered%20a%20heretic.%22&amp;f=false|title=Robert Schuman: Neo-Scholastic Humanism and the Reunification of Europe|last=Fimister|first=Alan Paul|year=2008|oclc=244339575|isbn=978-90-5201-439-5|pages=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Major criticisms of Maritain have included: 
#An overdependence upon late scholastic commentators at the expense of fidelity to Aquinas' own text. However, Maritain is frequently developing his own thought to address contemporary problems. His work is that of a philosopher who makes use of historical sources to develop his own positions rather than that of a historian of philosophy.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} 
#Fr. Santiago Ramírez argued strongly that Maritain's moral philosophy adequately considered could not be distinguished in any meaningful way from moral theology as such.&lt;ref&gt;Denis J. M. Bradley. Aquinas on the Twofold Human Good: Reason and Human Happiness in Aquinas's Moral Science. Washington, D. C.: The Catholic University of America Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Tracy Rowland has argued that the lack of a fully developed philosophy of culture in Maritain and others (notably Rahner) was responsible for an inadequate notion of culture in the documents of Vatican II and thereby for much of the misapplication of the conciliar texts in the life of the Church following the Council.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Rowland, "Culture and the Thomist Tradition: After Vatican II" (Routledge Radical Orthodoxy)&lt;/ref&gt;
#Maritain's political theory has been criticized for a democratic pluralism that appeals to something very similar to the later liberal philosopher [[John Rawls]]' conception of an overlapping consensus of reasonable views. It is argued that such a view illegitimately presupposes the necessity of pluralistic conceptions of the human good.&lt;ref&gt;Thaddeus J. Kozinski, The Political Problem of Religious Pluralism: And Why Philosophers Can't Solve It, (Lexington Books, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lingkhor''' ({{zh|s=外廓|t=外廓}}) is a [[sacred]] path, the most common name of the outer [[pilgrim]] circumambulation path in [[Lhasa]], matching its inner twin, the [[Barkhor]]. In its heyday, the Lingkhor was about {{convert|8|km|mi}} long, enclosing Old Lhasa, the [[Potala]] and [[Chokpori]] Hill. In former times, it was crowded with men and women circumambulating clock-wise, sometimes by means of full-body [[prostration]]s.  [[Pilgrim]]s often approached the holy city for the first time by this route which passed through willow-shaded parks where Tibetans used to [[picnic]] in summer and watch open-air operas on festival days. 

Beginning in the 1980s, Lhasa's urban sprawl and reconstruction have obliterated much of the Lingkhor, but one relatively pristine stretch still remains west of Chokpori Hill; here, a bridge about 1&amp;nbsp;km west of the Potala Palace on the main road with green buildings beyond is the landmark. The Lingkhor stretches left before the bridge between walls and [[willow]] trees. After making a turn to the right, it peters out at a [[duck]] [[pond]]. Open-air Tibetan [[opera]]s are still performed within earshot of the pond on festival days, one of which falls in June each year.

'''Loyola House''' or its full name '''Loyola House Retreat and Training Centre''' is a Jesuit spirituality centre in [[Guelph|Guelph, Ontario]]. It moved to Guelph in 1964 and was the centre of a renewal in [[Ignatian spirituality]] in the 1970s. It is within the grounds of the [[Ignatius Jesuit Centre]] situated on [[Ontario Highway 6|Woolwich Street]] to the west of [[Riverside Park (Guelph)|Riverside Park]]. In the 1960s and 1970s it was the centre of a significant shift in [[Ignatian spirituality]].&lt;ref name=dict&gt;"English, John J. C." in ''Dictionary of Jesuit Biography: Ministry to English Canada, Volume II: 1988–2006'' (Toronto: Canadian Institute of Jesuit Studies, 2007), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=well&gt;"[http://www.wellingtonadvertiser.com/index.cfm?page=detail&amp;itmno=2094 Spiritual Director Father John Veltri died]" from ''Wellington Adviser'', Volume 41, Issue 45, retrieved 25 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Originally, the centre was situated in [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]]. In 1962, the decision was made by the [[Society of Jesus]] to sell the site and move the centre to Guelph. The old site in Oakville became the [[Glen Abbey Golf Course]]. From 1962 construction began on the spirituality centre in Guelph, helped by financial assistance from Bishop Joseph Ryan of Hamilton. In 1964, it was opened and was called the Guelph Centre of Spirituality. At first, it only hosted weekend retreats for parishioners from churches within the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Hamilton, Ontario|Diocese of Hamilton]].&lt;ref name=dict/&gt;

From the late 1960s to the 1970s it became the centre of a change in how retreats in Ignatian spirituality were conducted and changed its name to Loyola House. Two Jesuit priests, John English, S.J. and John Veltri, S.J. altered the experience for those on retreat. They came from [[St Beuno's College]] in Wales with new ideas about Ignatian spirituality. Before this time, retreats were preached; at certain times in the day, those on retreat would all be told what to pray. Veltri and English changed this by providing points for prayer through daily interviews with the retreatants, giving personal one-to-one spiritual direction. Veltri was at Loyola House from 1967,&lt;ref name=well/&gt; and English was the novice master at the [[St. Stanislaus Novitiate]] next door in 1965, moving over to Loyola House in 1978.&lt;ref name=dict/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Veltri, S.J. and John English, S.J., ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/In_Dialogue_with_Father_John_English_S_J.html?id=IvVlNwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y In Dialogue with Father John English, S. J.]'' (Guelph: Ignatius College, 1974), pp. 1–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
It continues to offers retreats in [[Ignatian spirituality]] within a 240-acre setting close to the [[Guelph Lake]] Conservation Area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loyolahouse.com/about/faq.html About] from LoyolaHouse.com retrieved 18 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''metatheory''' or '''meta-theory''' is a [[theory]] whose [[wikt:subject matter|subject matter]] is some theory. All fields of research share some [[meta]]-theory, regardless whether this is explicit or correct. In a more restricted and specific sense, in [[mathematics]] and [[mathematical logic]], ''metatheory'' means a ''mathematical theory about another mathematical theory''.

The following is an example of a meta-theoretical statement:{{according to whom|date=April 2017}}
{{quote|Any physical theory is always provisional, in the sense that it is only a hypothesis; you can never prove it.  No matter how many times the results of experiments agree with some theory, you can never be sure that the next time the result will not contradict the theory.  On the other hand, you can disprove a theory by finding even a single observation that disagrees with the predictions of the theory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Hawking]] in ''[[A Brief History of Time]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Meta-theoretical investigations are generally part of the [[philosophy of science]]. Also a metatheory is an object of concern to the area in which the individual theory is conceived.

== Taxonomy ==
Examining groups of related theories, a first finding may be to identify classes of theories, thus specifying a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of theories.

==In mathematics==
The concept burst upon the scene of 20th-century philosophy as a result of the work of the [[Germany|German]] [[Mathematics|mathematician]] [[David Hilbert]], who in 1905 published a proposal for proof of the [[consistency]] and [[completeness (logic)|completeness]] of mathematics, creating the field of [[metamathematics]].  His hopes for the success of this proof were dashed by the work of [[Kurt Gödel]], who in 1931, used his [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|incompleteness theorems]] to prove this [[Hilbert's program|goal of consistency and completeness]] to be unattainable. Nevertheless, his program of unsolved mathematical problems, out of which grew this metamathematical proposal, continued to influence the direction of mathematics for the rest of the 20th century.

The study of metatheory became widespread during the rest of that century by its application in other fields, notably [[Linguistics|scientific linguistics]] and its concept of [[metalanguage]].

Also, he is scheduled to give the 2017 Gifford Lectures, where he will also talk about divine hiddenness.&lt;ref&gt;http://ndsmcobserver.com/2015/09/professors-begin-research-project-transformative-experiences/&lt;/ref&gt;

== The argument against naturalism ==

Michael Rea argues that naturalists are not justified in accepting either realism about material objects, or realism about other minds, or materialism.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Rea, ''World Without Design: The Ontological Consequences of Naturalism'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, p. 8. Discussed in a Book Review by Andrew Melnyk in Mind, Volume 113, Number 451, July 2004, pp. 575-581.&lt;/ref&gt; This constitutes a pragmatic case against being a naturalist. These problems can be avoided by the adoption of a supernaturalist research program that "legitimates belief in ''some'' sort of supernatural being".&lt;ref&gt;''World Without Design'', p. 213-214. Melnyk 2004, p. 575-576.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rea's understanding of naturalism ==

According to Rea, naturalism is primarily a research program.&lt;ref&gt;''World Without Design'', p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; By a research program he means a particular set of dispositions to "trust certain ways of acquiring information with respect to various topics and to distrust others".&lt;ref&gt;''World Without Design'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The core of naturalism is, therefore, something attitudinal.&lt;ref&gt;Melnyk 2004, p. 576.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that research programs "cannot be adopted on the basis of evidence".&lt;ref&gt;''World Without Design'', pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; This claim suggests that the naturalist commitment to science is just a secular faith, no better epistemically than standard religion.&lt;ref&gt;Melnyk 2004, 577.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prayatna''' means – effort or activity; it expresses a sense of human determination and initiative but is required to be supplemented by confidence in one’s own abilities and steadfastness of purpose which two factors combine to make it a driving force. ''Prayatna'' does not merely mean 'effort' but 'effort at a point of articulation'.

==Meaning==

'''Prayatna''' ([[Sanskrit]]: प्रयत्नः) means – 'effort', 'exertion', 'endeavour', 'perseverance', 'activity' or 'action in general'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=113|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.4.apte.456213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pāṇini]] explains that ''prayatna'' does not merely mean effort but effort at a point of articulation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Panini: A Survey of Research|author=George Cardona|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=197|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=adWXhQ-yHQUC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=prayatna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x2t5VIbjLoTiuQT6zYGoDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prayatna&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; it expresses a sense of human determination and initiative and needs to be supplemented by confidence in one’s own abilities and steadfastness of purpose which makes ''prayatna'' a driving force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Destiny and Human Initiative in the Mahabharata|author=Julian F.Woods|publisher=SUNY Press|page=60,103,230|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wCNTvMk0EscC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=prayatna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=d3B5VOjmLcajugSz_IHICw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prayatna&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implication==

''Prayatna'' implies energy (''[[vīrya]]'')  and  enthusiasm(''[[utsaha]]'') directed towards strenuous efforts (''anusthāna'') for attaining the state of equipoise (''[[sthiti]]'') in undisturbed calm  (''praśānta-vāhitā'') under the influence of [[Sattva|sattva-guna]]. It is a part of energetic and enthusiastic pursuit [[Abhyasa|abhyāsa]], and an act (''kriti'') prompted by the desire or will (''icchā'') that involves  physical exertion (''cheśțā'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Indian Education|author=Radha Kumud Mookerji|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=305|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mjFfqpq7HhkC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;dq=prayatna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x2t5VIbjLoTiuQT6zYGoDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prayatna&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Actions are of two kinds – i) vital actions prompted by life (''jīvana-pūrvaka''), and ii) voluntary actions initiated by desire and aversion (''icchā-dveśa-pūrvaka''). [[Involuntary action|Vital actions]] are non-voluntary produced by the conjunction of the self with the internal organ which depends on the self, and all [[voluntary action]]s are produced by desire and aversion that produce merits and demerits. Empirical pleasure   arises from the fulfilment of these actions but transcendental bliss arises from their extermination. ''Prayatna'' ('volition') finds its fullest expression within intentional action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Psychology, Vol.2|author=Jadunath Sinha|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=495|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=VCwmmWXJBqEC&amp;pg=PA505&amp;dq=atmavasana&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TWV5VKHfA8iXuASUtoHoBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=atmavasana&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Free Will, Agency, and Self-hood in Indian Philosophy|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=115|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=iWLSAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=prayatna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KWl5VLvqHIOruQT_1oGgBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prayatna&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Vaisheshika|Vaisesika school]] of [[Mīmāṃsā|Mimamsa thought]], ''[[karma]]'' is movement or action in which there is no effect to differentiate an intentional action from an unintentional one; ''karma'' excludes all kinds of mental acts, and ''prayatna'' in itself is not a ''karma'' but a quality of the self that shares a common violational trait with ''sankalpa'' ('chosen resolution').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pushpika|publisher=Oxbow Books|pages=153, 157|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OKNZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=prayatna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RG55VLigPI6QuASvx4CwBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prayatna&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Prayatna'' ('effort') is one of the five ''avasthās'' ('stages of action') viz., the second stage, the other four being ''ārambha'' ('the beginning'), ''prāptayāśā'' ('prospect of success'), ''niyatāpti'' ('certainty of success') and ''phalagāma'' or ''phalayoga'' ('attainment of result'). ''Karya'' ('action') consists of one of the three objects of human existence. ''Prayatna'' ('effort') is exertion attended with great haste, when result has not been obtained. Uneven progress indicates uneven stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Literary Criticism: Theory and Interpretation|publisher=Orient Blackswan|page=42,322|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=FMF2PL7HgeEC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=prayatna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CW95VPXONcWRuAT7x4CwCw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prayatna&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pāṇīniya-śikśā'' states that in [[Phonetics|Indian phonetics]], sounds are distinguished from each other on the basis of ''[[swara]]s'' ('accents'), ''[[Kāla (time)|kāla]]'' ('time or duration'), ''sthāna'' ('point of articulation'), ''prayatna'' ('manner') and 'anupradāna' ('type of phonation'), where ''prayatna'', here meaning 'manner', refers to how the physical organ called ''kāraṇa'' ('articulator') relates to the point of articulation, ''sparśa'' ('contact'), 'upasamhara' ('approximation'), ''vivarta'' ('open') etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Phonology: Critical Concepts in Linguistics Vol.1|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=13|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=At4fC8cAfi4C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=prayatna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_295VKuWKZKouwS18YCgBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prayatna&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sukta I.i.9 reads – 
:तुल्यास्यप्रयत्नं सवर्णम् | 
meaning – "those whose place of utterance and effort are equal are called ''savarṇa'' or homogenous letters" i.e. when the ''sthāna'' ('place of utterance') and ''prayatna'' ('effort') are the same; the inner effort is called ''abhyantara'' (which are of four kinds), and external called ''bhaya''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Siddhanta Kaumadi of Bhattoji Dikshita|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|page=|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=M5uGY0BguY4C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=prayatna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KWl5VLvqHIOruQT_1oGgBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prayatna&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Nyaya|Nyaya School]] there are three groups of ''prayatna'' – ''pravrtti'', ''nivrtti'' and ''jivanaprayatna'', the former two are ''citta vrttis'', the third being efforts made by individuals to maintain life; in [[Yoga]] philosophy, ''prayatna'' means - the effort of breathing which in the practice of ''āsanas'' must be smooth and regular,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga for the Three Stages of Life|author=Srivatsa Ramaswami|publisher=Inner Traditions|page=96|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nZRzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=prayatna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KWl5VLvqHIOruQT_1oGgBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prayatna&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''prayatna śaithilya'' means the exact and even weighing of effort and effortlessness; ''śaithilya'' means laxity, and this state is experienced when the pinnacle of intelligence holds the body on its own, unaided and effortlessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Astadala Yogamala Vol.2|author=B.K.S.Iyengar|publisher=Allied Publishing|page=79|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EqQx07nsORIC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;dq=prayatna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KWl5VLvqHIOruQT_1oGgBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prayatna&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

''Kriya'' ('action') is the nature of ''prayatna'' or personal effort, and there can be no effort without a body; ''prayatna'' is a quality which emerges in the embodied self and is associated with ''[[Manas (early Buddhism)|manas]]'' ('mind').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of Sankar’s Advaita Vedanta|author=Shyama Kumar Chattopadhyaya|publisher=Sarup &amp; Sons|page=245|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IPasbJW-1PwC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=prayatna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x2t5VIbjLoTiuQT6zYGoDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prayatna&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Caraka Sutras list the ''[[guṇa]]s'' beginning with ''para'' ('universality') and ending with ''prayatna'' ('effort') together with ''sartha'' ('sense-qualities') in which list ''[[buddhi]]'' does not figure but is separately enumerated. ''Prayatna'' is conscious activity, which in-coordination with desire, antipathy, pleasure, pain and knowledge indicates the existence of the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Philosophy, Vol.1|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|publisher=Library of Alexandria|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=F2IgY5FTrgoC&amp;pg=PT485&amp;dq=prayatna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x2t5VIbjLoTiuQT6zYGoDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=prayatna&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
'''Purposive behaviorism''' is a branch of psychology that was introduced by [[Edward Tolman]]. It combines the objective study of behavior while also considering the purpose or goal of behavior.&lt;ref name="schultz"&gt;Schultz, D.P. &amp; Schultz, S.E. (2012). ''A history of modern psychology.'' (10). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Tolman thought that learning developed from knowledge about the environment and how the organism relates to its environment.&lt;ref name="muskingum.edu"&gt;http://www.muskingum.edu/~psych/psycweb/history/tolman.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Tolman’s goal was to identify the complex cognitive mechanisms and purposes that guided behavior.&lt;ref name="Eichenenbaum, H. 2001"&gt;Eichenenbaum, H. (2001). The hippocampus and declarative memory: Cognitive mechanisms and neural codes. ''Behavioural Brain Research 127(1)'', 199-207.&lt;/ref&gt; His theories on learning went against the traditionally accepted stimulus-response connections (see [[classical conditioning]]) at this time that were proposed by other psychologists such as [[Edward Thorndike]]. Tolman disagreed with Watson’s behaviorism, so he initiated his own behaviorism, which became known as purposive behaviorism.

Tolman's purposive behaviorism focused on meaningful behavior, or [[Behaviourism#Molecular versus molar behaviourism|molar behavior]], such as kicking a ball. This focus was in contrast to simple muscle movements aka molecular behavior such as flexing of the leg muscle. Tolman regarded the molecular behavior as fairly removed from human perceptual capacities for a meaningful analysis of behavior. This approach of Tolman’s was first introduced in his book, ''Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men'', published in 1932.&lt;ref name="schultz"/&gt; To Tolman, it was obvious that all actions of behavior are goal-oriented, including those for animals.&lt;ref name="schultz"/&gt; The main difference between behaviorism and Tolman's purposive behaviorism is that behavior is goal oriented.

== Tolman's cognitive maps, 1948 ==

=== Tolman's experiment ===
Tolman’s investigation used rats to represent clinical behaviors of men. He had the rats go through mazes. A hungry rat was put at the entrance of a maze, wandering through it until he gets to the food. In the maze, there are true segment paths and blind alleys. Trials for every rat reoccurred every 24 hours. The more trials the rats completed, the fewer errors, which he characterized by the rat avoiding the blind alleys. They made as well as taking less time to complete the maze and get to their goal which was their food.&lt;ref&gt;Tolman, E. (1948). Cognitive maps in rats and men. Psychological Review 55, 189-208.&lt;/ref&gt;

A maze was used by Tolman in the following experiment: at point A, a hungry rat was placed as the starting point; point B was where the food for the rat was placed. The rat learned to get to B for food throughout the trials.

In these experiments, Tolman was looking at how the reinforcement in the trials contributed to the rat learning their way through the maze and to the food with fewer errors.&lt;ref name="muskingum.edu"/&gt; Tolman’s evaluation of these experiments led to his theory of [[latent learning]].

=== Tolman's interpretation of the experiment ===
Tolman wondered what the rat had learned when he quickly discovered how to go through the maze to get to the food. Tolman believed that the rat had developed a cognitive map of his maze, with knowledge of where the food was located. With this research, he believed this experiment supported his notion that this learning was not rooted in stimulus-response connections but in the nervous system of sets which are to function like [[cognitive maps]]. Also, Tolman assumed that these cognitive maps vary from a narrow strip of variety to a broader, comprehensive variety. Tolman showed in his study that the rats exhibited a capability of latent learning. The results showed that the rats used [[Problem solving#Psychology)|problem solving]] because of the absence of reinforcement, which could not have been resolved by S-R representations.&lt;ref name="Eichenenbaum, H. 2001"/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Tolman’s followers, also referred to as Tolmaniacs, developed a test to further support Tolman’s findings and again refute the stimulus-response explanation of the experiment. Once a rat had learned to run from A to B, the starting point was changed from point A to point C. According to the stimulus-response theory, the rat has learned to simply move to the right in the A to B trials, so it the new starting point was C, the rat would go to D. In contrast, Tolman’s cognitive map explanation predicted the rat would return to point B even if starting at the new point, C. The new tests supported Tolman’s findings of a cognitive map, for the rat continued to reach point B.&lt;ref name="muskingum.edu"/&gt;

== Tolman's published works on purposive behaviorism ==
From 1920 to 1928, Tolman published numerous articles in the Psychological Review that attempted to objectively define such concepts as instinct, consciousness, emotions, purpose, and cognition. Tolman coined the term "purposive behaviorism" when he published "Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men" (1932), which summarized these theoretical concepts and supported them with data he obtained from numerous studies. In this publication, Tolman demonstrated that insight, or our cognitive control of learning, was not restricted by evolutionary capabilities.&lt;ref name="muskingum.edu"/&gt;

Like many other behaviorists in his time, he carried out these studies with rats, believing that "everything important in psychology can be investigated in essence through the continued experimental and theoretical analysis of the determiners of rat behavior at a choice point in a maze." In this book, he described purposive behavior as behavior directed toward some ultimate goal. Examples he gave of this kind of behavior were "a rat running a maze, a man driving home to dinner, a child hiding from a stranger, a woman gossiping over the telephone, etc." Tolman's purposive behaviorism was not as widely received in its day as other psychological theories. This was largely due to the fact that many did not consider its foundation to being in line with behaviorism at all, which was the dominating force in psychology at the time. However, the insistence on studying implicit mental concepts as opposed to looking solely at explicit behavior was an idea that opened the door to the school of cognitive psychology. While much work in purposive behaviorism was dismissed by the mainstream of psychologists in its time, many of Tolman's publications, most notably "Purposive Behavior in Animals and Men" and "Cognitive Maps in Rats and Men", continue to be cited in today's research.

==Life and civic activism==

In the 1980s Salecl became associated with the intellectual circle known as the [[Ljubljana school of psychoanalysis]], which combined the study of [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]ian [[psychoanalysis]] with the philosophic legacy of [[German idealism]] and [[critical theory]]. In the late 1980s she became active in the [[left liberal]] opposition to the ruling Slovenian [[Communist regime]].&lt;ref name="www.slovenskapomlad.si"&gt;[http://www.slovenskapomlad.si/1?id=118 About the Debate Club 89 (''Debatni klub 89'')], quoting from [[Museum of Slovenian History]] ("Muzej novejše zgodovine Slovenije"), 2008, Ljubljana.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first democratic elections in Slovenia in April 1990 she unsuccessfully ran for the Slovenian Parliament on the list of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Slovenia)|Alliance of Socialist Youth of Slovenia - Liberal Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:vB2tISbJNqUJ:www.dlib.si/v2/StreamFile.aspx%3FURN%3DURN:NBN:SI:doc-02OMEYEO%26id%3D061a72af-644e-4f05-ad89-6097b52e072a%26type%3DPDF+renata+salecl+rojena&amp;hl=sl&amp;gl=si&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiVvbLyUQJQkGFyzZVzcGtKfWgvZ3T70j5sA9mCAb9RenQi9IcZlWyLSS5QTzrAgFD-7o_Qs5bdmE5SzLxPkBCitqgfRlgSN8NzxkbZQQU7_dxkildW-nF2sKE7WkjJp48HIXih&amp;sig=AHIEtbSe0b-oYc6EjuXM7hnOAH5Aoyu-Ig Announcing candidacy before 1990 elections]&lt;/ref&gt; After 1990 she left party politics but remained active in public life, especially as a commentator.

She was married to the Slovenian [[Marxist]]–[[Lacanian]] philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Work==
She studied philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, graduating with a thesis on [[Michel Foucault]]'s theory of power under the supervision of the Marxist philosopher [[Božidar Debenjak]]. From 1986, she started working as a researcher at the Institute of Criminology at the Faculty of Law in Ljubljana, In 1991, she obtained a PhD at the Department of Sociology at the University of Ljubljana under the supervision of [[Drago Braco Rotar]]. Her work focuses on bringing together law, criminology and psychoanalysis. She has worked on the theories of punishment, and on the analysis of the relation between [[Late capitalism|late capitalist]] insistence on choice and the increased feelings of anxiety and guilt in post-modern subjects. The book also analyses how matters of choice apply to law and criminology.

Salecl is associated with the [[critical legal studies]] movement. She was Centennial Professor at the department of law at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE) and is now visiting professor at the LSE's [[BIOS Centre for the Study of Bioscience, Biomedicine, Biotechnology and Society]], and holds a full professorship at the School of Law at [[Birkbeck College]], [[University of London]].&lt;ref name="Salecl_at_Birkbeck"/&gt; She often teaches as Visiting Professor at [[Cardozo School of Law]] in [[New York City|New York]].

The '''Royal Society of New South Wales''' is a learned society based in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].  It is the oldest such society in Australia and in the Southern Hemisphere. The [[Governor of New South Wales]] is the vice-regal patron of the Society.

The Society was established as the '''Philosophical Society of Australasia''' on 27 June 1821. In 1850, after a period of informal activity, the Society was revived and its name became the '''Australian Philosophical Society''' and, in 1856, the '''Philosophical Society of New South Wales'''. The Society was granted Royal Assent on 12 December 1866 and at that time was renamed the '''Royal Society of New South Wales'''.

Membership is open to any person interested in the promotion of studies in Science, Art, Literature and Philosophy. The Society is based in Sydney and has an active branches in Mittagong in the Southern Highlands of NSW. Regular monthly meetings and public lectures are well attended by both members and visitors.

The Society publishes a peer-reviewed journal, the ''[[Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales]]'', the second-oldest peer-reviewed publication in the Southern Hemisphere.

== History ==
The Royal Society of New South Wales, Australia traces its origins to the Philosophical Society of Australasia, established on 27 June 1821 and was the first scientific society in the then British Colony of New South Wales.

The Society was formed "with a view to enquiring into the various branches of physical science of this vast continent and its adjacent regions".  On his arrival in Sydney late in 1821, the newly appointed Governor, [[Sir Thomas Brisbane]], was offered and accepted the position of President.

Following a period of informal activity, the Society was revitalised (led by Dr Henry Douglass, one of the original founders) and renamed the [[Australian Philosophical Society]] on 19 January 1850. The society was renamed the ''Philosophical Society of New South Wales'' in 1856. On 12 December 1866, Queen Victoria granted Royal Assent to change its name to ''The Royal Society of New South Wales''. The Society was incorporated by Act of the New South Wales Parliament in 1881.

The rules of the Society provided that the Governor of New South Wales should be President ''ex officio''. After the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901, the Governor-General became Patron of the Society, and the Governor New South Wales the Vice-Patron.  From 1938 to 2014, the Society was under the joint patronage of the Governor-General of Australia and the Governor of NSW.  The Society now has a single Vice-Regal Patron, the Governor of NSW.

Throughout its history, the Society has done much to foster local research particularly in science, through meetings, symposia, publications and international scientific exchange, and has supported and fostered the endeavours of other organisations dedicated to the furtherance of knowledge.

The Society encourages "... ''studies and investigations in Science, Art, Literature and Philosophy, to promote and further the development of Science and its relationship with Art, Literature and Philosophy and their allied disciplines and applications, to facilitate the exchange of information and ideas amongst the Members and Fellows of the Society and others on these and kindred topics and to disseminate knowledge to the people of New South Wales and beyond ''..." through the following activities:
* Publications of results of scientific investigations through its Journal and Proceedings;
* Awarding prizes and medals for outstanding achievements in research;
* Liaison with other similar bodies;
* Holding meetings for the benefit of members and the general public (special meetings are held for the Pollock Memorial Lecture in Physics and Mathematics, the Liversidge Research Lecture in Chemistry, the Poggendorf Memorial Lecture in Agriculture, the Clarke Memorial Lecture in Geology and the Warren Lecture and Prize in engineering, applied science and technology, and the Royal Society of NSW History and Philosophy of Science Medal); and
* Maintaining a library.

== Journal ==
The Society's journal, the ''Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales'' is one of the oldest peer-reviewed publications in the Southern Hemisphere. Much innovative research of the 19th and early 20th centuries (e.g. Lawrence Hargrave's work on flight) was first brought to the attention of the scientific world through the ''Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales''. In the last few decades specialist journals have become preferred for highly technical work but the Journal and Proceedings remains an important publication for multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary work.

The Journal and Proceedings are exchanged with hundreds of institutions worldwide. Issues are published June and December each year.

The Society welcomes scholarly work to be considered for publication in the Journal. Preference is given to work done in Australia which has relevance to New South Wales.

The mission of the magazine was to encourage and support the practice of shamanism from an experiential perspective of [[shamans]] and other practitioners. In order to consolidate contemporary and ancient shamanic methodologies, ''Shaman's Drum'' regularly examined traditional, non-traditional and contemporary forms of shamanism and [[methodology]]:  ranging from [[Siberian]] [[ecstatic]] [[seance]]s and [[Tibet]]an [[trance]] [[oracle]]s to [[Amazon Basin|Amazonian]] [[ayahuasca]] [[ritual]]s and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] healing ceremonies. The journal took the view that shamanism is a universal [[human]] [[phenomenon]], or complex of [[phenomena]], that ultimately [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcend]]s [[culture]] or [[tradition]].

In 2011 its website announced that there were plans to continue via the Shaman's Drum Foundation, an on-line publication with associated electronic archives, but as of June 2012 there have been no public developments regarding this.

'''''Shibui''''' (渋い) (adjective), '''''shibumi''''' (渋み) (noun), or '''''shibusa''''' (渋さ) (noun) are [[Japanese language|Japanese]] words which refer to a particular aesthetic of simple, subtle, and unobtrusive [[beauty]].&lt;ref name="HussainWilkinson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr. Mazhar Hussain|author2=Robert Wilkinson|title=The Pursuit of Comparative Aesthetics: An Interface Between East and West|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Wez4pgWp3AC&amp;pg=PA227|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5345-5|pages=227–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other [[Japanese aesthetics]] terms, such as ''[[Iki (aesthetic ideal)|iki]]'' and ''[[wabi-sabi]]'', ''shibui'' can apply to a wide variety of subjects, not just art or fashion.&lt;ref name="De_Garis2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=De Garis|title=We Japanese|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUm0AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15|date=5 September 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-18367-6|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shibusa is an enriched, subdued appearance or experience of intrinsically fine quality with economy of form, line, and effort, producing a timeless tranquility.  Shibusa includes the following essential qualities: 
* Shibui objects appear to be simple overall but they include subtle details, such as textures, that balance simplicity with complexity.  
* This balance of simplicity and complexity ensures that one does not tire of a shibui object but constantly finds new meanings and enriched beauty that cause its aesthetic value to grow over the years.&lt;ref name="Lim2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sunamita Lim|title=Japanese Style: Designing with Nature's Beauty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NsWemDyPlE4C&amp;pg=PA41|year=2007|publisher=Gibbs Smith|isbn=978-1-4236-0092-3|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shibusa walks a fine line between contrasting aesthetic concepts such as elegant and rough or spontaneous and restrained.&lt;ref name="Lebra1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Takie Sugiyama Lebra|title=Japanese Patterns of Behaviour|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWG07rhiyUMC&amp;pg=PA20|year=1976|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-0460-2|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colors of shibusa are "muddy" colors.&lt;ref name="De_Garis2013"/&gt; For example, in interior decorating and painting, gray is added to primary colors to create a silvery effect that ties the different colors together into a coordinated scheme.  Depending upon how much gray is added, shibui colors range from pastels to dark. Occasionally, a patch of brighter color is added as a highlight.

[[File:Shibusa modesty wiki.jpg|thumb|right|"Shibusa Modesty" iron glaze vase, Dorothy Bearnson, 1988.]]
Shibusa is not to be confused with wabi or sabi.  Though many wabi or sabi objects are shibui, not all shibui objects are wabi or sabi. Wabi or sabi objects can be more severe and sometimes exaggerate intentional imperfections to such an extent that they can appear to be artificial. Shibui objects are not necessarily imperfect or asymmetrical, though they can include these qualities. 

The seven elements of shibusa are simplicity, implicity, modesty, naturalness, everydayness, imperfection, and silence.  They are adapted from the concepts authored by Dr. Soetsu Yanagi (1898–1961), aesthetician and museum curator, published in the Japanese magazine ''Kogei'' between 1930–1940. The aristocratic simplicity of shibusa is the refined expression of the essence of elements in an aesthetic experience producing quietude. Spare elegance is evident in darkling serenity with a hint of sparkle.  Implicity allows depth of feeling to be visible through spare surface design thereby manifesting the invisible core that offers new meanings with each encounter.  The person of shibui modesty exalts excellence via taking time to learn, watch, read, understand, develop, think, and merges into understatement and silence concerning oneself.  Naturalness conveys spontaneity in unforced growth.  Shibusa freedom is maintained in healthy roughness of texture and irregular asymmetrical form wherein the center lies beyond all particular things, in infinity. Everydayness raises ordinary things to a place of honor, void of all artificial and unnecessary properties, thus imparting spiritual joy—for today is more auspicious than tomorrow.  Everydayness provides a framework, a tradition for an artist's oeuvre to be a unit not a process.  Hiroshi Mizuo argues that the best examples of shibusa are found in the crafts, ordinary objects made for everyday use. They tend to be more spontaneous and healthy than many of the fine arts.  Imperfection is illustrated in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s gothic novel, ''The Marble Faun''.  The chapter "An Aesthetic Company" mentions some ragged and ill-conditioned antique drawings and their attributions and virtues.
{{Quote

}}
            
Imperfection in shibusa Sōetsu Yanagi in ''[[The Unknown Craftsman]]'' refers to as "beauty with inner implications".  Creation here means making a piece that will lead the viewer to draw beauty from it for oneself.  Shibui beauty in Tea Ceremony is in the artistry of the viewer.

Shibusa's sanctuary of silence is non-dualism—the resolution of opposites. Its foundation is intuition coupled with faith and beauty revealing phases of truth and the worship and reverence for life.

In [[James A. Michener]]'s book ''[[Iberia (book)|Iberia]]'' the adjective 'shibui' is referenced as follows: "The Japanese have a word which summarizes all the best in Japanese life, yet it has no explanation and cannot be translated. It is the word ''shibui'', and the best approximation to its meaning is 'acerbic good taste.'" The author Trevanian (the nom de plume of Dr. Rodney William Whitaker) wrote in his 1979 best-selling
novel ''[[Shibumi (novel)|Shibumi]]'', "Shibumi has to do with great refinement underlying commonplace appearances." In the [[business fable]] ''[[The Shibumi Strategy]]'', the author, [[Matthew E. May]], wrote that shibumi "has come to denote those things that exhibit in paradox and all at once the very best of everything and nothing: Elegant simplicity. Effortless effectiveness. Understated excellence. Beautiful imperfection."
  
Shibui, a registration or 'felt sense' of evolving perfection.  What is being registered is the 'Life' behind the qualities of any experience.  A 'felt sense' of qualities, such as, quiet beauty with intelligence, love, light, and joy.  These qualities can be more easily registered when quietly viewing simple, natural everyday phenomenon or objects, such as a sunrise or a simple piece of pottery.  Shibui can sometimes be more easily registered by two people in a meditative state (quiet in their emotions and their minds) while viewing the same phenomenon or object. For example, when viewing the same sunset or piece of art, subconsciously, both people register the qualities of the 'Life' or implicity underlying the experience or object; this registration of the underlying 'Life' precipitates into the conscious as registering something 'extraordinary' in the everyday 'ordinary'.  If you both register, then looking into the other person's eyes, you understand that you both shared the same phenomenon, a 'knowing' of the underlying 'Life', or at least the qualities of that underlying 'Life'.  The qualities registered can seem paradoxical. Complex experiences or objects seem simple; perfection is found in imperfection.  All objects and experiences, both everyday and extraordinary, can have a beauty, a quiet purposeful intent, a cool 'matter of fact' underlying joy.

Potters, musicians, painters, bonsai and other artists often work to bring in 'Shibui-like' qualities into their art.  A few go behind these qualities to bring the underlying 'Life' into their art.  Expert singers, actors, potters, and artists of all other sorts were often said to be ''shibui''; their expertise caused them to do things beautifully without making them excessive or gaudy. Today, sometimes baseball players are even said to be ''shibui'' when they contribute to the overall success of the team without doing anything to make themselves stand out individually. The apparent effortlessness displayed by athletes such as tennis player Roger Federer and hockey great Wayne Gretzky are examples of shibumi in personal performance. Shibui, and its underlying 'Life', is found in all art and in everything around us—including ourselves.  Taking the path to understand and experience Shibui, is a step towards understanding and consciously registering the 'Life' underlying all.

==History of the term==
[[File:Diospyros kaki Frucht.jpg|thumb|right|An almost ripe ''Shibui'', the fruit of ''[[Diospyros kaki]]'']]
Originating in the [[Muromachi period]] (1336–1573) as ''shibushi'', the term originally referred to a sour or astringent taste, such as that of an unripe [[persimmon]].&lt;ref name="HussainWilkinson2006"/&gt; ''Shibui'' maintains that literal meaning still, and remains the antonym of amai (甘い), meaning 'sweet'.

However, by the beginnings of the [[Edo period]] (1615–1868), the term had gradually begun to refer to a pleasing aesthetic. The people of Edo expressed their tastes in using this term to refer to anything from song to fashion to craftsmanship that was beautiful by being understated, or by being precisely what it was meant to be and not elaborated upon. Essentially, the aesthetic ideal of ''shibumi'' seeks out events, performances, people or objects that are beautiful in a direct and simple way, without being flashy.

Soetsu Yanagi work as translated by Bernard Leach in ''[[The Unknown Craftsman]]'' discusses shibumi.

The concept of ''shibusa'' was introduced to the West in August and September, 1960, in publications of the American magazine ''[[House Beautiful]]''.

The '''Singapore Kindness Movement''' is a non-profit organization that executes public education programs aimed at cultivating kindness and graciousness in [[Singapore]]an society. It was officially launched in 1997. The movement serves as the successor to the Singapore Courtesy Council that oversaw the [[National Courtesy Campaign (Singapore)]] from the 1980s through the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_162_2004-12-30.html | title=Courtesy Campaign | accessdate=2011-01-11 | author=Lim, Siew Yeen | publisher=National Library Board Singapore | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820041841/http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_162_2004-12-30.html | archivedate=2011-08-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Singapore Kindness Movement (SKM) was initiated in response to Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]]’s call to Singaporeans to develop into a more caring and gracious society in the new century.

In his 1996 New Year’s address, stated "We have become a [[Developed country|developed economy]] because we put our minds to it and strive hard to reach our goals. Let us now complement our economic achievements with social, cultural, and spiritual development. Then by the 21st century, Singapore will be a truly successful, mature country, with a developed economy and a gracious society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Social behaviour must match prosperity, says PM | date=1 January 1996 | publisher=The Straits Times | pages=Page 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PM Goh announced the SKM pilot project in July 1996, when he launched the Singapore Courtesy Campaign.Some 2,000 students from the uniformed groups in 20 secondary schools participated in the pilot project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Always In Season, A Harvest of Kindness Stories | author=Dr Lee Tzu Pheng | year=2000 | publisher=MITA:Singapore Kindness Movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Movement was launched in January 1997, to over 80,000 secondary school students. SKM officially registered as a non-profit society on 31 January 1997. In March 2001, the National Courtesy Campaign was subsumed by the Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Soon, courtesy will be part of kindness. | date=January 13, 2001 | publisher=The Straits Times | pages=Home, p. 2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singapore Kindness Movement held the secretariat of the [[World Kindness Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldkindness.org.sg/about.html | title=World Kindness Movement- About Us | accessdate=2011-01-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117105010/http://www.worldkindness.org.sg/about.html | archivedate=2009-11-17 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2003-2012.

== Organizational goals ==
The mission statement of the SKM is to inspire graciousness through spontaneous acts of kindness, making life more pleasant for everyone.&lt;ref name="SKMAbout"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.kindness.sg/about/about-skm |title=Singapore Kindness Movement |accessdate=2010-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505210220/http://kindness.sg/about/about-skm |archivedate=2010-05-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its main objectives are:
To encourage all Singaporeans to be more kind and considerate.
To enhance public awareness of acts of kindness.
To influence and raise the standards of social behaviour in our society.&lt;ref name="SKMAbout" /&gt;

== Structure ==
The SKM organisational structure consists of two main parts: The SKM Council (SKMC) and the SKM Secretariat. The SKM Council comprises members from the private and 19 public sectors.&lt;ref name="SKMAbout" /&gt; In March 2001, the Singapore Courtesy Council integrated with the SKMC.

The Movement is supported by the [[Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth]] and funded by a government grant. SKM also secures funds through its membership subscriptions and sponsorships.

The patron of the Movement is Prime Minister [[Lee Hsien Loong]] and the current Chairman is Koh Poh Tiong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news.gov.sg/public/sgpc/en/media_releases/agencies/mica-nrd/press_release/P-20080626-1.print.html?AuthKey= | title=Changing of guard at SKM | accessdate=2011-01-11 | author=Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718072207/http://www.news.gov.sg/public/sgpc/en/media_releases/agencies/mica-nrd/press_release/P-20080626-1.print.html?AuthKey= | archivedate=2011-07-18 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logo and mascot ==

The two strokes and ovals of the Singapore Kindness Movement logo depicts two people—one who does an act of kindness and the other who receives it. The freehand strokes combine to form a heart. Red symbolises love for your fellow man and green represents caring for the environment, tolerance, creativity, and consideration.

Singa the Lion had been the official mascot of the Singapore Kindness Movement until May, 2013. On 15 May 2013, Singa the Lion was retired from the campaign through an open "resignation letter" posted on the movement's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kindness.sg/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/singaletter2.jpg | title=Subject : Open Letter to Singapore - I Quit | publisher=Singapore Kindness Movement. | work=Singa resigns | accessdate=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Singa the Courtesy Lion: I quit|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Singapore/Story/A1Story20130515-422664.html|accessdate=15 May 2013|newspaper=Asiaone|date=15 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 he demonstrated the first engine-powered and [[Controllable pitch propeller|controlled, variable and reversible pitch propeller]].&lt;ref name=SHM-looking/&gt;

In 1929 he sold his patents and facilities to [[Bendix Aviation Corporation]]&lt;ref name=Lowi/&gt; and retired to work on projects in horticulture and the natural and social sciences,&lt;ref name=Foldvary/&gt;&lt;ref name=SHM-liberty&gt;Spencer MacCallum, [http://libertyunbound.com/sites/files/printarchive/Liberty_Magazine_May_2005.pdf From Upstate New York to the Horn of Africa]", [[Liberty (1987)|Liberty Magazine]], May 2005, Volume 19, Number 5.&lt;/ref&gt; including research with the aim of establishing the basis for an authentic natural science of society.&lt;ref name=Lowi/&gt;

His articles on aeronautical engineering were published by the Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers, the Journal of the [[Franklin Institute]] and other technical journals. [[International Who's Who]] listed him in 1947-1949 and Who's Who in the East in 1948-1951.&lt;ref name=Lowi/&gt;

==Economic and political views==
Around 1898, attracted by the [[Georgism|Georgists']] free-trade stance, Spencer Heath became recording secretary for the Chicago Single Tax Club and participated in the movement for 40 years. He assisted in the formation of the Henry George School in New York City and conducted public seminars there on community organization in the early 1930s.&lt;ref name=Lowi/&gt; School Director [[Frank Chodorov]] later fired him for straying from the Georgist line.&lt;ref name=SHM-looking/&gt;  Heath had rejected the Georgist antipathy toward landlords and had come to believe that society only could outgrow its subservience to the state through a particular use of land. In 1936, he self-published his views in a monograph entitled "Politics versus Proprietorship." It was the first statement of the proprietary community principle.&lt;ref name=SHM-liberty/&gt; In 1952, ''[[The Freeman]]'' published Heath’s polemic “Progress and Poverty Reviewed”, a critique of Henry George's tax argument.&lt;ref name=Lowi/&gt;

Heath completed his major work, ''Citadel, Market and Altar'', in 1946, publishing it through his Science of Society Foundation, Inc. in 1957.  In a review of the book [[Manas journal]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt; Mr. Heath returns to the socio-economic relationships of pre-Norman England for the foundation of an ideal society which will combine freedom and justice. This is a serious book with carefully worked-out plans and precise definitions. Mr. Heath's notion of ownership is very like Gandhi's conception of the stewardship of wealth: “In its Anglo-Saxon meaning, now only dimly realized, to own was to owe. Ownership was inclusive of others, not exclusive. What was owned, chiefly land, was held in trust, as it were.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manasjournal.org/pdf_library/VolumeX_1957/X-40.pdf Changing Allegiances], Manas Journal, Vol. X, No. 43, October 23, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Heath wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt; To obviate the essential tyranny (coercion) of political administration the proprietary authority, suitably organized, must extend its jurisdiction, and thus its revenues, by itself supplying police and other community services without coercion, out of its own revenues and properties, and thus raise its own values and voluntary incomes.&lt;ref name=Foldvary/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The model for Heathian [[anarchism]] is proprietary communities, multi-tenant properties such as hotels, shopping centers, industrial parks, and apartment buildings. Multi-tenant properties are the opposite of traditional real-estate developments; the developers would lease the homes rather than sell them, and thus be responsible for providing community services to maintain rental income and land value.&lt;ref name=Foldvary/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowi/&gt;

==Influence==
Murray Rothbard based much of his criticism of Henry George on Spencer Heath’s writings. These in turn have influenced many libertarians.&lt;ref name=Foldvary/&gt; He also mentioned Heath’s views on community a number of times in his book ''[[Man, Economy and State]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Rothbard, ''Man, Economy, and State'' Scholars Edition, Mises Institute, Auburn, AL, 2004, pp. 565, 660, 670, 891, 936, 1131, 1203, 1204, 1207-08, 1281.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heath's system has been the model for [[intentional community]] and "new country" projects such as Werner K. Stiefel’s 1970s motel community and “Atlantis” projects.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer H. MacCallum, [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig4/maccallum2.html Werner K. Stiefel ’s Pursuit of a Practicum of Freedom], [[LewRockwell.com]], June 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heath's grandson [[Spencer MacCallum|Spencer Heath MacCallum]] holds Heath’s papers in the Heather Foundation, of which MacCullum is director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logan.com/afi/lowi.html The Phoenix Forum sponsors list]&lt;/ref&gt; Heath was good friends with, and exchanged [[free market]] insights with, [[alternative currency|alternative monetary theorist]] [[E.C. Riegel]] whose papers also are held by the  Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;E.C. Riegel, [http://www.newapproachtofreedom.info/ffi/editorial.html ''The New Approach to Freedom''], Editorial preface by Spencer MacCallum, San Pedro, CA, The Heather Foundation, 1979 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spencer MacCallum built upon and promoted his grandfather's ideas of proprietary community in his 1970 booklet ''The Art of Community'' and many articles, including "The Enterprise of Community: Market Competition, Land, and Environment" (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Spencer H. MacCallum,  [https://mises.org/journals/jls/17_4/17_4_1.pdf "The Enterprise of Community: Market Competition, Land, and Environment"], ''Journal of Libertarian Studies'', Volume 17, no. 4, Fall 2003, 1-15, published by [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Looking Back and Forward" (which describes the influence of his grandfather)&lt;ref name=SHM-looking/&gt; and "From Upstate New York to the Horn of Africa" (2005).&lt;ref name=SHM-liberty/&gt;

Heath's views on rent were discussed in [[John Chamberlain (journalist)|John Chamberlain]]'s  1959 book, ''The Roots of Capitalism''&lt;ref&gt;John Chamberlain, ''The Roots of Capitalism,'' D. Van Nostrand, Princeton, 1959, 92-3, 214-5.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gus Dizerega’s year 2000 book ''Persuasion, Power, and Polity: A Theory of Democratic Self-Organization.''&lt;ref&gt;Gus Dizerega, ''Persuasion, Power, and Polity: A Theory of Democratic Self-Organization,'' ICS Press, Cresskill, NJ, 2000, pp. 319, 326.&lt;/ref&gt; His views on community were discussed in [[John McClaughrey]]'s 1995 article “Private Idahoes” in [[Reason Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;John McClaughry, [http://www.reason.com/news/show/29734.html "Private Idahoes"], ''Reason Magazine'', August/September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; a chapter of the 2001 book ''City and Country'', called "The Completely Decentralized City: The Case for Benefits Based Public Finance"&lt;ref&gt;''City and Country'', edited by Lawrence S. Moss, Blackwell Publishers, Malden, MA, 2001, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gabriel Joseph Roth's 2006 book, ''Street Smart: Competition, Entrepreneurship, and the Future of Roads.''&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Joseph Roth, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sYAxKrpSjOsC Street Smart: Competition, Entrepreneurship, and the Future of Roads''], [[Independent Institute]], 2006pp. 319-326.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heath's system differs from the standard anarcho-capitalist [[private defense agency]] (PDA) model. Heath himself eschewed the term, and did not refer to himself as an anarchist. The PDA model envisions competing security agencies in the same geographical area rather than a proprietary zone. 

Citing Spencer MacCallum, economist Edward Stringham discusses how a system composed of many proprietary communities would encourage landlords to provide police in a way that their tenants value most, even if there were one provider of law in a given area. Stringham contrasts that vision with one that focuses on having multiple law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Stringham, E.P.

{{About|tautology in formal logic||Tautology (disambiguation)}}
In [[logic]], a '''tautology''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ταυτολογία) is a [[well-formed formula|formula]] or assertion that is true in every possible [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]. A simple example is "(x equals y) or (x does not equal y)" (or as a less abstract example, "The ball is green or the ball is not green").

[[Philosopher]] [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] first applied the term to redundancies of [[propositional logic]] in 1921. (It had been used earlier to refer to [[tautology (rhetoric)|rhetorical tautologies]], and continues to be used in that alternative sense.) A formula is [[Satisfiability and validity|satisfiable]] if it is true under at least one interpretation, and thus a tautology is a formula whose negation is unsatisfiable. Unsatisfiable statements, both through negation and affirmation, are known formally as [[contradiction]]s. A formula that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is said to be [[Contingency (philosophy)|logically contingent]]. Such a formula can be made either true or false based on the values assigned to its propositional variables.  The [[double turnstile]] notation &lt;math&gt;\vDash S&lt;/math&gt; is used to indicate that ''S'' is a tautology.  Tautology is sometimes symbolized by "V''pq''", and contradiction by "O''pq''".  The [[tee (symbol)|tee]] symbol &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes used to denote an arbitrary tautology, with the dual symbol &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; ([[falsum]]) representing an arbitrary contradiction; in any symbolism, a tautology may be substituted for the truth value "[[Logical truth|true]]," as symbolized, for instance, by "1."

Tautologies are a key concept in [[propositional logic]], where a tautology is defined as a propositional formula that is true under any possible Boolean valuation of its [[propositional variable]]s. A key property of tautologies in propositional logic is that an [[effective method]] exists for testing whether a given formula is always satisfied (or, equivalently, whether its negation is unsatisfiable).

The definition of ''tautology'' can be extended to sentences in [[predicate logic]], which may contain [[Quantification (logic)|quantifiers]], unlike sentences of propositional logic. In propositional logic, there is no distinction between a tautology and a [[Validity (logic)|logically valid]] formula. In the context of [[predicate logic]], many authors define a tautology to be a sentence that can be obtained by taking a tautology of propositional logic and uniformly replacing each propositional variable by a first-order formula (one formula per propositional variable). The set of such formulas is a [[proper subset]] of the set of logically valid sentences of predicate logic (which are the sentences that are true in every [[structure (mathematical logic)|model]]).

==History==
The word ''tautology'' was used by the ancient Greeks to describe a statement that was asserted to be true merely by virtue of saying the same thing twice, a pejorative meaning that is still used for [[tautology (rhetoric)|rhetorical tautologies]]. Between 1800 and 1940, the word gained new meaning in logic, and is currently used in [[mathematical logic]] to denote a certain type of propositional formula, without the pejorative connotations it originally possessed.&lt;!-- remainder of this section sourced to Dreben and Floyd; will add more sources later.
Logical positivism became an issue according to Dr.Kowalsky and Dr.Rodgers since it held as neither a tautology nor empirically verifiable. Due to this issue it was in fact excluded from further definitions of science by those that followed in the philosophical scientific footsteps. Despite this there are still scientists today that feel that logical positivism (relying mainly on tautology) is still valid.
--&gt;

In 1800, [[Immanuel Kant]] wrote in his book ''Logic'':
:"The identity of concepts in analytical judgments can be either ''explicit'' (''explicita'') or ''non-explicit'' (''implicita''). In the former case analytic propositions are ''tautological.''"
Here ''analytic proposition'' refers to an [[analytic truth]], a statement in natural language that is true solely because of the terms involved.

In 1884, [[Gottlob Frege]] proposed in his ''Grundlagen'' that a truth is analytic exactly if it can be derived using logic. But he maintained a distinction between analytic truths (those true based only on the meanings of their terms) and tautologies (statements devoid of content).

In 1921, in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', Ludwig Wittgenstein proposed that statements that can be deduced by logical deduction are tautological (empty of meaning) as well as being analytic truths. [[Henri Poincaré]] had made similar remarks in ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' in 1905. Although [[Bertrand Russell]] at first argued against these remarks by Wittgenstein and Poincaré, claiming that mathematical truths were not only non-tautologous but were [[synthetic truth|synthetic]], he later spoke in favor of them in 1918:
:"Everything that is a proposition of logic has got to be in some sense or the other like a tautology. It has got to be something that has some peculiar quality, which I do not know how to define, that belongs to logical propositions but not to others."
Here ''logical proposition'' refers to a proposition that is provable using the laws of logic.

During the 1930s, the formalization of the semantics of propositional logic in terms of truth assignments was developed. The term ''tautology'' began to be applied to those propositional formulas that are true regardless of the truth or falsity of their propositional variables. Some early books on logic (such as ''Symbolic Logic'' by [[C. I. Lewis]] and Langford, 1932) used the term for any proposition (in any formal logic) that is universally valid. It is common in presentations after this (such as [[Stephen Kleene]] 1967 and [[Herbert Enderton]] 2002) to use ''tautology'' to refer to a logically valid propositional formula, but to maintain a distinction between ''tautology'' and ''logically valid'' in the context of first-order logic (see [[Tautology (logic)#Tautologies versus validities in first-order logic|below]]).

==Background==
{{Main|propositional logic}}

Propositional logic begins with '''propositional variables''', atomic units that represent concrete propositions. A '''formula''' consists of propositional variables connected by logical connectives, built up in such a way that the truth of the overall formula can be deduced from the truth or falsity of each variable. A '''valuation''' is a function that assigns each propositional variable either T (for truth) or F (for falsity). So, for example, using the propositional variables ''A'' and ''B'', the binary connectives &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; representing [[Logical disjunction|disjunction]] and [[Logical conjunction|conjunction]] respectively, and the unary connective &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt; representing [[negation]], the following formula can be obtained::&lt;math&gt;(A \land B) \lor (\lnot A) \lor (\lnot B)&lt;/math&gt;.
A valuation here must assign to each of ''A'' and ''B'' either T or F. But no matter how this assignment is made, the overall formula will come out true. For if the first conjunction &lt;math&gt;(A \land B)&lt;/math&gt; is not satisfied by a particular valuation, then one of ''A'' and ''B'' is assigned F, which will cause the corresponding later disjunct to be T.

==Definition and examples==
A formula of propositional logic is a '''tautology''' if the formula itself is always true regardless of which valuation is used for the propositional variables.

There are infinitely many tautologies. Examples include:
*&lt;math&gt;(A \lor \lnot A)&lt;/math&gt; ("''A'' or not ''A''"), the [[law of the excluded middle]]. This formula has only one propositional variable, ''A''. Any valuation for this formula must, by definition, assign ''A'' one of the truth values ''true'' or ''false'', and assign &lt;math&gt;\lnot&lt;/math&gt;''A'' the other truth value.
*&lt;math&gt;(A \to B) \Leftrightarrow (\lnot B \to \lnot A)&lt;/math&gt; ("if ''A'' implies ''B'', then not-''B'' implies not-''A''", and vice versa), which expresses the law of [[contraposition]].
*&lt;math&gt;((\lnot A \to B) \land (\lnot A \to \lnot B)) \to A&lt;/math&gt; ("if not-''A'' implies both ''B'' and its negation not-''B'', then not-''A'' must be false, then ''A'' must be true"), which is the principle known as ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]''.
*&lt;math&gt;\lnot(A \land B) \Leftrightarrow (\lnot A \lor \lnot B)&lt;/math&gt; ("if not both ''A'' and ''B'', then not-''A'' or not-''B''", and vice versa), which is known as [[De Morgan's law]].
*&lt;math&gt;((A \to B) \land (B \to C)) \to (A \to C)&lt;/math&gt; ("if ''A'' implies ''B'' and ''B'' implies ''C'', then ''A'' implies ''C''"), which is the principle known as [[syllogism]].
*&lt;math&gt;((A \lor B) \land (A \to C) \land (B \to C)) \to C&lt;/math&gt; ("if at least one of ''A'' or ''B'' is true, and each implies ''C'', then ''C'' must be true as well"), which is the principle known as [[proof by cases]].

A minimal tautology is a tautology that is not the instance of a shorter tautology.
*&lt;math&gt;(A \lor B) \to (A \lor B)&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology, but not a minimal one, because it is an instantiation of &lt;math&gt;C \to C&lt;/math&gt;.

==Verifying tautologies==
The problem of determining whether a formula is a tautology is fundamental in propositional logic. If there are ''n'' variables occurring in a formula then there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; distinct valuations for the formula. Therefore, the task of determining whether or not the formula is a tautology is a finite, mechanical one: one need only evaluate the [[truth value]] of the formula under each of its possible valuations. One algorithmic method for verifying that every valuation causes this sentence to be true is to make a [[truth table]] that includes every possible valuation.

For example, consider the formula
:&lt;math&gt; ((A \land B) \to C) \Leftrightarrow (A \to (B \to C)).&lt;/math&gt;
There are 8 possible valuations for the propositional variables ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', represented by the first three columns of the following table. The remaining columns show the truth of subformulas of the formula above, culminating in a column showing the truth value of the original formula under each valuation.

!&lt;math&gt;A \to (B \to C)&lt;/math&gt;

Because each row of the final column shows ''T'', the sentence in question is verified to be a tautology.

It is also possible to define a [[deductive system]] (proof system) for propositional logic, as a simpler variant of the deductive systems employed for first-order logic (see Kleene 1967, Sec 1.9 for one such system). A proof of a tautology in an appropriate deduction system may be much shorter than a complete truth table (a formula with ''n'' propositional variables requires a truth table with 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; lines, which quickly becomes infeasible as ''n'' increases). Proof systems are also required for the study of intuitionistic propositional logic, in which the method of truth tables cannot be employed because the law of the excluded middle is not assumed.

==Tautological implication==
{{Main|Tautological consequence}}

A formula ''R'' is said to '''tautologically imply''' a formula ''S'' if every  valuation that causes ''R'' to be true also causes ''S'' to be true. This situation is denoted &lt;math&gt;R \models S&lt;/math&gt;.   It is equivalent to the formula &lt;math&gt;R \to S&lt;/math&gt; being a tautology (Kleene 1967 p.&amp;nbsp;27).

For example, let ''S'' be &lt;math&gt;A \land (B \lor \lnot B)&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''S'' is not a tautology, because any valuation that makes ''A'' false will make ''S'' false.  But any valuation that makes ''A'' true will make ''S'' true, because &lt;math&gt;B \lor \lnot B&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology. Let ''R'' be the formula &lt;math&gt;A \land C&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;R \models S&lt;/math&gt;, because any valuation satisfying ''R'' makes ''A'' true and thus makes ''S'' true.

It follows from the definition that if a formula ''R'' is a contradiction then ''R'' tautologically implies every formula, because there is no truth valuation that causes ''R'' to be true and so the definition of tautological implication is trivially satisfied. Similarly, if ''S'' is a tautology then ''S'' is tautologically implied by every formula.

==Substitution==
{{Main|Substitution instance}}

There is a general procedure, the '''substitution rule''', that allows additional tautologies to be
constructed from a given tautology (Kleene 1967 sec. 3). Suppose that ''S'' is a tautology and for
each propositional variable ''A'' in ''S'' a fixed sentence ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; is chosen. Then the
sentence obtained by replacing each variable ''A'' in ''S'' with the corresponding sentence ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; is also a tautology.

For example, let ''S'' be the tautology 
:&lt;math&gt;(A \land B) \lor \lnot A \lor \lnot B&lt;/math&gt;.
Let ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''A''&lt;/sub&gt; be &lt;math&gt;C \lor D&lt;/math&gt; and let ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; be &lt;math&gt;C \to E&lt;/math&gt;.
It follows from the substitution rule that the sentence
:&lt;math&gt;((C \lor D) \land (C \to E)) \lor \lnot (C \lor D) \lor \lnot (C \to E)&lt;/math&gt;
is a tautology, too.  In turn, a tautology may be substituted for the truth value "[[Logical truth|true]]".

==Semantic completeness and soundness ==
An [[axiomatic system]] is [[Completeness (logic) | complete ]] if every tautology is a theorem (derivable from axioms). An axiomatic system is [[soundness|sound]] if every theorem is a tautology.

== Efficient verification and the Boolean satisfiability problem ==
The problem of constructing practical algorithms to determine whether sentences with large numbers of propositional variables are tautologies is an area of contemporary research in the area of [[automated theorem proving]].

The method of [[truth tables]] illustrated above is provably correct – the truth table for a tautology will end in a column with only ''T'', while the truth table for a sentence that is not a tautology will contain a row whose final column is ''F'', and the valuation corresponding to that row is a valuation that does not satisfy the sentence being tested. This method for verifying tautologies is an [[effective procedure]], which means that given unlimited computational resources it can always be used to mechanistically determine whether a sentence is a tautology. This means, in particular, the set of tautologies over a fixed finite or countable alphabet is a [[decidable set]].

As an [[efficient procedure]], however, truth tables are constrained by the fact that the number of valuations that must be checked increases as 2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''k'' is the number of variables in the formula.  This exponential growth in the computation length renders the truth table method useless for formulas with thousands of propositional variables, as contemporary computing hardware cannot execute the algorithm in a feasible time period.

The problem of determining whether there is any valuation that makes a formula true is the '''[[Boolean satisfiability problem]]'''; the problem of checking tautologies is equivalent to this problem, because verifying that a sentence ''S'' is a tautology is equivalent to verifying that there is no valuation satisfying &lt;math&gt;\lnot S&lt;/math&gt;. It is known that the Boolean satisfiability problem is [[NP complete]], and widely believed that there is no [[polynomial-time algorithm]] that can perform it. Consequently tautology is [[co-NP-complete]]. Current research focuses on finding algorithms that perform well on special classes of formulas, or terminate quickly on average even though some inputs may cause them to take much longer.

==Tautologies versus validities in first-order logic==
The fundamental definition of a tautology is in the context of propositional logic. The definition can be extended, however, to sentences in [[first-order logic]] (see Enderton (2002, p.&amp;nbsp;114) and Kleene (1967 secs. 17–18)). These sentences may contain quantifiers, unlike sentences of propositional logic.   In the context of first-order logic, a distinction is maintained between '''logical validities''', sentences that are true in every model, and '''tautologies''', which are a proper subset of the first-order logical validities. In the context of propositional logic, these two terms coincide.

A tautology in first-order logic is a sentence that can be obtained by taking a tautology of propositional logic and uniformly replacing each propositional variable by a first-order formula (one formula per propositional variable).  For example,
because &lt;math&gt;A \lor \lnot A&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology of propositional logic, &lt;math&gt; (\forall x ( x = x)) \lor (\lnot \forall x (x = x))&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology in first order logic. Similarly, in a first-order language with a unary relation symbols ''R'',''S'',''T'', the following sentence is a tautology:
:&lt;math&gt;(((\exists x Rx) \land \lnot (\exists x Sx)) \to \forall x Tx) \Leftrightarrow ((\exists x Rx) \to ((\lnot \exists x Sx) \to \forall x Tx)).&lt;/math&gt;
It is obtained by replacing &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\exists x Rx&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\lnot \exists x Sx&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\forall x Tx&lt;/math&gt; in the propositional tautology &lt;math&gt;((A \land B) \to C) \Leftrightarrow (A \to (B \to C))&lt;/math&gt;.

Not all logical validities are tautologies in first-order logic. For example, the sentence
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x Rx) \to \lnot \exists x \lnot Rx&lt;/math&gt;
is true in any first-order interpretation, but it corresponds to the propositional sentence &lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt; which is not a tautology of propositional logic.

==In natural language==

In natural languages, some apparent tautologies may have non-tautological meanings in practice. In English, "it is what it is" is used to mean 'there is no way of changing it'.&lt;ref name="robinson"&gt;Nathan J.

'''Teleological behaviorism''' is a variety of [[behaviorism]]. Like all other forms of [[Behaviorism]] it relies heavily on attention to outwardly observable human behaviors. Similarly to other branches of behaviorism, teleological behaviorism takes into account cognitive processes, like emotions and thoughts, but does not view these as empirical causes of behavior. Teleological behaviorism instead looks at these emotions and thoughts as behaviors themselves. Teleological behaviorism differs from other branches of Behaviorism through its focus on human capacity for self-control and also emphasizes the concept of free will.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Psychologistworld.com|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The founder of teleological behaviorism is [[Howard Rachlin]], an Emeritus Research Professor of Psychology at the [[State University of New York, Stony Brook]]. Originally focusing his work on operant behavior, he eventually became interested in the concepts of free-will as they applied to [[Behavioral Economics]] and turned his interest to the related field of teleological behaviorism from there. A large influence for Rachlin’s work was Aristotle’s early philosophies on the mind, specifically how “Artistotle’s classification of movements in terms of final rather than efficient causes corresponds to [[B.F. Skinner]]’s conception of an operant as a class of movements with a common end”.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Mele|1994|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept that Rachlin is referring to is Artistotle’s concept of [[Telos (philosophy)|Telos]], “the final cause” that drives us all forward towards a common end.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Psychologistworld.com|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachlin also found heavy inspiration in the writings and work of Tolman and Bandura after their work in Behaviorism. An example of Artistotle’s concept of Telos could come from the concept of drinking water. While most behaviorists would approach drinking water as a direct reaction to being thirsty, Rachlin would also consider the long-term effects and consider that the person is drinking water so that they do not eventually die of thirst. This far-sighted view offers a different viewpoint into the behaviors of human beings that may not be explained as clearly by operant conditioning, a concept of Behavioral Psychology that mostly focuses upon the short-term reactions that someone has learned. 

On the subject of self-control, Rachlin states that it is less of a subject of knowing that one should not do something and more a matter of patience. He considers those with strong self-control simply more “long-term behaviorally-oriented” or “far-sighted.” This concept of considering further implications in the future is related to many other fields, particularly Rachlin’s second interest of Behavioral Economics. He likens the ability to weight the options of the future to avoiding making short-term poor investments in exchange for profitable, more beneficial ones at a much later point in time. 

Many people{{who|date=April 2012}} criticize Rachlin for his perspective, however, as his concepts of simply considering the potential reactions to certain situations over a longer time frame have been hailed as being closer to a self-help practice of making good investments and life choices than it is close to an actual Psychological practice. His main counter to this argument is that through this approach he has managed to help people by preparing them for potential negative outcomes in the future and trained them to recognize their own potential outcomes behind their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Psychologistworld.com|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rachlin also has a different viewpoint on the subject of [[Free Will]] than most other people. He writes, “the meaning of free will lies not in what may or may not be going on in people’s heads or elsewhere in their bodies, but rather in how the term free will is actually used by the community to describe and to guide overt behavior” {{harv|Rachlin|2007}}. In other words, society’s definitions and expectations are what guide us in terms of what they consider right and wrong as any other external factors do. Our definitions of free-will are contingent upon how much we let them affect our actions.

[[File:Springbok pronk.jpg|thumb|"Behaviour with a purpose": a young [[springbok]] [[stotting]].&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Caro&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347286800525 | title=The functions of stotting in Thomson’s gazelles: Some tests of the predictions | author=Caro, TM |authorlink=Tim Caro | journal=Animal Behaviour | year=1986 | volume=34 | pages=663–684 | doi=10.1016/S0003-3472(86)80052-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biologist might argue that this has the [[function (biology)|function]] of [[signalling theory|signalling to predators]], helping the springbok to survive and allowing it to reproduce.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;]]

'''Teleology in biology''' is the use of the language of goal-directedness in accounts of [[evolution]]ary [[adaptation]], which some [[biology|biologists]] and [[philosophy of science|philosophers of science]] find problematic. The term [[teleonomy]] has also been proposed. Before [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], organisms were seen as existing because God had [[creationism|designed and created]] them; their features such as eyes were taken by [[natural theology]] to have been made to enable them to carry out their [[function (biology)|functions]], such as seeing. [[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologists]] often use similar teleological formulations that invoke purpose, but these imply [[natural selection]] rather than actual goals, whether conscious or not. Dissenting biologists and religious thinkers held that evolution itself was somehow goal-directed ([[orthogenesis]]), and in [[Vitalism|vitalist]] versions, driven by a purposeful life force. Since such views are now discredited, with evolution working by [[natural selection]] acting on inherited variation, the use of teleology in biology has attracted criticism, and attempts have been made to teach students to avoid teleological language.

Nevertheless, biologists still often write about evolution as if organisms had goals, and some [[philosophy of biology|philosophers of biology]] such as [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]] and biologists such as [[J. B. S. Haldane]] consider that teleological language is unavoidable in [[evolutionary biology]].

==Context==
===Teleology===
{{main|Teleology}}

[[Teleology]], from  [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:τέλος|τέλος]], ''telos'' "end, purpose"&lt;ref&gt;Eric Partridge, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xA9dxrhfa5kC&amp;dq= ''Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English''], Routledge, 1977, p. 4187.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wikt:-λογία|-λογία]], ''logia'', "a branch of learning", was coined by the philosopher [[Christian von Wolff]] in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wolff, Christian von |author-link1=Christian Wolff (philosopher)| date=1732 | title=Philosophia Rationalis Sive Logica: Methodo Scientifica Pertractata Et Ad Usum Scientiarum Atque Vitae Aptata |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uQg_AAAAcAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept derives from the ancient Greek philosophy of [[Aristotle]], where the [[final cause]] (the purpose) of a thing is its [[function (biology)|function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Presuppositions of Aristotle's Politics |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-politics/supplement2.html |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Aristotle's biology]] does not envisage [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leroi, Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |pages=272–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrases used by biologists like "a function of&amp;nbsp;... is to&amp;nbsp;..." or "is designed for" are teleological at least in language. The presence of real or apparent teleology in explanations of natural selection is a controversial aspect of the [[philosophy of biology]], not least for its echoes of natural theology.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;&lt;ref name=Futuyma&gt;{{cite book |author=Futuyma, Douglas J. |authorlink=Douglas J. Futuyma |title=Evolutionary Biology |date=1998 |publisher=Sinauer Associates |pages=341, 342 |isbn=978-0-87893-189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Ray from NPG.jpg|thumb|upright|The English [[natural theology|natural theologian]] [[John Ray]], and later [[William Derham]], used teleological arguments to illustrate the glory of God from nature.&lt;ref name=Armstrong2000/&gt;]]

===Natural theology===
{{main|Natural theology}}

Before Darwin, [[natural theology]] both assumed the existence of God and used the appearance of function in nature to argue for the existence of God.&lt;ref name=Ayala/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt; The English [[parson-naturalist]] [[John Ray]] stated that his intention was "to illustrate the glory of God in the knowledge of the works of nature or creation".&lt;ref name=Armstrong2000&gt;{{cite book | title=The English Parson-Naturalist | publisher=Gracewing | author=Armstrong, Patrick | year=2000 | page=46 | isbn=0-85244-516-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural theology presented forms of the [[teleological argument]] or argument from design, namely that organs functioned well for their apparent purpose, so they were well-designed, so they must have been designed by a benevolent creator. For example, the eye had the function of seeing, and contained features like the [[iris (eye)|iris]] and [[lens (eye)|lens]] that assisted with seeing; therefore, ran the argument, it had been designed for that purpose.&lt;ref name=Ayala&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ayala, Francisco J. |authorlink=Francisco J.

===Goal-directed evolution===
{{main|Orthogenesis|Vitalism}}

Religious thinkers and biologists have repeatedly supposed that evolution was driven by some kind of life force, a philosophy known as [[vitalism]], and have often supposed that it had some kind of goal or direction (towards which the life force was striving, if they also believed in that), known as [[orthogenesis]] or evolutionary progress. Such goal-directedness implies a long-term teleological force; some supporters of orthogenesis considered it to be a spiritual force, while others held that it was purely biological. For example, the Russian [[embryologist]] [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] believed in a teleological force in nature,&lt;ref&gt;Barbieri, Marcello. (2013). ''Biosemiotics: Information, Codes and Signs in Living Systems''. Nova Science Publishers. p. 7. {{ISBN|978-1-60021-612-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobsen, Eric Paul. (2005).

Peter Lang. {{ISBN|978-0-8204-7231-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the French [[Spiritualism (philosophy)|spiritualist philosopher]] [[Henri Bergson]] linked orthogenesis with [[vitalism]], arguing for a creative force in evolution known as ''[[élan vital]]'' in his book ''[[Creative Evolution (book)|Creative Evolution]]'' (1907).&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter J. Bowler|Bowler, Peter J]]. (1992). ''The Eclipse of Darwinism: Anti-Darwinian Evolution Theories in the Decades around 1900''. The Johns Hopkins University Press. pp. 116–117. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-4391-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French [[biophysicist]] [[Pierre Lecomte du Noüy]] and the American botanist [[Edmund Ware Sinnott]] developed vitalist evolutionary philosophies known as ''[[telefinalism]]'' and ''[[telism]]'' respectively. Their views were heavily criticized as non-scientific;&lt;ref name="Koch 1957"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Koch | first1 = Leo Francis | year = 1957 | title = Vitalistic-Mechanistic Controversy | url = | journal = [[The Scientific Monthly]] | volume = 85 | issue = 5| pages = 245–255 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[palaeontologist]] [[George Gaylord Simpson]] argued that Du Noüy and Sinnott were promoting religious versions of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, George Gaylord. (1964). ''Evolutionary Theology: The New Mysticism''. In ''This View of Life: The World of an Evolutionist''. Harcourt, Brace &amp; World. pp. 213–233&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jesuit]] [[paleontologist]] [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] argued that evolution was aiming for a supposed spiritual "[[Omega Point]]" in what he called "directed additivity".&lt;ref name="Lane 1996"&gt;Lane, David H. (1996). ''The Phenomenon of Teilhard: Prophet for a New Age''. Mercer University Press. pp. 60–64. {{ISBN|0-86554-498-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;De Chardin, Pierre Teilhard. (2003, reprint edition). ''The Human Phenomenon''. Sussex Academic Press. p. 65. {{ISBN|1-902210-30-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]], in which the [[genetics|genetic]] mechanisms of evolution were discovered, the hypothesis of orthogenesis was largely abandoned by biologists,&lt;ref&gt;Levinton, Jeffrey S. (2001). ''Genetics, Paleontology, and Macroevolution''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 14–16. {{ISBN|0-521-80317-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, Georgina M; Largent, Mark A. (2015).

Wiley. p. 218. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-5625-7}} "With the integration of Mendelian genetics and population genetics into evolutionary theory in the 1930s a new generation of biologists applied mathematical techniques to investigate how changes in the frequency of genes in populations combined with natural selection could produce species change. This demonstrated that Darwinian natural selection was the primary mechanism for evolution and that other models of evolution, such as neo-Lamarckism and orthogenesis, were invalid."&lt;/ref&gt; especially with [[Ronald Fisher]]'s argument in his 1930 book ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]] by [[Stephen Jay Gould]], Chapter 7, section "Synthesis as Restriction"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural selection===
{{main|Natural selection|Evolution}}

[[Natural selection]], introduced in 1859 as the central mechanism{{efn|Darwin also introduced a second mechanism, [[sexual selection]], to explain traits such as the colourful "tail" train of the [[peacock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Darwin, Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |date=1859 |title=On the Origin of Species |edition=1st |page=89 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} of [[evolution]] by [[Charles Darwin]], is the differential survival and reproduction of individuals due to differences in [[phenotype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zimmer |first1=Carl |authorlink1=Carl Zimmer |last2=Emlen |first2=Douglas J. |authorlink2=Douglas Emlen |year=2013 |title=Evolution: Making Sense of Life |edition=1st |publisher=Roberts and Company Publishers |isbn=978-1-936221-17-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism directly implies evolution, a change in [[Heredity|heritable]] [[Phenotypic trait|traits]] of a [[population]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Strickberger's Evolution |edition=4th |author1=Hall, Brian K. |author2=Hallgrímsson, Benedikt |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |date=2008 |pages=4–6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrDD3cyA09kC&amp;pg=PA4|isbn=978-1-4496-4722-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptation===
[[File:Sinornithosaurus IVPP V12811.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--aspect for low image--&gt;|Feathers today serve the function of [[bird flight|flight]], but they were co-opted rather than [[adaptation|adapted]] for this task, having evolved for an earlier purpose in [[theropods]] like ''[[Sinornithosaurus|Sinornithosaurus millenii]]'', perhaps [[Thermal insulation|insulation]].]]
{{main|Adaptation|Function (biology)}}

A trait which persists in a population is often assumed by biologists to have been selected for in the course of evolution, raising the question of how the trait achieves this. Biologists call any such mechanism the function of the trait, using phrases like "A [[Function (biology)|function]] of [[stotting]] by antelopes is to [[signalling theory|communicate to predators]] that they have been detected",&lt;ref name=Stanford&gt;{{cite web |title=Teleological Notions in Biology |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/teleology-biology/ |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=28 July 2016 |date=18 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "The [[primate]] [[hand]] is designed (by natural selection) for grasping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primates - marmosets, monkeys, apes, lemurs, humans|url=http://www.nhptv.org/wild/primates.asp |publisher=NHPTV |accessdate=28 July 2016 |quote=The hands and feet of all primates, except for humans, are designed for grasping. Humans have hands designed for grasping, but not feet! Humans have opposable thumbs.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[adaptation]] is an observable structure or other feature of an organism (for example, an [[enzyme]]) generated by natural selection to serve its current function. A biologist might propose the [[hypothesis]] that [[feather]]s are adaptations for [[bird flight]]. That would require three things: that the trait of having feathers is heritable; that the trait does serve the function of flight; and that the trait increases the [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the organisms that have it. Feathers clearly meet these three conditions in living [[birds]]. However, there is also a historical question, namely, did the trait arise at the same time as bird flight? Unfortunately for the hypothesis, this seems not to be so: [[theropod]] [[feathered dinosaur|dinosaurs had feathers]], but many of them did not fly.&lt;ref name=Berkeley&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding Evolution: Qualifying as an adaptation |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/side_0_0/qualifying_01 |publisher=University of California at Berkeley |accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brusatte, Stephen L.|author2=Lloyd, Graeme T.|author3=Wang, Steve C.|author4=Norell, Mark A. |year=2014 |title=Gradual assembly of avian body plan culminated in rapid rates of evolution across the dinosaur-bird transition |journal=Current Biology |volume=24 |issue=20 |pages=2386–2392  |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2014.08.034 |pmid=25264248}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feathers can be described as an [[exaptation]], having been co-opted for flight but having evolved earlier for another purpose such as [[Thermal insulation|insulation]].

==Status in evolutionary biology==

===Reasons for discomfort===

Apparent teleology is a recurring issue in [[evolutionary biology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Ruse, Michael |editor1link=Michael Ruse |editor2=Travis, J. |date=2009 |title=Evolution: The First Four Billion Years |publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt; much to the consternation of some writers,&lt;ref name="Hanke2004"/&gt; and as an explanatory style it remains controversial.&lt;ref name="Hanke2004"&gt;{{cite book |year=2004 |author=Hanke, David |title=Teleology: The explanation that bedevils biology |pages=143–155 |work=Explanations: Styles of explanation in science |editor=Cornwell, John |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860778-4 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZWpq14vS7WQC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=%22biology+is+sick+%22&amp;q=%22biology%20is%20sick%20%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various reasons for discomfort with teleology among biologists.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ribeiro |first1=Manuel Gustavo Leitao|display-authors=etal|title=On the debate about teleology in biology: the notion of "teleological obstacle"|journal=História, Ciências, Saúde-Manguinhos |date=2015 |volume=22 |issue=4 |doi=10.1590/S0104-59702015005000003 |url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0104-59702015000401321 |pages=1321–1333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstly, the concept of adaptation is itself controversial, as it can be taken to imply, as the evolutionary biologists [[Stephen J. Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]] argued, that biologists agree with [[Voltaire]]'s [[Doctor Pangloss]] in his 1759 satire ''[[Candide]]'' that this is "the best of all possible worlds", in other words that every trait is perfectly suited to its functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gould, Stephen J. |author1link=Stephen J. Gould |author2=Lewontin, Richard |author2link=Richard Lewontin |date=1979 |title=The spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian paradigm:  a critique of the adaptationist programme |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B |issue=205 |pages=581–598 |doi=10.1098/rspb.1979.0086}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, all that evolutionary biology requires is the weaker claim that one trait is at least slightly better in a certain context than another, and hence is selected for.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

[[File:Louis George Meistergraveurin 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Watchmaker analogy]] argues that the presence of a complex mechanism like a watch implies the existence of a conscious designer.]]

Secondly, teleology is linked to the pre-Darwinian idea of [[natural theology]], that the natural world gives evidence of the [[intelligent design|conscious design]] and beneficent intentions of a creator, as in the writings of John Ray.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;  [[William Derham]] continued Ray's tradition with books such as his 1713 ''Physico-Theology'' and his 1714 ''Astro-Theology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Weber, A. S. |title=Nineteenth-Century Science: An Anthology |publisher=Broadview Press |date=2000 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; They in turn influenced [[William Paley]] who wrote a detailed [[teleological argument]] for God in 1802, ''[[Natural Theology, or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity collected from the Appearances of Nature]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Paley |first=William |authorlink=William Paley |title=Natural Theology |date=2006 |origyear=1802 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |url=https://www.academia.edu/1112017/William_Paleys_Natural_Theology_2006_Reprinted_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting with the [[Watchmaker analogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Eddy, Matthew Daniel |title=Nineteenth Century Natural Theology | journal=The Oxford Handbook of Natural Theology | date=2013 | url=https://www.academia.edu/1112017/William_Paleys_Natural_Theology_2006_Reprinted_2008_}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[creationism]], along with a vitalist life-force and directed orthogenetic evolution, has been rejected by most biologists.&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

Thirdly, attributing purposes to adaptations risks confusion with popular forms of [[Lamarckism]] where animals in particular have been supposed to influence their own evolution through their intentions, though Lamarck himself spoke rather of habits of use, and the belief that his thinking was teleological has been challenged.&lt;ref name=Mayr1992/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burkhardt2013"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burkhardt |first1=Richard W. |title=Lamarck, Evolution, and the Inheritance of Acquired Characters |journal=Genetics |volume=194 |issue=4 |year=2013 |pages=793–805 |doi=10.1534/genetics.113.151852}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bednarczyk 2009 pp. 31–98"&gt;{{cite | last=Bednarczyk | first=A | title=&amp;#91;Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck (1744-1829). A dispute on the mechanism of evolution. On the bicentenary of the publication of Philosophie Zoologique (1809)&amp;#93;. | journal=Kwartalnik historii nauki i techniki : Kwartal'nyi zhurnal istorii nauki i tekhniki - | volume=54 | issue=3-4 | year=2009 | issn=0023-589X | pmid=20481104 | language=pl | pages=31–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourthly, the teleological explanation of adaptation is uncomfortable because it seems to require backward causation, in which existing traits are explained by future outcomes; because it seems to attribute the action of a conscious mind when none is assumed to be present in an organism; and because, as a result, adaptation looks impossible to test [[Empirical evidence|empirically]].&lt;ref name=Stanford/&gt;

A fifth reason concerns students rather than researchers: Gonzalez Galli argues that since people naturally imagine that evolution has a purpose or direction, then the use of teleological language by scientists may act as an obstacle to students when [[Teaching evolution|learning about natural selection]]. Such language, he argues, should be removed to make teaching more effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gonzalez Galli |first1=Leonardo Martin |last2=Meinardi |first2=Elsa N. |title=The Role of Teleological Thinking in Learning the Darwinian Model of Evolution |journal=Evolution: Education and Outreach |date=March 2011 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=145–152 |doi=10.1007/s12052-010-0272-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removable teleological shorthand===

Statements which imply that nature has goals, for example where a species is said to do something "in order to" achieve survival, appear teleological, and therefore invalid to evolutionary biologists. It is however usually possible to rewrite such sentences to avoid the apparent teleology. Some biology courses have incorporated exercises requiring students to rephrase such sentences so that they do not read teleologically. Nevertheless, biologists still frequently write in a way which can be read as implying teleology, even though that is not their intention.&lt;ref name=Reiss&gt;{{cite book |author=Reiss, John O. |date=2009 |title=Not by Design: Retiring Darwin's Watchmaker |publisher=University of California Press |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Reiss argues that evolutionary biology can be purged of apparent teleology by rejecting the pre-Darwinian watchmaker analogy for natural selection;&lt;ref name=Reiss/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Depew |first1=David J. |title=Is Evolutionary Biology Infected with Invalid Teleological Reasoning?

Reiss |journal=Philosophy in Theory and Biology |date=2010 |volume=2 |issue=20160629 |doi=10.3998/ptb.6959004.0002.005|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/ptb/6959004.0002.005/--is-evolutionary-biology-infected-with-invalid-teleological?rgn=main;view=fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt; other arguments against this analogy have also been promoted by writers such as the evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dawkins, Richard |date=1987 |title=The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design |publisher=W W Norton |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers of biology such as [[James G. Lennox]] have argued that Darwin was a teleologist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=James G. Lennox |author=Lennox, James G. |date=1993 |title=Darwin was a Teleologist |journal=Biology and Philosophy |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=409–421 |doi=10.1007/bf00857687}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others like [[Michael Ghiselin]] described this claim as a myth promoted by misinterpretations of his discussions, and emphasized the distinction between using teleological metaphors and actually being teleological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1007/BF00850377 | last1=Ghiselin | first1=Michael T. | year=1994 | title=Darwin's language may seem teleological, but his thinking is another matter | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/l1324662n645244w/| journal=Biology and Philosophy | volume=9 | issue=4 | pages=489–492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Askland, from the [[Sandra Day O'Connor College of Law]] claims that unlike [[transhumanism]], an ideology that aims to improve the [[human condition]], which he asserts is "wholly teleological", Darwinian evolution is not teleological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://web.law.asu.edu/Portals/31/Askland_transhumanism_IJETS.pdf |author=Askland, Andrew |title=The Misnomer of Transhumanism as Directed Evolution |journal=International Journal of Emerging Technologies and Society |volume=9 |issue=1 |date=2011 |pages=71–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various commentators view the teleological phrases used in modern evolutionary biology as a type of [[shorthand]] for describing any function which offers an evolutionary advantage through natural selection. For example, the zoologist S. H. P. Madrell wrote that "the proper but cumbersome way of describing change by evolutionary adaptation [may be] substituted by shorter overtly teleological statements" for the sake of saving space, but that this "should not be taken to imply that evolution proceeds by anything other than from mutations arising by chance, with those that impart an advantage being retained by natural selection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Madrell, S.H.P. |date=1998 |title=Why are there no insects in the open sea? |journal=The Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=201 |pages=2461–2464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irreducible teleology===

Other philosophers of biology argue instead that biological teleology is irreducible, and cannot be removed by any simple process of rewording. [[Francisco J. Ayala|Francisco Ayala]] argued that all statements about processes can be trivially translated into teleological statements, and vice versa, but that teleological statements are more explanatory and cannot be disposed of.&lt;ref name=Ayala1977&gt;{{cite book |author=Ayala, Francisco J. |authorlink=Francisco J. Ayala |date=1977 |title=Teleological explanations |editor=Dobzhansky, T. |editorlink=Theodosius Dobzhansky |work=Evolution |publisher=W.H. Freeman |pages=497–504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ayala 1998"&gt;[[Francisco J. Ayala|Ayala, Francisco]] (1998). "Teleological explanations in evolutionary biology." ''Nature's purposes: Analyses of Function and Design in Biology''. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Neander similarly argued that the modern concept of [[function (biology)|biological 'function']] depends on [[natural selection]]. So, for example, it is not possible to say that anything that simply winks into existence, without going through a process of selection, actually has functions. We decide whether an [[appendage]] has a function by analysing the process of selection that led to it. Therefore, Neander argues, any talk of functions must be posterior to natural selection, function must be defined by reference to the history of a species, and teleology cannot be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Neander, Karen (1998). "Functions as Selected Effects: The Conceptual Analyst's Defense," in C. Allen, M. Bekoff &amp; G. Lauder (Eds.), ''Nature's Purposes: Analyses of Function and Design in Biology'' (pp. 313–333). The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] likewise stated that "adaptedness&amp;nbsp;... is an ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' result rather than an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' goal-seeking."&lt;ref name=Mayr1992&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |author=Mayr, Ernst W. |date=1992 |title=The idea of teleology |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=53 |pages=117–135 |doi=10.2307/2709913|jstor=2709913 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angela Breitenbach, looking at the question of teleology in biology from a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] perspective, argues that teleology is important as "a [[heuristic]] in the search for causal explanations of nature and&amp;nbsp;... an inevitable [[analogy|analogical]] perspective on living beings." In her view of Kant, teleology implies something that cannot be explained by science, but only understood through analogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Breitenbach |first1=Angela |title=Teleology in Biology : A Kantian Perspective |date=2009 |pages=31–56 |url=http://www.phil.cam.ac.uk/people/teaching-research-pages/breitenbach/breitenbach-teleologybiology.pdf |journal=Kant Yearbook |volume=2009 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Colin Pittendrigh]] coined the similar term '[[teleonomy]]' for apparently goal-directed biological phenomena.&lt;ref name=Pittendrigh&gt;{{cite book |author=Pittendrigh, Colin S. |authorlink=Colin Pittendrigh |title="Adaptation, natural selection, and behavior" |work=Behavior and Evolution |editor1=Roe, A.|editor2=Simpson, George Gaylord |editor2-link=George Gaylord Simpson|location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |date=1958 |pages=390–416}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernst Mayr]] criticised Pittendrigh's confusion of Aristotle's [[four causes]], arguing that evolution only involved the material and formal but not the efficient cause.{{efn|Both Pittendrigh and Mayr endorsed teleology in biology as an inherent part of evolutionary thinking.&lt;ref name=Pittendrigh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mayr/&gt;}} Mayr proposed to use the term only for "systems operating on the basis of a program of coded information."&lt;ref name=Mayr&gt;{{cite book |author=Mayr, Ernst |authorlink=Ernst Mayr |chapter=Cause and effect in biology |editor=Lerner, D. |title=Cause and effect |publisher=Free Press |location=New York |date=1965 |pages=33–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William C. Wimsatt]] affirmed that the teleologicality of the language of biology and other fields derives from the logical structure of their background theories, and not merely from the use of teleological locutions such as "function" and "in order to". He stated that "To replace talk about function by talk about selection [...] is not to eliminate teleology but to rephrase it". However, Wimsatt argues that this thought does not mean an appeal to [[backwards causation]], [[vitalism]], [[entelechy]], or [[Antireductionism|anti-reductionist]] sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wimsatt, W. |authorlink=William C. Wimsatt |year=1972 |title=Teleology and the logical structure of function statements |journal=Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science |volume=3 |pages=1–80 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0039368172900143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] observed that "Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he's unwilling to be seen with her in public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hull, D. |title=Philosophy of Biological Science |publisher=Prentice-Hall |date=1973 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst]] (1974) Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Volume XIV, pages 91–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge''''' ({{lang-fr|La condition postmoderne: rapport sur le savoir}}) is a 1979 book by [[Jean-François Lyotard]], in which Lyotard analyzes the [[epistemology|notion of knowledge]] in [[postmodernity|postmodern]] society as the end of 'grand narratives' or [[metanarrative]]s, which he considers a quintessential feature of [[modernity]]. Lyotard introduced the term 'postmodernism', which was previously only used by art critics, into philosophy and social sciences, with the following observation: "Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity towards metanarratives".&lt;ref name="Lyotard"&gt;Lyotard, Jean-François (1979).

London/New York: Verso, pp. 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from the 1984 (reprint 1997); English translation by [[Geoffrey Bennington]] and [[Brian Massumi]], University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally written as a report on the influence of technology in [[exact science]]s, commissioned by the ''Conseil des universités du [[Québec]]'', ''The Postmodern Condition'' was influential.&lt;ref name="Bruneault"&gt;Bruneault, Frédérick (Autumn 2004). "[https://www.ulaval.ca/phares/vol5-automne04/texte03.html Savoir scientifique et légitimation]", ''Revue PHARES'' vol. '''5'''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-Francois (1979). [http://www.cse.gouv.qc.ca/fichiers/documents/publications/ConseilUniversite/Problemes_savoir_soc_indus_develop-1980.pdf "Les problèmes du savoir dans les sociétés industrielles les plus développées"]. Quebec: Conseil des Universités. Original report available online at: http://www.cse.gouv.qc.ca/FR/Publications_CUniv/&lt;/ref&gt; Lyotard later admitted that he had a "less than limited" knowledge of the science he was to write about, deeming ''The Postmodern Condition'' his worst book.

==Summary==
Lyotard criticizes metanarratives such as [[reductionism]] and [[teleology|teleological]] notions of human history such as those of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Marxism]], arguing that they have become untenable because of [[technology|technological]] progress in the areas of [[communication]], [[mass media]] and [[computer science]]. Techniques such as [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine translation]] show a shift to [[language|linguistic]] and symbolic production as central elements of the [[postindustrial]] economy and the related postmodern culture, which had risen at the end of the 1950s after the reconstruction of [[western Europe]]. The result is a plurality of [[language-game]]s (a term coined by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]&lt;ref name="Lyotard"/&gt;{{rp|67}}), of different types of argument. At the same time, the goal of truth in science is replaced by "performativity" and efficiency in the service of capital or the state, and science produces paradoxical results such as [[chaos theory]], all of which undermine science's grand narrative.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; Lyotard professes a preference for this plurality of small narratives that compete with each other, replacing the [[totalitarianism]] of grand narratives.

==Reception==
''The Postmodern Condition'' was influential.&lt;ref name="Bruneault" /&gt; However, Lyotard later admitted that he had a "less than limited" knowledge of the [[science]] he wrote about, and to compensate for this knowledge, he "made stories up" and referred to a number of books that he hadn't actually read. In retrospect, he called it "a [[parody]]" and "simply the worst of all my books".&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; Poet [[Frederick Turner (poet)|Frederick Turner]] writes that, like many post-structuralist works, ''The Postmodern Condition'' "has not worn well." However, he sees it more readable than other post-structuralist works, and credits Lyotard with covering "a good deal of ground in a lively and economical fashion."&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Frederick. ''The Culture of Hope: A New Birth of the Classical Spirit''. The Free Press, 1995, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''[[Associated Press]]'' story in 1995 also used the phrase, relating an official's guess that the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] was the work of "maybe five malcontents" and not "some kind of vast right-wing conspiracy."{{sfn|Safire|2008}}

==1995 memo==
A 332-page memo titled "Communication Stream of Conspiracy Commerce" was commissioned by [[Mark Fabiani]] and written by [[Chris Lehane]] in 1995. It was the first document to describe the conspiracies surrounding the Clintons, which Hillary Clinton later popularized with the term "vast right-wing conspiracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Garofoli |first=Joe |url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/joegarofoli/article/The-Spinner-How-Chris-Lehane-revered-by-some-2679295.php |title=The Spinner / How Chris Lehane, revered by some and reviled by others, gets the campaign consultant job done |date=October 24, 2004 |work=SFGate |accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It described how online conservative media outlets such as ''[[The American Spectator]]'' spread conspiracy theories about the [[suicide of Vince Foster]], the [[Whitewater controversy]], and other events. According to the memo, these conspiracies spread from conservative think tanks to British tabloids, and then to the mainstream press.&lt;ref name="ABC memo"&gt;{{cite web |last=Good |first=Chris |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/04/clinton-white-houses-conspiracy-theory-of-right-wing-conspiracy-theories/ |title=Clinton White House's Conspiracy Theory of Right-Wing Conspiracy Theories |date=April 18, 2014 |work=ABC News |accessdate=January 11, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113090638/http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/04/clinton-white-houses-conspiracy-theory-of-right-wing-conspiracy-theories/ |archive-date=2017-01-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Today Show'' interview==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
In response to ongoing accusations surrounding the Clintons' investment in a real estate development known as [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Clinton's [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[Janet Reno]] had appointed an [[independent counsel]], [[Kenneth Starr]], to investigate those accusations in 1994.  Starr's investigation began to branch out into other issues, from [[Filegate]] to [[Travelgate]] to Bill Clinton's actions in the civil case of his alleged sexual harassment of [[Paula Jones]] prior to his presidency.  In the course of the last of these, [[White House]] intern [[Monica Lewinsky]] signed an affidavit that she had not had a relationship with Clinton, but Lewinsky's confidant [[Linda Tripp]] had been recording their phone conversations and offered Starr tapes of Lewinsky describing her feelings for, and alleging intimate encounters with, the president.  The president was asked to give a deposition, and accusations that he lied about an affair under oath first made national headlines on January 17, 1998, when the story was picked up by the conservative-right e-mail newsletter ''[[The Drudge Report]]''.  Despite swift denials from President Clinton, the media attention grew.

On January 27, 1998, Hillary Clinton appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', in an interview with [[Matt Lauer]].

{{quote|'''Matt Lauer''': You have said, I understand, to some close friends, that this is the last great battle, and that one side or the other is going down here.

'''Hillary Clinton''': Well, I don't know if I've been that dramatic. That would sound like a good line from a movie. But I do believe that this is a battle. I mean, look at the very people who are involved in this—they have popped up in other settings. This is—the great story here for anybody willing to find it and write about it and explain it is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for president.}}

Clinton elaborated by decrying the tactics "and the kind of intense political agenda at work here".  [[Bob Woodward]] recounts in his book ''The Agenda'' (1994) that the then-first lady claimed that when her husband was making his decision to run for the presidency in 1991, he reported receiving "a direct threat from someone in the Bush White House, warning that if he ran, the Republicans would go after him. 'We will do everything we can to destroy you personally,' she recalled that the Bush White House man had said."&lt;ref name="WP1998"/&gt;

==Later uses==
[[David Brock]], a conservative-turned-liberal author, has said he was once a part of an effort to dredge up a scandal against Clinton.&lt;ref name="apology"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/10/brocks.remorse/ | title=Reporter Apologizes For Clinton Sex Article | publisher=[[CNN]] |date= March 10, 1998 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2008-10-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080614124146/http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/03/10/brocks.remorse/ |archivedate = June 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 Brock, then of the ''[[American Spectator]]'', was the first to report Paula Jones' claims.&lt;ref name="apology"/&gt; As Brock explained in ''[[Blinded by the Right]]'', after learning more about the events and conservative payments surrounding [[Paula Jones]] he personally apologized to the Clintons. He documented his experience in ''[[Blinded by the Right|Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative]]'', wherein he alleged that Arkansas state troopers had taken money in exchange for testimony against Clinton which Brock had published in a previous book. [[Adam Curtis]] also discusses the concept in his documentary series ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]''.  Brock has agreed with Clinton's claim that there was a "Right wing conspiracy" to smear her husband, quibbling only with the characterization of it as "vast", since Brock contends that it was orchestrated mainly by a few powerful people. [[MSNBC]] also described the comment as once-ridiculed but now taken more seriously by "many Democrats" who point "to the well-documented efforts by conservative financier Richard Mellon Scaife to fund a network of anti-Clinton investigations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17593375/ns/politics-decision_08/t/clinton-vast-right-wing-conspiracy-back/ |title=Clinton: Vast right-wing conspiracy is back |publisher=MSNBC |agency=Associated Press |date=March 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific claims of such funding have been made against conservative Republican supporter and billionaire [[Richard Mellon Scaife]].&lt;ref&gt;Media Transparency, [http://www.mediatransparency.org/scaifeaggregate.php Aggregated Grants from the Scaife Foundations.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608130352/http://www.mediatransparency.org/scaifeaggregate.php |date=2007-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scaife played a major role in funding the [[Arkansas Project]] investigating President Clinton; former Clinton [[White House Counsel]] [[Lanny Davis]] claimed Scaife was using his money "to destroy a president of the United States."  Scaife claims to be public about his political spending (q.v.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scaife.org|title=scaife.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). CNN stated in a study the news outlet conducted on Scaife, "If it's a conspiracy, it's a pretty open one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/27/scaife.profile/ | work=CNN | accessdate=May 27, 2010 | title=Who Is Richard Mellon Scaife? | first=Brooks | last=Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hillary Clinton wrote in her 2003 autobiography, "Looking back, I see that I might have phrased my point more artfully, but I stand by the characterization of Starr's investigation [regardless of the truth about Lewinsky]."&lt;ref&gt;''Living History'', p. 446.&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007 her experiences caused Hillary Clinton to say in presidential campaign appearances that the vast right-wing conspiracy was back, citing such cases as the [[2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17593375/ Clinton: Vast right-wing conspiracy is back], MSNBC/AP, March 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Stump speech (politics)|stump]] for [[Al Franken]]'s 2008 Senate campaign, Bill Clinton acknowledged his [[Air America Radio]] show by quipping that he had been taking on the "vast right wing conspiracy before others even acknowledged that it existed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/10/21/hillary_clinton_al_franken_and.html|title=Hillary Clinton, Al Franken and the Return of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=October 21, 2008|author=Kane, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former President Clinton, when asked on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' (September 27, 2009) whether the vast right wing conspiracy was involved in the attacks on President [[Barack Obama]], said "Oh, you bet.  Sure it is.  It's not as strong as it was, because America's changed demographically, but it's as virulent as it was ... when they accused me of murder and all that stuff."&lt;ref name = MTP&gt;Meet the Press, 21 Sept. 2009, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/33032390/ns/meet_the_press/page/2/ transcript]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other figures who have used the phrase are Nobel laureate economist [[Paul Krugman]] and journalist [[Joe Conason]]. Conason, in an article called "The vast right-wing conspiracy is back," refers the [[National Republican Trust PAC]] and [[Newsmax Media]], which are run by former foes of Bill Clinton and who made attacks on then-President Barack Obama.  The National Republican Trust PAC sponsored a campaign commercials against Obama in 2008 which [[FactCheck.org]] described as "one of the sleaziest false TV ads of the campaign."  One of Newsmax Media's owners "was among the most insistent endorsers of the [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|Obama birth certificate myth]]" and a popularizer of  the canard that Bill Clinton's White House counsel [[Suicide of Vince Foster|Vince Foster]] did not commit suicide—as determined by five official investigations—but was murdered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2009/10/05/clinton_obama_17/ The vast right-wing conspiracy is back]. Salon.com Oct 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In some of his books, Krugman has used the phrase ("Yes, Virginia, there is a vast right-wing conspiracy"{{sfn|Krugman|2004|pages=217, 269–71}}) to refer not to a conservative Republican-leaning campaign against Clinton (or Obama), but more generally to "an interlocking set of institutions ultimately answering to a small group of people that collectively reward loyalists and punish dissenters" in the service of "[[movement conservatism]]."  The network of institutions provide 

&lt;blockquote&gt;obedient politicians with the resources to win elections, safe havens in the event of defeat, and lucrative career opportunities after they leave office. They guarantee favorable news coverage to politicians who follow the party line, while harassing and undermining opponents. And they support a large standing army of party intellectuals and activists.{{sfn|Krugman|2007|page=163}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Krugman's view, the network of foundations that fund conservative scholarship, the national and regional think tanks and advocacy groups, talk radio media outlets, and conservative law firms through which they pushed their agenda to move the Republican Party to the right, far surpass in funding, size, inter-connectedness or influence anything the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] or the American liberal movement have at their disposal.

==2014 reemergence==
In April 2014, the [[Clinton Presidential Center]] published the original 1995 memo on the conspiracy.&lt;ref name="ABC memo"/&gt; The memo's author, Chris Lehane, wrote, "As for the premise of the memo, I absolutely stand by it. Not only was it right about the right wing then, it is more accurate than ever today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lehane |first=Chris |url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/04/chris-lehane-right-wing-conspiracy-memo-106059 |title=Yeah, I Wrote the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy Memo |date=April 27, 2014 |work=POLITICO Magazine |accessdate=January 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2016 reemergence==
In 2016, Hillary Clinton said she still believed in the "vast right-wing conspiracy", adding that it was "even better funded" 18 years later.&lt;ref name="cbscondon"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Condon|first1=Stephanie|title=Hillary Clinton: The vast, right-wing conspiracy" is "even better funded" now|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hillary-clinton-the-vast-right-wing-conspiracy-is-even-better-funded-now/|accessdate=February 5, 2016|work=CBS News|date=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chance|first1=Seales|title=Hillary Clinton's affinity for conspiracy theories|url=http://wiat.com/2016/08/14/hillarys-clintons-affinity-for-conspiracy-theories/|website=[[WIAT]].com|publisher=[[LIN Media|LIN Television Corp.]] ([[Media General]])|location=[[Birmingham, AL]]|date=August 14, 2016|quote=...

In October, after [[Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording|footage]] of [[Donald Trump]] boasting about his sexual exploits emerged and [[Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations|multiple women accused Trump of sexual misconduct]], [[Melania Trump]] defended her husband and said, "This was all organized from the opposition."&lt;ref name="LA Times-Melania"&gt;{{cite web |last=Mehta |first=Seema |url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/politics/trailguide/la-na-trailguide-updates-melania-trump-echoes-hillary-clinton-as-1476823147-htmlstory.html |title=Melania Trump echoes Hillary Clinton as she defends her husband |date=October 18, 2016 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' noted that Melania's response "echoed" Hillary's original use of the phrase "vast right-wing conspiracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tumulty |first=Karen |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/melania-trump-takes-a-page-from-hillary-clintons-playbook-clean-up/2016/10/18/7c0420b2-9520-11e6-bc79-af1cd3d2984b_story.html |title=Melania Trump takes a page from Hillary Clinton's playbook |date=October 18, 2016 |work=Washington Post |accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times-Melania"/&gt;

==Use in popular culture==
After the release of a deposition Bill Clinton had given to [[Starr Report|the Independent Counsel]] in which he [[perjury|perjured]] himself, some conservatives began to adopt the VRWC phrasing ironically. In 2004, conservative lawyer [[Mark W. Smith]] wrote the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller]] ''[[Official Handbook of the Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy]]'', which came with a "membership card" that made its owner an "official member of the VRWC."  Similarly, a number of newspaper, magazine, and website articles have used the phrase to report on [[left-wing politics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/magazine/25DEMOCRATS.html |title=Wiring the Vast Left-Wing Conspiracy |work=[[The New York Times Magazine]] |date=2004-07-25 |first=Matt |last=Bai |publisher=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=May 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407220527/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/magazine/25DEMOCRATS.html |archivedate=April 7, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://webm.powerparcel.com/domains/domainsponsor_all.php?parent=dsflip_live&amp;domain=joinspencer.com | title=The Clinton-McFarland Connection: A vast left-wing conspiracy? | access-date=2007-04-28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504020428/http://webm.powerparcel.com/domains/domainsponsor_all.php?parent=dsflip_live&amp;domain=joinspencer.com# | archive-date=2007-05-04 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eugene Volokh]]'s blog [[The Volokh Conspiracy]] is said to have derived its name from as a reference to the "Vast right-wing conspiracy" statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/168389/the-volokh-conspiracy|title=The Volokh Conspiracy Is Out To Get You|newspaper=Tablet Magazine|access-date=2017-02-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''What is Philosophy?''''' ({{lang-fr|Qu'est-ce que la philosophie?}}) is a 1991 book by French authors [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], respectively a philosopher and a psychoanalyst.

==Background==
Deleuze commented in a letter to one of his translators that his purpose in writing ''What is Philosophy?'' was to address "the problem of absolute immanence" and to explain why he considered [[Baruch Spinoza]] the "prince of philosophers."{{sfn|Deleuze|1990|page=11}}

==Summary==
{{cleanup section||reason=Section is currently based on a secondary source discussing the work. It should be based principally on the book itself|date=June 2018}}
[[Deleuze and Guattari]] deal with the distinction between [[philosophy]] and [[science]], arguing that the former deals with concepts and the latter with functions. They discuss the [[philosophy of science]] and the [[philosophy of mathematics]].{{sfn|Sokal|Bricmont|1999|pages=155–159}}

==Reception==

The physicists [[Alan Sokal]] and [[Jean Bricmont]], writing in ''[[Fashionable Nonsense]]'' (1997), state that ''What is Philosophy'' became a best-seller in France in 1991. They argue that in attempting to show how philosophy and science are distinct, Deleuze and Guattari use scientific terms such as "[[Chaos theory|chaos]]" in incorrect or misleading ways, and that while in some passages they seem to discuss serious problems in the philosophy of science and mathematics, these passages prove to be largely meaningless on close inspection.{{sfn|Sokal|Bricmont|1999|pages=155–159}}

The philosopher [[Roger Scruton]], writing in ''Fools, Frauds and Firebrands: Thinkers of the New Left'' (2016), criticized ''What is Philosophy?'', describing it as poorly written.{{sfn|Scruton|2016|pages=192–193}}

The '''White Wind Zen Community''' (WWZC) is based at the '''Zen Centre of Ottawa''' (''Honzan Dainen-ji'') in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], with branch centres in [[Wolfville, Nova Scotia]] and [[Harrow, London|Harrow, England]]. The Community is led by the Venerable Anzan Hoshin [[Rōshi|roshi]]. It consists of both a monastic order, the Northern Mountain Order, and a large community of associate, general, and formal lay students.

The WWZC was founded in 1985 as the '''White Wind Zazenkai''' (''Hakukaze Zazenkai''), named after the Hakukaze-ji monastery of Anzan Hoshin roshi's teacher, the late Ven. Yasuda Joshu Dainen Hakukaze. The association was renamed "White Wind Zen Community" in 1989. While Anzan Hoshin roshi is still in permanent residence at the Ottawa centre, he retired from public teaching in 1991 and currently teaches only monastic and formal students. Lay teaching is currently performed by his Dharma-successors, the Ven. Shikai Zuiko o-sensei and the Ven. Jinmyo Renge osho, and by practice advisors trained by Anzan Hoshin roshi.

In addition to offering an intensive schedule of practice year-round, including sittings, [[sesshin]] and outreach of a Western Zen centre, the WWZC provides a large number of individual students outside of commuting distance of the monastery or its branches with long-distance training. The long-distance training program provides students practice interviews and daisan via [[e-mail]], telephone, or letter, and grants students access to a library of over 2000 recorded [[dharma talk]]s. The WWZC also publishes books and audio recordings through its publishing arm, Great Matter Publications.
