'''Alfred Whitney Griswold''' (October 27, 1906 – April 19, 1963), who went by his second given name, was an [[United States|American]] [[historian]] and [[educator]].  He served as [[List of Presidents of Yale University|16th President]] of [[Yale University]] from 1951 to 1963, during which he built much of Yale's modern scientific research infrastructure, especially on [[Science Hill (Yale University)|Science Hill]].

==Early life==
Griswold was born in [[Morristown, New Jersey]], the son of Elsie Montgomery (Whitney) and Harold Ely Griswold.&lt;ref&gt;http://drs.library.yale.edu/HLTransformer/HLTransServlet?stylename=yul.ead2002.xhtml.xsl&amp;pid=mssa:ms.0255&amp;query=&amp;clear-stylesheet-cache=yes&amp;hlon=yes&amp;big=&amp;adv=&amp;filter=&amp;hitPageStart=&amp;sortFields=&amp;view=all&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Hotchkiss School]] in 1925,&lt;ref name=AlumniAchievements&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hotchkiss.org/alumni/Accomplishments.aspx |title=Alumni Award: PREVIOUS RECIPIENTS |publisher=The Hotchkiss School |date=2004 |accessdate=March 8, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310133421/http://www.hotchkiss.org/alumni/Accomplishments.aspx |archivedate=March 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before obtaining his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from [[Yale University]] in 1929, where he edited campus humor magazine ''[[The Yale Record]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Griswold, A. Whitney (November 18, 1927). 'Harvard Men "Moist", According to Associate Editor of ''Yale Record'': Only Those Who Think Too Much or Not at All at Harvard-Finds Polish of Little Use in Selling Bonds'. ''The Harvard Crimson''. Cambridge: Harvard Crimson.&lt;/ref&gt;

Griswold was a descendant, on his mother's side, of [[Eli Whitney]], and of [[List of colonial governors of Connecticut|six colonial governors of Connecticut]] on his father's side.&lt;ref&gt;Karabel, Jerome. ''The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admissions and Exclusion at [[Harvard]], Yale, and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]'', Houghton Mifflin and Company, New York, 2005. p. 222. {{ISBN|978-0-618-57458-2}}, {{ISBN|0-618-57458-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an undergraduate, Griswold, along with a handful of students and faculty members, founded the [[Yale Political Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Yale Groups Turn to Politics; New Union's Plan to Train an Intelligent Minority for Leadership Is Approved|date=December 9, 1934|work=[[The New York Times]]|pages=N3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kabaservice, Geoffrey. ''The Guardians: [[Kingman Brewster]], His Circle, and the Rise of the Liberal Establishment'', New York: Holt,  2004. p. 51. {{ISBN|0-8050-6762-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
He taught English for a year, then changed to history, which he taught at Yale from 1933, becoming an assistant professor in 1938, an associate professor in 1942, and a full professor in 1947. Griswold received a Ph.D. in the new field of History, the Arts and Letters, writing the first dissertation in [[American Studies]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Karabel, Jerome. ''The Chosen: The Hidden History of Admissions and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton'', Houghton Mifflin and Company, New York, 2005. p. 222. {{ISBN|0-618-57458-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American cult of success was the dissertation's subject, informed in part by Griswold's brief time on Wall Street between his graduation and the [[stock market crash of 1929]].&lt;ref&gt;"Yale in the Great Depression", [[Gaddis Smith]], [[Yale Alumni Magazine]], p. 38, November/December 2009|Volume LXXIII, Number 2&lt;/ref&gt; Griswold authored ''The Far Eastern Policy of the United States'' (1938), ''Farming and Democracy'' (1948), ''Essays on Education'' (1954), ''In the University Tradition'' (1957), and ''Liberal Education and the Democratic Ideal'' (1959).&lt;ref name="eb"/&gt; Although Griswold was not a specialist in foreign affairs, his 1938 book on Far Eastern policy was an elegantly written and vigorous survey which for many years was the most influential work in the field.&lt;ref&gt;See the essays by John Garraty and Ernest May in Dorothy Borg, ed., ''Historians and American Far Eastern Policy'' (New York: East Asian Institute, Columbia University,  1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

===President of Yale University===
In 1951, Griswold became President of Yale University, serving until his death in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[[Time Magazine]] Cover Story, 11 June 1951, article pgs. 74 - 82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', Vol. 12, ''[[Micropædia]]'' 15th edition, Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc, Vol. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Griswold was unaware of his imminent rise to the presidency. The day of his elevation, he told his wife, "Thank God we're not in that racket," after they had lunched with a friend, the president of [[Mount Holyoke College]].&lt;ref&gt;Karabel, Jerome. ''The Chosen: The History of Admissions and Exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton'', Houghton Mifflin and Company, New York, 2005. p.222. {{ISBN|0-618-57458-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As president, Griswold is credited with tripling the university endowment to $375 million, building 26 new buildings and establishing research fellowships for young scholars, particularly in the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]], "New Haven, Safe Haven", Apr. 17, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; He was arguably Yale's first modern president, and was widely quoted in the national media for his views on foreign affairs, amateur athletics, academic freedom, and in defense of the liberal arts against government intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;Oren, Dan. ''Joining the Club: A History of [[Jews]] and Yale'', [[Yale University Press]], New Haven and [[London]], 2000. p. 221. {{ISBN|0-300-08468-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griswold also worked in successful collaboration with [[Nathan Pusey]], his counterpart at Harvard, to maintain amateurism in athletics among universities known now as the [[Ivy League]].&lt;ref&gt;Bergin, Thomas A. ''[[The Game (Harvard-Yale)|The Game]]: The Harvard – Yale Football Rivalry, 1875–1983'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London. p. 200. {{ISBN|0-300-03267-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to create the eleventh and twelfth [[residential colleges at Yale University|residential colleges]] at Yale, known as [[Morse College]] and [[Ezra Stiles College]], was made by Griswold. In 1952, he established Masters of Arts programs in teaching, affiliated with the traditional liberal arts departments. During [[World War II]] he headed special U.S. Army training programs in languages and civil affairs.

==Quotes==
On ideas and the banishment of books:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Books won't stay banned. They won't burn. Ideas won't go to jail. In the long run of history, the censor and the inquisitor have always lost. The only sure weapon against bad ideas is better ideas. The source of better ideas is wisdom. The surest path to wisdom is a liberal education. —Alfred Whitney Griswold, "Essays on Education,"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On coeducation at Yale:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:By keeping in step with the male,/
:we proceed at the pace of the snail./
:Said the Dean of Admission,/
:"Let's switch our position/
:and get some fast women at Yale!"&lt;ref&gt;letters to the editor, from Sarah Griswold Leahy, Yale Alumni Magazine, p. 4, November/December 2009|Volume LXXIII, Number 2&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Personal life==
Griswold was married to Mary Brooks (1906–1997). His former home, at 237 East Rock Road in New Haven, is a contributing property in the [[Prospect Hill Historic District (New Haven, Connecticut)|Prospect Hill Historic District]].&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=79002670}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Prospect Hill National Register District / Prospect Hill |date=January 5, 1979 |author=Susan Ryan |publisher=National Park Service|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''And Then There Were Fewer'''" is the hour-long premiere of the [[Family Guy (season 9)|ninth season]] of the American [[animated series|animated television series]] ''[[Family Guy]]''. This and most of the season 9 episodes were produced for the eighth season. It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on September 26, 2010. The episode follows the citizens of [[Family Guy#Setting|Quahog]] after they are invited by actor [[James Woods]] to his stately mansion on a remote island. While there, a series of murders occurs, and the group struggles to determine who committed the mysterious acts, before ultimately attempting to escape from the island, and avoid being murdered themselves. The episode borrows its premise and title from [[Agatha Christie]]'s murder mystery ''[[And Then There Were None]]'', while also serving as a parody of the film ''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]''.

The episode was written by [[Cherry Chevapravatdumrong]] and directed by [[Dominic Polcino]]. It received high acclaim from critics, who praised its storyline and cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 9.41 million homes in its original airing. The episode features guest performances by [[Drew Barrymore]], [[H. Jon Benjamin]], [[Max Burkholder]], [[Colin Ford]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Ashley Tisdale]] and [[James Woods]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. It was the first ''Family Guy'' episode to air in [[720p]] high definition. The episode was nominated for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series|Outstanding Music Composition for a Series]] at the [[63rd Primetime Emmy Awards]]. "And Then There Were Fewer" was released on [[DVD]] along with two other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011. The show confirmed afterwards that it was part of the show's "real" canon and those characters that died (i.e. Diane Simmons, Muriel Goldman etc.) would not be brought back in the future. However, James Woods is seen in the thirteenth episode of [[Family Guy (season 10)|season 10]], "[[Tom Tucker: The Man and His Dream]]", in which he tells Peter and Tom that paramedics brought him to a secret science lab made for celebrities and revived him.

==Plot==
Most of the known residents of [[Family Guy#Setting|Quahog]] are invited to a dinner party in his palatial mansion by [[James Woods]], who states he has become a [[born again (Christianity)|born-again]] [[Christianity|Christian]] thanks to his new girlfriend Priscilla, and wishes to repent for all his wrongdoings. Early into the night, as Woods and Priscilla go to the kitchen, [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]]'s new companion, Stephanie, is mysteriously shot when she sits in Woods's seat, leading the guests to believe Woods intends to murder them all. They try to leave, but lightning strikes a tree, causing it to break the [[bridge]]. Meanwhile, the main road is flooded due to the storm. Returning amidst accusations, Woods pleads ignorance before he too is murdered in front of the guests by an unseen killer with a knife during a [[power outage]], causing Priscilla to [[Syncope (medicine)|faint]]. Trapped on the remote estate with no way of contacting anyone due to a thunderstorm and being out of cell range, the guests realize that the killer is among them. They also discover that Stephanie's body has disappeared.

While the guests search for clues in discovering the killer's identity, they realise that many of them had motives for wanting revenge on James Woods. The Griffins suffered harassment and identity theft at Woods’ hands, Tom Tucker did not take the part of [[Freddy Krueger]] in ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'' due to James advising him not to, Brian had the pilot of his series messed up by James, and Quagmire lost [[Cheryl Tiegs]] due to him, while Consuela the Mexican maid says Woods molested her nephew, causing him to commit suicide. After reading a notebook belonging to Woods and found in a secret room, [[List of characters in Family Guy#Mort Goldman|Mort Goldman]]'s wife, Muriel, disappears after it is discovered that she was being blackmailed by Woods, causing everyone to suspect her as the culprit. Peter accidentally gets Joe knocked out, so he organizes the search groups, however several of them are separated from each other due to the secret passages. However, Muriel turns up dead soon after by being stabbed in the back with the same knife that killed James, placing suspicion on Priscilla, who also disappeared during the commotion. [[List of characters in Family Guy#Jillian Russell|Jillian]]'s husband, Derek goes to an upper balcony to find a cell phone signal and contact the police, but is soon murdered by the unseen killer with Woods's [[Golden Globe Award]]. The guests search everyone's rooms until they locate the bloodstained award and Priscilla's dead body in [[List of characters in Family Guy#Tom Tucker|Tom Tucker]]'s guest room. Tom is thus implicated as the killer and is chased and caught by [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], [[List of characters in Family Guy#Joe Swanson|Joe]], [[List of characters in Family Guy#Carl|Carl]], [[List of characters in Family Guy#Dr. Elmer Hartman|Dr. Hartman]], [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]], [[List of characters in Family Guy#Seamus|Seamus]], and Mayor [[Adam West (Family Guy)|Adam West]].

Tom is arrested by the police and the guests prepare to leave. [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] goes to comfort Tom's co-anchor, [[List of characters in Family Guy#Diane Simmons|Diane Simmons]], only to intuitively realize she is the true murderer when Diane shows a dress for her solo debut on the news, even though she couldn't have known Tom would be leaving. Diane reveals that she had dated Woods until he dumped her upon her fortieth birthday, around which Tom arranged her to be replaced on the Channel 5 News. Seeking revenge, Diane bribed Priscilla to make James become a born-again Christian and throw the dinner party so she could murder Woods and frame Tom for the crime, but was forced to kill the other guests after her plan went awry upon Stephanie's accidental death. Priscilla woke up when she was removing the knife due to Joe pointing out her [[fingerprint]]s were on it, so had her throat slit. When Diane was hiding the body in Tom's room, Muriel saw her so she was stabbed. The murderess did not have time to conceal the knife, but was able to wipe her fingerprints clean. She killed Derek to stop the police getting involved. Diane then attempts to silence Lois by forcing her outside to a nearby cliff, only to be shot down herself with a [[suppressor|suppressed]] [[sniper rifle]] fired by [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], who proclaims if anyone kills Lois, it would be him. The scene then changes to everyone leaving without knowing what had just happened.

==Cultural references==
[[File:Jeff Probst.jpg|left|thumb|165px|''Survivor'' host Jeff Probst was referenced in the episode.]]
The episode borrows heavily from the 1985 comedy film ''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'', the 1976 comedy film ''[[Murder by Death]]'', and is largely based upon the 1939 Agatha Christie novel ''[[And Then There Were None]]''.&lt;ref name="season9"/&gt; The opening scene of the episode is similar to that of Stanley Kubrik's ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''. Once the Griffin family arrives at the mansion, Lois remarks on the estate's beauty, wondering if television host [[Jeff Probst]] has a similar home.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt; As they walk into the mansion, Sir [[John Everett Millais]]'s ''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'' is seen. As dinner commences, Carl begins conversing with Tom Tucker, and discusses the plot of the 1986 fantasy film ''[[Labyrinth (film)|Labyrinth]]'', directed by [[Jim Henson]].&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;{{cite video|date= 2010-05-09|title=Family Guy Volume Nine Audio Commentary|people=Hentemann, Mark|medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox|accessdate=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Tucker is accused of murdering James Woods, he reveals that Woods talked him out of auditioning for the [[Robert Englund|lead]] role in the 1984 hit horror film ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street]]''.&lt;ref name="commentary2"&gt;{{cite video |date= 2011-05-09 |title= Family Guy Volume Nine Audio Commentary |people=Chevapravatdumrong, Cherry |medium= DVD |publisher= 20th Century Fox |accessdate=2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finger is then pointed at [[Mayor West]], who tells the group of his hardships on the [[social network service|social networking]] service [[Twitter]], after Woods stole his originally intended username.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt; Diane Simmons also goes on to state that Woods had promised to introduce her to former [[CBS]] news anchor [[Dan Rather]], but ultimately ended up introducing her to actor and comedian [[Danny Bonaduce]] instead.&lt;ref name="commentary2"/&gt;

In the extended DVD release, Carl mentions ''[[No Way Out (1987 film)|No Way Out]]'', ''[[Hard Rain (film)|Hard Rain]]'' and ''[[Days of Thunder]]''.&lt;ref name="commentary2"/&gt;

While searching for Muriel Goldman throughout the mansion, Brian and Stewie begin humming and singing the theme song to several television shows, including the CBS science fiction series ''[[Lost in Space]]'', the CBS sitcom ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', and the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.&lt;ref name="commentary2"/&gt; After discovering the Golden Globe Award underneath Tom Tucker's bed, Tucker begins to profess his innocence, with Peter then instructing him to "tell it to [[Mike Judge]]."&lt;ref name="commentary2"/&gt;

In the scene where Diane tells Lois her conspiracy, Picasso's painting [[Le Rêve (Picasso)|''Le Rêve'']] can be seen on the wall behind Diane. At the end of the episode, Seamus asks, "When we all see each other at school on Monday, are we still gonna be friends?" in a reference to ''[[The Breakfast Club]]''.

==Reception==
"And Then There Were Fewer" was broadcast on September 26, 2010, as a part of an animated television night on Fox, and was preceded by the season premiere of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and ''Family Guy'' creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane's spin-off, ''The Cleveland Show''. It was watched by 8.85 million viewers in its first half-hour, and concluded with a total 9.41 million viewers in its second half-hour, according to [[Nielsen ratings]], despite airing simultaneously with the season premiere of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], the season premiere of ''[[The Amazing Race (U.S. TV series)|The Amazing Race]]'' on [[CBS]] and ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' on [[NBC]].

In the summary of her review, Zutter wrote that it was a "fun murder mystery that lets us see all our favorite Quahog folks", while continuing to wonder whether the characters who were killed off would remain dead.&lt;ref name="ology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ology.com/screen/fox-animation-domination-review-simpsons-cleveland-show-and-family-guy |title=Fox "Animation Domination" Review: 'The Simpsons,' 'The Cleveland Show,' and 'Family Guy' |publisher=Ology |last=Zutter |first=Natalie |accessdate=2010-10-09 |date=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Eames of entertainment website ''[[Digital Spy]]'' placed the episode at number 14 on his listing of the best ''Family Guy'' episodes in order of "yukyukyuks" – compiled in 2017 to honor the 18th anniversary of the show – and praised the interaction of characters who do not normally interact, writing, "We never thought we'd see Jillian's boyfriend Derek hanging out with Seamus the sea captain."&lt;ref name="Eames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/feature/a809510/best-ever-family-guy-episodes-so-far/|title=The 16 best ever Family Guy episodes in order of yukyukyuks|last=Eames|first=Tom|date=19 March 2017|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=19 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He expressed his shock at the death of characters such as Muriel Goldman and Diane Simmons and noted, "That's one way to cut some dead wood."&lt;ref name="Eames"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6347">The ''Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures (APiCS)'' is a comparative linguistic atlas of contact languages. It exists as a four volume publication&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Susanne Maria Michaelis |editor2=Philippe Maurer |editor3=Martin Haspelmath |editor4=Magnus Huber|title=The Atlas and Survey of Pidgin and Creole Languages|date=September 2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967770-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and online database in the form of a website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Michaelis, Susanne Maria  |author2=Maurer, Philippe |author3=Haspelmath, Martin |author4=Huber, Magnus|title=Atlas of Pidgin and Creole Language Structures Online|url=http://apics-online.info/|website=APiCS Online|accessdate=28 March 2015|location=Leipzig|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;[http://apics-online.info/ APiCS Online].

The atlas was edited by [[Susanne Maria Michaelis]] &amp; [[Philippe Maurer]] &amp; [[Martin Haspelmath]] &amp; [[Magnus Huber]]. The project ran between 2006 and 2013. The project involved 78 linguists contributing with data on languages that they are experts on.&lt;ref name="APiCS Contributors"&gt;{{cite web|title=APiCS Contributors|url=http://apics-online.info/contributors|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes APiCS different from other similar surveys of languages where there is typically one or a team of researchers gathering data on many languages by reading different descriptions. The project also has a wiki page [https://web.archive.org/web/20150402121751/http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/apics/index.php/About_APiCS APiCS wikipage].

APiCS gathers comparable synchronic data on the grammatical and lexical structures of a large number of pidgin and creole languages. The data is presented in the form of maps and profile pages for each language. The profile pages for the languages also includes sociohistorical information about each language. The published physical volumes contains more information of this kind than the online version.

==Languages included==
The project covers 76 contact languages ([[pidgin]]s, [[Creole language|creole]]s and [[mixed language]]s). The language set contains not only the most widely studied Atlantic and Indian Ocean creoles, but also less well known pidgins and creoles from Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Melanesia and Australia, including some extinct varieties. The Atlas does not make any classification into what is and what is not a pidgin/creole/mixed language. It is up to the readers and users of the database to make these classifications. This is a very important point, as it is inappropriate to refer to all languages in the APiCS as [[Creole language|creoles]].

Each language is the responsibility of a single author or a team of authors, which were requested to fill out a questionnaire for the 130 structural features and to write a sociohistorical and grammatical survey article for their language. There are also 18525 audio examples online to illustrate the features for each language.

==Structural features==
The database consists of 130 structural features which are drawn from all areas of grammar: phonology, morphology, syntax and lexicon. A feature has between two and nine values, shown on the maps by different colours and shapes of the language symbols. The online version of the database includes interactive map display and various filtering and search functions, allowing users to address various research questions. Furthermore, the online version also includes sound files of every language, enabling the users to listen to a short text that is glossed and translated.

One of the important differences between APiCS and World Atlas of Language Structures, as well as other earlier surveys of languages, is that APiCS allows for languages to be coded for more than one strategy. For example, in the WALS there is one feature for the order of Subject, Object and Verb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dryer|first1=Matthew|title=Order of Subject, Object and Verb|url=http://wals.info/chapter/81|website=WALS|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each language in WALS is coded as having one of the orders, or "no dominant order". In APiCS there is a mirror feature, but here each language can be coded for having more than one order and the distribution is given in percentages. The language [[Media Lengua]] for example is coded as having 30% SVO and 70% SOV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muysken|first1=Pieter|title=Media Lengua: Datapoint order of Subject, Object and Verb.|url=http://apics-online.info/valuesets/73-1|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributors cannot select any percentage, they choose between the following:
* exclusively (100%)
* pervasive (90%)
* majority (70%)
* about half (50%)
* minority (30%)
* marginal (10%)

When a summary is given for a feature users are displayed both with information on how many languages are coded as that value exclusively or as shared. There are for example 61% languages in APiCS that are coded as exclusively having the order SVO, and 10 that are coded as having that order and other orders as well (shared).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=APiCS Consortium|title=Order of Subject, Object and Verb|url=http://apics-online.info/parameters/1#2/30.3/10.0|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==APiCS and the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS)==
APiCS was inspired by the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS), which shows the geographical distribution of 142 features in an average of 400 languages worldwide. Pidgins and creoles were not completely excluded from WALS, but since the primary goal was to present the precolonial linguistic areas, pidgins and creoles were backgrounded. APiCS contains 48 features on which information is also available in WALS [http://apics-online.info/wals APiCS-WALS], so that creoles and pidgins can readily be compared with their substrate and superstrate languages, as well as with the world's languages in general. However, APiCS does not copy WALS blindly, but adds many features that did not make it into WALS but are important for contact languages. Other features that appear in WALS have been modified to suit the needs of the APiCS users.

As stated above, one of the major differences between WALS and APiCS is that APiCS allows for multiple values for one feature whereas WALS does not.

==Background==
One of Humphries' early stage characters was a surfer named Buster Thompson, who served as a prototype for Barry McKenzie. Humphries has noted that after Peter Cook heard a recording of Thompson in New York in 1962, he invited him to devise a similar character for ''Private Eye''.&lt;ref name="Pierre2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Matthew St Pierre|title=A Portrait of the Artist as Australian: L'Oeuvre bizarre de Barry Humphries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OKRLjvu0u4oC&amp;pg=PA166|date=30 September 2004|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-7162-4|pages=166–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The comic strip about a "randy, boozy Australian rampaging through [[Swinging London]]" was very popular, but Eye editor [[Richard Ingrams]] eventually dropped it on account of Humphries’ drinking and missing deadlines (Ingrams gave up alcohol in the 1960s, as did Humphries in the 1970s). Ingrams said that "Humphries was at that stage a serious alcoholic".&lt;ref&gt; "The consummate amateur" by William Cook, ''The Oldie'' [London], September 2016 page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
The ''Private Eye'' comic strips were compiled into three books, ''The Wonderful World of Barry McKenzie'' (1968), in which McKenzie travels to Britain to claim his inheritance, followed by ''Bazza Pulls It Off!'' (1971), and later, ''Bazza Comes Into His Own: The Final Fescennine Farago of Barry McKenzie, Australia's First Working-Class Hero—With Learned and Scholarly Appendices and a New Enlarged Glossary '' (1979). The first two books were published in [[London]] and initially banned in Australia with the Minister for Customs and Excise stating the comic "relied on indecency for its humour".&lt;ref name="ajph"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4249926/The-Mythical-Australian-Barry-Humphries.html|title=The Mythical Australian: Barry Humphries, Gough Whitlam and "new nationalism"|journal=The Australian Journal of Politics and History|date=1 March 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726022756/http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-4249926/The-Mythical-Australian-Barry-Humphries.html|archivedate=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three books and unpublished strips were compiled for ''The Complete Barry McKenzie: Not so Much a Legendary Strip, More a Resonant Social History Per Se'', which was published in 1988 and featured a preface by [[Sir Les Patterson]].

==Films==
In 1972, the film ''[[The Adventures of Barry McKenzie]]'' was released, based on the first published book. In 1974, a sequel, ''[[Barry McKenzie Holds His Own]]'', was made. The films starred Barry Crocker as McKenzie, and chronicled the character's adventures in Britain and [[France]] respectively. In the films, McKenzie is the [[nephew]] of another of Humphries' characters, [[Dame Edna Everage|Edna Everage]]. Despite the banning of ''The Wonderful World of Barry McKenzie'' in Australia, the films received considerable support from the Australian government of [[John Gorton]], becoming the first to receive funding from the [[Australian Film Development Commission]]. Australian Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] appeared in ''Barry McKenzie Holds His Own'', granting a [[Dame (title)|damehood]] to McKenzie's aunt, [[Edna Everage]].&lt;ref name="ajph" /&gt;

==Character==
The character was a parody of the boorish Australian overseas, particularly those residing in Britain – ignorant, loud, crude, drunk, and punchy – although McKenzie also proved popular with Australians because he embodied some of their positive characteristics: he was friendly, forthright, and straightforward with his British hosts, who themselves were often portrayed as stereotypes of pompous, arrogant, devious colonialists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australianscreen.com.au/titles/adventures-barry-mckenzie/ The Adventures of Barry McKenzie (1972)], [[National Film and Sound Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;

McKenzie frequently employs [[euphemism]]s for bodily functions or sexual allusions, one of the most well-known being "technicolour yawn" ([[vomiting]]).&lt;ref name="partridge"&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English |last=Partridge |first=Eric |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | isbn=0-415-25938-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film popularised several Australian euphemisms and slang terms which are still used today in the Australian vernacular (such as "point Percy at the porcelain", "sink the sausage" and "flash the nasty").&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt; Some of the sayings were invented by Humphries, while other terms were borrowed from existing [[Australian slang]] such as "chunder"&lt;ref&gt;Quinion, Michael: [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0206d&amp;L=worldwidewords&amp;P=92 Q&amp;A: Chunder] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606065504/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0206d&amp;L=worldwidewords&amp;P=92 |date=June 6, 2008 }}, ''World Wide Words'', 22 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and "up shit creek"&lt;ref&gt;[http://everything2.com/?node_id=112183 Up Shit Creek without a paddle] Everything2, 26 November 2002&lt;/ref&gt; (adopted by the Australian poetry magazine ''[[Shit Creek Review]]'').

[[Men at Work]] lead singer [[Colin Hay]] said that the lyrics for "[[Down Under (song)|Down Under]]" were inspired by the Barry McKenzie character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=2962 Down Under song information] Songfacts; Retrieved 27 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8617">[[File:Jonson 1616 folio Workes title page.jpg|180px|thumb|Title page of ''The Workes of Beniamin Ionson'' (1616), the first folio publication that included stage plays.]]

The '''folio collections of [[Ben Jonson]]'s works''' published in the seventeenth century were crucial developments in the publication of English literature and English Renaissance drama. The first folio collection, issued in [[1616 in literature|1616]],&lt;ref&gt;Brady and Herendeen, pp. 11–22 and ff.&lt;/ref&gt; treated stage plays as serious works of literature instead of popular ephemera—at the time, a controversial position. The 1616 folio stood as a precedent for other play collections that followed—most notably the [[First Folio]] of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] plays in [[1623 in literature|1623]], but also the first [[Beaumont and Fletcher]] folio of [[1647 in literature|1647]], and other collections that were important in preserving the dramatic literature of the age for subsequent generations.

==The first folio, 1616==
The first Jonson folio of 1616, printed and published by [[William Stansby]] and sold through bookseller [[Richard Meighen]],&lt;ref&gt;When printers like Stansby acted as publishers, they usually had to arrange with one or more booksellers to sell their books—as, for one example, [[Thomas Creede]] sold his books through [[William Barley]].&lt;/ref&gt; contained nine plays, all previously published, plus two works of non-dramatic poetry, thirteen [[masques]], and six "entertainments."

*Plays:
** ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]''
** ''[[Every Man out of His Humour]]''
** ''[[Cynthia's Revels]]''
** ''[[The Poetaster]]''
** ''[[Sejanus: His Fall]]''
** ''[[Volpone]]''
** ''[[Epicoene, or the Silent Woman]]''
** ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]''
** ''[[Catiline: His Conspiracy]]''
* Poetry:
** ''Epigrams''
** ''The Forest''
* Masques:
** ''[[The Masque of Blackness]]''
** ''[[The Masque of Beauty]]''
** ''[[Hymenaei]]''
** ''[[The Hue and Cry After Cupid]]''
** ''[[The Masque of Queens]]''
** ''[[The Speeches at Prince Henry's Barriers]]''
** ''[[Oberon, the Faery Prince]]''
** ''[[Love Freed from Ignorance and Folly]]''
** ''[[Love Restored]]''
** ''A Challenge at Tilt, at a Marriage''
** ''The Irish Masque at Court''
** ''[[Mercury Vindicated from the Alchemists]]''
** ''[[The Golden Age Restored]]''
* Entertainments:
** ''[[The Coronation Triumph|The King's Entertainment in Passing to His Coronation]]'' [''The Coronation Triumph'']
** ''A Panegyre, on the Happy Entrance of James''
** ''[[The Entertainment at Althorp|A Particular Entertainment of the Queen and Prince (at Althorp)]]'' [''The Satyr'']
** ''A Private Entertainment of the King and Queen (on May-Day)'' [''The Penates'']
** ''The Entertainment of the Two Kings (of Great Britain and Denmark)'' [''The Hours'']
** ''An Entertainment of King James and Queen Anne''

The first five of the masques, from ''Blackness'' through ''Queens'', had been printed previously, as had three of the entertainments, the ''Panegyre'', and the ''Epigrams''.

==The abortive 1631 addition==
In [[1631 in literature|1631]] Jonson planned a second volume to be added to the 1616 folio, a collection of later-written works to be published by [[Robert Allot]].&lt;ref&gt;Allot was a member of the syndicate of booksellers who published the Shakespeare [[Second Folio]] in [[1632 in literature|1632]].&lt;/ref&gt; Jonson, however, became dissatisfied with the quality of the printing (by John Beale), and cancelled the project. Three plays were set into type for the projected collection, and printings of those typecasts were circulated—though whether they were sold commercially or distributed privately by Jonson is unclear. The three plays are:
* ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]''
* ''[[The Devil Is an Ass]]''
* ''[[The Staple of News]]''

Allot died in 1635; in the 1637&amp;ndash;39 period, the rights to Jonson's works were involved in a complex legal dispute between [[Philip Chetwinde]], the second husband of Allot's widow, and stationers [[Andrew Crooke and William Cooke|Andrew Crooke]] and John Legatt, who believed they owned the rights to the works.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, pp. 75-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The second folio, 1640/1==
Two folio collections of Jonsonian works were issued in 1640-41. The first, printed by Richard Bishop for Andrew Crooke, was a 1640 reprint of the 1616 folio with corrections and emendations; it has sometimes been termed "the second edition of the first folio." The second volume was edited by Jonson's literary executor Sir [[Kenelm Digby]], and published by [[Richard Meighen]],&lt;ref&gt;Meighen, like Allot, was a member of the Shakespeare Second Folio syndicate.&lt;/ref&gt; in co-operation with Chetwinde. That volume contained later works, most of them unpublished or uncollected previously—six plays (including the three printed in 1631), two of them incomplete, and fifteen masques, plus miscellaneous pieces. In the Digby/Meighen volume—identified on its title page as "the Second Volume" of Jonson's works—the varying dates (1631, 1640, 1641) in some of the texts, and what editor William Savage Johnson once called "irregularity in contents and arrangement in different copies," have caused significant confusion.

* Plays:
** ''[[Bartholomew Fair]]''
** ''[[The Devil Is an Ass]]''
** ''[[The Magnetic Lady]]''
** ''[[A Tale of a Tub (play)|A Tale of a Tub]]''
** ''The Sad Shepherd'' (unfinished)
** ''Mortimer: His Fall'' (fragment)
* Masques:

** ''[[The Vision of Delight]]''
** ''[[Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue]]''
** ''For the Honour of Wales''
** ''[[News from the New World Discovered in the Moon]]''

** ''[[Love's Welcome at Bolsover]]''
* Miscellaneous:
** ''Underwoods''
** ''Horace, His Art of Poetry''
** ''The English Grammar''
** ''Timber, or Discoveries''

==The third folio, 1692==
The [[1692 in literature|1692]] single-volume third folio was printed by Thomas Hodgkin and published by a syndicate of booksellers—the title page lists [[Henry Herringman|H. Herringman]], E. Brewster, T. Bassett, R. Chiswell, M. Wotton, and G. Converse.&lt;ref&gt;Herringman, Brewster, and Chiswell were members of the four-man syndicate that published the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Fourth Folio]] of Shakespeare's plays in [[1685 in literature|1685]]. Herringman was one of three stationers who issued the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|second Beaumont and Fletcher folio]] in [[1679 in literature|1679]].&lt;/ref&gt; The third folio added two works to the previous total: the play ''[[The New Inn]],'' and ''Leges Convivales''.

Two other works by Jonson were left out of the 17th-century folios but added to later editions: the plays ''[[The Case is Altered]]'' and ''[[Eastward Ho]]'' (the latter written with Marston and [[George Chapman]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12065">'''Cactus Hill''' is an archaeological site in southeastern [[Virginia]], [[United States]] located on sand dunes above the [[Nottoway River]] about 45 miles south of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. The site receives its name from the prickly pear [[cacti]] that can be found growing abundantly on-site in the sandy soil. Cactus Hill is one of the oldest archaeological sites in the Americas. If proved to have been inhabited 16,000 to 20,000 years ago, it provides evidence supporting the [[Solutrean hypothesis]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/Cactus_Hill_Archaeological_Site|title = Cactus Hill Archaeological Site|last = Johnson|first = Michael F.|date = 11 July 2012|accessdate = 2 January 2014|website = Encyclopedia Virginia|publisher = Virginia Foundation for the Humanities}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has yielded multiple levels of prehistoric inhabitance with two discrete levels of early [[Paleoindian]] activity, but this evidence has not been accepted by mainstream archeologists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|title = Pre-Clovis Occupation on the Nottoway River in Virginia|date = |url = http://www.athenapub.com/cacthill.htm|journal = Athena Review|issue = 3|accessdate = 2 January 2014|volume = 2|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
According to some archaeologists, such as [[Dennis Stanford]] and Joseph and Lynn McAvoy, the Cactus Hill site furnishes evidence of a pre-[[Clovis culture|Clovis]] population in North America. They consider Cactus Hill significant because it challenges established models of [[Paleo-Indian]] migration.

The  [[Clovis culture#Clovis First / Single origin hypothesis|Clovis first]] hypothesis which most anthropologists now reject, is the argument that the people associated with the Clovis culture were the first widespread inhabitants of the Americas.&lt;ref name="arstechnica.com"&gt;https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/11/majority-of-scientists-now-agree-that-humans-came-to-the-americas-by-boat/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, this view was supported by the discovery of a flint spearhead found at [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. A mammoth skeleton that was laid next to the spearhead was dated as being from 11,500 [[Before Present|BP]]. At the time, this was one of the earliest indications of human activity in the Americas. The evidence suggested that the introduction of the [[Clovis point]] coincided with the extinction of the [[megafauna]] on the continent;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|title = Stone Age Colombus|date = 21 November 2002|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2002/columbus.shtml|work = Horizon|publisher = BBC|accessdate = 2 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; furthermore, it was believed that these people came to the Americas from Siberia through the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]] – a stretch of land that resulted from low sea levels during the [[Wisconsin glaciation]]. It is hypothesized that this allowed for migration between 14,500 and 14,000 BP.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In February 2014, as published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', researchers reported on the results of [[DNA]] analysis of [[Anzick boy]], a 2018-era skeleton, supported this theory in two directions: his DNA showed a connection to an estimated 80 percent of the Native Americans in both the Americas, as well as being connected to ancestral peoples in Siberia or northeast Asia.&lt;ref name="geo"&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/02/140212-anzik-skeleton-dna-montana-clovis-culture-first-americans/ Ker Than, "Oldest Burial Yields DNA Evidence of First Americans"], ''National Geographic'', 12 February 2014, accessed 20 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire theory concerning the first inhabitants being the Clovis culture was reevaluated following the discoveries at Cactus Hill in the mid-1990s. With the emergence of new evidence, the hypothesis for a pre-Clovis human occupation began to surface. A 2008 DNA study suggested "a complex model for the peopling of the Americas, in which the initial differentiation from Asian populations ended with a moderate bottleneck in Beringia during the last glacial maximum (LGM), around approximately 23,000 to approximately 19,000 years ago. Toward the end of the LGM, a strong population expansion started approximately 18,000 and finished approximately 15,000 years ago. These results support a pre-Clovis occupation of the New World, suggesting a rapid settlement of the continent along a Pacific coastal route."&lt;ref name="Fagundes, Nelson J 2008 pp. 1–10"&gt;Fagundes, Nelson J.R. ''et al.'' (2008) "Mitochondrial Population Genomics Supports a Single Pre-Clovis Origin with a Coastal Route for the Peopling of the Americas," ''The American Journal of Human Genetics'' 82(March): pp. 1–10, {{doi|10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.11.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Pre-Clovis site, the [[Page-Ladson prehistory site|Page-Ladson site]], has since been discovered in [[Florida]] and many scientists now believe that first Americans probably arrived by boat, long before the Bering land bridge became ice free.&lt;ref name="arstechnica.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/05/underwater-discovery-reveals-14550-year-old-florida-mastodon-hunters/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discoveries ==
Several inches of sand lie between the Clovis-era deposit and a lower level. This lower level, attributed to a pre-Clovis time period, includes:
*Two [[Clovis points]]. Microwear on the points indicates that [[hafting]] was used. Fractures on the tips have been interpreted as meaning that they were projectiles that broke on impact.
*Blades. Microwear indicates that they were hafted and used for butchering and hide processing.
*Elevated phosphate levels, an indication of human occupation
*An ample amount of [[phytolith]]s, which were further analyzed and determined to come from carbonized hickory wood
*20 specimens of faunal remains, of those identifiable include: ten turtle shell fragments, two whitetail deer toe bone fragments, and five fossil shark's teeth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rose|first=Michael|title=Cactus Hill Update|journal=Archaeology|date=April 10, 2000|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/online/news/cactus.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Site integrity ==
Other researchers have questioned the site due to its settlement on a sand hill. The sandy foundation has the potential to yield inconsistent stratigraphy,.&lt;ref&gt;"A Journey to a New Land." Cactus Hill. N.p., n.d. Web. 16 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; James C. Baker of [[Virginia Tech]] conducted soil analysis that indicated that the formation of the site consisted of wind-blown sand deposits. Further research by James Feathers of the University of Washington confirmed that the buried sand levels had been undisturbed by later deposits. Along with this, paleoethnobotanist Lucinda McWeeney of Yale University identified charred plant remains. From this, she was able to identify a correlation between the stone artifacts and plant use at the site. The correlation indicates that the human occupation levels at the site have not been mixed. Dr. Carol Mandryk of Harvard University performed tests for the area that produced the 15,000-year-old date that showed relative stratigraphic integrity. Her tests at another area of the site failed to show proof that the sediments had not been disturbed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Research done by Richard I. Macphail of the Institute of Archaeology in London and Joseph M. McAvoy of The Nottoway River Survey contributed to the integrity discussion using a micromorphological analysis of the stratigraphy of the site.  Their micromorphological observations, along with previous analyses, confirmed a series of conclusions on the integrity of Cactus Hill.  They found that the formation of dunes may have been interspersed with the brief formation of a fine, phytolith-rich topsoil.  As humans lived on these brief topsoil layers, they deposited artifacts and charcoal.  Similarly, animals were present, which added to the dispersal and mixing of fine soil into sand dunes through their burrowing practices.  The stratified sequence that can be seen today is the result of sedimentation that was interrupted by erosional processes like deflation.  That sequence, based on the small-scale animal disturbance in a thin section of the strata, was most likely stable for millions of years.  According to Macphail and McAvoy's analysis, it appears that the site is intact with only a few minor disturbances that could affect the long-term integrity of the site's stratigraphy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macphail|first1=Richard|last2=McAvoy|first2=Joseph|title=A micromorphological analysis of stratigraphic integrity and site formation at Cactus Hill, an Early Paleoindian and hypothesized pre-Clovis occupation in south-central Virginia, USA|journal=Geoarchaeology|date=August 15, 2008|volume=23|issue=5|pages=675–694|doi=10.1002/gea.20234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
Many hypotheses began to arise as a result of this pre-Clovis evidence. One such hypothesis is advocated by Dennis Stanford. In what is known as the Solutrean hypothesis, he suggests that European Solutreans migrated to the Americas across the Atlantic Ocean. The supporting evidence for this hypothesis includes the discovery of artifacts at Cactus Hill dated to the time period between the Clovis and Solutrean and, perhaps just as strongly, evidence of the same technology used between the two cultures. According to Dr. Bruce Bradley, "the Cactus Hill flint was a technological midpoint between the French Solutrean style and the Clovis points dating five millennia later."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The major criticism to this hypothesis is that there is simply not enough evidence to support it. In their journal article, Lawrence Guy Straus, David J. Meltzer, and Ted Goebel claim, "We believe that the many differences between Solutrean and Clovis are far more significant than the few similarities, the latter being readily explained by the well-known phenomenon of technological convergence or parallelism."&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Lawrence Guy, David J. Meltzer, and Ted Goebel. "Ice Age Atlantis? Exploring the Solutrean-Clovis 'connection'." ''World Archaeology'' 37.4 (2005): 507-32. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Solutrean hypothesis is generally disregarded by mainstream archeologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = First Peoples in the New World|last = Meltzer|first = David|publisher = University of California Press|year = 2009|isbn = 9780520267992|location = |pages = 188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparative analysis==
Cactus Hill site is often compared to the [[Meadowcroft Rockshelter]] since there are numerous parallels between these sites.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Pre-Clovis artifacts from Meadowcroft Rockshelter include a lanceolate point (named the Miller Lanceolate), bifaces, unifaces, prismatic blades, core fragments, and debitage. Remains from other Pre-Clovis sites (e.g., Cactus Hill and [[Saltville (archaeological site)|Saltville]], Virginia, [[Topper (archaeological site)|Topper]], South Carolina, etc.) are usually compared to the Meadowcroft assemblage.&lt;ref&gt;Goodyear 2001; McAvoy and McAvoy 1997; Standford and Bradley 2002:259-260&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, claims for Pre-Clovis inhabitants in other sections of the New World also are evaluated with Meadowcroft in mind (Lozano Ruiz 2000).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nps.gov/nhl/apply/pdfs/Section8_Meadowcroft.pdf Meadowcroft - Significance of Property] www.nps.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonathan Luther''' "'''Casey'''" '''Jones''' (March 14, 1863 – April 30, 1900)&lt;ref name=factpage&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.caseyjones.com/caseyjones/facts.htm |title=Facts About Casey Jones |publisher=CaseyJones.com |accessdate=December 26, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128123645/http://www.caseyjones.com/caseyjones/facts.htm |archivedate=November 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Jackson, Tennessee]], was an American railroader who worked for the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] (IC). He was killed on April 30, 1900, when his train collided with a stalled freight train near [[Vaughan, Mississippi]]. His dramatic death while trying to stop his train and save the lives of his passengers made him a hero; he was immortalized in a popular ballad sung by his friend Wallace Saunders, an [[African-American]] [[Wiper (occupation)|engine wiper]] for the IC.&lt;ref name="Jones Home"&gt;[http://www.caseyjones.com/pages/serv01.htm The Historic Casey Jones Home &amp; Railroad Museum in Jackson, Tennessee] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060528101831/http://www.caseyjones.com/pages/serv01.htm |date=May 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, John A and Lomax, Alan. (1934) ''American Ballads and Folk Songs''. Macmillan., p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a boy, he lived near [[Cayce, Kentucky]], where he acquired the nickname of "Cayce", which he chose to spell as "Casey".&lt;ref&gt;''Erie Railroad Magazine'' Vol 24 (April 1928), No 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;13,44.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
Jones married Mary Joanna ("Janie") Brady (born 1866), whose father owned the boarding house where Jones was staying. Since she was [[Catholic]], he decided to convert and was baptized on November 11, 1886, at St. Bridget's Catholic Church in [[Whistler, Alabama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i7BXmLgxYfAC |title=Casey Jones: Epic of the American Railroad |first=Fred J. |last=Lee |publisher=Lee Press |year=2008 |isbn=9781443728928}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r103:E14OC3-269: |work=Congressional record |title=Casey Jones' Whistler Museum And Park – Hon. Sonny Callahan (Extension of Remarks – October 14, 1993)}}&lt;/ref&gt; to please her. They were married at St. Mary's Catholic Church in Jackson on November 25, 1886. They bought a house at 211 West Chester Street in Jackson, where they raised their three children. By all accounts he was a devoted family man and [[teetotaler]].&lt;ref name="Jones Home"/&gt;

==Promotion to engineer==
Jones went to work for the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad|Mobile &amp; Ohio Railroad]], performed well and was promoted to [[brakeman]] on the [[Columbus, Kentucky]], to Jackson, Tennessee, route, and then to [[Fireman (steam engine)|fireman]] on the Jackson, Tennessee, to [[Mobile, Alabama]], route.&lt;ref name="Water Valley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.watervalley.net/users/caseyjones/home.htm |title=Water Valley Casey Jones Railroad Museum in Water Valley, Mississippi |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314111107/http://www.watervalley.net/users/caseyjones/home.htm |archivedate=2008-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1887, a [[yellow fever]] epidemic struck many train crews on the neighboring [[Illinois Central Railroad]] (IC), providing an unexpected opportunity for faster promotion of firemen on that line. On March 1, 1888, Jones switched to IC, firing a freight locomotive between Jackson, Tennessee, and [[Water Valley, Mississippi]].

He was promoted to engineer, his lifelong goal, on February 23, 1891. Jones reached the pinnacle of the railroad profession as an expert locomotive engineer for IC. Railroading was a talent, and Jones was recognized by his peers as one of the best engineers in the business. He was known for his insistence that he "get her there on the advertised" (time) and that he never "fall down": arrive at his destination behind schedule. He was so punctual, it was said that people set their watches by him.

His work in Jackson primarily involved freight service between Jackson and [[Water Valley, Mississippi]]. Both locations were busy and important stops for IC, and he developed close ties with them between 1890 and 1900.&lt;ref name="Jones Home" /&gt;

==Famous train whistle==
Jones was also famous for his peculiar skill with the [[train whistle]]. His whistle was made of six thin tubes bound together, the shortest being half the length of the longest. Its unique sound involved a long-drawn-out note that began softly, rose and then died away to a whisper, a sound that became his trademark. The sound of it was variously described as "a sort of [[Eastern whip-poor-will|whippoorwill]] call," or "like the war cry of a Viking." People living along the IC line between Jackson and Water Valley would turn over in their beds late at night upon hearing it and say "There goes Casey Jones" as he roared by.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

==Service at the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893==
During the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] at [[Chicago, Illinois]], in 1893, IC was charged with providing commuter service for the thousands of visitors to the fairground. A call was sent out for trainmen who wanted to work there. Jones answered it, spending a pleasant summer there with his wife. He shuttled many people from Van Buren Street to Jackson Park during the exposition. It was his first experience as an engineer in passenger service and he liked it.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

At the fair (also called The Chicago World's Fair), he became acquainted with No. 638, a big new freight engine IC had on display as the latest and greatest technological advancement in trains. It had eight drive wheels and two pilot wheels, a [[2-8-0]] "Consolidation" type. At the closing of the fair, No. 638 was due to be sent to Water Valley for service in the Jackson District. Jones asked for permission to drive the engine back to Water Valley. His request was approved, and No. 638 ran its first {{convert|589|mi|km}} with Jones at the throttle to Water Valley. Jones liked No. 638 and liked working in the Jackson District because his family was there. They had once moved to Water Valley, but returned to Jackson, which they felt was home.

Jones drove the engine until he transferred to Memphis in February 1900. No. 638 stayed in Water Valley. That year he drove the engine that became most closely associated with him, for one time. That was Engine No. 382, known affectionately as "Ole 382.", or "Cannonball". It was a steam-driven Rogers [[4-6-0]] "Ten Wheeler" with six drivers, each approximately six feet (1.8 m) high. Bought new in 1898 from the [[Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works|Rogers Locomotive Works]], it was a very powerful engine for the time. When a potential disaster arose, all of Jones's skill and the engine's responsiveness were put to the greatest test.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

His regular fireman on No. 638 was his close friend, John Wesley McKinnie, with whom he worked exclusively from about 1897 until he went to the passenger run out of Memphis. There he worked with his next and last fireman, Simeon T. "Sim" Webb in 1900.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

==Rescue of a child from the tracks==
A little-known example of Jones's heroic instincts in action is described by his biographer and friend Fred J. Lee in his book ''Casey Jones: Epic of the American Railroad'' (1939). He recounts an incident in 1895 as Jones's train approached [[Michigan City, Mississippi]]. He had left the cab in charge of fellow engineer Bob Stevenson, who had reduced speed sufficiently for Jones to walk safely out on the running board to oil the relief valves. He advanced from the running board to the steam chest and then to the pilot beam to adjust the spark screen. He had finished well before they arrived at the station, as planned, and was returning to the cab when he noticed a group of small children dart in front of the train some {{convert|60|yd|m}} ahead. All cleared the rails easily except for a little girl who suddenly froze in fear at the sight of the oncoming locomotive. Jones shouted to Stevenson to reverse the train and yelled to the girl to get off the tracks in almost the same breath. Realizing that she was still immobile, he raced to the tip of the pilot or cowcatcher and braced himself on it, reaching out as far as he could to pull the frightened but unharmed girl from the rails. The event was partially spoofed in ''[[The Brave Engineer]]'', in which the hero rescued a damsel from a cliché bandit.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

==Baseball player==
Jones was an avid [[baseball]] fan and watched or participated in the game whenever his schedule allowed. During the 1880s, he had played at [[Columbus, Kentucky]], while he was a cub operator on the M &amp; O. One Sunday during the summer of 1898, the Water Valley shop team was scheduled to play the Jackson shop team and Jones got to haul the team to Jackson for the game.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

==Rules infractions==
Jones was issued nine citations for rules infractions in his career, with a total of 145 days suspended.  But in the year prior to his death, Jones had not been cited for any rules infractions.  Railroaders who worked with Jones liked him but admitted that he was a bit of a risk-taker. Unofficially though, the penalties were far more severe for running behind than breaking the rules. He was by all accounts an ambitious engineer, eager to move up the seniority ranks and serve on the better-paying, more prestigious passenger trains.

==Transfer to passenger trains==
Jones, in February 1900, was transferred from Jackson, Tennessee, to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], for the passenger run between Memphis and [[Canton, Mississippi]].  This was one link of a four-train run between [[Chicago, Illinois]], and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], the so-called "cannonball" passenger run. "Cannonball" was a contemporary term applied to fast mail and fast passenger trains of those days, but it was a generic term for speed service. This run offered the fastest schedules in the history of American railroading. Some veteran engineers doubted the times could be met and some quit.&lt;ref name="Jones Home" /&gt;

Engineer Willard W. "Bill" Hatfield had transferred from Memphis back to a run out of Water Valley, thus opening up trains No. 2 (north) and No. 3 (south) to another engineer. Jones had to move his family to Memphis and give up working with his close friend John Wesley McKinnie on No. 638, but he thought the change was worth it. Jones would drive Hatfield's Engine No. 384 until the night of his fateful last ride on Engine No. 382.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Casey Jones Marker 021201.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Marker in Memphis, Tennessee, commemorating Casey Jones]]
There is disagreement over the circumstances prior to Casey Jones's fatal last run. In the account given in the book ''Railroad Avenue'' by Freeman H. Hubbard, which was based on an interview with fireman Sim Webb, he and Casey had been used extra on trains 3 and 2 to cover for engineer Sam Tate, who had marked off ill. They returned to Memphis at 6:25 on the morning of April 29, giving them adequate time to be rested for number 1 that night, which was their regular assigned run.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, Freeman H. (1945). ''Railroad Avenue'', p. 12 McGraw Hill, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fred J. Lee biography ''Casey Jones'' contended the men arrived in Memphis on No. 4 at 9 o'clock on the evening of April 29. They were asked to turn right around and take number 1 back to Canton to fill in for Sam Tate, who had marked off. This would have given them little time to rest, as Number 1 was due out at 11:35 pm. In both of these accounts, Jones's regular run was trains 1 and 4.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Fred J. (1939). ''Casey Jones'', p.260, Kingsport, Tennessee: Southern Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

In a third account, trains 3 and 2 were Casey and Sim Webb's regular run, and they were asked to fill in for Sam Tate that night on No. 1, having arrived that morning on No. 2.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

In any event, they departed Memphis on the fatal run at 12:50&amp;nbsp;a.m., 75 minutes behind schedule owing to the late arrival of No.&amp;nbsp;1. A fast engine, a good fireman (Simeon T. Webb would be the train's assigned fireman), and a light train (they had six cars) were ideal for a record-setting run.  Although it was raining, steam trains of that era operated best in damp conditions.  The weather was quite foggy that night, reducing visibility, and the run was well known for its tricky curves.&lt;ref name="Jones Home" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

In the first section of the run, Jones drove from Memphis {{convert|100|mi|km}} south to [[Grenada, Mississippi]], with an intermediate water stop at [[Sardis, Mississippi]] ({{convert|50|mi|km}} into the run), over a new section of light and shaky rails at speeds up to {{convert|80|mph|km/h}}. At [[Senatobia, Mississippi]] ({{convert|40|mi|km}} into the run), Jones passed through the scene of a prior fatal accident that had occurred the previous November. Jones made his water stop at Sardis and arrived at Grenada for more water, having made up 55 minutes of the 75-minute delay.

Jones made up another 15 minutes in the {{convert|25|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch from Grenada to [[Winona, Mississippi]]. The following {{convert|30|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch (Winona to [[Durant, Mississippi]]) had no speed-restricted curves. By the time he got to Durant ({{convert|155|mi|km}} into the run), Jones was almost on time. He was quite happy, saying at one point, "Sim, the old girl's got her dancing slippers on tonight!" as he leaned on the [[Johnson Bar (locomotive)|Johnson bar]].

At Durant, he received new orders to take to the siding at [[Goodman, Mississippi]] (eight miles (13&amp;nbsp;km) south of Durant, and {{convert|163|mi|km}} into the run), wait for the No. 2 passenger train to pass, and then continue on to Vaughan.  His orders also instructed him to meet passenger train No. 26 at Vaughan ({{convert|15|mi|km}} south of Goodman, and {{convert|178|mi|km}} into the run). He was told that No. 26 was a local passenger train in two sections and would be in the siding, so he would have priority over it.  Jones pulled out of Goodman only five minutes behind schedule. With {{convert|25|mi|km}} of fast track ahead, Jones likely felt that he had a good chance to make it to Canton by 4:05 am "on the advertised".&lt;ref name="Jones Home" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

Unknown to Casey, three separate trains were in the station at Vaughan: double-header freight train No. 83 (located to the north and headed south, which had been delayed due to having two drawbars pulled while at Vaughan) and long freight train No. 72 (located to the south and headed north) were both in the passing track to the east of the main line. As the combined length of the trains was ten cars longer than the length of the east passing track, some of the cars were stopped on the main line.  The two sections of northbound local passenger train No. 26 had arrived from Canton earlier, and required a "saw by" for them to get to the "house track" west of the main line.  The "saw by" maneuver required that No. 83 back up (onto the main line) to allow No. 72 to move northward and pull its overlapping cars off the main line and onto the east side track from the south switch, thus allowing the two sections of No. 26 to gain access to the west house track.  The "saw by", however, left the rear cars of No. 83 overlapping above the north switch and on the main line – right in Jones' path.  As workers prepared a second "saw by" to let Jones pass, an air hose broke on No. 72, locking its brakes and leaving the last four cars of No. 83 on the main line.&lt;ref name="Jones Home" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

[[File:Casey Jones home.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Memorial plaque for Jones, in front of his home at the time of his death]]
Meanwhile, Jones was almost back on schedule, running at about {{convert|75|mph|km/h}} toward Vaughan, and traveling through a {{convert|1.5|mi|km|adj=on}} left-hand curve that blocked his view. Webb's view from the left side of the train was better, and he was first to see the red lights of the caboose on the main line. "Oh my Lord, there's something on the main line!" he yelled to Jones. Jones quickly yelled back "Jump Sim, jump!" to Webb, who crouched down and jumped from the train, about {{convert|300|ft|m}} before impact, and was knocked unconscious by his fall. The last thing Webb heard as he jumped was the long, piercing scream of the whistle as Jones warned anyone still in the freight train looming ahead. He was only two minutes behind schedule.&lt;ref name="Jones Home" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

Jones reversed the throttle and slammed the airbrakes into emergency stop, but "Ole 382" quickly plowed through a wooden caboose, a car load of hay, another of corn, and halfway through a car of timber before leaving the track. He had reduced his speed from about {{convert|75|mph|km/h}} to about {{convert|35|mph|km/h}} when he hit. Because Jones stayed on board to slow the train, he was believed to have saved the passengers from serious injury and death – Jones was the only fatality of the collision. His watch stopped at the time of impact: 3:52 am on April 30, 1900. Popular legend holds that when his body was pulled from the wreckage, his hands still clutched the whistle cord and brake. A stretcher was brought from the baggage car on No. 1, and crewmen of the other trains carried his body to the depot, a {{convert|1/2|mile|m}} away.&lt;ref name="Jones Home" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

The headlines in the Jackson, Tennessee ''Sun'' read: "FATAL WRECK – Engineer Casey Jones, of This City, Killed Near Canton, Miss. – DENSE FOG THE DIRECT CAUSE – Of a Rear End Collision on the Illinois Central. – Fireman and Messenger Injured – Passenger Train Crashed Into a Local Freight Partly on the Siding – Several Cars Demolished."&lt;ref name="Jones Home" /&gt;

A [[Jackson, Mississippi]], newspaper report described the accident:

{{quote|The south-bound passenger train No. 1 was running under a full head of steam when it crashed into the rear end of a caboose and three freight cars which were standing on the main track, the other portion of the train being on a sidetrack. The caboose and two of the cars were smashed to pieces, the engine left the rails and plowed into an embankment, where it overturned and was completely wrecked, the baggage and mail coaches also being thrown from the track and badly damaged. The engineer was killed outright by the concussion. His body was found lying under the cab, with his skull crushed and right arm torn from its socket. The fireman jumped just in time to save his life. The express messenger was thrown against the side of the car, having two of his ribs broken by the blow, but his condition is not considered dangerous.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;}}

==Legend begins==
Jones's legend was quickly fueled by headlines such as, "DEAD UNDER HIS CAB: THE SAD END OF ENGINEER CASEY JONES," ''[[The Commercial Appeal]]'', Memphis, Tennessee; and "HEROIC ENGINEER – Sticks to his post at cost of life. Railroad Wreck at Vaughan's on Illinois Central Railroad – Terrible Fatality Prevented by Engineer's Loyalty to Duty – A passenger's Story," ''[[The Times-Picayune|The Times-Democrat]]'', New Orleans.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

The passenger in the article was Adam Hauser, formerly a member of ''The Times-Democrat'' telegraph staff. He was in a sleeper on Jones's southbound fast mail and said after the wreck:

{{quote|The passengers did not suffer, and there was no panic.

I was jarred a little in my bunk, but when fairly awake the train was stopped and everything was still.

Engineer Jones did a wonderful as well as a heroic piece of work, at the cost of his life.

The marvel and mystery is how Engineer Jones stopped that train. The railroad men themselves wondered at it and of course the uninitiated could not do less. But stop it he did. In a way that showed his complete mastery of his engine, as well as his sublime heroism. I imagine that the Vaughan wreck will be talked about in roundhouses, lunchrooms and cabooses for the next six months, not alone on the Illinois Central, but many other roads in Mississippi and Louisiana.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;}}

[[File:CaseyJonesStamp.png|thumb|220px|Casey Jones depicted on a 3-cent [[postage stamp]] issued by the [[United States Postal Service]]]]

==Funeral==
The next morning Jones's body was transported on the long trip home to Jackson, Tennessee on passenger train No. 26. On the following day, the funeral service was held in St. Mary's Church, where he and Janie Brady had married fourteen years before. He was buried in Mount Calvary Cemetery. Fifteen enginemen rode {{convert|118|mi|km}} from Water Valley to pay their last respects, which was a record.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

==Illinois Central Railroad report on accident==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
A conductor's report filed five hours after the accident stated, "Engineer on No.1 failed to answer flagman who was out proper distance. It is supposed he did not see the flag." This was the position the IC held in its official reports.&lt;ref name="Jones Home" /&gt;

The final IC accident report was released on July 13, 1900, by A.S. Sullivan, the General Superintendent of IC. It stated that "Engineer Jones was solely responsible having disregarded the signals given by Flagman Newberry." John M. Newberry was the flagman on the southbound No. 83 that Jones hit. According to the report, he had gone out a distance of {{convert|3000|ft|m}}, where he had placed warning [[railroad torpedo|torpedoes]] on the rail. He continued north a further distance of 500 to 800 feet (150 to 240 m), where he stood and gave signals to Jones's train No.1. Historians and the press had questions about the official findings.

In the report Fireman Sim Webb states that he heard the torpedo explode, then went to the gangway on the engineer's side and saw the flagman with the red and white lights standing alongside the tracks. Going to the fireman's side, he saw the markers of the caboose of No. 83 and yelled to Jones. But it would have been impossible for him to have seen the flagman if the flagman had been positioned 500–800 feet (150–240 m) before the torpedoes as the report says he was. In any event, some railroad historians &lt;!--who? --&gt;have disputed the official account over the years, finding it difficult if not impossible to believe that an engineer of Jones's experience would have ignored a flagman and fusees (flares) and torpedoes exploded on the rail to alert him to danger.

Contrary to what the report claimed, shortly after the accident and until his death Webb maintained, "We saw no flagman or fusees, we heard no torpedoes. Without any warning we plowed into that caboose."&lt;ref name="Jones Home" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

==Injuries and losses from wreck==
The personal injury and physical damage costs of the wreck were initially estimated as follows:

* Simeon T. Webb, Fireman Train No. 1, body bruises from jumping off Engine 382 &amp;ndash; $5.00 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1900}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}})
* Mrs. W. E. Breaux, passenger, 1472 Rocheblave Street, New Orleans, slight bruises – Not settled
* Mrs. Wm. Deto, passenger, No 25 East 33rd Street, Chicago, slight bruises left knee and left hand – Not settled
* Wm. Miller, Express Messenger, injuries to back and left side, apparently slight &amp;ndash; $25.00 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25|1900}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}})
* W. L. Whiteside, Postal Clerk, jarred &amp;ndash; $1.00 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1|1900}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}})
* R. A. Ford, Postal Clerk, jarred &amp;ndash; $1.00 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1|1900}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}})
* Engine No. 382: Cannonball; $1,396.25 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1396.25|1900}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}})
* Mail car No. 51 &amp;ndash; $610.00 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|610|1900}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}})
* Baggage car No. 217 &amp;ndash; $105.00 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|105|1900}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}})
* Caboose No. 98119 &amp;ndash; $430.00 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|430|1900}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}})
* IC box car 11380 &amp;ndash; $4000.00 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4000|1900}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}})
* IC box car 24116 &amp;ndash; $55.00 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|55|1900}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}})
* Total (property damage only) &amp;ndash; $2,996.00 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2996|1900}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}})&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

An update indicated an additional $327.50 in property damage ($102.50 in track damage, $100.00 for freight, and $125.00 in wrecking expense) plus a settlement of $1.00 to Mrs. Breaux for her injuries. Mrs. Deto was identified as the spouse of an IC engineer, and in the update her claim for injuries was still unsettled.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt; There are no clearly authentic photographs of the famous wreck in existence.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

There has been some controversy about exactly how Jones died.  Massena Jones, (former postmaster of Vaughan and director of the now-closed museum there), said "When they found Jones, according to Uncle Will Madison (a section hand who helped remove Jones's body from the wreckage), he had a splinter of wood driven through his head. Now this is contrary to most of the stories, some of which say he had a bolt through his neck, some say he was crushed, some say he was scalded to death."&lt;ref name="Jones Home" /&gt;

==Later history of engines==
For at least ten years after the wreck, the imprint of Jones's engine was clearly visible in the embankment on the east side of the tracks about two-tenths of a mile north of [[Tucker's Creek]], which is where the marker was located. The imprint of the headlight, boiler and the spokes of the wheels could be seen and people would ride up on handcars to view the traces of the famous wreck. Corn that was scattered by the wreck grew for years afterward in the surrounding fields.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Massena F. (1978) ''The Choo-Choo Stopped at Vaughan''. Quail Ridge Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wrecked 382 was brought to the Water Valley shop and rebuilt "just as it had come from the [[Rogers Locomotive Works]] in 1898," according to Bruce Gurner. It was soon back in service on the same run with Engineer Harry A. "Dad" Norton in charge—but bad luck seemed to follow it. During its 37 years of service, "Ole 382" was involved in accidents that took 6 lives before it was retired in July 1935. During its career, the 382 was renumbered 212, 2012, and 5012.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

January 1903: criminal train wreckers caused 382 to wreck, nearly demolishing the locomotive. Norton's legs were broken and he was badly scalded. His fireman died 3 days later.

September 1905: Norton and the 382 turned over in the Memphis South Yards. This time, however, the train was moving slowly and Norton was uninjured.

January 22, 1912: 382 (now numbered 2012) was involved in a wreck that killed four prominent railroad men and injured several others. It is called the Kinmundy Wreck&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kinmundyhistoricalsociety.org/album/wreck.htm|title=Train Wreck|website=Kinmundy Historical Society|access-date=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it happened near [[Kinmundy, Illinois]]. An engineer by the name of Strude was driving.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

Jones's beloved Engine No. 638 was sold to the Mexican government in 1921 and still ran there in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt;

==Other people involved==
Jones's African-American fireman, Simeon T. Webb (born May 12, 1874), died in Memphis on July 13, 1957,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://condrenrails.com/MRP/Other-Passenger-Stations/Poplar_Avenue_Station.htm|title=Poplar Ave. Station|website=condrenrails.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924001848/http://condrenrails.com/MRP/Other-Passenger-Stations/Poplar_Avenue_Station.htm|archive-date=September 24, 2013|access-date=October 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; at age 83.

Jones's wife, Janie Brady Jones (born October 29, 1866), died on November 21, 1958 in Jackson at age 92.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1314&amp;dat=19581121&amp;id=-jFWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Z-cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6221,2122564 |title=Death Comes at 92 to Casey Jones's Widow |newspaper=The Spokesman-Review |agency=Associated Press |page=14 |date=November 22, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of Jones' death at age 37, his son Charles was 12, his daughter Helen was 10 and his youngest son John Lloyd (known as "Casey Junior") was 4.

Jones's wife received $3,000 in insurance payments (Jones was "doubleheading" as a member of two unions, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, and had a $1,500 policy with each union) and later settled with IC for an additional $2,650 ([[Earl Brewer]], a Water Valley attorney who would later serve as Governor of Mississippi, represented her in the settlement).&lt;ref name="Water Valley" /&gt; Other than these payments Mrs. Jones received nothing as a result of the wreck or Jones's service with the railroad, as the [[Railroad Retirement Board|Railroad Retirement Fund]] was not established until 1937.

Jones's wife said she never had any thought of remarrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Widow of Casey Jones Is Dead at 92: "Haunted" by Ballad of Famed Engineer |page=21 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=November 22, 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wore black nearly every day for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name="Jones Home" /&gt;

Jones's tombstone in Jackson's Mount Calvary Cemetery gives his birth year as 1864, but according to information his mother wrote in the family Bible, he was born in 1863. The tombstone was donated in 1947 by two out-of-town railroad enthusiasts who accidentally got his birth year wrong. Until then, a simple wooden cross had marked his grave.&lt;ref name="Jones Home" /&gt;

==Casey Jones references in music==
Casey Jones's fame can almost certainly be attributed to the traditional song, ''[[The Ballad of Casey Jones]]'', also known as "Casey Jones, the Brave Engineer", recorded by, among others, [[Billy Murray (singer)|Billy Murray]], [[Mississippi John Hurt]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Furry Lewis]], [[Johnny Cash]], and played live by the [[Grateful Dead]].

Songs titled ''Casey Jones'', usually about the crash or the driver, have been recorded by [[Vernon Dalhart]] (Edison Disc recorded June 16, 1925), [[This Bike Is a Pipe Bomb]], Feverfew ([[Blueboy (band)]]), [[Tom Russell]], [[Leonid Utyosov]], [[The New Christy Minstrels]], [[Skillet Lickers]], and the [[Grateful Dead]].

A pro-union protest song spoof of ''The Ballad of Casey Jones'', written and sung by IWW union activist Joe Hill, titled ''Casey Jones the Union Scab'' portrays a negative version of Jones.
Casey Jones is depicted as a selfish person, refusing to join the strike movement of the South Pacific Railway Company.  As his engine is badly in disrepair he crashes from a bridge, dies and goes to Heaven, where St Peter wants him to break a strike of celestial musicians. But the scheme doesn't quite work: The rebellious musicians form a local union and threw Casey all the way down the "Golden stairs" into Hell, where Satan urges him to shovel sulphur in the furnaces. The ironic last line runs: "That's what you get for scabbing for the SP Line." Hill's version of the song was later performed and recorded by [[Utah Phillips]].

'''''Clone''''' is a 2008 [[BBC Three]] comedy series starring [[Jonathan Pryce]] and [[Mark Gatiss]], centred on the creation and education of the world's first [[Human cloning|human clone]]. Its first series of six 30-minute episodes premiered on 17 November 2008.

==Story==
Intended to be a prototype super soldier who will eventually replace Britain's volunteer Army, his creator, the brilliant scientist Dr Victor Blenkinsop discovers, to both his horror and distaste, that his new super weapon is not quite the awe-inspiring creation he expected. In fact, the clone is more likely to hug someone than shoot them.
This modern-day Dr Frankenstein and his monster go on the run hoping to find the neurological trigger that will fix the clone and unlock his superhuman abilities. Unfortunately, they must also avoid Colonel Black and his crack team of security agents, whose mission is to find them and kill them.

}}

==Regular cast==
*[[Mark Gatiss]] - '''Colonel Black:''' The head of [[MI7]]:  Britain's most Secret of Services. The Colonel is a blood thirsty nemesis who will stop at nothing to kill Victor and the clone. He is a man with limitless power and no conscience. He kills people simply because they can't find Blenkinsop or the clone. He shows no remorse after a false lead results in the death of two innocent people, a later mistake resulting in the death of an operative who had just provided him with vital information regarding the clone's whereabouts.
*[[Fiona Glascott]] - '''Rose Bourne:''' The [[Irish people|Irish]] owner and bartender of ''The Peanut'', a small pub in the even smaller village of Bletherford. Rose is a beautiful but shy young redhead of 26 who has several extraordinary abilities: a photographic memory and [[savant syndrome|savant]] level [[Mathematics|maths]] skills. She likens Victor's selfish [[Psychopathy|sociopath]]ical behaviour to her father. Upon meeting her, Victor realizes she could be the key to unlocking the clone's dormant abilities, resolving to acquire a little piece of her brain.
*[[Oliver Maltman]] - '''Ian, Victor's assistant:''' Victor's loyal lab assistant. A modern Igor, Ian is in awe of his boss and is willing to do anything it takes to help him, including being a human guinea pig or being beaten by the Secret Intelligence Services. Like Victor, Ian lacks a social life, although it's due to his shyness rather than his arrogance; he was apparently to be married, but his fiancé left him at the altar.
*[[Stuart McLoughlin]] - '''Clone, AKA Albert:''' The first human clone and appears to be in his mid-twenties. Intended as a prototype super weapon, the clone emerges from his birthing tube more likely to hug someone than shoot them.  The clone is an innocent to whom everything is new, from chocolate, to laughing and dancing.  He is fascinated by everything, but is naive of basic social interaction; while he has memory engrams to allow him to function as a soldier, he can't seem to access them, although Ian speculates that they may activate eventually.
*[[Jonathan Pryce]] - '''Dr. Victor Blenkinsop:''' A modern Dr. Frankenstein and the creator of the first human clone. A man who has mortgaged his entire life in the pursuit of a single goal: to take his place amongst the great names of science. Divorced three times, Victor is willing to sacrifice everything to achieve the glory he hungers for, something he can only do by fixing the clone and making him the super soldier he was designed to be.

'''Cora Alice Du Bois''' (October 26, 1903 – April 7, 1991&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Du Bois, Cora Alice, 1903-1991. Cora Alice Du Bois papers, 1869-1988: Guide.|url = http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~toz00001|website = Tozzer Library, Harvard College Library: OASIS|access-date = 2016-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an American cultural [[anthropologist]] and a key figure in culture and personality studies and in psychological anthropology more generally.

==Early life and education==
Du Bois was born in New York City on October 26, 1903 to Mattie Schreiber Du Bois and Jean Du Bois, immigrants to the U.S. from [[Switzerland]]. She spent most of her childhood in [[New Jersey]], where she graduated from high school in [[Perth Amboy]]. She spent a year studying library science at the New York Public Library and then attended [[Barnard College]], graduating with a B.A. in history in 1927. She earned an M.A. in history from [[Columbia University]] in 1928.

Encouraged by an anthropology course taught by [[Ruth Benedict]] and [[Franz Boas]] at Columbia, DuBois moved to California to study anthropology with Native American specialists [[Alfred L. Kroeber]] and [[Robert Lowie]]. She received her Ph.D. in anthropology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1932.

==Early work==
In part due to prejudices against women academics, she was initially unable to find a university position. She remained at Berkeley as a teaching fellow and research assistant from 1932 to 1935. She conducted salvage ethnography on several Native American groups of northern California and the Pacific Northwest, including the [[Wintu]] Indians of northern California. She published ''The 1870 Ghost Dance'' in 1939, a study of a [[Ghost Dance|religious movement among Native Americans in the Western U.S.]]

In 1935, Du Bois received a [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] Fellowship to undertake clinical training and explore possible collaborations between anthropology and psychiatry. She spent six months at the [[Boston Psychopathic Hospital]], now the [[Massachusetts Mental Health Center]], and six months at the [[New York Psychoanalytic Society]]. In New York she worked with psychiatrist [[Abram Kardiner]], who became her mentor and collaborator for several projects in cross-cultural diagnosis and the psychoanalytic study of culture. Du Bois also taught at [[Hunter College]] in 1936-1937 while developing a fieldwork project to test their new ideas.

==Work in Indonesia and OSS==
From 1937 to 1939, DuBois lived and conducted research on the island of [[Alor Island|Alor]], part of the Netherlands East Indies, now [[Indonesia]]. She collected detailed case studies, life-history interviews, and administered various personality tests (including [[Rorschach test]]s), which she interpreted in collaboration with Kardiner and published as ''The People of Alor: A Social-Psychological Study of an East Indian Island'' in 1944. One of her major theoretical advances in this work was the concept of "modal personality structure". With this notion she modified earlier ideas in the Culture and Personality school of anthropology on "basic personality structure" by demonstrating that, while there is always individual variation within a culture, each culture favors the development of a particular type or types, which will be the most common within that culture.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Toren, "Culture and Personality" in ''Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology'' (London: Routledge, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Her work strongly influenced other psychiatric anthropologists, including [[Robert I. Levy (anthropologist)|Robert I. Levy]], with his [[person-centered ethnography]], and [[Melford Spiro]].

Like many other American social scientists during World War II, DuBois served as a member of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] working in the Research and Analysis Branch as Chief of the Indonesia section. In 1944 she moved to Ceylon (now [[Sri Lanka]]) to serve as chief of research and analysis for the Army's Southeast Asia Command.&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/11/obituaries/cora-dubois-harvard-professor-of-anthropology-is-dead-at-87.html Cora DuBois, Harvard Professor of Anthropology, Is Dead at 87," April 11, 1991], accessed April 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; There she began a lesbian relationship with [[Jeanne Taylor]], another OSS employee. They lived together as a couple and in the mid-1950s they visited [[Paul Cushing Child|Paul]] and [[Julia Child]] in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Jennet Conant, ''A Covert Affair: Julia Child and Paul Child in the OSS'' (NY: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2011), 241. DuBois' ''New York Times'' obituary called Taylor "her longtime companion."&lt;/ref&gt; DuBois and Taylor, "her companion," according to her Harvard Library biographer, "enjoyed an active social life" in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=tozzer /&gt;

==Later work and Harvard career==
She left the OSS after World War II and from 1945 to 1949 was Southeast Asia Branch Chief in the State Department's Office of Intelligence Research.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt; In 1950, she declined an appointment to succeed Kroeber as head of the anthropology department at Berkeley rather than sign the California Loyalty Oath required of all faculty members.&lt;ref name=tozzer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the history of the California Loyalty Oath at Berkeley, see [http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives_exhibits/loyaltyoath/timelinesummary.html "Summary of Loyalty Oath events"], accessed April 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; DuBois worked for the [[World Health Organization]] in 1950-51.  In 1954, she accepted an appointment at [[Harvard University]] as the second person to hold the Zimurray Chair at [[Radcliffe College]]. She was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1955.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter D|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterD.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first woman tenured in Harvard's Anthropology Department and the second woman tenured in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard. She conducted research between 1961 and 1967 in the temple city of [[Bhubaneswar]] in the Indian state of [[Orissa, India|Orissa]], where a number of graduate students in Anthropology and [[Harvard Department of Social Relations|Social Relations]] conducted fieldwork.

DuBois was president of the American Anthropological Association in 1968-69 and of the [[Association for Asian Studies]] in 1969-70, the first woman to be allowed that honor.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt;

In 1970 she retired from Harvard but continued teaching as Professor-at-large at [[Cornell University]] (1971–1976) and for one term at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (1976).&lt;ref name=tozzer&gt;[http://oasis.harvard.edu:10080/oasis/deliver/~toz00001 Cora Alice Du Bois papers: Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902184700/http://oasis.harvard.edu:10080/oasis/deliver/~toz00001 |date=2006-09-02 }}, accessed April 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; She died in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], on April 7, 1991.&lt;ref name=nytobit /&gt; Most of her research materials and personal papers are held in Tozzer Library at Harvard University.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some are in the Regenstein Library at the [[University of Chicago]].

'''Cup-and-ball''' (or '''ball in a cup''') or '''ring and pin''' is a traditional children's toy. It is generally a wooden handle, to which a small ball is attached by a string, and which has one or two cups, or a spike, upon which the player tries to catch the ball. It is popular in Spanish-speaking countries, where it is called by a wide number of names (including '''boliche''' in Spain and '''balero''' in most of Hispanic America), and was historically popular in France as the '''bilboquet'''. A similar toy with three cups and a spike called ''[[kendama]]'' is very popular in Japan and has spread globally in popularity.

==History==

The game was created in the 14th century and has been improved in different ways since then.
===Americas===

[[File:TianguisDomingoRamos2015 067.JPG|thumbnail|Baleros at a [[tianguis]] in [[Uruapan]], [[Michoacan]], Mexico]]
[[File:Balero Demonstration showing a common method of landing the cup on the stick.webm|thumb|Balero demonstration in Mexico showing a common technique of landing the cup on the stick.]]

In North America it was both a child's toy and a gambling mechanism for adults, and involved catching a ring rather than a ball. In some Native American tribes it was even a courtship device, where suitors would challenge the objects of their interest to a polite game of ring and pin.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The [[Mohave people|Mohave]] variant of the game included up to 17 extra rings attached to the cord, and game scoring involved differing point values assigned to different rings.&lt;ref name=Leibs /&gt; Other variants include those played by the [[Inuit]] of what is now [[Labrador]], with a rabbit's skull in place of the ball, with extra holes bored into it, which had to be caught on the handle like a skewer; and those that used balls of grass or animal hair.&lt;ref name=Leibs /&gt; Ring and pin games in general were known as ''ajagak, ayagak, ajaquktuk'' in [[Inuit languages|Inuit dialects]].&lt;ref name="Blanchard1995"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kendall Blanchard|title=The Anthropology of Sport: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aGeLoS1pWA4C&amp;pg=PA148|date=1 January 1995|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-89789-330-5|pages=148–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
[[File:Bole Jeanne L Enfant Au Bilboquet.jpg|thumb|Jeanne Bôle's ''L'Enfant au Bilboquet'' (around 1880)]]

The cup-and-ball is noted in France as early as the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=Leibs&gt;{{cite book|title=Sports and Games of the Renaissance|author=Andrew Leibs|pages=84,147–148|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2004|isbn=0-313-32772-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was played by King [[Henry III of France]] as historical records note, though his playing was considered evidence of his mental instability.&lt;ref name="Freer1888"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martha Walker Freer|title=Henry III, King of France and Poland: His Court and Times. From Numerous Unpublished Sources, Including Ms. Documents in the Bibliotheque Impériale, and the Archives of France and Italy, Etc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHjTAAAAMAAJ|year=1888|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company|page=10}} - ''"it is lamentable to read of the pitiful imbecility which could induce the king, the day following his indignant protest, to sally forth from the Louvre at the head of a disorderly troop, and to parade the streets of the capital playing with a cup-and-ball.''&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, the game went out of fashion, and for a century the game was only remembered by a small number of enthusiasts{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} such as the Marquis de Biévre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Strand Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67UvAAAAMAAJ|year=1907|publisher=G. Newnes|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game had its golden age during the reign of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] — among the upper classes people owned baleros made of ivory. Actors also sometimes appeared with them in scenes. The game was very popular in the 18th and 19th centuries. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] mentions the game early in his ''[[Confessions (Jean-Jacques Rousseau)|Confessions]]'' when stating his reservations about idle talk and hands, saying "If ever I went back into society I should carry a cup-and-ball in my pocket, and play with it all day long to excuse myself from speaking when I had nothing to say."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rousseau|first1=Jean-Jacques|title=The Confessions of J. J. Rousseau|publisher=Privately Printed for the Members of the Aldus Society  London, 1903|location=Project Gutenberg|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3913/3913.txt|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iberian world===

The game is very popular in the Spanish and Portuguese diaspora, often known as '''boliche'''. The name varies across many countries — in [[El Salvador]] and [[Guatemala]] it is called '''capirucho'''; in [[Argentina]], [[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], and [[Mexico]] it is called '''balero'''; in [[Spain]] it is '''boliche'''; in [[Portugal]] and [[Brazil]] it is called '''bilboquê'''; in [[Chile]] it is '''emboque'''; in [[Colombia]] it is called '''coca'''; and in [[Venezuela]] the game is called '''perinola'''.&lt;ref name="CIVILA"&gt;{{cite web|author=Civila|title=El balero|publisher=Open Publishing|language=Spanish|url=http://www.educar.org/infantiles/Juegos/tradicionales/balero.asp|accessdate=3 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914195227/http://www.educar.org/infantiles/Juegos/tradicionales/balero.asp|archivedate=14 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, American lexicographer Charles Keilus (1919-1997) documented the term ''zingo paya'' for a cup-and-ball game in Tijuana, Mexico, and formed the Zingo Paya Society in Los Angeles to promote the toy and its collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zingopaya.com/|title=The Zingo Paya Society|author=|date=|work=zingopaya.com|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{importance inline|date=February 2016}}

===England===

This game was also popular in England during the early 19th century, as [[Jane Austen]] is reputed to have excelled while entertaining her brother's son in a game called ''Bilbo Catcher''.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

There is one picture at the National Portrait Gallery of a young girl playing the game. It appears to be a copy of a painting from Philip Mercier although the original painting has not been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw40080/Charlotte-Mercier-Miss-playing-with-Cup-and-Ball|title=NPG D5676; Charlotte Mercier ('Miss playing with Cup and Ball') - Portrait - National Portrait Gallery|author=|date=|work=npg.org.uk|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other 18th century toys, which are found repeatedly in artwork, cup and ball games are rare with only two known pictures, one copied from the other.

===Japan===

The game of [[kendama]] is believed to have arrived in Japan in the 18th century,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and the game underwent significant modernization and standardization in the early 20th century, becoming internationally popular in the 21st century.

===Germany===

In 2011, a German company, TicToys, began to create a toy with the name Ticayo. Yomega, an American company which is famous for their [[Yo-yo|Yo-yos]] and [[Kendama|Kendamas]], began to sell Ticayos, in which they popularized the said toy.

==Gameplay==

The main goal of the game is to get the ball into the cup. While the concept is very easy, mastering the game can sometimes be challenging.

There are several styles of gameplay in the Latin world such as ''la simple'', ''la doble'', ''la vertical'', ''la mariquita''.

'''Darra-e Kūr''' or '''Bābā Darwīsh''', is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] site in [[Badakhshan province]] in [[Afghanistan]]. It is situated just northeast of Kalafgān near the village of Chinār-i Gunjus Khān {{convert|63|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} east of [[Taloqan]], on the road to [[Faizabad]]. The cave is situated atop the side of the valley near the hamlet of ''Bābā Darwīsh''.

==Description==
Darra-e Kūr is a rock shelter, well-stratified in [[silt]] deposits, laid down by a stream. Approximately 800 stone implements were recovered, of two basic types: [[flint]] and sickle blades, and large diabase points. Other finds included celts, scrapers, pounders, blades, simple jewelry, [[fauna]], such as fish, rodents, wild horse, domesticated sheep and goat and [[onager]], a fragment of a human right [[temporal bone]], many bone [[fossil]]s and three fragments of [[tin]] and [[bronze]]. Unearthed pottery was mostly crude, black wares, sometimes decorated. The only architectural traces found were 80 post-holes, suggestive of tents. Three articulated goat burials were discovered.{{sfn|Hawks|2010}}

Collection:
* [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]] and [[Kabul Museum]] - excavated material.

Field-work:
* 1966 [[Louis Dupree (professor)|Louis Dupree]], AMNH - excavations.

==Dating==
The [[Mousterian]] artefacts come from a layer that was dated to around 30,000 [[Before Present|BP]]. One of the younger layers above, referred to by the site archaeologists as coming from a "Goat Cult" [[Neolithic]] layer, was dated to around 3780 BP.{{sfn|Douka|Slon|Stringer|Potts|2017}}

Direct [[Radiocarbon dating#Accelerator mass spectrometry|AMS dating]] of the temporal bone (NMNH 387961) reveals that the bone is a lot younger than previously thought, giving an age range of around 4530-4410 BP. Previously thought to have been from the [[Paleolithic]], due to the presence of the bone among the layer containing Mousterian [[Levallois technique|Levallois]] artefacts, direct dating has revealed that the bone is actually from the Neolithic. Researchers now believe that the temporal bone came from a later burial that intruded into the Mousterian layer, likely coming from the culture associated with the "Goat Cult" Neolithic layer.{{sfn|Douka|Slon|Stringer|Potts|2017}}

==Archaeogenetics==
In 2017, researchers successfully extracted the DNA from both the [[petrous part of the temporal bone|petrous]] and [[squamous part of temporal bone|squamous part]] of the Darra-e Kur temporal bone. The Darra-e Kur specimen is the first ancient human remain from Afghanistan from which DNA has been successfully sequenced. The individual was found to belong to [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|Haplogroup H2a]].{{sfn|Douka|Slon|Stringer|Potts|2017}}

'''Disciplinary probation''' is a disciplinary status that can apply to [[student]]s at a higher educational institution&lt;ref name=Knowles1977 /&gt; or to [[employee]]s in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Pell2003 /&gt; For employees, it can result from both poor performance at work or from misconduct.&lt;ref name=Pell2003 /&gt; For students, it results from misconduct alone, with poor academic performance instead resulting in [[scholastic probation]].&lt;ref name=Knowles1977 /&gt;

For a student, disciplinary probation means that the student is on formal notice, and subject to special rules and regulations.&lt;ref name=Knowles1977 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BradySnoxell1965 /&gt; The violation of these rules may lead to more severe forms of discipline, such as suspension, dismissal, and expulsion.&lt;ref name=BradySnoxell1965 /&gt;

For employees, disciplinary probation is one common step in a scheme of [[progressive discipline]]. It is a common replacement, in non-unionized workplaces, for the progressive disciplinary step of suspension without pay. A usual period for such probation is 90 days.&lt;ref name=Grote2006 /&gt;
Some companies may place permanent employees on probationary status, particularly if their performance is below a set standard or for disciplinary reasons. In this instance, the employee is usually given a period of time to either improve their performance or modify their behaviour before more severe measures are taken.

'''Draga Garašanin''' ({{lang-sr|Драга Гарашанин}} 1921–1997) was a Serbian archaeologist who studied the [[Eneolithic|Copper]] and [[Bronze Age]] of eastern Europe. She became one of the leading prehistorians of [[Yugoslavia]], later Serbia, after [[World War II]] and with her husband produced the first map of archaeological sites in Serbia.

==Early life==
Draga Arandelović was born on 6 April, 1921 in Paris and obtained her education in [[Belgrade]], which was interrupted by World War II. In 1946 she completed her studies on philology and classic archaeology.{{sfn|Projekta Rastko|2009}} She married {{Interlanguage link multi|Milutin Garašanin|sr|3=Милутин Гарашанин (археолог)}}, also an archaeologist and academic{{sfn|Novaković|2011|p=391}} and the couple subsequently had three daughters, Julija, Sofija and Olivera.{{sfn|Lopušina|2012}} Though they studied with [[Miloje Vasić]], the Garašanins did not agree with his theories and decided to further their studies with {{Interlanguage link multi|Josip Korošec|sl}} at the [[University of Ljubljana]] where they entered in 1950.{{sfn|Novaković|2011|p=391}} Arandelović-Garašanin graduated with her doctorate in 1953, presenting her thesis ''Starčevačka kultura''. The work examined the [[Starčevo culture]] and became an important text for the study of this prehistoric ethnic group.{{sfn|Projekta Rastko|2009}} 

==Career==
Arandelović-Garašanin worked as a volunteer of the [[National Museum of Serbia|Museum of Prince Paul]], which would become the National Museum, beginning in 1942, classifying material from several pre-war excavations. She then briefly worked at the [[Museum of the City of Belgrade]] as the [[curator]] before returning to oversee the National Museum in 1950.{{sfn|Projekta Rastko|2009}}{{sfn|Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža|2016}} In 1951, she and her husband published a gazetteer mapping the archaeological sites in Serbia, ''Arheološka nalazišta u Srbiji'', which was the first effort of its kind in the country.{{sfn|Novaković|2011|p=391}} Her publication ''Katalog metala'' (1954) became a staple,{{sfn|Projekta Rastko|2009}}{{sfn|Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža|2016}} which catalogued metals used in [[Iron Age]] jewelry in the region.{{sfn|Projekta Rastko|2009}}

Arandelović-Garašanin led excavations on numerous important prehistoric sites in Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro, which included Anzabegovo, Bela Crkva, Kriva Reka, Radanja near [[Štip]], [[Supska]] and [[Žarkovo]].{{sfn|Народни музеј у Београду|2015}} She spent two decades studying Dacian [[necropolis|necropoli]] south of the Danube.{{sfn|Dumitraşcu|2007|p=60}} In addition to her fieldwork, Arandelović-Garašanin arranged the collections and identification of the finds at the National Museum, as well as organizing exhibitions featuring the [[Neolithic]] [[history]] of the [[Central Balkans]], including the [[Dacians|Dacian]] and [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] people from the area. Her exhibits on the [[Bronze Age]] in Serbia toured from the National Museum to Denmark, England and Romania.{{sfn|Народни музеј у Београду|2015}} From 1950 through the 1960s, Arandelović-Garašanin and her husband examined new theories on the chronological prehistory of Serbia, based on the methodology of [[Gero von Merhart]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Vladimir Milojčić|de}}, of the German school of thought,{{sfn|Novaković|2011|p=391}}{{sfn|Muhly|2004}} The couple became the leading prehistorians after World War II in Serbia{{sfn|Novaković|2011|p=391}} with their collaborations on the Starčevo culture and [[Vinča culture]]s becoming foundational works.{{sfn|Novaković|2011|p=396}}

Arandelović-Garašanin retired from the museum in 1979.{{sfn|Projekta Rastko|2009}} She died on 12 October 1997 in Belgrade, [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]].{{sfn|Leksikografski zavod Miroslav Krleža|2016}}

'''Equity of condition''' in tax law and governmental spending is the economic condition, often arbitrary, that political leaders believe a person should be in after governmental [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[redistribution of wealth]]. The award or redistribution of wealth to the recipients overrides, substantially, any [[natural right]] of the producers of the wealth to keep the fruits of their labor.

The award of wealth in a socialist economy may be extensive, with a proscribed level of benefits for food, housing, health, education, recreation, welfare, etcetera—and have little or no relation to the citizen’s productivity (e.g., before-tax income). The result, however, is that economic productivity and the [[standard of living]] can be lessened in a socialist economy due to disincentive to production.

Equity of condition in a [[mixed economy]], such as the United States, can be nebulous and ever-changing. Governmental subsidies and tax deductions may be extended for political reasons, and a political leader may never provide comprehensive economic rationale for his particular fiscal policy actions. The cost of the benefits is merely shifted to a discriminated portion of the tax base. Benefits may also be illusory to recipients, because further political manipulation of the tax code by political leaders can nullify the recipients’ original gains.

The '''Four Freedoms Award''' is an annual award presented to those men and women whose achievements have demonstrated a commitment to those principles which [[United States|US]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] proclaimed in his [[Four Freedoms|historic speech]] to [[United States Congress]] on January 6, 1941, as essential to democracy: freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear. The annual award is handed out in alternate years in [[New York City]] by the [[Roosevelt Institute]] to [[Americans]] and in [[Middelburg]], [[Netherlands]], by the [[Roosevelt Stichting]] to non-Americans.

|filename=FDR's 1941 State of the Union (Four Freedoms speech) Edit 1.ogg
|description =[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s January 6, 1941 [[State of the Union Address]] introducing the theme of the [[Four Freedoms]] (starting at 32:02)
|image=[[File:FDR in 1933.jpg|alt=Franklin Delano Roosevelt headshot|100px|thumb|[[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]]]
}}
The awards were first presented in 1982 on the centennial of President Roosevelt's birth as well as the bicentennial of diplomatic relations between the United States and the [[Netherlands]]. The awards were founded to celebrate the Four Freedoms espoused by President Roosevelt in his speech:
#[[Freedom of speech]]
#[[Freedom of worship]]
#[[Freedom from want]]
#[[Freedom from fear]]

For each of the four freedoms an award was instituted, as well as a special Freedom medal. In 1990, 1995, 2003 and 2004 there were also special awards.

In odd years the awards are presented to American citizens or institutions by the Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in New York City, though in the past the American awards were given in Hyde Park, New York. In even years the award ceremony is held in Middelburg and honours non-Americans. The choice of Middelburg was motivated by the suspected descendance of the family Roosevelt from [[Oud-Vossemeer]] in the municipality [[Tholen (municipality)|Tholen]].

[[File:GreyNet logo.jpg|right]]
'''GreyNet International''', the '''Grey Literature Network Service''' is an independent organization founded in 1992, which is dedicated to research, publication, [[open access]], education, and public awareness to [[grey literature]]. Grey literature is often defined as "information produced and distributed on all levels of government, academics, business and industry in electronic and print formats not controlled by commercial publishing i.e. where publishing is not the primary activity of the producing body.".&lt;ref&gt;Luxembourg, 1997 – Expanded in New York, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

GreyNet is corporate author of the [[Proceedings]] issuing from the International Conference Series on Grey Literature, The Grey Journal, An International [[Academic journal|Journal]] on Grey Literature, as well as other types of publications such as reports, program books, and newsletters. GreyNet also maintains a [[Listserv]] and a presence on a number of social media including [[LinkedIn]], [[Netvibes]], [[Twitter]], and [[Facebook]].

GreyNet is a not for profit organisation fostering the production and dissemination of [[scientific literature]]. It is also engaged in the [[open source]] movement and was invited to the 10th Libre Software Meeting 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2009.rmll.info/?lang=en |title=Home – 10th LSM from 7 to 11 July 2009 in Nantes |publisher=2009.rmll.info |date= |accessdate=2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Nantes, France, with a communication on [[knowledge sharing]] in the field of [[grey literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2009.rmll.info/Greynet,791.html |title=Greynet – 10es RMLL à Nantes du 7 au 11 juillet 2009 |publisher=2009.rmll.info |date= |accessdate=2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 11th International Conference on Grey Literature December 2009, GreyNet signed a Partnership Agreement with ICSTI, International Council for Scientific and Technical Information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.icsti.org/ |title=Icsti.Org |publisher=Icsti.Org |date= |accessdate=2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This newly established partnership lends to GreyNet a multilateral base, elevating it from a bilateral one that it already shares with a number of ICSTI Members. GreyNet seeks to provide ICSTI with an opportunity to further broaden its information activities to the social sciences and humanities.

== GreyNet and the OpenGrey Repository ==
For the past 20 years, GreyNet has sought to serve researchers and authors in the field of grey literature. To further this end, GreyNet has signed on to the OpenGrey repository and in so doing seeks to preserve and make openly available research results originating in the International Conference Series on Grey Literature. GreyNet together with [[INIST]]-[[CNRS]] have designed the format for a metadata record, which encompasses standardized PDF attachments of the full-text conference preprints, PowerPoint presentations, abstracts, biographical notes, and post-publication commentaries. GreyNet's collection of over 270 conference preprints is both current and comprehensive.
Comment from Peter Suber, ''Open Access News'' (Thursday, January 29, 2009): ''GreyNet started making its conference proceedings OA through its repository in May 2008. I applaud its determination to complete the collection retroactively, even if it means buying permission from a publisher. Note to other conference organizers: This is a reason to self-archive your proceedings as you go, or at least to retain the right to self-archive them without a fee.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Suber |first=Peter |url=http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/01/greynet-buys-rights-to-deposit-papers.html |title=Peter Suber, Open Access News |publisher=Earlham.edu |date=2009-01-29 |accessdate=2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GreyNet and the DANS Data Archive ==
GreyNet’s research data is cross-linked to the corresponding conference preprint in OpenGrey via the DANS Data Archive. In this way these results can further serve the international grey literature community, where open access to research data has now become a prerequisite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://easy.dans.knaw.nl/ui/?wicket:bookmarkablePage=:nl.knaw.dans.easy.web.search.pages.PublicSearchResultPage&amp;q=greynet |title=Published datasets – EASY |publisher=Easy.dans.knaw.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Web-based Resources in Grey Literature: GreySource, GreyText, IDGL, WHOIS ==

'''GreySource''' provides examples of grey and malin-grey literature to the average net-user (see for instance the University of Queensland list &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.uq.edu.au/training/types_information_sources.html#grey |title=Types of Information Sources &amp;#124; UQ Library |publisher=Library.uq.edu.au |date=2015-03-10 |accessdate=2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and in so doing profiles organizations responsible for its production and/or processing. Only web-based resources that explicitly refer to the term grey literature (or its equivalent in any language) are listed. GreySource identifies the hyperlink directly embedded in a resource, thus allowing immediate and virtual exposure to grey literature.

The web-based resources appear within categories derived from the COSATI (American) and [[SIGLE]] (European) Classification Systems. The few changes that have been introduced into the classification scheme are intended to facilitate the search and retrieval of net-users. New examples are welcome and will be indexed in GreySource.

'''GreyText''' is an inhouse archive of documents on grey literature. Over 125 documents are indexed by first author followed by the title, source, date of publication and length in printed pages. Free Access to the first page of each document is available for browsing. Also, in most cases the corresponding PowerPoint is online available. The full-text of all documents listed in GreyText are accessible in PDF via email on demand.

'''IDGL''', International Directory of Organizations in Grey Literature provides a list of some 170 organizations in more than 30 countries worldwide that are currently associated with GreyNet either via partnership, membership, sponsorship, or authorship in the field of grey literature. Entries are alphabetical by country and each entry has an embedded link to the corresponding organization's website. GreyNet International is proud in serving the grey literature community and welcomes additions and revisions to this Directory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greynet.org/internationaldirectory.html|title=International Directory of Organizations in Grey Literature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''WHOIS''' in the Field of Grey Literature is a compilation of over 350 biographical notes provided by authors in the International Conference Series on Grey Literature and The Grey Journal. This online resource is maintained by TextRelease, the Program and Conference Bureau. Records in this directory appear in alphabetical order by last name of author and each record contains a current email address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textrelease.com/whois2013.html|title=WHOIS in the field of Grey Literature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and Curriculum Development ==
In 2007 GreyNet conducted an international survey on grey literature among instructors in LIS higher education. In the same year, GreyNet implemented a distant education course on grey literature at the [[University of New Orleans]]. {{hdl|10068/697878}}

In 2009, GreyNet began the Annual Summer Workshop Series "'''GreyWorks'''", which is now in its 7th year. This series seeks to highlight the state of the art in grey literature by focussing on strategies, [[benchmarking|benchmarks]], good practices, [[mind maps]], and [[transparency (science)|transparency]] in this field of [[library and information science]].

In 2013, GreyNet began the '''GreyForum''', a Thematic Series of Onsite and Online Seminars and Workshops in the field of Grey Literature. Topics dealt with in this series have dealt with [[information ethics]], information rights, [[digital preservation]], and policy development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greynet.org/researchandeducation/workshops.html|title=Grey Literature - GreyNet Workshops and Seminars|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GreyNet management ==
The GreyNet Service is powered by [http://www.textrelease.com/TextRelease TextRelease], an independently owned company based in Amsterdam. TextRelease is GreyNet's program and conference bureau. TextRelease was responsible for GreyNet’s relaunch in 2003. Content compiled and edited within the Grey Literature Network Service is published and marketed via TextRelease. Furthermore, all agreements, contracts, and legal matters pertaining to GreyNet are handled through TextRelease.

== TextRelease and GreyNet ==
TextRelease’s main activities are situated in the domain of grey scientific &amp; technical information. Conference organization, information consultancy, research, publication, as well as education and training in the field of grey literature are among its objectives. In this capacity, TextRelease re-launched the Grey Literature Network Service (GreyNet) in 2003 and is the publishing body for this organization.

TextRelease provides Non-Exclusive Rights Agreements to nearly 300 authors, who have published in its Conference Proceedings and/or International Journal on Grey Literature. It maintains an up-to-date ”WHOIS in the field of Grey Literature”.

The TextRelease website likewise serves as the conference site for the International Conference Series on Grey Literature. This web resource provides direct access to Conference Announcements, Call-for-Papers, Official Programs, Registrations, and other conference related information.

[[File:Polio Egyptian Stele.jpg|thumb|An [[Egypt]]ian [[stele]] thought to represent a polio victim. [[18th Dynasty]] (1403–1365 BC).]]

The '''history of poliomyelitis''' (polio) infections extends into [[prehistory]]. Although major polio [[epidemic]]s were unknown before the 20th century,&lt;ref name=Trevelyan_2005&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trevelyan B, Smallman-Raynor M, Cliff A |title=The Spatial Dynamics of Poliomyelitis in the United States: From Epidemic Emergence to Vaccine-Induced Retreat, 1910–1971 |journal=Ann Assoc Am Geogr |volume=95 |issue=2 |pages=269–293 |year=2005 |pmid=16741562 |pmc=1473032 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.2005.00460.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; the disease has caused [[paralysis]] and death for much of human history.  Over [[millennia]], polio survived quietly as an [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] pathogen until the 1900s when major epidemics began to occur in Europe;&lt;ref name=Trevelyan_2005/&gt; soon after, widespread epidemics appeared in the United States. By 1910, frequent epidemics became regular events throughout the developed world, primarily in cities during the summer months. At its peak in the 1940s and 1950s, polio would paralyze or kill over half a million people worldwide every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Polio |publisher=Canadian International Immunization Initiative |url=http://www.immunize.cpha.ca/english/consumer/consrese/pdf/Polio.pdf |page=3 |accessdate=2007-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090612/http://www.immunize.cpha.ca/english/consumer/consrese/pdf/Polio.pdf |archivedate=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fear and the collective response to these epidemics would give rise to extraordinary public reaction and mobilization; spurring the development of new methods to prevent and treat the disease, and revolutionizing medical [[philanthropy]]. Although the development of two [[polio vaccines]] has [[Poliomyelitis eradication|eliminated poliomyelitis]] in all but three countries (Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs114/en/|title=Poliomyelitis|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170418105535/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs114/en/|archivedate=2017-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the legacy of poliomyelitis remains, in the development of modern [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation therapy]], and in the rise of [[disability rights movement]]s worldwide.

The symptoms of poliomyelitis have been described by many names. In the early nineteenth century the disease was known variously as: Dental Paralysis, Infantile Spinal Paralysis, Essential Paralysis of Children, Regressive Paralysis, Myelitis of the Anterior Horns, Tephromyelitis (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''tephros'', meaning "ash-gray") and Paralysis of the Morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Gould T | title = A Summer Plague: Polio and its Survivors | year = 1995 | publisher = Yale University Press | isbn = 0-300-06292-3 | chapter = Chapter One | url = http://www.businessweek.com/chapter/gould.htm | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070214054936/http://www.businessweek.com/chapter/gould.htm | archivedate = 2007-02-14 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1789 the first clinical description of poliomyelitis was provided by the British physician [[Michael Underwood (physician)|Michael Underwood]]—he refers to polio as "a debility of the lower extremities".&lt;ref name=Underwood_1789&gt;{{cite book | author = Underwood M | title = Debility of the lower extremities.

==Epidemics==
Major polio [[epidemic]]s were unknown before the 20th century; localized paralytic polio epidemics began to appear in Europe and the United States around 1900.&lt;ref name = Trevelyan_2005 /&gt; The first report of multiple polio cases was published in 1843 and described an 1841 outbreak in [[Louisiana]]. A fifty-year gap occurs before the next U.S. report—a cluster of 26 cases in [[Boston]] in 1893.&lt;ref name = Trevelyan_2005 /&gt; The first recognized U.S. polio epidemic occurred the following year in [[Vermont]] with 132 total cases (18 deaths), including several cases in adults.&lt;ref name=Sass_1996/&gt; Numerous epidemics of varying magnitude began to appear throughout the country; by 1907 approximately 2,500 cases of poliomyelitis were reported in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sachs B (Chairman, New York Neurological Society) | title = Epidemic poliomyelitis; report on the New York epidemic of 1907 by the Collective investigation committee | year = 1910 | publisher = The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Polio quarantine card.jpg|thumb|left|320px|This cardboard placard was placed in windows of residences where patients were quarantined due to poliomyelitis. Violating the quarantine order or removing the placard was punishable by a fine of up to US$100 in 1909 ({{Inflation|US|100|1909|fmt=eq}}).]]

{{Quote box
 |quote  = Polio was a plague. One day you had a headache and an hour later you were paralyzed. How far the virus crept up your spine determined whether you could walk afterward or even breathe. Parents waited fearfully every summer to see if it would strike. One case turned up and then another. The count began to climb. The city closed the swimming pools and we all stayed home, cooped indoors, shunning other children. Summer seemed like winter then.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rhodes]] (1990). ''A Hole in the World''.

On Saturday, June 17, 1916, an official announcement of the existence of an epidemic polio infection was made in [[Brooklyn, New York]].

Better hygiene meant that infants and young children had fewer opportunities to encounter and develop immunity to polio. Exposure to poliovirus was therefore delayed until late childhood or adult life, when it was more likely to take the paralytic form.&lt;ref name=Robertson_1993/&gt;

In children, paralysis due to polio occurs in one in 1000 cases, while in adults, paralysis occurs in one in 75 cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gawne AC, Halstead LS | title = Post-polio syndrome: pathophysiology and clinical management | journal = Critical Reviews in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | year = 1995 | volume = 7 | pages = 147–88 | url = http://www.ott.zynet.co.uk/polio/lincolnshire/library/gawne/ppspandcm-s00.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070806073707/http://www.ott.zynet.co.uk/polio/lincolnshire/library/gawne/ppspandcm-s00.html | archivedate = 2007-08-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1950, the peak age incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis in the United States had shifted from infants to children aged 5 to 9 years; about one-third of the cases were reported in persons over 15 years of age.&lt;ref name=Melnick_1990&gt;{{cite book | author = Melnick JL | title = Poliomyelitis.

==Historical treatments==
In the early 20th century—in the absence of proven treatments—a number of odd and potentially dangerous polio treatments were suggested. In [[John Haven Emerson]]'s ''A Monograph on the Epidemic of Poliomyelitis (Infantile Paralysis) in New York City in 1916''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Emerson H |title=A monograph on the epidemic of poliomyelitis (infantile paralysis) |publisher=Arno Press |location=New York |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=0-405-09817-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; one suggested remedy reads:

{{Cquote|Give [[oxygen]] through the lower extremities, by positive [[electricity]]. Frequent baths using [[almond meal]], or [[oxidise|oxidising]] the water. Applications of [[poultice]]s of [[Roman chamomile]], [[slippery elm]], [[arnica]], [[mustard seed|mustard]], [[Spanish fly|cantharis]], [[amygdala]]e [[Sweet almond oil|dulcis]] oil, and of special merit, [[spikenard]] oil and Xanthoxolinum.

Following the 1916 epidemics and having experienced little success in treating polio patients, researchers set out to find new and better treatments for the disease. Between 1917 and the early 1950s several therapies were explored in an effort to prevent deformities including [[hydrotherapy]] and  [[electrotherapy]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In 1935 Claus Jungeblut reported that [[vitamin C]] treatment inactivates the polio virus in vitro, making it non-infectious when injected into monkeys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Jungeblut | first=Claus Washington | title=INACTIVATION OF POLIOMYELITIS VIRUS IN VITRO BY CRYSTALLINE VITAMIN C (ASCORBIC ACID) | journal=Journal of Experimental Medicine | url= http://jem.rupress.org/cgi/reprint/62/4/517.pdf| date=October 1935 | volume=62 | pages=517–521 | doi=10.1084/jem.62.4.517 | pmid=19870431 | issue=4 | pmc=2133291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, Jungeblut injected polio into the brains of monkeys, and found that many more monkeys that also received vitamin C escaped paralysis than controls - the results seemed to indicate that low doses were more effective than high doses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2133474 | pmid=19870585 | volume=65 | title=VITAMIN C THERAPY AND PROPHYLAXIS IN EXPERIMENTAL POLIOMYELITIS | date=January 1937 | author=Jungeblut CW | journal=J.

In 1939, Albert Sabin reported that an experiment, employing the technique of "forcefully expelling the total amount [of Polio] in the direction of the olfactory mucosa, immediately drawing it back into the pipette, and repeating the process 2 to 3 times",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2133663 | pmid=19870774 | volume=68 | title=FATE OF NASALLY INSTILLED POLIOMYELITIS VIRUS IN NORMAL AND CONVALESCENT MONKEYS WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE PROBLEM OF HOST TO HOST TRANSMISSION | author=Sabin AB, Olitsky PK | journal=J Exp Med | pages=39–62 | doi=10.1084/jem.68.1.39}}&lt;/ref&gt; was unable to confirm the results of Jungeblut, but found that "monkeys on a scorbutic diet died of spontaneous acute infections, chiefly pneumonia and enterocolitis, while their mates receiving an adequate diet remained well."&lt;ref name=Sabin_C&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sabin, A.B. |title=VITAMIN C IN RELATION TO EXPERIMENTAL POLIOMYELITIS : WITH INCIDENTAL OBSERVATIONS ON CERTAIN MANIFESTATIONS IN MACACUS RHESUS MONKEYS ON A SCORBUTIC DIET |pmc=2133652 | journal=J.

===Iron lung===
[[File:Iron lung CDC.jpg|thumb|right|This [[iron lung]] was donated to the [[Centers for Disease Control|CDC]] by the family of Barton Hebert of [[Covington, Louisiana]], who had used the device from the late 1950s until his death in 2003.]]
The first [[iron lung]] used in the treatment of polio victims was invented by [[Philip Drinker]], Louis Agassiz Shaw, and James Wilson at [[Harvard]], and tested October 12, 1928, at Children's Hospital, Boston.&lt;ref name=Branson&gt;{{cite journal|author=Branson RD |title=A Tribute to John H.

When the pressure is lowered, the chest cavity expands, trying to fill this partial vacuum. When the pressure is raised the chest cavity contracts. This expansion and contraction mimics the physiology of normal breathing. The design of the iron lung was subsequently improved by using a bellows attached directly to the machine, and [[John Haven Emerson]] modified the design to make production less expensive.&lt;ref name=Branson/&gt; The Emerson Iron Lung was produced until 1970.&lt;ref name=AARP&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nelson R | year = 2004 | url =http://www.aarp.org/bulletin/yourhealth/a2004-09-13-borrowed_time.html  | title = On Borrowed Time: The last iron lung users face a future without repair service | journal = AARP Bulletin | accessdate = 2010-02-07 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011155/http://www.aarp.org/bulletin/yourhealth/a2004-09-13-borrowed_time.html |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other respiratory aids were used such as the [[Bragg-Paul Pulsator]], and the "rocking bed" for patients with less critical breathing difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mehta|first1=Sangeeta|last2=Hill|first2=Nicholas S|title=Noninvasive Ventilation|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=2001|volume=163| issue = 2|pages=540–577|doi=10.1164/ajrccm.163.2.9906116|url=http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/ajrccm.163.2.9906116#readcube-epdf|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passive immunotherapy===
In 1950 [[William Hammon]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] isolated [[Blood serum|serum]], containing [[antibodies]] against poliovirus, from the blood of polio survivors.&lt;ref name= Hammon_1966/&gt; The serum, Hammon believed, would prevent the spread of polio and to reduce the severity of disease in polio patients.&lt;ref name=Rinaldo&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rinaldo C |title=Passive Immunization Against Poliomyelitis: The Hammon Gamma Globulin Field Trials, 1951–1953 |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=95 |issue=5 |pages=790–9 |year=2005 |pmid=15855454 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.040790 |pmc=1449257 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between September 1951 and July 1952 nearly 55,000 children were involved in a [[clinical trial]] of the anti-polio serum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unsung Hero of the War on Polio |url=http://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/docs/Public_Health_Spring_2004.pdf |work=Public Health Magazine |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health |year=2004 |accessdate=2010-02-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611194502/http://www.publichealth.pitt.edu/docs/Public_Health_Spring_2004.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the trial were promising; the serum was shown to be about 80% effective in preventing the development of paralytic poliomyelitis, and protection was shown to last for 5 weeks if given under tightly controlled circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Hammon W, Coriell L, Ludwig E, etal |title=Evaluation of Red Cross gamma globulin as a prophylactic agent for poliomyelitis. 5.

The large-scale use of antibody serum to prevent and treat polio had a number of drawbacks, however, including the observation that the immunity provided by the serum did not last long, and the protection offered by the antibody was incomplete, that re-injection was required during each epidemic outbreak, and that the optimal time frame for administration was unknown.&lt;ref name=Rinaldo/&gt; The antibody serum was widely administered, but obtaining the serum was an expensive and time-consuming process, and the focus of the medical community soon shifted to the development of a polio vaccine.&lt;ref name=Spice&gt;{{cite news |author=Spice B |title=Tireless polio research effort bears fruit and indignation |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05094/482468.stm |work=The Salk vaccine: 50 years later- second of two parts |publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=2005-04-04 |accessdate=2010-02-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905022100/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05094/482468.stm |archivedate=2008-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kenny regimen===
Early management practices for paralyzed muscles emphasized the need to rest the affected muscles and suggested that the application of [[splint (medicine)|splint]]s would prevent tightening of muscle, tendons, [[ligament]]s, or skin that would prevent normal movement. Many paralyzed polio patients lay in plaster body casts for months at a time. This prolonged casting often resulted in [[atrophy]] of both affected and unaffected muscles.&lt;ref name= Daniel/&gt;

In 1940, Sister [[Elizabeth Kenny]], an [[Australian bush]] nurse from [[Queensland]], arrived in North America and challenged this approach to treatment. In treating polio cases in rural Australia between 1928 and 1940, Kenny had developed a form of [[physical therapy]] that—instead of immobilizing afflicted limbs—aimed to relieve pain and spasms in polio patients through the use of hot, moist packs to relieve muscle spasm and early activity and exercise to maximize the strength of unaffected muscle fibers and promote the [[Neuroplasticity|neuroplastic]] recruitment of remaining nerve cells that had not been killed by the virus.&lt;ref name= Oppewal/&gt; Sister Kenny later settled in [[Minnesota]] where she established the [[Sister Kenny Rehabilitation Institute]], beginning a world-wide crusade to advocate her system of treatment. Slowly, Kenny's ideas won acceptance, and by the mid-20th century had become the hallmark for the treatment of paralytic polio.&lt;ref name= Late/&gt; In combination with [[antispasmodic]] medications to reduce muscular contractions, Kenny's therapy is still used in the treatment of paralytic poliomyelitis.

In 2009 as part of the [[Q150]] celebrations, the Kenny regimen for polio treatment was announced as one of the [[Q150 Icons]] of Queensland for its role as an iconic "innovation and invention".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|title=PREMIER UNVEILS QUEENSLAND’S 150 ICONS|last=Bligh|first=Anna|authorlink=Anna Bligh|date=10 June 2009|website=|publisher=[[Queensland Government]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524033717/http://statements.qld.gov.au/statement/id/64301|archive-date=24 May 2017|dead-url=|access-date=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vaccine development==
{{main|Polio vaccine}}
[[File:Polio immunization days PHIL 2445.png|thumb|250px|left|People in [[Columbus, Georgia]], awaiting polio [[vaccination]] during the early days of the National Polio Immunization Program.]]
In 1935 [[Maurice Brodie]], a research assistant at [[New York University]], attempted to produce a polio vaccine, procured from virus in ground up [[monkey]] spinal cords, and killed by [[formaldehyde]]. Brodie first tested the vaccine on himself and several of his assistants. He then gave the vaccine to three thousand children. Many developed allergic reactions, but none of the children developed an immunity to polio.&lt;ref name=Pearce&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pearce J |title=Salk and Sabin: poliomyelitis immunisation |url=http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/75/11/1552 |journal=J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry |volume=75 |issue=11 |page=1552 |year=2004 |pmid=15489385 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.2003.028530 |pmc=1738787 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204174235/http://jnnp.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/75/11/1552 |archivedate=2008-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1940s and early 1950s, a research group, headed by [[John Enders]] at the Boston Children's Hospital, successfully cultivated the [[poliovirus]] in human tissue. This significant breakthrough ultimately allowed for the development of the polio vaccines. Enders and his colleagues, [[Thomas H. Weller]] and [[Frederick C. Robbins]], were recognized for their labors with the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1954.&lt;ref name=Nobel_1954&gt;{{cite web | title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1954 | publisher=The Nobel Foundation | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1954/ | accessdate=2010-02-07 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219224515/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1954/ | archivedate=2008-12-19 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two vaccines are used throughout the world to combat [[polio]].  The first was developed by [[Jonas Salk]], first tested in 1952, and announced to the world by Salk on April 12, 1955.&lt;ref name= Spice /&gt;  The Salk vaccine, or ''inactivated poliovirus vaccine'' (IPV), consists of an injected dose of killed [[poliovirus]]. In 1954, the vaccine was tested for its ability to prevent polio; the field trials involving the Salk vaccine would grow to be the largest medical experiment in history. Immediately following licensing, [[vaccination]] campaigns were launched, by 1957, following mass immunizations promoted by the [[March of Dimes]] the annual number of polio cases in the United States was reduced, from a peak of nearly 58,000 cases, to 5,600 cases.&lt;ref name=Sass_1996/&gt;

Eight years after Salk's success, [[Albert Sabin]] developed an ''oral polio vaccine'' (OPV) using live but weakened (''[[wiktionary:Attenuate|attenuated]]'') virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Sabin A, Ramos-Alvarez M, Alvarez-Amezquita J, etal |title=Live, orally given poliovirus vaccine.

==Legacy==
Early in the twentieth century polio became the world's most feared disease.{{Cn|date=April 2018}}  The disease hit without warning, tended to strike white, [[Affluence in the United States|affluent]] individuals, required long [[quarantine]] periods during which parents were separated from children: it was impossible to tell who would get the disease and who would be spared.&lt;ref name=Sass_1996/&gt;  The consequences of the disease left polio victims marked for life, leaving behind vivid images of [[wheelchair]]s, crutches, leg braces, breathing devices, and deformed limbs.  However, polio changed not only the lives of those who survived it, but also affected profound cultural changes: the emergence of [[grassroots]] fund-raising campaigns that would revolutionize medical [[philanthropy]], the rise of rehabilitation therapy and, through campaigns for the social and civil rights of the disabled, polio survivors helped to spur the modern disability rights movement.

In addition, the occurrence of polio epidemics led to a number of public health innovations.  One of the most widespread was the proliferation of "no spitting" ordinances in the United States and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;See David M. Oshinsky, ''Polio: an American Story''. Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philanthropy===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:March of dimes.jpg|thumb|March of Dimes poster circa late 1950s]] --&gt;

In 1921 [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] became totally and permanently [[paralyzed]] from the waist down. Although [[Franklin D. Roosevelt's paralytic illness|the paralysis]] (whether from poliomyelitis, as diagnosed at the time, or from [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]]) had no cure at the time, Roosevelt, who had planned a life in politics, refused to accept the limitations of his disease.  He tried a wide range of therapies, including [[hydrotherapy]] in [[Warm Springs, Georgia]] (see below).  In 1938 Roosevelt helped to found the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (now known as the [[March of Dimes]]), that raised money for the [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] of victims of paralytic polio, and was instrumental in funding the development of [[polio vaccines]].  The March of Dimes changed the way it approached fund-raising.  Rather than soliciting large contributions from a few wealthy individuals, the March of Dimes sought small donations from millions of individuals. Its hugely successful fund-raising campaigns collected hundreds of millions of dollars—more than all of the U.S. [[charities]] at the time combined (with the exception of the [[Red Cross]]).&lt;ref name= Oshinsky&gt;{{cite book |author=Oshinsky DM|title=Polio: an American story |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=0-19-515294-8 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1955 the March of Dimes had invested $25.5 million in research;&lt;ref name=HHMI_FDR&gt;{{cite web | title = FDR and Polio: Public Life, Private Pain | publisher = Howard Hughes Medical Institute | url = http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/disease/polio/polio2.html | accessdate = 2010-02-07 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100324105758/http://www.hhmi.org/biointeractive/disease/polio/polio2.html | archivedate = 2010-03-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; funding both Jonas Salk's and Albert Sabin's vaccine development; the 1954–55 field trial of vaccine, and supplies of free vaccine for thousands of children.&lt;ref name=NMAH/&gt;

In 1952, during the worst recorded epidemic, 3,145 people in the United States died from polio.&lt;ref name=Vital_Statistics_1952&gt;{{cite book | author = Dunn HL | title = Vital Statistics of the United States (1952): Volume II, Mortality Data | publisher = United States Government Printing Office | year = 1955 | url = https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsus/VSUS_1952_2.pdf | format = PDF | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20171113010926/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsus/VSUS_1952_2.pdf | archivedate = 2017-11-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year over 200,000 people (including 4,000 children) died of [[cancer]] and 20,000 (including 1,500 children) died of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name=Vital_Statistics_1952/&gt;  According to [[David Oshinsky]]'s book ''Polio: An American Story'': "There is evidence that the March of Dimes over-hyped polio, and promoted an image of immediately curable polio victims, which was not true.  The March of Dimes refused to partner with other charity organizations like the [[United Way of America|United Way]]."&lt;ref name= Oshinsky/&gt;

===Rehabilitation therapy===
[[File:Polio physical therapy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A [[physical therapist]] assists two polio-stricken children while they exercise their lower limbs.]]
Prior to the polio scares of the twentieth century, most [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation|rehabilitation therapy]] was focused on treating injured soldiers returning from war. The crippling effects of polio led to heightened awareness and public support of physical rehabilitation, and in response a number of rehabilitation centers specifically aimed at treating polio patients were opened, with the task of restoring and building the remaining strength of polio victims and teaching new, compensatory skills to large numbers of newly paralyzed individuals.&lt;ref name= Wilson/&gt;

In 1926, Franklin Roosevelt, convinced of the benefits of [[hydrotherapy]], bought a resort at [[Warm Springs, Georgia]], where he founded the first modern rehabilitation center for treatment of polio patients which still operates as the [[Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for Rehabilitation]].&lt;ref name=Ralph&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallagher HG | year = 2002 | url = http://www.ralphmag.org/BR/gallagher-russia1.html | title = Disability Rights And Russia (speech) | journal = The Review of Arts, Literature, Philosophy and the Humanities | volume = XXXII | accessdate = 2010-02-07 | issue = 1 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100616003946/http://ralphmag.org/BR/gallagher-russia1.html | archivedate = 2010-06-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of polio rehabilitation was often more than the average family could afford, and more than 80% of the nation's polio patients would receive funding through the March of Dimes.&lt;ref name= Oshinsky/&gt; Some families also received support through philanthropic organizations such as the [[Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine]] fraternity, which established a network of pediatric hospitals in 1919, the [[Shriners Hospitals for Children]], to provide care free of charge for children with polio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Rackl L | date = 2006-06-05 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1628475.html | title = Hospital marks 80 years of treating kids for free | work = Chicago Sun-Times | accessdate = 2010-02-07 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121103020638/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1628475.html | archivedate = 2012-11-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability rights movement===
As thousands of polio survivors with varying degrees of paralysis left the rehabilitation hospitals and went home, to school and to work, many were frustrated by a lack of [[accessibility]] and discrimination they experienced in their communities. In the early 20th century the use of a [[wheelchair]] at home or out in public was a daunting prospect as no [[public transportation]] system accommodated wheelchairs and most public buildings including schools, were inaccessible to those with disabilities.  Many children left [[disabled]] by polio were forced to attend separate institutions for "crippled children" or had to be carried up and down stairs.&lt;ref name= Ralph/&gt;

As people who had been paralyzed by polio matured, they began to demand the right to participate in the mainstream of society. Polio survivors were often in the forefront of the [[disability rights movement]] that emerged in the United States during the 1970s, and pushed legislation such as the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] which protected qualified individuals from discrimination based on their disability, and the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] of 1990.&lt;ref name= Ralph/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |veditors=Morris RB, Morris JB|title=Encyclopedia of American History |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |year=1996 |pages= |isbn=0-06-270055-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other political movements led by polio survivors include the [[Independent Living]] and [[Universal design]] movements of the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Scalise K | year = 1998 | url = http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/98legacy/02_23_98a.html | title = New collection of original documents and histories unveils disability rights movement | work = University of California at Berkeley News Release | accessdate = 2010-02-07 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527223636/http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/98legacy/02_23_98a.html | archivedate = 2010-05-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polio survivors are one of the largest disabled groups in the world. The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that there are 10 to 20 million polio survivors worldwide.&lt;ref name=NewsDesk&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marchofdimes.org/news/after-effects-of-polio-can-harm-survivors-40-years-later.aspx | title = After Effects of Polio Can Harm Survivors 40 Years Later | year = 2001 | work = March of Dimes: News Desk | accessdate = 2014-11-14 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141225210413/http://www.marchofdimes.org/news/after-effects-of-polio-can-harm-survivors-40-years-later.aspx | archivedate = 2014-12-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, the National Health Interview Survey reported that there were 254,000 people living in the United States who had been paralyzed by polio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Frick N, Bruno R |title=Post-polio sequelae: physiological and psychological overview |journal=Rehabil Lit |volume=47 |issue=5–6 |pages=106–11 |pmid=3749588|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to local polio support groups and doctors, some 40,000 polio survivors with varying degrees of paralysis live in Germany, 30,000 in Japan, 24,000 in France, 16,000 in Australia, 12,000 in Canada and 12,000 in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name= NewsDesk/&gt;

'''Interactive children's books''' are a subset of [[children's books]] that require participation and interaction by the reader. Participation can range from books with texture to those with special devices used to help teach children certain tools. Interactive children's books may also incorporate modern technology or be computerized books. Movable books, a subsection of interactive books, are defined as "covering [[Pop-up book|pop-ups]], transformations, tunnel books, volvelles, flaps, pull-tabs, pop-outs, pull-downs, and more, each of which performs in a different manner. Also included, because they employ the same techniques, are three-dimensional greeting cards."{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Volvelles==
The earliest form of interactive books are thought to be [[volvelle]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/popup/theme.html]&lt;/ref&gt; a type of movable book with a wheel, which at the time was used to help display astrological and geographical maps.

== Pop-up books ==
It wasn't until the late nineteenth century, partly due to the invention of industrial printing, that [[Pop-up book|pop-ups]] were created. The first pop-up books published in America were those in the Showman Series published by the McLoughlin Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/popup/showman.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Still, these books were too expensive and fragile to be practical children's books. Pop-ups opened the door for the creation of many other types of interactive books for both children and adults. Despite a brief decline in production during the mid-twentieth century, it was a new idea that spawned quickly and eventually became the highly technological and advanced world of books that it is today.

== Coloring books ==
The [[coloring book]] format, of line drawings to which the child adds color, has been in production since the early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Gamebooks ==
[[Gamebook]]s are much like traditional books, but they offer the reader decisions throughout the book, with the decisions affecting the outcome of the story.  At each decision point, the reader is instructed to go to a particular page and/or paragraph to continue the story.  The first gamebook debuted in 1941.  The format was especially popular in the 1980s.

== Hidden object and picture books ==

Hidden object picture books engage readers of all ages by camouflaging items with the intention of children eventually finding them.  Whether the hidden object is a hard to spot character or an item specified by the author in a rhyming list, is subject to the book or possibly the series of books it belongs to.  Although it is not standard, these types of interactive children’s books are sometimes published with a common theme such as Christmas or life on the farm.  Children can interactively experience a selective number of these books as early as age four and beginning at a pre-kindergarten grade level, depending on how easily the hidden objectives can be located.  There are several notable authors and illustrators at the frontline assisting their audiences’ development of interactive reading skills in hidden object picture books:

===Martin Handford Where’s Wally?===
British illustrator [[Martin Handford]] is credited with the conception of the [[Where's Wally?]] series.  Despite the series christened title, his hidden picture books are more recognizable under the North American franchise’s version of the character, Waldo.  The purpose of Handford’s hidden object picture books is for children of all ages to identify Wally in a specified location throughout his “world-wide hike.” Although various activities and outfit similarities easily camouflage the character’s whereabouts, Wally always wears glasses and carries a walking stick and is famous for his outfit of a red and white horizontally striped shirt, blue trousers and a bobble hat.

The first book in Handford’s series, originally titled ''Where's Wally?'', was published in 1987. The book was soon followed by the release of [[Where's Wally Now?]] (1988) and [[Where's Wally?: The Fantastic Journey]] (1989). The books became extremely popular and were translated into many languages.  The trademark of Wally was adopted in 28 countries and the character is often given a different name and personality in the translations.

As more books were released the cast of characters grew as well - including Wizard Whitebeard, Wilma, Wenda, [[Woof (Where's Waldo)|Woof]], Odlaw and the Waldo Watchers.  More Waldo books followed - such as [[Where's Waldo in Hollywood?]], [[Where's Waldo?: The Wonder Book]] (1997), [[Where's Waldo?: The Great Picture Hunt]] (2006).

Waldo became a huge pop culture sensation in the early 1990s. The United States, in particular, was swept with "Waldo-mania".  Aside from the adaptations of Handford's books, the franchises grew to include licensing of Waldo for video games, spin-off books, magazines, dolls, toys, comics and a [[Where's Waldo? (TV series)]].

Wally has his own website where he dispatches messages to fans and invites them to join in on the chase through different social networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findwally.co.uk/ FindWally.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean Marzollo and Walter Wick I Spy===

[[I Spy (Scholastic)|I Spy]] is another interactive children’s book series that can be categorized as a hidden object picture book.  Debuting in 1992, the books consist of texts written by [[Jean Marzollo]] regarding items hidden within the photographs captured by [[Walter Wick]].

Wick’s photographs are set up in a cluttered assortment of items or to imitate a particular scene, like the toy shop window in I Spy: Christmas (1992).  Below the picture, Marzollo involves readers with a riddle asking them to locate specific items within Wick’s photograph.  Wick’s photographs are highly regarded for their expressive quality.

The series originated with I Spy: A Book of Picture Riddles (1992) and grew to include I Spy: Christmas (1992), I Spy: Fun House (1993), I Spy: Mystery (1993), I Spy: Fantasy (1994), I Spy: School Days (1995), I Spy: Spooky Night (1996), and I Spy: Treasure Hunt (1999).

A subsequent and more challenging series was begun in 1997 with I Spy: Super Challenger! (1997) and was continued with other installments such as I Spy: Gold Challenger! (1998), I Spy: Extreme Challenger! (2000), I Spy: Year-Round Challenger! (2001), and I Spy: Ultimate Challenger! (2003).

The I Spy label has grown to include video games based on the books such as [[I Spy Spooky Mansion]], [[I Spy Treasure Hunt]] and [[I Spy Fantasy]].

The franchise also includes Ultimate I Spy, an I Spy game for the [[Wii]]. I Spy: Fun House is being developed into a [[Nintendo DS]] game. The player is trapped in the actual fun-house and must find nine items to escape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ds.ign.com/articles/794/794633p1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Wick is also author of his own hidden object series, similar to I Spy, called Can You See What I See?. These books feature photographs and poems that require readers to find objects in the picture. The puzzles are slightly easier than those of the I Spy books.

==Other Hidden Object Books==

Martin Handford, Jean Marzollo and Walter Wick are not the only three authors of hidden object picture books. However, they are the most established and recognized in the publishing world.  Another author worth mentioning is Gillian Doherty. She is a published author and editor of children's books. Her hidden object picture books include 1001 Monster Things to Spot, 1001 Things to Spot, 1001 Wizard Things to Spot, and 1001 Things to Spot.

== Touch and Feel books ==

Many interactive books are made specifically for children. Touch-and-feel books, or texturized books, fall in this area. The prime age for touch and feel books is from toddler-age to preschool. Because these books are aimed specifically at helping children develop knowledge while increasing the use of their senses, appeal is lost to older generations who more than likely already possess the skills being taught. One of the key advantages to teaching senses and vocabulary through the use of touch and feel books is the connection a child can gain by instantly being rewarded with the texture that the word describes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.childtrek.com/childrens-books/touch-feel-childrens-books.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107101413/http://www.childtrek.com/childrens-books/touch-feel-childrens-books.html |archivedate=2009-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, touch-and-feel books have gone to a new level with the creation of fun new ways for younger children to interact with books such as musical "bath books" and "finger puppet books". Most, but not all, of these books are also "board books", which are made entirely out of hard pages. Making the pages out of a hard material provides for durability, allowing them to resist whatever they may contact along with the young readers. Bath books can be taken into the tub because of their floatable and waterproof pages. A few of the top touch and feel book publishers are Dorling Kindersley, Usborne, Macmillan, and Lamaze.

== Pop-up books ==
Children’s pop-up books are a form of interactive literature in which upon turning the page, an image literally “pops-up”.  These books provide 3-D illustrations made of unfolding paper that allow for the child to feel as if the book is coming to life.  First created in the mid-thirteenth century, they were originally not intended for children until publisher [[Robert Sayer]] created ''Harlquinade'' in 1765.  With his creating of a “lift-the-flap” book, he gave children a way to truly become involved with what they are reading.  From then, several other authors, such as [[William Grimaldi]], designed their version of the pop-up book depicting elaborate scenes from page to page that allowed for the reader to determine the outcome of the story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.unt.edu/rarebooks/exhibits/popup2/introduction.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
The pop-up book has evolved from a seemingly simplistic idea to one of more sophistication, as well as complication.  They have grown to be a genre that delights, intrigues, and educates children of all ages.

One key person in the pop-up book phenomenon is Waldo Hunt, who was the first to develop these books in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.seattlepi.com/bookpatrol/archives/186608.asp?from=blog_last3]&lt;/ref&gt; He found joy and creativity in the idea of creating a pop-up image in a book.  He was the true advocate and mastermind behind their conception and popularity.

Pop-up books are common enough to be found in your local library, bookstore, classroom, or likely even your own bookshelf. There are several examples of these kinds of books, but some famous ones to check out are: Christmas in New York by Chuck Fischer, Star Wars: A Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy by Matthew Reinhart, and The Amazing Pop-Up Geography Book by Kate Petty.  Pop-up books can range from very simplistic 3-D illustrations to more intricate and detailed presentations depending upon the topic of the book, its author and illustrator, as well as the age of the audience they are appealing to.

== Digitized learning books ==

Many children’s interactive books have been enhanced through the use of technology. The earliest examples of this were books that had sound effects- a bar on the side of the book that had buttons corresponding with pictures in the story. When the icon appeared in the story, the reader could press a button on the side to hear the sound effect. These are called “sound books.” Books that had accompanying cassette tapes (or even CDs), usually known as books on tape, are another early example of this.

Once computers became more prevalent, CD-ROM versions of books became popular. These were programs that put books on the computer screen, enabling children to click their way through various words and pictures in the story and have it come alive. The technology was fairly limited, however, and not widespread as only children with access to a PC (and the knowledge to use it) could take advantage of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.marketplaceadvisor.channeladvisor.com/hi/5/4830/lb-just-grandma-slv-f.jpg Richard Scarry's ''Just Grandma and Me''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The next big step in this technology was [[LeapPad|Leap Frog’s Leap Pad.]] The Leap Pad makes regular books interactive by enabling children to hear a word aloud, have the story read to them, have words and sounds spelled for them, play interactive learning games on many pages and more, simply by touching the included “pen” to different places on the page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leapfrog.com/etc/medialib/leapfrog/parent_guides/pg_prekind.Par.36099.File.dat/pg_leappad.pd Leap Pad Parents’ Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; The system is divided into “Leap Levels” for different-aged children and includes everything from picture books to chapter books, with separate Leap Pads corresponding to each level. There is also a unit that allows new content to be downloaded from Leap Frog’s Web site. The technology of the Leap Pad continued evolving, and Leap Frog next came out with the [[Tag (LeapFrog)]]. Instead of a Pad unit where books must be inserted, the Tag system is essentially a “pen” onto which books can be downloaded. Then, the pen can be scanned across the corresponding book to read it aloud, unlock activities and more.
The goal for these products is to help children get more out of their books and learn to read, according to Leap Frog.  Leap Frog even has its own publishing company, Leap Frog Press, which creates books specifically designed for its system. The products are not cheap, though- the Leap Pad can cost as much as $80. The Tag is usually sold in gift packs that run anywhere from $20 to $75. Books for each are sold separately and typically cost $12 or more.
Of course, Leap Frog is not the only company with products like the Leap Pad or Tag system that use technology to enhance the reading experience for children. However, it was one of the first, and now several companies have copied the idea and made similar products.

The newest advance in interactive children's books reflects the recent popularity of [[Amazon Kindle|Amazon's Kindle.]] There are now a plethora of e-book sites that place children's picture books, along with LeapFrog-like sound effects and word pronunciation, completely online-often for free. Some will actually read an entire story aloud. These "virtual libraries have done a lot to both preserve books and make them more available.

Here are a few examples of some interactive e-book sites for children:

Even older classic books are moving to online to keep up with the times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findwaldo.com/ ''Where’s Waldo ''series of books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104013730/http://findwaldo.com/ |date=2010-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholastic.com/ispy/ the ''I Spy ''series of books]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Large Seal script''' or '''Great Seal script''' ({{zh|c=大篆|p=Dàzhuàn}}) is a traditional reference to [[Chinese writing]] from before the [[Qin dynasty]] (i.e. before 221 BCE), and is now popularly understood to refer narrowly to the writing of the Western and early Eastern [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]]  dynasties (i.e. 1046–403 BCE), and more broadly to also include the [[oracle bone script]] (c.1250–1000 BCE). The term is in contrast to the name of the official script of the Qin dynasty, which is often called  [[Small seal script|Small or Lesser Seal Script]] (小篆 ''Xiǎozhuàn'', also termed simply ''seal script''). However, due to the lack of precision in the term, scholars often avoid it and instead refer more specifically to the provenance of particular examples of writing.

In the [[Han dynasty]] (202 BCE – 220 CE), when [[clerical script]] became the popular form of writing and (small) seal script was relegated to more formal usage such as on signet [[Seal (device)|seal]]s and for the titles of [[stelae]] (inscribed stone memorial tablets which were popular at the time), the people began to refer to the earlier Qin dynasty script as 'seal' script (due to the continued use on signet seals, or name chops). At that time, there was still knowledge of even older, often more complex graphs (dating to the middle to late Zhou dynasty, and directly ancestral to the Qin forms) which differed from the Qin seal script forms, but which resembled them in their rounded, seal-script-like style (as opposed to the squared, rectilinear clerical script style).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsm-whu.org/zxcl 中國古代簡帛字形、辭例數據庫]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, two terms emerged to describe them: 'greater seal script' for the more complex, earlier forms, and 'small seal script' for the Qin dynasty forms.

It is only more recently that the term 'greater seal script' has been extended to refer to [[Western Zhou]] forms or even [[oracle bone]] script, of which the Han dynasty coiners of this term were unaware. The term 'large seal script' is also sometimes traditionally identified with a group of characters from a book c. 800 BCE entitled ''[[Shizhoupian]]'', preserved by their inclusion in the Han dynasty lexicon, the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''. [[Xu Shen]], the author of ''Shuowen'', included these when they differed from the structures of the Qin (small) seal script, and labelled the examples Zhòuwén (籀文) or Zhòu graphs. This name comes from the name of the book and not the name of a script. Thus, it is not correct to refer to the c. 800 BCE Zhoū (周) dynasty script ''as'' Zhòuwén. Similarly, the Zhòu graphs are merely examples of large seal script when that term is used in a broad sense.

==Career==
Ritmeyer holds an M.A. in Conservation Studies from the Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies, [[University of York]], England, and a Ph.D. from the [[University of Manchester]], England.

Beginning in 1973, Ritmeyer served for 10 years as official architect of the archaeological dig at the [[Southern Wall]] of the [[Temple Mount]] directed by [[Benjamin Mazar]].&lt;ref name=ShanksLost&gt;"How We Lost the Temple Mount," [[Hershel Shanks]], [[Moment (magazine)]], June 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritmeyer is known for the "solid scientific research" he has done on the archaeology and architecture of the [[Temple Mount]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="autogenerated78"&gt;Gershom Gorenberg, ''The End of Days'' (Oxford: OUP, 2002), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; He discovered archaeological evidence for the location of [[Solomon's Temple]], the emplacement of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] on the [[Foundation Stone]],&lt;ref&gt;'[http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-06/local/me-21736_1_temple-mount Architect Claims He Has Pieced Together Old Biblical Puzzle]' in [[Los Angeles Times]], Jan 6, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and the location of the platform as extended in the [[First Temple]] period, probably during the time of [[Hezekiah]] described as a square of 500 [[cubit]]s in ''[[Mishnah]] [[Middot (Talmud)|Middot]]'' 2.1.  He has demonstrated that one of the steps leading to the [[Dome of the Rock]] is actually the top of a remaining stone course of the pre-[[Herodian dynasty|Herodian]] [[Western Wall]] of the Temple Mount platform.&lt;ref name="autogenerated78"/&gt;

Ritmeyer is known for his architectural models of the buildings of ancient Jerusalem. His [[Replicas of the Jewish Temple|models of the historical Jewish Temples]] have been exhibited at museums including the [[Yeshiva University Museum]] in New York&lt;ref&gt;[http://spider.mc.yu.edu/news/articles/article.cfm?id=101578]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501145218/http://spider.mc.yu.edu/news/articles/article.cfm?id=101578 |date=May 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Siegfried Horn|Siegfried H.

They were surprised — I had been an art-agnostic all my life. Laura said, “You ought to try it.” It seemed like she was slightly skeptical.

In Rembrandt scholar Stephanie Dickey's words: {{quote|[Rembrandt] earned international renown as a painter, printmaker, teacher, and art collector while never leaving the Dutch Republic. In his home city of Leiden and in Amsterdam, where he worked for nearly forty years, he mentored generations of other painters and produced a body of work that has never ceased to attract admiration, critique, and interpretation. (...) Rembrandt's art is a key component in any study of the Dutch Golden Age, and his membership in the canon of artistic genius is well established, but he is also a figure whose significance transcends specialist interest. Literary critics have pondered "Rembrandt" as a "cultural text"; novelists, playwrights, and filmmakers have romanticized his life, and in popular culture, his name has become synonymous with excellence for products and services, ranging from toothpaste to self-help advice."&lt;ref name="FranitsAshgate2016"&gt;Franits, Wayne (ed.): ''The Ashgate Research Companion to Dutch Art of the Seventeenth Century''. (Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For a visual artist in general and an [[Old Master]] in particular, Rembrandt (i.e. his life, art, and circle) has been the subject of a vast amount of literature that includes both [[fiction]] and nonfiction works. The field of [[:Category:Rembrandt studies|Rembrandt studies]] (study of Rembrandt's life and work, including works by [[List of Rembrandt pupils|his pupils and followers]]) — as an academic field in its own right with many noted [[List of Rembrandt connoisseurs and scholars|Rembrandt connoisseurs and scholars]] — has been one of the most dynamic research areas of [[Netherlandish art]] (or [[art of the Low Countries|art of the pre-1830 Low Countries]]) history.&lt;ref name="Slive"&gt;[[Seymour Slive|Slive, Seymour]]: ''Rembrandt and his Critics, 1630–1730''.

{{Marxism|Schools of thought}}
[[Marxism]] is a method of [[socioeconomic]] analysis that frames [[capitalism]] through a paradigm of exploitation, analyzes [[Social class|class]] relations and [[Social conflict|social conflict]] using a [[Historical materialism|materialist interpretation of historical development]] and takes a [[dialectic]]al view of social transformation. While it originates from the works of 19th century German philosophers [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], Marxism has had several different schools of thought.

== Marxism–Leninism ==
{{main|Marxism–Leninism}}
* Note: this is a discussion of [[Marxism–Leninism]] as a school of thought. For a discussion of its political practice, see subsection [[Marxism#Marxism as a political practice|Marxism as a political practice]] below.
At least in terms of adherents and the impact on the world stage, Marxism–Leninism, also known colloquially as [[Bolshevism]] or simply [[communism]], is the biggest trend within Marxism, easily dwarfing all of the other schools of thought combined.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Communist Party of China alone has more than 66 million members. See http://www.chinatoday.com/org/cpc/&lt;/ref&gt; Marxism–Leninism is a term originally coined by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in order to denote the ideology that [[Vladimir Lenin]] had built upon the thought of [[Karl Marx]]. There are two broad areas that have set apart Marxism–Leninism as a school of thought.

First, Lenin's followers generally view his additions to the body of Marxism as the practical corollary to [[Classical Marxism|Marx's original theoretical contributions]] of the 19th century—insofar as they apply under the conditions of advanced [[capitalism]] that they found themselves working in. Lenin called this time-frame the era of [[imperialism]]. For example, [[Joseph Stalin]] wrote: {{Cquote|Leninism grew up and took shape under the conditions of imperialism, when the contradictions of capitalism had reached an extreme point, when the proletarian revolution had become an immediate practical question, when the old period of preparation of the working class for revolution had arrived at and passed into a new period, that of direct assault on capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marx2mao.com/Stalin/FL24.html#c1&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The most important consequence of a [[Leninism|Leninist]]-style theory of imperialism is the strategic need for workers in the industrialized countries to bloc or ally with the oppressed nations contained within their respective countries' colonies abroad in order to overthrow capitalism. This is the source of the slogan, which shows the Leninist conception that not only the proletariat—as is traditional to Marxism—are the sole revolutionary force, but all oppressed people: "Workers and Oppressed Peoples of the World, Unite!".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.workers.org/2008/us/ww_1982_1120/&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the other distinguishing characteristic of Marxism–Leninism is how it approaches the question of organization. Lenin believed that the traditional model of the [[Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic parties]] of the time, which was a loose, multitendency organization was inadequate for overthrowing the Tsarist regime in Russia. He proposed a cadre of professional revolutionaries that disciplined itself under the model of [[democratic centralism]].

== Maoism ==
[[Maoism]] takes its name from [[Mao Zedong]], the former leader of the People's Republic of China—it is the variety of [[anti-revisionism]] that took inspiration and in some cases received material support from China, especially during the Mao period. There are several key concepts that were developed by Mao. First, Mao concurred with Stalin that not only does class struggle continue under the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], it actually accelerates as long as gains are being made by the [[proletariat]] at the expense of the disenfranchised [[bourgeoisie]]. Second, Mao developed a strategy for [[revolution]] called [[People's war|prolonged people's war]] in what he termed the [[semi-feudal]] countries of the [[Three Worlds Theory|Third World]]. Prolonged People's War relied heavily on the peasantry. Third, Mao wrote many theoretical articles on epistemology and dialectics, which he called [[contradictions]].

=== Hoxhaism ===
[[Hoxhaism]], so named because of the central contribution of Albanian statesman [[Enver Hoxha]], was closely aligned with China for a number of years, but grew critical of Maoism because of the so-called Three Worlds Theory put forth by elements within the [[Communist Party of China]] and because it viewed the actions of Chinese leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] unfavorably. However, Hoxhaism as a trend ultimately came to the understanding that [[socialism]] had never existed in China at all.

== Trotskyism ==
{{main|Trotskyism}}
[[Trotskyism]] is the branch as advocated by Russian Marxist [[Leon Trotsky]], a contemporary of Lenin from the early years of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], where he led a small trend in competition with both Lenin's [[Bolsheviks]] and the [[Mensheviks]]. Trotsky's followers nevertheless claim to be the heirs of Lenin in the same way that mainstream Marxist–Leninists do. There are several distinguishing characteristics of this school of thought—foremost is the theory of [[permanent revolution]]. This stated that in less-developed countries the bourgeoisie were too weak to lead their own "bourgeois-democratic" revolutions. Due to this weakness, it fell to the proletariat to carry out the bourgeois revolution. However, with power in its hands the proletariat would then continue this revolution (permanently), thus transforming it from a bourgeois to a [[Revolutionary socialism|socialist revolutionary]] and from a national to an [[World revolution|international revolution]].

Another shared characteristic between Trotskyists is a variety of theoretical justifications for their negative appraisal of the post-Lenin Soviet Union—that is to say, after Trotsky was expelled by a majority vote from the Communist Party of Soviet Union&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plp.org/books/Stalin/node14.html#SECTION00500000000000000000&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently from the Soviet Union. As a consequence, Trotsky defined the Soviet Union under Stalin as a [[planned economy]] ruled over by a bureaucratic caste. Trotsky advocated overthrowing the government of the Soviet Union after he was expelled from it.&lt;ref&gt;"The characterisation of the anti-bureaucratic revolution as “political revolution” referred to the fact that the bureaucracy had politically expropriated the proletariat ..." http://www.radicalsocialist.in/index.php/articles/marxist-theory/100-capitalist-restoration-in-the-former-soviet-union&lt;/ref&gt;

== Left communism ==
{{main|Left communism}}
[[Left communism]] is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the [[Communist International]] after its first two congresses.

Although she lived before left communism became a distinct tendency, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] has been heavily influential for most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included [[Herman Gorter]], [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Otto Rühle]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Amadeo Bordiga]] and [[Paul Mattick]].

Prominent left communist groups existing today include the [[International Communist Current]] and the [[Internationalist Communist Tendency]]. Different factions from the old Bordigist International Communist Party are also considered left communist organizations.

== Post-Stalin Moscow-aligned communism ==
At the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]] made several ideological ruptures with his predecessor, Joseph Stalin. First, Khrushchev denounced the so-called [[cult of personality]] that had developed around Stalin, which ironically enough Khrushchev had had a pivotal role in fostering decades earlier. However, more importantly Khrushchev rejected the heretofore orthodox Marxist–Leninist tenet that class struggle continues even under socialism. Rather, the state ought to rule in the name of all classes. A related principle that flowed from the former was the notion of [[peaceful coexistence]], or that the newly emergent [[Eastern Bloc|socialist bloc]] could peacefully compete with the [[Western Bloc|capitalist world]], solely by developing the productive forces of society.

=== Anti-revisionism ===
There are many proponents of Marxist–Leninism who rejected the theses of Khrushchev.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} They believed that Khrushchev was unacceptably altering or "revising" the fundamental tenets of Marxism–Leninism, a stance from which the label "anti-revisionist" is derived. Typically, anti-revisionists refer to themselves simply as Marxist–Leninists primarily.

== Western Marxism ==
{{main|Western Marxism}}
[[Western Marxism]] is a broad category of [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theoreticians]] based in Western and Central Europe (and more recently North America), in contrast with [[philosophy in the Soviet Union]], the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], or the [[People's Republic of China]].

=== Key Western Marxists ===
==== Georg Lukács ====
[[György Lukács|Georg Lukács]] (13 April 1885 – 4 June 1971) was a Hungarian Marxist philosopher and [[literary critic]] in the tradition of Western Marxism. His main work, ''History and Class Consciousness'' (written between 1919 and 1922 and first published in 1923), initiated the current of thought that came to be known as Western Marxism. The book is notable for contributing to debates concerning Marxism and its relation to sociology, politics and philosophy, as well as for reconstructing [[Marx's theory of alienation]] before many of the works of the [[young Marx]] had been published. Lukács's work elaborates and expands upon Marxist theories such as [[ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|ideology]], [[false consciousness]], [[reification (Marxism)|reification]] and [[class consciousness]].

==== Karl Korsch ====
[[Karl Korsch]] (15 August 1886 – 21 October 1961) was born in Tostedt, near Hamburg, to the family of a middle-ranking bank official.

In his later work, he rejected [[Orthodox Marxism]] as historically outmoded, wanting to adapt Marxism to a new historical situation. He wrote in his ''Ten Theses'' (1950) that "the first step in re-establishing a revolutionary theory and practice consists in breaking with that Marxism which claims to monopolize revolutionary initiative as well as theoretical and practical direction" and that "today, all attempts to re-establish the Marxist doctrine as a whole in its original function as a theory of the working classes social revolution are reactionary utopias".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/korsch/1950/ten-theses.htm Karl Korsch (1950) Ten Theses on Marxism  Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

Korsch was especially concerned that Marxist theory was losing its precision and validity—in the words of the day, becoming "vulgarized"—within the upper echelons of the various socialist organizations. His masterwork ''Marxism and Philosophy'' is an attempt to re-establish the historic character of Marxism as the heir to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].

==== Antonio Gramsci ====
[[Antonio Gramsci]] (22 January 1891{{spaced ndash}}27 April 1937) was an Italian writer, politician and political theorist. He was a founding member and onetime leader of the [[Communist Party of Italy]]. Gramsci can be seen as one of the most important Marxist thinkers of the twentieth century, in particular a key thinker in the development of Western Marxism. He wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during his imprisonment. These writings, known as the ''Prison Notebooks'', contain Gramsci's tracing of Italian history and nationalism as well as some ideas in Marxist theory, [[critical theory]] and educational theory associated with his name such as:
* [[Cultural hegemony]] as a means of maintaining the [[State (polity)|state]] in a capitalist society
* The need for popular workers' education to encourage development of intellectuals from the working class
* The distinction between [[political society]] (the police, the army, legal system, etc.) which dominates directly and coercively and [[civil society]] (the family, the education system, trade unions, etc.) where leadership is constituted through ideology or by means of consent
* "Absolute [[historicism]]"
* The critique of [[economic determinism]]
* The critique of [[materialism|philosophical materialism]]

==== Herbert Marcuse ====
[[Herbert Marcuse]] (19 July 1898 – 29 July 1979) was a prominent German-American philosopher and sociologist of Jewish descent and a member of the Frankfurt School.

Marcuse's critiques of capitalist society (especially his 1955 synthesis of Marx and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], ''[[Eros and Civilization]]'' and his 1964 book ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'') resonated with the concerns of the leftist student movement in the 1960s. Because of his willingness to speak at student protests, Marcuse soon became known as "the father of the [[New Left]]", a term he disliked and rejected.

==== Jean-Paul Sartre ====
[[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (21 June 1905 – 15 April 1980) was already a key and influential philosopher and playwright for his early writings on [[individualism|individualistic]] [[existentialism]]. In his later career, Sartre attempted to reconcile the existential philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] with Marxist philosophy and Hegelian dialectics in his work ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[plato.stanford.edu/entries/sartre/ Jean-Paul Sartre on Stanford Encyclopedia.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sartre was also involved in Marxist politics and was impressed upon visiting Marxist revolutionary [[Che Guevara]], calling him "not only an intellectual but also the most complete human being of our age".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Jon. ''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. 1997 p.468&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Louis Althusser ====
[[Louis Althusser]] (16 October 1918 – 22 October 1990) was a Marxist philosopher. He was a lifelong member and sometimes strong critic of the [[French Communist Party]]. His arguments and theses were set against the threats that he saw attacking the theoretical foundations of Marxism. These included both the influence of [[empiricism]] on Marxist theory and [[humanism]] and [[Reformism|reformist socialist]] orientations which manifested as divisions in the European Communist parties as well as the problem of the cult of personality and of ideology itself. Althusser is commonly referred to as a structural Marxist, although his relationship to other schools of French [[structuralism]] is not a simple affiliation and he is critical of many aspects of structuralism.

His essay ''Marxism and Humanism'' is a strong statement of anti-humanism in Marxist theory, condemning ideas like "human potential" and "species-being", which are often put forth by Marxists, as outgrowths of a bourgeois ideology of "humanity". His essay ''Contradiction and Overdetermination'' borrows the concept of [[overdetermination]] from [[psychoanalysis]] in order to replace the idea of "contradiction" with a more complex model of multiple [[causality]] in political situations (an idea closely related to Gramsci's concept of [[hegemony]]).

Althusser is also widely known as a theorist of ideology and his best-known essay is ''Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Toward an Investigation''.&lt;ref&gt;''Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses: Notes Toward an Investigation'' is available in several English volumes including ''Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays''&lt;/ref&gt; The essay establishes the concept of ideology, also based on Gramsci's theory of hegemony. Whereas hegemony is ultimately determined entirely by political forces, ideology draws on [[Sigmund Freud|Sigmund Freud's]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Jacques Lacan's]] concepts of the unconscious and mirror-phase respectively and describes the structures and systems that allow us to meaningfully have a concept of the self.

==== Christopher Hill, Eric Hobsbawm and E. P. Thompson ====
British Marxism deviated sharply from French (especially Althusserian) Marxism and like the Frankfurt School developed an attention to cultural experience and an emphasis on human agency while growing increasingly distant from determinist views of materialism. A circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] formed the [[Communist Party Historians Group]] in 1946. They shared a common interest in "history from below" and class structure in early capitalist society. Important members of the group included [[E. P. Thompson]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[Raphael Samuel]].

While some members of the group (most notably Thompson) left the party after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed a great emphasis on the subjective determination of history. Thompson famously engaged Althusser in ''The Poverty of Theory'',&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, E. P., (1978). ''The Poverty of Theory &amp; other essays'' Merlin, 1978. {{ISBN|0-85036-231-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that Althusser's theory overdetermined history and left no space for historical revolt by the oppressed.

=== Structural Marxism ===
{{main|Structural Marxism}}
[[Structural Marxism]] is an approach to Marxism based on structuralism, primarily associated with the work of the French theorist Louis Althusser and his students. It was influential in France during the late 1960s and 1970s and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and sociologists outside France during the 1970s.

=== Neo-Marxism ===
{{main|Neo-Marxism}}
[[Neo-Marxism]] is a school of Marxism that began in the 20th century and hearkened back to the early writings of Marx before the influence of [[Friedrich Engels]], which focused on dialectical idealism rather than [[dialectical materialism]]. It thus rejected economic determinism, being instead far more [[libertarian socialism|libertarian]]. Neo-Marxism adds [[Max Weber]]'s broader understanding of [[social inequality]], such as [[Social status|status]] and [[Power (sociology)|power]], to orthodox Marxist thought.

=== The Frankfurt School ===
{{main|Frankfurt School}}
{{Frankfurt School}}
The [[Frankfurt School]] is a school of neo-Marxist social theory, social research and philosophy. The grouping emerged at the [[Institute for Social Research]] (''Institut für Sozialforschung'') of the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt am Main]] in Germany. The term "Frankfurt School" is an informal term used to designate the thinkers affiliated with the Institute for Social Research or influenced by them—it is not the title of any institution and the main thinkers of the Frankfurt School did not use the term to refer to themselves.

The Frankfurt School gathered together dissident Marxists, severe critics of capitalism who believed that some of Marx's alleged followers had come to parrot a narrow selection of Marx's ideas, usually in defense of orthodox communist or social democratic parties. Influenced especially by the failure of working-class revolutions in Western Europe after [[World War I]] and by the rise of [[Nazism]] in an economically, technologically and culturally advanced nation (Germany), they took up the task of choosing what parts of Marx's thought might serve to clarify social conditions which Marx himself had never seen. They drew on other schools of thought to fill in Marx's perceived omissions.

Max Weber exerted a major influence, as did Sigmund Freud (as in [[Herbert Marcuse]]'s [[Freudo-Marxism|Freudo-Marxist]] synthesis in the 1954 work ''Eros and Civilization''). Their emphasis on the "critical" component of theory was derived significantly from their attempt to overcome the limits of [[positivism]], crude materialism and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] by returning to [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[critical philosophy]] and its successors in German [[idealism]], principally Hegel's philosophy, with its emphasis on [[negation]] and [[contradiction]] as inherent properties of reality.

=== Autonomist Marxism ===
{{main|Autonomism}}
[[Autonomism]] is a category of Marxist social movements around the world that emphasize the ability to organize in autonomous and horizontal networks, as opposed to hierarchical structures such as unions or parties.  Autonomist Marxists, including [[Harry Cleaver]], broaden the definition of the working-class to include salaried and unpaid labour, such as skilled professions and housework—it focuses on the working class in advanced capitalist states as the primary force of change in the construct of capital. Modern autonomist theorists such as [[Antonio Negri]] and [[Michael Hardt]] argue that network power constructs are the most effective methods of organization against the neoliberal regime of accumulation and predict a massive shift in the dynamics of capital into a [[Empire (Hardt and Negri book)|21st century empire]].

=== Analytical Marxism ===
{{main|Analytical Marxism}}
[[Analytical Marxism]] refers to a style of thinking about Marxism that was prominent amongst a half-dozen [[Analytic philosophy|analytically trained]] English-speaking philosophers and social scientists during the 1980s. It was mainly associated with the [[September Group]] of academics, so called because they have biennial meetings in varying locations every other September to discuss common interests. The group also dubbed itself "Non-Bullshit Marxism" (Cohen 2000a). In the words of [[David Miller (political theorist)|David Miller]], it was characterized by "clear and rigorous thinking about questions that are usually blanketed by ideological fog". (Miller 1994)

=== Marxist humanism ===
{{main|Marxist humanism}}
[[Marxist humanism]] is a branch of Marxism that primarily focuses on Marx's earlier writings, especially the ''[[Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844]]'' in which Marx develops his theory of alienation, as opposed to his later works, which are considered to be concerned more with his structural conception of capitalist society. It was opposed by Louis Althusser's "[[antihumanism]]", who qualified it as a revisionist movement.

Marxist humanists contend that Marxism developed lopsided because Marx's early works were unknown until after the orthodox ideas were in vogue—the ''Manuscripts of 1844'' were published only in 1932—and it is necessary to understand Marx's philosophical foundations to understand his latter works properly.

=== Marxist theology ===
{{see also|Religious communism|Religious socialism|Christian left|Black theology}}
Although Marx was intensely critical of institutionalized [[religion]] including [[Christianity]], some Christians have "accepted the basic premises of Marxism and attempted to reinterpret Christian faith from this perspective".&lt;ref&gt;"Marxist Theology" in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PN7UMUTBBPAC The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Theology]'', p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the resulting examples are some forms of [[liberation theology]] and [[black theology]]. [[Pope Benedict XVI]] strongly opposed radical liberation theology while he was still a cardinal, with the Vatican [[Spe Salvi|condemning]] acceptance of Marxism. Black theologian [[James H. Cone]] wrote in his book ''For My People'' that "for analyzing the structure of capitalism. Marxism as a tool of social analysis can disclose the gap between appearance and reality, and thereby help Christians to see how things really are".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acton.org/commentary/443_marxist_roots_of_black_liberation_theology.php] Marxist Roots of Black Liberation Theology{{unreliable source?|date=May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marxism–Deleonism ==
Marxism–Deleonism is a form of syndicalist Marxism developed by [[Daniel De Leon]]. De Leon was an early leader of the first United States socialist political party, the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]], which exists to the present day. [[De Leonism]] lies outside the Leninist tradition of communism. The highly decentralized and democratic nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the democratic centralism of Marxism–Leninism and what they see as the dictatorial nature of the Soviet Union. The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls, in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small [[Vanguardism|vanguard party]] should lead the working class to carry out the revolution. De Leon and other De Leonist writers have issued frequent polemics against [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] movements—especially the [[Socialist Party of America]]—and consider them to be "reformist" or "[[Bourgeois socialism|bourgeois socialist]]". De Leonists have traditionally refrained from any activity or alliances viewed by them as trying to reform capitalism, though the Socialist Labor Party in De Leon's time was active during strikes and such, like [[Social justice#Social justice movements|social justice movements]].

== Eurocommunism ==
Beginning around the 1970s, various communist parties in Western Europe, such as the [[Italian Communist Party]] in Italy and the [[Communist Party of Spain]] under [[Santiago Carrillo]] tried to hew to a more independent line from Moscow. Particularly in Italy, they leaned on the theories of Antonio Gramsci. This trend went by the name [[Eurocommunism]].

== Post-Marxism ==
{{main|Post-Marxism}}
[[Post-Marxism]] represents the theoretical work of philosophers and social theorists who have built their theories upon those of Marx and Marxists, but exceeded the limits of those theories in ways that puts them outside of Marxism. It begins with the basic tenets of Marxism, but moves away from the mode of production as the starting point for analysis and includes factors other than class, such as gender, ethnicity etc. and a reflexive relationship between the base and superstructure.

Marxism remains a powerful theory in some unexpected and relatively obscure places and is not always properly labeled as "Marxism". For example, many Mexican and some American archaeologists still employ a Marxist model to explain the [[Classic Maya collapse]]{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} (c. 900 A.D.) – without mentioning Marxism by name.

== Marxist feminism ==
{{main|Marxist feminism}}
[[Marxist feminism]] is a sub-type of [[feminism|feminist]] theory which focuses on the dismantling of capitalism as a way to liberate women. Marxist feminism states that [[private property]], which gives rise to [[economic inequality]] as well as dependence, political confusion and ultimately unhealthy social relations between men and women, is the root of women's oppression.

According to Marxist theory, in capitalist societies the individual is shaped by class relations—that is people's capacities, needs and interests are seen to be determined by the mode of production that characterises the society they inhabit. Marxist feminists see [[gender inequality]] as determined ultimately by the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]. Gender oppression is [[Oppression#Class oppression|class oppression]] and women's subordination is seen as a form of class oppression which is maintained (like [[racism]]) because it serves the interests of capital and the [[ruling class]]. Marxist feminists have extended traditional Marxist analysis by looking at [[Domestic worker|domestic labour]] as well as [[Wage slavery|wage work]] in order to support their position.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18979">'''Medical Neutrality''' refers to a principle of noninterference with medical services in times of armed conflict and civil unrest: [[physicians]] must be allowed to care for the sick and wounded, and soldiers must receive care regardless of their political affiliations; all parties must refrain from attacking and misusing medical facilities, transport, and personnel. Concepts comprising the principles of medical neutrality derive from [[international human rights law]], [[medical ethics]] and [[humanitarian law]].  Medical neutrality may be thought of as a kind of social contract that obligates societies to protect medical personnel in both times of war and peace, and obligates medical personnel to treat all individuals regardless of religion, race, ethnicity, or political affiliation.  Violations of medical neutrality constitute crimes outlined in the [[Geneva Conventions]].

==Historical Background==
The principle of medical neutrality has roots in many social traditions. 
*The Hippocratic Oath, which requires physicians to practice medicine ethically, dates back to the fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Edelstein. ''The Hippocratic oath: text, translation and interpretation''. Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996, p.56.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The idea of ‘do no harm’ has histories in “Jewish and Islamic, as well as Chinese and Indian medicine”&lt;ref&gt;Sheila McLean, ''First Do No Harm: Law, Ethics, and Healthcare'', at 83 (Ashgate Publishing, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Geneva Conventions]] (the core of international humanitarian law, supported and protected by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]):
**The [[First Geneva Convention]] was written by Henri Dunant in response to seeing such the difficulty of treating wounded soldiers at the Battle of Solferino.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sperry | first = C.S. | title = The Revision of the Geneva Convention, 1906 | journal = Proceedings of the American Political Science Association | year = 1906 |volume = 3 | page= 33}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
**The first and the following [[Geneva Conventions]] created the [[Red Cross]], outline the protections of medical personnel in times of war, codify the protections of citizens, soldiers, medical personnel, etc. 
**The [[First Geneva Convention]] states that there should be no “obstacle to the humanitarian activities”  and that wounded and sick “shall be respected and protected in all circumstances.”&lt;ref name="Convention I"&gt;”Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field. Geneva, 12 August 1949.” International Committee of the Red Cross. http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/FULL/365?OpenDocument. Retrieved February 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
**Article 19 demands that medical units, i.e. hospitals and mobile medical facilities, may in no circumstances be attacked.&lt;ref&gt;”Article 19, First Geneva Convention.” Library of Congress. https://www.loc.gov/rr/frd/Military_Law/pdf/GC_1949-I.pdf. Retrieved February 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
**The [[Declaration of Geneva]] was created as an amendment to the Hippocratic Oath in 1948, a response to the human experimentation on Nazi prisoners.

==Violations of Medical Neutrality==
Medical neutrality is violated when health care professionals, facilities, or patients come under attack, or when medical professionals are not allowed to provide treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Physicians for Human Rights. "The Principle of Medical Neutrality." http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/library/multimedia/principle-of-medical-neutrality.html. Retrieved February 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include:&lt;ref name="Convention I"/&gt;
*Attacks on hospitals
*Attacks on patients
*Attacks on medical personnel
*Attacks on medical transport
*Misuse of medical facilities
*Breaches of medical ethics by medical personnel
*Using the hospital/Medical facilities in order to attack, fire/ fire rockets e.j., to civilians from the medical facilities
*Using the medical facilities in order to house weapons or soldiers
*Using the medical facilities for purposes other than medical assistance and/or aid to the public

==Recorded Historical Violations of Medical Neutrality==

===Afghanistan (2015)===
On 3 October 2015, U.S. airstrikes killed 42 people and destroyed the MSF (Médecins Sans Frontières - Doctors Without Borders) trauma hospital in Kunduz, Afghanistan (See [[Kunduz hospital airstrike|main article]]). Many patients in the hospital burned alive in their beds as a US AC-130 gunship made multiple passes firing upon the hospital from overhead. MSF's request for an independent inquiry was never honoured. The U.S. military investigated itself, eventually taking disciplinary action against a dozen servicemembers. No criminal prosecutions followed. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msf.org/en/article/one-year-after-kunduz-battlefields-without-doctors-wars-without-limits "One year after Kunduz: Battlefields without doctors, in wars without limits"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/29/kunduz-hospital-attack-msf-us-military-charges "Kunduz hospital attack: MSF's questions remain as US military seeks no charges"], ''The Guardian'', 29 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahrain===
The Bahraini government’s crackdown on the [[Bahraini uprising (2011–present)|Bahrain uprising]] in 2011 and 2012 included extensive violations of medical neutrality. An investigative report released by [[Physicians for Human Rights]] revealed that many doctors were attacked or incarcerated. Furthermore, Bahraini security forces have seized control of medical facilities, prevented patients from receiving treatment, misused ambulance services, and violently interrogated wounded patients.&lt;ref&gt;Physicians for Human Rights, Do No Harm: A Call for Bahrain to End Systematic Attacks on Doctors and Patients, http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/issues/persecution-of-health-workers/bahrain/&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2011, 20 medical workers in Bahrain were [[Bahrain health worker trials|sentenced]] to up to 15 years in prison for treating protesters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/world/middleeast/bahrain-court-hands-down-harsh-sentences-to-doctors-and-protesters.html?_r=2&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;src=ig "Bahrain Court Hands Down Harsh Sentences to Doctors and Protesters"]. ''[[New York Times]]''. Retrieved February 14, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These sentences were immediately condemned by [[United Nations]] secretary general [[Ban Ki-Moon]] and human rights groups such as [[Physicians for Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;Press Release, Physicians for Human Rights, "PHR Denounces Sentences Passed on Bahraini Medics and Protestors", (September 2011) http://physiciansforhumanrights.org/press/press-releases/phr-denounces-sentences-on-bahraini-medics.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Apparently in response to international pressure, the Bahrain government ordered that the doctors be retried in civilian court, but the verdict has yet to be decided.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/world/middleeast/bahrain-orders-retrials-for-medical-workers.html?_r=3&amp;hpw "Bahrain Orders Retrials for Medical Workers"], ''The New York Times'', October 5, 2011,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chechnya (1996)===
During the Battle of Grozny in 1996 during the [[First Chechen War]], several hospitals were attacked.  Municipal Hospital No. 9 was invaded by Russian soldiers and approximately 500 civilians were taken hostage.&lt;ref&gt;Memorial. “Occupation of Municipal Hospital No. 9.” http://www.memo.ru/hr/hotpoints/chechen/szczyt/eng/Chapter7.htm. Retrieved February 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[ICRC Hospital of Novye Atagi]], which was created to symbolize medical neutrality in the war-torn area, was attacked and six members of the ICRC staff were killed.&lt;ref&gt;ICRC. “17 December 1996: Six ICRC delegates assassinated in Chechnya.” https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/article/other/57jnj3.htm. Retrieved February 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt (2011)===
In 2011, during political unrest, state security forces directly attacked protestors and field clinics, injuring and killing numerous people.  A state security officer even dressed himself as a doctor and administered fatal shots to those injured in a field clinic outside of Tahrir Square.{{Failed verification|date=March 2017}}&lt;ref name= Tahrir&gt;Amani Massoud, A brief history of field hospitals in Tahrir Square, AlMasry Alyoum, November 27, 2011, http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/521861.&lt;/ref&gt; Medical supplies were confiscated by “military officers and field hospital tents were burned down during a Tahrir raid.”&lt;ref name= Tahrir /&gt;

===El Salvador (1980-1992)===
In the [[Salvadoran Civil War]], many field clinics were attacked by guerillas. Patients were commonly abducted from hospitals, and government forces greatly limited the movements of health workers. Medical transports were also attacked, in some cases resulting in the deaths of medical workers.&lt;ref&gt;Physicians for Human Rights. “El Salvador: Health Care Under Siege”. https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/el-salvador-health-care-under-siege.pdf.

===Iran (2008-2011)===
In June 2008, Iranian authorities detained [[Kamiar and Arash Alaei incident|Dr. Arash Alaei and Dr. Kamiar Alaei]], two well-known Iranian physicians and leaders in the fight against HIV/AIDS. The physicians, who are brothers, were held in Tehran’s notorious [[Evin prison]] for over six months without being charged or tried.  On December 31, 2008, a one-day, closed-door trial was held, in which the brothers were tried as conspirators working with an “enemy government” to overthrow the government of Iran. They were also tried at that time on unspecified other charges which neither they nor their lawyer were allowed to know, see the evidence of, or address.&lt;ref&gt;Iran Free the Docs. “Background.” http://iranfreethedocs.org/background/.

===Libya (2011)===
During the 2011 [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]], human rights groups documented violations of medical neutrality along with many other gross violations of human rights. [[Physicians for Human Rights]] conducted investigations within Libya in 2011, and found that the military had attacked and destroyed hospitals. Several eyewitnesses reported that [[Gaddafi]] forces attacked ambulances carrying injured combatants, despite the fact that the ambulances were marked with the emblematic [[Red Crescent]]. Medical personnel were kidnapped by Gaddafi’s forces,  and military forces used people as human shields.&lt;ref&gt;MSNBC. “Report: Gadhafi forces perched children on tanks to deter NATO attacks”. http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/44323971/ns/today-today_news/t/report-gadhafi-forces-perched-children-tanks-deter-nato-attacks/.

===Mozambique (1977-1992)===
During the [[Mozambican Civil War]], the resistance group [[RENAMO]] was responsible for many [[Mozambican Civil War#War crimes and crimes against humanity|violations]] of medical neutrality.  Attacks on hospitals and health clinics were common. In one instance, RENAMO soldiers raided the town of Homoine, killing 442 civilians including hospitalized patients.&lt;ref&gt;Mozambique History Net. “The Massacre at Homoine on Saturday, 18 July 1987”. http://www.mozambiquehistory.net/homoine.html.

===Panama (1988)===
Civil unrest and demonstrations began in Panama in June 1987. During the unrest, human rights groups such as [[Physicians for Human Rights]] documented a variety of human rights abuses and violations of medical neutrality. The military blocked access to hospitals and interfered with provision of medical care, took control of ambulance services for military purposes, and interrogated wounded patients.  In addition, Panamanian physicians were kidnapped, beaten, and tortured for speaking out against government policies which prevented them from providing their patients with adequate care.&lt;ref&gt;Physicians for Human Rights. “Panama 1987: Health Consequences of Police and Military Actions.” https://s3.amazonaws.com/PHR_Reports/panama-1987-health-cons.pdf.

===Sri Lanka (2009)===
Sri Lanka’s lengthy [[Sri Lankan civil war|civil war]] was marked by extensive human rights abuses.

===Thailand (1992)===
A year after a bloodless military coup in Bangkok in February 1991, the new government responded to the pro-democracy movement opening fire on a May opposition rally, resulting in 52 deaths, hundreds of injured, and many disappearances.

==Medical Neutrality Protection Act of 2011 (H.R. 2643)==
The Medical Neutrality Protection Act of 2011, (H.R. 2643),  is a bipartisan bill introduced by Representatives [[Jim McDermott]] (D-WA), and [[Walter B.

Retrieved February 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The bill calls for the creation of the position of a [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on the Protection and Promotion of Medical Neutrality and calls for investigations of violations of medical neutrality.  It also limits military aid from the USA to countries that have engaged in violating medical neutrality, and as well bans their government officials from attaining visas to the United States.&lt;ref name="Neutrality bill"&gt;U.S. Government Printing Office, “H.R. 2643”, http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr2643ih/pdf/BILLS-112hr2643ih.pdf.

The '''natural Earth projection''' is a [[Map projection#Pseudocylindrical|pseudocylindrical]] [[map projection]] designed by [[Tom Patterson (cartographer)|Tom Patterson]] and introduced in 2012. It is neither [[Map_projection#Conformal|conformal]] nor [[Map_projection#Equal-area|equal-area]].

==Definition==
The natural Earth is defined by the following formulas:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align} x &amp;= 0.8707 \times l(\varphi) \times \lambda, \\
y &amp;= 0.8707 \times 0.52 \times d(\varphi) \times \pi, \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;,

where
* ''x'', ''y'' are the Cartesian coordinates;
* ''λ'' is the longitude from the central meridian;
* ''φ'' is the latitude;
* ''l''(''φ'') is the length of the parallel at latitude ''φ'';
* ''d''(''φ'') is the distance of the parallel from the equator at latitude ''φ''.

''l''(''φ'') and ''d''(''φ'') are given as polynomials&lt;!-- Here comes the messy part: the polynomials used in the code are pre-multiplied with 0.8707. --&gt;, initially from [[interpolation]] of the following values in Flex Projector&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shadedrelief.com/NE_proj/index.html|title=Natural Earth Projection: Home|last=|first=|date=|website=www.shadedrelief.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407111351/http://www.shadedrelief.com/NE_proj/index.html|archive-date=2012-04-07|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-02-12|quote=It was originally designed in Flex Projector using graphical methods and now exists as a polynomial version.}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

'''New Age''' is a term applied to a range of [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[religion|religious]] beliefs and practices that developed in [[Western culture|Western nations]] during the 1970s. Precise scholarly definitions of the New Age differ in their emphasis, largely as a result of its highly [[eclecticism|eclectic]] structure. Although analytically often considered to be religious, those involved in it typically prefer the designation of '''spiritual''' or '''Mind, Body, Spirit''' and rarely use the term "New Age" themselves. Many scholars of the subject refer to it as the '''New Age movement''', although others contest this term and suggest that it is better seen as a [[milieu]] or [[zeitgeist]].

&lt;!--History of the New Age--&gt;
As a form of [[Western esotericism]], the New Age drew heavily upon a number of older esoteric traditions, in particular those that emerged from the occultist current that developed in the eighteenth century. Such prominent occult influences include the work of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and [[Franz Mesmer]], as well as the ideas of [[Spiritualism]], [[New Thought]], and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. A number of mid-twentieth century influences, such as the [[UFO religions]] of the 1950s, the [[Counterculture of the 1960s]], and the [[Human Potential Movement]], also exerted a strong influence on the early development of the New Age. The exact origins of the phenomenon remain contested, but there is general agreement that it developed in the 1970s, at which time it was centred largely in the United Kingdom. It expanded and grew largely in the 1980s and 1990s, in particular within the United States. By the start of the 21st century, the term "New Age" was increasingly rejected within this milieu, with some scholars arguing that the New Age phenomenon had ended.  

&lt;!--Core Beliefs--&gt;
Despite its highly eclectic nature, a number of beliefs commonly found within the New Age have been identified. [[Theology|Theologically]], the New Age typically adopts a belief in a [[Holism|holistic]] form of divinity that imbues all of the universe, including human beings themselves. There is thus a strong emphasis on the spiritual authority of the self. This is accompanied by a common belief in a wide variety of semi-divine non-human entities, such as [[angel]]s and [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom|masters]], with whom humans can communicate, particularly through the form of [[Mediumship#Channeling|channeling]]. Typically viewing human history as being divided into a series of distinct ages, a common New Age belief is that whereas once humanity lived in an age of great technological advancement and spiritual wisdom, it has entered a period of spiritual degeneracy, which will be remedied through the establishment of a coming [[Age of Aquarius]], from which the milieu gets its name. There is also a strong focus on healing, particularly using forms of [[alternative medicine]], and an emphasis on a New Age "science" that seeks to unite science and spirituality.

&lt;!--Sociological factors--&gt;
Centred primarily in Western countries, those involved in the New Age have been primarily from middle and upper-middle-class backgrounds. The degree to which New Agers are involved in the milieu varied considerably, from those who adopted a number of New Age ideas and practices to those who fully embraced and dedicated their lives to it. The New Age has generated criticism from established Christian organisations as well as [[Modern Paganism|modern Pagan]] and [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous communities]]. From the 1990s onward, the New Age became the subject of research by academic scholars of [[religious studies]].

==Definitions==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="One of the few things on which all scholars agree concerning New Age is that it is difficult to define. Often, the definition given actually reflects the background of the scholar giving the definition. Thus, the New Ager views New Age as a revolutionary period of history dictated by the stars; the Christian apologist has often defined new age as a cult; the historian of ideas understands it as a manifestation of the perennial tradition; the philosopher sees New Age as a monistic or holistic worldview; the sociologist describes New Age as a new religious movement (NRM); while the psychologist describes it as a form of narcissism."|source=— Scholar of religion Daren Kemp, 2004.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=1}} }}

The New Age phenomenon has proved difficult to define,{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=2001|1p=363|2a1=Kemp|2y=2004|2p=1|3a1=Granholm|3y=2013|3p=59}} with much scholarly disagreement as to its scope.{{sfn|Granholm|2013|p=59}} The scholars Steven J. Sutcliffe and Ingvild Sælid Gilhus have even suggested that it remains "among the most disputed of categories in the study of religion".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=1}}

The scholar of religion [[Paul Heelas]] characterised the New Age as "...an eclectic hotch-potch of beliefs, practices, and ways of life" that can be identified as a singular phenomenon through their use of "...the same (or very similar) ''[[lingua franca]]'' to do with the human (and planetary) condition and how it can be [[Spiritual transformation| transformed]]."{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=1–2}} Similarly, the historian of religion [[Olav Hammer]] termed it "a common denominator for a variety of quite divergent contemporary popular practices and beliefs" that have emerged since the late 1970s and are "largely united by historical links, a shared discourse and an ''air de famille''".{{sfn|Hammer|2006|p=855}} According to Hammer, this New Age was a "fluid and fuzzy [[cult]]ic milieu".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=14}} The [[Sociology of religion|sociologist of religion]] [[Michael York (religious studies scholar)|Michael York]] described the New Age as "...an umbrella term that includes a great variety of groups and identities" that are united by their "...expectation of a major and universal change being primarily founded on the individual and collective development of human potential."{{sfn|York|1995|pp=1–2}}

The scholar of religion [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] adopted a different approach by asserting that "New Age" was "a ''label'' attached indiscriminately to whatever seems to fit it" and that as a result it "means very different things to different people".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=1}} He thus argued against the idea that the New Age could be considered "a unified ideology or ''[[World view|Weltanschauung]]''",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=515}} although he believed that it could be considered a "more or less unified 'movement'."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=522}} Conversely, various other scholars have suggested that the New Age is insufficiently homogenous to be regarded as a singular ''movement''.{{sfnm|1a1=Bruce|1y=1998|1p=24|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=9|3a1= Chryssides|3y=2007|3p=22}} As a replacement term, the sociologist of religion Steven Bruce suggested that New Age was better seen as a [[milieu]],{{sfn|Bruce|1998|p=24}} while scholar of religion [[George D. Chryssides]] suggested that it could be understood as "a counter-cultural ''Zeitgeist''".{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=22}}

There is no central authority within the New Age phenomenon that can determine what counts as New Age and what does not.{{sfn|York|2001|p=364}}
Many of those groups and individuals who could analytically be categorised as part of the New Age reject the term "New Age" in reference to themselves.{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1992|1pp=1–2|2a1= Heelas|2y=1996|2p=17|3a1=York|3y=2001|3p=364|4a1= Sutcliffe|4y=2003a|4p=200|5a1=Partridge|5y=2004|5p=2|6a1=MacKian|6y=2012|6p=5}} Some even express active hostility to the term.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=177}} Rather than terming themselves "New Agers", those involved in this milieu commonly describe themselves as spiritual "seekers",{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=200}} and some self-identify as a member of a different religious group, such as Christianity, Judaism, or Buddhism.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=25}} In 2003 Sutcliffe observed that the use of the term "New Age" was "optional, episodic and declining overall", adding that among the very few individuals who did use it, they usually did so with qualification, for instance by placing it in quotation marks.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=197}} Other academics, such as Sara MacKian, have argued that the sheer diversity of the New Age renders the term too problematic for scholars to use.{{sfnm|1a1=Chryssides|1y=2007|1p=10|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=7}} MacKian proposed "everyday spirituality" as an alternate term.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=12}}

While acknowledging that "New Age" was a problematic term, the scholar of religion  [[James R. Lewis (scholar)|James R. Lewis]] stated that it remained a useful [[etic]] category for scholars to use because, "There exists no comparable term which covers all aspects of the movement."{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=2}} Similarly, Chryssides argued that the fact that "New Age" is a "theoretical concept" does not "undermine its usefulness or employability"; he drew comparisons with "[[Hinduism]]", a similar "western etic piece of vocabulary" that scholars of religion used despite its problems.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=13}}

===Religion, spirituality, and esotericism===

In discussing the New Age, academics have varyingly referred to "New Age spirituality" and "New Age religion".{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=1}} Those involved in the New Age rarely consider it to be "religion"—negatively associating that term solely with [[organized religion]]—and instead describe their practices as "spirituality".{{sfnm|1a1=Sutcliffe|1y=2003a|1pp=214–215|2a1= Partridge|2y=2004|2p=48}} Religious studies scholars, however, have repeatedly referred to the New Age milieu as a "religion".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=243|2a1= Partridge|2y=2004|2p=38}} York described the New Age as a [[new religious movement]] (NRM).{{sfn|York|1995|p=2}} Conversely, both Heelas and Sutcliffe rejected this categorisation;{{sfnm|1a1= Heelas|1y=1996|1p=9|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=200}} Heelas believed that while elements of the New Age represented NRMs, this did not apply to every New Age group.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=9}} Similarly, Chryssides stated that the New Age could not be seen as "a religion" in itself.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=19}}

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|quote="The New Age movement is the cultic milieu having become conscious of itself, in the later 1970s, as constituting a more or less unified "movement". All manifestations of this movement are characterized by a popular western culture criticism expressed in terms of a secularized esotericism."|source=— Scholar of esotericism Wouter Hanegraaff, 1996.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=522}} }}

The New Age is also a form of [[Western esotericism]].{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1p=33|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=400|3a1=Hammer|3y=2001|3p=9}} Hanegraaff regarded the New Age as a form of "popular culture criticism", in that it represented a reaction against the dominant Western values of [[Judeo-Christian]] religion and rationalism,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=331}} adding that "New Age religion formulates such criticism not at random, but falls back on" the ideas of earlier Western esoteric groups.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=515}}

The New Age has also been identified by various scholars of religion as part of the [[cultic milieu]].{{sfnm|1a1= Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=522|2a1= Hammer|2y=2001|2p=28|3a1= Chryssides|3y=2007|3p=17}} This concept, developed by the sociologist [[Colin Campbell (sociologist)|Colin Campbell]], refers to a social network of marginalised ideas. Through their shared marginalisation within a given society, these disparate ideas interact and create new syntheses.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|pp=28–29}}

Hammer identified much of the New Age as corresponding to the concept of "[[folk religions]]" in that it seeks to deal with [[existential]] questions regarding subjects like death and disease in "an unsystematic fashion, often through a process of [[bricolage]] from already available narratives and rituals".{{sfn|Hammer|2006|p=855}} York also heuristically divides the New Age into three broad trends. The first, the ''social camp'', represents groups that primarily seek to bring about social change, while the second, the ''occult camp'', instead focus on contact with spirit entities and channeling. York's third group, the ''spiritual camp'', represents a middle ground between these two camps that focuses largely on [[self-development | individual development]].{{sfn|York|1995|pp=36–37}}

===Terminology===

The term ''new age'', along with related terms like ''new era'' and ''new world'', long predate the emergence of the New Age movement, and have widely been used to assert that a better way of life for humanity is dawning.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=15}} It occurs commonly, for instance, in political contexts; the [[Great Seal of the United States]], designed in 1782, proclaims a "new order of ages", while in the 1980s the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] proclaimed that "all mankind is entering a new age".{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=15}} The term has also appeared within Western esoteric schools of thought, having a scattered use from the mid-nineteenth century onward.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=25}}  In 1864 the American [[Swedenborgian]] [[Warren Felt Evans]] published ''The New Age and its Message'', while in 1907 [[Alfred Orage]] and [[Holbrook Jackson]] began editing a weekly journal of [[Liberal Christianity|Christian liberalism]] and [[socialism]] titled ''[[The New Age]]''.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=17}} The concept of a coming "new age" that would be inaugurated by the [[Second Coming | return to Earth]] of [[Jesus Christ]] was a theme in the poetry of [[Wellesley Tudor Pole]] and [[Johanna Brandt]],{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=26}} and then also appeared in the work of the American Theosophist [[Alice Bailey]], who used the term prominently in such titles as ''Disciplineship in the New Age'' (1944) and ''Education in the New Age'' (1954).{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=26}}

Between the 1930s and 1960s a small number of groups and individuals became preoccupied with the concept of a coming "New Age" and prominently used the term accordingly.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=55}} The term had thus become a recurring motif in the esoteric spirituality milieu.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=99}}
Sutcliffe therefore expressed the view that while the term "New Age" had originally been an "apocalyptic emblem", it would only be later that it became "a tag or codeword for a 'spiritual' idiom".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=29}}

==History==

===Antecedents===
{{double image|right|Helena Petrovna Blavatsky.jpg|141|CGJung.jpg|140|Prominent esoteric thinkers who influenced the New Age include [[Helena Blavatsky]] (left) and [[Carl Jung]] (right)}}

According to scholar [[Nevill Drury]], the New Age has a "tangible history",{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=10}} although Hanegraaff expressed the view that most New Agers were "surprisingly ignorant about the actual historical roots of their beliefs".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=323}} Similarly, Hammer thought that "source amnesia" was a "building block of a New Age worldview", with New Agers typically adopting ideas with no awareness of where those ideas originated.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=180}}

As a form of Western esotericism,{{sfn|York|1995|p=33}} the New Age has antecedents that stretch back to southern Europe in [[Late Antiquity]].{{sfn|Ellwood|1992|p=59}} Following the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in 18th century Europe, new esoteric ideas developed in response to the development of scientific rationality. Scholars call this new esoteric trend ''[[occultism]]'', and this occultism was a key factor in the development of the worldview from which the New Age emerged.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=406–407}}

One of the earliest influences on the New Age was the Swedish 18th century [[Christian mysticism|Christian mystic]] [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], who professed the ability to communicate with angels, demons, and spirits. Swedenborg's attempt to unite science and religion and his prediction of a coming era in particular have been cited as ways that he prefigured the New Age.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=31|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=424–429|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=42}} Another early influence was the late 18th and early 19th century German physician and [[hypnotist]] [[Franz Mesmer]], who claimed the existence of a force known as "[[animal magnetism]]" running through the human body.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=31|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=430–435|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=41}} The establishment of [[Spiritualism]], an occult religion influenced by both Swedenborgianism and Mesmerism, in the U.S. during the 1840s has also been identified as a precursor to the New Age, in particular through its rejection of established Christianity, its claims to representing a scientific approach to religion, and its emphasis on channeling spirit entities.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=435|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=24|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=37}}

A further major influence on the New Age was the [[Theosophical Society]], an occult group co-founded by the Russian [[Helena Blavatsky]] in the late 19th century. In her books ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' (1877) and ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' (1888), Blavatsky claimed that her Society was conveying the essence of all world religions, and it thus emphasized a focus on [[comparative religion]].{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=31|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=448–455|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=24|4a1=Kemp|4y=2004|4p=39}} Serving as a partial bridge between Theosophical ideas and those of the New Age was the American esotericist [[Edgar Cayce]], who founded the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]].{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1p=60|2a1=Hammer|2y=2001|2p=66}} Another influence was [[New Thought]], which developed in late nineteenth century [[New England]] as a Christian-oriented healing movement before spreading throughout the United States.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1p=35|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=455–462|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=38}} Another prominent influence was the psychologist [[Carl Jung]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=46–47|2a1=Hammer|2y=2001|2pp=69–70}} 
Drury also identified as an important influence upon the New Age the Indian [[Swami Vivekananda]], an adherent of the philosophy of [[Vedanta]] who first brought Hinduism to the West in the late 19th century.{{sfn|Drury|2004|pp=27–28}}

Hanegraaff believed that the New Age's direct antecedents could be found in the [[UFO religion]]s of the 1950s, which he termed a "proto-New Age movement".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=95–96}} Many of these new religious movements had strong apocalyptic beliefs regarding a coming new age, which they typically asserted would be brought about by contact with extraterrestrials.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1pp=95–96|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=72}} Examples of such groups included the [[Aetherius Society]], founded in the UK in 1955, and the [[Heralds of the New Age]], established in New Zealand in 1956.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=72, 74}}

=== 1960s ===
From a historical perspective, the New Age phenomenon is rooted in the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=11|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=15}} Although not common throughout the counterculture, usage of the terms "New Age" and "Age of Aquarius" – used in reference to a coming era – were found within it,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=108–109}} for instance appearing on adverts for the [[Woodstock]] festival of 1969,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=109}} and in the lyrics of "[[Aquarius (song)|Aquarius]]", the opening song of the 1967 musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair: The American Tribal Love-Rock Musical]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=10|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=109|3a1=Sutcliffe|3a2=Gilhus|3y=2013|3p=4}}
This decade also witnessed the emergence of a variety of new religious movements and newly established religions in the United States, creating a spiritual milieu from which the New Age drew upon; these included the [[San Francisco Zen Center]], [[Transcendental Meditation]], [[Soka Gakkai]], the [[Inner Peace Movement]], the [[Church of All Worlds]], and the [[Church of Satan]].{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=53–54}} Although there had been an established interest in Asian religious ideas in the U.S. from at least the eighteenth-century,{{sfn|Brown|1992|pp=88–89}} many of these new developments were variants of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sufism]], which had been imported to the West from Asia following the U.S. government's decision to rescind the [[Asian Exclusion Act]] in 1965.{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2pp=54–55}} In 1962 the [[Esalen Institute]] was established in [[Big Sur]], [[California]].{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1pp=36–37|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=35|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=1996|3pp=38–39|4a1=Heelas|4y=1996|4p=51}} Esalen and similar personal growth centers had developed links to [[humanistic psychology]], and from this, the [[human potential movement]] emerged, strongly influenced the New Age.{{sfnm|1a1=Alexander|1y=1992|1pp=36, 41–43|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=8|3a1=Heelas|3y=1996|3p=53}}

In Britain, a number of small religious groups that came to be identified as the "light" movement had begun declaring the existence of a coming new age, influenced strongly by the Theosophical ideas of Blavatsky and Bailey.{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=20}} The most prominent of these groups was the [[Findhorn Foundation]], which founded the Findhorn Ecovillage in the Scottish area of [[Findhorn]], [[Moray]] in 1962.{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=20|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=35|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=1996|3pp=38–39|4a1=Heelas|4y=1996|4p=51|5a1=Chryssides|5y=2007|5p=8}} Although its founders were from an older generation, Findhorn attracted increasing numbers of countercultural baby boomers during the 1960s, to the extent that its population had grown sixfold to circa 120 residents by 1972.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=118}} In October 1965, the founder of Findhorn, [[Peter Caddy]], attended a meeting of various prominent figures within Britain's esoteric milieu; titled "The Significance of the Group in the New Age", it was held at [[Attingham Park]] over the course of a weekend.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=83–84}}

All of these groups created the backdrop from which the New Age movement emerged. As James R. Lewis and [[J. Gordon Melton]] point out, the New Age phenomenon represents "a synthesis of many different preexisting movements and strands of thought".{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=xi}} Nevertheless, York asserted that while the New Age bore many similarities with both earlier forms of Western esotericism and Asian religion, it remained "distinct from its predecessors in its own self-consciousness as a new way of thinking".{{sfn|York|1995|p=1}}

===Emergence and development: c. 1970–2000===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The late 1950s saw the first stirrings within the cultic milieu of a belief in a coming new age. A variety of small movements arose, revolving around revealed messages from beings in space and presenting a synthesis of post-Theosophical and other esoteric doctrines. These movements might have remained marginal, had it not been for the explosion of the counterculture in the 1960s and early 1970s. Various historical threads... began to converge: nineteenth century doctrinal elements such as Theosophy and post-Theosophical esotericism as well as harmonious or positive thinking were now eclectically combined with... religious psychologies: transpersonal psychology, Jungianism and a variety of Eastern teachings. It became perfectly feasible for the same individuals to consult the I Ching, practice Jungian astrology, read Abraham Maslow's writings on peak experiences, etc. The reason for the ready incorporation of such disparate sources was a similar goal of exploring an individualized and largely non-Christian religiosity."|source=— Scholar of esotericism Olav Hammer, 2001.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=73}} }}

By the early 1970s, use of the term "New Age" was increasingly common within the cultic milieu.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=73}} This was because—according to Sutcliffe—the "emblem" of the "New Age" had been passed from the "subcultural pioneers" in groups like Findhorn to the wider array of "countercultural baby boomers" between ''circa'' 1967 and 1974. He noted that as this happened, the meaning of the term "New Age" changed; whereas it had once referred specifically to a coming era, at this point it came to be used in a wider sense to refer to a variety of spiritual activities and practices.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=112}} In the latter part of the 1970s, the New Age expanded to cover a wide variety of alternative spiritual and religious beliefs and practices, not all of which explicitly held to the belief in the Age of Aquarius, but were nevertheless widely recognised as broadly similar in their search for "alternatives" to mainstream society.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=97}} In doing so, the "New Age" became a banner under which to bring together the wider "cultic milieu" of American society.{{sfn|York|1995|p=33}}

The counterculture of the 1960s had rapidly declined by the start of the 1970s, in large part due to the collapse of the [[commune]] movement,{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=54}} but it would be many former members of the counter-culture and [[hippie]] subculture who subsequently became early adherents of the New Age movement.{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=xi}}
The exact origins of the New Age movement remain an issue of debate; Melton asserted that it emerged in the early 1970s,{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=18}} whereas Hanegraaff instead traced its emergence to the latter 1970s, adding that it then entered its full development in the 1980s.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=12}} This early form of the movement was based largely in Britain and exhibited a strong influence from Theosophy and [[Anthroposophy]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=97}} Hanegraaff termed this early core of the movement the ''New Age sensu stricto'', or "New Age in the strict sense".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=97|2a1=Sutcliffe|2a2=Gilhus|2y=2013|2p=4}}

Hanegraaff terms the broader development the ''New Age sensu lato'', or "New Age in the wider sense".{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=97|2a1=Sutcliffe|2a2=Gilhus|2y=2013|2p=4}} Stores that came to be known as "New Age shops" opened up, selling related books, magazines, jewellery, and crystals, and they were typified by the playing of New Age music and the smell of incense.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=126–127}}This probably influenced several thousand small metaphysical book- and gift-stores that increasingly defined themselves as "New Age bookstores",&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Fifty Years Among the New Words: A Dictionary of Neologisms, 1941–1991|first1=John|last1=Algeo|first2=Adele S. |last2=Algeo|year=1991|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=234|isbn=978-0-521-44971-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while New Age titles came to be increasingly available from mainstream bookstores and then websites like [[Amazon.com]].{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=16}}

Not everyone who came to be associated with the New Age phenomenon openly embraced the term "New Age", although it was popularised in books like [[David Spangler]]'s 1977 work ''Revelation: The Birth of a New Age'' and [[Mark Satin]]'s 1979 book ''New Age Politics: Healing Self and Society''.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=124}} [[Marilyn Ferguson]]'s 1982 book ''[[The Aquarian Conspiracy]]'' has also been regarded as a landmark work in the development of the New Age, promoting the idea that a new era was emerging.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=9}} Other terms that were employed synonymously with "New Age" in this milieu included "Green", "Holistic", "Alternative", and "Spiritual".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=128}}

1971 witnessed the foundation of [[Erhard Seminars Training|est]] by [[Werner H. Erhard]], a transformational training course that became a prominent part of the early movement.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=58–60}} Melton suggested that the 1970s witnessed the growth of a relationship between the New Age movement and the older New Thought movement, as evidenced by the widespread use of [[Helen Schucman]]'s ''[[A Course in Miracles]]'' (1975), New Age music, and crystal healing in New Thought churches.{{sfn|Melton|1992|pp=25–26}} Some figures in the New Thought movement were sceptical, challenging the compatibility of New Age and New Thought perspectives.{{sfn|Melton|1992|pp=26–27}} During these decades, Findhorn had become a site of [[pilgrimage]] for many New Agers, and greatly expanded in size as people joined the community, with workshops and conferences being held there that brought together New Age thinkers from across the world.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=29}}

[[File:New Age Shrine Glastonbury - geograph.org.uk - 167848.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A new age shrine. |New Age shrine in [[Glastonbury]], England]]

Several key events occurred, which raised public awareness of the New Age subculture: publication of [[Linda Goodman]]'s best-selling astrology books ''Sun Signs'' (1968) and ''Love Signs'' (1978); the release of [[Shirley MacLaine]]'s book ''[[Out on a Limb (Shirley MacLaine book)|Out on a Limb]]'' (1983), later adapted into a television mini-series with the same name (1987); and the "[[Harmonic Convergence]]" [[planetary alignment]] on August 16 and 17, 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Hanegraaff|1996 | p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by [[José Argüelles]] in [[Sedona, Arizona]]. The Convergence attracted more people to the movement than any other single event.{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=ix}} Heelas suggested that the movement was influenced by the "enterprise culture" encouraged by the U.S. and U.K. governments during the 1980s onward, with its emphasis on initiative and self-reliance resonating with any New Age ideas.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=168}}

The claims of channelers [[Jane Roberts]] ([[Seth Material]]), Helen Schucman (''[[A Course in Miracles]]''), [[J. Z. Knight]] ([[Ramtha]]), [[Neale Donald Walsch]] (''[[Conversations with God]]'') (note that Walsch denies being a "channeler" and his books make it obvious that he is not one, though the text emerged through a dialogue with a deeper part of himself in a process comparable to [[automatic writing]]) contributed to the movement's growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Lewis|1992 | pp=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Drury|2004 | pp=133–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant exponent of the New Age movement in the U.S. has been cited as [[Ram Dass]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kyle|1y=1995|1pp=66–67|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=35}} Core works in the propagating New Age ideas included Jane Roberts's Seth series, published from 1972 onward,{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=16}} Helen Schucman's 1975 publication ''A Course in Miracles'',{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1pp=35–36|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=16}} and [[James Redfield]]'s 1993 work ''[[The Celestine Prophecy]]''.{{sfnm|1a1=Sutcliffe|1y=2003a|1p=127|2a1=Pike|2y=2004|2p=16}} A variety of these books were [[best seller]]s, with the Seth book series for instance selling over a million copies.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=16}} Supplementing these books were videos, audiotapes, compact discs and websites.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=17}} The development of the internet in particular further popularized New Age ideas and made them more widely accessible.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=18}}

New Age ideas influenced the development of [[rave]] culture in the late 1980s and 1990s.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=168}} In Britain during the 1980s, the term "[[New Age Travellers]]" came into use,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=129}} although York characterised this term as "a misnomer created by the media".{{sfn|York|2001|p=370}} These New Age Travellers had little to do with the New Age as the term was used more widely,{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=8}} with scholar of religion Daren Kemp observing that "New Age spirituality is not an essential part of New Age Traveller culture, although there are similarities between the two worldviews".{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=34}} The term "New Age" came to be used increasingly widely by the popular media in the 1990s.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=129}}

===Decline or transformation?: 1990–present===

By the late 1980s, some publishers dropped the term "New Age" as a marketing device.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=35}} In 1994, the scholar of religion [[Gordon J. Melton]] presented a conference paper in which he argued that, given that he knew of nobody describing their practices as "New Age" anymore, the New Age had died.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=178}} In 2001, Hammer observed that the term "New Age" had increasingly been rejected as either pejorative or meaningless by individuals within the Western cultic milieu.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=74}} He also noted that within this milieu it was not being replaced by any alternative, and that as such a sense of collective identity was being lost.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=74}}

Other scholars disagreed with Melton's idea; in 2004 Daren Kemp stated that "New Age is still very much alive".{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=179}} Hammer himself stated that "the New Age ''movement'' may be on the wane, but the wider New Age ''religiosity''... shows no sign of disappearing".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=75}} MacKian suggested that the New Age "movement" had been replaced by a wider "New Age sentiment" which had come to pervade "the socio-cultural landscape" of Western countries.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=7}} Its diffusion into the mainstream may have been influenced by the adoption of New Age concepts by high profile figures: U.S. First Lady [[Nancy Reagan]] consulted an astrologer, British [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] visited spirit mediums, and Norwegian Princess [[Princess Märtha Louise of Norway|Märtha Louise]] established a school devoted to communicating with angels.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=146}} 
New Age shops continued to operate, although many have been remarketed as "Mind, Body, Spirit".{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=17}} 

In 2015, the scholar of religion [[Hugh Urban]] argued that New Age spirituality is growing in the United States and can be expected to become more visible: "According to many recent surveys of religious affiliation, the 'spiritual but not religious' category is one of the fastest-growing trends in American culture, so the New Age attitude of spiritual individualism and eclecticism may well be an increasingly visible one in the decades to come".{{sfn|Urban|2015|p=11}}

==Beliefs and practices==
{{Main article|Spiritual but not religious|List of New Age topics}}

===Eclecticism and self-spirituality===

The New Age places strong emphasis on the idea that the individual and their own experiences are the primary source of authority on spiritual matters.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1pp=201–202|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2pp=21–23|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=26}} It exhibits what Heelas termed "unmediated individualism",{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=21–23}} and reflects a world-view that is "radically democratic".{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=124}} It places an emphasis on the freedom and autonomy of the individual.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=26–27|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=119}} This emphasis has led to ethical disagreements; some New Agers believe helping others is beneficial, although another view is that doing so encourages dependency and conflicts with a reliance on the self.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=25}} Nevertheless, within the New Age, there are differences in the role accorded to voices of authority outside of the self.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=34}} Hammer stated that "a belief in the existence of a core or true Self" is a "recurring theme" in New Age texts.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=11}} The concept of "[[personal growth]]" is also greatly emphasised among New Agers,{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=46|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2p=188}} while Heelas noted that "for participants spirituality ''is'' life-itself".{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=27}}

New Age religiosity is typified by its eclecticism.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=163}} Generally believing that there is no one true way to pursue spirituality,{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=118–119}} New Agers develop their own worldview "by combining bits and pieces to form their own individual mix",{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=28}} seeking what Drury called "a spirituality without borders or confining dogmas".{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=8}} The anthropologist David J. Hess noted that in his experience, a common attitude among New Agers was that "any alternative spiritual path is good because it is spiritual and alternative".{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=36}} This approach that has generated a common jibe that New Age represents "supermarket spirituality".{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=32}} York suggested that this eclecticism stemmed from the New Age's origins within [[late modernity|late modern]] capitalism, with New Agers subscribing to a belief in a free market of spiritual ideas as a parallel to a free market in economics.{{sfn|York|2001|p=367}} 

As part of its eclecticism, the New Age draws ideas from many different cultural and spiritual traditions from across the world, often legitimising this approach by reference to "a very vague claim" about underlying global unity.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=139}} Certain societies are more usually chosen over others;{{sfnm|1a1=Hammer|1y=2001|1p=199|2a1=Kemp|2y=2004|2p=49}} examples include the ancient Celts, ancient Egyptians, the [[Essenes]], [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]], and ancient extra-terrestrials.{{sfn|Kemp|2004|p=47}} As noted by Hammer: "to put it bluntly, no significant spokespersons within the New Age community claim to represent ancient Albanian wisdom, simply because beliefs regarding ancient Albanians are not part of our cultural stereotypes".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=199}} According to Hess, these ancient or foreign societies represent an exotic "Other" for New Agers, who are predominantly white Westerners.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=48}}

===Theology, cosmogony, and cosmology===

[[File:Snoqualmie Moondance meditation 02.jpg|thumb|right|New Age meditation group at the Snoqualmie Moondance festival, 1992]]

A belief in [[divinity]] is integral to New Age ideas, although understandings of this divinity vary.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=182–183}} New Age [[theology]] exhibits an inclusive and universalistic approach that accepts all personal perspectives on the divine as equally valid.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=185}} This intentional vagueness as to the nature of divinity also reflects the New Age idea that divinity cannot be comprehended by the human mind or language.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=186}} New Age literature nevertheless displays recurring traits in its depiction of the divine: the first is the idea that it is [[Holism|holistic]], thus frequently being described with such terms as an "Ocean of Oneness", "Infinite Spirit", "Primal Stream", "One Essence", and "Universal Principle".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=186}} A second trait is the characterisation of divinity as "Mind", "Consciousness", and "Intelligence",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=186–187}} while a third is the description of divinity as a form of "[[Energy (esotericism)|energy]]".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=187}} A fourth trait is the characterisation of divinity as a "life force", the essence of which is creativity, while a fifth is the concept that divinity consists of [[love]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=187–188}}

Most New Age groups believe in an Ultimate Source from which all things originate, which is usually conflated with the divine.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=120}} Various [[creation myths]] have been articulated in New Age publications outlining how this Ultimate Source created the universe and everything in it.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=122–123}} In contrast, some New Agers emphasise the idea of a universal inter-relatedness that is not always emanating from a single source.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=128}} The New Age worldview emphasises holism and the idea that everything in existence is intricately connected as part of a single whole,{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=119|2a1=Drury|2y=2004|2p=11}} in doing so rejecting both the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] of Judeo-Christian thought and the [[reductionism]] of Cartesian science.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=119}} A number of New Agers have linked this holistic interpretation of the universe to the [[Gaia hypothesis]] of [[James Lovelock]].{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=23}} The idea of holistic divinity results in a common New Age belief that humans themselves are divine in essence, a concept described using such terms as "droplet of divinity", "inner Godhead", and "divine self".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=204}} Influenced by Theosophical and Anthroposophical ideas regarding '[[subtle bodies]]',{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=222–223}} a common New Age idea holds to the existence of a "Higher Self" that is a part of the human but connects with the divine essence of the universe, and which can advise the human mind through [[intuition]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=211–212}}

Cosmogonical creation stories are common in New Age sources,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=304}} with these accounts reflecting the movement's holistic framework by describing an original, primal oneness from which all things in the universe emanated.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=305}} An additional common theme is that human souls – once living in a spiritual world – then descended into a world of matter.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=307–308}}
The New Age movement typically views the material universe as a meaningful illusion, which humans should try to use constructively rather than focus on escaping into other spiritual realms.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=115}} This physical world is hence seen as "a domain for learning and growth" after which the human soul might pass on to higher levels of existence.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=116–117}} There is thus a widespread belief that reality is engaged in an ongoing process of evolution; rather than [[Darwinian evolution]], this is typically seen as either a teleological evolution which assumes a process headed to a specific goal, or an open-ended, creative evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=158–160}}

MacKian argued that a central, but often overlooked, element of the phenomenon was an emphasis on "[[spirit]]", and in particular participants' desire for a relationship with spirit.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=51, 117}} Many practitioners in her UK-focused study described themselves as "workers ''for'' spirit", expressing the desire to help people learn about spirit.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=145}} They understood various material signs as marking the presence of spirit, for instance the unexpected appearance of a feather.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=142–143}} New Agers often call upon this spirit to assist them in everyday situations, for instance to ease the traffic flow on their way to work.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=84, 143}}  

New Age literature often refers to benevolent non-human spirit-beings who are interested in humanity's spiritual development; these are variously referred to as angels, [[guardian angel]]s, personal guides, masters, teachers, and contacts.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=197, 198}} New Age angelology is nevertheless unsystematic, reflecting the idiosyncrasies of individual authors.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=198}} The figure of Jesus Christ is often mentioned within New Age literature as a mediating principle between divinity and humanity, as well as an exemplar of a spiritually advanced human being.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=189–190}}

Although not present in every New Age group,{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=105}} a core belief within the milieu is in [[mediumship|channeling]].{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=21|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=23|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=24}} This is the idea that humans beings, sometimes (although not always) in a state of [[trance]], can act "as a channel of information from sources other than their normal selves".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=23–24}} These sources are varyingly described as being [[God]], [[gods]] and [[goddesses]], [[ascended masters]], [[spirit guide]]s, [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]], [[angel]]s, [[Deva (New Age)|devas]], historical figures, the [[collective unconscious]], [[elemental]]s, or [[nature spirit]]s.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=23–24}} Hanegraaff described channeling as a form of "articulated revelation",{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=24}} and identified four forms: trance channeling, automatisms, clairaudient channeling, and open channeling.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=27–28}}

Prominent examples of New Age channeling include Jane Roberts' claims that she was contacted by an entity called Seth, and Helen Schucman's claims to have channeled Jesus Christ.{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=22|2a1=Riordan|2y=1992|2pp=108–110|3a1=Pike|3y=2004|3p=28}} The academic Suzanne Riordan examined a variety of these New Age channeled messages, noting that they typically "echoed each other in tone and content", offering an analysis of the human condition and giving instructions or advice for how humanity can discover its true destiny.{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=110}}
For many New Agers, these channeled messages rival the scriptures of the main world religions as sources of spiritual authority,{{sfn|Riordan|1992|p=108}} although often New Agers describe historical religious revelations as forms of "channeling" as well, thus attempting to legitimate and authenticate their own contemporary practices.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=26–27}} Although the concept of channeling from discarnate spirit entities has links to [[Spiritualism]] and [[psychical research]], the New Age does not feature Spiritualism's emphasis on proving the existence of life after death, nor psychical research's focus of testing mediums for consistency.{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=23}}

===Astrological cycles and the Age of Aquarius===

New Age thought typically envisions the world as developing through cosmological cycles that can be identified [[astrology|astrologically]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=102, 302}} It adopts this concept from Theosophy, although often presents it in a looser and more eclectic way than is found in Theosophical teaching.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=303}} New Age literature often claims that humanity once lived in an age of spiritual wisdom.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=302}} In the writings of New Agers like Edgar Cayce, the ancient period of spiritual wisdom is associated with concepts of supremely-advanced societies living on [[Lost lands|lost continents]] such as Atlantis, [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], and [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]], as well as the idea that ancient societies like those of [[Ancient Egypt]] were far more technologically advanced than modern scholarship accepts.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=309–314}}
New Age literature often posits that the ancient period of spiritual wisdom gave way to an age of spiritual decline, sometimes termed the [[Age of Pisces]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=302}} Although characterised as being a negative period for humanity, New Age literature views the Age of Pisces as an important learning experience for the species.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=320}} 
Hanegraaff stated that New Age perceptions of history were "extremely sketchy" in their use of description,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=320}} reflecting little interest in [[historiography]] and conflating history with [[myth]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=324}} He also noted that they were highly [[ethnocentrism|ethnocentric]] in placing [[Western world|Western civilization]] at the centre of historical development.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=303}}

[[File:Venice ast sm.jpg|thumb|left|Astrological ideas hold a central place in the New Age]]

A common belief among the New Age is that humanity has entered, or is coming to enter, a new period known as the [[Age of Aquarius]],{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=94}} which Melton has characterised as a "New Age of love, joy, peace, abundance, and harmony[...] the Golden Age heretofore only dreamed about."{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=19}} In accepting this belief in a coming new age, the milieu has been described as "highly positive, celebratory, [and] utopian",{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=28}} and has also been cited as an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic movement]].{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=24}} Opinions about the nature of the coming Age of Aquarius differ among New Agers.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=333}} There are for instance differences in belief about its commencement; New Age author David Spangler claimed that it began in 1967,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=334–335}} others placed its beginning with the Harmonic Convergence of 1987,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=335}} author José Argüelles predicted its start [[2012 phenomenon|in 2012]],{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=72}} and some believe that it will not begin until several centuries into the third millennium.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=335–336}}

There are also differences in how this new age is envisioned.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=336}} Those adhering to what Hanegraaff termed the "moderate" perspective believed that it would be marked by an improvement to current society, which affected both New Age concerns—through the convergence of science and mysticism and the global embrace of alternative medicine—to more general concerns, including an end to violence, crime and war, a healthier environment, and international co-operation.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=339–340}} Other New Agers adopt a fully utopian vision, believing that the world will be wholly transformed into an "Age of Light", with humans evolving into totally spiritual beings and experiencing unlimited love, bliss, and happiness.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=341—343}} Rather than conceiving of the Age of Aquarius as an indefinite period, many believe that it would last for around two thousand years before being replaced by a further age.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=102}} 

There are various beliefs within the milieu as to how this new age will come about, but most emphasise the idea that it will be established through [[human agency]]; others assert that it will be established with the aid of non-human forces such as spirits or extra-terrestrials.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=74}} Ferguson for instance claimed that there was a vanguard of humans known as the "Aquarian conspiracy" who were helping to bring the Age of Aquarius forth through their actions.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=70}} Participants in the New Age typically express the view that their own spiritual actions are helping to bring about the Age of Aquarius,{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=19|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2pp=75–76}} with writers like Ferguson and Argüelles presenting themselves as prophets ushering forth this future era.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=73}}

===Healing and alternative medicine===

Another recurring element of New Age is an emphasis on healing and [[alternative medicine]].{{sfnm|1a1=Ellwood|1y=1992|1p=60|2a1=York|2y=1995|2p=37|3a1=Hanegraaff|3y=1996|3p=42|4a1=Sutcliffe|4y=2003a|4p=174}}&lt;ref name="Butler 2007"&gt;Butler, Jenny and Maria Tighe, "Holistic Health and New Age in the British Isles". 415-34 in Kemp, Daren and Lewis, James R., ed. (2007), Handbook of New Age, Boston, Massachusetts, US: Brill Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|978-90-04-15355-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The general New Age ethos is that health is the natural state for the human being and that illness is a disruption of that natural balance.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=46–47}} Hence, New Age therapies seek to heal "[[illness]]" as a general concept that includes physical, mental, and spiritual aspects; in doing so it critiques mainstream Western medicine for simply attempting to cure [[disease]], and thus has an affinity with most forms of [[traditional medicine]].{{sfnm|1a1=Albanese|1y=1992|1pp=81–82|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=42–43|3a1=Sutcliffe|3y=2003a|3p=176}} Its focus of self-spirituality has led to the emphasis of self-healing,{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=82–87|2a1=Sutcliffe|2y=2003a|2pp=176, 178|3a1=MacKian|3y=2012|3p=160}} although also present are ideas on healing both others and the Earth itself.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1pp=82–87|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=160}}

[[File:Siete chakras.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Reiki]] is one of the alternative therapies commonly found in the New Age movement.]]

The healing elements of the movement are difficult to classify given that a variety of terms are used, with some New Age authors using different terms to refer to the same trends, while others use the same term to refer to different things.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=48}} However, Hanegraaff developed a set of categories into which the forms of New Age healing could be roughly categorised. The first of these was the [[Human Potential Movement]], which argues that contemporary Western society suppresses much human potential, and accordingly professes to offer a path through which individuals can access those parts of themselves that they have alienated and suppressed, thus enabling them to reach their full potential and live a meaningful life.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=48–49}} Hanegraaff described [[transpersonal psychology]] as the "theoretical wing" of this Human Potential Movement; in contrast to other schools of psychological thought, transpersonal psychology takes religious and mystical experiences seriously by exploring the uses of [[altered states of consciousness]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=50–51}} Closely connected to this is the [[Neoshamanism|shamanic consciousness]] current, which argues that the [[shamanism|shaman]] was a specialist in altered states of consciousness and seeks to adopt and imitate traditional shamanic techniques as a form of personal healing and growth.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=52}}

Hanegraaff identified the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being [[holistic health]]. This emerged in the 1970s out of the [[free clinic]] movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=53–54}} It emphasises the idea that the human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=54}} A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, with some of the most common including [[acupuncture]], reiki, [[biofeedback]], [[chiropractic]], [[yoga]], [[kinesiology]], [[homeopathy]], [[aromatherapy]] [[iridology]], [[massage]] and other forms of [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]], [[meditation]] and [[Visual perception|visualisation]], nutritional therapy, [[psychic healing]], [[herbal medicine]], [[crystal healing|healing using crystals]], metals, music, [[chromotherapy]], and reincarnation therapy.{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=1995|1p=37|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2pp=54–55|3a1=Kemp|3y=2004|3p=30}} The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age;{{sfn|Albanese|1992|p=79}} this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=162}}
The mainstreaming of the Holistic Health movement in the UK is discussed by Maria Tighe. The inter-relation of holistic health with the New Age movement is illustrated in Jenny Butler's ethnographic description of "Angel therapy" in Ireland.&lt;ref name="Butler 2007"/&gt;

==="New Age science"===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="The New Age is essentially about the search for spiritual and philosophical perspectives that will help transform humanity and the world. New Agers are willing to absorb wisdom teachings wherever they can find them, whether from an Indian guru, a renegade Christian priest, an itinerant Buddhist monk, an experiential psychotherapist or a Native American shaman. They are eager to explore their own inner potential with a view to becoming part of a broader process of social transformation. Their journey is towards totality of being."|source=— New Ager [[Nevill Drury]], 2004.{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=11}} }}

According to Drury, the New Age attempts to create "a worldview that includes both science and spirituality",{{sfn|Drury|2004|p=10}} while Hess noted how New Agers have "a penchant for bringing together the technical and the spiritual, the scientific and the religious".{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=4}}
Although New Agers typically reject [[rationalism]], the [[scientific method]], and the academic establishment, they employ terminology and concepts borrowed from science and particularly from the [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|New Physics]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=5|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=62}} Moreover, a number of prominent influences on New Age, such as [[David Bohm]] and [[Ilya Prigogine]], had backgrounds as professional scientists.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=63}} Hanegraaff identified "New Age science" as a form of ''[[Naturphilosophie]]''.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=64}} 

In this, the milieu is interested in developing unified world views to discover the nature of the divine and establish a scientific basis for religious belief.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=63}} Figures in the New Age movement—most notably [[Fritjof Capra]] in his ''[[The Tao of Physics]]'' (1975)—have drawn parallels between theories in the New Physics and traditional forms of [[mysticism]], thus arguing that ancient religious ideas are now being proven by contemporary science.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=128–129}} Many New Agers have adopted James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts akin to a single living organism, although have expanded this idea to include the idea that the Earth has consciousness and intelligence.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1pp=155–156|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2p=86}}

Despite New Agers' appeals to science, most of the academic and scientific establishments dismiss "New Age science" as [[pseudo-science]], or at best existing in part on the fringes of genuine scientific research.{{sfnm|1a1=Hess|1y=1993|1p=11|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=62}} This is an attitude also shared by many active in the field of [[parapsychology]].{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=11}} In turn, New Agers often accuse the scientific establishment of pursuing a dogmatic and outmoded approach to scientific enquiry,{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=68}} believing that their own understandings of the universe will replace those of the academic establishment in a [[paradigm shift]].{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=5|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=62}}

===Ethics and afterlife===

There is no ethical cohesion within the New Age phenomenon,{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=35}} although Hanegraaff argued that the central ethical tenet of the New Age is to cultivate one's own divine potential.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=281}} Given that the movement's holistic interpretation of the universe prohibits a belief in a dualistic [[good and evil]],{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=277}} negative events that happen are interpreted not as the result of evil but as lessons designed to teach an individual and enable them to advance spiritually.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=236–237, 278}}
It rejects the Christian emphasis on [[sin]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=294–295}} It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing that if an individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=293}} Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power behind such thoughts vary within New Age literature.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=240}} Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=240—241}} and the visualisation of a white light.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=242}}

According to Hanegraaff, the question of death and afterlife is not a "pressing problem requiring an answer" in the New Age.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=258}} A belief in [[reincarnation]] is very common, where it often viewed as being part of an individual's progressive spiritual evolution toward realisation of their own divinity.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=1996|1p=262|2a1=York|2y=2001|2p=364|3a1=MacKian|3y=2012|3p=109}} In New Age literature, the reality of reincarnation is usually treated as self-evident, with no explanation as to why practitioners embrace this afterlife belief over others,{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=263}} although New Agers endorse it in the belief that it ensures cosmic justice.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=264}} Many New Agers believe in [[karma]], treating it as a law of cause and effect that assures cosmic balance, although in some cases they stress that it is not a system that enforces punishment for past actions.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=286}}
In much New Age literature on reincarnation, it is claimed that part of the human soul, that which carries the personality, perishes with the death of the body, while the Higher Self – that which connects with divinity – survives in order to be reborn into another body.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=266}} It is believed that the Higher Self chooses the body and circumstances into which it will be born, in order to use it as a vessel through which to learn new lessons and thus advance its own spiritual evolution.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=262}} Prominent New Age writers like [[Shakti Gawain]] and [[Louise Hay]] therefore express the view that humans are responsible for the events that happen to them during their life, an idea that many New Agers regard as empowering.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=234}} At times, past life regression are employed within the New Age in order to reveal a Higher Soul's previous incarnations, usually with an explicit healing purpose.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=271–275}} Some practitioners espouse the idea of a "soul group" or "soul family", a group of connected souls who reincarnate together as family of friendship units.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=109}} Rather than reincarnation, another afterlife belief found among New Agers holds that an individual's soul returns to a "universal energy" on bodily death.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=109}}

==Demographics==

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote=By the early twenty-first century... [the New Age phenomenon] has an almost entirely white, middle-class demography largely made up of professional, managerial, arts, and entrepreneurial occupations.|source=— Religious studies scholar Steven J. Sutcliffe.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=223}} }}

In the mid-1990s, the New Age was found primarily in the United States and Canada, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand.{{sfn|York|1995|p=42}} The fact that most individuals engaging in New Age activity do not describe themselves as "New Agers" renders it difficult to determine how many practitioners there are.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=2}} Heelas highlighted the range of attempts to establish the number of New Age participants in the U.S. during this period, noting that estimates ranged from 20,000 to 6 million; he believed that the higher ranges of these estimates were greatly inflated by, for instance, an erroneous assumption that all Americans who believed in reincarnation were part of the movement.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=112}} He nevertheless suggested that over 10 million people in the U.S. had had some contact with New Age practices or ideas.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=120}} In 2006, Heelas stated that New Age practices had grown to such an extent that they were "increasingly rivalling the sway of Christianity in western settings".{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=4}}

Sociological investigation indicates that certain sectors of society are more likely to engage in New Age practices than others.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=223–224}} The majority of participants are from the middle and upper-middle classes of Western society.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=121|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=53}} Sutcliffe noted that although most influential New Age figureheads were male,{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=220–221}} approximately two-thirds of its participants were female.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=220}}
The movement is strongly gendered; sociologist Ciara O'Connor argues that it shows a tension between commodification and women's empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Ciara, "Becoming whole: an exploration of women's choices in the holistic and New Age movement in Ireland". 220–39 in Olivia Cosgrove et al. (eds), Ireland's new religious movements. Cambridge Scholars, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Sutcliffe described the "typical" participant in the New Age milieu as being "a religious individualist, mixing and matching cultural resources in an animated spiritual quest".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=200}}

[[File:Rave in the Henge 2005.jpg|thumb|left|200px|alt=Stonehenge at night, with revellers inside|[[Stonehenge]] is a site visited by New Age pilgrims, as seen in this midsummer rave]]

In the United States, the first people to embrace the New Age belonged to the [[baby boomer]] generation, those born between 1946 and 1964.{{sfn|Brown|1992|p=90}} 
Heelas added that within that broad demographic, the movement had nevertheless attracted a diverse clientele.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=136}} He typified the typical New Ager as someone who was well-educated yet disenchanted with mainstream society, thus arguing that the movement catered to those who believe that [[modernity]] is in crisis.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=137–138}} He suggested that the movement appealed to many former practitioners of the 1960s counter-culture because while they came to feel that they were unable to change society, they were nonetheless interested in changing the self.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=142}} He believed that many individuals had been "culturally primed for what the New Age has to offer",{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=172}} with the New Age attracting "expressive" people who were already comfortable with the ideals and outlooks of the movement's self-spirituality focus.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=161–162}} It could be particularly appealing because the New Age suited the needs of the individual, whereas traditional religious options that are available primarily catered for the needs of a community.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=173}} He believed that although the adoption of New Age beliefs and practices by some fitted the model of [[religious conversion]],{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=186}} others who adopted some of its practices could not easily be considered to have converted to the religion.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=183}}

The degree to which individuals are involved in the New Age varies.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=117}} Heelas argued that those involved could be divided into three broad groups; the first comprised those who were completely dedicated to it and its ideals, often working in professions that furthered those goals. The second consisted of "serious part-timers" who worked in unrelated fields but who nevertheless spent much of their free time involved in movement activities. The third was that of "casual part-timers" who occasionally involved themselves in New Age activities but for whom the movement was not a central aspect of their life.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=118–119}} MacKian instead suggested that involvement could be seen as being layered like an onion; at the core are "consultative" practitioners who devote their life to New Age practices, around that are "serious" practitioners who still invest considerable effort into New Age activities, and on the periphery are "non-practitioner consumers", individuals affected by he general dissemination of New Age ideas but who do not devote themselves more fully to them.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|pp=73–74}} Many New Age practices have filtered into wider Western society, with a 2000 poll for instance revealing that 39% of the UK population had tried alternative therapies.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=52}}

In 1995, Kyle stated that on the whole, New Agers in the United States preferred the values of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] over those of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He added that most New Agers "soundly rejected" the agenda of former Republican President [[Ronald Reagan]].{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=846}}

===Social communities===

MacKian suggested that this phenomenon was "an inherently ''social'' mode of spirituality", one which cultivated a sense of belonging among its participants and encouraged relations both with other humans and with non-human, otherworldly spirit entities.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=136}}
MacKian suggested that these communities "may look very different" from those of traditional religious groups.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=135}}

Online connections were one of the ways that interested individuals met new contacts and established networks.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=131}}

Some New Agers advocate living in a [[simple living|simple]] and [[sustainable living|sustainable]] manner to reduce humanity's impact on the [[natural resource]]s of Earth; and they shun [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=74–75}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Spring|first=Joel H.|title=How Educational Ideologies Are Shaping Global Society: Intergovernmental Organizations, NGO's, and the Decline of the Nation-state|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, New Jersey, US|year=2004|edition=illustrated|page=119|chapter=Chapter 4: Love the Biosphere: Environmental Ideologies Shaping Global Society|isbn=978-0-8058-4915-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=8Xssc9_3FPgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Sustainable+living%22+new+agers#PPA119,M1|archiveurl=https://books.google.com/?id=8Xssc9_3FPgC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;dq=%22Sustainable+living%22+new+agers#PPA119,M1|accessdate=2009-03-27|archivedate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Age movement has been centered around rebuilding a [[sense of community]] to counter [[social disintegration]]; this has been attempted through the formation of [[intentional communities]], where individuals come together to live and work in a communal lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Lewis|1992 | pp=200–01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce argued that in seeking to "denying the validity of externally imposed controls and privileging the divine within", the New Age sought to dismantle pre-existing social order, but that it failed to present anything adequate in its place.{{sfn|Bruce|1998|pp=32–33}} Heelas however cautioned that Bruce had arrived at this conclusion based on "flimsy evidence".{{sfn|Heelas|1998|p=258}}

New Age centres have been set up in various parts of the world, representing an institutionalised form of the movement.{{sfn|York|1995|pp=40–41}} Notable examples include the [[Naropa Institute]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]], [[Holly Hock Farm]] near to [[Vancouver]], the [[Wrekin Trust]] in [[West Malvern]], [[Worcestershire]], and the [[Skyros Centre]] in [[Skyros]].{{sfn|York|1995|p=41}}

Criticising mainstream Western education as counterproductive to the ethos of the movement, many New Age groups have established their own schools for the education of children, although in other cases such groups have sought to introduce New Age spiritual techniques into pre-existing establishments.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=77–78}}

===Fairs and festivals===

New Age spirituality has led to a wide array of literature on the subject and an active niche market, with books, music, crafts, and services in alternative medicine available at New Age stores, [[fair]]s, and [[festival]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}
New Age fairs – sometimes known as "Mind, Body, Spirit fairs", "psychic fairs", or "alternative health fairs" – are spaces in which a variety of goods and services are displayed by different vendors, including forms of alternative medicine and esoteric practices such as palmistry or tarot card reading.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|pp=181–183}} A prominent example is the [[Mind Body Spirit Festival]], held annually in the United Kingdom,{{sfnm|1a1=Partridge|1y=2004|1p=65|2a1=MacKian|2y=2012|2p=24}} at which – the religious studies scholar Christopher Partridge noted – one could encounter "a wide range of beliefs and practices from crystal healing to ... Kirlian photography to psychic art, from angels to past-life therapy, from Theosophy to UFO religion, and from New Age music to the vegetarianism of Suma Chign Hai."{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=65}} Similar festivals are held across Europe and in Australia and the United States.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=24}}

===Approaches to financial prosperity and business===

A number of New Age proponents have emphasised the use of spiritual techniques as a tool for attaining financial prosperity, thus moving the movement away from its counter-cultural origins.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=60–62}} Commenting on this "New Age capitalism", Hess observed that it was largely small-scale and entrepreneurial, focused around small companies run by members of the [[petty bourgeoisie]], rather than being dominated by large scale multinational corporations.{{sfn|Hess|1993|p=38}} The links between New Age and commercial products have resulted in the accusation that New Age itself is little more than a manifestation of [[consumerism]].{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=6}} This idea is generally rejected by New Age participants, who often reject any link between their practices and consumerist activities.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=85}}

Embracing this attitude, various books have been published espousing such an ethos, established New Age centres have held spiritual retreats and classes aimed specifically at business people, and New Age groups have developed specialised training for businesses.{{sfn|Heelas|1996|pp=62–65}} During the 1980s, many prominent U.S. corporations—among them [[IBM]], [[AT&amp;T]], and [[General Motors]]—embraced New Age seminars, hoping that they could increase productivity and efficiency among their work force,{{sfn|Rupert|1992|p=127}} although in several cases this resulted in employees bringing legal action against their employers, claiming that such seminars had infringed on their religious beliefs or damaged their psychological health.{{sfn|Rupert|1992|p=133}} However, the use of spiritual techniques as a method for attaining [[Profit (economics)|profit]] has been an issue of major dispute within the wider New Age movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Melton|1y=1992|1p=23|2a1=Heelas|2y=1996|2p=86}} with prominent New Agers such as Spangler and [[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]] criticising what they see as trends within the community that are narcissistic and lack a social conscience.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=358–361}} In particular, the movement's commercial elements have caused problems given that they often conflict with its general economically-egalitarian ethos; as York highlighted, "a tension exists in New Age between socialistic egalitarianism and capitalistic private enterprise".{{sfn|York|1995|p=40}}

Given that it encourages individuals to choose spiritual practices on the grounds of personal preference and thus encourages them to behave as a consumer, the New Age has been considered to be well suited to modern society.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=34}}

===Music===
{{See also|List of new-age music artists|List of ambient artists}}
The term "[[New Age music]]" is applied, sometimes in a derogative manner, to forms of [[ambient music]], a genre that developed in the 1960s and was popularised in the 1970s, particularly with the work of [[Brian Eno]].{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=175}} The genre's relaxing nature resulted in it becoming popular within New Age circles,{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=175}} with some forms of the genre having a specifically New Age orientation.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=178}}
Studies have determined that new-age music can be an effective component of [[stress management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Principles and Practice of Stress Management, Third Edition |editor-last=Lehrer |editor-first=Paul M. |editor2=Robert L. Woolfolk |editor3=Wesley E. Sime |year=2007|pages=46–47|isbn=978-1-59385-000-5|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style began in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the works of free-form jazz groups recording on the [[ECM (record label)|ECM]] label; such as [[Oregon (band)|Oregon]], the [[Paul Winter Consort]], and other pre-ambient bands; as well as ambient music performer Brian Eno, classical avant-garde musician [[Daniel Kobialka]],&lt;ref name=Birosik&gt;Birosik, Patti Jean (1989).

New-age music evolved to include a wide range of styles from electronic [[space music]] using [[synthesizer]]s and acoustic instrumentals using [[Native American flute]]s and [[drum]]s, [[singing bowl]]s, Australian [[didgeredoo]]s and [[world music]] sounds to spiritual [[chant]]ing from other cultures.&lt;ref name=Birosik /&gt;&lt;ref name=Werkhoven /&gt;

==Politics==

While many commentators have focused on the spiritual and cultural aspects of the New Age movement, it also has a political component. The New Age political movement became visible in the 1970s, peaked in the 1980s, and continued into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, Richard (1995).  ''The New Age Movement in American Culture''.  University Press of America, Chap.&amp;nbsp;8 ("The New Age Reaches Out: Politics and Economics").  {{ISBN|978-0-7618-0010-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sociologist of religion Steven Bruce noted that the New Age provides ideas on how to deal with "our socio-psychological problems".{{sfn|Bruce|1998|p=23}}  Scholar of religion James R. Lewis observed that, despite the common caricature of New Agers as narcissistic, "significant numbers" of them were "trying to make the planet a better place on which to live," {{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=11}} and scholar J. Gordon Melton's ''New Age Encyclopedia'' (1990) included an entry called "New Age politics". {{sfn|Melton|1990| pp=323–325}}  Some New Agers have entered the political system in an attempt to advocate for the societal transformation that the New Age promotes.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}}

===Ideas===

Although New Age activists have been motivated by New Age concepts like holism, interconnectedness, monism, and environmentalism, their political ideas are diverse,{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}} ranging from [[far right politics|far-right]] and [[conservatism|conservative]] through to [[liberalism|liberal]], [[socialism|socialist]], and [[libertarianism|libertarian]].{{sfn|York|2001|p=367}} Accordingly, Kyle stated that "New Age politics is difficult to describe and categorize. The standard political labels—left or right, liberal or conservative–miss the mark."{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}} MacKian suggested that the New Age operated as a form of "world-realigning infrapolitics" that undermines the [[disenchantment]] of modern Western society.{{sfn|MacKian|2012|p=154}}

{{double image|left|Mark Satin in 2011.jpg
|141|BENJAMIN CREME 2006.jpg|139|Writers who have espoused political ideas influenced by New Age perspectives included [[Mark Satin]] (left) and [[Benjamin Creme]] (right).}}

The extent to which New Age spokespeople mix religion and politics varies.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=837}} New Agers are often critical of the established political order, regarding it as "fragmented, unjust, hierarchical, patriarchal, and obsolete".{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=832}} The New Ager [[Mark Satin]] for instance spoke of "New Age politics" as a politically radical "third force" that was "neither left nor right". He believed that in contrast to the conventional political focus on the "institutional and economic symptoms" of society's problems, his "New Age politics" would focus on "psychocultural roots" of these issues.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=833}} Ferguson regarded New Age politics as "a kind of Radical Centre", one that was "not neutral, not middle-of-the-road, but a view of the whole road."{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|pp=832–833}} Fritjof Capra argued that Western societies have become sclerotic because of their adherence to an outdated and mechanistic view of reality, which he calls the ''Newtonian/Cartesian paradigm''.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=107}}  In Capra's view, the West needs to develop an organic and ecological "systems view" of reality in order to successfully address its social and political issues.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=107}} [[Corinne McLaughlin]] argued that politics need not connote endless power struggles, that a new "spiritual politics" could attempt to synthesize opposing views on issues into higher levels of understanding.&lt;ref&gt;Mayne, Alan J. (1999).  ''From Politics Past to Politics Future: An Integrated Analysis of Current and Emergent Paradigms''.  Praeger Publishers / Greenwood Publishing Group, p.&amp;nbsp;179.  {{ISBN|978-0-275-96151-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many New Agers advocate [[globalisation]] and [[Glocalization|localisation]], but reject [[nationalism]] and the role of the [[nation-state]].{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=842}} Some New Age spokespeople have called for greater decentralisation and global unity, but are vague about how this might be achieved; others call for a global, centralised government.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|pp=842–843}} Satin for example argued for a move away from the nation-state and towards self-governing regions that, through improved global communication networks, would help engender world unity.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=843}} [[Benjamin Creme]] conversely argued that "the Christ," a great [[Avatar]], Maitreya, the [[World Teacher]], expected by all the major religions as their "Awaited One," would return to the world and establish a strong, centralised global government in the form of the [[United Nations]]; this would be politically re-organised along a spiritual hierarchy.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=845}} Kyle observed that New Agers often speak favourably of [[democracy]] and citizens' involvement in policy making but are critical of [[representative democracy]] and [[majority rule]], thus displaying elitist ideas to their thinking.{{sfn|Kyle|1995b|p=846}}

===Groups===

[[File:New World Alliance 1980.jpg|thumb |220px| right |alt=Twenty people sitting in a circle |The [[New World Alliance]] was one of several New Age political groups in the 1970s and 1980s.]]

Scholars have noted several New Age political groups.  Self-Determination: A Personal/Political Network, lauded by Ferguson&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Marilyn (1980).  ''The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980s''.  Jeremy P. Tarcher Inc., distributed by Houghton Mifflin, pp.&amp;nbsp;232–235.  {{ISBN|978-0-87477-191-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Satin,&lt;ref&gt;Satin, Mark (1978).  ''New Age Politics: Healing Self and Society''. Delta Books / Dell Publishing Co., pp.&amp;nbsp;219, 345.  {{ISBN|978-0-440-55700-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was described at length by sociology of religion scholar Steven Tipton.&lt;ref&gt;Tipton, Steven M. (1982).  ''Getting Saved from the Sixties: Moral Meaning in Conversion and Cultural Change''.  University of California Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;267–270.  {{ISBN|978-0-520-05228-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded in 1975 by California state legislator [[John Vasconcellos]] and others, it encouraged Californians to engage in personal growth work and political activities at the same time, especially at the grassroots level.&lt;ref&gt;Tipton, cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;267, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hanegraaff noted another California-based group, the [[Institute of Noetic Sciences]], headed by author [[Willis Harman]].  It advocated a change in consciousness – in "basic underlying assumptions" –  in order to come to grips with global crises.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=108–109}}  Kyle said that the New York City-based Planetary Citizens organization, headed by United Nations consultant and ''Earth at Omega'' author Donald Keys, sought to implement New Age political ideas.{{sfn|Kyle|1995|p=67}}

Scholar J. Gordon Melton and colleagues focused on the New World Alliance, a Washington, DC-based organization founded in 1979 by Mark Satin and others.  According to Melton et al., the Alliance tried to combine left- and right-wing ideas as well as personal growth work and political activities.  Group decision-making was facilitated by short periods of silence.{{sfn|Melton|1990|p=324}}  Sponsors of the Alliance's national political newsletter included Willis Harman and John Vasconcellos.&lt;ref&gt;Stein,  Arthur (1985).  ''Seeds of the Seventies: Values, Work, and Commitment in Post-Vietnam America''. University Press of New England, p.&amp;nbsp;136.  {{ISBN|978-0-87451-343-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholar James R. Lewis counted "Green politics" as one of the New Age's more visible activities.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=11}}  One academic book claims that the [[History of the Green Party of the United States|U.S. Green Party movement]] began as an initiative of a handful of activists including [[Charlene Spretnak]], co-author of a "'new age' interpretation" of the German Green movement (Capra and Spretnak's ''Green Politics''), and Mark Satin, author of ''New Age Politics''.&lt;ref&gt;Ely, John (1998).

Temple University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;200. {{ISBN|978-1-56639-516-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another academic publication says Spretnak and Satin largely co-drafted the U.S. Greens' founding document, the "Ten Key Values" statement.&lt;ref&gt;[[Greta Gaard|Gaard, Greta]] (1998).  ''Ecological Politics: Ecofeminists and the Greens''. Temple University Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;142–143.  {{ISBN|978-1-56639-569-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the 21st century===

[[File:Marianne Williamson.jpg|thumb |180px| right| alt=Head shot of a well-dressed woman with straight black hair |New Age author [[Marianne Williamson]] campaigned for a seat in the U.S. Congress in 2013–2014.]]

While the term "New Age" may have fallen out of favor,{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=74}}{{sfnp|Ray|Anderson|2000|pp=188–189}} scholar [[George Chryssides]] notes that the New Age by whatever name is "still alive and active" in the 21st century.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=22}}  In the realm of politics, New Ager Mark Satin's book ''Radical Middle'' (2004) reached out to mainstream liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Kilgore, Ed (June 2004).  "Good Government: Time to Stop Bashing the Two-Party System". ''[[Washington Monthly]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;58–59.

"What Works &amp; What Doesn't". ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;  York (2005) identified "key New Age spokespeople" including [[William Bloom]], [[Satish Kumar]], and [[Starhawk]] who were emphasizing a link between spirituality and environmental consciousness.{{sfn|York|2005|p=28}} Former [[Esalen Institute]] staffer Stephen Dinan's ''Sacred America, Sacred World''  (2016) prompted a long interview of Dinan in ''[[Psychology Today]]'', which called the book a "manifesto for our country's evolution that is both political and deeply spiritual".&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Matousek|Matousek, Mark]] (5 August 2016).

In 2013 longtime New Age author Marianne Williamson launched a campaign for a seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]], telling ''[[The New York Times]]'' that her type of spirituality was what American politics needed.&lt;ref name=Lovett /&gt;  "America has swerved from its ethical center", she said.&lt;ref name=Lovett&gt;Lovett, Ian (13 November 2013).

==Reception==

===Popular media===

Mainstream periodicals tended to be less than sympathetic; sociologist Paul Ray and psychologist Sherry Anderson discussed in their 2000 book ''[[The Cultural Creatives]]'', what they called the media's "zest for attacking" New Age ideas, and offered the example of a 1996 [[Lance Morrow]] essay in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.{{sfnp|Ray|Anderson|2000|pp=188–189}} Nearly a decade earlier, ''Time'' had run a long cover story critical of New Age culture; the cover featured a head shot of a famous actress beside the headline, "'''Om....''' THE NEW AGE starring Shirley MacLaine, faith healers, channelers, space travelers, and crystals galore".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine (7 December 1987), vol. 130, issue no. 23, front cover.&lt;/ref&gt;  The story itself, by former ''[[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]'' editor [[Otto Friedrich]], was sub-titled, "A Strange Mix of Spirituality and Superstition Is Sweeping Across the Country".&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich, Otto (7 December 1987).  "New Age Harmonies".  ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, vol. 130, issue no. 23, pp.&amp;nbsp;62–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, the magazine ''[[The New Republic]]'' ran a four-page critique of New Age culture and politics by journalist [[Richard Bradley (writer)|Richard Blow]] entitled simply, "Moronic Convergence".&lt;ref&gt;Blow, Richard (25 January 1988).  "Moronic Convergence".  ''[[The New Republic]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;24–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some New Agers and New Age sympathizers responded to such criticisms.  For example, sympathizers Ray and Anderson said that much of it was an attempt to "stereotype" the movement for idealistic and spiritual change, and to cut back on its popularity.{{sfnp|Ray|Anderson|2000|pp=188–189}} New Age theoretician David Spangler tried to distance himself from what he called the "New Age glamour" of crystals, talk-show channelers, and other easily commercialized phenomena, and sought to underscore his commitment to the New Age as a vision of genuine social transformation.{{sfnp|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=104–105}}

===Academia===
[[File:Wouter Hanegraaff 2006 Alchemy Conference.jpg|thumb|right|One of the first academics to study the New Age was Wouter Hanegraaff]]

Initially, academic interest in the New Age was minimal.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}} The earliest academic studies of the New Age phenomenon were performed by specialists in the study of new religious movements such as [[Robert Ellwood]].{{sfnm|1a1=Lewis|1y=1992|1p=6|2a1=Hanegraaff|2y=1996|2p=3}} This research was often scanty because many scholars regarded the New Age as an insignificant cultural fad.{{sfn|Lewis|Melton|1992|p=x}} Having been influenced by the U.S. [[anti-cult movement]], much of it was also largely negative and critical of New Age groups.{{sfn|Melton|1992|p=15}} The "first truly scholarly study" of the phenomenon was an [[edited volume]] put together by James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton in 1992.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}} From that point on, the number of published academic studies steadily increased.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}}

In 1994, [[Christoph Bochinger]] published his study of the New Age in Germany, ''"New Age" und moderne Religion''.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=20}} This was followed by Michael York's sociological study in 1995 and Richard Kyle's U.S.-focused work in 1995.{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=21}} In 1996, Paul Heelas published a sociological study of the movement in Britain, being the first to discuss its relationship with business.{{sfnm|1a1=Heelas|1y=1996|1p=5|2a1=Hammer|2y=2001|2pp=21–22}} That same year, Wouter Hanegraaff published ''New Age Religion and Western Culture'', a historical analysis of New Age texts;{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|pp=4–6}} Hammer later described it as having "a well-deserved reputation as the standard reference work on the New Age".{{sfn|Hammer|2001|p=22}} Most of these early studies were based on a textual analysis of New Age publications, rather than on an [[ethnography|ethnographic]] analysis of its practitioners.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|2003a|p=13}}

Sutcliffe and Gilhus argued that 'New Age studies' could be seen as having experienced two waves; in the first, scholars focused on "macro-level analyses of the content and boundaries" of the "movement", while the second wave featured "more variegated and contextualized studies of particular beliefs and practices".{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=6}} Sutcliffe and Gilhus have also expressed concern that, as of 2013, 'New Age studies' has yet to formulate a set of research questions scholars can pursue.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=6}}
The New Age has proved a challenge for scholars of religion operating under more formative models of what "religion" is.{{sfn|Sutcliffe|Gilhus|2013|p=5}} By 2006, Heelas noted that the New Age was so vast and diverse that no scholar of the subject could hope to keep up with all of it.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=15}}

===Christian perspectives===

Mainstream Christianity has typically rejected the ideas of the New Age.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=21}} Most published criticism of the New Age has been produced by Christians, particularly those on the religion's [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist wing]].{{sfn|Heelas|1996|p=201}} In the United States, the New Age became a major concern of [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian groups in the 1980s, an attitude that came to influence British evangelical groups.{{sfn|Hexham|1992|p=152}} During that decade, evangelical writers such as [[Constance Cumbey]], [[Dave Hunt (Christian apologist)|Dave Hunt]], [[Gary North (economist)|Gary North]], and [[Douglas Groothuis]] published books criticising the New Age from their Christian perspective; a number of them have been characterised as propagating [[conspiracy theories]] regarding the origin and purpose of the movement.{{sfn|Hexham|1992|p=154}} The most successful such publication however was [[Frank E. Peretti]]'s 1986 novel ''[[This Present Darkness]]'', which sold over a million copies; it depicted the New Age as being in league with [[feminism]] and secular education as part of a conspiracy to overthrow Christianity.{{sfn|Hexham|1992|p=156}}

Official responses to the New Age have been produced by major Christian organisations like the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[Church of England]], and [[Methodist Church]].{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|p=21}}

There are other Christian groups that have adopted a more positive view of the New Age, among them the [[New Age Catholics]], [[Christaquarians]], and [[Christians Awakening to a New Awareness]], all of which believe that New Age ideas can enhance a person's Christian faith.{{sfn|Chryssides|2007|pp=21–22}}

===Contemporary Pagan perspectives===
{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="Neopagan practices highlight the centrality of the relationship between humans and nature and reinvent religions of the past, while New Agers are more interested in transforming individual consciousness and shaping the future."|source=— Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike.{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=18}} }}

An issue of academic debate has been regarding the connection between the New Age movement and contemporary [[Paganism]], or [[Modern Paganism|Neo-Paganism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Kemp|1y=2004|1p=10|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=79}} The two phenomena have often being confused and conflated, particularly in Christian critiques.{{sfnm|1a1=Kemp|1y=2004|1p=8|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=79}} Religious studies scholar Sarah Pike asserted that there was a "significant overlap" between the two religious movements,{{sfn|Pike|2004|p=vii}} while [[Aidan A. Kelly]] stated that Paganism "parallels the New Age movement in some ways, differs sharply from it in others, and overlaps it in some minor ways".{{sfn|Kelly|1992|p=136}} Other scholars have identified them as distinct phenomena that share overlap and commonalities.{{sfnm|1a1=York|1y=2001|1pp=364–365|2a1=Doyle White|2y=2016|2p=9}} Hanegraaff suggested that whereas various forms of contemporary Paganism were not part of the New Age movement – particularly those that pre-dated the movement – other Pagan religions and practices could be identified as New Age.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=78}} Partridge portrayed both Paganism and the New Age as different streams of [[occulture]] ([[occult]] culture) that merge at points.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=78}}

Various differences between the two movements have been highlighted; the New Age movement focuses on an improved future, whereas the focus of Paganism is on the pre-Christian past.{{sfn|Kelly|1992|p=138}} Similarly, the New Age movement typically propounds a [[Universalism|universalist]] message that sees all religions as fundamentally the same, whereas Paganism stresses the difference between [[Monotheism|monotheistic religions]] and those embracing a [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] or [[Animism|animistic]] theology.{{sfn|Kelly|1992|p=138}} While the New Age emphasises a light-centred image, Paganism acknowledges both light and dark, life and death, and recognises the savage side of the natural world.{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=79}} Many Pagans have sought to distance themselves from the New Age movement, even using "New Age" as an insult within their community, while conversely many involved in the New Age have expressed criticism of Paganism for emphasizing the material world over the spiritual.{{sfn|Doyle White|2016|p=9}}
Many Pagans have expressed criticism of the high fees charged by New Age teachers, something not typically present in the Pagan movement,{{sfnm|1a1=Kelly|1y=1992|1p=139|2a1=Partridge|2y=2004|2p=79}} with some Pagans pronouncing the word "newage" to rhyme with "[[sewage]]".{{sfn|Blain|Wallis|2007|p=6}}

===Non-Western and indigenous responses===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="In the case of New Age, its solipsism, coupled with its advocacy of free market principles, opens the world's spiritual arena as an opportunity for spiritual exploitation and even capitalistic imperialism. Not only does it encourage a paradoxical homogenizing to the cultural standards of North Atlantic civilization, exemplified in its affirmation that 'we are all one', but it also carries an implicit judgement of inferior status for non-hegemonic cultures, inasmuch as they are not considered to be the ones who decide what is to be shared and what is not."|source=— Sociologist Michael York.{{sfn|York|2001|pp=367–368}} }}

One of the most contentious aspects of the New Age has been its adoption of spiritual ideas and practises from other, particularly non-Western cultures.{{sfn|York|2001|p=367}} Its belief that all traditions are free for anyone to use, rather than the [[private property]] of particular communities, has resulted in New Agers adopting and marketing the practices of [[Third World]] societies.{{sfn|York|2001|p=368}} These have included "Hawaiian [[Kahuna]] magic, Australian Aboriginal dream-working, South American Amerindian ''[[ayahuasca]]'' and ''San Pedro'' ceremony, Hindu Ayurveda and yoga, and Chinese Feng Shui, [[Qigong|Qi Gong]], and [[Tai chi|Tai Chi]]".{{sfn|York|2001|p=368}}

The New Age has been accused of [[cultural imperialism]], [[cultural appropriation|misappropriating]] the sacred ceremonies, and abuse of the intellectual and cultural property of indigenous peoples.&lt;ref name="LDNwar1"&gt;Mesteth, Wilmer, et al (June 10, 1993) "[http://www.thepeoplespaths.net/articles/ladecwar.htm Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality]."

===Political writers and activists===

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=right|quote="New Age politics might be seen not as a wayward, pathological creature of the New Left's imagination, but as a political innocent in candid, questioning dialogue with the unclaimed mainstream territory of progressive, rather than atomistic, individualism.  Indeed, if we were to examine some of the social and political threads that run through the aery fabric of New Age thinking, we would find certain themes that resonate with the necessary conditions for a left version of progressive individualism.  Generally speaking, New Age addresses its adherents as active participants, with a measure of control over their everyday lives. ...  The New Age 'person' is also in many respects an individual whose personal growth is indissociable from the environment; a link fleshed out in a variety of ecotopian stories and romances.  So, too, the small-scale imperative of New Age's cooperative communitarianism brings with it a host of potentially critical positions. ..."|source=— Scholar of cultural studies [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]], 1991.{{sfn|Ross|1991|p=69}} }}

Toward the end of the 20th century, some social and political analysts and activists were arguing that the New Age political perspective had something to offer mainstream society.&lt;ref&gt;Gerzon, Mark (1996).  ''A House Divided: Six Belief Systems Struggling for America's Soul''.  A Jeremy P. Tarcher Putnam Book / G. P. Putnam's Sons, Chap. 5 ("Gaia: The Transformation State").  {{ISBN|978-0-87477-823-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayne (1999), cited above, Chap. 11 ("Spiritual Politics").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ray and Anderson (2000), cited above, Chap. 7 ("A Great Current of Change").&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, some political scientists launched the "Section on Ecological and Transformational Politics" of the [[American Political Science Association]],&lt;ref&gt;"Preface: Paths to Transformational Politics".  In Woolpert, Stephen; Slaton, Christa Daryl; and Schwerin, Edward W., eds. (1998).  ''Transformational Politics: Theory, Study, and Practice''.  State University of New York Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;ix–xi.  {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3945-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and an academic book prepared by three of them stated that the "transformational politics" concept was meant to subsume such terms as ''new age'' and ''new paradigm''.&lt;ref&gt;Slaton, Christa Daryl; Woolpert, Stephen; Schwerin, Ed.  "Introduction: What Is Transformational Politics?"   In Woolpert et al. (1998), cited above, p.&amp;nbsp;xix.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, scholar of cultural studies [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]] suggested that New Age political ideas – however muddled and naïve – could help [[Progressivism in the United States#Progressivism in the 21st century|progressives]] construct an appealing alternative to both atomistic individualism and self-denying collectivism. {{sfn|Ross|1991|pp=65–72 ("New Age politics" sub-chapter)}}  In 2005, British researcher Stuart Rose urged scholars of alternative religions to pay more attention to the New Age's interest in such topics as "new socio-political thinking" and "New Economics",{{sfn|Rose|2005b|p=165}} topics Rose discussed in his book ''Transforming the World: Bringing the New Age Into Focus'', issued by a European academic publisher.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Stuart (2005).  ''Transforming the World: Bringing the New Age Into Focus''. [[Peter Lang (publisher)|Peter Lang]], Chap. 8 ("Community Activity").  {{ISBN|978-0-8204-7241-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other political thinkers and activists saw New Age politics less positively.  On the political right, author [[George Weigel]] argued that New Age politics was just a retooled and pastel-colored version of leftism.&lt;ref&gt;Weigel, George (March 1989).  "No Options".  ''American Purpose'', vol. 3, no. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservative evangelical writer Douglas Groothuis, discussed by scholars Hexham{{sfn|Hexham|1992| p=54}} and Kemp,{{sfn|Kemp|2004| p=52}} warned that New Age politics could lead to an oppressive world government.&lt;ref&gt;Groothuis, Douglas (1987).  "Politics: Building an International Platform".  In Hoyt, Karen, ed., ''The New Age Rage''. Fleming H. Revell Company / Baker Publishing Group, pp.&amp;nbsp;92–93 and 103–105.  {{ISBN|978-0-8007-5257-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the left, scholars argued that New Age politics was an oxymoron: that personal growth has little or nothing to do with political change.&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, Andrew (2001).  ''The Making of Green Knowledge: Environmental Politics and Cultural Transformation''.  Cambridge University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;169.  {{ISBN|978-0-521-79252-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Slavoj Žižek|Žižek, Slavoj]] (2000).  ''The Ticklish Subject: The Absent Centre of Political Ontology''.  Verso Books, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2 and 70.  {{ISBN|978-1-85984-291-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  One political scientist said New Age politics fails to recognize the reality of economic and political power.&lt;ref&gt;Boggs, Carl (2000).  ''The End of Politics: Corporate Power and the Decline of the Public Sphere''.  Guilford Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;170–72.  {{ISBN|978-1-57230-504-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another academic, [[Dana L. Cloud]], wrote a lengthy critique of New Age politics as a political ideology;&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, Dana L. (1998). ''Control and Consolation in American Culture and Politics: Rhetorics of Therapy''. Sage Publications, Chap. 6 ("The New Age of Post-Marxism").  {{ISBN|978-0-7619-0506-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; she faulted it for not being opposed to the [[capitalist system]], or to liberal individualism.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud (1998), cited above, pp.&amp;nbsp;144, 147–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

A criticism of New Age often made by leftists is that its focus on individualism deflects participants from engaging in socio-political activism.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|p=8}} This perspective regards New Age as a manifestation of consumerism that promotes [[elitism]] and indulgence by allowing wealthier people to affirm their socio-economic status through consuming New Age products and therapies.{{sfn|Heelas|2006|pp=6–7}}  New Agers who do engage in socio-political activism have also been criticized.  Journalist [[Harvey Wasserman]] suggested that New Age activists were too averse to social conflict to be effective politically.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, Harvey (31 August 1985). "The New Age Movement: The Politics of Transcendence".  ''[[The Nation]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;147 (discussing the ideas of activist Shelly Kellman).&lt;/ref&gt; Melton et al. found that New Age activists' commitment to the often frustrating process of consensus decision-making led to "extended meetings and minimal results",{{sfn|Melton|1990| p=324}} and a pair of futurists concluded that one once-promising New Age activist group had been both "too visionary and too vague" to last.&lt;ref&gt;Lipnack, Jessica; Stamps, Jeffrey (1982).

'''Oceanian Americans''' or '''Oceanic Americans''' are [[Americans]] whose ancestors came from [[Oceania]], a region which is compose of the [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]] and the [[Pacific Islands]].

There are basically two Oceanian American groups, that well represent the racial and cultural population of Oceania: Euro Oceanic Americans ([[Australian Americans]] and [[New Zealand Americans]]) and the indigenous peoples of Oceania in the United States or [[Pacific Islands Americans]] (Chamorro Americans, Samoan Americans, etc.) Most of the Euro-Oceanians are descended from the European settlers in Oceania; while [[Pacific Islander|Pacific Islanders]] are of indigenous Oceanic descent.&lt;ref&gt;''Geographica''; VIII, p. 283.

'''Peter Ludwig Berger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜr|ɡ|ər}}; March 17, 1929 &amp;ndash; June 27, 2017) was an Austrian-born American [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[theology|theologian]]. Berger became known for his work in the [[sociology of knowledge]], the [[sociology of religion]], study of [[modernization]], and theoretical contributions to [[sociological theory]]. 

Berger is arguably best known for his book, co-authored with [[Thomas Luckmann]], ''[[The Social Construction of Reality|The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge]]'' (New York, 1966), which is considered one of the most influential texts in the sociology of knowledge and played a central role in the development of [[social constructionism]]. In 1998 the [[International Sociological Association]] named this book as the fifth most-influential book written in the field of sociology during the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.isa-sociology.org/en/about-isa/history-of-isa/books-of-the-xx-century/ Books of the XX Century]". International Sociological Association. isa-sociology.org. Retrieved June&amp;nbsp;30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this book, some of the other books that Berger has written include: ''[[Invitation to Sociology: A Humanistic Perspective]]'' (1963); ''[[A Rumor of Angels: Modern Society and the Rediscovery of the Supernatural]]'' (1969); and ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Social Theory of Religion'' (1967).&lt;ref name="The Sacred Canopy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aeschliman, M.D. June 2011.

Berger spent most of his career teaching at [[The New School for Social Research]], at [[Rutgers University]], and at [[Boston University]]. Before retiring, Berger had been at [[Boston University]] since 1981 and was the director of the Institute for the Study of Economic Culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Allan, Kenneth.

==Biography==

===Family life===

Peter Ludwig Berger was born on March 17, 1929, in Vienna, Austria, to George William and Jelka (Loew) Berger, who were [[Jewish]] converts to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison Smith, ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/peter-berger-sociologist-who-argued-for-ongoing-relevance-of-religion-dies-at-88/2017/07/02/1e5636d0-5f32-11e7-84a1-a26b75ad39fe_story.html Peter Berger, sociologist who argued for ongoing relevance of religion, dies at 88]'', July 2 2017, [[The Washington Post]]&lt;/ref&gt; He died on June 27, 2017, in his [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], home after a prolonged illness.&lt;ref name="RIP Peter berger"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/2017/06/28/rip-founding-director-of-cura-prof-peter-berger-dies-at-88/ |title=RIP: Founding Director of CURA, Prof. Peter Berger, Dies at 88 | publisher = Boston University |date= |accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to the United States shortly after [[World War II]] in 1946 at the age of 17&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; and in 1952 he became a naturalized citizen.

On September 28, 1959, he married Brigitte Kellner, herself an eminent sociologist who was on the faculty at [[Wellesley College]] and [[Boston University]] where she was the chair of the sociology department at both schools. Brigitte was born in Eastern Germany in 1928. She moved to the United States in the mid-1950s. She was a sociologist who focused on the sociology of the family, arguing that the nuclear family was one of the main causes of modernization. Although she studied traditional families, she supported same-sex relationships. She was on the faculties of Hunter College of the City University of New York, Long Island University, Wellesley College, and Boston University.&lt;ref name="Brigitte Kellner Berger" /&gt; Additionally, she was author of ''Societies in Change'' (1971), ''The Homeless Mind'' (1974), ''The War over the Family'' (1984), and ''The Family in the Modern Age'' (2002).Brigitte Kellner Berger died May 28, 2015. &lt;ref name="Brigitte Kellner Berger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/06/17/an-obituary/ |title=An Obituary: Brigitte Berger, by Peter Berger | publisher = The American Interest |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They had two sons, Thomas Ulrich Berger and Michael George Berger. Thomas is himself a scholar of international relations, now a Professor at the [[Pardee School of Global Studies]] at [[Boston University]] and author of ''War, Guilt and World Politics After World War II'' (2012) and ''Cultures of Antimilitarism: National Security in Germany and Japan'' (2003).&lt;ref name="Thomas Berger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/profile/thomas-berger/ |title=Profile: Thomas Berger | publisher = Pardee School of Global Studies, Boston University |date= |accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and career===
After the Nazi takeover of Austria in 1938, Berger and his family emigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], then under British rule. He attended a British High school, St. Luke's. Following the German bombings of [[Haifa]], he was evacuated to [[Mt. Carmel]], where he developed his life-long interest in religion. In 1947 Berger and his family emigrated again, this time to the United States, where they settled in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Berger "In Morgenlicht der Erinnerung - Eine Kindheit in turbulenter Zeit (Vienna: Molden Wien, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Berger attended [[Wagner College]] for his [[Bachelor of Arts]] and received his M.A. and Ph.D. from the [[New School]] for Social Research in New York in 1954.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Berger, in his memoir, described himself as an "accidental sociologist", enrolling here in an effort to learn about American society and help become a Lutheran minister, and learning under Alfred Schütz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=Adventures of an Accidental Sociologist: How to Explain the World Without Becoming a Bore|date=2011|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, NY|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 and 1956 he worked at the Evangelische Akademie in [[Bad Boll]], [[West Germany]]. From 1956 to 1958 Berger was an assistant professor at the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]]; from 1958 to 1963 he was an associate professor at [[Hartford Theological Seminary]]. The next stations in his career were professorships at the New School for Social Research, [[Rutgers University]], and [[Boston College]]. Since 1981 Berger was the University Professor of Sociology and Theology at [[Boston University]]. He retired from BU in 2009. In 1985 he founded the Institute for the Study of Economic Culture, which later transformed into the Institute on Culture, Religion and World Affairs (CURA), and is now part of the Boston University [[Pardee School of Global Studies]].&lt;ref name="CURA Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/PardeeSchool/ |title=Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies  | publisher = Boston University |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained the Director of CURA from 1985 to 2010.&lt;ref name="CURA Website2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/cura/ |title=Institute on Culture, Religion and World Affairs  | publisher = Boston University |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CURA'''

Berger founded The [[Institute on Culture, Religion, and World Affairs]] at Boston University in 1985. It is a world-center for research, education, and public scholarship on religion and world affairs. Some of the questions it attempts to answer are: How do religion and values affect political, economic, and public ethical developments around the world? Defying earlier forecasts, why have religious actors and ideas become more rather than less globally powerful in recent years? and In a world of increasing religious and ethical diversity, what are the implications of the revival of public religion for citizenship, democracy, and civil coexistence? CURA has over 140 projects in 40 countries.&lt;ref name="CURA Website2" /&gt;

'''Religious views'''

Berger was a moderate Christian [[Lutheran]] conservative whose work in theology, secularization, and modernity at times has challenged the views of contemporary mainstream sociology which tends to lean away from any [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] political thinking. Ultimately, however, Berger's approach to sociology was humanist with special emphasis on "value-free" analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=Adventures of an Accidental Sociologist: How to Explain the World Without Becoming a Bore|date=2011|publisher=Prometheus|location=Amherst|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human beings construct a shared social reality. This is explained in Berger and Thomas Luckmann's book ''The Social Construction of Reality'' (1966). This reality includes things from ordinary language to large-scale institutions. Our lives are governed by the knowledge about the world that we have and use the information that is relevant to our lives. We take into account typificatory schemes, which are general assumptions about society. As one encounters a new scheme, one must compare it to the ones that are already established in one's mind and determine whether to keep those schemes or replace the old ones with new ones. Social structure is the total of all these typificatory schemes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Society: A Survey of Modern Social Theory|last=Mann|first=Douglas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-542184-2|location=Canada|pages=207–210|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The reality of everyday life====

Berger and Luckmann present this as the sphere of reality that presents itself upon human existence most intensely and immediately. Everyday life is contrasted with other spheres of reality – dreamworlds, theatre – and is considered by a person to be the objective, intersubjective (shared with others) and self-evident.  Life is ordered spatially and temporally. Spatial ordering allows interaction with other people and objects; the human ability to manipulate zones of space can intersect with another's ability.

{{quote|The reality of everyday life is taken for granted as reality. It does not require additional verification over and beyond its simple presence. It is simply there, as self-evident and compelling facticity.&lt;ref name="Anchor" /&gt;}}

Social interactions in everyday life favour personal, face-to-face encounters as the best scenarios where human beings can actually connect with each other through interactions. Humans perceive the other in these interactions as more real than they would themselves; we can place a person in everyday life by seeing them, yet we need to contemplate our own placement in the world as it is not so concrete. Berger believes that although you know yourself on a much deeper scale than you would the other person, they are more real to you because they are constantly making "What he is" available to you. It is difficult to recognize "What I am" without separating oneself from the conversation and reflecting on it. Even then, that self-reflection is caused by the other person's interactions leading to that self contemplation.&lt;ref name="Anchor" /&gt;

Language is imperative to the understanding of everyday life. People understand knowledge through language. The knowledge relevant to us is the only necessary knowledge to our survival, but humans interact through sharing and connecting the relevant structures of our lives with each other.&lt;ref name="Anchor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter L|title=The Social Construction of Reality: a Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge|date=1966|publisher=Anchor|location=Garden City, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language helps create shared symbols and stocks of knowledge and participation in these things inherently makes us participate in society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Social reality on two levels====

Social reality exists at both the subjective and objective levels. At the subjective level, people find reality personally meaningful and created by human beings in aspects such as personal friendships. At the objective level, people find reality is aspects such as government bureaucracies and large corporations where reality is seen as more out of one's control.

==== Society as objective and subjective ====

Objectively, social order is a product of our social enterprise: it is an ongoing process that results from human activity. Institutions are a product of the historicity and need to control human habitualization (the repeated behaviours or patterns). The shared nature of these experiences and their commonality results in sedimentation, meaning they lose their memorability. Many behaviours lose sedimented institutional meanings. Institutional order involves specified roles for people to play. These roles are seen as performing as this objective figure – an employee is not judged as a human but by that role they have taken.

The process of building a socially-constructed reality takes place in three phases. Initially, externalization is the first step in which humans pour out meaning (both mental and physical) into their reality, thus creating things through language. In externalization, social actors create their social worlds and it is seen through action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Following that, reality becomes established by the products of externalization through the course of objectivation (things and ideas "harden" in a sense).&lt;ref name="Anchor" /&gt; People see either a social practice or institution as an objective reality that cannot be changed, such as something like language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, this newly-made, and man-made reality (or society) has an effect on humans themselves. In this third phase, internalization, the external, objective world to a person becomes part of their internal, subjective world.&lt;ref name="Anchor" /&gt; Social actors internalize norms and values, accepting them as givens, and make them our reality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Levels of socialization====

Subjectively, we experience first and second socialization into society. Firstly, we are socialized into the world during one's childhood by family members and friends. Secondly, we internalize institutional "sub worlds" during one's adulthood, put in various positions in the economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; We maintain our subjective world through reaffirmation with social interactions with others. Our identity and the society are seen as dialectically related: our identity is formed by social processes, which are in turn ordered by our society.&lt;ref name="Anchor" /&gt; Berger and Luckmann see socialization as very powerful and able to influence things such as sexual and nutritional choices. People have the ability to do whatever they want in these spheres, but socialization causes people to only choose certain sexual partners or certain foods to eat to satisfy biological needs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Humanistic perspective===

The humanistic perspective is generally outside of mainstream, contemporary sociology. It is considered as a view that relates more to the humanities – literature, philosophy – than to social science. Its ultimate purpose lies in freeing society of illusions to help make it more humane. In this sense, we are the "puppets of society," but sociology allows us to see the strings that we are attached to, which helps to free ourselves. Berger's "Invitation to Sociology" outlines his approach to the field of sociology in these humanistic terms. Methodologically, sociologists should attempt to understand and observe human behaviour outside the context of its social setting and free from whatever influence a sociologist's personal biases or feelings might be. The study of sociology, Berger posits, should be value-free. Research should be accrued in the same manner as the scientific method, using observation, hypothesis, testing, data, analysis and generalization. The meaning derived from the results of research should be contextualized with historical, cultural, environmental, or other important data.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=Invitation to Sociology: A Humanist Perspective|date=1963|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===View of sociology===
Berger saw the field of sociology as not only just a way to help people and the community, but sociological insights are also important to all people interested in instilling action in society. Sociologists are a part of a multitude of fields, not just social work. Berger stated that sociology is not a practice, but an attempt to understand the social world. These understandings could be used by people in any field for whatever purpose and with whatever moral implications. He believed that sociologists, even if their values varied greatly, should at the very least have scientific integrity. Sociologists are only humans and will still have to deal with things such as convictions, emotions, and prejudices, but being trained in sociology should learn to understand and control these things and try to eliminate them from their work. A sociologist's job is to accurately report on a certain social terrain. Sociology is a science, and its findings are found through observation of certain rules of evidence that allow people to repeat and continue to develop the findings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Religion and society ==

===Religion and the human problems of modernity===

Berger believed that society is made aware of what he referred to as the nomos, or the patterns a particular society wants its members to see as objectively right and to internalize. The nomos is all the society's knowledge about how things are, and all of its values and ways of living. This is upheld through legitimacy, either giving special meaning to these behaviors or by creating a structure of knowledge that enhances the plausibility of the nomos. The existence of an eternal cosmic entity that legitimizes a nomos makes the nomos itself eternal; an individual's actions within its set society are all based on a universal and orderly pattern based on their beliefs.&lt;ref name="The Sacred Canopy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=The Sacred Canopy|date=1969|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern pluralization, which has stemmed from the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, set forth a new set of values, including: separation of the religious and secular spheres of life, a person's wealth as a determinant of value, maximizing freedom to enhance wealth, increasing prediction and control to increase wealth, and identifying oneself as a member of a nation-state. This, in turn, spread capitalism and its ideals and beliefs of individualism and rationalization and separated Christians from their Gods. With globalization, even more beliefs and cultures were confronted with this.&lt;ref name="The Sacred Canopy"/&gt;

Berger believed that modernity – technological production paradigms of thinking and bureaucracy, namely – alienated the individual from primary institutions and forced individuals to create separate spheres of public and private life. There is no plausibility structure for any system of beliefs in the modern world; people are made to choose their own with no anchors to our own perceptions of reality. This lowers feelings of belonging and forces our own subjectivities onto themselves. Berger called this a "homelessness of the mind." It is the product of the modern world, he believed, as it has transformed the technology of production into our consciousness, making our cognition componential, always searching for a "means to an end." Ideas and beliefs are varied in the modern world, and an individual, not sharing their system of beliefs with the public whole, relegates any behaviors that are contingent on it to their private life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=The Homelessness of the Mind|date=1974|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain beliefs that an individual has that may not be widely accepted by society as a whole, are then kept to one's self and may only be seen within one's private life and are not seen by society.

The socialist myth, a non-pejorative term of Berger's, actually arises from intellectual leftism masking a need to resolve the lacking sense of community in the modern world through the promise to destroy the oppression of capitalism. Berger believed resolving community in modern society needs to emphasize the role of "mediating structures" in their lives to counter the alienation of modernity. Human existence in the age of modernity requires there to be structures like church, neighbourhood, and family to help establish a sense of belonging rooted in a commitment to values or beliefs. This builds a sense of community and belonging in an individual. In addition, these structures can serve a role in addressing larger social problems without the alienation that larger society creates. The role of mediating structures in civil society is both private and public, in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=Facing Up to Modernity|date=1977|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pluralism ===
The general meaning of pluralism is the coexistence, generally peaceful, of different religions, worldviews, and value systems within the same society. Berger believes pluralism exists in two ways. The first being that many religions and worldviews coexist in the same society. The second is the coexistence of the secular discourse with all these religious discourses. Some people avoid pluralism by only operating within their own secular or religious discourse, meaning they do not interact with others outside of their beliefs. Pluralism generally today is that it is globalized. Berger sees benefits in pluralism. One is that pluralism makes complete consensus in beliefs very rare, which allows people to form and hold their own beliefs without trying to conform to a society that holds all the same beliefs. This ties into the second benefit which is that pluralism gives freedom and allows people free decisions. Another benefit is that if pluralism is connected to religious freedom, religious institutions now become voluntary associations. Lastly, pluralism influences individual believers and religious communities to define the core of their faith separately from less central elements, which allows people to pick and choose certain aspects of their chosen form of belief that they may or may not agree with, while still remaining true to the central parts of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Peter L.|year=2016|title=The good of religious pluralism: Peter L. Berger outlines four benefits of pluralism|journal=First Things: A Monthly Journal of Religion and Public Life|volume=262|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transcendence ===

In daily life, people experience symbols and glimpses of existence beyond empirical order and of transcendent existence. Berger calls these "rumours of angels". People feel in times of great joy, in never-ending pursuit of order against chaos, in the existence of objective evil, and in the sense of hope that there exists some supernatural reality beyond that of human existence. People who choose to believe in the existence of a supernatural other require faith – a wager of belief against doubt – in the modern rationalised world. Knowledge can no longer sufficiently ground human belief in the pluralized world, forcing people to wager their own beliefs against the current of doubt in our society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=A Rumor of Angels: Modern Society and the Rediscovery of the Supernatural|date=1970|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secularization theory ===

Like most other sociologists of religion of his day, Berger once predicted the all-encompassing [[secularization]] of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Peter L.|title=The heretical imperative : contemporary possibilities of religious affirmation|year=1979|publisher=Anchor Press|location=Garden City, N.Y.|isbn=0-385-14286-2|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has admitted to his own miscalculations about secularization, concluding that the existence of resurgent religiosity in the modernised world has proven otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=Peter L.|title=The Secularism in Retreat|journal=The National Interest|year=1996|volume=46|url=http://csrs.nd.edu/assets/50014/secularism_in_retreat.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Desecularization of the World'', he cites both Western academia and Western Europe itself as exceptions to the triumphant desecularization hypothesis: that these cultures have remained highly secularized despite the resurgence of religion in the rest of the world. Berger finds that his and most sociologists' misconsensus about secularisation may have been the result of their own bias as members of academia, which is a largely atheist concentration of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=The Desecularization of the World: Resurgent Religion and World Politics|date=1999|publisher=Ethics and Policy Center|location=Grand Rapids, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical contributions==

In ''Making Sense of Modern Times: Peter L. Berger and the Vision of Interpretive Sociology'', [[James Davison Hunter]] and Stephen C. Ainlay build upon the social theories of Berger's. Hunter and Ainlay use Berger's ideologies as a foundation and framework for this particular book. Nicholas Abercrombie begins by examining his reformation of the sociology of knowledge. Shifting his focus on the subjective reality of everyday life, Berger enters a dialogue with traditional sociologies of knowledge – more specific, those of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Karl Mannheim]]. Abercrombie digs deeper into this dialogue Berger brings up, and he considers ways in which Berger goes beyond these figures. Stephen Ainlay then pursues the notable influence on Berger's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ainlay|first=Stephen C.|title=Making Sense of Modern Times: Peter L. Berger and the Vision of Interpretive Sociology|year=1986|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-7102-0826-X|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of sociology, Berger has been somewhat excluded from the mainstream; his humanistic perspective was denounced by much of the intellectual elite in the field, though it sold well over a million copies. Berger's leftist criticisms do not help him much in that regard either. Berger's theories on religion have held considerable weight in contemporary neoconservative and theological fields of thinking, however.&lt;ref name="Prometheus Books"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=Adventures of an Accidental Sociologist: How to Explain the World Without Becoming a Bore|date=2011|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, NY|isbn=978-1-61614-389-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Berger argued about the emergence of a new [[social class]] he called the "knowledge class". He views it as a result of what was known as the [[middle class]] into two groups: the "old middle class" of those who produce material goods and services and the "knowledge class" whose occupations relate to the production and distribution of "symbolic knowledge." He followed [[Helmut Schelsky]]'s definition of ''Sinn- und Hellsvermittler'', "agents (intemediaries) of meanings and purposes".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rt6tBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT118]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Berger's work was notably influenced by [[Max Weber]]. Weber focused on the empirical realities of rationality as a characteristic of action and rationalization. In comparison, Berger proposed the usage of the word 'options' rather than freedom as an empirical concept. Therefore, much of the empirical work of Berger and Weber have revolved around the relationship between modern rationalization and options for social action. Weber argued that [[rationalism]] can mean a variety of things at the subjective level of consciousness and at the objective level of social institutions. The connection between Berger's analysis of the sociology of religion in modern society and Max Weber's ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' aligns. Weber saw capitalism as a result of the Protestant secularisation of work ethic and morality in amassing wealth, which Berger integrates into his analysis about the effects of losing the non-secular foundations for belief about life's ultimate meaning.

Berger's own experiences teaching in North Carolina in the 1950s showed the shocking American prejudice of that era's Southern culture and influenced his humanistic perspective as a way to reveal the ideological forces from which it stemmed.&lt;ref name="Prometheus Books"/&gt;

==Honors==
Berger was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was doctor ''honoris causa'' of [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola University]], [[Wagner College]], the [[College of the Holy Cross]], the [[University of Notre Dame]], the [[University of Geneva]], and the [[University of Munich]], and an honorary member of many scientific associations.

In 2010, he was awarded the [[Dr. Leopold Lucas Prize]] by the [[University of Tübingen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seifert|first=Michael|title=Dr. Leopold Lucas-Preis 2010 geht an Peter L.

Near began his work at the [[VMFA]] in 1958, and, except for three years (1962-1965) when he did graduate work at [[Harvard]] and was a curator at the [[Cincinnati Art Museum]], he served at the VMFA in Richmond the remainder of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Merritt|first1=Robert|title=Curator left lasting mark|work=art critic|issue=March 30, 1990|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years, when the museum was run by a director and a curator with a small staff, Near became the first full-time curator of the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]], one of the first state-supported art museums in the United States.

Pinkney Near died August 29, 1990 of pneumonia at a hospital in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], where he and his wife were visiting relatives. He was 63. His memorial service was held at [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Richmond, Virginia|St. Paul's Episcopal Church]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond,Virginia]], where he lived.&lt;ref name=obit /&gt;

==Curator of the [[Cincinnati Museum of Art]]==
In 1964 Pinkney Near, curator of paintings, selected American paintings for the Cincinnati Museum's survey exhibition, ranging from early painters such as [[John Trumbull]], [[Gilbert Stuart]], and [[Washington Allston]] to later painters [[John Marin]], [[Max Weber]], [[George Bellows]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[Robert Vickrey]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Mark Tobey]], [[Jane Freilicher]], [[Milton Avery]], and [[Tom Wesselmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Darrack|first1=Arthur|title=American Painting Surveyed in Great Style at Museum Show|website=Newspapers.com|publisher=Cincinnati Enquirer|location=Cincinnati Enquirer, Kentucky edition|page=80|date=April 5, 1964|quote=He [Pinkney Near] has done a superb job of selection and I cannot recall a more interesting panorama of American painting.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curator of the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]==
Pinkney Near first came to the VMFA in 1954 for a brief visit, when he had just returned from Paris where he studied Romanesque sculpture with his Fulbright Scholarship. A year later, in 1955 he left the museum for a Sachs fellowship which sponsored further study in Europe. However, it was during this brief stay that he began the evolution of the Collections Division, and, when he returned in 1956 at the age of 29, he became curatorial assistant at the museum. Two years later he was promoted to curator but decided to pursue his graduate work at Harvard. When he returned, he became Chief Curator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hiring of chief curator marked start of Collections Division|publisher=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=January 12, 1986|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pinkney Near served as VMFA curator for 30 years, much of that time as chief administrative curator. In 1988 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Va. Museum chooses curator for Mellon Collection|publisher=The Richmond Afro-American|date=December 24, 1988|location=Richmond, Virginia|page=A6|quote="In selecting Mr. Near to be the first holder of this prestigious title, Mr. Mellon has recognized Mr. Near's lifelong commitment to scholarship and connoisseurship," says Paul N. Perrot, director of the museum.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near was named to the newly created post of Paul Mellon Curator and senior research curator, a post in which he worked closely with the Mellon Collection and with [[Paul Mellon]], who provided important gifts of art, both paintings and sculpture portraying animals, to the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond Times-Dispatch, September 30, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-09-20/news/1990263193_1_pinkney-paul-episcopal-church-rebecca-n&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the years Near acquired for the museum some of its greatest treasures, including paintings by [[Théodore Géricault]], [[Claude Lorraine]]'s "Battle on a Bridge," [[Aristide Maillol]]'s "The River," [[Claude Monet]]'s "Irises by the Pond," [[Charles Willson Peale]]'s "William Smith and His Grandson," [[Angelica Kauffmann]]'s "Cornelia Pointing to Her Children as Her Treasures," and [[Jean-Baptiste Belin|Jean-Bapiste Blin de Fontenay]]'s monumental "Buffet Under a Trellis."

In 1976 Near announced the [[VMFA|VMFA's]] purchase of American sculptor [[Isamu Noguchi|Isamu Noguchi's]] polished stainless steel sculpture "Open Lock," completed in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Virginia Museum Acquires Sculpture by Isamu Noguchi|publisher=The Danville Register|date=August 9, 1976|location=Danville, Virginia|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the exhibits curated by Near was one called ''Three Masters of Landscape: Fragonard, Robert and Boucher'' which, although small, presented interesting issues due to the variability of the works. The exhibit made use of a recently acquired Fragonard entitled ''Landscape With Three Washerwomen".&lt;ref name=nyt1981&gt;{{cite news |title=Gallery View; THREE FRENCH LANDSCAPISTS WITH A COMMON VISION; RICHMOND, Va.|publisher=New York Times|date=November 29, 1981|first=John |last=Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and publications==
Pinkney Near wrote ''The Whistlers:A Family Reunion'', published in 1965 by the [[Cincinnati Museum of Art]], followed in 1981 by ''Three Masters of Landscape: Fragonard, Robert, and Boucher'', which was published by the [[Virginia Museum of Fine Arts]]. While at the [[VMFA]], the museum also published his book ''Apollo''. In 1985, his book ''French Paintings'' was published by the [[University of Virginia Press]].

Near, along with two other art experts, [[Julien Binford]] (professor emeritus at [[Mary Washington College]] in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]) and William Campbell (Curator of American Paintings at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington) selected the paintings by the deceased artist [[Gari Melchers]] for permanent display in the Gari Melchers Memorial Gallery at Belmont, the [[Falmouth, Virginia]] home of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Culbertson|first1=Drena|title=Final Melchers Collection selection is due this week|publisher=The Free Lance Star|date=July 26, 1976|location=Fredericksburg, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an author of many of the VMFA exhibition catalogs and illustrated books including ''French Paintings: The Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Paul Mellon''.

The '''portraiture of Elizabeth I of England''' illustrates the evolution of English royal [[portrait]]s in the [[Early Modern period]] from the representations of simple likenesses to the later complex imagery used to convey the power and aspirations of the state, as well as of the monarch at its head.

Even the earliest portraits of [[Elizabeth I]] (1533–1603) contain [[symbol]]ic objects such as [[rose]]s and prayer books that would have carried meaning to viewers of her day. Later portraits of Elizabeth layer the [[iconography]] of [[empire]]—[[globe]]s, [[Crown (headgear)|crowns]], [[sword]]s and [[column]]s—and representations of [[virginity]] and purity—such as [[moon]]s and [[pearl]]s—with [[Classical antiquity|classical]] allusions to present a complex "story" that conveyed to [[Elizabethan era]] viewers the majesty and significance of their Virgin Queen.

==Overview==

===Portraiture in Tudor England===
{{Main|Artists of the Tudor court}}
Two portraiture traditions had arisen in the Tudor court since the days of Elizabeth's father, [[Henry VIII]].  The [[portrait miniature]] developed from the [[illuminated manuscript]] tradition.  These small personal images were almost invariably painted from life over the space of a few days in [[watercolour]]s on [[vellum]] stiffened by being glued to a [[playing card]]. [[Panel painting]]s in [[oil painting|oils]] on prepared wood surfaces were based on preparatory drawings and were usually executed at life size, as were oil paintings on canvas.

Unlike her contemporaries in France, Elizabeth never granted rights to produce her portrait to a single artist, although [[Nicholas Hilliard]] was appointed her official [[limning|limner]] or miniaturist and goldsmith. [[George Gower]], a fashionable court portraitist created [[Serjeant Painter]] in 1581, was responsible for approving all portraits of the queen created by other artists from that date until his death in 1596.&lt;ref name="GI"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Elizabeth sat to a number of artists over the years, including Hilliard, [[Cornelis Ketel]], [[Federico Zuccari|Federico Zuccaro or Zuccari]], [[Isaac Oliver]], and most likely to Gower and [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]].&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt;

Portraits were commissioned by the government as gifts to foreign monarchs and to show to prospective suitors.  Courtiers commissioned heavily symbolic paintings to demonstrate their devotion to the queen.  The fashionable [[long gallery|long galleries]] of later Elizabethan [[country house]]s were filled with sets of portraits.  The studios of Tudor artists produced images of Elizabeth working from approved "face patterns" or drawings of the queen to meet this growing demand for her image, an important symbol of loyalty and reverence for the crown in times of turbulence.&lt;ref name="GI" /&gt;

===European context===
Far the most impressive models available to English portraitists were the many portraits by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], the outstanding Northern portraitist of the first half of the century, who had made two lengthy visits to England and been Henry VIII's court artist.  Holbein had accustomed the English court to the full-length life-size portrait,&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 25–6.  This was in notable contrast to France, in particular, where smaller portraits remained more typical until [[Henry IV of France]] came to power in 1594.&lt;/ref&gt; although none of his originals now survive.  His great [[Whitehall Mural|dynastic mural]] at [[Whitehall Palace]], destroyed in 1698, and perhaps other original large portraits, would have been familiar to Elizabethan artists.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Remigius van Leemput 001.jpg|image of a copy]] Waterhouse:19–22, who points out that only very high ranking persons could enter the room where it was when the court was in residence at Whitehall.  But artists could probably have gained access during the long periods the monarch was elsewhere; certainly there are many apparent copies of the figure of Henry from this work.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Holbein and his great Italian contemporary [[Titian]] had combined great psychological penetration with a sufficiently majestic impression to satisfy their royal patrons.  By his second visit Holbein was already moving away from a strictly realist depiction; in his ''[[Jane Seymour]]'' "the figure is no longer seen as displacing with its bulk a recognizable section of space: it approaches rather to a flat pattern, made alive by a bounding and vital outline".&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse:19&lt;/ref&gt;  This tendency was to be taken much further by the later portraits of Elizabeth, where "Likeness of feature and an interest in form and volume have gradually been abandoned in favour of an effect of splendid majesty obtained by decorative pattern, and the forms have been flattened accordingly".&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Titian continued to paint royal portraits, especially of [[Philip II of Spain]], until the 1570s, but in sharply reduced numbers after about 1555, and he refused to travel from Venice to do them.&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Jennifer in: David Jaffé (ed), ''Titian'', pp. 31–2, The National Gallery Company/Yale, London 2003, {{ISBN|1-85709-903-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The full-length portrait of Philip (1550–51) now in the [[Prado]] was sent to Elizabeth's elder sister and predecessor [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] in advance of their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[[:Image:Tizian 084.jpg|Image]] It came from Philip's aunt [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary]] in Brussels, presumably as a loan. Fletcher, op. cit. pp. 31 and 148.  It was presumably returned by or after Mary I's death in 1558, as it is in a Spanish royal inventory of 1600.  Prado:398–99 (#411). The painting has returned to London for an exhibition at the National Gallery until January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the mid-century the most influential Continental courts came to prefer less revealing and intimate works,&lt;ref&gt;For analysis of this trend see Levey (1971, Ch. 3, and Trevor-Roper (1976) Ch. 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the mid-century the two most prominent and influential royal portraitists in paint, other than Titian, were the Netherlandish [[Anthonis Mor]] and [[Agnolo Bronzino]] in [[Florence]], besides whom the Habsburg court sculptor and medallist [[Leone Leoni]] should also be mentioned.  Mor, who had risen rapidly to prominence in 1540s, worked across Europe for the Habsburgs in a tighter and more rigid version of Titian's compositional manner, drawing also on the North Italian style of [[Moretto da Brescia|Moretto]].&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), pp. 27–8. For his relationship with the Habsburgs, see Trevor-Roper (1976) passim, who also covers those of Leone Leoni and Titian in detail.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mor had actually visited London in 1554, and painted three versions of his well-known portrait of Queen Mary; he also painted English courtiers who visited Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Waterhouse (1978), p. 28. Surviving portraits include those of [[Sir Thomas Gresham]] and [[Sir Henry Lee]], who was later to commission the ''Ditchley Portrait''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mor's Spanish pupil [[Alonso Sánchez Coello]] continued in a stiffer version of his master's style, replacing him  as Spanish court painter in 1561.  [[Sofonisba Anguissola]] had painted in an intimately informal style, but after her recruitment to the Spanish court as the Queen's painter in 1560 was able to adapt her style to the much more formal demands of state portraiture.  Moretto's pupil [[Giovanni Battista Moroni]] was Mor's contemporary and formed his mature style in the 1550s, but few of his spirited portraits were of royalty, or yet to be seen outside Italy.&lt;ref&gt;And even in Italy his best portraits were routinely attributed to Titian or Moretto, for example what has always been his most famous work, the so-called ''Titian's Schoolmaster'', now in Washington but previously in the [[Palazzo Borghese]] in Rome.  Penny:194–5 on his life and style, 196–7 on his reputation. Freedberg (1993), pp. 593–5 analyses his portrait style.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bronzino]] developed a style of coldly distant magnificence, based on the [[Mannerist]] portraits of [[Pontormo]], working almost entirely for [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]], the first Medici Grand-Duke.&lt;ref&gt;In an extended discussion, [[Michael Levey]] says Bronzino showed the ducal family "so wrought and congealed that there is nothing of living tissue left in them. Their hands have turned to ivory, and their eyes to pieces of beautifully cut, faceted jet." Levey (1971), pp. 96–108 — quotation from p. 108.  See also Freedberg (1993), pp. 430–35&lt;/ref&gt;  Bronzino's works, including his striking portraits of Cosimo's Duchess, [[Eleanor of Toledo]] were distributed in many versions across Europe, continuing to be made for two decades from the same studio pattern; a new portrait painted in her last years, about 1560, exists in only a few repetitions.  At the least many of the foreign painters in London are likely to have seen versions of the earlier type, and there may well have been one in the [[Royal Collection]].

French portraiture remained dominated by small but finely drawn bust-length or half-length works, including many drawings, often with colour, by [[François Clouet]] following, with a host of imitators, his father [[Jean Clouet|Jean]], or even smaller oils by the Netherlandish [[Corneille de Lyon]] and his followers, typically no taller than a paperback book.  A few full-length portraits of royalty were produced, dependent on German or Italian models.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, pp. 62–64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creating the royal image===
[[File:El bieta I lat 13.jpg|thumb|upright|''Elizabeth Tudor as a Princess'', c. 1546, by an unknown artist.]]
William Gaunt contrasts the simplicity of the 1546 portrait of ''Elizabeth Tudor as a Princess'' with later images of her as queen.  He wrote, "The painter...is unknown, but in a competently Flemish style he depicts the daughter of [[Anne Boleyn]] as quiet and studious-looking, ornament in her attire as secondary to the plainness of line that emphasizes her youth. Great is the contrast with the awesome fantasy of the later portraits: the pallid, mask-like features, the extravagance of headdress and ruff, the padded ornateness that seemed to exclude all humanity."&lt;ref&gt;Gaunt, 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of emphasis given to depicting depth and volume in her later portraits may have been influenced by the Queen's own views. In the ''Art of Limming'' Hilliard cautioned against all but the minimal use of [[chiaroscuro]] modelling that we see in his works, reflecting the views of his patron: "seeing that best to show oneself needeth no shadow of place but rather the open light...Her Majesty..chose her place to sit for that purpose in the open alley of a goodly garden, where no tree was near, nor any shadow at all..."&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from Hilliard's ''Art of Limming'', c. 1600, in ''Nicholas Hilliard'', [[Roy Strong]], 1975, p.24, Michael Joseph Ltd, London, {{ISBN|0-7181-1301-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1570s, the government sought to manipulate the image of the queen as an object of devotion and veneration.  Sir [[Roy Strong]] writes: "The cult of Gloriana was skilfully created to buttress public order and, even more, deliberately to replace the pre-[[English Reformation|Reformation]] externals of religion, the cult of the [[Virgin Mary|Virgin]] and [[saint]]s with their attendant images, processions, ceremonies and secular rejoicing."&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1977, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;  The pageantry of the [[Accession Day tilt]]s, the poetry of the court, and the most iconic of Elizabeth's portraits all reflect this effort.  The management of the queen's image reached its heights in the last decade of the reign, when realistic images of the aging queen were replaced with an eternally youthful vision defying the reality of the passage of time.

==Early portraits==

===The young queen===
Portraits of the young queen, many of them likely painted to be shown to prospective suitors and foreign heads of state, show a naturalness and restraint similar to those in the portrait of Elizabeth as a princess.
[[File:Elizabeth I Steven Van Der Meulen.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Hampden Portrait'' of Elizabeth I, by Van Der Meulen, 1560s]]

The full-length ''Hampden'' image of Elizabeth in a red satin gown by [[Steven van der Meulen]] has been identified by Sir Roy Strong as an important early portrait, "undertaken at a time when her image was being tightly controlled. 'This is a portrait dating from the mid to late 1560s, one of a group produced in response to a crisis over the production of the royal image, one which was reflected in the words of a draft proclamation dated 1563,' he said."&lt;ref name="IND"&gt;"[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20071101/ai_n21092731 Portrait of a royal quest for a husband]". ''The Independent'', (London), Nov 1, 2007. Retrieved on 24 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The draft proclamation (never published) was a response to the circulation of poorly made portraits in which Elizabeth is shown "in blacke with a [[French hood|hoode and cornet]]", a style she no longer wore.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In these portraits Elizabeth may be wearing [[mourning]] for her sister Mary; see commentary on a portrait ([[:Image:Mary Queen of Scots French School c 1558-60.jpg|Image]]) of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] in a similar black gown and French hood with the cornet or ''bongrace'' pinned up at {{cite web|url=http://www.historicalportraits.com/InternalMain.asp |title=Mary Queen of Scots (1542 - 1587) c. 1558 |work=Historical Portraits Image Library |accessdate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016154526/http://www.historicalportraits.com/InternalMain.asp |archivedate=2008-10-16 |df= }}, where the costume is compared to Elizabeth's in the ''Clopton'' portrait type.&lt;/ref&gt;  Symbolism in these pictures is in keeping with earlier Tudor portraiture; in some Elizabeth holds a book (possibly a prayer book) suggesting studiousness or piety. In other paintings she holds or wears a red rose, symbol of the [[Tudor Dynasty]]'s descent from the [[House of Lancaster]], or white roses, symbols of the [[House of York]] and of maidenly chastity.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Hampden portrait, Elizabeth wears a red rose on her shoulder and holds a [[gillyflower]] in her hand.  Of this image, Strong says "'Here Elizabeth is caught in that short-lived period before what was a recognisable human became transmuted into a goddess'."&lt;ref name="IND" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This newly revealed portrait was sold at Sotheby's, London, for £2.6 million in November 2007.[https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSL2246809920071122?sp=true Reuters news story]&lt;/ref&gt;

One artist active in Elizabeth's early court was the [[Flanders|Flemish]] miniaturist [[Levina Teerlinc]] who had served as a painter and [[gentlewoman]] to [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and stayed on as a Gentlewoman of the Privy Chamber to Elizabeth. Teerlinc is best known for her pivotal position in the rise of the portrait miniature. There is documentation that she created numerous portraits of Elizabeth I, both individual portraits and portraits of the sovereign with important court figures, but only a few of these have survived and been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 55–57&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elizabeth and the goddesses===
[[File:Eworth Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses 1569.jpg|thumb|''Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses'', 1569]] Two surviving [[allegory|allegorical]] paintings show the early use of classical mythology to illustrate the beauty and sovereignty of the young queen.  In ''Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses'' (1569), attributed to [[Hans Eworth]],&lt;ref&gt;The portrait is signed "H.E." and the artist formerly identified as the "Monogrammist H.E." is now generally assumed to be Hans Eworth (Hearn 1995, p. 63). Strong had earlier attributed the painting to [[Joris Hoefnagel]] (Strong 1987, p. 42).&lt;/ref&gt; the story of the [[Judgement of Paris]] is turned on its head.  Elizabeth, rather than Paris, is now sent to choose among [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], and [[Athena|Pallas-Minerva]], all of whom are outshone by the queen with her crown and royal [[Globus cruciger|orb]].  As Susan Doran writes, "Implicit to the theme of the painting ... is the idea that Elizabeth's retention of royal power benefits her realm. Whereas Paris's judgement in the original myth resulted in the long [[Trojan War]]s 'to the utter ruin of the Trojans', hers will conversely bring peace and order to the state"&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; after the turbulent reign of Elizabeth's sister [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].

The latter theme lies behind the 1572 ''The Family of Henry VIII: An Allegory of the Tudor Succession'' (attributed to [[Lucas de Heere]]).  In this image, [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] Mary and her husband [[Philip II of Spain]] are accompanied by [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] the god of War on the left, while Protestant Elizabeth on the right ushers in the goddesses Peace and Plenty.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn 1995, pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; An inscription states that this painting was a gift from the queen to [[Francis Walsingham]] as a "Mark of her people's and her own content" and this may indicate that it commemorates the signing of the [[Treaty of Blois (1572)]] which established an alliance between England and France against Spanish aggression in the [[Spanish Netherlands|Netherlands]] during Walsingham's tour of duty as ambassador to the French court.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, pp.185–86&lt;/ref&gt;  Strong identifies both paintings as celebrations of Elizabeth's just rule by Flemish exiles to whom England was a refuge from the religious persecution of Protestants in the Spanish Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hilliard and the queen===

Nicholas Hilliard was an apprentice to the Queen's jeweller Robert Brandon,&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; a goldsmith and city chamberlain of London, and Sir Roy Strong suggests that Hilliard may also have been trained in the art of limning by Levina Teerlinc.&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; Hilliard emerged from his apprenticeship at a time when a new royal portrait painter was "desperately needed."&lt;ref name="G"&gt;Strong 1987, p. 79–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilliard's first known miniature of the Queen is dated 1572. It is not known when he was formally appointed limner (miniaturist) and goldsmith to Elizabeth,&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, ''Hilliard and Oliver'', pp. 11–18&lt;/ref&gt; though he was granted the reversion of a lease by the Queen in 1573 for his "good, true and loyal service."&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1975, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Two panel portraits long attributed to him, the ''Phoenix'' and ''Pelican'' portraits, are dated c. 1572–76.  These paintings are named after the jewels the queen wears, her personal badges of the [[Pelican#Symbolism and culture|pelican in her piety]] and the [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]].  National Portrait Gallery researchers announced in September 2010 that the two portraits were painted on wood from the same two trees. They also found that a tracing of the Phoenix portrait matches the Pelican portrait in reverse. They therefore deduce that both pictures of Elizabeth in her forties were painted around the same time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11277451  Pelican and Phoenix research]&lt;/ref&gt;

But Hilliard's panel portraits seem to have been found wanting, and in 1576 the recently married Hilliard left for France to improve his skills.  Returning to England, he continued to work as a goldsmith, and produced some spectacular "picture boxes" or jewelled lockets for miniatures: the ''Armada Jewel'', given by Elizabeth to Sir [[Thomas Heneage]] and the ''Drake Pendant'' given to Sir [[Francis Drake]] are the best known examples.  As part of the cult of the Virgin Queen, courtiers were rather expected to wear the Queen's likeness, at least at Court.

His appointment as miniaturist to the Crown included the old sense of a painter of [[illuminated manuscript]]s and he was commissioned to decorate important documents, such as the founding [[charter]] of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] (1584), which has an enthroned Elizabeth under a [[Baldachin|canopy of estate]] within an elaborate framework of Flemish-style Renaissance strapwork and [[grotesque]] ornament.  He also seems to have designed [[woodcut]] title-page frames and borders for books, some of which bear his initials.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 1983, pp. 62 &amp; 66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Darnley stage 3.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The ''Darnley Portrait'', c. 1575]]

===The Darnley Portrait===
The problem of an official portrait of Elizabeth was solved with the ''Darnley  Portrait''.&lt;ref&gt;So-called from its location at [[Cobham House]], much later the seat of the [[Earls of Darnley]]; see Strong 1987 p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Likely painted from life around 1575–6, this portrait is the source of a face pattern which would be used and reused for authorized portraits of Elizabeth into the 1590s, preserving the impression of ageless beauty.  Sir [[Roy Strong]] suggested that the artist is [[Federico Zuccari]] or Zucaro, an "eminent" Italian artist, though not really a specialist portrait-painter, who is known to have visited the court briefly with a letter of introduction to Elizabeth's [[favourite]] [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester]] dated 5 March 1575.&lt;ref name="G2"&gt;Strong 1987, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; Zuccaro's preparatory drawings for full-length portraits of both Leicester and Elizabeth survive, although it is unlikely the full-length of Elizabeth was ever painted.&lt;ref name="G2" /&gt;  Curators at the National Portrait Gallery believe that the attribution of the Darnley portrait to Zuccaro is "not sustainable" and attribute the work to an unknown "continental" (possibly Netherlandish) artist.&lt;ref name="Real Tudors"&gt;Cooper and Bolland (2014), p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Darnley Portrait'' features a crown and [[sceptre]] on a table beside the queen, and was the first appearance of these symbols of sovereignty separately used as [[Theatrical property|props]] (rather than worn and carried) in Tudor portraiture, a theme that would be expanded in later portraits.&lt;ref name="G2" /&gt;  Recent conservation work has revealed that Elizabeth's now-iconic pale complexion in this portrait is the result of deterioration of [[Red#Pigments and dyes|red lake pigments]], which has also altered the coloring of her dress.&lt;ref name="Real Tudors2"&gt;Cooper and Bolland (2014), pp. 162-167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Making Art"&gt;{{cite web|author = National Portrait Gallery |title = Making Art in Tudor Britain: 'Darnley' portrait | url = http://www.npg.org.uk/research/programmes/making-art-in-tudor-britain/case-studies/the-queens-likeness-portraits-of-elizabeth-i.php#darnleyportrait |year = 2014 | accessdate = 28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Virgin Empress of the Seas==

===Return of the Golden Age===
[[File:Elizabeth1England.jpg|thumb|The ''Ermine Portrait'', William Segar, 1585. Elizabeth as ''Pax''.]]
The [[excommunication]] of Elizabeth by [[Pope Pius V]] in 1570 led to increased tension with Philip II of Spain, who championed the Catholic [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], as the legitimate heir of his late wife Mary I.  This tension played out over the next decades in the seas of the [[New World]] as well as in Europe, and culminated in the invasion attempt of the [[Spanish Armada]].

It is against this backdrop that the first of a long series of portraits appears depicting Elizabeth with heavy symbolic overlays of imperial dominion based on mastery of the seas.&lt;ref name="G3"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 91–93&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with a second layer of symbolism representing Elizabeth as the Virgin Queen, these new paintings signify the manipulation of Elizabeth's image as the destined [[Protestant]] protector of her people.

Strong points out that there is no trace of this iconography in portraits of Elizabeth prior to 1579, and identifies its source as the conscious image-making of [[John Dee]], whose 1577 ''General and Rare Memorials Pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation'' encouraged the establishment of a British Empire supported by a strong navy, asserting Elizabeth's claims to imperial status via her supposed descent from [[Brutus of Troy]] and [[King Arthur]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Dee's inspiration lies in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s ''[[History of the Kings of Britain]]'', which was accepted as true history by Elizabethan poets{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} and formed the basis of the symbolic history of England.  In this twelfth century [[pseudohistory]], Britain was founded by and named after Brutus, the descendent of [[Aeneas]] who founded Rome.  The Tudors, of [[Wales|Welsh]] descent, are heirs of the most ancient Britons and thus of Aeneas and Brutus.  By uniting the Houses of York and Lancaster following the strife of the [[Wars of the Roses]], the Tudors ushered in a united realm where ''[[Pax (mythology)|Pax]]'' reigned.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Spenserian scholar Edwin  Greenlaw states "The descent of the Britons from the Trojans, the linking of Arthur, Henry VIII, and Elizabeth as Britain's greatest monarchs, and the return under Elizabeth of the [[Golden Age]] are all commonplaces of Elizabethan thought."&lt;ref&gt;E[dwin] Greenlaw, ''Studies in Spenser's Historical Allegory,'' Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press, 1932, quoted in Yates, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; This understanding of history and Elizabeth's place in it forms the background to the symbolic portraits of the latter half of her reign.

===The Virgin Queen===
[[File:George Gower Elizabeth Sieve Portrait.jpg|left|thumb|upright|The [[Plimpton Sieve Portrait of Queen Elizabeth I|Plimpton ''Sieve Portrait'']], Gower, 1579]]

A series of ''Sieve Portraits'' copy the ''Darnley'' face pattern and add an allegorical overlay that depicts Elizabeth as [[Tuccia]], a [[Vestal Virgin]] who proved her chastity by carrying a sieve full of water from the [[Tiber River]] to the [[Temple of Vesta]] without spilling a drop.&lt;ref&gt;See Hearn 1995, p. 85; Strong 1987, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; The first ''Sieve Portrait'' was painted by [[George Gower]] in 1579, but the most influential image is the 1583 version by [[Quentin Metsys the Younger|Quentin Metsys (or Massys) the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;Although Strong attributed the painting to [[Cornelis Ketel]] in 1969 and again in 1987 (Strong 1987 p. 101), closer examination has revealed that the painting is signed and dated on the base of the globe ''1583. Q. MASSYS | ANT'' (for "of Antwerp"). (See Hearn 1995, p. 85)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Metsys Elizabeth I The Sieve Portrait c1583.jpg|thumb|upright|The Siena ''Sieve Portrait'', Metsys the Younger, 1583]]

In the Metsys version, Elizabeth is surrounded by symbols of empire, including a column and a globe, iconography that would appear again and again in her portraiture of the 1580s and 1590s, most notably in the ''Armada Portrait'' of c. 1588.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, p. 85; Strong 1987 p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;  The medallions on the pillar to the left of the queen illustrate the story  of [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]] and Aeneas, ancestor of Brutus, suggesting that like Aeneas, Elizabeth's destiny is to reject marriage and found an empire.  This painting's patron was likely Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] (his [[heraldic badge]] of the white hind appears on the sleeve of one of the courtiers in the background), and the work may express opposition to the proposed marriage of Elizabeth to [[François, Duke of Anjou]].&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003b, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yates, p. 115"&gt;Yates, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The virgin Tuccia was familiar to Elizabethan readers from [[Petrarch]]'s "The Triumph of Chastity".  Another symbol from this work is the spotless [[ermine]], wearing a collar of gold studded with topazes.&lt;ref&gt;Yates pp. 115, 215–216&lt;/ref&gt; This symbol of purity appears in the ''Ermine Portrait'' of 1585, attributed to the [[herald]] [[William Segar]].  The queen bears the olive branch of ''Pax'' (Peace), and the sword of justice rests on the table at her side.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;  In combination, these symbols represent not only the personal purity of Elizabeth but the "righteousness and justice of her government."&lt;ref&gt;Yates, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visions of empire===
{{Main|Armada Portrait}}
[[File:Elizabeth I (Armada Portrait).jpg|thumb|upright|The Woburn Abbey version of the ''Armada Portrait'', c. 1588]]
The ''[[Armada Portrait]]'' is an [[allegory|allegorical]] panel painting depicting the queen surrounded by symbols of empire against a backdrop representing the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588.

There are three surviving versions of the portrait, in addition to several derivative paintings.  The version at [[Woburn Abbey]], the seat of the [[Duke of Bedford|Dukes of Bedford]], was long accepted as the work of George Gower, who had been appointed [[Serjeant Painter]] in 1581.&lt;ref name="GLORIANA"&gt;Strong 1987, ''Gloriana'', p. 130–133&lt;/ref&gt;  A version in the [[National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom)|National Portrait Gallery, London]], which has been cut down at both sides leaving just a portrait of the queen, was also formerly attributed to Gower.  A third version, owned by the Tyrwhitt-Drake family, may have been commissioned by Sir [[Francis Drake]]. Scholars agree that this version is by a different hand, noting distinctive techniques and approaches to the modelling of the queen's features.&lt;ref name="GLORIANA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="H"&gt;Hearn 1995 p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This version was heavily overpainted in the later 17th century, which complicates attribution and may account for several differences in details of the costume.  See  Arnold, ''Queen Elizabeth's Wardrobe Unlock'd'', pp. 34–36&lt;/ref&gt; Curators now believe that the three extant versions are all the output of different workshops under the direction of unknown English artists.&lt;ref name="Real Tudors3"&gt;Cooper and Bolland (2014), pp. 151-154&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of a life-sized portrait of the queen with a horizontal format is "quite unprecedented in her portraiture",&lt;ref name="GLORIANA" /&gt; although allegorical portraits in a horizontal format, such as ''Elizabeth I and the Three Goddesses'' and the ''Family of Henry VIII: An Allegory of the Tudor Succession'' pre-date the ''Armada Portrait''.
[[File:Elizabeth I Crispin van de Passe 1596.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Engraving by Crispijn van de Passe, printed 1596]]
The queen's hand rests on a globe below the crown of England, "her fingers covering the Americas, indicating England's dominion of the seas and plans for imperialist expansion in the New World".&lt;ref&gt;Hearn 1995, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B"&gt;Andrew Belsey and [[Catherine Belsey]], "Icons of Divinity: Portraits of Elizabeth I" in Gent and Llewellyen, ''Renaissance Bodies'', pp. 11–35&lt;/ref&gt;  The Queen is flanked by two columns behind, probably a reference to the famous [[personal device|impresa]] of the [[Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V]], Philip II of Spain's father, which represented the [[pillars of Hercules]], gateway to the Atlantic Ocean and the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1984, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

In the background view on the left, English [[fireship]]s threaten the Spanish fleet, and on the right the ships are driven onto a rocky coast amid stormy seas by the "[[Protestant Wind]]". On a secondary level, these images show Elizabeth turning her back on storm and darkness while sunlight shines where she gazes.&lt;ref name="GLORIANA" /&gt;

An engraving by [[Crispijn van de Passe]] (Crispin van de Passe), published in 1596 but showing costume of the 1580s, carries similar iconography.  Elizabeth stands between two columns bearing her arms and the Tudor [[heraldic badge]] of a [[portcullis]].  The columns are surmounted by her emblems of a pelican in her piety and a phoenix, and ships fill the sea behind her.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===The cult of Elizabeth===
[[File:Queen Elizabeth I ('The Ditchley portrait') by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger.jpg|upright|thumb|The ''Ditchley Portrait'', [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]], c.1592]]
The various threads of mythology and symbolism that created the iconography of Elizabeth I combined into a tapestry of immense complexity in the years following the defeat of the Spanish Armada.  In poetry, portraiture and pageantry, the queen was celebrated as [[Astraea (mythology)|Astraea]], the just virgin, and simultaneously as [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the goddess of love.  Another exaltation of the queen's virgin purity identified her with the moon goddess who holds dominion over the waters.  Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] had begun to use [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] and later [[Artemis#Worship of Artemis|Cynthia]] as aliases for the queen in his poetry around 1580, and images of Elizabeth with jewels in the shape of crescent moons or the huntress's arrows begin to appear in portraiture around 1586 and multiply through the remainder of the reign.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 125–127&lt;/ref&gt;  Courtiers wore the image of the Queen to signify their devotion, and had their portraits painted wearing her colours of black and white.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1977, pp. 70–75&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Ditchley Portrait'' seems to have always been at the Oxfordshire home of Elizabeth's retired Champion, Sir [[Henry Lee of Ditchley]], and likely was painted for (or commemorates)  her two-day visit to Ditchley in 1592. The painting is attributed to Marcus Gheerearts the Younger, and was almost certainly based on a sitting arranged by Lee, who was the painter's patron.  In this image, the queen stands on a map of England, her feet on Oxfordshire.  The painting has been trimmed and the background poorly repainted, so that the inscription and sonnet are incomplete.  Storms rage behind her while the sun shines before her, and she wears a jewel in the form of a celestial or [[armillary sphere]] close to her left ear.  Many versions of this painting were made, likely in Gheeraerts' workshop, with the allegorical items removed and Elizabeth's features "softened" from the stark realism of her face in the original.  One of these was sent as a [[diplomatic gift]] to the [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke of Tuscany]] and is now in the [[Palazzo Pitti]].&lt;ref name="MG"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 135–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The last sitting and the Mask of Youth===
[[File:Isaac Oliver Elizabeth I of England.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Unfinished miniature, Oliver, c. 1592]]
[[File:Nicholas Hilliard Elizabeth I 1595-1600 v2.jpg|upright|thumb|Recently discovered miniature by Hilliard, 1595–1600]]
Around 1592, the queen also sat to Isaac Oliver, a pupil of Hilliard, who produced an unfinished portrait miniature (left) used as a pattern for [[engraving]]s of the queen.  Only a single finished miniature from this pattern survives, with the queen's features softened, and Strong concludes that this realistic image from life of the aging Elizabeth was not deemed a success.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 1590s, woodcuts and engravings of the queen were created as book illustrations, but in this decade individual prints of the queen first appear, based on the Oliver face pattern.  In 1596, the Privy Council ordered that unseemly portraits of the queen which had caused her "great offence" should be sought out and burnt, and Strong suggest that these prints, of which comparatively few survive, may be the offending images.  Strong writes "It must have been exposure to the searching realism of both Gheeraerts and Oliver that provoked the decision to suppress all likenesses of the queen that depicted her as being in any way old and hence subject to mortality."&lt;ref name="Mask"&gt;Strong 1987, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

In any event, no surviving portraits dated between 1596 and Elizabeth's death in 1603 show the aging queen as she truly was.  Faithful resemblance to the original is only to be found in contemporaries’ accounts as in the report written in 1597 by André Hurault de Maisse, Ambassador Extraordinary from [[Henry IV of France]], after an audience with the sixty-five year-old queen, during which he noticed, "her teeth are very yellow and unequal […] and on the left side less than on the right. Many of them are missing, so that one cannot understand her easily when she speaks quickly." Yet he added, "her figure is fair and tall and graceful in whatever she does; so far as may be she keeps her dignity, yet humbly and graciously withal."&lt;ref&gt; De Maisse: a journal of all that was accomplished by Monsieur De Maisse, ambassador in England from King Henri IV to Queen Elizabeth, anno domini 1597, Nonesuch Press, 1931, p. 25-26&lt;/ref&gt; All subsequent images rely on a face pattern devised by Nicholas Hilliard sometime in the 1590s called by art historians the "Mask of Youth", portraying Elizabeth as ever-young.&lt;ref name="Mask" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sotheby's Catalogue L07123, ''Important British Paintings 1500–1850'', November 2007, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  Some 16 miniatures by Hilliard and his studio are known based on this face pattern, with different combinations of costume and jewels likely painted from life, and it was also adopted by (or enforced on) other artists associated with the Court.&lt;ref name="Mask" /&gt;

===The coronation portraits===
[[File:Elizabeth I Coronation Miniature.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Hilliard, c.1600]]
Two portraits of Elizabeth in her [[coronation]] robes survive, both dated to 1600 or shortly thereafter. One is a panel portrait in oils (&lt;small&gt;above&lt;/small&gt;) and the other is a miniature by Nicholas Hilliard.  The warrant to the queen's tailor for remodelling Mary I's cloth of gold coronation robes for Elizabeth survives, and costume historian [[Janet Arnold]]'s study points out that the paintings accurately reflect the written records, although the jewels differ in the two paintings,&lt;ref name="Coro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold 1978&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting two different sources, one possibly a miniature by Levina Teerlinc. It is not known why, and for whom, these portraits were created; at or just after the end of the reign.&lt;ref&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 162–63&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Rainbow Portrait===
[[File:Elizabeth I Rainbow Portrait.jpg|upright|thumb|The ''Rainbow Porait'', c. 1600–02, attrib. Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]]
Attributed to [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger]],&lt;ref&gt;Strong, Roy C. ''Gloriana: The Portraits of Queen Elizabeth I''. Germany: Thames and Hudson, 1987. pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps the most heavily symbolic portrait of the queen is the ''Rainbow Portrait'' at [[Hatfield House]]. It was painted around 1600–1602, when the queen was in her sixties.  In this painting an ageless Elizabeth appears dressed as if for a [[masque]], in a linen bodice [[embroidery|embroidered]] with spring flowers and a mantle draped over one shoulder, her hair loose beneath a fantastical headdress.&lt;ref name="GR"&gt;Strong 1987, pp. 157–160&lt;/ref&gt;  She wears symbols out of the popular [[emblem book]]s, including the cloak with eyes and ears, the serpent of wisdom, and the celestial [[armillary sphere]], and carries a rainbow with the motto ''non sine sol iris'' ("no rainbow without the sun").  Strong suggests that the complex "programme" for this image may be the work of the poet [[John Davies (poet)|John Davies]], whose ''Hymns to Astraea'' honouring the queen use much of the same imagery, and suggests it was commissioned by [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] as part of the decor for Elizabeth's visit in 1602, when a "shrine to Astraea" featured in the entertainments of what would prove to be the "last great festival of the reign".&lt;ref name="GR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cult"&gt;Strong 1977, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books and coins==

Prior to the wide dissemination of prints of the queen in the 1590s, the common people of Elizabeth's England would be most familiar with her image on the [[coin]]age.  In December 1560, a systematic recoinage of the debased money then in circulation was begun. The main early effort was the issuance of [[sterling silver]] [[shilling]]s and [[Groat (coin)|groats]], but new coins were issued in both silver and gold.  This restoration of the currency was one of the three principal achievements noted on Elizabeth's tomb, illustrating the value of stable currency to her contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003a, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  Later coinage represented the queen in iconic fashion, with the traditional accompaniments of [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] heraldic badges including the [[Tudor rose]] and [[portcullis]].

Books provided another widely available source of images of Elizabeth.  Her portrait appeared on the title page of the ''[[Bishops' Bible]]'', the standard Bible of the [[Church of England]], issued in 1568 and revised in 1572.  In various editions, Elizabeth is depicted with her orb and sceptre accompanied by female [[personification]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Doran 2003a, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Reading" the portraits==
[[File:Elizabeth I Palazzo Pitti Florence.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence]]
It may be impossible for modern viewers to see the hundreds of images of Elizabeth as her subjects, courtiers, and rivals saw them.  The portraits are steeped in classical mythology and the [[Renaissance]] understanding of English history and destiny, filtered by [[allusion]]s to [[Petrarch]]'s [[sonnet]]s and, late in the reign, to [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[Faerie Queene]]''.  Dame [[Frances Yates]] points out that the most complexly symbolic portraits may all commemorate specific events or have been designed as part of elaborate themed entertainments.&lt;ref name="Yates, p. 115"/&gt; The most familiar images of Elizabeth—the ''Armada'', ''Ditchley'', and ''Rainbow'' portraits—are all associated with unique events in this way.  To the extent that the contexts of other portraits have been lost to scholars, so too the keys to understanding these remarkable images as the Elizabethans understood them may be lost in time.  Even those portraits that are not overtly allegorical may be full of meaning to a discerning eye. Elizabethan courtiers familiar with the [[language of flowers]] and the Italian emblem books could have read stories in the blooms the queen carried, the embroidery on her clothes, and the design of her jewels.

According to [[Roy Strong]], &lt;blockquote&gt;Fear of the wrong use and perception of the visual image dominates the Elizabethan age. The old pre-Reformation idea of images, religious ones, was that they partook of the essence of what they depicted. Any advance in technique which could reinforce that experience was embraced. That was now reversed, indeed it may account for the Elizabethans failing to take cognisance of the optical advances which created the art of the Italian Renaissance. They certainly knew about these things but, and this is central to the understanding of the Elizabethans, chose not to employ them. Instead the visual arts retreated in favour of presenting a series of signs or symbols through which the viewer was meant to pass to an understanding of the idea behind the work. In this manner the visual arts were verbalised, turned into a form of book, a 'text' which called for reading by the onlooker. There are no better examples of this than the quite extraordinary portraits of the queen herself, which increasingly, as the reign progressed, took on the form of collections of abstract pattern and symbols disposed in an unnaturalistic manner for the viewer to unravel, and by doing so enter into an inner vision of the idea of monarchy."&lt;ref&gt;Strong (1999), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''San Clemente''' is a ruin of the ancient [[Maya civilization]] in [[Guatemala]]. Its main period of occupation dates to the Classic period of [[Mesoamerican chronology]] (approximately 250 – 950 AD).&lt;ref name="Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 269."&gt;Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 269.&lt;/ref&gt; The ruins were first described in the late 19th century, before being visited by a number of investigators in the early part of the 20th century.

==Location==
{{Maya civilization}}
The site is situated in the [[Petén Basin]], approximately {{convert|55|km|mi}} from [[Flores, El Petén|Flores]], in the [[Departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[Petén Department|El Petén]] of northern Guatemala. It is {{convert|13|km|mi}} north of the modern settlement of El Naranjo, within the [[Municipalities of Guatemala|municipality]] of Flores. The site occupies a deforested hilltop at an elevation of {{convert|270|m|ft}} [[above mean sea level]].&lt;ref name="Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 269."/&gt; San Clemente is located in the north of the [[Maya Biosphere Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;Morales 2005, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The ruins were given the name San Clemente in the late 19th century by [[Karl Sapper]], after a camp to the west of the site. Sylvanus Morley named the site Chinchantun ("small stone" in [[Mayan languages|Mayan]]), but the earlier name was adopted by Frans Blom and later investigators.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p100"/&gt;

==History==
The site was first occupied during the Early Classic (c. 250–550 AD), when simple platforms were built directly upon the bedrock, around unsurfaced plazas. The city underwent a major construction phase during the Late Classic (c. 550–830), with the development of monumental platforms and the construction of two [[Mesoamerican ballcourts]]. The [[Maya architecture|architecture]] visible today dates to the Terminal Classic (c. 830–950). Principal activity at the site has been dated according to [[Maya ceramics|ceramic]] evidence to the period running from c. 450 to c. 900.&lt;ref name="Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 270."&gt;Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
San Clemente was first described by [[Karl Sapper]] in 1895, and was visited by various expeditions during the course of the 20th century, including by noted archaeologists [[Frans Blom]] and [[Sylvanus Morley]]. The site was rediscovered in 1992 by the archaeological rescue project of the [[Cultural Triangle Yaxha-Nakum-Naranjo National Park]], and was investigated by archaeologists from 1995 to 2006,&lt;ref name="Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 269."/&gt; who carried out some restoration work in the northern sector of the site in 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz Cosme et al 2010, p. 376.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==
San Clemente was one of the most important [[Maya city|Maya cities]] in the region immediately to the southwest of [[Yaxha]];&lt;ref&gt;Morales 2005, pp. 97, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; the site core covers an area of approximately {{convert|60000|m2|sqft}} and includes an acropolis,&lt;ref&gt;Morales 2005, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; and two ballcourts, which are oriented north-south.&lt;ref&gt;Morales 2005, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture of San Clemente is grouped into three principal sectors, the northern sector labelled the Palace, the central sector consisting of the Main Plaza, and the Elevated South Group.&lt;ref&gt;Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, pp. 269–270&lt;/ref&gt; The three architectural groups are aligned upon a north-south axis.&lt;ref name="Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 271."&gt;Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; There are examples of range-type structures at San Clemente with masonry pillars supporting the facade.&lt;ref name="QuintanaSamayoa2017p78"&gt;Quintana Samayoa 2017, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Structures were numbered by early investigators from north to south.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p94"&gt;Blom 1928, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The site core was accessed by a [[Sacbe|causeway]] that approached from the east to join the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name="Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 271."/&gt;

In addition to the three main architectural groups of the site core, there are a number of smaller satellite groups. To the east of the Palace complex is a basal platform supporting a number of low platforms arranged around patios. Investigating archaeologists have suggested that this was the service complex associated with the palace. To the east of the South Plaza is a terrace (the Southeast Plaza), and to the west is the Southwest Plaza.&lt;ref name="Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 271."/&gt;

===Palace===
The Palace is laid out around two interior patios (the Upper Court and the Lower Court).&lt;ref&gt;Quintana Samayoa 2017, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The floor levels of the two patios differ by {{convert|7|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 272."/&gt; Structures I through to IV surround the Upper Court, which is linked to the Lower Court by an internal stairway contained within Structure IV. Structure IV is built against the east side of the retaining wall separating the east side of the Upper Court from the west side of the Lower Court.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p94-95"&gt;Blom 1928, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure III is a two-storey range-type structure in the palace, facing south onto the Main Plaza.&lt;ref&gt;Quintana Samayoa 2017, pp. 78, 93. Blom 1928, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; It separates the Plaza from the Upper Court.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p95"&gt;Blom 1928, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure VII is a well-preserved building on the south side of the Lower Court, separating it from the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p95-96"&gt;Blom 1928, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Three chambers in the structure open directly onto the Lower Court. An interior room is accessed via the westernmost of these chambers. The east wall of the western chamber contains a niche, marked in antiquity with red hand-prints upon its [[stucco]] while it was still fresh.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p96"&gt;Blom 1928, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The Lower Court is linked to the Main Plaza by a narrow passage at the western extreme of Structure VII.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p94"&gt;Blom 1928, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The western wall of the passage was marked with [[Ancient Maya graffiti|ancient graffiti]] scratched into the stucco, very similar to graffiti found at [[Tikal]]. The graffiti includes crude figures ang geometric shapes.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p98"&gt;Blom 1928, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure V lies along the north side of the Lower Court, and Structure VI delimits its eastern side.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p95"/&gt; Both of these are badly preserved.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p97"&gt;Blom 1928, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main Plaza===
All the buildings arranged around the Main Plaza face towards it. The Plaza is rectangular and divided into two portions by Ballcourt 1. The northern portion of the Main Plaza measures {{convert|45|by|45|m|ft}}; it is bordered on three sides by buildings. The southern portion is open on the east side where the causeway provided the principal entrance to the site core, and is also bordered by the edge of Ballcourt 2.&lt;ref name="Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 271."/&gt;

Sturctures IX and X close the west side of the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p95"/&gt; Structure IX, the northernmost of the two, is a platform that is likely to have supported a building. No traces of any building were found on top of Structure X, however three sculpted [[limestone]] stelae were raised at its base.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p99"&gt;Blom 1928, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Structure XIII is a long platform closing the east side of the Plaza;&lt;ref&gt;Blom 1928, pp. 95, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; it supported a building upon its southern half.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p99"/&gt; Four small stelae (Stelae 4–7) were raised at the base of Structure XIII. Altars were placed before Stela 4 and Stela 5.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p100"&gt;Blom 1928, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Structures XI and XII are low mounds in the southwestern portion of the Plaza. They were built from rough boulders and each stands between {{convert|3|and|4|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref&gt;Blom 1928, pp. 95, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Structures XIV and XV are twin [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]] standing on the south side of the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name="QuintanaSamayoa2017p81"&gt;Quintana Samayoa 2017, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; These steep-sided, stepped pyramids were faces with cut limestone blocks, and each supported a summit shrine; they are similar is style to the principal pyramids found at Tikal and Yaxha. The summit structures were accessed via stairways on the north faces of the pyramids, which descended to the Main Plaza.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p100"/&gt; Behind the eastern pyramid, a passage descends to the Southeast Plaza.&lt;ref name="Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 271."/&gt;

===South Plaza===
The South Plaza, sometimes referred to as the Elevated South Group, is immediately to the south of the Main Plaza. Its floor level is {{convert|3|m|ft}} higher than that of the Main Plaza, and it is accessed via a stairway climbing between the twin pyramids (Structures XIV and XV).&lt;ref name="Blom1928p100"/&gt;

Structure XVI is a long mound closing the west side of the plaza; it is in a ruinous state and once supported a range structure.&lt;ref&gt;Blom 1928, pp. 95, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The east side of the plaza is formed by Structures XXII and XVIII. Structure XVIII supported an east-facing building with masonry walls and a perishable roof. In the 1920s, the entrance still supported a [[Manilkara zapota|zapote]]-wood lintel.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p100"/&gt;

===Southeast Plaza===
The Southeast Plaza is a terrace that extends southwards from the Main Plaza along the east side of the South Plaza. The terrace is {{convert|0.5|m|ft}} higher than the Main Plaza,&lt;ref name="Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 271."/&gt; and had no apparent direct access to it. The north and south sides of the plaza were open. The western side of the plaza is delimited by an isolated range structure, with two ''[[chultun]]s'' (underground storage chambers) in front of it.&lt;ref name="Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 272."&gt;Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ballcourt 2===
The second of the ballcourts is located to the southeast of the site core. It is the larger of the two ballcourts and is well defined, forming a perfect [[File:I, heavily serifed.png|8px]] shape. On the north side, a low parapet separates the northern end zone of the ballcourt from the ramp ascending to the Main Plaza. The main playing area is flanked by two solidly-constructed buildings, and the southern end zone is marked by low but clearly-defined borders. At the western end of the southern end zone, the border is carved from the bedrock; its upper portion is at the same level as the South Plaza.&lt;ref name="Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, p. 271."/&gt; This [[File:I, heavily serifed.png|8px]]-shaped ballcourt is the only known example of this form in northeastern Petén.&lt;ref&gt;Quintana Samayoa, Gonzáles, and Salas Pol 2011, pp. 271–272.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monuments===
When Morley visited the site in 1922, he reported the presence of a series of small, heavily eroded [[Maya stelae|stelae]].&lt;ref&gt;Blom 1928, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Three stelae were raised at the base of Structure X on the Main Plaza, and four at the base of Structure XIII, also on the Plaza.&lt;ref&gt;Blom 1928, pp. 95, 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Although they were sculpted, their poor state of preservation makes their design illegible.&lt;ref name="Blom1928p100"/&gt;

'''ScrappleFace''' is a U.S. website run by Scott Ott that satirizes the news from a [[conservatism|conservative]] perspective.

==History==
The name ScrappleFace was coined by Ott's grandmother, Jessica McMaster (June 16, 1915 - January 31, 2006), who cared for Ott and his brothers from the age of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scrappleface.com/?p=2165|title=Woman Who Coined ‘ScrappleFace’ Passes Away&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ott chose the name knowing that the domain name would be available because no one else would know the word.

Ott, a former journalist, started Scrappleface in July 2002. Ott oversees "the vast editorial staff" at ScrappleFace, an unnamed group of non-existent journalists who "cover the globe like a patina of dental plaque" according to earlier items on the site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scrappleface.com/MT/archives/001069.html&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, all the ScrappleFace stories (more than 2,500 as of 15 March 2007) on politics, the war on terror, business, science, theology and even sports were written by Ott. The website reported over 10,000,000 visitors as of May 2007.

===Axis of weasels===
ScrappleFace is probably best known for originating the phrase "Axis of weasels",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/05/09/1052280425826.html|title=Axis of weasels - theage.com.au|website=www.theage.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/best/?id=110002953|title=Opinion &amp; Reviews - Wall Street Journal|website=www.opinionjournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an item Ott wrote in January 2003 titled [http://www.scrappleface.com/?p=395 "Rumsfeld Sorry for Axis of Weasels Remark"]. [[Glenn Reynolds]] linked to it at his widely read blog, [[Instapundit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instapundit.com/archives/006951.php|title=Instapundit.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; noting that it was being circulated at the White House and Pentagon. Two days later, the ''[[New York Post]]'' carried the front-page headline "AXIS OF WEASEL - GERMANY AND FRANCE WIMP OUT ON IRAQ; COLIN RAPS FRENCH, GERMAN WIMPS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Orin |first1=Deborah |title=AXIS OF WEASEL – GERMANY AND FRANCE WIMP OUT ON IRAQ; COLIN RAPS FRENCH, GERMAN WIMPS |url=https://nypost.com/2003/01/24/axis-of-weasel-germany-and-france-wimp-out-on-iraq-colin-raps-french-german-wimps/ |accessdate=August 20, 2018 |work=New York Post |date=January 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ott later published a collection of ScrappleFace stories under the title "Axis of Weasels" ({{ISBN|097614140X}}; now out of print).

===Media coverage===
Ott's work has been quoted in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', ''[[The Kansas City Star]]'', ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', [[OpinionJournal.com]] {{Fact|date=November 2007}}and the [[BBC]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3151595.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Magazine - Don't believe everything you read online|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; ScrappleFace stories have also been quoted on radio by [[Rush Limbaugh]], [[Glenn Beck]], [[Roger Hedgecock]], [[Michael Medved]], [[William John Bennett|Bill Bennett]], and dozens of regional radio hosts as well as on [[CNN]] and [[MSNBC]]. At least two ScrappleFace stories have been passed around via email enough to become an urban myth and be debunked by [[Snopes.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/satire/weasels.asp|title=Axis of Weasels|date=6 September 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/satire/kennedy.asp|title=Rumsfeld Rebukes Ted Kennedy|date=6 September 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ScrappleFace is popular amongst conservative [[Political blog#United States|political bloggers]], who frequently link to its items.

==SNN: ScrappleFace Network News==
Scott Ott began producing a video faux newscast on January 14, 2009 with the launch of SNN (ScrappleFace Network News). The first story was about the tax filing troubles of President Barack Obama's Treasury Secretary nominee Timothy Geithner.

The '''September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance''' or '''9/11 Day''' is a federally-recognized day of unity and charitable service, annually observed throughout the United States and in other countries around the world on the anniversary of the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]]. It has grown to become the largest annual day of charitable service in the United States.

==Background==

According to the nonprofit MyGoodDeed, which founded the September 11 National Day of Service and Remembrance ("9/11 Day") in 2002, the goal of "9/11 Day" is "to keep alive the spirit of unity and compassion that arose in the immediate aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]] in tribute to the individuals lost and injured in the attacks, and the many who rose in service in response." The idea of making September 11 an annual day of service was first conceived in the winter of 2001 by David Paine, a former marketing executive from New York City. In the Spring of 2002 David was joined by his friend Jay Winuk, who had lost his brother Glenn Winuk in the attacks at the World Trade Center, and together they formed the nonprofit group called One Day's Pay. In 2007, the name of the organization was officially changed to MyGoodDeed. In 2009, MyGoodDeed successfully led an effort to designate September 11 under federal law as a National Day of Service and Remembrance, which occurred as part of passage of the bipartisan Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act by the [[United States Congress]], and later, by an amendment to the Patriot Day [[Presidential Proclamation]] by President Barack Obama, which formally recognized and established September 11 as a National Day of Service and Remembrance. The Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act authorized the Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), a federal agency, to assist the 9/11 community in building awareness of and support for "9/11 Day" through its national service programs. In 2011, on the 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, MyGoodDeed, CNCS and the Points of Light Institute/HandsOn Network joined together to organize the largest day of charitable service in U.S. history, with more than 32 million Americans participating, according to research conducted by Horizon Consumer Science on behalf of MyGoodDeed. Today, 9/11 Day continues to engage nearly 30 million Americans annually in various forms of charitable service, including volunteering, donations to charities, and simple good deeds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://911day.org/about/ About Us], 911day.org, published by MyGoodDeed, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serve.gov/?q=site-page/september-11th-national-day-service-and-remembrance|September 11th National Day of Service and Remembrance], serve.gov, published by the Corporation for National and Community Service, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pointsoflight.org/signature-events/911-day-service-and-remembrance/2011|9/11 Day of Service and Remembrance 2011], pointsoflight.org, published by the Points of Light Foundation, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

Activities by volunteers on this federally-recognized National Day of Service and Remembrance happen all across the nation, and include lesson plans that engage tens of thousands of students of all ages in service activities; coast-to-coast blood drives; meal packing projects; painting and refurbishing homes; food drives; reclaiming neighborhoods; helping communities prepare for disasters; and countless other activities that support and honor those lost and injured on 9/11; veterans, soldiers, military families, and rescue and recovery workers, including first responders. Among the largest projects held annually are two large-scale hunger relief projects, one in New York City and another at the National Mall in Washington, DC, which mobilize a total of more than 7,000 volunteers who together pack over two million meals for individuals at risk of hunger. In Boston, thousands join together on 9/11 at the Rose Kennedy Greenway to assemble care packages for military personnel.  Participants are encouraged to use the [[hashtag]] #911Day when posting online about the day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serve.gov/?q=site-page/september-11th-national-day-service-and-remembrance|September 11th National Day of Service and Remembrance], serve.gov, published by the Corporation for National and Community Service, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ysa.org/act/programs/911day/ 9/11 Day of Service &amp; Remembrance], ysa.org, published by Youth Service America, accessed July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Volunteers Honor 9/11 Victims By Helping Others On National Day Of Service|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/09/11/volunteers-honor-911-victims-by-helping-others-on-national-day-of-service/|accessdate=2 December 2012|newspaper=CBS New York|date=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''speech community''' is a group of people who share a set of linguistic norms and expectations regarding the use of language.&lt;ref&gt;Yule, G 2006, 'the study of language', third edition, Cambridge University press.&lt;/ref&gt; It's a concept mostly associated with [[sociolinguistics]] and [[anthropological linguistics]].

Exactly how to define ''speech community'' is debated in the literature. Definitions of speech community tend to involve varying degrees of emphasis on the following: 
*Shared community membership
*Shared linguistic communication

A typical speech community can be a small town, but sociolinguists such as [[William Labov]] claim that a large metropolitan area, for example [[New York City]], can also be considered one single speech community.

Early definitions have tended to see speech communities as bounded and localized groups of people who live together and come to share the same linguistic norms because they belong to the same [[local community]]. It has also been assumed that within a community a homogeneous set of [[Norm (social)|norms]] should exist. These assumptions have been challenged by later scholarship that has demonstrated that individuals generally participate in various speech communities simultaneously and at different times in their lives. Each speech community has different norms that they tend to share only partially. Communities may be de-localized and unbounded rather than local, and they often comprise different sub-communities with differing speech norms. With the recognition of the fact that speakers actively use language to construct and manipulate [[Social identity|social identities]] by signalling membership in particular speech communities, the idea of the bounded speech community with homogeneous speech norms has become largely abandoned for a model based on the speech community as a fluid [[community of practice]].

A speech community comes to share a specific set of norms for language use through living and interacting together, and speech communities may therefore emerge among all groups that interact frequently and share certain norms and ideologies. Such groups can be villages, countries, political or professional communities, communities with shared interests, hobbies, or lifestyles, or even just groups of friends. Speech communities may share both particular sets of vocabulary and grammatical conventions, as well as speech styles and genres, and also norms for how and when to speak in particular ways.

==History of definitions==
The adoption of the concept of the "speech community" as a unit of linguistic analysis emerged in the 1960s.

===John Gumperz===
[[John Gumperz]]&lt;ref&gt;Gumperz, John. 1968. The Speech Community. in Duranti, Alessandro (ed.) Linguistic Anthropology: A reader 1:66-73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gumperz, John. 1964. Linguistic and Social Interaction in Two Communities. in Blount, Benjamin. (ed.) Language, Culture and Society. 14:283-299.&lt;/ref&gt; described how [[dialectology|dialectologists]] had taken issue with the dominant approach in historical linguistics that saw linguistic communities as homogeneous and localized entities in a way that allowed for drawing neat tree diagrams based on the principle of 'descent with modification' and shared innovations. Dialectologists rather realized that dialect traits spread through diffusion and that social factors were decisive in how this happened. They also realized that traits spread as waves from centers and that often several competing varieties would exist in some communities. This insight prompted Gumperz to problematize the notion of the linguistic community as the community that carries a single speech variant, and instead to seek a definition that could encompass heterogeneity. This could be done by focusing on the interactive aspect of language, because interaction in speech is the path along which diffused linguistic traits travel. Gumperz defined the community of speech:

{{quote|''Any human aggregate characterized by regular and frequent interaction by means of a shared body of verbal signs and set off from similar aggregates by significant differences in language usage.''|Gumperz (1968)}}

{{quote|''Regardless of the linguistic differences among them, the speech varieties employed within a speech community form a system because they are related to a shared set of social norms.''|Gumperz (1964)}}

Gumperz here identifies two important components of the speech community: members share both a set of linguistics forms and a set of social norms Gumperz also sought to set up a typological framework for describing how linguistic systems can be in use within a single speech community. He introduced the concept of linguistic range, the degree to which the linguistic systems of the community differ so that speech communities can be multilingual, diglossic, multidialectal (including [[sociolec]]tal stratification), or homogeneous - depending on the degree of difference among the different language systems used in the community. Secondly the notion of compartmentalization described the degree to which the use of different varieties were either set off from each other as discrete systems in interaction (e.g. [[diglossia]] where varieties correspond to specific social contexts, or multilingualism where varieties correspond to discrete social groups within the community) or whether they are habitually mixed in interaction (e.g. [[code-switching]], [[bilingualism]], syncretic language).

===Noam Chomsky===
Gumperz's formulation was however effectively overshadowed by [[Noam Chomsky]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Aspects of the Theory of Syntax]] |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |authorlink=Noam Chomsky |year=1965 |publisher=The MIT Press |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; redefinition of the scope of linguistics as being : 
{{quote|''concerned primarily with an ideal speaker-listener, in a completely homogeneous speech-community, who knows its language perfectly and is unaffected by such grammatically irrelevant conditions as memory limitations, distractions, shifts of attention and interest, and errors (random or characteristic) in applying his knowledge of the language in actual performance.''|Chomsky (1965:3)}}


===William Labov===
Another influential conceptualization of the linguistic community was that of [[William Labov]],&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William. 1972. Sociolinguistic Patterns . Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press .&lt;/ref&gt; which can be seen as a hybrid of the Chomskyan structural homogeneity and Gumperz' focus on shared norms informing variable practices. Labov wrote: 
{{quote|''The speech community is not defined by any marked agreement in the use of language elements, so much as by participation in a set of shared norms: these norms may be observed in overt types of evaluative behavior, and by the uniformity of abstract patterns of variation which are invariant in respect to particular levels of usage.''|Labov (1972:120–1)}}

Like that of Gumperz, Labov's formulation stressed that a speech community was defined more by shared norms than by shared linguistic forms. But like Chomsky, Labov also saw each of the formally distinguished linguistic varieties within a speech community as homogeneous, invariant and uniform. This model worked well for Labov's purpose which was to show that African American Vernacular English could not be seen as structurally degenerate form of English, but rather as a well defined linguistic code with its own particular structure. 

==Critique==
Probably because of their considerable explanatory power, Labov's and Chomsky's understandings of the speech community became widely influential in [[linguistics]]. But gradually a number of problems with those models became apparent.&lt;ref name=Patrick&gt;Patrick, P. L. 2008. The Speech Community, chapter 23 in The Handbook of Language Variation and Change (eds J. K. Chambers, P. Trudgill and N. Schilling-Estes), Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstly, it became increasingly clear that the assumption of homogeneity inherent in Chomsky and Labov's models was untenable. The [[African American]] speech community which Labov had seen as defined by the shared norms of [[African American Vernacular English|AAVE]], was shown to be an illusion, as ideological disagreements about the status of AAVE among different groups of speakers attracted public attention.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Marcyliena. 1994. The African-American Speech Community: Reality and Sociolinguistics. in Duranti, Alessandro (ed.) Linguistic Anthropology: A reader 2:74-92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, J. R. 1997. Unequal partnership: Sociolinguistics and the African American speech community. Language in Society (26), 2: 161 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, the concept of the speech community was large scale communities. By extending the concept, Gumperz' definition could no longer be evoked.

Thirdly, Chomsky and Labov's models made it clear that intra-personal variation is common. It also refine the choice of linguistic variant is often a choice madeto a specific speech context.

The force of these critiques with the concept of ''"speech communities"'' appeared because of the many contradictory. A part of scholars recommended abandoning the concept altogether, instead conceptualizing it as "the product of the communicative activities engaged in by a given group of people."&lt;ref&gt;Duranti, A. 1997. Linguistic anthropology. Cambridge University Press p.82&lt;/ref&gt; Others acknowledged the community's ''ad hoc'' status as "some kind of social group whose speech characteristics are of interest and can be described in a coherent manner".&lt;ref&gt;Wardhaugh, R. 1998. An introduction to sociolinguistics. Oxford: Blackwell. p.116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice theory==
[[Practice theory]], as developed by social thinkers such as [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Anthony Giddens]] and [[Michel de Certeau]], and the notion of the [[community of practice]] as developed by [[Jean Lave]]  and [[Etienne Wenger]] has been applied to the study of the language community by linguists [[William Hanks]]&lt;ref&gt;Hanks, William. 1992. The Indexical Ground of Deictic Reference. In Rethinking Context: Language as an Interactive Phenomenon, Alessandro Duranti and Charles Goodwin, eds. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 43-76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanks, William F. 2005b. Pierre Bourdieu and the Practices of Language, Annual Review of Anthropology. 34:67–83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanks, William F. 1996. Language and Communicative Practices. Boulder, CO: Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanks, William F. 1990 Referential Practice, Language and Lived Space among the Maya. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Penelope Eckert]].&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Penelope. 2006 Communities of practice. Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eckert, Penelope. 2000. Linguistic Variation as Social Practice . Oxford: Blackwell Publishers .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Eckert92&gt;Eckert, Penelope. 1992 Communities of Practice: Where Language, Gender and Power all Live. In Kira Hall, Mary Bucholtz and Birch Moonwomon eds., Locating Power, Proceedings of the 1992 Berkeley Women and Language Conference. Berkeley:Berkeley Women and Language Group, 89-99. (Penelope Eckert and [[Sally McConnell-Ginet]]). Reprinted in Jennifer Coates ed. (In press). Readings in Language and Gender. Cambridge: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meyerhoff, Miriam. 2008. Communities of Practice, in The Handbook of Language Variation and Change (eds J. K. Chambers, P. Trudgill and N. Schilling-Estes), Blackwell Publishing Ltd, Oxford, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eckert's aimed at an approach to sociolinguistic variation that didn't include any social variable (e.g. [[Social class|class]], [[gender]], locality). Instead she built a model that was able to locate variables that show significant issue to the group of individuals . For Eckert the crucial defining characteristics of the community is persistent through time to comprehend together.&lt;ref name=Eckert92/&gt;

Hanks' concept of the linguistic community is different from that of Eckert and Gumperz, it studies the ways in shared practice production of linguistic meaning. Hanks studies how linguistic practices are related to a variety that are produced through shared practices.

The notion of speech community is most generally used as a tool to define a unit of analysis within which to analyse [[Variety (linguistics)|language variation]] and change. [[Stylistics (linguistics)|Stylistic]] features differ among speech communities based on factors such as the group's ethnicity and social status, common interests and the level of formality expected within the group and by its larger [[society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228768428_Where_do_ethnolects_stop|title=Where do ethnolects stop?|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common interests and the level of formality also result in stylistic differences among speech communities. In [[Western culture]], for example, employees at a [[lawyer|law]] office would likely use more formal language than a group of [[adolescence|teenage]] [[skateboarding|skateboarders]] because most Westerners expect more formality and professionalism from practitioners of law than from an informal circle of adolescent friends. This special use of language by certain professions for particular activities is known in linguistics as [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]; in some analyses, the group of speakers of a register is known as a [[discourse community]], while the phrase "speech community" is reserved for varieties of a language or dialect that speakers inherit by birth or adoption.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="65225">'''Speech perception''' is the process by which the sounds of [[language]] are heard, interpreted and understood. The study of [[speech]] perception is closely linked to the fields of [[phonology]] and [[phonetics]] in [[linguistics]] and [[cognitive psychology]] and [[perception]] in [[psychology]]. Research in speech perception seeks to understand how human listeners recognize speech sounds and use this information to understand spoken language. Speech perception research has applications in building [[Speech recognition|computer systems that can recognize speech]], in improving speech recognition for hearing- and language-impaired listeners, and in foreign-language teaching.

==Basics==
The process of perceiving speech begins at the level of the sound signal and the process of audition. (For a complete description of the process of audition see [[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]].) After processing the initial auditory signal, speech sounds are further processed to extract acoustic cues and phonetic information. This speech information can then be used for higher-level language processes, such as word recognition.

===Acoustic cues===
[[File:Spectrograms of syllables dee dah doo.png|right|thumb|250px|Figure 1: Spectrograms of syllables "dee" (top), "dah" (middle), and "doo" (bottom) showing how the onset [[formant transition]]s that define perceptually the consonant {{IPA|[d]}} differ depending on the identity of the following vowel. ([[Formant]]s are highlighted by red dotted lines; transitions are the bending beginnings of the formant trajectories.)]]
The speech sound signal contains a number of [[acoustic cues]] that are used in speech perception. The cues differentiate speech sounds belonging to different [[phonetic]] categories. For example, one of the most studied cues in speech is [[voice onset time]] or VOT. VOT is a primary cue signaling the difference between voiced and voiceless plosives, such as "b" and "p". Other cues differentiate sounds that are produced at different [[place of articulation|places of articulation]] or [[manner of articulation|manners of articulation]]. The speech system must also combine these cues to determine the category of a specific speech sound. This is often thought of in terms of abstract representations of [[phonemes]]. These representations can then be combined for use in word recognition and other language processes.

It is not easy to identify what acoustic cues listeners are sensitive to when perceiving a particular speech sound:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''At first glance, the solution to the problem of how we perceive speech seems deceptively simple. If one could identify stretches of the acoustic waveform that correspond to units of perception, then the path from sound to meaning would be clear. However, this correspondence or mapping has proven extremely difficult to find, even after some forty-five years of research on the problem.''&lt;ref name="np"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Nygaard, L.C., Pisoni, D.B. |year=1995 |title=Speech Perception: New Directions in Research and Theory |editor1=J.L. Miller |editor2=P.D. Eimas |encyclopedia=Handbook of Perception and Cognition: Speech, Language, and Communication |location=San Diego |publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

If a specific aspect of the acoustic waveform indicated one linguistic unit, a series of tests using speech synthesizers would be sufficient to determine such a cue or cues. However, there are two significant obstacles:
# One acoustic aspect of the speech signal may cue different linguistically relevant dimensions. For example, the duration of a vowel in English can indicate whether or not the vowel is stressed, or whether it is in a syllable closed by a voiced or a voiceless consonant, and in some cases (like American English {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/æ/}}) it can distinguish the identity of vowels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Klatt, D.H. |year=1976 |title=Linguistic uses of segmental duration in English: Acoustic and perceptual evidence |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |pmid=956516 |volume=59 |pages=1208–1221 |doi= 10.1121/1.380986 | issue=5|bibcode = 1976ASAJ...59.1208K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts even argue that duration can help in distinguishing of what is traditionally called short and long vowels in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Halle, M., Mohanan, K.P. |year=1985 |title=Segmental phonology of modern English |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |volume=16 |pages=57–116 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# One linguistic unit can be cued by several acoustic properties. For example, in a classic experiment, [[Alvin Liberman]] (1957) showed that the onset [[formant transitions]] of {{IPA|/d/}} differ depending on the following vowel (see Figure 1) but they are all interpreted as the phoneme {{IPA|/d/}} by listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liberman, A.M. |year=1957 |title=Some results of research on speech perception |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=29 |pages=117–123 |url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/Reprints/HL0016.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-05-17 |doi=10.1121/1.1908635 | issue=1|bibcode = 1957ASAJ...29..117L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linearity and the segmentation problem {{anchor|segmentation}}===
{{Main|Speech segmentation}}
[[File:Spectrogram of I owe you.png|right|thumb|300px|Figure 2: A spectrogram of the phrase "I owe you". There are no clearly distinguishable boundaries between speech sounds.]]
Although listeners perceive speech as a stream of discrete units{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} ([[phonemes]], [[syllables]], and [[words]]), this linearity is difficult to see in the physical speech signal (see Figure 2 for an example). Speech sounds do not strictly follow one another, rather, they overlap.&lt;ref name="fow"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Fowler, C.A. |year=1995 |title=Speech production |editor1=J.L. Miller |editor2=P.D. Eimas |encyclopedia= Handbook of Perception and Cognition: Speech, Language, and Communication |location=San Diego |publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; A speech sound is influenced by the ones that precede and the ones that follow. This influence can even be exerted at a distance of two or more segments (and across syllable- and word-boundaries).&lt;ref name="fow"/&gt;

Because the speech signal is not linear, there is a problem of segmentation. It is difficult to delimit a stretch of speech signal as belonging to a single perceptual unit. As an example, the acoustic properties of the phoneme {{IPA|/d/}} will depend on the production of the following vowel (because of [[coarticulation]]).

===Lack of invariance===
The research and application of speech perception must deal with several problems which result from what has been termed the lack of invariance. Reliable constant relations between a phoneme of a language and its acoustic manifestation in speech are difficult to find. There are several reasons for this:

====Context-induced variation====
Phonetic environment affects the acoustic properties of speech sounds. For example, {{IPA|/u/}} in English is fronted when surrounded by [[coronal consonant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hillenbrand, J.M., Clark, M.J., Nearey, T.M. |year=2001 |title=Effects of consonant environment on vowel formant patterns |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |pmid=11248979 |volume=109 |pages=748–763 |doi=10.1121/1.1337959 | issue=2|bibcode = 2001ASAJ..109..748H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Or, the [[voice onset time]] marking the boundary between voiced and voiceless plosives are different for labial, alveolar and velar plosives and they shift under stress or depending on the position within a syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lisker, L., Abramson, A.S. |year=1967 |title=Some effects of context on voice onset time in English plosives |journal=Language and Speech |volume=10 |pages=1–28 |url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/Reprints/HL0067.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-05-17 |pmid=6044530 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Variation due to differing speech conditions====
One important factor that causes variation is differing speech rate. Many phonemic contrasts are constituted by temporal characteristics (short vs. long vowels or consonants, affricates vs. fricatives, plosives vs. glides, voiced vs. voiceless plosives, etc.) and they are certainly affected by changes in speaking tempo.&lt;ref name="np"/&gt; Another major source of variation is articulatory carefulness vs. sloppiness which is typical for connected speech (articulatory "undershoot" is obviously reflected in the acoustic properties of the sounds produced).

====Variation due to different speaker identity====
The resulting acoustic structure of concrete speech productions depends on the physical and psychological properties of individual speakers. Men, women, and children generally produce voices having different pitch. Because speakers have vocal tracts of different sizes (due to sex and age especially) the resonant frequencies ([[formants]]), which are important for recognition of speech sounds, will vary in their absolute values across individuals&lt;ref name="hill"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hillenbrand, J., Getty, L.A., Clark, M.J., Wheeler, K. |year=1995 |title=Acoustic characteristics of American English vowels |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=97 |pages=3099–3111 |doi=10.1121/1.411872 |pmid=7759650 |issue=5 Pt 1|bibcode = 1995ASAJ...97.3099H }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see Figure 3 for an illustration of this). Research shows that infants at the age of 7.5 months cannot recognize information presented by speakers of different genders; however by the age of 10.5 months, they can detect the similarities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houston|first=Derek M.|author2=Juscyk, Peter W.|title=The role of talker-specific information in word segmentation by infants|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|date=October 2000|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1570–1582|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.26.5.1570|url=http://babytalk.iupui.edu/pdfs/HoustonJusczyk_2000.pdf|accessdate=1 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430034452/http://babytalk.iupui.edu/pdfs/HoustonJusczyk_2000.pdf|archive-date=2014-04-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dialect and foreign accent can also cause variation, as can the social characteristics of the speaker and listener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hay|first=Jennifer|author2=Drager, Katie |title=Stuffed toys and speech perception|journal=Linguistics|year=2010|volume=48|issue=4|pages=865–892|doi=10.1515/LING.2010.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceptual constancy and normalization===
[[File:Standard and normalized vowel space2.png|right|thumb|300px|Figure 3: The left panel shows the 3 peripheral American English vowels {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, and {{IPA|/u/}} in a standard F1 by F2 plot (in Hz). The mismatch between male, female, and child values is apparent. In the right panel formant distances (in [[Bark scale|Bark]]) rather than absolute values are plotted using the normalization procedure proposed by Syrdal and Gopal in 1986.&lt;ref name="sg"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Syrdal, A.K., Gopal, H.S. |year=1986 |title=A perceptual model of vowel recognition based on the auditory representation of American English vowels |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=79 |pages=1086–1100 |doi=10.1121/1.393381 |pmid=3700864 |issue=4|bibcode = 1986ASAJ...79.1086S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Formant values are taken from Hillenbrand et al. (1995)&lt;ref name="hill"/&gt;]]
Despite the great variety of different speakers and different conditions, listeners perceive vowels and consonants as constant categories. It has been proposed that this is achieved by means of the perceptual normalization process in which listeners filter out the noise (i.e. variation) to arrive at the underlying category. Vocal-tract-size differences result in formant-frequency variation across speakers; therefore a listener has to adjust his/her perceptual system to the acoustic characteristics of a particular speaker. This may be accomplished by considering the ratios of formants rather than their absolute values.&lt;ref name="sg"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Strange, W. |year=1999 |title=Perception of vowels: Dynamic constancy |editor=J.M. Pickett |encyclopedia=The Acoustics of Speech Communication: Fundamentals, Speech Perception Theory, and Technology |location=Needham Heights (MA) |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=john&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Johnson, K. |year=2005 |title=Speaker Normalization in speech perception |editor=Pisoni, D.B. |editor2=Remez, R. |encyclopedia=The Handbook of Speech Perception |location=Oxford |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |url= http://corpus.linguistics.berkeley.edu/~kjohnson/papers/revised_chapter.pdf |accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process has been called vocal tract normalization (see Figure 3 for an example). Similarly, listeners are believed to adjust the perception of duration to the current tempo of the speech they are listening to – this has been referred to as speech rate normalization.

Whether or not normalization actually takes place and what is its exact nature is a matter of theoretical controversy (see [[#Theories|theories]] below). [[Perceptual constancy]] is a phenomenon not specific to speech perception only; it exists in other types of perception too.

===Categorical perception===
{{Main|Categorical perception}}
[[File:Categorization-and-discrimination-curves.png|right|thumb|300px|Figure 4: Example identification (red) and discrimination (blue) functions]]
Categorical perception is involved in processes of perceptual differentiation. People perceive speech sounds categorically, that is to say, they are more likely to notice the differences ''between'' categories (phonemes) than ''within'' categories. The perceptual space between categories is therefore warped, the centers of categories (or "prototypes") working like a sieve&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Trubetzkoy |first= Nikolay S. |authorlink=Nikolai Trubetzkoy |title=Principles of phonology |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |year=1969 |isbn=0-520-01535-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; or like magnets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iverson, P., Kuhl, P.K. |year=1995 |title=Mapping the perceptual magnet effect for speech using signal detection theory and multidimensional scaling |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |pmid=7860832 |volume=97 |pages=553–562 |doi=10.1121/1.412280 | issue=1|bibcode = 1995ASAJ...97..553I }}&lt;/ref&gt; for incoming speech sounds.

In an artificial continuum between a voiceless and a voiced [[bilabial plosive]], each new step differs from the preceding one in the amount of [[voice onset time|VOT]]. The first sound is a [[pre-voicing (phonetics)|pre-voiced]] {{IPA|[b]}}, i.e. it has a negative VOT. Then, increasing the VOT, it reaches zero, i.e. the plosive is a plain [[aspiration (phonetics)|unaspirated]] voiceless {{IPA|[p]}}. Gradually, adding the same amount of VOT at a time, the plosive is eventually a strongly aspirated voiceless bilabial {{IPA|[pʰ]}}. (Such a continuum was used in an experiment by [[Leigh Lisker|Lisker]] and [[Arthur S. Abramson|Abramson]] in 1970.&lt;ref name=la/&gt; The sounds they used are [http://www.haskins.yale.edu/featured/demo-liskabram/index.html available online].) In this continuum of, for example, seven sounds, native English listeners will identify the first three sounds as {{IPA|/b/}} and the last three sounds as {{IPA|/p/}} with a clear boundary between the two categories.&lt;ref name=la&gt;{{cite conference |author=Lisker, L., Abramson, A.S. |year=1970 |title=The voicing dimension: Some experiments in comparative phonetics |booktitle=Proc. 6th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences |pages=563–567 |location=Prague |publisher=Academia |url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/Reprints/HL0087.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A two-alternative identification (or categorization) test will yield a discontinuous categorization function (see red curve in Figure 4).

In tests of the ability to discriminate between two sounds with varying VOT values but having a constant VOT distance from each other (20 ms for instance), listeners are likely to perform at chance level if both sounds fall within the same category and at nearly 100% level if each sound falls in a different category (see the blue discrimination curve in Figure 4).

The conclusion to make from both the identification and the discrimination test is that listeners will have different sensitivity to the same relative increase in VOT depending on whether or not the boundary between categories was crossed. Similar perceptual adjustment is attested for other acoustic cues as well.

===Top-down influences===
In a classic experiment, Richard M. Warren (1970) replaced one phoneme of a word with a cough-like sound. Perceptually, his subjects restored the missing speech sound without any difficulty and could not accurately identify which phoneme had been disturbed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Warren, R.M. |year=1970 |title=Restoration of missing speech sounds |journal=Science |volume=167 |pages= 392–393 |doi=10.1126/science.167.3917.392 |pmid=5409744 |issue=3917|bibcode = 1970Sci...167..392W }}&lt;/ref&gt;, a phenomenon known as the [[phonemic restoration effect]]. Therefore, the process of speech perception is not necessarily uni-directional. 

Another basic experiment compared recognition of naturally spoken words within a phrase versus the same words in isolation, finding that perception accuracy usually drops in the latter condition. To probe the influence of semantic knowledge on perception, Garnes and Bond (1976) similarly used carrier sentences where target words only differed in a single phoneme (bay/day/gay, for example) whose quality changed along a continuum. When put into different sentences that each naturally led to one interpretation, listeners tended to judge ambiguous words according to the meaning of the whole sentence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=Garnes, S., Bond, Z.S. |year=1976 |title=The relationship between acoustic information and semantic expectation |booktitle= Phonologica 1976 |location=Innsbruck |pages=285–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jongman A, Wang Y, Kim BH |title=Contributions of semantic and facial information to perception of nonsibilant fricatives |journal=J. Speech Lang. Hear. Res. |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=1367–77 |date=December 2003 |pmid=14700361 |doi=10.1044/1092-4388(2003/106) |url=https://www.sfu.ca/~yuew/documents/jongman%20wang%20kim%20JSLHR%20proof.pdf |access-date=2017-09-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614064103/http://www.sfu.ca/~yuew/documents/jongman%20wang%20kim%20JSLHR%20proof.pdf |archive-date=2013-06-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;. That is, higher-level language processes connected with [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], or [[semantics]] may interact with basic speech perception processes to aid in recognition of speech sounds. 

It may be the case that it is not necessary and maybe even not possible for a listener to recognize phonemes before recognizing higher units, like words for example. After obtaining at least a fundamental piece of information about phonemic structure of the perceived entity from the acoustic signal, listeners can compensate for missing or noise-masked phonemes using their knowledge of the spoken language. Compensatory mechanisms might even operate at the sentence level such as in learned songs, phrases and verses, an effect backed-up by [[neural coding]] patterns consistent with the missed continuous speech fragments&lt;ref name="CervantesConstantino_&amp;_Simon_2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Simon|first2=JZ|year=2018|title=Restoration and Efficiency of the Neural Processing of Continuous Speech Are Promoted by Prior Knowledge|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=56|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2018.00056 |last1=Cervantes Constantino|first1=F}}&lt;/ref&gt;, despite the lack of all relevant bottom-up sensory input.

===Acquired brain disabilities===

The first ever hypothesis of speech perception was used with patients who acquired an auditory comprehension deficit, also known as [[receptive aphasia]]. Since then there have been many disabilities that have been classified, which resulted in a true definition of "speech perception".&lt;ref name="Poeppel, Monahan, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Poeppel |first1=David|last2=Monahan |first2=Philip J.|title=Speech Perception: Cognitive Foundations and Cortical Implementation |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=2 |year=2008 |pages=80–85 |issn=0963-7214 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00553.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'speech perception' describes the process of interest that employs sub lexical contexts to the probe process. It consists of many different language and grammatical functions, such as: features, segments (phonemes), syllabic structure (unit of pronunciation), phonological word forms (how sounds are grouped together), grammatical features, morphemic (prefixes and suffixes), and semantic information (the meaning of the words).
In the early years, they were more interested in the acoustics of speech. For instance, they were looking at the differences between /ba/ or /da/, but now research has been directed to the response in the brain from the stimuli. In recent years, there has been a model developed to create a sense of how speech perception works; this model is known as the dual stream model. This model has drastically changed from how psychologists look at perception. The first section of the dual stream model is the ventral pathway. This pathway incorporates middle temporal gyrus, inferior temporal sulcus and perhaps the inferior temporal gyrus. The ventral pathway shows phonological representations to the lexical or conceptual representations, which is the meaning of the words. The second section of the dual stream model is the dorsal pathway. This pathway includes the sylvian parietotemporal, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior insula, and premotor cortex. Its primary function is to take the sensory or phonological stimuli and transfer it into an articulatory-motor representation (formation of speech).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hickok G, Poeppel D |title=The cortical organization of speech processing |journal=Nat. Rev. Neurosci. |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=393–402 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17431404 |doi=10.1038/nrn2113 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aphasia====
There are two different kinds of [[Aphasia|aphasic]] patients: [[expressive aphasia]] (also known as Broca's aphasia) and [[receptive aphasia]] (also known as Wernicke's aphasia). There are three distinctive dimensions to phonetics: manner of articulation, place of articulation, and voicing.&lt;ref name="hd"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hessler|first=Dorte|author2=Jonkers, Bastiaanse |title=The influence of phonetic dimensions on aphasic speech perception|journal=Clinical Linguistics and Phonetics|date=December 2010|volume=24|series=12|pages=980–996|doi=10.3109/02699206.2010.507297}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Expressive aphasia''': Patients who suffer from this condition typically have lesions on their left inferior frontal cortex. These patients are described with having severe syntactical deficits, which means that they have extreme difficulty in forming sentences correctly. Expressive aphasic patients suffer from more regular rule governed principles in forming sentences, which is closely related to Alzheimer patients. For instance instead of saying the red ball bounced, both of these patients would say bounced ball the red. This is just one example of what a person might say; there are of course many possibilities.&lt;ref name="hd"/&gt;

'''Receptive aphasia''': The patients suffer from lesions or damage located in the left temporoparietal lobe. Receptive Aphasic patients mostly suffer from lexical-semantic difficulties, but also have difficulties in comprehension tasks. Though they have difficulty saying things or describing things, these people showed that they could do well in online comprehension tasks. This is closely related to Parkinson's disease because both of the diseases have trouble in distinguishing irregular verbs. For instance, a person suffering from expressive aphasia or Parkinson's disease would say "the dog goed home" instead of "the dog went home".&lt;ref name="hd"/&gt;

====Parkinson's disease====
This disease attacks the brain and makes the patients unable to stop shaking. The effects could be difficulty in walking, communicating, or functioning. Over time the symptoms go from mild to severe, which can cause extreme difficulties in a person's life. Many psychologists relate Parkinson's disease to [[progressive nonfluent aphasia]], which would cause a person to have comprehension deficits and being able to recognize irregular verbs. For instance, a person suffering from expressive aphasia or Parkinson's disease would say "the dog goed home" instead of "the dog went home".&lt;ref name="ftp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frost|first=Eleanor |author2=Tripoliti, Hariz |author3=Pring, Limousin|title=Self-perception of speech changes in patients with Parkinson's disease following [[deep brain stimulation]] of the subthalamic nucleus|journal=International Journal of Speech-Language Pathology|year=2010|volume=12|issue=5|pages=399–404|doi=10.3109/17549507.2010.497560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Agnosia ====
[[Agnosia]] is "the loss or diminution of the ability to recognize familiar objects or stimuli usually as a result of brain damage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/agnosia|title=Definition of AGNOSIA|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several different kinds of agnosia that affect every one of our senses, but the two most common related to speech are [[speech agnosia]] and [[phonagnosia]].

===== Speech agnosia =====
Pure word deafness, or speech agnosia, is an impairment in which a person maintains the ability to hear, produce speech, and even read speech, yet they are unable to understand or properly perceive speech.  These patients seem to have all of the skills necessary in order to properly process speech, yet they appear to have no experience associated with speech stimuli. Patients have reported, "I can hear you talking, but I can't translate it".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tulane.edu/~h0Ward/BrLg/index.html|title=Welcome to Brain and Language|last=Howard|first=Harry|date=2017|website=Welcome to Brain and Language|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though they are physically receiving and processing the stimuli of speech, without the ability to determine the meaning of the speech, they essentially are unable to perceive the speech at all.

===== Phonagnosia =====
is associated with the inability to recognize any familiar voices. In these cases, speech stimuli can be heard and even understood but the association of the speech to a certain voice is lost. This can be due to "abnormal processing of complex vocal properties (timbre, articulation, and prosody—elements that distinguish an individual voice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rocha|first=Sofia|last2=Amorim|first2=José Manuel|last3=Machado|first3=Álvaro Alexandre|last4=Ferreira|first4=Carla Maria|date=2015-04-01|title=Phonagnosia and Inability to Perceive Time Passage in Right Parietal Lobe Epilepsy|url=https://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.14040073|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=27|issue=2|pages=e154–e155|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.14040073|issn=0895-0172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatments===

====Aphasia====
A group of psychologists conducted a study to test the McGurk effect with aphasia patients and speech reading.&lt;ref name="hd"/&gt; The subjects watched dubbed videos in which the audio and visual did not match. Then after they completed the first part of the experiment, the experimenters taught the aphasic patients to speech read, which is the ability to read lips. The experimenters then conducted the same test and found that the people still had more of an advantage of audio only over visual only, but they also found that the subjects did better in audio-visual than audio alone. The patients also did improve their place of articulation and their manner of articulation. This all means that aphasic patients might benefit from learning how to speech read (lip reading).

====Parkinson's disease====
There are quite a few drug therapies that are possible for Parkinson's disease (ex. Sinemet). Since there is no cure for it, the patient will probably end up having to have surgery done to relieve some of the symptoms. When a patient has this procedure done, they are most likely going to receive a deep brain stimulation, so it will keep the brain stimulated even though the disease tries to disable it. A study was performed to test if surgery helps the patients discover their symptoms post surgery than pre-surgery. They found that the symptoms were still present but the patients were more aware of their difficulties than before they had surgery.&lt;ref name="ftp"/&gt; This shows that surgery does improve a patient's speech perception, even though it might not cure their disease.

==== Speech agnosia ====
Again, there are no known treatments that have been found, but from case studies and experiments it is known that speech agnosia is related to lesions in the left hemisphere or both, specifically right temporoparietal dysfunctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lambert|first=J.|date=1999|title=Auditory Agnosia with relative sparing of speech perception|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945289800073|journal=Neurocase|volume=5|pages=394|via=|doi=10.1093/neucas/5.5.394}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Phonagnosia ====
There is no known treatment; however, there is a case report of an epileptic woman who began to experience phonagnosia along with other impairments. Her EEG and  MRI results showed "a right cortical parietal T2-hyperintense lesion without gadolinium enhancement and with discrete impairment of water molecule diffusion".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rocha|first=Sofia|last2=Amorim|first2=José Manuel|last3=Machado|first3=Álvaro Alexandre|last4=Ferreira|first4=Carla Maria|date=2015-04-01|title=Phonagnosia and Inability to Perceive Time Passage in Right Parietal Lobe Epilepsy|url=https://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/10.1176/appi.neuropsych.14040073|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|volume=27|issue=2|pages=e154–e155|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.14040073|issn=0895-0172}}&lt;/ref&gt; So although no treatment has been discovered, phonagnosia can be correlated to postictal parietal cortical dysfunction.

==Research topics==

===Infant speech perception===
Infants begin the process of [[language acquisition]] by being able to detect very small differences between speech sounds. They can discriminate all possible speech contrasts (phonemes). Gradually, as they are exposed to their native language, their perception becomes language-specific, i.e. they learn how to ignore the differences within phonemic categories of the language (differences that may well be contrastive in other languages – for example, English distinguishes two voicing categories of [[plosives]], whereas [[Thai language#Consonants|Thai has three categories]]; infants must learn which differences are distinctive in their native language uses, and which are not). As infants learn how to sort incoming speech sounds into categories, ignoring irrelevant differences and reinforcing the contrastive ones, their perception becomes [[#Categorical perception|categorical]]. Infants learn to contrast different vowel phonemes of their native language by approximately 6 months of age. The native consonantal contrasts are acquired by 11 or 12 months of age.&lt;ref name=kawai&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1984-06.2007 |author=Minagawa-Kawai, Y., Mori, K., Naoi, N., Kojima, S. |year=2006 |title=Neural Attunement Processes in Infants during the Acquisition of a Language-Specific Phonemic Contrast |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |volume=27 |pages=315–321 | issue=2 |pmid=17215392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have proposed that infants may be able to learn the sound categories of their native language through passive listening, using a process called [[statistical learning in language acquisition|statistical learning]]. Others even claim that certain sound categories are innate, that is, they are genetically specified (see discussion about [[Categorical perception#Acquired distinctiveness|innate vs. acquired categorical distinctiveness]]).

If day-old babies are presented with their mother's voice speaking normally, abnormally (in monotone), and a stranger's voice, they react only to their mother's voice speaking normally. When a human and a non-human sound is played, babies turn their head only to the source of human sound. It has been suggested that auditory learning begins already in the pre-natal period.&lt;ref name=cd&gt;{{cite book |last=Crystal |first=David |year=2005 |title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language |location=Cambridge |publisher=CUP |isbn=0-521-55967-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the techniques used to examine how infants perceive speech, besides the head-turn procedure mentioned above, is measuring their sucking rate. In such an experiment, a baby is sucking a special nipple while presented with sounds. First, the baby's normal sucking rate is established. Then a stimulus is played repeatedly. When the baby hears the stimulus for the first time the sucking rate increases but as the baby becomes [[habituate]]d to the stimulation the sucking rate decreases and levels off. Then, a new stimulus is played to the baby. If the baby perceives the newly introduced stimulus as different from the background stimulus the sucking rate will show an increase.&lt;ref name=cd/&gt; The sucking-rate and the head-turn method are some of the more traditional, behavioral methods for studying speech perception. Among the new methods (see [[#Research methods|Research methods]] below) that help us to study speech perception, [[near-infrared spectroscopy]] is widely used in infants.&lt;ref name=kawai/&gt;

It has also been discovered that even though infants' ability to distinguish between the different phonetic properties of various languages begins to decline around the age of nine months, it is possible to reverse this process by exposing them to a new language in a sufficient way. In a research study by Patricia K. Kuhl, Feng-Ming Tsao, and Huei-Mei Liu, it was discovered that if infants are spoken to and interacted with by a native speaker of Mandarin Chinese, they can actually be conditioned to retain their ability to distinguish different speech sounds within Mandarin that are very different from speech sounds found within the English language. Thus proving that given the right conditions, it is possible to prevent infants' loss of the ability to distinguish speech sounds in languages other than those found in the native language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kuhl|first=Patricia K. |author2=Feng-Ming Tsao |author3=Huei-Mei Liu|title=Foreign-language experience in infancy: Effects of short-term exposure and social interaction on phonetic learning|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=July 2003|volume=100|issue=15|pages=9096–9101|bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.9096K |doi = 10.1073/pnas.1532872100 |pmid=12861072 |pmc=166444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-language and second-language===
A large amount of research has studied how users of a language perceive [[foreign language|foreign]] speech (referred to as cross-language speech perception) or [[second language|second-language]] speech (second-language speech perception). The latter falls within the domain of [[second language acquisition]].

Languages differ in their phonemic inventories. Naturally, this creates difficulties when a foreign language is encountered. For example, if two foreign-language sounds are assimilated to a single mother-tongue category the difference between them will be very difficult to discern. A classic example of this situation is the observation that Japanese learners of English will have problems with identifying or distinguishing English [[liquid consonant]]s {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} (see [[Perception of English /r/ and /l/ by Japanese speakers]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iverson, P., Kuhl, P.K., Akahane-Yamada, R., Diesh, E., Thokura, Y., Kettermann, A., Siebert, C., |year=2003 |title=A perceptual interference account of acquisition difficulties for non-native phonemes |journal=Cognition |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=B47–B57 |doi=10.1016/S0010-0277(02)00198-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Best (1995) proposed a Perceptual Assimilation Model which describes possible cross-language category assimilation patterns and predicts their consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Best, C. T. |year=1995 |title=A direct realist view of cross-language speech perception: New Directions in Research and Theory |editor=Winifred Strange |encyclopedia=Speech perception and linguistic experience: Theoretical and methodological issues |location=Baltimore |publisher=York Press |pages=171–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flege (1995) formulated a Speech Learning Model which combines several hypotheses about second-language (L2) speech acquisition and which predicts, in simple words, that an L2 sound that is not too similar to a native-language (L1) sound will be easier to acquire than an L2 sound that is relatively similar to an L1 sound (because it will be perceived as more obviously "different" by the learner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Flege, J., |year=1995 |title=Second language speech learning: Theory, findings and problems |editor= Winifred Strange |encyclopedia=Speech perception and linguistic experience: Theoretical and methodological issues |location=Baltimore |publisher=York Press |pages=233–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In language or hearing impairment===
Research in how people with language or hearing impairment perceive speech is not only intended to discover possible treatments. It can provide insight into the principles underlying non-impaired speech perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Uhler |author2=Yoshinaga-Itano |author3=Gabbard |author4=Rothpletz |author5=Jenkins |title=infant speech perception in young cochlear implant users|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Audiology|date=March 2011|volume=22|issue=3|pages=129–142|doi=10.3766/jaaa.22.3.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two areas of research can serve as an example:

====Listeners with aphasia====
[[Aphasia]] affects both the expression and reception of language. Both two most common types, [[expressive aphasia]] and [[receptive aphasia]], affect speech perception to some extent. Expressive aphasia causes moderate difficulties for language understanding. The effect of receptive aphasia on understanding is much more severe. It is agreed upon, that aphasics suffer from perceptual deficits. They usually cannot fully distinguish place of articulation and voicing.&lt;ref name="cse2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Csépe, V. |author2=Osman-Sagi, J. |author3=Molnar, M. |author4=Gosy, M. |year= 2001 |title=Impaired speech perception in aphasic patients: event-related potential and neuropsychological assessment |journal=Neuropsychologia |pmid=11527557 |volume=39 |pages=1194–1208 |doi= 10.1016/S0028-3932(01)00052-5 | issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for other features, the difficulties vary. It has not yet been proven whether low-level speech-perception skills are affected in aphasia sufferers or whether their difficulties are caused by higher-level impairment alone.&lt;ref name="cse2001"/&gt;

====Listeners with cochlear implants====
[[Cochlear implant]]ation restores access to the acoustic signal in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss. The acoustic information conveyed by an implant is usually sufficient for implant users to properly recognize speech of people they know even without visual clues.&lt;ref name="loi1998"/&gt; For cochlear implant users, it is more difficult to understand unknown speakers and sounds. The perceptual abilities of children that received an implant after the age of two are significantly better than of those who were implanted in adulthood. A number of factors have been shown to influence perceptual performance, specifically: duration of deafness prior to implantation, age of onset of deafness, age at implantation (such age effects may be related to the [[Critical period hypothesis]]) and the duration of using an implant. There are differences between children with congenital and acquired deafness. Postlingually deaf children have better results than the prelingually deaf and adapt to a cochlear implant faster.&lt;ref name="loi1998"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Loizou, P. |year=1998 |title=Introduction to cochlear implants |journal=IEEE Signal Processing Magazine |volume=39 |pages=101–130 | issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both children with cochlear implants and normal hearing, vowels and voice onset time becomes prevalent in development before the ability to discriminate the place of articulation. Several months following implantation, children with cochlear implants can normalize speech perception.

===Noise===
One of the fundamental problems in the study of speech is how to deal with noise. This is shown by the difficulty in recognizing human speech that computer recognition systems have. While they can do well at recognizing speech if trained on a specific speaker's voice and under quiet conditions, these systems often do poorly in more realistic listening situations where humans would understand speech without relative difficulty. To emulate processing patterns that would be held in the brain under normal conditions, prior knowledge is a key neural factor, since a robust [[learning]] history may to an extent override the extreme masking effects involved in the complete absence of continuous speech signals&lt;ref name="CervantesConstantino_&amp;_Simon_2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Simon|first2=JZ|year=2018|title=Restoration and Efficiency of the Neural Processing of Continuous Speech Are Promoted by Prior Knowledge|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|volume=12|issue=56|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2018.00056 |last1=Cervantes Constantino|first1=F}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
{{See also|Auditory processing disorder}}

===Music-language connection===
{{See also|Cognitive neuroscience of music}}
Research into the relationship between [[Music psychology|music and cognition]] is an emerging field related to the study of speech perception. Originally it was theorized that the neural signals for music were processed in a specialized "module" in the right hemisphere of the brain. Conversely, the neural signals for language were to be processed by a similar "module" in the left hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Deutsch, Diana"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deutsch |first=Diana |last2=Henthorn |first2=Trevor |last3=Dolson |first3=Mark |date=Spring 2004 |title=Speech patterns heard early in life influence later perception of the tritone paradox |url=http://deutsch.ucsd.edu/pdf/MP-2004-21_357-372.pdf |journal=Music Perception |publisher= |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=357–72 |doi= 10.1525/mp.2004.21.3.357|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, utilizing technologies such as fMRI machines, research has shown that two regions of the brain traditionally considered exclusively to process speech, Broca's and Wernicke's areas, also become active during musical activities such as listening to a sequence of musical chords.&lt;ref name="Deutsch, Diana" /&gt; Other studies, such as one performed by Marques et al. in 2006 showed that 8-year-olds who were given six months of musical training showed an increase in both their pitch detection performance and their electrophysiological measures when made to listen to an unknown foreign language.&lt;ref name="Portuguese"&gt;Marques, C et al. (2007). Musicians detect pitch violation in foreign language better than nonmusicians: Behavioral and electrophysiological evidence. "Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 19", 1453-1463.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, some research has revealed that, rather than music affecting our perception of speech, our native speech can affect our perception of music. One example is the [[tritone paradox]]. The tritone paradox is where a listener is presented with two computer-generated tones (such as C and F-Sharp) that are half an octave (or a tritone) apart and are then asked to determine whether the pitch of the sequence is descending or ascending. One such study, performed by Ms. Diana Deutsch, found that the listener's interpretation of ascending or descending pitch was influenced by the listener's language or dialect, showing variation between those raised in the south of England and those in California or from those in Vietnam and those in California whose native language was English.&lt;ref name="Deutsch, Diana" /&gt; A second study, performed in 2006 on a group of English speakers and 3 groups of East Asian students at University of Southern California, discovered that English speakers who had begun musical training at or before age 5 had an 8% chance of having perfect pitch.&lt;ref name="Deutsch, Diana" /&gt;

=== Speech phenomenology ===

==== The experience of speech ====
Casey O'Callaghan, in his article ''Experiencing Speech'', analyzes whether "the perceptual experience of listening to speech differs in phenomenal character"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Callaghan|first=Casey|date=2010|title=Experiencing Speech|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phis.2010.20.issue-1/issuetoc|journal=Philosophical Issue, Philosophy of Mind|volume=20|pages=305–327|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1533-6077.2010.00186.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; with regards to understanding the language being heard. He argues that an individual's experience when hearing a language they comprehend, as opposed to their experience when hearing a language they have no knowledge of, displays a difference in ''phenomenal features'' which he defines as "aspects of what an experience is like"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; for an individual.

If a subject who is a monolingual native English speaker is presented with a stimulus of speech in German, the string of phonemes will appear as mere sounds and will produce a very different experience than if this exact same stimulus was presented to a subject who speaks German.

He also examines how speech perception changes when one learning a language. If a subject with no knowledge of the Japanese language was presented with a stimulus of Japanese speech, and then was given the exact ''same'' stimuli after being taught Japanese, this ''same'' individual would have an extremely ''different'' experience.

==Research methods==
The methods used in speech perception research can be roughly divided into three groups: behavioral, computational, and, more recently, neurophysiological methods.

=== Behavioral methods ===
Behavioral experiments are based on an active role of a participant, i.e. subjects are presented with stimuli and asked to make conscious decisions about them. This can take the form of an identification test, a [[discrimination test]], similarity rating, etc. These types of experiments help to provide a basic description of how listeners perceive and categorize speech sounds.

==== Sinewave Speech ====
Speech perception has also been analyzed through sinewave speech, a form of synthetic speech where the human voice is replaced by sine waves that mimic the frequencies and amplitudes present in the original speech. When subjects are first presented with this speech, the sinewave speech is interpreted as random noises. But when the subjects are informed that the stimuli actually is speech and are told what is being said, "a distinctive, nearly immediate shift occurs"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to how the sinewave speech is perceived.

=== Computational methods ===
Computational modeling has also been used to simulate how speech may be processed by the brain to produce behaviors that are observed. Computer models have been used to address several questions in speech perception, including how the sound signal itself is processed to extract the acoustic cues used in speech, and how speech information is used for higher-level processes, such as word recognition.&lt;ref name="mcc1986"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McClelland, J.L. |author2=Elman, J.L. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1986 |title=The TRACE model of speech perception |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=18 |pages=1–86 |url=http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~jlm/papers/McClellandElman86.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-05-19 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(86)90015-0 |pmid=3753912 |issue=1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070421153000/http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~jlm/papers/McClellandElman86.pdf |archive-date=2007-04-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neurophysiological methods ===
Neurophysiological methods rely on utilizing information stemming from more direct and not necessarily conscious (pre-attentative) processes. Subjects are presented with speech stimuli in different types of tasks and the responses of the brain are measured. The brain itself can be more sensitive than it appears to be through behavioral responses. For example, the subject may not show sensitivity to the difference between two speech sounds in a discrimination test, but brain responses may reveal sensitivity to these differences.&lt;ref name=kawai/&gt; Methods used to measure neural responses to speech include [[event-related potential]]s, [[magnetoencephalography]], and [[near infrared spectroscopy]]. One important response used with [[event-related potential]]s is the [[mismatch negativity]], which occurs when speech stimuli are acoustically different from a stimulus that the subject heard previously.

Neurophysiological methods were introduced into speech perception research for several reasons:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Behavioral responses may reflect late, conscious processes and be affected by other systems such as orthography, and thus they may mask speaker's ability to recognize sounds based on lower-level acoustic distributions.''&lt;ref name="kaz"&gt;{{cite conference |author=Kazanina, N., Phillips, C., Idsardi, W. |year=2006 |title=The influence of meaning on the perception of speech sounds |booktitle=PNAS |volume=30 |pages=11381–11386 |url=http://aix1.uottawa.ca/~nkazanin/Papers/kazanina-phillips-idsardi_PNAS_2006_reprint.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-05-19 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Without the necessity of taking an active part in the test, even infants can be tested; this feature is crucial in research into acquisition processes. The possibility to observe low-level auditory processes independently from the higher-level ones makes it possible to address long-standing theoretical issues such as whether or not humans possess a specialized module for perceiving speech&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gocken, J.M.  |author2=Fox R.A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001 |title=Neurological Evidence in Support of a Specialized Phonetic Processing Module |journal=Brain and Language |volume=78 |pages=241–253 |doi=10.1006/brln.2001.2467 |pmid= 11500073 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dehaene-Lambertz, G., Pallier, C., Serniclaes, W., Sprenger-Charolles, L., Jobert, A., &amp; Dehaene, S. |year=2005 |title=Neural correlates of switching from auditory to speech perception |journal=NeuroImage |volume=24 |pages=21–33 |url=http://www.pallier.org/papers/Dehaene-LambertzPallier_Sinewaves_Neuroimgage_2004.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-07-04 |doi= 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.09.039 |pmid=15588593 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; or whether or not some complex acoustic invariance (see [[#Lack of invariance|lack of invariance]] above) underlies the recognition of a speech sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Näätänen, R. |year=2001 |title=The perception of speech sounds by the human brain as reflected by the mismatch negativity (MMN) and its magnetic equivalent (MMNm) |journal= Psychophysiology |volume=38 |pages=1–21 |doi=10.1111/1469-8986.3810001 |pmid=11321610 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
Research into speech perception (SP) has by no means explained every aspect of the processes involved. A lot of what has been said about SP is a matter of theory. Several theories have been devised to develop some of the above-mentioned and other unclear issues. Not all of them give satisfactory explanations of all problems, however the research they inspired has yielded a lot of useful data.

=== Speech mode hypothesis ===

Speech mode hypothesis is the idea that the perception of speech requires the use of specialized mental processing.&lt;ref name=Ingram&gt;{{cite book|last=Ingram|first=John. C.L.|title=Neurolinguistics: An Introduction to Spoken Language Processing and its Disorders|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=113–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=Ellen M. |author2=R.L. Diehl |author3=K.R. Kluender|title=Trading Relations in Speech and Non-speech|journal=Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics|year=1986|volume=39|issue=2|pages=129–142|doi=10.3758/bf03211495}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech mode hypothesis is a branch off of Fodor's modularity theory (see [[modularity of mind]]). It utilizes a vertical processing mechanism where limited stimuli are processed by special-purpose areas of the brain that are stimuli specific.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt;

Two versions of speech mode hypothesis:&lt;ref name="Ingram"/&gt;
* Weak version – listening to speech engages previous knowledge of language.
* Strong version – listening to speech engages specialized speech mechanisms for perceiving speech.

Three important experimental paradigms have evolved in the search to find evidence for the speech mode hypothesis. These are [[dichotic listening]], [[categorical perception]], and [[duplex perception]].&lt;ref name="Ingram"/&gt; Through the research in these categories it has been found that there may not be a specific speech mode but instead one for auditory codes that require complicated auditory processing. Also it seems that modularity is learned in perceptual systems.&lt;ref name="Ingram"/&gt; Despite this the evidence and counter-evidence for the speech mode hypothesis is still unclear and needs further research.

===Motor theory===
{{Main|Motor theory of speech perception}}
Some of the earliest work in the study of how humans perceive speech sounds was conducted by [[Alvin Liberman]] and his colleagues at [[Haskins Laboratories]].&lt;ref name="lib57"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liberman, A.M., Harris, K.S., Hoffman, H.S., Griffith, B.C. |year=1957 |title=The discrimination of speech sounds within and across phoneme boundaries |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=54 |pages=358–368 |url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/Reprints/HL0022.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-05-18 |doi=10.1037/h0044417 |pmid=13481283 |issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a speech synthesizer, they constructed speech sounds that varied in [[place of articulation]] along a continuum from {{IPA|/bɑ/}} to {{IPA|/dɑ/}} to {{IPA|/ɡɑ/}}. Listeners were asked to identify which sound they heard and to discriminate between two different sounds. The results of the experiment showed that listeners grouped sounds into discrete categories, even though the sounds they were hearing were varying continuously. Based on these results, they proposed the notion of [[categorical perception]] as a mechanism by which humans can identify speech sounds.

More recent research using different tasks and methods suggests that listeners are highly sensitive to acoustic differences within a single phonetic category, contrary to a strict categorical account of speech perception.

To provide a theoretical account of the [[categorical perception]] data, Liberman and colleagues&lt;ref name="lib67"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liberman, A.M., Cooper, F.S., Shankweiler, D.P., &amp; Studdert-Kennedy, M. |year=1967 |title=Perception of the speech code |journal=Psychological Review |volume=74 |pages=431–461 |url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/Reprints/HL0069.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-05-19 |doi=10.1037/h0020279 |pmid=4170865 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; worked out the motor theory of speech perception, where "the complicated articulatory encoding was assumed to be decoded in the perception of speech by the same processes that are involved in production"&lt;ref name="np"/&gt; (this is referred to as analysis-by-synthesis). For instance, the English consonant {{IPA|/d/}} may vary in its acoustic details across different phonetic contexts (see [[#Acoustic cues|above]]), yet all {{IPA|/d/}}'s as perceived by a listener fall within one category (voiced alveolar plosive) and that is because "linguistic representations are abstract, canonical, phonetic segments or the gestures that underlie these segments".&lt;ref name="np"/&gt; When describing units of perception, Liberman later abandoned articulatory movements and proceeded to the neural commands to the articulators&lt;ref name="lib70"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liberman, A.M. |year=1970 |title=The grammars of speech and language |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=301–323 |url= http://www.haskins.yale.edu/Reprints/HL0099.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-07-19 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(70)90018-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even later to intended articulatory gestures,&lt;ref name="lib85"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Liberman, A.M.  |author2=Mattingly, I.G.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1985 |title=The motor theory of speech perception revised |journal=Cognition |volume=21 |pages=1–36 |url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/Reprints/HL0519.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-07-19 |doi=10.1016/0010-0277(85)90021-6 |pmid=4075760 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus "the neural representation of the utterance that determines the speaker's production is the distal object the listener perceives".&lt;ref name="lib85"/&gt; The theory is closely related to the [[modularity of mind|modularity]] hypothesis, which proposes the existence of a special-purpose module, which is supposed to be innate and probably human-specific.

The theory has been criticized in terms of not being able to "provide an account of just how acoustic signals are translated into intended gestures"&lt;ref name=hay/&gt; by listeners. Furthermore, it is unclear how indexical information (e.g. talker-identity) is encoded/decoded along with linguistically relevant information.

===Direct realist theory===
The direct realist theory of speech perception (mostly associated with [[Carol Fowler]]) is a part of the more general theory of [[direct realism]], which postulates that perception allows us to have direct awareness of the world because it involves direct recovery of the [[distal stimulus|distal source]] of the event that is perceived. For speech perception, the theory asserts that the [[distal stimulus|objects of perception]] are actual vocal tract movements, or gestures, and not abstract phonemes or (as in the Motor Theory) events that are causally antecedent to these movements, i.e. intended gestures. Listeners perceive gestures not by means of a specialized decoder (as in the Motor Theory) but because information in the acoustic signal specifies the gestures that form it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Randy L. Diehl |author2=Andrew J. Lotto |author3=Lori L. Holt |year=2004 |title=Speech perception |journal=Annual Review of Psychology |volume=55 |issue=1 |pages=149–179 |doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.142028 |pmid=14744213}}&lt;/ref&gt; By claiming that the actual articulatory gestures that produce different speech sounds are themselves the units of speech perception, the theory bypasses the problem of [[#Lack of invariance|lack of invariance]].

===Fuzzy-logical model===
The fuzzy logical theory of speech perception developed by [[Dominic W. Massaro|Dominic Massaro]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Massaro, D.W. |year=1989 |title=Testing between the TRACE Model and the Fuzzy Logical Model of Speech perception |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=21 |pages=398–421 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(89)90014-5 |pmid=2758786 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that people remember speech sounds in a probabilistic, or graded, way. It suggests that people remember descriptions of the perceptual units of language, called prototypes. Within each prototype various features may combine. However, features are not just binary (true or false), there is a [[fuzzy logic|fuzzy]] value corresponding to how likely it is that a sound belongs to a particular speech category. Thus, when perceiving a speech signal our decision about what we actually hear is based on the relative goodness of the match between the stimulus information and values of particular prototypes. The final decision is based on multiple features or sources of information, even visual information (this explains the [[McGurk effect]]).&lt;ref name=hay&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayward |first=Katrina |title=Experimental Phonetics: An Introduction |publisher=Longman |location= Harlow |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer models of the fuzzy logical theory have been used to demonstrate that the theory's predictions of how speech sounds are categorized correspond to the behavior of human listeners.&lt;ref name="oden1978"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oden, G.C., Massaro, D.W. |year=1978 |title=Integration of featural information in speech perception |journal=Psychological Review |volume=85 |pages=172–191 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.85.3.172 |pmid=663005 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acoustic landmarks and distinctive features===
{{Main|Acoustic landmarks and distinctive features}}
In addition to the proposals of Motor Theory and Direct Realism about the relation between phonological features and articulatory gestures, [[Kenneth N. Stevens]] proposed another kind of relation: between phonological features and auditory properties. According to this view, listeners are inspecting the incoming signal for the so-called acoustic landmarks which are particular events in the spectrum carrying information about gestures which produced them. Since these gestures are limited by the capacities of humans' articulators and listeners are sensitive to their auditory correlates, the [[#Lack of invariance|lack of invariance]] simply does not exist in this model. The acoustic properties of the landmarks constitute the basis for establishing the distinctive features. Bundles of them uniquely specify phonetic segments (phonemes, syllables, words).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stevens, K.N. |year=2002 |title=Toward a model of lexical access based on acoustic landmarks and distinctive features |journal=Journal of the Acoustical Society of America |volume=111 |pmid=12002871 |pages=1872–1891 |url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~kjohnson/ling210/stevens2002.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |accessdate=2007-05-17 |doi=10.1121/1.1458026 |issue=4 |bibcode=2002ASAJ..111.1872S |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609151908/http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~kjohnson/ling210/stevens2002.pdf |archive-date=2007-06-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exemplar theory===
Exemplar models of speech perception differ from the four theories mentioned above which suppose that there is no connection between word- and talker-recognition and that the variation across talkers is "noise" to be filtered out.

The exemplar-based approaches claim listeners store information for both word- and talker-recognition. According to this theory, particular instances of speech sounds are stored in the memory of a listener. In the process of speech perception, the remembered instances of e.g. a syllable stored in the listener's memory are compared with the incoming stimulus so that the stimulus can be categorized. Similarly, when recognizing a talker, all the memory traces of utterances produced by that talker are activated and the talker's identity is determined. Supporting this theory are several experiments reported by Johnson&lt;ref name=john/&gt; that suggest that our signal identification is more accurate when we are familiar with the talker or when we have visual representation of the talker's gender. When the talker is unpredictable or the sex misidentified, the error rate in word-identification is much higher.

The exemplar models have to face several objections, two of which are (1) insufficient memory capacity to store every utterance ever heard and, concerning the ability to produce what was heard, (2) whether also the talker's own articulatory gestures are stored or computed when producing utterances that would sound as the auditory memories.&lt;ref name=john/&gt;&lt;ref name=hay/&gt;

'''Farid''' and '''Rami Chehade''', who perform professionally as '''the Chehade Brothers''', are Palestinian-Lebanese [[musician]]s and [[singer]]s.

Natives of the [[Old City of Jerusalem]], Farid (born in 1975) and Rami (born in 1976) Chehade started studying music at a very young age and have come to master the oriental musical and poetical art forms of [[zajal]], [[ghazal]], [[hija'a]] and [[taqsim]].  Their professional career as ''The Chehade Brothers'' was launched by multifaceted artist and producer [[Michel Elefteriades]]. While Rami is the singer in the band, both brothers demonstrate virtuosity in playing all known Arabic musical instruments, ranging from melodic instruments like [[oud]], [[buzuq]], [[kanun (instrument)|kanun]], [[kamanja]] and [[ney]] to rhythmic instruments like [[tabla]], [[katem]] and [[riq]].

==Career==
Until the late 1990s, Farid and Rami Chehade had performed in numerous concerts in a number of Arab countries and in some international festivals representing [[Middle Eastern music]] around the world. Yet, the two brothers were dreaming of a career well beyond the patriotic and revolutionary scene or the circuit of cultural festivals where they merely performed folkloric Palestinian songs; they wanted to make their mark on "[[popular music]]" in its broadest sense, taking into consideration all the implications that this may carry. Therefore, they headed to [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], where they joined the newly established Oriental Roots Orchestra, an oriental-fashion "[[big band]]" formed by [[Michel Elefteriades]] with the goal of grouping most outstanding musicians from the [[Arab world]]. This collaboration has enriched their compositions with various ethnic influences, making their musical style evolve towards [[World music]] [[Fusion (music)|fusion]], while keeping clearly Middle Eastern roots; a style promoted as belonging to "Nowheristani" music. [[Image:Chehade Brothers2.jpg|right|thumb|The Chehade Brothers on stage. Farid(right) and Rami Chehade.]]

===Album===
Their collaboration with Michel Elefteriades has also yielded the Chehade Brothers' first album. Composed by the two brothers and arranged by Elefteriades, the album captures the time-honored [[Taarab|Tarab]] mood. They were helped by poet Elia Azar who contributed to the album a set of poetic lyrics that only the talent of the brothers, coupled with Elefteriades' mastery of [[World Music]] fusion, could turn into such subtle music, best known in the eastern notion as "inaccessible simplicity". This first album, titled “A Bridge Over the Mediterranean”, was released by [[Warner Music]] in 2004. [[Image:RamiChehade.jpg|right|thumb|Rami Chehade]]

===Award nominations===
The Chehade Brothers were nominated for two [[World music (Awards)|BBC Awards for World Music]] in 2005:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/world/awards2005/nominees.shtml BBC Radio 3 Awards for World Music 2005 - Nominees]&lt;/ref&gt;  
* BBC Radio 3 World Music Awards
* BBC Radio 3 Audience Awards (Finalists)
[[Image:FaridChehade.jpg|right|thumb|Farid Chehade]]

===Present===
In 2005, the Chehade Brothers began touring throughout [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], performing in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Spain]], [[Turkey]], [[Cyprus]], [[Bahrain]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Morocco]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]].

He is the earliest Greek poet who claims explicitly to be writing for future generations, creating "fame that will reach all of Greece, and never die while the Greek kind of songs survives."&lt;ref&gt;See {{Citation | surname=Dalby | given=Andrew | title=Rediscovering Homer | publisher=Norton | place=New York, London | year=2006 | ISBN=0-393-05788-7 }} p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Xenophanes was a native of [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], a city in [[Ionia]] (now western [[Turkey]]). Some say he was the son of Orthomenes, others the son of Dexius.&lt;ref name="dl18"&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ix. 18&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to have flourished during the 60th [[Olympiad]] (540-537 BC).&lt;ref name="dl20"&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ix. 20&lt;/ref&gt; His surviving work refers to [[Thales]], [[Epimenides]], and [[Pythagoras]],&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ix. 18, i. 23, 111. viii. 36&lt;/ref&gt; and he himself is mentioned in the writings of [[Heraclitus]] and [[Epicharmus]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ix. 1; Aristotle, ''Metaphysics'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Met.+4.1010a 4.1010a]&lt;/ref&gt;  In a fragment of his elegies, he describes the [[Medes|Median]]  [[Persian invasions|invasion]] as an event that took place in his time, possibly referring to the expedition of [[Harpagus]] against the Greek cities in [[Ionia]] (546/5 BC). He left his native land as a fugitive or exile and went to the Ionian colonies in Sicily, [[Zancle]] and [[Catana]].&lt;ref name="dl18"/&gt; He probably lived for some time in [[Velia|Elea]] (founded by the [[Phocaea]]ns in the 61st Olympiad 536-533 BC), since he wrote about the foundation of that colony.&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laertius, ix. 18, 20; comp. Aristotle, ''Rhetoric'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Rh.+2.23.27 2.23.27]&lt;/ref&gt; According to an elegy reputedly composed when he was 92 years old,&lt;ref name="dl19"&gt;Diogenes Laertius, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0258%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D2 ix. 19]&lt;/ref&gt; he left his native land at the age of 25 and then lived 67 years in other Greek lands.&lt;ref name="dl19"/&gt;

==Poems==
According to biographer [[Diogenes Laërtius]], Xenophanes wrote in hexameters and also composed elegies and iambics against [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]].&lt;ref name="dl18"/&gt; Laertius also mentions two historical poems concerning the founding of Colophon and Elea, but of these, only the titles have been preserved.&lt;ref name="dl20"/&gt; There is no good authority that says that Xenophanes wrote a philosophical poem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/burnet/egp.htm Early Greek Philosophy by John Burnet, 3rd edition (1920)]: "The oldest reference to a poem Περὶ φύσεως is in the Geneva scholium on ''Iliad'' xxi. 196 (quoting fr. 30), and this goes back to [[Crates of Mallus]]. We must remember that such titles are of later date, and Xenophanes had been given a place among philosophers long before the time of rates. All we can say, therefore, is that the Pergamene librarians gave the title Περὶ φύσεως to some poem of Xenophanes."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] writes that he had never met with the verses about the earth stretching infinitely downwards (fr. 28), even though he had access to many philosophical works. Several of the philosophical fragments are derived from commentators on Homer.&lt;ref&gt;Three fragments (27, 31, 33) come from the ''Homeric Allegories'', two (30, 32) are from Homeric scholia.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus likely that the philosophical remarks of Xenophanes were expressed incidentally in his satires.&lt;ref name="burnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicpersuasion.org/pw/burnet/egp.htm |title=Early Greek Philosophy by John Burnet, 3rd edition (1920) |publisher=Classicpersuasion.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satires are called ''Silloi'' by late writers, and this name may go back to Xenophanes himself, but it may originate in the fact that [[Timon of Phlius]], the "sillographer" (3rd century BC), put much of his own satire upon philosophers into the mouth of Xenophanes.&lt;ref name="burnet"/&gt;

==Theology==
Xenophanes' surviving writings display a skepticism that became more commonly expressed during the fourth century BC. He satirized traditional religious views of his time as human [[Psychological projection|projections]].&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, Karsten Friis [https://books.google.com/books?id=3waGV4BJmfQC&amp;pg=PA49 ''A history of ancient philosophy: from the beginnings to Augustine''] p.49&lt;/ref&gt; He aimed his critique at the polytheistic religious views of earlier Greek poets and of his own contemporaries: "Homer and Hesiod," one fragment states, "have attributed to the gods all sorts of things that are matters of reproach and censure among men: theft, adultery, and mutual deception." [[Sextus Empiricus]] reported that&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Mathematicians'', I.289, and IX.192f.&lt;/ref&gt; such observations were appreciated by [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologists]].  Xenophanes is quoted, memorably, in [[Clement of Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;Clement, ''Miscellanies'' V.110 and VII.22.&lt;/ref&gt; arguing against the conception of gods as fundamentally anthropomorphic:
&lt;blockquote&gt;But if cattle and horses and lions had hands&lt;br&gt;or could paint with their hands and create works such as men do,&lt;br&gt;horses like horses and cattle like cattle&lt;br&gt;also would depict the gods' shapes and make their bodies&lt;br&gt;of such a sort as the form they themselves have.&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;[[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] say that their gods are snub–nosed [σιμούς] and black&lt;br&gt;[[Thracians]] that they are pale and red-haired.&lt;ref&gt;Diels-Kranz, ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', Xenophanes frr. 15-16. Many other translations of this passage have Xenophanes state that the Thracians were "blond".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
An additional criticism of the gods is found in the quote&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The gods have not, of course, revealed all things to mortals&lt;br&gt;
:from the beginning;
but rather, seeking in the course of time, they discover&lt;br&gt;
:what is better.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Trzaskoma, R. Scott Smith, Stephen Brunet, Thomas G. Palaima; ''Anthology of Classical Myth: Primary Sources in Translation'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=K4pZr3JfYqcC&amp;pg=PA43 p. 433].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Other passages quoted by Clement of Alexandria that argue against the traditional Greek conception of gods include:

# "One god, greatest among gods and humans,&lt;br&gt;like mortals neither in form nor in thought."&lt;ref name="osborne62"&gt;Osborne, Catherine. "Chapter 4." ''Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford UP. 62. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
# "But mortals think that the gods are born&lt;br&gt;and have the mortals' own clothes and voice and form."&lt;ref name="osborne62"/&gt;

Regarding Xenophanes' theology five key concepts about God can be formed. God is: beyond human morality, does not resemble human form, cannot die or be born (God is divine thus eternal), no divine hierarchy exists, and God does not intervene in human affairs.&lt;ref name="mckirahan6062"&gt;McKirahan, Richard D. "Xenophanes of Colophon. ''Philosophy Before Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1994. 60-62. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While Xenophanes is rejecting Homeric theology, he is not questioning the presence of a divine entity, rather his philosophy is a critique on Ancient Greek writers and their conception of divinity.&lt;ref&gt;McKirahan, Richard D. "Xenophanes of Colophon. ''Philosophy Before Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1994. 61. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the concept of God being whole with the universe, essentially controlling it, while at the same time being physically unconnected.&lt;ref name="mckirahan6062"/&gt;

Xenophanes espoused a belief that "[[God]] is one, supreme among gods and men, and not like mortals in body or in mind."&lt;ref&gt;Zeller, Vorsokrastische Philosophie, p. 530, n. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained there was one greatest God. God is one eternal being, spherical in form, comprehending all things within himself, is the absolute [[Nous|mind]] and thought,&lt;ref name="dl19" /&gt; therefore is intelligent, and moves all things, but bears no resemblance to human nature either in body or mind. He is considered by some to be a precursor to [[Parmenides]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. Because of his development of the concept of a "one [[god]] greatest among gods and men" that is abstract, universal, unchanging, immobile and always present, Xenophanes is often seen as one of the first [[Monotheism|monotheists]], in the [[Western world|Western]] philosophy of [[religion]], although the quotation that seems to point to Xenophanes's monotheism also refers to multiple "gods" who the supreme God is greater than. Physicist and philosopher [[Max Bernhard Weinstein]] specifically identified Xenophanes as one of the earliest [[pandeist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Max Bernhard Weinsten, ''Welt- und Lebensanschauungen, Hervorgegangen aus Religion, Philosophie und Naturerkenntnis'' ("World and Life Views, Emerging From Religion, Philosophy and Nature") (1910), page 231: "Pandeistisch ist, wenn der Eleate Xenophanes (aus Kolophon um 580-492 v. Chr.) von Gott gesagt haben soll: "Er ist ganz und gar Geist und Gedanke und ewig", "er sieht ganz und gar, er denkt ganz und gar, er hört ganz und gar."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metaphysics ==
Xenophanes wrote about two extremes predominating the world: wet and dry or water (ὕδωρ) and earth (γῆ).&lt;ref name="mckirahan65"&gt;McKirahan, Richard D. "Xenophanes of Colophon. ''Philosophy Before Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1994. 65. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; These two extreme states would alternate between one another, and with the alternation human life would become extinct, then regenerate (or vice versa depending on the dominant form).&lt;ref name="mckirahan66"&gt;McKirahan, Richard D. "Xenophanes of Colophon. ''Philosophy Before Socrates''. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing Company, 1994. 66. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of alternating states and human life perishing and coming back suggests he believed in the principle of causation, another distinguishing step that Xenophanes takes away from Ancient philosophical traditions to ones based more on scientific observation.&lt;ref name="mckirahan66"/&gt; The argument can be considered a rebuke to Anaximenes' air theory.&lt;ref name="mckirahan65"/&gt; A detailed account of the wet and dry form theory is found in [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]]' ''[[Refutation of All Heresies]]''.

He also holds that there is an infinite number of worlds, not overlapping in time.&lt;ref name="dl19" /&gt;

Xenophanes concluded from his examination of [[fossil]]s that [[water]] once must have covered all of the [[Earth]]'s surface. The use of evidence is an important step in advancing from simply stating an idea to backing it up by evidence and observation.&lt;ref name="mckirahan66"/&gt;

== Epistemology ==

Xenophanes is credited with being one of the first philosophers to distinguish between true belief and knowledge, which he further developed into the prospect that you can know something but not really know it.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Catherine. "Chapter 4." ''Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford UP. 66-67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of whole works by Xenophanes, a lot of meaning is lost and a large amount of guessing is at hand, so that the implication of knowing being something deeper ("a clearer truth") may have special implications, or it may mean that you cannot know something just by looking at it.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Catherine. "Chapter 4." ''Presocratic Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford UP. 67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that the most and widest variety of evidence was considered by Xenophanes to be the surest way to prove a theory.&lt;ref name="mckirahan66"/&gt;

His [[epistemology]], which is still influential today, held that there actually exists a [[truth]] of [[reality]], but that humans as mortals are unable to know it. [[Karl Popper]] read Xenophanes as saying that it is possible to act only on the basis of working [[hypotheses]]—we may act as if we knew the truth, as long as we know that this is extremely unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;K. Popper, A. Friemuth Petersen, J. Mejer: [https://books.google.com/books?id=V76PlyggwQkC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=B34 The World of Parmenides, p. 46]&lt;/ref&gt; Xenophanes' views then might serve as a basis of [[Critical rationalism]].

In today's philosophical and classics discourse, Xenophanes is seen as one of the most important [[presocratic philosophy|presocratic philosophers]]. It had also been common since antiquity to see him as the teacher of [[Zeno of Elea]], the colleague of [[Parmenides]], and generally associated with the [[Eleatic school]], but common opinion today is likewise that this is false.&lt;ref&gt;Lesher, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one fragment dealing with the management of a feast, another which denounces the exaggerated importance attached to athletic victories, and several which deny the humanized gods of Homer. Arguments such as these made Xenophanes infamous for his attacks on "conventional military and athletic virtues of the time" and well known to side with the intellectual instead.&lt;ref name="yorku1"/&gt;

'''Ángel Rama''' ({{IPA-es|ˈaŋxel rama}}; April 30, 1926{{spaced ndash}}November 27, 1983) was a [[Uruguay]]an writer, academic, and [[literary criticism|literary critic]], known for his work on ''[[modernismo]]'' and for his theorization of the concept of "[[transculturation]]."

==Biography==
Born in [[Montevideo]] to [[Galician people|Galician]] immigrants, Rama studied at the [[Collège de France]]. He married twice: in 1950, to the poet [[Ida Vitale]], with whom he had two children, Claudio and Amparo; and after separating from Vitale in 1969, to Marta Traba, an eminent art critic, originally from Buenos Aires.

In the 1960s, after several years teaching at the secondary and university level, he became director of the department of Hispanoamerican literature at the [[Universidad de la República]], the Uruguayan state-run University. He also founded the publishing houses Editorial Arca in Montevideo and Editorial Galerna in Buenos Aires. During the 1970s, he held professorships at numerous universities in the Americas and served as literary adviser to the [[Ayacucho Library]] in [[Caracas]]. The ''[[coup d'état]]'' of the Uruguayan government surprised him on June 27, 1973, while residing in [[Venezuela]], so he lived in exile for the remainder of his life.

He was a member of Uruguay's "Generation of '45," also known as the "Critical Generation": [[Carlos Maggi]], [[Manuel Flores Mora]], [[Emir Rodríguez Monegal]], [[Idea Vilariño]], [[Carlos Real de Azúa]], [[Carlos Martínez Moreno]], [[Mario Arregui]], [[Mauricio Muller]], [[José Pedro Díaz]], [[Amanda Berenguer]], [[Tola Invernizzi]], [[Mario Benedetti]], [[Ida Vitale]], [[Líber Falco]], [[Juan Cunha]], [[Juan Carlos Onetti]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com.uy/Suple/EntrevistasDeDicandia/03/05/24/dicandia_42137.asp Generación del 45: severa en la crítica y brillante en la creación.]&lt;/ref&gt;

He contributed frequently to the weekly review ''[[Marcha (newspaper)|Marcha]]'' until its suppression in 1974 by the military government of [[Juan María Bordaberry]]. He published important studies on the writings of Ruben Darío, Jose Marti, Jose Maria Arguedas, Juan Carlos Onetti, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Mario Vargas Llosa, among others. Three of his seminal works are ''Transculturacion narrativa en America Latina'', ''La ciudad letrada'' and ''Las mascaras democraticas del modernismo''. Rama's interest and study of the relationships between literacy, power and the complex urban spaces of Latin America led him to develop the concept of the "lettered city," in which networks of various forms of literacy entwine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drucker|first=Johanna|year=2010|title=Species of Espaces and other spurious concepts addressed to reading the invisible features of signs within systems of relations|journal=Design and Culture|volume=2|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1979, Rama was given an appointment as a professor at the University of Maryland and with Traba they settled in nearby [[Washington, DC]]. However, in 1982 they were denied resident visas and were forced to leave the United States. The couple moved to Paris, where they were living in early 1983 when Traba was granted Colombian citizenship by President [[Belisario Betancur]].

He died in the crash of [[Avianca Flight 011]] at [[Barajas Airport]], along with [[Marta Traba]], the Mexican writer [[Jorge Ibargüengoitia]], and Peruvian poet [[Manuel Scorza]], while all four were travelling from Paris to Colombia for an international conference of Latin American writers.
