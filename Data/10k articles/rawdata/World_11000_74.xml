      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1894">The '''2007 Koidu-Sefadu protest''' was a protest by 400 [[Sierra Leone]]ans in the town of [[Koidu-Sefadu]] in [[Eastern Province, Sierra Leone|Eastern Province]]. The protest was aimed at the local diamond [[Mining|mine]] which the residents claimed to have harmed both them and the local environment. The result of the protest was a clampdown by Sierra Leonean police and the death of 2 protesters.

==Background==
Sierra Leoneans had flocked to the country's largest mine after the election of [[Ernest Bai Koroma]] in September 2007. On 12 December, the government removed the miners after it was agreed that the miners could keep any diamonds uncovered during their work.

==14 December==
On 14 December, local police were ordered into the mine area to protect the [[Koidu Holdings]] company which runs the mine. Protesters had gathered at the gate, seeking housing and increased compensation for their sufferings. The police used live ammunition and tear gas to disperse the protesters, killing two and injuring eight others.

==Official reaction==
On the issue of resettlement of displaced villagers, [[Ministry of Mineral Resources (Sierra Leone)|Minister of Mineral Resources]] [[Alhaji]] [[Abubakarr Jalloh (politician)|Abubakarr Jalloh]] said the "company is relatively slow in building the resettlement". Minister Jalloh also sought for the miners to leave the area. President Koroma temporarily halted diamond mining across the country as a result of the incident.

'''Baba Mohammed ben-Osman''' or Muhammad V ben Othman was [[Dey]] of [[Ottoman Algeria]] from 1766 to 1791.  Under his rule he declared war against [[Denmark-Norway]] because he demanded that an annual payment to stave off piracy by Denmark-Norway should be increased, and he should receive new gifts. [[Denmark-Norway]] refused the demands, beginning the [[Danish-Algerian War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Krigen mod Algier|url=http://natmus.dk/historisk-viden/temaer/militaerhistorie/danmarks-krige/krigen-mod-algier/|website=natmus.dk|publisher=[[National Museum of Denmark]] |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4697">The '''United Nations Programme of Action on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States''', popularly referred to as the '''Barbados Program of Action''' ('''BPOA'''), is a policy document that both: comprehensively addresses the economic, environmental, and social developmental vulnerabilities facing islands; and outlines a strategy that seeks to mitigate those vulnerabilities. It remains the only internationally approved programme specific to [[Small Island Developing States]] (SIDS) which has been collectively and unanimously endorsed by SIDS.

== Development of the BPOA ==
The full text of the BPOA was produced in [[Bridgetown, Barbados]] in 1994 at the first Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island States, a conference mandated by United Nations [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] [[Resolution (law)|Resolution]] 47/189. The need for an islands specific conference was highlighted some two years prior at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ([[Earth Summit]]), held in [[Rio de Janeiro]] where 179 governments voted to adopt [[Agenda 21]]. Chapter 17, section G of [[Agenda 21]] acknowledges that "small island developing states are a special case both for environment and development ... [and] are considered extremely vulnerable to global warming and sealevel rise."

== BPOA+5 ==
In 1999, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the UN held a special session to appraise five years of progress on the implementation of the BPOA (BPOA +5). The Assembly recognized progress as 'uneven' and identified key trends including increasing [[globalization]], widening inequalities in income and a continued deterioration of the global environment. A new General Assembly [[Resolution (law)|Resolution]] (S-22/2) promised further action.

== BPOA+10 ==
The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, agreed to at the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] ([[Earth Summit 2002]]) affirmed UN commitment to 'full implementation' of Agenda 21, alongside achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]], the BPOA, and other international agreements. To this end, it recommended the convening of an International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Program of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] of the UN passed [[Resolution (law)|Resolutions]] 57/262 and 58/213, which mandated an International Meeting to Review the Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States to take place. The meeting was held in [[Port Louis, Mauritius]] between January 10-14, 2005. The final report emerging from this meeting significantly revised the original BPOA, and verified what previous reviews were alluding to, that the implementation of the BPOA had been largely unsuccessful. What emerged from it was a reorganising of the Programs "priority areas" and an entrenched commitment to the notion that economic growth would ultimately contribute to sustainable development.

The '''Battle of Finta''' (27 May 1653) was a confrontation between [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Prince]] [[Matei Basarab]]'s [[Wallachia]]n army and a combined [[Moldavia]]n–[[Cossack Hetmanate|Cossack]]–[[Crimean Khanate|Tatar]] force under [[List of rulers of Moldavia|Prince]] [[Vasile Lupu]] and [[Tymofiy Khmelnytsky]]. It took place around [[Finta, Dâmbovița|Finta]], now a [[Commune in Romania|commune]] in [[Dâmbovița County]], [[Romania]]. 

The battle began by an attack of [[Moldavian military forces|Moldavian infantry]] and Tatar–Cossack cavalrymen. From the beginning, the Moldavians, Tatars and Cossacks were driven back by the [[Wallachian military forces]] and Lithuanian defenders. Subsequently, both armies advanced to meet in a marshland, where a great [[melee]] began. Wallachians, Polish-Lithuanians, ''[[Seimeni]]'' Serb and Hungarian mercenaries destroyed the entire force of Cossacks and Tatars, with their swords and bayonets; the Moldavians, alongside the [[Holy Roman Empire|German and Austrian]] mercenaries, retreated a kilometer to prepare for the attacks. They resisted a series of attacks by the Wallachian-led combined troops, until finally the Wallachians bombarded their positions. The German and Austrian mercenaries were all killed during the bombardment. 1,000 Moldavians, 4,000 Cossacks and 1,000 Tatars were taken as prisoners, and mistreated by Wallachians. Almost half of them perished in captivity or were [[Slavery in Romania|sold as slaves]].

The battle was a Wallachian decisive victory, resulting in the ousting of the Moldavian Prince and his replacement with [[Gheorghe Ștefan]]. There was a brief Wallachian occupation of [[Iași]], and a siege of [[Suceava]] (where Tymofiy was killed).

{{Campaignbox French conquest of Algeria}}

The '''Battle of the Smala''' was fought in 1843 between [[France]] and [[Algeria]]n resistance fighters during the [[French conquest of Algeria]].  The French, led by [[Henri d'Orleans, duke of Aumale]], raided the encampment (known as a ''smala'' or ''zmelah'') of Algerian resistance leader [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Abd al-Qadir]] on 16 May 1843, while al-Qadir was absent on a raiding expedition.  The 500 French cavalrymen surprised the camp defenders, who fired a single volley before scattering. More than 3,000 of al-Qadir's followers (out of a camp population of 30,000) were captured, as were many of his possessions, including his warchest and a library valued at £5,000.  Three days later, another 2,500 followers were captured.

Al-Qadir fled to [[Morocco]] later that year, triggering French pressure on Morocco and the advent of the [[First Franco-Moroccan War]] in 1844. He was eventually captured in 1847, ending major Algerian resistance to the French colonial occupation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26366">'''Broadcast signal intrusion''' is the hijacking of [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] signals of [[Radio broadcasting|radio]], [[television station]]s, [[cable television]] broadcast feeds or satellite signals. Hijacking incidents have involved local TV and radio stations as well as cable and national networks.

Although television, cable and satellite broadcast signal intrusions tend to receive more media coverage, radio station intrusions are more frequent, as many simply rebroadcast a signal received from another radio station. All that is required is an [[Transmitter|FM transmitter]] that can overpower the same frequency as the station being rebroadcast. Other methods that have been used in North America to intrude on legal broadcasts include breaking into the transmitter area and splicing audio directly into the feed.&lt;ref name="Splicing"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[cable television]] operator connects itself in the signal path between individual stations and the system's subscribers, broadcasters have fallen victim to signal tampering on cable systems on multiple occasions.

== Confirmed events ==

=== "Vrillon" on Southern Television ===
{{Main|Southern Television broadcast interruption}}
On November 26, 1977, an audio message, purporting to come from outer space, was broadcast during an [[ITN]] news bulletin on [[Southern Television]] in the UK. The intrusion did not affect the video signal but replaced the programme audio with warnings as to the destiny of the human race and a disaster to affect "your world and the beings on other worlds around you". The [[Independent Broadcasting Authority|IBA]] confirmed that it was the first time such a transmission had been made. None of the individuals responsible for the intrusion have been identified, although some people believe that the message could have originated from an alien race.&lt;ref name="times01"&gt;{{cite news|title=Source of hoax space broadcast stays a mystery|date=28 November 1977|work=The Times|pages=2, col. E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Captain Midnight on HBO ===
{{Main|Captain Midnight broadcast signal intrusion}}
[[File:hbocaptainmidnight.jpg|thumb|right|MacDougall's message as seen by HBO viewers, behind the [[SMPTE color bars]].]]
At 12:32 am [[North American Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] on April 27, 1986, [[HBO]] (Home Box Office) had its satellite signal feed from its operations center on [[Long Island]] in [[Hauppauge, New York]] interrupted by a man calling himself "Captain Midnight". The interruption occurred during a presentation of ''[[The Falcon and the Snowman]]''. The intrusion lasted between 4 and 5 minutes and was seen by viewers along the East Coast. The man, who during the interruption also threatened to hijack the signals of [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] and [[The Movie Channel]], was later caught and identified as John R. MacDougall of [[Ocala, Florida]]. He was prosecuted shortly thereafter. Authorities were tipped off by a man from [[Wisconsin]] in a phone booth at a rest area off [[Interstate 75 in Florida|Interstate 75]] in [[Gainesville, Florida]]. The man filing the report said that he overheard MacDougall bragging about it.

MacDougall's guilt was confirmed by an FCC investigation that showed he was alone at Central Florida Teleport at the time of the incident and a recording of the jamming video showed that the text was created by a [[character generator]] at that location. He was charged with transmitting without a radio license in violation of {{UnitedStatesCode|47|301}}. MacDougall pleaded guilty and was fined $5,000 and served a year probation. Ambiguity about whether the 47 USC 301 charge was applicable since the transmitter had a license resulted in the passage of {{UnitedStatesCode|18|1367}} which made satellite jamming a [[felony]].

MacDougall was able to perform the intrusion while working a second job as a master control operator at a satellite [[Earth station#Telecommunications port|teleport]] in Florida, where he worked to make ends meet due to declining income from his satellite TV equipment business. He stated that he did it because he was frustrated with HBO's service rates, and that it was hurting his business selling satellite dishes (hence his second job at the teleport). The message, placed over [[SMPTE color bars]], broadcast by MacDougall read:
{{Clear}}{{quote|&lt;center&gt;GOODEVENING HBO&lt;br /&gt;FROM CAPTAIN MIDNIGHT&lt;br /&gt;$12.95/MONTH  ?&lt;br /&gt;NO WAY !&lt;br /&gt;[SHOWTIME/MOVIE CHANNEL BEWARE!]&lt;/center&gt;}}

=== "Religious" takeover ===
Playboy's satellite network was intentionally "jammed" with a text-only message on the night of Sunday, September 6, 1987.  The message read, "Thus sayeth the Lord thy God.  Remember the Sabbath and keep it holy.  Repent for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand."  (The verses were taken from Exodus 20:8 and Matthew 4:17 in the Bible.)

The white text and black background of the message prevented viewers from seeing the movie that Playboy was running at the time called ''Three Daughters''.  (Playboy's feed was on RCA Satcom 4, transponder 24.)

Thomas Haynie of Virginia Beach, Virginia was convicted of satellite piracy in September 1990 in Norfolk, Virginia federal court in connection with the incident.  Haynie was an uplink engineer at the Christian Broadcasting Network, a television ministry in Virginia Beach.  He was on duty at the time of the jamming.&lt;ref name="resource.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://law.resource.org/pub/us/case/reporter/F2/940/940.F2d.653.91-5000.html|title=940 F.2d 653|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to investigators, it was the religious content of the transmission and the type of equipment used that drew them to CBN. The jamming signal left behind subtle technical clues that were captured on a VHS recording made at Playboy's uplink at the time of the event – like finding "fingerprints" in the video. After investigators were confident that they identified the brand of transmitter and character generator from the video, they concluded that CBN was the culprit.&lt;ref name="resource.org"/&gt;
CBN maintained that the FCC's case was entirely circumstantial since there were no witnesses and the signal could not be traced to a point of origin. During the investigation, experts on both sides attempted to recreate the incident with CBN's equipment. According to CBN spokesman Dino McCann they were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=TrialSet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/1990-05-24/news/9005240158_1_cbn-mr-christian-broadcasting-network|title=Trial Set In Jamming Of Playboy Channel|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, CBN asserted that there was not enough power for Haynie to jam Playboy's signal&lt;ref name=TrialSet/&gt; but during the trial, government witnesses said the CBN station was capable of interfering with satellite transmissions.&lt;ref name="dailypress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.dailypress.com/1990-09-25/news/9009300294_1_verdict-playboy-channel-jury|title=Federal Jury Convicts Cbn Technician|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After initially being deadlocked, the jury eventually sided with the prosecution and convicted Haynie on two of six counts (Haynie was also accused of interfering with the American Exxxtacy channel on GTE Spacenet 1 on the same date; however, a recording of the event was of such poor quality that it was unusable and Haynie was acquitted of the associated charges). Haynie received three years of probation, a $1000 fine, and 150 hours of community service.&lt;ref name="dailypress.com"/&gt; Haynie has always maintained his innocence.

=== Max Headroom incident ===
[[File:Max Headroom broadcast signal intrusion.jpg|right|thumb|Screen shot of the Max Headroom hijacker.]]
{{Main|Max Headroom broadcast signal intrusion}}
On November 22, 1987, an unidentified man wearing a [[Max Headroom (character)|Max Headroom]] mask appeared on the signals of two television stations in [[Chicago]]. [[Independent station]] [[WGN-TV]], owned by [[Tribune Broadcasting]], was hijacked first. The intrusion occurred during the sports report on its 9:00 pm newscast and lasted about 25 seconds. Then came [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] station [[WTTW]], where the man was seen and heard uttering garbled remarks before dropping his [[trousers]], partially exposing his [[buttocks]], and was then spanked with a flyswatter before the screen went black. The next interception occurred at about 11:00 pm during an episode of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial, "[[Horror of Fang Rock]]", and lasted almost 90 seconds. None of the individuals responsible for the intrusion have been identified. This incident got the attention of the [[CBS Evening News]] the next day and was talked about nationwide. The HBO incident was also mentioned in the same news report.

=== "Telewizja Solidarność" (TV Solidarity) ===

In September 1985, four astronomers at [[Poland]]'s [[University of Toruń]], Zygmunt Turło, Leszek Zaleski, Piotr Łukaszewski and Jan Hanasz, used a home computer, a synchronizing circuit, and a transmitter to superimpose messages in support of the labor movement Solidarność ([[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]) over state-run television broadcasts in Toruń, including an episode of ''[[07 zgłoś się]]''. The messages read "''Dość podwyżek cen, kłamstw i represji. Solidarność Toruń''" ("Enough price increases, lies, and repressions. Solidarity Toruń") and "''Bojkot wyborów naszym obowiązkiem.''" ("It is our duty to [[election boycott|boycott the election]]", referring to the [[Polish legislative election, 1985|rigged Sejm elections of 1985]]) with the Solidarity logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w.icm.edu.pl/tvS/tvs.htm |title=(polish) |publisher=W.icm.edu.pl |date=2006-05-18 |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206064447/http://w.icm.edu.pl/tvS/tvs.htm |archivedate=2009-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The four men were eventually discovered and were charged with "possession of an unlicensed radio transmitter and publication of materials that could cause public unrest". At their sentencing, the judge noted their prize winning work in the Polish scientific community and gave each of them probation and a fine of the equivalent of US$100 each (or 3,000,000 old złoty, 300 [[Polish złoty|PLN]] in today's currency).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w.icm.edu.pl/tvS/pirat.htm |title=(english) |publisher=W.icm.edu.pl |date=1985-09-14 |accessdate=2009-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326080522/http://w.icm.edu.pl/tvS/pirat.htm |archivedate=2009-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The era of Soviet pirate broadcasting ===
Broadcast signal intrusion was a common practice in the [[USSR]] during the 1970s and 1980s due to the absence of and high demand for any non-government broadcasting.&lt;ref name="csm01"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1984/0118/011818.html/(page)/2|title='Lords' and 'Knights' defy Soviet authority, 'pollute' the airwaves |date=January 18, 1984|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|accessdate=8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1966, there was a report of an incident in the city of [[Kaluga]] where an 18 year old broadcast a hoax announcement that nuclear war had broken out with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19660929&amp;id=UNQiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2ycEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7175,5708798&amp;hl=en|title=Soviet 'Pirate Radios' Spark Government Ire|date=September 29, 1966|work=[[The Milkawaukee Journal]]|accessdate=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1970s so many pirates were operating around the city of [[Arkhangelsk]], especially at night, that local people were urged to telephone reports of violators to a special number.&lt;ref name="csm01"/&gt;

Hijackers using call signs such as "cucumber", "Radio Millimeter", "Green Goat", "Fortune", and others, would overpower the signal on [[Airborne radio relay|relay stations]] for wired radio networks in order to transmit their own programming, or transmit into wired radio networks during gaps in normal programming.&lt;ref name="csm01"/&gt; Even though the incidents appear to have been fairly common according to reports from the [[BBC]],&lt;ref name="csm01"/&gt; most were not publicly acknowledged for policy reasons. Reports in newspapers typically referred to the hijackers as "radio hooligans broadcasting drivel, rudeness, vulgarity, uncensored expressions, and trashy music".&lt;ref name="csm01"/&gt; State news organizations also attempted smear campaigns against such pirate broadcasters, claiming that they had interfered with a state frequency used by [[Aeroflot]], "preventing a doctor in an air ambulance from transmitting information about a patient".&lt;ref name="csm01"/&gt;

=== 2006 Lebanon War ===

During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Israel overloaded the satellite transmission of [[Hezbollah]]'s [[Al Manar TV]] to broadcast anti-Hezbollah [[propaganda]]. One spot showed Hezbollah leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]] with crosshairs superimposed on his image followed by three gunshots and a voice saying "Your day is coming" and shots of the [[Israeli Air Force]] destroying targets in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="psywar"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "The Winker's Song" incident ===
In June and July 2017, [[Mansfield 103.2 FM]], a local radio station in the UK, had its signal intruded at least eight times during outside broadcasts. During these intrusions, "[[The Winker's Song (Misprint)]]" was played. The perpetrator has not been identified.&lt;ref name="bbcwinker"&gt;{{cite web

== Other incidents ==

=== Television signal intrusions ===
On an unknown date in 1989, an advert on [[TVQ|TVQ-10]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Australia]] was interrupted with interference from radio station [[4MMM|FM104]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://m.youtube.com/watch?list=PLk4dmv7qHN1c3h-SkWeUJ5xGsoBCCFtME&amp;v=tmsPxGaG2Sc&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 3, 2007 in Australia, during a broadcast of an episode of the [[Canadians|Canadian]] television series ''[[Mayday (Canadian TV series)|Mayday]]'' (known in Australia as ''Air Crash Investigation'') on the [[Seven Network]], an audio signal unexpectedly started playing, clearly saying in an American accent, "Jesus Christ, help us all, Lord." This same voice message continued to repeat itself over and over during the show for a total of six minutes. A spokesman for Seven later denied that the transmission was a prank or a security breach and claimed that the repeated line was actually part of the original broadcast and said, "Jesus Christ, one of the Nazarenes", although there is hardly any similarity between the two phrases. Subsequent investigation by independent researchers revealed that the invading transmission was actually from a videotaped news broadcast of a civilian truck being ambushed in Iraq. It remains unknown whether or not this was an intentional act of television piracy or a genuine glitch of some sort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/mystery-video-audio-dynamite/news-story/50690012f5a66b7369e069d7fc15dfca|title=Mystery video audio dynamite|date=4 January 2007|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://danwarne.com/was-channel-7-hacked-by-jesus/ Was Channel 7 hacked by Jesus?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206101308/http://danwarne.com/was-channel-7-hacked-by-jesus/ |date=February 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 17, 2007, an intrusion incident occurred on [[Czech Television]]'s Sunday morning programme ''Panorama'', which shows panoramic shots of [[Prague]] and various locations across the [[Czech Republic|country]], especially mountain resorts. One of the cameras, located in [[Černý Důl]] in [[Krkonoše]], had been tampered with on-site and its video stream was replaced with the hackers' own, which contained [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] of a small nuclear explosion in the local landscape, ending in [[white noise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzaN2x8qXcM|title=Czech nuclear bomb prank hoax|first=|last=Don82CZ|date=17 June 2007|publisher=|accessdate=27 December 2016|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The broadcast looked authentic enough; the only clue for the viewers was the [[URL|Web address]] of the artist group [[Ztohoven]], which had already performed several [[reality hacking]] incidents before. Czech Television considered legal action against the group, and tourism workers in the area expressed outrage (since the programme serves to promote tourism in the areas shown).&lt;ref name="Panorama"&gt;{{cite web

On July 13, 2007, a grainy photo of a man and woman interrupted [[Washington, D.C.]] [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WJLA]]'s digital or [[High-definition television|HD]] signal. The picture was not transmitted over the analog signal, however. The incident was deemed a genuine signal intrusion by various websites but has since been confirmed to be the result of an older [[HDTV]] [[encoder]] malfunctioning in the early morning hours and going undetected. Station management stated that the image was from an advertisement for ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''.&lt;ref name="WJLA"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3638">{{Politics of the Republic of the Congo}}
The '''Constitution of the Republic of the Congo''' is the basic law governing the [[Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adiac-congo.com/sites/default/files/JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION.pdf|title=Constitution of the Republic of the Congo|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, it is stated that the Republic of the Congo is a pluralistic, multi-party democracy. A [[presidential system]] since 2009, the president’s term was originally 7 years, which has now been reduced to five after a [[Republic of the Congo constitutional referendum, 2015|2015 constitutional referendum]] that instituted a new Constitution, which also reinstated the position of [[List of heads of government of the Republic of the Congo|Prime Minister]] and moved the country to a [[semi-presidential system]]. The Council of Ministers – the government – is appointed by the [[List of heads of state of the Republic of the Congo|President]].

The country’s parliament is [[Bicameralism|bicameral]], made up of a [[National Assembly of the Republic of Congo|National Assembly]] and a [[Senate (Republic of the Congo)|Senate]].

The chief court is the Supreme Court. In addition, Congo has a Constitutional Court which rules on constitutional matters.

Congo is divided into 12 ''[[Departments of the Republic of the Congo|départements]]'' (counties or regions), each of which has its own local council.

The old and new constitutions both reference several important texts with reference to basic human rights:
* The [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]]
* The [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]
* The African Charter on Human and People’s Rights
* The 1991 Congolese Charter of National Unity and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms
Congo is a [[Decentralization|decentralised]], [[Secularism|secular]] and [[Democracy|democratic]] republic.

== The 2015 referendum ==
A constitutional referendum was held on 25 October 2015 on a proposal to change the constitution. The new constitution included the following changes:
* Abolishing the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]].
* Extending the right to run for president to three terms, while simultaneously reducing the presidential term from seven to five years.
* Eliminating the maximum age limit of 70 years for the presidency, and reducing the minimum age from 40 to 30 years.
* Reinstating the position of Prime Minister, abolished in 2009.
* Reforming the Constitutional Court. Previously entirely nominated by the president, its nine members are now nominated by the chairs of the National Assembly and Senate, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and the President, for four-year terms renewable twice.
* Creates a number of consultative bodies (these are in addition to existing bodies including the Economic, Social and Environmental Council; the Mediator of the Republic; the National Committee for Human Rights; and the Superior Council for Freedom of Communication). They are able to call government officials to testify on issues relevant to their purview:
*# The National Council for Dialogue
*# The Consultative Council for Women
*# The Consultative Council for People Living with Handicaps
*# The Consultative Council for Youth
*# The Consultative Council for Traditions and Religions
*# The Consultative Council for NGOs and Civil Society
* Giving greater powers to local authorities and affirming that Congo is a “decentralised state”.

The '''FATACIL''' ({{lang-pt|'''Feira de Artesanato, Turismo, Agricultura, Comércio e Indústria de Lagoa'''}}), the ''Craft, Tourism, Agricultural, Commercial and Industrial Fair of Lagoa'', occurs annually (since 1980) for 10 days in August in the ''Parque de Feiras e Exposições'' (''Fair and Exhibition Grounds'') in [[Algarve|Algarvan]] city of [[Lagoa (Algarve)]].

The fair is attended each year by thousands of visitors from all parts of the country (the last few years the attendance has been about 180,000), not only because of their interest in promoting traditional arts and crafts which are on the edge of extinction, but also for the shows which occur daily.

Recently there have been about 800 exhibitors of various products including the arts and crafts of Portugal generally, and of the Algarve in particular: articles made of everything from [[textile]]s to [[copper]] and [[forge]]d [[iron]]; [[lace]]work; artifacts made of [[wood]]; [[pottery]] and [[ceramic art|ceramics]]; [[cork (material)|cork]] items; [[basket]] work; or the typical Algarve [[puppet]]s of [[Martim Longo]] and [[Querença]].

'''Danny&lt;!-- DO NOT change this to Daniel. His name is Danny, and it's NOT short for Daniel, as he has made clear several times. --&gt; Baker'''&lt;ref&gt;Free BMD Births September 1957 - BAKER, Danny, Mother's Maiden Name: Ward, District: Deptford, Vol 5c, Page 404.&lt;/ref&gt; (born 22 June 1957) is an English [[comedy writer]], [[journalist]], [[radio DJ]] and [[screenwriter]]. Since the late 1970s, he has worked for a wide range of publications and broadcasters including ''[[NME]]'', [[LWT]], the [[BBC]] and [[talksport|Talk Radio]].

== Early life ==
Baker was born in [[Deptford]] in south east London to Fred "Spud" Baker, a [[Stevedore|dockworker]], and Betty, a factory worker. He grew up in [[Bermondsey]]. He attended [[Rotherhithe]] Primary School and then instead of taking up a [[grammar school]] place he went to the nearby West Greenwich Secondary Boys School, Deptford.&lt;ref name=Autobiography&gt;{{cite book|date=6 November 2012|first=Danny |last=Baker|isbn=978-0297863403|title= Going to Sea in a Sieve: The Autobiography |publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left the school in April 1972 at the age of 14 and initially worked in One Stop Records, a small but fashionable record shop in South Molton Street in the [[West End of London]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/radio4/did/did_20110731-1200a.mp3 |title=Podcast of Baker being interviewed for the BBC radio series Desert Island Discs |work=BBC Radio 4 |accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest of three children, he has an older sister, Sharon, and had an older brother, Michael, who died aged 29 when Danny was 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/a-few-quiet-words-with-danny-baker-boy-1274806.html|title=A few quiet words with Danny Baker boy|date=1997-03-24|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Print journalism===
In 1977, Baker started writing for the punk fanzine ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'' which was founded by his old schoolfriend [[Mark Perry (musician)|Mark Perry]] which in turn led to an offer from the ''[[New Musical Express]]'', then edited by [[Nick Logan]]. Baker began working as the office receptionist, but was soon contributing regular articles and reviews before progressing to interviews. He often refers to these times during his [[Radio programming|radio shows]], regularly citing examples of the ridiculous behaviour exhibited by his rock star interviewees.

In the later 1990s, Baker wrote a weekly sports column for ''[[The Times]]'' and was briefly a columnist for early issues of film magazine ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]''.

===Television===
====Reporting for LWT (1980s)====
Baker started his TV career in 1980 at [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT), as the presenter of ''Twentieth Century Box'' - a series of regional documentaries on elements of [[youth culture]] in London, produced by [[Janet Street Porter]]. One edition in the first series documented the burgeoning [[new wave of British heavy metal]] ([[NWOBHM]]) scene, including an early TV appearance of [[Iron Maiden]] performing at [[The Marquee Club]] and interviews with "[[air guitar]]ists". Other editions also featured early appearances from the likes of [[Spandau Ballet]] and [[Depeche Mode]].

Baker's first mainstream break was as [[wikt:itinerant|roving]] [[reporter]]-[[Television presenter|presenter]] on the [[Michael Aspel]] [[LWT]] regional magazine ''[[The Six O'Clock Show]]'' alongside former ''[[Mastermind (TV series)|Mastermind]]'' winner and former London [[Hackney carriage|black cab]] driver [[Fred Housego]]. [[Paul Ross]] (brother of Jonathan Ross whom Baker had as his [[best man]]) was his researcher. During his stint on ''[[The Six O'Clock Show]]'', Baker was filmed having an altercation with a British Rail press officer. This clip is often resurrected for [[clip show]]s and can be seen on YouTube.

====Writing and presenting (early–late 1990s)====
Baker appeared regularly on LWT's regional output during the 1980s and early 1990s - working on such programmes as ''Six O'Clock Live'', ''Danny Baker's Londoners'', and in 1991, ''The Game'' - a six-part series which featured coverage of teams involved in the fourth division of the East London [[Sunday league football|Sunday Football League]]. The series was later released on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shortlist.com/entertainment/sport/danny-baker-the-game-football-tv&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker began writing for television programmes in 1992 after being asked to prepare a piece for one of the first [[archive clip show]]s: ''[[TV Hell]]'', which was a collection of the worst TV programmes ever. Since then he has presented television shows such as ''[[Win, Lose, or Draw]]'', ''[[Pets Win Prizes]]'' and ''TV Heroes'', which was a series of 10-minute homages to some of Baker's entertainment idols including [[Fanny Cradock]], [[Peter Glaze]] (from ''[[Crackerjack (TV series)|Crackerjack]]'') and the ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' audience. In one episode of ''TV Heroes'', a clip was shown of Baker leaping around to a performance of "Ooh What A Life" by the [[Gibson Brothers]] in 1979, which was captioned as "Danny Baker's first TV appearance". During an edition of his own later series "TV Heroes" featuring the audiences from Top Of The Pops, Baker described himself as "looking like he was trying to put out a small fire".

Baker also began a BBC Saturday night [[Talk show|chat show]], called ''Danny Baker After All'' which borrowed its style from ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', but his style and guests ([[Rick Wakeman]] of prog rock band [[Yes (band)|Yes]] was a regular) did not attract the mainstream audience the slot demanded. Film critic [[Mark Kermode]]'s band The Railtown Bottlers was the show's house band.&lt;ref name="railtown"&gt;{{cite news |title=My 20-year love affair with the joy of skiffle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/01/popandrock2|accessdate=20 February 2011 | location=London |newspaper=The Guardian|first=Mark|last=Kermode|date=1 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later he fronted television adverts for [[Daz (detergent)|Daz washing powder]] and [[Mars bar]] confectionery. Baker parodied his Daz ads by appearing as himself on the sitcom ''[[Me, You and Him]]''.

During this period, Baker began presenting on [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]]'s ''[[606 (radio show)|606]]'' football-related phone-in programme as well as the job of presenting ''Match of the Eighties'', a six-part BBC series of football during the [[1980-81 in English football|1980/81]] and [[1985-86 in English football|1985/86]] seasons.

Baker was a writer on Chris Evans' ''[[TFI Friday]]'' show, as well as contributing material for presenters such as [[Angus Deayton]] and [[Jonathan Ross]].

====Guest appearances (late 1990s–2000s)====
During the late 1990s he made guest appearances on comedy shows including ''[[Have I Got News for You]]'', ''[[Shooting Stars (TV series)|Shooting Stars]]'' and ''[[Room 101 (TV series)|Room 101]]''. During this period he appeared in the press as a result of nights out with friends [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] and England footballer [[Paul Gascoigne]]. Gascoigne was under media scrutiny for drinking and socialising while preparing for tournaments. After Gascoigne was left out of the [[1998 World Cup]] squad, Baker went on ''Have I Got News For You'' to defend his friend and criticise the omission.

He also appeared on ''[[The Terry and Gaby Show]]'' from 2003 to 2004 (where he burnt his hand trying to perform a trick with a microwave and a piece of soap) and has appeared on [[BBC Two]] quiz show ''[[QI]]'', becoming the show's first ever winner. Baker worked again with Charles Shaar Murray on the [[Ramones]] documentary ''End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones'', providing an audio commentary.

More recent TV projects include ''[[The Sitcom Showdown]]'' which began on [[Gold (UK TV channel)|UKTV Gold]] in April 2006, a 2014 show featuring archived television footage for BBC4 named ''Brushing Up On...'' and a music discussion show for BBC4 named ''Danny Baker's Rockin' Decades''. He also did ''[[Comic Relief Does The Apprentice]]'' in 2007 for [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]. He also starred in ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', as the narrator, at the [[Churchill Theatre]] in [[Bromley]] and the [[New Wimbledon Theatre]].

Baker was announced as part of [[BT Sport]]'s football coverage in 2013, hosting a Friday evening show with [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]].&lt;ref name="BT Sport"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jun/03/bt-sport-danny-baker-danny-kelly-premier-league|title=BT Sport to reunite Danny Baker and Danny Kelly for football show|newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 June 2013|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] hired Baker to work as a writer on the 2016 series of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/81033-chris-evans-hires-top-gear-comedy-writer/|title=Chris Evans hires Top Gear comedy writer|work=[[The List (magazine)|The List]]|date=28 May 2016|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, he entered as a latecomer in [[reality television]] show, ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here]]'', along with [[Martin Roberts (presenter)|Martin Roberts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/imacelebrity/highlights/welcome-to-danny-martin |title=Danny &amp; Martin arrive in Camp |work=ITV.com |date=17 November 2016 |accessdate=1 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker was the first person to be voted off in the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Agius|first1=Nicola|title=First I'm A Celebrity elimination results revealed|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/danny-baker-eliminated-im-celebrity-9337687 |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |accessdate=25 November 2016|date=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio career===
====BBC GLR/5 Live/Radio 1 (1989{{ndash}}1997)====
Baker began his radio career on [[BBC GLR]] in 1989, presenting ''Weekend Breakfast'' from 6{{nbsp}} to 9{{nbsp}}am on Saturdays and Sundays. The show was produced by [[Chris Evans (British broadcaster)|Chris Evans]], who became a good friend to Baker. With GLR eventually opting for a more orthodox breakfast show at weekends, Baker moved to the 10{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm slot on Sundays.

In 1990, Baker joined the newly launched [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]], presenting ''Sportscall'', a phone-in sports quiz broadcast every Saturday lunchtime.

From October 1991 to October 1992 he presented ''[[606 (radio show)|606]]'' and, from February 1992 until October 1993, he presented ''Morning Edition'' from 6:30 to 9:30{{nbsp}}am every weekday morning. The show blended Baker's love of unusual trivia with 'grown-up' music. This was where Baker first teamed up with [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]] and Allis Moss. [[Mark Kermode]] added weekly film reviews, and would later appear with his band 'The Railtown Bottlers' every week on the first series of Baker's TV show.&lt;ref name="railtown" /&gt;

Baker joined [[BBC Radio 1]] in October 1993, taking over the weekend mid-morning show from 10{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm from [[Dave Lee Travis]] who had resigned on air following the sackings instigated by [[Matthew Bannister]] and [[Trevor Dann]] during the early 1990s. However, due to poor ratings, from November 1994 he was heard on Saturdays only from 10{{nbsp}}am to 12 noon. [[Simon Mayo]] took over Sunday mornings.

Baker's style led to a fall in listeners at Radio 1 but despite his tendering his resignation on at least two occasions, management added extensions to his contract. From October 1995, his Saturday show went out from 12:30 to 2:30{{nbsp}}pm. He left the station in September 1996. His co-hosts during this period included BBC continuity announcer Allis Moss, Dr. H, Laurie Sore, Andy Darling and [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]].

While continuing with his Saturday morning show on [[BBC Radio 1]], in 1996 Baker joined [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] to present a Sunday lunchtime show with [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]], ''Baker &amp; Kelly Upfront''.

On leaving [[BBC Radio 1]], Baker returned to [[BBC GLR]] to present a three-hour Sunday show from 10{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm. 'Baker and Kelly Upfront' also returned, now at Saturday lunchtime, while Baker also took on a new show, 'The Baker Line', a Wednesday evening version of the ''[[606 (radio show)|606]]'' phone-in show.

While 'Baker and Kelly Upfront' was light-hearted, 'The Baker Line' was darker and emotionally charged. Baker was at his most outspoken, and in early 1997, he was sacked from [[BBC Radio 5 Live|5 Live]] when station bosses alleged that he had incited threatening behaviour during an angry outburst about a referee.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/danny-baker-theres-this-idea-that-i-talk-too-much-657252.html |title=Arts: Danny Baker - 'There's this idea that I talk too much' |newspaper=The Independent |date=13 April 2002 |accessdate=29 August 2011 |location=London |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123065233/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/danny-baker-theres-this-idea-that-i-talk-too-much-657252.html |archivedate=23 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Talk Radio/Virgin Radio (1998{{ndash}}2000)====
Baker joined [[TalkSPORT|Talk Radio]] to present a similar football phone-in with Kelly each Saturday from 5:30 to 7:30{{nbsp}}pm. A pre-match show was added from 11:30{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm. After moving to the Saturday breakfast slot (8{{nbsp}}am to 12 noon), he engineered his own dismissal after a matter of weeks by refusing to centre the show on football, preferring to intersperse chat with his own music selections.

After leaving [[talkSPORT|Talk Radio]], he joined [[Virgin Radio (UK)|Virgin Radio]] in early 1999, taking over from [[Jonathan Ross (television presenter)|Jonathan Ross]] on Sundays from 10{{nbsp}}am to 1{{nbsp}}pm.

Not long after, Baker was approached by the [[BBC]] and was asked whether he wanted to present a Saturday morning show on [[BBC Radio 2]]. Baker turned down the offer by saying "the time wasn't right", and the show was given to Ross. Baker also deputised on Virgin's Saturday lunchtime football show from 12 noon to 2{{nbsp}}pm for a handful of shows, alongside [[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Danny Kelly]] until he left the station in 2000.

====BBC London 94.9 (2001{{ndash}}2002 and 2005{{ndash}}2012)====
In September 2001, Baker joined [[BBC London 94.9]] presenting a Saturday morning show from 8 to 11{{nbsp}}am. Just 6 months later, in March 2002, and with a new co-presenting team which included [[Amy Lamé]], Mark O'Donnell and [[David Kuo (financial adviser)|David Kuo]], he took over the breakfast show from 6 to 9{{nbsp}}am, with a new theme tune in the form of the [[Anthony Newley]] song ''[[The Candy Man]]''.

Although not drawing a large listenership, Baker won "[[Sony Radio Academy Awards|Sony Radio DJ of the year]]" for the show. However, the day after winning the award, he announced his intention to leave the show at the end of the month. The last show was on Friday 27 May 2005. On Monday 17 October 2005, after a sabbatical at home, Baker rejoined [[BBC London 94.9]] where he took over the weekday 3 to 5{{nbsp}}pm show from [[Jono Coleman]], who had moved to co-present the breakfast show with former actress [[JoAnne Good]].

His BBC London 94.9 shows tended to feature off-the-wall phone-ins and discussions with his on-air team, [[Amy Lamé|Amy]] and Baylen Leonard, often regarding music and entertainment nostalgia of the 1960s and 1970s. His interviews focused on off-beat trivia rather than the guests' latest or most famous work, and shows would be interspersed with relatively obscure rock tracks from bands such as [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Steely Dan]], [[Frank Zappa]] and [[Captain Beefheart]].

The programme was axed in November 2012 as part of a programme of cuts at the station. Although due to continue its run until the end of the year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Plunkett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/01/danny-baker-bbc-show-axed |title=Danny Baker's afternoon show on BBC London to be axed in December |newspaper=The Guardian |date=1 November 2012|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker announced on air on the day of the announcement that that day's show would be his last, branding his BBC London employers as "pinheaded weasels" for the way in which they cancelled the programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Plunkett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/01/axed-danny-baker-bbc-rant |title=Axed Danny Baker delivers on-air rant at his BBC London bosses |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 1 November 2012 |accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====All Day Breakfast Show/podcasts (2007)====
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2013}}
On 15 March 2007 until September the same year, Baker hosted the ''[[All Day Breakfast Show]]'', a [[podcast]] to reach listeners beyond BBC London's FM radio reach.

Since (July 2016) Louise Pepper has been his co-host in the studio. A popular feature of the Saturday Morning Programme is the Sausage Sandwich Game. A celebrity guest is asked two questions about their personal life that only they can answer. Two contestants representing local or national football teams, score 'goals' based on their ability to correctly guess the celebrity's answer. In the final question which gives the game its name, the contestants have to guess if the celebrity when offered a sausage sandwich would choose red sauce, brown sauce or no sauce at all.
The second hour of the programme features a (different) celebrity interview followed by phone-in led banter.

'''''Die Burger''''' (English: The Citizen) is a daily [[Afrikaans]]-language [[newspaper]], published by [[Naspers]]. By 2008, it had a circulation of 91,665 in the [[Western Cape Province|Western]] and [[Eastern Cape Province]]s of [[South Africa]]. Along with ''[[Beeld]]'' and ''[[Volksblad]]'', it is one of three [[broadsheet]] dailies in the [[Media24]] stable.

== History ==
On 18 December 1914, sixteen prominent Afrikaners gathered in [[Stellenbosch]] to discuss the establishment of a national newspaper.&lt;ref name="Pretorius"&gt;{{cite book | title=A History of South Africa: From the Distant Past to the Present Day | publisher=Protea Book House | author=Pretorius, Fransjohan | year=2014 | location=Hatsfield, Pretoria | isbn=978-1-86919-908-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|290}}  With considerable financial support from local philanthropists [[Jannie Marais|Jannie]] and Christiaan Marais, purchased a quarter of 20,000 ₤1 shares in the new holding company, the project soon got off the ground, with the founding of ''De Nasionale Pers'' ("the National Press") and the selection of Dr. [[D. F. Malan]] as editor of its daily paper, ''De Burger'' (Dutch for "The Citizen").&lt;ref name=Pretorius/&gt;{{rp|290}} The first issue was published on 26 July 1915.

== Language ==
[[File:Media24-sentrum nuwe vooraansig 2015.jpg|thumb|''Die Burger'' is published at the Media24 Centre on Cape Town's Foreshore]]
[[File:ASC Leiden - Library - South African newspaper stack of Die Burger - 2012.jpg|thumb|Library stack of ''Die Burger'', 2012.]]
''Die Burger'' was originally published in Dutch. In 1916, the first Afrikaans-language articles were published. In 1921, the newspaper's Dutch title (''De Burger'') was translated into Afrikaans (''Die Burger'').

== Political affiliation ==

''Die Burger'' was a newspaper that supported the nationalist cause and [[apartheid]], and used to be the mouthpiece of the [[National Party of South Africa]]. This only began to change after 1985, when then editor [[Piet Cillié]], a staunch supporter of the government under [[B. J. Vorster]] and [[P. W. Botha]], retired. In 1990, the National Party was officially informed by editor [[Ebbe Dommisse]] that it no longer served as a political mouthpiece. This disaffiliation was continued in 1999 with the appointment of a more progressive editor, [[Arrie Rossouw]]. In 2006, [[Henry Jeffreys]] became the first [[cape coloured]] editor of the paper.

== List of editors ==
* D. F. Malan (1915-24)

'''Entente of Independents of Côte d'Ivoire''' (in [[French language|French]]: ''Entente des Indépendents de Côte d'Ivoire''), a splinter group of the [[Democratic Party of Côte d'Ivoire]] (PDCI). EDICI was founded in [[Abidjan]] in the end of 1949. It was led by Vamé Doumouya and Touré Amidou. In the beginning of 1950 the [[Union of Independents of Côte d'Ivoire]] (UICI) merged into EDICI.

EDICI was fiercely pro-[[France]] and [[anticommunist]].

In 1951 EDICI merged with the [[Progressive Party of Côte d'Ivoire]] (PPCI) to form the [[Party of the French Union in Côte d'Ivoire]] (PUFCI).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3154">The '''Great Famine of 1695–97''', or simply the '''Great Famine''', was a catastrophic [[famine]] that affected present [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]: at the time, all of these areas belonged to the [[Swedish Empire]] with the exception of Norway, which was a Danish province. The areas which were worst affected were the Swedish province of Finland and [[Norrland]] in Sweden proper.

==Estonia==
{{Main|Great Famine of Estonia (1695–1697)}}
{{Empty section|date=May 2017}}

==Finland==
In the Swedish province of Finland, the Great Famine of 1695–97 was also referred to as "The Years of Many Deaths" by some Finnish historians, because it killed about a third of the [[Finnish people|Finnish population]] in only two years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Neumann |first1=J. |last2=Lindgrén |first2=S. |year=1979 |title=Great Historical Events That Were Significantly Affected by the Weather: 4, The Great Famines in Finland and Estonia, 1695–97 |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |publisher= |volume= 60 |issue= 7 |pages=775–787 |url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0477%281979%29060%3C0775%3AGHETWS%3E2.0.CO%3B2 |doi= 10.1175/1520-0477(1979)060&lt;0775:GHETWS&gt;2.0.CO;2 |issn=1520-0477}}&lt;/ref&gt; or about 150,000.&lt;ref name="Topelius1899"&gt;Topelius, Zacharias (1899). ”Stora hungersnöden”. Fältskärns berättelser. Stockholm: Albert Bonniers förlag. P. 388-399&lt;/ref&gt; It was Finland's worst demographic catastrophe.

==Sweden==
From 1688 onward, Sweden had been affected by early [[frost]] and bad harvests. This culminated in the winter of 1695, which was described as the coldest since 1658 and the [[rye]] did not flower before July. Because of this, the Great Famine of 1695 is also referred to as ''Det stora svartåret'' ("The Great Black Year").&lt;ref name="Topelius1899"/&gt; The harvest of 1696, furthermore, was reportedly so bad that each farm produced only one loaf of [[rye]] bread.
  
Outside of Finland, the northernmost provinces of Sweden were the most severely affected. Desperate famine victims from the countryside left for the cities in search for food, especially to the capital of Stockholm, where in the spring of 1697 the streets were reportedly strewn with corpses and people dying of starvation.&lt;ref name="Topelius1899"/&gt;

[[Israel Kolmodin]] wrote the psalm ''[[Den blomstertid nu kommer]]'' in 1695 in connection to the famine, intended as a prayer to God that the next summer would bring food.&lt;ref name="Topelius1899"/&gt;

In December 2009, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted resolution 64/134&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/64/resolutions.shtml|title=General Assembly of the United Nations|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; proclaiming the year commencing 12 August 2010 as the '''International Year of Youth'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://social.un.org/youthyear&lt;/ref&gt; 

The resolution calls upon [[government]]s, [[civil society]], individuals and communities worldwide to support activities at local and international levels to mark the event. Youth organizations, governments, and civil society are encouraged to organize activities that promote an increased understanding of the importance and benefits of youth participation in all aspects of society, as well as those that support youth to devote their energy, enthusiasm and creativity to development and the promotion of mutual understanding.  It encourages [[young people]] to dedicate themselves to fostering progress, including the attainment of the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals&lt;/ref&gt; which seek to slash a host of social inadequacies, ranging from extreme [[poverty]] and hunger to maternal and infant mortality to lack of access to [[education]] and [[health care]], all by 2015.

==Theme: Dialogue and Mutual Understanding==
Under the theme "Dialogue and Mutual Understanding", the resolution aims to encourage dialogue and understanding across generations and promote the ideals of [[peace]], respect for [[human rights]] and freedoms, and solidarity.

==Global level==
===United Nations Member States===
In its resolution 64/134, the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] decided “to organize under the auspices of the [[United Nations]] a world youth conference as the highlight of the Year” and invited “the President of the General Assembly to conduct open-ended information consultations with Member States with a view of determining the modalities of the conference, which is to be funded by voluntary contributions.”

In April 2010, H.E. Mr Jean-Francis Régis Zinsou, the Permanent Representative of the [[Republic of Benin]], agreed to serve as Facilitator for the consultations on the organization of the conference to be held in 2011. Consultations of the General Assembly began in May 2010.

===United Nations System===
In addition to the UN conference on youth, the UN is coordinating its efforts to celebrate and promote International Year of Youth.  The United Nations Inter-Agency Network on Youth Development is coordinating the activities of the UN system for the International Year of Youth, with the UN Programme on Youth leading this effort. The United Nations Inter-Agency Network on Youth Development works to increase the effectiveness of UN work in youth development by strengthening collaboration and exchange among all UN entities working on youth.

Members of the Network adopted the UN Framework Approach for the International Year of Youth&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://social.un.org/youthyear/unapproach.shtml|title=United Nations Framework Approach - International Year of Youth (IYY) August 2010-2011|website=social.un.org|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in February, 2010, to provide a concrete framework for collective efforts and to set the strategic objectives for the Year. The Framework identifies three key objectives and provides specific actions essential to implement the objectives, which are:

'''1. Create Awareness: increase commitment and investment in youth'''
* Increase recognition of youth development as a smart investment by the [[public sector|public]] and [[private sector]]s;
* Advocate for the recognition of young people’s contributions to national and [[community development]] and to achieving the Millennium Development Goals;
* Promote understanding of inequalities amongst youth and how to effectively address the needs of the most disadvantaged;
* Foster research and knowledge building on youth to better inform youth policies and programmes.

'''2. Mobilize and Engage: increase youth participation and partnerships'''
* Institutionalize mechanisms for youth participation in decision-making processes;
* Support youth-led organizations and initiatives to enhance their contribution to society;
* Strengthen networks and partnerships among Governments, youth-led organizations, [[academia]], civil society organizations, the private sector, the media and the UN system, to enhance commitment and support for holistic youth development.

'''3. Connect and Build Bridges: increase intercultural understanding among youth
* Promote youth interactions, networks and partnerships across cultures;
* Empower and support youth as agents of [[social inclusion]] and peace.

The progress achieved during the Year will lay the foundation for further work in youth development, including the implementation of the World Programme of Action for Youth and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The Framework has been disseminated to the UN system, including to Regional Commissions and Country Teams.  Organizations celebrating the Year are invited to use the Framework to guide their activities.

===History of Youth at the United Nations===
In 1965, United Nations Members States first acknowledged that the contribution of young people – defined by the United Nations as those between the ages of 15 and 24 years – is essential for the development of society when they endorsed the "Declaration on the Promotion among Youth of the Ideals of Peace, Mutual Respect and Understanding between Peoples"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/a20r2037.htm|title=A/RES/20/2037 - Declaration on the Promotion Among Youth of the Ideals of Peace, Mutual Respect and Understanding Between Peoples - UN Documents Cooperation Circles|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;'''.''' 

Twenty years later, the General Assembly observed the year 1985 as the "first [[International Youth Year]]: Participation, Development and Peace".  In 1995, Member States strengthened their commitment to young people by adopting the "World Programme of Action for Youth (WPAY)", which provides a policy framework and practical guidelines for national action and international support to improve the situation of young people by increasing their access to opportunities for constructive participation in society.  

In 2007, the General Assembly expanded upon the WPAY by adopting additional issue areas, bringing the total to fifteen areas of priority focus which are: education, [[employment]], hunger and poverty, health, [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], [[drug abuse]], juvenile delinquency, leisure-time activities, girls and young women, participation, [[globalization]], information and communications technologies, [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], youth and [[conflict (process)|conflict]], and inter-generational relations.

==National level==
International Years are customarily celebrated at the national level and steered by National Committees, usually consisting of government entities such as Ministry of Youth or [[Ministry of Education]], National Youth Councils, civil society organizations, representatives of the UN system and other relevant stakeholders.

'''Kilishi''' is a version of [[jerky]] that originated in [[Hausaland]]. It is a dried form of [[suya]], made from deboned cow, sheep or goat meat. Each of the selected muscles is sliced into sheets of one metre or less for easy drying. The dried sheets of meat are then collected and kept for the next process.

A paste made from peanuts, called '''labu''', is diluted with enough water, spices, salt, ground onions, and sometimes sweeteners such as honey, to add sweetness. A more natural way to add sweetness is by adding date palm.  The dried "sheets" of meat are then immersed one by one in the labu paste to coat them, before being left to dry for hours before roasting on a wire mesh.

Kilishi can be kept for months without much change to its taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Special report: Kilishi, Nigeria’s meat of possibilities (video documentary) - Nigeria Today|url=http://www.nigeriatoday.ng/2016/04/special-report-kilishi-nigerias-meat-of-possibilities-video-documentary/|date=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nigeria: Kano - Kilishi is Everything to the People|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201510280627.html|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Iceland}}
The '''Kingdom of Iceland''' ({{lang-is|Konungsríkið Ísland}}; {{lang-da|Kongeriget Island}}) was a [[constitutional monarchy]], a sovereign and independent country that was established by the [[Danish–Icelandic Act of Union|Act of Union]] with [[Denmark]] signed on 1 December 1918.&lt;ref name=Halfdanarson&gt;{{cite book|last=Halfdanarson|first=Gudmundur Halfdanarson|title=The A to Z of Iceland|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=0810872080|pages=23–25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kDrZWBMGJ8wC&amp;pg=PR23&amp;dq=Monarchy+of+Iceland+1918#v=onepage&amp;q=Monarchy%20of%20Iceland%201918&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lasted until 17 June 1944 when a [[Icelandic constitutional referendum, 1944|national referendum established the Republic of Iceland]] in its place.&lt;ref name="Van Cleaf"&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Cleaf|first=Kristin Van Cleaf|title=Iceland|year=2007|publisher=ABDO|isbn=1599287846|pages=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zbhQoMd2jhcC&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=Monarchy+of+Iceland+1918#v=onepage&amp;q=Monarchy%20of%20Iceland%201918&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of Danish rule==
{{See also|History of Iceland}}
Because of the [[Kalmar Union]], Iceland had been under the control of the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Crown of Denmark]] since 1380,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nordstrom |first=Byron |year=2000 |title=Scandinavia since 1500 |publisher=[[University of Minnesota]] Press |page=147 |isbn=0-8166-2098-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; although formally it had been a [[List of possessions of Norway|Norwegian possession]] until 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dörr |first=Oliver |title=Kompendium völkerrechtlicher Rechtsprechung |year=2004 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |isbn=3-16-148311-1|language=German |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874, one thousand years after the first [[Settlement of Iceland|acknowledged settlement]], Denmark granted Iceland [[home rule]]. The constitution, written the same year, was revised in 1903 and the extent of Iceland's home rule increased in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://europa.eu/youth/is/article/61/4215_en |title=A short history of Alþingi - the oldest parliament in the world |website=European Youth Portal |publisher=European Union |language=en |access-date=29 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Minister for Iceland|minister for Icelandic affairs]], residing in [[Reykjavík]], was made responsible to the ''[[Althing]]'', the Icelandic parliament.

==Establishment of the kingdom==
{{See also|Danish–Icelandic Act of Union}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00102A, König Christian X. von Dänemark.jpg|mni|thumb|[[Christian X of Denmark]]]]

On 1 December 1918, the [[Danish–Icelandic Act of Union|Act of Union]], an agreement with Denmark, recognized Iceland as a fully [[sovereign state]], an independent country in [[personal union]] with Denmark through a common [[Monarchy of Iceland|monarch]]. The Kingdom of Iceland established its [[Flag of Iceland|own flag]] and [[Coat of arms of Iceland|coat of arms]] and asked that Denmark represent its foreign affairs and defence interests on its behalf while retaining full control over its foreign affairs and defence. Iceland opened its first Embassy in 1920. The Act would be reviewed in 1940 and could be revoked three years later if agreement to continue it could not be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of Iceland |first=Gunnar |last=Karlsson |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=9780816635894 |pages=283–284 |date=15 April 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II, British occupation and the establishment of the republic==
{{Main article|Iceland during World War II|Invasion of Iceland|Occupation of Iceland|Ástandið|Founding of the Republic of Iceland}}
The German [[Denmark in World War II|occupation of Denmark]] on 9 April 1940 severed communications between Iceland and Denmark.&lt;ref name="Halfdanarson"/&gt; As a result, on 10 April, the Althing passed two [[Resolution (law)|resolution]]s investing the Icelandic cabinet with the power of [[head of state]] and declaring that Iceland would accept full responsibility for both [[foreign policy]] and coastal surveillance. A year later, on 15 May 1941 the Althing adopted a law creating the position of [[regent]] for [[Sveinn Björnsson]] in order to represent the monarchy.&lt;ref name="Halfdanarson"/&gt; During the first year of [[World War II]], Iceland strictly enforced a position of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] and took action against both [[British Armed Forces|British]] and [[Wehrmacht|German forces]] that violated it. On 10 May 1940, [[Invasion of Iceland|Operation ''Fork'']] was launched by the United Kingdom when military forces sailed into Reykjavík harbour and began an invasion of Iceland.&lt;ref name="Halfdanarson"/&gt; The government of Iceland issued a protest against what it called a "flagrant violation" of Icelandic neutrality. On the day of the invasion, Prime Minister [[Hermann Jónasson]] read a radio announcement instructing Icelanders to treat the British troops as guests. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] occupation of Iceland lasted until 1941 when the Government of Iceland asked the United States to take over its defence. The defence of Iceland was the United States' first participation in World War II.

At its peak, Britain had approximately 25,000 troops stationed in Iceland, all but eliminating unemployment in Reykjavík and other strategically important places. In July 1941, the ''Althingi'' adopted the American–Icelandic defence agreement, passing responsibility for Iceland's defence to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Halfdanarson"/&gt; As many as 40,000 American soldiers were then stationed on the island, outnumbering the native population of adult men. (Iceland's total native population during the war was approximately 120,000.)

Following a [[Icelandic constitutional referendum, 1944|constitutional referendum in May 1944]], Iceland formally became a [[Founding of the Republic of Iceland|republic]] on 17 June 1944. Many Danes felt offended at its timing, as Denmark was still occupied by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} The king in [[Copenhagen]], [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]], nonetheless sent a message of congratulations to the Icelandic people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hardarson|first1=Solrun B.

'''''Libuše and Přemysl''''' (Czech: '''''Libuše a Přemysl''''') is an outdoor sculpture by [[Josef Václav Myslbek]] made in 1889-1897 for [[Palacký Bridge]].

[[File:P1050578 Louvre Obélisque de Manishtusu détail rwk.JPG|thumb|left|Manishtusu obelisk (detail) - Louvre museum]]
The '''Manishtushu Obelisk''' is a [[diorite]], four-sided [[stele]]. The stele is [[obelisk]]-shaped, as well as it narrows upward to its (damaged) top, in a [[pyramid]]al-form. The obelisk was made by [[Manishtushu]], son of [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon the Great]], of the [[Akkadian Empire]], who ruled circa 2270-2255 BC.

As a spoil of war, the stele was taken to [[Susa]] by the [[Elam]]ite  king [[Shutruk-Nakhunte]] in the 12th century BC.

==Description and purpose==  
The Manishtusu Obelisk is 1.4 m tall, and 0.6 m wide&lt;ref&gt;Manishtusu Obelisk, [[Louvre|Louvre Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; on its four sides. It is made of deep black diorite, and incised in [[Akkadian language]] [[cuneiform]] in horizontal rows on all sides. The cuneiform is written within 1519 boxes, as lined [[register (sculpture)|register]]s. The diorite is from [[Oman]], located to the south, and on [[clay tablet]]s, Manishtusu recorded: ''"From mountains beyond the 'lower sea' ([[Persian Gulf]]), he took black stones; he loaded [them] on boats and docked [them] on the quay at [[Akkad (city)|Akkad]]. He fashioned his statue [and] dedicated [it] to [[Enlil]].''&lt;ref&gt;Manishtusu Obelisk, Louvre&lt;/ref&gt;

The obelisk text is a [[law|legal record]] that records the distribution of four parcels of land, in large estates, and its allotment to his officers, for his control of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]].&lt;ref&gt;Manishtusu Obelisk, Louvre&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mareşal''/''Büyükamiral''' ([[Marshal]]) is the highest rank in the [[Army]] of [[Turkey]], the [[Turkish Armed Forces]]. It is the equivalent of a [[Field Marshal]] in other countries.  

The rank of ''Mareşal''/''Büyükamiral'' can trace its origins to the [[Ottoman Empire]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} and to the military of [[Persia]], where the rank was bestowed upon senior commanders upon order of the ruling [[Sultan]].

The word ''mariscalcus'' in Latin, had parts from the old-German words meaning horse and servant.

The rank of ''Mareşal''/''Büyükamiral'' can only be bestowed by the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|National Assembly]], and only given to a [[General]]/[[Admiral]] who leads an army, navy and/or air force with an extraordinary success in battle gaining a victory over the enemy.&lt;ref name="Turkish Armed Forces Employee Law"/&gt;

The corresponding rank in the Turkish [[Navy]] is known as ''[[Büyükamiral]]''. 

'''Marshals of Turkey''':
Only two persons were bestowed the rank ''Mareşal'' to date: [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] (on 21 September 1921) and [[Chief of staff (military)|chief of staff]] [[Fevzi Çakmak]] (on 31 August 1922), both for their successes in the [[Turkish War of Independence]].

{{Politics of Angola}}

According to the 1992 constitution, the '''Prime Minister of Angola''' was a high government official in [[Angola]], but with limited powers as head of government.

Along with the rest of the Council of Ministers, the Prime Minister was appointed by the [[President of Angola|President]]. The position was originally created when Angola achieved independence from [[Portugal]] on 11 November 1975, but was abolished in 1978 when President [[Agostinho Neto]] consolidated his power. There was no Prime Minister until 1991, when President [[José Eduardo dos Santos]] reinstated the position following a peace agreement with the opposition party. The post was also vacant between 1999 and 2002.

The post was again abolished due to the 2010 [[Constitution of Angola]], which integrates the functions of the prime minister into the office of the president, who is not subjected to the confidence of the parliamentary majority, contrarily to the prime minister.

==Name==
The original name of the island, ''Trindade'', is Portuguese for "[[trinity]]"; ''Trinidad'' is the Spanish [[cognate]]. It is unclear why Harden-Hickley chose to translate the name from Portuguese into Spanish, and not English. Earlier, nearby [[Ascension Island]] had been renamed from its original Portuguese name ''Ascensão'' when it passed into British hands.

== History ==
While traveling to [[Tibet]] before his marriage, Harden-Hickey noticed the tiny island of Trindade in the South Atlantic Ocean, which had never been claimed by any country and was, legally, ''[[terra nullius]]''. In 1893, wanting an independent state where he could serve as its ruler, he claimed the island and proclaimed himself James I, the Prince of Trinidad. 

He designed postage stamps, a national flag and [[coat of arms]], and established a [[chivalric order]], the Cross of Trinidad. He bought a [[schooner]] to transport colonists, appointed M. Le Comte De la Boissiere as Secretary of State, and opened a consular office at 217 West 36th Street in [[New York City]]. He issued [[government bond]]s to finance the construction of infrastructure on the island.

In July 1895, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] tried to take possession of the island, basing their claim on the 1700 visit by English astronomer [[Edmund Halley]].&lt;ref name="oldsmoke" /&gt; The British planned to use the island as a telegraph cable station.&lt;ref name="oldsmoke" /&gt; However, Brazilian diplomatic efforts, along with Portuguese support,{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} pressed a successful claim to Brazilian sovereignty, based on the island's discovery in 1502 by Portuguese navigators.

To demonstrate sovereignty over the island, the state of Espírito Santo, which took the island, built a landmark on January 24, 1897.
===Today===
Today, Brazil marks its presence with a permanent [[Brazilian Navy]] base on the main island.

'''Pulau Reni''' is a small [[Indonesia]]n island located in the [[Ayu Islands|Ayu Archipelago]]  above the northern tip of the [[Waigeo]] Islands.

Pulau Reni is part of the [[Raja Ampat]] regency of the [[West Papua (province)|West Papua]] geographical and administrative region of [[Indonesia]].

The island is surrounded by two large [[reefs]].

[[Pulau Ayu]] and [[Pulau Kanobe]] are two other small inhabited islands south-west and south of Pulau Reni.

Pulau Reni lies {{convert|27|km|abbr=on}} north-east of [[Pulau Ayu]] and {{convert|11|km|abbr=on}} north of Pulau Kanobe.

Access to the island is limited to small [[boats]] due to the reefs and the small size of the island.

==World War II==
Pulau Reni and all the islands in the Ayu Archipelago were occupied by the [[Japanese Empire]] during [[World War II]] from 1942 until the end of the war in 1945.

The '''Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea''' ({{lang-fr|Union des forces démocratiques de Guinée}}, UFDG) is a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[political party]] in [[Guinea]].

The party was founded in 1991 by a number of opposition parties and groups. In October 2002 it was joined by a section of [[Union for Progress and Renewal (Guinea)|Union for Progress and Renewal]] under the leadership of [[Mamadou Boye Bah]], which unlike the majority of their party wanted to boycott the [[Guinean legislative election, 2002|2002 parliamentary election]]. Mamadou Ba was subsequently elected as President of UFDG.  The party affiliated to the [[Republican Front for Democratic Change]] alliance, which intended to field a candidate in the [[Guinean presidential election, 2003|2003 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;''Africa South of the Sahara 2004'', p.508&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2007 onwards the presidency of the party has been held by [[Cellou Dalein Diallo]], who stood for the party in the [[Guinean presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election]], topping the poll in the first round before narrowly losing to [[Alpha Conde]] in the second round.

On 25 July 2015, Diallo was named as the UFDG's candidate for the [[Guinean presidential election, 2015|2015 presidential election]] at a party congress; he was also re-elected to lead the party for another five years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/guineas-former-pm-run-presidency-october-203000084.html "Guinea's former PM to run for presidency in October"], AFP, 25 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was created by expatriates from Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United States.&lt;ref name=AFPSnowdenfilm/&gt; The producers of the film were Jeff Floro, Edwin Lee{{#tag:ref|{{zh|c=李健恩|p=Lǐ Jiànēn}}|group=note}}, Shawn Tse{{#tag:ref|{{zh|first=t|t=謝兆龍|s=谢兆龙|p=Xiè Zhàolóng}}|group=note}}, and Marcus Tsui{{#tag:ref|{{zh|first=t|t=崔正傑|s=崔正杰|p=Cuī Zhèngjié|labels=no}}|group=note}}.&lt;ref name=FraterSnowdeliv/&gt; Lee, an Irish citizen,&lt;ref name=CNNLai&gt;Lai, Alexis.

Retrieved on 2 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and the sole professional filmmaker involved, served as the editor and cinematographer.&lt;ref name=AFPSnowdenfilm/&gt; Lee had served as a journalist in the multimedia and television sectors and had worked for the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' and [[ATV Home]].&lt;ref name=FraterSnowdeliv/&gt; On 11 July 2013, two days after Snowden revealed his identity, Edwin Lee had contacted his friends on the possibility of making a film.&lt;ref name=CNNLai/&gt; Lee and Tsui created the film's script,&lt;ref name=FraterSnowdeliv/&gt; and did so one day before shooting. The actors had no time to rehearse their lines.&lt;ref name=CNNLai/&gt;

According to the producers, the film was intended to be an homage to Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=CNNLai/&gt; Lee said "We were so intrigued as to why Snowden came to Hong Kong. All of us love Hong Kong to death; we all call Hong Kong home."&lt;ref name=CNNLai/&gt; The filmmakers, on the group YouTube page, stated "While nearly every media outlet wanted to get their hands on him, we decided to produce a short fiction video to depict his experience in HK, and how it would have affected certain parties. Namely, the CIA contingent based in HK who would be tasked to find Snowden. The Hong Kong police who would be stuck in between the U.S. and China, and the journalists who want to get the scoop."&lt;ref name=FlorCruz/&gt; Lee said that the film was created "to catch onto the interest on Snowden and the attention on Hong Kong."&lt;ref name=AFPSnowdenfilm/&gt; According to Tse, a then 28-year-old native of [[Toronto]], Ontario and a graduate of the [[York University]] film studies programme who worked as a teacher in Hong Kong,&lt;ref name=DeMaraBoost&gt;DeMara, Bruce.

Retrieved on 21 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; "We tried to give Hong Kong the limelight we think it deserves."&lt;ref name=CNNLai/&gt; Tse said that the group had initially considered an outright comedy, a spoof, or a thriller in the style of [[Jason Bourne]]; ultimately they opted for a depiction of the events that may have unfolded.&lt;ref name=NapolitanoLCL/&gt; Lee said that the Bourne film series and the works of director [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]] had inspired him.&lt;ref name=CNNLai/&gt;

In regards to Snowden's presence, the filmmakers stated that while Snowden is "a central character, he is not the most prominent. It is more about the maelstrom of events surrounding him."&lt;ref name=FlorCruz/&gt; This was because they knew too little about Snowden himself to give him a more prominent role in the story.&lt;ref name=FlorCruz/&gt; Lee said that the film focuses more on the "vignettes" than on Snowden and that Snowden serves as a catalyst for events that affect the other characters.&lt;ref name=CNNLai/&gt; Snowden himself has no live dialogue in the film. Lee said that half of the film's focus was on Hong Kong, and half was on Snowden.&lt;ref name=CNNLai/&gt;&lt;!--The film uses an excerpt from his videotaped speech but CNN says "Curiously Snowden has no dialogue in the film."--&gt;

The four filmmakers stated that they had no political motives.&lt;ref name=KeeganFilm/&gt; Shawn Tse said that "We knew right from the get-go that this film was going to be as neutral as possible and in a way try not to infringe upon basically what we thought Snowden was trying to do, because really we had no idea."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2013/08/20/whistleblowers-big-screen Whistleblowers’ Stories Head To The Big Screen]."

Retrieved on 27 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Lee described the film as a "snapshot in time" and said that "When Snowden popped up in Hong Kong he got so much attention that it really got people talking. We wanted to give an alternative view on the situation, beyond the media chase for where he was and what he knew."&lt;ref name=FraterSnowdeliv/&gt; Cassandra Chan, who served as the associate producer, said "The US government has abused the internet, so our response is to use the power of the internet, for hopefully good reasons."&lt;ref name=FraterSnowdeliv/&gt;

Dean Napolitano of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that the film "makes subtle observations about Hong Kong's sometimes tense relationship with [[mainland China]] and the "[[one country, two systems]]" policy – underscored in a scene where a security official from [[Government of the People's Republic of China|China's central government]] barks orders to Hong Kong police officers."&lt;ref name=NapolitanoLCL/&gt; During the aforementioned scene, the official from the Mainland speaks [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] while the Hong Kong officials speak [[Cantonese]].&lt;ref name=CNNLai/&gt; According to Napolitano, the film implies that the Chinese authorities have the real power in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=NapolitanoLCL/&gt; Lee stated that the scene was "vehicle to represent (Hong Kong's) relationship with China" and, as paraphrased by Alexis Lai of ''[[CNN]]'', "the murkiness of Beijing's role in the Snowden affair."&lt;ref name=CNNLai/&gt; In regards to the scene, Lee said "To say China wasn't pulling any strings at all would be naïve ... Even though it gives us autonomy, it's always Beijing that calls the shots."&lt;ref name=CNNLai/&gt; Officially officials from the Mainland government said that they did not influence the decisions of the Hong Kong authorities.&lt;ref name=CNNLai/&gt;

By 1 July 2013 Edwin Lee said that because Snowden left Hong Kong, there are no plans to write a sequel.&lt;ref name=CNNLai/&gt; By 29 July 2013, the filmmakers had plans to show their film at film festivals, and considered making a sequel.&lt;ref name=IpStephanieProud/&gt;

''Agence France-Presse'' stated that the film "stayed true to the actual locations in Hong Kong where Snowden was reportedly seen."&lt;ref name=AFPSnowdenfilm/&gt; Some scenes were shot at [[The Mira Hotel]].&lt;ref name=NapolitanoLCL/&gt; Several office interiors were used for other scenes. A lingerie company let the filmmakers use their offices.&lt;ref name=FraterSnowdeliv/&gt;

Edwin Lee, one of the filmmakers said that the filming style was "a lot of adrenaline... it was all very guerilla filmmaking style."&lt;ref name=AFPSnowdenfilm/&gt; He also stated that "It was foot-on-the-gas filmmaking."&lt;ref name=NapolitanoLCL/&gt; Lee described the filming style as a "[[docu-drama]] recreation."&lt;ref name=NapolitanoLCL/&gt; Napolitano said that "In some ways it resembles a modern Hong Kong crime drama, with its technical dialogue in sterile conference rooms, time-lapse photography, and sweeping aerial shots of the city's famous skyline."&lt;ref name=NapolitanoLCL/&gt; Jonathan DeHart of ''[[The Diplomat]]'' stated that the usage of time-lapse-style footage of grey clouds, the Hong Kong panoramas, and the "shaky cam" style are features of "spy" genre films.&lt;ref name=DeHartDiplomat&gt;DeHart, Jonathan.

As of 28 June 2013 the filmmakers had not yet determined the total cost of the film.

Dean Napolitano of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that "The film is not quite a "[[Saturday Night Live]]"-style spoof, but neither is it a slick thriller given its cast of non-actors and micro budget."&lt;ref name=NapolitanoLCL/&gt; Rebecca Keegan of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated that ''Verax'' "feels quite polished for an insta-film" due to the presence of electronic music soundtrack that she likens to [[The Social Network (soundtrack)|the soundtrack of]] ''[[The Social Network]]'', the "sweeping views of Hong Kong skyscrapers" and the shots within The Mira Hotel.&lt;ref name=KeeganFilm/&gt; Keegan added that "the actors' leaden delivery sometimes gives their neophyte status away."&lt;ref name=KeeganFilm/&gt; ''[[The Voice of Russia]]'' stated that the "shaky camera work" and the usage of local actors was "reminiscent of the [[Jason Bourne|Bourne]] spy thriller series."&lt;ref name=VoiceofRussia/&gt; Patrick Frater of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said that the film had "strong production values, driving music and somewhat more amateurish acting performances."&lt;ref name=FraterSnowdeliv/&gt; Alexis Lai of ''[[CNN]]'' said that the film "is surprisingly suspenseful and sophisticated, with gorgeous time-lapse panoramas of the city and "shaky cam" shots reminiscent of Hollywood."&lt;ref name=CNNLai/&gt;

==Cast==
The cast of the film consisted of friends of the four filmmakers. Dean Napolitano of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said that the cast had "varying degrees of thespian abilities".&lt;ref name=NapolitanoLCL/&gt; Andrew Cromeek, a 25-year-old American from [[Chester (village), New York|Chester, New York]] who was an English teacher, took the role as Snowden.

In regards to the criticism, Andrew Cromeek argued that the filmmakers did not expect to gain a large amount of attention on YouTube and that the filmmakers were not professional.&lt;ref name=IpStephanieProud/&gt; Cromeek said "I think the way it was shot was quite cool. We are all amateur actors. We all had one take. It was kind of like, shoot, go, OK, done. So it's fine. It's completely OK if people are like, 'It's the worst acting in the world.' It's totally fine with me."&lt;ref name=Withnallamateur/&gt; Ip wrote that ''Verax'' "is a source of pride for the friends who made it, even as they acknowledge its limitations."&lt;ref name=IpStephanieProud/&gt;

'''"À force de prier"''' ({{lang-en|"By Persistently Praying"}}) was the [[Luxembourg]]ish entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963]], performed in [[French language|French]] by [[Greece|Greek]] singer [[Nana Mouskouri]]. This was the second appearance of a Greek artist on the Eurovision stage after [[Jimmy Makulis]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961|1961]].  Greece as a nation would not join the Contest until [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974]].

Mouskouri had had her international breakthrough with the [[German language]] single "Weiße Rosen aus Athen" ("White Roses from Athens") in 1961, a song originally adapted from a Greek folk melody. The song was later translated into several different languages and went on to become one of Mouskouri's signature tunes. When she received the offer to represent Luxembourg at the Eurovision Song Contest in early 1963 she and her family had recently relocated from [[Athens]], Greece to [[Paris]], France, where she was signed to the [[Philips Records|Philips]]-[[Fontana Records|Fontana]] label.

"À force de prier" is a ballad, with Mouskouri telling the object of her affections that she intends to have him love her "by persistently praying" for this to occur. Moskouri recorded her entry in French, German (as "Die Worte dieser Nacht"), [[English language|English]] ("The One That Got Away") and [[Italian language|Italian]] ("La notte non lo sa").

The song was performed sixteenth on the night, following [[Monaco]]'s [[Françoise Hardy]] with "[[L'amour s'en va]]". At the close of voting, it had received 13 points, placing 8th in a field of 16.

Although "À force de prier" was only a minor international success for Mouskouri, it won her the prestigious [[Grand Prix du Disque]] in France that same year, and her Eurovision appearance also caught the attention of noted French composer [[Michel Legrand]], who went on to write and arrange two major hits for her in the [[francophone]] markets; "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (1964) and "L'enfant au tambour" (1965).

"À force de prier" was succeeded as [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourgian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964 Contest]] by [[Hugues Aufray]] with "[[Dès que le printemps revient]]".
