[[File:Anglo American cataloging rules.jpg|thumb]]
'''Anglo-American Cataloguing Rules''' (AACR) were an international [[library]] [[cataloging]] [[Technical standard|standard]]. First published in 1967 and edited by C. Sumner Spalding,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/970324/spalding.html Pioneer in Cataloging Dies]&lt;/ref&gt; a second edition ('''AACR2''') edited by [[Michael Gorman (librarian)|Michael Gorman]] and Paul W. Winkler was issued in 1978, with subsequent revisions ('''AACR2R''') appearing in 1988 and 1998; all updates ceased in 2005.

Published jointly by the [[American Library Association]], the [[Canadian Library Association]], and the UK [[Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals]], the rules were designed for the construction of [[library catalog]]s and similar [[bibliographic]] tools. The rules cover the physical description of library resources, as well as the provision of name and [[Uniform title|title access]] points.

AACR2 was issued in several print versions, including a concise edition, as well as an online version. Various translations were also available. Principles of AACR included cataloguing based on the item 'in hand' rather than inferring information from external sources and the concept of the 'chief source of information' which is preferred where conflicts exist.

==Initial adoption==
Despite the claim to be 'Anglo-American', the first edition of AACR was published in 1967 in somewhat distinct North American and British texts. The second edition of 1978 unified the two sets of rules (adopting the British spelling 'catalog'''u'''ing') and brought them in line with the [[International Standard Bibliographic Description]]. Libraries wishing to migrate from the previous North American text were obliged to implement 'desuperimposition', a substantial change in the form of headings for [[corporation|corporate bodies]].

==Successor==
{{main|Resource Description and Access}}
While the 2002 updates included substantial improvements to AACR's treatment of non-book materials, the proliferation of 21st century formats in a [[Internet|networked environment]] and the rise of [[electronic publishing]] signaled the necessity for significant change in the cataloging code.  Plans for a third edition ('''AACR3''') were abandoned in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rda-jsc.org/archivedsite/docs.html Joint Steering Committee for Development of RDA: Historic Documents]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The international cataloging community turned its attention to drafting a completely new standard to succeed AACR.  Informed by the work of the [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions]] [[Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records]], the new framework was crafted to be more flexible and suitable for use in a digital environment: [[Resource Description and Access]] (RDA) was released in June 2010.  The [[Library of Congress]], [[National Library of Medicine]], [[National Agricultural Library]], and several national libraries of other English-speaking countries performed a formal test of RDA, resulting in a June 2011 report of findings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/aba/rda/rda_test_archives.html Testing ''Resource Description and Access'' (RDA): Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anti-Mormonism''' is [[Religious discrimination|discrimination]], [[religious persecution|persecution]], hostility or [[prejudice]] directed against the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], particularly [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). The term is often used to describe persons or literature that are critical of their adherents, institutions, or beliefs, or physical attacks against specific Mormons or the LDS Church as a whole.

Opposition to [[Mormonism]] began before the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|first Latter Day Saint church]] was established in 1830 and continues to the present day. The most vocal and strident opposition occurred during the 19th century, particularly during the [[Utah War]] of the 1850s, and in the second half of the century when the practice of [[polygamy]] in [[Utah Territory]] was widely considered by the [[Republican Party (United States)|U.S. Republican Party]] as one of the "twin relics of barbarism" along with [[slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.assumption.edu/ahc/Kansas/Republican%20Platform1856.html |title=1856 Republican Platform |accessdate=2007-09-15 |quote=''Resolve:'' That the Constitution confers upon Congress sovereign powers over the Territories of the United States for their government; and that in the exercise of this power, it is both the right and the imperative duty of Congress to prohibit in the Territories those twin relics of barbarism—Polygamy, and Slavery. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195550/http://www.assumption.edu/ahc/Kansas/Republican%20Platform1856.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern-day opposition generally takes the form of websites offering alternative views about Mormonism or non-violent protest at large Latter-day Saint gatherings such as the church's biannual [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]], outside of [[Latter-day Saint pageant]]s, or at events surrounding the construction of new [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS temples]]. Opponents generally believe that the church's claims to divine origin  are false, that it is non-Christian, or that it is a religion based on fraud or deceit on the part of its past and present leaders.

==Origin==
{{Original research section|date=February 2018}}
{{Status of religious freedom}}
The term, "anti-Mormon" first appears in the historical record in 1833 by the [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] ([[Kentucky]]) ''Daily Herald'' in an article, "The Mormons and the Anti-Mormons" (the article was also the first known to label believers in the Book of Mormon as "Mormons").&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', s.v. "Mormon".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1841, it was revealed that an ''Anti-Mormon Almanac'' would be published. On August 16 of that year, the Latter Day Saint ''[[Times and Seasons]]'' reported the Mormons' confidence that although the ''Anti-Mormon Almanac'' was designed by "Satan and his emissaries" to flood the world with "lies and evil reports", still "we are assured that in the providence of God they will ultimately tend to the glory of God—the spread of truth and the good of the church".&lt;ref&gt;''Times and Seasons'', vol. 2 no. 20, August 16, 1841, p. 513.&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-Mormon newspaper certainly was not the first of its kind; Mormonism had been criticized strongly by dozens of publications since its inception, most notably by [[Eber D. Howe]]'s 1834 book ''[[Mormonism Unvailed]]''. The Latter Day Saints initially labeled such publications "anti-Christian",&lt;ref&gt;cf. ''[[Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate]]'', vol. 3, no. 1, October 1836, p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; but the publication of the Almanac and the subsequent formation of an "[[Anti-Mormon Party (Illinois)|Anti-Mormon Party]]" in [[Illinois]] heralded a shift in terminology. "Anti-Mormon" became, on the lips of the church's critics, a proud and politically charged self-designation.&lt;ref&gt;A similar party would arise in [[Utah]] in 1883, professing to be "'anti-Mormon' ... to the heart's core." Cf. Jennifer Hansen, Letters of Catharine Cottam Romney, p. 76. See also [[Liberal Party (Utah)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the term is primarily used as a descriptor for persons and publications that oppose the LDS Church, although its precise scope has been the subject of some debate. It is used by some to describe anything perceived as critical of the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of Mormons expressing this sort of sentiment are as follows: "[http://www.antimormon.keepright.net/areyou.htm Are You an Anti-Mormon?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724171928/http://www.antimormon.keepright.net/areyou.htm |date=July 24, 2012 }}", ''AntiMormon.KeepRight.net'', accessed June 2006. "[http://www.shields-research.org/Critics/A-O_02.html Correspondence between James White and Dr. Louis Midgley]", ''SHIELDS-Research.org'', accessed June 2006. &amp; "[http://www.fairboards.org/index.php?showtopic=4805&amp;st=81 How I define an Anti-Mormon]", ''FAIR Message Boards'', accessed June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Siding with the latter, less-inclusive understanding of the term, Latter-day Saint scholar William O. Nelson suggests in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]'' that the term includes "any hostile or polemic opposition to Mormonism or to the Latter-day Saints, such as maligning [[Joseph Smith]], his successors, or the doctrines or practices of the Church. Though sometimes well intended, anti-Mormon publications have often taken the form of invective, falsehood, demeaning caricature, prejudice, and legal harassment, leading to both verbal and physical assault."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nelson |first=William O. |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Encyclopedia of Mormonism |origyear= |url= |format= |accessdate = June 1, 2006| edition= 5 |year=1992|publisher=Macmillan USA |location= |language= |isbn=0-02-904040-X |pages= |chapter=Anti-Mormon Publications | chapterurl=http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/response/general/Publications_EOM.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction===
Many of those who have been labeled "anti-Mormon" object to the designation, arguing that the term implies that disagreement or criticism of Mormonism stems from some inherent "anti-Mormon" prejudice, rather than being part of a legitimate factual or religious debate.&lt;ref name="McKeever N-Word"&gt;{{citation |title= Anti-Mormon: The Mormon N-Word |work= MRM.org |url= http://www.mrm.org/anti-mormon |publisher= Mormonism Research Ministry |authorlink= Bill McKeever |first= Bill |last= McKeever |accessdate= 2013-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Johnson, for example, makes a distinction between "personal animosity and intellectual dialogue". Johnson insists that he is motivated by "love and compassion for Mormons", and that while he "[might] plead guilty to being against Mormon''ism''", he finds the suggestion that he is anti-''Mormon'' "both offensive and inaccurate."&lt;ref name= "Eric Johnson"&gt;{{citation |first= Eric |last= Johnson |title= Is Mormonism Research Ministry "Anti-Mormon"? |work= MRM.org |publisher= Mormonism Research Ministry |url= http://www.mrm.org/multimedia/text/mrm-anti-mormon.html |accessdate= 2006-09-24 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090402034136/http://www.mrm.org/topics/introductory-issues/mormonism-research-ministry-anti-mormon |archivedate= 2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stephen Cannon elaborates,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is also helpful to know that Mormons are a group of people united around a belief system. Therefore, to be "anti-Mormon" is to be against people. Christians who desire to communicate the Gospel of Jesus Christ to Mormons are never to come against people of any stripe. Yes, evangelical Christians do have strong disagreements with Mormonism, but the argument is with a belief system and not a people. The LDS people are no better or no worse than any other group of people. Any dispute is to be a disagreement with the "ism", not the "Mormon".&lt;ref name="pfo"&gt;{{citation |last= Cannon |first= Stephen F. |year= 2000 |title= Games Mormon People Play: The Strategies and Diversions of Latter-day Saint Apologists |work= PFO.org |publisher= Personal Freedom Outreach |url= http://www.pfo.org/gameplay.htm |accessdate= 2013-01-17 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120308202146/http://www.pfo.org/gameplay.htm |archivedate= 2012-03-08 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[James White (theologian)|James White]], meanwhile, rejects the term because of a lack of reciprocal terminology. He wrote to one LDS apologist, "If you will identify yourself as an anti-Baptist, I'll let you call me an anti-Mormon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Correspondence between James White and Dr. Louis Midgley |work= Shields-Research.org |url= http://www.shields-research.org/Critics/A-O_02.html |accessdate= 2006-06-01 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060715103457/http://www.shields-research.org/Critics/A-O_02.html |archivedate= 15 July 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even some members of the church who write negatively about it, especially those who call into question its divine nature, have had their writings labeled anti-Mormon. Ex-Mormons who write about the church are likewise frequently labeled anti-Mormon, even when their writings are not inflammatory in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kempton, William |year=2006 |title=Why I'm no longer a Mormon |work=Geocities.com |url=http://www.geocities.com/exmormon2000/story.html |accessdate=2006-06-01 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5knIPGUZz?url=http://www.geocities.com/exmormon2000/story.html |archivedate=2009-10-25 |deadurl=yes |df= }}{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2012}}&lt;!-- Why is this here? Is an archive a personally published webpage... --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The debate on who is "anti-Mormon" frequently arises in Mormon discussions of authors and sources.&lt;ref&gt;E.g.: {{citation |first= Kaimi |last= Wenger |date= November 16, 2004 |title= Is Signature Books an Anti-Mormon Press? |work= [[Times &amp; Seasons, An Onymous Mormon Blog]] |url= http://www.timesandseasons.org/index.php?p=1605 |accessdate= 2012-12-11 }}; {{citation |first= Davis |last= Bitton |year= 2004 |title= Spotting an Anti-Mormon Book |url= http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=16&amp;num=1&amp;id=535 |journal= [[FARMS Review]] |volume= 16 |issue= 1 |pages= 355–360 }}; {{cite journal |first= Louis |last= Midgley |year= 2004 |title= Anti-Mormonism |journal=[[FARMS Review]] |url= http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=16&amp;num=1&amp;id=536 |volume= 16 |issue= 1 |pages= 361–406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Cannon has argued that use of the label is a "campaign by Latter-day Saints to disavow the facts presented by simply labeling the source as 'anti-Mormon'".&lt;ref name="pfo" /&gt; Critics of the term also claim that the LDS Church frames the context of persecution in order to cultivate a [[persecution complex]],{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} or that Mormon authors promote the ideal of a promised heavenly reward for enduring persecution for one's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hawkins |first=Lisa Bolin |title=Persecution |work=lightplanet.com |url=http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/response/general/persecution_eom.htm |accessdate=2006-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mormons often respond to these accusations by questioning whether critics like Johnson and Cannon really have Mormons' best interests at heart. For [[Brigham Young University]]'s 100 Hour Board, the "anti-Mormon" label serves the purpose of warning Latter-day Saints away from individuals who espouse "hatred and bigotry". It is better, says the Board, for a confused Saint to "talk to someone... that (1) has your best interests at heart, and (2) actually understands what the Church teaches."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |authors=BYU's 100 Hour Board |year=2005|title=Do you think it is wrong to go to websites that openly challenge LDS beliefs? |format=PHP |work=theboard.byu.edu |url=http://theboard.byu.edu/index.php?area=viewall&amp;id=14568 |accessdate=2006-09-24 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060910102400/http://theboard.byu.edu/index.php?area=viewall&amp;id=14568| archivedate= 10 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those individuals and groups who challenge Mormonism, particularly those who approach the challenge from an evangelical Christian perspective, would generally sustain that they do, in fact, have the best interest of the Mormon at heart;&lt;ref name=LHUopenletter&gt;{{cite web |title= An Open Letter to Mormons |work= livinghopeutah.org |publisher= Living Hope Christian Fellowship |url= http://www.livinghopeutah.org/opletter.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the most part can legitimately claim to understand what the church teaches, since many challengers of Mormonism come from an LDS background.  In addition, they often declare that highly charged words such as "hatred" and "bigotry" are employed to an excessive degree to describe any challenge to a truth claim, and often cite this reactionary response as part of a Mormon "persecution complex."{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==History==
{{Main|History of the Latter Day Saint movement|Mormonism and violence}}
[[File:G. W. Fasel - Charles G. Crehen - Nagel &amp; Weingaertner - Martyrdom of Joseph and Hiram Smith in Carthage jail, June 27th, 1844.jpg|thumb|right|1851 [[lithography|lithograph]] of Smith's body about to be mutilated (Library of Congress).]]

Mormonism, or the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], arose in western [[New York (state)|New York]], the area where its founder, [[Joseph Smith]], was raised, during a period of religious [[revivalism|revival]] in the early 19th century. Smith claimed to have several visions involving God, Jesus and angelic Native American prophets. &lt;!-- The following content is disputed. Please see talk page: He also claimed that all of the existing Christian churches were 'apostate' and 'corrupt'.--&gt; These claims were often not received well by those in the community, as evident in the following excerpt from Smith's account of LDS Church history:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... one of the Methodist preachers ... treated my communication ... with great contempt, saying it was all of the devil, that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days; that all such things had ceased with the apostles, and that there would never be any more of them. I soon found, however, that my telling the story had excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause of great persecution, which continued to increase; and though I was an obscure boy, only between fourteen and fifteen years of age, and my circumstances in life such as to make a boy of no consequence in the world, yet men of high standing would take notice sufficient to excite the public mind against me, and create a bitter persecution; and this was common among all the sects—all united to persecute me.&lt;ref&gt;{{Sourcetext | source= Pearl of Great Price | book= History | verse= 21–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the claims of a divine call often received a cold shoulder, the eventual publication of the [[Book of Mormon]],&lt;ref&gt;Latter-day Saints consider the Book of Mormon, which Smith stated that he translated from [[golden plates]], to be a work of scripture of similar importance to the [[Bible]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the official organization of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] in 1830 were met with increased opposition on various fronts.

Howe's ''Mormonism Unvailed: Or, A Faithful Account of that Singular Imposition and Delusion, from its Rise to the Present Time'' (1834), which claimed that the Book of Mormon was written by [[Solomon Spalding]].]]
In [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]], anti-Mormonism dealt mainly with issues including whether or not Smith actually had the [[Golden Plates|gold plates]]; whether those plates belonged to the people rather than Smith; whether or not Smith ever really had had visions (at least ones of theological import); Smith's treasure-digging episodes; and alleged [[occult]] practices by Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=D.

In [[Ohio]], anti-Mormons focused on the ill-fated banking efforts of the [[Kirtland Safety Society]] and other failed economic experiments including the [[United Order]].

In [[Missouri]], once the gathering place of the Latter Day Saints, Mormons tended to vote as a bloc, wielding "considerable political and economic influence," often unseating local political leadership and earning long-lasting enmity in the sometimes hard-drinking, hard-living frontier communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Monroe, R.D. |title=Congress and the Mexican War, 1844–1849 |work=lincoln.lib.niu.edu |url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/biography4text.html |accessdate=2006-06-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613030726/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/biography4text.html |archivedate=13 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences culminated in hostilities and the eventual issuing of an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] (since called the [[Extermination Order (Mormonism)|Extermination Order]]) by Missouri [[governor]] [[Lilburn Boggs]] declaring "the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State." Three days later, a renegade militia unit attacked a Mormon settlement at [[Haun's Mill massacre|Haun's Mill]], resulting in the death of 18 Mormons and no militiamen.  The Extermination Order was not formally rescinded until 1976.

In [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], persecutions were often based on the tendency of Mormons to "dominate community, economic, and political life wherever they resided."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=VandeCreek, Drew E. |title=Religion and Culture |work=lincoln.lib.niu.edu |url=http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/religionculture.html |accessdate=2006-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901114806/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/religionculture.html |archivedate=2006-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Nauvoo had become the largest in Illinois, the city council was predominantly Mormon, and the [[Nauvoo Legion]] (the Mormon [[militia]]) had grown to a quarter of the size of the [[U.S. Army]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Other issues of contention included [[polygamy]], [[freedom of speech]], [[History of slavery in the United States#Anti-Slavery|anti-slavery]] views during Smith's presidential campaign, and the [[Criticism of Mormonism#Doctrinal criticism#The nature of divinity|deification of man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rast, Ben |title=The Illinois Apology – The Rest of the Story |format=PHP |work=ContenderMinistries.org |url=http://contenderministries.org/mormonism/illinoisevents.php |accessdate=2006-06-01 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060615092023/http://www.contenderministries.org/mormonism/illinoisevents.php| archivedate= 15 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the destruction of the press of the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'' and institution of [[martial law]], Joseph Smith was arrested on charges of treason against the state of [[Illinois]] and incarcerated in [[Carthage Jail]] where [[Death of Joseph Smith|he was killed by a mob]] on June 27, 1844. The persecution in [[Illinois]] became so severe that most of the residents of Nauvoo fled across the [[Mississippi River]] in February 1846.

In 1847 Mormons established a community hundreds of miles away in the [[Salt Lake Valley]] in [[Utah]]. Beginning in 1849, every Federally appointed official left Utah under duress.  In 1857 President [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]] concluded that the Mormons in the territory were rebelling against the [[United States]]. In response, President Buchanan sent one-third of the United States army to Utah in 1857 in what is known as the [[Utah War]].

===Early publications===
Much of this anti-Mormon sentiment was expressed in publications during the early part of LDS Church history. In his 2005 biography of Joseph Smith, [[Richard Lyman Bushman]] cites four 1838 pamphlets as anti-Mormon: ''Mormonism Exposed'' by Sunderland, ''Mormonism Exposed'' by Bacheler, ''Antidote to Mormonism'' by M'Chesney, and ''Exposure of Mormonism'' by Livesey.&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, pp. 398–402.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first was the work of Origen Bacheler, who had no direct contact with the body of Mormons, and contained the contents of a debate between the author and [[Parley P. Pratt|Parley Pratt]], with Pratt's side omitted. Bushman describes the author's rhetoric as indistinguishable from that uttered by  "scores of other polemicists of his time," providing a glimpse into the kind of material considered anti-Mormon. The pamphlet described Joseph Smith as a "blockhead," a "juggling, money-digging, fortune-telling impostor" and, along with the [[Eight Witnesses|''Book of Mormon'' witnesses]], as "perhaps the most infamous liars and impostors that ever breathed. ... By their deception and lies, they swindle them out of their property, disturb social order and the public peace, excite a spirit of ferocity and murder, and lead multitudes astray on the subject in which, of all others, they have the deepest interest." He voiced outrage at "the miscreants who are battening on the ignorance and credulity of those upon whom they can successfully play off this imposture." He described the Book of Mormon as, "the most gross, the most ridiculous, the most imbecile, the most contemptible concern, that was ever attempted to be palmed off upon society as a revelation." He believed the religion "can be viewed in no other light than that of monstrous public nuisances, that ought forthwith to be abated" and that the Mormons were "the most vile, the most impudent, the most impious, knot of charlatans and cheat with which any community was ever disgraced and cursed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Origen Bacheler |title=Mormonism Exposed: Internally and Externally | version= |publisher=New York: n.p. |year=1838 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Antidote to Mormonism'' describes Mormons as "miserable enemies of both God and man—engines of death and hell." He described combat with them as being "desperate, the battle is one of extermination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=James M'Chesney |title=Antidote to Mormonism | version= |publisher= |url= |accessdate=}}{{specify|date=January 2011}}&lt;!-- need more details about this item being cited to add to verifiability --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Bushman describes the characteristics of these anti-Mormon materials as sensationalizing actuality:&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, p. 401.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The critics' writings largely controlled the reading public's image of [Joseph Smith] for the next century, with unfortunate results for biographers. The sharp caricature of "Joe Smith" as fraud and con man blotted out the actual person. He was a combination of knave and blockhead. No one had to explain what motives drove him. He was a fixed type, the confidence man, well known in the literature of antebellum America. Americans knew all about these insidious scoundrels who undermined social order and ruined the lives of their unsuspecting victims. Joseph Smith became the worst of the type—a religious fraud who preyed upon the sacred yearnings of the human soul.}}

===Sherlock Holmes===

[[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'' (1887), the novel in which the famous fictional detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] made his first appearance, includes a very negative depiction of the early Mormon community in Utah after its migration westwards and the foundation of [[Salt Lake City]]. Mormons are presented as violent, rigidly intolerant and corrupt, systematically terrorizing members of the church and forcing polygamous marriage on Mormon girls against their will (comparing Mormon practices to the well-known theme of European girls being forcibly taken to Muslim [[harem]]s).

Later in his career, Conan Doyle apologized to the Mormons for his lurid account of them as being steeped in kidnapping, murder and enslavement. During a 1923 tour of the United States, Doyle was invited to speak at the LDS Church's [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]]; while some individual Mormons expressed their bitterness, in general the atmosphere was warm and friendly far beyond the famous author's best expectations, and in later writings he presented Mormons in a very positive light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/in_another_time/041094.html |title=The Case Of The Repentant Writer: Sherlock Holmes' Creator Raises The Wrath Of Mormons |first=Hal |last=Schindler |date=10 April 1994 |publisher=''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923063139/http://historytogo.utah.gov/salt_lake_tribune/in_another_time/041094.html |archivedate=September 23, 2006 }} Page D1.

==Forms==
The most vehement opposition to the LDS Church comes from individuals or groups associated with the [[Christian countercult movement]], which is mostly an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] phenomenon. [[Daniel C. Peterson]] and [[Massimo Introvigne]] have identified two major streams of modern anti-Mormon thought. The first is "traditional anti-Mormonism", typified by Rev. Wesley Walters, [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]], and (to a certain extent) self-proclaimed "Bible Answer Man" and "cult expert" [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]]. Anti-Mormons in this category, "anxious to be taken seriously by at least a portion of the scholarly community," generally try to explain Mormonism in naturalistic terms. They appeal to "Joseph Smith's environment and his (wicked or pathological) character, perhaps assisted by a co-conspirator or two", as a sufficient explanation for Mormon origins.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, pp. 154,158. Cf. also Peterson, pp. 231–260.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the second category Introvigne tells us,

&lt;blockquote&gt;New Age anti-Mormonism", according to Peterson, "is quite different. It admits the presence of supernatural events in the founding events of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and is quite willing to acknowledge continuous supernatural influence in the life of the Church today." However, "unlike faithful Latter-day Saints, New Age anti-Mormons see the supernatural agents involved in the founding and progress of the Church as demonic, occultic, diabolical, luciferian."&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This "New Age anti-Mormon" grouping includes [[Ed Decker]], Loftes Tryk, James R. Spencer and many others. According to Introvigne, New Age anti-Mormonism emerged in the 1980s largely as a result of the rise of [[Third Wave of the Holy Spirit|Third-wave Pentecostalism]] and its emphasis on [[spiritual warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, pp. 159–161. Cf. fn. on p. 158 for a few exceptions to the 1980s date.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditional===

Traditional anti-Mormons, according to Peterson, are those who "are content to argue that Mormonism is untrue" and "incompatible with the Bible."&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, pp. 231–260.&lt;/ref&gt; While some may believe that Satan was indirectly involved in the founding of the LDS Church, they place little emphasis on his role. For them, naturalistic and historical explanations are always preferable to supernatural ones.&lt;ref name="Introvigne, p. 158"&gt;Introvigne, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most prominent of the traditional anti-Mormons are [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]]. Both former members of the LDS Church, the Tanners converted to evangelical Protestantism and in 1964 founded the Modern Microfilm Company to "document problems with the claims of Mormonism and to compare LDS doctrines with Christianity." In 1983 they turned their company into a non-profit organization and renamed it the [[Utah Lighthouse Ministry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Utah Lighthouse Ministry |work=UTLM.org |url=http://www.utlm.org/ |accessdate=2006-06-01 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060610174737/http://utlm.org/| archivedate= 10 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tanners' work has included "publishing [reprints of] many hard-to-find Mormon historical documents" and "[debating] virtually every significant topic in Mormonism".&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;Foster, Lawrence (1984) "Career Apostates: Reflections on the Works of Jerald and Sandra Tanner", ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'', 17 (2), 35,39.&lt;/ref&gt; During their prolific career they have published more than two hundred items on a variety of social, doctrinal, and historical issues.  Despite the high caliber of some of their work,&lt;ref&gt;"Jerald is a brilliant analyst of detail, with an almost uncanny ability to spot textual inconsistencies which call for explanation. His analysis showing that a pamphlet attributed to Oliver Cowdery was, in fact, a clever forgery, is only one example of research and analysis that would do credit to any professional historian." Foster, Lawrence (1984) "Career Apostates: Reflections on the Works of Jerald and Sandra Tanner", ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'', 17 (2), 47.&lt;/ref&gt; the Tanners have been criticized on a number of points: notably for the vitriolic tone of some of their more polemical pieces, their resistance to change, and their unauthorized publication of several copyrighted documents.&lt;ref name="Foster"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite news |last=McCann |first=Sheila |title=Web Site Prompts Mormon Church to Sue Critics |date=1999-10-15 |publisher=''The Salt Lake Tribune'' | quote= "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is suing longtime critics Jerald and Sandra Tanner, accusing them of violating copyright laws by posting information from an internal church handbook on the Internet..

"The church has not yet signed an agreement, but we are hopeful that a settlement is at hand," church spokesman Dale Bills..." }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the apologists' wrath toward the Tanners has somewhat subsided. In their study of anti-Mormon "word games", for example, Daniel C. Peterson and [[Stephen D. Ricks]] have nothing negative to say about them. Instead, they enlist them as allies against New Age anti-Mormons like Ed Decker, whose fabrications the Tanners have denounced on more than one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson and Ricks, 13 fn. 39, 14 fn. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most controversial of the traditional anti-Mormons, however, was [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]]. Martin saw Mormons as deceivers who "pose as Christians". He called them "anti-Christian" and "a cult infiltration" and said they secretly harbor a "deep contempt for Christians". He further accused them of being egomaniacs and "cultists".&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Peterson and Ricks, pp. 5, 9–11. See also Millet, Robert (2005). ''A Different Jesus? The Christ of the Latter-day Saints''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin left as his legacy the [[Christian Research Institute]].

===New Age===
{{Distinguish|New Age movement}}

New Age anti-Mormons have generated considerably more controversy than the previous category. The most prominent of their number, [[Ed Decker]], is the producer of ''[[The God Makers (film)|The God Makers]]'' and ''[[The God Makers II]]'', as well as being the author of the books by the same name. ''The God Makers'' has attracted criticism not only from Latter-day Saints,&lt;ref&gt;According to Michael Griffith, "Even as anti-Mormon books go, THE GODMAKERS is one of the worst, most inaccurate attacks on Mormonism ever written." {{cite web|author=Michael T. Griffith |title=Another Look at ''The Godmakers'' |work=ourworld.cs.com |url=http://ourworld.cs.com/mikegriffith1/id114.htm |accessdate=2006-09-24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907013509/http://ourworld.cs.com/mikegriffith1/id114.htm |archivedate=7 September 2006 |deadurl=yes }}. Says Introvigne, "the second book and film are worse than the first: they include an explicit call to hatred and intolerance that has been denounced as such by a number of Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish organizations." Introvigne, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; but from traditional anti-Mormons as well.&lt;ref&gt;His writings were described by Carl Mosser in ''Saints Alive in Jesus: Ed Decker – The Godmakers'' as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Decker is infamous for the mistakes he 
makes describing Mormon doctrine, the sensationalist claims he has made about Mormon rituals and leaders, and the generally uncharitable attitude with which he conducts his ministry. Most Mormons are inoculated against anything with Decker's name on it. I think it is foolish to give Decker's materials to Mormons and unwise to give them to Christians to read. The Mormon will be repulsed and hardened, the Christian misinformed. {{cite web |title=Saints Alive in Jesus: Ed Decker – The Godmakers |work=ApologeticsIndex.org |url=http://www.apologeticsindex.org/s29.html |accessdate=2006-06-01 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060530103043/http://www.apologeticsindex.org/s29.html| archivedate= 30 May 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; See also Tanner, Jerald and Sandra (1993). ''Problems in The Godmakers II''. Salt Lake City, UT: UTLM.&lt;/ref&gt; The film is generally considered acerbic and misleading, and has even provoked bomb threats against LDS meetinghouses and death threats against members.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson and Ricks, pp. 4–5 fn. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In other publications Decker has asserted that the source of Mormonism is [[Satan]] and that the spires on the LDS temple "represent an upside down nail, pointing defiantly toward heaven—as if to impale the Lord Jesus anew when he comes in the clouds of glory!"&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, pp. 158, 164.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Decker sees Mormonism as a Satanic political conspiracy with roots in [[Hinduism]] and [[Baal]] worship.&lt;ref name="Peterson and Ricks, pp. 13-14"&gt;Peterson and Ricks, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Decker was denounced by [[Jerald and Sandra Tanner]], he went so far as to accuse them of being in the pay of the LDS Church and even of being "demonized" themselves. Decker and his associates offered to exorcise the Tanners' demons, and expressed great sadness when they refused.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, pp. 166–167.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christian writer William Schnoebelen asserted that "the marks on the Mormon [[Temple garment]]s 'are held together by a subtle occult web of sexual energy which is activated by pressure from the two highest grips in the LDS Temple endowment.'"&lt;ref name="Introvigne, p. 158"/&gt; Tom Kellie similarly insisted that "the wives of Mormon apostles were compelled to submit to a special sexual type of operation."&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, p. 162. Decker later decided that Kellie was "either a deceiver or not working with a full deck."&lt;/ref&gt; Other New Age anti-Mormons have called Mormons "pagans" and Mormonism "a fountain of slime".&lt;ref name="Peterson and Ricks, pp. 13-14"/&gt;

===Protests===
[[File:09302006 SaltLakeCityUT.jpg|thumb|right|Protesters outside the site of the LDS general conference in 2006.]]
Protesters have been visible as "street preachers" at [[General Conference (LDS Church)|LDS General Conferences]], outside of LDS pageants, and temples. At the recently constructed Sacramento temple, for example, protesters dispersed pamphlets to visitors who came to take a guided tour. They also held up signs directing people to websites critical of the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garza |first=Jennifer |title=Mission Accomplished: Today, Mormon temple opens its doors to the public |work=dwb.sacbee.com |pages=K1 |publisher=''[[The Sacramento Bee]]'' |date=2006-06-29 |url=http://dwb.sacbee.com/content/lifestyle/religion/story/14283187p-15090959c.html |accessdate=2006-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004201212/http://dwb.sacbee.com/content/lifestyle/religion/story/14283187p-15090959c.html |archivedate=October 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, protesters also made an appearance at the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anti-Mormon Efforts at the 2002 Winter Olympics |work=FairLDS.org |year=2006 |url=http://www.fairlds.org/Anti-Mormons/Anti-Mormon_Efforts_at_the_2002_Winter_Olympics.html |accessdate=2006-09-25 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061007200004/http://www.fairlds.org/Anti-Mormons/Anti-Mormon_Efforts_at_the_2002_Winter_Olympics.html| archivedate= 7 October 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; One group that actively organizes peaceful protests, a non-profit organization called [[Mormonism Research Ministry]], insists that its activities are not "anti-Mormon".

&lt;blockquote&gt;Our goal at MRM is not to be antagonistic. In fact, whenever a representative of MRM speaks publicly on this subject, we often emphasize how Christians should reflect a Christ-like attitude when sharing their faith. We must be firm in our convictions but compassionate and patient as well. ... It is true that, just as some Mormons want nothing more than to ridicule and insult those with whom they disagree, some Christians have done the same. This is wrong and always will be wrong.&lt;ref name= "Eric Johnson" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some other individuals have been seen throwing copies of the Book of Mormon on the ground, stepping on them, and portray using temple garments, which LDS hold sacred, as toilet tissue, and other similarly offensive actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Neighborly Christian Love or Hate Speech?

As a result of organized protests at Mormon events, a number of Latter-day Saints, and even non-Mormons, have begun to counter-demonstrate at events (by singing hymns, for example).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Wilde, Tiffany |year=2003|title=Without the Walls of Temple Square |work=FairLDS.org |url=http://www.fairlds.org/Anti-Mormons/Without_the_Walls_of_Temple_Square.html |accessdate=2006-06-01 }} Despite the disrespect evinced by some protesters, at least one Latter-day Saint scholar has called on his fellow Mormons to "love the street preachers". {{cite web |author=Starr, Lance |year=2003 |title=Why We Should Love the Street Preachers |work=FairLDS.org |url=http://www.fairlds.org/Anti-Mormons/Why_We_Should_Love_the_Street_Preachers.html |accessdate=2006-09-25 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061104205226/http://www.fairlds.org/Anti-Mormons/Why_We_Should_Love_the_Street_Preachers.html| archivedate= 4 November 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal===
In March 2014, a court case was brought against [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|LDS Church president]] [[Thomas S. Monson]] in the United Kingdom. Monson was accused by disaffected member Tom Phillips of breaching the [[Fraud Act 2006]]. The summons alleged that two men were induced to pay [[tithe]]s to the LDS Church by church teachings which are objectively untrue. The alleged untrue teachings were:

* [[Origin of the Book of Mormon|Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon from ancient gold plates and it is historically accurate]]; and
* [[Genetics and the Book of Mormon|Native Americans are descended from Israelites who left Jerusalem in 600 BC]].

The court case was tossed out before trial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-26666144 Mormon leader "Thomas Monson fraud case thrown out"], [[BBC News]], 2014-03-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The judges dismissed the case with stark language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/20/thomas-monson-fraud_n_5002299.html?ir=Politics "Thomas S.

===Violence===
{{see also|Mormonism and violence}}
Tangible acts of violence against Latter-day Saints are considerably less common in the United States today than they were in the 19th century. The first significant violent persecution occurred in the early 1830s in [[Missouri]]. Mormons tended to vote as a bloc there, wielding "considerable political and economic influence," often unseating local political leadership and earning long-lasting enmity in the frontier communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author= Monroe, R.D. | title= Congress and the Mexican War, 1844–1849 | work= lincoln.lib.niu.edu | url= http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/biography4text.html | accessdate= 2006-06-03 | postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060613030726/http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/biography4text.html | archivedate= 13 June 2006 | deadurl= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences culminated in the [[Mormon War (1838)|Missouri Mormon War]] and the eventual issuing of an [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]] (since called the [[Missouri Executive Order 44|extermination order]] within the LDS community) by [[Missouri governor]] [[Lilburn Boggs]], which declared that "the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State." Three days later, a renegade militia unit attacked a Mormon settlement at [[Haun's Mill massacre|Haun's Mill]], resulting in the death of 18 Mormons and no militiamen. The extermination order was not formally rescinded until 1976.

After the destruction of the press of the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'' in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], Joseph Smith was arrested and incarcerated in [[Carthage Jail]] where [[Death of Joseph Smith|he was killed by a mob]] on June 27, 1844. The [[Illinois Mormon War|persecution in Illinois]] became so severe that most of the residents of Nauvoo fled across the [[Mississippi River]] in February 1846.

Even after Mormons established a community hundreds of miles away in the [[Salt Lake Valley]] in 1847, anti-Mormon activists in [[Utah Territory]] convinced U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] that the Mormons in the territory were rebelling against the United States; critics pointed to [[plural marriage]] as a sign of the rebellion. In response, President Buchanan sent one-third of the American standing army in 1857 to Utah in what is known as the [[Utah War]].

More recent persecution against Mormons in the U.S. has occasionally taken the shape of acts of vandalism against church property (see [[Protests against Proposition 8 supporters]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. {{cite web |author=Churchill, Marlowe |year=2000 |title=Judge Orders Vandals Of LDS Chapels To Write Book Of Mormon Essay |format=SHTML |work=mormonstoday.com |url=http://www.mormonstoday.com/000514/D1ChapelVandals01.shtml |accessdate=2006-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At an LDS Church building in [[Orangevale, California|Orangevale]], [[Sacramento County]], vandals spray painted "No on 8" and "No on Prop 8" on the front sign and sidewalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.news10.net/news/local/story.aspx?storyid=50266 |title= Prop 8 Protesting Turns Ugly |date= 2008-11-10 |accessdate= 2009-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An affiliate group of the radical Trans/Queer organization [[Bash Back!]], claims credit for pouring glue into the locks of an LDS Church building and spray painting on its walls.

In Latin America, however, hatred of Mormons has often taken on a much deadlier form. In May 1989, members of a terrorist organization called the [[Zarate Willka Armed Forces of Liberation]] murdered two Mormon missionaries in La Paz, Bolivia. Another Bolivian terrorist group, the [[Tupac Katari Guerrilla Army]], claimed responsibility for two attacks against Mormon chapels.

===Official===

Although a position on anti-Mormonism is not part of the official doctrine of the LDS Church, it has been mentioned specifically in a number of [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]] talks made by church [[General authority|general authorities]].

[[Marvin J. Ashton]], speaking as a member of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], began a fall 1982 conference by relating an experience he had with a protester outside [[Temple Square]]. He went on to declare "[t]o the world, and especially to members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" that "there is no time for contention." He then quoted [[Robert Frost]] in his prescribed response to anti-Mormonism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The poet Robert Frost once defined education as "the ability to listen to almost anything without losing your temper or your self-confidence." Probably we will never be free of those who are openly anti-Mormon. Therefore, we encourage all our members to refuse to become anti-anti-Mormon. In the wise words of old, can we "live and let live"?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Marvin J. Ashton |authorlink=Marvin J. Ashton |title=Pure Religion |journal=Ensign |date=November 1982 |volume= |pages=63 |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/1982/11/pure-religion |format= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Carlos E. Asay]] of the Presidency of the First [[Seventy (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Seventy]] spoke in the fall 1981 conference concerning opposition to the LDS Church. He describes "[[Lucifer]]" as the source of at least some anti-Mormon and apostate groups, relates an experience of a Mormon convert being excommunicated and encourages the avoidance of "those who would tear down your faith":
&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the spring of 1820, Lucifer has led a relentless attack against the Latter-day Saints and their leaders. A parade of anti-Christs, anti-Mormons, and apostate groups have appeared on the scene. Many are still among us and have released new floods of lies and false accusations. These faith-killers and testimony-thieves use personal contacts, the printed word, electronic media, and other means of communication to sow doubts and to disturb the peace of true believers.

Two months ago we received a tender letter from a bishop. He informed us that he had been involved in an excommunication of a recent convert. The new convert had fallen under the influence of a very dedicated apostate who was successful in destroying the convert's testimony. It seems that, to discredit Joseph Smith and subsequent prophets, the apostate cited changes made in Church publications over the years.

The approach used by the apostate is common among those who are more interested in shadows than in light. Their logic, if followed, would have them burning the New Testament because Luke's account of the gospel is not exactly like Matthew's or because the book of Acts reports two differing versions of Paul's vision on the road to Damascus. (See Acts 9:1–9 and Acts 22:4–11.) Belief in modern prophets and continuous revelation is absent in the lives of many apostates. They would pin their hopes for salvation upon things other than those related to living prophets and living faith.

... Avoid those who would tear down your faith. Faith-killers are to be shunned. The seeds which they plant in the minds and hearts of men grow like cancer and eat away the Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carlos E. Asay |authorlink=Carlos E.

[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], the [[President of the Church|president of the LDS Church]], related a story in the fall 1997 conference in which he read from the letter of an ex-Mormon who left the church at the urging of his fiancée, whom the letter-writer indicates is anti-Mormon. Hinckley describes the situation in the letter as a "terrible tragedy" and states that he "believe[s] the writer still has a testimony of this work. That testimony has been with him since the time he was baptized, but he has felt neglected and of no consequence to anyone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gordon B. Hinckley |authorlink=Gordon B.

A passage from an early Mormon epistle addresses a claimed tendency of ex-Mormons to criticize the church of which they are no longer a part:  
	
&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]postates after turning from the faith of Christ ... have sooner or later fallen into the snares of the wicked one, and have been left destitute of the Spirit of God, to manifest their wickedness in the eyes of multitudes. From apostates the faithful have received the severest persecutions ... "When once that light which was in them is taken from them, they become as much darkened as they were previously enlightened, and then, no marvel, if all their power should be enlisted against the truth," and they, Judas like, seek the destruction of those who were their greatest benefactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph F. |last=Smith |authorlink=Joseph F. Smith |title=Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, 1834-1837 | edition= |publisher= |location= |page=66 }} Although sometimes mistaken for a direct quote from Joseph Smith, this passage occurs in the book as part of "Excerpts from an Epistle of the Elders of the Church in Kirtland to Their Brethren Abroad", edited by Oliver Cowdery and F. G. Williams as published in ''[[The Evening and the Morning Star]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1985, [[Vaughn J Featherstone]], a member of the [[First Quorum of the Seventy]] of the LDS Church, addressed students at the church-owned [[Brigham Young University]], calling anti-Mormon material "theological pornography that is damaging to the spirit," stating that "none of it is worth casting an eye upon. Do not read the anti-Mormon materials. That is not the way you resolve questions about the truthfulness of the restored gospel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Featherstone, Vaughn J. |year=1985 |title=The Last Drop in the Chalice |format=PHP |work=Speeches.BYU.edu |url=http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=6988 |accessdate=2006-06-01 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060526084317/http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=6988| archivedate= 26 May 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apologetic===
{{Main|Mormon apologetics}}

Mormon apologetics and members vary both in their perception of criticism and opposition, as well as what they see as falling under the umbrella of anti-Mormonism. [[Hugh Nibley]], the author of voluminous works in response to books deemed anti-Mormon, including a chapter on how to write an anti-Mormon book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nibley |first=Hugh |authorlink=Hugh Nibley |editor=[[David J. Whittaker]] |others= |title=Tinkling Cymbals and Sounding Brass: The Art of Telling Tales About Joseph Smith and Brigham Young (The Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol 11) |origyear= |url= |accessdate=| edition= |date= August 1991 |publisher=[[Deseret Book Company]] |location= |language= |isbn=0-87579-516-1 |pages=474–580 |chapter=Part 3: How To Write An anti-Mormon Book (A Handbook for Beginners) | chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; explained why he thinks ex-Mormons criticize the church:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Apostates usually become sometimes feverishly active, determined to prove to the world and themselves that it is a fraud after all. What is that to them? Apparently it is everything—it will not let them alone. At the other end of the scale are those who hold no rancor and even retain a sentimental affection for the Church—they just don't believe the gospel. I know quite a few of them. But how many of ''them'' can leave it alone? It haunts them all the days of their life. No one who has ever had a testimony ever forgets or denies that he once ''did'' have it—that it was something that really happened to him. Even for such people who do not have it anymore, a testimony cannot be reduced to an illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nibley |first=Hugh |authorlink= |editor=Don E. Norton |others= |title=Approaching Zion (Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, Vol. 9) |origyear= |url= |accessdate=| edition= |year=1989|publisher= Deseret Book Co.|location= Salt Lake City, Utah|language= |isbn=0-87579-252-9 |chapter=6 | chapterurl= |page=155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Davis Bitton]] presented criteria on how to identify anti-Mormon material in a 2004 paper published for the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS) entitled, "Spotting an Anti-Mormon Book." He specifies inaccuracy, telling Mormons what they believe, strong preference for negative information, always showing "the church, its leaders, its people, and its beliefs in the worst possible light," participating in anti-Mormon activities, denouncing the church, engaging in "behavior defiantly contrary to church standards," unjustly claiming to be a Latter-day Saint, and indulging in "snide, disrespectful, cruel comments about the Saints and those they sustain as prophets" as characteristics of anti-Mormon books and authors. Additionally, he singles out publishers such as the Utah Gospel Mission and the Utah Lighthouse Ministry as being "anti-Mormon, at least in intent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bitton, Davis |year=2004 |title=Spotting an Anti-Mormon Book |format=PHP |work=FARMS.byu.edu |url=http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=review&amp;id=535 |accessdate=2006-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another FARMS review, this time of ''New Approaches to the Book of Mormon: Explorations in Critical Methodology'' by Brent Lee Metcalfe, Bitton reveals more of his thoughts on the subject:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am not entirely comfortable with labeling this an anti-Mormon work, for I don't see hatred of the Church and a determination to destroy as the prime motive behind it. On the other hand, whatever the intention of individual authors, the label is not entirely misapplied either. In any case, one thing is sure: the compilation will be exploited by the Mormon-haters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bitton, Davis |year=1994 |title=Review of New Approaches to the Book of Mormon: Explorations in Critical Methodology by Brent Lee Metcalfe |format= |work=FARMS.BYU.edu |url=http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=review&amp;id=134 |accessdate=2006-10-10 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906021553/http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=review&amp;id=134 |archivedate=6 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others consider the definition of anti-Mormonism rather fundamentally: those in opposition to or against the LDS Church. While not including those who simply believe differently, it includes those who are actively engaged in opposing the LDS Church. Thus, a person's intelligence, honesty, qualification or accreditation do not make them anti-Mormon. Anti-Mormon arguments are those in opposition to the claims and institutional aims of the LDS Church, and anti-Mormons are those who spend a significant amount of time opposing the church via such arguments or otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How I define an anti-Mormon |format= |work=FAIR message boards |url=http://www.fairboards.org/index.php?showtopic=4805&amp;st=81 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20131021191719/http://www.fairboards.org/index.php?showtopic=4805&amp;st=81 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-10-21 |accessdate=2006-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many members of the LDS Church believe that since the church is sanctioned by God, [[Satan]] and his followers will seek to destroy it, with some even seeing this opposition as evidence that the LDS Church has divine origins. Some avoid anti-Mormon material, while others analyze and criticize it, such as [[William J. Hamblin]], who addresses anti-Mormon attacks on the geography and archeology of the Book of Mormon in "Basic Methodological Problems with the Anti-Mormon Approach to the Geography and Archaeology of the Book of Mormon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=William J. Hamblin |authorlink=William J. Hamblin |title=Basic Methodological Problems with the Anti-Mormon Approach to the Geography and Archaeology of the Book of Mormon |journal=Journal of Book of Mormon Studies |date=Spring 1993 |volume= |pages=161–197 |url=http://farms.byu.edu/display.php?table=transcripts&amp;id=39 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prominent LDS Church members note that the opposition from anti-Mormonism can actually be beneficial. As Hugh Nibley expressed it, "We need more anti-Mormon books. They keep us on our toes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nibley |first=Hugh |authorlink= |editor= |others= |title=Nibley on the Timely and the Timeless |origyear= |url= |accessdate=| edition= |year=1978|publisher=[[BYU]] [[Religious Studies Center]] |location=Provo, Utah |language=   |chapter= | chapterurl= |nopp=true|page=Xii }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael R. Ash of the [[Foundation for Apologetic Information and Research]] (FAIR) dissected this viewpoint in "The Impact of Mormon Critics on LDS Scholarship," concluding that the accusations of critics are helpful in encouraging and stimulating further research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ash, Michael R.|year=2002|title=The Impact of Mormon Critics on LDS Scholarship |work=FAIRLDS.org |url=http://www.fairlds.org/FAIR_Conferences/2002_Impact_of_Mormon_Critics_on_LDS_Scholarship.html |accessdate=2006-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orson Pratt]] also seemed to invite criticism when he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Convince us of our errors of doctrine, if we have any, by reason, by logical arguments, or by the word of God, and we will be ever grateful for the information, and you will ever have the pleasing reflection that you have been instruments in the hands of God of redeeming your fellow beings from the darkness which you may see enveloping their minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Orson Pratt |authorlink=Orson Pratt |title=The Seer |journal=UCLA Law Review |date=January 1853 |volume=1:1 |pages=15–16 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Evangelical===

Regarding the subject of Christian anti-Mormonism, [[Richard Mouw]] (President of the [[Fuller Theological Seminary]]) stated in 2004 at the [[Salt Lake Tabernacle]] in [[Salt Lake City]], 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am now convinced that we ... have often seriously misrepresented the beliefs and practices of the Mormon community. Indeed, let me state it bluntly to the LDS folks here this evening: we have sinned against you. The God of the Scriptures makes it clear that it is a terrible thing to bear false witness against our neighbors, and we have been guilty of that sort of transgression in things we have said about you. We have told you what you believe without making a sincere effort first of all to ask you what you believe...Indeed, we have even on occasion demonized you, weaving conspiracy theories about what the LDS community is 'really' trying to accomplish in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mouw |first=Richard |title='We Have Sinned Against You' |work=jmm.aaa.net.au |url=http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/13908.htm |date=2005-01-15 |accessdate=2006-09-25 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060825003232/http://jmm.aaa.net.au/articles/13908.htm| archivedate= 25 August 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}, {{cite web |last=Moore |first=Carrie A. |title=Evangelical preaches at Salt Lake Tabernacle |publisher=''[[Deseret Morning News]]'' |url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,595105580,00.html |date=2004-11-15 |accessdate=2006-08-13 }} Mouw's remarks generated mixed reactions from members of the evangelical community, ranging from heartfelt agreement to biting criticism. {{cite web |last=Moore |first=Carrie A. |title=Speaker's apology to LDS stirs up fuss |publisher=''Deseret Morning News'' |url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/1,1249,600104625,00.html |date=2005-01-15 |accessdate=2006-09-25}}, {{cite web |last=Huggins |first=Ronald V. |authorlink= Ronald V.

Mouw is not the only Christian calling for moderation. Similar pleas have been issued by David Rowe,&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, David L. (2005). ''I Love Mormons: A New Way to Share Christ with Latter-day Saints''. Grand Rapids, MI: Baker.&lt;/ref&gt; Carl Mosser, Francis J. Beckwith, Paul Owen,&lt;ref&gt;Mosser, Carl, Francis J.

A Mormon and an Evangelical in Conversation''. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity, 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Some church and parachurch groups have also made efforts to repair relations with the Mormons. In the 1980s, Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority "took some small steps toward Evangelical-Mormon cooperation for a shared social, political, and ethical agenda".&lt;ref&gt;Blomberg, Craig and [[Stephen E. Robinson]] (1997). ''How Wide the Divide? A Mormon and an Evangelical in Conversation''. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity, 25.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, a Pentecostal congregation in Provo, Utah held a public ceremony of repentance for its negative attitudes and actions toward the Latter-day Saint community.&lt;ref&gt;Dean Merrill, "A Peacemaker in Provo," ''Christianity Today'', February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the organization Standing Together, based in Lehi, Utah, was founded by a Baptist minister for the purpose of "building bridges of relationship and dialogue with ...

Some traditional Christian churches and ministries, however, have expressed varying degrees of concern about the movement to abandon what they consider to be valid and cogent challenges to Mormon doctrine and teaching for the sake of "peaceful co-existence," and yet at the same time do not wish to be categorized with the fringe Christian elements that seek to be openly disruptive and antagonistic toward the LDS community.&lt;ref name=LHUopenletter /&gt;

===Political===
[[Rick Santorum]] was asked if [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.|Jon Huntsman]] and [[Mitt Romney]] will have problems in the race as Mormons. Santorum answered, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I hope not." He continued, "I hope that people will look at the qualities of candidates and look at what they believe and what they're for and look [at] their records and then make a decision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/rick-santorum-hope-evangelicals-will-look-at-more-romney-huntsman-mormon-faith-51123/|title=Rick Santorum Hopes Christian Voters Will Look Beyond Mormon Faith of Romney, Huntsman|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Joe Biden]] said, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I find it preposterous that in 2011 we're debating whether or not a man is qualified or worthy of your vote based on whether or not his religion ... is a disqualifying provision," Biden told an audience at the University of Pittsburgh. "It is not. It is embarrassing and we should be ashamed, anyone who thinks that way," he said in a long response to a student's question about how his own religious faith affected his philosophy of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-campaign-biden-romney-idUSTRE7A371Q20111104|title=Biden defends Romney's Mormon faith|date=4 November 2016|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was announced at the [[Google I/O]] conference on May 27, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[[TechCrunch]] (May 28, 2009):
[https://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/28/google-wave-drips-with-ambition-can-it-fulfill-googles-grand-web-vision/ Google Wave Drips With Ambition.  A New Communication Platform For A New Web.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iokeynote"&gt;{{cite web

Wave is a [[web application|web-based]] [[computing platform]] and [[communications protocol]] designed to merge key features of [[Media (communication)|communications media]] such as [[email]], [[instant messaging]], [[wiki]]s, and [[Social networking service|social networking]].&lt;ref name="aboutgw"&gt;{{cite web

Initially released only to developers, a preview release of Google Wave was extended to 100,000 users in September 2009, each allowed to invite additional users. Google accepted most requests submitted starting November 29, 2009, soon after the September extended release of the technical preview. On May 19, 2010, it was released to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Shankland, Stephen.

On August 4, 2010, Google announced the suspension of stand-alone Wave development and the intent of maintaining the web site at least for the remainder of the year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/update-on-google-wave.html Official Google Blog: Update on Google Wave].

==History==
[[File:Googlewave.svg|thumb|upright|The original logo while owned by Google]]

===Origin of name===
The science fiction television series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' provided the inspiration for the project's name.&lt;ref name=itnewsau&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the series, a ''wave'' is an electronic communication, often consisting of a [[video call]] or video message.&lt;ref name=itnewsau/&gt;  During the developer preview, a number of references were made to the series, such as [[Lars Rasmussen (Software Developer)|Lars Rasmussen]] replying to a message with "shiny", a word used in the series to mean ''cool'' or ''good'', and the crash message of Wave being a popular quotation from the series: "Curse your sudden but inevitable betrayal!"&lt;ref name="iokeynote" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Originally said by [[List of characters in the Firefly universe#Hoban Washburne|Wash]] at 6:36, in ''[[Serenity (Firefly episode)|Serenity]]''; [[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]: The Complete Series (Blu-ray), 2008, 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Another common error message, "Everything's shiny, Cap'n. Not to fret!" is a quote from [[Kaylee Frye]] in the 2005 motion-picture ''Firefly'' continuation, ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'', and it is matched with a sign declaring that "This wave is experiencing some turbulence and might explode. If you don't want to explode..." which is another reference to the opening of the film.

During an event in [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref name="nextweb"&gt;{{cite news | first = Ralf | last = Rottmann | url = https://thenextweb.com/appetite/2009/10/30/breaking-google-wave-opened-federation-today-host/ | title = Google Wave to be opened for federation today! | agency = The Next Web | date = October 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became apparent that the 60-strong team that was then working on Wave in [[Sydney, Australia]] used [[Joss Whedon]]-related references to describe, among others, the sandbox version of Wave called ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'' after the TV-series by ''Firefly'' producer Joss Whedon, which was aired on Fox in the U.S. The development of external extensions was codenamed "Serenity", after the spaceship used in ''Firefly'' and ''Serenity''.

===Open source===
Google released most of the source code as [[open source software]],&lt;ref name="iokeynote"/&gt; allowing the public to develop its features through extensions.&lt;ref name="iokeynote" /&gt;  Google allowed third parties to build their own Wave services (be it private or commercial) because it wanted the [[Google Wave Federation Protocol|Wave protocol]] to replace the [[e-mail]] protocol.&lt;ref name="iokeynote"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gwarchitecture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wpcsmodel" /&gt; Initially, Google was the only Wave service provider, but it was hoped that other service providers would launch their own Wave services, possibly designing their own unique web-based clients as is common with many email service providers.  The possibility also existed for native Wave clients to be made, as demonstrated with their [[command-line interface|CLI]]-based console client.&lt;ref name="osreleasenext"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://groups.google.com/group/wave-protocol/browse_thread/thread/618ff4e9ef477e80?pli=1|title=Google Wave Federation Protocol and Open Source Updates|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google released initial open-source components of Wave:&lt;ref name="osrelease1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googlewavedev.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-wave-federation-protocol-and.html|title=Google Wave Federation Protocol and Open Source Updates|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# the [[operational transformation]] (OT) code,
# the underlying wave model, and
# a basic client/server prototype that uses the wave protocol

In addition, Google provided some detail about later phases of the open-source release:&lt;ref name="osreleasenext" /&gt;
# wave model code that is a simplified version of Google's production code and is tied to the OT code; this code will evolve into the shared code base that Google will use and expects that others will too
# a testing and verification suite for people who want to do their own implementation (for example, for porting the code to other languages)

==Features==
Google Wave was a new [[Internet]] [[communications]] platform. It was written in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] using [[OpenJDK]] and its web interface used the [[Google Web Toolkit]]. Google Wave worked like previous messaging systems such as [[email]] and [[Usenet]], but instead of sending a message along with its entire thread of previous messages, or requiring all responses to be stored in each user's inbox for context, message documents (referred to as ''waves'') that contain complete threads of multimedia messages (blips) were perpetually stored on a central server. Waves were shared with collaborators who could be added or removed from the wave at any point during a wave's existence.

Waves, described by Google as "''equal parts conversation and document''", were hosted [[XML]] documents that allowed seamless and low latency concurrent modifications.&lt;ref name="ot"&gt;[http://www.waveprotocol.org/whitepapers/operational-transform Google Wave Operational Transformation – Google Wave Federation Protocol]. Waveprotocol.org. Retrieved on 2010-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Any participant of a wave could reply anywhere within the message, edit any part of the wave, and add participants at any point in the process. Each edit/reply was a blip and users can reply to individual blips within waves. Recipients were notified of changes/replies in all waves in which they were active and, upon opening a wave, could review those changes in chronological order. In addition, waves were live. All replies/edits were visible in real-time, letter-by-letter, as they were typed by the other collaborators. Multiple participants could edit a single wave simultaneously in Google Wave. Thus, waves could function not only as e-mails and [[threaded discussion|threaded conversations]] but also as an [[instant messaging]] service when many participants were online at the same time. A wave could repeatedly shift roles between e-mail and instant messaging depending on the number of users editing it concurrently. The ability to show messages as they are typed could be disabled, similar to conventional instant messaging.&lt;ref name="aboutgw"/&gt;

The ability to modify a wave at any location let users create collaborative documents, [[collaborative editing|edited]] in a manner akin to [[wiki]]s. Waves could easily link to other waves. In many respects, it was a more advanced forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://variableghz.com/2009/10/google-wave-review/ Google Wave Review]. VariableGHz (2009-10-13). Retrieved on 2010-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; It could be read and known to exist by only one person, or by two or more and could also be public, available for reading and writing to everyone on the Wave.

The history of each wave was stored within it. Collaborators could use a playback feature to observe the order in which it was edited, blips that were added, and who was responsible for what in the wave.&lt;ref name="aboutgw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gwdevblog"/&gt; The history could also be searched by a user to view and/or modify specific changes, such as specific kinds of changes or messages from a single user.&lt;ref name="iokeynote" /&gt;

==Reception==
{{Wikinews|Google to discontinue social networking application Google Wave}}
During the initial launch of Google Wave, invitations were widely sought by users and were sold on auction sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2009/09/30/google-wave-invite/ Google Wave Invite Selling for $70 on eBay]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--  However, people were confused as to how to use it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/Horizons/2009/1124/so-youve-got-google-wave-now-what Christian Science Monitor: So you've got Google wave, now what?]&lt;/ref&gt; Google Wave was called an "over-hyped disappointment for the first generation of users"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7653 Linux Mag 2009 Review]&lt;/ref&gt; with "dismal usability"&lt;ref&gt;[http://themilwaukeeseo.com/2009/12/14/the-google-wave-failure/ Google Wave Failure on Milwaukee SEO]&lt;/ref&gt; that "humans may not be able to comprehend."&lt;ref name="EngagetWave"&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2009/10/27/google-wave-to-have-its-own-app-store/ Google Wave to get its own App Store (Engadget)]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
Those who received invitations and decided to test Google Wave could not communicate with their contacts on their regular email accounts. The initial spread of Wave was very restricted.

==End of development of ''Google Wave''==
Google Wave initially received positive press coverage for its design&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/8282687.stm B.B.C. report introducing Google Wave in September 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and potential uses.&lt;ref name="EngagetWave"&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2009/10/27/google-wave-to-have-its-own-app-store/ Google Wave to get its own App Store (Engadget)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://asia.cnet.com/blogs/tokyo-shift/post.htm?id=63015591 CNET Predictions for 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; On August 4, 2010, Google announced Wave would no longer be developed as a stand-alone product due to a lack of interest.&lt;ref name="ZDNet on GW's death"&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/google/how-will-google-wave-be-reincarnated/2344 ZDNet on GW's death]&lt;/ref&gt; Google's statement surprised many in the industry and user community.

Google later clarified the Wave service would be available until [[Google Docs]] was capable of accessing saved waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/support/wave/bin/answer.py?answer=1083134 |title=Status of Google Wave - Google Help |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Response to the news of the end of development came from Wave users in the form of a website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2010/08/09/save-google-wave-site-forms '"Save Google Wave" Site Forms']&lt;/ref&gt; Since their announcement in early August, the website has recorded over 49,000 supporter registrations urging Google Wave's continuation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savegooglewave.com Save Google Wave!]. Retrieved on 2011-05-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In retrospect, the lack of success of Google Wave was attributed among other things to its complicated user interface resulting in a product that merged features of email, instant messengers and wikis but ultimately failed to do anything significantly better than the existing solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/software/news/2010/08/google-wave-why-we-didnt-use-it.ars Google Wave: why we didn't use it], [[Ars Technica]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Dawson of online technology magazine [[Zdnet]] discussed inconsistencies in the reasoning of Google in deciding to end support for Wave,&lt;ref name="ZDNet on GW's death"/&gt; mentioning its "deep involvement" in developing social media networks, to which many of Wave's capabilities are ideally suited.

==Apache Wave==
Google Wave was accepted by the [[Apache Software Foundation]]'s Incubator program under the project name Apache Wave. The Google Wave Developer blog was updated with news of the change on December 6, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;North, Alex.

In 2016, several discussions took place within the Apache Wave community, aiming to tackle the stagnation and crisis state of the project. The Apache Software Foundation mentor of Apache Wave, Upayavira,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://incubator.apache.org/projects/wave.html|title=Wave Incubation Status - Apache Incubator|website=incubator.apache.org|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; was concerned on the project stagnation, but framed [[SwellRT]] (a fork which re-engineered Wave into a backend-as-a-service for building apps) as Wave's potential savior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/September2016|title=September2016 - Incubator Wiki|website=wiki.apache.org|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Wave was approved to continue within Apache incubator program, and a copy of SwellRT codebase was placed in the Apache Wave repository in order to grant the Wave community access to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/December2016|title=December2016 - Incubator Wiki|website=wiki.apache.org|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, Intellectual Property of SwellRT was transferred to the Apache Foundation in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/March2017|title=March2017 - Incubator Wiki|website=wiki.apache.org|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still this was not sufficient to resurrect Wave's developer community, and SwellRT continued as independent project. 

===Retirement===
The Wave project retired on 2018-01-15, having never left incubator status.&lt;ref name=retirement&gt;{{cite web|title=Wave Incubation Status - Apache Incubator|url=http://incubator.apache.org/projects/wave.html|publisher=Apache Software Foundation|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extension programming interface==
{{anchor|Google Wave extensions}}
Google Wave is extensible through an [[application programming interface]] (API). It provides extensions in the form of ''Gadgets'' and ''Robots'', and is embeddable by dropping interactive windows into a given wave on external sites, such as [[blog]] sites.&lt;ref name="iokeynote" /&gt;&lt;ref name="codepage" /&gt;

The last version of robots API is 2.0.&lt;ref name="robotsapiv2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googlewavedev.blogspot.com/2010/03/introducing-robots-api-v2-rise-of.html|title=Introducing Robots API v2: The Rise of Active Robots|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google Wave also supports extension installers, which bundle back-end elements (robots and gadgets) and front-end user interface elements into an integrated package. Users may install extensions directly within the Wave client using an extension installer.

===Extensions===
Google Wave extensions are [[Plug-in (computing)|add-ins]] that may be installed on Google Wave to enhance its functionality. They may be [[Internet bot]]s (robots) to automate common tasks, or gadgets to extend or change user interaction features, e.g., posting blips on [[microblog]] feeds or providing RSVP recording mechanisms.&lt;ref name="iokeynote" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutgw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="codepage"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/apis/wave/|title=Google Wave API – Google Code|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 150 Google Wave extensions have been developed either in the form of Gadgets or Robots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wave-samples-gallery.appspot.com/ Google Wave Samples Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415004922/http://wave-samples-gallery.appspot.com/ |date=2010-04-15 }}. Wave-samples-gallery.appspot.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Robots====
A robot is an automated participant on a wave. It can read the contents of a wave in which it participates, modify its contents, add or remove participants, and create new blips or new waves. Robots perform actions in response to events. For example, a robot might publish the contents of a wave to a public [[blog]] site and update the wave with user comments.

Robots may be added as participants to the Wave itself. In theory, a robot can be added anywhere a human participant can be involved.

====Gadgets====
Gadget extensions are applications that run within the wave, and to which all participants have access. Robots and Gadgets can be used together, but they generally serve different purposes. A gadget is an application users could participate with, many of which are built on Google’s [[OpenSocial]] platform. A good comparison would be iGoogle gadgets or Facebook applications.

The gadget is triggered based on the user action. They can be best described as applications installed on a mobile phone. For example, a wave might include a [[sudoku]] gadget that lets the wave participants compete to see who can solve the puzzle first.

Gadgets may be added to individual waves and all the participants share and interact with the gadget.

==Federation protocol==
{{Main article|Google Wave Federation Protocol}}
Google Wave provides [[Federation (information technology)|federation]] using an extension of [[XMPP|Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol]] (XMPP), the [[open standard|open]] [[Google Wave Federation Protocol|Wave Federation Protocol]]. Being an open protocol, anyone can use it to build a custom Wave system and become a wave provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waveprotocol.org/|title=Google Wave Federation Protocol|publisher=Google}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of an open protocol is intended to parallel the openness and ease of adoption of the [[e-mail]] protocol and, like e-mail, allow communication regardless of provider. Google hoped that waves would replace e-mail as the dominant form of Internet communication.&lt;ref name="iokeynote"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gwarchitecture"&gt;[http://www.waveprotocol.org/whitepapers/google-wave-architecture Google Wave Federation Architecture – Google Wave Federation Protocol]. Waveprotocol.org. Retrieved on 2010-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wpcsmodel"&gt;[http://www.waveprotocol.org/whitepapers/internal-client-server-protocol Google Wave Client-Server Protocol – Google Wave Federation Protocol]. Waveprotocol.org. Retrieved on 2010-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, Google intended to be only one of many wave providers&lt;ref name="iokeynote"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gwarchitecture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wpcsmodel" /&gt;  and to also be used as a supplement to [[e-mail]], [[instant messaging]], [[FTP]], etc.

A key feature of the protocol is that waves are stored on the service provider's servers instead of being sent between users. Waves are federated; copies of waves and wavelets are distributed by the wave provider of the originating user to the providers of all other participants in a particular wave or wavelet so all participants have immediate access to up-to-date content. The originating wave server is responsible for hosting, processing, and concurrency control of waves.&lt;ref name="gwarchitecture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wpcsmodel" /&gt;  The protocol allows private reply wavelets within parent waves, where other participants have no access or knowledge of them.&lt;ref name="gwarchitecture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wpcsmodel" /&gt;

Security for the communications is provided via [[Transport Layer Security]] authentication, and encrypted connections and waves/wavelets are identified uniquely by a service provider's [[domain name]] and ID strings. User-data is not federated, that is, not shared with other wave providers.

===Adoption of Wave Protocol and Wave Federation Protocol===
Besides Apache Wave itself, there are other open-source variants of servers and clients with different percentage of Wave Federation and Wave Protocol support. Wave was re-engineered into a backend-as-a-service solution by the [[SwellRT]] project. Wave has been adopted in different forms for corporate applications by Novell for [[Novell Pulse]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novell.com/products/pulse/ Novell Vibe cloud service]. Novell.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; or by [[SAP AG|SAP]] for Cloudave,&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Timo. (2009-10-19) [http://www.cloudave.com/link/sap-gravity-prototype-business-collaboration-using-google-wave SAP's Gravity Prototype: Business Collaboration Using Google Wave]. Cloudave.com. Retrieved on 2010-12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; and community projects such as PyOfWave or [[Kune (software)|Kune]].

====Compatible third-party servers====
The following servers are compatible with the Google Wave protocol:
* '''[[Kune (software)|Kune]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kune Homepage|url=http://kune.ourproject.org|accessdate=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a free/open source platform for social networking, collaborative work and web publishing, focusing on work groups and organizations rather than in individuals. It provides lists, tasks, documents, galleries, etc., while using waves underneath. It focuses on [[free culture movement|free culture]] and [[social movements]] needs.

'''Apollonius of Tyana''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀπολλώνιος ὁ Τυανεύς}}; c.&amp;nbsp;15 – c.&amp;nbsp;100&amp;nbsp;AD),&lt;ref name=Dzielska1986&gt;{{cite book|last=Dzielska|first=M|authorlink=Maria Dzielska|title=Apollonius of Tyana in legend and history|chapter=On the memoirs of Damis|pages=19–50|publisher=L'Erma di Bretschneider|location=Rome|year=1986|isbn=88-7062-599-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes also called '''Apollonios of Tyana''', was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Neopythagoreanism|Neopythagorean]] [[Ancient Greek philosophy|philosopher]] from the town of [[Tyana]] in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Cappadocia]] in [[Anatolia]].

==Life dates==
Apollonius was born into a respected and wealthy Greek family.&lt;ref name=Haughton2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Haughton|first=B|title=Hidden History: Lost Civilizations, Secret Knowledge, and Ancient Mysteries|pages=448|publisher=ReadHowYouWant|year=2009|isbn=1442953322|quote=Apollonius was born around 2&amp;nbsp;AD in Tyana (modern day Bor in southern Turkey), in the Roman province of Cappadocia.

He calls Tyana "a Greek city in the region of..."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the precise dates of his birth and death are uncertain, most scholars agree that he was a contemporary of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. His primary biographer, [[Philostratus#Philostratus II|Philostratus]] the Elder (circa 170{{spaced ndash}}c. 247), places him circa 3&amp;nbsp;BC{{spaced ndash}}c.&amp;nbsp;97 AD.&lt;ref name=Dzielska1986/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Philostratus|first=LF|authorlink=Philostratus|last2=Eells|first2=CP|title=Life and times of Apollonius of Tyana|pages=3|publisher=Stanford University publications: University series|location=Stanford, California|year=1923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Philosophe errant Apollonius-de-Tyane.jpg|thumb|Philosophe errant Apollonius-de-Tyane|A wandering philosopher, probably representing Apollonius of Tyana, who lived a part of his life in Crete and died there. Found in [[Gortyn]] (late 2nd century AD), now in Heraklion Archaeological Museum, Crete.]]

== Sources ==
The earliest and by far the most detailed source is the ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'', a lengthy, novelistic biography written by the [[Second Sophistic|sophist]] [[Philostratus]] at the request of empress [[Julia Domna]].  She died in 217&amp;nbsp;AD.,&lt;ref name="CJones"&gt;{{Citation|title=The Life of Apollonius of Tyana|author1=Philostratus|last2=Jones|first2=Christopher P.|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=0-674-99613-5| page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he completed it after her death, probably in the 220s or 230s&amp;nbsp;AD.  Philostratus’s account shaped the image of Apollonius for posterity. To some extent it is a valuable source because it contains data from older writings which were available to Philostratus but [[Lost works|disappeared later on]]. Among these works are an excerpt (preserved by [[Eusebius]]) from ''On Sacrifices'', and certain alleged letters of Apollonius. The sage may have actually written some of these works, along with the no-longer extant ''Biography of [[Pythagoras]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dzielska pp.&amp;nbsp;138&amp;ndash;146.&lt;/ref&gt; At least two biographical sources that Philostratus used are lost: a book by the imperial secretary [[Maximus of Aegae|Maximus]] describing Apollonius’s activities in Maximus's home city of [[Aigai (Aeolis)|Aegaeae]] in [[Aeolis]], and a biography by a certain [[Moiragenes]]. There also survives, separately from the life by Philostratus, a collection of letters of Apollonius, but at least some of these seem to be spurious.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion see Bowie, pp.&amp;nbsp;1676&amp;ndash;1678.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the essential sources Philostratus claimed to know are the “memoirs” (or “diary”) of [[Damis]], an [[acolyte]] and companion of Apollonius. Some scholars claim that the notebooks of Damis were an invention of Philostratus,&lt;ref&gt;Among others, E. L. Bowie. (1978). ''Apollonius of Tyana: Tradition and Reality'' (ANRW&amp;nbsp;2, no.&amp;nbsp;16, 2) pp.&amp;nbsp;1663-1667.&lt;/ref&gt; while others think it could have been a real book [[Pseudepigrapha|forged by someone else]] and naively used by Philostratus.&lt;ref&gt;Jaap-Jan Flinterman: ''[http://www.xs4all.nl/~flinterm/Power-Paideia-Pythagoreanism.html Power, Paideia and Pythagoreanism]'', Amsterdam 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;79–88; Dzielska pp.&amp;nbsp;12–13, 19–49, 141&lt;/ref&gt; Philostratus describes Apollonius as a wandering teacher of philosophy and miracle-worker who was mainly active in [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] and Asia Minor but also traveled to [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and [[North Africa]], and even to [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Indian Empire|India]], and [[Ethiopia]]. In particular, he tells lengthy stories of Apollonius entering the city of [[Rome]] in disregard of emperor [[Nero]]’s ban on philosophers, and later on being summoned, as a defendant, to the court of [[Domitian]], where he defied the emperor in blunt terms. He had allegedly been accused of conspiring against the emperor, performing [[human sacrifice]], and predicting a plague by means of magic. Philostratus implies that upon his death, Apollonius of Tyana underwent [[Entering heaven alive|heavenly assumption]].&lt;ref&gt;Philostratus, LIfe of Apollonius 8.30-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

How much of this can be accepted as historical truth depends largely on the extent to which modern scholars trust Philostratus, and in particular on whether they believe in the reality of Damis. Some of these scholars contend that Apollonius never came to [[Western Europe]] and was virtually unknown there until the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;AD, when Empress Julia Domna, who was herself from the province of [[Province of Syria|Syria]], decided to popularize him and his teachings in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Dzielska pp.&amp;nbsp;83–85, 186–192.&lt;/ref&gt;  For that purpose, so these same scholars believe, she commissioned Philostratus to write the biography, in which Apollonius is exalted as a fearless sage with supernatural powers, even greater than [[Pythagoras]]. This view of Julia Domna's role in the making of the Apollonius legend gets some support from the fact that her son [[Caracalla]] worshipped him,&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/78*.html#18 78.18.4]; see on this Dzielska pp. 56, 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; and  her grandnephew emperor [[Severus Alexander]] may have done so as well.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Historia Augusta]]'', ''Vita Alexandri'' 29.2; the credibility of this information is doubted by Dzielska p.&amp;nbsp;174.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollonius was also a known figure in the [[Islamic world]].&lt;ref name="Martin Plessner 1960, pp. 994-995"&gt;Martin Plessner: ''Balinus'', in: ''The Encyclopaedia of Islam'', vol. 1, Leiden 1960, pp.&amp;nbsp;994-995; Ursula Weisser: ''Das „Buch über das Geheimnis der Schöpfung“ von Pseudo-Apollonios von Tyana'', Berlin 1980, pp.&amp;nbsp;23-39; Dzielska pp. 112-123.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
=== Historical facts ===
With the exception of the Adana Inscription,{{clarify|date=January 2014}} little can be derived from sources other than [[Philostratus]].  As [[James Francis]] put it, "the most that can be said ... is that Apollonius appears to have been a wandering [[ascetic]]/philosopher/wonderworker of a type common to the eastern part of the early empire."&lt;ref&gt;James A. Francis: "Truthful Fiction: New Questions to Old Answers on Philostratus' Life of Apollonius", in: ''American Journal of Philology'' '''119''' (1998) p.&amp;nbsp;419.&lt;/ref&gt;  What we can safely assume is that he was indeed a [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] and as such, in conformity with the Pythagorean tradition, opposed animal sacrifice, and lived on a frugal, strictly vegetarian diet.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Haussleiter: ''Der Vegetarismus in der Antike'', Berlin 1935, pp.&amp;nbsp;299–312.&lt;/ref&gt;  A minimalist view is that he spent his entire life in the cities of his native [[Asia Minor]] ([[Turkey]]) and of northern [[Syria]], in particular his home town of Tyana, [[Ephesus]], [[Aigai (Aeolis)|Aegae]], and [[Antioch]],&lt;ref&gt;Dzielska pp. 51–79.&lt;/ref&gt; though the letters suggest wider travels, and there seems no reason to deny that, like many wandering philosophers, he at least visited Rome.  As for his philosophical convictions, we have an interesting, probably authentic fragment of one of his writings (''On sacrifices''), in which he expresses his view that God, who is the most beautiful being, cannot be influenced by prayers or sacrifices and has no wish to be worshipped by humans, but can be reached by a spiritual procedure involving ''[[nous]]'' (intellect), because he himself is pure nous, and nous is the greatest faculty of humankind.&lt;ref&gt;Dzielska pp.&amp;nbsp;139–141.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miracles ===
Philostratus implies on one occasion that Apollonius had [[extra-sensory perception]] (Book VIII, Chapter XXVI). When emperor [[Domitian]] was murdered on 18&amp;nbsp;September 96&amp;nbsp;AD, Apollonius was said to have witnessed the event in Ephesus "about midday" on the day it happened in Rome, and told those present "Take heart, gentlemen, for the tyrant has been slain this day&amp;nbsp;...". Both Philostratus and renowned historian [[Cassius Dio]] report this incident, probably on the basis of an oral tradition.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Both state that the philosopher welcomed the deed as a praiseworthy [[tyrannicide]].&lt;ref&gt;Cassius Dio 67.18; Philostratus, ''Vita Apollonii'' 8.26–27. See also Dzielska pp.&amp;nbsp;30–32, 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journey to India ===
Philostratus devoted two and a half of the eight books of his ''Life of Apollonius'' (1.19–3.58) to the description of a journey of his hero to [[India]]. According to Philostratus' ''Life'', en route to the Far East, Apollonius reached Hierapolis Bambyce ([[Manbij]]) in Syria (not [[Nineveh]], as some scholars believed), where he met Damis, a native of that city who became his lifelong companion. [[Pythagoras]], whom the [[Neopythagoreanism|Neo-Pythagoreans]] regarded as an exemplary sage, was believed to have travelled to India. Hence such a feat made Apollonius look like a good Pythagorean who spared no pains in his efforts to discover the sources of oriental piety and wisdom. As some details in Philostratus’ account of the Indian adventure seem incompatible with known facts, modern scholars are inclined to dismiss the whole story as a fanciful fabrication, but not all of them rule out the possibility that the Tyanean actually did visit India.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Anderson: ''Philostratus'', London 1986, pp.&amp;nbsp;199–215; Flinterman pp.&amp;nbsp;86–87, 101–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

What seemed to be independent evidence showing that Apollonius was known in India has now been proved to be forged. In two [[Sanskrit]] texts quoted by Sanskritist Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya in 1943&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, ''The Āgamaśātra of Gaudapāda'' (University of Calcutta Press) 1943 (reprint Delhi 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; he appears as "Apalūnya", in one of them together with Damis (called "Damīśa"), it is claimed that Apollonius and Damis were Western yogis, who later on were converted to the correct [[Advaita]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya (1943) 1989, pp.&amp;nbsp;LXXII–LXXV.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have believed that these Indian sources derived their information from a [[Sanskrit]] translation of Philostratus’ work (which would have been a most uncommon and amazing occurrence), or even considered the possibility that it was really an independent confirmation of the historicity of the journey to India.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Classical Literature'', vol.&amp;nbsp;1, ed. P.E. Easterling/B.M.W. Knox, Cambridge 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;657; Dzielska p.&amp;nbsp;29; Anderson p.&amp;nbsp;173; Flinterman p.&amp;nbsp;80 n.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt; Only in 1995 were the passages in the Sanskrit texts proven to be interpolations by a late 19th century forger.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Swain: "Apollonius in Wonderland", in: ''Ethics and Rhetoric'', ed. Doreen Innes, Oxford 1995, pp.&amp;nbsp;251–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings ==
Several writings and many letters have been ascribed to Apollonius, but some of them are lost; others have only been preserved in parts or fragments of disputed authenticity. [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] and [[Iamblichus of Chalcis|Iamblichus]] refer to a biography of Pythagoras by Apollonius, which has not survived; it is also mentioned in the ''[[Suda]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Flinterman pp.&amp;nbsp;76–79; Dzielska pp.&amp;nbsp;130–134.&lt;/ref&gt; Apollonius wrote a treatise ''On sacrifices'', of which only a short, probably authentic fragment has come down to us.&lt;ref&gt;Dzielska pp.&amp;nbsp;129–130, 136–141, 145–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philostratus' ''Life'' and the anthology assembled by [[Joannes Stobaeus]] contain purported letters of Apollonius. Some of them are cited in full, others only partially. There is also an independently transmitted collection of letters preserved in medieval manuscripts. It is difficult to determine what is authentic and what not. Some of the letters may have been forgeries or literary exercises assembled in collections which were already circulated in the 2nd century AD.{{citation needed|date=April 2009}} It has been asserted that Philostratus himself forged a considerable part of the letters he inserted into his work; others were older forgeries available to him.&lt;ref&gt;Flinterman pp.&amp;nbsp;70-72; Dzielska pp.&amp;nbsp;38-44, 54, 80-81, 134-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons with Jesus==
Biblical scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]] relates that in the introduction to his textbook on the [[New Testament]], he describes an important figure from the first century without first revealing he is writing about the stories attached to Apollonius of Tyana:

{{quote|Even before he was born, it was known that he would be someone special. A supernatural being informed his mother the child she was to conceive would not be a mere mortal but would be divine. He was born miraculously, and he became an unusually precocious young man. As an adult he left home and went on an itinerant preaching ministry, urging his listeners to live, not for the material things of this world, but for what is spiritual. He gathered a number of disciples around him, who became convinced that his teachings were divinely inspired, in no small part because he himself was divine. He proved it to them by doing many miracles, healing the sick, casting out demons, and raising the dead. But at the end of his life he roused opposition, and his enemies delivered him over to the Roman authorities for judgment. Still, after he left this world, he returned to meet his followers in order to convince them that he was not really dead but lived on in the heavenly realm. Later some of his followers wrote books about him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman]] ''Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth'' HarperCollins, USA. 2012. {{ISBN|978-0-06-220460-8}} pp. 208-209&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ehrman goes on to say that Apollonius and Jesus were real persons and that Apollonius' followers believed [[Jesus]] to be a fraud in his book "Did Jesus Exist"?

[[Sossianus Hierocles]] argued in the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century that the doctrines and the life of Apollonius were more valuable than those of Jesus', a viewpoint reportedly held by both [[Voltaire]] and [[Charles Blount (deist)|Charles Blount]] during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apollonius of Tyana|volume=2|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1909 book ''The Christ'', [[John Remsburg]] postulated that the religion of Apollonius disappeared because the proper conditions for its development did not exist. Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam thrived however, because the existing conditions were favorable.&lt;ref name=Remsburg1909&gt;{{cite book|last=Remsburg|first=JE|authorlink=John Remsburg|title=The Christ: a critical review and analysis of the evidences of his existence|chapter=Christ's real existence impossible|pages=13–23|publisher=The Truth Seeker Company|location=New York|year=1909|url=https://archive.org/stream/christcriticalre00rems#page/20/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1949 book ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', comparative mythology scholar [[Joseph Campbell]] lists both Apollonius and Jesus as examples of individuals who shared similar [[hero]] stories, along with [[Krishna]], [[Buddha]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Bennett. ''In Search of Jesus: Insider and Outsider Images'' Continuum, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;206, {{ISBN|0826449166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Robert M. Price]] in his 2011 ''The Christ-Myth Theory and its Problems'', notes that the ancients often compared Jesus with Apollonius and that they both fit the [[Hero#Heroic myth and monomyth|mythic hero archetype]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert M. Price]]. ''The Christ-Myth Theory and its Problems'', Atheist Press, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;20, {{ISBN|9781578840175}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[G. K. Chesterton]] (the writer and Christian apologist), however, noted that the unique trial, suffering and death of Christ stand in stark opposition to the stories about Apollonius which he felt were very likely spurious.&lt;ref&gt;G.K.Chesterton "Everlasting Man" http://www.worldinvisible.com/library/chesterton/everlasting/part2c3.htm&lt;/ref&gt; While Jesus' encounter with the provincial Roman authorities in Judea ended fatally, Apollonius was said to have survived unscathed a face-to-face confrontation with [[Domitian]], one of the most harsh of Roman Emperors; therefore, the myth of Apollonius lacked the element of [[martyrdom]], central to that of Jesus.

== Impact ==

=== Antiquity ===
In the 2nd&amp;nbsp;century the satirist [[Lucian of Samosata]] was a sharp critic of Neo-Pythagoreanism. After 180&amp;nbsp;AD he wrote a pamphlet where he attacked [[Alexander of Abonoteichus]], a student of one of Apollonius’ students, as a [[charlatan]]; and suggested that the whole school was based on [[fraud]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucian of Samosata: ''Alexander, or The False Prophet'', in: ''Lucian'', vol.&amp;nbsp;4, ed. A.M. Harmon, Cambridge (Mass.) 1992 (Loeb Classical Library no.&amp;nbsp;162), pp.&amp;nbsp;173-253 (Apollonius is mentioned on p.&amp;nbsp;182).&lt;/ref&gt; From this we can infer that Apollonius really had students and that his school survived at least until Lucian’s time. One of Philostratus’ foremost aims was to oppose this view. Although he related various miraculous feats of Apollonius, he emphasized at the same time that his hero was not a magician, but a serious philosopher and a champion of traditional Greek values.&lt;ref&gt;Flinterman pp.&amp;nbsp;60-66, 89-106.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Emperor [[Aurelian]] conducted his military campaign against the [[Palmyrene Empire]], he captured Tyana in 272&amp;nbsp;AD. According to the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' he abstained from destroying the city after having a vision of Apollonius admonishing him to spare the innocent citizens.&lt;ref&gt;''Historia Augusta'', ''Vita Aureliani'' 24.2-9; 25.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Philostratus’ description of Apollonius’ life and deeds there are a number of similarities with the life and especially the claimed miracles of [[Jesus]]. Perhaps this parallel was intentional, but the original aim was hardly to present Apollonius as a rival of Jesus. However, in the late 3rd century [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], an anti-Christian [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] philosopher, claimed in his treatise ''Against the Christians'' that the miracles of Jesus were not unique, and mentioned Apollonius as a non-Christian who had accomplished similar achievements. Around 300&amp;nbsp;AD, Roman authorities used the fame of Apollonius in their struggle to wipe out Christianity. [[Hierocles (proconsul)|Hierocles]], one of the main instigators of the persecution of Christians in 303&amp;nbsp;AD, wrote a pamphlet where he argued that Apollonius exceeded Christ as a wonder-worker and yet wasn’t worshipped as a [[god]], and that the cultured biographers of Apollonius were more trustworthy than the uneducated apostles. This attempt to make Apollonius a [[hero]] of the anti-Christian movement provoked sharp replies from bishop [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] and from [[Lactantius]].&lt;ref&gt;Dzielska pp.&amp;nbsp;15, 98-103, 153-157, 162.&lt;/ref&gt; Eusebius wrote an extant reply to the pamphlet of Hierocles, where he claimed that Philostratus was a fabulist and that Apollonius was a [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerer]] in league with demons. This started a debate on the relative merits of Jesus and Apollonius that has gone on in different forms into modern times.

In Late Antiquity [[Amulet|talismans]] made by Apollonius appeared in several cities of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], as if they were sent from heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/3256.christopher-p-jones-apollonius-of-tyana-in-late-antiquity|title=Christopher P. Jones, Apollonius of Tyana in Late Antiquity|website=chs.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were magical figures and columns erected in public places, meant to protect the cities from afflictions. The great popularity of these talismans was a challenge to the Christians. Some Byzantine authors condemned them as sorcery and the work of demons, others admitted that such magic was beneficial; none of them claimed that it didn’t work.&lt;ref&gt;Dzielska pp.&amp;nbsp;99-127, 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Western Roman Empire]], [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] was a Christian admirer of Apollonius in the 5th&amp;nbsp;century. He produced a [[Latin]] translation of Philostratus’ ''Life'', which is lost.&lt;ref&gt;Sidonius Apollinaris, ''Epistolae'' 8.3; for the interpretation of this passage see André Loyen (ed.), ''Sidoine Apollinaire'', vol. 3: ''Lettres (Livres VI-IX)'', Paris 1970, pp.&amp;nbsp;196-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bahá’í ===
The ''[[Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh#Law.E1.B8.A5-i-.E1.B8.A4ikmat (Tablet of Wisdom)|Tablet of Wisdom]]'' written by Bahá'u'lláh, the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], names "Balinus" (Apollonius) as a great philosopher, who "surpassed everyone else in the diffusion of arts and sciences and soared unto the loftiest heights of humility and supplication."&lt;ref&gt;Bahá'u'lláh, ''[http://bahai-library.com/writings/bahaullah/tb/8.html Lawh-i-Hikmat (Tablet of Wisdom)]'' in: ''[http://bahai-library.com/bahaullah_tablets_bahaullah Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh revealed after the Kitáb-i-Aqdas]'', Wilmette 1988, pp.&amp;nbsp;135-152, §31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Keven (1997).

=== Modern era ===
Beginning in the early 16th century, there was great interest in Apollonius in Europe, but the traditional ecclesiastical viewpoint prevailed, and until the [[Age of Enlightenment]] the Tyanean was usually treated as a demonic magician and a great enemy of the Church who collaborated with the devil and tried to overthrow Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Dzielska pp.&amp;nbsp;193-204.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparisons between Apollonius and Jesus became commonplace in the 17th and 18th&amp;nbsp;centuries in the context of polemic about Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Dzielska pp.&amp;nbsp;204-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Several advocates of Enlightenment, [[deism]] and anti-Church positions saw him as an early forerunner of their own ethical and religious ideas, a proponent of a universal, non-denominational religion compatible with [[Age of Reason|Reason]]. These comparisons continued into the 20th century.

* In 1680, [[Charles Blount (deist)|Charles Blount]], a radical English deist, published the first English translation of the first two books of Philostratus' ''Life'' with an anti-Church&lt;!--a better characterisation than this?--&gt; introduction.
* In the [[Marquis de Sade]]'s ''[[Dialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man]]'', the Dying Man compares Jesus to Apollonius as a false prophet.
* In [[Keats]]' poem ''[[Lamia (poem)|Lamia]]'' he comes across as a killjoy.
* [[Edward Bulwer Lytton]] refers to him in ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' and ''[[Zanoni]]'' as a great master of occult power and wisdom. 
* Some early to mid 20th century [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophists]], notably [[C.W. Leadbeater]], [[Alice A. Bailey]], and [[Benjamin Creme]], have maintained that Apollonius of Tyana was the reincarnation of the being they call the [[Master Jesus]]. [[Helena Blavatsky]] in 1881 refers to Appolonius of Tyana as "the great thaumaturgist of the second century A.D"&lt;ref&gt;http://theosophy.org/Blavatsky/Articles/ApolloniusTyaneusAndSimonMagus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the mid 20th century, the American expatriate poet [[Ezra Pound]] evoked Apollonius in his later ''[[Cantos]]'' as a figure associated with sun-worship and as a messianic rival to Christ. Pound identified him as [[Aryan race|Aryan]] within an [[anti-semitic]] mythology, and celebrated his [[Sun worship]] and aversion to ancient [[Jewish]] [[animal sacrifice]].
* In [[Gerald Messadié]]'s ''The Man Who Became God'', Apollonius appeared as a wandering philosopher and magician of about the same age as Jesus; the two of them supposedly met.
* In his 1965 introduction to a reprint of Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie's 1900 book ''The Gospel of Apollonius of Tyana'' (a retelling of Philostratus' biography), [[Hilton Hotema]] compared Apollonius to Jesus by noting that there is much historical data surrounding the life of the Tyanean, but that "Jesus is unknown outside of the ''New Testament.'' &lt;ref&gt;The Gospel of Apollonius of Tyana, Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie, M.D., 1900, reprinted 1965 with a new introduction by Professor Hilton Hotema, Health Research, Mokelumne Hill, CA&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[The Circus of Dr. Lao]]'' (1935) by [[Charles G. Finney]], Apollonius appears in the employ of Dr. Lao's circus and brings a dead man back to life.
*[[Avram Davidson]]'s [[Science Fiction]] novel ''Masters of the Maze'', has Apollonius of Tyana as one of a select group of humans (and other sentient beings) who had penetrated to the center of a mysterious "Maze" traversing all of space and time. There he dwells in eternal repose, in company with the [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Biblical Enoch]], the Chinese [[King Wen]] and [[Lao Tze]], the 19th century Briton [[Benjamin Bathurst (diplomat)|Bathurst]], and various other sages of the past and future, some of them [[Martian]]s.
* Apollonius of Tyana is a major character in [[Steven Saylor]]'s [[historical fiction|historical novel]] ''[[Empire (Saylor novel)|Empire]]'', which depicts his confrontation with the harsh Emperor [[Domitian]]. Apollonius is shown confounding the Emperor (and many others) in quick-witted dialogue, reminiscent of [[Socrates]]. The book's plot leaves ambiguous the issue of whether Apollonius possessed true magical power or that he was able to use [[suggestion]] and other clever tricks.

In [[Holy See|Vatican]] usage, an '''autograph letter''' is a letter signed by the [[Pope]] in which he refers to himself as "I", or using the [[majestic plural]],&amp;nbsp;"we", as opposed to the more usual letter from the pope signed by a subordinate referring to the Pope as "he" and saying, for example, "The Holy Father has directed me to reply to your letter...".[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/2002/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_20020119_mons-rangel_en.html]

[[File:Jack Straw-David Manning-Jonathan Sinclair 031113-D-9880W-020.jpg|thumb|Sir [[David Manning]] (centre) and Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs [[Jack Straw]] (right) at a meeting with Deputy Secretary of Defence [[Paul Wolfowitz]] on 13 November 2003, eight months into the war and 11 months after the decision to invade Iraq.]]
The '''Bush–Blair 2003 Iraq memo''' or '''Manning memo''' is a secret [[Memorandum|memo]] of a two-hour meeting between [[United States|American]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] that took place on 31 January 2003 at the [[White House]]. It purportedly shows that at that point the Bush [[Administration (government)|administration]] had already decided on the US [[invasion of Iraq]].
The memo was written by Blair's chief foreign policy adviser at the time [[David Manning]], who participated in the meeting.

It has become controversial for its content, which includes discussing ways to provoke [[Saddam Hussein]] into a confrontation, with Bush floating the idea of painting a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2 spyplane]] in [[United Nations]] colors and letting it fly low over [[Iraq]] to provoke Iraq into shooting it down, thus providing a pretext for America and Britain's [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|subsequent invasion]]. 

It also shows George Bush and Tony Blair making a secret deal to carry out the invasion regardless of whether [[weapons of mass destruction]] were discovered by UN weapons inspectors, in direct contradiction to statements made by Blair to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] afterwards that Saddam would be given a final chance to disarm.

In the memo, Bush is paraphrased as saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4849744.stm |title=Bush-Blair Iraq war memo revealed|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=March 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The start date for the military campaign was now pencilled in for 10 March. This was when the bombing would begin.}}

Bush also said to Blair that he "thought it unlikely that there would be internecine warfare between the different religious and ethnic groups" in Iraq after the war.
Five pages long, and classified as ''extremely sensitive'', the existence of the memo was first alleged by [[Philippe Sands]] in his book ''[[Lawless World (book)|Lawless World]]'' (2005). It was then obtained by American [[newspaper]] ''[[The New York Times]]'', which confirmed its authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/27/international/europe/27memo.html |title=Bush Was Set on Path to War, Memo by British Adviser Says |first=Don |last=Van Natta Jr. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UK [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] leader Sir [[Menzies Campbell]] said, with regard to the memo: "If these allegations are accurate, the Prime Minister and President Bush were determined to go to war with or without a second UN resolution, and Britain was signed up to do so by the end of January 2003."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Blair 'backed Iraq war while seeking UN resolution'|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/blair-backed-iraq-war-while-seeking-un-resolution-1.770568|accessdate=February 10, 2018|work=[[The Irish Times]]|date=February 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''CNNNN''''' ('''''C'''haser '''N'''o'''N'''-stop '''N'''ews '''N'''etwork'') is a [[Logie Award]] winning Australian television program, [[news satire|satirising]] American news channels [[CNN]] and [[Fox News]]. It was produced and hosted by comedy team [[The Chaser]].

''CNNNN'''s slogan was "We Report, You Believe.", a parody of [[Fox News]]' slogan "We Report, You Decide."

In April 2004, ''CNNNN'' won a Logie Award for Most Outstanding Comedy Program, an award that was shared with ''[[Kath &amp; Kim (Australian TV series)|Kath &amp; Kim]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/04/18/1082226644288.html?from=storyrhs|title=List of 2004 Logie Winners|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald Website | date=2004-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The program was presented as a "live" feed from a fictional 24-hour news channel, anchored by [[Craig Reucassel]] and [[Chris Taylor (comedian)|Chris Taylor]]. Each episode had a theme which carried through the episode, examples (from the DVD) included:

*Lunchgate: A businessman accidentally leaves his lunch at home and is pursued by police and the media in an [[O.J. Simpson]] style chase and becomes a suspected terrorist.
*Cadman for PM: ''CNNNN'' beats up a comment by minor Australian politician [[Alan Cadman]] as a leadership challenge against Prime Minister [[John Howard]].
*Shush For Bush: US President [[George W. Bush]] is visiting Australia for 20 hours, and is believed to want to sleep the entire visit. ''CNNNN'' exhorts Australia to be quiet so the President can sleep properly.
*Animal Farm: The Chaser "reality show" ''Animal Farm'' is a send-up of ''[[Big Brother (Australian TV series)|Big Brother]]''. ''CNNNN'' covers the controversy when one of the contestants dies, but is not removed from the house.
*Packer Health Crisis: Live updates on the health of Australian businessman [[Kerry Packer]].
*Tilt Australia: ''CNNNN'' aims to reduce the water-shortage crisis in inland Australia by tilting the entire continent to drain the water from the Eastern seaboard. Radio announcer [[Alan Jones (radio broadcaster)|Alan Jones]] was duped by the Chaser team live on air for believing this concept.

==Cast members==
The roles of other members of the Chaser team included:
* [[Charles Firth (comedian)|Charles Firth]]: played a hard-hitting reporter with highly-controversial opinions presented in segments called ''The Firth Factor'', ''The Firth Report'' and ''Firth and Friends'' in which he abuses his guests, doing such things as gagging them and yelling in their face. The character could be interpreted as a parody of [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], who hosts a program on [[Fox News Channel]] called the [[O'Reilly Factor]], as well as [[Fox and Friends]]. An example of his hard hitting style, "100% of kids who smoke and have their brain removed, end up DEAD!"
* [[Andrew Hansen]]: the leader of the ''CNNNN'' "newsband", which would play musical commentary for some stories, and occasionally lyrically interact with the other members of the cast as if actually talking to them. He was also Rudi J Blass, the director of Newstainment, who would create game shows and entertainment pieces based around big news stories: "They say comedy equals tragedy plus time, well I say game show equals tragedy plus now'." Rudi J Blass often appeared in a studio very similar to that of Larry King Live and would commentate on news stories. Hansen was also Simon Target, a reporter with a thick English accent. In season one, the show started at the end of one of Simon Target's reports.
* [[Julian Morrow]]: ''CNNNN'''s US correspondent. Morrow would appear on a television as if he were overseas, although he did actually conduct a number of [[vox pop]]s in the USA to highlight American ignorance of Australia, other countries and international affairs in general. He would, amusingly, still speak about stories with no relevance to the US and sit as if he were actually on the [[news desk]], and when the anchors would look at the screen on the other side of the room at other out-of-studio guests, Julian Morrow would do the same. In one episode he actually comes out of the television into the studio after Chris Taylor turns the screen he appears on off.
* [[Chas Licciardello]]: hosted ''Lameass'', a parody of MTV's ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'', with intentionally bad stunts. He also appeared as "Mongoose" in the Sky Chaser 8 news helicopter, as the producer of a new game show (allegedly meant to be "[[The Block (Australian TV series)|The Block]]" as a musical) and as a reporter of his own name, occasionally. In the first season, he was CNNNN's [[Brussels]] correspondent and whenever the anchors would cross to Brussels, a "technical problem", like Chas having a python wrapped around him or his severed head on the desk in front of him, would cut Chas off before he could even say anything, leading Reucassel to say, "Sorry, we seem to have a technical problem there in Brussels."
* [[Dominic Knight]]: former weatherman, now a reporter.
* [[Anna Skellern]]: correspondent.

==Regular features==
Other regular features of the program included:
* A newsbar, which proved so popular it was made available on the CNNNN website.
* Market Research conducted by [[Julian Morrow]] in the United States, in which he asks civilians questions on topics such as which country America should invade next, and prompts the civilians to choose their answer from exclusively [[right-wing]] multiple choice options.
* Advertisements for Fungry's, a multinational fast food outlet with a yellow cow mascot (slogan: "I'm fungry!") Sell Massive Meat Burger (triple deck beef patties topped with [[mincemeat]] and salad), Bacon Shake and [[offal]] pie as well as Massive Meat Burger Tartare (Massive Meat Burger served raw) during Meatlovers Month, Big Breakfast in a Bun (three [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[bacon]] rashers, [[hash brown]], [[pancakes]], a French [[croissant]] and [[porridge]], once with coffee), Peking Burger (all-beef patty, prawn chips and Chinese sauce), the Chinese buffet, Pickle Burger (two pickles on a [[gherkin]] patty with pickle sauce), the Pickle Tower Burger (five pickles on a sesame seed bun), pickle fries and pickle thick shake.
* Advertisements for Boggs Lager, an irresponsible beer company which promoted heavy drinking and even frequently marketed alcoholic products with: "The strength of fifty-four beers in a single glass" (slogan: "[Let's all] Get Boggered tonight!").
* A Chaser Affair, a parody of current affairs shows ''[[Today Tonight]]'' and ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]''
* Rita + Lin: The Hyper Twins, a parody of ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]''. Each promo would feature a different villain, such as 'The Communist ABC' and 'The Powerful Aborigines'.
* Advertisements for Esteem cosmetics, whose vague advertising parodied the deliberately confusing manner in which cosmetics are marketed (slogan: "Esteem – because you need it"). Esteem advertisements had a penchant for spurious statistical claims ("an astonishing Impact Factor of 8", "85% more proven", "200% more European" "95% more womanly") and bizarre product descriptions ("Beautelligence", "Scien-suality").
* Advertisements for Lameass, a parody of the American TV series ''[[Jackass (TV Series)|Jackass]]''.

==Legacy==
A DVD containing five of the episodes from the 2003 series of ''CNNNN'' (Lunchgate, Cadman for PM, Shush for Bush, Animal Farm, and Packer Health Crisis), as well as highlights from the fake advertising breaks, was released in November 2004.

In September 2005, Chaser News Alert started running on the ABC's digital TV station [[ABC2]], shown every Thursday night at 7:55&amp;nbsp;pm. Chaser News Alerts are also shown on the ABC's Broadband website.

After ''CNNNN'', The Chaser went to its next project ''[[The Chaser's War on Everything]]'', which premiered on 17 February 2006 and featured similarly topical comedy to CNNNN.

''CNNNN'' is currently airing on [[7mate]]. The episodes retain their original endings with the ABC logo.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7386">[[File:Cartadejamaica marcalibros.jpg|thumb|A commemorative bookmark of the '''''Carta de Jamaica''''' in its bicentennial anniversary (1815-2015).]]
The '''''Carta de Jamaica''''' (or '''''Jamaica Letter''''') was a document written by [[Simón Bolívar]] in [[Jamaica]] in 1815. It was a response to a letter from Henry Cullen, in which Bolívar explained his thoughts about the social and political situation of the Spanish America at the time, the power of the Spanish Empire and the possible future of the new nations that would be created after its collapse.

==Historical context==

=== The fall of the Second Republic of Venezuela ===

In order to rebuild the Republic, the [[Admirable Campaign]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minci.gob.ve/2013/05/campana-admirable/|title=Campaña Admirable|last=MippCI|date=2013-05-22|language=es-ES|access-date=2016-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; took Bolívar very rapidly in just a few months to [[Caracas]] on August 6, 1813. However, the whole enterprise came to an end in 1814, when the loyalist troops of [[José Tomás Boves]] finally defeated the patriot forces and forced Bolívar to retreat, with the additional consequence of being proscribed by José Félix Ribas and Manuel Piar.&lt;ref&gt;Masur (1948), pp. 208-210.&lt;/ref&gt; After this defeat in 1814, Bolívar fled Venezuela with his authority lost and disputed by his own officers. The Second Republic of Venezuela was finally abolished.

=== Return to New Granada ===

Bolívar departed to Cartagena on September 8, 1814. He was in [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]] in October 1814 and stayed until April 1815. Nevertheless, Bolívar did not repeat the victorious experience of 1813 because he was a subordinate of the New Granadian authorities, which requested him to fight against the federalist forces (who opposed the centralist dictatorship of [[Manuel de Bernardo Álvarez del Casal|Bernardo Álvarez]]) rather than the loyalist armies.&lt;ref&gt;Pino Iturrieta (2009), pp. 75-78.&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to deal with the civil war that confronted the patriot factions and having neither political power nor the acceptance of several New Granadians, Bolívar decided to resign his military investiture and to leave the Spanish American society.

=== Exile of Bolívar in Jamaica ===

The ''Libertador'' made his way to Jamaica on May 8, 1815, and he arrived there six days later. Bolívar aspired to get the attention of the British Empire in order to obtain its cooperation, in which the ideal of Latin American independence means economic profit for England.&lt;ref&gt;Liévano Aguirre (1950), pp. 221-223.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Bolívar made efforts to convince the English gentlemen of his proposals, such as giving to England the Spanish American provinces of Panama and Nicaragua to build waterways.&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Simón Bolívar to Maxwell Hyslop. Kingston, May 19, 1815. ''Archivo del Libertador'', [http://www.archivodellibertador.gob.ve/escritos/buscador/spip.php?article912 Document 1290].&lt;/ref&gt; Bolívar lived in Kingston from May to December 1815 with no military activities, but he dedicated his time to think about the future of the American continent, given the situation of the world's politics.

Bolívar did not have in that year any resources to fulfill his projects of emancipation. In 1815, the ''Libertador'' gained the sympathy of the British, but he was close to poverty with few material possessions, little money and some slaves; Pío, one of them, tried to assassinate him under the orders given by [[Pablo Morillo]],&lt;ref&gt;Masur (1948), p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; whose fleet began its voyage from [[Cádiz]] to the Spanish America months earlier. In October, Bolívar's economic situation worsened in a point in which he was in despair. According to a letter written to Maxwell Hyslop, Bolívar said that he would end his days "in a violent manner" and that "it is preferable death than a less honourable existence".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Simón Bolívar to Maxwell Hyslop. Kingston, October 30, 1815. ''Archivo del Libertador'', [http://www.archivodellibertador.gob.ve/escritos/buscador/spip.php?article1488 Document 1305].&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to those misfortuned words on October 1815, Bolívar wrote the ''Carta de Jamaica''. Months later, the ''Libertador'' was required by his New Granadian fellows to help their resistance against Morillo's troops, but it was too late because the loyalist ''Pacificador'' took the city of Cartagena.&lt;ref&gt;Pino Iturrieta (2009), pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; This event made Bolívar change his course to Haiti in order to get reinforcements from [[Alexandre Pétion]]. On December 24, Bolívar was no longer in Jamaica.

==The ''Carta de Jamaica''==

=== Overview ===

The ''Carta de Jamaica''&lt;ref&gt;Lecuna, Vicente (1951), pp. 103-122.&lt;/ref&gt; was finished on September 6, 1815, in Kingston.  In it, Bolívar began by analyzing what until that time had been considered the historical successes in the struggle for liberty in the Americas.  In general terms, it was a balance of force achieved by the patriots in the years from 1810 to 1815.  In the middle part of the document are expounded the causes and reasons that justified the "[[Hispanic America|Spanish Americans]]" in their decision for independence, followed by a call to Europe for it to co-operate in the work to liberate the Latin American peoples.  In the third and final part, he speculated and debated on the destiny of [[Mexico]], [[Central America]], [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]], Venezuela, [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Río de la Plata]], Chile, and [[Peru]].

Finally, Bolívar ends his reflections with an imprecation that he would repeat until his death: the necessity for the union of the countries of the Americas. Even though the Carta de Jamaica was nominally addressed to Henry Cullen, it is clear that its fundamental objective was to gain the attention of the most powerful liberal nation of the 19th century, Britain, with the aim that it would decide to involve itself in American independence. However, when Britain finally responded to Bolívar's call, he preferred the help of [[Haiti]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3280">'''Clymer repair manuals''' are vehicle repair manuals that often focus on powersport vehicles such as [[motorcycles]], [[all-terrain vehicles]], [[personal water craft]] and [[snowmobiles]]. Clymer also has several books dedicated to small engines and "outdoor power equipment" such as [[leaf blower]]s, [[chainsaws]] and other lawn and garden power equipment.

Clymer repair manuals are named after their creator [[Floyd Clymer]], who is described in the [[Motorcycle Hall of Fame]] as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"a pioneer in the sport of motorcycling. He was a racer, a motorcycle dealer and distributor, a magazine publisher, a racing promoter, an author and a motorcycle manufacturer."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clymer repair manuals are categorized as an [[Aftermarket (automotive)|aftermarket]] product or non-OEM. Unlike [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] manuals, Clymer repair manuals are written specifically for the [[do it yourself]] as well as the professional and experienced mechanic. OEM manuals are often designed for a professional technician, who often has at their disposal an array of specialized tools, equipment and knowledge.

One valuable step in the creation process of a Clymer repair manuals is the complete disassembly and reassembly of the machine. This helps the writers for Clymer provide easy-to-follow instructions that allow the manual user to safely and efficiently service and repair their machine. This high level of detail sets Clymer apart from its factory "OEM" counterparts.

In 2013, [[Haynes Manual|Haynes Publishing Group]] acquired Clymer repair manuals from [[Penton Media]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foliomag.com/2013/ubm-sells-second-property-week UBM Sells Second Property This Week]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacturers covered==

Clymer currently has over three hundred repair manuals that cover thousands of models. Some of the most popular models are the Honda TRX ATVs, International Harvester Farm Tractors, BMW K1200 Series, Harley-Davidson FLH &amp; FLT Twin Cam 88 &amp; 103 models and the MerCruiser Stern Drive Marine Engines.

This article '''compares the technical specifications of multiple high definition formats''', including HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc; two mutually incompatible, high definition optical disc formats that, beginning in 2006, attempted to improve upon and eventually replace the [[DVD]] standard. The two formats remained in a [[format war]] until February 19, 2008 when Toshiba, HD DVD's creator, announced plans to cease development, manufacturing and marketing of HD DVD players and recorders.&lt;ref name=toshibadrophddvd&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.toshiba.co.jp/about/press/2008_02/pr1903.htm|title=Toshiba Announces Discontinuation of HD DVD Businesses|publisher=Toshiba Press Department|date=2008-02-19|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other high-definition optical disc formats were attempted, including the multi-layered red-laser [[Versatile Multilayer Disc]] and a Chinese made format called [[Enhanced Versatile Disc|EVD]].  Both appear to have been abandoned {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}by their respective developers.

{{note|HDMC_table_note_a}}'''a''' These maximum storage capacities apply to currently released media as of January 2012.  First two layers of Blu-ray have a 25 GB capacity, but the triple layer disc adds a further 50 GB making 100 GB total.  The fourth layer adds a further 28 GB. &lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_b}}'''b''' All HD DVD players are required to decode the two primary channels (left and right) of any Dolby TrueHD track;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hddvdprg.com/jpn/about/hddvd/page04.html HD DVD Promotion Group]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdforum.org/images/DVD-Forum-070605_ENG_rev110.pdf DVD Forum.org HD DVD Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; however, every Toshiba made stand-alone HD DVD player released thus far decodes 5.1 channels of TrueHD.&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_c}}'''c''' On November 1, 2007 Secondary video and audio decoder became mandatory for new Blu-ray Disc players when the [[Blu-ray Disc#Player profiles|Bonus View]] requirement came into effect. However, players introduced to the market before this date can continue to be sold without Bonus View.&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_d}}'''d''' There are some differences in the implementation of Dolby Digital Plus (DD+) on the two formats. On Blu-ray Disc, DD+ can only be used to extend a primary Dolby Digital (DD) 5.1 audiotrack.  In this method 640 kbit/s is allocated to the primary DD 5.1 audiotrack (which is independently playable on players that do not support DD+), and up to 1 Mbit/s is allocated for the DD+ extension. The DD+ extension is used to replace the rear channels of the DD track with higher fidelity versions, along with adding additional channels for 6.1/7.1 audiotracks. On HD DVD, DD+ is used to encode all channels (up to 7.1), and no legacy DD track is required since all HD DVD players are required to decode DD+.&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_e}}'''e'''  On PAL DVDs, 24 frame per second content is stored as 50 interlaced frames per second and gets replayed 4% faster. This process can be reversed to retrieve the original 24 frame per second content. On NTSC DVDs, 24 frame per second content is stored as 60 interlaced frames per second using a process called [[Telecine#DVDs|3:2 pulldown]], which if done properly can also be reversed.&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_f}}'''f''' As of July 2008, about 66.7% of Blu-ray discs are region free and 33.3% use region codes.&lt;ref name="Blu-rayStats"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.blu-raystats.com/Stats/Stats.php |title=Blu-ray Disc Statistics |accessdate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_g}}'''g''' DVD supports any valid [[MPEG-2]] refresh rate as long as it is packaged with metadata converting it to 576i50 or 480i60, This metadata takes the form of REPEAT_FIRST_FIELD instructions embedded in the MPEG-2 stream itself, and is a part of the MPEG-2 standard. HD DVD is the only high-def disc format that can decode 1080p25 while Blu-ray and HD DVD can both decode 1080p24 and 1080p30. 1080p25 content can only be presented on Blu-ray as 1080i50.&lt;br&gt;
{{note|HDMC_table_note_h}}'''h''' Linear PCM is the only lossless audio codec that is mandatory for both HD DVD and Blu-ray disc players, only HD DVD players are required to decode two lossless sound formats and those are Linear PCM and Dolby TrueHD. Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio have become sound format of choice for many studios on their Blu-ray titles but ever since Blu-ray won the format war, it has not become clear if they are now Mandatory for all new Blu-ray disc players since the end of the format war.

===Capacity/codecs===
Blu-ray Disc has a higher maximum disc capacity than HD DVD (50&amp;nbsp;GB vs. 30&amp;nbsp;GB for a double layered disc). In September 2007 the [[DVD Forum]] approved a preliminary specification for the triple-layer 51GB HD DVD (ROM only) disc though Toshiba never stated whether it was compatible with existing HD DVD players. In September 2006 [[TDK]] announced a prototype Blu-ray Disc with a capacity of 200GB.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=94|title=TDK Develops Blu-ray Media with 200GB Capacity}}&lt;/ref&gt; TDK was also the first to develop a Blu-ray prototype with a capacity of 100GB in May 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=46TDK|title=Develops 2X, 100GB Blu-ray Disc Prototype}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007 Hitachi developed a Blu-ray prototype with a capacity of 100GB. Hitachi has stated that current Blu-ray drives would only require a few firmware updates in order to play the disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blu-ray.com/news/?id=559|title=Hitachi Develops BD-100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first 50&amp;nbsp;GB dual-layer Blu-ray Disc release was the movie ''[[Click (2006 film)|Click]]'', which was released on October 10, 2006. As of July 2008, over 95% of Blu-ray movies/games are published on 50&amp;nbsp;GB dual layer discs with the remainder on 25&amp;nbsp;GB discs.&lt;ref name="Blhu-rayStats"&gt;[http://www.blu-raystats.com/stats.php Blu-ray stats]&lt;/ref&gt; 85% of HD DVD movies are published on 30&amp;nbsp;GB dual layer discs, with the remainder on 15&amp;nbsp;GB discs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hddvd.highdefdigest.com/releasedates_historical.html ''Frequently updated list of historical release dates and disc capacities''], HD DVD NEWS, High-Def Digest, 15 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hddvdstats.com/index.php ''HD DVD Statistics''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014221902/http://hddvdstats.com/index.php |date=2007-10-14 }}, HDDVDstats.com, 15 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of video compression technology (codec) complicates any comparison of the formats.  Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD both support the same three video compression standards: [[MPEG-2]], [[VC-1]] and [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|AVC]], each of which exhibits different bitrate/noise-ratio curves, visual impairments/artifacts, and encoder maturity. Initial Blu-ray Disc titles often used MPEG-2 video, which requires the highest average [[bitrate]] and thus the most space, to match the picture quality of the other two video codecs. As of July 2008 over 70% of Blu-ray Disc titles have been authored with the newer compression standards: AVC and VC-1.&lt;ref name="Blu-rayStats"/&gt; HD DVD titles have used VC-1 and AVC almost exclusively since the format's introduction. [[Warner Bros. Pictures|Warner Bros.]], which used to release movies in both formats prior to June 1, 2007, often used the same encode (with VC-1 codec) for both Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD, with identical results.  In contrast, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] used different encodings: initially MPEG-2 for early Blu-ray Disc releases, VC-1 for early HD DVD releases, and eventually AVC for both formats.

Whilst the two formats support similar audio codecs, their usage varies. Most titles released on the Blu-ray format include [[Dolby Digital]] tracks for each language in the region, a [[DTS-HD Master Audio]] track for all [[20th Century Fox]] and [[Sony Pictures]] and many upcoming Universal titles, [[Dolby TrueHD]] for Disney and Sony Pictures and some Paramount and Warner titles, and for many Blu-ray titles a [[Pulse-code modulation|Linear PCM]] track for the primary language.&lt;ref name="Blu-rayStats"/&gt; On the other hand, most titles released on the HD DVD format include [[Dolby Digital Plus]] tracks for each language in the region, and some also include a [[Dolby TrueHD]] track for the primary language.

===Interactivity===

Both Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD have two main options for interactivity (on-screen menus, bonus features, etc.).

HD DVD's Standard Content is a minor change from standard DVD's subpicture technology, while Blu-ray's BDMV is completely new. This makes transitioning from standard DVD to Standard Content HD DVD relatively simple {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}—for example, Apple's [[DVD Studio Pro]] has supported authoring Standard Content since version 4.0.3. {{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} For more advanced interactivity Blu-ray disc supports [[BD-J]] while HD DVD supports [[Advanced Content]].

===Disc construction===
Blu-ray Discs contain their data relatively close to the surface (less than 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm) which combined with the smaller spot size presents a problem when the surface is scratched as data would be destroyed. To overcome this, TDK, Sony, and Panasonic each have developed a proprietary scratch resistant surface coating.

HD DVD uses traditional material and has the same scratch and surface characteristics of a regular DVD. The data is at the same depth (0.6&amp;nbsp;mm) as DVD as to minimize damage from scratching. As with DVD the construction of the HD DVD allows for a second side of either HD DVD or DVD.

A study performed by Home Media Magazine (August 5, 2007) concluded that HD DVDs and Blu-ray discs are essentially equal in production cost. Quotes from several disc manufacturers for 25,000 units of HD DVDs and Blu-rays revealed a price differential of only 5-10 cents. (Lowest price: 90 cents versus 100 cents.  Highest price: $1.45 versus $1.50.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/questex/hom080507/index.php|title=Indies wait for HD - Page 1 - lists bulk prices for blank discs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study performed by Wesley Tech (February 9, 2007) arrived at a similar conclusion.  Quotes for 10,000 discs show that a 15 gigabyte HD DVD costs $11,500 total, and 25 gigabyte Blu-ray or a 30 gigabyte HD DVD costs $13,000 total.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://wesleytech.com/blu-ray-vs-hd-dvd-replication-costs-analyzed-again/113/ | title=Blu-ray vs HD DVD replication costs analyzed again - Lists 10,000-quantity prices for blank discs}}&lt;/ref&gt; For larger quantities of 100,000 units, the 30 gigabyte HD DVD was more expensive than the 25 gigabyte Blu-ray ($1.55 versus $1.49).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wesleytech.com/blu-ray-vs-hd-dvd-replication-costs-revealed/111/|title=Blu-ray replication vs HD DVD replication costs revealed - Lists 100,000-quantity prices for blank discs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hybrid discs===
At the [[Consumer Electronics Show]], on {{start date and age|2007|1|4|df=y|paren=y}}, [[Warner Bros.]] introduced a hybrid technology, [[Total Hi Def|Total HD]], which would reportedly support both formats on a single disc. The new discs were to overlay the Blu-ray and HD DVD layers, placing them respectively {{convert|0.1|mm|um}} and {{convert|0.5|mm|um}} beneath the surface. The Blu-ray top layer would act as a two-way mirror, reflecting just enough light for a Blu-ray reader to read and an HD DVD player to ignore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Later that year, however, in September 2007, Warner President Ron Sanders said that the technology was on hold due to Warner being the only company who would publish on it.&lt;ref name="Twice2007"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Warner Remains Loyal To Dual HD Formats| work = TWICE| date = 2007-09-12| url = http://www.twice.com/article/CA6477849.html| accessdate = 2008-04-25| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012191226/http://twice.com/article/CA6477849.html| archivedate = 2007-10-12| author = Tarr, Greg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One year after the original announcement, on 4 January 2008, Warner Bros. stated that it would support the Blu-ray format exclusively beginning on 1 June 2008, which, along with the demise of HD DVD the following month, ended development of hybrid discs permanently.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

===Region coding===
{{Main|Blu-ray Disc#Region_codes|l1=Blu-ray Disc - Region codes}}
The Blu-ray specification and all currently available players support region coding. As of July 2008 about 66.7% of Blu-ray Disc titles are region-free and 33.3% use region codes.&lt;ref name="Blu-rayStats"/&gt;

The HD DVD specification had no region coding, so a HD DVD from anywhere in the world will work in any player. The DVD Forum's steering committee discussed a request from Disney to add it, but many of the 20 companies on the committee actively opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.tech.co.uk/home-entertainment/video/dvd-hdd-players-and-receivers/blu-ray-and-hd-dvd/features/microsoft-why-hd-dvd-can-beat-blu-ray | title = Microsoft: why HD DVD can beat Blu-ray |date=2007-04-03 | accessdate = 2007-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some film titles that were exclusive to Blu-ray in the United States such as Sony's ''[[xXx (film)|xXx]]'', Fox's ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]'' and ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'', were released on HD DVD in other countries due to different distribution agreements; for example, ''The Prestige'' was released outside the U.S. by once format-neutral studio [[Warner Bros.]] Pictures. Since HD DVDs had no region coding, there are no restrictions playing foreign-bought HD DVDs in an HD DVD player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119267051987662923?mod=googlenews_wsj | title = Blu-ray vs. HD DVD: a Solution Abroad | work = Wall Street Journal online | author = Sarah McBride |date=2007-10-18 | accessdate = 2007-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This article presents a number of methodologies that have been suggested for the task of comparing the greatest [[chess player]]s in history. Statistical methods offer objectivity but, while there is agreement on systems to rate the strengths of current players, there is disagreement on whether such techniques can be applied to players from different generations who never competed against each other.

==Statistical methods==

===Elo system===
{{main|Elo rating system|List of chess players by peak FIDE rating}}
Perhaps the best-known statistical model is that devised by [[Arpad Elo]] in 1960 and further elaborated on in his 1978 book ''The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present''.&lt;ref&gt;Arpad E. Elo, ''The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present'', Arco, 1978. {{ISBN|0-668-04721-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave ratings to players corresponding to their performance over the best five-year span of their career. According to this system the highest ratings achieved were:

* 2725: [[José Raúl Capablanca]]
* 2720: [[Mikhail Botvinnik]], [[Emanuel Lasker]]
* 2700: [[Mikhail Tal]]
* 2690: [[Alexander Alekhine]], [[Paul Morphy]], [[Vasily Smyslov]].

(Though published in 1978, Elo's list did not include five-year averages for [[Bobby Fischer]] and [[Anatoly Karpov]]. It did list January 1978 ratings of 2780 for Fischer and 2725 for Karpov.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=1160 Arpad Emre Elo – 100th anniversary], ''Chessbase'', 2003&lt;/ref&gt;)

In 1970, [[FIDE]] adopted Elo's system for rating current players, so one way to compare players of different eras is to compare their Elo ratings. The best-ever Elo ratings are tabulated below.&lt;ref&gt;This table is based on one created by Przemek Jahr of Poland, which was reported in [http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2489 Chessbase 2-7-2005]. FIDE ratings were officially compiled and released quarterly, in January, April, July, and October until July 2009. Starting in July 2009 they were released every two-monthly basis, and since July 2012 FIDE publishes its ratings monthly.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2015,&lt;!-- (FIDE Rating List released on 2015-12-02) --&gt; there were 101 chess players in history who broke 2700 and nine of them exceeded 2800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pogonina.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=810|title=Highest-Rated Chess Players of All Time|author=Administrator|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess-db.com/public/top100alltime.jsp|title=All time Top 100 by Highest Elo Rating|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://2700chess.com/files/highest300.png Highest "Live ratings" of All Time]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2700chess.com|title=Live Chess Ratings – 2700chess.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Live Elo" covers rating achieved after every single chess game played, what constitutes live performance of players in between of FIDE's regular monthly rating lists.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly notable are the peak ratings of Fischer, Karpov and [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]], who achieved their peak ratings in earlier years (1972, 1994, and 1999 respectively).

=== Average rating over time ===
The average Elo rating of top players has risen over time. For instance, the average of the top 10 active players rose from 2751&lt;!-- (27509/10=2750,9) --&gt; in July 2000 to 2794&lt;!-- (27939/10=2793,9) --&gt; in July 2014, a 43-point increase in 14 years. The average rating of the top 100 players, meanwhile, increased from 2644&lt;!-- (264355/100=2643,55)--&gt;  to 2703&lt;!-- (270303/100=2703,03) --&gt;, a 59-point increase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ratings.fide.com/toplist.phtml?list=men World Top chess players and Statistics] at FIDE.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many people believe that this rise is mostly due to a system artifact known as [[ELO rating system#Ratings inflation and deflation|ratings inflation]], making it impractical to compare players of different eras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=5608 |title=ChessBase News &amp;#124; Rating inflation – its causes and possible cures |publisher=Chessbase.com |date=2009-07-27 |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arpad Elo was of the opinion that it was futile to attempt to use ratings to compare players from different eras; in his view, they could only possibly measure the strength of a player as compared to his or her contemporaries. He also stated that the process of rating players was in any case rather approximate; he compared it to "the measurement of the position of a cork bobbing up and down on the surface of agitated water with a yard stick tied to a rope and which is swaying in the wind".&lt;ref&gt;''Chess Life'', 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chessmetrics===
{{Further|Chessmetrics}}
Many statisticians besides Elo have devised similar methods to retrospectively rate players. Jeff Sonas' rating system is called "Chessmetrics". This system takes account of many games played after the publication of Elo's book, and claims to take account of the rating inflation that the Elo system has allegedly suffered.

One caveat is that a Chessmetrics rating takes into account the frequency of play. According to Sonas, "As soon as you go a month without playing, your Chessmetrics rating will start to drop."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=2345 The Greatest Chess Player of All Time – Part I], Jeff Sonas, at [[Chessbase]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonas, like Elo, claims that it is impossible to compare the strength of players from different eras, saying:

{{quote|text=Of course, a rating always indicates the level of dominance of a particular player against contemporary peers; it says nothing about whether the player is stronger/weaker in their actual technical chess skill than a player far removed from them in time. So while we cannot say that Bobby Fischer in the early 1970s or José Capablanca in the early 1920s were the "strongest" players of all time, we can say with a certain amount of confidence that they were the two most dominant players of all time. That is the extent of what these ratings can tell us.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chessmetrics.com/cm/Documents/AboutSystem.htm About the Chessmetrics Rating System] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515101645/http://chessmetrics.com/cm/Documents/AboutSystem.htm |date=15 May 2012 }}, by Jeff Sonas&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, Sonas' website does compare players from different eras. Including data until December 2004, the ratings were:

===''Warriors of the Mind''===
In contrast to Elo and Sonas's systems, [[Raymond Keene]] and [[Nathan Divinsky]]'s book ''Warriors of the Mind''&lt;ref&gt;''Warriors of the Mind'', [[Raymond Keene]] and [[Nathan Divinsky]], (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to establish a rating system claiming to compare directly the strength of players active in different eras, and so determine the strongest player of all time. Considering games played between sixty-four of the strongest players in history, they came up with the following top ten:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess.eusa.ed.ac.uk/Chess/Trivia/AlltimeList.html |title=Divinsky-Keene rankings |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126000035/http://chess.eusa.ed.ac.uk/Chess/Trivia/AlltimeList.html |archivedate=26 November 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These "Divinsky numbers" are not on the same scale as Elo ratings (the last person on the list, [[Johannes Zukertort]], has a Divinsky number of 873, which would be a beginner-level Elo rating). Keene and Divinsky's system has met with limited acceptance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Oxford Companion to Chess|author1=Hooper, David |author2=Whyld, Kenneth |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1992|isbn=0-19-280049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Warriors of the Mind'' has been accused of arbitrarily selecting players and bias towards modern players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chess Explorations|author=Winter, Edward|publisher=Cadogan|year=1996|isbn=1-85744-171-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moves played compared with computer choices ==
===Matej Guid and Ivan Bratko===
A computer-based method of analyzing chess abilities across history came from Matej Guid and [[Ivan Bratko (computer scientist)|Ivan Bratko]] from the Department of Computer and Information Science of [[University of Ljubljana]], Slovenia, in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3455 Computers choose: who was the strongest player?], ''Chessbase'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The basis for their evaluation was the difference between the position values resulting from the moves played by the human chess player and the moves chosen as best by the chess program [[Crafty]]. They compared the average number of errors in the player's game. Opening moves were excluded, in an attempt to negate the progress in [[chess opening]] theory.

The method received a number of criticisms, including: the study used a modified version of Crafty rather than the standard version; even the standard version of Crafty was not strong enough to evaluate the world champions' play; one of the modifications restricted the search depth to 12 half-moves, which is often insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3465 Review of "Computer Analysis of World Chess Champions"], by Søren Riis, ''Chessbase'', 2006&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2006 Crafty's Elo rating was 2657, below many historical top human players and several other computer programs.

A study by online chess data provider Chess-DB, based on an analysis of over 50,000 chess games, claims that the "strength" of a player, as determined by the method of Matej Guid and Ivan Bratko, correlates with the Elo rating strength of modern players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chess-db.com/public/research/qualityofplay.html Chess Play Quality Index], ''Chess-db.com'', 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rybka===
A similar project was conducted for World Champions in 2007–08 using [[Rybka]] 2.3.2a (then-strongest chess program) and a modified version of Crafty 20.14.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truechess.com/web/champs.html "Compare the World Champions!"], by Charles Sullivan, ''TrueChess'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It arrived at the following results:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truechess.com/web/champs.html |title=by Charles Sullivan |publisher=Truechess.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truechess.com/web/champsdraws.html |title=by Charles Sullivan |publisher=Truechess.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 analysis, using Rybka 3, showed that Capablanca had the smallest average error factor (i.e. the most accurate play); but after adjusting for factors such as the complexity of positions, the best player came out as Fischer, followed by Capablanca, Karpov and Kramnik. The best players had an average error of about 0.07 pawns per move (after the opening). Capablanca was the most positional player, and Anand by far the most tactical. The most complex game tested was Fischer v Spassky (1972 game 6, Fischer won) while the most accurately played game was Tal v [[Pal Benko|Benko]] (1958, Tal won).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/132380754/Chess-Player-Analysis-by-Rybka-3-14ply&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CAPS ===
CAPS (Computer Aggregated Precision Score) is a system created by [[Chess.com]] that compares players from different eras by finding the percentage of moves that matches that of a chess engine. A score is then assigned based on percentage of matches and move value (for example, if the move was not the best, but still good, points are awarded). CAPS ignores both style and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chess.com/article/view/better-than-ratings-chess-com-s-new-caps-system|title=Better Than Ratings? Chess.com's New 'CAPS' System|last=(DanielRensch)|first=Daniel Rensch|website=Chess.com|date=2016-10-24|access-date=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the system, Carlsen was the best player ever, with a CAPS score of 98.36 and a top engine match of 85.26%. He was followed closely by Kramnik, and then Kasparov.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chess.com/article/view/who-was-the-best-world-chess-champion-in-history|title=Who Was The Best World Chess Champion In History?|last=(DanielRensch)|first=Daniel Rensch|website=Chess.com|date=2017-01-03|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Markovian Model ===
In an article &lt;ref&gt;[http://content.iospress.com/articles/icga-journal/icg0012 Who is the master?], ''ICGA Journal, 39–1'', April 2017&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[ICGA Journal]], [[Jean-Marc Alliot]] of the Toulouse Computer Science Research Institute ([http://www.irit.fr/ IRIT]) presents a new method, based on a Markovian interpretation of a chess game. Starting with those of [[Wilhelm Steinitz]], all 26,000 games played since then by chess world champions have been processed by a supercomputer using [[Stockfish (chess)|Stockfish]] (rated between 3310 ELO at the [[CCRL]] and 3337 at the [[Swedish Chess Computer Association|SSDF]] as of 10/2015, but around 3150 under the test condition according to the authors)&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.iospress.com/articles/icga-journal/icg0012 Who is the master?], ''ICGA Journal, 39–1'', April 2017 (2.1 Evaluation of the ELO strength of the program used)&lt;/ref&gt; in 62000 CPU hours, in order to create a probabilistic model for each player. For each position, the model estimates the probability of making a mistake, and the magnitude of the mistake by comparing the two best moves calculated at an average of 2 minutes by move (26 plies on the average) with the move actually played, &lt;ref&gt;[http://content.iospress.com/articles/icga-journal/icg0012 Who is the master?], ''ICGA Journal, 39–1'', April 2017 (1 Introduction)&lt;/ref&gt; starting from move number 10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.iospress.com/articles/icga-journal/icg0012 Who is the master?], ''ICGA Journal, 39–1'', April 2017 (2.3The experimental settings)&lt;/ref&gt;  These models can then be used to compute the win/draw/lose probability for any given match between two players. The predictions have proven not only to be extremely close to the actual results when players have played concrete games against one another, they also fare better than those based on ELO scores. The results demonstrate that the level of chess players has been steadily increasing. Magnus Carlsen (in 2013), tops the list, while Vladimir Kramnik (in 1999) is second, Bobby Fischer (in 1971) is third, and Garry Kasparov (in 2001) is fourth. 

The complete results are as follows (each player taken in his best year,
Carlsen: 2013, Kramnik: 1999, Fischer: 1971, Kasparov: 2001, Anand: 2008, Khalifman: 2010, Smyslov: 1983, Petrosian: 1962, Karpov: 1988, Kasimdzhanov: 2011, Botvinnik: 1945, Ponomariov: 2011, Lasker: 1907, Spassky: 1970, Topalov: 2008, Capablanca: 1928, Euwe: 1941, Tal: 1981, Alekhine: 1922, Steinitz: 1894). The numbers represent the winning percentage of one player against his opponent. Tables are not symmetric as playing with white and with black is not the same.

==Subjective lists==
Many prominent players and chess writers have offered their own rankings of players.

===Bobby Fischer (1964 and 1970)===
In 1964, [[Bobby Fischer]] listed his top 10 in ''Chessworld'' magazine: [[Paul Morphy|Morphy]], [[Howard Staunton|Staunton]], [[Wilhelm Steinitz|Steinitz]], [[Siegbert Tarrasch|Tarrasch]], [[Mikhail Chigorin|Chigorin]], [[Alexander Alekhine|Alekhine]], [[José Raúl Capablanca|Capablanca]], [[Boris Spassky|Spassky]], [[Mikhail Tal|Tal]], [[Samuel Reshevsky|Reshevsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Bobby Fischer, "The Ten Greatest Masters in History", ''Chessworld'', Vol. 1, No. 1 (Jan.-Feb. 1964), pp. 56–61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chess.eusa.ed.ac.uk/Chess/Trivia/Fishers10.html|title=Fischer's Top 10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206215606/http://chess.eusa.ed.ac.uk/Chess/Trivia/Fishers10.html|archivedate=6 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He considered Morphy to be "perhaps the most accurate", writing: "In a set match he would beat anyone alive today."&lt;ref&gt;''the Even More Complete Chess Addict'', by Mike Fox and Richard James, 1993, pp. 129–30&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Fischer named Morphy, Steinitz, Capablanca, Botvinnik, Petrosian, Tal, Spassky, Reshevsky, [[Svetozar Gligorić]] and [[Bent Larsen]] the greatest chess players in history.&lt;ref&gt;''CHESS magazine'', November 1970, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irving Chernev (1974)===
In 1974, popular chess author [[Irving Chernev]] published an article titled ''Who were the greatest?'' in the English magazine CHESS.&lt;ref&gt;''CHESS'' magazine, April 1974, pp. 201–202&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this up with his 1976 book ''The Golden Dozen'', in which he ranked his all-time top twelve: 1. [[José Raúl Capablanca|Capablanca]], 2. [[Alexander Alekhine|Alekhine]], 3. [[Emanuel Lasker|Lasker]], 4. [[Bobby Fischer|Fischer]], 5. [[Mikhail Botvinnik|Botvinnik]], 6. [[Tigran Petrosian|Petrosian]], 7. [[Mikhail Tal|Tal]], 8. [[Vasily Smyslov|Smyslov]], 9. [[Boris Spassky|Spassky]], 10. [[David Bronstein|Bronstein]], 11. [[Akiba Rubinstein|Rubinstein]], and 12. [[Aron Nimzowitsch|Nimzowitsch]].&lt;ref&gt;''Twelve Great Chess Players and Their Best Games'', Irving Chernev, 1995 (reprint of 1976 edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miguel Quinteros (1992)===
In a 1992 interview GM [[Miguel Quinteros]] gave the opinion:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Viswanathan Anand (2000, 2008 and 2012) ===
In 2000, when Karpov, Korchnoi and Kasparov were still active, [[Viswanathan Anand|Anand]] listed his top 10 as: [[Bobby Fischer|Fischer]], [[Paul Morphy|Morphy]], [[Emanuel Lasker|Lasker]], [[José Raúl Capablanca|Capablanca]], [[Wilhelm Steinitz|Steinitz]], [[Mikhail Tal|Tal]], [[Viktor Korchnoi|Korchnoi]], [[Paul Keres|Keres]], [[Anatoly Karpov|Karpov]] and [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://in.rediff.com/millenni/anand.htm The Grandmaster on his ten greatest chess players] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031120152003/http://in.rediff.com/millenni/anand.htm |date=20 November 2003 }}, [[Viswanathan Anand]], rediff.com&lt;/ref&gt;

When interviewed in 2008 shortly after Fischer's death, he ranked Fischer and Kasparov as the greatest, with Kasparov a little ahead by virtue of being on top for so many years.&lt;ref&gt;"''He (Fischer) and Kasparov were the greatest in history, but I judge Kasparov as a little ahead. Fischer was a phenomenon from 1970 to 1972 while Kasparov was on top for many years.''" – [http://www.chessbase.com/newsprint.asp?newsid=4450 Morelia-Linares Super-GM starts today] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206172430/http://www.chessbase.com/newsprint.asp?newsid=4450 |date=6 February 2009 }}, [[Chessbase]], 15 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Anand stated that he considered Fischer the best player and also the greatest, because of the hurdles he faced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/article3486974.ece Anand takes a dig at Kasparov], [[Viswanathan Anand]], The Hindu&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Chess Informant'' readers (2001)===
[[Svetozar Gligorić]] reported in his book ''Shall We Play Fischerandom Chess?''  (Batsford, 2002):&lt;blockquote&gt;At the beginning of 2001 a large poll for the "Ten Greatest Chess Players of the 20th Century, selected by ''[[Chess Informant]]'' readers" resulted in Fischer having the highest percentage of votes and finishing as No. 1, ahead of Kasparov, Alekhine, Capablanca, Botvinnik, Karpov, Tal, Lasker, Anand and Korchnoi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gligorić| first=Svetozar| authorlink=Svetozar Gligorić

===David Edmonds and John Eidinow (2004)===
BBC award-winning journalists, from their book ''Bobby Fischer Goes to War: How the Soviets Lost the Most Extraordinary Chess Match of All Time''  (HarperCollins, 2004): &lt;blockquote&gt;Fischer, some will maintain, was ''the'' outstanding player in chess history, though there are powerful advocates too for Lasker, Capablanca, Alekhine, and Kasparov. Many chess players will dismiss such comparisons as meaningless, akin to the futile attempt to grade the supreme musicians of all time. But the manner in which Fischer stormed his way to Reykjavik, his breathtaking dominance at the Palma de Majorca Interzonal, the trouncings of Taimanov, Larsen, and Petrosian—all this was unprecedented. There never has been an era in modern chess during which one player has so overshadowed all others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Vladimir Kramnik (2005 and 2011) ===
In a 2005 interview, [[Vladimir Kramnik]] (World Champion from 2000 to 2007) did not name a greatest player, but stated, "The other world champions had something 'missing'. I can't say the same about Kasparov: he can do everything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kramnik.com/eng/interviews/getinterview.aspx?id=61 |title=The most important interviews by GM Vladimir Kramnik, World Chess Champion 2000–2007 |publisher=Kramnik.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview in 2011, Vladimir Kramnik said about [[Viswanathan Anand|Anand]]: "I always considered him to be a colossal talent, one of the greatest in the whole history of chess", "I think that in terms of play Anand is in no way weaker than [[Garry Kasparov|Kasparov]]",  and "In the last 5–6 years he's made a qualitative leap that's made it possible to consider him one of the great chess players".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whychess.org/node/1605 |title=Vladimir Kramnik on Chess, Anand, Topalov, and his future | date=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leonard Barden (2008)===
In his 2008 obituary of Bobby Fischer, [[Leonard Barden]] wrote that most experts ranked Kasparov as the best ever player, with probably Fischer second and Karpov third.&lt;ref&gt;"''Most experts place him (Fischer) the second or third best ever, behind Kasparov but probably ahead of Karpov.''" – [https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,2243266,00.html Obituary of Bobby Fischer], [[Leonard Barden]], [[The Guardian]], 19 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Levon Aronian (2012 and 2015) ===
In a 2012 interview, [[Levon Aronian]] stated that he considers [[Alexander Alekhine]] the best player of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whychess.com/en/node/2836 |title=Aronian names Alekhine best player of all time |publisher=WhyChess |date=2012-08-22 |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2015 interview after the 8th round of the [[Sinquefield Cup]], Levon Aronian stated that he considers Garry Kasparov the strongest player of all time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGdywyQlo2E ''"Well, in my opinion Garry is the strongest player of all time"''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magnus Carlsen (2012 and 2015) ===
In 2012, [[Magnus Carlsen]] said that Kasparov is the greatest player of all time, adding that while Fischer may have been better at his best, Kasparov remained at the top for much longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/sport/artikkel.php?artid=10060899 |title=Magnus Carlsen: – Jeg tar verdensrekorden – VG Nett om Sjakk |publisher=Vg.no |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, he repeated his great respect for both Fischer and Kasparov when he mentioned them several times in an interview, saying he would like to play against them at their peak performance. Also, he said he liked the style of play and games of [[Vladimir Kramnik]]. As the toughest opponent to beat at that time he named [[Levon Aronian]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/16/sport/magnus-carlsen-chess-world-number-one/ Chess prodigy Magnus Carlsen: 'Bobby Fischer is my dream opponent'.], 2015-12-16, [[CNN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Deathtrap''''' is a 1982 American [[Thriller (genre)|thriller film]] based on [[Ira Levin]]'s [[Deathtrap (play)|play of the same name]], directed by [[Sidney Lumet]] from a screenplay by Levin and [[Jay Presson Allen]], starring [[Michael Caine]], [[Dyan Cannon]] and [[Christopher Reeve]].  Critics gave the film mostly favorable reviews while noting its plot similarities to Caine's 1972 film ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]''.&lt;ref name=Ebert&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Roger Ebert|author=Ebert, Roger|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/deathtrap-1982|title=Deathtrap|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=January 1, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Janet Maslin|author=Maslin, Janet|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/03/19/movies/film-deathtrap-with-michael-caine.html|title=FILM: 'DEATHTRAP' WITH MICHAEL CAINE|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 19, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Deathtrap review"&gt;{{cite web|author=Arnold, Gary|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26668-2004Oct12.html|title=A Winning 'Deathtrap'|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=March 18, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Famed playwright Sidney Bruhl debuts the latest in a series of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] flops and returns to his opulent [[Long Island]] home and his wife Myra. Although their financial situation is not dire, Sidney is starving for a hit. He receives a manuscript of a play called ''Deathtrap'', written by one of his students, Clifford Anderson, that he considers to be near-perfection. Clifford recently attended one of Sidney's writing workshops and is now asking for input on his play. Sidney tells Myra that the best idea he has had lately is to murder Clifford and produce the play as his own. Myra realizes that's he's not just talking idly.

Sidney invites Clifford to their secluded home, decorated with weapons from his plays, to discuss Clifford's play. Clifford arrives by train. Over the course of an evening, Myra tries desperately to convince Sidney to work with Clifford as equal partners but to no avail. Sidney then attacks Clifford and strangles him with a chain. Sidney removes the body but still has to convince Myra to conspire with him. She reveals nothing when they receive an unexpected visit from the [[psychic]] Helga Ten Dorp, a minor celebrity staying with the Bruhls' neighbors. Helga senses pain and death in the house. Before she leaves, she warns Sidney about a man in boots who will attack him.

As Myra prepares for bed, she begins to come to terms with what Sidney has done. She heads downstairs for a drink but a sound spooks her and she flees back upstairs, suspecting an intruder. Sidney takes her back downstairs to prove that all is well and they return to the bedroom. The calm is broken when Clifford bursts through the bedroom window and beats Sidney with a log. Clifford chases Myra through the house until her weak heart gives out and she collapses and dies.

Sidney calmly descends the stairs, uninjured, and joins Clifford. They exchange a few words about what to do with Myra's body, then exchange a passionate kiss. The previous few hours are revealed to be an elaborate ruse to kill Myra. Clifford moves in with Sidney and the two work together at a [[partner's desk]]. Sidney suffers from writer's block but Clifford busily types page after page of a new play that he suspiciously keeps under lock and key. While Clifford is out grocery shopping, Sidney tries to break into the drawer but fails to before Clifford returns home. He waits for Clifford to retrieve his play, then switches Clifford's manuscript with a fake.

Sidney is horrified to read that Clifford is using the true story of Myra's murder as the basis of a new play called ''Deathtrap''. He angrily confronts Clifford, who boasts about the play's potential and insists he will write it with or without Sidney's approval. Clifford offers to share the credit with Sidney, who comes to believe that Clifford is a [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]. Sidney plays along with the collaboration on ''Deathtrap'' while he plots a solution. A few days later, Helga stops by, ostensibly for candles in anticipation of a predicted thunderstorm. Almost immediately after meeting Clifford, she warns Sidney that Clifford is the man in boots.

Sidney asks Clifford to arm himself with an axe to demonstrate a bit of stage business, then produces a gun. He intends to shoot Clifford, claim it was in self-defense and dispose of the ''Deathtrap'' manuscript. But Sidney finds his gun to be empty. Clifford had anticipated some such scheme from him and has loaded the bullets into a different gun. Clifford now intends to use Sidney's attempted betrayal-and-axe scheme in the play. He secures Sidney to a chair with manacles and tells him he is going to pack up and leave. He warns Sidney to not try to stop the production of the play.

However, Clifford is unaware the manacles are trick shackles, once the property of [[Harry Houdini]]. Sidney easily releases himself, grabs a [[crossbow]] and incapacitates Clifford with a single [[Quarrel (projectile)|shot]]. Before Sidney can dispose of the body, the storm hits with full force and plunges the scene into darkness. A flash of lightning illuminates the living room and a fleeting figure scurries through. It is Helga, thinking Sidney is in danger and coming to help.

She realizes that Sidney actually poses the threat and grabs a gun while Sidney finds a knife. Clifford regains consciousness and trips Helga. The gun goes flying and a struggle for it ensues. Clifford stumbles to his feet, grabs the axe and swings it at Sidney. In that moment, the scene transitions to a stage version of itself, with actors before a full house. The on-stage struggle culminates with "Clifford" stabbing "Sidney" and both dying, leaving "Helga" victorious. The opening night audience erupts in thunderous applause, and at the back of the theatre stands an exultant Helga Ten Dorp, now the author of a hit Broadway play called ''Deathtrap''.

== Reception ==
''Deathtrap'' has an aggregate rating of 80% at [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 15 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/deathtrap/ Deathtrap entry], Rotten Tomatoes. Accessed Jan. 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave it three stars, calling it "a comic study of ancient and honorable human defects, including greed, envy, lust, pride, avarice, sloth, and falsehood."&lt;ref name=Ebert /&gt; Ebert, along with [[Janet Maslin]], and Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' noted the similarities to Caine's 1972 film ''[[Sleuth (1972 film)|Sleuth]]'',&lt;ref name="Ebert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deathtrap review"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; and similarities have subsequently been noted by film historians.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Marvin. [https://books.google.com/books?id=6xSvKdGpwr8C&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q=sleuth%20deathtrap "Deathtraps: The Postmodern Comedy Thriller"] p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dick, Bernard.

Cannon was nominated for a [[1982 Golden Raspberry Awards|Golden Raspberry Award]] for "Worst Supporting Actress" for her performance.  ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' parodied the film as ''Deathcrap''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mad'' #234 (Oct. 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;

The kissing scene between Sidney and Clifford is not in the original play (although they are revealed to be lovers). In his book ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'', [[gay]] film historian [[Vito Russo]] reports that Reeve said that the kiss was booed by preview audiences in [[Denver, Colorado]], and estimated that a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine report of the kiss spoiled a key plot element and cost the film $10 million in ticket sales.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} (The film earned more than $19 million at the box office.)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083806/business "Box office/business for ''Deathtrap'',"] IMDb.com. Accessed Jan. 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Murder Most Queer'' (2014), Jordan Schildcrout describes attending a screening at which an audience member screamed, "No, Superman, don't do it!" at the moment of the Caine-Reeve kiss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schildcrout|first1=Jordan|title=Murder Most Queer: The Homicidal Homosexual in the American Theater|date=2014|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472072323|page=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy over the kiss inspired the [[Tom Smith (filker)|Tom Smith]] song "Two Guys Kissin' (Ruined My Life)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Tomsmithonline.com|title=Two Guys Kissin' (Ruined My Life)|url=http://www.tomsmithonline.com/lyrics/two_guys_kissin.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Equestrian Statue of Theodore Roosevelt''''' is a [[bronze sculpture]] by [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=13070LH9B1624.10747&amp;menu=search&amp;aspect=Keyword&amp;npp=50&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;profile=ariall&amp;ri=1&amp;source=%7E%21siartinventories&amp;index=.TW&amp;term=equestrian+of+theodore+roosevelt&amp;aspect=Keyword#focus "Equestrian Statue of Theodore Roosevelt, (sculpture)"]. ''SIRIS''&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at the [[American Museum of Natural History]], [[New York City]]. The [[equestrian statue]] depicts [[Theodore Roosevelt]] on horseback. Standing to either side of him are an American Indian and an African.

==History==
[[File:Theodore Roosevelt - New York - USA - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Seen from the front]]
It was dedicated on October 27, 1940. Cast by Gorham Manufacturing Company, Providence, RI.

The inscription reads:&lt;br&gt;
(On rear of sculpture:) &lt;br&gt;
J E FRASER SC 1939 &lt;br&gt;
(On front of base:) &lt;br&gt;
THEODORE ROOSEVELT&lt;br&gt;
1858-1919&lt;br&gt; 
(On left side of base:)&lt;br&gt; 
GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK&lt;br&gt;
1899 1901 &lt;br&gt;
(On right side of base:)&lt;br&gt; 
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;br&gt;
1901 1909 signed

==Commission==
The sculpture was commissioned by the [[Theodore Roosevelt Association|Roosevelt Memorial Association]] in the 1930s after Fraser had delivered his design for the [[Arts of Peace]] memorial in Washington D.C., which at the time was also in competition with this memorial as the chosen location. For ''Arts of Peace'', Fraser made a pair of statues of [[Pegasus]] depicting the themes ''Music and Harvest'', and ''Aspiration and Literature''. This equestrian monument should therefore be seen in that context, with Roosevelt mounted on Pegasus, though in fact he is ''in the garb of a hunter accompanied by two pedestrian guides representing America and Africa''.&lt;ref name=HETH&gt;[https://oaktrust.library.tamu.edu/bitstream/handle/1969.1/153983/HETH-DISSERTATION-2014.pdf Imagining TR: Commemorations and Representations of Theodore Roosevelt in Twentieth-Century America], 2014 dissertation by Jennifer Dawn Heth on [[Texas A&amp;M University]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Dead frontal view - Aspiration and Literature - Arts of Peace - Lincoln Memorial Circle - Washington DC - 2013-09-30.jpg|''Arts of Peace'' memorial: ''Aspiration and Literature''
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Oddly that earlier design was executed more than a decade after this one was built in 1940, partly because of the failure of efforts to have a Roosevelt memorial placed in D.C. A compromise was reached in dedicating [[Theodore Roosevelt Island]] in the [[Potomac river]] in 1932 ''within view of the Lincoln Memorial, the Washington Monument, the Capitol and the White House'', and the memorial location was thereafter sought elsewhere.&lt;ref name=HETH/&gt;

==Entrance to Akeley Hall of African Mammals==
The statue is placed at the entrance to the hall of [[diorama]]s dedicated to [[Carl Akeley]] who had accompanied Roosevelt on a year-long expedition to Africa. 
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:USA-NYC-American Museum of Natural History.JPG|The monument as part of the neo-classical museum entrance desgned by Bacon
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The work was designed to fit in the neo-classical plans of [[Henry Bacon]] to house this hall. An earlier monument by Fraser dedicated to Roosevelt in Cuba in 1924 was also designed with Henry Bacon, and they both attended its dedication in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lccn.loc.gov/mp76000379 Dedication of Cuban Memorial, 1924. [No. 2] / [Roosevelt Memorial Association]. [United States : s.n., 1924?] United States.] in the Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;

The Akeley Hall of African Mammals features in the movie ''[[Night at the Museum]]'', with [[Robin Williams]] in the role of Teddy Roosevelt who comes alive from his perch atop a horse in one of the dioramas rather than from the statue outside.

==Subject of controversy==

In 1999 [[James Loewen]] argued in ''Lies Across America'' that the statue was erected when the museum was openly racist, and that the arrangement of the figures is meant to advocate white supremacy.&lt;ref name="Lies Across America"&gt;{{cite book|last=Loewen|first=James|title=Lie Across America: What Our Historic Sites Get Wrong|year=1999|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=1-56584-344-4|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Loewen's and others' remarks about the statue, this equestrian statue was never the subject of public controversy in the 20th century. It was mentioned in the April 2017 [[TED talk]] ''Can Art Amend History?'' by artist and activist [[Titus Kaphar]], discussing the choice of pose showing that ''"Teddy Roosevelt is sitting there ...and on the left-hand side of him is a Native American walking and on the right-hand side of him is an African-American walking"'' as a representation of white social hierarchy in America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ted.com/speakers/titus_kaphar Titus Kaphar] on [[TED (conference)|TED]] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2017/11/10/562836477/titus-kaphar-how-can-we-address-centuries-of-racism-in-art Interview of Kaphar] on [[NPR]], which may have been recorded earlier and doesn't mention the vandalism&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Unite the Right rally]] due to the controversial removal of an equestrian statue of Robert E. Lee, this and many other equestrian statues across America also became the focus of attempts to clean up America's "racist past". This statue was defaced with red paint on the morning of October 26, 2017. A few hours later, a group claiming responsibility for the defilement stated that the statue embodied “patriarchy, white supremacy, and settler-colonialism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Gutenberg Bible''}}
[[File:Gutenberg Bible, Lenox Copy, New York Public Library, 2009. Pic 01.jpg|thumb|350px|Gutenberg Bible of the [[New York Public Library]]. Bought by [[James Lenox]] in 1847, it was the first copy to be acquired by a United States citizen.]]

The '''Gutenberg Bible''' (also known as the '''42-line Bible''', the '''Mazarin Bible''' or the '''B42''') was the first major book printed using mass-produced [[movable type|movable metal type]] in Europe. It marked the start of the "[[Printing Revolution|Gutenberg Revolution]]" and the age of the printed book in the West. Widely praised for its high aesthetic and artistic qualities,&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt; the book has an iconic status. Written in Latin, the Gutenberg Bible is an edition of the [[Vulgate]], printed by [[Johannes Gutenberg]], in [[Mainz]], in present-day [[Germany]], in the 1450s. Since its publication, 49 copies (or substantial portions of copies) have survived, and they are considered to be among the most valuable books in the world, even though no complete copy has been sold since 1978.&lt;ref name="MSNBC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Luxist.com" /&gt;

In March 1455, the future [[Pope Pius II]] wrote that he had seen pages from the Gutenberg Bible, being displayed to promote the edition, in Frankfurt. It is not known how many copies were printed, with the 1455 letter citing sources for both 158 and 180 copies.

The [[36-line Bible]], believed to be the second printed version of the Bible, is also sometimes referred to as a Gutenberg Bible, but is possibly the work of another printer.

==Text==
The Gutenberg Bible, an edition of the [[Vulgate]], contains the Latin version of both the [[Hebrew Bible|Hebrew]] [[Old Testament]] and the [[Greek New Testament]]. It is mainly the work of [[Jerome]] who began his work on the translation in 380 AD, with emendations from the [[Paris Bible|Parisian Bible]] tradition, and further divergences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/textbible.html |title=The text of the Bible |author=&lt;!--staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=&lt;!--no date apparent--&gt; |website=bl.uk |publisher=[[British Library]] |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the Paris Bible, one of many [[Bible translations in the Middle Ages]], is also known as the "Thirteenth-Century Bible", "Old French Bible" or, in French, "Bible du XIIIe siècle").

The Bible was not Gutenberg's first work.&lt;ref name="Man"&gt;{{cite book |last=Man |first=John |title=Gutenberg: How One Man Remade the World with Words |publisher=John Wiley and Sons, Inc. |location=New York |isbn=0-471-21823-5 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Preparation of the Bible probably began soon after 1450, and the first finished copies were available in 1454 or 1455.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/gutenberg/html/4.html |title=The Gutenberg Bible |work=utexas.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known exactly how long the Bible took to print. The first precisely datable printing is the Gutenberg's [[31-line Indulgence]] which is known to already exist on 22 October 1454.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rXSAvawdIZIC&amp;pg=PA11 |title=Early Printed Books as Material Objects: Proceedings of the Conference Organized by the IFLA Rare Books and Manuscripts Section Munich, 19-21 August 2009 |isbn=978-3-11-025530-0 |author1=Wagner |first1=Bettina |last2=Reed |first2=Marcia |date=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gutenberg made three significant changes during the printing process.&lt;ref name="3Phases"&gt;British Library, [http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/threephases.html Three phases in the printing process] accessed 4 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The first sheets were [[rubrication|rubricated]] by being passed twice through the [[printing press]], using black and then red ink. This was soon abandoned, with spaces being left for rubrication to be added by hand.

[[File:Gutenberg Bible, Lenox Copy, New York Public Library, 2009. Pic 02.jpg|thumb|Spine of the Lenox copy]]

Some time later, after more sheets had been printed, the number of lines per page was increased from 40 to 42, presumably to save paper. Therefore, pages 1 to 9 and pages 256 to 265, presumably the first ones printed, have 40 lines each. Page 10 has 41, and from there on the 42 lines appear. The increase in line number was achieved by decreasing the [[interline spacing]], rather than increasing the printed area of the page. Finally, the print run was increased, necessitating resetting those pages which had already been printed. The new sheets were all reset to 42 lines per page. Consequently, there are two distinct settings in [[Folio (printing)|folios]] 1-32 and 129-158 of volume I and folios 1-16 and 162 of volume II.&lt;ref name="3Phases" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Library, [http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/flash4.html The differences in line lengths per page]: pictures showing differences between the Keio copy (40 lines per page) and the British Library copy (42 lines per page) in Genesis 1. Accessed 10 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The most reliable information about the Bible's date comes from a letter. In March 1455, the future [[Pope Pius II]] wrote that he had seen pages from the Gutenberg Bible, being displayed to promote the edition, in Frankfurt.&lt;ref&gt;British Library, [http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/bibleyears.html Gutenberg's life: the years of the Bible] accessed 10 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known how many copies were printed, with the 1455 letter citing sources for both 158 and 180 copies. Scholars today think that examination of surviving copies suggests that somewhere between 160 and 185 copies were printed, with about three-quarters on paper and the others on [[vellum]].&lt;ref name="Long lost"&gt;{{cite journal |author=White, Eric Marshall |year=2002 |title=Long Lost Leaves from Gutenberg's Mons-Trier II Bible |journal=Gutenberg Jahrbuch |volume=77 |pages=19–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lane Ford, Margaret |chapter=Deconstruction and Reconstruction: Detecting and Interpreting Sophisticated Copies |pages=291–304 |editor1=Wagner, Bettina |editor2=Reed, Marcia |title=Early Printed Books as Material Objects: Proceedings of the Conference Organized by the Ifla Rare Books and Manuscripts Section Munich, 19-21 August 2009 |publisher=De Gruyter Sur |year=2010 |isbn=978-3-11-025324-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some books say that about 180 copies were printed and it took about three years to produce them.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==The production process: ''Das Werk der Bücher''==
[[File:Gutenberg Bible.jpg|thumb|A [[vellum]] copy of the Gutenberg Bible owned by the U.S. [[Library of Congress]]]]

In a legal paper, written after completion of the Bible, Johannes Gutenberg refers to the process as ''Das Werk der Bücher'' (“the work of the books”). He had copied the technology of the [[printing press]] and was the first European to print with [[movable type]],&lt;ref&gt;British Library, [http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/background.html Gutenberg Bible: background] accessed 10 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but his greatest achievement was arguably demonstrating that the process of printing actually produced books.

Many book-lovers have commented on the high standards achieved in the production of the Gutenberg Bible, some describing it as one of the most beautiful books ever printed.  The quality of both the ink and other materials and the printing itself have been noted.&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Martin |title=The Gutenberg Bible |publisher=British Library |year=1996 |isbn=0-7123-0492-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pages===
[[File:Gutenberg bible Old Testament Epistle of St Jerome.jpg|thumb|left|First page of the first volume: The [[Jerome#Letters|Epistle of St. Jerome]] from the University of Texas copy. The page has 40 lines.]]
The paper size is 'double folio', with two pages printed on each side (four pages per sheet). After printing the paper was folded once to the size of a single page. Typically, five of these folded sheets (10 leaves, or 20 printed pages) were combined to a single [[Section (bookbinding)|physical section]], called a [[quinternion]], that could then be bound into a book. Some sections, however, had as few as four leaves or as many as 12 leaves.&lt;ref&gt;British Library, [http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/gatherings.html Making the Bible: the gatherings] accessed 10 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Some sections may have been printed in a larger number, especially those printed later in the publishing process, and sold unbound. The pages were not numbered. The technique was not new, since it had been used to make blank "white-paper" books to be written afterwards. What was new was determining ''beforehand'' the correct placement and orientation of each page on the five sheets to result in the correct sequence when bound. The technique for locating the printed area correctly on each page was also new.

The 42-line Bible was printed on the size of paper known as 'Royal'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Needham, 'Format and Paper Size in Fifteenth-century Printing', In: ''Materielle Aspekte in der Inkunabelforschung'', Wiesbaden, 2017, p. 59-108: p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; A full sheet of Royal paper measures 42 x 60 centimetres and a single untrimmed folio leaf measures 42 x 30 cm.&lt;ref&gt;George Gordon and William Noel, 'The Needham Calculator', 2017: http://www.needhamcalculator.net/needham_calculator1.pdf. Accessed 26 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been attempts to claim that the book was printed on larger paper measuring 30.7 x 44.5 cm,&lt;ref&gt;Man, John (2002). ''Gutenberg: How One Man Remade the World with Words'', New York: John Wiley and Sons, Inc. {{ISBN|0-471-21823-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but this assertion is contradicted by the dimensions of existing copies. For example, the leaves of the copy in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, measure 40 × 28.6 cm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://incunables.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/record/B-237. Accessed 26 August 2018.]&lt;/ref&gt; This is typical of other folio Bibles printed on Royal paper in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Needham, 'Format and Paper Size in Fifteenth-century Printing', In: ''Materielle Aspekte in der Inkunabelforschung'', Wiesbaden, 2017, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Most fifteenth-century printing papers have a width-to-height ratio of 1:1.4 (e.g. 30:42 cm) which is mathematically a ratio of 1 to the square root of 2. Man suggests that this ratio was chosen to match the so-called Golden Ratio of 1:1.6; in fact the ratios are not at all similar (a difference of about 12%). The ratio of 1:1.4 was a long established one for medieval paper sizes.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Harris, 'The Shape of Paper', subsection 'Sheet-size and the Bologna Stone', in: ''Paper and Watermarks as Bibliographical Evidence'', Lyon, Institut d'histoire du livre, 2017, http://ihl.enssib.fr/en/paper-and-watermarks-as-bibliographical-evidence.&lt;/ref&gt;
A single complete copy of the Gutenberg Bible has 1,286 pages (usually bound in two volumes); with four pages per folio-sheet, 322 sheets of paper are required per copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/gutenbergbible/facts/#top |title=Fast Facts: The Gutenberg Bible |work=utexas.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The handmade paper used by Gutenberg was of fine quality and was imported from Italy. Each sheet contains a [[watermark]] left by the paper mold.

===Ink===
In Gutenberg's time, inks used by [[scribe]]s to produce manuscripts were water-based. Gutenberg developed an oil-based ink that would better adhere to his metal type. His ink was primarily carbon, but also had a high metallic content, with copper, lead, and titanium predominating.&lt;ref&gt;British Library, [http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/ink.html Making the Bible: the ink] accessed 18 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Head of collections at the British Library, Dr Kristian Jensen, described it thus: "if you look (at the pages of The Gutenberg Bible) closely you will see this is a very shiny surface. When you write you use a water based ink, you put your pen into it and it runs off. Now if you print that's exactly what you don't want. One of Gutenberg's inventions was an ink which wasn't ink, it's a varnish. So what we call printer's ink is actually a varnish, and that means it sticks to its surface."&lt;ref&gt;BBC Radio 4 programme "Gutenberg: In the Beginning Was the Printer" first broadcast 21-10-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type===
The first part of the Gutenberg idea was using a single, hand-carved character to create identical copies of itself. Cutting a single letter could take a craftsman a day of work. A single page taking 2500 letters made this way was impractical. A less labour-intensive method of reproduction was needed. Copies were produced by stamping the original into an iron plate, called a matrix. A rectangular tube was then connected to the matrix, creating a container in which molten [[type metal]] could be poured. Once cooled, the solid metal form was released from the tube. The fundamental innovation is that this matrix can be used to produce many duplicates of the same letter. The result of each molding was a rectangular block of metal with the form of the desired character protruding from the end. This piece of type could be put in a line, facing up, with other pieces of type. These lines were arranged to form blocks of text, which could be inked and pressed against paper, transferring the desired text to the paper.

Each unique character requires a master piece of type in order to be replicated. Given that each letter has uppercase and lowercase forms, and the number of various punctuation marks and [[typographic ligature|ligatures]] (e.g. the character '[[ﬁ]]', commonly used in writing) the Gutenberg Bible needed a set of 290 master characters. It seems probable that six pages, containing 15600 characters altogether, would be set at any one moment.&lt;ref name="Man" /&gt;

===Type style===
The Gutenberg Bible is printed in the [[blackletter]] type styles that would become known as [[Textualis#Textualis|Textualis (Textura)]] and [[Schwabacher]]. The name texture refers to the texture of the printed page: straight vertical strokes combined with horizontal lines, giving the impression of a woven structure. Gutenberg already used the technique of [[Justification (typesetting)|justification]], that is, creating a vertical, not indented, alignment at the left and right-hand sides of the column. To do this, he used various methods, including using characters of narrower widths, adding extra spaces around punctuation, and varying the widths of spaces around words.&lt;ref&gt;Television presentation, "The Machine that Made Us", presenter: Stephen Fry&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.typografi.org/justering/gut_hz/gutenberg_hz_english.html |title=InDesign, the hz-program and Gutenberg's secret |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also let the punctuation marks go beyond the vertical line using [[hanging punctuation]], which was used to make the justification of the massive black characters stronger to the eye.

===Rubrication, illumination and binding===

Initially the rubrics&amp;nbsp;— the headings before each book of the Bible&amp;nbsp;— were printed, but this practice was quickly abandoned, and gaps were left for [[rubrication]] to be added by hand. A guide of the text to be added to each page, printed for use by rubricators, survives.&lt;ref name="Kapr"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kapr |first=Albert |title=Johann Gutenberg: The Man and His Invention |publisher=Scolar Press |year=1996 |isbn=1-85928-114-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spacious margin allowed [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] decoration to be added by hand. The amount of decoration presumably depended on how much each buyer could or would pay. Some copies were never decorated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/treasures/gutenberg/paperdecoration.html |title=Gutenberg Bible: The Copy on Paper – the Decoration |work=bl.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The place of decoration can be known or inferred for about 30 of the surviving copies. It is possible that 13 of these copies received their decoration in Mainz, but others were worked on as far away as London.&lt;ref name="Estes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Estes |first=Richard |title=The 550th Anniversary Pictorial Census of the Gutenberg Bible |publisher=Gutenberg Research Center |year=2005 |page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[vellum]] Bibles were more expensive, and perhaps for this reason tend to be more highly decorated, although the vellum copy in the British Library is completely undecorated.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{cite book |author=Jensen, Kristian |chapter=Printing the Bible in the fifteenth century: devotion, philology and commerce |pages=115–38 |editor=Jensen, Kristian |title=Incunabula and their readers: printing, selling and using books in the fifteenth century |publisher=British Library |year=2003 |isbn=0-7123-4769-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been speculation that the "[[Master of the Playing Cards]]," an unidentified engraver who has been called "the first personality in the history of engraving,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fifteenth Century Engravings of Northern Europe |last=Shestack |first=Alan |publisher= |year=1967 |isbn= |location=National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC |pages= |lccn=67029080 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was partly responsible for the illumination of the copy held by the [[Princeton University]] library. However, all that can be said for certain is that the same model book was used for some of the illustrations in this copy and for some of the Master's illustrated playing cards.&lt;ref name="vb"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van Buren |first1=Anne H. |last2=Edmunds |first2=Sheila |date=March 1974 |title=Playing Cards and Manuscripts: Some Widely Disseminated Fifteenth Century Model Sheets |journal=The Art Bulletin |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=12–30 |doi=10.1080/00043079.1974.10789835 |issn=0004-3079 |jstor=3049193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many Gutenberg Bibles have been rebound over the years, nine copies retain fifteenth-century [[Bookbinding|bindings]]. Most of these copies were bound in either [[Mainz]] or [[Erfurt]].&lt;ref name="Estes" /&gt; Most copies were divided into two volumes, the first volume ending with [[Psalms|The Book of Psalms]]. Copies on vellum were heavier and for this reason were sometimes bound in three or four volumes.&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;

==Early owners==
The Bible seems to have sold out immediately, with initial sales to owners as far away as England and possibly Sweden and Hungary.&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt;&lt;ref name="waste"&gt;{{cite book |author=White, Eric Marshall |chapter=The Gutenberg Bibles that Survive as Binder's Waste |pages=21–35 |editor=Wagner, Bettina |editor2=Reed, Marcia |title=Early Printed Books as Material Objects: Proceedings of the Conference Organized by the Ifla Rare Books and Manuscripts Section Munich, 19-21 August 2009 |publisher=De Gruyter Sur |year=2010 |isbn=978-3-11-025324-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least some copies are known to have sold for 30 florins – about three years' wages for a clerk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In the Beginning: The Story of the King James Bible and How It Changed a Nation, a Language, and a Culture |publisher=Anchor Books |author=McGrath, Alister |year=2001 |pages=15 |isbn=0-385-72216-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Science in Society: From Philosophy to Utility |publisher=Broadview Press |author1=Cormack, Lesley B. |author2=Ede, Andrew |year=2004 |pages=95 |isbn=1-55111-332-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this made them significantly cheaper than manuscript Bibles, most students, priests or other people of ordinary income wouldn't have been able to afford them. It is assumed that most were sold to monasteries, universities and particularly wealthy individuals.&lt;ref name="Kapr" /&gt; At present only one copy is known to have been privately owned in the fifteenth century. Some are known to have been used for communal readings in monastery refectories; others may have been for display rather than use, and a few were certainly used for study.&lt;ref name="Davies" /&gt; Kristian Jensen suggests that many copies were bought by wealthy and pious laypeople for donation to religious institutions.&lt;ref name="Jensen" /&gt;

==Influence on later Bibles==
The Gutenberg Bible had a profound effect on the history of the printed book. Textually, it also had an influence on future editions of the Bible.  It provided the model for several later editions, including the [[36 Line Bible]], [[Johannes Mentelin|Mentelin's]] Latin Bible, and the first and third [[Heinrich Eggestein|Eggestein Bibles]]. The third Eggestein Bible was set from the copy of the Gutenberg Bible now in Cambridge University Library. The Gutenberg Bible also had an influence on the [[Pope Clement VIII|Clementine]] edition of the Vulgate commissioned by the Papacy in the late sixteenth century.&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;{{cite book |author=Needham, Paul |chapter=The Changing Shape of the Vulgate Bible in Fifteenth-Century Printing Shops |pages=53–70 |editor=Saenger, Paul |editor2=Van Kampen, Kimberly |title=The Bible as Book:the First Printed Editions |publisher=British Library |year=1999 |isbn=0-7123-4601-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Needham, Paul |chapter=Copy Specifics in the Printing Shop |pages=9–20 |editor=Wagner, Bettina |editor2=Reed, Marcia |title=Early Printed Books as Material Objects: Proceedings of the Conference Organized by the Ifla Rare Books and Manuscripts Section Munich, 19-21 August 2009 |publisher=De Gruyter Sur |year=2010 |isbn=978-3-11-025324-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forgeries==
Joseph Martini, a New York book dealer, found that the Gutenberg Bible held by the library of the [[General Theological Seminary]] in New York had a forged leaf, carrying part of Chapter 14, all of Chapter 15, and part of Chapter 16 of the [[Book of Ezekiel]]. It was impossible to tell when the leaf had been inserted into the volume. It was replaced in the fall of 1953, when a patron donated the corresponding leaf from a defective Gutenberg second volume which was being broken up and sold in parts.&lt;ref name="GeneralTheologicalSeminary"&gt;St. Mark's Library (General Theological Seminary). The Gutenberg Bible of the General Theological Seminary. New York: St. Mark's Library, the General Theological Seminary, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; This made it "the first imperfect Gutenberg Bible ever restored to completeness."&lt;ref name="GeneralTheologicalSeminary" /&gt; In 1978, this copy was sold for $2.2 million USD to the [[Württembergische Landesbibliothek]] in [[Stuttgart]], Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.clausenbooks.com/gutenbergcensus.htm |title=Gutenberg Bible Census |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving copies==
[[File:Gutenberg Locator Map.png|thumbnail|Locations of known complete Gutenberg Bibles.]]

As of 2009, 49 Gutenberg Bibles are known to exist, but of these only 21 are complete. Others have pages or even whole volumes missing. In addition, there are a substantial number of fragments, some as small as individual leaves, which are likely to represent about another 16 copies. Many of these fragments have survived because they were used as part of the binding of later books.&lt;ref name="waste" /&gt; There are 12 surviving copies on [[vellum]], although only four of these are complete and one is of the [[New Testament]] only.

Copy numbers listed below are as found in the [[Incunabula Short Title Catalogue]], taken from a 1985 survey of existing copies by [[Ilona Hubay]]; the two copies in Russia were not known to exist in 1985, and therefore were not catalogued.

==Recent history==
[[File:Gutenberg cover.jpg|thumbnail|Binding of the copy at the University of Texas at Austin]]

Today, few copies remain in religious institutions, with most now owned by university libraries and other major scholarly institutions. After centuries in which all copies seem to have remained in Europe, the first Gutenberg Bible reached North America in 1847. It is now in the New York Public Library.&lt;ref name="Clausen"&gt;Clausen Books [http://www.clausenbooks.com/gutenbergcensus.htm Gutenberg Bible Census] accessed 7 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the last hundred years, several long-lost copies have come to light, considerably improving the understanding of how the Bible was produced and distributed.&lt;ref name="waste" /&gt;

In 1921 a New York rare book dealer, [[Gabriel Wells]], bought a damaged paper copy, dismantled the book and sold sections and individual leaves to book collectors and libraries. The leaves were sold in a portfolio case with an essay written by [[A. Edward Newton]], and were referred to as "Noble Fragments".&lt;ref name=mccune&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mccunecollection.org/Incunabula%20Leaf%20Biblia%20Latina.html |title=Incunabula Leaf Biblia Latina (ca 1450) Gutenberg |work=The McCune Collection |date=31 August 2014 |accessdate=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lbis.kenyon.edu/sca/exhibits/incunabula/z241b58.phtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901123038/http://lbis.kenyon.edu/sca/exhibits/incunabula/z241b58.phtml |archivedate=2006-09-01 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953 [[Charles Scribner's Sons]], also book dealers in New York, dismembered a paper copy of volume II. The largest portion of this, the New Testament, is now owned by Indiana University. The matching first volume of this copy was subsequently discovered in Mons, Belgium.&lt;ref name="Long lost" /&gt;

The only copy held outside Europe or North America is the first volume of a Gutenberg Bible (Hubay 45) at [[Keio University]] in Tokyo. The Humanities Media Interface Project (HUMI) at Keio University is known for its high-quality digital images of Gutenberg Bibles and other rare books.&lt;ref name="Gutenberg Bible: The HUMI Project" /&gt; Under the direction of Professor [[Toshiyuki Takamiya]], the HUMI team has made digital reproductions of 11 sets of the bible in nine institutions, including both full-text facsimiles held in the collection of the [[British Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pearson |first1=David |editor1-last=Bowman |editor1-first=J |title=British Librarianship and Information Work 1991–2000: Rare book librarianship and historical bibliography |date=2006 |publisher=Ashgate Publishing Ltd. |location=Aldershot |isbn=978-0-7546-4779-9 |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last sale of a complete Gutenberg Bible took place in 1978, which sold for $2.2 million. This copy is now in Stuttgart.&lt;ref name="Clausen" /&gt; The price of a complete copy today is estimated at $25−35 million.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;MSNBC: [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6124643/ In the book world, the rarest of the rare]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Luxist.com"&gt;Luxist.com: [http://www.luxist.com/2008/01/31/the-world-of-rare-books-the-gutenberg-bible-first-and-most-val/ The World of Rare Books: The Gutenberg Bible, First and Most Valuable] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410171301/http://www.luxist.com/2008/01/31/the-world-of-rare-books-the-gutenberg-bible-first-and-most-val |date=2013-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual leaves now sell for $50,000–$150,000, depending upon condition and the desirability of the page. Eight leaves ([[Book of Esther]]) from the fragment owned by the Collection of the Library of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] in New York were sold in June 2015 by Sotheby's for $970,000.

A two-volume paper edition of the Gutenberg Bible was stolen from [[Moscow State University]] in 2009 and subsequently recovered in a [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] sting operation in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-27738164 |title=Russia sentences secret agents over theft of Gutenberg Bible |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular copy had been looted by the Soviet Army after [[World War II]] from the Library of the [[Leipzig University|University of Leipzig]], Germany, and was estimated to be worth in excess of $20.4 million.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8976">The [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] publishes many [[book]]s, which contain its complete list of [[definition]]s. The definitions are divided into seven "colour books": Gold, Green, Blue, Purple, Orange, White, and Red.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Nomenclature and Terminology (including IUPAC color books)|url = http://www.iupac.org/home/publications/e-resources/nomenclature-and-terminology.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an eighth book—the "Silver Book".

== The eight ''colour books'' ==
=== ''Blue Book''===
'''''Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry''''', commonly referred to by [[chemist]]s as the '''''Blue Book''''', is a collection of recommendations on [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|organic chemical nomenclature]] published at irregular intervals by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC). A full edition was published in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{BlueBook1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; an abridged and updated version of which was published in 1993 as '''''A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{BlueBook1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these are now [[Out-of-print book|out-of-print]] in their paper versions, but are available free of charge in electronic versions. After the release of a draft version for public comment in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Preferred names in the nomenclature of organic compounds | url = http://www.iupac.org/web/ins/2001-043-1-800 | publisher = International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry | accessdate = 2009-11-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091219183334/http://www.iupac.org/web/ins/2001-043-1-800 | archivedate = 2009-12-19 | df =  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the publication of several revised sections in the journal ''[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]'', a fully revised version was published in print in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{BlueBook2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Gold Book'' ===
[[File:GoldBookCover.jpg|thumb|right|200 px|The front cover of the second edition of the ''Compendium of Chemical Terminology''.]]
The '''''Compendium of Chemical Terminology''''' is a book published by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) containing internationally accepted definitions for [[Terminology|terms]] in [[chemistry]]. Work on the first edition was initiated by [[Victor Gold (chemist)|Victor Gold]], thus spawning its informal name: the '''''Gold Book'''''.

The first edition was published in 1987 ({{ISBN|0-63201-765-1}}) and the second edition ({{ISBN|0-86542-684-8}}), edited by A. D. McNaught and A. Wilkinson, was published in 1997. A slightly expanded version of the ''Gold Book'' is also freely searchable online. Translations have also been published in French, Spanish and Polish.

=== ''Green Book'' ===
'''''[[Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry]]''''', commonly known as the '''''Green Book''''', is a compilation of terms and symbols widely used in the field of physical chemistry. It also includes a table of physical constants, tables listing the properties of elementary particles, chemical elements, and nuclides, and information about conversion factors that are commonly used in physical chemistry.  The most recent edition is the third edition ({{ISBN|978-0-85404-433-7}}), originally published by IUPAC in 2007. A second printing of the third edition was released in 2008; this printing made several minor revisions to the 2007 text. A third printing of the third edition was released in 2011. The text of the third printing is identical to that of the second printing.

=== ''Orange Book'' ===
The '''''Compendium of Analytical Nomenclature''''' is a book published by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) containing internationally accepted definitions for terms in [[analytical chemistry]]. It has traditionally been published in an orange cover, hence its informal name, the '''''Orange Book'''''.

Although the book is described as the "Definitive Rules", there have been three editions published; the first in 1978 ({{ISBN|0-08022-008-8}}), the second in 1987 ({{ISBN|0-63201-907-7}}) and the third in 1998 ({{ISBN|0-86542-615-5}}). The third edition is also available online. A Catalan translation has also been published (1987, {{ISBN|84-7283-121-3}}).

=== ''Purple Book'' ===
The first edition of the '''''Compendium of Macromolecular Terminology and Nomenclature''''', known as the '''''Purple Book''''', was published in 1991 and is now out of print. It is about the nomenclature of polymers.

=== ''Red Book'' ===
'''''Nomenclature of Inorganic Chemistry''''', by chemists commonly referred to as the '''''Red Book''''', is a collection of recommendations on [[IUPAC nomenclature of inorganic chemistry|inorganic chemical nomenclature]]. It is published at irregular intervals by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC). The last full edition was published in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{RedBook2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in both paper and electronic versions.

The company '''idealo internet GmbH''' is a [[price comparison service]] launched in [[Germany]] in 2000, and since bought by the [[Axel Springer AG]] publishing company. The headquarters are in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The idealo website allows users to compare prices on a range of products from many shops.

==History==
The company was founded by Martin Sinner, Albrecht von Sonntag, Christian Habermehl and others in 2000, using €500,000 in [[venture capital]] (of which €350,000 from [[KfW]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Unsere 15 Besten |date=19 August 2012 |newspaper=Berliner Morgenpost |url=http://www.morgenpost.de/printarchiv/biz/article108682654/Unsere-15-Besten.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 2006, [[Axel Springer]] bought a 74.9% majority interest in idealo internet GmbH for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Handelsblatt]] |title=Springer kauft Preissuchmaschine idealo |date=25 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228150941/http://www.handelsblatt.com/news/Unternehmen/IT-Medien/_pv/grid_id/1215915/_p/201197/_t/ft/_b/1112267/default.aspx/springer-kauft-preissuchmaschine-idealo.html |archivedate=28 February 2007

==Technology==
The idealo sites use a combination of [[screen scraping]] retailers' websites and CSV files supplied by the retailers themselves to create a unique database of product offers that is filtered by real people. These prices are matched against a bespoke backend database of products and this matching process is carried out by using a [[fuzzy logic]] automated matching system as well as large teams of people also acting as a quality control filter.

==Business model==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}
idealo is a consumer review and price comparison website that is similar to other price comparison services in that it is financed by advertisers on traffic quantities as well as quality.

===Main Differentiators from competition===
Product offers displayed on the idealo website are normally ordered by price where the lowest is shown at the top of any listing, however on product listing pages the products are ordered by price, popularity, user rating or test results. This is in contrast to alternative price comparison services such as [[Kelkoo]] and [[Shopping.com]], which feature only paying retailers and allow them to bid for position in the rankings.

Each idealo website also features a place for product reviews and shows a trend graph of each product costs over time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2970">An '''instrumentum laboris''' ([[Latin]] for "working instrument") is a type of [[Holy See|Vatican]] official document used at a [[General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops]]. The first such document was drafted for the [[Third Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops|Synod on evangelization]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="millerbook"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=J. Michael|author-link1=John Michael Miller|title=The Post-synodal Apostolic Exhortations of John Paul II|date=1998|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Publishing|isbn=0879739282|page=28|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=nE36DRkSTFgC&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;ots=c6w5tZB8g6&amp;dq=INSTRUMENTUM%20LABORIS%20lineamenta%20canon%20law&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''instrumentum laboris'' is based on responses to the ''[[Lineamenta]]'', an introduction and outline of the subject for discussion which is sent to all [[Episcopal Conferences]], Eastern Churches, Departments of the [[Roman Curia|Curia]] and the Union of Superiors General before an assembly of bishops. Responses to the ''Lineamenta'' are sent to the [[Synod of Bishops (Catholic)#Secretariat and Council|General Secretariat]], who then organizes the submissions to determine the primary discussion points of the assembly. He then drafts the ''instrumentum laboris'' as a guide to the discussion, incorporating the input received from the ''Lineamenta'' along with the teachings of the Church on the subject and any other relevant material. The document is then approved by the [[Pope]], translated as necessary, and sent to the bishops assembled for the Synod. The assembled bishops will discuss the contents, and are free to modify or even rewrite it completely over the course of the Synod. The document may also be published for reading by the general public.&lt;ref name="millerbook" /&gt;

The ''instrumentum laboris'' is not an indicator of what the conclusions of the Synod will be,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schotte|first1=Jan P.|author-link=Jan Pieter Schotte|title=Presentation of the Lineamenta for the Special Assembly for America of the Synod of Bishops|date=1996-09-03|publisher=''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can give an idea of the general consensus in the Church on the subject of discussion.&lt;ref name="millerbook" /&gt; Pope [[John Paul II]] stated that the document was "a sign and builder of communion, [since] it expresses the voice of the Church, and at the same time it fosters an exchange which enriches that voice in the common task".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[John Paul II]]|title=Letter to the Bishops on the Publication of the ''Instrumentum Laboris'' for the Synod of 1987|date=1987|publisher=''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to talks at Vatican II, the majority of bishops present agreed that the ''instrumentum laboris'' was essential for the life of the church.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

[[File:CirrusField-color.jpg|thumb|[[Cirrus cloud]]s; this [[List of cloud types|type of cloud]] was illustrated in the first figure of the first ''International Cloud Atlas'']]
'''''International Cloud Atlas''''' (also '''''Cloud Atlas''''') is a [[cloud atlas]] that was first published in 1896&lt;ref name=ICA1896/&gt; and has remained in print since then. Its initial purposes included aiding the training of [[meteorologist]]s and promoting more consistent use of vocabulary describing [[cloud]]s, which were both important for early [[weather forecasting]]. The first edition featured color plates of color photographs, then still a very new technology, but noted for being inexpensive. Numerous later editions have been published.

==First edition==
Publication of the first edition was arranged by [[Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson]], [[Albert Riggenbach]], and [[Léon Teisserenc de Bort]], members of the Clouds Commission of the [[International Meteorological Committee]] aka [[International Meteorological Organization]] (now the [[World Meteorological Organization]]).&lt;ref name=ICA1896&gt;{{cite book

Consequently, it had separate title pages in each language and is known also by its alternate titles '''''Atlas international des nuages''''' and '''''Internationaler Wolkenatlas'''''.  These were selected by the Clouds Commission, which also included [[Julius von Hann]], [[Henrik Mohn]], and [[Abbott Lawrence Rotch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The first edition featured [[Color printing|printed color]] plates, rather than hand-colored plates. Most of the plates were [[Color photography|color photograph]]s, but also some paintings. A [[cirrus cloud]] was the first [[List of cloud types|type of cloud]] illustrated, from a color photograph.&lt;ref name=ICA1896/&gt; At the time, color photography was new, complicated, and expensive.  Consequently, the Clouds Commission was unable to obtain suitable color photographs of all the cloud types, and they selected paintings to use as substitutes.

The first edition was inspired in part by the observation of the English meteorologist [[Ralph Abercromby (meteorologist)|Ralph Abercromby]] that clouds were of the same general kinds everywhere in the world. Abercromby and Hildebrandsson developed a new classification of clouds that was published in an earlier atlas, the 1890 ''Cloud Atlas'' by Hugo Hildebrand Hildebrandsson, [[Wladimir Köppen]], and [[Georg von Neumayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Singer's ''Wolkentafeln'' (Munich, 1892), ''Classificazione delle nubi'' by the [[Specola Vaticana]] (Rome, 1893), and the Rev. W. Clement Ley's ''Cloudland'' (London, 1894).

==Later editions==
''International Cloud Atlas'' has been published in multiple editions since 1896, including 1911, 1932, 1939, 1956, 1975, 1987 and 2017.  The 1932 edition was titled '' International Atlas of Clouds and of States of the Sky''. It was published in Catalan (''Atles Internacional dels Núvols i dels Estats del cel'') besides the three International Meteorological Organization official languages (English, French and German) because Mr. Rafel Patxot

The 1939 edition modified the title to '' International Atlas of Clouds and Types of Skies''. The 1956 edition was the first published in two volumes, separating text and plates.  This lowered costs and facilitated the publication of translated editions.  It was translated into [[Polish language|Polish]] in 1959 (''Międzynarodowy atlas chmur; atlas skrócony'') and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] in 1958 (''Internasjonalt skyatlas 1956'').  A [[Dutch language|Dutch]] translation was published in 1967 (''Wolkenatlas. Bewerkt naar de Internationale verkorte wolkenatlas van de Meteorologische Wereldorganisatie'').

Also, {{anchor|meteor}}&lt;!--[[Meteor (weather)]] links here--&gt;the former classification of [[hydrometeor]]s was replaced by a classification of '''meteors''', in which the hydrometeors are one group:
* [[Hydrometeor]]: an ensemble of liquid or solid water particles suspended in, or falling through, the atmosphere, blown by the wind from the Earth’s surface, or deposited on objects on the ground or in free air.
* [[Dust storm|Lithometeor]]: an ensemble of particles most of which are solid and non-aqueous. The particles are more or less suspended in the air, or lifted by the wind from the ground.
* [[Photometeor]]: a luminous phenomenon produced by the reflection, refraction, diffraction or interference of light from the sun or the moon.
* [[Atmospheric electricity|Electrometeor]]: a visible or audible manifestation of atmospheric electricity.

==Reception==
One reviewer of the 1896 edition noted that "The illustrations are beautifully colored, and quite apart from its great value to meteorology, the 'Cloud Atlas' is well worth owning for the beauty of the illustrations alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The ''International Cloud Atlas'' was revised numerous times in response to requirements of its principal user community, meteorologists.  Nonetheless, it was not sufficient for all users, and consequently a number of other cloud atlases and critiques have been published.  A 1901 popular German book about the weather reproduced photographs from the ''International Cloud Atlas'', and one reviewer of the 1901 book judged these reproductions to be its best feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Israel Museum''' ({{lang-he|מוזיאון ישראל}}, ''Muze'on Yisrael'') was established in 1965 as [[Israel]]'s [[national museum]]. It is situated on a hill in the [[Givat Ram]] neighborhood of [[Jerusalem]], adjacent to the [[Bible Lands Museum]], the [[Knesset]], the [[Israeli Supreme Court]], and the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].

Among the unique objects on display are the [[Venus of Berekhat Ram]]; the interior of a 1736 [[Zedek ve Shalom]] [[synagogue]] from [[Suriname]]; necklaces worn by [[Jewish]] brides in [[Jews of Yemen|Yemen]]; a mosaic Islamic [[prayer niche]] from 17th-century Persia; and a nail attesting to the practice of crucifixion in Jesus’ time.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/14/arts/design/the-israel-museum-in-jerusalem-renewed.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 A Haven National and Universal, [[New York Times]]]&lt;/ref&gt; An urn-shaped building on the grounds of the museum, the [[Shrine of the Book]], houses the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] and artifacts discovered at [[Masada]]. It is one of the [[list of largest art museums|largest]] museums in the region.

==History==
Jerusalem mayor [[Teddy Kollek]] was the driving spirit behind the establishment of the Israel Museum, one of the leading art and archaeology museums in the world. The Museum houses works dating from prehistory to the present day in its Archaeology, Fine Arts, and Jewish Art and Life Wings, and features extensive holdings of biblical and [[Land of Israel]] archaeology.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Since its establishment in 1965, the Museum has built up a collection of nearly 500,000 objects, representing a broad sample of world material culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imj.org.il//imagine/collections/index.asp |title=Search the Israel Museum Collections |publisher=Imj.org.il |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 25, 2017, Prof. Ido Bruno was appointed Director of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem as the Anne and Jerome Fisher Director. Bruno served as a professor in the Industrial Design Department of the Bezalel Academy of Arts &amp; Design, Jerusalem. He brings to the position decades of experience as a curator and designer of exhibitions presented in Israel and across the world with a focus on art, archeology, science, and history. He was unanimously elected by the Museum's Board of Directors, chaired by Isaac Molho, following an extensive search and review process of candidates from Israel and abroad. Bruno assumed his position at the Museum in November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Culture/Israel-Museum-announces-new-director-508395|title=Israel Museum names new director|publisher=Jerusalem Post|date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James S. Snyder]], former Deputy Director of the [[Museum of Modern Art in New York]], was appointed director of the museum in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Museum and Vision | last=Kleiman | first=Shelley | publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs | date=March 22, 2003 | url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2003/5/Museum%20and%20Vision | accessdate=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1965, the museum was housed in a series of masonry buildings designed by the Russian-born Israeli architect [[Alfred Mansfeld]]. A $100-million campaign to renovate the museum and double its gallery space was completed by Israeli architects Efrat-Kowalsky Architects who renovated the existing buildings &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.archdaily.com/373684/israel-museum-james-carpenter-design-associates| title=Israel Museum / James Carpenter Design Associates + Efrat Kowalsky Architects | website=[[Arch Daily]] | date=May 18, 2013 | accessdate=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/21/arts/design/21museum.html| title=Cleaning Up Intersection of Ancient and Modern  | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | last=Bronner | first=Ethan | date=July 20, 2010 | accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wings for archaeology, the fine arts, and Jewish art and life were completely rebuilt and the original buildings were linked through a new entrance pavilion. The passageways that connect between the buildings and five new pavilions were designed by [[James Carpenter (artist)|James Carpenter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/arts/design/01carpenter.html?pagewanted=all Transparency Is Only the Beginning, [[New York Times]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology Wing==
The [[Samuel Bronfman|Samuel and]] [[Saidye Rosner Bronfman|Saidye Bronfman Archaeology Wing]] tells the story of the ancient Land of Israel, home to peoples of different cultures and faiths,  using unique examples from the Museum's collection of Holy Land archaeology, the foremost holding in the world. Organized chronologically, from prehistory through the Ottoman Empire, the transformed wing presents seven “chapters” of this archaeological narrative, weaving together momentous historical events, cultural achievements, and technological advances, while providing a glimpse into the everyday lives of the peoples of the region. This narrative is supplemented by thematic groupings highlighting aspects of ancient Israeli archaeology that are unique to the region's history, among them Hebrew writing, glass, and coins. Treasures from neighboring cultures that have had a decisive impact on the Land of Israel – such as Egypt, the Near East, Greece and Italy, and the Islamic world – are on view in adjacent and connecting galleries. A special gallery at the entrance to the wing showcases new findings and other temporary exhibition displays.

Highlights on view include: [[Pilate stone|Pilate Stone]], [[Tel Dan Stele|"House of David” inscription]] (9th century BCE), A comparative display of two shrines (8th–7th century BCE), The [[Heliodorus (minister)|Heliodorus]] Stele (178 BCE), Royal [[Herodian]] bathhouse (1st century BCE), [[Hadrian]]’s Triumph: Inscription from a triumphal arch (136 CE), the [[Mosaic of Rehob]] (3rd century CE) and Gold-glass bases from the Roman Catacombs (4th century CE), the [[Talpiot Tomb|Ossuary of Jesus son of Joseph]].&lt;ref name="commons.wikimedia.org"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:IMJ_BACKGROUND_-_Institution_and_Collections.doc.pdf | title=About The Israel Museum, Jerusalem | publisher=Israel Museum, Jerusalem | format=PDF | accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shrine of the Book==
{{main|Shrine of the Book}}
[[File:Billy Rose Art Garden (14755133799).jpg|thumb|[[Shrine of the Book]]]]
The [[Shrine of the Book]] houses the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], the oldest biblical manuscripts in the world, as well as rare early medieval biblical manuscripts. The scrolls were discovered in 1947–56 in 11 caves in and around the Wadi [[Qumran]]. An elaborate planning process of seven years led to the building's eventual construction in 1965 which was funded by the family of [[David Samuel Gottesman]], the Hungarian émigré, the philanthropist who had purchased the scrolls as a gift to the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/02/nyregion/esther-g-gottesman-98-zionist-with-role-in-scrolls-acquisition.html | title=Esther G. Gottesman, 98, Zionist With Role in Scrolls Acquisition | last=Nemy | first=Enid | newspaper=The New York Times | date=October 2, 1997 | accessdate=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building consists of a white dome over a building located two-thirds below the ground.  The dome is reflected in a pool of water that surrounds it. Across from the white dome is a black [[basalt]] wall.&lt;ref name="architect"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/19/arts/art-architecture-a-surrealist-and-the-widow-who-keeps-the-flame.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 | title=A Surrealist And the Widow Who Keeps The Flame | last=Muschamp | first=Herbert | newspaper=The New York Times | date=August 19, 2001 | accessdate=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The colors and shapes of the building are based on the imagery of the Scroll of the ''[[War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness]]'', whereas the white dome symbolizes the Sons of Light and the black wall symbolizes the Sons of Darkness.  The interior of the shrine was designed to depict the environment in which the scrolls were found.&lt;ref name="im"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-israel-museum.htm | title=Israel Museum, Jerusalem | publisher=Sacred Destinations | accessdate=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a permanent display on life in the Qumran, where the scrolls were written.&lt;ref name=im/&gt;  The entire structure was designed to resemble a pot in which the scrolls were found.&lt;ref name="architect" /&gt; The shrine was designed by [[Armand Bartos]] and [[Frederick Kiesler]], and was opened in 1965.&lt;ref name="architect" /&gt;

As the fragility of the scrolls makes it impossible to display all on a continuous basis, a system of rotation is used. After a scroll has been exhibited for 3–6 months, it is removed from its showcase and placed temporarily in a special storeroom, where it "rests" from exposure. The museum also holds other rare ancient manuscripts and displays the [[Aleppo Codex]], which is from the 10th-century and is believed to be the oldest Bible codex in Hebrew.&lt;ref name="im" /&gt;

==Second Temple model==
{{main|Holyland Model of Jerusalem}}
[[File:Jerusalem Modell BW 2.JPG|thumb|[[Holyland Model of Jerusalem|Second Temple model]] at Israel Museum]]
Adjacent to the Shrine is the Model of Jerusalem in the Second Temple Period, which reconstructs the topography and architectural character of the city as it was prior to its destruction by the Romans in 66 CE, and provides historical context to the Shrine's presentation of the Dead Sea Scrolls. Originally constructed on the grounds of Jerusalem's Holyland Hotel, the model, which includes a [[Replicas of the Jewish Temple|replica of Herod's Temple]], is now a permanent feature of the museum's {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huliq.com/2430/model-of-jerusalem-from-the-late-second-temple-era | title=Model of Jerusalem from the late second Temple era | publisher=Huliq News | accessdate=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fine Arts Wing==
The Edmond and Lily Safra Fine Arts Wing reflects the wide-ranging, interdisciplinary nature of the Museum's collections, encompassing works of art from across the ages in Western and non-Western cultures. The wing has been reorganized to highlight connections among works from its diverse curatorial collections, which include: European Art; Modern Art; Contemporary Art; Israeli Art; the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas; Asian Art; Photography; Design and Architecture; and Prints and Drawings. Installations are organized to underscore visual affinities and shared themes and to inspire new insight into the arts of different times and places, as well as an appreciation of the common threads of human culture. The reconfigured wing includes the Museum's first permanent galleries for Israeli art; more than doubled gallery space for the Museum's extensive collections in modern art; providing meaningful connecting points between Western and non-Western holdings; and a full 2,200-square-meter (7,200-square-foot) gallery floor devoted to changing displays from the Museum's collection of contemporary art.

Highlights newly on view include:  The Noel and Harriette Levine Photography Collection, The [[Jacques Lipchitz]] Collection, [[Gustave Courbet]], Jura Landscape with Shepherd and Donkey (ca. 1866), [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Alfred Barye]], Diego in the Studio (1952), [[Ohad Meromi]], The Boy from South Tel Aviv (2001).&lt;ref name="commons.wikimedia.org" /&gt;

The Israel Museum holds a large collection of paintings representing a wide range of periods, styles, subjects, and regions of origin.  Painters in the collection include such international figures as [[Rembrandt]] and [[Camille Pissarro]] as well as such Israeli and Jewish artists as [[Marc Chagall]], [[Abel Pann]], and [[Reuven Rubin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Impressionist and Post-Impressionist Painting and Sculpture in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem | first=Stephanie | last=Rachum | publisher=Harry N.

The Israel Museum's commitment to Israeli art is central to the Museum's mission. As Israel's national museum, it plays a major role in preserving Israel's artistic heritage by collecting works by Israeli artists - in Israel and abroad - and by encouraging Israel's artists to develop in their careers. The Museum's Israeli Art collection spans the late 19th century through today, and it reflects the evolution of Israel's cultural history in the visual arts. The [[Information Center for Israeli Art]] provides scholars and the public with comprehensive archival information on several thousand Israeli artists, including biographical notes, press materials, videos, photographs, and other forms of documentation.

==Jack, Joseph, and Morton Mandel Wing for Jewish Art and Life==

The holdings of the "Jack, Joseph, and [[Morton Mandel]] Wing for Jewish Art and Life" represent the religious and secular material culture of Jewish communities worldwide, spanning centuries from the Middle Ages to the present day. The collection reflects the depth and beauty of Jewish heritage and creativity as well as the aesthetic and stylistic influences of other cultures in places where Jews lived.

The origins of the collection can be traced to the early twentieth century with the establishment of the [[Bezalel National Museum]] under the directorship of [[Mordechai Narkiss]], who expanded significantly the collection of ritual art objects through important treasures rescued between the two world wars and after the [[Holocaust]]. Later on, this treasure was integrated in the newly established Israel Museum in 1965 into the departments of Jewish Art and of Jewish Ethnography. In 1995 they were united into a new independent wing. 
Over the years the Wing's holdings have been strengthened through gifts and acquisitions of individual objects; gift of private collections; and fieldwork within communities in Israel and abroad. The Wing's prominent collections are the Stieglitz Collection and the Feuchtwanger Collection for Jewish ritual objects, Torah scroll ornaments, and life cycle objects, as well as the Schulmann Collection and Rathjens Collection for North African and Yemenite material culture, dress, jewelry and ritual objects.

The wing's collection contains many unique treasures, among them, are rare manuscripts, four reconstructed synagogue interiors, a wide variety of ceremonial and ritual objects, as well as diverse material culture including dress, jewelry, and everyday artifacts.  
In the new permanent display, important objects drawn from this extensive collection from the public and the private realm, are integrated into a multifaceted narrative. This comparative display explores the objects’ history and the social context in which they were used while underscoring their aesthetic qualities and emotional resonance. It reflects a vivid cultural tapestry weaving together the individual and the communal, the sacred and the mundane, the heritage of the past and the creative innovations of the present.

Five principal themes unfold as you walk through the galleries:
*'''The Rhythm of Life: Birth, Marriage, Death''' - highlighting the coexistence of joy and sadness, life, and death, memory and hope at each of these junctures in the life cycle.
*'''Illuminating the Script''' - a display from our collection of rare medieval and Renaissance Hebrew manuscripts, shedding light on their history and revealing their artistry. 
*'''The Synagogue Route: Holiness and Beauty''' - Four restored interiors of synagogues from Europe, Asia, and the Americas, along with Torah scroll ornaments, show the unity and diversity of Jewish religious architecture and ritual objects.
*'''The Cycle of the Jewish Year''' - The sanctity of the Sabbath and the traditional celebration of religious holidays, as well as the new commemoration of special days in the State of Israel, have given rise to a wealth of finely crafted objects and imaginative artworks. 
*'''Costume and Jewelry: A Matter of Identity'''- Environment, custom, and religious law all play their role in creating the rich variety of Jewish dress and jewelry from East and West presented here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2014/dresscodes/en/home/ "Dress Codes: Revealing the Jewish Wardrobe"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023811/http://www.imj.org.il/exhibitions/2014/dresscodes/en/home/ |date=2014-07-03 }}, An exhibition focusing on this collection was presented at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem March 11, 2014-October 18, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isidore and Anne Falk Information Center for Jewish Art and Life===
The Information Center has a research library and a unique archival collection, constantly growing, of some twenty thousand photographs. Many of them are extremely rare, documenting the daily life of Jewish communities around the world, some no longer exist, including images of synagogues, cemeteries, ceremonial objects and many other subjects.

The information center offers access to resources of the collections as well as virtual tours in former exhibitions in order to broaden and deepen knowledge behind the objects in the Wing's collections.

The [[Billy Rose]] Art Garden is a 20-[[dunam]] garden featuring modern and abstract sculptures. The Art Garden, designed for the original campus by Japanese-American sculptor [[Isamu Noguchi]], is counted among the finest outdoor sculpture settings of the 20th century. An Oriental landscape combined with an ancient Jerusalem hillside, the garden serves as the backdrop for the Israel Museum's display of the evolution of the modern western sculptural tradition. On view are works by modern masters including [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Auguste Rodin]], and [[David Smith (sculptor)|David Smith]], together with more recent site-specific commissions by such artists as [[Magdalena Abakanowicz]], [[Mark Dion]], [[James Turrell]], and [[Micha Ullman]].&lt;ref name="commons.wikimedia.org" /&gt;

==Youth Wing==
The Ruth Youth Wing for Art Education was opened in 1966. It is unique in its size and scope of activities, presents a wide range of programming to more than 100,000 schoolchildren each year, and features exhibition galleries, art studios, classrooms, a library of illustrated children's books, and a recycling room. Special programs foster intercultural understanding between Arab and Jewish students and reach out to the wide spectrum of Israel's communities. The wing combines annual original artworks of Israeli and international artists, with educational activities. There are also a variety of workshops for children and adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Israel Museum, Jerusalem | publisher=Israel Travel Center | url=http://www.israel-travel-center.com/attractions_israel-mseuml.html | accessdate=May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rockefeller Archaeological Museum and the Ticho House==
In addition to the extensive programming offered on its main campus, the Israel Museum also operates two off-site locations: the [[Rockefeller Archaeological Museum]] that opened in 1938 for the display of artifacts unearthed mainly in the excavations conducted in [[Mandatory Palestine]], in the 1920s and 1930s;&lt;ref name=rm&gt;{{cite web|title=Rockefeller Archaeological Museum|url=http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/htmls/page_1684.aspx?c0=15160&amp;bsp=14162|publisher=The Israel Museum|access-date=2012-07-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729084713/http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/htmls/page_1684.aspx?c0=15160&amp;bsp=14162|archive-date=2012-07-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ticho House]], which offers an ongoing program of exhibitions by younger Israeli artists in a historic house and garden setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ticho House|url=http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/htmls/page_1712.aspx?c0=15183&amp;bsp=14296|publisher=The Israel Museum|access-date=2012-01-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120141726/http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/htmls/page_1712.aspx?c0=15183&amp;bsp=14296|archive-date=2012-01-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==

===Funding===
The Israel Museum receives only 10% to 12% of its operating budget from state and municipal sources. The Israeli government provides varying amounts of funds each year. The institution must raise 88% of its yearly operating budget, all of its $200 million endowment&lt;ref&gt;Robin Pogrebin (February 28, 2016), [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/29/arts/design/israel-museums-director-to-make-way-for-successor.html Israel Museum’s Director to Make Way for Successor] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="artinfo1"&gt;Rachel Somerstein (February 16, 2010), [http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/33815/better-than-bilbao/ Better than Bilbao?] ''ARTINFO''.&lt;/ref&gt; and $100 million for its recent capital project, while paying 17.5% VAT as well as real-estate taxes on the campus property.

The most active of the international support groups of the museum, the American Friends of the Israel Museum raised $270 million in cash, of which $47 million is in endowment funds, and donated $210 million in the art from 1972 to 2008. In 2009, the Israel Museum received $12 million from the Edmond J. Safra Philanthropic Foundation, towards the renovation, reinstallation, and endowment of its fine arts wing, which will be renamed after [[Edmond Safra|Edmond]] and [[Lily Safra]].&lt;ref&gt;Charmaine Picard (May 20, 2009), [http://www.theartnewspaper.com/article.asp?id=17337 Israel Museum receives $12m from Safra foundation] ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Wolfgang Alexander Ausonius''' (born '''Wolfgang Alexander Zaugg''', 12 July 1953), known in the media as '''Lasermannen''' ("the Laser Man"), is a Swedish convicted [[murder]]er, [[Bank robbery|bank robber]], and attempted [[serial killer]].&lt;ref name=ne.se&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | first=Ulf | last=Arvidsson | title=Lasermannen | encyclopedia=[[Nationalencyklopedin]] | language=Swedish | url=http://www.ne.se/lasermannen | accessdate=9 July 2010}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet080430&gt;{{cite news | first1=Susanna | last1=Vidlund | first2=Tobias | last2=Österberg | title=Fortsatt livstid för "Lasermannen" | url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article2375977.ab | newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] | agency=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]] | date=30 April 2008 | language=Swedish | accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet051123&gt;{{cite news | first=Anders | last=Johansson | title=Min avsikt var ett mord | url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article331584.ab | newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] | date=23 November 2005 | language=Swedish | accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From August 1991 to January 1992 he shot eleven people in the [[Stockholm]] and [[Uppsala]] area, most of whom were immigrants, killing one and seriously injuring the others. He first used a rifle equipped with a [[laser sight]] (hence, his nickname), and later switched to a [[revolver]]. He was arrested in June 1992 and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] in January 1994.&lt;ref name=ne.se /&gt;&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet080430 /&gt;

==Early life==
{{BLP sources|date=July 2010}}
Ausonius was born Wolfgang Alexander Zaugg in [[Lidingö]], northeast of [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. He is the son of a [[Swiss (nationality)|Swiss]] father and a [[Germans|German]] mother, both of whom had emigrated to Sweden. He grew up in [[Vällingby]], a [[working class]] [[suburb]] of Stockholm. According to newspaper reports, he was [[bullying|bullied]] as a child because of his non-[[Swedish people|Swedish]] background, which manifested in him being teased for having very black hair and brown eyes. As an adult, he bleached his hair blonde, used blue contact lenses and legally changed his name. Initially, he changed his name to John Wolfgang Alexander Stannerman, and later to John Wolfgang Alexander Ausonius. He went to the German School in Stockholm, a private school, but dropped out before graduating. He later completed his secondary school education in an adult education programme. Ausonius was accepted into the [[Royal Institute of Technology]], but dropped out after a couple of years of unsuccessful study.

In 1986, following the [[Olof Palme assassination]], Ausonius, then named John Stannerman, was one of the police's initial suspects. However, Stannerman could not be linked to the murder as he was incarcerated at the time, serving a sentence for multiple counts of assault committed. In prison he became an acquaintance of [[Miro Barešić]], a member of [[Croatian National Resistance]], a [[Croatia|Croatian]] [[émigré]] [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] organization created by members of the [[Fascism|fascist]] [[Ustaše]] movement. Barešić was imprisoned for the 1971 murder of [[Vladimir Rolović]], the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] ambassador to Sweden.

Ausonius developed a hatred for [[Communism|Communists]], [[Social democracy|Social Democrats]], and [[immigration|immigrants]] while fostering an ambition of gaining wealth.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} He worked a low-paying job as a [[Taxicab|taxi]] driver, but later started trading in [[stocks]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]. His talent for the market quickly earned him a fairly large fortune resulting him adopting the [[yuppie]] lifestyle. By the late 1980s he owned a luxurious apartment, a [[Toyota Supra]] (rather than owning a [[Porsche]], which many other yuppies drove at that time, as he despised the company), and a [[mobile phone]] (before the 1990s, such a device was a luxury item usually associated with a jet-set lifestyle). However, poorly chosen investments depleted his fortune. This was further aggravated by an addiction to gambling. As a result of the latter, during a trip to [[Germany]] he found himself in dire economic circumstances. With funds running out, Ausonius turned to bank robbing to maintain his lifestyle.&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet16423 /&gt; He performed more than eighteen robberies, largely in identical fashion.

==Shooting spree==

In 1979, Ausonius became a Swedish citizen. He had a strong hatred for immigrants and foreigners. These beliefs led him to start looking for immigrant criminals to kill. Eventually, he was tired of this and decided to simply kill any immigrant. He hoped that this way, he would scare all immigrants out of Sweden.&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet16423&gt;{{cite news | first=Thomas | last=Gustafsson | title=Jag har levt i en lögn | url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article16423.ab | newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] | date=5 April 2001 | language=Swedish | accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1981 and 1982, Ausonius [[Conscription in Sweden|served]] in the [[Swedish army]] and thus learnt how to use weapons. However, his personal weapons were of poor quality, very likely because Ausonius had modified them. He sawed off the barrel and the stock of his first rifle to make it shorter, and he fitted the [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] [[revolver]] with a [[Suppressor|silencer]]. This modification may have been the key to his failures in killing most of his victims as it deviated the bullet's trajectory and consequently caused him to miss his victims. It was amateurishly done and damaged the weapon's performance.&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet051123 /&gt;

*3 August 1991: Ausonius shot David Gebremariam, a 21-year-old immigrant from [[Eritrea]]. Gebremariam  was shot in the back, but survived.&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet051123 /&gt; Two of the victim's friends said they saw a circle of red light on his body before they heard the shot.
*21 October 1991: Shahram Khosravi, a 25-year-old student of [[Iran]]ian origin, was shot in the face outside the [[Stockholm University]]. Khosravi survived the attack.&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet051123 /&gt;
*27 October 1991: Dimitrios Karamalegos, a [[homelessness|homeless]] man of [[Greece|Greek]] origin, was shot twice in the stomach.&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet051123 /&gt;  Although wounded, he survived. Karamalegos reported seeing a bright red light prior to hearing the shots.
*1 November 1991: During the middle of the day, Ausonius walked into a restaurant kitchen in Stockholm and shot Heberson Vieira Da Costa, a musician from [[Brazil]]. Da Costa was shot once in the head and several times in the stomach.&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet051123 /&gt; Despite these injuries, Da Costa survived. He reported to police that he saw a red light before he was shot. Da Costa was also able to provide a good description of Ausonius.
*8 November 1991: Ausonius mortally wounded Jimmy Ranjbar, another Iranian student, who died the following day.&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet051123 /&gt;

Between the first and second wave of shooting, Ausonius took a trip to the United States. He visited [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], to gamble and see the [[Grand Canyon]]. He then returned to Sweden.

*22 January 1992: In [[Uppsala]], Ausonius walked up to a couple in a café outside the Linnaeus Garden, and shot [[Erik Bongcam-Rudloff]], a [[Ph.D.]] student in medical sciences, in the head.&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet051123 /&gt; Bongcam-Rudloff survived, and is now a scientist representing Sweden in several international scientific networks.&lt;ref name="ISCB Conference"&gt;[http://www.iscb.org/iscbafrica2013-program/keynote-speakers "ISCB Conference"]&lt;/ref&gt;
*23 January 1992: Having returned to Stockholm, Ausonius shot Charles Dhlakama, a black bus driver originally from [[Zimbabwe]], in the middle of the day. Dhlakama was shot in the chest but survived.&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet051123 /&gt; That evening, Ausonius walked into a [[Somalia|Somali]] club and shot two men, both of whom survived.&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet051123 /&gt;
*28 January 1992: Ausonius shot Isa Aybar, an immigrant of Syrian/Assyrian/Aramean origin, four times in the head and arm. Aybar was seriously wounded, but managed to call the police and survived.&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet051123 /&gt;
*30 January 1992: In [[Hägerstensåsen]], Ausonius shot Hasan Zatara, a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] store owner, in the head [[paralysis|paralyzing]], but not killing him. Zatara's son [[Imad Zatara]] is a footballer.

==Capture and trial==

The police started a massive [[manhunt (law enforcement)|manhunt]] (second in size only to the hunt for [[Olof Palme]]'s killer). On 12 June 1992, during a bank robbery, Ausonius was arrested.&lt;ref name=ne.se /&gt; He later [[assault]]ed his own [[lawyer]] in court and spent the rest of his [[trial (law)|trial]] in [[handcuffs]]. He was convicted of murder and robbery, but could not be linked to all of the shootings (although he confessed to all of them in 2000).&lt;ref name=Aftonbladet16423 /&gt; He was sentenced to life imprisonment and was later incarcerated at the [[Kumla Prison]]. In June 2012, he was transferred to the [[Österåker Prison]].&lt;ref name=Expressen&gt;{{cite news | first=Erik| last=Paulsson | title=Lasermannen bloggar inifrån fängelset | url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/lasermannen-bloggar-inifran-fangelset/ | newspaper=[[Expressen]] | date=3 January 2013 | language=Swedish | accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ausonius has applied to have his life sentence commuted to a fixed term on three occasions, in 2008, 2010, and 2012. The court has rejected his application on all occasions. On 2 November 2012, his third appeal was rejected by the Örebro District Court. On all three occasions the National Board of Forensic Medicine determined that there was a risk that Ausonius would reoffend due to his [[autism]] and [[personality disorder]], which the court took into consideration when making its decision.&lt;ref name="Dagens Nyheter"&gt;{{cite news | author=TT| title=Ausonius ansökan avslås | url=http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/ausonius-ansokan-avslas/ | newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] | date=2 November 2012 | language=Swedish | accessdate=3 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial for German murder ==
In 2016 Ausonius was extradited to Germany to face trial for the 23 February 1992 murder in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] of Blanka Zmigrod, a 68-year-old [[Holocaust]] survivor. While investigating, German police looked into ties to far-right terror group [[National Socialist Underground]].&lt;ref name="welt"&gt;[https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article160338546/Schweden-liefert-Lasermann-nach-Deutschland-aus.html "Lasermannen"], ''[[Die Welt]]'', 16-12-2016 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February 2018 he was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment in Germany, also. Prosecutors had charged him with stealing her handbag after killing her because he thought she had taken an electronic device that he used to save his bank account numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thelocal.de/20180221/swedens-laser-man-killer-verdict-over-frankfurt-murder |title=German court jails Sweden's 'laser man' shooter for life |newspaper=The Local |location=Germany |agency=AFP |date=21 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
The journalist [[Gellert Tamas]] wrote a book about the case, ''Lasermannen - en berättelse om Sverige'' (2002), which became a [[bestseller]]. The book, which is very detailed, was published without consulting the victims first.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The author's personal opinions not only deal with Ausonius and his life story, but also with Sweden in general, speculating that his actions were in part explained by a surge of [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] sentiments in the country in the early 1990s, including the success of the [[New Democracy (Sweden)|Ny Demokrati]] right-wing party in the election. According to Tamas, it could also be one of many attempts by Ausonius to prove his identity as a "true Swedish man'' by separating himself from immigrants.&lt;ref name="P3 Dokumentär"&gt;''P3 Dokumentär'': [http://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt/83912?programid=2519&amp;playepisode=83912 "Lasermannen"], [[Sveriges Radio]] P3, 5-5-2006 (in Swedish)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the book was adapted into a play, and the same year [[Sveriges Television|SVT]] produced a three-part TV [[Lasermannen (TV series)|miniseries]], which premiered on 23 November. Ausonius was played by [[David Dencik]].

==Engagement==
In late April 2006, the daily ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' revealed that John Ausonius had become engaged to an anonymous 23-year-old woman, who had fallen in love with him after having seen a recent television miniseries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Såg tv-serien och blev kär |first=Anders |last=Johansson |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article10810709.ab |newspaper=[[Aftonbladet]] |language=Swedish |date=29 April 2006 |accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the paper, a friend of the woman said the couple were planning to move abroad after Ausonius' putative release from prison by 2031.

The [[United States Navy]], like any organization, produces its own acronyms and abbreviations, which often come to have meaning beyond their bare expansions. United States Navy personnel sometimes colloquially refer to these as ''NAVSpeak''. Like other organizational colloquialisms, their use often creates or reinforces a sense of esprit and closeness within the organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="75236">This is a list of current [[professional boxing]] rankings, which includes the latest rankings by each one of the sport's four major sanctioning bodies, as well as other well-regarded sites and entities.

==Overview==

As professional boxing has four major sanctioning bodies ([[World Boxing Association|WBA]], [[World Boxing Council|WBC]], [[International Boxing Federation|IBF]], [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]]) each with their own champions, the sport doesn't have a centralized ranking system. The rankings published by these organizations share the trait of not ranking the other organizations' champions, as each one of the sanctioning bodies expects their champion to frequently defend their title against their top-ranked contender. The WBA often has more than one champion, none of which are ranked by the other 3 sanctioning bodies. Their "Super" and "Regular" champions are excluded from the rankings but their "Interim" champion is affixed to the #1 spot. The IBF's protocol is for the top 2 spots in its rankings to remain vacant until two of its other top-ranked contenders face off, at which point the winner takes one of those two places.

In addition to the rankings published by the major sanctioning bodies, the [[Transnational Boxing Rankings Board|TBRB]] and [[The Ring (magazine)|''The Ring'']] each publish their own independent rankings, not excluding any organizations' champions. The aim of both the TBRB and ''The Ring'' is to crown a single champion for each division. Every single one of these lists are assembled by a committee but since the 90s, other parties have experimented with computerized rankings, but these are sometimes regarded as incapable of accounting for all of boxing's quirks and subtleties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnews24.com/2015/02/boxrec-coms-computerized-rankings/|title=Boxrec.com's computerized rankings » Boxing News|date=1 February 2015|website=Boxingnews24.com|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tbrb.org/mission/|title=FEEDBACK - Transnational Boxing Rankings Board|website=Tbrb.org|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely known computerized rankings are published by [[BoxRec]] and updated daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boxing247.com/boxing-news/invaluable-site-boxrecs-new-ratings-the-pound-for-pound-best-of-all-time/57751|title=Invaluable site BoxRec's new ratings: the pound-for-pound best of all-time! - Boxing News|date=14 June 2016|website=Boxingnews24.com|accessdate=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a list compiling the latest installment of all the previously mentioned rankings.

The '''New Exit for the [[Uffizi Gallery]]''' ({{lang-it|Nuova Uscita per la Galleria Degli Uffizi}}), designed by architects [[Arata Isozaki]] and Andrea Maffei, was the project that won the closed international design competition launched in 1998 with the purpose of expanding the museum's exhibition space and creating a grand exit. Many world-renowned architects participated, among whom were: [[Mario Botta]], [[Norman Foster]], [[Gae Aulenti]], [[Hans Hollein]] and [[Vittorio Gregotti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Godoli|first=Antonio|title=La Nuova Uscita Degli Uffizi: Progetti per Piazza Castellani|year=1998|publisher=Gruppo Editoriale Giunti|location=Florence|isbn=9788809217133|author2=Arata Isozaki |author3=Gae Aulenti |author4=Mario Botta |author5=Norman Foster |author6=Vittorio Gregotti |author7=Hans Hollein }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the [[Grandi Uffizi]] initiative, a 60 million euro renovation and development project for the overall museum, the [[loggia]]'s construction became a controversial subject for Florentines and thus has been at a standstill since its original scheduled completion date of 2003.&lt;ref name="Ponsi"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ponsi|first=Andrea|title=The Uffizi Exit: Debate Continues over the Loggia Isozaki|journal=The Florentine|date=10 February 2011|issue=136|url=http://www.theflorentine.net/articles/article-view.asp?issuetocId=6572}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was envisioned as a large steel and stone loggia that would echo its counterpart, the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] on [[Piazza della Signoria]]. While at the same time, it would comment on the precarious balance that exists between tradition and modernity in a context that seldom sees large architectural change.

==Concept==
[[Loggia]] are common and prominent public structures in [[Florence]]; to cite two examples, [[Loggia dei Lanzi]], or the [[Loggia del Grano, Florence|Loggia del Grano]]. For the final proposal at the competition, the architect Arata Isozaki and Andrea Maffei replicate this traditional form for both its historic but also functional aspects: providing cover and protection from the elements when necessary yet also establishing a new public reference point for Florentine people. The light trapezoidal cover of the loggia, narrows where it connects to the museum, and references, according to the architects, [[Brunelleschi|brunelleschian]] themes from Renaissance. The structure intended to allow the public to interact with the city by providing not only necessary programme and space for the museum's expansion, but to allow for a constant flow of people through a neglected space within the current fabric of the city.&lt;ref name="new-loggia"&gt;{{cite web|title=A new loggia for Florence|url=http://www.amarchitects.it/portfolio-item/nuova-uscita-museo-degli-uffizi/?lang=en|publisher=Andrea Maffei Architects}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, a design for the exit had already been proposed before the competition. The project by [[Giovanni Michelucci]] consisted primarily of a glass prism that would lead people out; it would become a landmark to decorate the back of [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s famous structure.&lt;ref name="Wanted"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Uffizi get a new look|url=http://rome.wantedineurope.com/news/2001201/the-uffizi-get-a-new-look.html|newspaper=Wanted in Europe|date=2004-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though never realized, this endeavor became a forerunner to the competition of 1998.

==Building==
The proposal for the building was designed as a structure with limited connection to the ground. The use of a historic typology to define the form was an aesthetic choice the competition judges appreciated and awarded.&lt;ref name="Ponsi"/&gt; A tall fan-shaped structure, large enough to span the entire slanted site, would be made principally of [[steel]], [[pietra serena]] and [[glass]]. The new exit was created not to compete with the existing grand entrance, or to deviate visitors from the main promenade through the museum. Instead it was focused on revitalizing the area by Piazza Castellani, which had become an afterthought.

The loggia was designed as a piece that would settle amongst the existing buildings, yet stand in contrast as a modernist addition to the city. The simplicity allowed the architects to create a continuous space, one that would blur the interior with the exterior. Pietra serena was chosen to pave the ground of the exterior sloping plane and outdoor areas, visually merging the space. The canopy was composed of a series of horizontal beams, arranged in a radial manner within a trapezoidal frame. Covered with glass panels, the Tuscan sunlight would filter through the space creating interesting shadows as the sun traversed the sky.&lt;ref name="new-loggia" /&gt; Four thick columns support the large horizontal plane, and serve to highlight the existing beauty of Giorgio Vasari's windows, which were not altered in the architect's proposition. The back columns are connected to a stone block that covers the exits, but manages at the same time, to highlight the back facade of the existing building. The areas below the ramp, of approximately 300 square meters, would be designated to the museum's extension, principally in the form of storage.&lt;ref name="new-loggia" /&gt; The slope of the site, an important historic element was extended in order to connect the existing [[Vicolo dell'Oro]] street and the network of smaller passageways with [[Via dei Leoni]]. At the center of the space, the architects decided to place four of the Uffizi's sculptures on pedestals matching the exit sequence at the back.

The new intervention intended to create an interesting reciprocity between the new structure and that of the Loggia del Grano (its historic complement that dominates the corner across the street)and "become an instrument for the museum to communicate with the city".&lt;ref name="Wanted" /&gt;

==Current debate==
The project for the new exit of the museum continues to be a sensitive subject for Florentines. The project has been at a stand-still since 2003 when it was originally intended to be unveiled. The debate over the loggia became both a political argument as well as an aesthetic one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fisher|first=Ian|title=Uffizi Expansion Is Finally (Well, Maybe) to Begin|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/03/arts/03uffi.html?_r=1&amp;|publisher=The New York Times|location=ARTS|date=February 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruins]] below the Uffizi were discovered not long after excavations began which made the project even harder to realize due to strict preservation policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Falconi|first=Marta|title=Medieval finds block new exit from Uffizi|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/feb/24/arts.italy|work=The Guardian|location=Rome|page=News|date=February 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the debate continues to divide the city in two, those who support the project and those that stand against it. The new changes within the Uffizi building have made the realization of the modern loggia even less of a possibility; thus creating what the media has coined as a "cultural wound".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giuti|first=Ilaria|title=Appello Della Cultura: La Loggia Isozaki Va Fatta.|journal=La Repubblica|series=Cronaca Sec.|pages=IX}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even to this day appeals are continuously made by groups of architects, artists and art collectors to build the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ficicchia|first=Loredana|title=Isozaki, L'appello Degli Architetti: Una Ferita, Costruiamo La Loggia.|journal=Corriere Fiorentino|date=17 November 2012|series=Architetture Sec}}&lt;/ref&gt; All in the hope of introducing a modern project amidst the grandiose historic buildings of Florence's core.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6289">'''Nicneven''' or '''Nicnevin''' or '''Nicnevan''' (whose name is from a [[Scottish Gaelic]] [[surname]], Neachneohain meaning "daughter(s) of the divine" and/or "daughter(s) of Scathach"  NicNaoimhein meaning "daughter of the little saint")&lt;ref name=scotsleid&gt;"nic" meaning "daughter"  and "naoimhein" meaning "of little saint" ( &gt; the proper name [[Niven]]) http://www.dsl.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; is a Queen of the [[Fairies]] in [[Scottish folklore]].  In Ireland and Scotland, "the Feile na Marbh", (the “festival of the dead”) took place on Samhain (Celtic New Year) The names Satia, NICNEVEN, Bensozie, Zobiana, Abundia, Herodiana, were all used to identify the Scottish Witch Goddess of Samhain. The use of the name for this meaning was first found in [[Alexander Montgomerie|Montgomerie]]’s [[Flyting]] (c.1585)&lt;ref name=scotsleid/&gt; and was seemingly taken from a woman in [[Scotland]] condemned to death for [[witchcraft]] before being burnt at the stake as a [[witch]].&lt;ref name=jamieson2&gt;''Supplement to the Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language: Volume Two'' by [[John Jamieson]], Printed at the University Press for W. &amp; C. Tait, 1825, page. 156&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Anglo-Scottish Border|Borders]] the name for this archetype was '''Gyre-Carling''' whose name had variants such as '''Gyre-Carlin''', '''Gy-Carling''', '''Gay-Carlin''' amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;''A Glossary of North Country Words, with Their Etymology, and Affinity to Other Languages: And Occasional Notices of Local Customs and Popular Superstitions'' by John Trotter Brockett, William Edward Brockett, E. Charnley, 1846, page 203&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gyre'' is possibly a cognate of the [[Old Norse|Norse]] word ''geri'' and thus having the meaning of "greedy"&lt;ref&gt;''An Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language: Illustrating the Words in Their Different Significations by Examples from Ancient and Modern Writers, Volume One'' by John Jamieson, Printed at the University Press for W. Creech, 1808, page. 374&lt;/ref&gt;  or it may be from the Norse ''gýgr'' meaning "ogress";&lt;ref name=scotsleid/&gt; ''carling'' or ''carline'' is a [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[Northern England English|Northern English]] word meaning "old woman" which is from, or related to, the [[Old Norse|Norse]] word ''kerling'' (of the same meaning).&lt;ref&gt;''A Dictionary of North East Dialect'' by Bill Griffiths, Northumbria University Press, 2005, {{ISBN|1-904794-16-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-904794-16-5}}, page. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Scandinavian Loan-Words in Middle English, Part 1'' by Erik Bjorkman, BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008, {{ISBN|0-559-15368-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-559-15368-6}}, page 142&lt;/ref&gt;

She was sometimes thought of as the mother witch, [[Hecate]], or [[Habundia]] figure of Scottish fairy mythology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Mallord William Turner]], ed., ''The poetical works of [[Sir Walter Scott]]'' (Robert Cadell, 1833), [https://books.google.com/books?id=dT0qAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA280&amp;dq=%22Nicnevin%22+-inpublisher:icon&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=zjUhS7e2FIS-yQSKluCUCg&amp;hl=fr&amp;cd=10#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nicnevin%22%20-inpublisher%3Aicon&amp;f=false v. 2 pp. 279-280].&lt;/ref&gt;  This guise is frankly diabolical.&lt;ref&gt;[[Katharine Mary Briggs|Katharine Briggs]], ''A Dictionary of Fairies'' (Penguin, 1977; {{ISBN|0-14-004753-0}}), p. 310&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sir Walter Scott]] calls her:

:a gigantic and malignant female, the Hecate of this mythology, who rode on the storm and marshalled the rambling host of wanderers under her grim banner. This hag (in all respects the reverse of the Mab or Titania of the Celtic creed) was called Nicneven in that later system which blended the faith of the Celts and of the Goths on this subject. The great Scottish poet Dunbar has made a spirited description of this Hecate riding at the head of witches and good neighbours (fairies, namely), sorceresses and elves, indifferently, upon the ghostly eve of All-Hallow Mass.  In Italy we hear of the hags arraying themselves under the orders of Diana (in her triple character of Hecate, doubtless) and Herodias, who were the joint leaders of their choir, But we return to the more simple fairy belief, as entertained by the Celts before they were conquered by the Saxons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sir Walter Scott]], ''Letters on Demonology and Witchcraft'' (1831), ch, [http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/scott/lodw04.htm  4]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexander Montgomerie]], in his ''[[Flyting]]'', described her as:

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 2em"&gt;
Nicnevin with her nymphes, in number anew
With charms from [[Caithness|Caitness]] and Chanrie of Ross
Whose cunning consists in casting a clew.&lt;ref&gt;James Miller, ''St. Baldred of the Bass: a Pictish legend. The siege of Berwick: a tragedy: with other poems and ballads founded on the local traditions of East Lothian and Berwickshire'' (Oliver &amp; Boyd, 1824), p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pzmdQTiB09UC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=%22Nicnevin%22+-wikipedia&amp;num=50&amp;cd=22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nicnevin%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false 267]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

Even so, the elder Nicnevin or Gyre-Carling retained the habit of night riding with an "elrich" entourage mounted on unlikely and supernatural steeds.  Another, satirical popular depiction made her leave Scotland after a love-quarrel with her neighbour, to become wife of "[[Muhammad|Mahomyte]]" and queen of the "[[Jew|Jowis]]". She was an enemy of [[Christianity|Christian]] people, and "[[cannibalism|levit vpoun]] Christiane menis flesche"; still, her absence caused dogs to stop barking and hens to stop laying.&lt;ref&gt;David Laing, William Carew Hazlitt, ''Early popular poetry of Scotland and the northern border'' (Reeves and Turner, 1895), p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=b8hCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=%22Nicnevin%22+Montgomery&amp;num=50&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nicnevin%22%20Montgomery&amp;f=false 18]&lt;/ref&gt;  But in [[Fife]], the Gyre-Carling was associated with spinning and [[knitting]], like [[Habetrot]]; here it was believed to be unlucky to leave a piece of knitting unfinished at the New Year, lest the Gyre-Carling should steal it.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, above, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Oregon Geographic Names''''' is a compilation of the origin and meaning of [[toponym|place names]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]], published by the [[Oregon Historical Society]].   The book was originally published in 1928.  It was compiled and edited by [[Lewis A. McArthur]]. {{As of|2011}}, the book is in its seventh edition, which was compiled and edited by Lewis L. McArthur&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Lewis' grandfather was [[Oregon Supreme Court]] justice [[Lewis Linn McArthur]].&lt;/ref&gt; (who died in 2018).

== Content ==

In its introduction, it identifies six periods in the [[History of Oregon|history of the state]] which have contributed to the establishment of local names:
* The thousands of years of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] life;
* The period of [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]], [[British colonization of the Americas|British]], [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] and [[History of the United States|early American]] exploration, with arrivals by sea and overland, exemplified by the activities of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]];
* The [[Oregon pioneer history|pioneer period]], up to and particularly including the days of the [[Oregon Trail]];
* The period of [[American Indian Wars#Pacific Northwest|Indian Wars]] and mining claims inspired by the [[California Gold Rush]] and later facilitated by the [[Mining Act of 1872]];
* The period of [[Homestead principle|homesteading]] between 1875 and 1925, which affected nine million acres (36,000&amp;nbsp;km²); and
* The modern period of [[neologism]]s

The seventh edition contains 6,252 entries, with references to another 2,679 names scattered throughout the text.&lt;ref&gt;McArthur, Lewis A. and Lewis L.

'''''Original Local:  Indigenous Foods, Stories and Recipes from the Upper Midwest''''' is a [[recipe]]/collage book written by [[Heid E. Erdrich]], published by the [[Minnesota Historical Society |MN Historical Society Press]] in [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota (state)|Minnesota]].  Heid E. Sherman is a member of the [[North Dakota]] [[Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians | Turtle Mountain Band]] of the [[Ojibwe]] people (and also half German) who is currently based in South Minneapolis. Her cookbook explores [[native american cuisine]] and indigenous ingredients, within a globally-aware framework that includes stories, recollections and anecdotes.&lt;ref name=Headlee&gt;{{cite magazine| last1=Headlee |first1=Celeste |authorlink= | title=’ ‘In ‘Original Local,’ Thanksgiving Recipes from The First Americans| url=https://www.npr.org/2013/11/21/246552273/original-local-thanksgiving-recipes-from-the-first-americans/ |work= ''[[NPR]] |date=November 21, 2013 |accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Goetzman&gt;{{cite magazine| last1=Goetzman |first1=Amy |authorlink=Amy Goetzman | title= ‘Heid Erdrich’s Native Cookbook is pure poetry’ |url=https://www.minnpost.com/books/2013/11/heid-erdrich-s-native-cookbook-pure-poetry/ |work= ''[[MinnPost]] |date=November 22, 2013 |accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garland&gt;{{cite magazine| last1=Garland |first1=John |authorlink=John Garland (writer) | title= ‘Original Local by Heid Erdrich’ |url=http://heavytable.com/original-local-heid-erdrich/|work= ''Heavy Table|date=December 18, 2013 |accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Dooley&gt;{{cite magazine| last1=Dooley |first1=Beth |authorlink=Beth Dooley | title= ‘Heid Erdrich writes of the original American cooks: Local ingredients get the spotlight in a new book from poet Heid Erdrich|url=http://www.startribune.com/heid-erdrich-writes-of-the-original-american-cooks/232704691/|work= [[Star Tribune| StarTribune]]|date=November 20, 2013 |accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
''Original Local'' grew out of the “locavore” movement—the push to buy and consume locally grown food. Heid noticed that, in all the enthusiasm in the Midwest within that movement, there was a complete lack of awareness about the foods' indigenous origins. She started working with the Minnesota Historical Society Press on a project to address that gap, and that grew into this complete work. &lt;ref name=Goetzman&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garland&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dooley&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Other work in this 'return to healthy indigenous eating' space includes ''Foods of the Americas: Native Recipes and Traditions'' written by husband/wife team Fernando Divina  and Marlene Divina and published by Smithsonian [[National Museum of the American Indian]] when it opened in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1= |first1= |authorlink= | title=Foods of the Americas: Native Recipes and Traditions |url= http://www.oyate.org/index.php/component/hikashop/product/621-foods-of-the-americas-native-recipes-and-traditions?Itemid=177/|work= Oyate |date= |accessdate=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1=Batz |first1=Bob |authorlink=Bob Batz, Jr | title=’Foods of the Americas: Native Recipes and Traditions’ |url= http://www.post-gazette.com/food/2011/03/03/Foods-of-the-Americas-Native-Recipes-and-Traditions/stories/201103030724/|work= [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date= March 3, 2011|accessdate=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Sioux Chef's Indigenous Kitchen]]'' by Sean Sherman and Beth Dooley in 2017, a 2006 Television Series called 'Seasoned With Spirit: A Native Cook’s Journey with Loretta Barrett Oden',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last1= |first1= |authorlink= | title=’Seasoned With Spirit: A Native Cook’s Journey with Loretta Barrett Oden’ |url=http://www.pbs.org/food/shows/seasoned-with-spirit/|work=[[PBS]] |date= |accessdate=January 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; organizations including [[Native Seeds/SEARCH]] and the International Institute of Indigenous Science-Indigenous Permaculture, and various groups focusing on sustainable agriculture.

==Cuisine==
The cookbook also takes some poetic license with the concepts of authentic traditions - Erdrich challenges limitations and incorporates dynamic, contemporary ingredients and cooking styles. The book showcases a spectrum of Ojibwe, Ho-Chunk, Menominee, Potawatomi and Mandan gardeners and harvesters; while also incorporating styles and ingredients from other continents. Among the heritage ingredients Erdrich explored are mandaamin (corn) and actual wild rice, which the Anishinaabe people call manoomin - a very different creature from the cultivated, hard black rice that bears the name in stores in the area. "The tastes range from astringent and grassy to smoky and nutty," Erdrich explains. Another is Sumac, "a great seasoning or you can make drinks from it – Indian Kool-Aid, they call it. I love it on popcorn. I say in the book to make a seasoning from sumac and maple sugar, put it in a shaker, and use it on everything." &lt;ref name=Garland&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LeMay&gt;{{cite magazine| last1=LeMay |first1=Konnie |authorlink=Konnie LeMay | title= ‘Poet Heid Erdrich Turns Talents to a Cultural Cookbook Celebrating Indigenous Foods’|url=https://indiancountrymedianetwork.com/culture/health-wellness/poet-heid-erdrich-turns-talents-to-a-cultural-cookbook-celebrating-indigenous-foods/|work= [[Indian Country Media Network| Indian Country Today]]| date=November 26, 2013 |accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pollack&gt;{{cite magazine| last1=Pollack |first1=Oliver B. |authorlink=Oliver B.

Erdrich also looks at the geo-political context of the ingredients she includes when relevant. The topic of freshwater fish includes a discussion of "shifts in climate and threats to water purity as it reveals the deep relationship between Ojibwe people and indigenous fish species such as Ginoozhii, the Muskie, Ogaa, the Walleye, and Adikamig, Whitefish."&lt;ref name= &gt;{{cite web| last1= |first1= |authorlink= | title= ‘Original Local: Indigenous Foods, Stories, and Recipes from the Upper Midwest|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/658541/summary| work= Portage District Library| date= |accessdate=January 7, 2018| page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Coming from a family of writers (including her sister, [[Louise Erdrich]] - renowned contemporary Native American writer) Heid is primarily a poet. ''Original Local'''s chapters are structured by food groups, but within that structure the content is more of a collage. Each recipe's 'headnote' incorporates Heid's poetic writing style, and there are essays, interviews, cooking tips and notes throughout. “Writing about cooking is a lot like poetry to me – interesting and emotional and evocative and condensed. So is cooking itself … themes and carrying certain flavors and matching things together," says Erdrich &lt;ref name=Goetzman&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Garland&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dooley&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LeMay&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reese&gt;{{cite magazine| last1=Reese |first1=Debbie |authorlink=Debbie Reese | title= ‘Original Local: Indigenous Foods, Stories and Recipes from the Upper Midwest|url=https://americanindiansinchildrensliterature.blogspot.com/2013/11/original-local-indigenous-foods-stories.html|work= American Indians in Children’s Literature Blog| date=November 21, 2013 |accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
From a [[Madison, Wisconsin | Madison]], [[Wisconsin]] publication, "Poet Heid E. Erdrich does not consider herself a cook or even a foodie, but you wouldn’t know it by the appetizing recipes and edifying tales in her salute to the native foods of the Great Lakes and Great Plains." &lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite magazine| last1=Allen |first1=Terese |authorlink=Terese Allen | title= ‘Eat Their Words: A Round-Up of 2013 Food Titles’|url=http://ediblemadison.com/articles/view/eat-their-words-a-round-up-of-recent-food-titles/c/full/| work= Edible Madison| date=December 13, 2013 |accessdate=January 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver Pollack of ''Mid West Review'' describes Heid's creations as 'fusion recipes combining local sources and lore, and twenty-first-century palates..'.&lt;ref name=Pollack&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In including ''Original Local''  in its 2014 ''10 Best Local Cookbooks and Food Guides'' list, [[Minneapolis]] [[City Pages]] called it, "a soulful cookbook for the Midwestern heart."&lt;ref name=Kimbler &gt;{{cite web| last1=Kimbler |first1=Tammy |authorlink=Tammy Kimbler | title= ‘10 Best Local Cookbooks and Food Guides’|url=http://www.citypages.com/restaurants/10-best-local-cookbooks-and-food-guides-6598312| work= CityPages| date=December 11, 2014 |accessdate=January 7, 2018| page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Producers Library was founded in 1957, when the "librarians at —[[RKO]] and [[MGM]]—decided to form their own company".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slide |first=Anthony |date=1992 |title=Nitrate Won't Wait: A History of Film Preservation in the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HZIq5-_hu5cC |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |page=142 |isbn=0-7864-0836-7 |access-date=March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[archival footage]] from Producers Library has been used in major [[Hollywood]] [[feature films]] such as the intro to ''[[L.A. Confidential]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dargis |first=Manohla |date=2003 |title=L.A.

They provided vintage stock footage shots for the [[HBO]] film ''[[Hemingway &amp; Gellhorn]]'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.studentfilmmakers.com/news/Producers_Library_Stock_Footage.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; which the filmmakers used to place actors [[Clive Owen]] and [[Nicole Kidman]] in with the help of a [[green screen]].

'''''Re AIC Merchant Finance Ltd (in rec)'''''
[1990] 2 NZLR 385  (1990) 5 NZCLC 66,153
is a cited case in New Zealand regarding relief for Illegal Contracts under the [[Illegal Contracts Act 1970]]  where validation is not legally possible.&lt;ref name="Chetwin, Graw, Tiong"&gt;{{cite book |title=An introduction to the Law of Contract in New Zealand |edition=4th |last1=Chetwin |first1=Maree |last2=Graw |first2=Stephen |last3=Tiong |first3=Raymond |publisher=Thomson Brookers |ISBN=0-86472-555-8 |year=2006 |page=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Contract |edition=4th |last1=Walker |first1=Campbell |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71770-X|year=2004 |page=164-165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
AIC was a finance company that collapsed in 1986. National Mutual were the trustees for the secured debentured holders.
However, briefly between 30 May - 17 July 1986, AIC had not registered with the companies office its new prospectus (no. 3), which was a breach of section 37 of the Securities Act 1978.
This technical oversight left the 38 investors that invested $820,000 during this period being unsecured creditors when the company was placed into receivership on 30 August 1986.
National Mutual filed for an order for validation  in the High Court, which was refused.

==Held==
The Court of Appeal again refused validation, as the Securities Act expressly prohibited validation.  Richardson J said "[Section] 7 cannot be employed to negate the effect of a provision of the Securities Act. That would be inconsistent with the protection afforded by s 4. It follows that an allotment which is invalid under s 37(4) cannot be validated under s 7."
However, as the Securities Act only prohibited validation, and not any other forms of relief, the court granted relief in the form of damages, which was similar to if validation had been granted, effectively granting validation via the back door.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2299">In '''''S v Maki''''', an important case in [[South African]] [[criminal law]], the accused had consciously broken into the home of the deceased, an 84-year-old woman, and thereafter, in a drunken state, strangled her. He had previous convictions for possession of [[Cannabis (drug)|dagga]], assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, attempted rape and theft. He was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment. Jones J said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The accused is not a youngster who, for the first time, had too much to drink and dabbled with dagga. On the contrary, he has a criminal record for violent acts and for involvement with dagga. Through his counsel he admits to longstanding serious substance abuse. His character is malformed. He lacks discipline. This sort of thing could happen G to him again. In a case such as this the interests of society must prevail over the interests of the individual offender.&lt;ref&gt;420a-b.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As to the question of capacity, Jones J said the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is perhaps worthwhile therefore to speculate on the possible sentences which would have been imposed or considered if the accused had killed the deceased with full criminal capacity. If he had had less liquor to drink and if he had been sufficiently in command of his faculties to be convicted of murder, his intake of alcohol might have been a mitigating factor. He might also have been able to point to other mitigating factors in explaining what happened inside the flat. But the many aggravating factors, which are self-evident, would have made the death penalty one of the options to be given serious consideration. If the Court had come to the conclusion that the death sentence was not the only proper sentence, the other options of imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a lengthy term of 20 or 25 years would have been considered. It is my view that it is extremely unlikely that a sentence of less than 20 years would have been imposed for this kind of murder.&lt;ref&gt;417f-h.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''S v Zuma and Others''''' was the first case decided by the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]] after it was established in 1995. The case dealt with a provision of the [[Criminal Procedure Act, 1977|Criminal Procedure Act]] which required the defence in criminal cases to prove that a confession made before a [[Magistrate's Court (South Africa)|magistrate]] was coerced, rather than requiring the state to prove that it was not coerced. The court held that this [[reverse onus]] provision was unconstitutional because it violated the [[right to a fair trial]] under section 25 of the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa|Interim Constitution]].

'''''Saludos Amigos''''' (Spanish for "Greetings, Friends") is a 1942 American [[Live-action animated film|live-action animated]] [[anthology film|package film]] produced by [[Walt Disney]] and released by [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]]. It is the sixth [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]] and the first of the six package films produced by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Productions]] in the 1940s. Set in Latin America, it is made up of four different segments; [[Donald Duck]] stars in two of them and [[Goofy]] stars in one. It also features the first appearance of [[José Carioca]], the Brazilian cigar-smoking parrot.&lt;ref name=grupo&gt;''[[Walt &amp; El Grupo]]'' (documentary film, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Saludos Amigos'' premiered in [[Rio de Janeiro]] on August 24, 1942. It was released in the United States on February 6, 1943. ''Saludos Amigos'' was popular enough that Walt Disney decided to make another film about Latin America, ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'', to be produced two years later. At 42 minutes, it is Disney's shortest animated feature to date.

==Background==
[[File:OCIAA-Nelson-Rockefeller.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs|Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] (1940)]]
In early 1941, before U.S. entry into [[World War II]], the [[United States Department of State]] commissioned a Disney goodwill tour of South America, intended to lead to a movie to be shown in the US, [[Central America|Central]], and South America as part of the [[Good Neighbor Policy]]. This was being done because several Latin American governments had close ties with [[Nazi Germany]],&lt;ref name=grupo/&gt; and the US government wanted to counteract those ties. [[Mickey Mouse]] and other Disney characters were popular in Latin America, and Walt Disney acted as ambassador. The tour, facilitated by [[Nelson Rockefeller]], who had recently been appointed as [[Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs|Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]] (CIAA), took Disney and a group of roughly twenty composers, artists, technicians, etc. from his studio to South America, mainly to [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]], but also to [[Chile]] and [[Peru]].&lt;ref name="Dale2007"&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Adams

The film itself was given federal loan guarantees, because the Disney studio had over-expanded just before European markets were closed to them by the war, and because Disney was struggling with labor unrest at the time (including [[Disney animators' strike|a strike that was underway]] at the time the goodwill journey began).&lt;ref name=grupo/&gt;

The film included live-action documentary sequences featuring footage of modern Latin American cities with skyscrapers and fashionably dressed residents. This surprised many contemporary US viewers, who associated such images only with US and European cities, and contributed to a changing impression of Latin America.&lt;ref name=Dale2007/&gt; Film historian Alfred Charles Richard Jr. has commented that ''Saludo Amigos'' "did more to cement a community of interest between peoples of the Americas in a few months than the State Department had in fifty years".&lt;ref&gt;Richard, Alfred Charles Jr. Censorship and Hollywood's Hispanic Image: An Interpretive Filmography, 1936–1955.

The film also inspired Chilean cartoonist [[René Ríos Boettiger]] to create [[Condorito]], one of Latin America's most ubiquitous cartoon characters. Ríos perceived that the character ''Pedro'', a small, incapable airplane, was a slight to Chileans and created a comic that could supposedly rival Disney's comic characters.

== Film segments ==
This film features four different segments, each of which begin with various clips of the Disney artists roaming the country, drawing cartoons of some of the local cultures and scenery.

=== ''Lake Titicaca'' ===
In this segment, American tourist [[Donald Duck]] visits [[Lake Titicaca]] and meets some of the locals, including an obstinate [[llama]].

=== ''Pedro'' ===
''Pedro'' involves the title character, a small anthropomorphic airplane from an airport near [[Santiago]], Chile, engaging in his very first flight to pick up [[air mail]] from [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], with disastrous results occurring when near [[Aconcagua]], and again while chasing a [[vulture]] on the return journey. And to make matters worse, Pedro gets caught in a terrible storm! But, he makes it back to the airfield safe and sound with the mail, revealed to only be a single postcard. This segment was later released theatrically as an independent short, on May 13, 1955 by [[RKO Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://affichesdisney.canalblog.com/archives/pedro/index.html|accessdate=December 3, 2010|title=Pedro|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disappointed with Pedro as the image that the outside world had of Chile, cartoonist [[René Ríos Boettiger]] (known popularly as "Pepo") started one of the most famous Latin American comic magazines: ''[[Condorito]]''.

=== ''El Gaucho Goofy'' ===
In this segment, American [[cowboy]] [[Goofy]] gets taken mysteriously to the [[Argentina|Argentinian]] [[pampa]]s to learn the ways of the native [[gaucho]]. This segment was later edited for the film's Gold Classic Collection VHS/DVD release to remove one scene in which Goofy is shown smoking a [[cigarette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gerald Wurm |url=http://www.schnittberichte.com/schnittbericht.php?ID=1996 |title=Mehr als 4000 detaillierte Zensurberichte zu Filmen, Spielen, Comics, Serien und Musikvideos |publisher=Schnittberichte.com |date=May 15, 2008 |accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This edit appears again on the Classic Caballeros Collection DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatedisney.com/classiccaballeroscollection.html |title=Saludos Amigos &amp; The Three Caballeros: Classic Caballeros Collection DVD Review |publisher=Ultimatedisney.com |date= |accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sequence has since been restored as many fans have asked for the unedited version.

=== ''Aquarela do Brasil'' ===
''Aquarela do Brasil'' (Portuguese for "Watercolor of Brazil"), the finale of the film, involves a brand-new character, [[José Carioca]] from [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, showing Donald Duck around South America, having a drink of [[cachaça]] with him and introducing him to the [[samba]] (to the tunes of "[[Aquarela do Brasil|Brazil]]" and "[[Tico-Tico no Fubá]]").

== Soundtrack ==
The film's original score was composed by [[Edward H. Plumb]], [[Paul Smith (composer)|Paul J. Smith]], and [[Charles Wolcott]]. The title song, "Saludos Amigos", was written for the film by Charles Wolcott and [[Ned Washington]]. The film also featured the song "[[Aquarela do Brasil]]", written by the popular Brazilian songwriter [[Ary Barroso]] and performed by [[Aloísio de Oliveira]], and an instrumental version of "[[Tico-Tico no Fubá]]", written by [[Zequinha de Abreu]]. "Aquarela do Brasil" was written and first performed in 1939, but did not achieve much initial success. However, after appearing in this film it became an international hit, becoming the first Brazilian song to be played over a million times on American radio.

The film's soundtrack was first released by [[Decca Records]] in 1944 as a collection of three 78rpm singles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4794">'''Thomas Elphinstone Hambledon''' ('''Tommy Hambledon''') is the fictional protagonist of many spy novels written by the British author "[[Manning Coles]]" (actually the two-person writing team of Adelaide Frances Oke Manning and Cyril Henry Coles) from 1940 through 1963.  He works for a department of the [[Foreign Office]], usually referred to in the novels as "[[MI5]]" ([[counter-intelligence]]), although in the earliest books he is clearly working for the active overseas department [[MI6]], the British equivalent of the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]]/[[CIA]].&lt;ref name=RueMorgue&gt;{{cite web |first1=Tom |last1=Schantz |first2=Enid |last2=Schantz |url=http://www.ruemorguepress.com/authors/coles.html |title=Manning Coles |publisher=Rue Morgue Press |date=January 2008 |accessdate=2014-04-08 |quote=broken link |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929022840/http://www.ruemorguepress.com/authors/coles.html |archivedate=2012-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character background==
Tommy was a teacher in a British boarding school in his first appearance in ''[[Drink to Yesterday]]'' and, during school vacations, a spy in [[Germany]] for the [[Foreign Office]]. At the end of this book, which takes place in [[World War I]] and in which he is known only as Tommy Hambledon, he disappears at sea and is presumed dead.  He reappears as the hero of the next book, ''[[Pray Silence]]'' (known in the U.S. by the title ''[[Toast to Tomorrow]]''), which begins in the 1920s.  He is an amnesiac in Germany who gradually works his way up in the fledgling [[Nazi Party]] until, in 1933, he becomes [[Hitler]]'s Chief of Police.  He recovers his memory the night of the Reichstag fire, and thereafter battles to defeat Hitler and his plans. And his full name is revealed to be Thomas Elphinstone Hambledon. At the end of the book he fakes his own death in Danzig (Hitler himself reads the oration at his 'funeral') and stows away with his colleague, Alfred Reck, on a British cargo ship bound for Cardiff. On their return to Britain he and Reck are faced with the problem of a series of unexplained sinkings of ships not long out of harbour in Portsmouth in ''[[They Tell No Tales]]''.

In ''[[Green Hazard]]'' the Gestapo mistake him for Professor Ulseth, inventor of a new and extremely powerful high explosive, and kidnap him. He then finds himself once again in Berlin where he has to fool his 'hosts' into believing that he actually knows something about chemistry whilst praying that they will fail to recognise a former colleague. After [[World War II]], he continued his career in the Foreign Office and helped defeat a number of [[Communist]] plots. In these later adventures, he was frequently aided by [[Forgan and Campbell]], a semi-comic team of [[Hobby shop|model-makers]] from the [[Clerkenwell Road]] in [[London]], who first appear in ''A Brother for Hugh''. In this and some other of Manning Coles' subsequent novels Hambledon actually occupies quite a minor role - in ''[[The Man in the Green Hat]]'' he hardly appears at all in the first half of the book.

Cyril Coles himself was an avid model maker and was, at the time of his death, building a train set from scratch for his young grandson.  Like so many other things in the background of Hambledon, the similarity with Cyril Coles's life is close.

==In popular culture==
In the season four premiere episode of ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'', the titular secret agent character is similarly suffering from amnesia, believing himself to be the titular hamburger chef character of the animated series ''[[Bob's Burgers]]''. (Both titular characters are voiced by [[H. Jon Benjamin]].) The "daily special" on the menu board is "Thomas Elphinstone Hambledurger with Manning Coleslaw".

'''''Tohu wa-bohu''''' ({{lang|he|תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ}}), is a [[Biblical Hebrew]] phrase found in the  [[Genesis creation narrative]] ([[Genesis 1:2]]) that describes the condition of the earth ([[:wikt:ארץ|eretz]]) 
immediately before the creation of [[light]] in [[Genesis 1:3]]. 

Numerous interpretations of this phrase are made by various theological sources.
The [[KJV]] translation of the phrase is "without form, and void", corresponding to [[LXX]]

:''Genesis 1:2, ([[Westminster Leningrad Codex]])''&lt;ref&gt; "[http://www.tanach.us/Tanach.xml?Gen1:2-1:2 Genesis  1:2 בראשית]", ''Tanach: Unicode/XML Westminster Leningrad Codex'', transcribed by Christopher V. Kimball.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the spirit of God was hovering over the waters.
:''Genesis 1:2, English translation ([[New International Version]])''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BibleGateway.com: A searchable online Bible in over 150 versions and 50 languages.|url=http://www.biblegateway.com|website=www.biblegateway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The words ''tohu'' and ''bohu'' also occur in parallel in Isaiah 34:11, where [[King James Version]] translates with the words "confusion" and "emptiness". 

The two Hebrew words are properly [[segolate]]s, spelled ''tohuw'' and ''bohuw''.&lt;ref name=Gesenius&gt;[[Wilhelm Gesenius]], ''A Hebrew and English Lexicon'' (1906).&lt;/ref&gt;
Hebrew ''tohuw'' translates to "wasteness, that which is laid waste, desert; emptiness, vanity; nothing".&lt;ref&gt;''Strong's Concordance'' [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H8414&amp;t=KJV H8414]&lt;/ref&gt;
''tohuw'' is frequently used in [[Isaiah]] in the sense of "vanity", but ''bohuw'' occurs nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible (outside of Genesis 1:2, the passage in  Isaiah 34:11 mentioned above,&lt;ref&gt;''Strong's Concordance'' [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H922&amp;t=KJV H922]&lt;/ref&gt; and in Jeremiah 4:23, which is a reference to Genesis 1:2), its use alongide ''tohu'' being mere [[paronomasia]], and is given the equivalent translation of "emptiness, voidness".&lt;ref name=Gesenius/&gt;

== Interpretation ==
&lt;!--Precise translation of the phrase is difficult, since it is a Hebrew wordplay, like ''ve-ha-oniyyah hishevah le-hishaver'' in [[Book of Jonah|Jonah]] 1:4.{{huh|date=March 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Everett Fox | contribution=BIBLE | title=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] | edition=2nd | volume=3 | year=2007 | publisher=Gale | pages=572–640|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
"hishevah le-hishaver" ("was like to be broken") is a phonological play on two unrelated roots, for "to think" and "to break".
Explain how this is in any way parallel to paronomasia of "tohu wa-bohu" beyond the trivial observation that "the Hebrew Bible often uses playful language".--&gt;

In the early rabbinical period, the verse was a point of contention regarding the question of ''[[creatio ex nihilo]]''.
In [[Genesis Rabbah]] 1:14, [[Rabbi Akiva]] refutes  [[Gnosis|gnostic]] and other heretical views that matter existed primordially and that God alone did not create the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author = Louis Isaac Rabinowitz | author2=Seymour Feldman | author3=Yehoyada Amir | entry=CREATION AND COSMOGONY IN THE BIBLE | title=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] | edition=2nd | volume=5 | year=2007 | publisher=Gale | pages=273–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Genesis Rabbah 2:2, rabbis [[Abbahu]] and Judah b. Simon give analogies in which ''tohu wa-bohu'' means "bewildered and astonished" (mentally formless and void), referring to the Earth's confusion after, having been created simultaneously with the Heavens in Genesis 1:1, it now immediately plays an inferior role.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Midrash Rabbah]]: Genesis, Volume One'', translated by Rabbi Dr. [[Harry Freedman (rabbi)|H. Freedman]]; London: Soncino Press, 1983; {{ISBN|0-900689-38-2}}; p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abraham bar Hiyya]] (12th century) was the first to interpret the ''tohu'' and ''bohu'' of Gen. 1:2 as meaning "matter" and "form", and the same idea appears in [[Bahir]] 2.9–10.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=K. Schubert | contribution=CABALA | title=[[New Catholic Encyclopedia]] | edition=2nd | volume=2 | publisher=Gale | year=2003 | pages=831–836}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Possibly related{{huh|date=March 2018}} is the  ''Yesod hapashut'' ("simple element") in the [[Kabbalah]], in which "everything is united as one, without differentiation".&lt;ref&gt;[[Chaim Kramer]], ''Anatomy of the soul'', [[Breslov Research Institute]], [[Jerusalem]]/[[New York City]] 1998 {{ISBN|0-930213-51-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tronoša chronicle''' ({{lang-sr|Троношки летопис; Троношки родослов}}) is a [[Serbian language|Serbian]] chronicle dating to 1526,&lt;ref name="Новаковић1871"&gt;{{cite book|author=Стојан Новаковић|title=Историја српске књижевности: преглед угађан за школску потребу|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnZcAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA79|year=1871|publisher=Издание и штампа Државне штампарије|page=79|quote= летописима може се додати летопис Троношки писан прошлога века (1781) по ориђиналу писану ХVI века (1526), штампан у Гласнику V. }}&lt;/ref&gt; transcribed by Orthodox [[hieromonk]] Josif Tronošac (Троношац) in 1791&lt;ref name="Novak1930"&gt;{{cite book|last=Novak|first=Viktor|authorlink=Viktor Novak|title=Antologija jugoslovenske misli i narodnog jedinstva: (1390-1930)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qnJpAAAAMAAJ|year=1930|publisher=Selbstverl|page=xviii|quote=Tronoški letopis koji je 1791 napisao Jeromonah Josif ima naslov: »Rodoslovije serbskoe ili iliričeskoe«.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Milenković1967"&gt;{{cite book|last=Milenković|first=Buda|title=Tragom velikih Jugoslovena: (Reportaže iz rodnih mesta naših velikana).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SYUNAQAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Izdaje autor Buda Milenković|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Tronoša monastery]] near [[Loznica]], in western [[Serbia]]. The Tronoša manuscript is the oldest survived copy, of which there are several transcriptions, one of them transcribed by Serafim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zbornik Matice srpske za književnost i jezik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRU_AQAAIAAJ|year=1974|publisher=Matica srpska|page=578}}&lt;/ref&gt; A copy is held at the monastery, while the original manuscript by Josif is held in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banjesrbije.net/index.php/banje-srbije/banje-zapadne-srbije/banja-koviljaca/159-rekreacija-i-izletista|title=Banja Koviljača - Rekreacija i izletišta|publisher=banjesrbije.net|accessdate=15 April 2015|language=Serbian|quote=Crkva u manastiru obnovljena je 1599. godine, a u njemu je monah Josif napisao poznati Tronoški letopis čija se kopija čuva u manastiru, a orginal u Beču.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chronicle includes [[hagiographies]] of Serbian rulers.

A '''vision statement''' is a declaration of an [[organization]]'s objectives, intended to guide its internal [[decision-making]].&lt;ref name=businessdictionary&gt;{{cite web |title=What is a vision statement? definition and meaning |website=BusinessDictionary |publisher=WebFinance Inc. |url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/vision-statement.html|accessdate = 2015-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A vision statement is not limited to business organizations and may also be used by non-profit or governmental entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ozdem|first1=Guven|title=An Analysis of the Mission and Vision Statements on the Strategic Plans of Higher Education Institutions|journal=Educational Sciences: Theory and Practice|date=Autumn 2011|volume=11 |issue=4|pages=1887-1894|issn=1303-0485|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ962679.pdf|format=PDF|id=[[Education Resources Information Center|ERIC]] [https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ962679 EJ962679] |accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and structure==
A vision statement is a company's road map, indicating what the company wants to become and guiding transformational initiatives by setting a defined direction for the company's growth. Vision statements undergo minimal revisions during the life of a business, unlike operational goals which may be updated from year-to-year.  Vision statements can range in length from short sentences to multiple pages.  Vision statements are also formally written and referenced in company documents rather than, for example, general principles informally articulated by senior management.&lt;ref name=Lipton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipton|first=Mark|title=Demystifying the Development of an Organizational Vision|journal=Sloan Management Review|date=Summer 1996|volume=37|issue=4|page=83|url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/23463272/2139850325/name/Demystifying+the+Development+of+an+Organizational+Vision.pdf|accessdate=2015-08-15|format=PDF download}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consensus does not exist on the characteristics of a "good" or "bad" vision statement.  Commonly cited traits include:&lt;ref name=Kantrabutra&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kantabutra|first1=Sooksan|last2=Avery|first2=Gayle|title=The power of vision: statements that resonate|journal=Journal of Business Strategy|date=2010|volume=31|issue=1|pages=37–45|url=http://www.collegeofmanagement.mahidol.ac.th/research/images/VisionstatementsJBS.pdf|doi=10.1108/02756661011012769}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* concise: able to be easily remembered and repeated
* clear: defines a prime [[goal]]
* Time horizon: defines a time horizon
* future-oriented: describes where the company is going rather than the current state
* stable: offers a long-term perspective and is unlikely to be impacted by market or technology changes
* challenging: not something that can be easily met and discarded
* abstract: general enough to encompass all of the organization's interests and strategic direction
* inspiring: motivates employees and is something that employees view as desirable

==Purpose==
Vision statements may fill the following functions for a company:&lt;ref name=Lipton /&gt;
* Serve as foundations for a broader [[strategic plan]]
* Motivate existing employees and attract potential employees by clearly categorizing the company's goals and attracting like-minded individuals
* Focus company efforts and facilitate the creation of [[core competencies]] by directing the company to only focus on strategic opportunities that advance the company's vision
* Help companies differentiate from competitors. For example, profit is a common business goal, and vision statements typically describe how a company will become profitable rather than list profit directly as the long-term vision

===Relevance===
While a consensus does not exist on the value of mission and vision statements, literature supporting the relevance of these documents to companies outweighs those opposed to them.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} This may be due to, among other reasons, the positive value of the tools in communicating to internal and external stakeholders or retrospective attempts to legitimize the use of these tools.

==Challenges==
Creating and implementing vision statements presents challenges to organizations.  They can be challenging to write because they must balance being forward-looking and describing an ideal state without becoming so idealistic that the vision is unattainable. Vision statements can be an employee dissatisfier when staff feel the company's vision is filled with business [[buzzword]]s unrelated to the company's services or when the vision does not match day-to-day company policy; for example, a vision statement that includes root cause problem solving while managers are rewarded for fixing problems quickly rather than resolving systemic issues.&lt;ref name=Lipton /&gt; A vision statement may need to be paired with company initiatives to communicate and reinforce the vision, ensure processes align with the vision, and empower and incentivize employees to take actions that support the company vision.&lt;ref name=Kantrabutra /&gt;

A '''''Wappenbüchlein''''' ("little [[armorial]]", ''libellus scutorum'') was published by [[Virgil Solis]] in 1555, printed in [[Nuremberg]].
The title page introduces the work as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Zu Ehren der Kay. und Kö. Mt., auch Bäpstlicher Heyligkeit, sambt anderer der Furnembsten auslendischen Kunigreichen, Churfürsten, Fürsten und gemeinen stenden, darauf des Heyligen Romischen Reichs grundveste gepflantzt unnd geordnet ist, Sovil derselben wappen zu bekhumen sind gewesen mit Iren namen und farben, Durch Virgil Solis Maler und Bürger zu Nürnberg, mit sonderm fleys gemacht''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In English:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In honour of his imperial and royal majesty, and also his Holiness the pope, including some of the most noble foreign kingdoms, the prince-electors, princes and common [[Estates of the realm|estates]] on which  the foundation of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] is planted and ordered, as many as have been available with their names and [[tincture|colours]], by Virgil Solis, painter and burgher in Nuremberg, compiled with assiduity.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After presenting the imperial coat of arms, the royal coat of arms of [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] and those of the Habsburg territories at the time ([[kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Croatia]], [[Slavonia]], [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]], [[kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]], [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], [[Styria]], [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthia]], [[Carniola]], [[Duchy of Luxembourg|Luxembourg]], [[Duchy of Swabia|Swabia]], [[Duchy of Württemberg|Württemberg]], [[Burgau]], [[Moravia]], [[Habsburg, Switzerland|Habsburg]], [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]], [[Pfirt]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Kyburg County|de|3=Grafschaft Kyburg|lt=Kyburg}}, [[Alsace]], [[Windic March]], [[Portenau]]).

This is followed by the arms of "twelve kingdoms under the Roman Christian monarchy", viz. [[kingdom of Germany|Germany]], [[kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]], [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Poland]], [[kingdom of France|France]], [[kingdom of Sweden|Sweden]], 
[[kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]], [[kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], 
[[Habsburg Spain|Spain]], [[kingdom of England|England]], [[kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] and [[kingdom of Naples|Naples]].
Solis goes on to present "the three earliest coats of arms in the world", which he makes out to be those of ''[[Abishai (biblical figure)|Abysey]]'', ''Ganameus'' and ''Sabiey'',{{clarify|date=October 2011}} and those of the [[Three Magi]], ''Caspar, Balthaser, Melcher''.  Then there follow the arms of "foreign" kingdoms, partly fictional (including [[Gog and Magog]]).

Only after this follow the princely arms of the Holy Roman Empire: at first the seven [[prince-electors]],  followed by  a presentation of four coats of arms of the hierarchy of  "members" (''glider'') of the empire, in the order of [[Herzog|dukes]], [[margrave]]s, [[burgrave]]s, [[landgrave]]s, [[Graf (title)|counts]], [[knight]]s,  [[imperial city|cities]] (''stet''), villages  (''dorffer'') and peasants (''pavrn''). Then there follows a fuller index of the arms of dukes, counts, [[Freiherr|baron]]s, and knights.

The next section is dedicated to the arms of the Roman Catholic clergy, beginning with the [[Holy See]], followed by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]], [[archbishop]]s and [[bishop]]s.

The book concludes with a page showing the arms of [[Nuremberg]], and a short apology by the author, in which he asks the reader to correct possible mistakes.

Professor '''Ya'akov Meshorer''' (August 14, 1935 &amp;ndash; June 23, 2004) was the Chief [[Curator]] for [[archaeology]] at the [[Israel Museum]] in [[Jerusalem]] and a prominent Israeli  [[numismatist]].

==Early life==
Known to colleagues and friends as 'Yankele', Meshorer was born in Jerusalem in 1935 into the prominent Mani family, who had lived in the area for centuries. He and his twin brother Asher used to find ancient coins as they played around the city, which was in the process of being built up. The 14-year-old twins donated the coins they had found to the Israel Department of Antiquities in 1949.&lt;ref name=ANS&gt;[http://ansmagazine.com/summer04/meshorer.html American Numismatic Society]&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Israel Defense Forces]] in 1954.

He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in Numismatics in 1971 from the Hebrew University. Meshorer served as a reservist in the Jerusalem Reconnaissance Company and in 1967 was slightly wounded in the [[Six-Day War]].  He later served as an officer in the [[United Nations|UN]] liaison unit.&lt;ref name=ANS/&gt;

==Academic career==
Meshorer was appointed Professor of Numismatics at the [[Hebrew University]] of Jerusalem in 1983. He established the Numismatic Division at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem in 1969, remaining at its head until 1993. He also served as the University's Chief Curator for Archaeology from 1975 to 1982 and from 1990 to 1996. He retired from the Israel Museum in 2000.

Meshorer was a member of the Archaeological Council of the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] and supervised the establishment of two museums devoted to [[Biblical Archaeology]], the museum of the Cleveland Jewish Community Center in 1976, and The Hecht Museum at the [[University of Haifa]] in 1984. He was also a member of the Directorate of the Israel Society for Medals and Coins, serving on the committees that chose the design of the modern [[Israel]]i  coins. He was instrumental in the decision to base the design of many of the modern coins on ancient [[Jew]]ish coinage, in this way linking past and present in the [[State of Israel]].&lt;ref name=ANS/&gt;

He published 19 books and more than 100 articles, almost all of them dealing with the coins of the Holy Land.
