[[File:The Woodhouse Moor Rein - geograph.org.uk - 270765.jpg|thumb|Woodhouse Moor Rein]]
The '''Aberford Dykes''' are a series of [[Archaeology|archaeological]] monuments located around the valley of the [[Cock Beck]], where it runs just north of the village of [[Aberford]] on the border between North and West [[Yorkshire]], [[England]].

The complex consists of three individual [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]; Becca Banks/the Ridge, the South Dyke, and Woodhouse Moor Rein.

==History==

The date and function of the Aberford Dykes are not known for sure.{{sfn|Wheldrake|2011|p=1}} It seems likely that the monuments were built at different times, and possibly for different purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1016954|desc=Linear earthworks known as Woodhouse Moor Rein and South Dyke, part of the Aberford Dyke system|grade=&lt;!--Not applicable for this list entry--&gt;|accessdate=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Becca Banks/the Ridge has a strongly defensive nature, and may have been built to control a ford over the Cock Beck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bogg|first1=Edmund|title=The old kingdom of Elmet, the land ʻtwixt Aire and Wharfe|date=1904|publisher=Bogg|location=York|page=48|oclc=4567990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Becca Banks/the Ridge runs across the [[Roman road]] between [[Castleford]] and [[Tadcaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Storr|first1=Jim|title=King Arthur's wars : the Anglo-Saxon conquest of England|date=2016|publisher=Helion|location=Solihull|isbn=978-1-910777-81-7|page=190|edition=1|chapter=10: Mercia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the sequential relationship between the earthwork and the Roman road is not known. Some argue the monument was built to defend against a Roman invasion and the road was later built right through it. Others argue the monument was built to protect the road, possibly in the '[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]'.
Where subjected to archaeological excavation, the monuments have been found to date from or after the late [[Iron Age]], and it would seem they were silting up during the early Medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aberford conservation area appraisal|url=http://www.leeds.gov.uk/docs/Aberford%20Conservation%20Area%20Appraisal%20and%20Management%20Plan%20(May%202011).pdf|website=leeds.gov.uk|accessdate=13 November 2017|page=5|format=PDF|date=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Becca Banks/the Ridge is the principal [[monument]] in the group. This runs for nearly {{convert|3|mi|0}} on a mostly east-west course along the north side of the Cock Beck valley.{{sfn|Wheldrake|2011|p=1}} It consists of a bank with a [[ditch]] situated on its southern (downslope) side. A slight natural [[Escarpment|scarp slope]] is exploited in the positioning of the bank above the ditch, and the top of the bank would have stood up to {{convert|7.6|m|0|order=flip}} above the base of the ditch.{{sfn|Wheldrake|2011|p=1}}

The other two monuments are located on the south side of the Cock Beck valley, and do not share the strong [[Defense (military)|defensive]] characteristics of Becca Banks/the Ridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{PastScape |num=1035019 |desc=Aberford Dykes |access-date=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the ditch of the South Dyke lies on the upslope side of its bank.{{sfn|Wheldrake|2011|p=2}}

==The Aberford Dykes today==

As [[scheduled monument]]s, the Aberford Dykes are legally protected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scheduled Ancient Monuments|url=http://www.aberford-pc.gov.uk/docs/Neighbourhood%20Plan/NDP%20Reg%2014%20Consultation%202017/Evidence%20Base%20-%20Scheduled%20Monuments%2C%20Listed%20Buildings%26%20Structures%20and%20Positive%20Buildings.pdf|website=aberford-pc.gov.uk|accessdate=13 November 2017|page=1|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; They still have a role in the modern [[landscape]], serving as field boundaries and marking county and parish [[border|boundaries]]. Much of the length of the Aberford Dykes can be walked via the public footpaths that run along them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite map|title =Leeds |map =289 |year =2015 |scale =1;25,000 |series =Explorer |publisher =Ordnance Survey |isbn =9780319244869 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abraham Wheelock'''&lt;ref&gt;There are many variations on his name, including: Wheelock, Whelocke, Whelock, or Wheloc. However, he always uses the spelling of "Wheelock" unless he signs a Latin document where he uses "Whelocus." The alternate spellings of Wheelock's name are used by others.&lt;/ref&gt; (1593 in [[Whitchurch, Shropshire]] &amp;ndash; 1653) was an [[English people|English]] [[linguist]]. He was the first [[Adams Professor of Arabic]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], from around 1632. According to [[Robert Graham Irwin|Robert Irwin]]&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, Robert (2006) ''For Lust of Knowing'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; he regarded it as part of his academic duty to discourage students from taking up the subject. [[Thomas Hyde]] was one of his pupils.

Wheelock was appointed librarian of the "Public Library" (i.e. [[Cambridge University Library]]) in 1629,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Collections|url=http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/near-and-middle-eastern-department/history-collections|publisher=Cambridge University Library|accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also Reader in [[Old English language|Anglo-Saxon]]. In 1632 he oversaw the transferral of [[Thomas van Erpe|Thomas van Erpe's]] collection of oriental books and manuscripts to Cambridge University Library after its purchase by [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers]], which brought with it the first book in Chinese to be added to the Library's collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese Works|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/chinese|website=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced the ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the Old English version of Bede's ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]'' and the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' (1643–4).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Anglo-Saxon Chronicle |volume=2 |first=Charles |last=Plummer |authorlink=Charles Plummer}} (Referred to as "Wheloc")&lt;/ref&gt; In the same work he published an important edition—and the first in England—of [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]]'' in its original Latin text&lt;ref&gt;David C. Douglas, ''English Scholars'' (1939), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; opposite the Old English version, along with Anglo-Saxon laws. Many of the notes in this edition consist of the Old English homilies of [[Aelfric of Eynsham]], which Wheelocke translated himself into Latin. In the following year (1644), London publisher Cornelius Bee put another, enlarged edition out which also included an updated version of William Lambarde's legal text "Archaionomia." This text was likely a collaboration between Wheelock and his friend Sir Roger Twysden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oates|first1=JCT|title=Cambridge University Library: A History|date=1986|publisher=Cambridge UP|location=Cambridge, UK|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated MA from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1618, and became Fellow of [[Clare College, Cambridge]] in 1619.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=WHLK611A|name=Wheelock, Abraham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Dictionary of National Biography''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Shariah Advisory Council===
[[File:SAC Banner.jpg|thumb|Shariah Advisory Council Banner]]
The Arab Chamber established the first [[Shariah Advisory Council]] in Hong Kong, made up of experts in the Islamic code of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=1&amp;art_id=55142&amp;sid=15756465&amp;con_type=1 SAR shariah council formed - The Standard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016011810/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=1&amp;art_id=55142&amp;sid=15756465&amp;con_type=1 |date=2012-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established because of the great of [[Shariah]] compliance of banking services, financial products, and commercial establishments requiring compliance supervision and regulation, and the lack of services that was provided in Hong Kong and China. The Shariah Advisory Council, established by The Chamber, filled that gap and to this day has provided council and regulation for many establishments throughout Hong Kong and China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/hk-s-islamic-new-year-191901.html HK’s Islamic New Year - Banking &amp; Finance - ArabianBusiness.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong Islamic Index===
The '''HK Islamic Index''' (HKII), was established in 2007 by the Chamber to support Hong Kong's ambitions to develop into an [[Shariah]] compliant, [[Islamic banking]] and financial centre and was the first time a chamber of commerce had taken the initiative to create its own equity index. Reuters, Bloomberg, and Quamnet have been contracted to disseminate the HK Islamic Index. The HKII comprises 78 companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, with 39 each from Hong Kong and mainland China. The Hong Kong Islamic Index was valued at [[HK$]]1,419 as of 20 June 2011. Stocks under the index are listed from the Real Estate, Transportation, Information Technology, Industrial Goods, Utilities, Energy, Material, Telecommunications, or Consumer Goods sectors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.quamnet.com/markets.action?showIndice=HKII Quamnet.com Stock Markets&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkislamicindex.com/constituents.htm HK Islamic Index Limited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amwal Credit Union===
[[File:ACU Logo.jpg|thumb|ACU Logo]]
The Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry recognised that when The Chamber was established there was a lack of Islamic Banking in Hong Kong and China. In 2009 it established the '''Amwal Credit Union''', which would provide [[Shariah]] compliant, Islamic banking and finance based on the core principles of community and individual responsibility, environmental responsibility, and Islamically permissible banking practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amwalcreditunion.org/index_welcome_extended.html AmwalCreditUnion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=16&amp;art_id=78214&amp;sid=22728450&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20090216&amp;fc=1 Credit crunch opens doors for other possibilities - The Standard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016012013/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=16&amp;art_id=78214&amp;sid=22728450&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20090216&amp;fc=1 |date=October 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[language]], an '''archaism''' (from the {{lang-grc|ἀρχαϊκός}}, ''archaïkós'', 'old-fashioned, antiquated', ultimately {{lang|grc|ἀρχαῖος}}, ''archaîos'', 'from the beginning, ancient') is a word, a sense of a word, or a style of speech or writing that belongs to a historical epoch long beyond living memory, but that has survived in a few practical settings or affairs.  [[lexicon|Lexical]] archaisms are single archaic words or expressions used regularly in an affair (e.g. [[religion|religion]] or [[law]]) or freely; [[literature|literary]] archaism is the survival of archaic language in a traditional literary text such as a [[nursery rhyme]] or the deliberate use of a [[style (fiction)|style]] characteristic of an earlier age—for example, in his 1960 novel [[The_Sot-Weed_Factor|''The Sot-Weed Factor'']], John Barth writes in an 18th-century style.&lt;ref name="McArthurMcArthur2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas Burns McArthur|author2=Roshan McArthur|title=Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMsWFsI0YkIC&amp;pg=PT162|accessdate=4 September 2013|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280637-6|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All archaic words or expressions have distinctive emotional [[connotation|connotations]]—some can be humorous (''forsooth''), some highly formal (''What say you?''), and some solemn (''With thee do I plight my troth'').

==Usage==
Archaisms are most frequently encountered in [[history]], [[poetry]], [[fantasy literature]], [[law]], [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[technology]], [[geography]] and [[ritual]] writing and speech. Archaisms are kept alive by these ritual and literary uses and by the study of older literature. Should they remain recognised, they can potentially be revived.

Because they are things of continual discovery and re-invention, science and technology have historically generated forms of speech and writing which have dated and fallen into disuse relatively quickly. However the emotional associations of certain words (for example: 'Wireless' rather than 'Radio' for a generation of British citizens who lived through the Second World War) have kept them alive even though the older word is clearly an archaism.

A similar desire to evoke a former age means that archaic place names are frequently used in circumstances where doing so conveys a political or emotional subtext, or when the official new name is not recognised by all (for example: 'Madras' rather than 'Chennai'). So, a restaurant seeking to conjure up historic associations might prefer to call itself ''Old Bombay'' or refer to ''Persian cuisine'' in preference to using the newer place name. A notable contemporary example is the name of the airline [[Cathay Pacific]], which uses the archaic [[Cathay]] ("[[China]]").

Archaisms are frequently misunderstood, leading to changes in usage.  One example is found in the [[phrase]] "the odd man out", which originally came from the phrase "to find the odd man out", where the verb "to find out" has been split by its object "the odd man", meaning the item which does not fit.

The compound adverbs and prepositions found in the writing of [[lawyer]]s (''e.g. heretofore, hereunto, thereof'') are examples of archaisms as a form of jargon. Some [[phraseology|phraseologies]], especially in religious contexts, retain archaic elements that are not used in ordinary speech in any other context: "With this ring I thee wed."  Archaisms are also used in the [[dialogue]] of [[historical novel]]s in order to evoke the flavour of the period.  Some may count as [[inherently funny word]]s and are used for [[humour|humorous]] effect.

== Examples ==
A type of archaism is the use of ''[[thou]]'', the second-person singular pronoun that fell out of general use in the 17th century, while ''you'' or ''ye'', formerly only used to address groups, and then also to respectfully address individuals, is now used to address both individuals and groups (but since this can result in ambiguity, ''[[y'all]]'' can be used to re-introduce the distinction). ''Thou'' is the [[nominative case|nominative]] form; the [[oblique case|oblique]]/[[objective (grammar)|objective]] form is ''thee'' (functioning as both [[accusative case|accusative]] and [[dative case|dative]]), and the [[genitive|possessive]] is ''thy'' or ''thine''.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though '''thou hast''' ever so many counsellors, '''yet''' ["yet" is generally&lt;!--This bracketed comment was added 5 may 2013.--&gt; not an archaism, but it is in this context] do not forsake the counsel of '''thy''' own soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Strauss | first = Emanuel | department = Volume 2 | year = 1994 | title = Dictionary of European Proverbs | publisher = Routledge | page = 1044 | isbn =0415096243}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:— English proverb&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Today me, tomorrow '''thee'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Strauss | first = Emanuel |department = Volume 2 | year = 1994 | title = Dictionary of European Proverbs | publisher = Routledge | page = 1038 | isbn =0415096243}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:— English proverb&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The meaning of this proverb is that something that happens to a person, is likely to eventually happen to another who observes it, especially if the two people are similar.

&lt;blockquote&gt;To '''thine''' own self be true.&lt;ref&gt;Polonius, ''Hamlet'', scene III&lt;/ref&gt;
: —William Shakespeare&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The meaning of this saying is simply that it is unwise to lie to yourself. In its contemporary context it meant to be true (loyal, faithful, supportive) to one's own interests (the 'self' of person, property, and goals). In other words, put yourself before others.

Archaisms in proverbs are often retained, far longer than in other parts of the language. This is because they make the proverbs "fall easier on the tongue",&lt;ref name="AllertonNesselhauf2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David John Allerton|author2=Nadja Nesselhauf|author3=Paul Skandera|title=Phraseological Units: Basic Concepts and Their Application|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i3kdAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=4 September 2013|year=2004|publisher=Schwabe Verlag Basel|isbn=978-3-7965-1949-9|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and also because of the rhetorical effect they evoke by the use of two of the [[Rhetorical operations|four fundamental operations]] in rhetoric.

'''Božidar Ferjančić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Божидар Ферјанчић}}; 17 February 1929 – 28 June 1998) was a [[Serbia]]n historian, a specialist in medieval Serbian history and the later [[Byzantine]] empire. He was member of the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

Ferjančić was born in Belgrade, at the time part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Ferjančić graduated with distinction from the Faculty of Philosophy at the [[University of Belgrade]] in History in 1953 and after additional study at the same university, where he worked under [[George Ostrogorsky]], receiving his doctorate in 1960 with a dissertation entitled ''Despots in Byzantium and the Lands of the South Slavs''. He then taught at the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Philosophy. He advanced rapidly and in 1965 was made associate professor and in 1970 professor. In 1973 he assumed the chairmanship of the Institute for Byzantine Studies after Ostrogorsky's retirement, a post Ferjančić occupied until his death in 1998. In 1977 he became the director of the institute, a post held by Ostrogorsky before he died in 1976. Ferjančić was made corresponding member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1978 and a regular member a couple of years later. He died on 28 June (''[[Vidovdan]]'') in Belgrade.

The '''Bulgarian National Corpus''' (BulNC) is a large representative [[Text corpus|corpus]] of Bulgarian comprising about 200,000 texts and amounting to over 1 billion words.&lt;ref&gt;Koeva, Svetla, Ivelina Stoyanova, Svetlozara Leseva, Tsvetana Dimitrova, Rositsa Dekova, and Ekaterina Tarpomanova (2012) “The Bulgarian National Corpus: Theory and Practice in Corpus Design” – Journal of Language Modelling, 2012, Vol. 0, No. 1, pp. 65-110. {{ISSN|2299-8470}}. [http://nlp.ipipan.waw.pl/ojs/index.php/JLM/article/view/33/30]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Bulgarian National corpus is created at the Institute for Bulgarian Language „Prof. L. Andreychin” by research associates from the Department of Computational Linguistics and the Department of Bulgarian Lexicology and Lexicography. BulNC incorporates several individual electronic corpora, developed in the period 2001-2009 for the purposes of the two departments. The corpus is constantly enlarged with new texts.&lt;ref&gt;Svetla Koeva, Sv. Leseva, I. Stoyanova, E. Tarpomanova, M. Todorova (2006) “Bulgarian Tagged Corpora”. In: Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference Formal Approaches to South Slavic and Balkan Languages, 18–20 October 2006, Sofia, Bulgaria, pp. 78-86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koeva Sv., Blagoeva, D., Kolkovska, S. (2010) “Bulgarian National Corpus Project”. In: Proceedings of LREC-2010, Valletta, ELRA, pp. 3678-3684.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

The Bulgarian National corpus consists of a monolingual (Bulgarian) part and 47 parallel corpora. The Bulgarian part includes about 1.2 billion words in over 240 000 text samples. The materials in the Corpus reflect the state of the Bulgarian language (mainly in its written form) from the middle of 20th century (1945) until present.&lt;ref&gt;Koeva, Svetla, Ivelina Stoyanova, Svetlozara Leseva, Tsvetana Dimitrova, Rositsa Dekova, and Ekaterina Tarpomanova (2012) “The Bulgarian National Corpus: Theory and Practice in Corpus Design” – Journal of Language Modelling, 2012, Vol. 0, No. 1, pp. 65-110. {{ISSN|2299-8470}}. [http://nlp.ipipan.waw.pl/ojs/index.php/JLM/article/view/33/30]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also includes parallel corpora  of various size for 47 foreign languages.&lt;ref&gt;Koeva, S., Dekova, R., Stoyanova, I., Rizov, B., Genov, A. (2012) “Bulgarian X-language Parallel Corpus”. In: Proceedings of the Eight International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC’12)&lt;/ref&gt;

BulNC is annotated at various linguistic levels.&lt;ref&gt;Koeva, Sv., Genov, A. (2011) “Bulgarian Language Processing Chain”. In: Proceedings of the Workshop Integration of multilingual resources and tools in Web applications, Hamburg.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
The Bulgarian National Corpus enables a number of applications in various linguistic areas: in computational linguistics; in lexicography; within theoretical studies of specific linguistic phenomena; for observations of the characteristics of individual language domains; for extracting exemplary sentences for the education in Bulgarian language, etc.

Some of the more specific applications of the Corpus are listed below:

* Extraction of specific or general sub-corpora following particular criteria (subject, author, year / period of publication, source, etc.), which could be used as training corpora for a number of applications – grammatical and semantic tagging, among others, as well as for other research purposes.
* Observations on the usage frequency of words or language constructions, generation of frequency lists, etc.
* Searches in the Corpus for instances of particular linguistic phenomena, lexicographic examples or for educational purposes in the Bulgarian language instruction (available to use over the Internet).

==Access==
Access to BulNC is free of charge for public use{{clarify|date=May 2015}} and includes:
* Access to the [http://search.dcl.bas.bg BulNC search engine]
* Certain subcorpora are available for [http://dcl.bas.bg/BulNC-registration/ download]

'''Contemporary archaeology''' is a field of archaeological research that focuses on the most recent (20th and 21st century) past, and also increasingly explores the application of archaeological thinking to the contemporary world. It has also been referred to as the archaeology of the 'contemporary past'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buchli |first=Victor |first2=Gavin |last2=Lucas |title=Archaeologies of the Contemporary Past |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |date=4 January 2002 |pages=208 |isbn=9781134571383 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=xK-BAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |jstor=3527092}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of this term in the United Kingdom is particularly associated with the Contemporary and Historical Archaeology in Theory (CHAT) conference group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chat-arch.org |title=CHAT ACT: Agency, Action and Advocacy Moesgaard Museum, Aarhus University, Denmark Friday 26 – Sunday 28 October 2018 |work=Contemporary and Historical Archaeology in Theory |access-date=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field forms part of [[historical archaeology]], or the archaeology of the modern period. Unlike [[ethnoarchaeology]], contemporary archaeology studies the recent and contemporary past in its own right, rather than to develop models that can inform the study of the more distant past.

Often informed by anthropological [[material culture studies]], but characterised by putting traditional archaeological methods and practices to new uses, research in this field generally aims to make an archaeological contribution to broader social scientific studies of the contemporary world, focusing especially upon contributing methods of studying material things (objects, landscapes, buildings, material heritage, etc.) to sociological, geographical and political studies of the modern world. The field has developed especially in heritage management, for example through [[English Heritage]]'s "Change and Creation" programme on the landscapes of the later 20th century &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schofield |first=J. |title=The Archaeology of the 20th Century |url=http://www.archaeologists.net/modules/icontent/inPages/docs/conference/schofield.doc |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927230416/http://www.archaeologists.net/modules/icontent/inPages/docs/conference/schofield.doc |archive-date=27 September 2007 |access-date=13 November 2018 |work=[[Chartered Institute for Archaeologists]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Contemporary Archaeology aims to explore the characteristics of diverse and rapid change across micro and macro scales by using a range of conventional and experimental [[Archaeology]] investigative techniques. Like all archaeological scholarship and practice, Contemporary Archaeology uses both [[inductive reasoning]] and [[deductive reasoning]] approaches, which can include archaeological modelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=David L. |author-link=David L. Clarke |title=Models in Archaeology |publisher=[[Methuen (publisher)|Methuen]] |year=1972 |pages=1055 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=SCFmAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Quentin Lewis recognized, contemporary archaeology has a firmer footing in the UK and Europe than it does in North America, or at least it is not an especially recognizable scholarly niche quite yet in the US.  The work of scholars in the UK and Europe has turned to some materiality that is admittedly distinctive if not unique, such as the extensive scholarship of the landscapes of 20th century warfare (for instance, English Heritage’s ambitious Cold War Monuments project, Gabriel Moshenska’s work on British air raid shelters and children’s homefront experiences of World War II, Heinrich Natho’s study of Norwegian World War II coastal defenses, and Alfredo Gonzalez-Ruibal’s analysis of Spanish Civil War Monuments); Laura McAtackney’s work on “peace walls” in northern Ireland; Anna Badcock and Robert Johnston’s study of protest camp sites in Derbyshire; and contemporary graffiti (John Schofield has cleverly captivated many journalists and questioned what archaeologists value with his assessment of Sex Pistols graffiti).  Yet for all these distinctive dimensions of British and European heritage we could certainly point to just as many equally interesting material experiences in every corner of North America.  Some of the visibility of contemporary archaeology is inevitably linked to a British and European willingness to conduct material analysis that does not require excavation.  Outside North America a vast number of scholars call themselves archaeologists while studying space, the built environment, and a broad range of material things without necessarily wielding a trowel.  In the US historical archaeology has fashioned a particularly productive niche by focusing on field excavation and everyday materiality, and much of our training is devoted to field methods and analysis of a distinctive range of commodities like ceramics, glass, and faunal remains that are routinely recovered from excavation contexts on nearly any historic period site" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sha.org/blog/index.php/tag/contemporary-archaeology/ |title=Contemporary Archaeology |date=1 February 2012 |access-date=13 November 2018 |work=[[The Society for Historical Archaeology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a history reaching back as far, at least, as William Rathje's "garbology" project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913924,00.html |title=The Nation: Truth in Garbage |date=26 January 1976 |access-date=13 November 2018 |magazine=[[TIME]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Archaeology remains a new sub-discipline within the university. In remaining focused on archaeology's ability to tell stories that reach beyond official or formal discourse, Contemporary Archaeology has the potential to offer significant political critique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Borderline Archaeology: a practise of contemporary archaeology - exploring aspects of creative narratives and performance cultural production |last=Campbell |first=Fiona |last2=Ulin |first2=Jonna |date=11 June 2004 |publisher=[[Göteborgs universitet]] |isbn=91-85245-01-1 |url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/16211/5/gupea_2077_16211_5.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5004">'''Cybernetic art''' is [[contemporary art]] that builds upon the legacy of [[Cybernetics]], where feedback involved in the work take precedence over traditional [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] and material concerns.

==History==
[[Nicolas Schöffer]]'s ''CYSP I'' (1956) was perhaps the first artwork to explicitly employ cybernetic principles (CYSP is an acronym that joins the first two letters of the words "CYbernetic" and "SPatiodynamic").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CYSP I, the first cybernetic sculpture of art's history|url=http://www.olats.org/schoffer/cyspe.htm|publisher=Leonardo/OLATS - Observatoire Leonardo des arts et des technosciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist [[Roy Ascott]] elaborated an extensive theory of cybernetic art in  "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" (Cybernetica, Journal of the International Association for Cybernetics (Namur), Volume IX, No.4, 1966; Volume X No.1, 1967) and in "The Cybernetic Stance: My Process and Purpose" (Leonardo Vol 1, No 2, 1968). Art historian [[Edward A. Shanken]] has written about the history of art and cybernetics in essays including "[http://www.artexetra.com//CyberneticsArtCultConv.pdf Cybernetics and Art: Cultural Convergence in the 1960s]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Energy to Information: Representation in Science, Technology, Art, and Literature|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford|pages=255–277|editor=Bruce Clarke and Linda Dalrymple Henderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of [[Roy Ascott]]"(2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ascott|first=Roy|title=Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|editor=Edward A. Shanken}}&lt;/ref&gt; which traces the trajectory of Ascott's work from cybernetic art to [[telematic art]] (art using computer networking as its medium, a precursor to [[net.art]].)

Audio feedback and the use of tape loops, sound synthesis and computer generated compositions reflected a cybernetic awareness of information, systems and cycles. Such techniques became widespread in the 1960s in the music industry. The visual effects of electronic feedback became a focus of artistic research in the late 1960s, when video equipment first reached the consumer market. [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], for example, used "all manner and combination of audio and video signals to generate electronic feedback in their respective of corresponding media."&lt;ref name="RA 07"&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]], "From Cybernetics to Telematics: The Art, Pedagogy, and Theory of Roy Ascott," in Roy Ascott (2003, 2007), ''Telematic Embrace: Visionary Theories of Art, Technology, and Consciousness'', University of California, {{ISBN|0-520-22294-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With related work by Edward Ihnatowicz, [[Wen-Ying Tsai]] and cybernetician [[Gordon Pask]] and the animist kinetics of [[Robert Breer]] and [[Jean Tinguely]], the 1960s produced a strain of cyborg art that was very much concerned with the shared circuits within and between the living and the technological. A line of cyborg art theory also emerged during the late 1960s. Writers like Jonathan Benthall and [[Gene Youngblood]] drew on cybernetics and cybernetic. The most substantial contributors here were the British artist and theorist [[Roy Ascott]] with his essay "Behaviourist Art and the Cybernetic Vision" in the journal Cybernetica (1976), and  the American critic and theorist [[Jack Burnham]]. In "Beyond Modern Sculpture" from 1968 he builds cybernetic art into an extensive theory that centers on art's drive to imitate and ultimately reproduce life.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Whitelaw (2004), ''Metacreation: Art and Artificial Life'', MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-23234-0}} p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading art theorists and historians in this field include [[Christiane Paul]], [[Frank Popper]], [[Christine Buci-Glucksmann]], [[Dominique Moulon]], [[Robert C. Morgan]], [[Roy Ascott]], [[Margot Lovejoy]], [[Edmond Couchot]], [[Fred Forest]] and [[Edward A. Shanken]].

== Life ==
Heténys father was the [[operetta]] composer Albert Hetényi Heidelberg (1875–1951).

Ernő Hetényi was the founder of the Buddhist society of Hungary in 1951. As a disciple of [[Lama Anagarika Govinda]] he became leader of the order of the [[Arya Maitreya Mandala]]. During Communist government Buddhism as practising religion was not encouraged, but the activity of the Buddhist community was tolerated by the authorities. "In 1956 Dr. Hetényi founded the Alexander Csoma des Körös Institute for Buddhology, the order’s first academic institution in Europe. He has been very successful in strengthening the order’s ties with Buddhist communities and institutions in Mongolia and countries of the former Soviet Union."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arya-maitreya-mandala.org/content/news.htm February 2012: Centennial Birth Anniversary of Ernő Hetényi]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hetényi published numerous books and articles on Buddhism and Tibet. He was also a researcher of the History of Buddhism in Hungary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/bot/bot_10_01_03.pdf Ernest Hetenyi: A Short History of Buddhism in Hungary.

'''Eye dialect''' is the use of nonstandard spelling for speech to draw attention to pronunciation. The term was coined by [[George Philip Krapp]] to refer to the literary technique of using nonstandard spelling that implies a pronunciation  of the given word that is actually standard, such as ''wimmin'' for ''women''; the spelling indicates that the character's speech overall is [[dialect]]al, foreign, or uneducated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Walpole|1974|pp=193, 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Rickford|Rickford|2000|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of nonstandard spelling differs from others in that a difference in spelling does not indicate a difference in pronunciation of a word.  That is, it is dialect to the eye rather than to the ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.viviancook.uk/SpellingNovel/EyeDialect.htm |title=Eye Dialect in English Literature |first=Vivian |last=Cook |access-date=11 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It suggests that a character "would use a vulgar pronunciation if there were one" and "is at the level of ignorance where one misspells in this fashion, hence mispronounces as well".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Bolinger|1946|p=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is less commonly also used to refer to [[pronunciation spelling]]s, that is, spellings of words that indicate that they are pronounced in a nonstandard way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wilson|1993|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, an author might write ''dat'' as an attempt at accurate transcription of a nonstandard pronunciation of ''that''. The rest of this article will discuss the former definition.

==Use==
Some notable authors who use eye dialect include 
[[Harriet Beecher Stowe]],
[[Maya Angelou]],
[[Charles Dickens]],&lt;ref name="Levenston 1992 56"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Levenston|1992|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[William Faulkner]],
[[Greer Gilman]],
[[Alex Haley]], 
[[Joel Chandler Harris]],
[[Russell Hoban]],
[[Terry Pratchett]],
[[James Whitcomb Riley]],
[[Robert Ruark]],&lt;ref name="Malin 1965 230"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Malin|1965|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[John Steinbeck]], and
[[Mark Twain]]. 
However, most authors are likely to use eye dialect with restraint, sprinkling nonstandard misspelling here and there to serve as a cue to the reader about all of a character's speech, rather than as an accurate phonetic representation.

While mostly used in dialogue, eye dialect may appear in the narrative depiction of altered spelling made ''by'' a character (such as in a letter or diary entry), generally used to more overtly depict characters who are poorly educated or semi-literate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nuessel|1982|p=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''eye dialect'' was first used by George Philip Krapp in 1925. "The convention violated", he wrote, "is one of the eyes, not of the ear."&lt;ref name="Krapp 1925"/&gt;. According to Krapp, it was not used to indicate a real difference in pronunciation but {{Quote |text=the spelling is merely a friendly nudge to the reader, a knowing look which establishes a sympathetic sense of superiority between the author and reader as contrasted with the humble speaker of dialect.|author= George P. Krapp |source='' The English language in America'' (1925)&lt;ref name="Krapp 1925"&gt;{{Cite book |title= The English language in America |last= Krapp |first=G.P. |date= 1925 |publisher= The Century Co., for the Modern Language Association of America}} quoted in {{Cite book |chapter =Eye dialect |title= The Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language |last= Mcarthur |first=Tom |date= 1998 |publisher= Oxford University Press }}
&lt;/ref&gt;}} 

In an article on written representations of speech in a ''non-literary'' context, for instance transcription by sociolinguists, Denis R.Preston argued that such spellings serve mainly to "denigrate the speaker so represented by making him or her appear boorish, uneducated, rustic, gangsterish, and so on".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Denis R. |last=Preston |date=1985 |title=The Li’l Abner Syndrome: Written Representations of Speech |journal=American Speech |volume=60 |issue=4 |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Jane Raymond Walpole]] points out that there are other ways to indicate speech variation such as altered syntax, punctuation, and colloquial or regional word choices. She observes that a reader must be prompted to access their memory of a given speech pattern and that non-orthographic signals that accomplish this may be more effective than eye dialect.&lt;ref name="walpole195"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Walpole|1974|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Frank Nuessel]] points out that use of eye dialect closely interacts with stereotypes about various groups, both relying on and reinforcing them in an attempt to efficiently characterize speech.

In ''The Lie That Tells a Truth: A Guide to Writing Fiction'', [[John Dufresne]] cites ''The Columbia Guide to Standard American English'' in suggesting that writers avoid eye dialect; he argues that it is frequently pejorative, making a character seem stupid rather than regional, and is more distracting than helpful. Like Walpole, Dufresne suggests that dialect should be rendered by "rhythm of the prose, by the syntax, the diction, idioms and figures of speech, by the vocabulary indigenous to the locale".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dufresne|2003|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eye dialect, when consistently applied, may render a character's speech indecipherable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Walpole|1974|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An attempt to accurately render nonstandard speech may also prove difficult to readers unfamiliar with a particular accent.&lt;ref name="nuessel"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Nuessel|1982|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples in English ==
===Prose fiction===
[[Charles Dickens]] may have used eye dialect more than any other prominent author in English. He combined it with pronunciation spelling and nonstandard grammar in the speech of his uneducated characters. An example in ''[[Bleak House]]'' is dialogue spoken by Jo, the miserable boy who sweeps a path across a street:

{{quote|...there wos other genlmen come down Tom-all-Alone's a-prayin, but they all mostly sed as the t'other wuns prayed wrong, and all mostly sounded as to be a-talking to theirselves, or a-passing blame on the t'others, and not a-talkin to us.}}

Here ''wos, sed,'' and ''wuns'' indicate standard pronunciations.&lt;ref name="Levenston 1992 56"/&gt;

In his [[Discworld]] series, Terry Pratchett makes extensive use of eye dialect to extend the caricature of his characters, even going to the point of changing the font used for certain dialogue. [[Death (Discworld)|Death]], for example, speaks in [[small capitals]], while the dialogue of a [[Golems (Discworld)|golem]], who can only communicate by writing, resembles Hebrew script in reference to the origins of the golem legend. Eye dialect is also used to establish a medieval setting, wherein many characters' grasp of spelling is heavily based on phonetics.

===In comics===
American [[cartoonist]] [[Al Capp]] frequently combined eye dialect with pronunciation spelling in his [[comic strip]] ''[[Li'l Abner]]''.  Examples include ''lissen, aristocratick, mountin'' [mountain], ''correkt, feends, hed, introduckshun, leppard,'' and perhaps the most common, ''enuff''.  Only his rustic characters are given these spellings; for instance, the "overcivilized" Bounder J. Roundheels's dialogue contains ''gourmets'', while Li'l Abner's contains ''goormays''.&lt;ref name="Malin 1965 230"/&gt;

Cartoonist [[Walt Kelly]] made extensive use of eye dialect in his classic strip ''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]''. Like Pratchett, he used unique fonts for many of his supporting cast.

Some cartoonists and comic book creators eschew phonetic eye dialects in favor of font changes or distinctive [[speech balloons]] – ''[[Swamp Thing]]'', for example, has traditionally been depicted using "crusty" yellow speech balloons and dialogue heavily laced with ellipses, suggesting a gravelly voice that only speaks with great effort. Robotic and computer characters often use square speech balloons and angular fonts reminiscent of [[OCR-A]], suggesting a stilted, emotionless cadence, etc.

===Other uses===
American film director [[Quentin Tarantino]] used eye dialect for the title of his movie ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]''.

One popular theory that has gained mainstream acceptance by linguists since the 1960s is that the expression [[OK]] comes from "Oll Korrect" – all correct.

== Examples in other languages ==

In the [[Chile]]an comic ''[[Mampato]]'', the character Ogú replaces hard ⟨c⟩ with ⟨k⟩ (e.g. ⟨komida⟩ instead of ⟨comida⟩), to show that his accent is strange.

In [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Vasiliy Shukshin]]'s story ''Мой зять украл машину дров'' (''My son-in-law stole a carful of firewood'') has the main character say "Што?" for "What?" instead of the expected "Что?" (что is normally pronounced {{IPA|[ʂto]}}, not {{IPA|[tɕto]}}, as if it were spelled "што"). The character is a delivery driver in Siberia and the eye dialect emphasizes his uneducated nature.

The novel ''[[Zazie in the Metro|Zazie dans le Métro]]'' is famously written in [[French language|French]] that disregards almost all French spelling conventions.

The [[Norway|Norwegian]] author [[Hans Jæger]]'s trilogy ''The Erotic Confessions of the Bohemians'' (1893–1903) is written in a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] form of eye dialect.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The whole Russian [[Padonki]] dialect is based on deliberate misspelling of words.

''Haniwa'' were created according to the ''wazumi'' technique, in which mounds of coiled clay were built up to shape the figure, layer by layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nussbaum, Louis Frédéric|author-link=Louis Frédéric|title=Le Japon: Dictionnaire et Civilisation|trans-title=Japan Encyclopedia|year=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press Reference Library|location=United States of America|isbn=9780674017535|pages=286, 833|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;lpg=PA831&amp;ots=gYPzqwajn0&amp;dq=wasumi%20technique&amp;pg=PA286#v=onepage&amp;q=wasumi%20technique&amp;f=false|translator=Käthe Roth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Haniwa'' were made with water-based clay and dried into a coarse and absorbent material that stood the test of time. Their name means “circle of clay” referring to how they were arranged in a circle above the tomb. The protruding parts of the figures were made separately and then attached, while a few things were carved into them. They were smoothed out by a wooden paddle. Terraces were arranged to place them with a cylindrical base into the ground, where the earth would hold them in place.

During the Kofun period, a highly aristocratic society with militaristic rulers developed. The [[cavalry]] wore iron armor, carried [[sword]]s and other weapons, and used advanced military methods like those of northeast Asia. Many of them are represented in ''haniwa'' figurines for funerary purposes.

The most important of the ''haniwa'' were found in southern [[Honshū]]—especially the [[Kansai|Kinai region]] around [[Nara prefecture|Nara]]—and northern [[Kyūshū]]. ''Haniwa'' grave offerings were made in many forms, such as horses, chickens, birds, fans, fish, houses, weapons, shields, sunshades, pillows, and humans. Besides decorative and spiritual reasons of protecting the deceased in his afterlife, these figures served as a sort of retaining wall for the [[Tumulus|burial mound]].

Because these ''haniwa'' display the contemporary clothing, hairstyle, farming tools, and architecture, these sculptures are important as a historical archive of the Kofun Period.

Everyday pottery items from that period are called [[Haji pottery]].

== History ==
=== Origin ===
Earlier clay figurines appeared during the [[Jōmon period]] called ''[[dogū]]''.

[[Hiroaki Sato (translator)|Hiroaki Sato]] cites a passage from the [[Nihon Shoki]], in which [[Emperor Suinin]] issued an imperial edict concerning funerals: "From now on make it a rule to erect clay figures and not to hurt people."  Thus, these clay figures may have replaced live human sacrifices.&lt;ref name=Sato&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sato |first=Hiroaki |title=Legends of the Samurai |publisher=Overlook Duckworth |year=1995 |ISBN=9781590207307 |pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of ''haniwa'' started during the latter part of the [[Yayoi period]] around the [[Kingdom of Kibi]]. During this time special earthenware figurines and bowls started to appear on top of the tombs of leaders. The early sculptures exceeded 1m (3.3ft) in length. They consisted of a cylindrical portion, which represented the torso, and a skirt-shaped portion at the base, which represented the legs. Many times a special insignia or pattern would be displayed on the torso. Sometimes an obi would be placed around the torso. These sculptures are thought to have been used as part of a funeral ritual. Other than the Kibi area, the only other place these sculptures were found was in the [[Izumo province]].

During the latter part of the 3rd century AD, these sculptures started to appear on top of the imperial [[Tumulus|grave mounds]] in the [[Kansai|Kinai region]]. During this time more elaborate ''haniwa'' appeared with earthenware bowls. It is believed that the movement of these sculptures and ''haniwa'' from the Kibi region to the [[Kansai|Kinai region]] is indicative of an increase in their importance.

===Later developments===
During the earlier part of the [[Kofun period]] (later 3rd century AD) the only earthenware ''haniwa'' were cylindrical; however, toward the early 4th century AD, shield and other tool-shaped ''haniwa'' started to appear. Additionally, during the middle [[Kofun period]] (mid-5th century AD) [[Miko|shrine maiden]], horse, dog, and other animal-shaped ''haniwa'' were introduced. As the practice of ceremonial [[Tumulus|burial mounds]] declined in the mid-6th century AD, ''haniwa'' became rarer in the [[Kansai|Kinai region]]; however, ''haniwa'' were made in abundance in the [[Kantō region]].

It is not uncommon for some haniwa to be painted with red dye or other colors. Besides the cylindrical haniwa (enkei-haniwa), another common type was the house-shaped haniwa (keisho-haniwa). Other things that fell into the category of keisho-haniwa were those shaped like humans, animals, and swords. The details on the haniwa give information about the elite buried in the tomb, as well as valuable knowledge of the tools or other objects people of that time used. The military haniwa inform archeologists of the armour and weapons, as well as the status symbols of these military branches.

File:Caballo Haniwa Guimet 01.JPG|''Haniwa'' horse statuette, complete with [[horse tack|saddle]] and [[stirrup]]s, 6th century
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Significance ==
Originally, the cylindrical type ''haniwa'' were set on top of the [[Tumulus|funeral mounds]], so it is believed that they had a purpose in funeral rituals; however, as the ''haniwa'' became more developed, they were set toward the outside of the grave area. It is thought that they were used as boundary markers for the borders of the gravesite.

There is a theory that the soul of the deceased would reside in the ''haniwa'', as the earlier ''haniwa'' were placed on top of the [[Tumulus|funeral mounds]]. There are ''haniwa'' that are equipped with weapons and armor. These are thought to be containers for souls. The armor and weapons would drive away evil spirits and protect the buried ruler from calamity.{{fact|date=January 2017}} Because the horse- and animal-shaped ''haniwa'' were normally neatly arranged into a line, it is believed that they were part of a sending-off ceremony.

==In modern society==
Although the religious implications of the ''haniwa'' have largely declined in modern society, the sculptures are prized by many for their aesthetic and historical significance. The works of Shojiro Ishibashi, for example, were heavily influenced by the ''haniwa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Ceramic Sculpture of Isamu Noguchi|last=Altshuler|first=Bruce |title=Isamu Noguchi to Kitaōji Rosanjin [Isamu Noguchi, Rosanjin Kitaōji] | language=ja | editor1=Saison Museum | editor2=Bijutsukan Renraku Kyōgikai | editor3=[[Museum of Modern Art, Kamakura &amp; Hayama]] in [[Kamakura]] |editor4= Fukuyama Museum of Art, [[Fukuyama, Hiroshima]] | publisher=[[Yomiuri Shinbun]]|translator = Ogawa, Kikuko | oclc=35856363 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted from an exhibition catalog for an art show toured to four museums in Japan in 1996. {{cite web|url=http://www.noguchi.org/baceramic.html|title=The Ceramic Sculpture of Isamu Noguchi|last=Altshuler|first=Bruce|publisher=[[Noguchi Museum]]|archive-date=2005-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050720081323/http://www.noguchi.org/baceramic.html|access-date=2017-10-04|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been accepted as "Pure Art", according to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,868674,00.html | title= Art: The Haniwa Rage | date= 21 July 1958| work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | access-date= 4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond simple appreciation as artistic sculptures, modern popular culture has, in some cases, portrayed the ''haniwa'' as containing a sentient entity and not just as a simple empty sculpture. The most common portrayal depicts the ''haniwa'' with a rounded, pot-like shape, bearing two deep eyes, a wide mouth, and two featureless "arms" on opposite sides of the "pot".

The portrayal of living ''haniwa'' has—since the late 1990s—become widespread, being featured in trading cards, [[video games]] such as the ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' and [[Kirby (series)|''Kirby'']] series; and television. In many of the depictions, the ''haniwa'' is primarily presented as a ghostlike, malevolent creature; without attempting to retain the historical aspect of the ''haniwa'''s religious nature.
In ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', haniwas are called gyroids and are furniture only found buried in the ground.

In [[ancient history|ancient]] [[history]], this was followed by the realisation of the necessity of [[hygiene]] and the halting of [[bleeding]], where wound dressing techniques and [[surgery]] developed. Eventually the [[germ theory of disease]] also assisted in improving wound care.

==Ancient medical practice==
Over time, different civilizations began to create their own herbal medicinal treatments for wounds depending on the trees, shrubs, or any other type of plants located in their environment. These herbal treatments became the oldest form of wound therapy. It is logically assumed that this may not have been a very safe way of treating humans with wounds due to overdosing or choosing the wrong plants to treat a person until the right one was found. Nevertheless, most of the ancient people who were given the duty of healers through the usage of herbs were well accustomed with which plants from their local flora could be used to help the injured. This knowledge was learned and passed down after healers repeatedly used an herbal remedy for a specific wound with the belief that it promoted healing.&lt;ref name="Griggs"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Green Pharmacy: The History and Evolution of Western Herbal Medicine|url = https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=zpxs-P0rxlkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=%2522history+of+herbal+medicine%2522&amp;ots=Fa1q-8W5Ao&amp;sig=3YAQp9hxA4bZ4PAan4uuQGqC6OE#v=onepage&amp;q=%2522history%2520of%2520herbal%2520medicine%2522&amp;f=false|publisher = Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Co|date = 1997-10-01|isbn = 9780892817276|first = Barbara|last = Griggs|first2 = Barbara Van der|last2 = Zee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous ancient herbal remedies and poisons now serve as models for modern medicine. For example, [[curare]], which was an ancient South American arrow poison, was used in the 20th century as the muscle relaxant [[Tubocurarine chloride|tubocurarine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Civilizing of Curare: A History of Its Development and Introduction Into Anesthesiology|last = Betcher|first = Alber M.

They also observed what seasons, time of day, or moon phase would result in a most active plant. The former however resulted in a minimal influence in modern medicine as compared to plants parts or seasons of growth.&lt;ref name="Griggs"/&gt;

=== Ancient Greece ===
As tribal healers developed into doctors, it spurred on a primitive [[pharmaceutical industry]] that included traders who would travel overseas bringing herbs that would be used for specific wounds. Soon, like most industries, patients began to skip the doctors altogether and purchased the herbs directly from the traders who were also aware of the effects and quantities that should be taken while also informing their “patients” of them.  These merchants that supplied people with herbs were known as ''rhizotomiki'', or gatherers of roots, in Ancient Greece. The earliest known list of herbs and remedies was probably written for these herbal merchants. The earliest known to men is the R''hizotomika'' ''of Diocles of Carustius'', a student of Greek philosopher Aristotle. This book includes the author’s observation of the effects of the herbal medicine on specific parts of the human body. This then became the beginning of scientific research on herbal remedies on humans, which has been modified and significantly changed from modern wound remedies.&lt;ref name="Griggs"/&gt;

The Greeks also acknowledged the importance of wound closure, and were the first to differentiate between acute and [[chronic wounds]], calling them "fresh" and [[chronic wounds|"non-healing"]], respectively. [[Galen of Pergamum]], a Greek surgeon who served Roman [[gladiator]]s circa 120–201 A.D., made many contributions to the field of wound care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Galen of Pergamum|date = 2014-08-09|encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica|url = http://www.britannica.com/biography/Galen-of-Pergamum|last = Nutton|first = Vivian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important was the acknowledgment of the importance of maintaining wound-site moisture to ensure successful closure of the wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Recent advances in topical wound care|url = http://www.ijps.org/text.asp?2012/45/2/379/101321|journal = Indian Journal of Plastic Surgery|date = 2012-05-01|pmc = 3495389|pmid = 23162238|volume = 45|issue = 2|doi = 10.4103/0970-0358.101321|first = Sujata|last = Sarabahi|pages = 379–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient Egypt ===
The clinical history of the treatment of [[acute (medical)|acute]] and [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] wounds can also trace its origins to [[ancient Egypt]]. The [[Ebers Papyrus]], circa [[1500 BC]], details the use of [[Lint (material)|lint]], [[animal grease]], and [[honey]] as [[topical]] treatments for wounds. The lint provided its natural absorbency, the animal grease provided a barrier to environmental pathogens, and the honey served as an antibiotic agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Treating the chronic wound: A practical approach to the care of nonhealing wounds and wound care dressings|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0190962207015988|journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology|volume = 58|issue = 2|doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2007.08.048|first = Margaret A.|last = Fonder|first2 = Gerald S.|last2 = Lazarus|first3 = David A.|last3 = Cowan|first4 = Barbara|last4 = Aronson-Cook|first5 = Angela R.|last5 = Kohli|first6 = Adam J.|last6 = Mamelak|page = 192|pmid=18222318}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Brugsch Papyrus]], circa 1200 BC, stated that the [[Egyptians]] believed that making sure a person's wound stayed closed would help their spirit not be invaded by evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Principles and Practice Of Wound Care|last = Sarabahi|first = Sujata|publisher = JP Medical Ltd.|year = 2012|isbn = 9350258641|location = New Delhi|pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ancient Egyptian Medicine|last = Nunn|first = J.

=== Ancient herbs and medicines ===
There were many known herbs, minerals, and products that could help treat and remedy a variety of specific wounds in the ancient world; the following is a list that shows a set of substances that each were used with its own method and technique in regards to assisting wounds.

==== Turmeric ====
[[File:Sliced Turmeric.jpg|thumb|279x279px|This is the root of the Turmeric plant that had been sliced and boiled. Turmeric was used in the ancient times to promote wound healing.]]
[[Turmeric]] is a well-known spice that is utilized in [[India]] for use in cooking and medical treatments. The implementation of Turmeric in medical administration can typically be explained by the factor that [[Curcumin]] is a component that is contained within Turmeric. Curcumin is an [[antioxidant]] that assists in reducing the pain and effect that is caused by inflammation, and furthermore, is found to accelerate the process of wound healing. In the historical times around some areas of India, the people who would practice this treatment would begin by applying a healthy amount of Turmeric paste onto the wounded area, followed by a wrapping of clothes around the area; in many tribal locations this treatment is still performed.&lt;ref name="organicfacts.net"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Foods for Healing Wounds {{!}} Organic Facts|url = https://www.organicfacts.net/nutrition-facts/others/foods-for-healing-wounds.html|website = Organic Facts|accessdate = 2015-11-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iron====
[[Anemia]] is a disease that is caused by a deficiency of iron, where an individual doesn’t contain enough red-blood cells to transport sufficient oxygen to the exterior body organs, otherwise known as [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]]. Thus, with the surplus of iron in additives such as, [[Iron supplement|tablets]], [[Iron supplement|pills]], and vegetables, the effects of such a disease can be hindered or even prevented. Furthermore, in relation to wounds, it is often recommended by many doctors and surgeons that patients are encouraged to intake food and medicine that are high in iron to accelerate wound healing.&lt;ref name="organicfacts.net"/&gt;

====Honey====
[[Honey]] was utilized for its antibacterial properties that helped heal infected wounds.&lt;ref name= Molan&gt;{{cite journal | author=Peter Charles Molan |author-link=Peter Molan | title=Honey as a topical antibacterial agent for treatment of infected wounds | journal=Nurs Times| year=2001 | pages=96 | volume=49 | issue=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, honey was used as a topical ointment. Other than [[glucose]], which is another name for sugar, honey also contains a variety of trace amounts of many different [[vitamin]]s and [[amino acid]]s, which are also known as [[protein]]s. The method used with honey, in regards to assisting medical treatments, mainly wounds, is by pouring and plastering a wholesome amount of it on the area of the wound. This technique will support in the reduction of pain, inflammation, and swelling. Furthermore, the antibacterial features that honey contains also constrain the wound from infection and growth.&lt;ref name="organicfacts.net"/&gt;

==== Alcohol ====
Various types of [[alcohol]] were also used in ancient medical practices. One of the first uses was by the [[Sumer]]ians, who used beer as an [[Antiseptic mouth rinse|antiseptic]] along with the dressing of wounds, using up to 19 different types of beer.&lt;ref name="Shah 65–66"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The History of Wound Care|journal = The Journal of the American College of Certified Wound Specialists|date = 2012-04-19|issn = 1876-4983|pmc = 3601883|pmid = 24525756|pages = 65–66|volume = 3|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/j.jcws.2012.04.002|first = Jayesh B.|last = Shah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Ancient [[Arabic]] cultures, including the Sumerians and [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]] used wine with sesame infusions, which were "purified and pulverized" before application along with the many beers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Early Arabic Pharmacology: An Introduction Based on Ancient and Medieval Sources|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=LtYUAAAAIAAJ|publisher = Brill Archive|date = 1973-01-01|isbn = 9004037969|first = Martin|last = Levey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another peoples to take advantage of the cleansing properties of alcohol were the [[Greeks]]. They used wine along with boiled water and vinegar to cleanse wounds. The Greeks, specifically [[Hippocrates]] (430-377 bc), were also the first to establish the four cardinal signs of inflammation: redness, swelling, heat and pain.&lt;ref name="Shah 65–66"/&gt; Alcohol is still in use today as a wound cleanser largely as rubbing alcohol. However the side effects can be skin cell death resulting in inflammation and itchiness at the site of application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Debunking Myths of Wound Care|url = http://www.advancedtissue.com/debunking-myths-wound-care/|website = Advanced Tissue|accessdate = 2015-11-29|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Middle Ages ==
There were limited advances that continued throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], but the most profound advances, both technological and clinical, came with the development of [[microbiology]] and [[cellular pathology]] in the 19th century.

==19th century==
[[File:Joseph Lister c1855.jpg|thumb|This is a portrait of Joseph Lister who was the first doctor to begin to sterilize his surgical gauze.]]
The first advances in wound care in this era began with the work of [[Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis]], a Hungarian obstetrician who discovered how [[hand washing]] and cleanliness in general in medical procedures prevents [[maternal death]]s. Semmelweis's work was furthered by an English surgeon, [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], who in 1860s began treating his surgical gauze with carbolic acid, known today as [[phenol]], and subsequently dropped his surgical team's mortality rate by 45%. Building on the success of Lister's pretreated surgical gauze, [[Robert Wood Johnson I]], co-founder of [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], began in the 1890s producing gauze and wound dressings sterilized with dry heat, steam, and pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Brief History of Wound Care|url = http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00006534-200606001-00004|journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery|volume = 117|issue = SUPPLEMENT|doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000225429.76355.dd|first = George|last = Broughton|first2 = Jeffrey E.|last2 = Janis|first3 = Christopher E.|last3 = Attinger|page = 10S}}&lt;/ref&gt; These innovations in wound-site dressings marked the first major steps forward in the field since the advances of the Egyptians and Greeks centuries earlier. In 1886, [[Ernst von Bergmann]] introduced [[Sterilization (microbiology)|heat sterilization]] of [[surgical instrument]]s, which marked the beginning of [[aseptic surgery]] and significantly reduced the frequency of infections. [[Conrad Brunner (physician)|Conrad Brunner]] did extensive research into wound management and experimentation with wound disinfection methods, publishing his comprehensive ''Erfahrungen und Studien über Wundinfektion und Wundbehandlung''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Brunner, Conrad|year=1898|title=Erfahrungen und Studien über Wundinfektion und Wundbehandlung (Experiences and studies on wound infection and wound care)|publisher=J. Huber|location=Frauenfeld, Switzerland|oclc=14781957}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1898. That same year, [[Paul Leopold Friedrich]] introduced [[wound excision]] and experimentally showed that excision of open wounds substantially reduced the risk of infection. The next advances would arise from the development of [[polymer]] synthetics for wound dressings and the "rediscovery" of moist wound-site care protocols in the mid 20th century.

== Wound-site dressing ==
During World War I, chemist [[Henry Drysdale Dakin]] was consulted and invented [[Dakin's Solution]], sodium hypochlorate and boric acid, to wash out the traumatic wounds of British soldiers fighting in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Dakin's solution|encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica|url = http://www.britannica.com/science/Dakins-solution#ref65485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1950s onward ===
The advent in the 1950s of [[fibrous]] synthetics such as [[nylon]], [[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]], and [[polyvinyl]]s provided new materials from which researchers and doctors in the field of wound care could explore better protecting of healing wounds and even accelerating the natural wound healing process.

In the 1960s, research and articles by [[George D. Winter|George Winter]] and Howard Maibach reported on the superior efficacy of moist wound dressings. The adoption of moist wound dressing technique as recommended best wound dressing practice reflected a large advance in approach producing markedly superior clinical outcomes. This dawn of modern wound care treatment initiated a process of improvement in the clinician's ability to bolster wound-site re-epithelialization and healing. The focus on evidence-based best practices and research continues.

In the 1990s, improvements in composite and hybrid polymers expanded the range of materials available for wound dressing. Grafting and biotechnology have produced usable and useful protective covering of actual human skin generated through cloning procedures. These improvements, coupled with the developments in tissue engineering, have given rise to a number of new classes of wound dressings. One of these, "living skin equivalents, " is often cited as a misnomer because they lack key components of whole living skin. "Living skin equivalents" may have the potential to serve as cellular platforms for the release of growth factors essential for proper wound healing. Many biologics, skin substitutes, biomembranes and scaffolds have been developed to facilitate wound healing through various mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Vyas KS, Vasconez HC. Wound Healing: Biologics, Skin Substitutes, Biomembranes and Scaffolds. Healthcare. 2014; 2(3):356-400. http://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/2/3/356/htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Other recent developments has been the renewed focus on the prominent patient concern of pain. Burn patients and others affected by severe wounds often report pain as the dominant negative impact of the wounds on their lives.&lt;ref name="Krasner"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Krasner D |title=Painful venous ulcers: themes and stories about living with the pain and suffering |journal=J Wound Ostomy Continence Nurs |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=158–68 |date=May 1998 |pmid=9678007 |url=http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=1071-5754&amp;volume=25&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=158 |doi=10.1097/00152192-199805000-00008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical management of the pain associated with chronic wounds has been an emergency wound treatment priority and is now viewed as an integral part of treatment.

=== Modern wound care ===
&lt;!-- In this section, probably someone should add to the effect that pratitioners often advise that various types of wounds, at least minor ones, should ideally be covered by any ointment (e.g. antibiotic ointment, vaseline, other), to tend to increase the moistness of the scab or skin, [and to tend to decrease the chance of scarring?].  --&gt;
In modern-day 21st century, medicine has evolved to involve past treatments such as leech therapy, as well as advancing wound prevention and the treatment. A large part of wound care is wound treatment. This involves promoting healing, preventing infections, and getting rid of an already existent infection. Deciding on a treatment depends on the type of wound that a person has sustained. Varying from infections to burns, wound care is a priority in saving the limb, extremity, or life of a person. In a hospital or medical care setting, more severe wounds like diabetic ulcers, decubitus ulcers, and burns require sterile or clean (depending on the severity of the wound) dressings and wound care. The types of wound dressing include: dry dressings, wet-to-dry dressings, chemical-impregnated dressings, foam dressings, alginate dressings, hydrofiber dressings, transparent film dressings, hydrogel dressings, and hydrocolloid dressings. All of the listed dressing types require different materials to complete the dressing.

* [[Dressing (medical)#Gauze dressings|Dry dressing]]s: these dressings are typically composed of a gauze material and used for wounds with a small amount of drainage. These dressings are good for keeping the wound covered after cleaning and to promote healing as well as taking out small amounts of infection.
* [[Wet-to-dry dressing]]s: Although some medical facilities are stepping away from these types of dressings, they are used mostly for post-surgical wound care as well as debridement of wounds. These dressings take out necrotic areas as well as infections. In this type of wound dressing, gauze is soaked in saline, placed lightly inside of the wound, and covered with a dry dressing. Once the gauze dries, it can be removed. It dries onto the infection or necrotic areas to remove them. These dressings are being replaced by Wound-Vacs, which are attached to a dressing directly onto the wound, and lightly but continuously, pull and suck exudate and fluids from the wound.
* [[Chemical-impregnated dressing]]s: these are provided by manufacturers and they contain chemicals and agents that promote the healing process. Some of these dressings come in sheets and require secondary dressings.
* [[Foam dressing]]s: dressings that require additional padding utilize foam pads to help absorb and provide a moist healing environment. They also act as a shield to the wound and prevent any damage from friction or pressure. They can be tricky when applying and removing due to the surrounding skin.
* [[Alginate dressings]]: these dressings are composed of calcium, sodium salts and also provide a moist environment for the healing process. They are better used with a larger wound such as ulcers or donor sites.
* [[Hydro-fiber dressing]]s: these dressings are similar to alginate dressings when it comes to absorbing characteristics, but they do not affect hemostasis. They are composed in sheets which contain polymer carboxymethylcellulose and can be cut according to wound size and severity. However, when using these dressings, a secondary dressing is almost always required.
* [[Transparent film dressings]]: this specific type of dressing is more like a plastic covering for the wound. It allows oxygen to reach it and help heal but does not absorb any fluids. Transparent film dressings are used primarily on dry wounds.
* [[Hydrogel dressing]]s: this type of dressing is more directed towards infected areas and those in need of a moist environment to heal properly. It helps promote the body's own natural functions of removing necrotic tissue. It is advised not to be used on dry wounds.
* [[Hydrocolloid dressings]]: unlike transparent film dressings, hydrocolloid dressings do not allow oxygen to reach the wound. It is a wet-to-dry technique but is not recommended for infected areas. This type of dressing can last up to 7 days with a close eye and must be removed with care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Wound Care|url = http://www.atitesting.com/ati_next_gen/skillsmodules/content/wound-care/equipment/dressing_and_bandage_types.html|website = www.atitesting.com|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Self-adaptive dressing]]s: these super-absorbent fiber dressings rely on properties of [[smart polymer]]s sensitive to humidity levels. The dressing material responds to changes in wound moisture in real time and, when needed, can reverse its function (switching from absorption to hydration and back) over each specific area of the wound and periwound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ostomy Wound Management |url = http://www.o-wm.com/article/innovations-work |website = www.o-wm.com |accessdate = 2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of dressing can be used on most open wounds.

=== Alternative treatments for wounds: leeches and maggots ===
Medical leeches were cleared as a medical device in 2004 after being an indispensable tool in the 19th century. This unique use of creatures is utilized in many surgeries today. Leeches have the ability to assist with compromised tissue with the components of their saliva. Their saliva contains a local anesthetic, thrombin inhibitor, antibiotic properties and a histamine-like vasodilator. These capabilities help in surgeries such as transplants, skin grafts, and even reconstructive surgeries. The leeches help localize the wound and help produce blood flow. This is helpful in operations where blood clots occur and they help dilate the blood vessels.

Medical maggots were first utilized by military medical aids during World War 2. They worked as biomedical debriding agents by ingesting bacteria and break them down within their intestines. Maggots give off an enzyme that disinfects wounds and promotes healing and this is why they became the first organism in the United States that were used as a medical device in January 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/563656#vp_2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Houston Alfred Baker Jr.''' (born March 22, 1943) is an American scholar specializing in [[African-American literature]] and currently serving as a professor at [[Vanderbilt University]] in the [[English studies|English]] department.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2006/05/25/five-prominent-african-american-literature-scholars-to-move-to-vanderbilt-hortense-spillers-houston-baker-among-new-hires-58991 "Five prominent African American literature scholars to move to Vanderbilt"], ''Vanderbilt News Service''; accessed September 3, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baker served as president of the [[Modern Language Association]], editor of the journal ''[[American Literature (journal)|American Literature]]'', and has authored several books, including ''The Journey Back: Issues in Black Literature and Criticism'', ''Modernism and the [[Harlem Renaissance]]'', ''[[Blues]], Ideology, and Afro-American Literature'', and ''Workings of the Spirit: The Poetics of Afro-American Women's Writing''.&lt;ref name="RaceMatters"&gt;Eakin, Emily.

Routledge Key Guides series, 2006, pp. 3–9.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Baker was included in the 2006 textbook ''Fifty Key Literary Theorists'', by Richard J. Lane.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

==Early life==
Baker was born and raised in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], a city he later described as "racist" and "stultifying".&lt;ref name="CBB"&gt;"Houston A. Baker Jr." in ''Contemporary Black Biography'', Volume 6. Gale Research, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The racism and violence he claims to have experienced as a youth would later prompt him to conclude "I had been discriminated against and called '[[Nigger]]' enough to think that what America needed was a good Black Revolution."&lt;ref name="CBB"/&gt; He recently revised that judgment in his book combining memoir and critique titled ''I Don't Hate the South'' (Oxford University Press, 2007).

==Academic career==
Baker's academic career initially progressed along traditional lines. He earned a B.A. in English literature from [[Howard University]] and an M.A. and Ph.D. in Victorian literature from the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. He began teaching at [[Yale University]] and intended to write a biography of [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref name="RaceMatters"/&gt; In 1970 he joined the [[University of Virginia]]'s Center for Advanced Studies, and from 1974-77 he directed the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s Afro-American Studies Program.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

From 1977-99, Baker was a Professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania. Starting in 1982, he was the Albert M. Greenfield Professor of Human Relations, and in 1987 he also founded the university's Center for the Study of Black Literature and Culture, serving as the Center's director until 1999.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

From 1999 to 2006, Baker was the Susan Fox and George D. Beischer Professor of English and editor of ''American Literature'' at [[Duke University]]. In 2006, he became a Distinguished University Professor at [[Vanderbilt University]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Literary scholarship==
{{One source|section|date=February 2011}}
Baker's work in African American literary studies has been called "groundbreaking" for his ability to connect theory about the texts with the historical conditions of the beginning of the African American community, namely, both their uprooting from Africa and their ability to maintain their African heritage through an emphasis on spirituality and on autobiography, which allowed them to "reinforce and reinvent self-worth in the midst of their debasement".&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt; His work in the 1970s focused on locating and mapping the origins of the "black aesthetic", such as found in the Black Arts Movement and the attendant development of anthologies, journals and monographs about African-American literature.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

Baker's breakthrough work was 1980's ''The Journey Back: Issues in Black Literature and Criticism'', in which he critiques earlier discussions of the black aesthetic and calls for an interdisciplinary approach that would focus on the context of the literary works, which he claims are always "in motion".&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

Baker argues that the attempts to forge a black aesthetic in the 1960s were not simply descriptive, but actively creative and thus based on—and distorted by—the writers' idealism.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt; Baker offers history as a corrective, arguing that the black community has always created art forms in the face of oppression and that black artists need to "journey back" in order to "re-affirm the richness and complexity" of black aesthetic history and to recuperate lost aesthetic forms.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

Baker used this approach in his 1987 study, ''Modernism and the [[Harlem Renaissance]]'', in which he takes black critics to task for accepting the common notion that the Harlem Renaissance was a failure and then shows how notions of modernism based on European and Angloamerican texts are "inappropriate for understanding Afro-American modernism".&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt; He argues that by examining the literature of the Harlem Renaissance in conversation with contemporaneous developments in African American music, art and philosophy, we can identify the development of "new modes of production" that lead to a rebirth; Baker calls these modes "blues geographies".&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt; Baker points to [[Booker T. Washington]]'s [[Atlanta Exposition|1895 Exposition address]] as the beginning of African American modernist concerns, in that Washington both adopted and subverted a [[minstrel]] mask, thus creating a post-slavery African American [[Trope (literature)|trope]] that is both useful and restrictive.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

In ''Modernism and the Harlem Renaissance'', Baker argued for the importance of oral culture in the black aesthetic tradition, an idea he develops in his work on African American feminists in the essay "There Is No More Beautiful Way: Theory and the Poetics of Afro-American Women's Writing", which stresses the connection between oral culture and autobiography.&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

Baker's 1984 ''Blues, Ideology, and Afro-American Literature: A Vernacular Theory'' had also developed his ideas about blues geographies and about [[orality]], but had joined these ideas with developments in [[post-structuralism]], borrowing from the work of [[Hegel]] and [[Derrida]] to argue that [[blues]] music is a "matrix", a code that acts as the foundation for African American artistic production insofar as blues music synthesizes numerous types of early African American oral genres; he develops this notion of "blues geography" through his reading of key works by [[Frederick Douglass]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Ralph Ellison]], [[Amiri Baraka]], and [[Toni Morrison]].&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

In his analysis of Baker's contributions, Richard J. Lane claims that Baker's ability to connect literary theory with vernacular literature and to keep that combination connected to the material conditions of black life in the USA "provides a pedagogical model for [...] new ways of reading literature in general".&lt;ref name="Lane"/&gt;

==Views on race==
Holding "an exceedingly pessimistic view of American social progress where race is concerned," Baker has written many books on African Americans in modern American society. In ''Turning South Again: Rethinking Modernism/Rereading [[Booker T. Washington|Booker T]]'', Baker suggests being a black American, even a successful one, amounts to a kind of prison sentence.&lt;ref name="RaceMatters"/&gt;

Baker also harshly criticized President [[Barack Obama]]'s widely praised race-centered speech ([[A More Perfect Union (speech)|"A More Perfect Union"]]) stemming from controversial remarks given by his pastor: "Sen. Obama's 'race speech' at the National Constitution Center, draped in American flags, was reminiscent of the Parthenon concluding scene of [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'': a bizarre moment of mimicry, aping [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], while even further distancing himself from the real, economic, religious and political issues so courageously articulated by King from a Birmingham jail. In brief, Obama's speech was a [[pandering (politics)|pandering]] disaster that threw, once again, his pastor under the bus."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2008/04/29/obama_wright/|title=What should Obama do about Rev. Jeremiah Wright?|accessdate=April 29, 2008|last=Baker|first=Houston A. Jr.|date=April 29, 2008|publisher=Salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 Duke University lacrosse case==
During the [[2006 Duke University lacrosse case]], Baker published an open letter calling for Duke to dismiss the team and its players.  Baker claimed that "white, male, athletic privilege" was responsible for the alleged rape.&lt;ref name="BakerLetter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/mmedia/features/lacrosse_incident/lange_baker.html|title=Provost Responds to Faculty Letter Regarding Lacrosse|publisher=Duke News &amp; Communications|date=April 3, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224045201/http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/mmedia/features/lacrosse_incident/lange_baker.html|archivedate=December 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baker suggested that the Duke administration was "sweeping things under the rug."&lt;ref name="BakerLetter"/&gt; More generally, Baker's letter criticized colleges and universities for the "blind-eyeing of male athletes, veritably given license to rape, maraud, deploy hate speech, and feel proud of themselves in the bargain."&lt;ref name="BakerLetter"/&gt;

Duke Provost Peter Lange responded to Baker's letter a few days later, criticizing Baker for prejudging the team based on their race and gender, citing this as a classic tactic of racism.&lt;ref name="BakerLetter"/&gt; Lange, the longest-serving provost in Duke's history, stepped down in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://today.duke.edu/2013/08/langeretire|title=Lange to Conclude Service as Provost|website=Today.duke.edu|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, charges against the players were dropped and the state's Attorney General took the extraordinary step of declaring the students innocent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2007-04-11/justice/cooper.transcript_1_sexual-assault-durham-county-district-attorney-evidence?_s=PM:LAW "N.C. attorney general: Duke players 'innocent'"], CNN Justice, April 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the exoneration of the players, one of the parents of a Duke lacrosse player emailed Baker and reported that he responded by writing that she was "quite sadly, mother of a 'farm animal'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Applebome]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/nyregion/15towns.html "After Duke Prosecution Began to Collapse, Demonizing Continued"], ''[[New York Times]]'', April 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{linguistics}}
'''Idiolect''' is an individual's distinctive and unique use of [[language]], including speech. This unique usage encompasses [[vocabulary]], [[grammar]], and [[pronunciation]]. 

Idiolect is the [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] of language unique to an individual.  This differs from a [[dialect]], a common set of [[linguistics|linguistic]] characteristics shared among some group of people.

The term idiolect refers to the language of an individual. It is etymologically related to the Greek prefix ''idio-'' (meaning "own, personal, private, peculiar, separate, distinct") and a back-formation of ''dialect''.

==Language==
The notion of ''language'' is used as an abstract description of the ''language use'', and of the abilities of individual speakers and listeners.&lt;ref name=Zuckermann&gt;Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2006), "A New Vision for 'Israeli Hebrew': Theoretical and Practical Implications of Analysing Israel's Main Language as a Semi-Engineered Semito-European Hybrid Language." ''Journal of Modern Jewish Studies'' 5 (1):57–71&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=January 2018|reason=ref only treats Hebrew}} According to this view, a language is an "ensemble of idiolects ... rather than an entity per se".&lt;ref name=Zuckermann/&gt; Linguists study particular languages, such as [[English language|English]] or [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], by examining the [[utterance]]s produced by the people who speak the language.

This contrasts with a view among non-linguists, at least in the United States, that languages as [[Platonic idealism|ideal]] systems exist outside the actual practice of language users: Based on work done in the US, Nancy Niedzielski and Dennis Preston describe a [[language ideology]] that appears to be common among American English speakers. According to Niedzielski and Preston, many of their subjects believe that there is one "correct" pattern of grammar and vocabulary that underlies [[Standard English]], and that individual usage comes from this external system.&lt;ref&gt;Niedzielski, Nancy &amp; Dennis Preston (2000) ''Folk Linguistics''. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists who understand particular languages as a composite of unique, individual idiolects must nonetheless account for the fact that members of large [[Speech community|speech communities]], and even speakers of different dialects of the same language, can understand one another. All human beings seem to produce language in essentially the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Gleitman, Lila (1993) "A human universal: the capacity to learn a language." Modern Philology 90:S13-S33.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to searches for [[universal grammar]], as well as attempts to further define the nature of particular languages.

==Forensic linguistics==
{{main|Forensic linguistics}}
The scope of forensic linguistics includes attempts to identify whether a certain person did or did not produce a given text by comparing the style of the text with the idiolect of the individual. The forensic linguist may conclude that the text is consistent with the individual, rule out the individual as the author, or deem the comparison inconclusive.&lt;ref&gt;McMenamin, Gerald R. &amp; Dongdoo Choi (2002) ''Forensic Linguistics: Advances in Forensic Stylistics''. London: CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 [[Max Appedole]] relied in part on an analysis of Rafael Sebastián Guillén Vicente's writing style to identify him as [[Subcomandante Marcos]], a leader of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista movement]]. Though the [[Mexican government]] regarded Subcomandante Marcos as a dangerous guerilla, Appedole convinced them that Guillén was a pacifist. These events are credited as an early success of forensic linguistics in criminal profiling in law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=243839|title=Marcos, en la mira de Zedillo - Proceso|date=5 August 2002|publisher=|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.proceso.com.mx/?page_id=278958&amp;a51dc26366d99bb5fa29cea4747565fec=169802&amp;rl=wh |title=Maestros y condiscípulos de Tampico recuerdan a Rafael Guillén|subscription=yes|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 [[Ted Kaczynski]] was convicted of a series of bombings known as the "Unabomber" case. FBI profilers identified a number of linguistic idiosyncrasies in an essay published by the Unabomber, which led them to conclude that Kaczynski was the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Lingua Franca|year=1998|pages=29–39|title=The Bard's fingerprints|last=Crain|first=Caleb|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9807/crain.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Loving Natalee: A Mother's Testament of Hope and Faith''''' is an autobiography written by [[Beth Holloway]] about her missing daughter [[Natalee Holloway]], with portions contributed by Sunny Tillman.&lt;ref name="Library-of-Congress"&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalog record: ''Loving Natalee: A Mother's Testament of Hope and Faith''|url=http://lccn.loc.gov/2008299428|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in October 2007 by HarperOne, an [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] of [[HarperCollins]], and has also been marketed under its alternate [[subtitle (titling)|subtitle]] ''The True Story of the Aruba Kidnapping and Its Aftermath''.&lt;ref name="HC-paperback"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Loving Natalee: The True Story of the Aruba Kidnapping and Its Aftermath'' (mass market paperback)|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/?isbn=9780061468797|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|accessdate=August 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Holloway said that she vowed to share her story shortly following her daughter's disappearance, in the hope that other families would not suffer what she had to go through. After five months of unsuccessfully searching on [[Aruba]], her attorney John Q. Kelly took over the case and she spent the next two years traveling to various high schools and colleges to present messages about personal safety. When she thought about reaching more travelers with her story, Holloway said that her efforts evolved into writing a book.&lt;ref name="LMN-Holloway-interview"&gt;{{cite web

==Summary==
The book retells events leading up to the night Natalee Holloway disappeared during a high school graduation trip to Aruba in 2005, and the ensuing investigation in the aftermath. It then focuses on the obstacles faced by the Holloway-Twitty family in their search for Natalee's whereabouts.&lt;ref name="TrueCrimeBookReviews"&gt;{{cite web|title=Loving Natalee by Beth Holloway|url=http://truecrimebookreviews.blogspot.com/2009/06/loving-natalee-by-beth-holloway.html|publisher=True Crime Book Reviews|accessdate=August 20, 2010|date=June 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holloway recounts her anger at what she felt was a lack of cooperation from local authorities such as the [[Aruba Police Force]], including the failure to obtain a warrant to search the home of suspect [[Joran van der Sloot]].&lt;ref name="DeseretNews-20071007-heartbreaking"&gt;{{cite news|title='Natalee' heartbreaking story|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/695216138/Natalee-heartbreaking-story.html|author=Dennis Lythgoe|newspaper=[[Deseret News]]|accessdate=August 25, 2010|date=October 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dennis Lythgoe of ''[[Deseret News]]'', noting that the book was [[ghostwriter|ghostwritten]], remarked that it was "not very well-written", but complimented it as "a compelling glimpse of this mother's electric personality."&lt;ref name="DeseretNews-20071007-heartbreaking" /&gt;

==Film adaptation==
{{main|Natalee Holloway (film)}}
In October 2008, the [[Lifetime Movie Network]] announced plans to create a television film title based on the book. The senior vice president of original movies, Tanya Lopez, stated in the announcement that the network was "pleased to be working closely with Natalee's mother" and that they intended to tell the story of Holloway's disappearance "sensitively and accurately."&lt;ref name="UPI-20081007"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2008/10/07/Lifetime-planning-Natalee-Holloway-movie/UPI-71421223415829/|title=Lifetime planning Natalee Holloway movie|accessdate=June 15, 2009|date=October 7, 2008|agency=[[United Press International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jarett Wieselman of the ''[[New York Post]]'' questioned whether it was too soon for such a film to be made.&lt;ref name="NYP-20090713"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/item_iiOLQ5Ety2IndyQHxWkyRP |title=Natalee Holloway Movie: Too Soon? |accessdate=August 20, 2010 |date=July 13, 2009 |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |first=Jarett |last=Wieselman |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001030911/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/item_iiOLQ5Ety2IndyQHxWkyRP |archivedate=October 1, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The April 19, 2009 broadcast of ''[[Natalee Holloway (film)|Natalee Holloway]]'' attracted 3.2 million viewers, garnering the highest [[Nielsen ratings|television ratings]] in the network's 11-year history.&lt;ref name=Variety-20090420-movie&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118002635.html|title=Lifetime Movie scores with 'Holloway|accessdate=June 15, 2009|date=April 20, 2009|last=Kissel|first=Rick|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it set ratings records for Lifetime, the movie was not received well by critic Alec Harvey of ''[[The Birmingham News]]''. Harvey called the movie "sloppy and uneven, a forgettable look at the tragedy that consumed the nation's attention for months".&lt;ref name="HarveyReview-20090417"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/aharvey/2009/04/natalee_holloway_a_disappointi.html |title='Natalee Holloway' a disappointing TV movie |date=April 17, 2009|accessdate=June 15, 2009|last=Harvey |first=Alec |newspaper=The Birmingham News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jake Meaney of ''[[PopMatters]]'' found the film to be surprisingly "calm and levelheaded", and praised [[Tracy Pollan]]'s portrayal of Holloway's mother.&lt;ref name="PopMatters-review"&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: Natalee Holloway|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/118543-natalee-holloway/|author=Jake Meaney|work=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=August 20, 2010|date=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joran van der Sloot himself watched the film one evening in 2010, according to his friend John Ludwick, and said that some parts were true while others were not.&lt;ref name="CNN-20100616"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nancygrace.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/16/friend-of-two-time-suspected-killer-joran-van-der-sloot-breaks-silence/|title=Friend of two-time suspected killer Joran van der Sloot breaks silence|date=June 16, 2010|accessdate=August 23, 2010|last=Nancy Grace|publisher=[[CNN]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622035151/http://nancygrace.blogs.cnn.com/2010/06/16/friend-of-two-time-suspected-killer-joran-van-der-sloot-breaks-silence/|archivedate=June 22, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tübingen 1963-72) vol. III, pp 268-69.&lt;/ref&gt; thus the Roman god of war receives his Greek name, [[Ares]].

Ares/Mars is portrayed as young and beardless and seated on a trophy of arms, while an [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]] plays about his feet, drawing attention to the fact that the god of war, in a moment of repose, is presented as a love object. The 18th-century connoisseur [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], a man with a practiced eye for male beauty, found the Ludovisi Ares the most beautiful Mars that had been preserved from [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], when he wrote the catalogue of the [[:Category:Ludovisi collection|Ludovisi collection]].

Rediscovered in 1622, the sculpture was apparently originally part of the temple of Mars (founded in 132 BCE in the southern part of the [[Campus Martius]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/615930 The southern part of the Campus Martius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051220164752/http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/615930 |date=2005-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), of which few traces remain, for it was recovered near the site of the church of San Salvatore in Campo. [[Pietro Santi Bartoli]] recorded in his notes that it had been found near the Palazzo Santa Croce in [[Rioni of Rome|Rione Campitelli]] during the digging of a drain. (Haskell and Penny 1981:260) The sculpture found its way into the collection formed by Cardinal [[Ludovico Ludovisi]] (1595&amp;ndash;1632) the nephew of [[Pope Gregory XV]] at the splendid [[Villa Ludovisi|villa and gardens]] he built near [[Porta Pinciana]], on the site where Julius Caesar and his heir, Octavian (Caesar Augustus), had had their villa. The sculpture was lightly restored by the young [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], who refinished its surfaces and discreetly provided a right foot; he was probably largely responsible for the cupid, which Haskell and Penny note was omitted from G.F. Susini's bronze replica and from the prints of the sculpture in Maffei's anthology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paolo Alessandro Maffei]], ''Raccota di statue antiche e moderne... Rome, 1704, noted by Haskell and Penny 1981:260 and note 19.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Ares Ludovisi Altemps Inv8602.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The ''Ludovisi Ares'']]
The sculpture was a sensational find. A small-scale bronze replica of it was executed by [[Gian Francesco Susini|G.F. Susini]], heir and assistant to his more famous uncle [[Antonio Susini]], when he visited Rome in the 1630s and copied several marbles from Ludovisi's collection; a bronze of the Ludovisi Ares is in the [[Ashmolean Museum]], Oxford. Later, the Ludovisi Ares was one of the featured antiquities to be seen on the "[[grand tour]]". For example, the portrait of English tourist John Talbot (later first Earl Talbot) by Pompeo Batoni depicts him next to the statue to display his culture and showing his familiarity with great works of art.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=767 Batoni portrait of Talbot (1773)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702144821/http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=767 |date=2012-07-02 }} is now at the [[J. Paul Getty Museum|Getty Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; Less expensive representations could be found: [[Giambattista Piranesi]]'s son Francesco made an engraving of it at the Villa Ludovisi in 1783 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091634/http://search.famsf.org:8080/view.shtml?record=59316&amp;=list&amp;=1&amp;=&amp;=And]. Casts of the Ludovisi Ares found their way into early museum collections, such as the Copenhagen Glyptotek [https://web.archive.org/web/20051023010201/http://homepage.mac.com/cparada/GML/000Free/000Ares/source/8.html] and were influential to several generations of [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] and [[Academy|academic]] students.

In 1901, the eventual heir, prince Boncompagni-Ludovisi, brought the Ludovisi antiquities to auction. The Italian state purchased 96 of the objects, and the rest have been dispersed among the museums of Europe and the US. The Ares is conserved in the section of the National Museum of the Terme that is housed in [[Palazzo Altemps]], Rome.

A depiction of the statue is used as an emblem for the Greek athletic club [[Aris Thessaloniki]].

'''''Mariano Moreno en su mesa de trabajo''''' ({{lang-es|Mariano Moreno at his work desk}}) is a portrait by the [[Chile]]an artist [[Pedro Subercaseaux]]. It shows the [[artist's interpretation]] of [[Mariano Moreno]], Secretary of War of the [[United Provinces of the River Plate|Argentine]] [[Primera Junta]], the first national government, working at his desk. It is currently regarded as the canonical image of Moreno.&lt;ref name="Balmaceda"&gt;{{cite book |title= Historias de corceles y de acero|last= Balmaceda|first= Daniel|authorlink= Daniel Balmaceda|year= 2010|publisher= Sudamericana|location= Buenos Aires|isbn= 978-950-07-3180-5|pages=121–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Description==
[[File:Mariano Moreno en su mesa de trabajo (borrador).JPG|thumb|left|Draft version of the portrait.]]

The portrait was requested to Subercaseaux by [[Antonio Carranza]] in 1908, in the context of the proximity of the [[Argentina Centennial]] two years later. His instructions were that the portrait should represent Mariano Moreno while working hard, late in the night, writing with a [[quill]], with many papers scattered around, and worried by the gravity of the measures being taken.&lt;ref name="Balmaceda"/&gt; 

Subercaseaux was not very satisfied with his work, thinking that his version of Moreno was not as thin as Moreno was reported to be.&lt;ref name="Balmaceda"/&gt;

The portrait is currently kept at the [[National Historical Museum (Argentina)|National Historical Museum]].

[[Belize]] is considered part of the [[Geography of Mesoamerica#Maya Region|southern Maya lowlands]] of the [[Mesoamerica]]n [[culture area]], and the sites found there were occupied from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic]] (2000 BCE–200 CE) until and after the arrival of the [[Spain|Spanish]] in the 16th century.

Many sites are in danger due to destruction by construction companies, which frequently source road fill from the ancient ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/14/mayan-pyramid-bulldozed-road-construction | title=Mayan pyramid bulldozed by road construction firm | publisher=Guardian | accessdate=2013-05-14 | location=London | date=2013-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caracol==
Historically the most important site, [[Caracol]] ('the snail' in Spanish), is located in western Belize, near the border with [[Guatemala]] and within the Belizean part of the [[El Petén|Peten]] [[rainforest]]. Caracol was the center of one of the largest Maya kingdoms and today contains the extant remains of thousands of structures.  The city was an important player in the Classic period political struggles of the southern Maya lowlands, and is known for defeating and subjugating [[Tikal]] (while allied with [[Calakmul]], located in [[Campeche]], [[Mexico]]).

==Cerros==
The site of [[Cerros]], located on [[Corozal Bay]] in northern Belize, is notable as one of the earliest Maya sites, reaching its apogee during the Late Preclassic on [[Corozal Bay]], and for the presence of an [[E-Group]], a unique structural complex found in [[Maya architecture]].

==Lamanai==
[[Lamanai]], located on the New River in [[Orange Walk District]], is known for being the longest continually-occupied site in [[Mesoamerica]].  The initial settlement of Lamanai occurred during the Early Preclassic, and it was continuously occupied up to and through the [[colonization]] of the area.  During the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]], the [[conquistador]]es established a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Church (building)|church]] at Lamanai, but a revolt by the native [[Maya peoples|Maya]] drove them away.  The extant remains of the church are still standing today.

[[File:National Humanities Medal cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The obverse of the National Humanities Medal]]

The '''National Humanities Medal''' is an American award that annually recognizes several individuals, groups, or institutions for work that has "deepened the nation's understanding of the humanities, broadened our citizens' engagement with the humanities, or helped preserve and expand Americans' access to important resources in the humanities."&lt;ref name=awards&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/awards.html |title=Awards and Honors |publisher=[[National Endowment for the Humanities]] |accessdate=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- is it always, or always nowadays, or not always conferred ceremonially by the US President? --&gt;

The annual '''[[Charles Frankel]] Prize in the Humanities''' was established in 1988 and succeeded by the National Humanities Medal in 1997. The initial design for the National Humanities Medal was created by a 1995 Frankel Prize winner, [[David Macaulay]], and was used for all recipients through 2012.&lt;ref name=awards /&gt; During 2013, The National Endowment for the Humanities ran a public competition for a new medal design, judged by metalsmith [[Chunghi Choo]], coin engraver [[Don Everhart]] of the [[United States Mint|U.S. Mint]] and sculptor [[George Anthonisen]]. In June 2013, the agency announced that a design by Paul C. Balan of Illinois had been selected as the winner. The final medal will be unveiled in Washington D.C. in November 2013. The new design was used for the first time for the 2013 National Humanities Medals, which were presented in mid-2014.&lt;ref name=NewNHM2013&gt;{{cite web |title=Paul C.

Medals are conferred once annually, usually by the U.S. President, to as many as twelve living candidates and existing organizations nominated early in the calendar year. The President selects the winners in consultation with the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref name=nominations&gt;{{cite  web |url=http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/medalsnominate.html |title=National Humanities Medals Nominations |publisher=National Endowment for the Humanities |accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NEH asks that nominators consult the list of previous winners and consider the [[National Medal of Arts]] to recognize contributions in "the creative or performing arts".&lt;ref name=nominations /&gt;

The '''political ponerology''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] study of [[social issues]] primarily associated with Polish psychiatrist Andrzej Łobaczewski.&lt;ref name=pps&gt;Łobaczewski, Andrzej, ''Political Ponerology: A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes'' (Grande Prairie: Red Pill Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-897244-25-8}}), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; As a discipline it makes use of data from psychology, sociology, philosophy, and history to account for such phenomena as [[aggressive war]], [[ethnic cleansing]], [[genocide]], and [[despotism]].

==Andrzej Łobaczewski and early research group==

During [[World War II]], Łobaczewski worked for the Polish [[Home Army]], an underground Polish resistance organization. After the war, he studied at [[Jagiellonian University]] under professor of psychiatry Edward Brzezicki.&lt;ref&gt;Łobaczewski (2006), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Łobaczewski's class was the last to receive an education uninfluenced by Soviet ideology and censorship, after which psychiatry was restricted to [[Ivan Pavlov|Pavlovian]] concepts. The study of [[genetics]] and [[psychopathy]] was [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|forbidden]].

The original theory and research was conducted by a research group of psychologists and psychiatrists from [[Poland]], [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[History of Hungary|pre-communist]] [[Hungary]]. The group was brought together by Łobaczewski and included [[Kazimierz Dąbrowski]], [[Stefan Szuman]], and [[Stefan Błachowski]], and many other anonymous contributors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sott.net/articles/show/203026-Lobaczewski-and-the-origins-of-Political-Ponerology In Memoriam: Andrzej M. Łobaczewski], ''sott.net'' interview, accessed September 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dąbrowski, Kazimierz, ''The Dynamics of Concepts'' (London: Gryf Publications, 1973), pp. 37-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychopathology and politics==

{{refimprove section|date=November 2018}}

Łobaczewski adopted the term "[[ponerology]]", which is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''poneros'', from the branch of [[theology]] dealing with the study of [[evil]]. According to Łobaczewski, all societies vacillate between "happy times" and "unhappy times". During happy times, societies enjoy prosperity and suppress advanced psychological knowledge of psychopathological influence in the corridors of power. Though happy, these times are not necessarily morally advanced as the society's prosperity or happiness may be premised on the oppression of a target group. During unhappy times, the intelligentsia and society at large can recover this specialized knowledge to resolve the social order along mentally healthier lines.&lt;ref name=pps/&gt;

A form of government interesting to ponerologists is one they have called ''pathocracy'', in which individuals with [[personality disorders]] (especially [[psychopathy]]) occupy positions of power and influence. The result is a [[totalitarian]] system characterized by a government turned against its own people. A pathocracy may emerge when a society is insufficiently guarded against the typical and inevitable minority of such abnormal pathology, which Łobaczewski asserts is caused by biology or genetics. He argues that in such cases these individuals infiltrate an institution or state, prevailing moral values are perverted into their opposite, and a coded language like [[Orwellian|Orwell's]] [[doublethink]] circulates into the mainstream, using paralogic and paramoralism in place of genuine logic and morality.

There are various identifiable stages of pathocracy described by Łobaczewski. Ultimately, each pathocracy is foredoomed because the root of healthy social morality, according to Łobaczewski, is contained in the congenital instinctive infrastructure in the vast majority of the population. While some in the normal population are more susceptible to pathocratic influence, and become its lackeys, the majority instinctively resist.

The wave of violence dimmed after the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état]].

==History==

===Background===
In 1975 [[Süleyman Demirel]], president of the conservative [[Justice Party (Turkey)|Justice Party]] ({{lang-tr|Adalet Partisi}}, AP) succeeded [[Bülent Ecevit]], president of the social-democratic [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] ({{lang-tr|Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi}}, CHP) as Prime Minister. He formed a coalition called "the Nationalist Front ({{lang-tr|Milliyetçi Cephe}})" with [[Necmettin Erbakan]]'s Islamist [[National Salvation Party]] ({{lang-tr|Millî Selamet Partisi}}, MSP), and [[Alparslan Türkeş]]' far right [[Nationalist Movement Party]] ({{lang-tr|Milliyetçi Hareket Partisi}}, MHP). The MHP used the opportunity to infiltrate state security services, seriously aggravating the low-intensity war that was waging between rival factions.&lt;ref name="Gil"&gt;Gil, Ata. "La Turquie à marche forcée," ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', February 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Turkish general election, 1977|elections of 1977]] had no winner. First, Demirel continued the coalition with the Nationalist Front, but in 1978, Ecevit was able to get to power again with the help of some deputies who had shifted from one party to another. In 1979, Demirel once again became Prime Minister. At the end of the 1970s, Turkey was in an unstable situation with unsolved economic and social problems facing strike actions and partial paralysis of politics (the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] was unable to elect a President during the six months preceding the coup). Since 1968–69, a [[proportional representation]] system had made it difficult to find any parliamentary majority. The interests of the industrial [[bourgeoisie]], which held the largest holdings of the country, were opposed by other [[social class]]es such as smaller industrialists, traders, rural notables, and landlords, whose interests did not always coincide among themselves. Numerous agricultural and industrial reforms requested by parts of the middle upper classes were blocked by others.&lt;ref name=Gil/&gt; Henceforth, the politicians seemed unable to combat the growing violence in the country.

===Sequence of events===
Unprecedented political violence had erupted in Turkey in the late 1970s. The overall death toll of the 1970s is estimated at 5,000, with nearly ten assassinations per day.&lt;ref name=Gil/&gt; Most were members of left-wing and right-wing political organizations, then engaged in bitter fighting. The ultra-nationalist [[Grey Wolves (organization)|Grey Wolves]], youth organisation of the [[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]], claimed they were supporting the security forces.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;{{cite book| title = Turkey| year = 1988| publisher = Amnesty International| isbn = 978-0-86210-156-5| page = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the British ''[[Searchlight (magazine)|Searchlight magazine]]'', in 1978 there were 3,319 [[fascist]] attacks, in which 831 were killed and 3,121 wounded.&lt;ref name="searchlight"&gt;''[[Searchlight (magazine)]]'', No.47 (May 1979), pg. 6. Quoted by {{Harvard citation|Herman|Brodhead|1986|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the central trial against the left-wing organization [[Devrimci Yol]] (Revolutionary Path) at Ankara Military Court the defendants listed 5,388 political killings before the military coup. Among the victims were 1,296 right-wingers and 2,109 left-wingers. The others could not clearly be related.&lt;ref&gt;Devrimci Yol Savunması (Defense of the Revolutionary Path). Ankara, January 1989, p. 118-119.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1978 [[Bahçelievler Massacre]], the 1977 [[Taksim Square massacre]] with 35 victims and the 1978 [[Maraş massacre]] with over 100 victims are some notable incidents. Martial law was announced following the [[Kahramanmaraş Massacre]] in 14 of (then) 67 provinces in December 1978. At the time of the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état|coup]] martial law had been extended to 20 provinces.

Ecevit was warned about the coming coup in June 1979 by [[Nuri Gündeş]] of the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|National Intelligence Organization]] (MİT). Ecevit then told his interior minister, [[İrfan Özaydınlı]], who then told [[Sedat Celasun]]—one of the five generals who would lead the coup. The deputy undersecretary of the MİT, Nihat Yıldız, was demoted to the London consulate and replaced by a lieutenant general as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/2007/07/18/haber,F2F7DAEDBD12405DA139F5C7B988FEF6.html |accessdate=2008-12-18 |title=Çalınan silahlar falcıya soruldu |date=2007-07-17 |first=Ferhat |last=Ünlü |work=Sabah |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830082751/http://www.sabah.com.tr/2007/07/18/haber,F2F7DAEDBD12405DA139F5C7B988FEF6.html |archivedate=30 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kurdish separatism==
{{POV-section|date=November 2014}}
The right-wing groups were opposed towards Kurdish separatism. Disproportionate numbers of Kurds were part of the left-wing groups. Most of the left was also Turkish nationalist and opposed towards separatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Romano| first = David| title = The Kurdish Nationalist Movement Opportunity, Mobilization and Identity| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ohSNu6bidEQC&amp;pg=PA46| year = 2006| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-68426-2| page = 46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the coup of 1980 only a minority of the violence was committed by separatists, after that it increased.

'''Public Smog''' is an "atmospheric park" created by [[San Francisco]]-based artist [[Amy Balkin]] and her supporters through the use of financial, political, and legal methods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicsmog.org// Public Smog website]&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of Public Smog is to "highlight the complexities and contradictions of current environmental protocols.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cca.rca.ac.uk/publicsmog/documents/PressRelease_publicsmog.pdf Press Release from the Royal College of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

The public smog atmospheric park consists of two areas which fluctuate in size and location. The upper park opened above the [[European Union]] in 2006 and the lower park is located over [[California]]’s South Coast Air Quality Management District’s Coastal Zone in 2004. Each was opened up through the purchasing of emissions offsets and then retiring the purchased air from use. Both parts of the park are currently closed.

==Methodology==

Some of the main methods used to create Public Smog are the purchase and withholding of [[emissions offsets]] and attempting to add the Earth's atmosphere to [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage List]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200612040038 'The New Romantics' ''The New Statesman'' December 4, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social media]] played a predominant role in shaping the course of major events leading up to, during, and after the [[United States presidential election, 2016|United States presidential election of 2016]]. It enabled people to have a greater interaction with&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;political landscape, controversies, and news surrounding the candidates involved. Unlike traditional news platforms, such as&amp;nbsp;newspapers, radio, and magazines, social media gave people the ability to share, comment, and post below a candidate's advertisement, news surrounding the candidates, or articles regarding the policy of the candidates. This accessibility, in turn, would have a great influence on the events that ultimately led to its outcome.

Candidates would often use multiple social media accounts, such as [[YouTube]], [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], and [[Snapchat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2009/10/19/social-media-local-politics/|title=How Local Politicians Are Using Social Media|last=Sternberg|first=Josh|website=Mashable|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the digital architecture of each platform, candidates would post, create support videos, link to news articles, and challenge other candidates via fact-checking, discrediting, and response. In turn, users could share, like, or comment on these actions, furthering the candidates outreach. By doing so, candidates and users both would influence or change peoples views on a specific issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/07/social-media-causes-some-users-to-rethink-their-views-on-an-issue/|title=Social media causes some users to rethink their views on an issue|date=2016-11-07|work=Pew Research Center|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With candidates using different combinations of these actions, they built a unique style of communication with the public, influencing the portrayal of themselves in the news, and in their own accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.journalism.org/2016/07/18/election-2016-campaigns-as-a-direct-source-of-news/|title=Election 2016: Campaigns as a Direct Source of News [Pg. 2-3]|date=2016-07-18|website=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These accounts then would help build electoral coalitions, which identify voters and, in turn, raise money. As a result, they ultimately aided in voter mobilization and electoral impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/ten-ways-social-media-can-improve-campaign-engagement-and-reinvigorate-american-democracy/|title=Ten Ways Social Media Can Improve Campaign Engagement and Reinvigorate American Democracy {{!}} Brookings Institution|date=2017-04-12|work=Brookings|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers from Stanford have found that 62% of U.S. adults get their news on social media and that people are more likely to believe in news favoring their choice of candidate, especially if they have ideologically segregated social networks&lt;ref&gt;H.Allcott &amp; M.Gentzkow (2017).

Accessed 03.05.2017. https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/fakenews.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the campaign, candidates have debated over [[Immigration policy|immigrational]], [[Foreign policy|foreign]], [[Economic policy|economic]], [[Health policy|healthcare]], [[Criminal justice|criminal]], [[Domestic policy|domestic]], [[Education policy|educational]], [[Environmental policy|environmental]], and [[Electoral system|electoral]] policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/year-ahead-project/|title=The Big Issues Of The 2016 Campaign|date=2015-11-19|work=FiveThirtyEight|access-date=2017-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using social media, they expanded their base further beyond the broadcast debates, both in the [[Republican Party presidential debates and forums, 2016|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party presidential debates and forums, 2016|Democratic]] primary, and in the [[United States presidential debates, 2016|general election]].

==Background==
As the campaign began, analysts assumed that, because of the increased reach and capacity of social media sites of all kinds since the last election cycle, social media would be used in potentially powerful new ways. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' predicted that the use of campaign advertisements targeted at individuals using newly available data would be among the more notable innovations.&lt;ref name="AndrewsTargeted"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/candidates-poised-to-spread-their-message-through-social-media-1438813048|title=Candidates Poised to Spread Their Message Through Social Media Ads|date=August 5, 2015|publisher=Wall Street Journal|last1=Andrews|first1=Natalie|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political newspaper, ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', concluded not only that "[s]ocial media's influence in this presidential election is stronger than it has ever been," but that it "will shape campaigns for years to come."&lt;ref name="LangSocialMediaCircus"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lang|first1=Marissa|title=2016 Presidential Election Circus: Is Social Media the Cause?|url=http://www.govtech.com/social/2016-Presidential-Election-Circus-Is-Social-Media-the-Cause.html|accessdate=May 18, 2016|publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Wall Street Journal'', the "traditional media" and the Democratic and Republican parties have lost "dominance" of public opinion to the "digital revolution."&lt;ref name="PowersInfluencing"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powers|first1=William|title=Who’s Influencing Election 2016?|url=https://medium.com/mit-media-lab/who-s-influencing-election-2016-8bed68ddecc3#.jjwk3dcf1|accessdate=May 18, 2016|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=February 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank Speiser, co-founder of [[SocialFlow]], said, "This is the first true social media election." He added that before the 2016 presidential primaries, social media were a mere "auxiliary method of communication," but in this new era, "folks on social media to act on your behalf by just sharing it around. You don't have to buy access to reach millions of people anymore." According to Republican political strategist [[Patrick Ruffini]], in the 2012 election cycle, candidates would make short statements, and re-tweet or thank followers.&lt;ref name="LangSocialMediaCircus"/&gt; The candidates were able to use social media to get free advertising from their supporters. Attendees of political rallies would take photos with the candidates that would then be shared on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. This generates more visibility for the candidate at no cost to them.&lt;ref&gt;http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=7993e5b9-0a6e-4600-8201-e885b8cfb0c5@sessionmgr4008&amp;hid=4111&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=112057883&amp;db=f5h{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Guardian]]'' compared [[Internet meme]]s to [[political cartoon]]s, arguing, "For the first time in a US election cycle, community-generated memes have grown to play a significant role in political discourse, similar to the classic printed cartoon." While an Internet meme is unlikely to destroy a political career, lots of memes targeting a candidate might.&lt;ref name="AlexanderZodiac"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Leigh|title=Blame it on the Zodiac killer: did social media ruin Ted Cruz's campaign?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/04/ted-cruz-campaign-social-media-memes-zodiac-killer|accessdate=May 18, 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=May 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump presidential campaign]] benefited from large numbers of supporters who were active on social media from the beginning of the campaign.
Donald Trump was perhaps one of the most provocative presidents in recent times, creating a strong divide within the country as there seemed to be very few people who felt only moderate feelings for him. With such a large divide created, it is no surprise that issues would arise on the Internet from both the supporters, who would call themselves "Centipedes" online&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/opinion/sunday/reddit-and-the-god-emperor-of-the-internet.html|title=Opinion - Reddit and the God Emperor of the Internet|first=Christine|last=Lagorio-Chafkin|date=19 November 2016|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the liberals (who sometimes refer to each other as comrades online).

In the first [[Republican Party presidential debates and forums, 2016|Republican Presidential debate]], held on August 6, 2015, the moderator asked candidate [[Jeb Bush]] if he stood by a statement made the previous April that illegal entry into the U.S. by undocumented migrants is "an act of love."&lt;ref name="Fehrnstrom"&gt;{{cite news |last = Fehrnstrom |first =Eric |title= A punch-drunk Jeb Bush carries on |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/02/10/punch-drunk-jeb-bush-carries/AFJZk3IF7UwmOsd4jqMfIP/story.html|accessdate= February 25, 2016| work =Boston Globe |date= February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush replied that he did and the Trump campaign immediately posted his comment as part of a video showing mugshots of [[illegal immigrant]]s who committed violent crimes in the US, alternating with footage of Bush saying, "Yeah, they broke the law, but it's not a felony…  It's an act of love."&lt;ref name="RichardsonActofLove"&gt;{{cite news |last =Richardson|first = Bradford |title=Trump rips Bush over 'act of love' remarks on illegal immigration |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/252325-trump-rips-bush-over-act-of-love-remarks-on-illegal|accessdate= February 24, 2016| work = [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date= August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WarrenActofLove"&gt;{{cite news |last =Warren|first =Michael |title= Trump Hits Jeb on 'Act of Love' |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/trump-hits-jeb-on-act-of-love/article/1023012|accessdate= February 24, 2016 | work = The Weekly Standard |date= August 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Eric Fehrnstrom]], political analyst and media strategist, the video marked a crucial turning point in the campaign for the Republican nomination.&lt;ref name="Fehrnstrom" /&gt; Political analyst [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]] regarded the ad as a key moment in Trump's political rise.&lt;ref name="BaroneActofLove"&gt;{{cite news |last =Barone |first =Michael |title=The five key ingredients of Donald Trump's soaraway success |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/donald-trump/12181094/The-five-key-ingredients-of-Donald-Trumps-soaraway-success.html|accessdate= March 23, 2016| work =The Daily Telegraph |date=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' described the ad as pivotal in transforming [[Instagram]] from a personal photo-sharing app that some celebrities and politicians used to enhance their images, into a propaganda tool.&lt;ref name="GarafoliTool"&gt;{{cite news |last = Garafoli|first =Joe |title= Trump and Bush attack ads turn Instagram into a battleground |url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Trump-and-Bush-attack-ads-turn-Instagram-into-a-6486213.php|accessdate= February 24, 2016| work = San Francisco Chronicle |date= September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Right Side Broadcasting Network]]'' frequently uploaded live streams of Donald Trump [[Demonstration (protest)|rallies]] on [[YouTube]].

[[File:Twitter activity of Hillary Clinton.png|thumb|right|Twitter activity of Hillary Clinton from her first tweet in June 2013 to September 2017. Her tweet activity pattern has changed in 2015.]]

In April 2016, [[Correct the Record]], a pro-Clinton [[super PAC]], announced a program called "Barrier Breakers" intended to rival the largely online volunteer efforts of Sanders and Trump supporters. With $1 million in funding, Correct the Record employed paid staff described as "former reporters, bloggers, public affairs specialists, designers" to post "exclusively positive content".&lt;ref name="HampsonOnline"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hampson|first1=Rick|title=Hillary Clinton, no fan of 'Bernie Bros,' could use their energy vs. Trump|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/05/12/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-social-media-supporters/84284322/|accessdate=May 18, 2016|publisher=USA Today|date=May 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Guardian'', Cruz was "skewered by social media memes". His run for the Presidency was ended by a series of memes, including a [[viral video]] of an unusually awkward attempt to shake hands with his running mate [[Carly Fiorina]], which was edited to emphasize his awkwardness in reality. The video was viewed 3.5 million times online. In addition, a mock-[[conspiracy theory]] faux-asserted that [[Ted Cruz–Zodiac meme|Cruz was actually the Zodiac Killer]], an unidentified [[serial killer]] active in [[northern California]] from the late 1960s to the early 1970s.&lt;ref name="AlexanderZodiac" /&gt;

She used the social media platform to communicate with Americans before, during, and after the presidential debate at Hofstra University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jill2016.com/stein_debate_hofstra|title=Jill Stein to Participate Real-Time in First Presidential Debate, Using Social Media to Take Her Case Directly to the American People|newspaper=Jill Stein 2016|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein used her Twitter influence in hopes that it would demonstrate a "changing political landscape" where voters weren't only faced with two options for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=26&amp;sid=d62e2beb-f245-456d-af8d-eebb894fb226@sessionmgr102&amp;hid=108&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=118300128&amp;db=a9h|title=Should You Vote for the Green Party?: Start Your Search!|website=eds.b.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein was trending for the first time on Twitter the week of July 20, 2016 and gained 27,000 new followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jill2016.com/we_broke_internet|title=We broke the internet!|newspaper=Jill Stein 2016|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein also had the same idea as Gary Johnson to sway discouraged Bernie Sanders supporters to vote for her in the election. This led to a boost in online conversation about Stein during the DNC, just as it did with Johnson.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After the end of the election, Stein requested a recount in Wisconsin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=199b5d7f-9172-4b4c-9d83-cd6832ca21c7@sessionmgr4008&amp;hid=4111&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=APbd0ba2fc8b8949dfa79b8eb9ff8e49c0&amp;db=nsm|title=The Latest: Stein files recount request: Start Your Search!|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; She used her social media influence to raise millions of dollars for recounts in not only Wisconsin, but also Pennsylvania and Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=4&amp;sid=199b5d7f-9172-4b4c-9d83-cd6832ca21c7@sessionmgr4008&amp;hid=4111&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=119891029&amp;db=a9h|title=The Week: Start Your Search!|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stein stated that the reason for the recount was to assure that no hacking of voting machines or voter results occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=7&amp;sid=8b656ef2-d47c-4c84-bcd3-14c8d99bb7fa@sessionmgr4007&amp;hid=4111&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmU=#AN=AP2cc0e7b784254e7b842ab1e8a8040e8c&amp;db=nsm|title=Green Party's Stein files recount request in Wisconsin: Start Your Search!|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Black Scholar''''' ('''''TBS'''''), the third-oldest journal of Black culture and political thought in the United States, was founded in 1969 near [[San Francisco, California]], by [[Robert Chrisman]], [[Nathan Hare]], and Allan Ross. It is arguably the most influential journal of [[African-American Studies|Black Studies]] and central to the very emergence of that field. After being renewed and reinvigorated in 2010, it has continued its influence. In 2017, ''The Princeton Review of Academic Journals'' ranked it the number-one journal of Black Studies in the United States. Its associated '''Black Scholar Press''' has published books since the 1970s.&amp;nbsp; The journal is currently housed at [[Boston University]]'s Program in African American Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theblackscholar.org/contact-us/ "Contact Us"], The Black Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''The Black Scholar''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s Editor-in-Chief is the scholar and writer Louis Chude-Sokei, author of works including ''The Last Darky: Bert Williams, Black on Black Minstrelsy and the African Diaspora'' ([[Duke University Press]], 2005) and ''The Sound of Culture: Diaspora and Black Technopoetics'' &amp;nbsp;([[Wesleyan University Press]], 2015).&amp;nbsp; Its Senior Editor is Shireen K. Lewis, author of ''Race, Culture, and Identity: Francophone West African and Caribbean Literature and Theory from Negritude to Creolite'' ([[Lexington Books]], 2001), and founder/director of SisterMentors, a notable non-profit in [[Washington DC]]. Additionally, historian Jonathan Fenderson  serves as Associate Editor, and Shannon Hanks-Mackey is the Managing Editor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theblackscholar.org/board/ "Editorial Board"], The Black Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt; Of all Black journals in the U.S., only the [[NAACP]]’s ''[[The Crisis]]'' (founded in 1910) and the ''[[Journal of African American History]]'' (formerly ''The Journal of Negro History'', founded in 1916) have been publishing for a longer period of time.&lt;sup&gt;[[The Black Scholar#cite note-ChrismanRobert-1|[1]]]&lt;/sup&gt; ''TBS'' is owned by the Robert Chrisman Foundation, a [[Seattle, Washington]]-based non-profit educational organization, and is published quarterly by [[Routledge]]/[[Taylor &amp; Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theblackscholar.org/subscriptions/ "Subscriptions"], The Black Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original editorial board==
[[Robert Chrisman]] (1937–2013) and [[Nathan Hare]] (b. 1933) were active in the 1968 Black and ethnic studies battles at [[San Francisco State University#Controversies|San Francisco State University]]. Hare had been hired to coordinate a Black Studies program, the first in the United States, and to write a proposal for a department of Black studies, which Black students wanted to have as a fully independent department.&lt;ref&gt;[http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=vx&amp;list=H-Afro-Am&amp;month=1303&amp;week=d&amp;msg=Vqa6zsskcSNE8Nh3K2Y0mA "Robert Chrisman Obituary"], H-Net (Humanities &amp; Social Sciences Online).&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence of a five-month student-faculty strike, the first and the longest strike for Black studies in the US academy, Hare, who was arrested twice for activities during the strike, was fired and Chrisman was removed as a professor from tenure track. The strike experience motivated Chrisman and Hare to create a venue outside of the academy for Black knowledge production.&lt;ref name="ChrismanRobert"&gt;Chrisman, Robert. ''The Black Scholar'' 41.4 (Winter 2011): 2-4. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1969, Hare (publisher), Chrisman (editor) and Allan Ross, a white Bay Area printer (as business manager) founded ''The Black Scholar: A Journal of Black Studies and Research'' to cover issues of social, cultural, economic and political thought.&lt;ref name="dispute"/&gt; Its opening issue, "The Culture of Revolution", featured articles by [[Eldridge Cleaver]], [[Amiri Baraka]], [[Ahmed Sékou Touré|Sékou Touré]], and [[Stokely Carmichael]], among others, with Nathan Hare writing the lead article on the First Pan African Cultural Festival Cultural Festival held in Algiers in the summer. There he obtained articles from African intellectuals such as Sékou Touré, as well as Eldridge Clever and his rival, Stokely Carmichael, both of whom had just expatriated to Africa.

Early members of the editorial and advisory board included [[Shirley Chisholm]], [[Amiri Baraka|Imamu Baraka]], [[Angela Davis]], [[Sonia Sanchez]], [[Chuck Stone]], Dempsey Travis, [[Max Roach]], [[John Oliver Killens]], [[Ossie Davis]], [[Shirley Graham Du Bois]], [[Maulana Karenga|Ron Karenga]], and [[Lerone Bennett, Jr.|Lerone Bennett]].&lt;ref name="dispute"&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1975/03/11/78827440.pdf Hunter, Charlayne. “Ideology Dispute Shakes Black Journal”], ''The New York Times,'' March 11, 1975. Web Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert L. Allen]] (b. 1942) joined the journal as Associate Editor in 1974, then rose to Senior Editor (during the shakeup surrounding Nathan Hare's departure and Robert Chrisman's move to the position of Publisher, later Editor and Publisher), while Robert Allen remained Senior Editor until his retirement in 2012.

===Departure of Hare and Ross===
Nathan Hare left ''The Black Scholar'' in 1975 during an ideological dispute. In his open letter of resignation, Hare accused other board members of conspiring to further a Black [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist]] agenda at the expense of competing ideologies. Writing of Hare's resignation, ''[[The New York Times]]'' called ''The Black Scholar'' the most important Black journal since ''The Crisis'' magazine of [[W. E. B. DuBois]]. Allan Ross had left a year or so earlier, but Hare declined his entreaties to leave with him. Robert Allen was brought in to replace Ross on the Board but in the position of Associate Editor, with Ross's assistant (Gloria Bevien) taking his place as Business Manager. Allan Ross died in 1974. Then Hare left in the spring of 1975.

The public split attracted coverage from national newspapers. ''[[The New York Times]]'' covered the story in an article titled "Ideology Dispute Shakes Black Journal",&lt;ref name="HunterCharlayne"&gt;Hunter, Charlayne. “Ideology Dispsute Shakes Black Journal.” ''The New York Times'', March 11, 1975. Web Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; while the ''[[New York Amsterdam News]]'' headline read "Black Reds Take Over Black Scholar!"

==Notable issues==
''The Black Scholar'' published a special issue entitled "The Black Sexism Debate" (Vol. 10, No. 8/9, May/June 1979); this was one of the first public scholarly forums about sexism within the African-American community and it generated controversy due to contradictory positions on gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd, Rudolph P., and Beverly Guy-Sheftall. ''Traps: African American Men on Gender and Sexuality''. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001. 14. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The issue featured responses from feminists, intellectuals, and artists to Robert Staples’ controversial essay, “The Myth of the Black Macho: A Response to Angry Black Feminists,” which had been published in the previous issue of ''TBS.'' Staples had criticized the work of [[Michele Wallace]] and [[Ntozake Shange]]. The editors of the journal viewed the issue as a means of clarifying the relationship between Black men and women while forging solidarities among them.&lt;ref&gt;McGill, Lisa D. ''Constructing Black Selves: Caribbean American Narratives and the Second Generation''. New York University Press, 2005, pp. 119–120. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a decade later, when millions of people were fascinated by [[Clarence Thomas]]’ hearings in the Senate prior to his being confirmed to the Supreme Court, ''TBS'' compiled a special issue. Scholars and historians commented on the issues of sexism and racism in the Clarence Thomas/[[Anita Hill]] controversy (Vol. 22, No. 1/2, Winter 1991–Spring 1992). The essays were later published as ''Court of Appeal: The Black Community Speaks Out on the Racial and Sexual Politics of Thomas vs. Hill'' (1992).&lt;ref name="answers"&gt;Sheri Elaine Metzger and Ralph Zerbonia, [http://www.answers.com/topic/robert-l-allen "Robert L. Allen"], Gale Contemporary Black Biography, at Answers.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, the journal has published a variety of notable special issues, which have begun to participate in the reshaping of Black Studies in the wake of new generations of institutional Black academics as well as in the wake of new political activism and cultural conversation around race, power, knowledge, and politics.&amp;nbsp; Examples include the award-winning issue on Dominican Black Studies (Vol. 45, No. 2, Summer 2015); a roundtable on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television drama ''Scandal'' (Vol. 45, No. 1. Spring 2015); States of Black Studies (Vol. 44, No. 2, Summer 2014); and The Role of Black Philosophy (Vol. 43, No. 4, Winter 2013).&amp;nbsp; Also, there have been cutting edge issues focused on race and environmental justice (Fall 2016); technology such as Black Code (Fall 2017); Black Studies in South Africa (Summer 2017) and Black Experimental Poetics (Spring 2017).

''TBS'' has also focused on debates around sex and sexuality in the Black world, for example, with a wildly popular roundtable on "Race, Pornography and Desire" (Winter 2016) and with upcoming issues on Black Masculinity and the first collection of writings by and about Black Queer and Trans issues and aesthetics (forthcoming in 2019).

The journal has always explored Black American issues through a broader context of Black transnational experiences, and through an explicit global/pan-African lens. In 1977, for example, ''TBS'' published a special issue on Cuba, featuring essays from artists, activists, and intellectuals who had been enabled to visit Cuba through the initiative of the journal’s board.&lt;sup&gt;[[The Black Scholar#cite note-9|[9]]]&lt;/sup&gt; It has also devoted issues to South Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and addresses issues from all points of the Black world.

==Notable contributors==
''The Black Scholar'' was founded on the principle that all Black authors, scholars, and activists could take part in dialogues within its pages. It has been dedicated to finding and developing new talent while also continuing to publish established authors. ''TBS'' has retained its non-discriminatory policy of publishing intellectuals from a variety of professions outside of academia. For example, ''TBS'' has featured articles by US Congress representatives Shirley Chisholm, [[Ron Dellums]], [[Barbara Lee]], and activists such as [[Julian Bond]], [[Herb Boyd]], [[Amílcar Cabral]], [[Eldridge Cleaver]], [[Nawal El Saadawi]], [[Cheddi Jagan]], [[Julius Nyerere]], [[Bobby Seale]], and Kwame Ture ([[Stokely Carmichael]]).&lt;ref name="ChrismanLaura"&gt;Chrisman, Laura, et al. "The Black Scholar Press Release." April 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal has regularly showcased creative writers from across the Black world. [[Opal Palmer Adisa]], [[Margaret Walker|Margaret Walker Alexander]], Amiri Baraka, [[Dennis Brutus]], [[Frank Chipasula|Frank M. Chipasula]], [[Wanda Coleman]], [[Jayne Cortez]], [[René Depestre]], [[Ernest J. Gaines]], [[Nicolás Guillén]], [[June Jordan]], [[Jackie Kay]], [[Yusef Komunyakaa]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Nancy Morejón]], [[Agostinho Neto]], [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]], May Opitz, [[Ishmael Reed]], [[Andrew Salkey]], [[Sonia Sanchez]], [[Ntozake Shange]], [[Wole Soyinka]] and [[Alice Walker]] have been published in issues of ''TBS'' over the years.&lt;ref name="ChrismanLaura"/&gt;

The journal has promoted a wide ideological spectrum of Black scholarly and artistic talent including [[Derrick Bell]], [[Horace Campbell]], [[Clayborne Carson]], [[Elizabeth Catlett]], [[John Henrik Clarke]], Darlene Clark Hine, [[Johnnetta B. Cole]], [[Carolyn Cooper]], [[St. Clair Drake]], [[Katherine Dunham]], [[Emmanuel Chukwudi Eze|E. Chukwudi Eze]], Kevin Gaines, [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates Jr.]], [[Lewis Gordon|Lewis R. Gordon]], [[Farah Jasmine Griffin]], [[Beverly Guy-Sheftall]], [[Patricia Hill Collins]], Joy James, [[E. Patrick Johnson]], [[Peniel Joseph]], Thabiti Asukile, Kara Keeling, [[Robin Kelley|Robin D. G. Kelley]], Treva B. Lindsey, [[Julianne Malveaux]], [[Manning Marable]], [[J. Lorand Matory]], [[Tavia Nyong'o]], [[Adolph L. Reed, Jr.|Adolph Reed]], Christina Sharpe, [[Barbara Smith]], [[Hortense Spillers]], Catherine Squires, [[Chuck Stone]], and [[Ron Walters|Ronald Walters]].

Furthermore, ''TBS'' has been recognized for its timely and significant interviews, such as the now famous dialogues with [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Maya Angelou]], [[Arthur Ashe]], [[James Baldwin]], [[Octavia E. Butler|Octavia Butler]], [[Alex Haley]], [[Darcus Howe]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Jacob Lawrence]], [[Queen Mother Moore|Queen Mother Audley Moore]], [[Hunter Pitts O'Dell|Jack O’Dell]], [[Walter Rodney]], [[McCoy Tyner]], George Yancy, and [[Robert F. Williams]].&lt;ref name="ChrismanLaura"/&gt;

The journal has been home to celebrated essays from activists and academics alike. Angela Davis’s now canonized essay "Reflections on the Black Woman's Role in the Community of Slaves", written while she was in prison, was first published in ''TBS'' in 1971, Vol. 3, No. 4. She was still in prison on murder and kidnapping charges linked to [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]]’s attempted escape from the Marin County Hall of Justice when the article was printed. ''TBS''’ archives at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] also house the last published writing by George Jackson while he was alive (Vol. 2, No. 10, June 1971), printed just two months before his fatal attempt to escape incarceration.&lt;ref name="ChrismanLaura" /&gt;

The journal continues to feature the most influential of contemporary Black scholars, critics and activists, from [[Gerald Early]] to Louis Chude-Sokei, [[Alexis Pauline Gumbs]], Mark Anthony Neal, [[Nathaniel Mackey]], [[Aldon Lynn Nielsen]], Anthony Reed, [[Evie Shockley]], David Marriott, [[Dionne Brand]], Anthony Walton, Stephanie Batiste and so many more.

==Activist involvement==
Activism has always been a founding premise of ''The Black Scholar''. As a result of student and faculty agitation and strikes in the late 1960s, a [[African American Studies|Black Studies]] department was inaugurated at San Francisco State University. Robert Chrisman and Nathan Hare, along with other African-American faculty, were a part of the advisory board created to hire faculty for the new department.&lt;ref&gt;Biondi, Martha. ''The Black Revolution on Campus''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2012. 75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As activists in the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]] and the student movements of the 1960s (for instance, Nathan Hare was a leader of the Black University movement and fired at Howard University before his recruitment to San Francisco State), the founders of ''TBS'' used the journal not only as a publication informed by community activism but also as a hub for further activist work that addresses social inequality based on race, class, and gender in the United States and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Mel. "The Last Word: The Black Scholar." ''New York Times'', May 30, 1971. Web Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of ''TBS''’ contributing and advisory editors have been involved with social and political activism such as organizing a political prisoners' fund, protests against the Vietnam War, trips to Cuba and revolutionary Nicaragua, a trip to the Eastern Bloc in 1985, and a speaker’s bureau to arrange speaking engagements for diverse thinkers of varying disciplines and experiences in and outside traditional academia. Founder Robert Chrisman represented ''TBS'' at a conference held in [[Havana, Cuba]], where a large American delegation met with Angolan leaders Commandante Dibalo, Ogla Lima, and Pedro Zinga Baptista in support of the [[MPLA]]. A few months later Chrisman represented ''TBS'' at the Angola Support Conference, which opposed U.S. and South African intervention in Angola.&lt;ref&gt;[http://keywiki.org/index.php/Robert_Chrisman "Robert Chrisman"] at KeyWiki.&lt;/ref&gt;

The published works produced by ''TBS'' editors have also promoted activism by spreading awareness of racial injustices. As a result of [[Robert L. Allen]]’s publication ''The Port Chicago Mutiny'', which shed light on the unjust and unsafe working conditions that Black Navy servicemen sustained during wartime efforts, social activists were inspired to rectify the injustices of the events. The surviving service members were honored by a group of California State Assemblymen in 1998, more than 50 years after these men were charged with mutiny for refusing to work under unsafe conditions. One of the men involved also received an official pardon by President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name="answers" /&gt;

==Robert Chrisman’s retirement==
On June 30, 2012, founding editor Robert Chrisman officially retired from his long-standing position as Editor-in-Chief and Publisher of ''The Black Scholar''. He publicly announced his retirement in a letter published on the back page of the Spring 2012 issue of ''TBS''. Chrisman claimed that through the creation and the dissemination of such materials ''TBS'' was able to “establish a foundation and platform for late 20th-century Black criticism and scholarship."&lt;ref name="ChrismanRobert_a"&gt;Chrisman, Robert. "An Open Letter from Robert Chrisman." ''The Black Scholar'' 42.1 (Spring 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter, Chrisman made reference to the transitioning direction and goals of the journal in the light of changes in the field of Black Studies and the intellectual interests of scholars and activists within it.&lt;ref name="ChrismanRobert_a" /&gt;

He ended his letter thanking those who provided support throughout his tenure, including his executive assistant Jacki Frommé, typographer Rick Giezentaner, Pat Scott, and Conyus Calhoun. Since retiring, Chrisman completed his third volume of poems, ''The Dirty Wars'', published in summer 2012 by Black Scholar Press, and continued to work on another volume of poetry entitled ''Minotaur'' and to work with [[Robert L. Allen]] on ''The Black Scholar'' archive at UC Berkeley.&lt;ref name="ChrismanRobert_a" /&gt; Chrisman died after a long illness on March 10, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Damu, [http://sfbayview.com/2013/03/robert-chrisman-and-the-black-scholar/ "Robert Chrisman and The Black Scholar"], ''San Francisco BayView'', March 21, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9467">{{redirect|The Golden Axe|other uses|Golden Axe (disambiguation)}}
'''The Honest Woodcutter''', also known as '''Mercury and the Woodman''' and '''The Golden Axe''', is one of [[Aesop's Fables]], numbered 173 in the [[Perry Index]]. It serves as a cautionary tale on the need for cultivating honesty, even at the price of self-interest.

==The story==
The Greek version of the story tells of a woodcutter who accidentally dropped his axe into a river and, because this was his only means of livelihood, sat down and wept. Taking pity on him, the god [[Hermes]] (also known as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]) dived into the water and returned with a golden axe. "Was this what you had lost?", Hermes asked, but the woodcutter said it was not, and returned the same answer when a silver axe was brought to the surface. Only when his own tool is produced does he claim it. Impressed by his honesty, the god allows him to keep all three. Hearing of the man's good fortune, an envious neighbor threw his own axe into the river and wailed for its return. When Hermes appeared and offered him a golden axe, the man greedily claimed it but was denied both that and the return of his own axe.

Though the tale's moral is that 'Honesty is the best policy', as the English proverb has it, there existed a medieval Byzantine proverb apparently alluding to the fable, which stated that 'A river does not always bring axes'. But since this was glossed to mean that no person always acts consistently, it is obviously at a considerable remove from the story's application.&lt;ref name="Hansen2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. Hansen|title=Ariadne's Thread: A Guide to International Tales Found in Classical Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ezDlXl7gP9oC&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=2013-04-14|year=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-3670-2|page=44|chapter=Hermes and the Woodcutter}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of ideas that led to this understanding of the fable also exposes the gap in the envious neighbor's logic. He had observed the [[proximate and ultimate causation|proximate cause]] for enrichment, namely dropping an axe in the river, and overlooked the ultimate cause - the need for scrupulous honesty. The right combination of circumstances had to be there for Hermes to act as he did. Without them, as the neighbor eventually learned, 'the river does not always bring (golden) axes'. 

A burlesque retelling of the fable occurs in [[François Rabelais]]'s 16th-century novel ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]''. It takes up most of the author's prologue to the 4th Book and is considerably extended in his typically prolix and circuitous style. The woodcutter's cries disturb the chief of the gods as he deliberates the world's business and he sends Mercury down with instructions to test the man with the three axes and cut off his head if he chooses wrongly. Although he survives the test and returns a rich man, the entire countryside decides to follow his example and gets decapitated. So, Rabelais concludes, it is better to be moderate in our desires. Much the same story is told in [[La Fontaine's Fables]] (V.1) but in more concentrated form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readbookonline.net/readOnLine/19785 |title=An English version |publisher=Readbookonline.net |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rather than beheading the woodman's imitators, Mercury merely administers a heavy blow.

==The fable in the arts==
Some paintings named from the fable have been broad landscapes with small figures added in the middle plane. [[Salvator Rosa]]'s ''Mercury and the Dishonest Woodman'' in the [[National Gallery]], London, dates from about 1650.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/salvator-rosa-landscape-with-mercury-and-the-dishonest-woodman |title=Salvator Rosa &amp;#124; Landscape with Mercury and the Dishonest Woodman &amp;#124; NG84 &amp;#124; The National Gallery, London |publisher=Nationalgallery.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 18th-century watercolour by George Robertson (1748–88) seems to derive from this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icollector.com/George-Robertson-1748-1788-watercolour-Mercury-and-The-Woodman-9-5-x-15-5-ins_i5078639 |title=George Robertson (1748-1788) watercolour, Mercury and The Woodman, 9.5 x 15.5 ins |publisher=Icollector.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles-André van Loo]] gives greater prominence to the figures in his ''Mercure présentant des haches au bûcheron'' in the [[Hôtel de Soubise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insecula.com/oeuvre/photo_ME0000063203.html |title=Mercure présentant des haches au bûcheron |publisher=Insecula.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025055023/http://www.insecula.com/oeuvre/photo_ME0000063203.html |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this the god hovers in mid-air and presents the axes to the surprised and kneeling woodman. 

Illustrations of the fable on English chinaware draw on the woodcut in [[Samuel Croxall]]'s edition of Aesop. A Wedgwood plate of about 1775 displays a red picture in a square, garlanded frame. The rim has a wavy edge printed with detached sprays of flowers. Much the same picture as there, printed in green, is used on a contemporary Liverpool tile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/search/?listing_type=&amp;offset=0&amp;limit=15&amp;narrow=&amp;q=mercury+and+the+woodman&amp;commit=Search&amp;quality=0&amp;objectnamesearch=&amp;placesearch=&amp;after=&amp;after-adbc=AD&amp;before=&amp;before-adbc=AD&amp;namesearch=&amp;materialsearch=&amp;mnsearch=&amp;locationsearch= |title=Both are on display in the Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Collections.vam.ac.uk |date=2013-04-02 |accessdate=2013-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the left foreground, Mercury is presenting an axe to the seated woodman. In the distance, on the opposite bank, his dishonest neighbour has raised his axe before throwing it into the river. 

In 1987 the story was included on the 40 drachma value of the eight-stamp set of Aesop's fables issued by Greece and features the naked god seated on a rock in the river and offering the three axes to the bearded woodman on the bank.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.creighton.edu/aesop/artifacts/stamps/greece Creighton University]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==

The Thai account claims to originate from a Buddhist [[Jataka]] tale but gives no source for a comparison to be made. Since the main lines of the story in all three are the same as in Aesopic versions, one might infer that, whatever their original form, they have since been influenced by the European model. 

A certain kinship has also been observed between the fable and the account of the miraculous recovery of an axe from a river in the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]]. There the prophet [[Elisha]] was travelling with some members of a religious community 'and when they came to the Jordan, they began cutting down trees; but it chanced that as one man was felling a trunk, the head of his axe flew off into the water. "Oh master," he exclaimed, "it was a borrowed one." "Where did it fall?" asked the man of God. When he was shown the place, he cut off a piece of wood and threw it in and made the iron float.' (NEB, Kings II, 6.4-6)

[[File:TheJoyOfYiddish.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[McGraw-Hill]])]]

'''''The Joys of Yiddish''''' is a book containing a [[lexicon]] of common words and phrases of [[Yinglish]]—i.e., words originating in the [[Yiddish]] language that had become known to speakers of [[American English]] due to the influence of [[Jewish American|American Ashkenazi Jews]].  It was originally published in 1968 and written by [[Leo Rosten]].

The book distinguished itself by how it explained the meaning of the Yiddish words and phrases: almost every entry was illustrated by a joke.  This made the book not only a useful reference, but also a treasured collection of [[Jewish humor]].

As is inevitable with any book that references popular culture, it quickly became dated due to the dramatic changes that American culture (and Jewish-American culture) underwent over the next 30 years.  Rosten published revised versions of the book with different titles:  ''Hooray for Yiddish!'' (1982) and ''The Joys of Yinglish'' (1989).  In 2001, a new edition of the original book was published.  Titled ''The New Joys of Yiddish'', it was  revised by [[Lawrence Bush]], with copious footnotes added to clarify passages that had become outdated.  Some material was also rearranged.

==References in popular culture==

In 1998, [[Charles Schumer]] and [[Al D'Amato]] were running for the position of [[United States Senator]] representing [[New York (state)|New York]].  During the race, D'Amato referred to Schumer as a ''putzhead''.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' referenced the entry for ''putz'' in ''The Joy of Yiddish'' and maintained that the phrase did not merely mean "fool", as D'Amato insisted, but was significantly more pejorative: based on that entry, a better translation might be "dickhead". D'Amato ended up losing the race; some observers credit this incident with costing him the election.

[[Harlan Ellison]]'s 1974 [[science fiction]] story "I'm Looking for Kadak" (collected in Ellison's 1976 book ''Approaching Oblivion'' and in ''Wandering Stars:  An Anthology of Jewish Fantasy and Science Fiction'') is narrated by an eleven-armed Jewish alien from the planet Zsouchmuhn with an extensive Yiddish vocabulary. Ellison courteously provides a "Grammatical Guide and Glossary for the [[Goyim]]" in which, he says, "The Yiddish words are mine ... but some of the definitions have been adapted and based on those in Leo Rosten's marvelous and utterly indispensable sourcebook ''The Joys of Yiddish'' ... which I urge you to rush out and buy, simply as good reading."

[[Dave McKean]] and [[Neil Gaiman]]'s 2005 fantasy film ''[[MirrorMask]]'' includes Rosten's classic riddle, discussed in ''The Joys of Yiddish'' as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first riddle I ever heard, one familiar to almost every Jewish child, was propounded to me by my father:

"What is it that hangs on the wall, is green, wet -- and whistles?"
I knit my brow and thought and thought, and in final perplexity gave up.
"A herring," said my father.
"A herring," I echoed. "A herring doesn't hang on the wall!"
"So hang it there."
"But a herring isn't green!" I protested.
"Paint it."
"But a herring isn't wet."
"If it's just painted it's still wet."
"But -- " I sputtered, summoning all my outrage, "-- a herring doesn't whistle!!"
"Right, " smiled my father. "I just put that in to make it hard."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John Updike]]'s final novel in the Rabbit series, ''[[Rabbit at Rest]]'', copies Rosten's joke from the entry on ''tsuris''.

[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Bernhard Christoph Francke.jpg|thumb|[[Gottfried Leibniz]] coined the term "theodicy" in an attempt to justify God's existence in light of the apparent imperfections of the world.]]
{{God|related}}
{{Philosophy of religion sidebar|challenges}}

'''Theodicy''' ({{IPAc-en|θ|iː|ˈ|ɒ|d|ɪ|s|i}}), in its most common form, is an attempt to answer the question of why a good [[God]] permits the manifestation of [[evil]], thus resolving the issue of the [[problem of evil]]. Some theodicies also address the [[evidential problem of evil]] by attempting "to make the existence of an [[omniscience|all-knowing]], [[omnipotence|all-powerful]] and [[omnibenevolence|all-good or omnibenevolent]] God consistent with the existence of evil or suffering in the world."&lt;ref&gt;Philip A. Pecorino, ''An Introduction to Philosophy: An Online Textbook'' (2000), Chapter 3: ‘Philosophy of Religion’, Section 11: Problem of Evil, online at http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/SocialSciences/ppecorino/INTRO_TEXT/Chapter%203%20Religion/Problem_of_Evil.htm. Retrieved September 26, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike a defense, which tries to demonstrate that [[existence of God|God's existence]] is logically possible in the light of evil, a theodicy attempts to provide a framework wherein God's existence is also plausible.&lt;ref&gt;A defence is “an effort to show that there is no formal contradiction between the existence of God... and the existence of evil.” Michael Rea and Louis B. Pojman, eds., ''Philosophy of Religion: An Anthology'' (Cengage Learning, 2015, 7th ed.), 229.&lt;/ref&gt; The German mathematician and philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] coined the term "theodicy" in 1710 in his work ''[[Théodicée]]'', though various responses to the problem of evil had been previously proposed. The British philosopher [[John Hick]] traced the history of moral theodicy in his 1966 work, ''Evil and the God of Love'', identifying three major traditions:
# the Plotinian theodicy, named after [[Plotinus]]
# the [[Augustinian theodicy]], which Hick based on the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]]
# the [[Irenaean theodicy]], which Hick developed, based on the thinking of St. [[Irenaeus]]

The problem was also analyzed by pre-modern theologians and philosophers in the Islamic world. German philosopher [[Max Weber]] (1864–1920) saw theodicy as a social problem, based on the human need to explain puzzling aspects of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Swedberg, Ola Agevall, ''The Max Weber Dictionary: Key Words and Central Concepts'' (Stanford University Press, 2005), 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Sociologist [[Peter L. Berger]] (1929–2017) argued that religion arose out of a need for social order, and an “implicit theodicy of all social order” developed to sustain it.&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Berger, ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion'' (Doubleday, 1st ed, 1967), 55.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[Holocaust]], a number of [[Jewish theology|Jewish theologians]] developed a new response to the problem of evil, sometimes called anti-theodicy, which maintains that God cannot be meaningfully justified. As an alternative to theodicy, a defense has been proposed by the American philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]], which is focused on showing the logical possibility of God's existence. Plantinga's [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|version of the free-will defence]] argued that the coexistence of God and evil is not logically impossible, and that free will further explains the existence of evil without threatening the existence of God.{{Citation needed lead|date=October 2016}}

Similar to a theodicy, a [[#Cosmodicy and anthropodicy|cosmodicy]] attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of the universe, and an anthropodicy attempts to justify the goodness of humanity.

==Definition and etymology==
As defined by Alvin Plantinga, theodicy is the "answer to the question of why God permits evil".&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, Alvin (1974). ''God, Freedom, and Evil'', William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Theodicy is defined as a theological construct that attempts to vindicate God in response to the [[evidential problem of evil]] that mitigates against the existence of an [[omnipotent]] and [[omnibenevolent]] deity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefreedictionary.com/theodicy and {{cite book|title=The Bible on Suffering|year=2002|publisher=Paulist Press|location=New York|isbn=0809140489|editor=Anthony J. Tambasco|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition of theodicy is the vindication of divine goodness and providence in view of the existence of evil. The word ''theodicy'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words Θεός ''Τheos'' and δίκη ''dikē''. ''Theos'' is translated "God" and ''dikē'' can be translated as either "trial" or "judgement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=di/kh "δίκη"]. ''[[A Greek–English Lexicon]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, theodicy literally means "justifying God".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', s. v. [http://0-www.britannica.com.librarycatalog.vts.edu/EBchecked/topic/590596/theodicy "theodicy"], accessed October 20, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', [[Nick Trakakis]] proposed an additional three requirements which must be contained within a theodicy:
* Common sense views of the world
* Widely held historical and scientific opinion
* Plausible moral principles&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-evi/#H4 |title=The Evidential Problem of Evil |publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=March 31, 2005 |accessdate=January 16, 2012 |author=Trakakis, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to the problem of evil, a theodicy is distinct from a defence. A defence attempts to demonstrate that the occurrence of evil does not contradict God's existence, but it does not propose that rational beings are able to understand why God permits evil. A theodicy seeks to show that it is reasonable to believe in God despite evidence of evil in the world and offers a framework which can account for why evil exists.&lt;ref&gt;Bunnin &amp; Tsui-James 2002, p. 481&lt;/ref&gt; A theodicy is often based on a prior [[natural theology]], which attempts to prove the existence of God, and seeks to demonstrate that God's existence remains probable after the problem of evil is posed by giving a justification for God's permitting evil to happen.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; Defenses propose solutions to the [[logical problem of evil]], while theodicies attempt to answer the evidential (inductive) problem.&lt;ref name=IEP/&gt;

Hurricanes and toothaches are examples of natural evils. By contrast, moral evils do result from the intentions or negligence of moral agents. Murder and lying are examples of moral evils.

[[Pseudo-Dionysus]] defines evil by those aspects that show an absence of good.&lt;ref name="N.T.Wright"/&gt;{{rp|37}}  Writers in this tradition saw things as belonging to 'forms' and evil as an absence of being a good example of their form: as a deficit of goodness where goodness ought to have been present. In this same line of thinking, [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] also defined evil as an absence of good, as did theologian and monk [[Thomas Aquinas]] who said: "... a man is called ''bad'' insofar as he lacks a virtue, and an eye is called ''bad'' insofar as it lacks the power of sight."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|37}} ''Bad'' as an absence of ''good'' resurfaces in [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] and [[Karl Barth|Barth]].

[[Immanuel Kant]] was the first to offer a purely secular theory of evil, giving an evaluative definition of evil based on its cause as having a will that is not fully good.

==Reasons for theodicy==
German philosopher [[Max Weber]] interpreted theodicy as a social problem,&lt;ref&gt;Swedberg 2005, pp. 273–74&lt;/ref&gt; and viewed theodicy as a "problem of meaning". Weber argued that, as human society became increasingly [[rationality|rational]], the need to explain why good people suffered and evil people prospered became more important because religion casts the world as a "meaningful cosmos". Weber framed the problem of evil as the dilemma that the good can suffer and the evil can prosper, which became more important as religion became more sophisticated.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2009, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He identified two purposes of theodicy: to explain why good people suffer (a theodicy of suffering), and why people prosper (a theodicy of good fortune). A theodicy of good fortune seeks to justify the good fortune of people in society; Weber believed that those who are successful are not satisfied unless they can justify why they deserve to be successful.&lt;ref&gt;Swedberg 2005, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; For theodicies of suffering, Weber argued that three different kinds of theodicy emerged—[[predestination]], [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], and [[karma]]—all of which attempt to satisfy the human need for meaning, and he believed that the quest for meaning, when considered in light of suffering, becomes the problem of suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2009, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Peter L. Berger]] characterised religion as the human attempt to build order out of a chaotic world. He believed that humans could not accept that anything in the world was meaningless and saw theodicy as an assertion that the cosmos has meaning and order, despite evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Scott 2009, pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; Berger presented an argument similar to that of Weber, but suggested that the need for theodicy arose primarily out of the situation of human society. He believed that theodicies existed to allow individuals to transcend themselves, denying the individual in favour of the social order.&lt;ref&gt;Woodhead 2001, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Richard Swinburne says "most theists need a theodicy, [they need] an account of reasons why God might allow evil to occur. Without a theodicy evil counts against the existence of God."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|2}}

==History==
The term ''theodicy'' was coined by German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in his 1710 work, written in [[French language|French]], ''[[Essais de Théodicée sur la bonté de Dieu, la liberté de l'homme et l'origine du mal]]'' (''Theodicy: Essays on the Goodness of God, the Freedom of Man and the Origin of Evil'').&lt;ref&gt;Leibniz 1734&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz's ''Théodicée'' was a response to [[skepticism|skeptical]] Protestant philosopher [[Pierre Bayle]], who wrote in his work ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'' that, after rejecting three attempts to solve it, he saw no rational solution to the problem of evil. Bayle argued that, because the [[Bible]] asserts the coexistence of God and evil, this state of affairs must simply be accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayle/ | title=Pierre Bayle | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=7 February 2003 | accessdate=January 22, 2012 | author=Lennon, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Voltaire]] criticised Leibniz's concept of theodicy in his ''[[Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne]]'' (''Poem on the Lisbon disaster''), suggesting that the massive destruction of innocent lives caused by the [[Lisbon earthquake]] demonstrated that God was not providing the "best of all possible worlds".&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire, [[Candide]] and ''Poème sur le désastre de Lisbonne''&lt;/ref&gt; Voltaire also includes the earthquake/theodicy theme in his novel ''Candide''.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1992), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' (1914), Constantine Kempf argued that, following Leibniz's work, philosophers called their works on the problem of evil "theodicies", and philosophy about God was brought under the discipline of theodicy. He argued that theodicy began to include all of [[natural theology]], meaning that theodicy came to consist of the human knowledge of God through the systematic use of reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14569a.htm | title=Theodicy | publisher=The Catholic Encyclopedia | year=2012 | accessdate=September 4, 2012 | author=Kempf, Constantine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, British philosopher [[John Hick]] published ''Evil and the God of Love'', in which he surveyed various Christian responses to the problem of evil, before developing his own.&lt;ref&gt;Cheetham 2003, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Hick identified and distinguished between three types of theodicy: Plotinian, which was named after Plotinus, [[Augustinian theodicy|Augustinian]], which had dominated [[Western Christianity]] for many centuries, and [[Irenaean theodicy|Irenaean]], which was developed by the Eastern [[Church Father]] [[Irenaeus]], a version of which Hick subscribed to himself.&lt;ref&gt;Hall 2003, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

In his dialogue "Is God a Taoist?",&lt;ref&gt;Smullyan 1977, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1977 in his book ''[[The Tao is Silent]]'', [[Raymond Smullyan]] claims to prove that it is logically impossible to have sentient beings without allowing "evil", even for God, just as it is impossible for him to create a triangle in the Euclidean plane having an angular sum other than 180°. So the capability of feeling implies free will, which in turn may produce "evil", understood here as hurting other sentient beings. The problem of evil happening to good or innocent people is not addressed directly here, but both reincarnation and karma are hinted at.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Ancient religions===
“Writings and discourses on theodicy by Jews, Greeks, Christians, and Eastern religions have graced our planet for thousands of years.”&lt;ref&gt;Birnbaum, David (1989). ''God and Evil''. Hoboken: Ktav Pub. House. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] (2000 BC to 1700 BC) as “in Ancient Mesopotamian and Israelite literature,” theodicy was an important issue.&lt;ref&gt;Assman, Jan (2001). ''The Search for God in Ancient Egypt'' trans. David Lorton. Cornell University Press. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr Philip Irving Mitchell of the [[Dallas Baptist University]] notes that some philosophers have cast the pursuit of theodicy as a modern one, as earlier scholars used the problem of evil to support the existence of one particular god over another, explain wisdom, or explain a conversion, rather than to justify God's goodness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www3.dbu.edu/mitchell/theodicy.htm | title=Theodicy: An Overview | publisher=Dallas Baptist University | accessdate=July 17, 2012 | author=Mitchell, Dr Philip Irving}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor [[Sarah Iles Johnston]] argues that ancient civilizations, such as the ancient [[Ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamians]], [[ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] held [[polytheistic]] beliefs that may have enabled them to deal with the concept of theodicy differently. These religions taught the existence of many [[deity|gods]] and [[goddess]]es who controlled various aspects of daily life. These early religions may have avoided the question of theodicy by endowing their deities with the same flaws and jealousies that plagued [[human]]ity. No one god or goddess was fundamentally good or evil; this explained that bad things could happen to good people if they angered a deity because the gods could exercise the same free will that humankind possesses. Such religions taught that some gods were more inclined to be helpful and benevolent, while others were more likely to be spiteful and aggressive. In this sense, the evil gods could be blamed for misfortune, while the good gods could be petitioned with prayer and sacrifices to make things right. There was still a sense of justice in that individuals who were right with the gods could avoid punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston 2004, pp. 531–47&lt;/ref&gt;

The "[[Epicurean trilemma]]" however was already raised ~300BC by [[Epicurus]]. It is the first credited to describe the problem of reconciling an omnipotent deity with their benevolence and the existence of evil.

====Biblical theodicy====
{{Main article|Theodicy and the Bible}}
The biblical account of the justification of evil and suffering in the presence of God has both similarities and contrasts in the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. For the Hebrew Bible, the [[Book of Job]] is often quoted as the authoritative source of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;''The Old Testament''. Modern Library Edition, Introduction, authored by George Steiner.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The author of Job seeks to expand the understanding of divine justice ...beyond mere retribution, to include a system of divine sovereignty [showing] the King has the right to test His subject's loyalty...  The book of Job corrects the rigid and overly simplistic doctrine of retribution in attributing suffering to sin and punishment. It closes with a focus on the bond between creator and creation, on placing one's trust in that, and on hope rooted in belief that God is in ultimate control."&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ko|first1=Grace|title=Theodicy in Habakkuk|date=2014|publisher=Paternoster|location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Job}}

It is generally accepted that God's responsive speeches in Job do not directly answer Job's complaints; God does not explain Himself or reveal the reason for Job's suffering to him; instead Yahweh's speeches focus on increasing Job's overall understanding of his relationship with God. This exemplifies Biblical theodicy.&lt;ref&gt;Pathways in Theodicy: An Introduction to the Problem of Evil By Mark S. M. Scott&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21,28}}  There is general agreement among Bible scholars that the Bible "does not admit of a singular perspective on evil. ...Instead we encounter a variety of perspectives...  Consequently [the Bible focuses on] moral and spiritual remedies, not rational or logical [justifications].  ...It is simply that the Bible operates within a cosmic, moral and spiritual landscape rather than within a rationalist, abstract, ontological landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Pathways in Theodicy: An Introduction to the Problem of Evil, By Mark S. M. Scott&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mark S. M. Scott"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=Mark S. M.|title=Pathways in Theodicy: An Introduction to the Problem of Evil|date=2015|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-1-4514-6470-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}}   

This is in evidence in Yahweh's first and second speech in Job. Yahweh's first speech concerns human ignorance and God's authority. Job had seen himself at the center of events, lamenting that God has singled him out to oppress; God responds that Job is not the center, Yahweh is; His kingdom is complex, He governs on a large scale, and has the right to exercise divine authority; since God is the rightful owner of everything in the universe, Job cannot justly accuse Him of wrongful deprivation.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Job}}  Yahweh's second speech is against human self-righteousness. Job has vehemently accused God of thwarting justice as "the omnipotent tyrant, the cosmic thug". Some scholars interpret Yahweh's response as an admission of failure on His part, but He goes on to say He has the power and in His own timing will bring justice in the end.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Job}}

"Isaiah is generally recognized as one of the most progressive books of the prophetic corpus."&lt;ref name="Tod Linafelt"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Linafelt|editor1-first=Tod|title=Strange Fire: Reading the Bible After the Holocaust|date=2000|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=0-8147-5165-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208}}  Hebrew Bible scholar [[Marvin A. Sweeney]] says "...a unified reading of [Isaiah] places the question of theodicy at the forefront... [with] three major dimensions of the question...: Yahweh's identification with the conqueror, Yahweh's decree of judgment against Israel without possibility of repentance, and the failure of Yahweh's program to be realized by the end of the book."&lt;ref name="Tod Linafelt"/&gt;{{rp|209}}  Christian theologians read some passages in Isaiah differently.   "In either case, suffering is understood as having transcendent meaning... human agency can give particular instances of suffering a mystical significance that transforms it into something productive."&lt;ref name="Sarah K. Pinnock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinnock|first1=Sarah K.|title=Beyond Theodicy: Jewish and Christian Continental Thinkers Respond to the Holocaust|date=2002|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=New York|isbn=0-7914-5523-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodicy in the book of Ezekiel (and also in Jeremiah 31:29-30) confronts the concept of personal moral responsibility. "The main point is stated at the beginning and at the end--"the soul that sins shall die"--and is explicated by a case history of a family traced through three generations." It is not about heredity but is about understanding divine justice in a world under divine governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blenkinsopp|first1=Joseph|title=Ezekiel|date=1990|publisher=John Knox Press|location=Louisville|isbn=0-8042-3118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|82}}  

"Theodicy in the Minor Prophets differs little from that in Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel."&lt;ref name="Paul L. Redditt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Redditt|first1=Paul L|title=Thematic Threads in the Book of the Twelve|date=2003|publisher=Walter De Gruyter|location=New York|isbn=3-11-017594-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the first chapter of Habakuk raises questions about Yahweh's justice, laments God's inaction in punishing injustice, and looks for God's action in response--then objects to what God chooses.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 1}} Instead of engaging in debate, God gives Habakuk a vision of the future which includes five oracles that form a theodicy: (1) God has a plan and has appointed a time for judgment.  It may be slow in coming as humans see things, but it will come. (2) The woe oracles confront the prevalence of evil in the world and the justice those acts have earned (3) The vision of the manifestation of God is a recognition of God's power to address these issues  (4) God as a warrior will fight for his people  (5) The song of triumph says the faithful will prevail by holding to trust and hope.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Intro, Chapter 3}}  Joel and the other minor prophets demonstrate that theodicy and eschatology are connected in the Bible.&lt;ref name="Paul L. Redditt"/&gt;{{rp|201}}

Psalm 73 presents the internal struggle created by personal suffering and the prosperity of the wicked.  The writer gains perspective when he "enters the sanctuary of God (16-17)" seeing that God's justice will eventually prevail.  He reaffirms his relationship with Yahweh, is ashamed of his resentment, and chooses trust. &lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Psalm 73}}  Psalm 77 contains real outspokenness to God as well as determination to hold onto faith and trust.&lt;ref name="Grace Ko"/&gt;{{rp|Chapter 3:Psalm 77}} 

For the Christian, the Scriptures assure him or her that the allowance of evil is for a good purpose based on relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Frame and Joseph E. Torres, Apologetics: A Justification of Christian Belief (Phillipsburg, NJ: P&amp;R Publishing, 2015), 184.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Some of the good ... cannot be achieved without delay and suffering, and the evil of this world is indeed necessary for the achievement of those good purposes. ... God has the right to allow such evils to occur, so long as the 'goods' are facilitated and the 'evils' are limited and compensated in the way that various other Christian doctrines (of human freewill, life after death, the end of the world, etc.) affirm. ...the 'good states' which (according to Christian doctrine) God seeks are so good that they outweigh the accompanying evils."&lt;ref name="Richard Swinburne"/&gt;{{rp|Intro.,51}} 

This is somewhat illustrated in the [[Book of Exodus]] when Pharaoh is described as being raised up that God's name be known in all the earth Exodus 9:16. This is mirrored in Romans' ninth chapter, where Paul appeals to God's sovereignty as sufficient explanation, with God's goodness experientially known to the Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Apologetics, Frame 178–79.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Augustinian theodicy===
{{Main article|Augustinian theodicy}}
The [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Calvinism|Reformed]] reading of [[Augustinian theodicy]], as promoted primarily by [[John Hick]], is based on the writings of [[Augustine of Hippo]], a [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]] and theologian who lived from AD 354 to 430.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/augustine/#OntEud | title=Saint Augustine |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=24 March 2000; substantive revision 12 November 2010 | accessdate=9 October 2011 | author=Mendelson, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic (pre-reformation) formulation of the same issue is substantially different and is outlined below. In Hick's approach, this form of theodicy argues that evil does not exist except as a [[privation]]—or corruption—of goodness, and therefore God did not create evil.&lt;ref&gt;Menn 2002, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; Augustinian scholars have argued that God created the world perfectly, with no evil or human suffering. Evil entered the world through the disobedience of [[Adam and Eve]] and the theodicy casts the existence of evil as a just punishment for this [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;Corey 2000, pp. 177–78&lt;/ref&gt; The theodicy argues that humans have an evil nature in as much as it is deprived of its original goodness, form, order, and measure due to the inherited original sin of [[Adam]] and [[Eve]], but still ultimately remains good due to existence coming from God, for if a nature was completely evil (deprived of the good), it would cease to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Green 2011, p. 779&lt;/ref&gt; It maintains that God remains blameless and good.&lt;ref&gt;Geivett 1995, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Catholic theology|Roman Catholic]] reading of [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], the issue of [[just war]] as developed in his book [[City of God (book)|''The City of God'']] substantially established his position concerning the positive justification of killing, suffering and pain as inflicted upon an enemy when encountered in war for a just cause.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/septemberweb-only/9-17-55.0.html A Time For War?] Christianity Today (2001-01-09).

Defense of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority. While not elaborating the conditions necessary for war to be just, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] nonetheless originated the very phrase, itself, in his work ''[[The City of God (book)|The City of God]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html Augustine of Hippo] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120728203512/http://www.crusades-encyclopedia.com/augustineofhippo.html |date=2012-07-28 }}.

===Irenaean theodicy===
{{Main article|Irenaean theodicy}}

[[Irenaeus]] (died c. 202), born in the early second century, expressed ideas which explained the existence of evil as necessary for human development. Irenaeus argued that human creation comprised two parts: humans were made first in the image, then in the likeness, of God. The image of God consists of having the potential to achieve moral perfection, whereas the likeness of God is the achievement of that perfection. To achieve moral perfection, Irenaeus suggested that humans must have free will. To achieve such free will, humans must experience suffering and God must be at an [[epistemology|epistemic distance]] (a distance of knowledge) from humanity. Therefore, evil exists to allow humans to develop as moral agents.&lt;ref name="Encountering evil"&gt;
Davis 2001, pp. 40-42&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, [[John Hick]] collated the ideas of Irenaeus into a distinct theodicy. He argued that the world exists as a "vale of soul-making" (a phrase that he drew from [[John Keats]]), and that suffering and evil must therefore occur. He argued that human goodness develops through the experience of evil and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Stump 1999, pp. 222–27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origenian theodicy===
In direct response to John Hick's description of theodicy, Mark Scott has indicated that neither [[Augustine of Hippo]] nor [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyons]] provide an appropriate context for the discussion of Hick's theistic version of theodicy. As a theologian among the [[Church Fathers]] who articulated a theory of ''[[apokatastasis]]'' (or [[universal reconciliation]]), [[Origen|Origen of Alexandria]] provides a more direct theological comparison for the discussion of Hick's presentation of universal salvation and theodicy. Neither Irenaeus nor Augustine endorsed a theology of universal salvation in any form comparable to that of John Hick.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Mark (2012).

===Relatively minor theodicies===
[[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]] summarizes what he calls “relatively minor” theodicies.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Martin, ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'' (Temple University Press, 1992), 436–54.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The Finite God Theodicy maintains that God is all-good ([[omnibenevolent]]) but not all-powerful ([[omnipotent]]).
:* The [[Best of all possible worlds|Best of all Possible Worlds]] Theodicy, a traditional theology, argues that the creation is the best of all possible worlds.
:* The [[Original Sin]] Theodicy holds that evil came into the world because of humanity's original sin.
:* The Ultimate Harmony Theodicy justifies evil as leading to “good long-range consequences”.
:* The Degree of Desirability of a Conscious State Theodicy has been reckoned a “complex theodicy.”&lt;ref&gt;Ramblings of a Thomist, Blog of March 27, 2008 http://thomisticramblings.blogspot.com/2008/03/minor-theodicies-and.html. Accessed September 25, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that a person’s state is deemed evil only when it is undesirable to the person. However, because God is unable to make a person’s state desirable to the person, the theodic problem does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Martin, ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'' (Temple University Press, 1992), 444–45. Martin finds this theodicy in George Schlesinger, ''Religion and Scientific Method'' (Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012) and judges it unsatisfactory.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The [[Reincarnation]] Theodicy believes that people suffer evil because of their wrong-doing in a previous life.
:* The Contrast Theodicy holds that evil is needed to enable people to appreciate or understand good.
:* The Warning Theodicy rationalizes evil as God’s warning to people to mend their ways.

=== Islamic world ===

[[Mu'tazila]] theologians approached the problem of theodicy within a framework of [[moral realism]], according to which the moral value of acts is accessible to unaided reason, so that humans can make moral judgments about divine acts.&lt;ref name=shihadeh&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Ayman Shihadeh|title=Suffering|editor=Josef W. Meri|encyclopedia=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|page=772|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LaV-IGZ8VKIC&amp;pg=PA772}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argued that the divine act of creation is good despite existence of suffering, because it allows humans a compensation of greater reward in the afterlife.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; They posited that individuals have free will to commit evil and absolved God of responsibility for such acts.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; God's justice thus consists of punishing wrongdoers.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; Following the demise of Mu'tazila as a school, their theodicy was adopted in the [[Zaydi]] and [[Twelver]] branches of [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt;

Most Sunni theologians analyzed theodicy from an anti-realist [[Meta-ethics|metaethical]] standpoint.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; [[Ash'ari]] theologians argued that ordinary moral judgments stem from emotion and social convention, which are inadequate to either condemn or justify divine actions.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; Ash'arites hold that God creates everything, including human actions, but distinguish creation (''khalq'') from acquisition (''kasb'') of actions.&lt;ref name=roy&gt;{{cite book|title=What is Islamic Philosophy?|author=Roy Jackson|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5XPMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; They allow individuals the latter ability, though they do not posit existence of free will in a fuller sense of the term. In the words of [[Al-Shahrastani]] (1086–1153):&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;

{{quote|God creates, in man, the power, ability, choice, and will to perform an act, and man, endowed with this derived power, chooses freely one of the alternatives and intends or wills to do the action, and, corresponding to this intention, God creates and completes the action.}}

[[Ash'ari]] theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, also insists on ultimate divine transcendence and teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what has been revealed through the prophets, so that on the question of God's creation of evil, revelation has to accepted ''bila kayfa'' (without [asking] how).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Tamara Sonn|title=Tawḥīd|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001/acref-9780195305135-e-0788?rskey=y8ZWqZ|subscription=yes|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roy/&gt;

[[Ibn Sina]], the most influential Muslim philosopher, analyzed theodicy from a purely ontological, [[neoplatonic]] standpoint, aiming to prove that God, as the absolutely good First Cause, created a good world.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; Ibn Sina argued that evil refers either to a cause of an entity (such as burning in a fire), being a quality of another entity, or to its imperfection (such as blindness), in which case it does not exist as an entity. According to Ibn Sina, such qualities are necessary attributes of the best possible order of things, so that the good they serve is greater than the harm they cause.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt;

Philosophical Sufi theologians such as [[Ibn Arabi]] were influenced by the neoplatonic theodicy of [[Ibn Sina]].&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] anticipated the optimistic theodicy of Leibniz in his dictum "There is nothing in possibility more wonderful than what is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Religious Diversity, Evil, and a Variety of Theodicies |author=Michael L. Peterson|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity|editor=Chad Meister|year=2011|page=162|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780195340136.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780195340136-e-12|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fakhr al-Din al-Razi]], who represented the mainstream Sunni view, challenged Ibn Sina's analysis and argued that it merely sidesteps the real problem of evil, which is rooted in the human experience of suffering in a world that contains more pain than pleasure.&lt;ref name=shihadeh/&gt;

The [[Hanbali]] scholar [[Ibn Taymiyya]], whose writings became influential in [[Wahhabism]], argued that, while God creates human acts, humans are responsible for their deeds as the agents of their acts.&lt;ref name=hoover&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Jon|last=Hoover|title=Ḥanbalī Theology|editor=Sabine Schmidtke|encyclopedia=The Oxford Handbook of Islamic Theology|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2014|url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199696703.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199696703-e-014|subscription=yes|page=642}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held that divine creation is good from a casual standpoint, as God creates all things for wise purposes.&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt; Thus apparent evil is in actuality good in view of its purpose, and pure evil does not exist.&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt; This analysis was developed further with practical illustrations by [[Ibn al-Qayyim]].&lt;ref name=hoover/&gt;

==Alternatives==

===Jewish anti-theodicy===
{{Main article|Holocaust theology}}
In 1998, Jewish theologian [[Zachary Braiterman]] coined the term anti-theodicy in his book ''(God) After Auschwitz'' to describe Jews, both in a biblical and post-Holocaust context, whose response to the problem of evil is protest and refusal to investigate the relationship between God and suffering. An anti-theodicy acts in opposition to a theodicy and places full blame for all experience of evil onto God, but must rise from an individual's belief in and love of God. Anti-theodicy has been likened to [[Job (religious figure)|Job's]] protests in the [[Book of Job]].&lt;ref&gt;Marty &amp; Taliaferro 2010, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Braiterman wrote that an anti-theodicy rejects the idea that there is a meaningful relationship between God and evil or that God could be justified for the experience of evil.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs &amp; Wolfson 2002, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Holocaust]] prompted a reconsideration of theodicy in some [[Jewish theology|Jewish]] circles.&lt;ref&gt;Pinnock 2002, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; French Jewish philosopher [[Emmanuel Levinas]], who had himself been a [[prisoner of war]] in Nazi Germany, declared theodicy to be "blasphemous", arguing that it is the "source of all immorality", and demanded that the project of theodicy be ended. Levinas asked whether the idea of [[moral absolutism|absolutism]] survived after the Holocaust, which he proposed it did. He argued that humans are not called to justify God in the face of evil, but to attempt to live godly lives; rather than considering whether God was present during the Holocaust, the duty of humans is to build a world where goodness will prevail.&lt;ref&gt;Patterson &amp; Roth 2005, pp. 189–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of theology David R. Blumenthal, in his book ''Facing the Abusing God'', supports the "theology of protest", which he saw as presented in the play, ''[[The Trial of God]]''. He supports the view that survivors of the Holocaust cannot forgive God and so must protest about it. Blumenthal believes that a similar theology is presented in the [[book of Job]], in which Job does not question God's existence or power, but his morality and justice.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal 1993, pp. 250–51&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent voices in the Jewish tradition commenting on the justification of God in the presence of the Holocaust have been the Nobel prize winning author Elie Wiesel and Richard L. Rubinstein in his book ''The Cunning of History''.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, Richard L. ''The Cunning of History''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the seventh Rebbe of [[Chabad|Chabad Lubavitch]], sought to elucidate how faith (or trust, ''emunah'') in God defines the full, transcendental preconditions of anti-theodicy. Endorsing the attitude of "holy protest" found in the stories of Job and Jeremiah, but also in those of Abraham ([[Vayeira|Genesis 18]]) and Moses ([[Ki Tissa|Exodus 33]]), Rabbi Schneerson argued that a phenomenology of protest, when carried through to its logical limits, reveals a profound conviction in cosmic justice such, as we first find in Abraham's question: "Will the Judge of the whole earth not do justice?" (Genesis 18:25). Recalling Kant's 1791 essay on the failure of all theoretical attempts in theodicy,&lt;ref&gt;''Über das Misslingen aller philosophischen Versuche in der Theodizee'' http://cas.uchicago.edu/workshops/germanphilosophy/files/2013/02/Kant-On-the-Miscarriage-of-all-Philosophical-Trials-at-Theodicy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; a viable practical theodicy is identified with [[Chabad messianism|messianism]]. This faithful anti-theodicy is worked out in a long letter of 26 April 1965 to Elie Wiesel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chighel.com/opening-statement-7a/ The original letter in Yiddish is found in R. Menachem Mendel Schneerson, ''Likutei Siḥot'', Vol. 33 (New York: Kehot, 1962–2001), pp. 255–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christian alternatives to theodicy===
A number of Christian writers oppose theodicies. Todd Billings deems constructing theodicies to be a “destructive practice”.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Billings, "Theodicy as a 'Lived Question': Moving Beyond a Theoretical Approach to Theodicy", http://www.luthersem.edu/ctrf/JCTR/Vol05/billings.htm Accessed September 25, 2013. About the author: http://www.westernsem.edu/about/faculty-staff/.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[Nick Trakakis]] observes that “theodical discourse can only add to the world’s evils, not remove or illuminate them.”&lt;ref&gt;Nick Trakakis, “Theodicy: The Solution to the Problem of Evil, or Part of the Problem?”, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/72023480656648g2/ Springerlink.com], accessed December 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to theodicy, some theologians have advocated “reflection on tragedy” as a more befitting reply to evil.&lt;ref&gt;Donald W. Musser and [[Joseph L. Price]], eds., ''A New Handbook of Christian Theology'' (Abingdon Press, 1992), s.v. “Tragedy.”&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Wendy Farley believes that “a desire for justice” and “anger and pity at suffering” should replace “theodicy’s cool justifications of evil”.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Farley, ''Tragic Vision and Divine Compassion: a Contemporary Theodicy'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1990) 12, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah K. Pinnock opposes abstract theodicies that would legitimize evil and suffering. However, she endorses theodicy discussions in which people ponder God, evil, and suffering from a practical faith perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Katherine Pinnock, ''Beyond Theodicy'' (SUNY Press, 2002), 135, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Barth]] viewed the evil of human suffering as ultimately in the “control of [[divine providence]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'' (T &amp; T Clark, 1957), IV-1, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Given this view, Barth deemed it impossible for humans to devise a theodicy that establishes "the idea of the goodness of God".&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', III-1, 368.&lt;/ref&gt; For Barth, only the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] could establish the goodness of God. In the crucifixion, God bears and suffers what humanity suffers.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', II-2, 165.&lt;/ref&gt; This suffering by God Himself makes human theodicies anticlimactic.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', IV-1, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; Barth found a “twofold justification” in the crucifixion:&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', II-2, 223.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Justification (theology)|justification of sinful humanity]] and “the justification in which God justifies Himself”.&lt;ref&gt;Barth, ''Church Dogmatics'', IV-1, 564.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Science]] offers a rational, though widely unacceptable, solution to the problem by denying that evil ultimately exists.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Dupre, "The Problem of Evil", 50 Philosophy Ideas You Really Need to Know, London, Quercus, 2007, p. 166: "Denying that there is ultimately any such thing as evil, as advocated by Christian Scientists, solves the problem at a stroke, but such a remedy is too hard for most to swallow."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whale, J. S. The Christian answer to the problem of evil. 1948&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Baker Eddy]] and [[Mark Twain]] had some contrasting views on theodicy and suffering, which are well-described by [[Stephen Gottschalk]].&lt;ref&gt;"Rolling Away the Stone: Mary Baker Eddy's Challenge to Materialism" (Indiana University Press, 2006) 83, 123, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Redemptive suffering]] based in Pope John Paul II's [[theology of the body]] embraces suffering as having value in and of itself.&lt;ref name="Adrian J. Reimers"&gt;{{cite article|last=Reimers|first=Adrian J.|title=Human Suffering and Jon Paul II's Theology of the Body|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~areimers/Suffering-JPII-expanded.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicprimer.org/papal/theology_of_the_body.pdf|title=Catholicprimer.org|website=www.catholicprimer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eleonore Stump]] in "Wandering in Darkness" uses psychology, narrative and exegesis to demonstrate that redemptive suffering, as found in Thomistic theodicy, can constitute a consistent and cogent defence for the problem of suffering.&lt;ref name="Eleonore Stump"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stump|first=Eleonore|title=Wandering in Darkness: Narrative and the Problem of Suffering| publisher=Oxford University Press| location=N.Y. New York|year=2010|isbn=978-0-19-927742-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Free will defense===
{{see also|Theodicy and the Bible#Bible and free will theodicy}}
As an alternative to a theodicy, a defense may be offered as a response to the problem of evil. A defense attempts to show that God's existence is not made logically impossible by the existence of evil; it does not need to be true or plausible, merely logically possible.{{According to whom|date=October 2016}} American philosopher [[Alvin Plantinga]] offers [[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense|a free will defense]] which argues that human [[free will]] sufficiently explains the existence of evil while maintaining that God's existence remains logically possible.&lt;ref&gt;McGrath 1995, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that, if God's existence and the existence of evil are to be logically inconsistent, a premise must be provided which, if true, would make them inconsistent; as none has been provided, the existence of God and evil must be consistent. Free will furthers this argument by providing a premise which, in conjunction with the existence of evil, entails that God's existence remains consistent.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga &amp; Sennett 1998, pp. 22–24&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents have argued this defense is discredited by the existence of non-human related evil such as droughts, tsunamis and malaria.&lt;ref name="Ehrman2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bart D. Ehrman|title=God's Problem: How the Bible Fails to Answer Our Most Important Question – Why We Suffer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOCx_wcDkbYC|date=13 October 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-174440-2|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmodicy and anthropodicy&lt;!--'Anthropodicy' redirects here--&gt;===
A cosmodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of the [[universe]] in the face of [[evil]], and an anthropodicy attempts to justify the fundamental goodness of [[human nature]] in the face of the evils produced by humans.&lt;ref&gt;Carsten Meiner, Kristin Veel, eds., ''The Cultural Life of Catastrophes and Crises'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2012), 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the relationship between theodicy and cosmodicy, Johannes van der Ven argued that the choice between theodicy and cosmodicy is a false dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;van der Ven 1989, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt; Philip E. Devenish proposed what he described as "a nuanced view in which theodicy and cosmodicy are rendered complementary, rather than alternative concepts".&lt;ref&gt;Devenish 1992, pp. 5–23&lt;/ref&gt; Theologian J. Matthew Ashley described the relationship between theodicy, cosmodicy and anthropodicy:
{{quote|In classical terms, this is to broach the problem of theodicy: how to think about God in the face of the presence of suffering in God's creation. After God's dethronement as the subject of history, the question rebounds to the new subject of history: the human being. As a consequence, theodicy becomes anthropodicy – justifications of our faith in humanity as the subject of history, in the face of the suffering that is so inextricably woven into the history that humanity makes.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley 2010, pp. 870–902&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Essential kenosis ====

Essential kenosis is a form of process theology, (also known as "open theism") that allows one to affirm that God is almighty, while simultaneously affirming that God cannot prevent genuine evil. Because out of love God necessarily gives freedom, agency, self-organization, natural processes, and law-like regularities to creation, God cannot override, withdraw, or fail to provide such capacities. Consequently, God is not culpable for failing to prevent genuine evil. Thomas Jay Oord's work explains this view most fully.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Uncontrolling Love of God: An Open and Relational Account of Providence|url = https://www.amazon.com/Uncontrolling-Love-God-Relational-Providence/dp/0830840842/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447257309&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=uncontrolling+love+of+god|publisher = IVP Academic|date = 2015-12-06|isbn = 9780830840847|language = English|first = Thomas Jay|last = Oord}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Nature of Love: A Theology|url = https://www.amazon.com/Nature-Love-Dr-Thomas-Oord-ebook/dp/B003UD7QQ0/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447257773&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=nature+of+love+oord|publisher = Chalice Press|date = 2010-04-10|language = English|first = Dr Thomas|last = Oord}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gijsbert van den Brink effectively refutes any view which says God has restricted His power because of his love saying it creates a "metaphysical dualism", and it would not alleviate God's responsibility for evil because God could have prevented evil by not restricting himself. Van den Brink goes on to elaborate an explanation of power and love within the Trinitarian view which equates power and love, and what he calls "the power of love" as representative of God's involvement in the struggle against evil.&lt;ref name="Gijsbert van den Brink"&gt;{{cite book| last="van den Brink"| first=Gijsbert| title=Almighty God: A Study on the Doctrine of Divine Omnipotence| publisher=Kok Pharos publishing House| location=Kampen, the Netherlands|year=1993|pages=263–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''timeline''' is a display of a list of events in [[chronological]] order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Grafton | first= Anthony| authorlink= Anthony Grafton |last2 = Rosenberg | first2 = Daniel | title = Cartographies of Time: A History of the Timeline| publisher = Princeton Architectural Press | year = 2010 | pages = 272 | isbn = 978-1-56898-763-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically a [[graphic design]] showing a long bar labelled with [[calendar date|dates]] alongside itself and usually events. A [[Gantt chart]] is a form of timeline used in [[project management]].

Timelines can use any time scale, depending on the subject and data. Most timelines use a [[linear]] scale, in which a unit of distance is equal to a set amount of time. This timescale is dependent on the events in the timeline. A [[timeline of evolution]] can be over millions of years, whereas a [[timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks]] can take place over minutes, and an explosion over milliseconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spacex.com/news/2016/09/01/anomaly-updates|title=Anomaly Updates|last=plarson|date=2016-09-01|work=SpaceX|access-date=2017-07-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most timelines use a linear timescale, for very large or small timespans, [[logarithmic timeline]]s use a logarithmic scale to depict time.

== Types ==
There are different types of timelines
* Text timelines, labeled as text
* Number timelines, the labels are numbers, commonly [[line graph]]s
* Interactive, clickable, zoomable

There are many methods of visualizations for timelines. Historically, timelines were static images and generally drawn or printed on paper. Timelines relied heavily on [[graphic design]], and the ability of the artist to visualize the data.

Timelines, no longer constrained by previous space and functional limitations, are now digital and interactive, generally created with computer software. [[ChronoZoom]] is an example of computer-aided interactive timeline software.

==Uses of timelines==
{{Nature timeline}}
{{main|List of timelines}}
Timelines are often used in education to help students and researchers with understanding the order or chronology of historical events and trends for a subject.  When showing time on a specific scale on an axis, a timeline can be used to visualize time lapses between events, durations (such as lifetimes or wars), and the simultaneity or overlap of spans and events.

=== In historical studies ===
Timelines are particularly useful for studying history, as they convey a sense of change over time. Wars and social movements are often shown as timelines. Timelines are also useful for [[biography|biographies]]. Examples include:

* [[Timeline of the American Civil Rights Movement]]
* [[Timeline of European exploration]]
* [[Timeline of imperialism]]
* [[Timeline of Solar System exploration]]
* [[Timeline of United States history]]
* [[Timeline of World War I]]
* [[Timeline of religion]]

=== In natural sciences===
Timelines are also used in the natural world and sciences, for subjects such as [[astronomy]], [[biology]], and [[geology]]:

*[[2009 flu pandemic timeline]]
*[[Chronology of the universe]]
*[[Geologic time scale]]
*[[Timeline of evolutionary history of life]]

=== In project management===
Another type of timeline is used for [[project management]]. In these cases, timelines are used to help team members to know what milestones need to be achieved and under what time schedule. For example, in the case of establishing a project timeline in the implementation phase of the [[Systems development life-cycle|life cycle of a computer system]].

'''[[U.S. energy independence]]''' relates to the goal of reducing the United States imports of petroleum and other foreign sources of energy. Energy independence is espoused by those who want to leave the U.S. unaffected by global energy [[supply chain|supply]] disruptions, and to restrict reliance upon politically unstable states for its [[energy security]].  Energy independence is highly concerned with oil, the source of the country's principal [[transport fuel]]s.

In total energy consumption, the U.S. was between 86% and 91% self-sufficient in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/?page=us_energy_home|title=U.S. Energy Facts Explained|author=Energy Information Administration|accessdate=2017-11-30|date=May 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011, the country became a net exporter of [[Oil refinery|refined]] petroleum products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.cfm?id=268&amp;t=6|title=How much of the oil produced in the United States is consumed in the United States?|author=Energy Information Administration|accessdate=2015-05-30|date=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the United States was the world's third-largest producer of crude oil, after Saudi Arabia and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2241rank.html|author=CIA|title=The World Factbook – COUNTRY COMPARISON :: CRUDE OIL – PRODUCTION|accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and second largest exporter of refined products, after Russia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2247rank.html&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2015, 85% of crude oil imports came from (in decreasing volume): Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Venezuela, and Colombia.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Petroleum and other Liquids – Company Level Imports|publisher=[[Energy Information Administration]]|url=http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/imports/companylevel/|accessdate=2015-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19% of imported oil comes from the Middle East.&lt;ref name="wsj1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Independence|author=Daniel Yergin|publisher=''[[Wall Street Journal]]''|url=http://www.cera.com/aspx/cda/public1/news/articles/newsArticleDetails.aspx?CID=8560|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fraction of crude oil consumed in the U.S. that was imported went from 35% immediately before the [[1973 oil crisis]], peaked at 60% in 2005, and then returned to 35% by 2013&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2013/11/congratulations-america-youre-almost-energy-independent-now-what-98985.html?ml=m_b1_2#.VWqZdR0VVzg&lt;/ref&gt; thanks to increased domestic production&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&amp;s=mcrfpus1&amp;f=a&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[tight oil|shale oil]] boom.&lt;ref&gt;Actual net imports also peaked in 2005, regardless of changes in demand: http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MCRNTUS2&amp;f=A&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1970s, exports of crude oil were illegal without a permit; in 2013, the United States physically exported a relatively small amount of oil, and only to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfr.org/oil/case-allowing-us-crude-oil-exports/p31005&lt;/ref&gt; The ban was repealed in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2015/12/18/america-lifts-its-ban-on-oil-exports&lt;/ref&gt;

Greater energy self-sufficiency, it was claimed, would prevent major [[Energy crisis|supply disruptions]] like the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the [[1979 energy crisis]] from recurring. Proponents argue that the potential for political unrest in major oil suppliers, such as [[Oil reserves in Saudi Arabia|Saudi Arabia]], [[Oil reserves in Venezuela|Venezuela]], and [[Petroleum industry in Nigeria|Nigeria]], is abundant, and often causes great fluctuations in crude [[oil price]]s (especially in the short-term).

Large individual [[Natural gas pipeline system in the United States|US pipelines]] and other fuel infrastructure and extraction projects are controversial issues in U.S. politics.

== Historical trend ==
[[File:US Net Gas Imports.png|thumb|Trend of US net imports (imports minus exports) of natural gas, 1974–2013 (data from US EIA)]]
In the early 20th century the United States became a major oil supplier to the world. World War II prompted a [[Synthetic Liquid Fuels Program]] but it did not go beyond research. In mid-century the country shifted from being a major exporter to a net importer. An import quota imposed in 1959 limited imports to a fraction of domestic production until 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/OPEC.html foundation of OPEC]&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[1973 oil crisis]], the [[United States Department of Energy]] and [[Synthetic Fuels Corporation]] were created to address the problem of fuel import dependency.

The U.S.'s dependence on foreign oil rose from 26 percent to 47 percent between 1985 and 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

According to the [[Washington &amp; Jefferson College Energy Index]], by 2012, American energy independence had decreased by 22% since the [[Presidency of Harry Truman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Luna  | first =Taryn | title =W&amp;J College index details U.S. energy consumption | newspaper =[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | date =April 30, 2012  | url =http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/news/environment/wj-college-index-details-us-energy-consumption-633729/ | accessdate = December 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S.'s imports of foreign oil fell to 36 percent in 2013, down from a high of 60 percent in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/opinion/sunday/friedman-foreign-policy-by-whisper-and-nudge.html?pagewanted=all |work=The New York Times |title=Foreign Policy by Whisper and Nudge |date=August 24, 2013 |author=Thomas L. Friedman }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many proponents of energy independence look to the United States' untapped domestic oil reserves, either known or potential. Those who favor increasing domestic oil production often suggest removing many of the limitations on oil exploration in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] (see [[Arctic Refuge drilling controversy]]) and the [[outer continental shelf]].  Foreign dependence is not the only factor in North American [[Petroleum politics|energy politics]], however; environmental concerns around land and water pollution and [[greenhouse gas]]es are also matters of controversy.

== Approaches ==
{{Main|Energy conservation|Energy development|Mitigation of peak oil}}

Some proponents of U.S. energy independence promote wider use of alternatives such as [[ethanol fuel]], [[methanol]], [[biodiesel]], [[plug-in hybrid]]s and other [[alternative propulsion]]. A 2013 report published by the [[Fuel Freedom Foundation]] said that without a shift to domestic [[feedstock]]s for fuel, such as natural gas and [[biomass]], the US would not be able to achieve energy independence.&lt;ref&gt;Aronoff and Taft (2014). [http://www.fuelfreedom.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Can-the-US-become-energy-independent.pdf "Is Energy Independence Really Possible In The United States?"]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, the United States imposes an import tariff of 54 cents a gallon on ethanol fuel (there is no such import tariff on oil or [[methanol fuel]]). [[Ethanol fuel in Brazil]] is produced from [[sugarcane]], which yields much more fuel per acre than the corn used for ethanol production in the United States.

In the United States, oil is primarily consumed as fuel for cars, buses, trucks and airplanes (in the form of gasoline, diesel and [[jet fuel]]). Two-thirds of U.S. oil consumption is due to the transportation sector. A national strategy designed to shift all transportation to a combined use of alternative fuels and plug-in hybrids is predicted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.plugincars.com/silver-bullet-plug-biofuel-hybrids.html|title=The Silver Bullet: Plug-in Biofuel Hybrids|date=February 19, 2010|work=PluginCars.com|access-date=2017-04-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make the U.S. independent of petroleum (oil).

If [[alternative fuel]]s are desired at any cost, then the U.S. could also make [[synthetic fuel]] from its coal reserves. Methanol, synthetic diesel and gasoline made from U.S. coal can replace petroleum-derived fuels for a hundred years, which is long enough to develop sustainable domestic renewable fuels such as [[cellulosic ethanol]] or methanol.

===North American energy independence===

Oil imports are most problematic in domestic politics and energy security when they come from countries that are openly hostile to US foreign policy and interests (Iran, Venezuela, and formerly Iraq), are former or potential future rivals (Russia) or have questionable human rights practices (Saudi Arabia).  Sometimes an alternative '''North American energy independence'' is proposed,{{By whom|date=May 2014}} by which North America as a unit should be energy independent, but in which the U.S. could still import energy from Canada and Mexico, which are less problematic allies and more tightly economically integrated.

A related, less absolute, policy may be called ''North American energy security''.  In 2012 in an editorial to Canadian newspaper ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' Mexican president elect [[Enrique Peña Nieto]], called North American energy security a "common goal" of Canada and Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peña Nieto|first1=Enrique|title=For Mexico and Canada, there's room to grow|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/for-mexico-and-canada-theres-room-to-grow/article5698332/|accessdate=January 27, 2017|work=The Globe and Mail|date=November 27, 2012|language=en-ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits are argued to be similar to U.S. energy independence – the reduction of North America's energy dependence on unstable regions such as the Middle East and South America and accepting supplies from the reliable [[North American Free Trade Area]], reducing exposure to terrorism abroad; lower [[balance of trade]] and [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] stresses on the [[U.S. economy]] in an era when suppliers may begin to price oil in [[euro]]s; the development of [[renewable energy]] sources to displace [[fossil fuel]]s; and the promotion of [[energy conservation]] technology exportable to energy-poor nations.

=== Programs to limit US energy interests by Canada and Mexico ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2014}}
In Canada and Mexico there is also the concern not to have energy policy dictated by the United States, as well as tension over U.S. ownership of energy companies.

In 1937 Mexico passed a constitutional amendment to [[Nationalization|nationalize]] its oil industry, which led to the creation of [[Pemex]], the [[national oil company]]. There have been several proposals to privatize Pemex since, but they have never come to fruition as many Mexicans fear foreign control of this strategic industry.

The [[Canadian federal election, 1957|1957 Canadian election]] was fought partially in response to the 1956 [[Pipeline Debate]] which concerned whether or not the government should allow a US-owned company to build a [[TransCanada pipeline|trans-Canadian gas pipeline]] and whether the route should be entirely within Canada or partly through the United States. The right-leaning [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]] and leftist [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] opposition parties opposed American involvement in the pipeline while the Liberal government supported it. The Liberals were defeated in the 1957 election.

In 1973 Canada created its own state energy company [[Petro-Canada]]. It began operations in 1976, though it bought assets from private companies rather than seizing them as in many other countries. In 1980 the [[National Energy Program]] was launched to create oil self-sufficiency within Canada.  It attempted to use tax incentives to discourage oil exports (mostly from Western Canada, primarily the province of [[Alberta]]) to the US, and redirect these towards to the oil importing provinces of Eastern Canada. The [[Foreign Investment Review Agency]] was also created to screen foreign (mostly U.S.) takeovers of Canadian companies. These policies were bitterly opposed by the provincial government of Alberta, and were repealed and reversed during the Conservative government of 1984–1993 which sought closer economic ties with the U.S., including the [[Canada–US Free Trade Agreement]] of 1988.

== Debate ==
In a 2012 poll of energy experts by ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine, almost two-thirds of respondents said energy independence was not a sensible goal.&lt;ref&gt;Yergin, Daniel; "How is Energy Remaking the World?" ''Foreign Policy'' July/August 2012 pg. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Highlighting the difficulty of separating domestic and foreign oil sources, journalist Robert Bryce stated in 2008 that "the trends of energy interdependence are growing and are inexorable" and branded the idea of being able to choose where your oil came from as "hogwash".

The structure of the argument of critics is arranged as follows:
# Energy independence will not decrease U.S. involvement in the Middle East.
## Interests in the [[Persian Gulf]], including the protection of worldwide energy security upon which the global economy is dependent, will remain a U.S. priority.&lt;ref name="Bryce, Robert 2008"&gt;Bryce, Robert. Gusher of Lies: The Dangerous Delusions of "Energy Independence". New York, NY: PublicAffairs, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
## Terrorism will not decline in the Middle East if the US ceases to buy oil, because terrorism is not funded by oil money.&lt;ref name="Bryce, Robert 2008"/&gt;
## Although vast oil supplies are found in an unstable region subject to difficult geopolitics,&lt;ref&gt;Balestrini, Santiago. "The Nuclear Option for Long-Term Energy Independence: Report for the 2006/2007 Sam Nunn Security Program Energy Policy Exercise". Pp. 1–26. http://www.janosburg.net/publications/2007_SNSP_Energy_Exercise_Report_NuclearOption.pdf December 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; these [[geopolitics]] will continue to be fueled by other large consumers of oil, such as China, whether or not the U.S. achieves energy independence. U.S. energy independence will not cause a U.S. pull-out from the Middle East, it will not decrease terrorism, and it will not foster stability or reform in the region.
# Renewable energy sources can be extremely inefficient, as in the case of corn-based biofuels, which requires massive government subsidies and also enormous amounts of water and chemicals to grow, and causes significant air pollution when burned.&lt;ref name="Bryce, Robert 2008"/&gt; Other renewables, namely wind and solar power, are expensive and intermittent, and lack the infrastructure and technology needed to properly store the energy they harness from the environment:
## Natural gas was not a viable portion of US energy as of 2008, since we may have peaked in domestic reserves: U.S. imports of natural gas from Canada tripled since 1973.&lt;ref name="Bryce, Robert 2008"/&gt;
### However, US gross natural gas production set new all-time record highs each year from 2007 through 2013, due in part to new methods to extract [[Shale gas]].  Despite record withdrawals, the volume of US [[proved reserves]] still in the ground also stands at an all-time high, according to reserve data for the end of 2011.  US net imports of natural gas peaked in 2007, then declined rapidly, and in 2013 were 60 percent below 2007.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/data.cfm Natural gas data], accessed March 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
## In the absence of [[breeder reactor]]s or [[fusion reactor]]s, nuclear power plants aren't a solution to energy independence either, since uranium must be imported: currently, 80% of U.S. uranium is imported, mainly from Russia and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Yamanaka, Megumi. "US demand for uranium seen rising sharply", International Herald Tribune. April 16, 2007. http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/04/15/bloomberg/bxcom.php. December 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
## Although the U.S. enjoys massive coal reserves able to power our country at current rates of energy consumption for 200 years,&lt;ref name="Bryce, Robert 2008"/&gt; the hope that the country could use this resource as a liquid to fuel our transportation sector is unlikely. Although currently the U.S. remains a net coal exporter of lower-quality coal, a large and, as of 2008, increasing portion of coal is being imported due to the cheaper, high-quality, low-sulfur foreign coal needed by power plants coping with air-quality regulations.&lt;ref name="Bryce, Robert 2008"/&gt;
### However, from 2007 to 2011, US coal imports fell by 64%, and coal exports rose by 81%.  As of 2011, coal exports from the US were eight times the tonnage of imports, and the US was the world's fourth-largest exporter of coal.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration [http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/showtext.cfm?t=ptb0701 Coal overview], September 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
## U.S. oil reserves cannot be relied upon: U.S. oil production in 2008 had been steadily declining since 1970.&lt;ref name="Bryce, Robert 2008"/&gt;
### From that point, US oil production rose rapidly during 2009–2013; US crude oil production for 2013 was 49% higher than that of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_crd_crpdn_adc_mbbl_m.htm Crude oil production], accessed March 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Benefits of oil dependence ===
Roger Howard&lt;ref&gt;author of ''The Oil Hunters: Exploration and Espionage in the Middle East'', 2008, Hambledon Continuum, London / New York, {{ISBN|978-1-84725-232-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122791647562165587 ''An Ode to Oil''], Wall Street Journal, 11/29/08&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that oil dependence has significant benefits for the US and other oil-importing nations. First, the world's major oil exporters are highly dependent on their oil revenues, and fear rapid drops in the [[price of oil]], such as occurred in late 2008 and in 2014/2015. Second, this fear restrains destructive actions by exporters: Howard cites the example of Russia's 2008 invasion of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Russia's stock market plunged, and "within a week capital outflow reached a massive $16&amp;nbsp;billion, suddenly squeezing domestic credit while the ruble collapsed in value." He also gives the example of [[Libya]], where [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] gave up his Pakistani [[nuclear weapons]] in exchange for the US lifting its [[economic sanctions]], which had prevented Libya from increasing its oil production.

In his 2006 [[State of the Union Address]], [[George W. Bush]] used the phrase ''addicted to oil'', a phrase widely discussed in the media.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5181934 The State of the Union: A Look Between the Lines], [[NPR]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11110276/ Bush: U.S. must cut oil dependence], [[MSNBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4669870.stm Bush in a lighter shade of green], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy resilience and AERS ===

[[Andy Grove]] argues that energy independence is a [[wikt:flawed|flawed]] and [[wikt:infeasible|infeasible]] objective, particularly in a network of integrated [[World economy|global exchange]]. He suggests instead that the objective should be [[energy resilience]]: resilience goes hand in hand with adaptability, and it also is reflected in important market ideas like [[Substitute good|substitutability]]. Resilience is one of the best features of [[Market economy|market processes]]; the information transmission function of prices means that individual buyers and sellers can adapt to changes in supply and demand conditions in a decentralized way. His suggestion for how to increase the [[Resilience (organizational)|resilience]] of the U.S. energy economy is to shift use from petroleum to electricity ([[electrification]]), that can be produced using multiple sources of energy, including [[renewable source|renewables]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knowledgeproblem.com/archives/002597.html |title=Andy Grove: Energy resilience, not energy independence |publisher=''www.knowledgeproblem.com'' |author=Lynne Kiesling |accessdate=2008-09-27 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013004434/http://www.knowledgeproblem.com/archives/002597.html |archive-date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 former vice president [[Al Gore]] challenged the United States to commit to producing [[all electricity from renewable sources]] (AERS) like solar and wind power in 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planet Ark : Gore: Make All US Electricity From Renewable Sources|url=http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/49420/story.htm|author=Jasmin Melvin|author2=Deborah Zabarenko |publisher=''[[Reuters]]''|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Gore Sets Energy Goal |url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/al-gore-sets-energy-goal-1142.html|author=Ucilia Wang|publisher=''greentechmedia.com''|accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the [[Center for Resource Solutions]] and current president [[Barack Obama]] have publicly stated they support Al Gore's AERS goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.resource-solutions.org/where/pressreleases/2008/071808.htm |title=Center for Resource Solutions Supports Al Gore's 100% Renewable Energy Goal |publisher=''www.resource-solutions.org'' |accessdate=2008-09-27 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105172853/http://www.resource-solutions.org/where/pressreleases/2008/071808.htm |archive-date=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada is the worlds second largest producer of hydroelectricity (after China) and exported three billion dollars worth of electricity to the US in 2015, mostly from the major hydro-producing provinces of Québec, Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neb.gc.ca/nrg/sttstc/lctrct/stt/lctrctysmmr/2015/smmry2015-eng.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obama administration===
U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] has repeatedly stated that the U.S. has begun "freeing ourselves from foreign oil" including during his 2012 reelection speech.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calgaryherald.com/business/Obama+could+dally+Keystone+decision/7516081/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Canadian observers have noted that his usage of "foreign" does not include Canada.  Yet in November 2015, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] rejected the proposal to build the [[Keystone XL pipeline]] from Alberta to the [[Gulf coast]] because of domestic environmental concerns over water quality as well as the general antipathy of the [[environmental movement]] to pipeline building, and the production practices in the source (the [[Athabasca Oil Sands]]).&lt;ref name=NoKeystone&gt;{{cite news

{{Translation sidebar}}
'''Untranslatability''' is a property of a text, or of any utterance, in one [[language]], for which no equivalent text or utterance can be found in another language when translated. This term often arises to describe the difficulty of achieving the so-called perfect translation based on the notion that there are thought processes and words that are so interrelated so that translation becomes an impossible task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Spanish-English Translation|last=Aranda|first=Lucia|publisher=University Press of America|year=2007|isbn=9780761837305|location=Lanham, MD|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terms are, however, neither exclusively translatable nor exclusively untranslatable; rather, the degree of difficulty of [[translation]] depends on their nature, as well as on the translator's knowledge of the languages in question.

== Theories ==
There is a school of thought identified with [[Walter Benjamin]] that identifies the concept of "sacred" in relation to translation and this pertains to the text that is untranslatable because its meaning and letter cannot be disassociated.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Through a Glass Darkly: Essays in the Religious Imagination|last=Hawley|first=John Charles|publisher=Fordham University Press|year=1996|isbn=0823216365|location=New York|pages=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stems from the view that translation should realize the imagined perfect relationship with the original text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Untranslatability Goes Global|last=Levine|first=Suzanne|last2=Lateef-Jan|first2=Katie|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2018|isbn=9781138744301|location=New York|pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory highlights the paradoxical nature of translation wherein it - as a process - assumes the forms of necessity and impossibility at the same time. This is demonstrated in [[Jacques Derrida]]'s analysis of the myth of [[Tower of Babel|Babel]], a word which he described as a name that means confusion and also a proper name of God.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Borges and Translation: The Irreverence of the Periphery|last=Waisman|first=Sergio Gabriel|publisher=Bucknell University Press|year=2005|isbn=0838755925|location=Lewisburg|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Derrida noted that when God condemned the [[Shem|Shems]] to a multiplicity of tongues, he created a paradoxical need and impossibility of translation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

Derrida himself has put forward his own notion of the untranslatability of the text, arguing in his early works such as the ''Writing and Difference'' and ''Margins of Philosophy'' that there is an excess of untranslatable meaning in literature and these cannot be reduced to a closed system or a restricted economy&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; "in which there is nothing that cannot be made to make sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Margins of Philosophy|last=Derrida|first=Jacques|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1982|isbn=0226143260|location=Chicago|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian James Baer posits that untranslatability is sometimes seen by nations as proof of the national genius. Literature that can be easily translated may be considered as lacking originality, while translated work themselves may be regarded merely as imitations. Baer quotes [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] defining true genius as "the kind that creates and makes everything out of nothing". Paraphrasing [[Robert Frost]]'s remark about poetry ("Poetry is what gets lost in translation"), Baer suggests that "one could define national identity as that which is lost in translation". He further quotes Alexandra Jaffe: "When translators talk about untranslatable, they often reinforce the notion that each language has its own 'genius', an 'essence' that naturally sets it apart from all other languages and reflects something of the 'soul' of its culture or people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Translation and the Making of Modern Russian Literature|first=Brian James|last=Baer|url={{Google books|IvOECgAAQBAJ|plainurl=yes}}|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quite often, a text or utterance that is considered to be "untranslatable" is considered a ''lacuna'', or [[lexical gap]]. That is, there is no one-to-one equivalence between the word, expression or turn of phrase in the source language and another word, expression or turn of phrase in the target language. A translator can, however, resort to a number of translation procedures to compensate for this. From this perspective, untranslatability or difficulty of translation does not always carry deep [[linguistic relativity]] implications; [[denotation]] can virtually always be translated, given enough [[circumlocution]], although [[connotation]] may be [[ineffability|ineffable]] or inefficient to convey.

==Translation procedures==
''[[Nota bene|N.B.]]: The majority of examples and illustrations given below will involve translating to or from the [[English language]].''

The translation procedures that are available in cases of lacunae, or lexical gaps, include the following:

===Adaptation===
An '''adaptation''', also known as a '''free translation''', is a procedure whereby the translator replaces a term with cultural connotations, where those connotations are restricted to readers of the original language text, with a term with corresponding cultural connotations that would be familiar to readers of the translated text.

For example, in the [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[comic book]] ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'', Tintin's trusty canine sidekick ''Milou'' is translated as ''Snowy'' in [[English language|English]], ''Bobbie'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Kuttus'' in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], and ''Struppi'' in [[German language|German]]; likewise the detectives ''Dupont'' and ''Dupond'' become [[Thomson and Thompson|''Thomson'' and ''Thompson'']] in English, ''Jansen'' and ''Janssen'' in [[Dutch Language|Dutch]], ''Jonson'' and ''Ronson'' in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], ''Schultze'' and ''Schulze'' in [[German Language|German]], ''Hernández'' and ''Fernández'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], {{lang|zh|杜本}} and {{lang|zh|杜朋}} (''Dùběn'' and ''Dùpéng'') in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], ''Dyupon'' and ''Dyuponn'' in [[Russian language|Russian]] and ''Skafti'' and ''Skapti'' in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].

Adaptation is often used when translating [[poetry]], works of [[theatre]], and [[advertising]].

===Borrowing===
{{See also|Loanword}}
'''Borrowing''' is a translation procedure whereby the translator uses a word or expression from the source text in the [[target text]] unmodified.

In English text, borrowings not sufficiently anglicised are normally in italics.

===Calque===
'''[[Calque]]''' entails taking an expression, breaking it down to individual elements and translating each element into the target language word for word. For example, the German word "[[:de:Alleinvertretungsanspruch|Alleinvertretungsanspruch]]" can be calqued to "single-representation-claim", but a proper translation would result in "[[exclusive mandate]]". Word-by-word translations usually have comic value, but can be a means to save as much of the original style as possible, especially when the source text is ambiguous or undecipherable to the translator.

===Paraphrase===
'''Paraphrase''', sometimes called '''[[periphrasis]]''', is a translation procedure whereby the translator replaces a word in the source text by a group of words or an expression in the target text. For example, the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word {{lang|pt|[[saudade]]}} is often translated into English as "the feeling of missing a person who is gone". A similar example is "dor" in Romanian, translated into English as "missing someone or something that's gone and/or not available at the time".{{cn|date=October 2017}}

An example of untranslatability is seen in the Dutch language through the word {{lang|nl|[[gezelligheid]]}}, which does not have an English equivalent, though the German equivalent ''[[Gemütlichkeit]]'' is sometimes used. Literally, it means a cozy, friendly, or nice atmosphere, but can also connote time spent with loved ones, the fact of seeing a friend after a long absence, the friendliness or chattiness of a specific person, or a general sense of togetherness. Such gaps can lead to word borrowing, as with [[pajamas]] or [[Zeitgeist]].

===Translator's note===
A '''translator's note''' is a note (usually a [[footnote]] or an [[endnote]]) added by the translator to the target text to provide additional information pertaining to the limits of the translation, the cultural background, or any other explanations.

==Examples==

===Register===
Although [[Thai language|Thai]] has words that can be used as equivalent to English "I", "you", or "he/she/it", they are relatively formal terms (or markedly informal). In most cases, Thai people use words which express the relation between speaker and listener according to their respective roles. For instance, for a mother to say to her child "I'll tell you a story", she would say "แม่จะเล่านิทานให้ลูกฟัง" (mae ja lao nitaan hai luuk fang), or "Mother will tell child a story". Similarly, older and younger friends will often use sibling terminology, so that an older friend telling a younger friend "You're my friend" would be "น้องเป็นเพื่อนพี่" (nawng pen peuan pii), would translate directly as "Younger sibling is older sibling’s friend". To be translated into English correctly, it is proper to use "I" and "you" for these example statements, but normal Thai perceptions of relation are lost in the process. Similar phenomena can also be observed in Indonesian. One may use the formal form of pronouns, which are generally distinct from the informal/familiar forms; however, the use of these pronouns does not evoke sufficient friendliness or intimacy, especially in spoken language. Instead of saying "''Anda mau pesan apa?''", a waiter/waitress will most likely say "''Bapak/Ibu mau pesan apa?''" (lit. Sir/Madam wants to order what?). Both expressions are equally polite; however, the latter is more sympathetic and friendly. When conversing with family and relatives, most Indonesians also prefer using [[kinship terminology]] (father, mother, brother, sister, etc.) when addressing elder family members. When addressing younger family members, informal pronouns are more prevalent.

===Grammar===

====Possession====
Translating the English word ''have'' to [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Japanese Language|Japanese]], [[Korean Language|Korean]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], or [[Welsh language|Welsh]], is somewhat difficult, as there is no specific verb with this meaning in these languages. Instead, for "I have X" these languages use a combination of words that mean ''X is to me''; or (in Finnish) ''at me is X''; (in Turkish) ''my X exists'' or ''at me exists X''; or (in Hebrew) ''there-is of-me (represents ownership, could mean to-me) X.''

In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], there is a word corresponding to "have": ''bír'' — but its use is quite scarce today usually turning up in very formal and legal texts. It also sounds outdated, since it was used to translate the Latin ''habeo'' and the German ''haben'' possessive verbs when these languages had official status in Hungary. The general grammatical construction used is "there is a(n) X of mine". For example, the English sentence "I have a car." translates to Hungarian as ''"Van egy autóm."'' which would translate back to English word by word as "There is a car of mine.".

A similar construction occurs in Russian, where "I have" translates literally into ''at (''or'' by) me there is''. Russian does have a word that means "to have": {{lang|ru|иметь}} (''imet&amp;#39;'') — but it is very rarely used by Russian speakers in the same way English speakers use the word ''have''; in fact, in some cases, it may be misinterpreted as vulgar slang for the subject rudely using the object for sexual gratification; for example, in an inept translation of "Do you have a wife?"

In Japanese, the English word "to have" is most often translated into the verbs iru (いる or 居る) and aru (ある or 有る). The former verb is used to indicate the presence of a person, animal, or other living creature (excluding plant life) while the latter verb is closer to the English "to have" and is used for inanimate objects. "I have a pen" becomes "Watashi ni wa pen ga aru" (私にはペンがある) which can be represented in English as "I (topic) pen (subject) exists". To indicate the English "have" in the sense of possession, the Japanese language uses the verb motsu (持つ), which literally means "to carry." This could be used as "Kare wa keitai wo motteiru" (彼は携帯を持っている), which becomes "He (subject) cellphone (object) is carrying" or "He has a cellphone".

====Verb forms====
English lacks some grammatical categories.

There is no simple way in English to contrast Finnish {{lang|fi|kirjoittaa}} or Polish {{lang|pl|pisać}} (continuing, corresponding to English ''to write'') and {{lang|fi|kirjoitella}} or {{lang|pl|pisywać}} (a regular [[frequentative]], "to occasionally write short passages at a time", or "to jot down now and then"). Also, {{lang|fi|hypätä}} and {{lang|pl|skoczyć}} (to jump once) and {{lang|fi|hyppiä}} and {{lang|pl|skakać}} (to continuously jump; to be jumping from point A to B) are another example.

Irish allows the [[prohibitive mood]] to be used in the [[passive voice]]. The effect is used to prohibit something while expressing society's disapproval for that action at the same time. For example, contrast ''Ná caithigí tobac'' (meaning "Don't smoke" when said to multiple people), which uses the second person plural in the imperative meaning "Do not smoke", with ''Ná caitear tobac'', which is best translated as "Smoking just isn't done here", uses the autonomous imperative meaning "One does not smoke".

Italian has three distinct declined past tenses, where {{lang|it|fui}} ({{lang|it|passato remoto}}), {{lang|it|ero}} ({{lang|it|imperfetto}}) and {{lang|it|sono stato}} ({{lang|it|passato prossimo}}) all mean ''I was'', the first indicating a concluded action in the (remote) past, the second a progressive or habitual action in the past, and the latter an action that holds some connection to the present, especially if a recent time is specified ("stamattina ho visto" for ''this morning I saw''). The "{{lang|it|passato remoto}}" is often used for narrative history (for example, novels).
Nowadays, the difference between "{{lang|it|passato remoto}}" and "{{lang|it|passato prossimo}}" is blurred in the spoken language, the latter being used in both situations. What difference there exists is partly geographic. In the north of Italy the "{{lang|it|passato remoto}}" is very rarely used in everyday speech, whereas in the south it often takes the place of the "{{lang|it|passato prossimo}}". The distinction is only alive in Tuscany, which makes it dialectal even if hardline purists insist it should be applied consistently.

Likewise, English lacks a productive grammatical means to show [[indirection (linguistics)|indirection]] but must instead rely on [[periphrasis]], that is the use of multiple words to explain an idea. Finnish grammar, on the contrary, allows the regular production of a series of verbal derivatives, each of which involves a greater degree of indirection. For example, on the basis of the verb ''vetää'' (to pull), it is possible to produce:
*''vetää'' (pull),
*''vedättää'' (cause something/someone to pull/to wind-up (lie)),
*''vedätyttää'' (cause something/someone to cause something/someone to pull),
*''vedätätyttää'' (cause something/someone to cause something/someone to cause something/someone to pull).

Hindi has a similar concept of indirection. 'Karna' means 'to do'; 'karaana' means 'to make someone do'; 'karwaana' means 'to get someone to make yet another person do'

Most [[Turkic languages]] (Turkish, Azeri, Kazakh, etc.) contain the grammatical verb suffix ''"miş"'' (or ''"mis"'' in other dialects), which indicates that the speaker did not witness the act personally but surmises or has discovered that the act has occurred or was told of it by another, as in the example of ''"Gitmiş!"'' (Turkish), which can be expressed in English as "it is reported that he/she/it has gone", or, most concisely, as "apparently, he/she/it has gone". This grammatical form is especially used when telling jokes, or narrating stories.

Similar to the Turkic ''"miş"'', nearly every [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] sentence is marked by an evidential clitic, indicating the source of the speaker's knowledge (and how certain s/he is about the statement). The enclitic ''=mi'' expresses personal knowledge (''Tayta Wayllaqawaqa chufirmi'', "Mr. Huayllacahua is a driver - I know it for a fact"); ''=si'' expresses hearsay knowledge (''Tayta Wayllaqawaqa chufirsi'', "Mr. Huayllacahua is a driver, or so I've heard"); ''=chá'' expresses high probability (''Tayta Wayllaqawaqa chufirchá'', "Mr. Huayllacahua is a driver, most likely"). Colloquially, the latter is also used when the speaker has dreamed the event told in the sentence or experienced it under alcohol intoxication.

Languages that are extremely different from each other, like English and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], need their translations to be more like adaptations. Chinese has no [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] per se, only three [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]s. The English verb ''[[copula (linguistics)|to be]]'' [[copula (linguistics)|does not have a direct equivalent in Chinese]]. In an English sentence where ''to be'' leads to an [[adjective]] ("It ''is'' blue"), there is no ''to be'' in Chinese. (There are no adjectives in Chinese, instead there are [[stative verbs]] that do not need an extra verb.) If it states a location, the verb ''"zài"'' ({{lang|zh|在}}) is used, as in "We ''are'' in the house". In some other cases (usually when stating a judgement), the judgment verb ''"shì"'' ({{lang|zh|是}}) is used, as in "I ''am'' the leader." And in most other cases, such structure ("to be") is simply not used, but some more natural structure in Chinese is used instead. Any sentence that requires a play on those different meanings will not work the same way in Chinese. In fact, very simple concepts in English can sometimes be difficult to translate, for example, there is no single direct translation for the word "yes" in Chinese, as in Chinese the affirmative is said by repeating the verb in the question. ("Do you have it?" "(I) have".)

===Vocabulary===
[[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[Danish language|Danish]] have a wealth of [[German modal particle|modal particles]] that are particularly difficult to translate as they convey sense or tone rather than strictly grammatical information. The most infamous example perhaps is ''doch'' (Dutch: ''toch'', Danish: ''dog''), which roughly means "Don't you realize that . . . ?" or "In fact it is so, though someone is denying it." What makes translating such words difficult is their different meanings depending on intonation or the context.

A common use of the word ''doch'' can be found in the German sentence ''Der Krieg war &lt;u&gt;doch&lt;/u&gt; noch nicht verloren'', which translates to ''The war wasn't lost yet, &lt;u&gt;after all&lt;/u&gt;'' or ''The war was &lt;u&gt;still&lt;/u&gt; not lost.''

Several other grammatical constructs in English may be employed to translate these words for each of their occurrences. The same ''Der Krieg war &lt;u&gt;doch&lt;/u&gt; noch nicht verloren'' with slightly changed pronunciation can also mean excuse in defense to a question: ''. . . &lt;u&gt;but&lt;/u&gt; the war was not lost yet (. . . so we fought on).''

A use which relies heavily on intonation and context could produce yet another meaning: "So the war was &lt;u&gt;really&lt;/u&gt; not over yet (as you have been trying to convince me all along)."

Another change of intonation makes the sentence a question. ''Der Krieg war &lt;u&gt;doch&lt;/u&gt; noch &lt;u&gt;nicht&lt;/u&gt; verloren?'' would translate into ''"(You mean) the war was &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; yet lost (back then)?"''

Another well-known example comes from the Portuguese or Spanish verbs {{lang|es|ser}} and {{lang|es|estar}}, both translatable as ''to be'' (see [[Romance copula]]). However, {{lang|es|ser}} is used only with essence or nature, while {{lang|es|estar}} is used with states or conditions. Sometimes this information is not very relevant for the meaning of the whole sentence and the translator will ignore it, whereas at other times it can be retrieved from the context.

When none of these apply, the translator will usually use a [[paraphrase]] or simply add words that can convey that meaning. The following example comes from Portuguese:
:"{{lang|pt|Não estou bonito, eu '''sou''' bonito.}}"
:Spanish equivalent:"{{lang|es|No estoy guapo; yo '''soy''' guapo.}}"
:Literal translation: "I am not (apparently) handsome; I '''am''' (essentially) handsome."
:Adding words: "I am not handsome today; I am always handsome."
:Paraphrase: "I don't look handsome; I '''am''' handsome."

Some South Slavic words that have no English counterparts are ''doček'', a gathering organized at someone's arrival (the closest translation would be ''greeting'' or ''welcome''; however, a 'doček' does not necessarily have to be positive); and ''limar'', a sheet metal worker.

====Family====
For various reasons, such as differences in linguistic features or culture, it is often difficult to translate terms for [[Kinship terminology|family members]].

Many [[Bengali language|Bengali]] kinship words consider both gender and age. For example, Father's elder brothers are called ''Jethu'' (জ্যাঠা)' while younger brothers are called ''Kaku'' (কাকু). Their wives are called ''Jethi-ma'' (জেঠি-মা) and ''Kaki-ma'' (কাকি-মা), respectively. Father's sister is called ''Pisi'' (পিসি), mother's sister is ''Maasi'' (মাসি). Mother's brother is called ''Mama'' (মামা) and his wife, ''Mami'' (মামি). English would just use ''Uncle'' and ''Aunt''. An elder brother is ''Dada'' (দাদা), elder sister is ''Didi'' (দিদি), while the younger brother is ''Bhai'' (ভাই) and younger sister, ''Bon'' (বোন). Similar is the case with many Indian languages like [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and many others including Punjabi and Urdu for many relationships amongst family and relatives.

It is usually also difficult to translate simple English kinship words accurately into Chinese, for Chinese distinguishes very many kinship terms, depending on the person's actual position in family kinship.

Most [[Thai language|Thai]] words expressing kinship have no direct translations and require additional words. There are no Thai equivalents for most daily English kinship terms, as English terms leave out much information that is natural to Thai.

As an example, Thai does not distinguish between siblings by gender, but by age. Siblings older than yourself are พี่ (Pii), and those younger are  น้อง (Nawng). Almost similar distinctions apply to aunts and uncles, based on whether they are older or younger than the sibling parent, and also whether they are maternal or paternal uncles. Thai disregards gender when aunts or uncles are younger than his/her parents. But when aunts and uncles are older siblings of his/her parents, gender comes to differentiate them but whether they are from maternal or paternal side is no longer important. For instance, น้า (Naa) means "mother's younger brother/sister". อา (Aah) means "father's younger brother/sister". But ลุง (Loong) means "father's or mother's older brother" and ป้า (Paa) means "father's or mother's older sister". As for nieces, nephews, and grandchildren, Thai only has one genderless word, หลาน (Laan) to describe all of them.

=====Siblings=====
In Arabic, "brother" is often translated into أخ (''Akh''). However, whilst this word may describe a brother who shares either one or both parents, there is a separate word - شقيق (''Shaqīq'') - to describe a brother with whom one shares both parents.

In Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Lao, Tagalog, Turkish, most north Indian languages, Sinhala, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Hungarian there are separate words for "older brother" and "younger brother" and, likewise, "older sister" and "younger sister". The simple words "brother" and "sister" are rarely used to describe a person, and most commonly appear in the plural. (In Hungarian, however, the terms ''"fiútestvér"'' and ''"lánytestvér"'', meaning "male sibling" and "female sibling" respectively, exist but are not commonly used.). On the other hand, the word for 'sibling' in many other languages lacks the slightly technical/non-colloquial nature of the English word, which often leads to native speakers preferring the longer 'brother(s) and/or sister(s)' instead.

=====Grandparents=====
Swedish, Norwegian and Danish have the terms ''farmor'' (father's mother) and ''farfar'' (father's father) for paternal grandparents, and ''mormor'' (mother's mother) and ''morfar'' (mother's father) for maternal grandparents. The English terms great-grandfather and great-grandmother also have different terms in Swedish, depending on lineage. This distinction between paternal and maternal grandparents is also used in Chinese, Korean, Thai, Malayalam as well as Punjabi, Urdu, Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali and other [[Indo-Aryan languages]].

Norwegian also has the terms ''sønnesønn'', ''dattersønn'', ''datterdatter'' and ''sønnedatter'', meaning respectively "son of my son", "son of my daughter", "daughter of my daughter", and "daughter of my son". Similar words exist in Swedish, Danish and Icelandic. In both cases, there exist terms synonymous with the English grand-prefixed ones which are used when exact relation is not an issue. This distinction is also used in the Indian languages as mentioned above and Chinese, whereas Chinese almost always states the relationship clearly.

=====Aunts and uncles=====
In [[Danish language|Danish]], Tamil, Kannada, Bengali, Persian, Turkish, Chinese, Swedish and [[South Slavic languages]] there are different words for the person indicated by "mother's brother", "father's brother" and "parent's sister's husband", all of which would be ''uncle'' in English. German had distinct words for maternal uncles (Oheim) and maternal aunts (Muhme), but they are not used any more. An exactly analogous situation exists for ''aunt''. In Thai, Hindi, Malayalam and Punjabi this concept is taken a step further in that there are different words for the person indicated by "mother's elder brother" and "mother's younger brother", as well as "father's elder brother" and "father's younger brother".

The [[Polish language]] used to distinguish "paternal uncle" ("''stryj''") and "maternal uncle" ("''wuj''"), but the first term is now archaic.

Swedish (and Danish) has words ''tant/tante'' for "auntie" (''rarely used in Swedish'') or "''old lady''" in general, ''moster'' for maternal aunt, and ''faster'' for paternal aunt, but the last two are contractions of '''''mo'''rs sy'''ster'''/sø'''ster''''' and '''''fa'''rs sy'''ster'''/sø'''ster''''' ("mother's sister" and "father's sister", respectively). The same construction is used for uncles (rendering ''morbror'' and ''farbror''). In Danish, and occasionally in Swedish, the word ''onkel'' corresponds to the Danish word ''tante''.

The distinction between maternal and paternal uncles has caused several mistranslations; for example, in [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[DuckTales]]'', Huey, Dewey, and Louie's [[Scrooge McDuck|Uncle Scrooge]] was translated ''Roope-setä'' in Finnish (Paternal Uncle Robert) before it was known Scrooge was Donald's ''maternal'' uncle. The proper translation would have been ''Roope-eno'' (Maternal Uncle Robert). This is also the case for [[Donald Duck]], who is called ''Aku-setä'' in Finnish and not ''Aku-eno'', despite being the brother of Huey, Dewey and Louie's mother. The nephews used to be called ''veljenpojat'' (brother's sons); today they are called [perhaps more fittingly]] ''ankanpojat'' (literally "ducklings").

Arabic contains separate words for "mother's brother" خال (''Khāl'') and "father's brother" عم (''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Amm''). The closest translation into English is "uncle", which gives no indication as to lineage, whether maternal or paternal. Similarly, in Arabic, there are specific words for the father's sister and the mother's sister, خالة (''Khala(h)'') and عمة (''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;Amma(h)''), respectively (in both cases being the feminine forms of the masculine nouns, by addition of [[Arabic diacritics#fatḥa|fatḥa]]-[[tāʾ marbūṭah]]). Bengali has separate words for such relations, too.

Albanian distinguishes maternal and paternal aunts and uncles; paternal uncle and aunt being "ungj/xhaxha" and "hallë" respectively, while maternal uncle and aunt being "dajë" and "teze" respectively.

[[IsiZulu]], spoken in South Africa by the Zulu people, distinguishes between maternal and paternal uncles and aunts. Paternal uncles (father's brothers) are designated as 'fathers' where 'baba omkhulu' (meaning 'great father') designates brothers older than the father, and 'baba omncane' 'meaning 'small father' designates brothers younger than the father. The archaic 'babekazi' meaning 'female father' or the modern 'Anti' borrowed from the English 'Aunt' is used for the father's sisters. Likewise, the mother's sisters are also 'mothers' with the mother's older sisters designated as 'mama omkhulu' (meaning 'great mother') and the mother's younger sisters designated as 'mama omncane' (meaning 'small mother'). The mother's brother is called 'malume'- which is the translation of the usual English uncle and is the one used conventionally as in English- to apply to older family friends, respected older males or male peers of the parents. In Zulu culture, a child of the father's brothers or the mother's sisters is 'brother' (or 'mfowethu') or 'sister' (or 'dadewethu') since their parent is a 'father' or 'mother'. 'Mzala' (cousin) is applied to children of one's mother's brother or father's sister.

=====Nephews, nieces, and cousins=====
Whereas English has different words for the child of one's sibling based on its gender (''nephew'' for the son of one's sibling, ''niece'' for the daughter), the word ''cousin'' applies to both genders of children belonging to one's aunt or uncle. Many languages approach these concepts very differently.

The [[Polish language]] distinguishes a male cousin who is the son of an uncle ("''brat stryjeczny''") and a male cousin who is the son of an aunt ("''brat cioteczny''"); and a female cousin who is the daughter of an uncle ("''siostra stryjeczna''") and a female cousin who is the daughter of an aunt ("''siostra cioteczna''"). Polish distinguishes four kinds of nephew and niece: the son of a brother ("''bratanek''"), the daughter of a brother ("''bratanica''"), the son of a sister ("''siostrzeniec''"), and the daughter of a sister ("''siostrzenica''").

Though [[Italian language|Italian]] distinguishes between male ({{lang|it|cugino}}) and female ({{lang|it|cugina}}) cousins where English does not, it uses {{lang|it|nipote}} (nephew or niece) for both genders, though a masculine or feminine article preceding this can make the distinction. Moreover, this word can also mean ''grandchild'', adding to its ambiguity. However, though the words are the same, the concepts are distinguished, so when hearing about a {{lang|it|nipote}} one is likely to ask whether a child's child or a sibling's child is meant.  To clarify the relationship, Italians generally add the diminutive {{lang|it|ino/a}} when referring to grandchildren {{lang|it|nipotino/a}}.

[[Albanian language|Albanian]] as well has two genders for cousins, male ("kushëri") and female ("kushërirë"). It also distinguishes between nephew ("nip") and niece ("mbesë"), but those words can also mean "grandson" and "granddaughter" respectively.

The [[Macedonian language]] also distinguishes between male ({{lang|mk|братучед}} ({{lang|mk-Latn|bratuched}})) and female ({{lang|mk|братучетка}} ({{lang|mk-Latn|bratuchetka}})) cousins, the son or daughter (respectively) to an aunt or uncle. The [[Bulgarian language]] is similar in this respect, and contains an extensive list of words for referring to family members and relatives, including relations by marriage and acquaintance.

Spanish and Portuguese distinguish in both cases: the son of a sibling is ''sobrino'' or ''sobrinho'', whereas a daughter is ''sobrina'' or ''sobrinha''; likewise a male cousin is ''primo'', while a female cousin is ''prima''. However, when used in the plural, and both genders are involved, only the masculine form is used. If a speaker says that he went out with his cousins (''primos'') last night, it could refer to a group of all men, or of men and women. All women would use the female form. This is a general rule in that the plural male form is used in any group of people that may be of mixed gender, not just cousins.

Norwegian and Danish also distinguish both cases: the son of a sibling is ''nevø'', whereas a daughter is ''niece''; equally a male cousin is ''fætter'', while a female cousin is ''kusine''. Collectively the term ''søskendebarn'' is used for both. Swedish does not distinguish between male and female cousins. For children of siblings, Swedish has three levels of specificity: the term ''syskonbarn'' for all such people regardless of sibling gender and child gender. There is also ''brorsbarn'' or ''systerbarn'' depending on the gender of the sibling whose children it is. Finally, Swedish uses the terms ''brorson'', ''brorsdotter'', ''systerson'', and ''systerdotter''  to exactly describe the relation between the two people referred to. The most specific terms are the most commonly used, with ''brorsbarn'' or ''systerbarn'' usually used when one wants to speak about the children of one sibling as a group.

Dutch, on the other hand, distinguishes gender: {{lang|nl|neef}} (male) and {{lang|nl|nicht}} (female). Nephews and nieces are commonly given a [[diminutive]] form, {{lang|nl|neefje}} and {{lang|nl|nichtje}} respectively (although these can also sometimes refer to younger cousins).

Hindi, Hebrew and Arabic contain no word for "cousin" at all; one must say "uncle's son" or an equivalent.

Cousins from different generations such as "third cousin twice removed" can be readily expressed in English, but many languages do not have equivalently succinct constructs.

=====Relations by marriage=====
There is no standard English word for the Italian "''consuoceri''", Yiddish ''"makhatunim"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=May 6, 2014|accessdate=May 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish "{{lang|es|consuegros}}" or Portuguese "{{lang|pt|consogros}}": a gender-neutral collective plural like "co-in-laws". If Harry marries Sally, then in Yiddish, Harry's father is the ''"mekhutn"'' of Sally's father; each mother is the ''"makheteyneste"'' of the other. In Romanian, they are ''“cuscri”''.  In Bengali, both fathers are ''beayi'' and mothers, ''beyan''. Bengali has ''dada''/''bhai'' for ''brother'' and ''jamai-babu''/''bhagni-pati'' for ''brother-in-law''; ''chhele'' for ''son'' and ''jamai'' for ''son-in-law''.

Spanish and Portuguese contrast "brother" with "brother-in-law" ("{{lang|es|hermano}}/{{lang|pt|irmão}}", "{{lang|es|cuñado}}/{{lang|pt|cunhado}}"); "son" with "son-in-law" ("{{lang|es|hijo}}/{{lang|pt|filho}}", "{{lang|es|yerno}}/{{lang|pt|genro}}"), and similarly for female relatives like "sister-in-law" ("{{lang|es|cuñada}}/{{lang|pt|cunhada}}") and "daughter-in-law" ("{{lang|es|nuera}}/{{lang|pt|nora}}"). Both languages use "{{lang|es|concuño}}" (Sp.) or "{{lang|es|concuñado}}/{{lang|pt|concunhado}}" (varying by dialect), as the relationship between two men that marry siblings (or two women, using the feminine "{{lang|es|concuñada}}/{{lang|pt|concunhada}}" instead). In the English language this relationship would be lumped in with "{{lang|es|cuñado}}/{{lang|pt|cunhado}}" (sibling's husband or spouse's brother) as simply "brother-in-law".

Serbian and Bosnian have specific terms for relations by marriage. For example, a "sister-in-law" can be a ''"snaha/snaja"'' (brother's wife, though also family-member's wife in general), ''"zaova"'' (husband's sister), ''"svastika"'' (wife's sister) or ''"jetrva"'' (husband's brother's wife). A "brother-in-law" can be a ''"zet"'' (sister's husband, or family-member's husband in general), ''"djever/dever"'' (husband's brother), ''"šurak/šurjak"'' (wife's brother) or ''"badžanak/pašenog"'' (wife's sister's husband). Likewise, the term ''"prijatelj"'' (same as ''"makhatunim"'' in Yiddish, which also translates as ''"friend"'') is also used. Bengali has a number of in-law words. For example, ''Boudi'' (elder brother's wife), ''Shaali'' (wife's sister), ''Shaala'' (wife's younger brother), ''Sambandhi'' (wife's elder brother/Shaali's husband), ''Bhaasur'' (husband's elder brother), ''Deor'' (husband's younger brother) ''Nanad'' (husband's sister), ''Jaa'' (husband's brother's wife), etc.

In Russian, fifteen different words cover relations by marriage, enough to confuse many native speakers. There are for example, as in Yiddish, words like "{{lang|ru|сват}}" and "{{lang|ru|сватья}}" for "co-in-laws". To further complicate the translator's job, Russian in-laws may choose to address each other familiarly by these titles.

In contrast to all of the above fine distinctions, in American English the term "my brother-in-law" covers "my spouse's brother", "my sibling's husband", and "my spouse's sibling's husband". In British English, the last of these is not considered strictly correct. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

=====Relations by work=====

Japanese has a concept, ''[[The Anatomy of Dependence|amae]]'', about the closeness of parent-child relationship, that is supposedly unique to that language and culture as it applies to bosses and workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Electronic Journal of Sociology |year=2000 |url=http://www.sociology.org/content/vol005.001/smith-nomi.html |title=Is ''amae'' the Key to Understanding Japanese Culture? |author=Herman W Smith &amp; Takako Nomi |access-date=2014-05-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220062826/http://www.sociology.org/content/vol005.001/smith-nomi.html |archive-date=2014-02-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foreign objects====
Objects unknown to a culture can actually be easy to translate. For example, in Japanese, ''[[wasabi]]'' {{lang|ja|わさび}} is a [[plant]] (''[[Wasabia japonica]]'') used as a spicy [[Japan]]ese [[condiment]]. Traditionally, this plant only grows in Japan. It would be unlikely that someone from Angola (for example) would have a clear understanding of it. However, the easiest way to translate this word is to ''borrow'' it. Or one can use a similar [[list of vegetables|vegetable's name]] to describe it. In English this word is translated as ''[[wasabi]]'' or ''Japanese [[horseradish]]''. In Chinese, people can still call it ''wasabi'' by its Japanese sound, or pronounce it by its [[Hanzi]] characters, {{lang|zh|山葵}} ([[pinyin]]: ''shān kuí''). However, wasabi is currently called 芥末 (jiè mò) or 绿芥 (lǜ jiè) in China and Taiwan. Horseradish is not usually seen in [[Eastern Asia]]; people may parallel it with [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]]. Hence, in some places, ''yellow mustard'' refers to imported mustard sauce; ''green mustard'' refers to wasabi.

Another method is using description instead of a single word. For example, languages like Russian and Ukrainian have borrowed words ''Kuraga'' and ''Uruk'' from Turkic languages. While both fruits are now known to the Western world, there are still no terms for them in English. English speakers have to use "dried [[apricot]] without core" and "dried apricot with core" instead.

One particular type of foreign object that poses difficulties is the proper noun. As an illustration, consider another example from [[Douglas Hofstadter]], which he published in one of his "[[Metamagical Themas]]" columns in ''[[Scientific American]]''. He pondered the question, ''Who is the first lady of Britain?'' Well, first ladies reside at the Prime Minister's address, and at the time, the woman living at 10 Downing Street was [[Margaret Thatcher]]. But a different attribute that first ladies have is that they are married to heads of government, so perhaps a better answer was [[Denis Thatcher|''Denis'' Thatcher]], but he probably would not have relished the title.

===Poetry, puns and wordplay===
The two areas which most nearly approach total untranslatability are [[poetry]] and [[pun]]s; poetry is difficult to translate because of its reliance on the sounds (for example, [[rhyme]]s) and rhythms of the source language; puns, and other similar [[semantics|semantic]] wordplay, because of how tightly they are tied to the original language. The oldest well-known examples are probably those appearing in Bible translations, for example, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2:7, which explains why God gave [[Adam]] this name: "God created Adam out of soil from the ground"; the original Hebrew text reveals the secret, since the word '''Adam''' connotes the word '''ground''' (being ''Adama'' in Hebrew), whereas translating the verse into other languages loses the original pun.

Similarly, consider the Italian adage "''traduttore, traditore''": a literal translation is "translator, traitor". The pun is lost, though the meaning persists. (A similar solution can be given, however, in Hungarian, by saying ''a fordítás: ferdítés'', which roughly translates as "translation is distortion".)

That being said, many of the translation procedures discussed here can be used in these cases. For example, the translator can compensate for an "untranslatable" pun in one part of a text by adding a new pun in another part of the translated text.

[[Oscar Wilde]]'s play ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]'' incorporates in its title a pun (resonating in the last line of the play) that conflates the name Ernest with the adjective of quality ''earnest''. The French title of the translated play is ''"L'importance d'être Constant"'', replicating and transposing the pun; however, the character Ernest had to be renamed, and the allusion to trickery was lost. (Other French translations include ''"De l'importance d'être Fidèle"'' (faithful) and ''"Il est important d'être Aimé"'' (loved), with the same idea of a pun on first name / quality adjective.) A recent Hungarian translation of the same play by [[Ádám Nádasdy]] applied a similar solution, giving the subtitle ''"Szilárdnak kell lenni"'' (lit. "One must be Szilárd") beside the traditional title "Bunbury", where ''"Szilárd"'' is a male name as well as an adjective meaning "solid, firm", or "steady". Other languages, like Spanish, usually leave the pun untranslated, as in "La importancia de llamarse Ernesto", while one translation used the name Severo, which means "severe" or "serious", close to the original English meaning. Catalan translations always use "La importància de ser Frank". This example uses the homophones "Frank" (given name) and "franc" (honest, free-spoken). Although this same solution would work in Spanish also ("La importancia de ser Franco"), it carries heavy political connotations in [[Spain]] due to [[Francisco Franco]]'s dictatorship (1939–1975), to a point that even this possible title can be taken directly as ironic/sarcastic: literally, "The importance of being Franco", so this alternative was never used.

The [[Asterix]] comic strip is renowned for its French puns; its translators have found many [[English translations of Asterix#Lost in translation|ingenious English substitutes]].

Other forms of wordplay, such as [[spoonerism]]s and [[palindrome]]s are equally difficult, and often force hard choices on the translator. For example, take the classic palindrome: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama". A translator might choose to translate it literally into, say, French – "''Un homme, un projet, un canal: Panama''", if it were used as a caption for a photo of [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (the chief instigator of the Canal), and sacrifice the palindrome. But if the text is meant to give an ''example'' of a palindrome, he might elect to sacrifice the literal sense and substitute a French palindrome, such as "''Un roc lamina l'animal cornu''" ('A boulder swept away the horned animal').

[[Douglas Hofstadter]] discusses the problem of translating a palindrome into Chinese, where such wordplay is theoretically impossible, in his book {{lang|fr|[[Le Ton beau de Marot]]}}&lt;ref name="palindrome"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas |authorlink= Douglas Hofstadter |editor= |others= |title=Le Ton beau de Marot |edition=First|year=1997|publisher=Basic Books |isbn= 0-465-08645-4|pages=143–144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – which is devoted to the issues and problems of translation, with particular emphasis on the translation of poetry. Another example given by Hofstadter is the translation of the [[jabberwocky]] poem by [[Lewis Carroll]], with its wealth of [[neologism]]s and [[portmanteau]] words, into a number of foreign tongues.&lt;ref name="jabberwocky"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hofstadter |first=Douglas |authorlink= Douglas Hofstadter |editor= |others= |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |edition=Vintage Books |year=1989|publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=0-394-75682-7 |pages=366–368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable [[Irish joke]] is that it is not possible to translate [[:wikt:mañana|mañana]] into [[Irish language|Irish]] as the Irish "don't have a word that conveys that degree of urgency".

===Iconicity===
According to Ghil'ad Zuckermann, "iconicity might be the reason for refraining from translating ''Hallelujah'' and ''Amen'' in so many languages, as if the sounds of such basic religious notions have to do with their [[referent]]s themselves – as if by losing the sound, one might lose the meaning. Compare this to the cabbalistic power of letters, for example in the case of [[gematria]], the method of interpreting the Hebrew Scriptures by interchanging words whose letters have the same numerical value when added. A simple example of [[gematria|gematric]] power might be the famous proverb {{lang|he|נכנס יין יצא סוד|rtl=yes}} ''nikhnas yayin yåSå sōd'', lit. "entered wine went out secret", i.e. "wine brings out the truth", ''[[in vino veritas]]''. The gematric value of {{lang|he|יין|rtl=yes}} "wine" is 70 (י=10; י=10; ן=50) and this is also the gematric value of {{lang|he|סוד|rtl=yes}} "secret" (ס=60; ו=6; ד=4). Thus, this sentence, according to many Jews at the time, had to be true."&lt;ref&gt;See p. 246 of Ghil'ad Zuckermann (2006), "'[[false etymology|Etymythological]] [[Othering]]' and the Power of "Lexical Engineering" in Judaism, Islam and Christianity. A Socio-Philo(sopho)logical Perspective", ''Explorations in the Sociology of Language and Religion'', edited by [[Tope Omoniyi]] and [[Joshua A. Fishman]], Amsterdam: John Benjamins, pp. 237-258.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vjetrenica''' ({{IPA-sh|ʋjɛtrɛ̌nitsa|pron}}, which means "wind cave" or "blowhole") is the largest and most important [[cave]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and one of the most important caves in the [[Dinaric Alps]] mountain range, which is famous worldwide for its karstic and speleological riches. It is located in the [[Popovo field]] in [[Ravno]], [[East Herzegovina]] in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

==Geography==
[[File:Popovo Polje.JPG|left|thumb|Popovo Polje, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].]]

===Popovo Polje and cave location===

Vjetrenica is located in [[Popovo Polje]] (pronounced {{IPA-sh|pɔ̌pɔʋɔ pɔ̂ʎɛ|}}, meaning ''priest's field'', where [[polje]] stands for [[karstic]] plain), which is itself located in a southernmost regions of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[West Herzegovina]], near the [[Adriatic]] coast. 
Its entrance is near the [[village]] of [[Zavala, Bosnia-Herzegovina|Zavala]], in west - south-western corner of polje. In the warmer parts of the year a strong blast of cold air blows from its entrance, which is very attractive in the middle of the rocky, hot and waterless terrain.

Popovo Polje is one of the largest polje (karstic plain) in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the world, famous for its [[karstic]] phenomenons and features, and particularly for its [[Trebišnjica River]], which flows through the polje as largest [[sinking river]] (also ''losing stream'', or ''influent stream'') the world, as well as the Vjetrenica cave system, located to the west/south-western parts of the valley. 

The cave has been explored and described to a total of 7,014 m in length; of this the main channel is about 2.47&amp;nbsp;km long. It runs from the edge of [[Popovo Polje]] to the south, and on the basis of analysis of the terrain, [[geologist]]s have predicted that Vjetrenica could stretch right to the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the [[Republic of Croatia]], 15–20&amp;nbsp;km away from its entrance. Along with the [[hydrological]] arguments, this assumption is also supported by the "unnatural" end of Vjetrenica in the form of a huge heap of stone blocks that have caved in.

Vjetrenica is the richest cave in the world in terms of subterranean biodiversity: among more than two hundred different species are registered in it, almost hundred are [[troglophile]]s, a great number of them are narrow endemic, 15 are stenoendemic, and about 37 were discovered and described in Vjetrenica for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vjetrenica (official page)|url=http://www.vjetrenica.com/|publisher=vjetrenica.com/|accessdate=4 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710194225/http://www.vjetrenica.com/|archive-date=10 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural and architectural assemble==

===Zavala Village===
Located in Popovo Polje in [[Ravno]] municipality, village [[Zavala, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Zavala]] with its old architecture and stone masonry, together with Vjetrenica cave, constitute the natural and architectural ensemble, which is in the process of being protected as ''National Monument of Bosnia and Herzegovina'', and as such it is already placed on [[List of World Heritage Sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina|UNESCO Tentative List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zavala graditeljska cjelina|url=http://kons.gov.ba/main.php?mod=spomenici&amp;extra=Odluke&amp;action=view&amp;lang=1&amp;id=1820|publisher=Commission to preserve national monuments|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pećina Vjetrenica u Zavali|url=http://kons.gov.ba/main.php?mod=spomenici&amp;extra=Peticije&amp;action=view&amp;lang=1&amp;id=3484|publisher=Commission to preserve national monuments|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vjetrenica cave is considered to have richest cave fauna, with highest rate of endemism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vjetrenica (official page)|url=http://www.vjetrenica.com/|publisher=vjetrenica.com/|accessdate=4 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710194225/http://www.vjetrenica.com/|archive-date=10 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Vjetrenica cave also acquired fame throughout the world geological and biological scientific communities, as well as environmental communities around the country and the world for its imperiled and uncertain future, caused by unprofessional management lacking any expertise, and uncertain status at state and especially local level.

===UNESCO nomination===
Despite all setbacks government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, although creepingly slowly, nominated [[List of World Heritage Sites in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Vjeternica (with village Zavala) to UNESCO Tentative List]] clearly expressing intention to protect the cave and its biodiversity and eventually inscribe it with UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vjetrenica Cave (Tentative List)|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1975/|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vjetrenica (official page)|url=http://www.vjetrenica.com/|publisher=vjetrenica.com/|accessdate=4 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710194225/http://www.vjetrenica.com/|archive-date=10 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
