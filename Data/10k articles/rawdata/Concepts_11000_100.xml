An '''abstract structure''' is a [[formal object]] that is defined by a set of laws, properties and relationships in a way that is logically if not always historically independent of the structure of contingent experiences, for example, those involving physical objects.  Abstract structures are studied not only in [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] but in the fields that apply them, as [[computer science]], and in the studies that reflect on them, such as [[philosophy]] (especially the [[philosophy of mathematics]]).  Indeed, modern mathematics has been defined in a very general sense as the study of abstract structures (by the [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] group: see discussion there, at [[algebraic structure]] and also [[structure (category theory)|structure]]).

An abstract structure may be represented (perhaps with some degree of approximation) by one or more physical objects{{snd}} this is called an implementation or [[Instantiation principle|instantiation]] of the abstract structure. But the abstract structure itself is defined in a way that is not dependent on the properties of any particular implementation.

An abstract structure has a richer structure than a [[concept]] or an [[idea]]. An abstract structure must include precise rules of behaviour which can be used to determine whether a candidate implementation actually matches the abstract structure in question. Thus we may debate how well a particular government fits the concept of [[democracy]], but there is no room for debate over whether a given sequence of moves is or is not a valid game of chess.   

==Examples==   
* A [[sorting algorithm]] is an abstract structure, but a [[recipe]] is not, because it depends on the properties and quantities of its ingredients.
* A simple [[melody]] is an abstract structure, but an [[orchestration]] is not, because it depends on the properties of particular instruments.
* [[Euclidean geometry]] is an abstract structure, but the theory of [[continental drift]] is not, because it depends on the geology of the [[Earth]].
* A [[formal language]] is an abstract structure, but a [[natural language]] is not, because its rules of grammar and syntax are open to debate and interpretation.

An '''additive group''' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] of which the group operation is to be thought of as ''addition'' in some sense.  It is usually [[abelian group|abelian]], and typically written using the symbol '''+''' for its binary operation.

This terminology is widely used with structures equipped with several operations for specifying the structure obtained by forgetting the other operations. Examples include the ''additive group''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=N. |last=Bourbaki |title=Algebra I: Chapters 1–3 |chapter=§8.1 Rings |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=STS9aZ6F204C&amp;pg=PA97 |year=1998 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-540-64243-5 |page=97 |origyear=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[integers]], of a [[vector space]] and of a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. This is particularly useful with rings and [[field (mathematics)|fields]] to distinguish the additive underlying group from the [[multiplicative group]] of the [[unit (ring theory)|invertible element]]s.

==Mathematics==
[[File:Euclidian and non euclidian geometry.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Three examples of different geometries:  [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]], [[elliptical geometry|elliptical]], and [[hyperbolic geometry]]]]

In [[mathematics]], especially in [[geometry]] and [[topology]], an ''ambient space'' is the space surrounding a [[mathematical object]].  For example, a [[line (mathematics)|line]] may be studied in isolation, or it may be studied as an object in [[two-dimensional]] space—in which case the ambient space is the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]], or as an object in [[three-dimensional space]]—in which case the ambient space is three-dimensional.  To see why this makes a difference, consider the statement "Lines that never meet are necessarily [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]]."  This is true if the ambient space is two-dimensional, but false if the ambient space is three-dimensional, because in the latter case the lines could be [[skew lines]], rather than parallel.

A '''''Beerwolf''''' ('''''Bärwolf''''', '''''Werwolf''''') is a German folk-tale monster&lt;ref&gt;''The European Reformation'', Euan Cameron, p 354&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known as a [[werewolf]].

Beerwolf is a concept introduced by [[Martin Luther]] (in a 1539 debate) that Luther uses to describe the [[Pope]] and [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. In the context of [[resistance theory]], a "Beerwolf", "in contrast to a mere tyrant, not only broke the law, but overturned the entire moral order upon which it is based. All the subjects of such a ruler ... had the right to resist and even to kill him and all his supporters".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cynthia Grant Schonberger|title=Luther and the Justification of Resistance to Legitimate Authority|journal=[[Journal of the History of Ideas]]|volume=40|issue=1|pages=3&amp;ndash;20|doi=10.2307/2709257|date=January–March 1979|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|jstor=2709257}}; as specified in Luther's Collected Works, 39(ii) 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of the term lies in the fact that, for most of his life, Luther held that no subject could actively resist his secular ruler, an issue of obvious significance in a time when many rulers in the German lands and their respective subjects held competing religious beliefs. The concept of ''Beerwolf'' marked Luther's final, and most extreme, position on resistance theory, as it relied on [[natural law]] (specifically, what would later come to be called [[Hobbes]]' right to self-preservation) instead of earlier and more limited rights to resistance that Luther had accepted as flowing from German constitutional law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robert V. Friedeburg|title=In Defense of Patria: Resisting Magistrates and the Duties of Patriots in the Empire from the 1530s to the 1640s|journal=[[Sixteenth Century Journal]]|volume=32|issue=2|pages=257&amp;ndash;382|doi=|date=Summer 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of just rebellion that the term ''Beerwolf'' introduced was subsequently developed by fellow Protestants who faced a similar situation in France, the Huguenot [[Monarchomachs]].

The '''capstan equation''' or '''belt friction equation''', also known as '''Eytelwein's formula''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atp.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/rt1/currentcourse/node57.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jrre.org/att_frict.pdf{{Dead link |date=August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; relates the hold-force to the load-force if a flexible line is wound around a cylinder (a [[bollard]], a [[winch]] or a [[Capstan (nautical)|capstan]]).&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = K.L. | title = Contact Mechanics | url = http://www.knovel.com/web/portal/browse/display?_EXT_KNOVEL_DISPLAY_bookid=2685 | format = PDF | accessdate = February 14, 2011 | year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the interaction of frictional forces and tension, the tension on a line wrapped around a capstan may be different on either side of the capstan.  A small ''holding'' force exerted on one side can carry a much larger ''loading'' force on the other side; this is the principle by which a capstan-type device operates.

A holding capstan is a ratchet device that can turn only in one direction; once a load is pulled into place in that direction, it can be held with a much smaller force.  A powered capstan, also called a winch, rotates so that the applied tension is multiplied by the friction between rope and capstan.  On a [[tall ship]] a holding capstan and a powered capstan are used in tandem so that a small force can be used to raise a heavy sail and then the rope can be easily removed from the powered capstan and tied off.

In [[rock climbing]] with so-called [[top-roping]], a lighter person can hold (belay) a heavier person due to this effect.

The formula is
:&lt;math&gt;T_\text{load} = T_\text{hold}\   e^{  \mu \phi} ~,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;T_\text{load}&lt;/math&gt; is the applied tension on the line, &lt;math&gt;T_\text{hold}&lt;/math&gt; is the resulting force exerted at the other side of the capstan, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coefficient of friction]] between the rope and capstan materials, and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the total angle swept by all turns of the rope, measured in radians (i.e., with one full turn the angle &lt;math&gt;\phi =2\pi\,&lt;/math&gt;).

Several assumptions must be true for the formula to be valid:
# The rope is on the verge of full sliding, i.e. &lt;math&gt;T_\text{load}&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum load that one can hold. Smaller loads can be held as well, resulting in a smaller ''effective'' contact angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.
# It is important that the line is not rigid, in which case significant force would be lost in the bending of the line tightly around the cylinder. (The equation must be modified for this case.) For instance a [[Bowden cable]] is to some extent rigid and doesn't obey the principles of the Capstan equation.
# The line is non-[[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]].

It can be observed that the force gain increases [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] with the coefficient of friction, the number of turns around the cylinder, and the angle of contact. Note that ''the radius of the cylinder has no influence on the force gain''.

The table below lists values of the factor &lt;math&gt;e^{  \mu \phi} \,&lt;/math&gt; based on the number of turns and coefficient of friction ''μ''.

From the table it is evident why one seldom sees a [[sheet (sailing)|sheet]] (a rope to the loose side of a sail) wound more than three turns around a winch. The force gain would be extreme besides being counter-productive since there is risk of a [[riding turn]], result being that the sheet will foul, form a knot and not run out when [[eased]] (by slacking grip on the [[tail]] (free end)).

It is both ancient and modern practice for anchor capstans and jib winches to be slightly flared out at the base, rather than cylindrical, to prevent the rope ([[Anchor#Anchor Warps|anchor warp]] or sail sheet) from sliding down. The rope wound several times around the winch can slip upwards gradually, with little risk of a riding turn, provided it is [[tailed]] (loose end is pulled clear), by hand or a self-tailer.

For instance, the factor "153,552,935" (5 turns around a capstan with a coefficient of friction of 0.6) means, in theory, that a newborn baby would be capable of holding (not moving) the weight of two {{USS|Nimitz|CVN-68|6}} supercarriers (97,000 tons each, but for the baby it would be only a little more than 1&amp;nbsp;kg).  The large number of turns around the capstan combined with such a high friction coefficient mean that very little additional force is necessary to hold such heavy weight in place.  The cables necessary to support this weight, as well as the capstan's ability to withstand the crushing force of those cables, are separate considerations.

== Derivation of the capstan equation ==
[[File:Capstan force diagram 4.jpg|thumb|right| Forces between a rope and capstan]]

The first step is to relate the radial or normal force &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt;(Newtons/radian) at any point of the rope wrapped around a capstan to the tension &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt;(Newtons) in the rope as shown in the figure.  The y axis component of the upward force of the capstan on the rope, &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt;, must equal the Y axis downward component of the tension in the rope, &lt;math&gt; T_\text{hold} \sin(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; F  = T_\text{hold} \sin (\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit as &lt;math&gt; \varphi&lt;/math&gt; goes to zero (the [[small-angle approximation]]), &lt;math&gt; \sin(d\varphi)= d\varphi &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_\text{hold} = T_\text{load}  = T &lt;/math&gt; 

&lt;math&gt; F=T d\varphi &lt;/math&gt;

So the frictional force over a wrap angle &lt;math&gt; d\varphi &lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt; \mu {F}  = \mu {T} d\varphi  &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient of friction (nonslip).

The increase in rope tension &lt;math&gt; dT &lt;/math&gt; over a wrap angle &lt;math&gt; d\varphi &lt;/math&gt; is the frictional force over that angle so

:&lt;math&gt;   dT=\mu {T} d\varphi   &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;   \frac{1}{T}dT=\mu d\varphi   &lt;/math&gt;

Integration of both sides yields

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{T_\text{hold}}^{T_\text{load}} \frac{1}{T} \;{dT} = \int_0^\phi \mu \; {d}\varphi&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\ln T_\text{load} - \ln T_\text{hold} = \ln\frac{T_\text{load}}{T_\text{hold}} = \mu \phi&lt;/math&gt;

and exponentiating both sides,

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{T_\text{load}}{T_\text{hold}}={e}^{\mu \phi}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally,

: &lt;math&gt; T_\text{load} = T_\text{hold}{e}^{\mu \phi} &lt;/math&gt;

== Generalization of the Capstan equation for a V-belt ==

The belt friction equation for a v-belt is:

: &lt;math&gt; T_\text{load} = T_\text{hold}{e}^{\mu \phi / \sin( \alpha / 2 )} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the angle (in radians) between the two flat sides of the pulley that the v-belt presses against.&lt;ref name="moradmand"/&gt; A flat belt has an effective angle of &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \pi&lt;/math&gt;.

The material of a [[v-belt]] or multi-v [[serpentine belt]] tends to wedge into the mating groove in a pulley as the load increases, improving torque transmission.&lt;ref&gt;

page 5-9.
&lt;/ref&gt;

For the same power transmission, a V-belt requires less tension than a flat belt, increasing bearing life.&lt;ref name="moradmand"&gt;

== Generalization of the Capstan equation for a rope lying on an arbitrary orthotropic surface ==
If a rope is lying in equilibrium under tangential forces on a rough orthotropic surface then all three following conditions are satisfied:

1. No separation – normal reaction &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is positive for all points of the rope curve:

&lt;math&gt;N=-k_nT&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_n&lt;/math&gt; is a normal curvature of the rope curve.

2. Dragging coefficient of friction &lt;math&gt;\mu_g&lt;/math&gt; and angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are satisfying the following criteria for all points of the curve

&lt;math&gt;-\mu_g&lt;\tan \alpha &lt;+\mu_g&lt;/math&gt;

3. Limit values of the tangential forces:

The forces at both ends of the rope &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; are satisfying the following inequality

&lt;math&gt;T_0 e^{-\int_s \omega ds}\le T \le T_0 e^{\int_s \omega ds}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\omega = \mu_\tau \sqrt{ k_n^2 - \frac{k_g^2}{\mu_g^2}}=\mu_\tau k \sqrt{ \cos^2 \alpha - \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\mu_g^2}}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;k_g&lt;/math&gt;is a [[geodesic curvature]] of the rope curve, &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a curvature of a rope curve, &lt;math&gt;\mu_\tau&lt;/math&gt;is a coefficient of friction in the tangential direction.

If &lt;math&gt;\omega = const&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;T_0 e^{-\mu_\tau k s \, \sqrt{ \cos^2 \alpha - \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\mu_g^2}}}\le T \le T_0 e^{\mu_\tau k s \, \sqrt{ \cos^2 \alpha - \frac{\sin^2 \alpha}{\mu_g^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;.

This generalization has been obtained by Konyukhov A.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Konyukhov|first=Alexander|date=2015-04-01|title=Contact of ropes and orthotropic rough surfaces|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zamm.201300129/abstract|journal=Journal of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics|language=en|volume=95|issue=4|pages=406–423|doi=10.1002/zamm.201300129|issn=1521-4001|bibcode = 2015ZaMM...95..406K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-111877065X,subjectCd-MA80.html|title=Introduction to Computational Contact Mechanics: A Geometrical Approach|last=Konyukhov A., Izi R.|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Wiley|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1208">The '''Markov condition''', sometimes called the '''Markov assumption''', for a [[Bayesian network]] states that every node in a Bayesian network is [[conditionally independent]] of its nondescendents, given its parents.

A node is conditionally independent of the entire network, given its [[Markov blanket]].

The related '''causal Markov condition''' is that a is independent of its noneffects, given its direct causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hausman |first1=D.M. |last2=Woodward |first2=J. |title=Independence, Invariance, and the Causal Markov Condition |journal=British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=521–583 |date=December 1999 |doi= 10.1093/bjps/50.4.521|url=http://philosophy.wisc.edu/hausman/papers/bjps.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event that the structure of a Bayesian network accurately depicts [[causality]], the two conditions are equivalent. However, a network may accurately embody the Markov condition without depicting causality, in which case it should not be assumed to embody the causal Markov condition.

The '''charitable activities of the Knights of Columbus''' include the money and time donated by the Order of the [[Knights of Columbus]], state and local councils, and individual members, to charitable causes.

Charity is the foremost principle of the Knights of Columbus. According to one commentator, "there is hardly a corner of the Catholic world where the resources of this international force have not left an impression."&lt;ref name=financial/&gt;  This has allowed the Knights and its high-ranking officers to "become powerful and influential in ways unimaginable in 1882&amp;nbsp;... and no other lay group can match the Knights' ability to leave its mark on the church."&lt;ref name=financial/&gt;

In 2017, the order gave more than $185&amp;nbsp;million directly to charity and performed over 75.6&amp;nbsp;million man hours in volunteer service.&lt;ref name=annual18/&gt; According to [[Independent Sector]], this service has a value of more than $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion. The total charitable contributions from the decade ending December 31, 2015 rose to $15&amp;nbsp;billion. On average in 2015, each Knight of Columbus contributed 38 hours of community service.&lt;ref name="kofc.org"/&gt; Much of the financial effort went to initiatives of the Vatican and the US bishops.&lt;ref name=financial/&gt;

United in Charity, a general, unrestricted [[endowment fund]], was introduced at the 2004 Supreme Council meeting to support and ensure the overall long-term charitable and philanthropic goals of the order. The fund is wholly managed, maintained, and operated by Knights of Columbus Charities, Inc., a [[501(c)(8)]] charitable organization.&lt;ref name=uic/&gt; Before United in Charity was formed, all requests for funds were met with the general funds of the order or in combination with specific appeals.&lt;ref name="united"/&gt;

==People in need==
In 2017, local councils donated more than 105,000 winter coats for children.&lt;ref name=annual18/&gt;  This was up from 80,500 coats in 2012.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt;  Also in 2017, Knights donated four million pounds of food, and $2 million towards feeding the hungry.&lt;ref name=annual18/&gt;

More than $1.2&amp;nbsp;million was donated to [[Habitat for Humanity]] in 2013, in addition to 1.4&amp;nbsp;million volunteer hours.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt;  The very first ever national blood drive was sponsored by the order in 1938.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt;{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=349}}  In 2013, council blood drives attracted more than 423,000 donors.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt;

===Early efforts===
During the mid-1890s, the United States was in the middle of a [[Panic of 1893|serious economic depression]]. The order was thriving, however, and at the 1897 convention Supreme Knight [[John J. Phelan]] spoke of the need to assist fellow knights who were in distress.  The Supreme Council then adopted charitable funds within local councils "for the purposes of retaining their worthy members in good standing who are in need and in distress [and] who are absent from home."{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=127}}

During the early 20th century, local councils often functioned as social welfare agencies.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=166}}  Local councils, acting alone and sometimes joining forces, established unemployment bureaus to find jobs for men and women, members and non-members alike.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=166–167}}  They "were also dedicated to education, to relief for the poor and sick, and to a variety of charitable causes.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=167}}

===Great Depression===
[[File:Hhoover.jpeg|thumb|Herbert Hoover appointed Supreme Knight Martin Carmody to the President's Organization for Unemployment Relief.]]

When Supreme Knight [[Martin Carmody]] assumed office in 1927, on the eve of the [[Great Depression in the United States]], he urged knights to cherish the virtue of charity.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=319}} "The [[Holy Grail]] may be sought over land and sea in many climes without avail," Carmody said, "and may be found in the cup of cold water extended to the thirsty at our doorstep."{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=319}}

When President Herbert Hoover established the [[President's Organization for Unemployment Relief]] in 1931, Carmody wrote to Hoover pledging the services of the Order.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=320}} Carmody had already encouraged the 2,600 councils to have "strong and active employment committees."{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=320}} Some, such as the 20 councils in Saint Louis, joined together to establish full time employment agencies throughout the 1920s.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=320}}

The Order also established a Bureau of Employment at their headquarters in New Haven to coordinate efforts among councils.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=320}}  Peter Collins, who ran the effort for returning servicemen after [[World War I]], ran the new Bureau.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=320}}  By the end of July 1931, a total a 43,128 unemployed people had been placed into jobs, in addition to those placements made by local councils who were working under the auspices of other organizations.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=320}} In less than two years, the Order would provide more than 100,000 jobs.&lt;ref name=columbia/&gt;  In October of that year, Hoover appointed Carmody to the Organization.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=321}}

===Persons with disabilities===
The Knights have a tradition of supporting those with physical and [[developmental disabilities]]. More than $382&amp;nbsp;million has been given over the past three decades to groups and programs that support the intellectually and physically disabled,&lt;ref name=Annual2006/&gt; with $4.1&amp;nbsp;million donated in 2012 alone.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt;  Former Supreme Chaplain [[Charles P. Greco]] is largely responsible for the Knights' interest in this area.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=429}}

One of the largest recipients of funds in this area is the [[Special Olympics]].&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt;  In 2012, there were more than 107,000 Knights who donated 315,000 hours of service at nearly 20,000 Special Olympics events.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt;  Individual councils donated $3.7&amp;nbsp;million to the Special Olympics in 2013.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt;  The order's support for the Special Olympics goes back to the very first games in 1968.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt;  In 2017, nearly $6 million was donated along with more than 350,000 volunteer hours from 76,000 knights to the Special Olympics and other programs for people with intellectual disabilities.&lt;ref name=annual18/&gt;

In 2012, more than 5,000 wheelchairs were distributed in 10 countries in a partnership with the [[Global Wheelchair Mission]].&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt;  In 2017, local councils donated 7,649 wheelchairs.&lt;ref name=annual18/&gt;

===Disaster relief===
In 2017, more than $4.2 million was raised for disaster relief.&lt;ref name=annual18/&gt;  Giving to those in need of natural disasters dates back to the earliest days of the order.  After a flood in Kansas in 1903, the order raised $5,000 to be distributed to parishes and local councils, and it collected over $100,000 after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=161}}  In 1927, the order gave $50,000 for flood relief.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=320}}

The Knights of Columbus also gave significant charitable contributions to the people of Haiti in the aftermath of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|devastating earthquake]] in January 2010. The order also donated 1,000 wheelchairs to the people of Haiti in partnership with the Global Wheelchair Mission.&lt;ref name="haiti"/&gt; Recognizing that the need was still great in Haiti some seven months after the disaster, the Knights of Columbus partnered with Project Medishare in August 2010 for an initiative entitled, "Healing Haiti's Children." The initiative, backed by a more than $2.5&amp;nbsp;million commitment from the Knights of Columbus provides free prosthetic limbs and a minimum of two years of rehab to every child who suffered an amputation from injuries sustained during the earthquake.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt;&lt;ref name="medishare"/&gt;  {{As of|2013}}, more than 800 children had already been aided by the program.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt;

After the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]], a local council in Newtown, Connecticut, established a program asking people to pray a minimum of three [[Hail Mary]]s for the victims and their families. Over 100,000 people pledged to say 3.25&amp;nbsp;million prayers.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt;

More than $500,000 was donated to [[Hurricane Sandy]] relief efforts, and $202,000 to victims of the [[Tornado outbreak of April 13–16, 2012|April 2012 tornadoes]] in Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt;  After [[West Fertilizer Company explosion]] in Texas, nearly a quarter of a million dollars were raised.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt; In total, more than $3.3&amp;nbsp;million were donated by individual councils for disaster relief in 2012.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt;  In 2015, the order donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to vicitims of typhoons and other natural disasters.&lt;ref name=financial/&gt;  A donation drive was undertaken following 2018's [[Hurricane Florence]].&lt;ref name=florence/&gt;

===Persecuted Christians===
{{See also|Persecution of Christians in the modern era#Middle East|Political activity of the Knights of Columbus#Refugees}}

Between 2014 and 2018, the Knights gave more than $20 million to provide food, shelter, clothing, and medical care to persecuted Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=annual18/&gt;&lt;ref name=stand/&gt;&lt;ref name=ceo/&gt;&lt;ref name=financial/&gt;  The order has helped Christians return to their homes in the [[Nineveh Plains]] region of Iraq.&lt;ref name=stand/&gt;  For those unable to return to their homes, the orderd is building McGivney House, an apartment building in [[Erbil]], [[Iraq]] with 140 units for [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac]] and [[Chaldean Catholic Church|Chaldean]] Christian families.&lt;ref name=annual18/&gt;  Special units in the building are designed for elderly residents who left without care during the [[Iraqi Civil War (2014–2017)|conflict in Iraq]] with the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]].&lt;ref name=home/&gt;  IN addition to giving residents a dignified place to live, the house has a chapel on site and is close to a new Catholic church.&lt;ref name=home/&gt;

Archbishop [[Bashar Matti Warda]] said of the Knights' efforts:

{{quote|After the Daesh (ISIS) invasion, more than 125,000 Christians and others fled Mosul and the Nineveh Plain [to Iraqi Kurdistan] — crying with no one to help, except for the Church. Neither the U.N. nor the Iraqi government was taking care of these displaced people. Then, the Knights came and worked closely with us to help ease the suffering of those displaced families — and not just Christians but Yazidis, everyone — by providing them with food, medicine, shelter.

The Knights said, “We are with you. We will stand with you. We’ll support you. We will be in this together.” That gave great hope to the Christian community. And that’s why today we have so many families returning to their liberated villages.&lt;Ref name=stand/&gt;}}

At a Solidarity Dinner for the Washington-based group [[In Defense of Christians]], Vice President [[Mike Pence]] singled out the order for their "extraordinary work caring for the persecuted around the world."&lt;ref name=praises/&gt;  Between 2014 and 2017, the Knights of Columbus Christian Refugee Relief Fund gave over $17 million for humanitarian relief work in the area.&lt;ref name=praises/&gt; That includes $2 million to rebuild the primarily Christian town of [[Karamles]] in Iraq.&lt;ref name=praises/&gt;  

At the end of 2017, the Knights and the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] recognized a "Week of Awareness" for persecuted Christians.&lt;ref name=praises/&gt;  In 2018, a national awareness campaign was launched by the Knights to bring greater public awareness to the plight of Christians in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=annual18/&gt;  In 2017, the Knights praised the decision of the US government to provide direct US aid to persecuted Christians in the Middle East who were suffering at the hands of the Islamic State.&lt;ref name=praises/&gt; They also led the effort to get the [[United States Department of State]] to declare the atrocities a genocide.&lt;ref name=aid/&gt;

==Global Catholic donations==
In 1979, each Knight was assessed a 50 cent per capita tax to establish a $500,000 Luke E. Hart Memorial Fund for the "purposes of promoting increased devotion to [[Virgin Mary|Our Blessed Mother]] and for the preservation of the" [[Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception]] in perpetuity.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=421}}

The multimillion-dollar [[Pacem in terris|''Pacem in Terris'' Fund]] aids the Catholic Church's efforts for peace in the Middle East. A further $20&amp;nbsp;million went to church facilities and $7.4&amp;nbsp;million to Catholic schools from state and local councils.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt; The order has provided funding to restore Roman antiquities, and purchased and operates the [[Saint John Paul II National Shrine]].&lt;ref name=financial/&gt;

===Vatican and bishops===
[[File:Saint Peter's Facade at Dusk.jpg|thumb|alt=A photograph of the façade of St. Peter's Basilica.|The order funded the first renovation of the façade of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in over 350 years.&lt;ref name="Rome"/&gt;]]
The ''Vicarius Christi'' Fund has an endowment of $20&amp;nbsp;million.  Since its establishment in 1981, the fund has generated over $57 million for the [[Pope]]'s personal charities.&lt;ref name=proceeds/&gt;  The funds are invested in loans to churches.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=425}} 

The [[Vox Clara]] Committee received $100,000 in support of its efforts to translate liturgical texts.&lt;ref name=financial/&gt;  In 1965, the Knights donated the land on which the [[Paul VI Audience Hall]] was built to [[Pope Paul VI]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=409}}

The Knights give to individual churches and diocese, but is also a major donor to the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]].&lt;ref name=financial/&gt;{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=421}}  They have spent more than $1.4&amp;nbsp;million between 2010 and 2014 to provide workshops for the bishops coordinated by the [[National Catholic Bioethics Center]].&lt;ref name=financial/&gt; Since 1977, the order has provided funding to the [[Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=421}}

===Vocations===
In 2012, $1.8&amp;nbsp;million was given by state and local councils to seminaries, with an additional $5.9&amp;nbsp;million in direct assistance to seminarians.&lt;ref name=Annual2013/&gt; In 2017, more than $3.8 million was given to 6,348 seminarians and postulants.&lt;ref name=annual18/&gt;  The order also has eleven separate funds totaling $18&amp;nbsp;million to assist men and women who are discerning religious vocations pay tuition and other expenses.&lt;ref name="vocations"/&gt;

==Catholic education==
===The Catholic University of America===
{{main|History of the Knights of Columbus and The Catholic University of America}}
[[File:Knights of Columbus check presentation to The Catholic University of America.jpg|thumb|The Knights of Columbus presented a check to The Catholic University of America on the steps of the university's McMahon Hall in 1904 to establish a Chair of American History.]]

In the early years of the order, educational activities were limited to things like estalishing scholarships to local institutions, placing books in libraries, holding public lectures, and similar activities.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=1}}  In 1904, in the first national response to a call from the American church, the order presented a check for over $50,000 to [[The Catholic University of America]] to establish a chair of American history to counter the somewhat anti-Catholic bias of history-writing at the time.&lt;ref name="Pike"/&gt;{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=1}}&lt;ref name="Catholic DC"/&gt; In the years following this initial gift, an additional $500,000 was raised to [[History_of_the_Knights_of_Columbus_and_The_Catholic_University_of_America#Scholarships|establish 50 scholarships]] at the university.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=1}}  Originally there was to be one fellowship for every $10,000, with preference going to Knights or their families.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=151}}

By 1922, 146 K. of C. Fellowships had been awarded.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=152}}  In later years the funds permitted far fewer fellowships, which, in the words of the university's centennial history in 1990 "have remained the most attractive fellowships under the control of the university despite drastic reductions in their number due to the effects of inflation upon university charges for tuition, board, and room."{{sfn|Nuesse|1990|p=161}}

===Post–World War I efforts===
Following efforts to [[Political_activity_of_the_Knights_of_Columbus#World_War_I|support servicemen]] during [[World War I]], the order established an educational system for returning veterans.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}  It included evening schools, scholarships, and a correspondence school, all of which were free for men who fought in the war.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}  The system was run by Mark J. Sweany.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|loc=cover}}  Within four years, over 200,000 men would take courses in one of the order's schools, 400 would receive college scholarships, and over 10,000 would take correspondence courses.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=12}}

In June 1919, the Knights established a school a school for servicemen at [[Camp Devens]] in Massachusetts.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}  By November, when the government took over and the Knights left military facilities, classes were being taught on 25 army camps and naval bases with 5,884 students.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|pp=3–4}}

The brief experience showed both the need and the desire of servicemen to continue their education, however, and so the Knights became the first organization to establish free evening schools for able-bodied veterans.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=4}}  Courses were taught in academic, commercial, trade, and technical topics to prepare the ex-servicemen for post-war employment.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=4}}  The first such school opened in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], on July 7, 1919.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=4}}  By the end of the year, 31,163 students were taking courses in 45 schools around the country.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=4}}  An insubstantial number of those students were not veterans, but instead paid tuition to attend.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=4}}

The Supreme Council established a committee of education on August 7, 1919, to administer a series of night schools run by councils, and appropriated $50,000 for administrative costs.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=4}}  Occupational courses were offered to members and the general public for a fee.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=4}}  Courses were taught not only to improve the students' career prospects, but also to promote patriotism in the hopes that the greater good of the community would also benefit from the knowledge being imparted.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|pp=4–5}}  Veterans were allowed to attend these schools at no cost.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=5}}

====Scholarships====
The Knights of Columbus was the first organization to provide college scholarships to veterans returning home from World War I.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=6}}  The War Activities Committee first announced in August 1919 that 50 scholarships would be awarded, including tutition, fees, books, equipment, and room and board.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=6}}  Originally intending to limit the number of scholarships to 100, the Committee instead decided to award a scholarship to every man who was accepted to one of several designated schools by September 30, 1919.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=6}}  There were 2,291 applicants, and 1,002 were deemed eligible.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=7}}  Of those, 440 were deemed eligible for entrance by the colleges and universities, and 403 scholarships were awarded.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=7}}

====Correspondence courses====
A [[correspondence school]] was established by the Knights in February 1922 to serve veterans in areas outside of cities.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=8}}  By the end of that year, more than 10,000 students had enrolled from every state in the union.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=12}}    The goal was to extend to veterans "in the smaller communities and in the rural districts of the advantages of free educational opportunities through correspondence courses."{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=8}}  Students were permitted to take one course at a time.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=9}}

The courses were established for the benefit of those men and women who had served in the militaries of the United States or her allies during World War I, but not civilians.  {{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=9}} The order partnered with several universities to prepare the courses, and several provided materials at low or no cost.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=9}}

Students paid their own postage, and put down refundable deposits on some books, but there were no other costs for most courses.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=9}}  When equipment was needed, students could either furnish their own or purchase it at "the lowest possible price" from the Knights' Educational Bureau.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=12}}  Students could take up to one year to complete the courses.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=12}}

===Modern efforts===
The order funded a message from the Pope to the delegates of the 1979 [[National Catholic Education Association]] convention in which the pontiff stressed the importance of Catholic education.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=421}} The same year, the Supreme Board voted to fund the Conference's Advisory Committee on Public Policy and Catholic Schools.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=421}}

In 1979, the Supreme Board voted to fund the Conference's Advisory Committee on Public Policy and Catholic Schools.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=421}} In 1980, each member in the United States and Canada was assessed $1.00 to raise $1&amp;nbsp;million for the newly established Father Michael J. McGivney Memorial Fund for New Iniatives in Catholic Education.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=421–422}} The fund was designed to support the National Catholic Education Association's research efforts.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|pp=421–422}} The association expressed their appreciation for this and other efforts to promote Catholic education by awarding the order the [[C. ALbert Koob]] Merit Award in 1981.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=422}}

==Catholic communications==

===Satellite Uplink Program===
[[File:Negativos 2934.jpg|thumb|300px|The Knights paid for the funeral of Pope [[Paul VI]] to be televised around the world.]]

Since the 1960s, the Knights' Satellite Uplink Program has provided funding to broadcast a number of papal events, including the annual [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]] Masses, as well as the World Day of Peace in [[Assisi]], [[World Youth Day]]s, the opening of the [[Holy Door]] at St. Peter's Basilica for the [[Great Jubilee|Millennial Jubilee]], [[Pope John Paul II]]'s visit to [[Nazareth]], and several other events.&lt;ref name=financial/&gt;&lt;ref name="love"/&gt;{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=418}} In missionary territories the order also pays for the satellite downlink.&lt;ref name=financial/&gt;&lt;ref name="love"/&gt;{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=418}}

The Satellite Uplink project was originally planned to telecast three papal events each year. However, the program expanded when, upon the death of [[Pope Paul VI]], Bishop [[Andrzej Maria Deskur|Andrew-Maria Deskur]], president of the [[Pontifical Commission for Social Communications]], telegramed Supreme Knight Dechant asking if the order would pay to broadcast the funeral and following conclave and investiture of the next pope.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=418}}  The same request was made shortly thereafter following the death of [[Pope John Paul I]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=419}}  It is estimated that each telecast was seen by more than 800&amp;nbsp;million people.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=419}}

In recent years a contribution of $100,000 was made to support the Holy See's strategic communications office.&lt;ref name=financial/&gt;  It also purchased "a mobile unit with recording and transmitting equipment to enable Vatican television to broadcast in high definition."&lt;ref name=financial/&gt;

===Vatican Film Library and papal video coverage===
In 1977, Deskur asked the order for funding for two additional projects, the Vatican Film Library and [[Radio Veritas]], both of which were approved.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=419}} The film library was designed to collect all the known video footage of popes for use by journalists, scholars, and others.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=419}} This resulted in the creation of the [[Knights of Columbus Vatican Film Library]] at [[Saint Louis University]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=419}}

Following Pope John Paul II's trip to Mexico in 1978, the Knights produced an English-language video documenting the visit.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=420}} The following year the pontiff returned to Poland. Bishop [[Paul Marcinkus]], President of the [[Institute for the Works of Religion]], later told the order that raw footage of the trip existed, but there were no funds available to edit it into a usable format.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=420}} The Knights provided the money, and the videos were shown on Polish television and in movie theaters.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=420}} During his visit to the United States in October of the same year, the order once again provided funding to video record it at the request of the [[National Conference of Catholic Bishops]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=420}}

===Vatican news===
The order donated one of two new radio transmitters to the Vatican in 1966; the other was donated by Cardinal [[Francis Spellman]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=409}}  In 1977, Bishop [[Andrzej Maria Deskur|Andrew-Maria Deskur]], president of the [[Pontifical Commission for Social Communications]], requested funding for Radio Veritas, a program to broadcast religious programming to the one-quarter of the world's population living behind the [[Bamboo Curtain]] in atheistic [[communist state|communist countries]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=419}}  

The Knights have continued to support the Vatican's news operation for decades.&lt;ref name=financial/&gt;

===Catholic media===
The Knights are major sponsors of the [[Eternal Word Television Network]], the Association for Catholic Information, the Catholic News Agency, and ''Crux''.&lt;ref name=financial/&gt;  According to [[John L. Allen Jr.]], ''Crux''{{'s}} editor, while the Knights sponsor a major portion of their budget, the order has no control over content.&lt;ref name=financial/&gt;

==Culture of Life==
As part of their commitment to building a [[culture of life]],{{refn|group=nb|For more on this see, for example, [[Pope John Paul II]]'s ''[[Evangelium vitae]]'' where he discusses issues pertaining to the [[sanctity of human life]], including murder, [[Catholic Church and abortion|abortion]], [[Religious views on euthanasia|euthanasia]], and [[Catholic Church and capital punishment|capital punishment]], and more.}} the Knights consistently donate to [[pro-life]] causes, including millions annually to the recently established Ultrasound Initiative.&lt;ref name=ultra/&gt;

{{quote|Ultrasound exams, which are medically necessary throughout pregnancy for a variety of diagnostic reasons, use ultrasound waves to scan a woman's abdomen, creating a picture or "sonogram" of the baby in her uterus. Without K of C support, most pregnancy care centers would be unable to purchase the ultrasound machines, each usually costing tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name=culturelife /&gt;}}

The Knights believe that, by paying for the machines in hospitals throughout the United States and Canada, women will be better able to visualize their unborn child, and less likely to go through with an abortion.&lt;ref name=culture /&gt; The order also supports women in crisis pregnancies with alternatives to abortion, including adoption.&lt;ref name=res135 /&gt;  {{As of|August 2018}}, more than 950 ultrasound machines had been purchased, and they hoped to reach 1,000 by the end of the year.&lt;ref name=annual18/&gt;

==Military and veterans==
Each year, the Knights bring veterans to [[Lourdes]], France, as part of the International Military Pilgrimage to Our Lady’s Shrine.&lt;ref name=annual18/&gt;  In 2017, the order brought over 200 veterans through their Warriors to Lourdes program.&lt;ref name=annual18/&gt; 

As part of the order's efforts to support seminarians, they partner with the [[Archdiocese for the Military Services]] to educate priests who will serve as military chaplains.&lt;ref name=annual18/&gt;  The Knights have given over $2 million to the effort since its inception.&lt;ref name=annual18/&gt;

===Armed with the Faith===
Since 2004, the Knights have produced ''Armed with the Faith,'' a "virtually indestructible, waterproof, flip-top prayer [book], designed for use in the most rugged conditions, including hard battle."&lt;ref name=armed/&gt;  The books include prayers, information about the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacraments]] and [[holy days of obligation]], and a primer on [[just war theory]].&lt;ref name=armed/&gt;  It also includes reference material on the Church's teachings on the [[works of mercy]] and virtues.&lt;ref name=armed/&gt;  It closes with a number of classic hymns, a lost [[patron saints]] for the military, and the new Mass responses adopted in the United States in 2011.&lt;ref name=armed/&gt; 

During World War II, Canadian Knights provided prayer books to soldiers.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=344}}

===World War I===
[[File:See him through--Help us to help the boys.jpg|thumb|A Knights of Columbus poster from WWI]]

After the United States entered [[World War I]], Supreme Knight [[James A. Flaherty]] proposed to U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] that the Order establish soldiers' welfare centers in the U.S. and abroad. The organization already had experience, having provided similar services to troops encamped on the Mexican border during [[John J. Pershing|Pershing]]'s expedition of 1916.&lt;ref name=Kauffman/&gt;  Staff and chaplains were sent to every Army camp and [[cantonment]].{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}} 

With the slogan "Everyone Welcome, Everything Free," the "huts" became recreation/service centers for doughboys regardless of race or religion.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}{{sfn|Scott|1919|pp=407–408}} They were staffed by "secretaries," commonly referred to as "Caseys" (for K of C) who were generally men above the age of military service. The centers provided basic amenities not readily available, such as stationery, hot baths, and religious services.&lt;ref name=appel/&gt; One well-known "Casey" was major league baseball player [[Johnny Evers]] of ""Tinker-to-Evers-to-Chance," who traveled to France as a member of the Knights of Columbus to organize baseball games for the troops.&lt;ref name=evers/&gt;  A total of 260 buildings were erected and 1,134 secretaries, of which 1,075 were overseas, staffed them.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}  In Europe, headquarters were established in London and Paris.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}  The order continued this work until November 1919, at which point the effort was taken over by the federal government.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}

To pay for these huts and their staff, the order instituted a per capita tax on the membership to raise $1 million.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}  Local councils undertook their own fundraising drives which resulted in an additional $14 million to support the effort.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}  In 1918, just before the war ended, the Knights and other organizations undertook another effort to raise funds to support the welfare of the men fighting abroad.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}   The amount apportioned to the order and the National Catholic War Council totaled $30 million which, when combined with earlier efforts, funded efforts to support troops both in the United States and overseas.{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}  After the war, the Knights became involved in education, occupational training, and employment programs for the returning troops.&lt;ref name=Kauffman/&gt;{{sfn|Sweany|1923|p=3}}

===World War II===
Less than two weeks after the outbreak of [[World War II]], on September 13, 1939, Canadian Supreme Director Claude Brown wired each Canadian state deputy to inform them of his plans to establish a welfare program comparable to the "huts" sponsored by the order during World War I.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=343}}  The Canadian government accepted his proposal by the end of October, and formed a unified organization including the Knights, the [[YMCA]], the [[Salvation Army]], and the [[Canadian Legion]].{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=343}}  Between December 1939 and April 1940, the Canadian Knights raised almost $230,000, "an extraordinary amount considering the fact that there were relatively few Knights in Canada."{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=343}}  

In large cities, recreation centers were established, and morale programs were run in a number of training camps.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=344}}  Hostels were established for servicemen on furloughs first in Canada, then England, and eventually across Europe.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=344}}  Sporting events were organized, musical and comedy shows were produced, and even academic courses and a library were provided.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=344}}  

Recognizing the danger the volunteers who staffed these camps were undertaking, the Canadian government gave them a stipend equal to that of a captain in the Canadian Army and made them eligible for retirement and disability pay.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=344}}  F. O'Neil, who ran the Knights' recreation center in Hong Kong, was captured by the Japanese and was made a prisoner of war.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=344}}  Six volunteers, including Brown, died during the war.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=344}}

Canadian Knights, and not the government, provided supplies for Catholic chaplains.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=344}}  Bishop [[Charles Leo Nelligan]] of the [[Military Ordinariate of Canada]] wrote that 

{{quote|In Canada the Knights of Columbus Canadian Army Huts stretch like a golden chain from coast to coast, connecting up all out military camps and a large number of our newly established training centers.  In each and every one of them is to be found a genial and capable staff, always ready and anxious to serve the troops.{{sfn|Kauffman|1982|p=344}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29810">In [[physics]], two wave sources are perfectly coherent if they have a constant [[phase difference]] and the same [[frequency]], and the same [[waveform]]. Coherence is an ideal property of [[wave]]s that enables stationary (i.e. temporally and spatially constant) [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]]. It contains several distinct concepts, which are limiting cases that never quite occur in reality but allow an understanding of the physics of waves, and has become a very important concept in quantum physics. More generally, '''coherence''' describes all properties of the [[correlation function|correlation]] between [[physical quantities]] of a single wave, or between several waves or wave packets.

Interference is the addition, in the mathematical sense, of wave functions. A single wave can interfere with itself, but this is still an addition of two waves (see [[Young's interference experiment|Young's slits experiment]]). Constructive or destructive interferences are limit cases, and two waves always interfere, even if the result of the addition is complicated or not remarkable.

When interfering, two waves can add together to create a wave of greater amplitude than either one ([[constructive interference]]) or subtract from each other to create a wave of lesser amplitude than either one ([[destructive interference]]), depending on their relative [[phase (waves)|phase]]. Two waves are said to be coherent if they have a constant relative phase. The amount of coherence can readily be measured by the [[interference visibility]], which looks at the size of the interference fringes relative to the input waves (as the phase offset is varied); a precise mathematical definition of the [[degree of coherence]] is given by means of correlation functions.

Spatial coherence describes the correlation (or predictable relationship) between waves at different points in space, either lateral or longitudinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hecht|title=Optics|date=1998|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|isbn=0-201-83887-7|pages=554–574|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temporal coherence describes the correlation between waves observed at different moments in time. Both are observed in the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] and [[Young's interference experiment]]. Once the fringes are obtained in the [[Michelson interferometer]], when one of the mirrors is moved away gradually, the time for the beam to travel increases and the fringes become dull and finally are showing temporal coherence. Similarly, if in a [[double-slit experiment]], the space between the two slits is increased, the coherence dies gradually and finally the fringes disappear, showing spatial coherence.  In both cases, the fringe amplitude slowly disappears, as the path difference increases past the coherence length.

==Introduction==
Coherence was originally conceived in connection with [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s [[double-slit experiment]] in [[optics]] but is now used in any field that involves waves, such as [[acoustics]], [[electrical engineering]], [[neuroscience]], and [[quantum mechanics]]. Coherence describes the statistical similarity of a field (electromagnetic field, quantum wave packet etc.) at two points in space or time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/149011826|title=Introduction to the theory of coherence and polarization of light|last=Emil.|first=Wolf,|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521822114|location=Cambridge|oclc=149011826}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The property of coherence is the basis for commercial applications such as [[holography]], the [[Sagnac interferometer|Sagnac]] [[gyroscope]], radio [[Phased array|antenna array]]s, [[optical coherence tomography]] and telescope interferometers ([[Interferometry#Astronomical optical interferometry|astronomical optical interferometers]] and [[radio telescope]]s).

==Mathematical definition==

A precise definition is given at [[degree of coherence]].

The coherence function between two signals &lt;math&gt; x(t) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y(t) &lt;/math&gt; is defined as&lt;ref&gt;Shin. K, Hammond. J.'' Fundamentals of signal processing for sound and vibration engineers''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_{xy}^{2}(f)=\frac{|S_{xy}(f)|^2}{S_{xx}(f)S_{yy}(f)}&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt; S_{xy}(f) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[cross-spectral density]] of the signal and &lt;math&gt; S_{xx}(f) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; S_{yy}(f) &lt;/math&gt; are the power [[spectral density]] functions of &lt;math&gt; x(t) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y(t) &lt;/math&gt;, respectively. The cross-spectral density and the power spectral density are defined as the [[Fourier transforms]] of the [[cross-correlation]] and the [[autocorrelation]] signals, respectively. For instance, if the signals are functions of time, the cross-correlation is a measure of the similarity of the two signals as a function of the time lag relative to each other and the autocorrelation is a measure of the similarity of each signal with itself in different instants of time. In this case the coherence is a function of frequency. Analogously, if &lt;math&gt; x(t) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; y(t) &lt;/math&gt; are functions of space, the cross-correlation measures the similarity of two signals in different points in space and the autocorrelations the similarity of the signal relative to itself for a certain separation distance.  In that case, coherence is a function of [[wavenumber]] (spatial frequency).

The coherence varies in the interval &lt;math&gt; 0\leqslant \gamma_{xy}^{2}(f)\leqslant 1. &lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{xy}^{2}(f)=1 &lt;/math&gt; it means that the signals are perfectly correlated or linearly related and if &lt;math&gt; \gamma_{xy}^{2}(f)=0 &lt;/math&gt; they are totally uncorrelated. If a linear system is being measured, &lt;math&gt; x(t) &lt;/math&gt; being the input and &lt;math&gt; y(t) &lt;/math&gt; the output, the coherence function will be unitary all over the spectrum. However, if non-linearities are present in the system the coherence will vary in the limit given above.

==Coherence and correlation==
The coherence of two waves expresses how well correlated the waves are as quantified by the [[cross-correlation]] function.&lt;ref name="winter"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cross-correlation quantifies the ability to predict the phase of the second wave by knowing the phase of the first. As an example, consider two waves perfectly correlated for all times. At any time, phase difference will be constant.{{clarify|reason=Correlation appears to be used in a sloppy way here. If they always change the same way, how can they exhibit destructive interference? Is correlation the expectation value of the product ⟨X Y⟩? This is not at all the ability to predict X from Y. In particular, a perfectly coherent 1/4 cycle phase difference will allow perfect prediction but yield zero correlation.|date=May 2015}} If, when combined, they exhibit perfect constructive interference, perfect destructive interference, or something in-between but with constant phase difference, then it follows that they are perfectly coherent. As will be discussed below, the second wave need not be a separate entity. It could be the first wave at a different time or position. In this case, the measure of correlation is the [[autocorrelation]] function (sometimes called '''self-coherence'''). Degree of correlation involves correlation functions.{{R|Hecht2002|page=545-550}}

==Examples of wave-like states==
These states are unified by the fact that their behavior is described by a [[wave equation]] or some generalization thereof.
*Waves in a rope (up and down) or [[slinky]] (compression and expansion)
*[[Surface waves]] in a liquid
*[[Electromagnetic]] signals (fields) in [[transmission line]]s
*[[Sound]]
*[[Radio wave]]s and [[Microwaves]]
*[[Light wave]]s ([[optics]])
*[[Electron]]s, [[atom]]s and any other object (such as a baseball), as described by [[quantum physics]]

In most of these systems, one can measure the wave directly. Consequently, its correlation with another wave can simply be calculated. However, in optics one cannot measure the [[electric field]] directly as it oscillates much faster than any detector's time resolution.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, we measure the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] of the light. Most of the concepts involving coherence which will be introduced below were developed in the field of optics and then used in other fields. Therefore, many of the standard measurements of coherence are indirect measurements, even in fields where the wave can be measured directly.

==Temporal coherence==&lt;!--Temporal coherence redirects here--&gt;
[[File:Single frequency correlation.svg|thumb|450px|Figure 1: The amplitude of a single frequency wave as a function of time ''t'' (red) and a copy of the same wave delayed by τ (blue).

[[File:phase drift.png|thumb|450px|right|Figure 2: The amplitude of a wave whose phase drifts significantly in time τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; as a function of time ''t'' (red) and a copy of the same wave delayed by 2τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(green). At any particular time t the wave can interfere perfectly with its delayed copy. But, since half the time the red and green waves are in phase and half the time out of phase, when averaged over t any interference disappears at this delay.]]

Temporal coherence is the measure of the average correlation between the value of a wave and itself delayed by τ, at any pair of times. Temporal coherence tells us how monochromatic a source is. In other words, it characterizes how well a wave can interfere with itself at a different time. The delay over which the phase or amplitude wanders by a significant amount (and hence the correlation decreases by significant amount) is defined as the [[coherence time]] ''τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''. At a delay of τ=0 the degree of coherence is perfect, whereas it drops significantly as the delay passes ''τ=τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''. The [[coherence length]] ''L&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is defined as the distance the wave travels in time τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Hecht2002"&gt;{{citation|last =Hecht |first=Eugene|title=Optics|year=2002| location=United States of America | publisher=Addison Wesley| edition= 4th| isbn=0-8053-8566-5 | language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|560, 571–573}}

One should be careful not to confuse the coherence time with the time duration of the signal, nor the coherence length with the coherence area (see below).

===The relationship between coherence time and bandwidth===
It can be shown that the larger the range of frequencies Δf a wave contains, the faster the wave decorrelates (and hence the smaller τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is). Thus there is a tradeoff:{{R|Hecht2002|page=358-359, 560}}

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_c \Delta f \lesssim 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Formally, this follows from the [[convolution theorem]] in mathematics, which relates the [[Fourier transform]] of the power spectrum (the intensity of each frequency) to its [[autocorrelation]].{{R|Hecht2002|page=572}}

===Examples of temporal coherence===
We consider four examples of temporal coherence. 
*A wave containing only a single frequency (monochromatic) is perfectly correlated with itself at all time delays, in accordance with the above relation. (See Figure 1)
*Conversely, a wave whose phase drifts quickly will have a short coherence time. (See Figure 2)
*Similarly, pulses ([[wave packet]]s) of waves, which naturally have a broad range of frequencies, also have a short coherence time since the amplitude of the wave changes quickly. (See Figure 3)
*Finally, white light, which has a very broad range of frequencies, is a wave which varies quickly in both amplitude and phase. Since it consequently has a very short coherence time (just 10 periods or so), it is often called incoherent.

Monochromatic sources are usually [[laser]]s; such high monochromaticity implies long coherence lengths (up to hundreds of meters). For example, a stabilized and monomode [[helium–neon laser]] can easily produce light with coherence lengths of 300 m.&lt;ref name=saleh-teich&gt;{{cite book|last=Saleh, Teich|title=Fundamentals of Photonics|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all lasers are monochromatic, however (e.g. for a mode-locked [[Ti-sapphire laser]], Δλ ≈ 2&amp;nbsp;nm - 70&amp;nbsp;nm). LEDs are characterized by Δλ ≈ 50&amp;nbsp;nm, and tungsten filament lights exhibit Δλ ≈ 600&amp;nbsp;nm, so these sources have shorter coherence times than the most monochromatic lasers.

[[Holography]] requires light with a long coherence time. In contrast, [[optical coherence tomography]], in its classical version, uses light with a short coherence time.

===Measurement of temporal coherence===
[[File:wave packets.png|thumb|400px|right|Figure 3: The amplitude of a wavepacket whose amplitude changes significantly in time τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; (red) and a copy of the same wave delayed by 2τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(green) plotted as a function of time ''t''. At any particular time the red and green waves are uncorrelated; one oscillates while the other is constant and so there will be no interference at this delay. Another way of looking at this is the wavepackets are not overlapped in time and so at any particular time there is only one nonzero field so no interference can occur.]]
[[File:interference finite coherence.png|thumb|390px|right|Figure 4: The time-averaged intensity (blue) detected at the output of an interferometer plotted as a function of delay τ for the example waves in Figures 2 and 3. As the delay is changed by half a period, the interference switches between constructive and destructive. The black lines indicate the interference envelope, which gives the [[degree of coherence]]. Although the waves in Figures 2 and 3 have different time durations, they have the same coherence time.]]

In optics, temporal coherence is measured in an interferometer such as the [[Michelson interferometer]] or [[Mach–Zehnder interferometer]]. In these devices, a wave is combined with a copy of itself that is delayed by time τ. A detector measures the time-averaged [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] of the light exiting the interferometer. The resulting interference visibility (e.g. see Figure 4) gives the temporal coherence at delay τ. Since for most natural light sources, the coherence time is much shorter than the time resolution of any detector, the detector itself does the time averaging. Consider the example shown in Figure 3. At a fixed delay, here 2τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, an infinitely fast detector would measure an intensity that fluctuates significantly over a time ''t'' equal to τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case, to find the temporal coherence at 2τ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, one would manually time-average the intensity.

==Spatial coherence==&lt;!--Spatial coherence redirects here--&gt;
In some systems, such as water waves or optics, wave-like states can extend over one or two dimensions. Spatial coherence describes the ability for two points in space, ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', in the extent of a wave to interfere, when averaged over time. More precisely, the spatial coherence is the [[cross-correlation]] between two points in a wave for all times. If a wave has only 1 value of amplitude over an infinite length, it is perfectly spatially coherent. The range of separation between the two points over which there is significant interference defines the diameter of the coherence area, ''A&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodman|title=Statistical Optics|date=1985|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|isbn=0-471-01502-4|pages=210,221|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Coherence length, often a feature of a source, is usually an industrial term related to the coherence time of the source, not the coherence area in the medium.)  A&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the relevant type of coherence for the Young's double-slit interferometer. It is also used in optical imaging systems and particularly in various types of astronomy telescopes. Sometimes people also use "spatial coherence" to refer to the visibility when a wave-like state is combined with a spatially shifted copy of itself.

===Examples of spatial coherence===

File:spatial coherence pinhole.png|&lt;small&gt;Figure 8: A wave with finite coherence area is incident on a pinhole (small aperture). The wave will [[diffraction|diffract]] out of the pinhole. Far from the pinhole the emerging spherical wavefronts are approximately flat. The coherence area is now infinite while the coherence length is unchanged.&lt;/small&gt;
File:spatial coherence detector.png|&lt;small&gt;Figure 9: A wave with infinite coherence area is combined with a spatially shifted copy of itself. Some sections in the wave interfere constructively and some will interfere destructively. Averaging over these sections, a detector with length D will measure reduced [[interference visibility]]. For example, a misaligned [[Mach–Zehnder interferometer]] will do this.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Consider a tungsten light-bulb filament. Different points in the filament emit light independently and have no fixed phase-relationship. In detail, at any point in time the profile of the emitted light is going to be distorted. The profile will change randomly over the coherence time &lt;math&gt;\tau_c&lt;/math&gt;. Since for a white-light source such as a light-bulb &lt;math&gt;\tau_c&lt;/math&gt; is small, the filament is considered a spatially incoherent source. In contrast, a radio [[Phased array|antenna array]], has large spatial coherence because antennas at opposite ends of the array emit with a fixed phase-relationship. Light waves produced by a laser often have high temporal and spatial coherence (though the degree of coherence depends strongly on the exact properties of the laser). Spatial coherence of laser beams also manifests itself as speckle patterns and diffraction fringes seen at the edges of shadow.

Holography requires temporally and spatially coherent light. Its inventor, [[Dennis Gabor]], produced successful holograms more than ten years before lasers were invented. To produce coherent light he passed the monochromatic light from an emission line of a [[mercury-vapor lamp]] through a pinhole spatial filter.

In February 2011 it was reported that [[helium]] atoms, cooled to near [[absolute zero]] / [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] state, can be made to flow and behave as a coherent beam as occurs in a laser.&lt;ref&gt;

==Spectral coherence==
[[File:Coherent superposition.svg|thumb|right|350px|Figure 10: Waves of different frequencies interfere to form a localized pulse if they are coherent.]]
[[File:spectral coherence continuous.png|thumb|right|350px|Figure 11: Spectrally incoherent light interferes to form continuous light with a randomly varying phase and amplitude]]

Waves of different frequencies (in light these are different colours) can interfere to form a pulse if they have a fixed relative phase-relationship (see [[Fourier transform]]). Conversely, if waves of different frequencies are not coherent, then, when combined, they create a wave that is continuous in time (e.g. white light or [[white noise]]). The temporal duration of the pulse &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is limited by the spectral bandwidth of the light &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt; according to:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta f\Delta t \ge 1&lt;/math&gt;,

which follows from the properties of the Fourier transform and results in [[Küpfmüller's uncertainty principle]] (for quantum particles it also results in the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]).

If the phase depends linearly on the frequency (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\theta (f) \propto f&lt;/math&gt;) then the pulse will have the minimum time duration for its bandwidth (a ''transform-limited'' pulse), otherwise it is chirped (see [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]]).

===Measurement of spectral coherence===
Measurement of the spectral coherence of light requires a [[nonlinear optics|nonlinear]] optical interferometer, such as an intensity [[optical autocorrelation|optical correlator]], [[frequency-resolved optical gating]] (FROG), or [[spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction]] (SPIDER).
{{clear}}

==Polarization and coherence==
Light also has a [[polarization (waves)|polarization]], which is the direction in which the electric field oscillates. Unpolarized light is composed of incoherent light waves with random polarization angles. The electric field of the unpolarized light wanders in every direction and changes in phase over the coherence time of the two light waves. An absorbing [[polarizer]] rotated to any angle will always transmit half the incident intensity when averaged over time.

If the electric field wanders by a smaller amount the light will be partially polarized so that at some angle, the polarizer will transmit more than half the intensity. If a wave is combined with an orthogonally polarized copy of itself delayed by less than the coherence time, partially polarized light is created.

The polarization of a light beam is represented by a vector in the [[Polarization (waves)#Parameterization|Poincaré sphere]]. For polarized light the end of the vector lies on the surface of the sphere, whereas the vector has zero length for unpolarized light. The vector for partially polarized light lies within the sphere

==Applications==

===Holography===
Coherent superpositions of ''optical wave fields'' include [[holography]]. Holographic objects are used frequently in daily life in bank notes and credit cards.

===Non-optical wave fields===
Further applications concern the coherent superposition of  ''non-optical wave fields''. In quantum mechanics for example one considers a probability field, which is related to the wave function &lt;math&gt;\psi (\mathbf r)&lt;/math&gt; (interpretation: density of the probability amplitude). Here the applications concern, among others, the future technologies of [[quantum computing]] and the already available technology of [[quantum cryptography]]. Additionally the problems of the following subchapter are treated.

===Modal Analysis===
Coherence is used to check the quality of the transfer functions (FRFs) being measured. Low coherence can be caused by poor signal to noise ratio, and/or inadequate frequency resolution.

In [[quantum mechanics]], all objects have wave-like properties (see [[Matter wave|de Broglie wave]]s). For instance, in Young's [[double-slit experiment]] electrons can be used in the place of light waves. Each electron's wave-function goes through both slits, and hence has two separate split-beams that contribute to the intensity pattern on a screen. According to standard wave theory

these two contributions give rise to an intensity pattern of bright bands due to constructive interference, interlaced with dark bands due to destructive interference, on a downstream screen. This ability to interfere and diffract is related to coherence (classical or quantum) of the waves produced at both slits. The association of an electron with a wave is unique to quantum theory.

When the incident beam is represented by a quantum [[pure state]], the split beams downstream of the two slits are represented as a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] of the pure states representing each split beam

. The quantum description of imperfectly coherent paths is called a [[Mixed state (physics)|mixed state]]. A perfectly coherent state has a [[density matrix]] (also called the "statistical operator") that is a projection onto the pure coherent state and is equivalent to a wave function, while a mixed state is described by a classical probability distribution for the pure states that make up the mixture. 

[[Macroscopic scale]] quantum coherence leads to novel phenomena, the so-called [[macroscopic quantum phenomena]]. For instance, the [[laser]], [[superconductivity]] and [[superfluidity]] are examples of highly coherent quantum systems whose effects are evident at the macroscopic scale. The macroscopic quantum coherence (Off-Diagonal Long-Range Order, ODLRO)&lt;ref&gt;

for superfluidity, and laser light, is related to first-order (1-body) coherence/ODLRO, while superconductivity is related to second-order coherence/ODLRO. (For fermions, such as electrons, only even orders of coherence/ODLRO are possible.) For bosons, a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] is an example of a system exhibiting macroscopic quantum coherence through a multiple occupied single-particle state. 

The classical electromagnetic field exhibits macroscopic quantum coherence. The most obvious example is the carrier signal for radio and TV. They satisfy [[Roy J. Glauber|Glauber]]'s quantum description of coherence.

Recently [[Martin Bodo Plenio|M.B. Plenio]] and co-workers constructed an operational formulation of quantum coherence as a resource theory. They introduced coherence monotones analogous to the entanglement monotones.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[physics]] and [[thermodynamics]], an '''equation of state''' is a [[thermodynamic equations|thermodynamic equation]] relating [[state variable]]s which describe the state of matter under a given set of physical conditions, such as [[pressure]], [[Volume (thermodynamics)|volume]], [[temperature]] ('''PVT'''), or [[internal energy]].&lt;ref name="Perrot" &gt;{{cite book | author=Perrot, Pierre | title=A to Z of Thermodynamics | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1998 | isbn=978-0-19-856552-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equations of state are useful in describing the properties of [[fluid]]s, mixtures of fluids, [[solid]]s, and the interior of [[star]]s.
{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Thermodynamic system|Systems]]}}

==Overview==
The most prominent use of an equation of state is to correlate densities of gases and liquids to temperatures and pressures. One of the simplest equations of state for this purpose is the [[ideal gas law]], which is roughly accurate for weakly polar gases at low pressures and moderate temperatures. However, this equation becomes increasingly inaccurate at higher pressures and lower temperatures, and fails to predict condensation from a gas to a liquid. Therefore, a number of more accurate equations of state have been developed for gases and liquids. At present, there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all substances under all conditions.

Another common use is in modeling the interior of stars, including [[neutron star]]s, dense matter ([[quark–gluon plasma]]s) and radiation fields. A related concept is the [[perfect fluid]] [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state used in cosmology]].

Equations of state can also describe solids, including the transition of solids from one crystalline state to another.

In a practical context, equations of state are instrumental for PVT calculations in [[process engineering]] problems, such as petroleum gas/liquid equilibrium calculations. A successful PVT model based on a fitted equation of state can be helpful to determine the state of the flow regime, the parameters for handling the [[reservoir fluids]], and pipe sizing.

== Historical ==

=== Boyle's law (1662) ===
Boyle's Law was perhaps the first expression of an equation of state.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} In 1662, the Irish physicist and chemist [[Robert Boyle]] performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] was added to the tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end. Through these experiments, Boyle noted that the gas volume varied inversely with the pressure. In mathematical form, this can be stated as:

:&lt;math&gt; pV = \mathrm{constant}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &lt;!--this V doesn't have to be molar volume--&gt;

The above relationship has also been attributed to [[Edme Mariotte]] and is sometimes referred to as Mariotte's law. However, Mariotte's work was not published until 1676.

=== Charles's law or Law of Charles and Gay-Lussac (1787) ===
In 1787 the French physicist [[Jacques Charles]] found that oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and air expand to roughly the same extent over the same 80-kelvin interval. Later, in 1802, [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] published results of similar experiments, indicating a linear relationship between volume and temperature:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{T_1} = \frac{V_2}{T_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Dalton's law of partial pressures (1801) ===
[[Dalton's Law]] of partial pressure states that the pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone.

Mathematically, this can be represented for ''n'' species as:

::&lt;math&gt;
p_\text{total} = p_1+p_2+\cdots+p_n = p_\text{total} = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i.
&lt;/math&gt;

=== The ideal gas law (1834) ===
In 1834, [[Émile Clapeyron]] combined Boyle's Law and Charles' law into the first statement of the ''[[ideal gas law]]''. Initially, the law was formulated as ''pV&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''R''(''T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' + 267) (with temperature expressed in degrees Celsius), where ''R'' is the [[gas constant]]. However, later work revealed that the number should actually be closer to 273.2, and then the Celsius scale was defined with 0{{nbsp}}°C = 273.15{{nbsp}}K, giving:

:&lt;math&gt;pV_m = R \left(T_C + 273.15\ {}^\circ\text{C}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Van der Waals equation of state (1873) ===
In 1873, [[J. D. van der Waals]] introduced the first [[van der Waals equation|equation of state]] derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules.&lt;ref name="van der Waals" &gt;{{cite book |author1=van der Waals |author2=J. D. | title=On the Continuity of the Gaseous and Liquid States (doctoral dissertation) | publisher=Universiteit Leiden | year=1873}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state, and was most famously continued via the [[Redlich–Kwong equation of state]] and the [[#Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong|Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong]].

== General form of an equation of state ==
For a given amount of substance contained in a system, the temperature, volume, and pressure are not independent quantities; they are connected by a relationship of the general form

:&lt;math&gt;f(p, V, T) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

An equation used to model this relationship is called an equation of state. In the following sections major equations of state are described, and the variables used here are defined as follows. Any consistent set of units may be used, although [[International System of Units|SI]] units are preferred. [[Thermodynamic temperature|Absolute temperature]] refers to use of the [[Kelvin]] (K) or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] (°R) temperature scales, with zero being absolute zero.

:&lt;math&gt;\ p&lt;/math&gt;, pressure (absolute)
:&lt;math&gt;\ V&lt;/math&gt;, volume
:&lt;math&gt;\ n&lt;/math&gt;, number of moles of a substance
:&lt;math&gt;\ V_m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{n}&lt;/math&gt;, '''[[molar volume]]''', the volume of 1 mole of gas or liquid
:&lt;math&gt;\ T&lt;/math&gt;, [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute temperature]]
:&lt;math&gt;\ R&lt;/math&gt;, [[gas constant|ideal gas constant]] ≈ 8.3144621{{nbsp}}J/mol·K
:&lt;math&gt;\ p_c&lt;/math&gt;, pressure at the critical point
:&lt;math&gt;\ V_c&lt;/math&gt;, molar volume at the critical point
:&lt;math&gt;\ T_c&lt;/math&gt;, absolute temperature at the critical point

== Classical ideal gas law ==
The classical [[ideal gas law]] may be written

:&lt;math&gt;pV = nRT.&lt;/math&gt;

In the form shown above, the equation of state is thus

:&lt;math&gt;f(p, V, T) = pV - nRT = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

If the [[Perfect gas|calorically perfect]] gas approximation is used, then the ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows

:&lt;math&gt;p = \rho(\gamma - 1)e&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;  is the density, &lt;math&gt;\gamma = C_p/C_v&lt;/math&gt; is the adiabatic index ([[heat capacity ratio|ratio of specific heats]]), &lt;math&gt;e = C_v T&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy per unit mass (the "specific internal energy"), &lt;math&gt;C_v&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat at constant volume, and &lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; is the specific heat at constant pressure.

== Cubic equations of state ==
Cubic equations of state are called such because they can be rewritten as a [[cubic function]] of V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Van der Waals equation of state ===
The [[Van der Waals equation]] of state may be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(p + \frac{a}{V_m^2}\right)\left(V_m - b\right) = RT&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt; is [[molar volume]]. The substance-specific constants &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated from the [[critical properties]] &lt;math&gt;p_c, T_c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_c&lt;/math&gt; (noting that &lt;math&gt;V_c&lt;/math&gt; is the molar volume at the critical point) as:
:&lt;math&gt;a = 3p_c\, V_c^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{V_c}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also written as
:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{27(R\,T_c)^2}{64p_c}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{R\,T_c}{8p_c}.&lt;/math&gt;

Proposed in 1873, the van der Waals equation of state was one of the first to perform markedly better than the ideal gas law. In this landmark equation &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is called the attraction parameter and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; the repulsion parameter or the effective molecular volume. While the equation is definitely superior to the ideal gas law and does predict the formation of a liquid phase, the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms. While the van der Waals equation is commonly referenced in text-books and papers for historical reasons, it is now obsolete. Other modern equations of only slightly greater complexity are much more accurate.

The van der Waals equation may be considered as the ideal gas law, "improved" due to two independent reasons:
# Molecules are thought as particles with volume, not material points. Thus &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt; cannot be too little, less than some constant. So we get (&lt;math&gt;V_m - b&lt;/math&gt;) instead of &lt;math&gt;V_m&lt;/math&gt;.
# While ideal gas molecules do not interact, we consider molecules attracting others within a distance of several molecules' radii. It makes no effect inside the material, but surface molecules are attracted into the material from the surface. We see this as diminishing of pressure on the outer shell (which is used in the ideal gas law), so we write (&lt;math&gt;p +&lt;/math&gt; something) instead of &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. To evaluate this ‘something’, let's examine an additional force acting on an element of gas surface. While the force acting on each surface molecule is ~&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, the force acting on the whole element is ~&lt;math&gt;\rho^2&lt;/math&gt;~&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{V_m^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

With the reduced state variables, i.e. V&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=P/P&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;=T/T&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, the reduced form of the Van der Waals equation can be formulated:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(P_r + \frac{3}{V_r^2}\right)\left(3V_r - 1\right) = 8T_r&lt;/math&gt;

The benefit of this form is that for given T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, the reduced volume of the liquid and gas can be calculated directly using [[Cubic function#Cardano's method|Cardano's method]] for the reduced cubic form:

:&lt;math&gt;V_r^3 - \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{8T_r}{3P_r}\right)V_r^2 + \frac{3V_r}{P_r} - \frac{1}{P_r} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

For P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;1 and T&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;1, the system is in a state of vapor–liquid equilibrium. The reduced cubic equation of state yields in that case 3 solutions. The largest and the lowest solution are the gas and liquid reduced volume.

=== Redlich-Kwong equation of state ===
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  p &amp;= \frac{R\,T}{V_m - b} - \frac{a}{\sqrt{T}\,V_m\left(V_m + b\right)} \\[3pt]
  a &amp;\approx 0.42748\frac{R^2\,T_c^\frac{5}{2}}{p_c} \\[3pt]
  b &amp;\approx 0.08664\frac{R\,T_c}{p_c}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Introduced in 1949, the [[Redlich-Kwong equation of state]] was a considerable improvement over other equations of the time. It is still of interest primarily due to its relatively simple form. While superior to the van der Waals equation of state, it performs poorly with respect to the liquid phase and thus cannot be used for accurately calculating [[vapor–liquid equilibria]]. However, it can be used in conjunction with separate liquid-phase correlations for this purpose.

The Redlich-Kwong equation is adequate for calculation of gas phase properties when the ratio of the pressure to the [[critical properties|critical pressure]] (reduced pressure) is less than about one-half of the ratio of the temperature to the [[critical properties|critical temperature]] (reduced temperature):

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p}{p_c} &lt; \frac{T}{2T_c}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong ===
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{R\,T}{V_m-b} - \frac{a\,\alpha}{V_m\left(V_m+b\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{0.42747\,R^2\,T_c^2}{P_c}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{0.08664\,R\,T_c}{P_c}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \left(1 + \left(0.48508 + 1.55171\,\omega - 0.15613\,\omega^2\right) \left(1-T_r^{\,0.5}\right)\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;T_r = \frac{T}{T_c}&lt;/math&gt;

Where ω is the [[acentric factor]] for the species.

This formulation for &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is due to Graboski and Daubert.  The original formulation from Soave is:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = \left(1 + \left(0.480 + 1.574\,\omega - 0.176\,\omega^2\right) \left(1-T_r^{\,0.5}\right)\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

for hydrogen:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 1.202 \exp\left(-0.30288\,T_r\right).&lt;/math&gt;

We can also write it in the polynomial form, with:

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{a\,\alpha\,P}{R^2\,T^2}&lt;/math&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{b\,P}{R\,T}&lt;/math&gt;
then we have:
:&lt;math&gt;0 = Z^3-Z^2+Z\left(A-B-B^2\right)-AB \;&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gas constant]] and Z=PV/(RT) is the [[compressibility factor]].

In 1972 G. Soave&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/0009-2509(72)80096-4|title = Equilibrium constants from a modified Redlich-Kwong equation of state| journal=Chemical Engineering Science| volume=27| issue=6| pages=1197–1203|year = 1972|last1 = Soave|first1 = Giorgio}}&lt;/ref&gt; replaced the 1/{{radic|''T''}} term of the Redlich-Kwong equation with a function α(T,ω) involving the temperature and the [[acentric factor]] (the resulting equation is also known as the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state; SRK EOS). The α function was devised to fit the vapor pressure data of hydrocarbons and the equation does fairly well for these materials.

Note especially that this replacement changes the definition of ''a'' slightly, as the &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt; is now to the second power.

=== Volume translation of Peneloux et alios ===
The SRK EOS may be written as
:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{R\,T}{V_{m,\text{SRK}} - b} - \frac{a}{V_{m,\text{SRK}} \left(V_{m,\text{SRK}} + b\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    a &amp;= a_c\, \alpha \\
  a_c &amp;\approx 0.42747\frac{R^2\,T_c^2}{P_c} \\
    b &amp;\approx 0.08664\frac{R\,T_c}{P_c}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and other parts of the SRK EOS is defined in the SRK EOS section.

A downside of the SRK EOS, and other cubic EOS, is that the liquid molar volume is significantly less accurate than the gas molar volume. Peneloux et alios (1982)&lt;ref name="Peneloux1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Peneloux|first1=A.|last2=Rauzy|first2=E.|last3=Freze|first3=R.|year=1982|title= A Consistent Correction for Redlich-Kwong-Soave Volumes|journal= Fluid Phase Equilibria|volume=8|issue=1982|pages=7–23|doi=10.1016/0378-3812(82)80002-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a simple correction for this by introducing a volume translation

:&lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}} = V_m + c&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is an additional fluid component parameter that translate the molar volume slightly. On the liquid branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a large change in pressure. On the gas branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a much smaller change in pressure than for the liquid branch. Thus, the perturbation of the molar gas volume is small. Unfortunately, there are two versions that occur in science and industry.

In the first version only &lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}}&lt;/math&gt; is translated,&lt;ref name="Soave1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Soave|first1=G.|last2=Fermeglia|first2=M.|year=1990|title= On the Application of Cubic Equation of State to Synthetic High-Pressure VLE Measurements|journal= Fluid Phase Equilibria|volume=60|issue=1990|pages=261–271|doi=10.1016/0378-3812(90)85056-G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;p = \frac{R\,T}{V_m + c - b} - \frac{a}{\left(V_m + c\right) \left(V_m + c + b\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

In the second version both &lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_\text{SRK}&lt;/math&gt; are translated, or the translation of &lt;math&gt;V_{m,\text{SRK}}&lt;/math&gt; is followed by a renaming of the composite parameter {{nowrap|b − c}}.&lt;ref name="Pedersen1989"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Pedersen|first1=K.

The c-parameter of a fluid mixture is calculated by
:&lt;math&gt;c = \sum_{i=1}^n z_i c_i&lt;/math&gt;

The c-parameter of the individual fluid components in a petroleum gas and oil can be estimated by the correlation

:&lt;math&gt;c_i \approx 0.40768\ \frac{RT_{ci}}{P_{ci}} \left(0.29441 - Z_{\text{RA},i}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

where the Rackett compressibility factor &lt;math&gt;Z_{text{RA},i}&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated by

:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{RA},i} \approx 0.29056 - 0.08775\ \omega_i&lt;/math&gt;

A nice feature with the volume translation method of Peneloux et alios (1982) is that it does not affect the vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations.&lt;ref name="Knudsen1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knudsen|first1=K.|year=1992|title=Phase Equilibria and Transport of Multiphase Systems|journal=Ph.D. Thesis at the Technical University of Denmark. Department of Chemical Engineering|issue=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted that this method of volume translation can also be applied to other cubic EOSs if the c-parameter correlation is adjusted to match the selected EOS.

=== Peng–Robinson equation of state ===

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
       p &amp;= \frac{R\,T}{V_m - b} - \frac{a\,\alpha}{V_m^2 + 2bV_m - b^2} \\[3pt]
       a &amp;\approx 0.45724 \frac{R^2\,T_c^2}{p_c} \\[3pt]
       b &amp;\approx 0.07780 \frac{R\,T_c}{p_c} \\[3pt]
  \alpha &amp;= \left(1 + \kappa \left(1 - T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)^2 \\[3pt]
  \kappa &amp;\approx 0.37464 + 1.54226\,\omega - 0.26992\,\omega^2 \\[3pt]
     T_r &amp;= \frac{T}{T_c}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

In polynomial form:
:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{\alpha a p}{R^2\,T^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B = \frac{bp}{RT}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z^3 - (1 - B)Z^2 + \left(A - 2B - 3B^2\right)Z - \left(AB - B^2 - B^3\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[acentric factor]] of the species, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gas constant]] and &lt;math&gt;Z = PV/nRT&lt;/math&gt; is [[compressibility factor]].

The Peng–Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) was developed in 1976 at The [[University of Alberta]] by [[Ding Yu Peng|Ding-Yu Peng]] and Donald Robinson in order to satisfy the following goals:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A New Two-Constant Equation of State | journal = Industrial and Engineering Chemistry: Fundamentals | volume = 15 | year = 1976 | pages = 59–64 |author1=Peng, D. Y. |author2=Robinson, D. B. | doi = 10.1021/i160057a011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The parameters should be expressible in terms of the [[critical properties]] and the [[acentric factor]].
# The model should provide reasonable accuracy near the critical point, particularly for calculations of the [[compressibility factor]] and liquid density.
# The mixing rules should not employ more than a single binary interaction parameter, which should be independent of temperature, pressure and composition.
# The equation should be applicable to all calculations of all fluid properties in natural gas processes.

For the most part the Peng–Robinson equation exhibits performance similar to the Soave equation, although it is generally superior in predicting the liquid densities of many materials, especially nonpolar ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Essentials of Reservoir Engineering | volume = 1 | year = 2007 | pages = 151 | author = Pierre Donnez  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[departure function]]s of the Peng–Robinson equation are given on a separate article.

The analytic values of its characteristic constants are:

: &lt;math&gt;Z_c = \frac{1}{32} \left( 11 - 2\sqrt{7} \sinh(\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{asinh}(\frac{13}{7 \sqrt{7}})) \right) \approx 0.307401&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;b' = \frac{b}{V_{m,c}} = \frac{1}{3} \left( \sqrt{8} \sinh(\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{asinh}(\sqrt{8}) ) - 1 \right) \approx 0.253077 \approx \frac{0.07780}{Z_c} &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{P_c V_{m,c}^2}{a\,b'} = \frac{3}{8} \left( 1 + \cosh(\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{acosh}(3) ) \right) \approx 0.816619 \approx \frac{Z_c^2}{0.45724 \, b'} &lt;/math&gt;

====PRSV1====
A modification to the attraction term in the Peng–Robinson equation of state published by Stryjek and Vera in 1986 (PRSV) significantly improved the model's accuracy by introducing an adjustable pure component parameter and by modifying the polynomial fit of the [[acentric factor]].&lt;ref name="PRSV1"&gt;{{cite journal | title = PRSV: An improved Peng–Robinson equation of state for pure compounds and mixtures | journal = The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | year = 1986 | pages = 323–333 |author1=Stryjek, R.  |author2=Vera, J. H. | doi = 10.1002/cjce.5450640224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modification is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \kappa &amp;= \kappa_0 + \kappa_1 \left(1 + T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(0.7 - T_r\right) \\
  \kappa_0 &amp;= 0.378893+1.4897153\,\omega - 0.17131848\,\omega^2 + 0.0196554\,\omega^3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1&lt;/math&gt; is an adjustable pure component parameter.  Stryjek and Vera published pure component parameters for many compounds of industrial interest in their original journal article. At reduced temperatures above 0.7, they recommend to set &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and simply use &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \kappa_0 &lt;/math&gt;. For alcohols and water the value of &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1 &lt;/math&gt; may be used up to the critical temperature and set to zero at higher temperatures.&lt;ref name="PRSV1" /&gt;

====PRSV2====
A subsequent modification published in 1986 (PRSV2) further improved the model's accuracy by introducing two additional pure component parameters to the previous attraction term modification.&lt;ref name="PRSV2"&gt;{{cite journal | title = PRSV2: A cubic equation of state for accurate vapor—liquid equilibria calculations | journal = The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | year = 1986 | pages = 820–826 |author1=Stryjek, R.  |author2=Vera, J. H. | doi = 10.1002/cjce.5450640516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modification is:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \kappa &amp;= \kappa_0 + \left[\kappa_1 + \kappa_2\left(\kappa_3 - T_r\right)\left(1 - T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]\left(1 + T_r^\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(0.7 - T_r\right) \\
  \kappa_0 &amp;= 0.378893 + 1.4897153\,\omega - 0.17131848\,\omega^2 + 0.0196554\,\omega^3
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\,\kappa_3&lt;/math&gt; are adjustable pure component parameters.

PRSV2 is particularly advantageous for [[vapor–liquid equilibrium|VLE]] calculations.  While PRSV1 does offer an advantage over the Peng–Robinson model for describing thermodynamic behavior, it is still not accurate enough, in general, for phase equilibrium calculations.&lt;ref name="PRSV1" /&gt;  The highly non-linear behavior of phase-equilibrium calculation methods tends to amplify what would otherwise be acceptably small errors.  It is therefore recommended that PRSV2 be used for equilibrium calculations when applying these models to a design.  However, once the equilibrium state has been determined, the phase specific thermodynamic values at equilibrium may be determined by one of several simpler models with a reasonable degree of accuracy.&lt;ref name="PRSV2" /&gt;

One thing to note is that in the PRSV equation, the parameter fit is done in a particular temperature range which is usually below the critical temperature. Above the critical temperature, the PRSV alpha function tends to diverge and become arbitrarily large instead of tending towards 0. Because of this, alternate equations for alpha should be employed above the critical point. This is especially important for systems containing hydrogen which is often found at temperatures far above its critical point. Several alternate formulations have been proposed. Some well known ones are by Twu et all or by Mathias and Copeman.

=== Elliott, Suresh, Donohue equation of state ===
The Elliott, Suresh, and Donohue (ESD) equation of state was proposed in 1990.&lt;ref name="ESD" &gt;{{cite journal |author1=J. Richard, Jr. Elliott |author2=S. Jayaraman Suresh |author3=Marc D. Donohue | year=1990 | title=A Simple Equation of State for Nonspherical and Associating Molecules | journal=Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. |volume=29 | pages=1476–1485 | doi=10.1021/ie00103a057 | issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equation seeks to correct a shortcoming in the Peng–Robinson EOS in that there was an inaccuracy in the van der Waals repulsive term. The EOS accounts for the effect of the shape of a non-polar molecule and can be extended to polymers with the addition of an extra term (not shown). The EOS itself was developed through modeling computer simulations and should capture the essential physics of the size, shape, and hydrogen bonding.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{p V_m}{RT}=Z=1 + Z^{\rm{rep}} + Z^{\rm{att}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;Z^{\rm{rep}} = \frac{4 c \eta}{1-1.9 \eta}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z^{\rm{att}} = -\frac{z_m q \eta Y}{1+ k_1 \eta Y}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is a "shape factor", with &lt;math&gt;c=1&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules
:For non-spherical molecules, the following relation is suggested:

:&lt;math&gt;c=1+3.535\omega+0.533\omega^2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[acentric factor]]

:The reduced number density &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is defined as &lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{v^* n}{V}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;v^*&lt;/math&gt; is the characteristic size parameter
:&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of molecules
:&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the container
The characteristic size parameter is related to the shape parameter &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; through
:&lt;math&gt;v^*=\frac{kT_c}{P_c}\Phi&lt;/math&gt;
where

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi=\frac{0.0312+0.087(c-1)+0.008(c-1)^2}{1.000+2.455(c-1)+0.732(c-1)^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is [[Boltzmann's constant]].

Noting the relationships between Boltzmann's constant and the [[Universal gas constant]], and observing that the number of molecules can be expressed in terms of [[Avogadro's number]] and the [[molar mass]], the reduced number density &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in terms of the molar volume as

:&lt;math&gt;\eta=\frac{R T_c}{P_c}\Phi\frac{1}{V_m}.&lt;/math&gt;

The shape parameter &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; appearing in the Attraction term and the term &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; are given by
:&lt;math&gt;q=1+k_3(c-1)&lt;/math&gt; (and is hence also equal to 1 for spherical molecules).

:&lt;math&gt;Y=\exp\left(\frac{\epsilon}{kT}\right) - k_2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the depth of the square-well potential and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\epsilon}{k} =\frac{1.000+0.945(c-1)+0.134(c-1)^2}{1.023+2.225(c-1)+0.478(c-1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z_m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_3&lt;/math&gt; are constants in the equation of state:
:&lt;math&gt;z_m = 9.49&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules (c=1)
:&lt;math&gt;k_1 = 1.7745&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules (c=1)
:&lt;math&gt;k_2 = 1.0617&lt;/math&gt; for spherical molecules (c=1)
:&lt;math&gt;k_3 = 1.90476.&lt;/math&gt;

The model can be extended to associating components and mixtures of nonassociating components. Details are in the paper by J.R. Elliott, Jr. ''et al.'' (1990).&lt;ref name="ESD"/&gt;

The Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) equation of state combines the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation with an association term from Wertheim theory.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kontogeorgis|first1=Georgios M.|last2=Michelsen|first2=Michael L.|last3=Folas|first3=Georgios K.|last4=Derawi|first4=Samer|last5=von Solms|first5=Nicolas|last6=Stenby|first6=Erling H.|title=Ten Years with the CPA (Cubic-Plus-Association) Equation of State.

== Non-cubic equations of state ==

=== Dieterici equation of state ===
: &lt;math&gt;p(V - b) = RTe^{-\frac{a}{RTV}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is associated with the interaction between molecules and ''b'' takes into account the finite size of the molecules, similar to the Van der Waals equation.

The reduced coordinates are:
: &lt;math&gt;T_c = \frac{a}{4Rb},\ p_c = \frac{a}{4b^2 e^2},\ V_c = 2b.&lt;/math&gt;

== Virial equations of state ==

=== Virial equation of state ===
{{main|Virial expansion}}
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{pV_m}{RT} = A + \frac{B}{V_m} + \frac{C}{V_m^2} + \frac{D}{V_m^3} + \dots&lt;/math&gt;

Although usually not the most convenient equation of state, the virial equation is important because it can be derived directly from [[statistical mechanics]]. This equation is also called the [[Kamerlingh Onnes]] equation. If appropriate assumptions are made about the mathematical form of intermolecular forces, theoretical expressions can be developed for each of the [[virial coefficient|coefficients]]. ''A'' is the first virial coefficient, which has a constant value of 1 and makes the statement that when volume is large, all fluids behave like ideal gases. The second virial coefficient ''B'' corresponds to interactions between pairs of molecules, ''C'' to triplets, and so on. Accuracy can be increased indefinitely by considering higher order terms.  The coefficients ''B'', ''C'', ''D'', etc. are functions of temperature only.

One of the most accurate equations of state is that from Benedict-Webb-Rubin-Starling&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fluid Properties for Light Petroleum Systems |last=Starling |first=Kenneth E. |publisher=Gulf Publishing Company |year=1973 |page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt; shown next. It was very close to a virial equation of state. If the exponential term in it is expanded to two Taylor terms, a virial equation can be derived:
:&lt;math&gt;p=\rho RT + \left(B_0 RT-A_0 - \frac{C_0}{T^2} + \frac{D_0}{T^3} - \frac{E_0}{T^4}\right) \rho^2 + \left(bRT-a-\frac{d}{T} + \frac{c}{T^2}\right) \rho^3 + \alpha\left(a+\frac{d}{T}\right) \rho^6 &lt;/math&gt;

Note that in this virial equation, the fourth and fifth virial terms are zero. The second virial coefficient is monotonically decreasing as temperature is lowered. The third virial coefficient is monotonically increasing as temperature is lowered.

=== The BWR equation of state ===
{{main|Benedict–Webb–Rubin equation}}
:&lt;math&gt;
  p = \rho RT +
      \left(B_0 RT - A_0 - \frac{C_0}{T^2} + \frac{D_0}{T^3} - \frac{E_0}{T^4}\right) \rho^2 +
      \left(bRT - a - \frac{d}{T}\right) \rho^3 +
      \alpha\left(a + \frac{d}{T}\right) \rho^6 +
      \frac{c\rho^3}{T^2}\left(1 + \gamma\rho^2\right)\exp\left(-\gamma\rho^2\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where
:''p'' is pressure
:''ρ'' is molar density

== Multiparameter equations of state ==

=== Helmholtz Function form ===
Multiparameter equations of state (MEOS) can be used to represent pure fluids with high accuracy, in both the liquid and gaseous states. MEOS's represent the Helmholtz function of the fluid as the sum of ideal gas and residual terms. Both terms are explicit in reduced temperature and reduced density - thus:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a(T, \rho)}{RT} = 
  \frac{a^o(T, \rho) + a^r(T, \rho)}{RT} =
  \alpha^o(\tau, \delta) + \alpha^r(\tau, \delta)
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: &lt;math&gt;\tau = \frac{T_r}{T}, \delta = \frac{\rho}{\rho_r}&lt;/math&gt;

The reduced density and temperature are typically, though not always, the critical values for the pure fluid.

Other thermodynamic functions can be derived from the MEOS by using appropriate derivatives of the Helmholtz function; hence, because integration of the MEOS is not required, there are few restrictions as to the functional form of the ideal or residual terms. Typical MEOS use upwards of 50 fluid specific parameters, but are able to represent the fluid's properties with high accuracy. MEOS are available currently for about 50 of the most common industrial fluids including refrigerants. Mixture models also exist.

== Other equations of state of interest ==

===Stiffened equation of state===

When considering water under very high pressures, in situations such as [[Underwater explosion|underwater nuclear explosions]], [[Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy|sonic shock lithotripsy]], and [[sonoluminescence]], the stiffened equation of state is often used:

:&lt;math&gt;p = \rho(\gamma - 1)e - \gamma p^0 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy per unit mass, &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is an empirically determined constant typically taken to be about 6.1, and &lt;math&gt;p^0&lt;/math&gt; is another constant, representing the molecular attraction between water molecules. The magnitude of the correction is about 2 gigapascals (20,000 atmospheres).

The equation is stated in this form because the speed of sound in water is given by &lt;math&gt;c^2 = \gamma\left(p + p^0\right)/\rho&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus water behaves as though it is an ideal gas that is ''already'' under about 20,000 atmospheres (2&amp;nbsp;GPa) pressure, and explains why water is commonly assumed to be incompressible: when the external pressure changes from 1 atmosphere to 2 atmospheres (100&amp;nbsp;kPa to 200&amp;nbsp;kPa), the water behaves as an ideal gas would when changing from 20,001 to 20,002 atmospheres (2000.1&amp;nbsp;MPa to 2000.2&amp;nbsp;MPa).

This equation mispredicts the [[specific heat capacity]] of water but few simple alternatives are available for severely nonisentropic processes such as strong shocks.

===Ultrarelativistic equation of state===

An [[ultrarelativistic fluid]] has equation of state

:&lt;math&gt;p = \rho_m c_s^2&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure, &lt;math&gt;\rho_m&lt;/math&gt; is the mass density, and &lt;math&gt;c_s&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of sound]].

===Ideal Bose equation of state===

The equation of state for an ideal [[Bose gas]] is

:&lt;math&gt;pV_m =
  RT~\frac{\text{Li}_{\alpha+1}(z)}{\zeta(\alpha)}
  \left(\frac{T}{T_c}\right)^\alpha
&lt;/math&gt;

where α is an exponent specific to the system (e.g. in the absence of a potential field, α = 3/2), ''z'' is exp(''μ''/''kT'') where ''μ'' is the [[chemical potential]], Li is the [[polylogarithm]], ζ is the [[Riemann zeta function]], and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is the critical temperature at which a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] begins to form.

===Jones–Wilkins–Lee equation of state for explosives (JWL equation)===
The '''equation of state from Jones–Wilkins–Lee''' is used to describe the detonation products of explosives.

:&lt;math&gt;p = A \left( 1 - \frac{\omega}{R_1 V} \right) \exp(-R_1 V) + B \left( 1 - \frac{\omega}{R_2 V} \right) \exp\left(-R_2 V\right) + \frac{\omega e_0}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

The ratio &lt;math&gt; V = \rho_e / \rho &lt;/math&gt; is defined by using &lt;math&gt; \rho_e &lt;/math&gt; = density of the explosive (solid part) and &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; = density of the detonation products. The parameters &lt;math&gt; A &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; B &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; R_1 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; R_2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; are given by several references.&lt;ref name="Dobratz" &gt;{{Cite journal |author1=B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7571">An '''ethogram''' is a catalogue or inventory of behaviours or actions exhibited by an animal used in [[ethology]]. 

The behaviours in an ethogram are usually defined to be mutually exclusive and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]], avoiding [[Subjectivism|subjectivity]] and functional inference as to their possible purpose.&lt;ref name="mouse ethogram"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01664181 |title=Mouse mutants studied by means of ethological methods |year=1964 |last1=Abeelen |first1=J.H.F. |authorlink=Hans van Abeelen |journal=[[Genetica]] |volume=34 |pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wolf ethogram"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = MacNulty | first1 = Daniel R. | last2 = Mech | first2 = L.

This degree of objectivity is required because what looks like "courtship" might have a completely different function, and in addition, the same motor patterns in different species can have very different functions (e.g. tail wagging in cats and dogs).  Objectivity and clarity in the definitions of behaviours also improve [[Inter-rater reliability|inter-observer reliability]]. 

Often, ethograms are hierarchical in presentation. The defined behaviours are recorded under broader categories of behaviour which may allow functional inference such that "head forward" is recorded under "Aggression".  In ethograms of social behaviour, the ethogram may also indicate the "Giver" and "Receiver" of activities.

Sometimes, the definition of a behaviour in an ethogram may have arbitrary components.  For example, "Stereotyped licking" might be defined as "licking the bars of the cage more than 5 times in 30 seconds".  The definition may be arguable, but if it is stated clearly, it fulfils the requirements of scientific repeatability and clarity of reporting and data recording.

Some ethograms are given in pictorial form and not only catalogue the behaviours but indicate the frequency of their occurrence and the probability that one behaviour follows another.  This probability can be indicated numerically or by the thickness of an arrow connecting the two behaviours.  Sometimes the proportion of time that each behaviour occupies can be represented in a [[pie chart]] or [[bar chart]]

[[File:Sengakuji 47 ronin graves.jpg|thumb|Graves of the forty-seven rōnin at [[Sengaku-ji]]]]
The revenge of the {{nihongo|'''forty-seven ''rōnin'''''|四十七士|Shi-jū-shichi-shi|forty-seven samurai}}, also known as the {{nihongo|'''Akō incident'''|赤穂事件|Akō jiken}} or ''Akō vendetta'', is an 18th-century historical event in Japan in which a band of ''[[rōnin]]'' (leaderless [[samurai]]) avenged the death of their master. The incident has since become legendary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/kanadehon/Index.htm | title = Kanadehon | publisher = Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story tells of a group of samurai who were left leaderless (becoming ''[[rōnin]]'') after their ''[[daimyō]]'' (feudal lord) [[Asano Naganori]] was compelled to perform ''[[seppuku]]'' (ritual suicide) for assaulting a court official named [[Kira Yoshinaka]], whose title was ''[[Kōzuke Province|Kōzuke]] no [[Kokushi (official)|suke]]''. After waiting and planning for a year, the ''rōnin'' avenged their master's honor by killing Kira. In turn, they were themselves obliged to commit ''seppuku'' for committing the crime of [[murder]]. This true story was popularized in Japanese culture as emblematic of the loyalty, sacrifice, persistence, and honor that people should preserve in their daily lives. The popularity of the tale grew during the [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era, in which Japan underwent rapid modernization, and the legend became entrenched within discourses of national heritage and identity.

Fictionalized accounts of the tale of the Forty-seven Rōnin are known as ''[[Chūshingura]].'' The story was popularized in numerous plays, including ''[[bunraku]]'' and ''[[kabuki]]''. Because of the [[censorship]] laws of the [[Tokugawa shogunate|shogunate]] in the ''[[Genroku]]'' [[Japanese era name|era]], which forbade portrayal of current events, the names were changed. While the version given by the playwrights may have come to be accepted as historical fact by some {{who|date=March 2014}}, the first ''Chūshingura'' was written some 50 years after the event, and numerous historical records about the actual events that predate the ''Chūshingura'' survive.

The ''bakufu'''s censorship laws had relaxed somewhat 75 years later in the late 18th century, when Japanologist [[Isaac Titsingh]] first recorded the story of the forty-seven ''rōnin'' as one of the significant events of the ''Genroku'' era.&lt;ref name="s91"&gt;Screech, T. (2006). ''Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan,'' p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, the story continues to be popular in Japan, and each year on December 14, [[Sengaku-ji|Sengakuji Temple]], where Asano Naganori and the ''rōnin'' are buried, holds a festival commemorating the event.

==Name==
The event is known in Japan as the {{nihongo|''Akō incident''|赤穂事件|Akō jiken}}, sometimes also referred to as the ''Akō vendetta''. The participants in the revenge are called the {{nihongo|Akō-rōshi|赤穂浪士}} or {{nihongo|Shi-jū-shichi-shi|四十七士}} in Japanese, and are usually referred to as the "Forty-seven Rōnin" or "Forty-seven leaderless samurai" in English. Literary accounts of the events are known as the {{nihongo|''Chūshingura''|忠臣蔵|The Treasury of Loyal Retainers}}.

==Story==
For many years, the version of events retold by [[Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale|A. B. Mitford]] in ''[[Tales of Old Japan]]'' (1871) was considered authoritative{{by whom|date=July 2018}}. The sequence of events and the characters in this narrative were presented to a wide popular readership in the [[Western world|West]]. Mitford invited his readers to construe his story of the Forty-seven Rōnin as historically accurate; and while his version of the tale has long been considered a standard work, some of its precise details are now questioned.&lt;ref name=smith1&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/retelling/Mitford.htm#Analysis Analysis of Mitford's story] by [http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/ Dr. Henry Smith], [http://www.columbia.edu/~hds2/chushinguranew/index.htm Chushinguranew website], Columbia University&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, even with plausible defects, Mitford's work remains a conventional starting point for further study.&lt;ref name=smith1/&gt;

Whether as a mere literary device or as a claim for ethnographic veracity, Mitford explains:
{{quote |''In the midst of a nest of venerable trees in [[Takanawa]], a suburb of Yedo, is hidden Sengakuji, or the Spring-hill Temple, renowned throughout the length and breadth of the land for its cemetery, which contains the graves of the Forty-seven Rônin, famous in Japanese history, heroes of Japanese drama, '''the tale of whose deed I am about to transcribe'''. | Mitford, A. B.&lt;ref&gt;(1871). ''Tales of Old Japan,'' pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; [emphasis added]}}

Mitford appended what he explained were translations of Sengaku-ji documents the author had examined personally. These were proffered as "proofs" authenticating the factual basis of his story.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 28–34.&lt;/ref&gt; These documents were:
# ''...the receipt given by the retainers of Kira Kôtsuké no Suké's son in return for the head of their lord's father, which the priests restored to the family.''&lt;ref name="Mitford, p. 30"&gt;Mitford, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''...a document explanatory of their conduct, a copy of which was found on the person of each of the forty-seven men,'' dated in the 15th year of Genroku, 12th month.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''...a paper which the Forty-seven Rǒnin laid upon the tomb of their master, together with the head of Kira Kôtsuké no Suké.''&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

(See ''[[Tales of Old Japan]]'' for the widely known, yet significantly fictional narrative.)

===Genesis of a tragedy===
[[File:Chushingura Matsu no Oroka.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Ukiyo-e]] print depicting Asano Naganori's assault on Kira Yoshinaka in the ''Matsu no Ōrōka'' of Edo Castle]]
[[File:MatsuNoORoka.jpg|thumb|Memorial stone marking the site of the ''Matsu no Ōrōka'' (Great Corridor of Pines) in [[Edo Castle]], where Asano attacked Kira]]
In 1701, two ''[[daimyō]]s'', [[Asano Naganori|Asano Takumi-no-Kami Naganori]], the young ''daimyō'' of the [[Akō Domain]] (a small [[fiefdom]] in western [[Honshū]]), and Lord Kamei Korechika of the [[Tsuwano Domain]], were ordered to arrange a fitting reception for the envoys of [[Emperor Higashiyama|the Emperor]] at [[Edo Castle]], during their ''[[sankin-kōtai]]'' service to the ''[[shōgun]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, A. B. (1871). ''Tales of Old Japan'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

These ''daimyō'' names are not fictional, nor is there any question that something actually happened in {{nihongo|''Genroku'' (year) 15, on the 14th day of the 12th month|元禄十五年十二月十四日||Tuesday, January 30, 1703}}.&lt;ref name="Tsuchihashi conversion"&gt;[http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/geschichte-japans/nengo_calc.htm Tsuchihashi conversion] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930014735/http://www.uni-tuebingen.de/geschichte-japans/nengo_calc.htm |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; What is commonly called ''the Akō incident'' was an actual event.&lt;ref name="s91"/&gt;

Asano and Kamei were to be given instruction in the necessary court etiquette by Kira Kozuke-no-Suke Yoshinaka, a powerful official in the hierarchy of [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]]'s shogunate. He became upset at them, allegedly either because of the insufficient presents they offered him (in the time-honored compensation for such an instructor), or because they would not offer bribes as he wanted. Other sources say that he was naturally rude and arrogant or that he was corrupt, which offended Asano, a devoutly [[moral]] [[Confucian]]. By some accounts, it also appears that Asano may have been unfamiliar with the intricacies of the shogunate court and failed to show the proper amount of deference to Kira. Whether Kira treated them poorly, insulted them, or failed to prepare them for fulfilling specific ''[[bakufu]]'' duties,&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; offence was taken.&lt;ref name = "s91" /&gt;

Initially, Asano bore all this stoically, while Kamei became enraged and prepared to kill Kira to avenge the insults. However, Kamei's quick-thinking counselors averted disaster for their lord and clan (for all would have been punished if Kamei had killed Kira) by quietly giving Kira a large bribe; Kira thereupon began to treat Kamei nicely, which calmed Kamei.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Kira allegedly continued to treat Asano harshly because he was upset that the latter had not emulated his companion. Finally, Kira insulted Asano, calling him a country boor with no manners, and Asano could restrain himself no longer. At the ''[[Matsu no Ōrōka]]'', the main grand corridor that interconnects the ''Shiro-[[shoin]]'' (白書院) and the ''Ōhiroma'' of the ''Honmaru Goten'' (本丸御殿) residence, Asano lost his temper and attacked Kira with a dagger, wounding him in the face with his first strike; his second missed and hit a pillar. Guards then quickly separated them.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kira's wound was hardly serious, but the attack on a shogunate official within the boundaries of the ''shōgun''{{'}}s residence was considered a grave offence. Any kind of violence, even the drawing of a [[katana]], was completely forbidden in [[Edo Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''daimyō'' of Akō had removed his dagger from its scabbard within Edo Castle, and for that offence, he was ordered to kill himself by ''[[seppuku]]''.&lt;ref name = "s91" /&gt; Asano's goods and lands were to be confiscated after his death, his family was to be ruined, and his retainers were to be made ''[[rōnin]]'' (leaderless).

This news was carried to [[Ōishi Yoshio|Ōishi Kuranosuke Yoshio]], Asano's principal counsellor, who took command and moved the Asano family away before complying with ''bakufu'' orders to surrender the castle to the agents of the government.

===The ''rōnin'' plot revenge===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
[[File:Utagawa Kunisada-c1850-Horibe Yahei-Horibe Yasubei.jpg|thumb|Two of the Forty-Seven Rōnin: Horibe Yahei and his adopted son, Horibe Yasubei. Yasubei is holding an [[ōtsuchi]].]]
Of Asano's over 300 men, 47, especially their leader Ōishi, refused to allow their lord to go unavenged, even though revenge had been prohibited in the case. They banded together, swearing a secret oath to avenge their master by killing Kira, even though they knew that they would be severely punished for doing so.

Kira was well guarded, however, and his residence had been fortified to prevent just such an event. The ''rōnin'' saw that they would have to lull the suspicions of Kira and other shogunate authorities, so they dispersed and became tradesmen and monks.

Ōishi took up residence in Kyoto and began to frequent brothels and taverns, as if nothing were further from his mind than revenge. Kira still feared a trap and sent spies to watch Asano's former retainers.

One day, as Ōishi was returning home drunk, he fell down in the street and went to sleep, and all the passers-by laughed at him. A [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] man was so infuriated by this behaviour on the part of a samurai&amp;mdash;by his lack of courage to avenge his master as well as his current debauched behaviour&amp;mdash;that he abused and insulted Ōishi, kicking him in the face (to even touch the face of a samurai was a great insult, let alone strike it) and spitting on him.

Not too long after, Ōishi divorced his loyal wife of twenty years so that no harm would come to her when the ''rōnin'' took their revenge. He sent her away with their two younger children to live with her parents; he gave their eldest boy, Chikara, the choice to stay and fight or to leave. Chikara remained with his father.

Ōishi began to act oddly and very unlike the composed samurai. He frequented geisha houses (particularly [[Ichiriki Chaya]]), drank nightly, and acted obscenely in public. Ōishi's men bought a geisha, hoping she would calm him. This was all a ruse to rid Ōishi of his spies.

Kira's agents reported all this to Kira, who became convinced that he was safe from Asano's retainers, that they must all be bad samurai indeed, without the courage to avenge their master after a year and a half. Thinking them harmless and lacking funds from his "retirement", he then reluctantly let down his guard.

The rest of the faithful ''rōnin'' now gathered in Edo, and in their roles as workmen and merchants gained access to Kira's house, becoming familiar with the layout of the house and the character of all within. One of the retainers (Okano Kinemon Kanehide) went so far as to marry the daughter of the builder of the house, to obtain the house's design plans. All of this was reported to Ōishi. Others gathered arms and secretly transported them to Edo, another offence.

===The attack===
[[File:Akoroshi in assault equipments 20101213.jpg|thumb|Modern day reenactment of a samurai armed for the attack]]
[[File:HokusaiChushingura.jpg|thumb|The ''rōnin'' attack the principal gate of Kira's mansion]]
After two years, when Ōishi was convinced that Kira was thoroughly off his guard,&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and everything was ready, he fled from Kyoto, avoiding the spies who were watching him, and the entire band gathered at a secret meeting place in Edo to renew their oaths.

In {{nihongo|''Genroku'' 15, on the 14th day of the 12th month|元禄十五年十二月十四日||Tuesday, January 30, 1703}},&lt;ref name="Tsuchihashi conversion"/&gt; early in the morning in a driving wind during a heavy fall of snow, Ōishi and the other ''rōnin'' attacked Kira Yoshinaka's mansion in Edo. According to a carefully laid-out plan, they split up into two groups and attacked, armed with swords and bows. One group, led by Ōishi, was to attack the front gate; the other, led by his son, Ōishi Chikara, was to attack the house via the back gate. A drum would sound the simultaneous attack, and a whistle would signal that Kira was dead.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once Kira was dead, they planned to cut off his head and lay it as an offering on their master's tomb. They would then turn themselves in and wait for their expected sentence of death.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; All this had been confirmed at a final dinner, at which Ōishi had asked them to be careful and spare women, children, and other helpless people.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ōishi had four men scale the fence and enter the porter's lodge, capturing and tying up the guard there.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; He then sent messengers to all the neighboring houses, to explain that they were not robbers, but retainers out to avenge the death of their master, and that no harm would come to anyone else: the neighbors were all safe. One of the ''rōnin'' climbed to the roof and loudly announced to the neighbors that the matter was an act of revenge ([[Revenge#History|katakiuchi]], 敵討ち). The neighbors, who all hated Kira, were relieved and did nothing to hinder the raiders.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

After posting archers (some on the roof) to prevent those in the house (who had not yet awakened) from sending for help, Ōishi sounded the drum to start the attack. Ten of Kira's retainers held off the party attacking the house from the front, but Ōishi Chikara's party broke into the back of the house.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kira, in terror, took refuge in a closet in the veranda, along with his wife and female servants. The rest of his retainers, who slept in barracks outside, attempted to come into the house to his rescue. After overcoming the defenders at the front of the house, the two parties led by father and son joined up and fought the retainers who came in. The latter, perceiving that they were losing, tried to send for help, but their messengers were killed by the archers posted to prevent that eventuality.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, after a fierce struggle, the last of Kira's retainers was subdued; in the process, the ''rōnin'' killed 16 of Kira's men and wounded 22, including his grandson. Of Kira, however, there was no sign. They searched the house, but all they found were crying women and children. They began to despair, but Ōishi checked Kira's bed, and it was still warm, so he knew he could not be far away.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The death of Kira===
A renewed search disclosed an entrance to a secret courtyard hidden behind a large scroll; the courtyard held a small building for storing charcoal and firewood, where two more hidden armed retainers were overcome and killed. A search of the building disclosed a man hiding; he attacked the searcher with a dagger, but the man was easily disarmed.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

He refused to say who he was, but the searchers felt sure it was Kira, and sounded the whistle. The ''rōnin'' gathered, and Ōishi, with a lantern, saw that it was indeed Kira—as a final proof, his head bore the scar from Asano's attack.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

At that, Ōishi went on his knees, and in consideration of Kira's high rank, respectfully addressed him, telling him they were retainers of Asano, come to avenge him as true samurai should, and inviting Kira to die as a true samurai should, by killing himself. Ōishi indicated he personally would act as a ''[[kaishakunin]]'' ("second", the one who beheads a person committing seppuku to spare them the indignity of a lingering death) and offered him the same dagger that Asano had used to kill himself.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, no matter how much they entreated him, Kira crouched, speechless and trembling. At last, seeing it was useless to continue asking, Ōishi ordered the other ''rōnin'' to pin him down, and killed him by cutting off his head with the dagger.

They then extinguished all the lamps and fires in the house (lest any cause the house to catch fire and start a general fire that would harm the neighbors) and left, taking Kira's head.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the ''rōnin'', the ''[[ashigaru]]'' Terasaka Kichiemon, was ordered to travel to Akō and report that their revenge had been completed. (Though Kichiemon's role as a messenger is the most widely accepted version of the story, other accounts have him running away before or after the battle, or being ordered to leave before the ''rōnin'' turned themselves in.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Henry D. II |year=2004 |title=The Trouble with Terasaka: The Forty-Seventh Ronin and the Chushingura Imagination |journal=Japan Review |pages=16:3–65 |url=http://202.231.40.34/jpub/pdf/jr/IJ1601.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The aftermath===
[[File:HiroshigeChushingura.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The ''rōnin'', on their way back to Sengaku-ji, are halted in the street, and invited in for rest and refreshment.]]
[[File:Femme-47-ronin-seppuku-p1000701.jpg|thumb|Women have their own ritual suicide, in which they slit their own throats. Here, the wife of Onodera Junai, one of the Forty-seven Rōnin, prepares for her suicide; note the legs tied together, a female feature of seppuku to ensure a "decent" posture in death]]
As day was now breaking, they quickly carried Kira's head from his residence to their lord's grave in [[Sengaku-ji]] temple, marching about ten kilometers across the city, causing a great stir on the way. The story of the revenge spread quickly, and everyone on their path praised them and offered them refreshment.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

On arriving at the temple, the remaining 46 ''rōnin'' (all except Terasaka Kichiemon) washed and cleaned Kira's head in a well, and laid it, and the fateful dagger, before Asano's tomb. They then offered prayers at the temple, and gave the abbot of the temple all the money they had left, asking him to bury them decently, and offer prayers for them. They then turned themselves in; the group was broken into four parts and put under guard of four different ''daimyō''.&lt;ref&gt;Mitford, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, two friends of Kira came to collect his head for burial; the temple still has the original receipt for the head, which the friends and the priests who dealt with them had all signed.&lt;ref name="Mitford, p. 30"/&gt;

The shogunate officials in Edo were in a quandary. The samurai had followed the precepts by avenging the death of their lord; but they had also defied the shogunate's authority by exacting revenge, which had been prohibited. In addition, the ''shōgun'' received a number of petitions from the admiring populace on behalf of the ''rōnin''. As expected, the ''rōnin'' were sentenced to death for the murder of Kira; but the ''shōgun'' finally resolved the quandary by ordering them to honorably commit ''seppuku'' instead of having them executed as criminals.&lt;ref name = "Mitford 28"&gt;Mitford, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that each of the assailants ended his life in a ritualistic fashion.&lt;ref name = "s91" /&gt; Ōishi Chikara, the youngest, was only 15 years old on the day the raid took place, and only 16 the day he committed ''seppuku''.

Each of the 46 ''rōnin'' killed himself in {{nihongo|''Genroku'' 16, on the 4th day of the 2nd month|元禄十六年二月四日||February 4, 1703}}.&lt;ref name="Tsuchihashi conversion"/&gt; This has caused a considerable amount of confusion ever since, with some people referring to the "forty-six rōnin"; this refers to the group put to death by the ''shōgun'', while the actual attack party numbered forty-seven. The forty-seventh ''rōnin'', identified as Terasaka Kichiemon, eventually returned from his mission and was pardoned by the ''shōgun'' (some say on account of his youth). He lived until the age of 87, dying around 1747, and was then buried with his comrades. The assailants who died by ''seppuku'' were subsequently interred on the grounds of Sengaku-ji,&lt;ref name = "s91" /&gt; in front of the tomb of their master.&lt;ref name = "Mitford 28" /&gt;

The clothes and arms they wore are still preserved in the temple to this day, along with the drum and whistle; their armor was all home-made, as they had not wanted to arouse suspicion by purchasing any.

The tombs became a place of great veneration, and people flocked there to pray. The graves at the temple have been visited by a great many people throughout the years since the Genroku era.&lt;ref name = "s91" /&gt; One of those was the Satsuma man who had mocked and spat on Ōishi as he lay drunk in the street. Addressing the grave, he begged for forgiveness for his actions and for thinking that Ōishi was not a true samurai. He then committed suicide and was buried next to the ''rōnin''.&lt;ref name = "Mitford 28" /&gt;

===Re-establishment of the Asano clan's lordship===
Though the revenge is often viewed as an act of loyalty, there had been a second goal, to re-establish the Asanos' lordship and finding a place for their fellow samurai to serve. Hundreds of samurai who had served under Asano had been left jobless, and many were unable to find employment, as they had served under a disgraced family. Many lived as farmers or did simple handicrafts to make ends meet. The revenge of the forty-seven ''rōnin'' cleared their names, and many of the unemployed samurai found jobs soon after the ''rōnin'' had been sentenced to their honorable end.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Asano Daigaku Nagahiro, Naganori's younger brother and heir, was allowed by the Tokugawa shogunate to re-establish his name, though his territory was reduced to a tenth of the original.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Criticism==
The ''rōnin'' spent more than 14 months waiting for the "right time" for their revenge. It was [[Yamamoto Tsunetomo]], author of the ''[[Hagakure]]'', who asked the well known question: "What if, nine months after Asano's death, Kira had died of an illness?" His answer was that the forty-seven ''rōnin'' would have lost their only chance at avenging their master. Even if they had claimed, then, that their dissipated behavior was just an act, that in just a little more time they would have been ready for revenge, who would have believed them? They would have been forever remembered as cowards and drunkards—bringing eternal shame to the name of the Asano clan. The right thing for the ''rōnin'' to do, wrote Yamamoto, was to attack Kira and his men immediately after Asano's death. The ''rōnin'' would probably have suffered defeat, as Kira was ready for an attack at that time—but this was unimportant.&lt;ref name="Yamamoto, T 1979"&gt;[[Yamamoto Tsunetomo|Yamamoto, T.]] (Kodansha, 1979). ''[[Hagakure]]'', p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ōishi was too obsessed with success, according to Yamamoto. He conceived his convoluted plan to ensure that they would succeed at killing Kira, which is not a proper concern in a samurai: the important thing was not the death of Kira, but for the former samurai of Asano to show outstanding courage and determination in an all-out attack against the Kira house, thus winning everlasting honor for their dead master. Even if they had failed to kill Kira, even if they had all perished, it would not have mattered, as victory and defeat have no importance. By waiting a year, they improved their chances of success but risked dishonoring the name of their clan, the worst sin a samurai can commit.&lt;ref name="Yamamoto, T 1979"/&gt;

==In the arts==
{{Main|Chūshingura}}
[[File:Kuranosuke Harakiri no zu.jpg|thumb|260px|Painting of [[Ōishi Yoshio]] committing seppuku]]
The tragedy of the Forty-seven Rōnin has been one of the most popular themes in Japanese art, and has lately even begun to make its way into Western art.

Immediately following the event, there were mixed feelings among the intelligentsia about whether such vengeance had been appropriate. Many agreed that, given their master's last wishes, the ''rōnin'' had done the right thing, but were undecided about whether such a vengeful wish was proper. Over time, however, the story became a symbol of loyalty to one's master and later, of loyalty to the emperor. Once this happened, the story flourished as a subject of drama, storytelling, and visual art.

===Plays===
The incident immediately inspired a succession of ''[[kabuki]]'' and ''[[bunraku]]'' plays; the first, ''The Night Attack at Dawn by the Soga'', appeared only two weeks after the ronin died. It was shut down by the authorities, but many others soon followed, initially in [[Osaka]] and [[Kyoto]], farther away from the capital. Some even took the story as far as [[Manila]], to spread the story to the rest of Asia.

The most successful of the adaptations was a ''[[bunraku]]'' [[puppet]] play called ''[[Kanadehon Chūshingura]]'' (now simply called ''Chūshingura'', or "Treasury of Loyal Retainers"), written in 1748 by Takeda Izumo and two associates; it was later adapted into a ''kabuki'' play, which is still one of Japan's most popular.

In the play, to avoid the attention of the censors, the events are transferred into the distant past, to the 14th century reign of ''shōgun'' [[Ashikaga Takauji]]. Asano became En'ya Hangan Takasada, Kira became [[Kō no Moronao]] and Ōishi became Ōboshi Yuranosuke Yoshio; the names of the rest of the ''rōnin'' were disguised to varying degrees. The play contains a number of plot twists that do not reflect the real story: Moronao tries to seduce En'ya's wife, and one of the ''rōnin'' dies before the attack because of a conflict between family and warrior loyalty (another possible cause of the confusion between forty-six and forty-seven).

===Opera===
The story was turned into an opera, ''Chūshingura'', by [[Shigeaki Saegusa]] in 1997.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Cinema and television===
The play has been made into a movie at least six times in Japan,&lt;ref name="child2007"&gt;Child, Ben. [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/dec/09/keanu-reeves-47-ronin "Keanu Reeves to play Japanese samurai in 47 Ronin",] ''The Guardian'' (London). December 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the earliest starring [[Onoe Matsunosuke]]. The film's release date is questioned, but placed between 1910 and 1917. It has been aired on the Jidaigeki Senmon Channel (Japan) with accompanying ''[[benshi]]'' narration. In 1941, the Japanese military commissioned director [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], who would later direct ''[[Ugetsu]]'', to make ''[[The 47 Ronin (1941 film)|Genroku Chūshingura]]''. They wanted a ferocious morale booster based on the familiar ''rekishi geki'' ("historical drama") of ''The Loyal 47 Ronin''. Instead, Mizoguchi chose for his source ''Mayama Chūshingura'', a cerebral play dealing with the story. The film was a commercial failure, having been released in Japan one week before the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The Japanese military and most audiences found the first part to be too serious, but the studio and Mizoguchi both regarded it as so important that Part Two was put into production, despite lukewarm reception to Part One. The film wasn't shown in America until the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chicagoreader.com/movies/archives/0297/02077.html | title = Movies | publisher = Chicago Reader}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1962 film version directed by [[Hiroshi Inagaki]], ''[[Chushingura: Hana no Maki, Yuki no Maki|Chūshingura]]'', is most familiar to Western audiences.&lt;ref name="child2007"/&gt; In it, [[Toshirō Mifune]] appears in a supporting role as spearman Tawaraboshi Genba. Mifune was to revisit the story several times in his career. In 1971 he appeared in the 52-part television series ''[[Daichūshingura]]'' as Ōishi, while in 1978 he appeared as Lord Tsuchiya in the epic ''[[Swords of Vengeance]]'' (''Akō-jō danzetsu'').

Many Japanese television shows, including single programs, short series, single seasons, and even year-long series such as ''Daichūshingura'' and the more recent NHK [[Taiga drama]] ''Genroku Ryōran'', recount the events of the Forty-seven Rōnin. Among both films and television programs, some are quite faithful to the ''Chūshingura,'' while others incorporate unrelated material or alter details. In addition, ''[[gaiden]]'' dramatize events and characters not in the ''Chūshingura''. [[Kon Ichikawa]] directed [[47 Ronin (1994 film)|another version]] in 1994. In 2004, [[Kōsei Saitō|Mitsumasa Saitō]] directed a 9-episode mini-series starring [[Ken Matsudaira]], who also starred in a 1999 49-episode TV series of the ''Chūshingura'' entitled ''Genroku Ryōran''. In [[Hirokazu Koreeda]]'s 2006 film ''[[Hana (film)|Hana yori mo nao]]'', the events of the Forty-seven Rōnin story were used as backdrop, with one of the ronin being a neighbour of the protagonists.

Most recently, it was made into a 2013 American movie, titled ''[[47 Ronin (2013 film)|47 Ronin]]'', released on December 25, 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1335975/ | title = IMDB: 47 Ronin (2013)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again into a more stylized version titled ''[[Last Knights]]'', released April 3, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2015/04/01/freeman-owen-casualties-of-bloody-bad-last-knights/|title=Freeman, Owen casualties of bloody bad 'Last Knights'|first=Sara|last=Stewart|date=1 April 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Woodblock prints===
The Forty-seven Rōnin is one of the most popular themes in [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]], or ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' and many well-known artists have made prints portraying either the original events, scenes from the play, or the actors. One book on subjects depicted in woodblock prints devotes no fewer than seven chapters to the history of the appearance of this theme in woodblocks. Among the artists who produced prints on this subject are [[Utamaro]], [[Utagawa Toyokuni III|Toyokuni]], [[Hokusai]], [[Kunisada]], [[Hiroshige]], and [[Yoshitoshi]].&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2012). ''Forty-Seven Ronin: Tsukioka Yoshitoshi Edition''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B00ADQGLB8&lt;/ref&gt; However, probably the most widely known woodblocks in the genre are those of [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi|Kuniyoshi]], who produced at least eleven separate complete series on this subject, along with more than twenty [[triptych]]s.

===Literature===
* The earliest known account of the Akō incident in the West was published in 1822 in [[Isaac Titsingh]]'s posthumously-published book ''Illustrations of Japan''.&lt;ref name="s91"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21077">The '''framing effect''' is an example of [[cognitive bias]], in which people react to a particular choice in different ways depending on how it is presented; e.g. as a loss or as a gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plous|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; People tend to avoid risk when a positive frame is presented but seek risks when a negative frame is presented.&lt;ref name=TandK&gt;{{harvnb|Tversky|Kahneman|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gain and loss are defined in the scenario as descriptions of outcomes (e.g., lives lost or saved, disease patients treated and not treated, lives saved and lost during accidents, etc.).

[[Prospect theory]] shows that a loss is more significant than the equivalent gain,&lt;ref name=TandK/&gt; that a sure gain ([[certainty effect]] and [[pseudocertainty effect]]) is favored over a probabilistic gain,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that a probabilistic loss is preferred to a definite loss.&lt;ref name=TandK/&gt; One of the dangers of framing effects is that people are often provided with options within the context of only one of the two frames.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Druckman|2001a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept helps to develop an understanding of [[framing (social sciences)|frame analysis]] within [[social movement]]s, and also in the formation of [[political science|political opinion]] where [[Spin (public relations)|spin]] plays a large role in [[Opinion poll|political opinion polls]] that are framed to encourage a response beneficial to the organization that has commissioned the poll. It has been suggested that the use of the technique is discrediting political polls themselves.&lt;ref name=Druckman2001b&gt;{{harvnb|Druckman|2001b}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is reduced, or even eliminated, if ample credible information is provided to people.&lt;ref name=Druckman2001b/&gt;

==Research==
[[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] explored how different phrasing affected participants' responses to a choice in a hypothetical life and death situation in 1981.&lt;ref name=TandK/&gt;

Participants were asked to choose between two treatments for 600 people affected by a deadly disease. Treatment A was predicted to result in 400 deaths, whereas treatment B had a 33% chance that no one would die but a 66% chance that everyone would die. This choice was then presented to participants either with positive framing, i.e. how many people would live, or with negative framing, i.e. how many people would die.

{|class="wikitable"
|-
!Framing
!Treatment A
!Treatment B
|-
|Positive
|"Saves 200 lives"
|"A 33% chance of saving all 600 people, 66% possibility of saving no one."
|-
|Negative
|"400 people will die"
|"A 33% chance that no people will die, 66% probability that all 600 will die."
|-
|}

Treatment A was chosen by 72% of participants when it was presented with positive framing ("saves 200 lives") dropping to 22% when the same choice was presented with negative framing ("400 people will die").

This effect has been shown in other contexts:
* 93% of PhD students registered early when a penalty fee for late registration was emphasized, with only 67% doing so when this was presented as a discount for earlier registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gächter|Orzen|Renner|Stamer|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 62% of people disagreed with allowing "public condemnation of democracy", but only 46% of people agreed that it was right to "forbid public condemnation of democracy".&lt;ref&gt;Rugg, as cited in {{harvnb|Plous|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* More people will support an economic policy if the employment rate is emphasised than when the associated unemployment rates is highlighted.&lt;ref name=Druckman2001b/&gt;
* It has been argued that [[pretrial detention]] may increase a defendant's willingness to accept a plea bargain, since imprisonment, rather than freedom, will be his baseline, and pleading guilty will be viewed as an event that will cause his earlier release rather than as an event that will put him in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Plea Bargaining outside the Shadow of Trial |first=Stephanos |last=Bibas |journal=[[Harvard Law Review]] |volume=117 |issue=8 |year=2004 |pages=2463–47 |jstor=4093404 |ssrn= 464880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extensionality violation===
In logic, [[extensionality]] requires "two formulas which have the same truth-value under any truth-assignments to be mutually substitutable ''[[salva veritate]]'' in a sentence that contains one of these formulas."&lt;ref name="BG09"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bourgeois-Gironde|first1=Sacha|last2=Giraud|first2=Raphaël|title=Framing effects as violations of extensionality|journal=Theory and Decision|volume=67|issue=4|year=2009|pages=385–404|issn=0040-5833|doi=10.1007/s11238-009-9133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put simply, objects that have the same external properties are equal. This principle, applied to decision making, suggests that making a decision in a problem should not be affected by how the problem is described. For example, varied descriptions of the same decision problem should not give rise to different decisions, due to the extensionality principle. If judgments are made on the bases of irrelevant information as described, that is called an extensionality violation.&lt;ref name="BG09" /&gt;

===Criticism===
Tversky's and Kahneman's research has later been criticized for a subtle difference between the phrasings of the options in the two scenarios. Since the description of treatment A in the positive framing does not explicitly state that 400 people will die, nor does the description of treatment A in the negative framing state that 200 people will live, the probability of these consequences being 100% is only implied. This implication is, however, obvious only if one can familiarize themselves with both framings, as opposed to the respondents who participated in the experiment and saw only one of the framings, either the positive or the negative. In their case, it is possible to assume, with the positive framing, that by choosing the option A, the probability of more than 200 people being saved is greater than zero. Respectively, if introduced only to the negative framing, it is possible to assume that by choosing option A, the probability of more than 400 people dying is greater than zero. According to these assumptions, it would indeed be rational for the respondents to choose A over B when introduced to the positive framing, and B over A when introduced to the negative framing, since the two framings in case of treatment A are not truly mutually substitutable. In other words, the statement "200 of 600 lives will be saved" is not mutually substitutable with the statement "400 of 600 people will die".

==Developmental factors==

The framing effect has consistently proven to be one of the strongest biases in decision making.&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Thomas | first1 = A. K. | last2 = Millar | first2 = P.

L.|last3=An|first3=S. G.|title=The Foreign-Language Effect: Thinking in a Foreign Tongue Reduces Decision Biases|journal=Psychological Science|volume=23|issue=6|year=2012|pages=661–68|issn=0956-7976|doi=10.1177/0956797611432178|pmid=22517192}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation of this disappearance is that a second language provides greater cognitive and emotional distance than one's native tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keysar|first1=Boaz|last2=Hayakawa|first2=Sayuri|last3=An|first3=Sun Gyu|title=The Foreign-Language Effect : Thinking in a Foreign Tongue Reduces Decision Biases|url=http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/foreignLanguaeEffect.pdf|website=University of Chicago: Psychology|publisher=Psychological Science|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A foreign language is also processed less automatically than a native tongue. This leads to more deliberation, which can affect decision making, resulting in decisions that are more systematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keysar|first1=Boaz|last2=Hayakawa|first2=Sayuri|last3=An|first3=Sun Gyu|title=The Foreign-Language Effect : Thinking in a Foreign Tongue Reduces Decision Biases|url=http://psychology.uchicago.edu/people/faculty/foreignLanguaeEffect.pdf|website=University of Chicago: Psychology|publisher=Psychological Science|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood and adolescence===
Framing effects in decision-making become stronger as children age.&lt;ref name=reyna&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Reyna | first1 = V. F. | last2 = Farley | first2 = F. | doi = 10.1111/j.1529-1006.2006.00026.x | title = Risk and Rationality in Adolescent Decision Making: Implications for Theory, Practice, and Public Policy | journal = Psychological Science in the Public Interest | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–44 | year = 2006 | pmid =  26158695| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Albert&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Albert | first1 = D. | last2 = Steinberg | first2 = L. | doi = 10.1111/j.1532-7795.2010.00724.x | title = Judgment and Decision Making in Adolescence | journal = Journal of Research on Adolescence | volume = 21 | page = 211 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Strough&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Strough | first1 = J. | last2 = Karns | first2 = T.

F. | title = A Theory of Medical Decision Making and Health: Fuzzy Trace Theory | doi = 10.1177/0272989X08327066 | journal = Medical Decision Making | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 850–65 | year = 2008 | pmid =  19015287| pmc =2617718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, qualitative reasoning, and thus susceptibility to framing effects, is still not as strong in adolescents as in adults,&lt;ref name=reyna/&gt;&lt;ref name=Strough/&gt; and adolescents are more likely than adults to choose the risky option under both the gain and loss frames of a given scenario.&lt;ref name=Albert/&gt; One explanation for adolescent tendencies toward risky choices is that they lack real-world experience with negative consequences, and thus over-rely on conscious evaluation of risks and benefits,&lt;ref name=Albert/&gt; focusing on specific information and details or quantitative analysis.&lt;ref name=Tring&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schlottmann | first1 = A. | last2 = Tring | first2 = J. | doi = 10.1024/1421-0185.64.3.153 | title = How Children Reason about Gains and Losses: Framing Effects in Judgement and Choice | journal = Swiss Journal of Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | page = 153 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This reduces influence of framing effects and leads to greater consistency across frames of a given scenario.&lt;ref name=Tring/&gt; Children between the ages of 10 and 12 are more likely to take risks and show framing effects, while younger children only considered the quantitative differences between the two options presented.&lt;ref name=Boyer&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Boyer | first1 = T. | title = The development of risk-taking: A multi-perspective review | doi = 10.1016/j.dr.2006.05.002 | journal = Developmental Review | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 291–345 | year = 2006 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Young adulthood===
Younger adults are more likely than older adults to be enticed by risk-taking when presented with loss frame trials.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;

In multiple studies of undergraduate students, researchers have found that students are more likely to prefer options framed positively.&lt;ref name="revlin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cognition: Theory and Practice|last1=Revlin|first1=Russell|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2012|isbn=978-0716756675|location=New York, New York|chapter=Chapter 11: Solving Problems}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2013-04-19--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they are more likely to enjoy meat labeled 75% lean meat as opposed to 25% fat, or use condoms advertised as being 95% effective as opposed to having a 5% risk of failure.&lt;ref name=revlin/&gt;

Young adults are especially susceptible to framing effects when presented with an ill-defined problem in which there is no correct answer and individuals must arbitrarily determine what information they consider relevant.&lt;ref name=revlin/&gt; For example, undergraduate students are more willing to purchase an item such as a movie ticket after losing an amount equivalent to the item's cost than after losing the item itself.&lt;ref name=revlin/&gt;

===Older adulthood===
The framing effect is greater in older adults than in younger adults or adolescents.&lt;ref name=Erber/&gt;&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; This may be a result of enhanced [[negativity bias]],&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; though some sources claim that the negativity bias actually decreases with age.&lt;ref name=carpenter/&gt; Another possible cause is that older adults have fewer cognitive resources available to them and are more likely to default to less cognitively demanding strategies when faced with a decision.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; They tend to rely on easily accessible information, or frames, regardless of whether that information is relevant to making the decision in question.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; Several studies have shown that younger adults will make less biased decisions than older adults because they base their choices on interpretations of patterns of events and can better employ decision making strategies that require cognitive resources like working-memory skills. Older adults, on the other hand, make choices based on immediate reactions to gains and losses.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;

Older adults' lack of cognitive resources, such as flexibility in decision making strategies, may cause older adults to be influenced by emotional frames more so than younger adults or adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Watanabe | first1 = S. | last2 = Shibutani | first2 = H. | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-5884.2010.00432.x | title = Aging and decision making: Differences in susceptibility to the risky-choice framing effect between older and younger adults in Japan | journal = Japanese Psychological Research | volume = 52 | issue = 3 | page = 163 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as individuals age, they make decisions more quickly than their younger counterparts.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt; It is significant that, when prompted to do so, older adults will often make a less biased decision with reevaluation of their original choice.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;&lt;ref name=Erber/&gt;

The increase in framing effects among older adults has important implications, especially in medical contexts.&lt;ref name=Erber/&gt;&lt;ref name=peters/&gt;&lt;ref name=rice/&gt; Older adults are influenced heavily by the inclusion or exclusion of extraneous details, meaning they are likely to make serious medical decisions based on how doctors frame the two options rather than the qualitative differences between the options, causing older adults to inappropriately form their choices.&lt;ref name=thomas/&gt;

When considering cancer treatments, framing can shift older adults' focus from short- to long-term survival under a negative and positive frame, respectively.&lt;ref name=Erber/&gt; When presented with treatment descriptions described in positive, negative, or neutral terms, older adults are significantly more likely to agree to a treatment when it is positively described than they are to agree to the same treatment when it is described neutrally or negatively.&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; Additionally, framing often leads to inconsistency in choice: a change in description qualities after an initial choice is made can cause older adults to revoke their initial decision in favor of an alternative option.&lt;ref name=peters/&gt; Older adults also remember positively framed statements more accurately than negatively framed statements.&lt;ref name=Erber/&gt;&lt;ref name=L&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Löckenhoff | first1 = C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7376">[[File:Double torus illustration.png|thumb|A genus-2 surface]]

In [[mathematics]], '''genus''' (plural '''genera''') has a few different, but closely related, meanings. The most common concept, the genus of an (orientable) surface, is the number of "holes" it has. This is made more precise below.

==Topology==
===Orientable surface===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Complex plane]] --&gt;
[[File:Mug and Torus morph.gif|thumb|Donut or coffee cup?]]
The '''genus''' of a connected, [[orientability|orientable]] [[Surface (topology)|surface]] is an [[integer]] representing the maximum number of cuttings along non-intersecting closed simple [[curve]]s without rendering the resultant [[manifold]] disconnected.&lt;ref&gt;Munkres, James R. Topology. Vol. 2. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; It is equal to the number of [[Handle (mathematics)|handles]] on it. Alternatively, it can be defined in terms of the [[Euler characteristic]] ''χ'', via the relationship ''χ''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2''g'' for closed surfaces, where ''g'' is the genus. For surfaces with ''b'' boundary components, the equation reads ''χ'' =&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2''g''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''b''. In layman's terms, it's the number of "holes" an object has ("holes" interpreted in the sense of doughnut holes; a hollow sphere would be considered as having zero holes in this sense). A doughnut, or torus, has 1 such hole. A sphere has 0. The green surface pictured above has 2 holes of the relevant sort.

For instance:
* The [[sphere]] '''''S''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;''' and a [[disk (mathematics)|disc]] both have genus zero.
* A [[torus]] has genus one, as does the surface of a coffee mug with a handle. This is the source of the joke that "topologists are people who can't tell their donut from their coffee mug."

An explicit construction of surfaces of genus ''g'' is given in the article on the [[fundamental polygon]].
&lt;gallery caption="Genus of orientable surfaces" widths="100px" heights="100px" perrow="6"&gt;
File:Sphere filled blue.svg|genus 0
File:Torus illustration.png|genus 1
File:Double torus illustration.png|genus 2
File:Triple torus illustration.png|genus 3
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In simpler terms, the value of an orientable surface's genus is equal to the number of "holes" it has.&lt;ref&gt;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Genus.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-orientable surfaces===
The '''[[orientability|non-orientable]] genus''', '''demigenus''', or '''Euler genus''' of a connected, non-orientable closed [[Surface (topology)|surface]] is a positive [[integer]] representing the number of [[cross-cap]]s attached to a [[sphere]]. Alternatively, it can be defined for a closed surface in terms of the [[Euler characteristic]] χ, via the relationship χ = 2 − ''k'', where ''k'' is the non-orientable genus.

For instance:
* A [[projective plane]] has non-orientable genus one.
* A [[Klein bottle]] has non-orientable genus two.

===Knot===
The '''[[genus of a knot|genus]]''' of a [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] ''K'' is defined as the minimal genus of all [[Seifert surface]]s for ''K''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Colin |last= Adams|author-link=Colin Adams (mathematician)|title=The Knot Book: An Elementary Introduction to the Mathematical Theory of Knots |publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]]|year=2004|isbn=0-8218-3678-1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Seifert surface of a knot is however a [[manifold with boundary]], the boundary being the knot, i.e.
homeomorphic to the unit circle. The genus of such a surface is defined to be the genus of the two-manifold, which is obtained by gluing the unit disk along the boundary.

===Handlebody===
The '''genus''' of a 3-dimensional [[handlebody]] is an integer representing the maximum number of cuttings along embedded [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]] without rendering the resultant manifold disconnected. It is equal to the number of handles on it.

For instance:
* A [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] has genus zero.
* A solid torus ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; × ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; has genus one.

===Graph theory===
{{Main|Graph embedding}}
The '''genus''' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is the minimal integer ''n'' such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with ''n'' handles (i.e. an oriented surface of genus ''n''). Thus, a [[planar graph]] has genus 0, because it can be drawn on a sphere without self-crossing.

The '''non-orientable genus''' of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is the minimal integer ''n'' such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with ''n'' cross-caps (i.e. a non-orientable surface of (non-orientable) genus ''n'').  (This number is also called the '''demigenus'''.)

The '''Euler genus''' is the minimal integer ''n'' such that the graph can be drawn without crossing itself on a sphere with ''n'' cross-caps or on a sphere with ''n/2'' handles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Graphs on surfaces}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[topological graph theory]] there are several definitions of the genus of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]]. [[Arthur T. White]] introduced the following concept. The [[genus of a group]] ''G'' is the minimum genus of a (connected, undirected) [[Cayley graph]] for ''G''.

The [[Graph embedding#Computational complexity|graph genus problem]] is [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Carsten |last1=Thomassen |title= The graph genus problem is NP-complete |journal= Journal of Algorithms |year=1989 |issue=4 |volume=10 |pages=568&amp;ndash;576 |issn=0196-6774 |doi=10.1016/0196-6774(89)90006-0 | zbl=0689.68071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Algebraic geometry==
There are two related definitions of '''genus''' of any projective algebraic [[Scheme (mathematics)|scheme]] ''X'': the [[arithmetic genus]] and the [[geometric genus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Hirzebruch | first=Friedrich | authorlink=Friedrich Hirzebruch | title=Topological methods in algebraic geometry | others=Translation from the German and appendix one by R. L. E. Schwarzenberger. Appendix two by A. Borel | edition=Reprint of the 2nd, corr. print. of the 3rd | origyear=1978 | series=Classics in Mathematics | location=Berlin | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | year=1995 | isbn=3-540-58663-6 | zbl=0843.14009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When ''X'' is an [[algebraic curve]] with field of definition the [[complex number]]s, and if ''X'' has no [[tangent space|singular points]], then these definitions agree and coincide with the topological definition applied to the [[Riemann surface]] of ''X'' (its [[manifold]] of complex points). For example, the definition of [[elliptic curve]] from algebraic geometry is ''connected non-singular projective curve of genus 1 with a given [[rational point]] on it''.

By the [[Riemann-Roch theorem#Applications|Riemann-Roch theorem]], an irreducible plane curve of degree ''d'' has geometric genus

:&lt;math&gt;g=\frac{(d-1)(d-2)}{2}-s,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s'' is the number of singularities when properly counted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7673">'''Hedda Nussbaum''' (born August 8, 1942) is an American woman who was caretaker for a six-year-old girl who died of [[physical abuse]] in 1987. The death of the girl, Lisa Steinberg, sparked a lengthy and controversial trial and media frenzy.  The legal case was one of the first to be televised "[[gavel]] to gavel."&lt;ref&gt;Fergeson, Robert A. 2008. The Trial in American Life. University of Chicago Press, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters characterized Nussbaum as a victim of horrific [[domestic abuse]] at the hands of her live-in partner, [[Joel Steinberg]]. Critics suggested she was a consensual partner in a [[sado-masochistic]] relationship and an unprosecuted [[conspiracy (criminal)|co-conspirator]] in the young girl's death.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Before meeting [[Joel Steinberg]] in 1975, Nussbaum had been an editor and author of children's books at [[Random House]] publishers, and before that at Appleton Century Crofts. Steinberg was a defense attorney who sometimes handled [[adoption]] cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution-url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0306/16/lkl.00.html |contribution= Interview With Hedda Nussbaum |title= [[Larry King Live]] |date= June 16, 2003 |publisher= [[CNN]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1976, Nussbaum and Steinberg lived together in a [[brownstone]] apartment in [[New York City]]'s [[Greenwich Village]]. Her 1977 book, ''Plants Do Amazing Things'', was dedicated, in part, "to Joel, my everyday inspiration."&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Hedda. Plants Do Amazing Things.  New York, NY: Random House, Inc, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to Nussbaum's occasionally obvious bruises and other injuries, friends and colleagues suspected that Nussbaum was the victim of [[domestic violence]]. Neighbors later stated to police they believed that Nussbaum and Steinberg were active participants in a "some kind of a sexual sadomasochistic game."&lt;ref&gt;Raoul Lionel Felder, Barbara Victor. Getting Away With Murder: weapons for the war against domestic violence. Simon and Schuster, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; Friends occasionally offered to help if Nussbaum was being abused, but she declined their offers of intervention or aid and refused to implicate Steinberg. After extended absences from work, Random House put Nussbaum on consulting editor status in 1982.

In 1981, under dubious legal circumstances, Nussbaum and Steinberg took custody of an infant girl they named Lisa. The girl's birth mother had paid Steinberg a $500.00 legal fee to place the child with a [[Roman Catholic]] family; both Steinberg and Nussbaum were [[Jewish]].&lt;ref&gt;Skaine, Rosemary. 2003. Paternity and American law. McFarland, {{ISBN|0-7864-1411-1}}, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; Under similar circumstances, Nussbaum and Steinberg later took in a toddler they named Mitchell. Nussbaum and Steinberg never legally adopted either child.

In her 2005 book ''Surviving Intimate Terrorism'', Nussbaum argued that her [[denial]] of the danger she and her children lived in was typical of some chronically maltreated persons (see [[battered person syndrome]]). Nussbaum claimed that she fled from the home six times, only to later return. In her 2005 book, Nussbaum also mentions the medical theory that trauma, especially prolonged trauma, can elicit the body's production of opioids that produce mental and physical numbness. In her 2005 book, Nussbaum also suggests that her "numbness" further reduced her ability to think and act clearly, akin to "[[Stockholm Syndrome]]", a mental state wherein victims identify with their abusers.

===Lisa's death and subsequent trial===
According to initial police reports, on November 1, 1987 around 7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., Steinberg rendered Lisa unconscious with a severe blow to the head. Nussbaum remained alone with the dying child for roughly ten hours, failing to notify police or medical personnel. Steinberg departed and returned several times, sometimes [[freebasing]] [[cocaine]]. According to initial police reports, Nussbaum didn't notify authorities because she believed Steinberg had [[supernatural]] healing powers.&lt;ref name="Skaine, p. 87"&gt;Skaine, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; At roughly 6.00 a.m. the next morning, Lisa stopped breathing. Shortly thereafter, Steinberg telephoned [[9-1-1|911]] at Nussbaum's urging.

After Lisa's death, Mitchell was discovered in squalid conditions. The child's birth mother, Nicole Smiegel, had waived her parental rights. However, since a legal adoption had never occurred, Smiegel was ultimately granted custody of her son.

When authorities learned of Lisa's death, they initially charged both Nussbaum and Steinberg with complicity. In the course of the investigation, however, charges were later dropped against Nussbaum. She agreed to testify against Steinberg, and medical examination revealed that Nussbaum was [[anemia|anemic]], [[malnourished]], and suffering from broken bones and chronic infections. With these findings, authorities determined that Nussbaum was physically incapable of seriously wounding Lisa.

Nussbaum's courtroom testimony against Steinberg earned substantial [[mass media|media]] attention, due in part to her face showing obvious evidence of physical trauma. There were also indications, as Nussbaum testified in court, that Lisa had been sexually abused by people outside of her immediate family. During the trial, medical experts testified that while Lisa's injuries were severe, she would have almost certainly survived if given prompt medical treatment.&lt;ref name="Skaine, p. 87"/&gt;

Steinberg was convicted on charges of first-degree [[manslaughter]]. After serving 16 years at the [[Southport Correctional Facility]] in Pine City, New York, where he was held in [[protective custody]], Steinberg was released on parole in 2004 and got a job in construction.

===Later life===
In the years following Lisa's death, Nussbaum worked to rebuild her life and had numerous reconstructive plastic surgeries. She also co-facilitated a support group for battered women for about eight years and later worked as a [[paralegal]] for an organization that assists battered women. In 1995, Nussbaum began giving lectures about abuse at colleges and shelters.  When Steinberg was released from prison, however, she receded from public attention until the publication of her book a year and a half later.

==Analyses==
The Nussbaum case polarized [[feminist]] scholars and activists. Some saw Nussbaum as an [[archetypal]] victim of [[domestic violence]] whose actions were controlled and restricted not only by her abusive partner, but also by the culture at large that denies the seriousness of abuse in the home. Other leading feminists—notably [[Susan Brownmiller]]—suggested that while Nussbaum suffered violence from her partner, she also have shared full culpability for Lisa's death.&lt;ref&gt;Weisberg, D. Kelly. 1996. Applications of feminist legal theory to women's lives: sex, violence, work, and reproduction. Temple University Press, {{ISBN|1-56639-424-4}}, p. 919&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Heidelberg Institute for International Conflict Research''' ('''HIIK''') is an independent and interdisciplinary registered association located at the Department of Political Science at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. Since 1991, the HIIK has been committed to the distribution of knowledge about the emergence, course and settlement of interstate and intrastate political conflicts. The Conflict Barometer is published annually and contains the current research results.

== Conflict Barometer ==
The HIIK's annual publication '''Conflict Barometer''' describes the recent trends in global conflict developments, escalations, de-escalations, and settlements. [[Coup d'état]], attempted coups d'états, as well as implemented measures of conflict resolution are also reported. It is subdivided into five world regions and presents all present conflicts in detailed charts and short descriptions. The methodological approach consists of the conflict definition and the measuring of the conflict intensity.

== Methodology after 2011 ==
Following a methodological revision in 2011, changes in the Heidelberg methodology included allocating intensities not only based on state units and calendar years, but also on the level of subnational units and calendar months. Furthermore, the establishment of intensities now follows an analysis of clearly conceived proxy indicators, used for the assessment of means and consequences of a conflict measure. This analysis continues to be based on the actions of conflict actors, as well as the communication between them. Through the conceptual refinement and standardization of data collection and documentation, the HIIK data achieves a higher degree of precision, reliability, and comprehensibility regarding information on political conflicts.

== Conflict definition ==
A political conflict is a positional difference between at least two assertive and directly involved actors regarding values relevant to a society (the conflict items including (territory, [[secession]], [[decolonization]], [[autonomy]], [[Ideology|system/ideology]], [[national power]], [[regional predominance]], [[international power]], [[Resource (economics)|resources]], other)) which is carried out using observable and interrelated conflict measures that lie outside established regulatory procedures and threaten core state functions, the international order, or hold the prospect of doing so.
	According to the Heidelberg (1998) methodology and ideology, the essence of a political conflict lies in a contradiction, adequately represented by the concept of a “positional difference”: a positional difference is a perceived incompatibility of ideas and beliefs. It presupposes the presence of the following elements:
(1) There must be at least two entities possessing intellectual capacity and vision, and who are capable of communicating. Such an entity is called an actor.
(2) In order for the actors to sense incompatibility between their ideas and beliefs, there must be reciprocal actions and acts of communication between said actors. These actions and acts of communication are called measures.
(3) A communicating act always refers to a specific issue, an action always refers to a certain object. The subject behind a measure is called item.
For the purpose of defining the term political conflict more precisely, the three elements aforementioned shall be further defined. These elements are necessary requirements for the existence of a political conflict.

A threat of force is understood as a verbally or non-verbally communicated prospect of violent measures that is based on the conflict item. An acceptance of the injury of persons is present when the use of force against property includes the possibility of the injury of people but the violator is indifferent to this possibility.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="54063">'''Humanitarian Intervention''' has been defined as a state's use of "military force (publicly stated that its use is for ending the violation of human rights) against another state."&lt;ref name=Mises&gt;Marjanovic, Marko (2011-04-04) [http://mises.org/daily/5160/Is-Humanitarian-War-the-Exception Is Humanitarian War the Exception?], [[Mises Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; This definition may be too narrow as it precludes non-military forms of intervention such as [[humanitarian aid]] and [[international sanctions]]. On this broader understanding, "Humanitarian intervention should be understood to encompass… non-forcible methods, namely intervention undertaken without military force to alleviate mass human suffering within sovereign borders."&lt;ref&gt;Scheffer, David J. “Towards a Modern Doctrine of Humanitarian Intervention.” University of Toledo Law Review Vol 23. (1992): 253-274.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
There is not one standard or legal definition of humanitarian intervention; the field of analysis (such as law, ethics or politics) often influences the definition that is chosen. Differences in definition include variations in whether humanitarian intervention is limited to instances where there is an absence of consent from the host state; whether humanitarian intervention is limited to punishment actions; and whether humanitarian intervention is limited to cases where there has been explicit [[UN Security Council]] authorization for action.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer M. Welsh. ''Humanitarian Intervention and International Relations.'' Ed. Jennifer M. Welsh. New York: Oxford University Press,  2004.&lt;/ref&gt; There is, however, a general consensus on some of its essential characteristics:&lt;ref&gt;Alton Frye. 'Humanitarian Intervention: Crafting a Workable Doctrine.' New York: Council on Foreign Relations, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#Humanitarian intervention involves the threat and use of military forces as a central feature
#It is an intervention in the sense that it entails interfering in the internal affairs of a state by sending military forces into the territory or airspace of a sovereign state that has not committed an act of aggression against another state.
#The intervention is in response to situations that do not necessarily pose direct threats to states' strategic interests, but instead is motivated by humanitarian objectives.

The customary international law concept of humanitarian intervention dates back to [[Hugo Grotius]] and the European politics in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Eaton, Jonah (2011). ''An Emerging Norm - Determining the Meaningand Legal Status of the Responsibility to Protect''. (Michigan Journal of International Law vol. 32, iss. 4 (2010-2011), p. 765-804). “The idea of sovereignty as an instrument for the protection of the life and safety of subjects is at least as old as Hugo Grotius, who made "the first authoritative statement of the principle of humanitarian intervention - the principle that exclusiveness of domestic jurisdiction stops when outrage upon humanity begins."”&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.justsecurity.org/1506/koh-syria-part2/ |author=Koh, Harold Hongju |title=Syria and the Law of Humanitarian Intervention (Part II: International Law and the Way Forward) |publisher=Just Security (justsecurity.org) |date=2 Oct 2013 |accessdate=22 Oct 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subject of humanitarian intervention has remained a compelling foreign policy issue, especially since [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|NATO's intervention in Kosovo in 1999]], as it highlights the tension between the principle of state [[sovereignty]] – a defining pillar of the [[United Nations Organization|UN]] system and [[international law]] – and evolving international norms related to human rights and the use of force.&lt;ref&gt;Shashi Tharoor and Sam Daws. "Humanitarian Intervention: Getting Past the Reefs." ''World Policy Journal'' 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it has sparked normative and empirical debates over its legality, the ethics of using military force to respond to human rights violations, when it should occur, who should intervene,&lt;ref name="WhoShould"&gt;James Pattison, ''Humanitarian Intervention and the Responsibility to Protect: Who Should Intervene?'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and whether it is effective.

To its proponents, it marks imperative action in the face of human rights abuses, over the rights of state sovereignty, while to its detractors it is often viewed as a pretext for military intervention often devoid of legal sanction, selectively deployed and achieving only ambiguous ends. Its frequent use following the end of the [[Cold War]] suggested to many that a new norm of military humanitarian intervention was emerging in international politics, although some now argue that the [[9/11 terrorist attacks]] and the US "[[war on terror]]" have brought the era of humanitarian intervention to an end.&lt;ref&gt;A. Cottey. "Beyond Humanitarian Intervention: The New Politics of Peacekeeping and Intervention." ''Contemporary Politics'' 2008: pp. 429–446.&lt;/ref&gt; James Pattison,&lt;!--Lecturer in Politics at the University of Manchester--&gt; however, argued in 2011 that the NATO intervention in Libya breaks this trend.&lt;ref&gt;James Pattison, “Introduction to Roundtable on Libya, RtoP, and Humanitarian Intervention.” "Ethics &amp; International Affairs" 2011: 251–4. {{doi|10.1017/S0892679411000189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Getting involved in the affairs of another state on humanitarian grounds has been a subject of discussion in [[public international law]] since the 19th century.

According to [[Jonathan Friedman]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]], explicit assertions about humanitarian motives are not a new phenomenon and military action is instead often rationalized through such moral rather than political arguments.&lt;ref name="Friedmanjames"&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2006 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Friedman | first2= Jonathan | title= Globalization and Violence, Vol. 3: Globalizing War and Intervention | url= https://www.academia.edu/3587732/Globalization_and_Violence_Vol._3_Globalizing_War_and_Intervention_editor_with_Jonathan_Friedman_Sage_Publications_London_2006 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xxii}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a pretext for deploying troops in [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Italian Eritrea]] for an intended invasion of [[Ethiopia]], [[Benito Mussolini]] thus claimed that he was attempting to both secure the Wal Wal border area where some Italian soldiers had been killed and abolish the local [[Slavery in Somalia|slave trade]].&lt;ref name="Townley"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Townley|first1=Edward|title=Mussolini and Italy|date=2002|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=0435327259|page=107|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=Y7CIAYPTx2gC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Adolf Hitler]] justified his own forces' occupation of the [[Sudetenland]] by suggesting that they were attempting to quash ethnic tensions in [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="Friedmanjames"/&gt;

[[File:George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron by Richard Westall (2).jpg|thumb|upright|Poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], a [[Philhellenism|Philhellene]] who fought for Greek independence.]]
Possibly the first historical example of a state expressly intervening in the internal affairs of another on the grounds of humanitarian concern was during the [[Greek War of Independence]] in the early 19th century, when [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]] and [[Russia]] decisively intervened in a naval engagement at [[Battle of Navarino|Navarino]] in 1827 to secure for the Greeks independence from the [[Ottoman Empire]].

Popular opinion in England was sympathetic to the Greeks ([[philhellenism]]), in part due to the Greek origin of the West's classical heritage. The renowned poet [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]] even took up arms to join the Greek revolutionaries,  while the London Philhellenic Committee was established to aid the Greek insurgents financially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wynne William H.|year=1951|title=State insolvency and foreign bondholders vol. 2|publisher=Yale University Press|page=284|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/State_Insolvency_and_Foreign_Bondholders.html?id=UdawMddRqaUC&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823, after initial ambivalence, the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[George Canning]] declared that "when a whole nation revolts against its conqueror, the nation cannot be considered as piratical but as a nation in a state of war". In February that same year, he notified the Ottoman Empire that the United Kingdom would maintain friendly relations with the Turks only under the condition that the latter respected the Christian subjects of the Empire. He was also instrumental in the outcome of the St. Petersburg Protocol 1826, in which Russia and Britain agreed to mediate between the Ottomans and the Greeks on the basis of complete autonomy of Greece under Turkish sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Stavrianos, ''The Balkans since 1453'', pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt; When this did not end the War, Canning negotiated a following [[Treaty of London (1827)|treaty]] that ultimately led to the destruction of the Egyptian-Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Navarino]].

[[File:French Expedition in Syria, The Times, Thursday, Aug 09, 1860.png|thumb|left|The 1860 French Expedition to intervene in the [[1860 Druze–Maronite conflict|Druze–Maronite conflict]] was described by ''[[The Times]]'' as stemming from humanitarian motives.]]
The treatment of minorities under the Ottoman aegis proved a rich source of liberal agitation throughout the nineteenth century. A multinational force under French leadership was sent to [[Lebanon]] to help restore peace after the [[1860 Druze–Maronite conflict]], in which thousands of Christian [[Maronite]]s had been massacred by the [[Druze]] population. Following an international outcry, the Ottoman Empire agreed on 3 August 1860 to the dispatch of up to 12,000 European soldiers to reestablish order.&lt;ref name="Chesterman 32"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=DNUPcfTOIJEC&amp;pg=PA32 ''Just war or just peace?: humanitarian intervention and international law'' by Simón Chesterman p.32''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt; This agreement was further formalized in a convention on 5 September 1860 with [[Austria]], [[Great Britain]], [[France]], [[Prussia]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="Chesterman 32"/&gt;

In May 1876 Ottoman troops began [[Batak massacre|massacring]] unarmed agitators for autonomy in [[Bulgaria]], leading to the [[Eastern Question#Great Eastern Crisis|Eastern Crisis]]. The British launched a government investigation into the events, which confirmed that as part of an official policy, the Turks had killed at least 12,000 Bulgarians and obliterated about 60 villages. Lurid reports began to appear in newspapers, especially accounts by the investigative journalist [[William Thomas Stead]] in the [[Northern Echo]], and protest meetings were called across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Freedom_s_Battle.html?id=70g_Vd8AmO8C&amp;redir_esc=y|title=Freedom's Battle: The Origins of Humanitarian Intervention Part 4|author=Bass, Gary J.|year=2008|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Konstantin Makovsky - The Bulgarian martyresses.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''The Bulgarian Martyresses'' (1877), a painting by [[Konstantin Makovsky]], which shocked Europe.]]
Despite the unprecedented demonstration of the strength of public opinion and the media, the Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] remained an unmoved practitioner of ''[[realpolitik]]'', and considered British interests to lie in the preservation of Ottoman sovereignty in [[Eastern Europe]]. [[Lord Derby]] the Foreign Secretary disagreed and telegraphed the [[Sublime Porte]] that "any renewal of the outrages would be more fatal to the Porte than the loss of a battle." Apart from issuing stern advice and proposals for internal Turkish reform and the legal protection of minorities, the Disraeli government did nothing. However, the issue convulsed British politics with former Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]] coming out of retirement to campaign over the atrocities. In a [[Midlothian campaign|famous campaigning speech]] he said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/related/glad.php#sthash.1DqN5a4l.dpbs|title=Gladstone and the Bulgarian Atrocities|author=George Horton}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Let the Turks now carry away their abuses, in the only possible manner, namely, by carrying off themselves. Their Zaptiehs and their Mudirs, their Blmhashis and Yuzbashis, their Kaimakams and their Pashas, one and all, bag and baggage, shall, I hope, clear out from the province that they have desolated and profaned. This thorough riddance, this most blessed deliverance, is the only reparation we can make to those heaps and heaps of dead, the violated purity alike of matron and of maiden and of child; to the civilization which has been affronted and shamed; to the laws of God, or, if you like, of Allah; to the moral sense of mankind at large.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rising Great Power tensions in the early 20th century and the interwar period led to a breakdown in the concerted will of the international community to enforce considerations of a humanitarian nature. Attempts were made under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]] to arbitrate and settle international disputes. Aggressive actions, such as the Italian [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|Invasion of Abyssinia]] and the Japanese occupation of Manchuria were condemned, but the League lacked the resolve to enforce its will effectively. The Allied discovery of [[the Holocaust]] and the subsequent [[Nuremberg trials]] at the end of [[World War II]] caused attitudes to change considerably. After the tragedies in Rwanda and the Balkans in the 1990s, the international community began to  debate how to react to cases in which human rights are grossly and systematically violated. Especially, in his Millenium Report of 2000, then [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[Kofi Annan]], called on Member States: "If humanitarian interention is indeed, an unacceptable assault on sovereignty, how hould we resond to a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica, to gross and systematic violation of human rights that offend every precept of our common humanity?".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/about/bgresponsibility.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; Since the end of the [[Cold War]], interventions have increasingly been used, such as the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] and the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]]. 

===Philosophy of humanitarian intervention===
[[File:PSM V03 D380 John Stuart Mill.jpg|thumb|[[John Stuart Mill]], an early proponent of humanitarian intervention.]]
One of the first champions of the duty of humanitarian intervention to prevent atrocities around the world, was the Victorian [[liberalism|liberal]] [[John Stuart Mill]], who wrote in his 1859 essay ''[[A Few Words on Non-Intervention]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stuart Mill]] (1859) ''[http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=255&amp;search=%22A+Few+Words+On+Non-intervention%22&amp;chapter=21666&amp;layout=html#a_809352 A Few Words on Non-Intervention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106075606/http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php&amp;title=255&amp;search=%22A+Few+Words+On+Non-intervention%22&amp;chapter=21666&amp;layout=html |date=2009-01-06 }}'' at the Online Library of Liberty&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There seems to be no little need that the whole doctrine of non-interference with foreign nations should be reconsidered, if it can be said to have as yet been considered as a really moral question at all... To go to war for an idea, if the war is aggressive, not defensive, is as criminal as to go to war for territory or revenue; for it is as little justifiable to force our ideas on other people, as to compel them to submit to our will in any other respect. But there assuredly are cases in which it is allowable to go to war, without having been ourselves attacked, or threatened with attack; and it is very important that nations should make up their minds in time, as to what these cases are... To suppose that the same international customs, and the same rules of international morality, can obtain between one civilized nation and another, and between civilized nations and [[barbarians]], is a grave error...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Mill's opinion (in 1859) barbarous peoples were found in [[Algeria]] and [[India]] where the [[French colonial empire|French]] and [[British Empire|British]] armies had been involved. Mill's justification of intervention was overt [[imperialism]]. First, he argued that with "barbarians" there is no hope for "reciprocity", an international fundamental. Second, barbarians are apt to benefit from civilized interveners, said Mill, citing Roman conquests of [[Gaul]], [[Spain]], [[Numidia]] and [[Dacia]]. Barbarians,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"have no rights as a nation, except a right to such treatment as may, at the earliest possible period, fit them for becoming one. The only moral laws for the relation between a civilized and a barbarous government, are the universal rules of morality between man and man."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While seeming wildly out of kilter with modern discourse, a similar approach can be found in theory on intervention in [[failed state]]s. Of more widespread relevance, Mill discussed the position between "civilized peoples".

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The disputed question is that of interfering in the regulation of another country’s internal concerns; the question whether a nation is justified in taking part, on either side, in the civil wars or party contests of another: and chiefly, whether it may justifiably aid the people of another country in struggling for liberty; or may impose on a country any particular government or institutions, either as being best for the country itself, or as necessary for the security of its neighbours.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mill brushes over the situation of intervening on the side of governments who are trying to oppress an uprising of their own, saying "government which needs foreign support to enforce obedience from its own citizens, is one which ought not to exist". In the case however of a civil war, where both parties seem at fault, Mill argues that third parties are entitled to demand that the conflicts shall cease. He then moves to the more contentious situation of wars for liberation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When the contest is only with native rulers, and with such native strength as those rulers can enlist in their defence, the answer I should give to the question of the legitimacy of intervention is, as a general rule, No. The reason is, that there can seldom be anything approaching to assurance that intervention, even if successful, would be for the good of the people themselves. The only test possessing any real value, of a people’s having become fit for popular institutions, is that they, or a sufficient portion of them to prevail in the contest, are willing to brave labour and danger for their liberation. I know all that may be said, I know it may be urged that the virtues of freemen cannot be learnt in the school of slavery, and that if a people are not fit for freedom, to have any chance of becoming so they must first be free. And this would be conclusive, if the intervention recommended would really give them freedom. But the evil is, that if they have not sufficient love of liberty to be able to wrest it from merely domestic oppressors, the liberty which is bestowed on them by other hands than their own, will have nothing real, nothing permanent. No people ever was and remained free, but because it was determined to be so...."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Mill's argument for humanitarian intervention, however, is not compatible with modern [[international law]]. International law after World War II establishes the principle of sovereign equality, and therefore to subject a sovereign state to outside intervention is generally considered illegal. To deal with this potential conflict between humanitarian intervention and the international legal system, there are some philosophical attempts to conciliate the two concepts and specify conditions for ethically justified interventions. [[John Rawls]], one of the most influential political philosophers of the twentieth century, offers his theory of humanitarian intervention based on the notion of "well-ordered society." According to Rawls, a well-ordered society should be peaceful and legitimate, and it must respect basic human rights. Between such well-ordered societies, the principle of non-intervention should uphold. On the other hand, expansionist or human rights violating regimes are not shielded from the international law: in grave cases such as ethnic cleansing, coercive intervention by others is legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rawls|first=John|date=Autumn 1993|title=The Law of Peoples|url=|journal=Critical Inquiry|volume=20|pages=36–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martha Nussbaum]], however, is critical of Rawls' approach. She points out that the sufferings of individuals, not those of the impersonal states, form the moral foundations of humanitarian intervention. Therefore, the concept of "well-ordered society," by falsely focusing on the state rather than individuals, cannot determine whether an intervention is justified. Instead, Nussbaum proposes a more concrete standard based on human capabilities (see [[Capability approach]]). She argues that "[n]ational sovereignty should be respected, within the constraints of promoting human capabilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Frontiers of Justice: disability, nationality, species membership|last=Nussbaum|first=Martha|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-674-01917-1|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, if a state fails to provide its citizens the basic "capabilities," such as the capability to live a healthy life, then outside intervention is justified.

Some critics contend that modern philosophical arguments for humanitarian aid fail to recognize the flaws of current international law itself. International Relations scholar [[Martha Finnemore]] argues that humanitarian crises often involve conflict between the most basic principles of international law: sovereignty, human rights and self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moral Limit and Possibility in World Politics|last=Finnemore|first=Martha|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=|editor-last=Price|editor-first=Richard|editor-link=|location=New York|pages=197–224|chapter=Paradoxes in humanitarian intervention}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, philosophical attempts to integrate all those principles into a clear ethical guideline of humanitarian intervention is deemed to be futile. Legal scholar [[Eric Posner]] also points out that countries tend to hold different views of human rights and public good, so to establish a relatively simple set of rules that reflects shared ethics is not likely to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twilight of Human Rights Law|last=Posner|first=Eric|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-931344-0|location=New York|pages=137–148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal grounds==

Humanitarian intervention is a concept that can allow the use of force in a situation when the UN Security Council cannot pass a resolution under [http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-vii/index.html Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations] due to veto by a permanent member. Chapter VII allows the Security Council to take action in situations where there is a "threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of aggression". However, any resolution to that effect must be supported by all five permanent members. The reference to the "right" of humanitarian intervention was, in the post Cold-War context for the first time invoked in 1990 by the UK delegation after Russia and China had failed to support a no-fly zone over Iraq. Therefore, in addition to humanitarian objectives the concept is designed to circumvent the UN Security Council by invoking a right. However, critics base their arguments on the 1648 treaty of Westphalia, which states the rights of sovereign nations to act freely within their own borders. This is upheld in the UN Charter of 1945, where in article 2(7) it is stated that "nothing should authorize intervention in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." Thus, because both proponents and opponents of humanitarian intervention have their legal grounds on the charter of the United Nations, there is still an ongoing controversy as to whether sovereignty or humanitarian causes should prevail. The United Nations has also continuously been involved with issues related to humanitarian intervention, with the UN intervening in an increased number of conflicts within the borders of nations.&lt;ref&gt;To protect sovereignty or to protect lives? (2008, May 15). "The Economist".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current approaches to humanitarian intervention==
Although most writers agree that humanitarian interventions should be undertaken multilaterally, ambiguity remains over which particular agents{{snd}} the UN, regional organizations, or a group of states{{snd}} should act in response to mass violations of human rights. The choice of actor has implications for overcoming collective action challenges through mobilization of political will and material resources.&lt;ref&gt;Sumon Dantiki. "Organizing for Peace: Collective Action Problems and Humanitarian Intervention." ''Journal of Military and Strategic Studies'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Questions of effectiveness, conduct and motives of the intervener, extent of internal and external support, and legal authorization have also been raised as possible criteria for evaluating the legitimacy of a potential intervener.&lt;ref name="WhoShould" /&gt;

===Pragmatic humanitarian intervention===
The most well-known standard for humanitarian intervention after World War II has been [[genocide]]. According to, the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide, the term was defined as acts “committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national ethnic, racial, or religious group.” However, the norm has been challenged. Because there is a high possibility that if the [[international community]] applies the genocide standard to undertake humanitarian intervention, it would have been too late to make a meaningful intervention which should have prevented mass homicide in the concerned country.

These two well-known standards for humanitarian intervention do not resolve the states’ trade-offs between moral responsibilities and potential costs. Furthermore, intervention without a viable plan and workable strategy could threaten the states’ obligation to their own people. It should also be considered, that sometimes humanitarian intervention only results in open-ended chaos in the country without meaningful progress.&lt;ref&gt;Pape, Robert A."When Duty Calls: A Pragmatic Standard of Humanitarian Intervention." International Security, vol. 37 no. 1, 2012, pp. 41-80. Project MUSE, muse.jhu.edu/article/480536.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authorized interventions===
The understanding of what constitutes threats to international peace has been radically broadened since the 1990s to include such issues as mass displacement, and the UN Security Council has authorized use of force in situations that many states would have previously viewed as "internal" conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;Lori Fisler Dmarosch ed. ''Enforcing Restraint: Collective Intervention in Internal Conflicts''. New York: Council on Foreign Relations, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unauthorized interventions===
In several instances states or groups of states have intervened with force, and without advanced authorization from the UN Security Council, at least in part in response to alleged extreme violations of basic human rights. Fairly recent examples include the [[Operation Provide Comfort|intervention after the Gulf War to protect the Kurds in northern Iraq]] as well as [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|NATO's intervention in Kosovo]].

Four distinct attitudes or approaches to the legitimacy of humanitarian intervention in the absence of Security Council authorizations can be identified:&lt;ref&gt;Jane Stromseth. "Rethinking Humanitarian Intervention: The Case for Incremental Change." ''Humanitarian Intervention: Ethical, Legal, and Political Dilemmas''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Status quo'': Categorically affirms that military intervention in response to atrocities is lawful only if authorized by the UN Security Council or if it qualifies as an exercise in the right of self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ellen O'Connell. "The UN, NATO, and International Law after Kosovo." ''Human Rights Quarterly'' 2000: pp. 88–89.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this view, NATO's intervention in Kosovo constituted a clear violation of Article 2(4). Defenders of this position include a number of states, most notably [[Russia]] and the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref&gt;Statements by Russia and China on 24 March 1999, in UN Security Council S/PV.3988.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this approach point to the literal text of the UN Charter, and stress that the high threshold for authorization of the use of force aims to minimize its use, and promote consensus as well as stability by ensuring a basic acceptance of military action by key states. However, [[Kosovo war]] has also highlighted the drawbacks of this approach,&lt;ref&gt;Bruno Simma. "NATO, the UN and the Use of Force: Legal Aspects." ''The European Journal of International Law'' 1999: pp. 1–22&lt;/ref&gt; most notably when effective and consistent humanitarian intervention is made unlikely by the geopolitical realities of relations between the Permanent Five members of the Security Council, leading to the use of the [[veto]] and inconsistent action in the face of a [[humanitarian crises]].
#''Excusable breach'': Humanitarian intervention without a UN mandate is technically illegal under the rules of the UN Charter, but may be morally and politically justified in certain exceptional cases. Benefits of this approach include that it contemplates no new legal rules governing the use of force, but rather opens an "emergency exit" when there is a tension between the rules governing the use of force and the protection of fundamental human rights.&lt;ref name="International Affairs 1999"&gt;Danish Institute of International Affairs. ''Humanitarian Intervention: Legal and Political Aspects''. Submitted to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Denmark, December 7, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon Chesterman. ''Just War or Just Peace? Humanitarian Intervention and International Law''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Intervening states are unlikely to be condemned as law-breakers, although they take a risk of violating rules for a purportedly higher purpose. However, in practice, this could lead to questioning the legitimacy of the legal rules themselves if they are unable to justify actions the majority of the UN Security Council views as morally and politically unjustified.
#''Customary law'': This approach involves reviewing the evolution of customary law for a legal justification of non-authorized humanitarian intervention in rare cases. This approach asks whether an emerging norm of customary law can be identified under which humanitarian intervention can be understood not only as ethically and politically justified but also as legal under the normative framework governing the use of force. However, relatively few cases exist to provide justification for the emergence of a norm, and under this approach ambiguities and differences of view about the legality of an intervention may deter states from acting. The potential for an erosion of rules governing the use of force may also be a point of concern.
#''Codification'': The fourth approach calls for the codification of a clear legal doctrine or "right" of intervention, arguing that such a doctrine could be established through some formal or codified means such as a UN Charter Amendment or UN General Assembly declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Fernando Teson. "The liberal case for humanitarian intervention." ''Humanitarian Intervention: Ethical, Legal, and Political Dilemmas''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Although states have been reluctant to advocate this approach, a number of scholars, as well as the Independent International Commission on Kosovo, have made the case for establishing such a right or doctrine with specified criteria to guide assessments of legality.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Burton. "Legalizing the Sub-Legal: A Proposal for Codifying a Doctrine of Unilateral Humanitarian Intervention." ''Georgetown Law Journal'' 1996: p. 417&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Independent International Commission on Kosovo. ''Kosovo Report''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A major argument advanced for codifying this right is that it would enhance the legitimacy of international law, and resolve the tension between human rights and sovereignty principles contained in the UN charter. However, the historical record on humanitarian intervention is sufficiently ambiguous that it argues for humility regarding efforts to specify in advance the circumstances in which states can use force, without Security Council authorizations, against other states to protect human rights.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Byers and Simon Chesterman. "Changing the Rules about Rules? Unilateral Humanitarian Intervention and the Future of International Law." ''Humanitarian Intervention: Ethical, Legal, and Political Dilemmas''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responsibility to protect===
{{Main article|Responsibility to protect}}

Although usually considered to be categorically distinct from most definitions of humanitarian intervention,&lt;ref&gt;Dorota Gierycz. "From Humanitarian Intervention to Responsibility to Protect." ''Criminal Justice Ethics'' 2010: pp. 110–128&lt;/ref&gt; the emergence of a 'Responsibility to protect' (R2P) deserves mention. Responsibility to Protect is the name of a report produced in 2001 by the [[International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty]] (ICISS) which was established by the [[Canadian government]] in response to Kofi Annan's question of when the international community must intervene for humanitarian purposes. The Canadian government's report, "The Responsibility to Protect," found that the sovereignty not only gave a State the right to "control" its affairs, it also conferred on the State primary "responsibility" for protecting the people within its borders. Also, the report proposed that when a State fails to protect its people - either through lack of ability or a lack of willingness - the responsibility shifts to the broader international community. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/en/preventgenocide/rwanda/about/bgresponsibility.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The report sought to establish a set of clear guidelines for determining when intervention is appropriate, what the appropriate channels for approving an intervention are and how the intervention itself should be carried out.

Responsibility to protect seeks to establish a clearer code of conduct for humanitarian interventions and also advocates a greater reliance on non-military measures. The report also criticises and attempts to change the discourse and terminology surrounding the issue of humanitarian intervention. It argues that the notion of a 'right to intervene' is problematic and should be replaced with the 'responsibility to protect'. Under Responsibility to Protect doctrine, rather than having a right to intervene in the conduct of other states, states are said to have a responsibility to intervene and protect the citizens of another state where that other state has failed in its obligation to protect its own citizens.

This responsibility is said to involve three stages: to prevent, to react and to rebuild. Responsibility to Protect has gained strong support in some circles, such as in Canada, a handful of European and African nations, and among proponents of [[human security]], but has been criticised by others, with some Asian nations being among the chief dissenters.

*[[Obama Doctrine]]

==Examples of military humanitarian intervention==
Potential examples of previous humanitarian interventions include:
* [[Greek War of Independence#Foreign intervention against the Ottomans|Russian, British and French Anti-Ottoman Intervention in the Greek War of Independence]] (1824)
* [[Règlement Organique (Mount Lebanon)|French expedition in Syria]] (1860–1861)
* [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russian Anti-Ottoman Intervention in Bulgaria]] (1877)
* [[Spanish–American War]] (1898)
* [[United States occupation of Haiti]] (1915)
* [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (1964)
* [[Operation Power Pack|US intervention in Dominican Republic]] (1965)
* [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Indian intervention in East Pakistan]] (1971)
* [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|Vietnamese Intervention in Cambodia]] (1978)
* [[Uganda-Tanzania War]] (1979)
* [[Operation Provide Comfort]] ([[Iraq]], 1991)&lt;ref&gt;The UK based its legal justification for the no-flight restrictions on Iraq on humanitarian intervention.  The US based its on UN Security Council Resolution 678.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Unified Task Force]] ([[Somalia]], 1992)
* [[Operation Uphold Democracy]] ([[Haiti]], 1994)
* [[UNAMIR]] ([[Rwanda]], 1994)
* [[UNTAET]] ([[East Timor]], 1999)
* [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] (1999)
* [[British military intervention in the Sierra Leone Civil War]] (2000)
* [[2011 military intervention in Libya|Coalition military intervention in Libya]] (2011)
* [[Military intervention against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (2014–present)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11116792/Are-the-US-led-air-strikes-in-Syria-legal-and-what-does-it-mean-if-they-are-not.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academics have referred to these cases as humanitarian interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Hilpold, Peter, 'Humanitarian Intervention: Is there a Need for a Legal Reappraisal?', ''European Journal of International Law'', 12 (2002), pp. 437–467&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abiew, F. K., ''The Evolution of the Doctrine and Practice of Humanitarian Intervention'', Kluwer Law International (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some cases this is only a retrospective classification of actions that were the result of a variety of motivations. Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia for instance, was justified as self-defense rather than humanitarianism and has only later come to be seen as a  possible example of humanitarian intervention.

==Proponents ==
In “[http://books.wwnorton.com/books/Can-Intervention-Work/ Can Intervention Work?]” [[Rory Stewart]], a British diplomat and politician, and Gerald Knaus, a professor and author, argue that in certain circumstances limited, but resourced interventions for a humanitarian mission can succeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Can_Intervention_Work.html?id=d4yZ5ecu-q8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Can Intervention Work?|last=Stewart|first=Rory|last2=Knaus|first2=Gerald|date=2011-08-15|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=9780393081206|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors co-wrote an introduction at a moment when the international communality was debating whether and how to intervene in [[Libya]], and highlight the West’s history of imperfect interventions. They quote [[Anthony Lake]]’s policy, “to help other nation’s build themselves” as a guiding principal in foreign intervention. The authors are critical of the [[RAND Corporation]] report ''[http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2007/RAND_MG557.pdf Beginner’s Guide to Nation-Building]'' and argue every intervention situation is different based on the local political economy and there is not one universal approach that always works. The rest of the book is divided into two sections: first, Stewart reviews the international experience in [[Afghanistan]] since [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] based on his experience and travel in the country, and second, Knaus provides a case study on the international intervention in [[Bosnian War|Bosnia]]. Overall, the authors warn against “over-interventions” such as [[Iraq War|Iraq]] that were based on “exaggerated fears" and “irrational confidence” and often ignored “local tradition, identity, and history.” Stewart and Knaus advocate an intervention policy based on ““principled incrementalism” that invest time and resources in understanding local context and defining concrete goals.

==Criticism==
Many criticisms have been levied against humanitarian intervention.&lt;ref name=Mises/&gt; Inter-governmental bodies and commission reports composed by persons associated with governmental and international careers have rarely discussed the distorting selectivity of geopolitics behind humanitarian intervention nor potential hidden motivations of intervening parties. To find less veiled criticism one must usually turn to civil society perspectives, especially those shaped by independent scholars who benefit from academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Falk. "Humanitarian Intervention: Elite and Critical Perspectives." ''Global Dialogue'' 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that humanitarian intervention is a modern manifestation of the Western [[colonialism]] of the 19th century; the subjects of such intervention are ruled not by one sole party or entity, but by a mix of local institutions, NGOs and the interveners themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James D.|last2=Laitin|first2=David D.|date=2004-04-01|title=Neotrusteeship and the Problem of Weak States|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1162/0162288041588296|journal=International Security|volume=28|issue=4|pages=5–43|doi=10.1162/0162288041588296|issn=0162-2889}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne Orford]]'s work is a major contribution along these lines, demonstrating the extent to which the perils of the present for societies experiencing humanitarian catastrophes are directly attributable to the legacy of colonial rule. In the name of reconstruction, a capitalist set of constraints is imposed on a broken society that impairs its right of self-determination and prevents its leadership from adopting an approach to development that benefits the people of the country rather than makes foreign investors happy. The essence of her position is that "legal narratives" justifying humanitarian intervention have had the primary effect of sustaining "an unjust and exploitative status quo".&lt;ref&gt;Anne Orford. ''Reading Humanitarian Intervention: Human Rights and the Use of Force in International Law''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that dominant countries, especially the [[United States]] and its coalition partners, are using humanitarian pretexts to pursue otherwise unacceptable geopolitical goals and to evade the non-intervention norm and legal prohibitions on the use of international force. [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Tariq Ali]] are at the forefront of this camp, viewing professions of humanitarian motivation with deep skepticism. They argue that the United States has continued to act with its own interests in mind, with the only change being that humanitarianism has become a legitimizing ideology for projection of U.S. hegemony in a post–Cold War world. Ali in particular argues that [[1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|NATO intervention in Kosovo]] was conducted largely to boost [[NATO]]'s credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky. ''A New Generation Draws the Line: Kosovo, East Timor, and the Standards of the West''. New York: Verso, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tariq Ali. ''Masters of the Universe? NATO's Balkan Crusade''. New York: Verso, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky’s expression of “our excess of righteousness and disinterested benevolence” is often used to describe Kennedy’s invasion of South Vietnam, which spread to all of Indochina. Furthermore, he asserts that the prospective leader of “humanitarian intervention” must uphold several qualifications. A first qualification is that the leader has to work as a [[moral agent]] that does not magnify the danger of elite culture, the efficacy of the intervention should be on the targeted population, and the people must be the moral agents that undertake humanitarian efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky. ''Humanitarian Intervention''. Boston Review: 1993-1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

A third type of criticism centers on the event-based and inconsistent nature of most policies on humanitarian intervention. These critics argue that there is a tendency for the concept to be invoked in the heat of action, giving the appearance of propriety for Western television viewers, but that it neglects the conflicts that are forgotten by the media or occur based on chronic distresses rather than sudden crises. [[Henry Kissinger]], for example, finds that [[Bill Clinton]]'s practice of humanitarian intervention was wildly inconsistent. The US launched two military campaigns against [[Serbia]] while ignoring more widespread [[Rwandan genocide|slaughter in Rwanda]], justifying the [[First Chechen War|Russian assault on Chechnya]], and welcoming to the United States the second-ranking military official of a widely recognized severe human rights violator - the communist government of North Korea.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Kissinger. ''Does America Need a New Foreign Policy?'' New York: Simon and Schuster, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, sceptics have also argued that Humanitarian Intervention may have perverse consequences&lt;ref&gt; Kuperman, A. J. (2008) ‘The Moral Hazard of Humanitarian Intervention: Lessons from The Balkans’ International Studies Quarterly 52, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;. Castan Pinos claims that “humanitarian” interventions generate a multiplicity of collateral effects, including civilian deaths, conflict-aggravation, violence spill-over into neighbouring regions and mutual distrust between great powers&lt;ref&gt; Castan Pinos, J. (2019) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328098617_Kosovo_and_the_Collateral_Effects_of_Humanitarian_Intervention Kosovo and the Collateral Effects of Humanitarian Intervention]. Abingdon: Routledge, pp.178-182 ISBN: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328098617_Kosovo_and_the_Collateral_Effects_of_Humanitarian_Intervention 9781315148014] &lt;/ref&gt;. 

Jeremy Weinstein, a political scientist at Stanford University, has argued for "autonomous recovery": although the number of civilian deaths rises when violence between rebel groups is left unchecked, the eventual victors can develop institutions and set the terms of their rule in a self-enforcing manner. Such self-enforcement reduces the risk of a country slipping back into violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weinstein|first=Jeremy M.|date=2005-04-05|title=Autonomous Recovery and International Intervention in Comparative Perspective|ssrn=1114117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism argues that humanitarian intervention has historically consisted of primarily actions directed by so-called [[Global North|Northern states]] within the internal affairs of so-called [[Global South|Southern states]], and has also led to criticism from many non-[[Western world|Western]] states. These critics argue that the norm of non-intervention and the primacy of sovereign equality is something still cherished by the vast majority of states, which see humanitarian intervention not as a growing awareness of human rights, but a regression to the selective adherence to [[sovereignty]] of the pre–[[UN Charter]] world.&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Hehir. "Institutionalising Impermanence: Kosovo and the Limits of Intervention." ''Global Dialogue'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Havana [[Group of 77|G-77]] summit in 2000, the "so-called right of humanitarian intervention" as it was described, was condemned as having no basis in international law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g77.org/summit/Declaration_G77Summit.htm Declaration of the South Summit, 10–14 April 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in his criticism, Chomsky writes that "Humanitarian interventionism goes only one way - from the powerful to the weak", and condemns what he called the targeting of the concept of national sovereignty by humanitarian interventionists, arguing that the primary purpose of national sovereignty is to give weak states partial protection against strong states, and that the protection of national sovereignty under international law stops internal conflicts in weak countries being exploited by strong ones.&lt;ref&gt;Noam Chomsky, ''A New Generation Draws the Line'', 2015 edition, page V, VI.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Interactional linguistics''' is an interdisciplinary approach to [[grammar]] and [[Interactivity|interaction]] in the fields of [[linguistics]], the [[sociology of language]], and [[anthropology]]. [[Paul Hopper]] originally  proposed '''emergent grammar''' as a [[functional theories of grammar|functional]] approach to the study of [[syntax]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://home.eserver.org/hopper/emergence.html |last=Hopper |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Hopper |year=1987 |title=Emergent Grammar |journal=Berkeley Linguistics Society |volume=13 |pages=139–157 |accessdate=2008-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918233214/http://home.eserver.org/hopper/emergence.html |archivedate=September 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later work expanded to include approaches to [[phonology]] and other aspects of grammar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Couper-Kuhlen |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Selting |first2=Margaret |year=1996 |title=Prosody in Conversation: Interactional Studies |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emergent grammar postulates that rules of grammar emerge as language is used. This is contrary to the ''a priori grammar postulate'', the idea that grammar rules exist in the mind before the production of utterances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopper|first=Paul|year=1988|chapter=Emergent Grammar and the A Priori Grammar Postulate|title=Linguistics in Context|editor=Deborah Tannen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the principles of [[generative grammar]] and the concept of [[Universal Grammar]], interactional linguistics asserts that grammar emerges from interactions among language users.&lt;ref name="Su"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Su|first=Danjie|year=2016|url=http://dis.sagepub.com/content/18/3/330.full.pdf+html |title=Grammar emerges through reuse and modification of prior utterances|journal=Discourse Studies|volume=18|issue=3|pages=330-353}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas Universal Grammar claims that features of grammar are innate,&lt;ref name="hornstein"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hornstein|first1=Norbert|first2=Jairo |last2=Nunes|first3=Kleanthes K. |last3=Grohmann |year=2005|title=Understanding Minimalism|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; emergent grammar and other interactional theories claim that the human language faculty has no innate grammar and that features of grammar are learned through experience and social interaction.&lt;ref name="Su" /&gt;

Interactional linguistics has developed in linguistic [[discourse analysis]] and [[conversation analysis]], and is used to investigate the relationship between grammatical structure and real-time interaction and language use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fox | first=Barbara | title=Principles shaping grammatical practices: an exploration | journal=Discourse Studies | year=2007 | url=http://dis.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/9/3/299 | accessdate=2008-10-16 | volume=9 | pages=299 | doi=10.1177/1461445607076201 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars in interactional linguistics draw from functional linguistics, conversation analysis, and [[linguistic anthropology]] in order to describe "the way in which language figures in everyday interaction and cognition."&lt;ref name=OST1996&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ochs|first1=Elinor|last2=Schegloff |first2=Emanuel |last3=Thompson |first3=Sandra |year=1996 |title=Interaction and Grammar |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies in interactional linguistics view linguistic forms, including syntactic and prosodic structures, as greatly affected by interactions among participants in speech, [[Sign language|signing]], or other language use. The field contrasts with dominant approaches to linguistics during the twentieth century, which tended to focus either on the form of language per se, or on theories of individual language user's [[linguistic competence]].&lt;ref name=CKS2001&gt;{{cite book|last1=Couper-Kuhlen |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Selting |first2=Margaret |year=2001 |title=Studies in Interactional Linguistics |publisher=John Benjamins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islam|history}}
'''Islam and modernity''' is a topic of discussion in contemporary [[sociology of religion]]. The [[history of Islam]] chronicles different interpretations and approaches.  [[Modernity]] is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon rather than a unified and coherent one.  It has historically had different schools of thought moving in many directions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Responsibilities of the Muslim Intellectual in the 21st Century'', [[Abdolkarim Soroush]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industrial Revolution's impact on Islam ==

In the 18th century [[Europe]] was undergoing major transformations as the new ideas of [[the Enlightenment]], which stressed the importance of science, rationality, and human reason, and the new technologies of the [[Industrial Revolution]] swept across Europe, giving Europeans great power and influence. In the last quarter of the 18th century, the gap widened between the technical skills of some western and northern European countries and those of the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hourani | first1 = Albert | title = A History of the Arab Peoples | year = 1991 | pages = 259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of modern Europe coincided with what many scholars refer to as the decline of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which by the 18th century was facing political, military, and economic breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Esposito | first1 = Jonh L. | title = Islam: The Straight Path | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | pages = 115–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; While prior to the 18th century the Ottomans had regarded themselves to be either of superior or, by the mid-18th century, of equal strength to Europe, by the end of the 18th century the power relationship between the Ottoman Empire and Europe began to shift in Europe's favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hourani | first1 = Albert | title = A History of the Arab Peoples | year = 1991 | pages = 258–259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French occupation of the Ottoman Empire===
In 1798 [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army occupied the Ottoman province of [[Egypt]] and killed roughly 3000 Egyptians. Although the occupation was only three years, followed by lingering hostility to the French, the experience ultimately exposed the Egyptian people to Enlightenment ideas and Europe's new technology.&lt;ref name="The Arabs: A History"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rogan | first1 = Eugene | title = The Arabs: A History | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2009 | pages = 62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman scholars in Europe===
The exposure to European power and ideas would later inspire the new governor of Egypt, [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], to draw on this technology to modernize Egypt, setting an example for the rest of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman government began to open [[embassies]] and send officials to study in Europe. This created conditions for the "gradual formation of a group of reformers with a certain knowledge of the modern world and a conviction that the empire must belong to it or perish".&lt;ref name="AH1983: 43"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: p.43&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the scholars sent by Muhammad Ali to Europe in 1826 was [[Rifa'a el-Tahtawi|Rifa'a Rafi' al-Tahtawi]]. The five years he spent in [[Paris]] left a permanent mark on him. After his return to Egypt he wrote about his impressions of France and translated numerous European works into [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. Tahtawi was impressed with Europe's technological and scientific advancement and political philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rogan | first1 = Eugene | title = The Arabs: A History | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2009 | pages = 86–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having studied [[Islamic Law]], he argued that "it was necessary to adapt the [[Sharia]] to new circumstances" and that there was not much difference between "the principles of Islamic law and those principles of 'natural law' on which the codes of modern Europe were based".&lt;ref name="AH1983: 75"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: p.75&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Tahtawi, Khayr al-Din was also sent to Paris where he spent four years. After his return from Europe he wrote a book in which he argued that the only way to strengthen the Muslim States was by borrowing ideas and institutions from Europe, and that this did not contradict the spirit of the Sharia.&lt;ref name="AH1983: 88"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: pp.88&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modernization reforms in the Ottoman Empire ===
In the period between 1839 and 1876 the Ottoman government began instituting large-scale reforms as a way to modernize and strengthen the empire.{{clarify||This subsection needs work. Since the Empire was widely called "The Sick Man of Europe" the reforms didn't work. So an analyst needs to tell us why|date=December 2010}} Known as the [[Tanzimat]], many of these reforms involved adopting successful European practices that were considered antithetical to conservative Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rogan | first1 = Eugene | title = The Arabs: A History | publisher = Basic Books | year = 2009 | pages = 90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to military and administrative reforms, Ottoman rulers implemented reforms in the sphere of education, law, and the economy. This included new universities and changes in curricula, as well new economic systems and institutions. There were also European-inspired changes to law that restricted Islamic law to family affairs such as marriage and inheritance.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esposito|first1=John L., |chapter="Contemporary Islam" |title=The Oxford History of Islam|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/book/islam-9780195107999/islam-9780195107999-chapter-15 |editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford Islamic Studies Online|accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Ottoman Empire]] was the first{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Muslim country]] where modernity surfaced, with major shifts in scientific and legal thought.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 970"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.970&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1834, [[Ishak Efendi]] published ''Mecmua-i Ulum-i Riyaziye'', a four volume text introducing many modern scientific concepts to the Muslim world. [[Kudsi Efendi]] also published ''Asrar al-Malakut'' in 1846 in an attempt to reconcile [[Copernican revolution|Copernican astronomy]] with Islam. The first modern Turkish chemistry text was published in 1848, and the first modern Biology text in 1865.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 971"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.971&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the Turks adopted the metric system in 1869. These shifts in scientific thought coincided with [[Tanzimat]], a reform policy undertaken by the Sultans of the Ottoman Empire that was inspired by French [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. This reform confined [[sharia]] to family law.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 970"/&gt; The key figure in the Turkish modernist movement was [[Namik Kemal]], the editor of a journal called ''Freedom''. His goal was to promote [[freedom of the press]], the [[separation of powers]], [[equality before the law]], scientific freedom, and a reconciliation between [[parliamentary democracy]] and the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name="PW2001: 970"/&gt;

===The Greater Muslim world===
The influence of modernism in the Muslim world resulted in a cultural revival.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 973"/&gt; Dramatic plays became more common, as did newspapers. Notable European works were analyzed and translated.

Legal reform was attempted in Egypt, Tunisia, the Ottoman Empire, and Iran, and in some cases these reforms were adopted.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 974"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.974&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts were made to restrict the power of government. Polygamy was ended in India.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 975"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.975&lt;/ref&gt; Azerbaijan granted suffrage to women in 1918 (before several European countries).&lt;ref name="PW2001: 975"/&gt;

At the recommendations of reform-minded Islamic scholars, western sciences were taught in new schools.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 974"/&gt; Much of this had to do with the intellectual appeal of [[social Darwinism]], since it led to the conclusion that an old-fashioned Muslim society could not compete in the modern world.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 974"/&gt;

In 19th century [[Iran]], [[Mirza Malkom Khan]] arrived after being educated in [[Paris]]. He created a newspaper called ''Qanun'', where he advocated the [[separation of powers]], secular law, and a [[bill of rights]].&lt;ref name="PW2001: 971"/&gt; [[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]], who was politically active in the Islamic world and published the pamphlet "Al-'Urwa al-Wuthqà" during a brief spell in France, proclaiming that Europe had become successful due to its laws and its science. He became critical of other Muslim scholars for stifling scientific thought,&lt;ref name="PW2001: 972"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.972&lt;/ref&gt; and hoped to encourage scientific inquiry in the [[Muslim world]].

== Modernism, religion and ideology==
 {{Aqidah|Five Pillars}}

===Islamic Modernism===
{{main article|Islamic Modernism}}
Modernism impacted interpretations of Islam. One movement was Islamic Modernism, which was both an attempt to provide an Islamic response to the challenges presented by European colonial expansion, and an effort to reinvigorate and reform Islam from within as a way to counter the perceived weakness and decline of Muslim societies in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It called for "a 'reformation' or reinterpretation ([[ijtihad]]) of Islam", and emerged in the Muslim world from Egypt to Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt;

Islamic modernists argued that Islam and modernity were compatible and "asserted the need to reinterpret and reapply the principles and ideals of Islam to formulate new responses to the political, scientific, and cultural challenges of the West and of modern life".&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt; The reforms they proposed challenged the status quo maintained by the conservative Muslims scholars ([[ulama]]), who saw the established law as the ideal order that had to be followed and upheld the doctrine of [[taqlid]] (imitation / blind following). Islamic modernists saw the resistance to change on the part of the conservative ulama as a major cause for the problems the Muslim community was facing as well as its inability to counter western hegemony.

====Modernists====
[[Jamal al-Din al-Afghani]] (1838–1897) is regarded as one of the pioneers of Islamic modernism. He believed that Islam was compatible with science and reason and that in order to counter European power the Muslim world had to embrace progress.&lt;ref name="AH1983: 103–129"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: pp.103–129&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad Abduh]] (1849–1905) was a disciple and collaborator of al-Afghani. He was even more influential than his master and is often referred to as the founder of Islamic modernism. Abduh was born and raised in Egypt and was a scholar of Islam (alim). He taught at [[al-Azhar]] and other institutions and in 1899 became [[Mufti]] of Egypt. Abduh believed that the Islamic world was suffering from an inner decay and was in need of a revival.&lt;ref name="AH1983: 136"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: p.136&lt;/ref&gt; Asserting that "Islam could be the moral basis of a modern and progressive society",&lt;ref name="AH1983: 140"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: p.140&lt;/ref&gt; he was critical of both [[secularists]] and the conservative ulama. He called for a legal reform and the reinterpretation (ijtihad) of Islamic law according to modern conditions. While critical of the West, he believed that it was necessary to borrow or assimilate what was good from it.&lt;ref name="AH1983: 156"&gt;[[#AH1983|Albert, ''Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age'', 1983]]: p.156&lt;/ref&gt;  Abduh became a leading judge in [[Egypt]] after political activities in Paris as al-Afghani's assistant. He pushed for secular law, religious reform, and education for girls.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 972"/&gt; He hoped that Egypt would ultimately become a free republic, much like how France had transformed from an absolute monarchy.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 973"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.973&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muhammad Rashid Rida]] (1869–1935) also became active in the Egyptian modernization movement as Abduh's disciple, although he was born and educated in [[Syria]]. ''Al-Manar'' was his journal, through which he initially advocated greater openness to science and foreign influence.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 973"/&gt; He also stated that sharia was relatively silent about agriculture, industry, and trade, and that these areas of knowledge needed renewal.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 973"/&gt; He would eventually evolve to conservative positions close to Wahhabism. [[Qasim Amin]] was another reformer in Egypt and Abduh's disciple who was heavily concerned with the rights of women.

Khayr al-Din al-Tunisi was similarly educated in Paris around the same time. He surveyed the political systems of 21 European countries in an effort to reform [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="PW2001: 971"/&gt;

Notable Modernists on the Indian subcontinent include [[Sayyid Ahmad Khan]] (1817–1898) and [[Muhammad Iqbal]] (1877–1938) in the Indian subcontinent (the latter was also the conceiver of the modern state of [[Pakistan]]). Like al-Afghani and Abduh, they rejected the doctrine of taqlid and asserted the need for Islam to be reinterpreted according to modern conditions.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt;

Other Modernists include [[Mahmud Tarzi]] of [[Afghanistan]], [[Chiragh Ali]] of [[India]], [[Ahmad Dahlan]] of [[Java]], and [[Wang Jingzhai]] of [[China]].&lt;ref name="PW2001: 971"/&gt;

Although Islamic modernists were subject to the criticism that the reforms they promoted amounted to westernizing Islam, their legacy was significant and their thought influenced future generations of reformers.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt;

==== Pakistan and Turkey ====

[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], the founder of [[Pakistan]], was also a prominent Muslim modernist of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dawn.com/2012/12/25/muslim-modernism-and-jinnah/|title=Muslim modernism and Jinnah|work=Dawn|date=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistanarmy.gov.pk/awpreview/pDetails.aspx?pType=PressRelease&amp;pID=82|title=Jinnah's vision of Pakistan|work=Pakistan Army|accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Islamism sidebar|Manifestations}}
In some parts of the world, the project of Islamic modernity continued from the same trajectory before World War I. This was especially the case in the new [[Republic of Turkey]], under [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. But in Egypt, [[Hassan al-Banna]] founded the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], the first [[Islamist]] organization, which had no interest in reinterpreting Islam to make it compatible with modernity.

Turkey has continued to be at the forefront of modernising Islam. In 2008 its Department of Religious Affairs launched a review of all the [[hadith]]s, the sayings of [[Mohammed]] upon which most of [[sharia|Islamic law]] is based. The School of Theology at [[Ankara University]] undertook this forensic examination with the intent of removing centuries of often conservative cultural baggage and rediscovering the spirit of reason in the original message of Islam. One expert at London's [[Chatham House]] compared these revisions to the Christian [[Protestant Reformation]]. Turkey has also trained hundreds of women as theologians, and sent them senior [[imam]]s known as ''vaizes'' all over the country, away from the relatively liberal capital and coastal cities, to explain these re-interpretations at town hall meetings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7264903.stm "Turkey in radical revision of Islamic texts"]  Robert Pigott, Religious affairs correspondent, [[BBC News]], 26 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After World War I ===
The aftermath of [[World War I]] resulted in the [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|fall of the Ottoman Empire]] and the [[History of the middle east#European domination|domination]] of the Middle East by European powers such as Britain and France. Intellectual historians such as [[Peter Watson (intellectual historian)|Peter Watson]] suggest that World War I marks the end of the main Islamic modernist movements, and that this is the point where many Muslims "lost faith with the culture of science and materialism",&lt;ref name="PW2001: 1096"&gt;[[#PW2001|Watson, ''The Modern Mind'', 2001]]: p.1096&lt;/ref&gt; but that several parallel intellectual streams emerged thereafter.

=== Arab socialism ===
{{Main article|Arab socialism}}

[[Arab socialism]] of the [[Baath Party|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] and [[Nasserism|Nasserite]] movement emerged as a stream of thought during decolonialization of Arab countries. It emphasized ethnicity, culture, politics and played down the role of religion.&lt;ref name="PW2001: 1096"/&gt; Its popularity peaked in the 50s and 60s.

As a political ideology based on an amalgamation of [[Pan-Arabism]] and socialism, Arab socialism is distinct from the much broader tradition of socialist thought in the Arab world which predates Arab socialism by as much as 50 years. [[Michel Aflaq]], the principal founder of ba'athism and the Ba'ath Party, coined the term in order to distinguish his version of socialist ideology from the [[Marxism|Marxist socialism]] in Eastern Europe and Eastern Asia, and [[social democracy]] in Western Europe.

The [[Six-Day War]] between [[Israel]] and its neighbours ended in a decisive loss for the Muslim side. Many in the Islamic world saw this as the failure of socialism. It was at this point that "fundamental and militant Islam began to fill the political vacuum created".&lt;ref name="PW2001: 1096"/&gt;

=== Islamic fundamentalism ===
{{Further information|Islamic revival}}

In the late 20th century an Islamic Revival or Islamic Awakening developed in the [[Muslim World]]. (Islamic fundamentalism is the common term in the West used to refer to contemporary Islamic revivalism, according to John Esposito.&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;{{cite web|last1=Esposito|first1=John L.|title=Islamic Fundamentalism|url=http://www.notredamedesion.org/en/dialogue_docs.php?a=3b&amp;id=16|website=Notre Dame de Sion|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

It was manifested in greater religious piety and in a growing adoption of [[Islamic culture]].&lt;ref name="Lapidus 11"&gt;Lapidus, p.823&lt;/ref&gt; One striking example of it is the increase in attendance at the ''[[Hajj]]'', the annual pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], which grew from 90,000 in 1926 to 2 million in 1979.&lt;ref name=Kepel-75&gt;Kepel, Gilles, ''Jihad: on the Trail of Political Islam'', Harvard University Press, 2002, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; But the said increase in the number of pilgrims may also be attributed to other factors such as increase in populations, modern transportation facilities and to some extent the over all financial prosperity of the Muslims all over the world thus making the Pilgrimage affordable to more and more Muslim populations.

Two of the most important events that fueled or inspired the resurgence were the [[1973 oil crisis|Arab oil embargo]] and subsequent quadrupling of the price of oil in the mid-1970s, and the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] that established an [[Islamic republic]] in [[Iran]] under [[Ayatollah]] [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]]. The first created a flow of many billions of dollars from [[Saudi Arabia]] to fund Islamic books, scholarships, fellowships, and [[mosque]]s around the world; the second undermined the assumption that [[Westernization]] strengthened [[List of Muslim majority countries|Muslim countries]] and was the irreversible trend of the future.&lt;ref name=Kepel-75/&gt;

The revival is a reversal of the Westernisation approach common in Arab and Asian governments earlier in the 20th century. It is often associated with the political Islamic movement, [[Islamism]], and other forms of [[Islamization|re-Islamisation]]. While the revival has also been accompanied by some religious extremism and attacks on civilians and military targets by the extremists, this represents only a small part of the revival.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;!-- per the IP editor --&gt;

The revival has also seen a proliferation of [[Islamic extremist groups]] in the [[Middle East]] and elsewhere in the Muslim World, who have voiced their anger at perceived exploitation as well as  materialism, Westernization, [[democracy]] and modernity, which are most commonly associated with accepting Western secular beliefs and values. The spread of secularism has caused great concerns among many [[Islamic political groups]]. It has been the reasoning for the Islamization of politics and protest, due to the large Muslim majority in the Middle East as well as the region's imperial past.&lt;ref&gt;Fawcett, L (2005) ''International Relations of the Middle East'', UK: Oxford University Press, p 72&lt;/ref&gt; For Islamic countries in the Middle East, there is not necessarily a problem as such with modernity, however, "the problem is when modernity comes wrapped with westernization, with absolutely and utterly rampant materialism".&lt;ref&gt;BBC News online, ''Islam and the West'', Monday, 12 August 2002, 14:11 GMT 15:11 UK&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, ''Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World'' (1994), the author N. Ayubi explained what he believes to be the two main concerns of Islamic political movements and extremist groups in the Middle East; 1) the Western belief in a bureaucratic state and 2) the secular values and beliefs associated with concepts such as modernity.&lt;ref&gt;Ayubi, N. N. M. (1994) ''Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World'', London: Routledge p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

According to John Esposito:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The tendency to judge the actions of Muslims in splendid isolation, to generalize from the actions of the few to the many, to disregard similar excesses committed in the name of other religions and ideologies ... is not new.&lt;ref&gt;Milton-Edwards, B(1999) ''Islamic Politics in Palestine'', UK: I. B. Tauris &amp; Co Ltd, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The number of militant Islamic movements calling for "an Islamic state and the end of Western influence" is relatively small.&lt;ref&gt;Ayubi, N. N. M. (1994) ''Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World'', London: Routledge p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; According to polls taken in 2008 and 2010 by Pew and Gallop, pluralities of the population in Muslim-majority countries are undecided as to what extent religion (and certain interpretations of) should influence public life, politics, and the legal system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/press/109693/Islam-Democracy.aspx/ "Islam and Democracy"]"Gallup Poll", February 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewglobal.org/2010/12/02/muslims-around-the-world-divided-on-hamas-and-hezbollah/ "Most Embrace a Role for Islam in Politics, Muslim Publics Divided on Hamas and Hezbollah"]. Pew Research Center, December 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lange model''' (or '''Lange–Lerner theorem''') is a [[Neoclassical economics|neoclassical economic]] model for a hypothetical socialist economy based on public ownership of the [[means of production]] and a trial-and-error approach to determining output targets and achieving [[economic equilibrium]] and [[Pareto efficiency]]. In this model, the state owns non-labor factors of production, and markets allocate final goods and consumer goods. The Lange model states that if all production is performed by a public body such as the state, and there is a functioning price mechanism, this economy will be Pareto-efficient, like a hypothetical [[market economy]] under [[perfect competition]]. Unlike models of capitalism, the Lange model is based on direct allocation, by directing enterprise managers to set price equal to [[marginal cost]] in order to achieve Pareto efficiency. By contrast, in a capitalist economy managers are instructed to maximize profits for private owners, while competitive pressures are relied on to indirectly lower the price to equal marginal cost.

This model was first proposed by [[Oskar R. Lange]] in 1936 during the [[socialist calculation debate]], and was expanded by economists like H. D. Dickinson, [[Abba P. Lerner]] and [[Fred M. Taylor]]. Although Lange and Lerner called it "[[market socialism]]", the Lange model is a form of planned economy where a central planning board allocates investment and capital goods, while markets allocate labor and consumer goods. The planning board simulates a market in capital goods by a trial-and-error process first elaborated by [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Léon Walras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/03085149800000027| title = Socialism against markets? A critique of two recent proposals| journal = Economy and Society| volume = 27| issue = 4| pages = 407–433| year = 1998| last1 = Hodgson | first1 = G. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lange model has never been implemented anywhere, not even in Oskar Lange's home country, [[Poland]], where [[Soviet-type economic planning]] was imposed after World War II, precluding experimentation with Lange-style economy.&lt;ref name="Post-Lange Socialism: An Evaluation of Profit-Oriented Proposals, 1995"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yunker | first1 = James A. | year = 1995 | title = Post-Lange Market Socialism: An Evaluation of Profit-Oriented Proposals | journal = Journal of Economic Issues | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 683–717 | publisher =  | jstor = 4226984 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = | doi=10.1080/00213624.1995.11505705}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parallels might be drawn with the [[New Economic Mechanism]] or so-called [[Goulash Communism]] in [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] under [[János Kádár|Kádár]], although this was not a pure Lange-model system.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Thomas. "The Lessons of Limited Market-Oriented Reform" (1991), The Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 5, No. 4 (Autumn, 1991), pp. 45-58&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The model is sometimes called the "Lange–Lerner" model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bator|first=Francis M.|title=The Anatomy of Market Failure|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|date=August 1958|volume=72|issue=3|pages=351–379|jstor=1882231|doi=10.2307/1882231}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abba Lerner]] wrote a series of articles that greatly influenced Lange's thinking. For example, Lerner (1938) caused Lange to re-write his 1936 and 1937 articles on [[market socialism]], before they were re-published as chapters in a 1938 book. Lerner (1938) influenced Lange's thinking on [[social dividend]] payments. Lerner (1944) also argued that investment in the Lange model would inevitably be politicized.

The Lange model was developed in response to [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]]'s [[criticisms of socialism]] during the [[socialist calculation debate]]. The critics argued that any body that owns and consolidates a society's means of production cannot acquire the information needed to calculate general equilibrium prices, and that market-determined prices were essential for the rational allocation of producer goods. The Lange model contains principles proposed by neoclassical economists [[Vilfredo Pareto]] and [[Léon Walras]]. Lange's theory emphasizes the idea of Pareto efficiency: a situation is Pareto-efficient if there is no way to rearrange things to make any individual better off without making anyone worse off. To achieve Pareto efficiency, a set of conditions must be formulated in stages. This idea of deriving conditions to ensure that consumer preferences are in balance with the maximum amount of goods and services produced is emphasized by Walras. The theorem indicates that a socialist economy based on public ownership could achieve one of the principal economic benefits of capitalism - a rational price system - and was an important theoretical force behind the development of the concept of [[market socialism]].

== Basic principles ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
[[File:Lange_model_diagram.svg|alt=|thumb|367x367px|A chart to show how the model would hypothetically function.]]
{{Economics sidebar}}
The Lange model suggests three levels of decision-making. The lowest level contains firms and households, the intermediate level contains industrial ministries, and the highest level is the central planning board. The board sets the initial price of consumer goods arbitrarily and informs the producing firms of these prices.  The state-owned firms then produce at the level of output where [[marginal cost]] equals price, P = MC, so as to minimize the cost of production. At the intermediate level, industrial ministries determine the sectoral expansion of industry.  Households decide how to allocate income and how much labor to supply by choosing between work and leisure.

=== Institutions ===
The key institutions of the Lange model include the central planning board (CPB), industrial ministries for each economic sector, and state enterprises [[Workplace democracy|managed democratically]] by their employees.

=== Trial-and-error price adjustments ===
Because prices are set by the central planning board "artificially" aiming to achieve planned growth objectives, it is unlikely that supply and demand will be in equilibrium at first. To produce the correct amount of goods and services, the Lange model suggests a trial-and-error method. If there is a surplus of a particular good, the central planning board lowers the price of that good. Conversely, if there is a shortage of a good, the board raises the price. This process of price adjustments takes place until equilibrium between supply and demand is achieved.

=== Central planning board ===
The central planning board (CPB) has three major functions in the Lange model: First it instructs firms to set price to equal marginal cost, secondly it adjusts prices to attain market-clearing prices for goods and services, and finally, it reinvests the economic profit derived from state enterprises into the economy based on a target rate of growth. The central planning board also distributes social dividends to the population.

=== Social dividend ===
Apart from setting prices, the central planning board allocates [[social dividend]]s. Because all non-labor factors of production are publicly owned, the rents and profits of these resources belong to the public. The profits would be used to finance a social dividend scheme based on the individuals' share in the income derived from the socially owned capital and natural resources, providing a complimentary source of income for workers alongside their salaries and wages.&lt;ref name="On the Economic Theory of Socialism, 1936"&gt;''On the Economic Theory of Socialism'', by Lange, Oskar. 1936. The Review of Economic Studies, Vol. 4, No. 1: "It seems, therefore, convenient to regard the income of consumers as being composed of two parts: one part being the receipts for the labour services performed and the other part being a social dividend constituting the individual's share in the income derived from the capital and the natural resources owned by society."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
The Lange economic model has a number of theoretical advantages. One advantage is public control over investment. The rate of economic growth would be largely state-determined and a major determinant would be investment ratio.

Another advantage argued by Lange was that [[externalities]] could be better accounted for, thanks to the state's ability to manipulate resource prices.  Because the state controls all firms, they could easily factor the cost of an externality into the price of a certain resource.  Because decisions are made at higher rather than lower levels, it is argued that these decisions are less likely to have undesirable environmental consequences.

Furthermore, because the state uses [[marginal cost pricing]] and determines entry, Langean socialism can avoid monopolies and the accompanying lack of [[allocative efficiency]] and [[x-inefficiency|x-efficiency]].

The model claims to solve another main criticism of [[capitalism]].  Lange believed that his model would reduce cyclical instability because the state would control savings and investment, consequently eliminating a major source of inefficiency, inequality and social instability that arises from violent cyclical shifts under capitalism.

== Criticisms ==
[[Milton Friedman]] criticized the Lange model on methodological grounds. According to Friedman, the model rested on 'models of imaginary worlds' rather than 'generalizations about the real world', making the claims of the model immune to falsification.  He also criticized the model on logical grounds, by pointing out that any system which posits state ownership of enterprise requires the continuous intervention by force from the state: any time an individual started a private enterprise, the state must either shut it down or seize it, or use force to deter individuals from starting private enterprises in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Milton Friedman, 'Lange on Price Flexibility and Employment', ''Essays in Positive Economics''&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2017}}

'''''Looming''''' is a term found in the study of [[perception]], as it relates directly to [[psychology]].  Looming refers to the rapid expansion in the size of any given image. As the image becomes increasingly large on the perceiver's [[retina]], i.e., when an object ''looms'', there is an automatic [[physiological]] response to [[Perception|perceive]] the object as an approaching [[object or surface]], instead of one that is [[:wikt:stationary|stationary]] or receding.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, J. J. (2014). ''The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception: Classic Edition''. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence indicates that looming perception is not limited to the visual modality, but can occur due to auditory or even tactile stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, R. (2011). Looming auditory collision warnings for driving. ''Human Factors: The Journal of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society'', 53(1), 63-74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, B. D. (2014). Tactile Displays for Cueing Self-Motion and Looming: What Would Gibson Think?. ''Advances in Cognitive Engineering and Neuroergonomics'', 11, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is a different type of [[mirage]] that is also described as looming, in which distant objects appear much nearer than they actually are, is explained in the same way as the image of the ship, except that the image is not inverted; the density variations may also act as a [[magnifying glass]].

'''Marco Materazzi''', &lt;small&gt;[[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Ufficiale OMRI]]&lt;/small&gt; ({{IPA-it|ˈmarko mateˈrattsi}}; born 19 August 1973) is an [[Italians|Italian]] former professional [[Association football|footballer]] and [[Association football manager|manager]].

Early in his career, Materazzi played with various Italian teams in [[Serie B]] and [[Serie C]], and with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[Premier League]]. He spent two periods with [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]] (1995–98 and 1999–2001) and signed for [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] in 2001 for €10&amp;nbsp;million. At club level, he won a number of major honors with Inter, including five [[Serie A]] league titles in a row from 2006 to 2010, one [[UEFA Champions League]], one [[FIFA Club World Cup]], four [[Coppa Italia]] titles, and the [[Supercoppa Italiana]] four times.&lt;ref&gt;The Matrix – Marco Materazzi: {{cite web|url=http://lazymanscalcio.tumblr.com/post/18215957095/the-matrix |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203063129/http://lazymanscalcio.tumblr.com/post/18215957095/the-matrix |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Materazzi earned 41 caps for Italy from his debut in 2001 until 2008, playing in two World Cups and two European Championships. He was one of the key players in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final]] against France, as he scored Italy's goal and later, in extra time, he received a headbutt from [[Zinedine Zidane]], who was punished with a red card.&lt;ref name="World Cup"/&gt; Italy then went on to win the World Cup in a penalty shoot-out, during which Materazzi scored again.

A controversial and provocative figure in football, he was known for his very physical and aggressive style of play as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]], as well as his tight marking and strong, harsh tackling, which led him to receive more than 60 yellow cards and 25 red cards throughout his playing career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.serpentsofmadonnina.com/2011/7/18/3211758/marco-materazzi-a-bandieria-among-bandierie|title=Marco Materazzi: A Bandieria Among Bandierie|publisher=Serpents of Madonnina|date=18 July 2011|accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to his temper, and his commitment to rash, heavy challenges, he has been involved in several altercations with other players during matches,&lt;ref name="Materazzi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cazullo|first1=Aldo|title=Materazzi|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2006/luglio/11/Materazzi_co_9_060711008.shtml|website=www.corriere.it|publisher=Il Corriere della Sera|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing comparisons with retired defender [[Pasquale Bruno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Emanuele Gamba|title="O' animale resto sempre io una volta aspettai Lerda..."|trans-title="I'm still the animal once I waited for Lerda..."|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2004/b/sezioni/sport/calcio/serie_a/brunotunnel/brunotunnel/brunotunnel.html|publisher=La Repubblica|accessdate=4 May 2015|language=Italian|date=3 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' placed Materazzi at number 45 in their list of the 50 hardest football players in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 50 Hardest Footballers |url=http://www.empireonline.com/forum/printable.asp?m=1554851 |accessdate=14 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019002225/http://www.empireonline.com/forum/printable.asp?m=1554851 |archivedate=19 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==
===Early career===
Materazzi began his footballing career with the [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] and then the [[F.C. Messina Peloro|Messina Peloro]] youth teams from 1990 to 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alpha59.it/news/50/la-carriera-di-marco-materazzi.html|title=LA CARRIERA DI MARCO MATERAZZI|date=3 March 2018|publisher=alpha59.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his early career in the lower divisions of Italian football, with amateur side Tor di Quinto (1991–92), [[Serie C]]2 team [[S.C. Marsala 1912|Marsala]] (1993–94), and Serie C1 [[A.S.D. Trapani Calcio|Trapani]] (1994–95), where he narrowly missed a historic promotion to [[Serie B]] after losing a promotion playoff to [[S.S. Gualdo|Gualdo]]. [[Serie B]] squad [[Perugia Calcio]] signed Materazzi for the first time in 1995,&lt;ref name="Early life"/&gt; but he spent a part of the 1996–97 season in Serie C with [[Carpi F.C. 1909|Carpi]].

He then spent 1998–99 with [[Everton F.C.|Everton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.toffeeweb.com/players/profiles/Materazzi.php|title=Marco Materazzi central defender|publisher=ToffeeWeb.com|accessdate=14 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he was sent off three times in just 27 games, and scored twice, against [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the league&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-barmby-sparks-everton-deluge-1071633.html|title=Barmby sparks Everton deluge|publisher=[[The Independent]]|author=Neil Bramwell|location=London|date=17 February 1999|accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-dacourt-drives-everton-through-1200301.html|title=Dacourt drives Everton through|publisher=The Independent|author=Phill Shaw|location=London|date=23 September 1998|accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gazzetta/&gt;

He then returned to Perugia in 1999 and scored 12 goals, including 7 from penalties in the [[2000–01 Serie A|2000–01 season]], breaking [[Daniel Passarella]]'s Serie A record of most goals by a defender in one season.&lt;ref name=gazzetta/&gt;

Materazzi's [[2003–04 Inter Milan season|2003–04 season]] was highlighted by injuries, such as the one he suffered on 25 November during the 5–1 home loss to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in [[2003–04 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group B|UEFA Champions League group stage]] which kept him out of action for two months.&lt;ref name="Suspension"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=129970.html#inter+miss+materazzi|title=Inter to miss Materazzi|publisher=UEFA.com|date=27 November 2003|accessdate=15 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was in the center of a controversy again in the beginning of 2004 for aggression towards Siena player [[Bruno Cirillo]].

===Debut and 2002 World Cup===
Materazzi made his debut for the [[Italy national football team|Italy national team]] on 25 April 2001, in a 1–0 friendly match victory against [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/1294939.stm|title=Italy edge out South Africa|publisher=BBC Sport|date=25 April 2001|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made two appearances in the qualifying campaign against Georgia and Hungary. In the final tournament of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], Materazzi was used as a reserve player to back up Alessandro Nesta and Fabio Cannavaro. He made only one appearance by coming on as a substitute for Nesta in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup Group G|2–1 loss]] to [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in the group stage but soon in the 90th minute Materazzi played a floating ball over the top from just over half way to [[Filippo Inzaghi|Inzaghi]] but everyone missed the ball and it rolled in the back of the net but the goal was disallowed after referee [[Graham Poll]] claimed that Inzaghi had grabbed an opponent's shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jun/09/worldcupfootball2002.sport23|title=Italy are offline|publisher=The Guardian|author1=Simon Kuper|date=9 June 2002|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Materazzi was later criticised for his defending on both of Croatia's goals during the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/matches_wallchart/italy_v_croatia/default.stm|title=Croatia punish Italy|publisher=BBC|date=8 June 2002|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/mondiali2002/itacrpag/itacrpag/itacrpag.html|title=Male Materazzi e Maldini, Non brilla Totti, bene Vieri|trans-title=Materazzi and Maldini bad, Totti does not shine, Vieri good|publisher=Reppublica.it|language=Italian|author=Massimo Vincenzi|date=8 June 2002|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An aggressive, physical, and hard-tackling [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-back]], who was also known for his tight marking of opponents,&lt;ref name="Materazzi"/&gt; Materazzi was considered to be one of the best defenders of his generation, and was highly regarded by two of the world's most respected coaches, [[Marcello Lippi]] and [[José Mourinho]], later becoming close friends with both managers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.futaa.com/football/article/why-i-cried-when-jose-left--materazzi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904083401/http://www.futaa.com/football/article/why-i-cried-when-jose-left--materazzi |archivedate=4 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Materazzi was lauded by his managers in particular for being a goal threat as a defender, due to his outstanding aerial ability, which made him dangerous during set pieces.&lt;ref name="gazzetta"/&gt; His prolific goalscoring allowed him to capture the record for most goals in a Serie A season by a defender, which was broken during the [[2000–01 Serie A|2000–01 season]].&lt;ref name=gazzetta&gt;{{cite web|title=I difensori e il vizio del gol Facchetti il top, poi Matrix|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/26-10-2009/i-difensori-vizio-gol--601754131334.shtml|accessdate=14 September 2014|language=Italian|work=[[Gazzetta dello Sport]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an accurate set piece and penalty kick taker, with a powerful shot from distance.&lt;ref name="gazzetta"/&gt; In addition to these attributes, he had solid technical skills and reliable distribution, and was known for frequently playing long balls to the strikers.&lt;ref name="Materazzi"/&gt; During his time with Internazionale, he developed the nickname ''Matrix''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inter.it/aas/news/reader?N=43308&amp;L=it|title=Foto: Marco Materazzi, Matrix|publisher=inter.it|date=26 December 2008|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calciogazzetta.it/altro/la-storia-di-un-campione-trattata-da-calcio-gazzetta/storie-di-calcio-marco-matrix-materazzi/|title=[Storie di Calcio] Marco “Matrix” Materazzi|trans-title=[Stories of Football] Marco “Matrix” Materazzi|publisher=calciogazzetta.it|language=Italian|date=21 June 2017|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Merit''' (''{{lang-sa|puṇya}}'', ''{{lang-pi|puñña}}'') is a concept considered fundamental to [[Buddhist ethics]]. It is a beneficial and protective force which accumulates as a result of good deeds, acts, or thoughts. '''Merit-making''' is important to Buddhist practice: merit brings good and agreeable results, determines the quality of the [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|next life]] and contributes to a person's growth towards [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. In addition, merit is also shared with a deceased loved one, in order to help the deceased in their new existence. Despite [[Buddhist modernism|modernization]], merit-making remains essential in traditional Buddhist countries and has had a significant impact on the rural economies in these countries.

Merit is connected with the notions of purity and goodness. Before Buddhism, merit was used with regard to [[ancestor worship]], but in Buddhism it gained a more general ethical meaning. Merit is a force that results from good deeds done; it is capable of attracting good circumstances in a person's life, as well as improving the person's mind and inner well-being. Moreover, it affects the next lives to come, as well as [[Buddhist cosmology|the destination a person is reborn.]] The opposite of merit is [[Buddhist views on sin|demerit]] (''papa''), and it is believed that merit is able to weaken demerit. Indeed, merit has even been connected to the path to [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|Nirvana]] itself, but many scholars say that this refers only to some types of merit.

Merit can be gained in a number of ways, such as [[Dana (Buddhism)|giving]], [[Śīla|virtue]] and [[Bhavana|mental development]]. In addition, there are many forms of merit-making described in [[Buddhist texts|ancient Buddhist texts]]. A similar concept of ''kusala'' (''Sanskrit: kusala'') is also known, which is different from merit in some details. The most fruitful form of merit-making is those good deeds done with regard to the [[Triple Gem]], that is, the [[Buddha]], his teachings, the [[Dharma|Dhamma]] (''Sanskrit: Dharma''), and the [[Sangha]]. In Buddhist societies, a great variety of practices involving merit-making has grown throughout the centuries, sometimes involving great self-sacrifice. Merit has become part of [[Buddhist liturgy|rituals]], [[Buddhist practice|daily and weekly practice]], and [[Culture of Buddhism|festivals]]. In addition, there is a widespread custom of [[Pariṇāmanā|transferring merit]] to one's deceased relatives, of which the origin is still a matter of scholarly debate. Merit has been that important in Buddhist societies, that [[Buddhist kingship|kingship]] was often [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimated]] through it, and still is.

In modern society, merit-making has been criticized as materialist, but merit-making is still ubiquitous in many societies. Examples of the impact of beliefs about merit-making can be seen in the ''Phu Mi Bun'' rebellions which took place in the last centuries, as well as in the revival of certain forms of merit-making, such as the much discussed [[Life release|merit release]].

{{dfn|''Puñña''}} literally translates as 'merit, meritorious action, virtue'.{{sfn|Rhys Davids|Stede|1921|p=86}} It is glossed by the [[Theravāda]] Commentator [[Dhammapala|Dhammapāla]] as "''santanaṃ punāti visodheti''", meaning 'it cleans or purifies the life-continuity'.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=461}}{{sfn|Harvey|2012|p=44}} Its opposites are [[Buddhist views on sin|''apuñña'' (demerit) or ''pāpa'']] ('infertile, barren, harmful, bringing ill fortune'),{{sfn|Rhys Davids|Stede|1921|p=86}}{{sfn|Harvey|2012|p=44}}{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980b}} of which the term ''pāpa'' has become most common.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=461}} The term {{dfn|''merit''}}, originally [[Merit (Catholic Church)|a Judeo-Christian term]], has in the latter part of the twentieth century gradually been used as a translation of the Buddhist term ''puṇya'' or ''puñña''.{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|pp=5870, 5873}} The Buddhist term has, however, more of an impermanent character than the English translation implies,{{sfn|Hanks|1962|p=1247}} and the Buddhist term does not imply a sense of ''deserving''.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=18}}{{sfn|Cousins|1996|p=155}}

Before the arising of Buddhism, merit was commonly used in the context of [[Brahmanical]] sacrifice, and it was believed that merit accrued through such sacrifice would bring the devotee to an eternal heaven of the [[pitṛs|'fathers']] {{dfn|(''{{lang-sa|pitṛ, pitara}}'')}}.&lt;ref name="Holt 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 January 1981|title=Assisting the Dead by Venerating the Living: Merit Transfer in the Early Buddhist Tradition|journal=Numen|volume=28|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.2307/3269794|jstor=3269794|last1=Holt|first1=John C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=457–8}}{{sfn|Premasiri|1976|p=66}} Later, in the period of the [[Upanishads]], a concept of rebirth was established and it was believed that life in heaven was determined by the merit accumulated in previous lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|year=2010|encyclopedia=New Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Institute of Philosophy of the Russian Academy of Sciences, National public and Science Foundation|url=http://iphras.ru/elib/2256.html#|last=Shohin|first=V.K.|language=ru|trans-title=pāpa–puñña|script-title=ПАПА–ПУНЬЯ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=457–8}}{{sfn|Premasiri|1976|p=66}} but the focus on the ''pitṛ'' did not really change.&lt;ref name="Holt 1981" /&gt; In Buddhism, the idea of an eternal heaven was rejected, but it was believed that merit could help achieve a rebirth in a temporary heaven.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=457–8}} Merit was no longer merely a product of ritual, but was invested with an ethical meaning and role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.academia.edu/15728091|url-access=registration|last1=Norman|first1=K.R.|author-link=K.

In the [[Tipiṭaka]] (''{{lang-sa|Tripitaka}}''; the Buddhist scriptures), the importance of merit is often stressed. Merit is generally considered fundamental to Buddhist ethics, in nearly all Buddhist traditions.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980b}}{{sfn|Tanabe|2004|p=532}}{{sfn|McFarlane|1997|p=409}} Merit-making is very important to Buddhist practice in Buddhist societies.&lt;ref name="Fuller 2016" /&gt;{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003}}{{sfn|Basham|1989|p=126}}

Merit is a "beneficial and protective force which extends over a long period of time" (B.J. Terwiel)—and is the effect of good deeds (''{{lang-pi|kamma}}'', ''{{lang-sa|karma}}'') done through physical action, words, or thought.&lt;ref name="Terwiel 1976"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 January 1976|title=A Model for the Study of Thai Buddhism|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=35|issue=3|pages=391–403|doi=10.2307/2053271|jstor=2053271|last1=Terwiel|first1=B.

A mixture of the two generates mixed results in a person's life. This {{dfn|[[Karma (buddhism)|karmic correspondence]]}} (''{{lang-pi|kamma-sarikkhatā}}'') or "automatic cosmic reaction" (Brokaw) is a common idea found in [[Buddhist texts]] and Buddhist societies,{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003}}{{sfn|Brokaw|2014|p=28}} and explains why people are different and lead different lives in many ways.&lt;ref name="Fuller 2016" /&gt;{{sfn|Keyes|1973|p=96}} Karma is self-regulatory and natural: it operates without divine intervention and human intention is fundamental to it.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=18}}{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|pp=5870, 5873}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1971|pp=204–5}} Internally, merit makes the mind happy and virtuous.&lt;ref name="KRC 2005"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.kasikornresearch.com/en/k-econanalysis/pages/ViewSummary.aspx?docid=2092|title=Thai Merit-Making: Bt3.3 Billion Cashflow for Merchants|date=22 February 2005|publisher=Kasikorn Research Center|accessdate=13 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018200510/https://www.kasikornresearch.com/en/k-econanalysis/pages/ViewSummary.aspx?docid=2092|archive-date=18 October 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Keyes|1983|p=268}}{{sfn|Cate|Lefferts|2006|p=589}} Externally, present good circumstances, such as a long life, health and wealth, as well as the character and abilities someone is born with, arise from merits done in the past and vice versa, with demerits.&lt;ref name="Terwiel 1976" /&gt;{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=29}}{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=158}} The merits and demerits a person has done may take a while to bear fruit.&lt;ref name="Rao Paranjpe 2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rao|first1=K.

== Discussion in traditional texts ==
=== General ===
Merit is not only a concept, but also a way of living.{{sfn|Mulder|1969|p=109}} The [[Pāli canon]] identifies three bases of merit (''{{IAST|puññakiriyā-vatthu}}''),{{sfn|Rhys Davids|Stede|1921|p=86}}{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=460}}{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=19}} in order of difficulty:{{sfn|Mulder|1969|pp=109–10}}{{Refn|group=note|In the Sangīti Sutta ("Chanting together discourse," [[Digha Nikaya]] 33), verse 38, [[Sariputra|the leading disciple Sāriputta]] is described as teaching the same triad: ''dāna'', ''sīla'', ''bhāvanā''.{{sfn|Walshe|1995|p=485}}}}
* giving (''{{IAST|dāna-maya}}'')
* {{dfn|virtue}} (''{{IAST|sīla-maya}}'')
* mental development (''{{IAST|bhāvanā-maya}}'')
In Buddhist texts and practice, giving is considered the easiest of the three bases of merit.{{sfn|Findly|2003|pp=185, 250}} It helps to overcome selfishness and stills the mind; it prepares the mind for the practice of virtue.{{sfn|McFarlane|1997|p=409}} It is also considered a form of saving, considering there is a rebirth in which people receive back what they have given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 January 1972|title=Doctrine, Practice, and Belief in Theravada Buddhism (Review of Buddhism and Society: A Great Tradition and its Burmese Vicissitudes by Melford E. Spiro)|journal=The Journal of Asian Studies|volume=31|issue=2|pages=373–380|doi=10.2307/2052605|jstor=2052605|last1=Lehman|first1=F. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for virtue, this comprises three out of eight aspects of the [[eight-fold path]], the path central in the Buddhist teaching: [[right speech]], right action and [[right livelihood]]. Being the main criterion for moral behavior in Buddhism, virtue is mostly about the undertaking of [[five precepts]],{{sfn|McFarlane|1997|p=409}}{{sfn|Jones|1979|p=372}} although the [[eight precepts]] may be kept now and then.{{sfn|Namchoom|Lalhmingpuii|2016|p=47}} The five precepts are part of many Buddhist ceremonies, and are also considered a merit itself, helping the practitioner to become strong and healthy.{{sfn|McFarlane|1997|p=409}}{{sfn|Jones|1979|p=374}}{{sfn|Salguero|2013|p=344}} The benefits of practicing the three bases of merits are also summarized as three forms of happiness (''{{lang-pi|sampatti}}'')—happiness as a human being, happiness in heaven, and happiness in Nirvana.{{sfn|Skilling|2005|p=9832}} When people die, what world they will be reborn into depends on how intense they practice these three bases of merit. It is, however, only mental development that can take someone to the highest heavenly worlds, or to Nirvana.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=460, 462}}
[[File:Monks doing Pindapatta before Vessak Day 2010 in Magelang.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|alt=Monk on almsround|Giving helps to overcome selfishness and stills the mind; it prepares the mind for the practice of virtue.{{sfn|McFarlane|1997|p=409}}]]
[[Pali literature#List of post-canonical Pali texts|Post-canonical texts]] and [[atthakatha|commentaries]]{{Refn|group=note|See [[Digha Nikaya|Digha Nikāya]] iii.218}} such as the [[Dhammasangani|Dhammasaṅganī]] and [[Atthasalini|Atthasālinī]],{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=470}}{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980c|p=275}} elaborating on the three bases of merit, state that [[upasaka|lay devotees]] can make merit by performing ten deeds. Seven items are then added to the previous three:
* Giving (''Dāna-maya'')
* Virtue (''Sīla-maya'')
* Mental development (''Bhāvanā-maya'')
* Honoring others (''Apacāyana-maya'')
* Offering service (''Veyyāvaca-maya'')
* Dedicating (or transferring) merit to others (Pāli:''Pattidāna-maya''; Sanskrit: ''puṇyapariṇāmanā'')
* Rejoicing in others' merit (''Pattānumodanā-maya'')
* Listening to teachings (''Dhammassavana-maya'')
* Instructing others in the teachings (''Dhammadesanā-maya'')
* Straightening one's own views in accordance with the Teachings (''Diṭṭhujukamma''){{sfn|Rhys Davids|Stede|1921|p=86}}{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=470}}{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|p=5873}}

These ten, the Commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] says, all fit within the three first bases of merit: 'Giving' includes 'Transferring merit to others' and 'Rejoicing in others' merit' by extension, whereas 'Virtue' includes 'Honoring others' and 'Offering service'. The remaining items 'Listening to Teachings', 'Instructing others in the Teachings' and 'Straightening one's own views' are part of 'Mental development'.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=470}} Thus, in Theravāda Buddhism, merit is always accrued through morally (good) actions. Such good deeds are also highly valued in the other two Buddhist schools, that is Mahāyāna (China, Japan, etc.) and [[Vajrayāna]] (Tibet, Nepal, etc.). In some forms of Mahāyāna or [[Vajrayāna]] it is believed, however, that even more merit will accrue from certain ritual actions, sometimes called the 'power of blessed substances' ''({{lang-bo|rdzas}})''. These are considered an addition to the traditional list and can help protect against calamities or other negative events caused by bad karma.{{sfn|Tanabe|2004|p=532}}{{sfn|Gutschow|2004|pp=14–5}}

A number of scholars have criticized the concepts of merit and karma as amoral, egoist and calculative, citing its quantitative nature and emphasis on personal benefits in observing morality.&lt;ref name="Jory 1996" /&gt;{{sfn|Spiro|1982|pp=105–7}}{{sfn|Keown|1992|p=13}} Other scholars have pointed out that in Buddhist ethics egoism and altruism may not be as strictly separated as in western thought, personal benefit and that of the other becoming one as the practitioner progresses on the spiritual path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=b3ISBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117|title=The golden rule: the ethics of reciprocity in world religions|last2=Chilton|first2=Bruce|date=2008|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-1-4411-9012-3|location=London|page=117|last1=Neusner|first1=Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2015|title=On the Classification of Śāntideva's Ethics in the Bodhicaryāvatāra|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=65|issue=1|pages=249–275|doi=10.1353/pew.2015.0008|last1=Harris|first1=Stephen E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perret 1987"&gt;{{cite journal|date=March 1987|title=Egoism, altruism and intentionalism in Buddhist ethics|journal=Journal of Indian Philosophy|volume=15|issue=1|pages=71–85|doi=10.1007/BF00213993|last1=Perrett|first1=Roy W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhist ethics is informed by Buddhist metaphysics, notably, the [[Anatta|not-self doctrine]], and therefore some western ethical concepts may not apply.&lt;ref name="Perret 1987" /&gt; Besides, as Keown notices, moral action would not be possible if it was not preceded by moral concern for others, as is illustrated by the example of the Buddha himself. Such moral concern is also part of the Buddhist path, cultivated through [[brahmavihara|loving-kindness and the other sublime attitudes]] (''{{lang-pi|brahamavihāra}}'').{{sfn|Keown|1992|pp=74–6}}

=== Accumulation and fruition ===
In post-canonical and vernacular Pāli literature, such as the [[Jātaka]] stories of the Buddha's previous lives, the [[Avadana|Avadānas]] and Anisaṃsa texts, as well as in many Mahāyāna texts, merit is the main concept. It is regarded as something which can be accumulated throughout different lifetimes in the process of attaining [[Buddhahood]], and is also instrumental in attaining it. The ''Bodhisatta'' intent on accomplishing Buddhahood and bringing other beings across the ocean of suffering, must do so by accumulating all sorts of merits, in this context also called [[Pāramitā|perfections]] (''{{lang-pi|pāramī}}''; ''{{lang-sa|pāramitā}}''). This form of merit-making is always led by a [[Praṇidhāna|vow for enlightenment]] (''{{lang-pi|panidhāna}}''; ''{{lang-sa|praṇidhāna}}''), and an intention to enlighten others as well, as well as the transferring of merits to all living beings to that effect.{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|p=5874}}{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=45, 57, 59}}{{sfn|Skilling|2005|pp=9833, 9839}} Another aspect of meritorious acts, emphasized more in later literature, is the idea that a single meritorious act done will reap many fruits, as, for example, expressed in the [[Vimanavatthu|Vimānavatthu]]. Not only is the quality of people's next rebirth affected by their merits, but also the circumstances in which they are reborn; not only in the next life, but also in adjacent lives after that.

In Buddhist texts further details are given in what way and to what extent a meritorious deed will bring results: this depends on the spiritual quality of the recipient, the spiritual attitude of the giver, the manner in which one gives and the object given.&lt;ref name="Heim 2004" /&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=20}}{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|p=5873}} If the recipient is a human, the gift yields more fruits than if the recipient is an animal, but a gift to a {{dfn|[[samanera|sāmaṇera]]}} (a young monk), a monk, many monks, and the Buddha yield even more fruits, in ascending order.{{sfn|Brekke|1998|p=301}}{{sfn|Spiro|1982|pp=108–9}} If the giver is motivated by greed or other [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|defilements of the mind]], the merit gained will be much less than if the giver is motivated by loving-kindness or other noble intentions.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=94}} Even the intention of going to heaven, though in itself not considered wrong, is not seen as lofty as the intention to want to develop and purify the mind. If the recipient is spiritually "not worthy of the gift", the gift will still be meritorious provided the giver's intention is good, and this is also valid the other way around.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|pp=19, 21–2}}{{sfn|Brekke|1998|pp=301, 309–10}} Good thoughts must also be maintained after the good deed is done, as regretting the gift will also decrease the merit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JOxDp7SRYNUC&amp;dq|title=The way to Nirvana: Six lectures on ancient Buddhism as a discipline of salvation|date=1917|publisher=Library of Alexandria|isbn=978-1-4655-7944-7|series=Hibbert lectures|last1=de La Vallée Poussin|first1=Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the giver pronounces a certain wish or intention also affects the meritorious deed, as the power of the merits can be channeled toward a certain purpose.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=468}}{{sfn|Walters|2003|pp=23–4}}{{sfn|Gómez|2002|pp=30–1}}{{Refn|group=note|[[Sacca-kiriya|The announcing of a certain intention in reference to the actions someone has done]] (''{{lang-pi|saccakiriya}}'') is a common theme in all Indian religion {{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=468}}}} The manner in which people give is also important: whether someone gives respectfully or not, and whether by giving someone is harming anyone. With regard to the size of the gift, a larger gift is usually more meritorious than a smaller one, but purity of mind affects merit more than the gift's size.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|pp=20–1, 192}} It is therefore recommended to give as much as you can afford, no more and no less.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=110}} Such care in choosing who to give to and how to give, is called being 'skilled in merit' (''{{lang-pi|puññassa kovidā}}'').{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=260}}

=== ''Puñña'', ''kusala'' and Nirvana ===
{{See also|Nirvana (Buddhism)}}
A teaching that exists in both Mahāyāna ''sūtras'' and Theravādin ''suttas'' is the teaching on the Ten Wholesome Ways of Action (''{{lang-pi|kusaladhamma}}''). In Mahāyāna, this teaching is described as the way in which a ''[[Bodhisattva]]'' prevents "suffering in all [[Niraya|evil destinies]]".&lt;!-- I am not mentioning the translator specifically, because both translations linked translate in the same way as "evil destinies". It doesn't seem to be creative content. --&gt; These ten wholesome ways are:
* In giving up the taking of life, the practitioner will accomplish freedom from vexations;
* In giving up stealing, the practitioner will find security in life, economically, socially and spiritually;
* In giving up wrongful (sexual) conduct, the practitioner will find inner peace and peace in the family life;
* In giving up lying, the practitioner will attain purity of speech and mind;
* In giving up slander, the practitioner will be protected socially and spiritually;
* In giving up harsh language, the practitioner's words will be more effective;
* In giving up frivolous speech, the practitioner will become wise and dignified;
* In giving up lust, the practitioner finds freedom in life through contentment and simplicity;
* In giving up hatred, the practitioner will develop kindness and gentleness;
* In giving up wrong views, the practitioner will not falter in the good and spiritual path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bhikkhu|first1=Saddhaloka|title=The Discourse on the Ten Wholesome Ways of Action|url=http://www.buddhistdoor.com/OldWeb/resources/sutras/wholesome_sutra.htm|website=Buddhistdoor|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The discourse on the ten wholesome ways of action|journal=Undumbara Garden|date=23 September 2009|url=http://undumbara.wordpress.com/2009/09/23/the-discourse-on-the-ten-wholesome-ways-of-action/|accessdate=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ten actions are described as {{dfn|''akusala''}} ('unwholesome'; ''{{lang-sa|akuśala}}''), and when abstaining from them it is called {{dfn|''kusala''}} ('wholesome'; ''{{lang-sa|kuśala}}'').{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=459, 464}}{{refn|group=note|There is some discussion as to the best translation of ''kusala'', some preferring 'skilful' or 'intelligent' instead.{{sfn|Cousins|1996|pp=137–8}}}} Moreover, ''kusala'' and ''akusala'' are depicted as having 'roots' (''mūla''). ''Akusalamūla'' are the roots of evil in the mind (the [[Kilesa|defilements]]), whereas the ''kusalamūla'' are roots connected with good qualities of the mind. Both of them are called ''roots'' because they are qualities that can be cultivated and grown in the mind.{{sfn|Gómez|2002|pp=324–5}}{{sfn|Thomas|1953|p=120}}

''Puñña'' and ''pāpa'' are close in meaning to ''kusala'' and ''akusala''. Both pairs are used for distinguishing between ethically right and wrong. However, even though the negatives ''akusala'' and ''pāpa'' have almost the same meaning, there are some differences between the positives, ''kusala'' and ''puñña''. According to [[P. D. Premasiri]], ''Kusala'' is used to describe a more direct path to [[Nirvana]] than ''puñña''.{{sfn|Premasiri|1976}}{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=463–5}} [[Damien Keown]], however, believes they are merely different angles of the same concept: ''kusala'' refers to the moral status of an action, whereas ''puñña'' refers to the experience of the consequences of the action.{{sfn|Keown|1992|p=123}} He further points out that in the Pāli {{dfn|''[[suttas]]''}} (discourses) mental development (''bhāvanā'') practices such as meditation are also included in the path of merit. It is unlikely that in the Tipiṭaka meditation would be regarded as an indirect path or obstacle to Nirvana,{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=467}}{{sfn|Keown|1992|p=90}} and there are passages that directly relate merit to Nirvana.{{sfn|Egge|2013|pp=55–6}}{{sfn|Collins|1997|p=290}} Sometimes a distinction is made between worldly (''{{lang-pi|lokīya}}'') and transcendental (''{{lang-pi|lokuttara}}'') merit, in which only transcendental merit leads to liberation.{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=95}}{{sfn|Collins|1997|p=482}} The Thai scholar and monastic [[Prayudh Payutto|Phra Payutto]] believes that ''merit'' and ''kusala'' are both used to describe the 'cleanliness of the mind' ({{RTGS|Khwam sa-at mot jot}}). But whereas ''merit'' aims for the 'beautiful and praiseworthy' ({{RTGS|Suai-ngam na chuenchom}}) aspect of such cleanliness, with worldly benefits such as wealth, praise and happiness; ''kusala'' aims for the 'purity' ({{RTGS|borisut}}) aspect of cleanliness, with enlightenment as its benefit. Phra Payutto does add that both need to be accumulated on the Buddhist path. In making this comparison, he says this only holds for worldly merit, not for transcendental merit. Collins equates transcendental merit with ''kusala''.{{sfn|Collins|1997|p=495}}&lt;ref name="Payutto 1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Payutto|first1=Phra|title=พจนานุกรมพุทธศาสน์ ฉบับประมวลศัพท์|script-title=พจนานุกรมพุทธศาสตร์ ฉบับประมาลศัพท์|trans-title=Dictionary of Buddhism, Vocabulary|date=1993|language=th|publisher=[[Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University]]|location=Bangkok|isbn=978-974-575-029-6|pages=25–6,179|edition=7|url=http://www.watnyanaves.net/uploads/File/books/pdf/dictionary_of_buddhism_vocabulary_version.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the earlier Pāli texts, ''kusala'' was much more commonly used than ''puñña'', ''puñña'' mostly being used in the context of the practice of giving.{{sfn|Cousins|1996|pp=154–5}}

In a widely quoted theory, [[Melford Spiro]] and Winston King have distinguished two forms of Buddhism found in traditional Buddhist societies, "kammatic Buddhism" focused on activities such as merit-making, and "nibbanic Buddhism" which focuses on the liberation from suffering and rebirth.{{sfn|Spiro|1982}} In this theory, called the "transcendency thesis" (Keown), Buddhism has two quite separate aims, which are pursued by separate groups, that is, laypeople (kammatic) and monks (nibbanic). This view has, however, been downplayed or criticized by many other scholars, who believe that kammatic practices are in many ways connected to nibbanic practices, and the aims of monks and laypeople cannot be that easily separated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 January 1979|title=The Relationship of the Karmic to the Nirvanic in Theravāda Buddhism|journal=The Journal of Religious Ethics|volume=7|issue=1|pages=28–36|jstor=40018241|last1=Aronson|first1=Harvey B.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Swearer|1995|p=10}}{{sfn|Keown|1992|pp=85–105}}

This transcendency thesis has also been applied to scriptural interpretation. When discussing the path to the attainment of Nirvana, in some passages in the Tipiṭaka merit is rejected. For example, in the Padhāna Sutta, the [[Bodhisatta#Theravāda Buddhism|''Bodhisatta'' (the Buddha Gotama to be)]] is tempted by [[Mara (demon)|''Māra'']] to give up his [[Self-mortification|self-torture]] practices to do meritorious acts instead. The ''Bodhisatta'' replies that even a bit of merit is no use to him (''{{lang-pi|"anumattenāpi puññena attho mayhaṃ na vijjati"}}''). Some scholars, supporting the transcendency thesis, have interpreted this to mean that merit can only lead to happiness and progress within ''Saṃsāra'', but does not lead to Nirvana, and must in fact be discarded before attaining Nirvana.{{sfn|Premasiri|1976|p=68}}{{sfn|Keown|1992|p=89}}{{sfn|Egge|2013|p=23}} Marasinghe believes, however, that the word ''merit'' in this passage refers to merit in the pre-Buddhist Brahmanical sense, connected with rituals and sacrifice, and the lay life.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=462–3}} Another example often quoted in this context is the [[Yana (Buddhism)#Teaching story and metaphor|simile of the raft]], which states that both ''dhamma'' and ''adhamma'' should be let go of in order to attain liberation. Whereas the term ''adhamma'' in the text clearly refers to evil views, the meaning of ''dhamma'' is subject to different interpretations. Considering that no other similar passage can be found in the Tipiṭaka, Keown believes that only this passage is not enough to base the transcendency thesis on.{{sfn|Keown|1992|pp=94–105}}

In the Pāli Canon, an [[arahat|enlightened person]] is said to be neutral in terms of karma, that is, the person no longer generates karma, merit, or demerit.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980b}}{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=466,471}}{{sfn|McDermott|1975|pp=431–2}} Some scholars have interpreted this to mean that an enlightened person attains a state where distinctions between good and evil no longer exist. Other scholars have criticized this as making little sense, considering how the Buddha would normally emphasize ethics. The fact that an enlightened person is neutral in terms of karma, does not mean he is {{em|ethically}} neutral.{{sfn|Premasiri|1976|p=73}}{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|pp=465–6}} Indeed, the Buddha is quoted in the Tipiṭaka as saying he is foremost in 'higher morality' (''adhisīla'').{{sfn|Keown|1992|p=113}} Keown attempts to overcome this problem by proposing that enlightened people are beyond the accumulative experience of good deeds (merit, ''puñña''), since they are already perfected. They therefore do not need to accumulate goodness and the resulting happiness anymore. They no longer need to strive for a happy rebirth in the next life, because they have gone beyond rebirth. Their enlightenment is, however, an {{em|ethical}} perfection as well, though this is solely described as ''kusala'', not as ''puñña''.&lt;ref name="Goodman 2009"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0a32BJT4ZM8C|title=Consequences of Compassion: An Interpretation and Defense of Buddhist Ethics|date=2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-988845-0|last1=Goodman|first1=Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Keown|1992|pp=90,124,127–8}}{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=43}}

== Field of merit ==
[[File:Terenuri cultivate în lângă Orheiul Vechi.JPG|thumb|upright=1|right|alt=a farming field|The main concept of the field of merit is that good deeds done towards some recipients accrue more merit than good deeds to other recipients. This is compared with a seed planted in fertile ground, which reaps more and better fruits than in infertile ground.{{sfn|Salguero|2013|p=342}}{{sfn|Brekke|1998|pp=299–300}}]] In pre-Buddhist Brahmanism, Brahmin priests used to perform {{dfn|''[[yajna|yajña]]''}}''s'' (sacrifices) and thereby generating merit for the donors who provided gifts for the sacrifice. In Buddhism, it was the Buddhist monk who assumed this role, considered qualified to receive generosity from devotees and thereby generating merit for them. He came to be described as ''āhuneyyo'' ('worthy of offering'), by analogy with the Brahmanical term ''āhavanīya'' ('worthy of sacrifice', used in offerings to the ritual fire); and as ''dakkhiṇeyyo'' ('qualified to accept the offering'), by analogy with the Brahmanical ''[[Dakshina|dakśiṇā]]'', the sacrificial offering itself.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=459}}{{sfn|Egge|2013|pp=19–20}}{{sfn|Findly|2003|pp=217–8, 222}} The Sangha (monastic community) was also described as {{dfn|'field of merit'}} (''{{lang-pi|puññakkhetta}}''; ''{{lang-sa|puṇyakṣetra}}'').{{sfn|Rhys Davids|Stede|1921|p=87}}{{sfn|Brekke|1998|p=299}}{{sfn|Egge|2013|p=20}} The difference with the Brahmanical tradition was, according to Marasinghe, that Buddhism did recognize {{em|other}} ways of generating merit apart from offerings to the monk, whereas the Brahmanical ''yajña'' {{em|only}} emphasized offerings to the Brahmin priest. That is not to say that such offerings were not important in [[Pre-sectarian Buddhism|early Buddhism]]: giving to the Sangha was the first Buddhist activity which allowed for community participation, and preceded the first rituals in Buddhism.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=459}}

The main concept of the field of merit is that good deeds done towards some recipients accrue more merit than good deeds to other recipients. This is compared with a seed planted in fertile ground which reaps more and better fruits than in infertile ground.{{sfn|Salguero|2013|p=342}}{{sfn|Brekke|1998|pp=299–300}}{{sfn|Adamek|2005|p=141}} The Sangha is described as a field of merit, mostly because the members of the Sangha follow the eight-fold path. But in many texts, the Buddha and the Dhamma, and their representations, are also described as fields of merit. For example, Mahāyāna tradition considers production and reverence of Dharma texts very meritorious—this tradition, sometimes referred to as the "cult of the book" ([[Gregory Schopen]]), stimulated [[Buddhist influences on print technology|the development of print technology in China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|title=Buddhist Books and Texts: Ritual Uses of Books|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=Thomson Gale|location=Detroit|date=2005|edition=2|volume=2|pages=1261–4|isbn=978-0-02-865735-6|last1=Gummer|first1=Nathalie|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302073830/https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|2008|pp=45, 145, 149}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kieschnick|first1=John|title=The impact of Buddhism on Chinese material culture|date=2003|publisher=University Presses of California, [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] and [[Princeton University Press|Princeton]]|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-0-691-09676-6|pages=180–1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=sgkKbE-9EhAC&amp;pg=PA180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other traditions a Buddha image is also considered a field of merit, and any good deed involving a Buddha image is considered very meritorious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%2014.pdf|last1=Morgan|first1=David|editor1-last=Jones|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion|volume=14|editor1-first=Lindsay|title=Buddhism: Buddhism in Tibet|date=2005|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-02-865983-1|page=9623|edition=2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302052223/http://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%2014.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Skilling|2005|p=9829}} A meritorious deed will also be very valuable (and sometimes viewed in terms of a field of merit) if performed to repay gratitude to someone (such as parents), or performed out of compassion for those who suffer.{{sfn|Tanabe|2004|p=532}}{{sfn|Salguero|2013|p=345}}{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=23}} Deeds of merit done towards the Sangha as a whole {{dfn|(''{{lang-pi|saṅghadāna}}'')}} yield greater fruits than deeds done towards one particular recipient (''{{lang-pi|pāṭipuggalikā dakkhiṇā}}'') or deeds done with favoritism.&lt;ref name="Heim 2004"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|title=Dāna|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York (u.a.)|last=Heim|first=Maria|date=2004|volume=2|isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|p=5873}}{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=22}} Indeed, ''saṅghadāna'' yields even more fruits than deeds of merit to the person of the Buddha himself.{{sfn|Brekke|1998|p=301}}{{sfn|Adamek|2005|p=140}}

== Practice in Buddhist societies ==
{{Quote box |tstyle = text-align: left; |quote  = Thus the Buddhist's view of his present activities has a wider basis, they being but one group of incidents in an indefinitely prolonged past, present and future series. They are, as has been said, no mere train of witnesses for or against him, but a stage in a cumulative force of tremendous power. He and his works stand in a mutual relation, somewhat like that of child to parent in the case of past works, of parent to child in the case of future works. Now no normal mother is indifferent as to whether or how she is carrying out her creative potency. Nor can any normal Buddhist not care whether his acts, wrought up hourly in their effect into his present and future character, are making a happy or a miserable successor.
And so, without any definite belief as to how, or in what realm of the universe he will re-arise as that successor to his present self, the pious Buddhist, no less than his pious brethren of other creeds, goes on giving money and effort, time and thought to good works, cheerfully believing that nothing of it can possibly forgo its effect, but that it is all a piling up of merit or creative potency, to result, somewhere, somewhere, somehow, in future happiness—happiness which, though he be altruistic the while, is yet more a future asset of his, than of some one in whom he naturally is less interested than in his present self. He believes that, because of what he is now doing, some one now in process of mental creation by him, and to all intents and purposes his future " self," will one day taste less or more of life's trials. To that embryonic character he is inextricably bound ever making or marring it, and for it he is therefore and thus far responsible. |author = [[C. A. F.

In Pāli texts several of such terms were used.{{sfn|Findly|2003|pp=256–7}}}} In Buddhist societies, such merit-making is common, especially those meritorious deeds which are connected to monks and temples. In this regard, there is a saying in Burma, "Your hands are always close to offering donations".&lt;ref name="Fuller 2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Seeger" /&gt;{{sfn|Marston|2006|p=171}} Contrary to popular conceptions, merit-making is done by both monastics and laypeople alike.{{sfn|Egge|2013|p=61}}{{sfn|Mulder|1969|p=115}}{{sfn|Schopen|1997|pp=ix–x, 31}} Buddhist monks or lay Buddhists earn merit through [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]], meditation, chanting and other rituals. Giving is the fundamental way of making merit for many laypeople, as monks are not allowed to cook by themselves.{{sfn|Cate|Lefferts|2006|p=589}} Monastics in their turn practice themselves to be a good field of merit and make merit by teaching the donors. Merit-making has thus created a [[symbiotic]] relationship between laypeople and Sangha,&lt;ref name="Heim 2004" /&gt;{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|p=5873}}{{sfn|Namchoom|Lalhmingpuii|2016|p=52}} and the Sangha is obligated to be accessible to laypeople, for them to make merit.{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=226}}

Giving can be done in several ways. Some laypeople offer food, others offer robes and supplies, and others fund ceremonies, build monasteries or persuade a relative to ordain as a monk. Young people often temporary ordain as monks, because they believe this will not only yield fruits of merit for themselves, but also for their parents who have allowed them to ordain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/Encyclopedia%20of%20Religious%20Practices%20Vol1.pdf|year=2006|title=Buddhism|encyclopedia=Worldmark Encyclopedia of Religious Practices|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|location=Farmington Hills|volume=1|page=68|isbn=978-0-7876-6612-5|author=Kinnard, Jacob|editor=Riggs, Thomas|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302030021/http://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/Encyclopedia%20of%20Religious%20Practices%20Vol1.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|title=Buddhism: Buddhism in Tibet|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=Thomson Gale|location=Detroit|date=2005|edition=2|volume=2|page=1155|isbn=978-0-02-865735-6|last1=Kapstein|first1=Maththew T.|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302073830/https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=95}} In China, Thailand and India, it used to be common to offer land or the first harvest to a monastery.{{sfn|Walsh|2007|pp=362–6}}{{sfn|Namchoom|Lalhmingpuii|2016|p=52}}{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|pp=53-4}} Also, more socially oriented activities such as building a hospital or bridge, or giving to the poor are included in the Tipiṭaka, and by many Buddhists considered meritorious.{{sfn|Premasiri|1976|p=68}}{{sfn|Mulder|1969|p=115}}{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=126}} In fieldwork studies done by researchers, devotees appreciated the merits of becoming ordained and supporting the building of a temple the most.{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=95}}{{sfn|Mulder|1969}} Fisher found that building a temple was considered a great merit by devotees, because they believed they would in that way have part in all the wisdom which would be taught at that temple.{{sfn|Fisher|2008|p=148}} People may pursue merit-making for different reasons, as Buddhist orthodoxy allows for various ideals, this-worldly or ultimate.{{sfn|Swearer|1995|p=6}} Although many scholars have pointed out that devotees often aim for this-worldly benefits in merit-making,{{sfn|Scott|2009|p=101}}{{sfn|Mulder|1979|p=127}} it has also been pointed out that in old age, people tend to make merit with a view on the next life and liberation.{{sfn|Mulder|1979|p=127}}{{sfn|Swearer|1995|p=22}} Among lay people, women tend to engage in merit-making more than men, and this may be a way for them to enhance [[empowerment]].{{sfn|Cate|Lefferts|2006|p=589}}{{sfn|Bao|2005|p=124}}{{sfn|Marston|2006|p=172}} Very often, merit-making is done as a group, and it is believed that such shared merit-making will cause people to be born together in next lives.

=== Recording ===
In several Buddhist countries, it has been common to record merits done. In China, it was common for many centuries to keep record of someone's meritorious deeds in 'merit ledgers' ({{zh|p=gōngguò gé}}). Although a belief in merit and retribution had preceded the merit ledgers by many centuries,&lt;!--only Brokaw--&gt; during the [[Ming dynasty]], through the ledgers a practice of systematic merit accumulation was established for the first time. The merit ledgers were lists of good deeds and bad deeds, organized in the form of a calendar for users to calculate to what extent they had been practicing good deeds and avoiding bad deeds every day. The ledgers also listed the exact retributions of every number of deeds done, to the detail.&lt;!--both--&gt; Through these ledgers it was believed someone could offset bad karma.&lt;!--only Brokaw--&gt;{{sfn|Brokaw|2014|pp=3–4, 31–2}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robinson|first1=Richard H.|last2=Johnson|first2=Willard L.|title=The Buddhist religion: a historical introduction|date=1977|publisher=[[Cengage]]|location=Belmont, California|isbn=978-0-534-20718-2|page=215|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth century [[Common Era|CE]], the ''[[Baopuzi]]'', and in the twelfth century the ''[[Treatise On the Response of the Tao]]'' and the ''[[Ledger of Merit and Demerit of the Taiwei Immortal]]'' introduced the basics of the system of merit ledgers. In the fourteenth century CE, the [[Tao]] master Zhao Yizhen recommended the use of the ledgers to examine oneself, to bring emotion in harmony with reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|title=Daoism: An overview|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=Thomson Gale|location=Detroit|date=2005|edition=2|volume=4|page=2187|isbn=978-0-02-865737-0|last1=Bokenkamp|first1=Stephen R.|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302073830/https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Brokaw|2014|pp=31–2}} From the fourth to the sixteenth centuries, many types of ledgers were produced by Buddhist and Tao schools, and the usage of the ledgers grew widespread.{{sfn|Brokaw|2014|pp=3–4}} The practice of recording merits has survived in China and Japan until the present day.{{sfn|Tanabe|2004|p=533}} In Theravāda countries, for example in Burma and Sri Lanka, similar customs have been observed.{{sfn|Rotman|2008}}{{sfn|Spiro|1982|pp=111–2, 454}} In Sri Lanka, a {{dfn|'book of merit'}} (''{{lang-pi|puñña-potthaka}}'', ''{{lang-sa|puṇyapustaka}}'') was sometimes kept by someone for years and read in the last moments of life.

=== Merit and wealth ===
The association of wealth with merits done has deeply affected many Buddhist countries. The relation between giving and wealth is ubiquitous in vernacular Pāli literature, and many stories of exemplary donors exist, such as the stories of [[Anathapindika|Anāthapiṇḍika]] and Jōtika.{{sfn|Scott|2009|pp=30–2, 97}} In Buddhism, by emphasizing the usage of wealth for generosity, accumulating wealth for giving purposes thus became a spiritual practice.{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=2}} But using wealth in unrighteous ways, or hoarding it instead of sharing and giving it, is condemned extensively. Greed is what keeps a person wandering in [[Saṃsāra|''Saṃsāra'' (the cycle of rebirth)]], instead of becoming liberated. It is the attachment to wealth that is an obstacle on the spiritual path, not wealth per se. Stories illustrating these themes in vernacular Buddhist literature, have profoundly influenced [[popular culture]] in Buddhist countries.&lt;ref name="Goodman 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|title=Wealth|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|location=Detroit|date=1987|edition=2|volume=14|page=9708|isbn=978-0-02-865983-1|last1=Davis|first1=Winston|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302073830/https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%202.pdf|archivedate=2 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Scott|2009|pp=30–2, 97}} Several scholars have described merit as a sort of spiritual currency or bookkeeping system.&lt;ref name="Langer 2007" /&gt;{{sfn|Rotman|2008}}{{sfn|Spiro|1982|p=111}} Though objections have been made against this metaphor,&lt;ref name="Schlieter 2013" /&gt;{{sfn|Keyes|1983|pp=18–9}} it is not new. Similar comparisons have been made in the Milinda Pañhā, and in seventeenth-century China. Moreover, Schopen has shown that Buddhism has had strong connections with the mercantile class, and Rotman thinks that a mercantile ethos may have informed Buddhist texts such as the [[Divyavadana|Divyāvadāna]].{{sfn|Collins|1997|p=290}}{{sfn|Rotman|2008}} Gombrich objects to calling merit-making "dry metaphysical mercantilism", but he does speculate on a historical relation between the concept of merit and the [[monetization]] of ancient India's economy.{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|pp=127–8}}

=== Description and origins ===
Two practices mentioned in the list of meritorious acts have been studied quite extensively by scholars: dedicating (or transferring) merit to others, and rejoicing in others' merits.{{sfn|Gethin|1998|pp=109–10}} Transferring merit is a widespread custom in all Buddhist countries, Mahāyāna, Vajrayāna and Theravāda.&lt;ref name="Schumann 1973"&gt;''Buddhism. An Outline of its Teachings and Schools'' by Schumann, Hans Wolfgang, trans. by Georg Fenerstein, Rider: 1973, p. 92. Cited in "The Notion of Merit in Indian Religions," by Tommi Lehtonen, ''Asian Philosophy'', Vol. 10, No. 3, 2000 pg 193&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=203}}{{sfn|Keyes|1977|p=287}} In the Pāli tradition, the word ''pattidāna'' is used, meaning 'giving of the acquired'.{{sfn|Nyanatiloka|1980a}} And in the Sanskrit tradition, the word ''pariṇāmanā'' is used for transferring merit, meaning 'bending round or towards, transfer, dedication'.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=472}} Of these translations, 'transfer of merit' has become commonplace, though objected to by some scholars.&lt;ref name="Masefield 2004"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Masefield|first=Peter|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=2|title=Ghosts and spirits|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, [[Thomson Gale]]|location=New York (u.a.)|isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|pp=309–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gombrich|2006|p=126}}

Buddhist traditions provide detailed descriptions of how this transfer proceeds. Transferring merit to another person, usually deceased relatives, is simply done by a mental wish. Despite the word ''transfer'', the merit of the giver is in no way decreased during such an act, just like a candle used to light another candle does not diminish.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=470}}{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|p=5874}}{{sfn|Malalasekera|1967|p=85}} The merit transferred cannot always be received, however. The dead relatives must also be able to sympathize with the meritorious act. If the relatives do not receive the merit, the act of transferring merit will still be beneficial for the giver himself. The transfer of merit is thus connected with the idea of rejoicing.{{sfn|Gombrich|1971|pp=209–10}} The other person who rejoices in one's meritorious deeds, in that way also receives merit, if he approves of the merit done. Thus, rejoicing in others' merits, apart from being one of the ten meritorious acts mentioned, is also a prerequisite for the transferring of merit to occur.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=20}}{{sfn|Malalasekera|1967|p=85}}{{sfn|Harvey|2012|p=45}} The purposes for merit transfer differ. In many Buddhist countries, transferring merit is connected to the notion of an [[intermediate state]]. The merit that is transferred to the deceased will help them to cross over safely to the next rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.ahandfulofleaves.org/documents/Encyclopedia%20of%20Buddhism_2%20Vols_%20Buswell.pdf|last=Cuevas|first=Brian J.|editor1-last=Buswell|editor1-first=Robert E.|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism|volume=2|title=Intermediate state|date=2004|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA, Thomson Gale|location=New York (u.a.)|isbn=978-0-02-865720-2|p=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Mahāyāna traditions believe that it can help deceased relatives to attain the [[Pure Land]].{{sfn|Tanabe|2004|p=532}} Another way of transferring merit, apart from helping the deceased, is to dedicate it to the ''[[deva (Buddhism)|devas]]'' (deities), since it is believed that these are not able to make merits themselves. In this way it is believed their favor can be obtained.&lt;ref name="Langer 2007" /&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2012|p=45}}{{sfn|Gombrich|2009|p=36}} Finally, many Buddhists transfer merits to resolve a bond of revenge that may exist between people, as it is believed that someone else's vengefulness may create harm in one's life.{{sfn|Tanabe|2004|p=533}}{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=335}}

Initially in the Western study of Buddhism, some scholars believed that the transfer of merit was a uniquely Mahāyāna practice and that it was developed only at a late period after the historical Buddha. For example, Heinz Bechert dated the Buddhist doctrine of transfer of merit in its fully developed form to the period between the fifth and seventh centuries CE.{{sfn|Bechert|1992|loc=note 34, pp. 99–100}} Scholars perceived that it was discordant with early Buddhist understandings of karma,{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=203}}{{sfn|Bechert|1992|loc=note 34, pp. 99–100}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1971|p=204}} and noticed that in the [[Kathāvatthu]] the idea is partly refuted by Theravādins.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=469}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1971|p=216}} Other scholars have pointed out that the doctrine of the transfer of merit can be found early in the Theravāda tradition.{{sfn|Keyes|1977|p=287}}{{sfn|Egge|2013|p=96}}{{sfn|Malalasekera|1967|p=89}} Then there also scholars who propose that, although the transfer of merit did not exist {{em|as such}} in early Buddhism, early doctrines did form a basis for it, the transfer of merit being an "inherent consequence" (Bechert) of these early doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author-link=Bhikkhu Analayo|date=2010|title=Saccaka's Challenge–A Study of the Saṃyukta-āgama Parallel to the Cūḷasaccaka-sutta in Relation to the Notion of Merit Transfer|url=http://www.chibs.edu.tw/ch_html/chbj/23/Analayo%2039-70.pdf|journal=Chung-Hwa Buddhist Journal|volume=23|pages=60–2|issn=1017-7132|last1=Anālayo|first1=Bhikkhu}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gombrich|1971|p=210}}{{sfn|Bechert|1992|p=105}}

The idea that a certain power could be transferred from one to another was known before the arising of Buddhism. In religious texts such as the [[Mahābhārata]], it is described that ''devas'' can transfer certain powers (''{{lang-sa|tejas}}''). A similar belief existed with regard to the energy gained by [[Asceticism#Indian religions|performing austerities]] (''{{lang-sa|tapas}}''). Apart from these transfers of power, a second origin is found in [[Veneration of the dead#India|Brahamanical ancestor worship]].{{sfn|Pye|Strong|1987|p=5874}} In the period preceding the arising of Buddhism, it was believed that after a person's death he had to be transformed from a wandering ''preta'' to reach the blissful world of the ''pitṛs.'' This was done through the complex ''[[Śrāddha]]'' ceremonies, which would secure the destiny of the deceased as a ''pitṛ''. In Buddhism, however, ancestor worship was discontinued, as it was believed that the dead would not reach heavenly bliss through rituals or worship, but only through the law of karma. Nevertheless, the practice of transfer of merit arose by using the ethical and psychological principles of karma and merit, and connect these with the sense of responsibility towards one's parents. This sense of responsibility was typical for pre-Buddhist practices of ancestor worship. As for the veneration of dead ancestors, this was replaced by veneration of the Sangha.{{sfn|Holt|1981|pp=5–10, 17, 19–20}}{{sfn|Bechert|1992|pp=99–100}}

In South and South-East Asia, merit-making was not only a practice for the mass, but was also practiced by the higher echelons of society. Kingship and merit-making went together.{{sfn|Aung-Thwin|Aung-Thwin|2013|p=84}}{{sfn|Scott|2009|pp=98–102}} In the Tipiṭaka, ideas about good governance were framed in terms of the ideal of the '[[Cakravartin|wheel-turning monarch]]' (''{{lang-pi|Cakkavatti}}''; ''{{lang-sa|Cakravartin}}''), the king who rules righteously and non-violently according to [[Dharma#Eusebeia and dharma|Dharma]].{{sfn|Harvey|2000|pp=114–5}} His roles and duties are discussed extensively in Buddhist texts. The ''Cakkavatti'' is a moral example to the people and possesses enough spiritual merit.

In these vernacular Pāli works, examples are given of royalty performing meritorious acts, sometimes as a form of [[repentance]] for previously committed wrongdoings. The emperor [[Ashoka|Asoka]] ({{lang-sa|Aśoka}}) is featured as an important patron supporting the Sangha.{{sfn|Salguero|2013|p=346}}

Because of these traditions, kings have had an important role in maintaining the Sangha, and publicly performed grand acts of merit, as is testified by [[epigraphic]] evidence from South and South-East Asia.{{sfn|Marasinghe|2003|p=472}}{{sfn|Scott|2009|pp=98–102}} In Sri Lanka, from the tenth century CE onward, kings have assumed the role of a lay protector of the Sangha, and so have Thai kings, during the [[Sukhothai period|periods of Sukhothai]] and [[Ayutthaya period|Ayutthaya]] (fourteenth until eighteenth centuries). In fact, a number of kings in Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Burma have described themselves as ''Bodhisattas'', and [[epithets]] and [[Thai honorifics#Honorific registers|royal language]] were established accordingly.{{sfn|Aung-Thwin|Aung-Thwin|2013|p=84}}{{sfn|Keyes|1977|p=288}}{{sfn|Jory|2002|p=52}} In short, kingship in traditional Buddhist societies was connected with the Sangha as a field of merit: the king assumed an exemplary role as a donor to the Sangha, and the Sangha legitimated the king as a leader of the state. Both facilitated one another, and both needed each other.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=117}} In times of famine or other hardship, it was traditionally believed that the king was failing, and the king would typically perform meritorious activities on a grand scale.{{sfn|Rotman|2008}}{{sfn|Jory|2002|p=53}}{{sfn|Aung-Thwin|Aung-Thwin|2013|p=183}} In this way the king would be able to improve the kingdom's conditions, through his "overflow karma" (Walters).{{sfn|Walters|2003|p=19}} A similar role was played by queens.&lt;ref name="Holt 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holt|first1=John Clifford|last2=Kinnard,|first2=Jacob N.|last3=Walters|first3=Jonathan S.|title=Constituting communities Theravada Buddhism and the religious cultures of South and Southeast Asia|date=2003|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|location=Albany|isbn=978-0-7914-5691-0|page=3|url=http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/constituting_communities_-_theravada_buddhism_and_the_religious_cultures_of_south_and_southeast_asia.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last seven centuries in Thailand, the Vessantara Jātaka has played a significant role in legitimating kingship in Thailand, through a yearly festival known as the 'Preaching of the Great Life' ({{RTGS|Thet Mahachat}}). Merit-making and ''[[pāramī]]s'' (doing good deeds, developing good habits to become a Buddha) were greatly emphasized in this festival, through the story about Prince Vessantara's generosity. During the reform period of Rama IV, as Thai Buddhism was [[Buddhist modernism|being modernized]], the festival was dismissed as not reflecting true Buddhism. Its popularity has greatly diminished ever since. Nevertheless, the use of merit-making by the Thai monarchy and government, to solidify their position and create unity in society, has continued until the late twentieth century.{{sfn|Jory|2016|pp=20, 181-2}}

=== 19th–early 20th century ===
Buddhists are not in agreement with regard to the interpretation, role, and importance of merit. The role of merit-making in Buddhism has been discussed throughout Buddhist history, but much more so in the last centuries. In the nineteenth century, during the rise of Buddhist modernism and the Communist regimes, Buddhists in South and Southeast Asia became more critical about merit-making when it became associated with magical practices, privileging, [[Ritualization|ritualism]] and waste of resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Kleinod|first1=Michael|editor1-last=Athyal|editor1-first=Jesudas M.|encyclopedia=Religion in Southeast Asia: An Encyclopedia of Faiths and Cultures|title=Laos|date=2015|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-250-2|page=152|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-RfYBgAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Scott|2009|pp=90–1}}{{sfn|Cate|Lefferts|2006|p=588}}{{Refn|group=note|From the 1980s onward, the communist regimes in Laos and Cambodia no longer viewed Buddhism as an obstacle to the development of the state, and many of the restrictions with regard to Buddhist practice were lifted. {{sfn|Cate|Lefferts|2006|p=590}}{{sfn|Marston|2006|p=169}} In Burma, the former military government approached merit-making practices differently: they justified their [[forced labor camp]]s by citing that the labor there yielded merit. At the same time, [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] referred to the struggle for democracy as ''meritorious''.{{sfn|Calkowski|2006|pp=106–7}}}} In  pre-modern Thailand, a great deal of the funds of temples were derived from the profits of land that were offered to temples by royalty and nobility. During the period of religious reform and administrative centralization in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, however, Thai temples were no longer supported in this manner and had to find other ways to maintain themselves.{{sfn|Fuengfusakul|1998|pp=53-4}}

At the beginning of the twentieth century, perspectives of merit-making had changed again, as merit-making was being associated with [[capitalism]] and [[consumerism]], which had been rising in South and Southeast Asia.{{sfn|Scott|2009|pp=90–1, 126}}{{sfn|Skilling|2005|p=9833}} Furthermore, in some Buddhist countries, such as Thailand, there is a tendency among teachers and practitioners to dismiss and even revile merit-making in favor of teachings about detachment and attaining Nirvana, for which [[L.

=== From 1960s onward ===
Studies done in the 1960s and 1970s in Thailand, Sri Lanka and Burma showed that a great deal of time, effort and money was invested by people in merit-making, e.g. Spiro described Burma's rural economy as "geared to the overriding goal of the accumulation of wealth as a means of acquiring merit". In some studies done in rural Burma, up to thirty percent of people's income was spent on merit-making.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=192}} In 2014, when Burma ranked highest on the [[World Giving Index]] (tied with the United States, and followed by many other Buddhist countries), scholars attributed this to the Burmese habit of merit-making.&lt;ref name="Fuller 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fuller|first1=Paul|title=The act of giving: what makes Myanmar so charitable?|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/lifestyle/16317-the-act-of-giving-what-makes-myanmar-so-charitable.html|accessdate=13 October 2016|work=[[Myanmar Times]]|date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cole|first1=Diane|title=You'll Never Guess The Most Charitable Nation In The World|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/11/28/457101304/youll-never-guess-the-most-charitable-nation-in-the-world|work=[[NPR]]|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies done in Thailand, however, showed that in the 1980s merit-making was declining, and a significant group did no longer believe in karma—though this was not a majority.{{sfn|Basham|1989|pp=128–9, 133}} Some scholars disagree with these findings, however, saying that Buddhist practices such as merit-making  are still very widespread.{{sfn|Skilling|2005|p=9833}} Similar observations have been made about Cambodia and even about Thai people in the United States.{{sfn|Kent|Chandler|2008|p=13}}{{sfn|Bao|2005}} As for Buddhist "converts" in the west, for example [[Buddhism in the United Kingdom|from the United Kingdom]], the interest in merit is less than among Asian Buddhists, but they strongly appreciate the generosity and reverence as exhibited by Asian Buddhists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bell|first1=Sandra|title=British theravada Buddhism: Otherworldly theories, and the theory of exchange|journal=Journal of Contemporary Religion|date=25 June 2008|volume=13|issue=2|page=156|doi=10.1080/13537909808580828}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heine|first1=Steven|last2=Wright|first2=Dale S.|title=Zen ritual : studies of Zen theory in practice|date=2008|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-530467-1|page=64|url=http://terebess.hu/zen/ZenRitual.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discussion by scholars ===
Some scholars have suggested that merit-making may have affected the economies of Buddhist countries in a negative way, because spending savings on the local temple would prevent consumption and investment and therefore stunt economic growth. Other researchers have disagreed, pointing out that spending resources on a Buddhist temple does stimulate economic growth through the investment in goods for the temple.&lt;ref name="KRC 2005" /&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2000|p=193}}{{refn|group=note|Since the 2000s, studies in China have shown a growing interest among local government officials to promote merit-making activities, believing it to stimulate local economy.{{sfn|Fisher|2008|p=152}}}} It has also been suggested that even if the economy of Buddhist countries would be better off without merit-making, it would result in an economy that the majority of the population would not prefer. Another criticism often leveled at merit-making in modern times is that it prevents people from using their resources to help the poor and needy. Very often, however, temples do have many social roles in society, and offer help to many groups in society—resources are therefore redistributed widely.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|pp=193–4}}{{sfn|Fisher|2008|loc=passim.}} Moreover, since merit-making is often done as a community, merit-making may strengthen [[social ties]], which Walters calls "sociokarma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cubs.chula.ac.th/images/research/58_2/Dhammakaya_Full.pdf|last =Fuengfusakul|first=Apinya|year= 1998| script-title=ศาสนาทัศน์ของชุมชนเมืองสมัยใหม่: ศึกษากรณีวัดพระธรรมกาย|trans-title=Religious Propensity of Urban Communities: A Case Study of Phra Dhammakaya Temple|language=th|publisher=Buddhist Studies Center, [[Chulalongkorn University]]|pages=53, 57}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Harvey|2000|pp=193–4}}{{sfn|Walters|2003|p=3}}

Scholars have often connected the notion of karma to the [[determinism]] in the [[caste system in India]].{{sfn|Hanks|1962|p=1248}} Just like in the case of karma, some scholars believe that a belief in merit can cause social differences to stay unchanged. This would be the case when the poor, who cannot make much merit, resign to their fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:857291/FULLTEXT01.pdf|title=Buddhist Practice in Rural Kandal Province, 1960 and 2003|last=Nissen|first=Christine J.|date=2008|encyclopedia=People of virtue: Reconfiguring religion, power and moral order in Cambodia today|publisher=[[Nordic Centre in Shanghai|NIAS]]|isbn=978-87-7694-036-2|edition=Reprint|location=Copenhagen|page=276|editor1-last=Kent|editor1-first=Alexandra|editor2-last=Chandler|editor2-first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Gutschow|2004|p=18}} Other scholars point out that merit can be used to improve social status in the present, as in the case of someone ordaining as a monk for a few years.{{sfn|Keyes|1977|p=287}} And vice versa, if someone's social status quickly deteriorates, for example, due to quick changes in the bureaucratic structure, these changes might be justified in Buddhist societies because someone's store of merit is believed to have run out.{{sfn|Basham|1989|pp=127–8}} Someone's position in society, even in the cosmos, is always subject to the impermanent workings of merit and demerit. In traditional Buddhist societies, quick changes in position, status, or roles are therefore considered part of life, and this insecurity is a motivator in trying to improve the situation through merit-making.{{sfn|Hanks|1962|pp=1247–8, 1252}}{{sfn|Keyes|1973|p=97}} Findly points out that in Buddhist ideals of merit-making, the earned value gained by doing good deeds is more important than the assigned value gained by social status at birth.{{sfn|Findly|2003|pp=261–2}}

&lt;!--"Faith in Buddhism#Millenarianism" links here. Please adjust wikilink over there if this section is (re)moved.--&gt;
The idea of merit is also at the basis of the {{dfn|''Phu Mi Bun''}} movements as has been studied in Thailand and other Buddhist societies. ''Phu Mi Bun'' are people who are considered to have much merit from past lives, whose influence morally affects society at large.{{sfn|Harvey|2000|pp=261–2}}{{sfn|Keyes|1983|p=269}}{{sfn|Mulder|1979|p=117}} ''Phu Mi Bun'' are in many ways similar to people declared ''Bodhisattvas'' in Buddhist societies, and in fact, the word ''Phu Mi Bun'' is often used in traditional Thai texts about the previous lives of the Buddha. Besides the example of the king himself, certain monks and ''[[shamans]]'' have assumed this role throughout history. In Thailand, around the turn of the twentieth century, a [[millennialist]] movement arose regarding the coming of a ''Phu Mi Bun'', to the extent of becoming an insurgency which was suppressed by the government.{{sfn|Keyes|1977|pp=288–90}}{{sfn|Keyes|1973|pp=101–2}}{{sfn|Jory|2002|pp=45-6}} This insurgency became known to Thai historians as the "rebellion of the ''Phu Mi Bun''" ({{RTGS|Kabot Phu Mi bun}}), commonly known in English as the [[Holy Man's Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murdoch|first1=John B.|title=The 1901–1902" Holy Man's" Rebellion|journal=[[Journal of the Siam Society]]|date=1967|volume=5|pages=78–86|url=http://www.siamese-heritage.org/jsspdf/1971/JSS_062_1e_Murdoch_1901to1902HolyMansRebellion.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of such rebellions involving ''Phu Mi Bun'' have taken place in the history of Thai, Laos, Cambodia and Burma. For example, in Cambodia, there were ''Phu Mi Bun''–led revolts against the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia|French control of Cambodia]].{{sfn|Kent|Chandler|2008|p=5}} Lucien Hanks has shown that beliefs pertaining to ''Phu Mi Bun'' have profoundly affected the way Thai people relate to authority.{{sfn|Hanks|1962}} [[Arthur Llewellyn Basham|Indologist Arthur Basham]], however, believed that in contemporary Thai society the ''Phu Mi Bun'' is more of a label, and ''merit'' more of a secular term than a deeply-rooted belief.{{sfn|Basham|1989|loc=pp. 134–5 n.1}}

=== Merit release ===
{{Main|Life release}}
One merit-making practice that has received more scholarly attention since the 1990s is the practice of "merit release". Merit release is a ritual of releasing animals from captivity, as a way to make merit. Merit release is a practice common in many Buddhist societies, and has since the 2010s made a comeback in some societies.&lt;ref name="Economist 2015" /&gt; Its origins are unclear, but traditionally it is said to originate from the Mahāyāna ''[[Humane King Sutra]]'', among other sources.&lt;ref name="Nuwer 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|date=8 January 2012|title=Buddhist Ceremonial Release of Captive Birds May Harm Wildlife|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/buddhist-ceremonial-release-captive-birds-may-harm-wildlife|journal=[[Scientific American]]|last1=Nuwer|first1=Rachel|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Shiu|Stokes|2008|p=184}} It often involves a large number of animals which are released simultaneously, as well as [[Buddhist chant|chanting]], making a resolution, and transfer of merits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Severinghaus|first1=Lucia Liu|last2=Chi|first2=Li|title=Prayer animal release in Taiwan|journal=Biological Conservation|date=1999|volume=89|issue=3|page=301|doi=10.1016/S0006-3207(98)00155-4|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320798001554}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Shiu|Stokes|2008|p=186}} Though the most common practice is the releasing of fish and birds back in nature, there are also other forms: in Tibet, animals are bought from the slaughterhouse to release.{{sfn|Darlington|2016|time=25}} However, the practice has come under criticism by wildlife [[conservationists]] and scholars. Studies done in Cambodia, Hong Kong and Taiwan have shown that the practice may not only be fatal for a high percentage of the released animals, but may also affect the survival of [[threatened species]], create a black market for wildlife, as well as pose a threat for public hygiene.&lt;ref name="Nuwer 2012" /&gt;{{sfn|Darlington|2016|time=30}} Some Buddhist organizations have responded to this by adjusting their practices, by working together with conservationist organizations to educate people, and even by pushing for new laws controlling the practice.{{sfn|Darlington|2016|time=29,32–33}} {{as of|2016|alt=In 2016}}, the [[Society for Conservation Biology]] (SCB) started discussing possible solutions with religious communities on how the practice could be adapted. According to the SCB, the communities have generally responded positively.&lt;ref name="Nuwer 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religion and Conservation Biology|url=http://conbio.org/groups/working-groups/religion-and-conservation-biology|website=conbio.org|publisher=Society for Conservation Biology|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, in some countries, laws have been issued to control the practice. In Singapore, to limit merit release on [[Vesak]] celebrations, people were fined.{{sfn|Shiu|Stokes|2008|p=184}}

Despite its critics, merit release continues to grow, and has also developed new forms in western countries. In 2016, it was widely reported that the Canada-based Great Enlightenment Buddhist Institute Society (GEBIS) had released {{convert|600|lbs|kg}} of lobsters in the ocean. The release was planned in agreement with local lobster-men.&lt;ref name="Ross 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ross|first1=Shane|title=P.E.I. monks buy 600&amp;nbsp;lbs of lobster to release them into ocean|url=http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/prince-edward-island/pei-monks-free-lobsters-1.3672032|accessdate=17 October 2016|work=[[CBC News]]|agency=[[CBC/Radio-Canada]]|date=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Wendy Cook from Lincoln, United States, bought fourteen rabbits from a farm to raise them under better conditions. The costly release, advertised on Facebook as ''The Great Rabbit Liberation of 2016'', was supported by Buddhist monastics from Singapore and the Tibetan tradition, and was based on the idea of merit-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wangsness|first1=Lisa|title=The great rabbit pardon of 2016|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/09/17/the-great-rabbit-pardon/O4cv6vYM9ssmB3o0BRQRxK/story.html|accessdate=17 October 2016|work=[[Boston Globe]]|date=17 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a less successful attempt, two Taiwanese Buddhists released crab and lobsters in the sea at [[Brighton]], United Kingdom, to make merit. They were fined by the authorities for £15,000 for a wildlife offense that could have significant impact on native species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two Buddhists fined £15,000 for releasing crustaceans into sea|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/23/two-buddhists-fined-15000-releasing-non-native-crustaceans-sea-brighton|accessdate=20 November 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{IAST|'''''Micchāmi Dukkaḍaṃ''''' (मिच्छामि दुक्कडम्)}} is an ancient Indian phrase, which is translated from [[Prakrit]] to literally mean "may all the evil that has been done be fruitless." &lt;ref name=cha&gt;Chapple. C.K. (2006) ''Jainism and Ecology: Nonviolence in the Web of Life'' Delhi:Motilal Banarasidas Publ. {{ISBN|978-81-208-2045-6}} p.46&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used to seek forgiveness and to mean, "If I have offended you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought, word or deed, then I seek your forgiveness."&lt;ref name=iex/&gt; 

It is used widely in [[Jainism|the Jain religion]] on the last day ([[Samvatsari]] or [[Kshamavani]]) of [[Paryushana]], the most important annual holy event of the Jain calendar.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/13/stories/2007091353590500.htm|title=Jains pray for peace, brotherhood |author=|date=2007-09-13|accessdate= 2009-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jyoga/&gt; As a matter of ritual, Jains greet their friends and relatives on this last day with ''Micchāmi Dukkaḍaṃ'', seeking their forgiveness. No private quarrel or dispute should be carried beyond this time. The importance of forgiveness in [[Jainism]] may be compared to the importance of [[Forgiveness|forgiveness in other religions]].

The phrase is also used by [[Jainism|Jains]] throughout the year when a person makes a mistake, or recollects making one in everyday life, or when asking for forgiveness in advance for inadvertent ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Śramana Bhagavān Mahāvira: pt. 1.

At the end of the festival [[Paryushana]], devotees request forgiveness for any offenses committed during the year by saying ‘Micchami Dukkadam’ or ‘Uttam Kshama’ meaning “If I have offended you in any way, knowingly or unknowingly, in thought, word or deed, then I seek your forgiveness.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/webspecial/paryushana-2017-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-jain-festival-of-forgiveness/1123051|title=Paryushana 2017: All you need to know about the Jain festival of forgiveness {{!}} Free Press Journal|date=2017-08-17|work=Free Press Journal|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
''micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ'' is most commonly used on the last day (''[[Samvatsari]]'') of one of the most holy annual Jain events, [[Paryushana]]. After ''[[pratikramana]]'' (Jain prayer, literally meaning "introspection"), [[Jainism|Jains]] seek forgiveness from almost all the creatures of the world whom they may have harmed knowingly or unknowingly by uttering the phrase—''micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ''.&lt;ref name=iex&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Indian Express]]|url=http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Request-for-Forgiveness/355457/|title=Request for Forgiveness|author=Preeti Srivastav|date=2008-08-31|accessdate=2009-11-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001054813/http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Request-for-Forgiveness/355457/|archivedate=2012-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Jainism: the world of conquerors, (Vol. 1)|author=Natubhai Shah|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|year=1998 |isbn=1-898723-30-3 |page=212 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EmVzvUzbwegC&amp;pg=PA212&amp;dq=Michchhami+Dukkadam&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZoRfTrdWzdCtB4yixLUP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Michchhami%20Dukkadam&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paryushana]] frequently falls in August or September during [[Chaturmas|Cāturmāsa]], four months into the rainy season. This annual holy time for [[Jainism|Jains]] is reserved for prayers, meditation, introspection, penance, and fasting. Even the wandering monks temporarily abandon their wandering life and settle down amidst laymen, giving discourses and organizing scriptural recitations.&lt;ref name=jyoga/&gt;

Traditionally, letters were sent and telephone calls made to friends and relatives asking their forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, James (2003), Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics Part 10, Kessinger Publishing {{ISBN|978-0-7661-3682-3}} p.876&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The phrase ''michchāmi dukkaḍaṃ'' is also found in the ''Airyapathiki Sutra''.&lt;ref name=jyoga/&gt; It literally means — may all the evil that has been done be fruitless, and comes from the [[Prakrit]] language, a [[Middle Indo-Aryan languages|middle Indo-Aryan language,]] closely linked with [[Pali]] and used abundantly in the Prakrit canon of [[Jainism]].&lt;ref name=cha/&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The [[Sanskrit]] version''(chayā)'' of the phrase is ''mithyā me duṣkṛitām'' meaning "may the evil of it be in vain".&lt;ref name=jyoga&gt;{{cite book |title=Jaina yoga: a survey of the mediaeval śrāvakācāras|author= R. Williams|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |year=1991|isbn=81-208-0775-8 |page=205 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LLKcrIJ6oscC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=Michchhami+Dukkadam&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZoRfTrdWzdCtB4yixLUP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Michchhami%20Dukkadam&amp;f=false |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or simply put "May my misdeeds be undone."&lt;br&gt;
''mithyā'' refers to 'being fruitless' or 'getting absolved of'. ''me'' refers to 'my'. ''duṣkṛitām'' refers to 'bad deeds'.

'''''Money For Nothing''''' is a British television programme hosted by Sarah Moore, Jay Blades and Ethan-James Osborne that airs on [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvkev.co.uk/content/money-nothing-show-was-unsalvageable|title=Money For Nothing: this show was unsalvageable|author=Kevin O'Sullivan|publisher= tvkev.co.uk|date=20 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903073829/http://www.tvkev.co.uk/content/money-nothing-show-was-unsalvageable|archivedate = 3 September 2017|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b077nzdc|title=Money for Nothing - BBC One|website=BBC|accessdate=22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The premise of the programme is to take items that other people have disposed of and which the presenter rescues from council refuse collection sites. With the help of a designer they are turned into desirable items, which are then sold. Any profit made is then returned to the individual(s) who disposed of the item originally. The show voice-over is provided by comedian and writer [[Arthur Smith (comedian)|Arthur Smith]]. ''Celebrity Money for Nothing'' is a related program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frielkeanfilms.com/?page=productions/celebrity-money-for-nothing|title=Celebrity Money for Nothing|website=Friel Kean Films|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular designers and craftspeople include: Norman Wilkinson, Rupert Blanchard, Forge Creative (Josh Kennard &amp; Oliver "Oli" Milne), Sarah Peterson, Neil Wragg, Ray Clarke, Daniel Health, Mark 'Horse' Philips, Bex Simon, The Rag and Bone Man, Guy Trench.

The '''multiplicative weights update method''' is an algorithmic technique most commonly used for decision making and prediction, and also widely deployed in game theory and algorithm design. The simplest use case is the problem of prediction from expert advice, in which a decision maker needs to iteratively decide on an expert whose advice to follow. The method assigns initial weights to the experts (usually identical initial weights), and updates these weights multiplicatively and iteratively according to the feedback of how well an expert performed: reducing it in case of poor performance, and increasing it otherwise. &lt;ref name = ref1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoryofcomputing.org/articles/v008a006/v008a006.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Multiplicative Weights Update Method: A Meta-Algorithm and Applications |date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered repeatedly in very diverse fields such as machine learning ([[AdaBoost]], [[Winnow (algorithm)|Winnow]], Hedge), [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]] (solving [[Linear programming|linear programs]]), theoretical computer science (devising fast algorithm for [[Linear programming|LPs]] and [[Semidefinite programming|SDPs]]), and [[game theory]].

==Name==
"Multiplicative weights" implies the iterative rule used in algorithms derived from the multiplicative weight update method.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15859-f11/www/notes/lecture16.pdf |format=PDF |title= The Multiplicative Weights Algorithm* |access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is given with different names in the different fields where it was discovered or rediscovered.

==History and background==
The earliest known version of this technique was in an algorithm named "[[fictitious play]]" which was proposed in [[game theory]] in the early 1950s. Grigoriadis and Khachiyan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |format=PDF |title= A sublinear-time randomized approximation algorithm for matrix games. |date=1995 |access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied a randomized variant of "fictitious play" to solve two-player [[zero-sum game]]s efficiently using the multiplicative weights algorithm. In this case, player allocates higher weight to the actions that had a better outcome and choose his strategy relying on these weights. In [[machine learning]], Littlestone applied the earliest form of the multiplicative weights update rule in his famous [[Winnow (algorithm)|winnow algorithm]], which is similar to Minsky and Papert's earlier [[Perceptron|perceptron learning algorithm]]. Later, he generalized the winnow algorithm to weighted majority algorithm. Freund and Schapire followed his steps and generalized the winnow algorithm in the form of hedge algorithm.

The multiplicative weights algorithm is also widely applied in [[computational geometry]] such as [[Kenneth L. Clarkson|Clarkson's]] algorithm for [[Linear programming|linear programming (LP)]] with a bounded number of variables in linear time.&lt;ref name="KENNETH L. CLARKSON pp. 452"&gt;KENNETH L. CLARKSON. '' A Las Vegas algorithm for linear programming when the dimension is small.'', In Proc. 29th FOCS, pp. 452–456. IEEE Comp. Soc. Press, 1988.[doi:10.1109/SFCS.1988.21961] 123, 152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KENNETH L. CLARKSON 1995"&gt;KENNETH L. CLARKSON. ''A Las Vegas algorithm for linear and integer programming when the dimension is small.'', J. ACM, 42:488–499, 1995. [doi:10.1145/201019.201036] 123, 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Bronnimann and Goodrich employed analogous methods to find [[Set cover problem|set covers]] for [[hypergraph]]s with small [[VC dimension]].&lt;ref name="M.T. GOODRICH. 1995"&gt;H. BRONNIMANN AND ¨ M.T. GOODRICH. ''Almost optimal set covers in finite VC-dimension.'', Discrete Comput. Geom., 14:463–479, 1995. Preliminary version in 10th Ann. Symp. Comp. Geom. (SCG'94). [doi:10.1007/BF02570718] 123, 152&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Operations research|operation research]] and on-line statistical decision making problem field, the weighted majority algorithm and its more complicated versions have been found independently.

In computer science field, some researchers have previously observed the close relationships between multiplicative update algorithms used in different contexts. Young discovered the similarities between fast LP algorithms and Raghavan's method of pessimistic estimators for derandomization of randomized rounding algorithms; Klivans and Servedio linked boosting algorithms in learning theory to proofs of Yao's XOR Lemma; Garg and Khandekar defined a common framework for convex optimization problems that contains Garg-Konemann and Plotkin-Shmoys-Tardos as subcases.&lt;ref name=ref4&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.satyenkale.com/papers/mw-survey.pdf |format=PDF |title= The Multiplicative Weights Update Method: A Meta-Algorithm and Applications |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General setup==
A binary decision needs to be made based on n experts’ opinions to attain an associated payoff. In the first round, all experts’ opinions have the same weight. The decision maker will make the first decision based on the majority of the experts' prediction. Then, in each successive round, the decision maker will repeatedly update the weight of each expert's opinion depending on the correctness of his prior predictions. Real life examples includes predicting if it is rainy tomorrow or if the stock market will go up or go down.

==Algorithm analysis==

===Halving algorithm&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15859-f11/www/notes/lecture16.pdf |format=PDF |title= The Multiplicative Weights Algorithm* |access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

Given a sequential game played between an adversary and an aggregator who is advised by N experts, the goal is for the aggregator to make as few mistakes as possible. Assume there is an expert among the N experts who always gives the correct prediction. In the halving algorithm, only the consistent experts are retained. Experts who make mistakes will be dismissed. For every decision, the aggregator decides by taking a majority vote among the remaining experts. Therefore, every time the aggregator makes a mistake, at least half of the remaining experts are dismissed. The aggregator makes at most  {{math|log&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;(''N'')}} mistakes.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/academic/class/15859-f11/www/notes/lecture16.pdf |format=PDF |title= The Multiplicative Weights Algorithm* |access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weighted majority algorithm&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref5&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall13/cos521/lecnotes/lec8.pdf |format=PDF |title= Lecture 8: Decision-making under total uncertainty: the multiplicative weight algorithm |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

Unlike halving algorithm which dismisses experts who have made mistakes, weighted majority algorithm discounts their advice. Given the same "expert advice" setup, suppose we have n decisions, and we need to select one decision for each loop. In each loop, every decision incurs a cost. All costs will be revealed after making the choice. The cost is 0 if the expert is correct, and 1 otherwise. this algorithm's goal is to limit its cumulative losses to roughly the same as the best of experts.
The very first algorithm that makes choice based on majority vote every iteration does not work since the majority of the experts can be wrong consistently every time. The weighted majority algorithm corrects above trivial algorithm by keeping a weight of experts instead of fixing the cost at either 1 or 0.&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt; This would make fewer mistakes compared to halving algorithm.

    '''Initialization''': 
       Fix an &lt;math&gt;\eta \le 1/2&lt;/math&gt;. For each expert, associate the weight &lt;math&gt;{w_i}^1&lt;/math&gt;≔1.
    '''For''' &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\mathit{1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathit{2}&lt;/math&gt;,…,&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;
       '''1'''. Make the prediction that is the weighted majority of the experts' predictions based on the weights &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{w_1}^t,..., \mathbb{w_n}^t&lt;/math&gt;. That is, making a binary choice depending on which prediction has a higher total weight of experts advising it (breaking ties arbitrarily). 
       '''2'''. For every expert i who predicts wrongly, decrease his weight for the next round by multiplying it by a factor of (1-η):
                                                              &lt;math&gt;w_{i}^{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;=&lt;math&gt;(1-\eta) w_{i}^{t}&lt;/math&gt; (update rule)

If &lt;math&gt;\eta =0&lt;/math&gt;, the weight of the expert's advice will remain the same. When &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; increases, the weight of the expert's advice will decrease. Note that some researchers fix &lt;math&gt;\eta =1/2&lt;/math&gt; in weighted majority algorithm.

After &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; steps, let &lt;math&gt;m_i^T&lt;/math&gt; be the number of mistakes of expert i and &lt;math&gt;M^T&lt;/math&gt; be the number of mistakes our algorithm has made. Then we have the following bound for every &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;:

                              &lt;math&gt;M^T \leq 2(1+\eta) m_i^T+ \frac{2 \ln(n)}{\eta}&lt;/math&gt;.

In particular, this holds for i which is the best expert. Since the best expert will have the least &lt;math&gt;m_i^T&lt;/math&gt;, it will give the best bound on the number of mistakes made by the algorithm as a whole.

===Randomized weighted majority algorithm&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref6&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos511/scribe_notes/0330.pdf |format=PDF |title=COS 511: Foundations of Machine Learning |date=20 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;===
Given the same setup with N experts. Consider the special situation where the proportions of experts predicting positive and negative, counting the weights, are both close to 50%. Then, there might be a tie. Following the weight update rule in weighted majority algorithm, the predictions made by the algorithm would be randomized. The algorithm calculates the probabilities of experts predicting positive or negatives, and then makes a random decision based on the computed fraction:

predict  
:&lt;math&gt;
f(x) = \begin{cases}1 &amp; \text{with probability} \frac{q_1}{W}\\0 &amp; \text{otherwise}\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where    
                &lt;math&gt;W= \sum_{i} { w_i} = q_0 + q_1&lt;/math&gt;.

The number of mistakes made by the randomized weighted majority algorithm is bounded as: 
                 &lt;math&gt;E\left [ \# \text{mistakes of the learner} \right ] \leq \alpha_\beta \left ( \# \text{ mistakes of the best expert} \right ) + c_\beta \ln(N) &lt;/math&gt;

where     &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\beta= \frac{\ln(\frac{1}{\beta})}{1-\beta}&lt;/math&gt; and          &lt;math&gt;c_\beta=\frac{1}{1-\beta}&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that only the learning algorithm is randomized. The underlying assumption is that the examples and experts' predictions are not random. The only randomness is the randomness where the learner makes his own prediction.
In this randomized algorithm, &lt;math&gt;\alpha_\beta \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\beta \rightarrow 1&lt;/math&gt;. Compared to weighted algorithm, this randomness halved the number of mistakes the algorithm is going to make.&lt;ref name=ref7 /&gt; However, it is important to note that in some research, people define &lt;math&gt;\eta =1/2&lt;/math&gt; in weighted majority algorithm and allow &lt;math&gt;0\leq \eta \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; in [[randomized weighted majority algorithm]].&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

==Applications==
The multiplicative weights method is usually used to solve a constrained optimization problem. Let each expert be the constraint in the problem, and the events represent the points in the area of interest. The punishment of the expert corresponds to how well its corresponding constraint is satisfied on the point represented by an event.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;

===Solving zero-sum games approximately (Oracle algorithm):&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref7&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-409-topics-in-theoretical-computer-science-an-algorithmists-toolkit-fall-2009/lecture-notes/MIT18_409F09_scribe24.pdfformat=PDF |title= An Algorithmist's Toolkit |date=8 December 2009 |access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

Suppose we were given the distribution &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; on experts. Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; = payoff matrix of a finite two-player zero-sum game, with &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; rows.

When the row player &lt;math&gt;p_r&lt;/math&gt; uses plan &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and the column player &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; uses plan &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;, the payoff of player &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;A \left ( i, j \right)&lt;/math&gt;≔&lt;math&gt;A_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, assuming &lt;math&gt;A \left( i, j\right ) \in \left [ 0, 1 \right ]&lt;/math&gt;.

If player &lt;math&gt;p_r&lt;/math&gt; chooses action &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; from a distribution &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; over the rows, then the expected result for player &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; selecting action &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;A \left (P, j \right )=E_{i \in P} \left [A \left(i,j \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;.

To maximize &lt;math&gt;A \left (P, j \right)&lt;/math&gt;, player &lt;math&gt;p_c&lt;/math&gt; is should choose plan &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, the expected payoff for player &lt;math&gt;p_l&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;A \left (i,P\right )=E_{j\in P} \left [A \left(i,j \right) \right ]&lt;/math&gt;. Choosing plan &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; would minimize this payoff. By John Von Neumann's Min-Max Theorem, we obtain:

                                           &lt;math&gt;\min_P \max_j A\left( P, j \right) = \max_Q \min_i A\left( i, Q \right) &lt;/math&gt;
where P and i changes over the distributions over rows, Q and j changes over the columns.

Then, let &lt;math&gt;\lambda^*&lt;/math&gt; denote the common value of above quantities, also named as the "value of the game". Let &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; be an error parameter. To solve the zero-sum game bounded by additive error of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;,

                                                  &lt;math&gt;\lambda^* - \delta \leq \min_i  A \left (i,q \right ) &lt;/math&gt;
                                                  &lt;math&gt;\max_j A \left(p, j \right) \leq \lambda^* +\delta &lt;/math&gt;

So there is an algorithm solving zero-sum game up to an additive factor of δ using O({{math|log&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')}}/&lt;math&gt;\delta^2&lt;/math&gt;) calls to ORACLE, with an additional processing time of O(n) per call&lt;ref name =ref7 /&gt;

===Machine learning===
In machine learning, Littlestone and Warmuth generalized the winnow algorithm to the weighted majority algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;DEAN P. FOSTER AND RAKESH VOHRA (1999). ''Regret in the on-line decision problem'', p. 29. Games and Economic Behaviour&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Freund and Schapire generalized it in the form of hedge algorithm.&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt; AdaBoost Algorithm formulated by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire also employed the Multiplicative Weight Update Method.&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt;

====Winnow algorithm====
Based on current knowledge in algorithms, multiplicative weight update method was first used in Littlestone's winnow algorithm.&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt; It is used in machine learning to solve a linear program.

Given &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; labeled examples &lt;math&gt; \left (a_1, l_1 \right ),\text{…} ,\left (a_m, l_m \right ) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a_j \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt; are feature vectors, and &lt;math&gt;l_j \in \left \{-1,1 \right \} \quad&lt;/math&gt; are their labels.

The aim is to find non-negative weights such that for all examples, the sign of the weighted combination of the features matches its labels. That is, require that &lt;math&gt;l_j a_j x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;. Without loss of generality, assume the total weight is 1 so that they form a distribution. Thus, for notational convenience, redefine &lt;math&gt;a_j&lt;/math&gt; to be &lt;math&gt;l_j a_j&lt;/math&gt;, the problem reduces to finding a solution to the following LP:

                      &lt;math&gt;\forall j=1,2,\text{…}, m : a_j x \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;,
                      &lt;math&gt;1*x=1&lt;/math&gt;,
                      &lt;math&gt;\forall i : x_i \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;.

This is general form of LP.

====Hedge algorithm &lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;====
The hedge algorithm is similar to the weighted majority algorithm. However, their exponential update rules are different.&lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;
It is generally used to solve the problem of binary allocation in which we need to allocate different portion of resources into N different options. The loss with every option is available at the end of every iteration. The goal is to reduce the total loss suffered for a particular allocation. The allocation for the following iteration is then revised, based on the total loss suffered in the current iteration using multiplicative update.&lt;ref name=ref16&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shivani-agarwal.net/Teaching/E0370/Aug-2011/Lectures/20-scribe1.pdf |format=PDF |title= Online Learning from Experts: Weighed Majority and Hedge |access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Analysis=====
Assume the learning rate &lt;math&gt;\eta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and for &lt;math&gt;t \in [T]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p^t&lt;/math&gt; is picked by Hedge. Then for all experts &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;,

                                 &lt;math&gt;\sum_{t \leq T} p^t m^t \leq \sum_{t \leq T} m^t +\frac{\ln(N)}{\eta}+\eta T&lt;/math&gt;

'''Initialization''': Fix an &lt;math&gt;\eta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. For each expert, associate the weight &lt;math&gt;w_i^1&lt;/math&gt; ≔1
'''For''' t=1,2,…,T:
       1. Pick the distribution &lt;math&gt;p_i^t= \frac{w_i^t}{\Phi t}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Phi t=\sum_i w_i^t&lt;/math&gt;.
       2. Observe the cost of the decision &lt;math&gt;m^t&lt;/math&gt;. 
       3. Set 
                               &lt;math&gt;w_i^{t + 1} = w_i^t \exp(-\eta m_i^t&lt;/math&gt;).

====AdaBoost algorithm====

[[AdaBoost|This algorithm]]&lt;ref name=ref8&gt;Yoav, Freund. Robert, E. Schapire (1996). ''TA Decision-Theoretic Generalization of On-Line Learning and an Application to Boosting*'', p. 55. journal of computer and system sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; maintains a set of weights &lt;math&gt;w^t&lt;/math&gt; over the training examples. On every iteration &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, a distribution &lt;math&gt;p^t&lt;/math&gt; is computed by normalizing these weights. This distribution is fed to the weak learner WeakLearn which generates a hypothesis &lt;math&gt;h_t&lt;/math&gt; that (hopefully) has small error with respect to the distribution. Using the new hypothesis &lt;math&gt;h_t&lt;/math&gt;, AdaBoost generates the next weight vector &lt;math&gt;w^{t+1}&lt;/math&gt;. The process repeats. After T such iterations, the final hypothesis &lt;math&gt;h_f&lt;/math&gt; is the output. The hypothesis &lt;math&gt;h_f&lt;/math&gt; combines the outputs of the T weak hypotheses using a weighted majority vote.&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt;

====Problem====
Given a &lt;math&gt;m \times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, is there a &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A x \geq b&lt;/math&gt;?

                       &lt;math&gt;\exists ? x: A x \geq b &lt;/math&gt;              (1)

====Assumption====
Using the oracle algorithm in solving zero-sum problem, with an error parameter &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, the output would either be a point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A x \geq b-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; or a proof that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; does not exist, i.e., there is no solution to this linear system of inequalities.

====solution====
Given vector &lt;math&gt;p \in \Delta_n&lt;/math&gt;, solves the following relaxed problem

                      &lt;math&gt;\exists ? x: p^{\textsf T}\!\!A x\geq p^\textsf{T}\!b&lt;/math&gt;             (2)

If there exists a x satisfying (1), then x satisfies (2) for all &lt;math&gt; p\in \Delta_n&lt;/math&gt;. The contrapositive of this statement is also true.
Suppose if oracle returns a feasible solution for a &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, the solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; it returns has bounded width &lt;math&gt;\max_i |{(A x)}_i - b_i | \leq 1&lt;/math&gt;.
So if there is a solution to (1), then there is an algorithm that its output x satisfies the system (2) up to an additive error of &lt;math&gt;2\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;. The algorithm makes at most &lt;math&gt;\frac{\ln(m)}{\epsilon^2}&lt;/math&gt; calls to a width-bounded oracle for the problem (2). The contrapositive stands true as well. The multiplicative updates is applied in the algorithm in this case.

== Background ==
'''Jamie Nabozny''' (born October 1975) went to the local public middle school in the small Wisconsin town of [[Ashland, Wisconsin|Ashland]], where his parents Bob and Carol Nabozny had grown up. His parents had a rocky relationship, which wasn't helped by poverty. In spite of this, he managed to do well in school. Bullies at Nabozny's school believed him to be effeminate and "girlish" and bullied him. The harassment reached a point where at age 13, Nabozny complained to his parents who decided to send him to live with an uncle and aunt temporarily who would [[homeschooling|homeschool]] him. Nabozny's aunt consoled him for the bullying and he shared with her the secret that he was gay but this disclosure did not fit with her religious beliefs. Nabozny ran away, and his aunt informed the police who investigated his running away and in the course of their investigation disclosed Nabozny's sexuality to his parents. His mother Carol was supportive and loving, but his father Bob reacted in anger, storming out of the room after telling Jamie that it was simply a phase.&lt;ref name="Ball"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ball|first1=Carlos A.|title=From the Closet to The Courtroom: Five LGBT Rights Lawsuits That Have Changed Our Nation|date=2010|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston, Mass|isbn=9780807001530|chapter=Harassment|pages=67–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nabozny's return to middle school led to the harassment recommencing. He told a school counselor that he had been called a "queer", a "faggot" and a "fudge packer" among other terms and confirmed to the counselor that he was indeed gay and did not wish to deny this. The counselor attempted to intervene and get the bullies to stop but it resumed shortly after the intervention.&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt; A new counselor arrived at the school who also attempted to make the bullying stop by involving the school principal, Mary Podlesny.&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jacqueline A. Stefkovich|title=Best Interests of the Student: Applying Ethical Constructs to Legal Cases in Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-da2AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA168|date=October 23, 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-92069-2|pages=167–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the intervention of the principal, the abuse soon resumed and now started including physical violence—hits, kicks and elbows.

In addition to Nabozny's sexual orientation, another fact led into his bullying. At age 11, Jamie Nabozny was molested by an 18-year-old church youth group leader named Nick Rising. He kept this abuse secret until Rising attempted to molest Jamie's younger brother. Rising was arrested, pleaded guilty at trial and went to jail. The scandal was reported in a local newspaper. A number of the bullies who were harassing Nabozny were friendly with Rising and blamed Nabozny for reporting the sexual assaults.&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt;

Nabozny's parents complained repeatedly about the bullying but after no action was taken by the principal, they pulled Jamie out of school and transferred him to a Catholic middle school to finish seventh grade.&lt;ref name="Conn2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kathleen Conn|title=Bullying and Harassment: A Legal Guide for Educators|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlJhbm0gLZUC&amp;pg=PA87|year=2004|publisher=ASCD|isbn=978-1-4166-0014-5|pages=87–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the tuition fees meant that he dropped out shortly after starting eighth grade. Jamie Nabozny had to return to the middle school where he endured more harassment, homophobic language and physical violence. In one incident, Jamie and his brother Corey were physically assaulted by a group of boys in the bathrooms.&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt;

Following this harassment, Bob and Carol Nabozny complained again to the school and demanded a meeting with the Principal. At the meeting with the Nabozny family and a number of the boys who Jamie had accused of bullying, the Principal took the word of the bullies and then also later told Jamie Nabozny that if he continued to be [[Coming out|out]] about his sexual orientation at school, the bullying would continue. The bullies faced no disciplinary actions and the harassment continued. Following a number of bullies verbally abusing him, inappropriately touching him and then enacting a mock rape&lt;ref name="Mezey2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conn2004" /&gt; while the rest of his class watched, Nabozny went to the principal who told him that "boys will be boys"&lt;ref name="Biegel2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stuart Biegel|title=The Right to be Out: Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in America's Public Schools|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQmS0_RHxt4C&amp;pg=PA11|year=2010|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-7457-2|pages=10–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LINDBRZUZY2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Amy Lind|author2=Stephanie Brzuzy|title=Battleground: Women, Gender, and Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdoIS5YdygkC&amp;pg=PA576|date=December 30, 2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-08800-1|pages=576–577}}&lt;/ref&gt; and admonished him for entering her office without an appointment. The continued bullying at middle school led to Nabozny attempting suicide, after which he refused to return to middle school.

At high school, the same bullies returned and the harassment continued. At one point, Nabozny was attacked while at a urinal and urinated upon by another boy.&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuhn2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Betsy Kuhn|title=Gay Power!: The Stonewall Riots and the Gay Rights Movement, 1969|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nRJp2Bs_tlUC&amp;pg=PA112|date=January 1, 2011|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|isbn=978-0-7613-7275-2|pages=112–113}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Davis, the principal at the high school continued the inaction—the perpetrators were not disciplined and the only advice Davis gave to Nabozny was to go home to change his clothes. He attempted suicide for a second time.

Nabozny's parents attempted to send him to live with an aunt and uncle in [[Drummond, Wisconsin]], but his uncle was hostile to his homosexuality, leading him to run away from them and hitch-hike to [[Minneapolis]]. Bob and Carol Nabozny attempted to find him in Minneapolis and distributed 'missing child' posters. Nabozny phoned the number listed on one of the posters and was reunited with his parents. Nabozny told his parents that he refused to return to the high school. They sought to homeschool him but were legally forbidden as neither had a high school diploma. They could not afford to send him to a private school, and the only private school nearby was a Christian fundamentalist school. The school district demanded that Jamie return to high school, where the bullying started again.&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt;

Nabozny's parents requested the local social services department put him into foster care out of the district so he could attend school elsewhere. At the new school, the bullying that Nabozny suffered was promptly resolved by the school. The new school seemed to boost his happiness and self-confidence as well as his grades. The social worker who had moved Nabozny demanded that he move back to his parents during tenth grade. He then had to return to the high school in Ashland, where the bullying restarted. The school continued to ignore the bullying and assistant principal Thomas Blaumert told Nabozny that his harassment was due to him provoking them and that he deserved the punishment because of his sexuality.&lt;ref name="Conn2004" /&gt; Blaumert also laughed when Nabozny was pushed and tripped in the hallway.&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt;

For over four years, no school official took any disciplinary action in response to Nabozny's reports. In the eleventh grade, he was attacked in the school library by a group of boys, one of whom repeatedly kicked him in the stomach&lt;ref name="Kuhn2011" /&gt; which caused him to have pain and a stomach cramp for weeks. The internal bleeding and bruising required surgery.

In December 1992, Nabozny collected together over $100 in cash and ran away from Ashland and took a bus to Minneapolis. In Minneapolis, he moved in with a gay church deacon and his partner who served as foster parents. He was diagnosed with [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[post traumatic stress disorder]]&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt; and spent years in therapy. Eventually, he completed his [[GED]] and became a student at the [[University of Minnesota]] and studied for a degree in psychology.&lt;ref name="Ball" /&gt;

== The case ==
Nabozny decided to sue the school district and was represented by [[Lambda Legal]], an LGBT legal organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Lambda Legal]]|url=http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/nabozny-v-podlesny.html|title=Nabozny v. Podlesny|accessdate=December 12, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725165752/http://www.lambdalegal.org/in-court/cases/nabozny-v-podlesny?qt-related_conent_for_cases=2#qt-related_conent_for_cases|archivedate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had made a policy decision in 1995 to take cases involving youth issues. Nabozny was represented by Patricia Logue, a lawyer (and lesbian) who had previously worked in corporate law before taking a job with Lambda in Chicago in 1993 along with Michael Terrien an attorney with Skadden Arps Meagher and Flom LLP. She had previously helped a black LGBT group change the policy of the [[Bud Billiken Parade]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name="Baim2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tracy Baim|title=Out and Proud in Chicago: An Overview of the City's Gay Community|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aoLGAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA188|date=September 1, 2008|publisher=Surrey Books|isbn=978-1-57284-100-0|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was brought against the school district as well as a number of the school officials. Nabozny's lawyers argued that his rights under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to equal protection and due process had been violated by the school's failure to protect him as a member of a discernible minority group, namely gay people. They also argued that his rights under Wisconsin law to not be discriminated against were violated by the school district. The plaintiffs also pointed to the existence of school anti-harassment policies and argued that they were being enforced in a discriminatory manner: when sexist abuse was reported by female students, it was quickly stopped by school officials in a way they did not do for homophobic bullying.&lt;ref name="Biegel2010" /&gt;

The District Court made a summary judgment in favor of the school district. Nabozny appealed to the Seventh Circuit federal appeals court which found that the school district had infringed his equal protection rights on the grounds of combined gender and sexual orientation discrimination, but rejected the due process claim.&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt;

Judge [[Jesse E. Eschbach]] concluded in his judgment:

: The defendants ask us to affirm the grant of qualified immunity because "there was no clear duty under the Equal Protection Clause for the individual defendants to enforce every student complaint of harassment by other students the same way." The defendants are correct in that the Equal Protection Clause does not require the government to give everyone identical treatment. Nothing we say today suggests anything to the contrary. The Equal Protection Clause does, however, require the state to treat each person with equal regard, as having equal worth, regardless of his or her status. The defendants' argument fails because they frame their inquiry too narrowly. The question is not whether they are required to treat every harassment complaint the same way: as we have noted, they are not. The question is whether they are required to give male and female students equivalent levels of protection; they are, absent an important governmental objective, and the law clearly said so prior to Nabozny's years in middle school.&lt;ref name="Stefkovich2013" /&gt;

== Reception and significance ==
Catherine A. Lugg, a professor of education at [[Rutgers University]], said that the facts of the case "clearly illustrates the public school's historic power as the ''enforcer'' of expected norms regarding gender, [[heteronormativity]] and homophobia" and also shows "how devastating a homophobic public school culture can be for queer children".&lt;ref name="CarlsonGause2007" /&gt;

In 1997, the Department of Education clarified that [[Title IX]] requires schools to provide students with an environment free of harassment and that this requirement includes gay and lesbian students.&lt;ref name="Stewart2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chuck Stewart|title=Gay and Lesbian Issues: A Reference Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdKvt-GoidYC&amp;pg=PA59|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-372-4|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the ''Nabozny'' case, other students who have brought similar cases have generally won. Such cases include:&lt;ref name="Biegel2010" /&gt;
* a student in Minnesota called Jesse Montgomery&lt;ref name="Conn2004" /&gt;
* a California student named George Loomis who suffered homophobic abuse from teachers and students. One teacher said of Loomis' ear rings: "Only two kinds of guys wear earrings, pirates and faggots, and I don't see any water around here." Loomis' case was settled in 2002 by the [[Visalia Unified School District]] for $130,000.&lt;ref name="Conn2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights_hiv-aids/groundbreaking-federal-lawsuit-settlement-school-agrees-strongest-anti-gay-hara|title=In Groundbreaking Federal Lawsuit Settlement, School Agrees To Strongest Anti-Gay Harassment Program in Nation|date=August 13, 2002|publisher=ACLU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Campos2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Campos|title=Understanding Gay and Lesbian Youth: Lessons for Straight School Teachers, Counselors, and Administrators|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jgiLaDY34AIC&amp;pg=PA89|date=September 28, 2005|publisher=R&amp;L Education|isbn=978-1-4616-5527-5|pages=87–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the students—Alana Flores—had a note taped to her locker reading "Die, die, dyke bitch. Fuck off. We'll kill you." After reporting this to the school principal, she was told: "You need to go back to class. Don't bring me this trash anymore. This is disgusting." The case settled on January 6, 2004, and the school district is now required to provide training on homophobic harassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/lgbt-rights_hiv-aids/case-background-flores-v-morgan-hill-unified-school-district|title=Case background: Flores v.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6544">The '''need for affiliation''' ('''N-Affil''') is a term that was popularized by [[David McClelland]] and describes a person's [[need]] to feel a sense of involvement and "belonging" within a [[social group]]; McClellend's thinking was strongly influenced by the pioneering work of [[Henry Murray]] who first identified underlying psychological human needs and [[motivation]]al processes (1938). It was Murray who set out a taxonomy of needs, including achievement, [[Power (sociology)|power]] and affiliation—and placed these in the context of an integrated motivational model. People with a high need for affiliation require warm [[interpersonal relationship]]s and approval from those with whom they have regular contact. Having a strong bond with others make a person feel as if they are a part of something important that creates a powerful impact. People who place high emphasis on affiliation tend to be supportive team members, but may be less effective in [[leadership position]]s. A person who takes part in a group, whether it be a movement or project, create a push towards a sense of achievement and satisfaction for the individual and the whole. 

==Definition==
Affiliation is a positive, sometimes intimate, personal relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Zimbardo, P. &amp; Formica, R. (1963). Emotional Comparison and Self-Esteem as Determinants of Affiliation. Journal of Personality, 31(2), 142 -162.&lt;/ref&gt; Affiliation can include "concern over establishing, maintaining, or restoring a positive affective relationship with another person or persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrne|first=D.|author2=U. Texas|title=Anxiety and the Experimental Arousal of Affiliation Need|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|date=1 November 1961|volume=63|series=3|page=660|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?sid=7a793d9a-cc25-4da7-91a5-72cebe7aceb5%40sessionmgr104&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=122&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=pdh&amp;AN=1963-01329-001|doi=10.1037/h0047251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Situations==
There are many situations in which people feel a need for affiliation. For example, in a business setting, when creating a new product there can be many different ideas on how to market the product. A recently hired employee might feel a need for affiliation to have their idea heard because they feel this is the best course of action. If that person's idea is a success then that individual will feel a sense of achievement. Thus, being new the employee, he decides to involve himself so he feels a sense of belonging to the rest of the employees. One situation that causes a greater need for affiliation is during a stressful situation. An example where there was an increase in the need for affiliation among individuals was right after the [[September 11 terrorist attack]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. This event led to Americans' putting their differences aside and coming together. The increase in an individual's need for affiliation allowed individuals responding to the same [[stressor]] to come together and find security in one another. Situations that include [[fear]] often lead people to want to be together and trigger a need for affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;Kassin, S., Fein, S., &amp; Markus, H. (2008). Social Psychology Seventh Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Research done by Schachter (1959) shows that fear that comes from anxiety increases the need for the person to affiliate with others who are going through the same situation or that could help them through the stressful event.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, C.R. (1979). Defining and measuring Affiliation Motivation. European Journal of Social Psychology, 9, 97-99.&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of this need changes from one person to the next, there are moments that people just want to be together.

The need for affiliation for an individual can vary over short amounts of time; there are times when individuals wish to be with others and other times to be alone. In one study, completed by Shawn O'Connor and Lorne Rosenblood, [[pager|beeper]]s were distributed to the students. The students were then asked to record, when their beepers went off, whether or not they wanted to be alone or if they wanted to be with others at that particular moment. This study was done to observe how frequently college students were in the presence of others and how frequently they were alone. The next step in this study asked for the students to record whether, at the time their beeper went off, they wanted to be alone or in the company of others. This response that they gave usually reflected which of the two situations they were experiencing the next time their beepers went off. The information retained from this study helped to show the strength of an individual's need for affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;O’Connor, S. C., &amp; Rosenblood, L.K. (1996). Affiliation motivation in everyday experience: A theoretical comparison. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 70, 513-522.&lt;/ref&gt; By showing how frequently they obtained the presence of others when they felt that it was what they wanted at that moment it showed how strong their need for affiliation was at that particular moment. 

Depending on the specific circumstances, an individual's level of need for affiliation can become increased or decreased. Yacov Rofe suggested that the need for affiliation depended on whether being with others would be useful for the situation or not. When the presence of other people was seen as being helpful in relieving an individual from some of the negative aspects of the stressor, an individual's desire to affiliate increases. However, if being with others may increase the negative aspects such as adding the possibility of embarrassment to the already present stressor, the individual's desire to affiliate with others decreases.&lt;ref&gt;Rofe, Y. (1984). Stress and affiliation: A utility theory. Psychological Review, 91, 235-250.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals are motivated to find and create a specific amount of social interactions. Each individual desires a different amount of a need for affiliation and they desire an optimal balance of time to their self and time spent with others.&lt;ref&gt;Kassin, S., Fein, S., &amp; Markus, H. (2008). Social Psychology Seventh Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Northwest Territorial Imperative''' (often shortened to the '''Northwest Imperative'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/portland-murder-suspect-appears-unlinked-northwest-s-racist-groups-n765681&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[white separatist]] idea popularized since the 1980s within [[white nationalist]] and [[white supremacy|white supremacist]] groups in the [[United States]]. According to it, adherents of these groups are encouraged to relocate to a five-state region of the [[Northwestern United States]] — ''[[viz.]]'', [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Western Montana]] (or the western part at least to [[Interstate 15]]). [[Northern California]], [[Northwestern Colorado]], [[Northern Utah]], [[Alaska]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]] are sometimes also included. The intent is to eventually declare the region an [[Aryan race|Aryan]] homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=140|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|title=White Rage: The Extreme Right and American Politics|author=Martin Durham|isbn=0415362334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3805">'''Organic memory''' is a discredited biological theory, held in the late nineteenth century before the rediscovery of [[Mendelian genetics]]. The theory held the controversial notion that all [[organic matter]] contains [[memory]].&lt;ref&gt;Draaisma, Douwe. (2000). ''Metaphors of Memory: A History of Ideas about the Mind''. Cambridge University Press. p. 83. {{ISBN|0-521-65024-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anastasio, Thomas J; Ehrenberger, Kristen Ann; Watson, Patrick. (2012). ''Individual and Collective Memory Consolidation: Analogous Processes on Different Levels''. MIT Press. pp. 44-45. {{ISBN|978-0-262-01704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Richard Semon.jpg|thumb|upright|The German biologist [[Richard Semon]] linked organic memory to [[heredity]].]]

German physiologist [[Ewald Hering]] first suggested the idea of organic memory in an 1870 lecture for the Imperial Academy of Science in [[Vienna]]. Hering took influence from the idea of [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]] and suggested that memories could be passed on through generations by [[germ cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley, Finger. (1994). ''Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function''. Oxford University Press. p. 338. {{ISBN|978-0-262-01704-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants of the organic memory theory were proposed by advocates of [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] evolution such as [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], [[Ernst Haeckel]], [[Eugenio Rignano]], [[Théodule-Armand Ribot]] and [[Richard Semon]].&lt;ref&gt;Otis, Laura. (1994). ''Organic Memory: History and the Body in the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries''. University of Nebraska Press. pp. 10-34. {{ISBN|0-8032-3561-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Akavia, Naamah. (2013). ''Subjectivity in Motion: Life, Art, and Movement in the Work of Hermann Rorschach''. Routledge. p. 44. {{ISBN|978-0-415-53623-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nikulin, Dmitri. (2015). ''Memory: A History''. Oxford University Press. p. 241. {{ISBN|978-0-19-979384-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents such as Semon connected the theory of organic memory to [[Heredity|hereditary]] phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L. (2001). ''Forgotten Ideas, Neglected Pioneers: Richard Semon and the Story of Memory''. Routledge. p. 108. {{ISBN|978-1-84169-052-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to historian Petteri Pietikainen:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Semon argued not only that information is encoded into memory and that there are 'memory traces' (engrams) or after-effects of stimulation that conserve the changes in the nervous system, he also contended that these changes in the brain (that is, engrams) are inherited. Semon's mneme-theory fell into disrepute largely because in a Lamarckian fashion it proposed that memory units are passed from one generation to another.&lt;ref&gt;Pietikainen, Petteri. (2007). ''Alchemists of Human Nature: Psychological Utopianism in Gross, Jung, Reich and Fromm''. Routledge. p. 100. {{ISBN|978-1-85196-923-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ideas of organic memory were popular amongst [[biologist]]s and [[psychologist]]s from 1870 to 1918. The theory later lost scientific legitimacy as it yielded no reliable data and advances in [[genetics]] made the theory untenable.&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, Alison. (2004). ''Prosthetic Memory: The Transformation of American Remembrance in the Age of Mass Culture''. Columbia University Press. p. 7. {{ISBN|978-0-231-12927-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richards, Graham.

In [[topology]], a branch of mathematics, '''Pachner moves''', named after Udo Pachner, are ways of replacing a [[triangulation (topology)|triangulation]] of a [[piecewise linear manifold]] by a different triangulation of a [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] manifold. Pachner moves are also called '''bistellar flips'''. Any two triangulations of a piecewise linear manifold are related by a finite sequence of Pachner moves.

== Definition ==
Let &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; be the &lt;math&gt;(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;-[[simplex]].   &lt;math&gt;\partial \Delta_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt; is a combinatorial ''n''-sphere with its triangulation as the boundary of the ''n+1''-simplex. 

Given a triangulated piecewise linear ''n''-manifold &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, and a co-dimension ''0'' subcomplex &lt;math&gt;C \subset N&lt;/math&gt; together with a simplicial isomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi : C \to C' \subset \partial \Delta_{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, the Pachner move on ''N'' associated to ''C'' is the triangulated manifold &lt;math&gt;(N \setminus C) \cup_\phi (\partial \Delta_{n+1} \setminus C')&lt;/math&gt;. By design, this manifold is PL-isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; but the isomorphism does not preserve the triangulation.

'''Panic''' is a sudden sensation of [[fear]], which is so strong as to dominate or prevent [[reason]] and [[logical]] thinking, replacing it with overwhelming feelings of [[anxiety]] and frantic [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]] consistent with an animalistic [[Fight-or-flight response|fight-or-flight]] reaction. Panic may occur singularly in individuals or manifest suddenly in large groups as [[mass panic]] (closely related to [[herd behavior]]).

== Etymology ==
The word derives from antiquity and is a tribute to the ancient god, [[Pan (god)|Pan]].  One of the many gods in the [[mythology]] of ancient Greece: Pan was the god of shepherds and of woods and pastures. The Greeks believed that he often wandered peacefully through the woods, playing a pipe, but when accidentally awakened from his noontime nap he could give a great shout that would cause flocks to stampede. From this aspect of Pan's nature Greek authors derived the word panikon, “sudden fear,” the ultimate source of the English word: "panic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Panic by Merriam-Webster|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/panic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects ==
[[Human evolution#Before Homo|Prehistoric humans]] used mass panic as a technique when hunting animals, especially [[ruminant]]s. [[Herd]]s reacting to unusually strong sounds or unfamiliar visual effects were directed towards [[cliff]]s, where they eventually jumped to their deaths when cornered. [[Human]]s are also vulnerable to panic and it is often considered infectious, in the sense one person's panic may easily spread to other people nearby and soon the entire group acts [[Irrationality|irrational]]ly, but people also have the ability to prevent and/or control their own and others' panic by disciplined thinking or training (such as disaster drills). [[Architect]]s and [[city planner]]s try to accommodate the [[symptom]]s of panic, such as [[herd behavior]], during [[design]] and [[planning]], often using [[simulation]]s to determine the best way to lead people to a safe exit and prevent congestion ([[stampede]]s). The most effective methods are often non-intuitive. A tall column or columns, placed in front of the door exit at a precisely calculated distance, may speed up the evacuation of a large room, as the obstacle divides the congestion well ahead of the choke point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=TWAROGOWSKA|first1=M|last2=GOATIN|first2=P|last3=DUVIGNEAU|first3=R|title=MACROSCOPIC MODELING AND SIMULATIONS OF ROOM EVACUATION|arxiv=1308.1770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leonard J. Schmidt and Brooke Warner describe panic as “that terrible, profound emotion that stretches us beyond our ability to imagine any experience more horrible” adding that “physicians like to compare painful clinical conditions on some imagined ‘Richter scale’ of vicious, mean hurt … to the psychiatrist there is no more vicious, mean hurt than an exploding and personally disintegrating panic attack.”&lt;ref&gt;Leonard J. Schmidt and Brooke Warner (eds), ''Panic: Origins, Insight, and Treatment'' (Berkeley CA: North Atlantic Books, 2002), xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

An influential theoretical treatment of panic is found in [[Neil Smelser|Neil J. Smelser]]'s ''Theory of Collective Behavior''. The science of panic management has found important practical applications in the armed forces and emergency services of the world.

Many highly publicized cases of deadly panic occurred during massive public events. The layout of [[Mecca]] was extensively redesigned by [[Saudi]] authorities in an attempt to eliminate frequent stampedes, which kill an average of 250 [[pilgrim]]s every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Patriarchy''' is a [[social system]] in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, [[moral authority]], [[social privilege]] and control of property. Some patriarchal societies are also [[patrilineal]], meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage.

Patriarchy is associated with a set of ideas, a patriarchal [[ideology]] that acts to explain and justify this dominance and attributes it to inherent natural differences between men and women. Sociologists tend to see patriarchy as a social product and not as an outcome of innate differences between the sexes and they focus attention on the way that [[gender role]]s in a society affect power differentials between men and women.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henslin"/&gt;

Historically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious, and economic organization of a range of different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Malti-Douglas |first=Fedwa |title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender |year=2007 |publisher= Macmillan |location=Detroit |isbn=0-02-865960-0}}{{Page needed |date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if not explicitly defined to be by their own constitutions and laws, most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Societies, Networks, and Transitions |volume=1 |last=Lockard |first=Craig |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |isbn=9780547047669 |location= |pages=111–114 |quote="Today, as in the past, men generally hold political, economic, and religious power in most societies." }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies|first1=Carole|last1=Pateman|title=Sexual Contract|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|year=2016|location=Singapore|isbn=978-1-4051-9694-9|doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxist]] theory, as articulated mainly by [[Friedrich Engels]], assigns the origin of patriarchy to the emergence of [[private property]], which has traditionally been controlled by men. In this view, men directed household production and sought to control women in order to ensure the passing of family property to their own (male) offspring, while women were limited to household labor and producing children.{{refn|name=Cannell &amp; Green}}{{refn|name=Gardiner}}&lt;ref name="Bryson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bryson |first=Valerie |editor1=Kramarae, Cheris |editor2=Spender, Dale |title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge, Volume 2 |date=2000 |location=New York; Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0-41-5-92088-9 |page=791 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/Routledge_International_Encyclopedia_of.html?id=QAOUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT850&amp;dq=patriarchy |chapter=Feminism: Marxist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner disputes this idea, arguing that patriarchy emerged before the development of class-based society and the concept of private property.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13323175|title=The creation of patriarchy|last=1920-2013.|first=Lerner, Gerda,|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195039963|location=New York|oclc=13323175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient history===
A prominent Greek general [[Meno (general)|Meno]], in the Platonic dialogue of the same name, sums up the prevailing sentiment in [[Classical Greece]] about the respective virtues of men and women. He says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=W.R.M.

Or take a woman's virtue: there is no difficulty in describing it as the duty of ordering the house well, looking after the property indoors, and obeying her husband. | Meno | Plato in Twelve Volumes}}

The works of [[Aristotle]] portrayed women as morally, intellectually, and physically inferior to men; saw women as the property of men; claimed that women's role in society was to reproduce and to serve men in the household; and saw male domination of women as natural and virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fishbein, Harold D.|title=Peer prejudice and discrimination: the origins of prejudice|edition= 2nd|publisher=Psychology Press|date=2002|isbn=978-0-8058-3772-8|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBwAYLFPP3sC&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dubber, Markus Dirk|title=The police power: patriarchy and the foundations of American government|publisher=Columbia University Press|date=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13207-7|pages=5–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjdbRF8PXhUC&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bar On, Bat-Ami|title=Engendering origins: critical feminist readings in Plato and Aristotle|publisher=SUNY Press|date=1994|isbn=978-0-7914-1643-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UVq3z2Kd6cC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerda Lerner]], author of ''The Creation of Patriarchy,'' states that Aristotle believed that women had colder blood than men, which made women not evolve into men, the sex that Aristotle believed to be perfect and superior. Maryanne Cline Horowitz stated that Aristotle believed that "soul contributes the form and model of creation". This implies that any imperfection that is caused in the world must be caused by a woman because one cannot acquire an imperfection from perfection (which he perceived as male). Aristotle had a hierarchical ruling structure in his theories. Lerner claims that through this patriarchal belief system, passed down generation to generation, people have been conditioned to believe that men are superior to women. These symbols are benchmarks which children learn about when they grow up, and the cycle of patriarchy continues much past the Greeks.&lt;ref name="Lerner1986"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lerner, |first=Gerda |date=1986 |title=The Creation of Patriarchy |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Chapter 10: Symbols}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egypt]] left no philosophical record, but [[Herodotus]] left a record of his shock at the contrast between the roles of Egyptian women and the women of Athens. He observed that Egyptian women attended market and were employed in [[trade]]. In ancient Egypt, middle-class women were eligible to sit on a local [[tribunal]], engage in [[real estate]] transactions, and inherit or bequeath [[property]]. Women also secured loans, and witnessed legal documents. Athenian women were denied such rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ptahhotep, trans. John A. Wilson.

During this time period in China, gender roles and patriarchy remained shaped by Confucianism.

===Modern history===
Although many 16th and 17th century theorists agreed with Aristotle's views concerning the place of women in society, none of them tried to prove political obligation on the basis of the patriarchal family until sometime after 1680. The patriarchal political theory is closely associated with Sir [[Robert Filmer]]. Sometime before 1653, Filmer completed a work entitled ''Patriarcha''. However, it was not published until after his death. In it, he defended the divine right of kings as having title inherited from [[Adam]], the first man of the human species, according to [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Gordon|first=Schochet|title=Patriarchy and Paternalism|encyclopedia=Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World|date=2004|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=068431200X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the latter half of the 18th century, clerical sentiments of patriarchy were meeting challenges from intellectual authorities – [[Diderot]]'s [[Encyclopedia]] denies inheritance of paternal authority stating, "... reason shows us that mothers have rights and authority equal to those of fathers; for the obligations imposed on children originate equally from the mother and the father, as both are equally responsible for bringing them into the world. Thus the positive laws of God that relate to the obedience of children join the father and the mother without any differentiation; both possess a kind of ascendancy and jurisdiction over their children...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopedie, Paternal Authority|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.040/--paternal-authority?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=education|publisher=Digital Library Platform &amp; Services (DLPS), University of Michigan |accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, various women began to question the commonly accepted patriarchal interpretation of Christian scripture. One of the foremost of these was [[Sarah Grimké]], who voiced skepticism about the ability of men to translate and interpret passages relating to the roles of the sexes without bias. She proposed alternative translations and interpretations of passages relating to women, and she applied historical and cultural criticism to a number of verses, arguing that their admonitions applied to specific historical situations, and were not to be viewed as universal commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durso|first=Pamela R.|title=The Power of Woman: The Life and writings of Sarah Moore Grimké|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQFTJJgK8esC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=2003|publisher=Mercer University Press|location=Macon, Ga.|isbn=978-0-86554-876-3|pages=130–138|edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] used Grimké's criticism of biblical sources to establish a basis for feminist thought. She published ''[[The Woman's Bible]]'', which proposed a feminist reading of the Old and New Testament. This tendency was enlarged by feminist theory, which denounced the patriarchal Judeo-Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Castro, Ginette|title=American Feminism: a contemporary history|publisher=NYU Press|date=1990|isbn=|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay, ''A Judicial Patriarchy: Family Law at the Turn of the Century'', Michael Grossberg coined the phrase ''judicial patriarchy'' stating that, "The judge became the buffer between the family and the state." and that, "Judicial patriarchs dominated family law because within these institutional and intraclass rivalries judges succeeded in protecting their power over the law governing the hearth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gossberg | first = Michael | chapter = A judicial patriarchy: family law at the turn of the century | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=bCHkkM1dRYgC&amp;pg=PA289 | editor-last = Grossberg | editor-first = Michael | title = Governing the hearth: law and the family in nineteenth-century America | pages = 289&amp;ndash;307 | publisher = The University of North Carolina Press | location = Chapel Hill London | date = 1985 | isbn = 9780807863367 }}

In China's [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]], laws governing morality, sexuality, and gender-relations continued to be based on Confucian teachings. Men and women were both subject to strict laws regarding sexual behavior, however men were punished infrequently in comparison to women. Additionally, women's punishment often carried strong social stigma, "rendering [women] unmarriageable," a stigma which did not follow men.&lt;ref&gt;Ruskola, Teemu. “Law, Sexual Morality, and Gender Equality in Qing and Communist China.” ''The Yale Law Journal'', vol. 103, no. 8, 1994, pp. 2531–2565.

In the modern era, the concept of Patriarchy is asserted to manifest itself in [[Institutionalisation|institutionalized]] control, rather than simply being about an individual's sexism.

==Feminist theory==
Feminist theorists have written extensively about patriarchy either as a primary cause of women's oppression, or as part of an interactive system. [[Shulamith Firestone]], a radical-libertarian feminist, defines patriarchy as a system of oppression of women. Firestone believes that patriarchy is caused by the biological inequalities between women and men, e.g. that women bear children, while men do not. Firestone writes that patriarchal ideologies support the oppression of women and gives as an example the joy of giving birth, which she labels a patriarchal myth. For Firestone, women must gain control over reproduction in order to be free from oppression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Feminist historian [[Gerda Lerner]] believes that male control over women's sexuality and reproductive functions is a fundamental cause and result of patriarchy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Alison Jaggar]] also understands patriarchy as the primary cause of women's oppression. The system of patriarchy accomplishes this by alienating women from their bodies.

Interactive systems theorists [[Iris Marion Young]] and [[Heidi Hartmann]] believe that patriarchy and capitalism interact together to oppress women. Young, Hartmann, and other [[Socialist feminism|socialist]] and [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminists]] use the terms ''patriarchal capitalism'' or ''capitalist patriarchy'' to describe the interactive relationship of capitalism and patriarchy in producing and reproducing the oppression of women.&lt;ref name="Tong"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction|last=Rosemarie|first=Tong|publisher=|others=Botts, Tina Fernandes|date=2017-07-18|isbn=9780813350707|edition= Fifth |location=New York|pages=|oclc=979993556}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Hartmann, the term ''patriarchy'' redirects the focus of oppression from the labour division to a moral and political responsibility liable directly to men as a gender. In its being both systematic and universal, therefore, the concept of patriarchy represents an adaptation of the Marxist concept of class and class struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hartmann |first1=Heidi |title=The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism |journal=Capital and Class |volume=8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Audre Lorde]], an African American feminist writer and theorist, believed that [[racism]] and patriarchy were intertwined systems of oppression.&lt;ref name="Tong" /&gt; [[Sara Ruddick]], a philosopher who wrote about "good mothers" in the context of maternal ethics, describes the dilemma facing contemporary mothers who must train their children within a patriarchal system. Does a "good mother," she asks, train her son to be competitive, individualistic, and comfortable within the hierarchies of patriarchy, knowing that he may likely be economically successful but a mean person? Or does a good mother resist patriarchal ideologies and socialize her son to be cooperative and communal but economically unsuccessful?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Gerda Lerner]], in her 1986 ''The Creation of Patriarchy'', makes a series of arguments about the origins and reproduction of patriarchy as a system of oppression of women, and concludes that patriarchy is socially constructed and seen as natural and invisible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Jaggar, Young, and Hartmann are among the feminist theorists who argue that the system of patriarchy should be completely overturned, especially the [[Heteropatriarchy|heteropatriarchal]] family, which they see as a necessary component of female oppression. The family not only serves as a representative of the greater civilization by pushing its own affiliates to change and obey, but performs as a component in the rule of the patriarchal state that rules its inhabitants with the head of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org|title=Violence against Women and Media: Advancements and Challenges of a Research and Political Agenda|last=Montiel|first=Aimée Vega|date=8 October 2014|publisher=UNESCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many feminists (especially scholars and activists) have called for culture repositioning as a method for deconstructing patriarchy. Culture repositioning relates to [[culture change]]. It involves the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chigbu|first=Uchendu Eugene|title=Repositioning culture for development: women and development in a Nigerian rural community|journal=Community, Work &amp; Family|date=2015|volume=18|issue=3|pages=334–350|doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.981506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the widespread use of the term ''patriarchy'', early feminists used ''male [[chauvinism]]'' and ''sexism'' to refer roughly to the same phenomenon.&lt;ref name="hooks, bell 2004 17–25"&gt;{{cite book|last=hooks | first = bell|chapter=Understanding patriarchy|chapterurl=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G28LTQltyVAC&amp;pg=PA17|title=The will to change: men, masculinity, and love|publisher=Washington Square Press|date=2004|pages=17–25|isbn=9780743480338|quote=Patriarchy is a political-social system that insists that males are inherently dominating, superior to everything and everyone deemed weak, especially females, and endowed with the right to dominate and rule over the weak and to maintain that dominance through various forms of psychological terrorism and violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[bell hooks]] argues that the new term identifies the ideological system itself (that men claim dominance and superiority to women) that can be believed and acted upon by either men or women, whereas the earlier terms imply only men act as oppressors of women.&lt;ref name="hooks, bell 2004 17–25" /&gt;

Sociologist Joan Acker, analyzing the concept of patriarchy and the role that it has played in the development of feminist thought, says that seeing  patriarchy as a universal, trans-historical and trans-cultural phenomenon where "women were everywhere oppressed by men in more or less the same ways […] tended toward a biological essentialism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acker |first1=John |title=The Problem with Patriarchy |journal=Sociology |date=1989 |volume=23 |issue=2 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Pollart has described attempts the use of patriarchy as circular and conflating description and explanation. She remarks the discourse on patriarchy creates a ‘theoretical impasse […] imposing a structural label on what it is supposed to explain’ and therefore impoverishes the possibility to explain gender inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pollart |first1=Anne |title=Gender and Class Revisited, or the Poverty of Patriarchy |journal=Sociology |date=1996 |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a common standard of differentiation between sexes, advocates for a patriarchal society like to focus on the influences that hormones have over biological systems.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Hormones have been declared as the "key to the sexual universe" because they are present in all animals and are the driving force in two critical developmental stages: sex-determinism in the fetus, and puberty in the teenage individual.&lt;ref name=Lewontin&gt;{{cite book | chapter = The determined patriarchy | chapterurl = https://athens.indymedia.org/media/upload/2016/09/06/Steven_Rose_Richard_Lewontin_Leon_J._Kamin-Not_In_Our_Genes__Biology_Ideology_and_Human_Nature__-Penguin_Books_Ltd_1990.pdf | last1 = Lewontin | first1 = Richard C. | last2 = Rose | first2 = Steven | last3 = Kamin | first3 = Leon J. | author-link1 = Richard Lewontin | title = Not in our genes: biology, ideology, and human nature | pages = 132&amp;ndash;163 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York | date = 1984 | isbn = 9780140226058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing a critical role in the development of the brain and behavior, testosterone and estrogen have been labeled the "male-hormone" and "female-hormone" respectively as a result of the impact they have when masculinizing or feminizing an individual.

Biologist [[Richard Lewontin]] asserts that patriarchy persists through social and political reasons, rather than purely biological causes. Opponents of [[gender feminism]], such as [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], have argued that patriarchy has its origin in biological factors.&lt;ref name=Hoff_Sommers&gt;{{cite book |author=Sommers, Christina Hoff |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers |title=Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women |date=1995 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-80156-8 |page=320|title-link=Who Stole Feminism?

This is called [[biological determinism]], which looks at humanity from a strictly biological point of view. Thus, the evolution of science in a patriarchal society's focus begins with man and woman. The male [[testosterone]] hormone is, for instance, known to greatly enhance risk taking behaviour; which can generate increased status in groups if successful (balanced with an equal increase in number of failures, with potential losses of status or death as result). The potential magnitude, frequency and longevity of the increased status from a hormonally driven risk-taking success depends on opportunities, which increases rapidly with societal complexity.

A hypothetical patriarchal culture based primarily on a hormonally-driven increased rate of male successes, thus require a certain critical level of societal evolution{{clarify|date=May 2016}} before it could evolve. Other proponents of this theory posit that because of a woman's biology, she is more fit to perform roles such as anonymous child-rearing at home, rather than high-profile decision-making roles, such as leaders in battles. Through this simple basis, "the existence of a sexual division of labor in primitive societies is a starting point as much for purely social accounts of the origins of patriarchy as for biological."&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|157}} Hence, the rise of patriarchy is recognized through this apparent "sexual division".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;

Although patriarchy exists within the scientific atmosphere, "the periods over which women would have been at a physiological disadvantage in participation in hunting through being at a late stage of pregnancy or early stage of child-rearing would have been short",&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|157}} during the time of the nomads, patriarchy still grew with power. Lewontin and others argue that such biological determinism unjustly limits women. In his study, he states women behave a certain way not because they are biologically inclined to, but rather because they are judged by "how well they conform to the stereotypical local image of femininity".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|137}}

Feminists believe that people have gendered biases, which are perpetuated and enforced across generations by those who benefit from them.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; For instance, it has historically been claimed that women cannot make rational decisions during their menstrual periods. This claim cloaks the fact that men also have periods of time where they can be aggressive and irrational; furthermore, unrelated effects of aging and similar medical problems are often blamed on menopause, amplifying its reputation.&lt;ref name=Coney&gt;{{cite book | last = Coney | first = Sandra | title = The menopause industry: how the medical establishment exploits women | publisher = Hunter House | location = Alameda, California | date = 1994 | isbn = 9780897931618 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These biological traits and others specific to women, such as their ability to get pregnant, are often used against them as an attribute of weakness.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coney" /&gt;

A growing body of research has found key points of the biological argument to be groundless. For example, it was asserted for over a century that women were not as intellectually competent as men because they have slightly smaller brains on average.&lt;ref name="Gould1980"&gt;{{cite book |last= Gould | first= Stephen |title= The panda's thumb: more reflections in natural history |pages= 152–159 |publisher= Norton |location = New York |date= 1992 |origyear= 1980 |isbn= 978-0393340839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no substantiated significant difference in average intelligence has been found between the sexes. On the other hand, men have a greater variability in intelligence, and except in tests of reading comprehension, in tests of perceptual speed and associative memory, males typically outnumber females substantially among high-scoring individuals.&lt;ref name="Hedges and Nowell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedges | first1 = Larry V. | last2 = Nowell | first2 = Amy | title = Sex differences in mental test scores, variability, and numbers of high-scoring individuals | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 269 | issue = 5220 | pages = 41&amp;ndash;45 | doi = 10.1126/science.7604277 | pmid = 7604277 | jstor = 2889145 | date = 7 July 1995 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, no discrepancy in intelligence is assumed between men of different heights, even though on average taller men have been found to have slightly larger brains.&lt;ref name="Gould1980"/&gt; Feminists assert that although women may excel in certain areas and men in others, women are just as competent as men.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; Therefore, through the growing power of the patriarchal system, a gender bias is created in the work force, leading to a situation in which "men are more likely to be cabinet ministers or parliamentarians, business executives or tycoons, Nobel Prize-winning scientists or fellows of academies, doctors or airline pilots. [As for] [w]omen [they] are more likely to be secretaries, laboratory technicians, office cleaners, nurses, airline stewardesses, primary school teachers, or social workers."&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|132}}

Within the structure of a patriarchal society, patriarchal biases and values are more likely to be promoted in the educational system. Particularly in mathematical and scientific fields, boys are presumed to have more keen spatial abilities than girls, whereas girls are supposed to assume better linguistic skills. These stereotypical manifestations within educational institutions contract with the notions of differently gendered brains and a "relationship between intelligence and brain size".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|143}} However, there is "no correlation between skull capacity and hence brain weight and 'intellectual power'",&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|143}} yet there is still a constant struggle of gender bias in science.

Sociologist [[Sylvia Walby]] has composed six overlapping structures that define patriarchy and that take different forms in different cultures and different times:
# The state: women are unlikely to have formal power and representation
# The household: women are more likely to do the housework and raise the children
# Violence: women are more prone to being abused
# Paid work: women are likely to be paid less
# Sexuality: women's sexuality is more likely to be treated negatively
# Culture: representation of women in media, and popular culture is "within a patriarchal gaze".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Walby | first = Sylvia | title = Theorizing patriarchy |page=20 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Oxford, UK Cambridge, Massachusetts | date = 1990 | isbn = 9780631147688 }}

Some [[sociobiologist]]s, such as [[Steven Goldberg]], argue that social behavior is primarily determined by [[genetics]], and thus that patriarchy arises more as a result of inherent biology than social conditioning. Goldberg also contends that patriarchy is a universal feature of human culture. In 1973, Goldberg wrote, "The ethnographic studies of every society that has ever been observed explicitly state that these feelings were present, there is literally no variation at all."&lt;ref name="Goldberg, Steven"&gt;{{cite book | last = Goldberg | first = Steven | title = The inevitability of patriarchy | publisher = W. Morrow | location = New York | date = 1974 | isbn = 9780688051754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg has critics among anthropologists. Concerning Goldberg's claims about the "feelings of both men and women", [[Eleanor Leacock]] countered in 1974 that the data on women's attitudes are "sparse and contradictory", and that the data on male attitudes about male–female relations are "ambiguous". Also, the effects of colonialism on the cultures represented in the studies were not considered.&lt;ref name="Leacock, Eleanor"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Leacock | first = Eleanor | author-link = Eleanor Leacock | title = Reviewed Work: ''The Inevitability of Patriarchy'' by Steven Goldberg | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 363&amp;ndash;365 | doi = 10.1525/aa.1974.76.2.02a00280 | jstor = 674209 | date = June 1974 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early theory in [[evolutionary psychology]] offered an explanation for the origin of patriarchy which starts with the view that females almost always invest more energy into producing offspring than males, and therefore in most [[species]] females are a [[limiting factor]] over which males will compete. This is sometimes referred to as [[Bateman's principle]]. It suggests females place the most important preference on males who control more resources that can help her and her offspring, which in turn causes an [[evolutionary pressure]] on males to be competitive with each other in order to gain resources and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = David Michael | last2 = Schmitt | first2 = David P. | title = Evolutionary psychology and feminism | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 64 | issue = 9&amp;ndash;10 | pages = 768&amp;ndash;787 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-011-9987-3 | date = May 2011 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that patriarchy is natural has, however, come under attack from many sociologists, explaining that patriarchy evolved due to historical, rather than biological, conditions. In technologically simple societies, men's greater physical strength and women's common experience of pregnancy combined together to sustain patriarchy.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; Gradually, technological advances, especially industrial machinery, diminished the primacy of physical strength in everyday life. Similarly, contraception has given women control over their reproductive cycle.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

There is considerable variation in the role that gender plays in human societies. The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' states, "The consensus among modern anthropologists and sociologists is that while many cultures bestow power preferentially on one sex or the other, matriarchal societies in this original, evolutionary sense have never existed."&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Matriarchy|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date=2018|accessdate=June 23, 2018|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/matriarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The masculinities scholar [[David Buchbinder]] suggests that [[Roland Barthes]]' description of the term ''[[ex-nomination]]'' (i.e. patriarchy as the 'norm' or common sense) is relevant, "[f]or as long as patriarchy remained tacit as a key principle of experiencing gender difference and hence a dominant discourse in the organization of society, it was difficult to contest its power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Buchbinder | first = David | author-link = David Buchbinder | chapter = Troubling patriarchy | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TmfUzE4WnW8C&amp;pg=PA106 | title = Studying men and masculinities | pages = 106–107 | publisher = Routledge | location = Abingdon, Oxon, UK; New York, N.Y. | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780415578295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Smuts argues that patriarchy evolved in humans through conflict between the reproductive interests of males and the reproductive interests of females. She lists six ways that it emerged:
# a reduction in female allies
# elaboration of male-male alliances
# increased male control over resources
# increased hierarchy formation among men
# female strategies that reinforce male control over females
# the evolution of language and its power to create ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Smuts, Barbara. "The Evolutionary Origins of Patriarchy."  Human Nature, Vol. 6, No. 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguing from this standpoint, radical feminist [[Shulamith Firestone]] wrote in her 1970 ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marx was on to something more profound than he knew when he observed that the family contained within itself in embryo all the antagonisms that later develop on a wide scale within the society and the state. For unless revolution uproots the basic social organisation, the biological family – the vinculum through which the psychology of power can always be smuggled – the tapeworm of exploitation will never be annihilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Firestone |first=Shulamith | author-link = Shulamith Firestone | title = The dialectic of sex: the case for feminist revolution | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Zxy2AAAAIAAJ | publisher = Quill | location = New York | date = 1970 | isbn = 9780688123598 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''periodic table of topological invariants''' is an application of [[topology]] to [[physics]]. It indicates the group of topological invariant for [[topological insulator]]s and [[superconductor]]s in each dimension and in each discrete symmetry class.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.88.035005 | last = Chiu| first = C. |author2=J.

==Discrete symmetry classes==

There are ten discrete symmetry classes of topological insulators and superconductors, corresponding to the ten Altland–Zirnbauer classes of [[random matrix|random matrices]]. They are defined by three symmetries of the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\hat{H} = \sum_{i,j} H_{ij} c_i^{\dagger} c_j&lt;/math&gt;, (where &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c_i^{\dagger}&lt;/math&gt;, are the annihilation and creation operators of mode &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, in some arbitrary spatial basis) : time reversal symmetry, particle hole (or charge conjugation) symmetry, and chiral (or sublattice) symmetry.

Chiral symmetry is a unitary operator &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, that acts on &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;, as a unitary rotation (&lt;math&gt;S c_i S^{-1} = (U_S)_{ij} c_j&lt;/math&gt;,) and satisfies &lt;math&gt;S^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt;,. A Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; possesses chiral symmetry when &lt;math&gt; S\hat{H}S^{-1}=-\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt;, for some choice of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; (on the level of first-quantised Hamiltonians, this means &lt;math&gt;U_S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; are anticommuting matrices).

Time reversal is an antiunitary operator &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, that acts on &lt;math&gt;\alpha c_i&lt;/math&gt;, (where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, is an arbitrary complex coefficient, and &lt;math&gt;^*&lt;/math&gt;, denotes complex conjugation) as &lt;math&gt;T \alpha c_i T^{-1} = \alpha^* {(U_T)}_{ij}c_j&lt;/math&gt;,. It can be written as &lt;math&gt;T = U_T \mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; is the complex conjugation operator and &lt;math&gt;U_T&lt;/math&gt; is a unitary matrix. Either &lt;math&gt;T^2 = 1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;T^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt;. A Hamiltonian with time reversal symmetry satisfies &lt;math&gt;T\hat{H}T^{-1} = \hat{H}&lt;/math&gt;, or on the level of first-quantised matrices, &lt;math&gt;U_T H^* U_T^{-1} = H&lt;/math&gt;, for some choice of &lt;math&gt;U_T&lt;/math&gt;.

Charge conjugation &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is also an antiunitary operator which acts on &lt;math&gt;\alpha c_i&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;C \alpha c_i C^{-1}  = \alpha^* (U_C^{\dagger})_{ji}c_j&lt;/math&gt;, and can be written as &lt;math&gt;C = U_C \mathcal{K}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;U_C&lt;/math&gt; is unitary. Again either &lt;math&gt;C^2 =1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;C^2 = -1&lt;/math&gt; depending on what &lt;math&gt;U_C&lt;/math&gt; is. A Hamiltonian with particle hole symmetry satisfies &lt;math&gt;C\hat{H}C^{-1} = - \hat{H}&lt;/math&gt;, or on the level of first-quantised Hamiltonian matrices, &lt;math&gt;U_C H^* U_C^{-1} = - H&lt;/math&gt;, for some choice of &lt;math&gt;U_C&lt;/math&gt;.

In the Bloch Hamiltonian formalism for periodic crystals, where the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H(k)&lt;/math&gt; acts on modes of crystal momentum &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the chiral symmetry, TRS, and PHS conditions become &lt;math&gt;U_S H(k) U_S^{-1} = -H(k)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;U_T H(k)^* U_T^{-1} = H(-k)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;U_C H(k)^* U_C^{-1} = -H(-k)&lt;/math&gt;.

It is evident that if two of these three symmetries are present, then the third is also present, due to the relation &lt;math&gt;S= TC&lt;/math&gt;.

The aforementioned discrete symmetries label 10 distinct discrete symmetry classes, which coincide with the Altland–Zirnbauer classes of random matrices.

==Equivalence classes of Hamiltonians==

A bulk Hamiltonian in a particular symmetry group is restricted to be a Hermitian matrix with no zero-energy eigenvalues (i.e. so that the spectrum is "gapped" and the system is a bulk insulator) satisfying the symmetry constraints of the group. In the case of &lt;math&gt;d&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, this Hamiltonian is a continuous  function &lt;math&gt;H(k)&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; parameters in the Bloch momentum vector &lt;math&gt; \vec{k}&lt;/math&gt; in the  [[Brillouin zone]]; then the symmetry constraints must hold for all &lt;math&gt;\vec{k}&lt;/math&gt;.

Given two Hamiltonians &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt;, it may be possible to continuously deform &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; while maintaining the symmetry constraint and gap (that is, there exists continuous function &lt;math&gt;H(t, \vec{k})&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;0 \le t \le 1&lt;/math&gt; the Hamiltonian has no zero eigenvalue and symmetry condition is maintained, and &lt;math&gt;H(0, \vec{k} ) = H_1( \vec{k})&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H(1, \vec{k} ) = H_2( \vec{k})&lt;/math&gt;). Then we say that &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent.

However, it may also turn out that there is no such continuous deformation. in this case, physically if two materials with bulk Hamiltonians &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_2&lt;/math&gt; respectively neighbour each other with an edge between them, when one continuously moves across the edge one must encounter a zero eigenvalue (as there is no continuous transformation that avoids this). This may manifest as a gapless zero energy edge mode or an electric current that only flows along the edge.

An interesting question is to ask, given a symmetry class and a dimension of the Brillouin zone, what are all the equivalence classes of Hamiltonians. Each equivalence class can be labeled by a topological invariant; two Hamiltonians whose topological invariant are different cannot be deformed into each other and belong to different equivalence classes.

== Classifying spaces of Hamiltonians ==

For each of the symmetry classes, the question can be simplified by deforming the Hamiltonian into a "projective" Hamiltonian, and considering the symmetric space in which such Hamiltonians live. These classifying spaces are shown for each symmetry class:&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexei Kitaev|Kitaev, Alexei]].

|&lt;math&gt;0
&lt;/math&gt;

For example, a (real symmetric) Hamiltonian in symmetry class AI can have its &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; positive eigenvalues deformed to +1 and its &lt;math&gt;N-n&lt;/math&gt; negative eigenvalues deformed to -1; the resulting such matrices are described by the union of real [[Grassmannians]] &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_{n=0}^\infty Gr(n, N) = \bigcup_{n=0}^\infty O(N)/O(n)\times O(N-n)&lt;/math&gt;

== Classification of invariants ==

The strong topological invariants of a many-band system in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions can be labeled by the elements of the &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-th homotopy group of the symmetric space. These groups are displayed in this table, called the periodic table of topological insulators:

There may also exist weak topological invariants (associated to the fact that the suspension of the Brillouin zone is in fact equivalent to a &lt;math&gt;d+1&lt;/math&gt; sphere wedged with lower-dimensional spheres), which are not included in this table. Furthermore, the table assumes the limit of an infinite number of bands, i.e. involves &lt;math&gt;N \times N&lt;/math&gt; Hamiltonians for &lt;math&gt;N \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;.

The table also is [[Bott periodicity theorem|periodic]] in the sense that the group of invariants in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions is the same as the group of invariants in &lt;math&gt;d+8&lt;/math&gt; dimensions. In the case of no antiunitary symmetries, the invariant groups are periodic in dimension by 2.

For nontrivial symmetry classes, the actual invariant can be defined by one of the following integrals over all or part of the Brillouin zone: the [[Berry connection and curvature|Chern number]], the Wess Zumino winding number, the Chern–Simons invariant, the Fu–Kane invariant.

==Dimensional reduction and Bott Clock==

The periodic table also displays a peculiar property: the invariant groups in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions are identical to those in &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; dimensions but in a different symmetry class. Among the complex symmetry classes, the invariant group for A in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions is the same as that for AIII in &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; dimensions, and vice versa. One can also imagine arranging each of the eight real symmetry classes on the Cartesian plane such that the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; coordinate is &lt;math&gt;T^2&lt;/math&gt; if time reversal symmetry is present and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; if it is absent, and the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; coordinate is &lt;math&gt;C^2&lt;/math&gt; if particle hole symmetry is present and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; if it is absent. Then the invariant group in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; dimensions for a certain real symmetry class is the same as the invariant group in &lt;math&gt;d-1&lt;/math&gt; dimensions for the symmetry class directly one space clockwise. This phenomenon was termed the "Bott Clock" by [[Alexei Kitaev|Kitaev]], in reference to the [[Bott periodicity theorem]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://topocondmat.org/w8_general/classification.html|title=General approach to topological classification|last=Ryu|first=Shinsei|date=|work=Topology in Condensed Matter|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bott Clock can be understood by considering the problem of [[Clifford algebra]] extensions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Near an interface between two inequivalent bulk materials, the Hamiltonian approaches a gap closing. To lowest order expansion in momentum slightly away from the gap closing, the Hamiltonian takes the form of a Dirac Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;H_\text{Dirac}(\vec{k}) = \sum_{j=1}^d \Gamma_j v_j k_j + m\Gamma_0 &lt;/math&gt;. Here, &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2, \ldots, \Gamma_d&lt;/math&gt; are a representation of the Clifford Algebra &lt;math&gt;\lbrace \Gamma_i , \Gamma_j \rbrace = 2\delta_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;m\Gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; is an added "mass term" that and anticommutes with the rest of the Hamiltonian and vanishes at the interface (thus giving the interface a gapless edge mode at &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt;). The &lt;math&gt;m\Gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; term for the Hamiltonian on one side of the interface cannot be continuously deformed into the &lt;math&gt;m\Gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; term for the Hamiltonian on the other side of the interface. Thus (letting &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary positive scalar) the problem of classifying topological invariants reduces to the problem of classifying all possible inequivalent choices of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma_0&lt;/math&gt; to extend the Clifford algebra to one higher dimension, while maintaining the symmetry constraints.

[[wiktionary:post-truth|Post-truth]] differs from traditional contesting and falsifying of facts by relegating facts and expert opinions to be of secondary importance relative to appeal to emotion. While this has been described as a contemporary problem, some observers have described it as a long-standing part of political life that was less notable before the advent of the [[Internet]] and related social changes.

{{As of|2018}} political commentators have identified post-truth politics as ascendant in many nations, notably the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Russia, and Brazil, among others. As with other areas of debate, this is being driven by a combination of the [[24-hour news cycle]], [[false balance]] in news reporting, and the increasing ubiquity of [[social media]].&lt;ref name=economist-10-9-16&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21706498-dishonesty-politics-nothing-new-manner-which-some-politicians-now-lie-and |title="The post-truth world: Yes, I’d lie to you," '&amp;#39;The Economist'&amp;#39; Sept 10, 2016 |publisher=Economist.com |date=2016-09-10 |accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Age-abbott"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/tony-abbotts-carbon-tax-outrage-signals-nadir-of-posttruth-politics-20140717-ztz2b.html|title=Tony Abbott's carbon tax outrage signals nadir of post-truth politics |date=14 July 2014|accessdate=11 July 2016|author=John Connor|newspaper=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Age-futile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI-brexit-trump"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/to-name-and-address/everything-but-the-truth-what-we-share-with-the-brexit-campaign-and-trump/|title=Life in post-truth times: What we share with the Brexit campaign and Trump|date=30 June 2016|author=Amulya Gopalakrishnan|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NSci-revolut"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23030763-000-free-speech-has-become-sound-bites-with-revolutionary-results/|title=Free speech has met social media, with revolutionary results|date=1 June 2016|newspaper=New Scientist|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, ''post-truth'' was chosen as the [[Oxford word of the year|Oxford Dictionaries' Word of the Year]],&lt;ref name="wordofyear"/&gt; due to its prevalence in the context of that year's [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|Brexit referendum]] and media coverage of the [[United States presidential election, 2016|U.S. presidential election]].&lt;ref name="Freedland-nojoke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo-era"/&gt;

==History==
According to [[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]], the term ''post-truth'' was first used in a 1992 essay by the late Serbian-American playwright [[Steve Tesich]] in ''[[The Nation]]''. Tesich writes that following the shameful truth of [[Watergate]], more assuaging coverage of the [[Iran–Contra scandal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB567-Iran-Contra-Reagan-Oliver-North-and-Post-Truth-30-years-later/ |title=The Iran-Contra Affair 30 Years Later: A Milestone in Post-Truth Politics |work=National Security Archive|date=25 November 2016|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] demonstrate that "we, as a free people, have freely decided that we want to live in some post-truth world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/15/post-truth-named-word-of-the-year-by-oxford-dictionaries| title= 'Post-truth' named word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries| first=Alison | last=Flood | date = 15 November 2016 | accessdate = 20 November 2016|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kreitner |first=Richard |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/post-truth-and-its-consequences-what-a-25-year-old-essay-tells-us-about-the-current-moment/ |title=Post-Truth and Its Consequences: What a 25-Year-Old Essay Tells Us About the Current Moment |date=30 November 2016 |work=The Nation |accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[Ralph Keyes (author)|Ralph Keyes]] used the term "post-truth era" in his book by that title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Keyes|first1=Ralph|title=The Post-Truth Era: Dishonesty and Deception in Contemporary Life|date=2004|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press|St. Martin's]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year American journalist [[Eric Alterman]] spoke of a "post-truth political environment" and coined the term "the post-truth presidency" in his analysis of the misleading statements made by the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] after 9/11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alterman|first1=Eric|title=When Presidents Lie: A History of Official Deception and Its Consequences|date=2004|publisher=[[Viking Press|Viking]]|location=New York|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2004 book ''Post-democracy'', Colin Crouch used the phrase "post-democracy" to mean a model of politics where "elections certainly exist and can change governments," but "public electoral debate is a tightly controlled spectacle, managed by rival teams of professionals expert in the techniques of persuasion, and considering a small range of issues selected by those teams." Crouch directly attributes the "advertising industry model" of political communication to the crisis of trust and accusations of dishonesty that a few years later others have associated with post-truth politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crouch|first1=Colin|title=Post-democracy|date=2004|publisher=[[Polity (publisher)|Polity]]|location=Cambridge, UK|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "post-truth politics" was coined by the blogger David Roberts in a blog post for ''[[Grist (magazine)|Grist]]'' on 1 April 2010, where it was defined as "a political culture in which politics (public opinion and media [[narrative]]s) have become almost entirely disconnected from policy (the substance of legislation)".&lt;ref name="HuffCoinage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/tom-jeffery/britain-needs-more-democr_b_10699898.html|title=Britain Needs More Democracy After the EU Referendum, Not Less|author=Tom Jeffery|date=26 June 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|website=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coining"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://grist.org/article/2010-03-30-post-truth-politics/|title=Post-Truth Politics|date=1 April 2010|website=Grist|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post truth was used by philosopher  [[Joseph Heath]] to describe the [[2014 Ontario election]]. The term became widespread during the campaigns for the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]] in the United States and the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 "Brexit" referendum on membership in the European Union]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Freedland-nojoke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo-era"/&gt; [[OxfordDictionaries.com|Oxford Dictionaries]] declared that its international word of the year in 2016 is "post-truth", citing a 2,000% increase in usage compared to 2015.&lt;ref name="wordofyear"&gt;{{cite web |last=Flood |first=Alison |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/15/post-truth-named-word-of-the-year-by-oxford-dictionaries |title='Post-truth' named word of the year by Oxford Dictionaries |work=The Guardian |date=15 November 2016 |accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennifer Hochschild, H.L. Jayne Professor of Government at [[Harvard University]], has described the rise of post-truth as a return to 18th and 19th century political and media practices in the United States, following a period in the 20th century where the media was relatively balanced and rhetoric was toned down.&lt;ref name="Harvard-politics"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/07/politics-in-a-post-truth-age/|title=Politics in a 'post-truth' age|newspaper=[[Harvard Gazette]]|date=14 July 2016|accessdate=6 August 2016|author= Christina Pazzanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Not so in Britain and elsewhere necessarily; for example, in 1957 scientist [[Kathleen Lonsdale]] remarked that "for many people truthfulness in politics has now become a mockery.... Anyone who listens to the radio in a mixed company of thinking people knows how deep-seated is this cynicism." &lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Lonsdale, ''Is Peace Possible?'' by Penguin Books, 1957, p 11&lt;/ref&gt;) 

The [[pamphlet wars]] that arose with the growth of printing and literacy beginning in the 1600s have been described as an early form of post-truth politics. Slanderous and vitriolic pamphlets were cheaply printed and widely disseminated, and the dissent that they fomented contributed to starting wars and revolutions such as the [[English Civil War]] and the [[American War of Independence]].&lt;ref name="NSci-revolut"/&gt;

[[Michael Deacon (journalist)|Michael Deacon]], [[parliamentary sketch writing|parliamentary sketchwriter]] for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', summarised the core message of post-truth politics as "Facts are negative. Facts are pessimistic. Facts are unpatriotic."  He added that post-truth politics can also include a claimed rejection of [[Polarization (politics)|partisanship]] and [[negative campaigning]].&lt;ref name="Deacon"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/07/09/in-a-world-of-post-truth-politics-andrea-leadsom-will-make-the-p/|title=In a world of post-truth politics, Andrea Leadsom will make the perfect PM |author=Michael Deacon|date=9 July 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, campaigners can push a [[utopia]]n "positive campaign" to which rebuttals can be dismissed as [[Smear campaign|smears]] and [[scaremongering]] and opposition as partisan.&lt;ref name="Coining"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt;

D. A. M. Goldman, and WASHINGTON—Edgar M. Welch. "In Washington pizzeria attack, fake news brought real guns." ''The New York Times'' 5 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to simply telling untruths, writers such as Jack Holmes of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' describe the process as something different, with Holmes putting it as: "So, if you don't know what's true, you can say whatever you want and it's not a lie".&lt;ref name="Holmes"/&gt;

In 2015 media and Politics scholar Jayson Harsin coined the term "regime of post-truth" which encompasses many aspects of post-truth politics. He argues that a convergent set of developments have created the conditions of post-truth society: the political communication informed by cognitive science, which aims at managing perception and belief of segmented populations through techniques like [[microtargeting]] which includes the strategic use of [[Rumor#Political communication strategy|rumors]] and falsehoods; the fragmentation of modern, more centralized mass news media gatekeepers, which have largely repeated one another's scoops and their reports; the attention economy marked by information overload and acceleration, user-generated content and fewer society-wide common trusted authorities to distinguish between truth and lies, accurate and inaccurate; the algorithms which govern what appears in social media and search engine rankings, based on what users want (per algorithm) and not on what is factual; and news media which have been marred by scandals of plagiarism, hoaxes, propaganda, and changing news values. These developments have occurred on the background of economic crises, downsizing and favoring trends toward more traditional [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] stories and [[Tabloid journalism|styles of reporting]], known as tabloidization&lt;ref&gt;Frank Esser [http://ejc.sagepub.com/content/14/3/291.short?rss=1&amp;ssource=mfc `Tabloidization' of News. A Comparative Analysis of Anglo-American and German Press Journalism] European Journal of Communication Vol 14, Issue 3, 1999 September 1, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[infotainment]].  

While some of these phenomena (such as a more tabloidesque press) may suggest a return to the past, the effect of the convergences is a socio-political phenomenon which exceeds earlier forms of journalism in deliberate distortion and struggle. Fact-checking and rumor-busting sites abound, but they are unable to reunite a fragmented set of audiences (attention-wise) and their respective trustful-/distrustfulness.  Harsin has called it a "regime of post-truth" instead of merely post-truth politics, professional pan-partisan political communication manipulates the communication competitively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=24 February 2015|title=Regimes of Posttruth, Postpolitics, and Attention Economies|journal=Communication, Culture &amp; Critique|volume=8|issue=2|pages=327–333|last1=Harsin|first1=Jayson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Major news outlets ===
Several trends in the media landscape have been blamed for the perceived rise of post-truth politics. One contributing factor has been the proliferation of state-funded news agencies like [[CCTV News]] and [[RT (TV network)|RT]], and [[Voice of America]] in the USA which allow states to influence [[Western world|Western]] audiences. According to [[Peter Pomerantsev]], a British-Russian journalist who worked for [[TNT (Russian TV channel)|TNT]] in Moscow, one of their prime objectives has been to de-legitimize Western institutions, including the structures of government, democracy, and human rights.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} 
As of 2016, trust in the mainstream media in the US had reached historical lows.&lt;ref name="WaPo-era"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the post-truth political era might be around for a while|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/06/16/why-the-post-truth-political-era-might-be-around-for-a-while/|author=[[Daniel W. Drezner]]|date=16 June 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It has been suggested that under these conditions, [[Fact checker|fact checking]] by news outlets struggles to gain traction among the wider public&lt;ref name="WaPo-era" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delivering trust: Impartiality and objectivity in the digital age|date=January 2012|author=Richard Sambrook|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/33772/1/Delivering_Trust_Impartiality_and_Objectivity_in_a_Digital_Age.pdf|website=Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism|publisher=University of Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that politicians resort to increasingly drastic messaging.&lt;ref name="Age-futile"&gt;{{cite news|title=Facts are futile in an era of post-truth politics|url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/facts-are-futile-in-an-era-of-posttruth-politics-20140227-33m70.html|author=Gay Alcorn|newspaper=The Age|date=27 February 2014|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many news outlets desire to appear to be, or have a policy of being, [[impartiality|impartial]]. Many writers have noted that in some cases, this leads to [[false balance]], the practice of giving equal emphasis to unsupported or discredited claims without challenging their factual basis.&lt;ref&gt;
*Robert S. Eshelman, [http://archives.cjr.org/essay/the_danger_of_fair_and_balance.php The danger of fair and balanced], ''Columbia Journalism Review'' (May 1, 2014).
*Peter Preston, [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/09/post-truth-politics-us-broadcasting Broadcast news is losing its balance in the post-truth era], ''The Guardian'' (September 9, 2012).
*[[Margaret Sullivan (journalist)|Margaret Sullivan]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/16/public-editor/16pubed.html He Said, She Said, and the Truth], ''New York Times'' (September 15, 2012): "Simply put, false balance is the journalistic practice of giving equal weight to both sides of a story, regardless of an established truth on one side."
*[[Paul Krugman]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/opinion/krugman-the-post-truth-campaign.html The Post-Truth Campaign], ''New York Times'' (December 23, 2011): "[I]f past experience is any guide, most of the news media will feel as though their reporting must be 'balanced,' which means that every time they point out that a Republican lied they have to match it with a comparable accusation against a Democrat — even if what the Democrat said was actually true or, at worst, a minor misstatement."
*[[Katrina vanden Heuvel]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/katrina-vanden-heuvel-the-distorting-reality-of-false-balance-in-the-media/2014/07/14/6def5706-0b81-11e4-b8e5-d0de80767fc2_story.html The distorting reality of 'false balance' in the media], ''Washington Post'': "False equivalence in the media — giving equal weight to unsupported or even discredited claims for the sake of appearing impartial — is not unusual. But a major media organization taking meaningful steps to do something about it is."&lt;/ref&gt; The 24-hour news cycle also means that news channels repeatedly draw on the same public figures, which benefits PR-savvy politicians and means that presentation and personality can have a larger impact on the audience than facts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Post-Truth Era: Dishonesty and Deception in Contemporary Life|pages=127–128|year=2004|author=Ralph Keyes|isbn=9781429976220}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the process of claim and counter-claim can provide grist for days of news coverage at the expense of deeper analysis of the case.&lt;ref name="TOI-brexit-trump"/&gt;

=== Social media and the Internet ===
[[Social media]] adds an additional dimension, as user networks can become [[Echo chamber (media)|echo chambers]] possibly emphasised by the [[filter bubble]] where one political viewpoint dominates and scrutiny of claims fails,&lt;ref name="TOI-brexit-trump" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSci-revolut" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FT-trust"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/24035fc2-3e45-11e6-9f2c-36b487ebd80a.html|title=Why we no longer trust the experts|date=1 July 2016|author=Gillian Tett|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing a parallel [[media ecosystem]] of websites, publishers and news channels to develop, which can repeat post-truth claims without rebuttal.&lt;ref name="Humanist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehumanist.com/magazine/january-february-2016/church-state/humanists-rise-post-truth-america|title=Humanists and the Rise of "Post-Truth America"|date=22 December 2015|author=Rob Boston|accessdate=6 August 2016|newspaper=The Humanist}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this environment, post-truth campaigns can ignore fact checks or dismiss them as being motivated by bias.&lt;ref name="Indy" /&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' editor-in-chief [[Katherine Viner]] laid some of the blame on the rise of [[clickbait]], articles of dubious factual content with a misleading headline and which are designed to be widely shared, saying that "chasing down cheap clicks at the expense of accuracy and veracity" undermines the value of journalism and truth.&lt;ref name="Viner"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/12/how-technology-disrupted-the-truth| title=How technology disrupted the truth| date=12 July 2016|accessdate=12 July 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|author=Katherine Viner}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, David Mikkelson, co-founder of the [[fact checking]] and [[debunking]] site ''[[Snopes.com]]'', described the introduction of social media and [[fake news sites]] as a turning point, saying "I’m not sure I’d call it a post-truth age but … there’s been an opening of the sluice-gate and everything is pouring through. The bilge keeps coming faster than you can pump."&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/aug/01/snopes-com-internet-fact-checker-post-truth-david-mikkelson| title=Can mythbusters like Snopes.com keep up in a post-truth era?| date=1 August 2016|author=Rory Carroll|accessdate=23 October 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital culture allows anybody with a computer and access to the internet to post their opinions online and mark them as fact which may become legitimized through echo-chambers and other users validating one another. Content may be judged based on how many views a post gets, creating an atmosphere that appeals to emotion, audience biases, or headline appeal instead of researched fact. Content which gets more views is continually filtered around different internet circles, regardless of its legitimacy. Some also argue that the abundance of fact available at any time on the internet leads to an attitude focused on knowing basic claims to information instead of an underlying truth or formulating carefully thought-out opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://opentranscripts.org/transcript/post-truth-politics/|title=Is Digital Culture Responsible for Post-Truth Politics? - Eliane Glaser {{!}} Open Transcripts|work=Open Transcripts|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The internet allows people to choose where they get their information, allowing them to reinforce their own opinions.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/24/opinion/campaign-stops/the-age-of-post-truth-politics.html|title=The Age of Post-Truth Politics|last=Davies|first=William|date=2016-08-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-03|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polarized political culture ===
The rise of post-truth politics coincides with polarized political beliefs. A [[Pew Research Center]] study of American adults found that "those with the most consistent ideological views on the left and right have information streams that are distinct from those of individuals with more mixed political views—and very distinct from each other".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amy Mitchell|first1=Amy|last2=Kiley|first2=Jocelyn|last3=Eva Matsa|first3=Katerina|last4=Gottfied|first4=Jeffrey|title=Political Polarization &amp; Media Habits|url=http://www.journalism.org/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data is becoming increasingly accessible as new technologies are introduced to the everyday lives of citizens. An obsession for data and statistics also filters into the political scene, and political debates and speeches become filled with snippets of information that may be misconstrued, false, or not contain the whole picture. Sensationalized television news emphasizes grand statements and further publicizes politicians. This shaping from the media influences how the public views political issues and candidates.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Dissenting views ==

In an editorial, ''[[New Scientist]]'' suggested "a cynic might wonder if politicians are actually any more dishonest than they used to be", and hypothesized that "fibs once whispered into select ears are now overheard by everyone".&lt;ref name="NSci-revolut"/&gt; Similarly, Viner suggested that while social media has helped some untruths to spread, it has also restrained others; as an example, she said ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''{{'}}s false "[[Hillsborough disaster#The Sun|The Truth]]" story following the [[Hillsborough disaster]], and the associated police cover-up, would be hard to imagine in the social media age.&lt;ref name="Viner"/&gt; The journalist George Gillett has suggested that the term "post-truth" mistakenly conflates empirical and ethical judgements, writing that the supposedly "post-truth" movement is in fact a rebellion against "expert economic opinion becoming a surrogate for values-based political judgements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgegillett.com/2017/04/20/the-myth-of-post-truth-politics/|title=The myth of post-truth politics|date=20 April 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toby Young]], writing for ''[[The Spectator]]'', called the term a "cliché" used selectively primarily by [[left-wing]] commentators to attack what are actually universal [[Confirmation bias|ideological bias]]es, contending that "[w]e are all post-truthers and probably always have been".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/07/the-truth-about-post-truth-politics/|title=The truth about 'post-truth politics'|date=16 July 2016&lt;!-- Print date, presumably - web article was online earlier--&gt;|accessdate=14 July 2016|author=Toby Young|newspaper=The Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' has called this argument "complacent", however, identifying a qualitative difference between political scandals of previous generations, such as those surrounding the [[Suez Crisis]] and the [[Iran–Contra affair]] (which involved attempting to cover-up the truth) and contemporary ones in which public facts are simply ignored.&lt;ref name=economist-10-9-16/&gt; Similarly, Alexios Mantzarlis of the [[Poynter Institute]] said that political lies were not new and identified several political campaigns in history which would now be described as "post-truth". For Mantzarlis, the "post-truth" label was—to some extent—a "[[coping mechanism]] for commentators reacting to attacks on not just any facts, but on those central to their belief system", but also noted that 2016 had been "an acrimonious year for politics on both sides of the Atlantic".&lt;ref name="Poynter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poynter.org/2016/no-were-not-in-a-post-fact-era/421582/|title=No, we’re not in a ‘post-fact’ era|date=21 July 2016|accessdate=27 October 2016|author=Alexios Mantzarlis|website=Poynter Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mantzarlis also noted that interest in [[fact checking]] had never been higher, suggesting that at least part of the electorate rejects "post-truth" politics.&lt;ref name="Poynter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/fact-check-this-is-not-really-a-post-fact-election/2016/10/07/7ef5f8fa-85c0-11e6-92c2-14b64f3d453f_story.html|title=Fact check: This is not really a post-fact election|publisher=Washington Post|date=7 October 2016|accessdate=27 October 2016|author=Alexios Mantzarlis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Helfand]] argues, following Edward M. Harris, that "public prevarication is nothing new" and that it is the "knowledge of the audience" and the "limits of plausibility" within a technology-saturated environment that have changed. We are, rather, in an age of misinformation where such limits of plausibility have vanished and where everyone feels equally qualified to make claims that are easily shared and propagated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Helfand |first1=David J. |authorlink1=David Helfand |title=Surviving the Misinformation Age |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=34-39 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006193643/https://www.csicop.org/si/show/surviving_the_misinformation_age |accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Post-truth politics has been applied as a political buzzword to a wide range of political cultures; one article in ''The Economist'' identified post-truth politics in [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[North Korea]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Turkey]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=economist-10-9-16/&gt;

===Germany===

In December 2016 "[[:de:Postfaktische Politik|postfaktisch]]" (post-factual) was named word of the year by the ''[[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]]'' (''German language society''), also in connection with a rise of [[right-wing populism]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gfds.de/wort-des-jahres-2016/|title=GfdS wählt »postfaktisch« zum Wort des Jahres 2016|date=9 December 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Alternative for Germany#Petry assumes leadership, Lucke quits|2015]] on.  Since the 1990s, "[[Colin Crouch#Post Democracy|post-democracy]]" was used in sociology more and more.

===India===
Amulya Gopalakrishnan, columnist for ''[[The Times of India]]'', identified similarities between the Trump and Brexit campaigns on the one hand, and [[hot-button issue]]s in India such as the [[Ishrat Jahan case]] and the ongoing case against [[Teesta Setalvad]] on the other, where accusations of forged evidence and [[historical revisionism]] have resulted in an "ideological impasse".&lt;ref name="TOI-brexit-trump"/&gt;

===South Africa===

Health care and education in South Africa was substantially compromised during the presidency of [[Thabo Mbeki]] due to his [[HIV/AIDS denialism]].

===United Kingdom===
An early use of the phrase in British politics was in March 2012 by [[Scottish Labour]] [[Member of Scottish Parliament|MSP]] [[Iain Gray]] in criticising the difference between [[Scottish National Party]]'s claims and official statistics.&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beware the black art of post-truth politics|author=Iain Gray|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/iain-gray-beware-the-black-art-of-post-truth-politics-1-2146059|date=1 March 2012|accessdate=11 July 2016|newspaper=The Scotsman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish Labour leader [[Jim Murphy]] also described an undercurrent of post-truth politics in which people "cheerfully [[shooting the messenger|shot the messenger]]" when presented with facts that didn't support their viewpoint, seeing it among pro-independence campaigners in the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]], [[Jeremy Corbyn]] supporters in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 2015|2015 Labour leadership election]], and Leave campaigners in the then-upcoming EU membership referendum.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2015/09/we-live-volatile-age-post-truth-politics-and-so-brexit-cannot-be-ruled-out|title=We live in a volatile age of post-truth politics – and so Brexit cannot be ruled out|author=Jim Murphy|newspaper=New Statesman|date=23 September 2015|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-truth politics has been retroactively identified in the [[lead-up to the Iraq War]],&lt;ref name="Dunt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Post-truth politics is driving us mad |url=http://www.politics.co.uk/blogs/2016/06/29/post-truth-politics-is-driving-us-mad|date=29 June 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|publisher=politics.co.uk|author=Ian Dunt}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly after the [[Chilcot Report]], published in July 2016, concluded that [[Tony Blair]] misrepresented [[military intelligence]] to support his view that [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq's chemical weapons program]] was advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jul/08/iraq-war-tony-blair-creativity-chilcot-inquiry|title=Millions of us knew the Iraq war would be a catastrophe.

The phrase became widely used during the [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|2016 UK EU membership referendum]] to describe the Leave campaign.&lt;ref name="Freedland-nojoke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo-era"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wollaston"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirror-350m"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/post-truth-politics-michael-gove-8111335|title=Post-truth politics: Michael Gove accused of 'importing Trump campaign' to Britain with £350m a week claim|newspaper=The Mirror|date=3 June 2016|accessdate=11 July 2016|author=Mikey Smith, Rachel Bishop}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Faisal Islam]], political editor for [[Sky News]], said that [[Michael Gove]] used "post-fact politics" that were imported from the Trump campaign; in particular, Gove's comment in an interview that "I think people in this country have had enough of experts..." was singled out as illustrative of a post-truth trend, although this is only part of a longer statement.&lt;ref name="WaPo-era"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirror-350m"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Matthew Flinders (academic)|Matthew Flinders]], [http://blog.oup.com/2016/07/post-political-democracy-uk-referendum Post-truth, post-political, post-democracy: the tragedy of the UK's referendum on the European Union], ''OUPBlog'' ([[Oxford University Press]] (3 July 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Arron Banks]], the founder of the unofficial [[Leave.EU]] campaign, said that "facts don't work ... You've got to connect with people emotionally. It's the Trump success."&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt; [[Andrea Leadsom]]—a prominent campaigner for Leave in the EU referendum and one of the two final candidates in the [[Conservative Party (UK) leadership election, 2016|Conservative leadership election]]—has been singled out as a post-truth politician,&lt;ref name="Deacon"/&gt; especially after she denied having disparaged rival [[Theresa May]]'s childlessness in an interview with ''[[The Times]]'' in spite of transcript evidence.&lt;ref name="Viner"/&gt;

===United States===
In its original formulation, the phrase "post-truth politics" was used to describe the paradoxical situation in the United States where the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], which enforced stricter [[party discipline]] than the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], was nevertheless able to present itself as more [[bipartisan]], since individual Democrats were more likely to support Republican policies than vice versa.&lt;ref name="Coining"/&gt; The term was used by [[Paul Krugman]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' to describe [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012|Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign]] in which certain claims—such as that [[Barack Obama]] had cut defense spending and that he had embarked on an "apology tour"—continued to be repeated long after they had been debunked.&lt;ref name="Krugman"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/opinion/krugman-the-post-truth-campaign.html|title=The Post-Truth Campaign|date=23 December 2011|author=Paul Krugman|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of scientific [[denialism]] in modern American politics include the [[anti-vaxxer]] movement, and the [[Genetically modified food controversies|belief that existing genetically modified foods are harmful]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://yoelinbar.net/papers/gmo_absolute.pdf|title=Evidence for Absolute Moral Opposition to Genetically Modified Food in the United States|first1=Sydney E.|last1=Scott|first2=Yoel|last2=Inbar|first3=Paul|last3=Rozin|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|date=2016|volume=11|issue=3|pages=315–324|doi=10.1177/1745691615621275|pmid=27217243}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite a strong scientific consensus that no currently marketed GMO foods have any negative health effects.&lt;ref&gt;See {{section link|Denialism|Genetically modified foods}} for extensive citations.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[health freedom movement]] in the U.S. resulted in the passage of the bipartisan [[Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994]], which allows the sale of dietary supplements without any evidence that they are safe or effective for the purposes consumers expect, though the FDA has begun regulation of [[homeopathic]] products.

In a review for the ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'', Christopher Robichaud—a lecturer in ethics and public policy at [[Harvard Kennedy School]]—described [[conspiracy theories]] about the legitimacy of elections and politicians, such as the "[[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|birther]]" idea that [[Barack Obama]] is not a [[Natural-born-citizen clause|natural-born U.S. citizen]],&lt;!--, and claims from the [[Bernie Sanders]] [[Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] that the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|Democratic Party candidate selection]] was rigged towards [[Hillary Clinton]]--&gt;&amp;nbsp;as one side-effect of post-truth politics. Robichaud also contrasted the behaviour of the candidates with that following the contested result of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]], in which [[Al Gore]] conceded and encouraged his supporters to accept the result of ''[[Bush v.

===Environmental politics===
Although the [[scientific opinion on climate change|consensus among scientists]] is that [[global warming|human activities contribute to global warming]], several political parties around the world have made [[climate change denial]] a basis of their policies. These parties have been accused of using post-truth techniques to attack environmental measures meant to combat climate changes to benefit industry donors.&lt;ref name="WasteManagement"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;dn=687980493190405;res=IELENG|last=Connor|first=John|title=Climate change and post-truth politics|journal=Waste Management and Environment|volume=22|issue=10|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the most recent 2016 election, the United States has seen numerous climate change deniers rise to power, such as new [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] head [[Scott Pruitt]] replacing Barack Obama's appointee [[Gina McCarthy]]. In Australia, the repeal of [[Carbon pricing in Australia|carbon pricing]] by the [[Abbott ministry|government]] of [[Tony Abbott]] was described as "the nadir of post-truth politics" by ''[[The Age]]''.&lt;ref name="Age-abbott"/&gt;

{{undue|date=March 2018|section|reason=What makes this professor's theory notable and no other?}}
Both technology companies and governments have started to make efforts to tackle the challenge of "post-truth politics". In an article for the journal ''[[Global Policy]]'', professor [[Nayef Al-Rodhan]] suggested four particular responses:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/07/06/2017/post-truth-politics-fifth-estate-and-securitization-fake-news Nayef Al-Rodhan, "Post-Truth Politics, the Fifth Estate and the Securitization of Fake News]'', Global Policy Journal, 7th June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''Improve the technological tools for fact checking.'' For example, Germany has already asked [[Facebook]] to introduce a [[fake news]] filtering tool. 
# ''Greater involvement and visibility for scientists and the scientific community.'' The UK, for instance, has a series of Parliamentary committees at which scientists are called to testify, and present their research to inform policy-making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/oxford-university/policy-making-and-parliament-in-an-era-of-post-truth-1086d153e619 |title=Policy-making and parliament in an era of ‘post-truth’ |publisher=Medium.com |date=2017-02-28 |accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Stronger government action.'' In countries such as the Czech Republic, new units have been set up to tackle fake news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Tait in Prague |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/28/czech-republic-to-fight-fake-news-with-specialist-unit |title=Czech Republic to fight 'fake news' with specialist unit &amp;#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important challenge here is to ensure that such state-led efforts are not used as a tool for censorship.
# ''Securitizing fake news.'' It is important to treat post-truth politics as a matter of security and devise global efforts to counter this phenomenon. In March 2017, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression, the OSCE, and the Organization for American States issued a Joint Declaration on "Freedom of Expression and Fake News, Disinformation and Propaganda" to warn against the effects of fake news but, at the same time, condemn any attempts at state-mandated censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=56336#.WVOi61t9671 |title=Amid rise of ‘fake news,’ authorities should ensure truthful info reaches public – UN, regional experts &amp;#124; UN News |publisher=Un.org |date=2017-03-10 |accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kutner |first=Max |url=http://www.newsweek.com/edward-snowden-jack-dorsey-twitter-periscope-531573 |title=Edward Snowden: Fight ‘Fake News’ With Truth, Not Censorship |publisher=Newsweek.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Predicable''' (Lat. praedicabilis, that which may be stated or affirmed, sometimes called ''quinque voces'' or ''five words'') is, in [[term logic|scholastic logic]], a term applied to a [[Categorization|classification]] of the possible relations in which a [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] may stand to its [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]].  It is not to be confused with '[[praedicamenta]]', the [[scholasticism|schoolmen's]] term for [[Aristotle]]'s ten [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]].

The list given by the schoolmen and generally adopted by modern logicians is based on the original fivefold classification given by Aristotle ([[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]], a iv. 101 b 17-25): [[definition]] (''horos''), [[Genus (philosophy)|genus]] (''genos''), [[differentia]] (''diaphora''), [[property (logic)|property]] (''idion''), and [[accident (philosophy)|accident]] (''sumbebekos'').&lt;ref&gt;Strictly Aristotle's classification is into four as διαφορά ([[differentia|''diaphora'']]) really belongs to γένος ([[Genus (philosophy)|''genos'']]).&lt;/ref&gt;  The scholastic classification, obtained from [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boëthius]]'s Latin version of [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s ''[[Isagoge]]'', modified Aristotle's by substituting [[species (logic)|species]] (''eidos'') for definition.  Both classifications are of [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]], [[concept]]s or general [[terminology|terms]], [[proper names]] of course being excluded.  There is, however, a radical difference between the two systems.  The standpoint of the Aristotelian classification is the predication of one universal concerning another.  The Porphyrian, by introducing species, deals with the predication of universals concerning individuals (for species is necessarily predicated of the individual), and thus created difficulties from which the Aristotelian is free (see below).

The Aristotelian classification is: 
* The ''definition'' of anything is the statement of its [[essence]] (Arist. τὸ τί ἦν εἶναι), i.e., that which makes it what it is: e.g., a triangle is a three-sided rectilinear figure.
* ''Genus'' is that part of the essence which is also predicable of other things different from them in kind. A triangle is a rectilinear figure; i.e., in fixing the genus of a thing, we subsume it under a higher universal, of which it is a species. 
* ''Differentia'' is that part of the essence which distinguishes one species from another. As compared with quadrilaterals, hexagons, and so on, all of which are rectilinear figures, a triangle is differentiated as having three sides.
* A ''property'' is an attribute which is common to all the members of a class, but is not part of its essence (i.e., need not be given in its definition). The fact that the interior angles of all triangles are equal to two right angles is not part of the definition, but is universally true.
* An ''accident'' is an attribute which may or may not belong to a subject. That the colour of a human's hair should be black, for instance, is an accident, for blackness-of-hair belongs in no way to the essence of humanity, nor do all humans have black hair.

This classification, though it is of high value in the clearing up of our conceptions of the essential contrasted with the accidental, the relation of genus, differentia and definition and so forth, is of more significance in connection with abstract sciences, especially mathematics, than for the physical sciences. It is superior on the whole to the Porphyrian scheme, which has grave defects. As has been said, the Porphyrian scheme classifies universals as predicates of individuals and thus involves the difficulties which gave rise to the controversy between realism and nominalism. How are we to distinguish species from genus? Napoleon was a Frenchman, a man, an animal. In the second place how do we distinguish property and accident? Many so-called accidents are predicable necessarily of any particular persons. This difficulty gave rise to the distinction of separable and inseparable accidents, which is one of considerable difficulty.

Some Aristotelian examples may be briefly mentioned. In the true statement “Man is a rational animal,” the predicate is convertible with the subject and states its essence; therefore, “rational animal” is the definition of man. The statements “Man is an animal” and “Man is rational,” while true, are not convertible; their predicate terms, however, are parts of the definition and hence are the genus and differentia of man. On the other hand, the statement “Man is capable of learning grammar” is true and convertible; but “capable of learning grammar” does not state the essence of man and is therefore a property of man. The true statement “Man is featherless” offers an example of an accident. Its predicate is not convertible with its subject, nor is it part of the definition; accordingly, it expresses only an accidental characteristic of man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/predicable |title=Predicable, Logic |publisher=Encycopledia Britannica |access-date=March 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2174">'''Prescriptivity''' is a term used in [[meta-ethics]] to state that when an evaluative judgment or decision is made it must either prescribe or condemn. The word implies that these judgments (and the prescription and condemnation) logically commit us to certain ways of living. Contrary to popular opinion prescriptivity does not just describe or categorize decisions for example; "You ought to do this" (used evaluatively) [[logical consequence|logically entails]] the imperative "Do this."

==Universal Prescriptivism==
Prescriptivity is one of the five (prescriptivity, universalizability, overridingness, publicity, and practicability) axioms of Formal [[Ethics]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  When combined with Universalizability, prescriptivity becomes [[Universal prescriptivism]]. Universal precriptivism combines these two methods of thinking, combining evaluative judgments (which commit us to making similar judgments about similar cases) and prescription and condemnation when the judgment is at last made. This enables us to think in a very powerful and [[Rationality|rational]] way about ethical and moral issues.

The '''principle of maximum caliber''' ('''MaxCal''') or '''maximum path entropy principle''', suggested by [[E. T. Jaynes]],&lt;ref name="Jaynes1980" /&gt; can be considered as a generalization of the [[principle of maximum entropy]]. It postulates that the most unbiased probability distribution of paths is the one that maximizes their [[Shannon entropy]]. This entropy of paths is sometimes called the "caliber" of the system, and is given by the path integral

: &lt;math&gt; S[\rho[x()]] = \int D_x \,\, \rho[x()]  \, \ln {\rho[x()] \over \pi[x()]}&lt;/math&gt;

== History ==

The principle of maximum caliber was proposed by [[Edwin T. Jaynes]] in 1980,&lt;ref name="Jaynes1980" /&gt; in an article titled 
''The Minimum Entropy Production Principle'' over the context of to find a principle for to derive the [[non-equilibrium statistical mechanics]].

== Mathematical formulation ==

The principle of maximum caliber can be considered as a generalization of the [[principle of maximum entropy]] defined over the paths space, the caliber &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; is of the form

: &lt;math&gt; S[\rho[x()]] = \int D_x \rho[x()] \ln {\rho[x()] \over \pi[x()]}&lt;/math&gt;

where for ''n''-constraints

: &lt;math&gt; \int D_x \rho[x()] A_n[x()] = \langle A_n[x()] \rangle = a_n &lt;/math&gt;

it is shown that the probability functional is

: &lt;math&gt; \rho[x()] = \exp\left\{ - \sum_{i=0}^n \alpha_n A_n[x()] \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the same way, for n dynamical constraints defined in the interval &lt;math&gt; t \in [0,T] &lt;/math&gt; of the form

: &lt;math&gt; \int D_x \rho[x()] L_n(x(t),\dot x(t), t ) = \langle L_n(x(t),\dot x(t),t ) \rangle = \ell(t)&lt;/math&gt;

it is shown that the probability functional is

: &lt;math&gt; \rho[x()] = \exp\left\{ - \sum_{i=0}^n \int_0^T dt \, \alpha_n(t) L_n(x(t),\dot x(t), t ) \right\}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Maximum caliber and statistical mechanics==

Following the hypothesis of Jaynes, there are publications in which it appears as the principle of maximum caliber it is framed in the context of creating a statistical representation of systems with many degrees of freedom.&lt;ref name="Presse2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazoglou2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis2015" /&gt;

[[File:Colorful Clown 3.jpg|thumb|This ridiculously small hat is incongruous with the man's head size.|200px]]

To be '''ridiculous''' is to be something which is highly incongruous or inferior, sometimes deliberately so to make people laugh or get their attention, and sometimes unintendedly so as to be considered laughable and earn or provoke ridicule and derision. It comes from the 1540s Latin "ridiculosus" meaning  "laughable", from "ridiculus" meaning  "that which excites laughter", and from "ridere" meaning "to laugh".&lt;ref name=DC&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/ridiculous Dictionary.com]&lt;/ref&gt; "Ridiculous" is an adjective describing "the ridiculous".

In common usage, "ridiculousness" is used as a synonym for [[absurdity]] or [[nonsense]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nonsensical Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.com/browse/illogicality Thesaurus.com]&lt;/ref&gt; From a historical and technical viewpoint, "absurdity" is associated with argumentation and reasoning, "nonsense" with [[semantics]] and [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]], while "ridiculous" is most associated with laughter, superiority, deformity, and incongruity. ''[[Reductio ad absurdum]]'' is a valid method of [[argument]], while ''[[appeal to ridicule|reductio ad ridiculum]]'' is invalid. Argument by [[invective]] declaration of ridiculous is invalid, while arguments involving declarations of nonsense may summarize a [[logical reasoning|cogent]] semantic problem with lack or meaning or [[ambiguity]].

Historically, the ridiculous was central to initial theories of humor and laughter as first put forth by philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]]. It is currently used in the [[theories of humor|theory of humor]] to create laughter, shock, parody, or satire. Reactions to the ridiculous have been studied in [[psychology]] for its effects on memory, attention, and attitude in social hierarchies. These studies have been applied to the theory of advertisement regarding attention, memory, and alleviation of preexisting negative attitudes toward products. The ridiculous is often contrasted with the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], one of extreme inferiority, the other of extreme superiority, and often one can suddenly move from one extreme state to the other.

=== History: Incongruity, the superiority theory of humor, and deformity ===
The ridiculous often has extreme incongruity (things that are not thought to belong next to each other) or inferiority, e.g., "when something that was dignified is reduced to a
ridiculous position (here noting the element of the incongruous), so that laughter
is most intense when we escape from a 'coerced solemnity'."&lt;ref&gt;''Humour, Jokes and the Statement'', Journal of Human Values, 2006, S Acharya, [http://jhv.sagepub.com/content/12/2/179.short]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/3/284 British Journal of Aesthetics, (1964) 4 (3), Harold Osborne, p.284]&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Aristotle]], we laugh at inferior or [[unattractiveness|ugly]] individuals, because we feel a joy at being superior to them.&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'', 1449a, p. 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socrates]] was reported by [[Plato]] as saying that the ridiculous was characterized by a display of self-ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Philebus'' 49b ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deformity]] was considered by some to be essential to the ridiculous.&lt;ref&gt;Laughter as a Test of Truth in Enlightenment Satire'', Werner von Koppenfels&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HEL&gt;A history of English Laughter: Laughter from Beowulf to Beckett and Beyond, Manfred Pfister&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological theories of humor  include the "incongruity theory" and the "superiority theory", the latter of which the philosopher Thomas Hobbes was an early proponent.&lt;ref&gt;The Perception of Humor, Willibald Ruch, Emotions, qualia, and consciousness, Biocybernetics, VOl. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How Many Feminists Does It Take To Make A Joke? Sexist Humor and What's Wrong With It, Memo Bergmann, Hypatia, Vol.1, Issue 1, March 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humor as a Double‐Edged Sword: Four Functions of Humor in Communication, JC Meyer, Communication Theory, Volume 10, Issue 3, pages 310–331, August 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes claimed that laughter was either caused spontaneously, or by seeing a deformed thing to which one compares themselves and laugh as a form of self applause; "a sudden glory arising from sudden conception of some eminency in ourselves, by comparison of the infirmities of others." &lt;ref name=HEL/&gt; The Right Reverend [[William Warburton]], [[Lord Bishop]] of [[Gloucester]] said in the early 18th century that, "Nothing is ridiculous but what is deformed".&lt;ref&gt;The divine legation of Moses demonstrated, William Warburton&lt;/ref&gt; Using the ridiculous is a method in the theory of humor.&lt;ref&gt;Investigating the humor of gelotophobes: Does feeling ridiculous equal being humorless?, Humor - International Journal of Humor Research. Volume 22, Issue 1-2, Pages 111–143, ISSN (Online) 1613-3722, ISSN (Print) 0933-1719, {{doi|10.1515/HUMR.2009.006}}, /February/2009, Willibald Ruch, Ursula Beermann, [http://www.reference-global.com/doi/abs/10.1515/HUMR.2009.006?journalCode=humr]{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although common usage now considers "absurdity" to be synonymous with "ridiculousness", Hobbes discussed the two concepts as different, in that absurdity is viewed as having to do with invalid reasoning, as in [[Hobbes' Table of Absurdity]], while ridiculousness has to do with laughter, superiority, ridicule, and deformity.

=== Native American Ritual Clown ===
{{Further information|Ritual clown}}
The [[Ritual clown]] ([[Heyókȟa]]) in some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] culture uses the painfully ridiculous, and is believed to become closer to the gods by its [[:wikt:primordial|primordial]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;''Native American Postcolonial Psychology'', E Duran, B Duran&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ambigere: The Euro-American Picaro and the Native American Trickster, Melus, The Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States Vol. 17, No. 1, Spring 1991, F Ballinger&lt;/ref&gt; Native American clowns are ridiculous in their contrary and rule breaking antics.&lt;ref&gt;The Mythology of Evil Among North American Indian Yuroks and Its Implications for Western Spirituality, Anthropology of Consciousness, Volume 7, Issue 3, pages 15–29, September 1996, Royal Alsup, Stanley Krippne, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/467321]&lt;/ref&gt; In the film ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'', the sacred clown rides sitting backwards on his horse, "washes" himself with dirt and "dries" himself with water.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer L. McMahon, B. Steve Csaki, ''The Philosophy of the Western'' (2010), p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Heyókȟa are thought of as being incongruously backwards-forwards, upside-down, or contrary in nature. This spirit is often manifest by doing things backwards or unconventionally—riding a horse backwards, wearing clothes inside-out, or speaking backwards. For example, if food were scarce, a Heyókȟa would sit around and complain about how full he was; during a baking hot heat wave a Heyókȟa would shiver with cold and put on gloves and cover himself with a thick blanket. Similarly, when it is 40 degrees below freezing he will wander around naked for hours complaining that it is too hot.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

==== Parody and satire in social commentary ====
{{Further information|Parody|Satire}}
The ridiculous can use uses both physical and conceptual inferiority and incongruity of juxtaposition to create [[parody]] and [[satire]].

In ''[[Candide]]'',  [[Voltaire]] parodies [[Leibniz]]'s argument for the [[existence of evil]] under a benign God using ''"ridiculous rationalizations of evil"''.&lt;ref name="TCD"&gt;''"ridiculous rationalizations of evil"''. Teaching Candide-A Debate, The French Review, Vol 61, No. 5, 1988, Theodore E. D. Braun, Felicia Sturzer, Martine Darmon Meyer, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/393842]&lt;/ref&gt; Leibniz claimed that God is constrained by logic, and created the best of all ''[[possible worlds]]''. After being reduced from a "[[dignity|dignified]]" state to its opposite, the [[optimistic]] Dr. [[Panglossian|Pangloss]] (representing Leibniz) finds cause to consider his undignified position to be the best of all possible worlds, noting his own particular current happiness, which he argues could not have been attained without experiencing the atrocities in the previous narrative; his optimistic attitude is extremely incongruous with his experiences and extremely inferior undignified ultimate condition.&lt;ref name= TCD/&gt;

In [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', apelike humans and their behavior are juxtaposed next to streamlined advanced technology with a highly avant garde score by composer [[György Ligeti]]; Ligeti also used ridiculous juxtaposition in his scores to create parody,&lt;ref&gt;Blending the Sublime and the Ridiculous: A Study of Parody in György Ligeti's Le Grand Macabre, Sewell, Amanda J, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110720021116/http://etd.ohiolink.edu/view.cgi?bgsu1150987452]&lt;/ref&gt; and this tool was frequently used by composer [[Peter Maxwell Davies]].

=== Deformity and incongruity in performance as social commentary, and lifestyle ===

==== Japanese Butoh dance ====
{{Further information|Butoh}}
Japanese [[Butoh]] uses both incongruity and deformity to create ridiculous dance performance and lifestyle; extreme movement methods that are highly incongruous with natural body movement in its dance and everyday lifestyle, as well as in its clothing, actions, costume and set design that is highly incongruous with societal norms, which often shock the audience or visitor, and are sometimes considered not only ridiculous, but incongruently "bizarre and [[beauty|beautiful]]" or "[[elegant]] and [[grotesque]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bizarre World of Butoh'', San Fransciso Weekly&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bizzare and the Beautiful'', Los Angeles Times, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Theatre of the Ridiculous ====
{{Further information|Theatre of the Ridiculous}}
The Theatre of the Ridiculous uses highly incongruous stage settings and incongruous costumes such as [[cross dressing]] to disturb or create shock in the audience.&lt;ref&gt;Conquest of the Ridiculous:Ronald Tavel, John Vaccaro and Charles Ludlam, WarholStars, [http://www.warholstars.org/ridiculous.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychology: attention, memory, and attitudes ==
Psychologists have studied human response to the ridiculous and its effects on attention and memory.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Psychology of Advertising, Walter Dill Scott, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Art of Memory: Usefulness in Treatment, Bernard M. Patten, Archives of Neurology, 1972;26(1):25-31, [http://archneur.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/1/25]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advertising===
The ridiculous is used in advertising to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]] attention and attitudes toward products.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Music for advertising effects, Psychology and Marketing, Volume 1, Issue 3-4, 1984, S Hecker&lt;/ref&gt;

== Juxtaposition with the sublime {{anchor| Ridiculous and the sublime}} ==
The ridiculous is sometimes contrasted to the sublime where something with one quality is thought of as approaching, or likely to change to, the other.

[[Thomas Paine]], writing in ''[[The Age of Reason]]'' in 1795, said ''The sublime and the ridiculous are often so nearly related, that it is difficult to class them separately. One step above the sublime, makes the ridiculous; and one step above the ridiculous, makes the sublime again.''&lt;ref name=odp&gt;{{cite book|chapter=sublime | title=The Oxford Dictionary of Proverbs | editor=Jennifer Speake | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=2009 | url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t90.e2157| accessdate=2011-02-13}}  ''Available online to subscribers''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon]], reflecting on the state of his existence following his retreat from Moscow in 1812, famously remarked to Polish ambassador [[Dominique-Georges-Frédéric Dufour de Pradt|D. G. De Pradt]]: ''Du sublime au ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas'' (''There is only one step from the sublime to the ridiculous'').&lt;ref name=DC/&gt;&lt;ref name=odp /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Columbia Dictionary of Quotations, Robert Andrews&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Journal of Aesthetics, Aesthetics (1964) 4 (3), Harold Osborne, p. 284-5, [http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/content/4/3/284]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reduction to the ridiculous,  or "reductio ad ridiculum" ===
{{Further information|Appeal to ridicule|Red herring|straw man}}
Reduction to the ridiculous (Latin: "reductio ad ridiculum", also called "Appeal to ridicule", "appeal to mockery", or "the Horse Laugh") is a logical fallacy which presents the opponent's argument in a way that grossly misrepresents it and appears ridiculous next to it, often so misrepresentative as to create a [[straw man]] argument, rather than addressing the argument itself.&lt;ref name=WT&gt;''Wishful Thinking and Other Philosophical Reflections'', Nicholas Rescher, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in arguing against [[idealism]], with its sophisticated arguments that the world was not real but only existed in the [[mind]], philosopher [[Dr. Johnson]] famously kicked a stone.&lt;ref Name=WT/&gt;

Contrasting ridiculousness with absurdity in [[reasoning]], ''Reductio ad ridiculum'' is an invalid method of argument, while ''reductio ad absurdum'' is a valid method.

=== Invective ===
Arguments are often simply dismissed by calling them "ridiculous" as invective, without further argumentation.&lt;ref name=WT/&gt; Philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] often dismissed philosophical positions by calling them "ridiculous" without further argument given.&lt;ref name=WT/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="43645">'''Self-compassion''' is extending [[compassion]] to one's self in instances of perceived inadequacy, failure, or general [[suffering]]. [[Kristin Neff]] has defined self-compassion as being composed of three main components – self-kindness, common humanity, and [[mindfulness]].&lt;ref name="neff-a"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15298860309027 | last1 = Neff | first1 = K. D. | year = 2003a | title = The development and validation of a scale to measure self-compassion | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 223–250 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.362.5757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Self-kindness: Self-compassion [[logical consequence|entails]] being warm towards oneself when encountering pain and personal shortcomings, rather than ignoring them or hurting oneself with self-criticism.
*Common humanity: Self-compassion also involves recognizing that suffering and personal failure is part of the shared human experience.
*[[Mindfulness]]: Self-compassion requires taking a balanced approach to one's negative emotions so that feelings are neither suppressed nor exaggerated.  Negative thoughts and emotions are observed with openness, so that they are held in mindful awareness. Mindfulness is a non-judgmental, receptive mind state in which individuals observe their thoughts and feelings as they are, without trying to suppress or deny them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.84.4.822 | last1 = Brown | first1 = K.

R. | last2 = Lau | first2 = M. | last3 = Shapiro | first3 = S. | last4 = Carlson | first4 = L. | last5 = Anderson | first5 = N. D. | last6 = Carmody | first6 = J. | last7 = Segal | first7 = Z. V.

Self-compassion has been considered to resemble [[Carl Rogers]]' notion of "[[unconditional positive regard]]" applied both towards clients and oneself; [[Albert Ellis]]' "unconditional self-acceptance"; Maryhelen Snyder's notion of an "internal empathizer" that explored one's own experience with "curiosity and compassion"; [[Ann Weiser Cornell]]'s notion of a [[Inner Relationship Focusing#Description|gentle, allowing relationship]] with all parts of one's being; and [[Judith V. Jordan|Judith Jordan]]'s concept of ''self-empathy'', which implies acceptance, care and [[empathy]] towards the self.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Buck, David Lukoff: [http://www.spiritualcompetency.com/scrcQuiz.aspx?courseID=65 Self-Compassion i: Spiritual and Psychological Roots] (course description), SCRC&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-compassion is different from [[self-pity]], a state of mind or emotional response of a person believing to be a victim and lacking the confidence and competence to [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with an adverse situation.

Research indicates that self-compassionate individuals experience greater [[psychological health]] than those who lack self-compassion.  For example, self-compassion is positively associated with [[life satisfaction]], [[wisdom]], [[happiness]], [[optimism]], [[curiosity]], learning goals, [[social connectedness]], personal responsibility, and [[emotional resilience]].  At the same time, it is associated with a lower tendency for [[self-criticism]], depression, [[anxiety]], [[Rumination (psychology)|rumination]], [[thought suppression]], [[perfectionism (psychology)|perfectionism]], and disordered eating attitudes.&lt;ref name="neff-a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, C.

Self-compassion has different effects than [[self-esteem]], a subjective emotional evaluation of the self. Although psychologists extolled the benefits of self-esteem for many years, recent research has exposed costs associated with the pursuit of high self-esteem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.130.3.392 | last1 = Crocker | first1 = J. | last2 = Park | first2 = L.

== Scales ==
Much of the research conducted on self-compassion so far has used the Self-Compassion Scale, created by [[Kristin Neff]], which measures the degree to which individuals display self-kindness against self-judgment, common humanity versus [[Isolation (psychology)|isolation]], and [[mindfulness]] versus over-identification.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Self-Compassion Scale has been translated into different languages.

=== Development ===
The original sample for which the scale was developed consisted of 68 undergraduate students from a large university in the United States. In this experiment, the participants narrowed down the potential scale items to 71.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neff | first1 = K. D. | year = 2003a | title = The development and validation of a scale to measure self-compassion | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 2 | issue = 3| pages = 223–250 | doi=10.1080/15298860309027| citeseerx = 10.1.1.362.5757 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next stage of development involved testing the [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] of the scale among a larger group of participants. During this research study, 391 undergraduate students were selected at random to complete the 71 previously narrowed down scale items.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Based on their results, the number of items was reduced to 26.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The self-compassion scales have good reliability and validity.&lt;ref name="Van Dam"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Dam | first1 = N. T. | last2 = Sheppard | first2 = S.C. | last3 = Forsyth | first3 = J.P. | last4 = Earleywine | first4 = M. | year = 2011 | title = Self-compassion is a better predictor than mindfulness of symptom severity and quality of life in mixed anxiety and depression | doi = 10.1016/j.janxdis.2010.08.011 | pmid = 20832990 | journal = Journal of Anxiety Disorders | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 123–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second study was conducted to look more closely at the difference between [[self-esteem]] and self-compassion. This study consisted of 232 randomly selected, undergraduate students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Participants were asked to complete a number of different scales in [[questionnaire]] form. They were as follows: The 26-item Self-compassion Scale, the 10-item [[Rosenberg self-esteem scale|Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale]], the 10-item Self-determination Scale, the 21-item Basic Psychological Needs Scale, and the 40-item [[Narcissistic Personality Inventory]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Based on the findings, Neff reports "that self-compassion and [[self-esteem]] were measuring two different psychological phenomena."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A third study was conducted to examine the [[construct validity]]. By comparing two different groups of people, researchers would be able to see the different levels of self-compassion. Forty-three [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practitioners completed the Self-compassion Scale as well as a [[self-esteem]] scale.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The sample of 232 undergraduate students from the second study was used as the comparison group. As expected by Neff, the Buddhist practitioners had significantly higher self-compassion scores than the students.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Self-compassion scale  ===
The long version of the Self-compassion scale (SCS) consists of 26 items. This includes 6 subscales – self-kindness, self-judgement, common humanity, [[isolation (psychology)|isolation]], [[mindfulness]], and over-identification. Neff recommends this scale for ages 14 and up with a minimum 8th grade reading level.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

Presented on a [[Likert scale]], ranging from 1 (almost no self-compassion) to 5 (constant self-compassion), those completing the SCS are able to gain insight on how they respond to themselves during a struggle or challenging time.&lt;ref name="Van Dam"/&gt;

A shorter, Dutch version of the SCS scale has been developed that uses 24 items.&lt;ref name="Van Dam"/&gt;

=== Short form  ===
The short version of the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS-SF) consists of 12 items and is available in Dutch and English.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Research reveals that the short form scale can be used competently as a substitute for the long form scale.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Raes | first1 = F. | last2 = Pommier | first2 = E. | last3 = Neff | first3 = K. D. | last4 = Van Gucht | first4 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Construction and factorial validation of a short form of the Self-Compassion Scale | url = | journal = Clinical Psychology &amp; Psychotherapy | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 250–255 | doi=10.1002/cpp.702| pmid = 21584907 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted at the University of Leuven, Belgium concluded that when examining total scores, this shorter version provides an almost perfect correlation with the longer version.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Six-factor model ===
Neff's scale proposes three interacting components of self-compassion, which are each composed of two opposite facets. The first dimension is self-kindness versus self-judgment. Self-kindness refers to one's ability to be kind and understanding of oneself, whereas self-judgement refers to being critical and harsh towards oneself. The second dimension is common humanity versus isolation. Common humanity refers to one's ability to recognize that they are part of a related group of others and that suffering is part of the human condition. The third dimension is mindfulness versus over-identification. Mindfulness refers to one's awareness and acceptance of painful experiences in a balanced and non-judgmental way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://self-compassion.org/the-three-elements-of-self-compassion-2/|title = Self-Compassion|date = 2015|accessdate = 3 August 2015|website = |publisher = |last = Neff|first = Kristin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neff describes these three dimensions interacting to enhance and engender one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Self-Compassion: An Alternative Conceptualization of a Healthy Attitude Toward Oneself|last = Neff|first = Kristin|date = 2003|journal = Psychology Press|doi = 10.1080/15298860309032|pmid = |volume=2|issue = 2|pages=85–101|citeseerx = 10.1.1.616.6302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticisms of Neff's scale ===
Currently, Kristin Neff's Self-Compassion Scale is the only self-report instrument used to measure self-compassion. Although it is widely accepted as being a reliable and valid tool to measure self-compassion, recent research has posed questions regarding the scale's generalizability and its use of a six-factor model.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Reconsideration of the Self-Compassion Scale's Total Score: Self-Compassion versus Self-Criticism|last = Lopez|first = Angelica|date = 20 July 2015|journal = PLOS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0132940|pmid = 26193654|volume=10|issue = 7|pages=e0132940|pmc=4508060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Generalizability ====
The generalizability of Neff's Self-Compassion Scale can be questioned; although the scale is used to measure self-compassion in the general population and has been translated into many languages, the scale itself has mostly been tested on college students.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Six-factor model ====
A recent study performed by Angélica López et al. examined the factor structure, reliability, and construct validity of Neff's Self-compassion Scale using a large representative sample from the general population. The study consisted of 1,736 participants and used both a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine if Neff's six-factor structure could be replicated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Lopez's study could not replicate the six-factor structure of Neff's Self-compassion Scale, but rather suggested a two-factor model of the scale, created by grouping the positive and negative items separately. Lopez's study also suggests it is important to view self-compassion and self-criticism as being distinct from one another, traits that Neff's Self-compassion Scale assumes are opposites. Lopez's study makes it clear that there is room for further research into the validity of the six-factor structure used by Neff's Self-compassion Scale.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Exercises ==
Self-compassion exercises generally consist of either a writing exercise, role-playing, or introspective contemplation, and are designed to foster self-kindness, mindfulness, and feelings of common humanity. Self-compassion exercises have been shown to be effective in increasing self-compassion, along with increases in self-efficacy, optimism, and mindfulness.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Meeting Suffering With Kindness: Effects of a Brief Self-Compassion Intervention for Female College Students|journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology|date = 2014-01-01|volume = 70|issue = 9|doi = 10.1002/jclp.22076|pmid = 24691680|first = Elke|last = Smeets|first2 = Kristin|last2 = Neff|first3 = Hugo|last3 = Alberts|first4 = Madelon|last4 = Peters|pages=794–807}}&lt;/ref&gt; These exercises have also been shown to decrease rumination.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In individuals who were vulnerable to depression, one week of daily self-compassion exercises lead to reduced depression up to three months following the exercise, and increased happiness up to six months following the exercise, regardless of the pre-exercise levels of happiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The benefits of self-compassion and optimism exercises for individuals vulnerable to depression|journal = The Journal of Positive Psychology|date = 2010-09-01|issn = 1743-9760|pages = 377–389|volume = 5|issue = 5|doi = 10.1080/17439760.2010.516763|first = Leah B.|last = Shapira|first2 = Myriam|last2 = Mongrain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How would you treat a friend? ===
This exercise asks the user to imagine that they are comforting a close friend who is going through a tough situation. The user is then asked to compare and contrast how they react internally to their own struggles, and to endeavour applying the same loving kindness to themselves that they would apply to a friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 1: How would you treat a friend?|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-1-treat-friend/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Self-compassion break ===
This exercise is to be used during times of acute distress. The user is asked to focus on a stressful event or situation. Then, the user is asked to repeat several prompts to themselves, each of which emphasizes one of the three main tenets of self-compassion: [[mindfulness]], [[common humanity]], and self-kindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 1: How would you treat a friend?|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-2-self-compassion-break/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exploring through writing ===
In this exercise, the user is asked to focus on a facet of themself that they believe to be an imperfection, and that makes them feel inadequate. Once they have brought this issue to mind, they are asked to write a letter to themself from the perspective of an unconditionally loving imaginary friend. The user is then asked to focus on the soothing and comforting feelings of compassion that they have generated for themself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 3: Exploring self-compassion through writing|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-3-exploring-self-compassion-writing/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticizer, criticized, and compassionate observer ===
This exercise asks the user to occupy several "chairs" during the course of the practice. Initially, they are asked to occupy the chair of the self-critic, and to express their feelings of [[self-criticism]]. They are asked to analyze this criticism and make note of its defining characteristics. Then, the user is asked to take the chair of their criticized self, and to imagine verbally responding to their inner critic. Subsequently, the user is prompted to conduct a dialogue between these two aspects of the self, the criticizer and the criticized. Following this, the user is asked to imagine themself as a compassionate observer of this dialogue, and finally the user is asked to reflect upon the experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 4: The criticizer, the criticized, and the compassionate observer|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-4-criticizer-criticized-compassionate-observer/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Changing your critical self-talk ===
This exercise is meant to be conducted over several weeks, in the form of recurring reflection on the nature of their self-criticism. Users are asked to aim to notice when they are being self-critical, to react to their self-criticism with compassion, and to reframe the language of their inner critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 5: Changing your critical self-talk|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-5-changing-critical-self-talk/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Journal ===
This exercise entails keeping a daily journal for at least one week, and is used to reflect on difficult experiences, self-criticisms, and other stressors. The user is asked to analyze each of these events through the lenses of self-kindness (using gentle, comforting language to respond to the event), mindfulness (awareness of the negative emotions elicited by the situation), and common humanity (how the experience is part of the human condition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 6: Self-Compassion Journal|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-6-self-compassion-journal/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Identifying what we really want ===
In this exercise, the user is asked to think about the ways that they use self-criticism as a way to motivate themself. Then, the user is asked to try to come up with a kinder and gentler and more caring way of motivating themself to make the desired change, and to try and be aware of how they use self-criticism as a motivational tool in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 7: Identifying what we really want|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-7-identifying-really-want/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taking care of the caregiver ===
This exercise prompts the user to engage in meaningful self-care on a regular basis, and to practice these techniques while they are actively caring for others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin|title=Exercise 8: Taking care of the caregiver|url=http://self-compassion.org/exercise-8-taking-care-caregiver/|website=self-compassion.org|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-forgiveness as an element ==
Self-forgiveness is an element of self-compassion that involves releasing self-directed negative feelings. Research has found that self-forgiveness promotes greater overall well-being, specifically higher self-esteem and lower neuroticism.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Self-Forgiveness versus Excusing: The Roles of Remorse, Effort, and Acceptance of Responsibility|last = Fisher|first = Mickie|date = 2006|journal = Psychology Press|doi = 10.1080/15298860600586123|pmid = |volume=5|issue = 2|pages=127–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pro-social behavior ===
When self-directed negative feelings are a result of negative past action, self-forgiveness does not mean ignoring or excusing offenses, but rather practicing self-compassion while taking full responsibility for past action. In this way, self-forgiveness may increase people's willingness to repent for wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Despite this research, there is not yet a clear link between self-forgiveness and pro-social behavior. It would seem that accepting responsibility for negative actions leads to pro-social behavior, and coupling acceptance with self-forgiveness increases this effect.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Self-acceptance as an element ==
Self-acceptance is an element of self-compassion that involves accepting oneself for who and what they are. Self-acceptance differs from [[self-esteem]] in that self-esteem involves globally evaluating one's worth. Self-acceptance means accepting the self despite flaws, weaknesses, and negative evaluations from others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unconditional Self-Acceptance and Psychological Health|last = Chamberlain|first = John|date = 2001|journal = Journal of Rational-Emotive &amp; Cognitive-Behavior Therapy|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mindfulness ==

===History ===
The concept of [[mindfulness]] and self-compassion has been around for over 2500 years, and is rooted in Eastern traditional [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosophy and Buddhist meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cigolla | first1 = F. | last2 = Brown | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = A way of being: Bringing mindfulness into individual therapy | url = | journal = Psychotherapy Research | volume = 21 | issue = 6| pages = 709–721 | doi = 10.1080/10503307.2011.613076 | pmid = 21943184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Pilot Study and Randomized Controlled Trial of the Mindful Self-Compassion Program|journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology|date = 2012-01-01|volume = 69|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/jclp.21923|pmid = 23070875|first = Kristin D.|last = Neff|first2 = Christopher K.|last2 = Germer|pages=28–44|citeseerx = 10.1.1.362.7685}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Buddhist philosophy, mindfulness and compassion is considered to be two wings of one bird, with each concept overlapping one another but producing benefits for wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The word Mindfulness is the English translation of the word Vipassan, which a combination of two words Vi, meaning in a special way and Passana, to observe, hence implying to observe in a special way.&lt;ref&gt;Nehra, D.

Delhi: Global Vision Publishing House''. from http://globalvisionpub.com/globaljournalmanager/pdf/1389680520.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; [[Compassion]] (karunaa) can be defined as an emotion that elicits the wanting to be free from suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Loving-kindness and compassion meditation: Potential for psychological interventions|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272735811001115|journal = Clinical Psychology Review|date = 2011-01-01|pmc = 3176989|pmid = 21840289|volume = 31|issue = 7|doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2011.07.003|first = Stefan G.|last = Hofmann|first2 = Paul|last2 = Grossman|first3 = Devon E.|last3 = Hinton|pages=1126–1132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness in the context of self-compassion comprises acknowledging one's painful experiences in a balanced way that neither ignores, or ruminates on the disliked characteristics of oneself or life. According to Neff (2012) it is essential to be mindful of one's own personal suffering in order to extend compassion towards one's self. However it is essential to pay attention to self suffering in a  grounded way in order to avoid "over-identification".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Mindfulness tends to focus on the internal experience such as sensation, emotion and thoughts rather than focusing on the experiencer. Self-compassion focuses on soothing and comforting the self when faced with distressing experiences.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Self-compassion is composed of three components; self kindness verses self-judgement, a sense of common humanity versus isolation and mindfulness versus over-identification when confronting painful thoughts and emotions.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

===Mindfulness-based stress reduction ===
[[Mindfulness-based stress reduction]] ([[Mindfulness-based stress reduction|MBSR]]), developed by [[Jon Kabat-Zinn]] is a structured group program that uses [[mindfulness meditation]] to relieve suffering associated with physical, [[Psychosomatic Illness|psychosomatic]] and [[psychiatric disorders]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Teaching self-care to caregivers: Effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction on the mental health of therapists in training|journal = Training and Education in Professional Psychology|date = 2007-01-01|volume = 1|issue = 2|doi = 10.1037/1931-3918.1.2.105|first = Shauna L.|last = Shapiro|first2 = Kirk Warren|last2 = Brown|first3 = Gina M.|last3 = Biegel|pages=105–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy seeks to increase the capacity for mindfulness, by reducing the need for self-focused thoughts and emotions that can lead to poor mental health.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The exercise of mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy brings together the elements of meditation and yoga, greater awareness of the unity of mind and body, as well as the ways that the unconscious thoughts, feelings, and behaviors can undermine emotional, physical, and [[spirituality|spiritual]] health.&lt;ref&gt;Mindfullivingprograms.com,.

(2005) found that health care professionals who underwent a MBSR program reported significantly increased self-compassion and reduced stress levels compared to the waitlist control group. It was also reported that the increase of self-compassion appeared to reduce stress associated with the program.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy ===
[[Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy]] (MBCT) is an intervention therapy that combines meditation practices, psycho-education and cognitive behavioral strategies to prevent the relapse or recurrence of [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Segal, Z., Williams, J., &amp; Teasdale, J. (2009). ''Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for depression'' (pp. 307-312). New York, 	NY: Guilford Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; MBCT teaches individuals how to observe their thoughts and feelings by focusing their attention on natural objects, such as breathing and bodily sensations. Individuals are taught how to achieve awareness while holding an attitude of non-judgemental acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Treatment-resistant Depressed Patients Show a Good Response to Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy|journal = FOCUS|date = 2010-01-01|issn = 1541-4094|pages = 120–126|volume = 8|issue = 1|doi = 10.1176/foc.8.1.foc120|pmid = 16797486|pmc = 2808477|first = M.a.|last = Kenny|first2 = J.m.g.|last2 = Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within MBCT, mindfulness skills are taught in order to recognize distressing thoughts and feelings, to be aware of these experiences, and utilize acceptance and self-compassion to break up associative networks that may causes a relapse. Self-compassion in response to negative thoughts and feelings is an adaptive process, which validates it as a key learning skill in MBCT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = How does mindfulness-based cognitive therapy work?|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0005796710001774|journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy|date = 2010-01-01|volume = 48|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/j.brat.2010.08.003|pmid = 20810101|first = Willem|last = Kuyken|first2 = Ed|last2 = Watkins|first3 = Emily|last3 = Holden|first4 = Kat|last4 = White|first5 = Rod S.|last5 = Taylor|first6 = Sarah|last6 = Byford|first7 = Alison|last7 = Evans|first8 = Sholto|last8 = Radford|first9 = John D.|last9 = Teasdale|pages=1105–1112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-compassion has been found to be a key mechanism in the effectiveness of mindfulness-based interventions such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Kuyken et al. (2010) compared the effect of MBCT with maintenance antidepressants on relapse in depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They found that mindfulness and self-compassion were increased after MBCT was introduced. They also found that MBCT reduced the connection of cognitive reactivity and depressive relapse, and that the increased self-compassion helped mediate this association.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Mindful self-compassion therapy ===
Mindful self-compassion (MSC) therapy is a hybrid therapy consisting of self-compassion and mindfulness practices.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The term mindful is referred to in the MSC program as the basic mindfulness skills which is turning toward painful thoughts and emotions and seeing them as they are without suppression or avoidance which is crucial to the development of self-compassion.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The MSC program however focuses more on self-compassion and sees mindfulness as a secondary emphasis.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; MSC teaches both formal (meditation) and informal (daily life) self-compassion practices. In addition there are homework MSC assignments that teaches participants to be kinder to themselves.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The goal of MSC therapy is to provide participants with a variety of tools to increase self-compassion which they can then in turn integrate into their lives.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; A study conducted by Neff and Germer (2012) found that compared with the control group, MSC intervention participants reported significantly larger increases in self-compassion, mindfulness, wellbeing and a decrease in depression, stress and anxiety which were maintained for 6 months after the initial intervention.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

===Compassion focused therapy ===

===Mindfulness skills in dialectical behavior therapy ===
[[Dialectical behavior therapy]] (DBT), is a derivative of [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavior therapy]] that incorporates Eastern meditative practice.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mechanisms of change in dialectical behavior therapy: Theoretical and empirical observations|journal = Journal of Clinical Psychology|date = 2006-01-01|volume = 62|issue = 4|doi = 10.1002/jclp.20243|pmid = 16470714|first = Thomas R.|last = Lynch|first2 = Alexander L.|last2 = Chapman|first3 = M.

We accept ourselves as good enough, and we recognize the need for all of us to change and grow.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; Unlike MBCT and MBSR therapies, dialectical behavior therapy does not use meditation but less formal exercises, such as individual therapy sessions and group skill sessions.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In general last for approximately a year where participants will engage in weekly individual skill therapy sessions and group skill sessions.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;Baer, R. (2006). ''Mindfulness-based treatment approaches''. Amsterdam: Elsevier, Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The skills therapy sessions include four segments; core [[mindfulness]], interpersonal effectiveness, [[Emotional self-regulation|emotion regulation]], and [[distress tolerance]] skills.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Dialectical behaviour therapist recommend developing self-compassion. The basic premise of using self-compassion therapies in DBT is to cultivate a compassionate mind state, defined by feelings of warmth, safety, presence and interconnectedness that can in turn relieve [[emotional dysregulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does Self-Compassion Mitigate the Association Between Childhood Maltreatment and Later Emotion Regulation Difficulties?

===Mindfulness and related skills in acceptance and commitment therapy ===
[[Acceptance and commitment therapy]] utilizes behavior change process, mindfulness and acceptance process. ACT, involves non-judgmental awareness and openness to cognitive sensation an emotional experiences.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; It also promotes exposure to previously avoided situations that have caused anxiety in order to promote acceptance. The avoidant behavior is treated by having clients observing their thoughts and accepting that their thoughts are not necessarily harmful.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; In general ACT strategies are customized to fit each participant so they obtain psycho-education, [[problem solving]] skills and [[psychological flexibility]]. Mindfulness and acceptance exercises skills facilitates the behavioral changes necessary for its user to pursue a life that they feel is vital and meaningful.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Various sources have indicated that acceptance and commitment therapy overlaps with Neff's conceptualization of self compassion particularly the ACT's relational frame theory. The basic theories and concepts underlining ACT, may be relevant and have shown to be parallels and hold similarities found in self-compassion&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Using acceptance and commitment therapy to increase self-compassion: A randomized controlled trial|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2212144714000763|journal = Journal of Contextual Behavioral Science|date = 2014-01-01|pmc = 4260406|pmid = 25506545|volume = 3|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/j.jcbs.2014.09.002|first = James E.|last = Yadavaia|first2 = Steven C.|last2 = Hayes|first3 = Roger|last3 = Vilardaga|pages=248–257}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first is ACT perspective and Neff's concept of self-kindness are both linked to self-acceptance. Acceptance of one's painful experiences and hurt is related to kindness to one's self.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; Second Neff's conceptualization of self-compassion and ACT both emphasize mindfulness, which is practiced ACT through the concepts of defusion, acceptance, contact with the present moment and the self as a context. Defusion is also used in self-compassion as a means of allowing self-criticisms to pass through the mind with believing, proving them wrong or engaging stance to make these thoughts workable.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; In a study conducted by Yadavaia, Hayes &amp; Vilardaga, 2014 test the efficacy of an ACT approach to self-compassion as compared to a waitlist control, the study showed that ACT interventions led to a large increase in self-compassion and psychopathology compared to the waitlist control at post-treatment and two months post intervention.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

{{Platonism}}
The '''Ship of State''' is a famous and oft-cited [[metaphor]] put forth by [[Plato]] in Book VI of the ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' (488a–489d).  It likens the [[governance]] of a [[city-state]] to the command of a naval vessel and ultimately argues that the only men fit to be [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of this [[ship]] ({{lang-grc-gre|ναῦς}}) are [[philosopher king]]s, benevolent men with absolute power who have access to [[the Form of the Good]]. The origins of the metaphor can be traced back to the lyric poet [[Alcaeus of Mytilene|Alcaeus]] (frs. 6, 208, 249), and it is found in [[Sophocles]]’ [[Antigone]] and [[Aeschylus]]' [[Seven Against Thebes]] before Plato.

==Plato's use of the metaphor==
Plato establishes the comparison by saying that [[God]] was one of the best models of describing the steering of a ship as just like any other "craft" or [[profession]] — in particular, that of a [[Politician|statesman]].  He then runs the metaphor in reference to a particular type of government: [[democracy]].  Plato’s democracy is not the modern notion of a mix of democracy and [[republic]]anism, but rather direct democracy by way of pure majority rule.  In the metaphor, found at 488a-489d, Plato's Socrates compares the population at large to a strong but nearsighted shipowner whose knowledge of seafaring is lacking. The quarreling sailors are demagogues and politicians, and the ship's navigator, a stargazer, is the philosopher. The sailors flatter themselves with claims to knowledge of sailing, though they know nothing of navigation, and are constantly vying with one another for the approval of the shipowner so to captain the ship, going so far as to stupefy the shipowner with drugs and wine. Meanwhile, they dismiss the navigator as a useless stargazer, though he is the only one with adequate knowledge to direct the ship's course.

==The Ship of State since Plato==
It has been routinely referenced throughout [[Western culture]] ever since its inception; two notable literary examples are [[Horace|Horace's]] [[Odes (Horace)|ode]] 1.14 and "[[O Ship of State]]" by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]. [[Roger Williams]], the founder of Rhode Island, used the metaphor in his Letter to the Town of Providence (1656).

More recently, it has become a staple of American political discussion, where it is viewed simply as its image of the state as a ship, in need of a government as officers to command it – and conspicuously absent of its anti-democratic, pro-[[Autocracy|absolutist]] original meaning.

The term has entered popular culture as well. [[Leonard cohen|Leonard Cohen]]'s song "Democracy" contains the line "Sail on. Sail on, o mighty ship of state. To the shores of need, past the reefs of greed, through the squalls of hate." Also, in his second novel 'Beautiful Losers' (1966) Cohen writes "Sail on, sail on, O Ship of State, auto accidents, births, Berlin, cures for cancer!" (p.&amp;nbsp;12). In the British TV series [[Yes, Minister]], [[Sir Humphrey|Sir Humphrey Appleby]] pointed out that "the Ship of State is the only ship that leaks from the top".&lt;ref&gt;Season 3, episode 5 ("The Bed of Nails") at ca 25:33 mins&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actual ocean liners===
Beyond the political metaphor, in the 20th century "Ship of State" became a term applied to [[ocean liner]]s which were built to be floating symbols of a state's artistic and technological advancement; normally [[flagship]]s of the country's most successful passenger shipping line, and the construction of which was often subsidised by the state government.  Examples of liners considered Ships of State are the [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']] ([[United Kingdom]]), [[SS Normandie|SS ''Normandie'']] ([[France]]), [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']] ([[Italy]]), [[SS France (1961)|SS ''France'']] (France), [[RMS Queen Mary 2|RMS ''Queen Mary 2'']] (United Kingdom), and [[SS United States|SS ''United States'']] ([[United States]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11497">In [[United States|American]] [[jurisprudence]], a '''suspect classification''' is any classification of groups meeting a series of criteria suggesting they are likely the subject of discrimination. These classes receive closer scrutiny by courts when an [[Equal Protection Clause|Equal Protection]] claim alleging [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] discrimination is asserted against a law, regulation, or other government action, or sometimes private action.

== Federal classifications ==
[[Strict scrutiny]] is applied to government actions that affect groups that fall under a "suspect classification." The US Supreme Court has mentioned a variety of criteria that, in some combination, may qualify a group as a suspect classification, but the Court has not declared that any particular set of criteria are either necessary or sufficient to qualify.&lt;ref name="Wintemute"&gt;Wintemute, Robert, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JcFhzZiPF2YC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22criteria+for+identifying+suspect+classifications%22&amp;ei=rbVkS72tA5X6Ndm15dcN&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22criteria%20for%20identifying%20suspect%20classifications%22&amp;f=false Sexual Orientation and Human Rights]'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the criteria that have been cited include:
* The group has historically been discriminated against or have been subject to prejudice, hostility, or stigma, perhaps due, at least in part, to stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Wintemute" /&gt;
* They possess an [[wikt:immutable|immutable]]&lt;ref name="Lyng"&gt;''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=477&amp;invol=635 Lyng v. Castillo]'' (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; or highly visible trait.
* They are powerless&lt;ref name="Lyng" /&gt; to protect themselves via the political process. (The group is a "discrete" and "insular" minority.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''[[US v. Carolene Products Co.#Text of Footnote Four|U.S. v. Carolene Products]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;)
* The group's distinguishing characteristic does not inhibit it from contributing meaningfully to society.&lt;ref&gt;See: ''[[Frontiero v. Richardson]] 411 U.S. 677, 686 (1973)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suspect class ===
The Supreme Court  established the judicial precedent for suspect classifications in the cases of ''[[Hirabayashi v. United States]]'', 320 U.S. 81 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Hirabayashi v. United States |vol=320 |reporter= U.S. |opinion= |pinpoint= 81|court= United States Supreme Court=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'', 323 U.S. 214 (1944).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = Korematsu v. United States|vol=323 |reporter= U.S. |opinion= |pinpoint= 214|court= United States Supreme Court=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court recognizes [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[national origin]], [[religion]] and alienage as suspect classes; it therefore analyzes any government action that discriminates against these classes under [[strict scrutiny]].

In ''[[Perry v. Schwarzenegger]]'', the [[U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California]] in its Findings of Fact commented  that [[sexual orientation]] could be considered a suspect class but, on the facts presented Proposition 8 failed even to satisfy the much more deferential rational basis review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= Perry v. Schwarzenegger|vol= |reporter= |opinion= |pinpoint=122 |court=United States District Court for the Northern District of California|date=2010-08-05|url=http://www.sfgate.com/chronicle/acrobat/2010/08/04/Prop-8-Ruling-FINAL.pdf|quote= The trial record shows that strict scrutiny is the appropriate standard of review to apply to legislative classifications based on sexual orientation. All classifications based on sexual orientation appear suspect, as the evidence shows that California would rarely, if ever, have a reason to categorize individuals based on their sexual orientation.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. District Court for the District of Nebraska]] held the same in ''[[Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://ads.omaha.com/media/maps/pdfs/0512initiative.pdf ''Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning'', 368 F. Supp. 2d 980 (D.Neb. 2005)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714235759/http://ads.omaha.com/media/maps/pdfs/0512initiative.pdf |date=2011-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was reversed on appeal by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/06/07/052604P.pdf ''Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning'', 455 F.3d 859 (8th Cir. 2006)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213233153/http://www.ca8.uscourts.gov/opndir/06/07/052604P.pdf |date=2011-12-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the law currently stands, neither sexual orientation nor gender identity is considered a federal suspect class, although many states do consider them such. 

==== Alienage ====
[[Alienage]], or the state of being an alien, i.e. a non-citizen of the United States, is a unique category. For purposes of [[U.S. state|state]] law, [[alien (law)|legal aliens]] are a suspect class (''[[Graham v. Richardson]]'', 403 U.S. 365 (1971)). As such, state actions are analyzed according to strict scrutiny. In contrast, because the [[United States Congress]] has the power to regulate [[immigration]], [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] government action that discriminates based on alienage will receive [[rational basis scrutiny]]. State acts that affect [[alien (law)|unlawful immigrants]] are generally analyzed with rational basis review unless the topic is education of children, in which case they are analyzed under intermediate scrutiny based on ''[[Plyler v. Doe]]'', 457 U.S. 202 (1982).

=== Quasi-suspect class ===
[[Intermediate scrutiny]] is applied to groups that fall under a "quasi-suspect classification." Gender&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan|Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan]]'', 458 U.S. 718 (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimacy of birth]] have been held to be quasi-suspect classes. In 2012, the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of California|U.S. District Court for 
Northern California]] discussed this type of classification, but applied heightened scrutiny without specifically labeling gays and lesbians a suspect or quasi-suspect class in its decision.&lt;ref&gt;''Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management'', C 10-00257 (N.D. Cal. 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Striking down Section 3 of [[Defense of Marriage Act|DOMA]] as unconstitutional in ''[[Windsor v. United States]]'' (2012), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|2nd Circuit Court of Appeals]] held sexual orientation to be a quasi-suspect classification, and determined that laws that classify people on such basis should be subject to intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca2.uscourts.gov/decisions/isysquery/1afe4f62-fbf9-4e0d-a409-26ab7396971e/1/doc/12-2335_complete_opn.pdf ''Windsor v. United States''], 12-2335-cv(L), October 18, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time a federal court had applied quasi-suspect classification in a sexual orientation case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kemp|first=David|title=The End of an Unjust Law: The Second Circuit Strikes Down DOMA and Sets the Stage for Supreme Court Review|url=http://verdict.justia.com/2012/10/22/the-end-of-an-unjust-law|publisher=Justia|date=October 22, 2012|accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court however has not decided whether sexual orientation fits into any identified class.

=== All others ===

[[Rational basis review|Rational basis scrutiny]] is applied to all other discriminatory statutes. Rational basis scrutiny currently covers all other discriminatory criteria—''e.g.'', [[Ageing|age]], [[disability]], wealth, political preference, political affiliation, or felons.

== Levels of judicial review ==

=== Strict scrutiny ===
To satisfy the strict scrutiny, suspect classifications such as race, alienage, or national origin must be necessary to promote a compelling state interest when there is no less restrictive alternative method available to accomplish the government (state's) interest.

The practical result of this legal doctrine is that government sponsored discrimination on the account of a citizen's [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], skin [[color]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], or [[Nationality|national]] origin is almost always unconstitutional, unless it is a compelling, narrowly tailored and temporary piece of legislation dealing with [[national security]], defense, or [[affirmative action]]. ''[[Korematsu v. United States]]'', regarding Japanese internment, and ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', upholding affirmative action based upon racial diversity, are the only cases in which a racially discriminatory law has been upheld under the strict scrutiny test.

Strict scrutiny is also applied to restrictions of any [[fundamental right]], regardless of the group involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Souter, David|first=US Supreme Court Justice|title=Vacco v. Quill - 521 U.S. 793 (1997)|url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/521/793/case|work=Justia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intermediate scrutiny ===
When [[intermediate scrutiny]] is involved, the courts are more likely to oppose the discriminatory law when compared to a rational basis review particularly if a law is based on gender. However, a court will likely uphold a discriminatory law under intermediate scrutiny if the law has an exceedingly persuasive justification and applies to real, fact-based, or biological differences between the sexes. [[Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan]], 102 S.Ct. 3331 (1982), [[Nguyen v. INS]], 121 S.Ct. 2053 (2001).

=== Rational basis ===
When [[rational basis review]] is used, it means that the classification is one that overwhelmingly tends to be rational, e.g. distinguishing criminals from non-criminals. This leads to wide political discretion and a focus of judicial resources to other cases where the classification employed tends to be more suspicious, and thus close judicial balancing is needed.

== Classifications under state law ==
The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] holdings impose a minimum standard to which each [[U.S. state|State]] must adhere. Hence, a State law that discriminates against citizens because of their race, must be reviewed by the applicable State and inferior [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] using the strict scrutiny basis of review. A State may, generally, choose to give its citizens more rights or protections than the minimum [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] standard when considering state law. For example, in 2008 the [[Supreme Court of California]] used the strict scrutiny basis of review to strike down a [[California]] statute denying legal recognition of same-sex marriages.

[[California]] classifies sexual orientation as a suspect class under state law. [[Connecticut]] and [[Iowa]] classify sexual orientation as a quasi-suspect class under their respective state laws.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, Chuck, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IwNhIK9Fn1sC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;lpg=PA185&amp;dq=sexual+orientation+and+suspect+class&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qvlLLVJ3VE&amp;sig=LpvcmKqGjXX4N4YyC-YdTxy4GwY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=OmZmSqLcEJGKMpDG7aEB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6 Homosexuality and the Law: A Dictionary]'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thermoeconomics''', also referred to as '''biophysical economics''', is a school of [[heterodox economics]] that applies the [[laws of thermodynamics|laws of statistical mechanics]] to economic theory.&lt;ref name="Sieniutycz" &gt;{{cite book | last = Sieniutycz | first = Stanislaw |author2=Salamon, Peter  | title = Finite-Time Thermodynamics and Thermoeconomics | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-8448-1668-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thermoeconomics can be thought of as the [[statistical physics]] of [[value theory|economic value]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chen | first = Jing | title = The Physical Foundation of Economics - an Analytical Thermodynamic Theory | publisher = [[World Scientific]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 981-256-323-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a subfield of [[econophysics]].

Thermoeconomists maintain that human [[economic system]]s can be modeled as [[thermodynamic system]]s.  Thermoeconomists argue that economic systems always involve [[matter]], [[energy]], [[entropy]], and [[information]].&lt;ref name="Baumarter"&gt;Baumgarter, Stefan. (2004).

Moreover, many economic activities result in the formation of [[class structure|structures]].  Thermoeconomics applies the statistical mechanics of [[non-equilibrium thermodynamics]] to model these activities.&lt;ref name="Sieniutycz" /&gt;  In thermodynamic terminology, human economic activity may be described as a [[dissipative structures|dissipative system]], which flourishes by consuming free energy in transformations and exchange of resources, goods, and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Application to Biology==
Thermoeconomics is based on the proposition that the role of [[energy]] in [[biological evolution]] should be defined and understood not through the [[second law of thermodynamics]] but in terms of such economic criteria as [[productivity]], [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], and especially the costs and benefits (or profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2302">In the area of [[mathematical logic]] and [[computer science]] known as [[type theory]], a '''type constructor''' is a feature of a typed [[formal language]] that builds new types from old ones. [[Basic type]]s are considered to be built using [[nullary]] type constructors. Some type constructors take another type as an argument, e.g., the constructors for [[product type]]s, [[function type]]s&lt;!-- needs writing --&gt;, power types and [[list type]]s&lt;!-- ibid --&gt;. New types can be defined by recursively composing type constructors.

For example, [[simply typed lambda calculus]] can be seen as a language with a single type constructor&amp;mdash;the function type constructor. Product types can generally be considered "built-in" in [[Typed lambda calculus|typed lambda calculi]] via [[currying]].

Abstractly, a type constructor is an ''n''-ary '''type operator''' taking as argument zero or more types, and returning another type. Making use of currying, ''n''-ary type operators can be (re)written as a sequence of applications of unary type operators. Therefore, we can view the type operators as a simply typed lambda calculus, which has only one basic type, usually denoted &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;, and pronounced "type", which is the type of all types in the underlying language, which are now called ''proper types'' in order to distinguish them from the types of the type operators in their own calculus, which are called ''[[Kind (type theory)|kind]]s''.

Instituting a simply typed lambda calculus over the type operators results in more than just a formalization of type constructors though. Higher-order type operators become possible. Type operators correspond to the 2nd axis in the [[lambda cube]], leading to the simply typed lambda-calculus with type operators, λ&lt;sub&gt;ω&lt;/sub&gt;; while this is not so well known, combining type operators with polymorphic lambda calculus ([[system F]]) yields [[system F-omega]].

[[File:Viète's formula.png|thumb|360px|Viète's formula, as printed in Viète's ''Variorum de rebus mathematicis responsorum, liber VIII'' (1593)]]
In [[mathematics]], '''Viète's formula''' is the following [[infinite product]] of [[nested radical]]s representing the mathematical constant [[pi|{{pi}}]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac2\pi = \frac{\sqrt 2}2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2+\sqrt 2}}2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt 2}}}2 \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
It is named after [[François Viète]] (1540–1603), who published it in 1593 in his work ''Variorum de rebus mathematicis responsorum, liber VIII''.&lt;ref name="beckmann"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Beckmann | first1=Petr | author1-link=Petr Beckmann | title=A history of {{pi}} | publisher=The Golem Press |location=Boulder, CO | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-88029-418-8 | mr = 0449960 | year=1971 | pages = 94–95 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=XqqUUSyz138C&amp;pg=PA94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
At the time Viète published his formula, methods for [[approximations of pi|approximating {{pi}}]] to (in principle) arbitrary accuracy had long been known. Viète's own method can be interpreted as a variation of an idea of [[Archimedes]] of approximating the length of a circle by the perimeter of a many-sided polygon,&lt;ref name="beckmann"/&gt; used by Archimedes to find the approximation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{223}{71} &lt; \pi &lt; \frac{22}{7}.&lt;/math&gt;
However, by publishing his method as a mathematical formula, Viète formulated the first instance of an infinite product known in mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Maths for the Mystified: An Exploration of the History of Mathematics and Its Relationship to Modern-day Science and Computing|first=Michael J.|last=De Smith|publisher=Troubador Publishing Ltd|year=2006|isbn=9781905237814|page=165|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HlOVuklrQPAC&amp;pg=PA165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Using his formula, Viète calculated {{pi}} to an accuracy of nine [[decimal digit]]s.&lt;ref name="kreminski"/&gt; However, this was not the most accurate approximation to {{pi}} known at the time, as the [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Persian mathematician]] [[Jamshīd al-Kāshī]] had calculated {{pi}} to an accuracy of nine [[sexagesimal]] digits and 16 decimal digits in 1424.&lt;ref name="borwein"/&gt; Not long after Viète published his formula, [[Ludolph van Ceulen]] used a closely related method to calculate 35 digits of {{pi}}, which were published only after van Ceulen's death in 1610.&lt;ref name="borwein"/&gt;

==Interpretation and convergence==
Viète's formula may be rewritten and understood as a [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] expression
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \prod_{i=1}^n \frac{a_i}{2} = \frac2\pi&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{radic|2 + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}, with initial condition {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} {{radic|2}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Number {{pi}}|first1=Pierre|last1=Eymard|first2=Jean Pierre|last2=Lafon|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2004|isbn=9780821832462|contribution=2.1 Viète's infinite product|pages=44–46|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qZcCSskdtwcC&amp;pg=PA44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viète did his work long before the concepts of limits and rigorous proofs of convergence were developed in mathematics; the first proof that this limit exists was not given until the work of [[Ferdinand Rudio]] in 1891.&lt;ref name="beckmann"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=F.|last=Rudio|authorlink=Ferdinand Rudio|title=Über die Konvergenz einer von Vieta herrührenden eigentümlichen Produktentwicklung|journal=Z. Math. Phys.|volume=36|year=1891|pages=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{comparison_pi_infinite_series.svg|400px|Viète's formula ({{red|'''×'''}}) and}}

The [[rate of convergence]] of a limit governs the number of terms of the expression needed to achieve a given number of digits of accuracy. In the case of Viète's formula, there is a linear relation between the number of terms and the number of digits: the product of the first {{mvar|n}} terms in the limit gives an expression for {{pi}} that is accurate to approximately {{math|0.6''n''}} digits.&lt;ref name="kreminski"&gt;{{cite journal|title={{pi}} to Thousands of Digits from Vieta's Formula|first=Rick|last=Kreminski|journal=[[Mathematics Magazine]]|pages=201–207|volume=81|issue=3|year=2008|jstor= 27643107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A simple geometric method of estimating the error in using Vieta's product for {{pi}}|first=T. J.|last=Osler|journal=International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology|volume=38|issue=1|year=2007|pages=136–142|doi=10.1080/00207390601002799}}&lt;/ref&gt; This convergence rate compares very favorably with the [[Wallis product]], a later infinite product formula for {{pi}}. Although Viète himself only used his formula to calculate {{pi}} with nine-digit accuracy, an [[Series acceleration|accelerated]] version of his formula has been used to calculate {{pi}} to hundreds of thousands of digits.&lt;ref name="kreminski"/&gt;

==Related formulas==
Viète's formula may be obtained as a special case of a formula given more than a century later by [[Leonhard Euler]], who discovered that:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin x}{x} = \cos\frac{x}{2} \cdot \cos\frac{x}{4} \cdot \cos\frac{x}{8} \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
Substituting &lt;math&gt;x = \frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; in this formula yields:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2}{\pi} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} \cdot \cos\frac{\pi}{8} \cdot \cos\frac{\pi}{16} \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
Then, expressing each term of the product on the right as a function of earlier terms using the half-angle formula:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\frac{x}{2} = \sqrt\frac{1+\cos x}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
gives Viète's formula.&lt;ref name="beckmann"/&gt;

It is also possible to derive from Viète's formula a related formula for {{pi}} that still involves nested square roots of two, but uses only one multiplication:&lt;ref name="servi"&gt;{{cite journal

By now many formulas similar to Viète's involving either nested radicals or infinite products of trigonometric functions are known for {{pi}}, as well as for other constants such as the [[golden ratio]].&lt;ref name="servi"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Derivation==
[[File:Viète nested polygons.svg|thumb|300px|A sequence of [[regular polygon]]s with numbers of sides equal to [[power of two|powers of two]], inscribed in a circle. The ratios between areas or perimeters of consecutive polygons in the sequence give the terms of Viète's formula.]]
Viète obtained his formula by comparing the [[area]]s of [[regular polygon]]s with {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;}} sides inscribed in a [[circle]].&lt;ref name="beckmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maor"/&gt; The first term in the product, {{sfrac|{{radic|2}}|2}}, is the ratio of areas of a square and an [[octagon]], the second term is the ratio of areas of an octagon and a [[hexadecagon]], etc. Thus, the product [[Telescoping series|telescopes]] to give the ratio of areas of a square (the initial polygon in the sequence) to a circle (the limiting case of a {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}-gon). Alternatively, the terms in the product may be instead interpreted as ratios of [[perimeter]]s of the same sequence of polygons, starting with the ratio of perimeters of a [[digon]] (the diameter of the circle, counted twice) and a square, the ratio of perimeters of a square and an octagon, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Rummler | first = Hansklaus | doi = 10.2307/2324662 | issue = 9 | journal = [[The American Mathematical Monthly]] | mr = 1247533 | pages = 858–860 | title = Squaring the circle with holes | volume = 100 | year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another derivation is possible based on [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]] and Euler's formula.
By repeatedly applying the  [[List of trigonometric identities#Double-angle, triple-angle, and half-angle formulae|double-angle formula]]
:&lt;math&gt;\sin x = 2\sin\frac{x}{2}\cos\frac{x}{2},&lt;/math&gt;
one may prove by [[mathematical induction]] that, for all positive integers {{mvar|n}},
:&lt;math&gt;\sin x = 2^n \sin\frac{x}{2^n}\left(\prod_{i=1}^n \cos\frac{x}{2^i}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The term {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; sin {{sfrac|''x''|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} goes to {{mvar|x}} in the limit as {{mvar|n}} goes to infinity, from which Euler's formula follows. Viète's formula may be obtained from this formula by the substitution {{math|''x'' {{=}} {{sfrac|π|2}}}}.&lt;ref name="morrison"/&gt;

The summit was created in response to the United Nations' inclusion of countries that commit particularly atrocious human rights abuses, especially in the [[United Nations Human Rights Council|Human Rights Council]], such as [[China]], [[Syria]], [[Sudan]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[North Korea]], and [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="We Have a Dream" Global Summit against Discrimination and Persecution|url=http://uhrp.org/featured-articles/we-have-dream-global-summit-against-discrimination-and-persecution|work=Uyghur Human Rights Project|accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=25 rights groups to hold victim summit in parallel to Durban III|url=http://blog.unwatch.org/index.php/2011/06/13/25-rights-groups-to-hold-victim-summit-in-parallel-to-durban-iii/|work=UN Watch|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This claim has been supported by the [[Human Rights Foundation]], a partner of the summit, whose President, [[Thor Halvorssen (human rights activist)|Thor Halvorssen]], refers to Durban III as “the last act in a tragicomedy” that underscores the UN’s complacency with “despotic regimes which speak pretty words about human rights while they kill, torture, or jail their opponents”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HRF’s Response to Durban III: Partnership with "We Have A Dream" Global Summit|url=http://www.humanrightsfoundation.org/media/HRFResponsetoDurbanIII09212011.html|work=The Human Rights Foundation|accessdate=March 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
