{{Voting}}

An '''absentee ballot''' is a [[vote]] cast by someone who is unable or unwilling to attend the official [[polling station]] to which the voter is normally allocated. Numerous methods have been devised to facilitate this. Increasing the ease of access to absentee ballots is seen by many as one way to improve [[voter turnout]], though some countries require that a valid reason, such as infirmity or travel, be given before a voter can participate in an absentee ballot.

==Methods==
===Voting at a different polling station===
Among countries where voters are allocated to one or several specific polling station(s) (such as the polling station closest to the voter's residential address, or polling stations within a particular district, province or state), some countries provide a mechanism by which voters can nevertheless cast their ballots on election day at a different polling station.

The reasons for allocating voters to specific polling stations are generally logistical. Absentee voting at a different polling station might be catered for by, for example, designating some larger polling stations as available for absentee voting, and equipping such polling stations with the ballot papers (or the means to produce ballot papers) applicable to an absentee voter.

In the electoral terminology of some countries, such as [[Australia]], "absentee voting" means specifically a vote cast at a different polling station to one to which the voter has been allocated. "Early voting", "proxy voting" or "postal voting" are separate concepts in these countries.

===Postal voting===
In a [[postal vote]], the ballot papers are posted out to the voter – usually only on request – who must then fill them out and return them, often with some form of certification by a witness and their signature to prove their identity.

===Proxy voting===
To cast a proxy vote, the user appoints someone as their ''[[Proxy voting|proxy]]'', by authorizing them to cast or secure their vote in their stead. The proxy must be trusted by the voter, as in a [[secret ballot]] there is no way of verifying that they voted for the correct candidate. In an attempt to solve this, it is not uncommon for people to nominate an official of their chosen party as their proxy.

===Internet voting===
{{Main|Electronic voting#Public network DRE_voting_system|l1=Internet voting}}
Corporations sometimes use Internet voting in shareholder elections (i.e., "at annual or special meetings for members of the board of directors, and on certain issues relating to the organization or governance of the company.").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/files/sec-guide-to-proxy-brochures.pdf Exercise your Shareholder Voting Rights in Corporate Elections], U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, SEC Pub. No. 028 (4/10).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[French legislative election, 2012|2012]], French citizens living abroad were permitted to cast vote electronically in French parliamentary elections (but not in presidential elections). In 2017, however, the system was dropped after the French [[Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d'information|National Cybersecurity Agency]] assessed an "extremely high risk" of cyberattacks in the wake of [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-election-cyber-idUSKBN16D233 France drops electronic voting for citizens abroad over cybersecurity fears], Reuters (March 6, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, electronic voting was banned in the Netherlands in 2007, and in 2017 Dutch authorities also abandoned electronic vote counting, conducting an all-paper, all-manual vote count in an effort to block foreign interference in its elections.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Lowe, [http://www.newsweek.com/dutch-election-electronic-voting-hacking-russia-france-macron-trump-clinton-564198 Netherlands Abandons Electronic Vote Counting Amid Hacking Fears], ''Newsweek'' (March 6, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Switzerland, six [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] are conducting an electronic voting pilot program. In three cantons, Swiss voters resident abroad may vote electronically; in the [[Geneva Canton|cantons of Geneva]] and [[Canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]], "some of the electorate living in the canton" may also vote electronically. Since June 2016, in the canton of [[Basel Stadt]], both Swiss voters resident abroad and persons with disabilities living within the canton may vote using an electronic system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.egovernment.ch/en/umsetzung/schwerpunktplan/vote-electronique/ Electronic voting], Swiss Confederation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, [[Estonia]] has allowed voters to cast votes via the Internet (encrypted to protect voter anonymity); 2% of Estonians cast ballots via the Internet initially, and 25% did so in 2011.&lt;ref name="Plumer"&gt;Brad Plumer, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2012/11/06/estonians-get-to-vote-online-why-cant-america/ Estonia gets to vote online. Why can’t America?], ''Washington Post'' (November 6, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The Estonian Internet-voting system uses the [[Estonian ID card|Estonian national identity card]], which is associated with a PINs unique to each voter: "all Estonians are issued a government ID with a scannable chip and a PIN number that gives them a unique online identity — they can use this identity to file their taxes or pay library fines or buy bus passes."&lt;ref name="Plumer"/&gt;

Texas law allows American astronauts who cannot vote in person and are unable to vote via absentee ballot such as those aboard the [[International Space Station]] and [[Mir]] space station cast their ballots electronically, via email, from orbit since 1997. Ballots are sent via secure email to the [[Johnson Spaceflight Center]] and then passed on to the astronauts' home counties in Texas. The first American to cast a ballot from space was astronaut [[David Wolf (astronaut)|David Wolf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Astronauts beam votes home|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/02/astronauts-beam-votes-home/|publisher=CNN|date=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Absentee ballot examples==
===Australia===
In Australia the term "absentee ballot" refers specifically to the procedure used when a voter attends a voting place which is not in the electoral district in which they are registered to vote.  Instead of marking the ballot paper and putting it in the ballot box,  the voter's ballot paper is placed in an envelope and then it is sent by the voting official to the voter's home district to be counted there.

Postal voting and early voting are separate procedures also available to voters who would not be in their registered electoral districts on a voting day.

===Germany===
In all&lt;!-- ? maybe. --&gt; [[Germany|German]] elections, [[postal vote]]s are available on demand. The requirement for an excuse has been removed in 2008 for elections on the federal level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wahlrecht.de/news/2008/20.htm wahlrecht.de: Briefwahl nun ohne Hinderungsgrund möglich] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
{{Main|Elections_in_India#Absentee_voting|l1=Absentee voting in India}}
As of now, India does not have an absentee ballot system for all citizens. In a restricted sense, The Representation of the People Act-1950&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulbarga.nic.in/karelections2008/ACTS/RPAct1950.pdf Representation of the People Act-1950] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226073956/http://gulbarga.nic.in/karelections2008/ACTS/RPAct1950.pdf |date=2009-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (RPA) section 20(8) allows people such as people on polling duty and serving in armed forces, and Head of state like President to vote in absentia through postal means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2004-04-05/news/27397034_1_ballot-papers-special-voters-electoral-roll|title=Who can vote by postal ballot?|work=timesofindia-economictimes|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-election-commission-to-ensure-postal-votes-dont-get-invalid-1914891|title=Election Commission to ensure postal votes don't get invalid|date=7 November 2013|work=dna|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/new-delhi/pranab-to-become-first-prez-tocast-vote-via-postal-ballot-lse-1438680.html|title=Pranab to become first president to cast vote via postal ballot|work=www.oneindia.com|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 20 of the RPA-1950 disqualifies a non-resident Indian (NRI) from getting his/her name registered in the electoral rolls. Consequently, it also prevents an NRI from casting his/her vote in elections to the Parliament and to the State Legislatures. In August 2010, Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill-2010 which allows voting rights to NRI's was passed in both Lok Sabha with subsequent gazette notifications on Nov 24, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article910849.ece|title=Govt. issues notification for NRI voting rights|author=PTI|work=The Hindu|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this NRI's will now be able to vote in Indian elections but have to be  ''physically present'' at the time of voting. Recently several civic society organizations have urged the government to amend the RPA act to allow NRI's and people on the move to cast their vote through absentee ballot system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://voterswithoutborders.org/ Petition for Absentee Voting in Indian Elections] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416234322/http://voterswithoutborders.org/ |date=April 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tanushreebagrodia.blogspot.com/2008/12/nri-voting-rights-and-upcoming.html|title=THE CITY OF BRIDGES|publisher=|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrivotingrights.info/|title=Welcome nrivotingrights.info - Hostmonster.com|publisher=|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republic of Ireland===
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], [[postal votes]] are used in [[Seanad Éireann]] elections for the [[university constituencies]] and the [[vocational panel]]s, both of which have restricted franchises. Otherwise, postal voting is only available in a restricted set of circumstances. The [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]] requires a secret ballot and the courts have interpreted this quite narrowly. Postal votes are available to people who by reason of their occupation cannot vote normally. They are also available to students living away from home, to people with disabilities, to prisoners (since January 2007), and to long term residents of hospitals, nursing homes and other similar institutions.

===Israel===
[[Israel]] does not have an absentee ballot system for all citizens. Absentee ballots are restricted to soldiers, prisoners, sailors, overseas diplomats, disabled persons and hospitalized people. The votes are not cast directly but placed in a double envelope with identifying information and counted directly by the elections committee only after verifying that the voter has not voted at his official polling station. Most absentee ballots are cast the day of the elections in alternate polling stations. Early voting is limited to civil servants overseas. There is no postal voting.

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]], liberalised proxy voting is available. Voters can authorise someone else to cast their ballot without having to go through a registration procedure. Voters can cast a maximum of 2 proxy votes along with their own ballot. Postal ballots and Internet voting are only available to Dutch citizens living abroad, or having occupational duties abroad on election day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlement.com|title=Homepage Parlement &amp; Politiek|publisher=|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
As provided by the [[Overseas Absentee Voting Act]], absentee voting in [[Republic of the Philippines|Philippine]] elections is only available in certain circumstances, such as for [[Overseas Filipino Workers]] or other migrants. Votes must be cast in person at select polling places, such as a [[Consulate|consulate office]]; [[postal voting|mail-in ballots]] are an option for Filipinos in select countries. Local absentee voting as pursuant to Republic Act № 7166 and Executive Order № 157 is only available for members of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], [[Philippine National Police]], and government personnel on duty on election day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=REPUBLIC ACT No. 7166 - AN ACT PROVIDING FOR SYNCHRONIZED NATIONAL AND LOCAL ELECTIONS AND FOR ELECTORAL REFORMS, AUTHORIZING APPROPRIATIONS THEREFOR, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES| url=http://www.comelec.gov.ph/laws/republic_acts/ra_7166.html| work=Commission on Elections| accessdate=2010-05-29| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526222739/http://www.comelec.gov.ph/laws/republic_acts/ra_7166.html| archivedate=26 May 2010| deadurl=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absentee voting in both overseas and local is still [[Vote counting system#Manual counting|manual vote counting system]].

Recently, absentee voting in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Singapore]] was done through the [[Optical scan voting system|optical scan voting]] due to [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|COMELEC]] Resolution № 8806 in the [[Philippine general election, 2010|2010 general elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE SPECIAL BOARD OF ELECTION INSPECTORS AND SPECIAL BALLOT RECEPTION AND CUSTODY GROUP ON THE VOTING, COUNTING, AND TRANSMISSION OF RESULTS FOR OVERSEAS ABSENTEE VOTING IN HONGKONG AND SINGAPORE IN CONNECTION WITH THE 10 MAY 2010 NATIONAL AND LOCAL ELECTIONS.| url=http://www.comelec.gov.ph/oav/2010_natl_local/resolutions/res_8806.html| work=Commission on Elections| accessdate=2010-05-29| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529142315/http://www.comelec.gov.ph/oav/2010_natl_local/resolutions/res_8806.html| archivedate=29 May 2010| deadurl=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Absentee voters can only vote for candidates elected by the entire electorate: the [[President of the Philippines|President]], [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]], [[Senate of the Philippines|senators]], and [[Party-list representation in the House of Representatives of the Philippines|party-list representatives]].

===Poland===
In [[Poland]], each citizen registered in the local voters' register, can get an ''absentee voter's certificate'' (AVC), which is a piece of paper with the person's details and the local government's stamp. The person can vote with AVC at every polling station countrywide and worldwide (in polish embassies and consulates; the polling stations abroad are created by the Minister of Foreign Affairs before every elections). An AVC is issued only for [[President of Poland]] elections, parliamentary elections and elections to the [[European Parliament]] (in that case, the AVC can be got by Polish or EU citizen, so the EU citizen can vote for polish deputees at polling station in Poland and polish embassies or consulates, or for deputees from the country of origin. Although, if the EU citizen registers himself in the polish voters' register, the local officials informs appropriate office in the country of origin). In case of [[Senate (Poland)|Senate]] by-elections, AVC may be issued only for voters living and registered in given [[single-member district|single-member constituency]].

A postal voting and proxy voting are also possible. Postal voting is possible both in country and abroad, but proxy voting is possible only in Poland. The proxy must be registered at the same local voters' register as a voter. The mail with the voter's ballot in postal voting is free of charge in Poland, but voter resides abroad must pay to send his ballot to the appropriate consulate.

===Switzerland===
{{Main|Voting in Switzerland}}
Swiss federal law allows [[postal voting]] in all federal elections and referenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite swiss law|sr=161.1|link=161_1|art=8|en=Federal Statute on Political Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all cantons also allow it for cantonal ballot issues. All voters receive their personal ballot by mail and may either cast it at a polling station or mail it back.

===Thailand===
Absentee balloting started in Thailand first time in the 2000 general election. It is promulgated according to a provision in the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand|1997 constitution]]. The absentee ballot can be cast within Thailand and in foreign countries, where Thailand has diplomatic missions. Voters can cast the absentee ballot in 2 cases: (1) those who have their household registration in their constituency but will not be at their constituency on the election day, and wish to cast their vote in advance; and (2) those who physically reside in other locations out of their constituency at least 90 days prior to the election day, and will not be able to travel back to their constituency on the election day. 

In both cases, voters wishing to cast their absentee ballot must register with the election committee 30 days in advance prior to the general election date. Voters within Thailand can cast their vote either at the designated district offices for absentee voting in their provinces or through mail. Likewise, voters overseas can register to vote with the Thai missions in their country of residence or send the ballot to them by mail. The absentee voting date is normally designated a week ahead of the general election date. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=การเลือกตั้งนอกเขตจังหวัด [The procedure of absentee ballot voting]| url=http://www2.ect.go.th/about.php?Province=mp54&amp;SiteMenuID=7627| accessdate=2011-01-15| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526051759/http://www2.ect.go.th/about.php?Province=mp54&amp;SiteMenuID=7627| archivedate=2011-05-26| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=วิธีการเลือกตั้งนอกราชอาณาจักร [The procedure of absentee ballot voting in foreign countries) |url=http://www.consular.go.th/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=359 |accessdate=2011-01-15 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In all [[Elections in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom elections]], postal votes are available on demand – no reason must be given – although a [[vote rigging]] scandal involving postal votes marred the 2004 [[Birmingham]] local election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/4406575.stm|title=Judge upholds vote-rigging claims|publisher=BBC News|date=April 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], absentee voting takes place "by mail-in paper ballot prior to the day of the election."&lt;ref name="NCSLSummary"&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx Absentee and Early Voting], National Conference of State Legislators (March 20, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, "the voter may return the ballot by mail or in person."&lt;ref name="NCSLSummary"/&gt;

The [[National Conference of State Legislatures]] notes:

{{quote|States typically require that a voter fill out an application to receive an absentee ballot. Many states help facilitate this process by making absentee ballot applications available online for voters to print and send, and at least five states (Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota and Utah) permit a voter to submit an application entirely online. Arizona has some counties that have online absentee ballot applications, and in Detroit, Michigan, voters can request an absentee ballot through a smartphone app.

While all states offer some version of absentee voting, there is quite a lot of variation in states' procedures. For instance, some states offer "no-excuse" absentee voting, allowing any registered voter to request an absentee without requiring that the voter state a reason for his/her desire to vote absentee. Some states also allow a time period before the election for voters to appear at the elections office or other designated location in person to request, fill out and cast an absentee ballot in one stop. Still other states permit voters to vote absentee only under a limited set of circumstances.&lt;ref name="NCSLSummary"/&gt;}}

As of March 2017, an excuse is required to vote by mail in 20 states, while in 27 states and the District of Columbia, any qualified voter may vote absentee without offering an excuse.&lt;ref name="NCSLSummary"/&gt; Eight states and D.C. maintain a "permanent absentee ballot" list; "once a voter asks to be added to the list, s/he will automatically receive an absentee ballot for all future elections."&lt;ref name="NCSLSummary"/&gt;

Three states&amp;mdash;Colorado, Oregon, and Washington&amp;mdash;conduct all elections by mail, sending ballots by post to all eligible voters in each election.&lt;ref name="NCSLSummary"/&gt; In 19 other states, certain elections may be held by mail.&lt;ref name="NCSLSummary"/&gt; 

As noted by the [[U.S. Postal Service]]'s ''[[Domestic Mail Manual]]'', the voter must typically pay postage for mailing his or her absentee ballot, but "balloting materials for any election ... must indicate in a prominent location that the proper amount of postage must be paid."&lt;ref name="DMM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/703.htm#wp1114319|title=Section 703: Nonprofit Standard Mail and Other Unique Eligibility|publisher=United States Postal Service|work =Domestic Mail Manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balloting materials may be sent via the U.S. Postal Service without prepayment of postage for "members of the Armed Forces in active service (and their spouses and dependents)"; "members of the [[U.S. Merchant Marine]] and their spouses and dependents"; and "U.S. citizens residing outside the territorial limits of the United States and the [[District of Columbia]] and their spouses and dependents residing with or accompanying them."&lt;ref name="DMM"/&gt;

It is sometimes inaccurately claimed that absentee ballots are not counted unless the race is close; in fact, all valid absentee ballots are counted even if they will not affect the outcome of the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.ncsl.org/Documents/Elections/The_Canvass_October_2015_63.pdf|title=The Facts on 10 Common Election Misconceptions|issue=63|date=October 2015|work=The Canvass, an Elections Newsletter for Legislatures|publisher=National Conference of State Legislatures}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Absentee voting myths vs. realities|url=https://www.army.mil/article/134530|publisher=Federal Voting Assistance Program/U.S. Army|date=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about absentee voting|url=https://www.fvap.gov/vao/vag/appendix/faq|publisher=Federal Voting Assistance Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American citizens who are overseas, including active members of the military, are covered by the [[Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act]] that, among other things, provides for a [[Federal Write-In Absentee Ballot]] which may be used in place of absentee ballots provided under state laws. The [[Federal Voting Assistance Program]] is a government program that assists such voters and exercises other authority under this act. This has been supplemented by the [[Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act]].

[[Image:General-Election-2008-Ballot.jpg|right|thumb|Absentee ballot for the [[United States general elections, 2008|2008 General Election]]]]

In 1997 the [[Texas Legislature]] passed a bill allowing residents to cast absentee ballots from space, because of the presence of the [[NASA]] [[Johnson Space Center]] and the [[astronauts]] that live in the [[Houston metropolitan area]].&lt;ref&gt;(October 21, 2004) [http://www.nasa.gov/vision/space/livinginspace/chiao_votes.html Democracy in Orbit: Chiao to Vote in Space] [[NASA]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====All-mail voting====
Voting in the states of [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Colorado]] are unique in regards to the rest of the nation, in that voting is conducted entirely by mail. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; In Oregon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sos.oregon.gov/voting/Pages/drop-box-locator.aspx|title=Oregon Secretary of State: Oregon Drop Box Locator|website=sos.oregon.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Washington state, counties provide drop boxes throughout the county to allow voters to drop off their ballot on or prior to election day, rather than paying postage by sending it through the mail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://secstate.wa.gov/documentvault/WashingtonStatesVotebyMailExperienceOctober2007-2066.pdf Washington State's Vote-By-Mail Experience]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:All rights reserved.jpg|thumb|right|The phrase "all rights reserved" appearing on a DVD]]
"'''All rights reserved'''" is a [[copyright formality]] indicating that the copyright holder ''reserves'', or holds for its own use, all the rights provided by copyright law. Originating in the [[Buenos Aires Convention]] of 1910, it no longer has any legal effect in any jurisdiction. However, it is still used by many copyright holders.

== Origins ==
The phrase originated as a result of the [[Buenos Aires Convention]] of 1910. Article 3 of the Convention granted copyright in all signatory countries to a work registered in any signatory country, as long as a statement "that indicates the ''reservation'' of the property ''right''" (emphasis added) appeared in the work.&lt;ref name="the-phrase"/&gt; The phrase "all rights reserved" was not specified in the text, but met this requirement.

Other copyright treaties did not require this formality. For example, in 1952 the [[Universal Copyright Convention]] (UCC) adopted the [[Copyright symbol|© symbol]] as an indicator of protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl100.html|title = International Copyright|date = November 2009|accessdate = May 17, 2014|website = |publisher = U.S. Copyright Office|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The symbol was introduced in the US by a 1954 amendment to the [[Copyright Act of 1909]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Copyright Law Revision: Study 7: Notice of Copyright|last = |first = |publisher = United States Government Printing Office|year = 1960|isbn = |location = Washington, D.C.|pages = |url = http://www.copyright.gov/history/studies/study7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The [[Berne Convention]] rejected formalities altogether in Article 4 of the 1908 revision,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wipo.int/copyright/en/activities/copyright_registration/|title = Copyright Registrations and Formalities|date = |accessdate = May 17, 2014|website = |publisher = World Intellectual Property Organization|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; so authors seeking to protect their works in countries that had signed on to the Berne Convention were also not required to use the "all rights reserved" formulation. However, because not all Buenos Aires signatories were members of Berne or the UCC, and in particular the United States did not join UCC until 1955, a publisher in a Buenos Aires signatory seeking to protect a work in the greatest number of countries between 1910 and 1952 would have used both the phrase "all rights reserved" and the copyright symbol.&lt;ref name="chaff" /&gt;

== Obsolescence ==
The requirement to add the "all rights reserved" notice became essentially obsolete on August 23, 2000, when [[Nicaragua]] became the final member of the Buenos Aires Convention to also become a signatory to the Berne Convention. As of that date, every country that was a member of the Buenos Aires Convention (which is the only copyright treaty requiring this notice to be used) was also a member of Berne, which requires protection be granted without any formality of notice of copyright.&lt;ref name=Schwabach149&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schwabach |first1=Aaron |title=Internet and the Law: Technology, Society, and Compromises |date=Jan 15, 2014 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=9781610693509 |oclc=879423922 |page=149 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=to9_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA149 |accessdate=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase continues to hold popular currency and serves as a handy convention widely used by artists, writers, and content creators to prevent ambiguity and clearly spell out the warning that their content cannot be copied freely.&lt;ref name=Schwabach149/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5168">'''Asemia''' is the term for the medical condition of being unable to understand or express any [[sign]]s or [[symbol]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/asemia|title=Asemia|work=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is a more severe condition than [[aphasia]], which is the inability to understand linguistic signs. Asemia is caused by damage to the areas of the brain that process communication – more specifically, when there is damage to the left side of the brain in the areas that process communication such as [[Broca's area|Broca]]'s and [[Wernicke's area]]s. Damage can be inflicted by physical trauma to the brain, but is more commonly caused by stroke and sometimes tumors. The onset of this condition is usually quick but not permanent. Treatment of this condition is traditional speech therapy in which the individual must relearn how to read, write, and talk. Depending on the severity of the injury, recovery can take days to years. Considerable recovery is common, but often not to the full extent of baseline ability.

== Symptoms ==
Asemia is a more severe condition than aphasia, so it does have some similarities with the disease.  People who have asemia have the inability to comprehend signs, symbols, and even language.&lt;ref name=RD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/a/asemia/symptoms.htm|title=Symptoms of Asemia|work=Right Diagnosis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They also have the inability to use signs, symbols, and language.&lt;ref name=RD/&gt;  People with asemia sometimes may take up [[asemic writing]], which is "wordless" writing.&lt;ref name=Asymptote&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asymptotejournal.com/article.php?cat=Visual&amp;id=24|title=On Asemic Writing|author=Jacobson, Michael|work=Asymptote}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What wordless writing could mean is that the writing looks like regular or traditional writing, but there is no content that makes sense.&lt;ref name=Asymptote/&gt; The concept of syntax, semantics, or even communication does not exist in asemic writing.&lt;ref name=Asymptote/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Asemic.gif|thumbnail|This is an example of asemic writing]]&lt;ref&gt;http://asemic.net/asemic.gif&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

== Causes ==
The most common cause of asemia is brain damage, such as a stroke or a brain tumor.&lt;ref name=WiseGeek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-asemia.htm|title=What Is Asemia?|work=WiseGeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible causes include [[Alzheimer's disease]] and infection.&lt;ref name=WiseGeek/&gt; [[Roger Wolcott Sperry]], through his research of [[split-brain patient]]s, had found out that the human brain lateralizes functions, meaning that the two hemispheres of the brain have different functions.&lt;ref name=About&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/a/left-brain-right-brain.htm|title=Left Brain vs Right Brain – Understanding the Myth of Left Brain and Right Brain Dominance|work=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brain damage, specifically to the left hemisphere, can impair our ability to speak or understand language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biausa.org/living-with-brain-injury.htm|title=Living With Brain Injury|work=Brain Injury Association of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led Sperry to conclude that due to the [[lateralization of brain function]], language is based in the left hemisphere.&lt;ref name=About/&gt; Therefore, any kind of brain damage to the left hemisphere will greatly impact language, whether it is expressive or receptive.

== Treatment ==
Speech therapy is usually the most common treatment for asemia.&lt;ref name=WiseGeek/&gt;  Speech therapy allows the patient to be able to improve their speaking, comprehension, and writing skills.&lt;ref name=WiseGeek/&gt;  These patients have to learn all of these skills again since they are unable to understand or express anything.  It usually depends on how long it takes for the speech therapy to work.  If the condition is less severe, it will take less time, such as perhaps a couple of months to years.  If the condition is more severe, it may take many years.&lt;ref name=WiseGeek/&gt;  The way speech therapy works is through speech practice as well as using special computer programs which let the patient practice their communication skills.&lt;ref name=WiseGeek/&gt;  By using simple and short sentences or writing down these phrases can aid the patients while going through therapy.&lt;ref name=WiseGeek/&gt;  Giving them enough time to communicate with their friends, family, or therapist will help them increase their skills and be able to manage them.&lt;ref name=WiseGeek/&gt;

Complete success is usually achieved with treatment.&lt;ref name=WiseGeek/&gt;  However, sometimes only partial success is achieved and the patient cannot fully comprehend everything.&lt;ref name=WiseGeek/&gt;  With the partial restoration of some skills, the speech therapist may only focus on the skills which can be restored.&lt;ref name=WiseGeek/&gt;  In other cases, the therapist may work on the skills which may not retrieved and teach the patient how to handle those.&lt;ref name=WiseGeek/&gt;

'''Bafaw-Balong''' is a [[Bantu language]] of [[Cameroon]]. There are two divergent varieties, Fo’ (Bafaw, Bafo, Bafowu, Afo, Nho, Lefo’) and Long (Balong, Balon, Balung, Nlong, Valongi, Bayi, Bai), which are sometimes considered distinct languages.

The Bafaw and Balong people are two of several who call themselves ''Ngoe'' as they share a legendary origin with speakers of the [[Ngoe languages]], but their language is not part of that group.

'''Camille Bulcke''' (1 September 1909 – 17 August 1982) was a Belgian [[Jesuit]] missionary in [[India]], who attained pre-eminence in the [[Hindi]] language and came to be known as "India's most famous Christian Hindi scholar". Famous in class x Hindi book &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabrang.com/cc/comold/dec00/cover7.htm sabrang.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Camille Bulcke was born in [[Ramskapelle (Knokke-Heist)|Ramskapelle]], a village in [[Knokke-Heist]] municipality in the Belgian province of [[West Flanders]] &lt;ref name=tele&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1070103/asp/jharkhand/story_7214414.asp Father Camille Bulcke] ''[[The Telegraph (Kolkata)|The Telegraph]]'', Wednesday, 3 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulcke had already acquired a B.Sc. degree in civil engineering from [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Louvain University]], when he became a Jesuit in 1930 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/q112791131725127/ Obituary] ''Indo-Iranian Journal'', Publisher: Springer Netherlands. ISSN 0019-7246 (Print) 1572-8536 (Online). Issue: Volume 25, Number 4 / June 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; After doing his philosophical training in [[Valkenburg aan de Geul|Valkenburg]], Netherlands, (1932–34) he left for [[India]] in 1934 and after a brief stay in [[Darjeeling]], he taught Mathematics for five years at [[Gumla]] (present [[Jharkhand]]). It was here that he developed his lifelong passion for learning Hindi, as later recalled:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When I arrived in India in 1935, I was surprised and pained when I realised that many educated people were unaware of their cultural traditions and considered it a matter of pride to speak in English. I resolved my duty would be to master the language of the people." &amp;ndash; The Faith of A Christian—Devotion To Hindi And To Tulsi.&lt;ref name=tele/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Theological]] training (1939–42) was undertaken in [[Kurseong]], India, during which he was ordained priest (in 1941). His interest in the classical language of India led him to do a master's degree in [[Sanskrit]] at [[Calcutta University]] (1942–44) and finally a doctorate in [[Hindi]] literature at [[Allahabad University]] (1945–49) with a thesis titled, ''Ram Katha Ka Vikas'' (Development of the Tale of Rama).

==Career==
In 1949 Bulcke was made Head of the department of [[Sanskrit]] and Hindi of [[St. Xavier's College, Ranchi|St Xavier's College]], [[Ranchi]]. But early hearing problems led him to go more for a scholar's than a professor's career. He felt much attracted by the 17th century's Hindi poet [[Tulsidas]] on whose writings he made his doctoral thesis. He rewrote the famous blue bird novel in Hindi under the name Neel Pakshi. Bulcke was often invited to give conferences on the Hindi poet and his devotional [[Rama]]-songs, which he did with much enthusiasm. He brought people in touch with the profound values of their own spiritual traditions, and, according to him, Tulsidas was also an excellent introduction to the values of the [[Gospel]]. He obtained [[Indian nationality law|Indian citizenship]] in 1951, and - highly esteemed by the [[Government of India]] - was made a member of the National commission for the promotion of [[Hindi]] as the national language.He came to Bihar, visited Church of Darbhanga and also praised "the great land of divines and Mata Sita- the Mithila" and hence he took on the name ''[[Bihar]]i'' after acquiring Indian citizenship.&lt;ref name="Datta 1987 988"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Delhi on 17 August 1982 due to [[gangrene]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ranjesu.org/cami.htm  FR.  CAMILLE  BULCKE,  S.J. (1909 – 1982) - Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107033838/http://www.ranjesu.org/cami.htm |date=7 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Camille Bulcke and Ramcharitmanas==
To fulfill zealously the onerous duties of a missionary monk, Bulcke stayed for quite some time in [[Darjeeling]] to make an in-depth study of the scriptures, being deeply interested in [[Philosophy]], but to acquire a systematic knowledge of [[Indian Philosophy]] and [[Indian Literature|Literature]], he studied for his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in [[Hindi]] from the [[University of Allahabad]].&lt;ref name="Datta 1987 988"/&gt; It was, during this period of preparation for his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[Allahabad]] that he had an occasion to read and study the ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]'' of [[Tulsidas]].&lt;ref name="Datta 1987 988"/&gt; The ''Ramcharitmanas'' was a highly influential devotional book for Hindus in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and was frequently read by Europeans learning Hindi. The more Bulcke studied the ''Ramcharitmanas'', the deeper became his attachment to it.&lt;ref name="Datta 1987 988"/&gt; His sublime sense of righteous goodness, the lofty values and ideals of its characters and its poetic excellence fascinated him to such an extent that it almost became an object of worship for him.&lt;ref name="Datta 1987 988"/&gt; He found a striking resemblance between the ethical aspect of righteous conduct and values of life as portrayed by the author of the ''[[Ramcharitmanas]]'' and those propounded by [[Jesus Christ]] in his discourses.&lt;ref name="Datta 1987 988"/&gt; He, therefore, took up a relevant topic, viz. ''Ramkatha: Utpatti Aur Vikas'' (The Tale of Rama: Origin and Development) and obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|D.Phil]] degree from the [[University of Allahabad]] on the subject.&lt;ref name="Datta 1987 988"/&gt; His thesis was hailed by scholars all over [[India]] and his name became known to litterateurs outside the [[Hindi]] world also.&lt;ref name="Datta 1987 988"/&gt;

==Religious output==
His lifelong involvement in Hindi research and translation work led him to gather material for an English-Hindi Dictionary (40,000 words) that is still the most widely used in North India. Till the end of his life he kept updating it. He prepared a life of [[Christ]] based on the four gospels, ''Muktidata'' (The Redeemer) and also translated the [[Bible]] into Hindi, as well as liturgical and devotional books. His love for the Hindi language, his imposing appearance as well as his constant willingness to help students and scholars and to listen to the simple and the distressed gave him the reputation of being a 'guru' and, for this reason, many approached him for advice even in matters that had little to do with literature.{{CN|date=April 2017}}

A '''capabilities exercise''' (CAPEX) is a form of military or emergency response exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Field Artillery, p. 16, 1990 "Twice each year, a capabilities exercise is conducted where all resident students observe the massed cannon fires of the entire III Corps Artillery, integrated with Army aviation and Air Force close air support."&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include capabilities exercises conducted for the [[low-altitude parachute-extraction system]], the [[VMA-542]] fixed wing attack squadron, or to demonstrate a capability such as deployment of emergency response assets,&lt;ref&gt;Department of Energy Accountability Report: Fiscal Year 1999 1428918345 "During December 1998, a capabilities exercise (CAPEX) was conducted for the Nuclear Weapons Council, Congressional staff, and White House personnel. The objective of the CAPEX was to demonstrate the capability to simultaneously deploy and exercise DOE's complete array of emergency response assets."&lt;/ref&gt; and so on.

'''Champenois''' (''champaignat'') is a [[Romance language]] of the ''[[langues d'oïl]]'' language family spoken by a minority of people in [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]] and [[Île-de-France]] provinces in [[France]], as well as in a handful of towns in southern [[Belgium]] (chiefly the municipality of [[Vresse-sur-Semois]]).

While it is classified as a [[languages of France|regional language of France]], it also has recognized status as a [[regional language]] in the [[Wallonia]] region of Belgium. Champenois is considered an endangered language by the [[Red Book of Endangered Languages|UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;
{{cite book |year=2010 |editor-last=Moseley |editor-first=Christopher |title=Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/endangered-languages/atlas-of-languages-in-danger/ |series=Memory of Peoples |edition=3rd |location=Paris |publisher=UNESCO Publishing |isbn=978-92-3-104096-2 |access-date=2015-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature ==
The language of [[Chrétien de Troyes]] is marked by Champenois traits, but the earliest literature to survive consciously written in Champenois is noted from the end of the 16th century. ''Le Bontemps de Carnaval de Chaumont'' was updated and republished in 1660. The language used contrasts the French spoken by the king's messengers with the Champenois of the local inhabitants. A feature of 18th century Champenois literature was the ''noëls'' (Christmas chants), which wove contemporary and local references into pious texts.

where ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are [[nonterminal symbol]]s, ''a'' is a [[terminal symbol]] (a symbol that represents a constant value), ''S'' is the start symbol, and ε denotes the [[empty string]].  Also, neither ''B'' nor ''C'' may be the [[Start symbol (formal languages)|start symbol]], and the third production rule can only appear if ε is in ''L''(''G''), the language produced by the context-free grammar ''G''.

Every grammar in Chomsky normal form is [[Context-free grammar|context-free]], and conversely, every context-free grammar can be transformed into an equivalent one&lt;ref group=note&gt;that is, one that produces the same [[Context free grammar#Context-free language|language]]&lt;/ref&gt; which is in Chomsky normal form and has a size no larger than the square of the original grammar's size.

==Converting a grammar to Chomsky normal form==

To convert a grammar to Chomsky normal form, a sequence of simple transformations is applied in a certain order; this is described in most textbooks on automata theory.&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt;{{rp|87–94}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hopcroft |first1=John E. |last2=Motwani |first2=Rajeev |last3=Ullman |first3=Jeffrey D. |date=2006 |title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation |edition=3rd |publisher=Addison-Wesley |isbn=0-321-45536-3}} Section 7.1.5, p.272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rich |first=Elaine |date=2007 |title=Automata, Computability, and Complexity: Theory and Applications |publisher=Prentice-Hall |edition=1st |isbn=978-0132288064}}{{page needed|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wegener |first=Ingo |date=1993 |title=Theoretische Informatik - Eine algorithmenorientierte Einführung |language=German |series=Leitfäden und Mongraphien der Informatik |publisher=B.

The presentation here follows Hopcroft, Ullman (1979), but is adapted to use the transformation names from Lange, Leiß (2009).&lt;ref name="Lange.Leis.2009"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lange |first1=Martin |last2=Leiß |first2=Hans |date=2009 |title=To CNF or not to CNF? An Efficient Yet Presentable Version of the CYK Algorithm |journal=Informatica Didactica |volume=8 |url=http://ddi.cs.uni-potsdam.de/InformaticaDidactica/LangeLeiss2009.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;For example, Hopcroft, Ullman (1979) merged '''TERM''' and '''BIN''' into a single transformation.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the following transformations establishes one of the properties required for Chomsky normal form.

===START: Eliminate the start symbol from right-hand sides===

Introduce a new start symbol ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and a new rule 
:''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; → ''S'', 
where ''S'' is the previous start symbol.
This doesn't change the grammar's produced language, and ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; won't occur on any rule's right-hand side.

===TERM: Eliminate rules with nonsolitary terminals===

To eliminate each rule 
:''A'' → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''a'' ... ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;
with a terminal symbol ''a'' being not the only symbol on the right-hand side, introduce, for every such terminal, a new nonterminal symbol ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;, and a new rule 
:''N''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''a''. 
Change every rule 
:''A'' → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''a'' ... ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; 
to 
:''A'' → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.
If several terminal symbols occur on the right-hand side, simultaneously replace each of them by its associated nonterminal symbol.
This doesn't change the grammar's produced language.&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt;{{rp|92}}

===BIN: Eliminate right-hand sides with more than 2 nonterminals===

Replace each rule 
:''A'' → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; 
with more than 2 nonterminals ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; by rules 
:''A'' → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 
:... , 
:''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sub&gt; → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, 
where ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are new nonterminal symbols.
Again, this doesn't change the grammar's produced language.&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt;{{rp|93}}

===DEL: Eliminate ε-rules===

An ε-rule is a rule of the form 
:''A'' → ε, 
where ''A'' is not ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the grammar's start symbol.

To eliminate all rules of this form, first determine the set of all nonterminals that derive ε.
Hopcroft and Ullman (1979) call such nonterminals ''nullable'', and compute them as follows:
* If a rule ''A'' → ε exists, then ''A'' is nullable.
* If a rule ''A'' → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; exists, and every single ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is nullable, then ''A'' is nullable, too.

Obtain an intermediate grammar by replacing each rule 
:''A'' → ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; 
by all versions with some nullable ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; omitted.
By deleting in this grammar each ε-rule, unless its left-hand side is the start symbol, the transformed grammar is obtained.&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt;{{rp|90}}

For example, in the following grammar, with start symbol ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,
: ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; → ''AbB'' | ''C''
: ''B'' → ''AA'' | ''AC''
: ''C'' → ''b'' | ''c''
: ''A'' → ''a'' | ε
the nonterminal ''A'', and hence also ''B'', is nullable, while neither ''C'' nor ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is.
Hence the following intermediate grammar is obtained:&lt;ref group=note&gt;indicating a kept and omitted nonterminal ''N'' by ''{{color|#006000|N}}'' and ''{{color|#ffc0c0|&lt;s&gt;N&lt;/s&gt;}}'', respectively&lt;/ref&gt;
: ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; → ''{{color|#006000|A}}b{{color|#006000|B}}'' | ''{{color|#006000|A}}b{{color|#ffc0c0|&lt;s&gt;B&lt;/s&gt;}}'' | ''{{color|#ffc0c0|&lt;s&gt;A&lt;/s&gt;}}b{{color|#006000|B}}'' | ''{{color|#ffc0c0|&lt;s&gt;A&lt;/s&gt;}}b{{color|#ffc0c0|&lt;s&gt;B&lt;/s&gt;}}'' &amp;nbsp; | &amp;nbsp; ''C''
: ''B'' → ''{{color|#006000|AA}}'' | ''{{color|#ffc0c0|&lt;s&gt;A&lt;/s&gt;}}{{color|#006000|A}}'' | ''{{color|#006000|A}}{{color|#ffc0c0|&lt;s&gt;A&lt;/s&gt;}}'' | ''{{color|#ffc0c0|&lt;s&gt;A&lt;/s&gt;}}ε{{color|#ffc0c0|&lt;s&gt;A&lt;/s&gt;}}'' &amp;nbsp; | &amp;nbsp; ''{{color|#006000|A}}C'' | ''{{color|#ffc0c0|&lt;s&gt;A&lt;/s&gt;}}C''
: ''C'' → ''b'' | ''c''
: ''A'' → ''a'' | ε
In this grammar, all ε-rules have been "[[inlining|inlined]] at the call site".&lt;ref group=note&gt;If the grammar had a rule ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; → ε, it could not be "inlined", since it had no "call sites". Therefore it couldn't be deleted in the next step.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the next step, they can hence be deleted, yielding the grammar:
: ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; → ''AbB'' | ''Ab'' | ''bB'' | ''b'' &amp;nbsp; | &amp;nbsp; ''C''
: ''B'' → ''AA'' | ''A'' &amp;nbsp; | &amp;nbsp; ''AC'' | ''C''
: ''C'' → ''b'' | ''c''
: ''A'' → ''a''
This grammar produces the same language as the original example grammar, viz. {''ab'',''aba'',''abaa'',''abab'',''abac'',''abb'',''abc'',''b'',''bab'',''bac'',''bb'',''bc'',''c''}, but has no ε-rules.

===UNIT: Eliminate unit rules===

A unit rule is a rule of the form 
:''A'' → ''B'', 
where ''A'', ''B'' are nonterminal symbols.
To remove it, for each rule 
:''B'' →  ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, 
where  ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a string of nonterminals and terminals, add rule 
:''A'' →  ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ... ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; 
unless this is a unit rule which has already been (or is being) removed.

===Order of transformations===

{| class="wikitable collapsible" style="float:right"
|-
|+ Mutual preservation&lt;BR&gt;of transformation results
|-
| colspan=6 | Transformation ''X'' {{color|#004000|always preserves}} ({{Aye}})&lt;BR&gt;resp. {{color|#400000|may destroy}} ({{Nay}}) the result of ''Y'':
|-

! START  ||TERM||BIN||DEL||UNIT
|-

|-
! TERM 
| {{Ya}} ||          || {{Na}}  || {{Ya}}  || {{Ya}}

| {{Ya}} || {{Ya}}   ||         || {{Ya}}  || {{Ya}} 
|-

|-
! UNIT 
| {{Ya}} || {{Ya}}   || {{Ya}}  ||{{Ya|text=({{Aye}})&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;}}||  
|-
| colspan=6 | &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;'''UNIT''' preserves the result of '''DEL'''&lt;BR&gt;&amp;nbsp; if '''START''' had been called before.
|}

When choosing the order in which the above transformations are to be applied, it has to be considered that some transformations may destroy the result achieved by other ones. For example, '''START''' will re-introduce a unit rule if it is applied after '''UNIT'''. The table shows which orderings are admitted.

Moreover, the worst-case bloat in grammar size&lt;ref group=note&gt;i.e. written length, measured in symbols&lt;/ref&gt; depends on the transformation order. Using |''G''| to denote the size of the original grammar ''G'', the size blow-up in the worst case may range from |''G''|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 2&lt;sup&gt;2 |G|&lt;/sup&gt;, depending on the transformation algorithm used.&lt;ref name="Lange.Leis.2009"/&gt;{{rp|7}} The blow-up in grammar size depends on the order between '''DEL''' and '''BIN'''. It may be exponential when '''DEL''' is done first, but is linear otherwise. '''UNIT''' can incur a quadratic blow-up in the size of the grammar.&lt;ref name="Lange.Leis.2009"/&gt;{{rp|5}} The orderings '''START''','''TERM''','''BIN''','''DEL''','''UNIT''' and '''START''','''BIN''','''DEL''','''UNIT''','''TERM''' lead to the least (i.e. quadratic) blow-up.

==Example==

[[File:Syntax tree of arithmetic expression wrt Chomsky normal form grammar.gif|thumb|[[Abstract syntax tree]] of the [[expression (mathematics)|arithmetic expression]] "''a''^2+4*''b''" wrt. the example grammar ('''top''') and its Chomsky normal form ('''bottom''')]]
The following grammar, with start symbol ''Expr'', describes a simplified version of the set of all syntactical valid arithmetic expressions in programming languages like [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[Algol60]]. Both ''number'' and ''variable'' are considered terminal symbols here for simplicity, since in a [[compiler front-end]] their internal structure is usually not considered by the [[parser]]. The terminal symbol "^" denoted [[exponentiation]] in Algol60.

:{|
|-
| ''Expr'' 
| → ''Term'' 
| | |  ''Expr'' ''AddOp'' ''Term''
| | | ''AddOp'' ''Term''  
|-
| ''Term'' 
| → ''Factor''  
| | |  ''Term'' ''MulOp'' ''Factor''
|-
| ''Factor'' 
| → ''Primary''  
| | |  ''Factor'' ^ ''Primary''
|-
| ''Primary'' 
| → ''number''  
| | |  ''variable''  
| | |  ( ''Expr'' )
|-
| ''AddOp''
| → +
| | | &amp;minus;
|-
| ''MulOp''
| → *
| | | /
|}

In step "START" of the [[#Converting a grammar to Chomsky normal form|above]] conversion algorithm, just a rule ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;→''Expr'' is added to the grammar.
After step "TERM", the grammar looks like this:

:{|
|-
| ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
| → ''Expr'' 
|-
| ''Expr'' 
| → ''Term'' 
| | |  ''Expr'' ''AddOp'' ''Term''
| | | ''AddOp'' ''Term''  
|-
| ''Term'' 
| → ''Factor''  
| | |  ''Term'' ''MulOp'' ''Factor''
|-
| ''Factor'' 
| → ''Primary''  
| | |  ''Factor'' ''PowOp'' ''Primary''
|-
| ''Primary'' 
| → ''number''  
| | |  ''variable''  
| | |  ''Open'' ''Expr'' ''Close''
|-
| ''AddOp''
| → +
| | | &amp;minus;
|-
| ''MulOp''
| → *
| | | /
|-
| ''PowOp''
| → ^
|-
| ''Open''
| → (
|-
| ''Close''
| → )
|}

After step "BIN", the following grammar is obtained:

:{|
|-
| ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
| → ''Expr'' 
|-
| ''Expr'' 
| → ''Term'' 
| | |  ''Expr'' ''AddOp_Term''
| | | ''AddOp'' ''Term''  
|-
| ''Term'' 
| → ''Factor''  
| | |  ''Term'' ''MulOp_Factor''
|-
| ''Factor'' 
| → ''Primary''  
| | |  ''Factor'' ''PowOp_Primary''
|-
| ''Primary'' 
| → ''number''  
| | |  ''variable''  
| | |  ''Open'' ''Expr_Close''
|-
| ''AddOp''
| → +
| | | &amp;minus;
|-
| ''MulOp''
| → *
| | | /
|-
| ''PowOp''
| → ^
|-
| ''Open''
| → (
|-
| ''Close''
| → )
|-
| ''AddOp_Term''
| colspan=3 | → ''AddOp'' ''Term''
|-
| ''MulOp_Factor''
| colspan=3 | → ''MulOp'' ''Factor''
|-
| ''PowOp_Primary''
| colspan=3 | → ''PowOp'' ''Primary''
|-
| ''Expr_Close''
| colspan=3 | → ''Expr'' ''Close''
|}

Since there are no ε-rules, step "DEL" doesn't change the grammar.
After step "UNIT", the following grammar is obtained, which is in Chomsky normal form:

:{|
|-
| ''S''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;
| → ''number'' 
| | |  ''variable'' 
| | |  ''Open'' ''Expr_Close''
| | |  ''Factor'' ''PowOp_Primary''
| | |  ''Term'' ''MulOp_Factor''
| | |  ''Expr'' ''AddOp_Term''
| | | ''AddOp'' ''Term''  
|-
| ''Expr'' 
| → ''number'' 
| | |  ''variable'' 
| | |  ''Open'' ''Expr_Close''
| | |  ''Factor'' ''PowOp_Primary''
| | |  ''Term'' ''MulOp_Factor''
| | |  ''Expr'' ''AddOp_Term''
| | | ''AddOp'' ''Term''  
|-
| ''Term'' 
| → ''number'' 
| | |  ''variable'' 
| | |  ''Open'' ''Expr_Close''
| | |  ''Factor'' ''PowOp_Primary''
| | |  ''Term'' ''MulOp_Factor''
|-
| ''Factor'' 
| → ''number'' 
| | |  ''variable'' 
| | |  ''Open'' ''Expr_Close''
| | |  ''Factor'' ''PowOp_Primary''
|-
| ''Primary'' 
| → ''number''  
| | |  ''variable''  
| | |  ''Open'' ''Expr_Close''
|-
| ''AddOp''
| → +
| | | &amp;minus;
|-
| ''MulOp''
| → *
| | | /
|-
| ''PowOp''
| → ^
|-
| ''Open''
| → (
|-
| ''Close''
| → )
|-
| ''AddOp_Term''
| colspan=3 | → ''AddOp'' ''Term''
|-
| ''MulOp_Factor''
| colspan=3 | → ''MulOp'' ''Factor''
|-
| ''PowOp_Primary''
| colspan=3 | → ''PowOp'' ''Primary''
|-
| ''Expr_Close''
| colspan=3 | → ''Expr'' ''Close''
|}

The ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; introduced in step "TERM" are ''PowOp'', ''Open'', and ''Close''.
The ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; introduced in step "BIN" are ''AddOp_Term'', ''MulOp_Factor'', ''PowOp_Primary'', and ''Expr_Close''.

==Alternative definition==

=== Chomsky reduced form ===
Another way&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt;{{rp|92}}&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft et al. (2006){{page needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to define the Chomsky normal form is:

A [[formal grammar]] is in '''Chomsky reduced form''' if all of its production rules are of the form:
: &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow\, BC&lt;/math&gt; or
: &lt;math&gt;A \rightarrow\, a&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; are nonterminal symbols, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a [[terminal symbol]].  When using this definition, &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; may be the start symbol.  Only those context-free grammars which do not generate the [[empty string]] can be transformed into Chomsky reduced form.

=== Floyd normal form ===
In a paper where he proposed a term [[Backus–Naur form]] (BNF), [[Donald E. Knuth]] implied a BNF "syntax in which all definitions have such a form may be said to be in 'Floyd Normal Form'",
: &lt;math&gt;\langle A \rangle ::= \, \langle B \rangle \mid \langle C \rangle&lt;/math&gt; or
: &lt;math&gt;\langle A \rangle ::= \, \langle B \rangle \langle C \rangle&lt;/math&gt; or
: &lt;math&gt;\langle A \rangle ::=\, a&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\langle A \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\langle B \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle C \rangle&lt;/math&gt; are nonterminal symbols, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a [[terminal symbol]],
because [[Robert W. Floyd]] found any BNF syntax can be converted to the above one in 1961.&lt;ref name="knuth1964"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knuth |first=Donald E. |date=December 1964 |title=Backus Normal Form vs. Backus Naur Form |journal=Communications of the ACM |doi=10.1145/355588.365140 |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=735–736}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he withdrew this term, "since doubtless many people have independently used this simple fact in their own work, and the point is only incidental to the main considerations of Floyd's note."&lt;ref name="knuth1964" /&gt;

== Application ==
Besides its theoretical significance, CNF conversion is used in some algorithms as a preprocessing step, e.g., the [[CYK algorithm]], a [[bottom-up parsing]] for context-free grammars, and its variant probabilistic CKY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jurafsky |first1=Daniel |last2=Martin |first2=James H. |date=2008 |title=Speech and Language Processing |edition=2nd |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0-13-187321-6 |page=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Coorgi–Cox alphabet''' is an [[alphabet]] developed by the [[linguist]] Gregg M. Cox and is used by a number of individuals within [[Kodagu]] district of India. It is the independent dialect of [[Tulu language|Tulu]]. It is used for the endangered [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] language of [[Kodava language|Kodava]], also known sometimes as ''Coorgi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/03/12/stories/2006031206840300.htm|title=Debate on Kodava script continues|date=March 12, 2006|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Coorgi–Cox alphabet uses a combination of 26 [[consonant]]s, five [[vowel]] markings and a [[diphthong]] marker. Each letter represents a single sound and there are no [[capital letter]]s. A computer based font has been created for use with the alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;The Coorgi-Cox handbook, Feb. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The alphabet was developed out of the request by a group of native individuals to have their own unique script for Kodava Takk, and to distinguish the language on its own merits. Kodava Takk is generally written in the [[Kannada script]], but can also be found written in the [[Malayalam script]] especially along the borders with [[Kerala]]. The new alphabet is intended to unify, and to provide a single alphabet to be used for all Kodava Takk speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg Cox, April 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to introduce the alphabet, 10,000 CD booklets and 25,000 post cards with various scenes from the region were produced and distributed throughout the Coorg area in March and April 2005. Several books are being planned including a [[phrase book]] and [[dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;Sujet publishers, Sep. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dead hedge''' is a barrier constructed from cut branches, [[sapling]]s, and [[foliage]]. The material can be from pruning, clearing, or forestry activities. Their succession is a [[beetle bank]] or [[hedge]]. 

==Restoration ecology and biological pest control== 
Dead hedges or wind-rows, as they are known in the coppice trade, are useful keeping the compartments of the coppice tidy, keeping the public from certain areas, being an excellent habitat and corridor for wildlife [[habitat conservation]] and [[restoration ecology]], as they offer shelter for small animals, especially birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://handbooks.btcv.org.uk/handbooks/content/chapter/65 |title=Hedging |work=BTCV handbook |author=[[BTCV]] |accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be part of a beneficial "biological pest agents" [[habitat]] in [[biological pest control]] programs for [[natural landscape]]s and [[organic gardening]].

==Agriculture==
Dead hedges usually provide an enclosure for the storage of livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northwichcommunitywoodlands.org.uk/events-hedgelaying.shtml |accessdate=2008-01-20 |work=Northwich Community Woodlands |title=Hedge-laying - alive and well in the Northwich Community Woodlands |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110021455/http://www.northwichcommunitywoodlands.org.uk/events-hedgelaying.shtml |archivedate=November 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The above biological pest control dead hedges use is also part of [[organic farming]] and [[sustainable agriculture]].

Dead hedges also recycle-reuse [[biomass]] without energy use to transport to landfills, or by burning, reducing a [[carbon footprint]] impact.

'''Documenting Hate''' is a project of [[ProPublica]], in collaboration with a number of journalistic, academic, and computing organizations, for systematic tracking of [[hate crime]]s and [[bias incident]]s. It uses an online form to facilitate reporting of incidents by the general public.{{r|Wang-2017-01-23}} Since August 2017, it has also used [[machine learning]] and [[natural language processing]] techniques to monitor and collect news stories about hate crimes and bias incidents.{{r|Glickhouse-2017-08-18}}{{r|Rogers-2017-08-18}}{{r|Wang-2017-08-18}}{{r|Hatmaker-2017-08-18}}{{r|Morris-2017-08-19}} {{asof|2017|10}}, over 100 news organizations had joined the project.{{r|Gockowski-2017-10-10}}

== History ==

=== Origin ===

Documenting Hate was created in response to ProPublica's dissatisfaction with the quality of reporting and tracking of evidence of hate crimes and bias incidents after the [[United States presidential election, 2016|United States presidential election of 2016]]. The project was launched on 17 January 2017,{{r|New-2017-02-17}}{{r|Ciobanu-2017-01-20}}{{r|Anzilotti-2017-02-03}}{{r|ProPublica-2017-01-17}} after the publication on 15 November 2016 of a ProPublica news story about the difficulty of obtaining hard data on hate crimes.{{r|Thompson-and-Schwenke-2016-11-15}}

=== Introduction of the Documenting Hate News Index ===

On 18 August 2017, ProPublica and [[Google]] announced the creation of the Documenting Hate News Index, which uses the Google Cloud Natural Language API for automated monitoring and collection of news stories about hate crimes and bias incidents. The API uses [[machine learning]] and [[natural language processing]] techniques. The findings of the Index are integrated with reports from members of the public. The Index is a joint project of ProPublica, Google News Lab, and the [[data visualization]] studio Pitch Interactive.{{r|Glickhouse-2017-08-18}}{{r|Rogers-2017-08-18}}{{r|Wang-2017-08-18}}{{r|Hatmaker-2017-08-18}}{{r|Morris-2017-08-19}}

== Response ==

=== Participation ===

{{asof|2017|05}}, thousands of incidents had been reported via Documenting Hate.{{r|Latino-USA-2017-05-10}} {{asof|2017|10}}, over 100 news organizations had joined the project, including the [[The Boston Globe|''Boston Globe'']], the [[The New York Times|''New York Times'']], [[Vox (website)|''Vox'']], and the [[Georgetown University]] [[The Hoya|''Hoya'']].{{r|Gockowski-2017-10-10}}

=== Conservative response ===

An education reporter for the conservative ''[[The Daily Caller|Daily Caller]]'' has criticized the project for ambiguity in the terms it uses to describe hate crimes, and for neglect of hate-crime hoaxes.{{r|Shimshock-2017-03-23}} Another ''[[The Daily Caller|Daily Caller]]'' journalist has likewise criticized the Documenting Hate News Index for underrepresentation of conservative outlets among the news sources it monitors.{{r|Cheong-2017-08-20}} 

=== Relationship to government statistical monitoring ===

A policy analyst for the Center for Data Innovation (an affiliate of the [[Information Technology and Innovation Foundation]]), while supporting ProPublica's critique of the present state of hate-crime statistics, and praising ProPublica for drawing attention to the problem, has argued that a nongovernmental project like Documenting Hate cannot solve it unaided; instead, intervention at the federal level is needed.{{r|New-2017-02-17}}

'''Drama 2.0''' is a [[multi-platform television]] format. The goal of this format is to synchronize scripted content with [[user-generated content]]. The TV drama invites the audience to participate online and in reality, offering various layers of involvement. The highest levels of participation, the ''quality participation'', is designed to generate content by the participant in various forms. The lower levels of participation, the ''quantity participation'', is designed to distribute the content generated by the quality participation. This user generated content is quoted in the TV drama through so called ''donut holes'' and steered by ''matches''. These layers of participation form the participation pyramid. The lower levels are aimed at a broad audience and casual fans. The top levels, the quantity participation, are aimed at the hard-core fans. A community is built months before the launch of the TV drama, simultaneously with the shoot and post production of the scripted content.

[[Image:Participation pyramid.jpg|400px|left|thumb|Participation pyramid]]

Drama 2.0 extends the content to all media and invites the audience not only to watch the drama, but actively participate online and in reality. It was first defined by Peter De Maegd and [[Eric Taelman]] throughout the development of the multi-platform series The Artists, commissioned by national broadcasters of Belgium ([[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]]) and Sweden ([[Sveriges Television|SVT]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13558">A '''dysphemism''' is an expression with connotations that are offensive either about the subject matter or to the audience, or both. Dysphemisms contrast with neutral or euphemistic expressions.&lt;ref name="E &amp; D"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allan|first1=Keith|last2=Burridge|first2=Kate|title=Euphemism and Dysphemism: Language Used As Shield and Weapon|year=2001|publisher=Replica Books|location=Bridgewater, N.J.|isbn=978-0-7351-0288-0|edition=1st Replica Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dysphemism is sometimes motivated by feelings such as fear, distaste, hatred, and contempt. Worded simply, a dysphemism is a derogatory or unpleasant term used instead of a pleasant or neutral one, such as "loony bin" for "mental hospital".

==Etymology==
The word ''dysphemism'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''dys'' δύς "mis-" and ''pheme'' φήμη "speech, voice, reputation". Related terms include ''malphemism'' (from the [[Latin Language|Latin]] ''malus'' "bad"), and ''cacophemism'' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''kakos'' κακός "bad").

== Usage ==
A dysphemism is a [[Markedness|marked]] form which expresses a speaker's view or attitude towards the listener or group, as opposed to a form that is typical of the speaker's speech. Thus marked forms are relative to the speaker and social context. Were a speaker to use exclusively intimate terms to address a person (e.g., the person's first name), that would be the speaker's norm. To show social distance or to express anger one would use a marked (atypical) form, for example a more formal form of address, such as adding a title or using the listener's last name.&lt;ref name="E &amp; D" /&gt;

== Types ==

=== Synecdoche ===
One kind of dysphemism is [[Synecdoche|synecdochic]], where a part is used to represent the whole,&lt;ref name="E &amp; D" /&gt; such as  "What an asshole."

=== Dysphemistic epithets ===
Animal names are frequently used as dysphemistic epithets. By using one, the speaker offends the listener by targeting his or her humanity. Examples include "pig", "chicken", "sheep", "snake", and "rat".&lt;ref name="Rawson 1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rawson|first=Hugh|title=Wicked words: a treasury of curses, insults, put-downs, and other formerly unprintable terms from Anglo-Saxon times to the present|year=1989|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-517-57334-2|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Name dysphemism ===
When a person uses another's name rather than an appropriate kinship term or title of address.{{Clarify|reason=incomplete sentence|date=March 2015}} The speaker uses a more casual or lower style than is appropriate given the social context.
* "Peter, what are you doing?" (rather than "Dad"/"Father")
* "How are you doing, Bill?" (rather than "Uncle Bill")

(Many languages, to a greater extent than in English, use different forms to indicate respect, and thus provide more scope for such dysphemism and require care by non-native speakers to avoid causing offence by unintentional dysphemism.)

This use of language may not constitute dysphemism if the choice of words used by the speaker is welcomed by the listener, such as a father who prefers being called by his given name as opposed to "Dad"/"Father". In that case it would appeal to the listener's positive face rather than damage it, and would thus not be a dysphemism.

Anger or dissatisfaction with the listener (or group of people) may compel a speaker to use a name dysphemism or term of address dysphemism.&lt;ref name="E &amp; D" /&gt;

=== Cross-cultural dysphemism ===
Various [[slang]] terms that are dysphemistic in one culture may not be if they hold a different meaning in another culture. For instance, the word "fag" when used in American English is typically a slur against gay men. However, in British English, the word "fag" is usually an inoffensive term used to refer to a cigarette, or, previously, a junior boy who serves a senior boy in a British public school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Fag|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fag|work=The American Heritage Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the word "fanny" when used in American English is a euphemism for one's buttocks, so benign that children use it. However, in British English, the word "fanny" is slang for vulva, and is considered to be vulgar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Fanny|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/fanny|work=The American Heritage Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context and drift ==
Some phrases that are euphemisms in certain contexts can be considered dysphemistic in others. These are often referred to as X-phemisms:&lt;ref name=Metaphor&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plaff|first=Kerry|author2=Raymond W. Gibbs |author3=Michael D. Johnson |doi=10.1017/S0142716400009875|title=Metaphor in using and understanding euphemism and dysphemism|journal=Applied Psycholinguistics|year=1997|volume=18|issue=1|pages=59–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; whether the utterance is dysphemistic or not depending on the context of the utterance. When speaking to a close friend about death, it would be considered euphemistic to say "he kicked the bucket". However, if a doctor were to use this phrase after an unsuccessful operation, the phrase would be considered dysphemistic in the context of professional medicine. Likewise many X-phemisms regarding [[sexual intercourse]] could be considered euphemistic within peer groups yet dysphemistic in certain audiences. One might be more likely to say that they "got laid" to a friend than to one's grandparents.&lt;ref name=Metaphor /&gt;

There may also be instances in which conflicting definitions of the same word may lead to unintentional dysphemism. The pejorative use of the word [[terrorist]] is a salient example, as definitions of the word terrorist may vary across cultures and even within individuals in the same culture. Typically the word "terrorist" refers to one who uses violence and fear as a means to pursue political, religious or ideological aims. This definition is ambiguous, and many groups that refer to themselves as "freedom fighters", "revolutionaries", "rebels" or "liberators" are referred to as "terrorists" by dissenting parties.&lt;ref name="Fighting Words" /&gt; Labeling groups as terrorist draws associations with other groups labeled as such even when no direct connection might be present. In 2003, the Philippine government's intention to label the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] as a terrorist organization was indicated by the organization to be an escalation of hostilities.&lt;ref name="Fighting Words"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhatia|first=Michael|title=Fighting Words: Naming Terrorists, Bandits, Rebels and Other Violent Actors|journal=Third World Quarterly|year=2005|volume=26|issue=1|page=6|doi=10.1080/0143659042000322874|url=http://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/courses/PoliticalScience/357B1/documents/BhatiaFightingWordsNamingTerroristsBanditsRebels.pdf|accessdate=24 June 2014|deadurl=no|archivedate=24 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140624113340/http://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/courses/PoliticalScience/357B1/documents/BhatiaFightingWordsNamingTerroristsBanditsRebels.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was their belief that by calling their organization a terrorist organization they were being directly compared to Al-Qaeda, with whom they claim no connection. Naming groups in this way has been described, "A name will place emphasis on certain aspects and characteristics of an object, while neglecting or omitting other key areas".&lt;ref name="Fighting Words" /&gt;

The interpretation and the production of a text (whether it be written, verbal, or multi-modal) depends on the previous knowledge and experience of the interpreter or producer. The individual compares matching features with representations stored in their long term memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fairclough|first=Norman|title=Language and power|year=2001|publisher=Longman|location=Harlow, [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-582-41483-9|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain lexical items can be used to activate these representations, conjuring stereotypical images which then become the prototype in the listener's mind. Dysphemic terms activate negative stereotypes present in the listener's memory and affect their interpretation of the given text.

=== Move from euphemism to dysphemism ===

The process of [[pejoration]] leads to words that were once considered euphemisms to now be considered dysphemisms. Words like "negro" and "colored" were once considered euphemisms,&lt;ref name="Obscenity Symbol"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Read|first=Allan|title=An Obscenity Symbol|journal=American Speech|year=1934|volume=9|issue=4|doi=10.2307/452191}}&lt;/ref&gt; but have since been replaced by terms like "black" and "African-American". Sometimes slight modifications of dysphemisms can make them acceptable: while "colored people" is considered dysphemistic, "people of color" does not carry the same connotations.
The words "[[idiot]]" and "[[moron (psychology)|moron]]" were once polite terms to refer to people with mental disabilities,&lt;ref name="Mismeasure of Man"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gould|first=Stephen Jay|title=The mismeasure of man|year=1996|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-03972-2|edition=Rev. and expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are now rarely used without dysphemism. Likewise, the word "retarded" was introduced as a new polite form once the previous terms were outdated. Since then "retard" has been used dysphemistically, suggesting that this term might now be outdated as well. Often a word with both taboo and non-taboo meanings becomes restricted to the taboo definition alone. The term "euphemism treadmill",&lt;ref name="The Blank Slate"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pinker|first=Steven|title=The blank slate: the modern denial of human nature|year=2002|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-0-14-200334-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; coined by [[Steven Pinker]], describes this process, in which terms with an emotionally charged referent that were once euphemisms become dysphemistic by association with the referent.

=== Reclamation of dysphemisms ===

"[[Nigger]]" would typically be dysphemistic; however, if used between African-Americans it may be seen as neutral (although extremely casual) by the listener, depending on his/her social distance from the speaker and perceived status relative to the other party;&lt;ref name="E &amp; D" /&gt; see [[Nigga]].

Reclamations of taboo terms have been both successful and unsuccessful. The term "chicano" was a derogatory term and has been successfully reclaimed. Some terms like "Yankee" (for an American) or "punk" for a late 1970s rocker, began as derogatory but were not considered such and adopted proudly by the named group. Movements to reclaim words for homosexuals such as "queer", "fag" and "dyke" are also noteworthy.&lt;ref name="Rawson 1989" /&gt;

Of note are historic examples of dysphemism reclamation; for instance, the term [[Impressionism]] originated as a critical remark that "[[Monet]]'s ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' was not art, it was an impression", but was adopted to be the formal name of the style, and was accepted by the artists themselves.

== Taboo terms ==
[[Taboo]] terms are used as insults, epithets, and expletives because they damage the listener's face, which might destroy social harmony — especially if the speaker and listener are socially distant from one another. For this reason, terms of insult are socially taboo and dysphemistic. Breaking a social taboo can act as an emotional release, with the illocutionary act of expressing a feeling or attitude.&lt;ref name="E &amp; D" /&gt;

Bad or taboo words for many things far outnumber the "good" words. Hugh Rawson notices in his book ''Wicked Words'' that when looking at Roget's International Thesaurus, there are "...89 synonyms for drunk, compared to 16 for sober, and 206 for bad person compared to 82 for good person. The synonyms for unchastity in the Thesaurus fill 140 lines, occupying exactly four times as much space as those for chastity. For unchaste woman, 34 synonyms are listed, for unchaste man, 24. No synonyms at all are given for chaste woman and chaste man."&lt;ref name="Rawson 1989" /&gt;

Bodily effluvia, or bodily excretions, are perennial targets for dysphemy. Many communities historically believed that bodily effluvia such as feces (faeces), spittle, blood, nail-parings, and hair-clippings were cursed. Such revulsion is apparently learned: children and animals are not put off by bodily effluvia (unless they have a foul smell). In a study done at Monash and La Trobe Universities in Melbourne, Australia, subjects rated bodily effluvia according to how revolting they found them.

The '''First Grammatical Treatise''' ({{lang-is|Fyrsta málfræðiritgerðin}}) is a 12th-century work on the [[phonology]] of the [[Old Norse]] or Old Icelandic language. It was given this name because it is the first of four grammatical works bound in the Icelandic manuscript ''[[Codex Wormianus]]''. The anonymous author is today often referred to as the "First Grammarian".

==Significance==

This  work is one of the earliest written works in Icelandic (and in any [[North Germanic language]]). It is a linguistic work dealing with [[Old Norse]], in the tradition of Latin and Greek grammatical treatises, generally dated to the mid-12th century. Hreinn Benediktsson{{sfn|Benediktsson|1972|p=22–33}} was not able to narrow the time of writing more precisely than to 1125–1175.

The First Grammatical Treatise was of great interest to some mid-20th century linguists, since it systematically used the technique of [[minimal pair]]s to establish the inventory of distinctive sounds or [[phoneme]]s in the Icelandic language,{{sfn|Haugen|1950|p=8}} in a manner reminiscent of the methods of [[structuralism|structural linguistics]].{{sfn|Benediktsson|1972|p=35}} It is also notable for revealing the existence of a whole series of [[nasal vowel]] phonemes, whose presence in the Icelandic language of the time would otherwise be unknown.

The ''Treatise'' is important for the study of Old Norse, as it is a major text showing the state of the language just prior to the writing of the [[Icelandic Sagas]]. It also provides a comprehensive study of the pronunciation of the language, to the extent that it created an [[Icelandic alphabet]] derived from the Latin, and more adapted to writing on paper or parchment than the older, epigraphic [[Runic alphabet]] that was made for shorter carvings on wood or stone. (Other writings in the Latin alphabet presumably existed in the form of law books and Christian writings. The educated clergy of the time would not have used runes.) This alphabet included [[þ]] (derived straight from the runes), as well as diacritic indication of [[vowel length]], and an o with an [[ogonek]] (at the time an independent phoneme, but by now merged with ''ö''). The ''First Grammarian's'' entire system was never adopted, as evidenced in later manuscripts,{{sfn|Böðvarsson|1974}} in some cases not much younger, but it has had an influence on Icelandic writing ever since (see above). See [[Icelandic orthography]].

==Alphabet==

Long vowels are marked with an acute, e.g. á. For the nasals, this replaces the dot.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;''First Grammatical Treatise'': ''"far, fár; rȧmr, rámr"''&lt;/ref&gt; Small capitals denote a geminate consonant. Ǥ, named ''eng'', denotes {{IPA|/ŋɡ/}}.&lt;ref name="FirstTrEtext"&gt;{{citation| url = http://etext.old.no/gramm/ | title = The First Grammatical Treatise}}, digital reproduction at Old Norse etexts.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The author==
The author is unknown, and is usually referred to as "First Grammarian".{{sfn|Robins|1990|p= 82}} Scholars have hypothesized various identities for the First Grammarian. One probable candidate is Hallr Teitsson (born ca. 1085, died 1150).{{sfn|Benediktsson|1972|p=203}}{{sfn|Haugen|1950|pp= 60–61}} Þóroddr Gamlason has also been suggested.{{sfn|Cleasby|Vigfússon|1874|loc=p.xi, § H., Ⅰ.: Skálda; Referred to simply as "Thorodd" throughout.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon | at = p.390, "Thoroddr" }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gopal Ganesh Agarkar''' (14 July 1856&amp;nbsp;– 17 June 1895) was an [[Indian people|Indian]] [[social reformer]], educationist, and thinker from [[Maharashtra]], [[British India]].

At one time a close associate of [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]], he was a co-founder of educational institutes such as the New English School, the [[Deccan Education Society]] and [[Fergusson College]] along with Tilak, [[Vishnushastri Krushnashastri Chiplunkar|Vishnushastri Chiplunkar]], Mahadev Ballal Namjoshi, V. S. Apte, V. B. Kelkar, M. S. Gole and N. K. Dharap.{{cn|date=July 2017}} He was the first editor of the weekly ''[[Kesari (newspaper)|Kesari]]'' and founder and editor of a periodical, ''[[Sudharak]]''. He was the second Principal of Fergusson College and served that post from August-1892 until his death, aged around 39.

==Early life==
Gopal Ganesh Agarkar was born in a Koknastha Brahman family&lt;ref name="Book-YDPhadke"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bookganga.com/eBooks/Book/4667523133894889872.htm?Book=Shodh-:-Balgopalancha |title=Shodh: Baal-Gopaalancha [शोध: बाळ-गोपाळांचा] |author=Y D Phadke [य. दि. फडके] |date= |work= |publisher=ShreeVidyaa Prakashan, Pune, India |isbn= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 14 July 1856 in [[Tembhu]], a village in [[Karad]] [[taluk]], [[Satara district]], Maharashtra. He was a friend of Nilkanth Tidke&lt;ref name="MNS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&amp;smid=23&amp;pmid=5&amp;id=360 |title=Gopal Ganesh Agarkar |author=Anonymous |date= |work="Social Reformers" |publisher=Maharashtra Navnirman Sena |accessdate=24 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006163512/https://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&amp;smid=23&amp;pmid=5&amp;id=360 |archivedate=6 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agarkar was schooled in Karad and then worked as a clerk in a court there.,In 1878, he got his B. A. degree, and in 1880 was awarded an M.A.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Achievements and philosophy==
He was the first editor of ''Kesari'', a prominent [[Marathi language|Marathi-language]] weekly newspaper that had been founded by Lokmanya Tilak in 1880-81. Ideological differences with Tilak caused him later to leave: they disagreed regarding the primacy of political reform versus social reform; with Agarkar believing that the need for social reform was more immediate. He started his own periodical, ''Sudharak'', in which he campaigned against the injustices of [[untouchability]] and the [[Caste system in India|caste system]]. Agarkar abhorred blind adherence to and glorification of tradition and the past. He supported widow re-marriage. Though Agarkar championed social reforms he tolerated his wife's observation of the traditions of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Tarique"&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Indian History |last=Tarique |first=Author |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill |location=|isbn=978-0-07-066030-4|page=8.10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pcKMD9XWyjAC|accessdate=24 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
Agarkar writes in his biography in the "Futke Nashib" that he was the only social worker who witnessed his own funeral, He has also written a book 'Alankar Mimmansa' (अलंकार मीमांसा).{{Cn|date=July 2017}}

[[File:Herman Satherberg.jpg|thumb|right|Herman Sätherberg]]
'''Karl''' or '''Carl Herman Sätherberg''' (May 19, 1812 in [[Botkyrka socken]] – January 9, 1897 in [[Stockholm]]) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Poetry|poet]] and (orthopedic) [[physician]].

Sätherberg became a medical doctor in 1843 and travelled with the corvette ''Karlskrona'' to the [[Mediterranean]] 1844–1845. The journey is described in the books ''Utflykter på hafvet'' 1-2. In 1847, he succeeded [[Nils Åkerman]] as director of the ''Orthopedic Institute'' in [[Stockholm]], where he remained until 1879. Sätherberg was very active in the development of [[Physical therapy]] in Sweden.

The theme that he was most known for in his poetry was nature, but he also wrote plays and epic poems. His poem ''Blomsterkonungen'', a homage to [[Carl von Linné]], was widely read. He also wrote lyrics for the son of king [[Oscar I of Sweden|Oscar I]] and composer [[Prince Gustaf, Duke of Uppland|Gustav]]. He wrote the lyrics for the very popular song ''Studentsången''.

[[Image:Duenos inscription.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Duenos inscription]], dated to the 6th century BC, shows the earliest known forms of the [[Old Latin alphabet]].]]
The '''[[Latin script]]''' is the most widely used alphabetic writing system in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/331677/Latin-alphabet|title=Latin alphabet|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the standard script of the English language and is often referred to simply as "the alphabet" in English&lt;!--will need to find reference off kindergarten curriculum website or something--&gt;. It is a [[true alphabet]] which originated in the 7th century BC in Italy and has changed continually over the last 2500 years. It has roots in the [[Semitic alphabet]] and its offshoot alphabets, the [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], and [[Etruscan alphabet|Etruscan]]. The phonetic values of some letters [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|changed]], some letters were lost and gained, and several writing styles ("hands") developed. Two such styles, the [[minuscule cursive|minuscule]] and [[majuscule]] hands, were combined into one script with alternate forms for the lower and upper [[Letter case|case letters]]. Due to [[classicism]], modern uppercase letters differ only slightly from their classical counterparts. There are few regional variants.

==Summary of evolution==
The Latin alphabet started out as uppercase [[serif]]ed letters known as [[roman square capitals]]. The lowercase letters evolved through cursive styles that developed to adapt the formerly inscribed alphabet to being written with a pen. Throughout the ages, many dissimilar stylistic variations of each letter have evolved that are still identified as being the same letter.
After the evolution of the alphabet from the Western Greek Alphabet through [[Old Italic alphabet]], G developed from C, the letter J developed from a flourished I, V and U split and the ligature of VV became W, the letter thorn [[Þ]] was introduced from the [[runic alphabet]] but was lost in all languages except Icelandic, and the letter s could be written either as a [[long s]] (ſ) inside a word or as a terminal s at the end or after a long s ([[ß]]) after the 7th century AD, but the long s was generally abandoned in the 19th century.

However, thanks to [[classical revival]], '''Roman capitals''' were reintroduced by [[humanists]] making Latin inscriptions easily legible to modern readers while many medieval [[manuscripts]] are unreadable to an untrained modern reader, due to unfamiliar letterforms, narrow spacing and [[scribal abbreviations|abbreviation marks]] with some exceptions of some marks such as the apostrophe and the exception of '''Carolingian minuscule''' letters (lower caps) which were mistaken for Roman.

Additionally the [[Orthography|phonetic value]] of the letters has changed from its [[Latin spelling and pronunciation|origins]] and is not constant across the languages adopting the Latin alphabet, such as [[English orthography|English]] or [[French orthography|French]], often the orthography does not fully match the phonetics, resulting in [[heterography and homography|Homophonic heterographs]] (words written differently but sounding the same) such as in English and adopting [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] for new sounds, such as sh for [[Voiceless postalveolar fricative]] in English.

==Origin==

{{Main|Old Italic alphabet}}

It is generally held that the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] adopted the western variant of the [[Greek alphabet]] in the 7th century BC from [[Cumae]], a [[Magna Graecia|Greek colony]] in [[southern Italy]]&amp;nbsp;– making the early Latin alphabet one among several [[Old Italic alphabets]] emerging at the time.

From the [[Cumae alphabet]], the [[Old Italic alphabet|Etruscan alphabet]] was derived. The Latins ultimately adopted 21 of the original 26 Etruscan letters.

===Legendary origin account in Hyginus===

[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], who recorded much Roman mythology, mentions in ''Fab. 277'' the legend that it was [[Carmenta]], the [[Cimmerian Sibyl]], who altered fifteen letters of the Greek alphabet to become the Latin alphabet, which her son [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]] introduced into Latium, supposedly 60 years before the [[Trojan War]], but there is no historically sound basis to this tale.

:''"The [[Parcae]], [[Clotho]], [[Lachesis (mythology)|Lachesis]], and [[Atropos]] invented seven Greek letters&amp;nbsp;– A B H T I Y. Others say that Mercury invented them from the flight of cranes, which, when they fly, form letters. [[Palamedes (Greek mythology)|Palamedes]], too, son of [[Nauplius (mythology)|Nauplius]], invented eleven letters; [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], too, invented four letters&amp;nbsp;– Ó E Z PH; [[Epicharmus of Kos|Epicharmus of Sicily]], two&amp;nbsp;– P and PS. The Greek letters Mercury is said to have brought to Egypt, and from Egypt Cadmus took them to Greece. Cadmus in exile from Arcadia, took them to Italy, and his mother Carmenta changed them to Latin to the number of 15. Apollo on the lyre added the rest."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae5.html Hyginus, ''Fabulae'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaic Latin alphabet==
The original Latin alphabet was:
{| class="wikitable"
|+Original Latin alphabet, in the modern equivalent letters
|-
| [[A]] || [[B]] || [[C]] || [[D]] || [[E]] || [[F]] || [[Z]] || [[H]] || [[I]] || [[K]] || [[L]] || [[M]] || [[N]] || [[O]] || [[P]] || [[Q]] || [[R]] || [[S]] || [[T]] || [[V]] || [[X]]
|}

The oldest Latin inscriptions do not distinguish between  {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and  {{IPA|/k/}}, representing both by C, K and Q according to position.  K was used before A; Q was used (if at all) before O or V; C was used elsewhere.  This is explained by the fact that the [[Etruscan language]] did not make this distinction.  C originated as a turned form of Greek Gamma (Γ) and Q from Greek [[Koppa (letter)|Koppa]] (Ϙ).  In later Latin, K survived only in a few forms such as ''Kalendae''; Q survived only before V (representing {{IPA|/kw/}}), and C was used everywhere else.  G was later invented to distinguish between {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and  {{IPA|/k/}}; it was originally simply a C with an additional diacritic.

===Phonetics===
{{Main|Latin spelling and pronunciation}}

* C stood for {{IPA|/ɡ/}}
* I stood for both {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/j/}}.
* V stood for both {{IPA|/u/}} and {{IPA|/w/}}.

==Old Latin period==
{{See|Old Latin}}

[[K]] was marginalized in favour of [[C]], which afterward stood for both /ɡ/ and /k/.

Probably during the 3rd century BC, the [[Z]] was dropped and a new letter [[G]] was placed in its position&amp;nbsp;– according to [[Plutarch]], by [[Spurius Carvilius Ruga]]&amp;nbsp;– so that afterward, C = /k/, G = /ɡ/.

==Classical Latin period==
An attempt by the emperor [[Claudius]] to introduce three [[Claudian letters|additional letters]] was short-lived, but after the conquest of [[Greece]] in the 1st century BC the letters Y and Z were, respectively, adopted and readopted from the Greek alphabet and placed at the end. Now the new Latin alphabet contained 23&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/latin.htm|title=The Latin alphabet|author=|date=|website=www.omniglot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; letters:

Bad paragraph, hidden not deleted for now: please improve! j is not read j in several languages, in latin ivstitiae is read like yustiziae.

Notice the absence of some letters like ''j''.  The Romans used ''i'' in place of ''j''.  For example, an English sentence that features ''j'' like "Justice will bring about peace," would be rendered in Latin as "Erit opus iustitiae pax."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSL1564528320080418?pageNumber=3|title=Pope says unilateral acts undermine United Nations|first=Philip|last=Pullella|date=|website=reuters.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

The Latin names of some of the letters are disputed. In general, however, the Romans did not use the traditional (Semitic-derived) names as in Greek, but adopted the simplified names of the Etruscans, which derived from saying the sounds of the letters: the vowels stood for themselves, the names of the [[stop consonant]] letters were formed by adding the neutral vowel ''e'', which in Latin became {{IPA|/eː/}} (except for K and Q, which were distinguished from C by appending the vowel which followed them in Etruscan orthography), and the names of the [[continuant]] consonants were formed by preceded the sound with {{IPA|/e/}}. X was named {{IPA|/eks/}} rather than {{IPA|/kseː/}}, as {{IPA|/ks/}} could not begin a word in Latin (and possibly Etruscan). When the letter Y was introduced into Latin, it was probably called ''hy'' {{IPA|/hyː/}} as in Greek (the name [[upsilon]] being not yet in use), but was changed to ''i Graeca'' ("Greek i") as Latin speakers had difficulty distinguishing the sounds {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/y/}}. Z was given its Greek name, [[zeta (letter)|zeta]], when it was borrowed.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, 1990. ''Writing Systems: A Linguistic Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt; For the Latin sounds represented by the various letters see [[Latin spelling and pronunciation]]; for the names of the letters in English see [[English alphabet]] and for the sounds in English see [[English phonetics]].

[[Roman cursive]] script, also called [[majuscule]] cursive and capitalis cursive, was the everyday form of handwriting used for writing letters, by merchants writing business accounts, by schoolchildren learning the Latin alphabet, and even by [[Roman Emperor|emperors]] issuing commands. A more formal style of writing was based on [[Roman square capitals]], but cursive was used for quicker, informal writing. It was most commonly used from about the 1st century BC to the 3rd century AD, but it probably existed earlier than that.

===Late Antiquity===
{{Main|Visigothic script|Roman cursive}}
The Latin alphabet spread from [[Italy]], along with the [[Latin|Latin language]], to the lands surrounding the [[Mediterranean Sea]] with the expansion of the [[Roman Empire]]. The eastern half of the Roman Empire, including [[Greece]], [[Asia Minor]], the [[Levant]], and [[Egypt]], continued to use [[Greek language|Greek]] as a [[lingua franca]], but Latin was widely spoken in the western half of the Empire, and as the western [[Romance languages]], including [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]], evolved out of Latin they continued to use and adapt the Latin alphabet.

==Middle Ages==
[[File:Ioanne Arnoldo 1541.PNG|thumb|300px|''De chalcographiae inventione'' (1541, [[Mainz]]) with the 23 letters. [[W]], [[U]] and [[J]] are missing.]]
[[File:Rekenaar 1553.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Jeton]] from [[Nuremberg]], ca. 1553, with 24 letters, W is included.]]
{{Main|Carolingian minuscule|Insular script|Uncial}}
The [[lower case]] (minuscule) letters developed in the Middle Ages from [[Roman cursive#New Roman cursive|New Roman Cursive]] writing, first as the [[uncial]] script, and later as minuscule script. The old Roman letters were retained for formal inscriptions and for emphasis in written documents. The languages that use the Latin alphabet generally use capital letters to begin paragraphs and sentences and for proper nouns. The rules for capitalization have changed over time, and different languages have varied in their rules for capitalization. [[Old English language|Old English]], for example, was rarely written with even proper nouns capitalised; whereas Modern English of the 18th century had frequently all nouns capitalised, in the same way that Modern [[German language|German]] is today.

The use of the letters I and V for both consonants and vowels proved inconvenient as the Latin alphabet was adapted to Germanic and Romance languages. [[W]] originated as a doubled [[V]] (VV) used to represent the sound {{IPA|[w]}} found in [[Old English]] as early as the 7th century. It came into common use in the later 11th century, replacing the runic [[Wynn]] letter which had been used for the same sound. In the Romance languages, the minuscule form of V was a rounded ''u''; from this was derived a rounded capital U for the vowel in the 16th century, while a new, pointed minuscule ''v'' was derived from V for the consonant. In the case of I, a word-final [[Swash (typography)|swash]] form, ''j'', came to be used for the consonant, with the un-swashed form restricted to vowel use. Such conventions were erratic for centuries. J was introduced into English for the consonant in the 17th century (it had been rare as a vowel), but it was not universally considered a distinct letter in the alphabetic order until the 19th century.

The names of the letters were largely unchanged, with the exception of H. As the sound {{IPA|/h/}} disappeared from the Romance languages, the original Latin name ''hā'' became difficult to distinguish from A. Emphatic forms such as {{IPA|[aha]}} and {{IPA|[axxa]}} were used, developing eventually into ''acca'', the direct ancestor of English ''aitch''.&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, 1990. ''Writing Systems: A Linguistic Introduction'', p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Evolution of minuscule.svg|thumb|none|800px|Simplified relationship between various scripts leading to the development of modern lower case of the standard Latin alphabet and that of the modern variants, [[Fraktur (script)|Fraktur]] (used in Germany until recently) and [[Gaelic type|Gaelic]] (Ireland). Several scripts coexisted such as [[half-uncial]] and [[uncial]], which derive from [[Roman cursive]] and [[Greek uncial]], and [[Visigothic script|Visigothic]], [[Merovingian script|Merovingian (Luxeuil variant here)]] and [[Beneventan script|Beneventan]].  The [[Carolingian script]] was the basis for [[blackletter]] and [[humanist sans-serif|humanist]]. What is commonly called "Gothic writing" is technically called blackletter (here [[Textualis|Textualis quadrata]]), and is completed unrelated to Visigothic script. &lt;br&gt;The letter j is i with a [[:wikt:flourish|flourish]]; u and v are the same letter in early scripts and varied according to position in insular half-uncial and caroline minuscule and later scripts; W is a ligature of vv; in insular the [[rune]] ''[[wynn]]'' is used as a w (three other runes in use were the [[Thorn (letter)|''thorn'']] (þ), ''fé'' (ᚠ) as an abbreviation for cattle/goods and ''maðr'' (ᛘ) for man). &lt;br&gt;The letters y and z were rarely used, while þ was written identically to y, so y was dotted to avoid confusion; the dot was adopted for i only after late-caroline (protogothic), and in Beneventan script the [[scribal abbreviation|macron abbreviation]] featured a dot above. &lt;br&gt; Lost variants such as [[r rotunda]], ligatures and [[scribal abbreviation|scribal abbreviation marks]] are omitted, [[long s]] is shown when no terminal s (surviving variant) is present.  &lt;br&gt;[[Humanist sans-serif|Humanist script]] was the basis for venetian [[Typeface|types]] which changed little until today, such as [[Times Roman|Times New Roman]] ([[Serif|a serifed typeface]]))]]

==Typography==
{{Main|History of Western typography}}
With the spread of [[printing]], several styles of Latin [[typography]] emerged with [[font]]s based on various [[Letter case|minuscules]] of the Middle Ages depending on the region. In Germany, starting with [[Johannes Gutenberg]] the commonly used [[typefaces]] were based on [[blackletter]] scripts, a tradition that lasted until the 20th century, an example of the later typefaces used is [[fraktur]].

In [[Italy]], due to the [[Neoclassicism|revival of classical culture]], the heavy gothic styles were soon displaced by ''Venetian'' Latin types, also called [[Antiqua (typeface class)|antiqua]], which were based on the [[Roman square capitals|inscriptional capitals]] on [[ancient Rome|Roman]] buildings and [[monument]]s. However, [[Humanism|humanist]] scholars of the early 15th century mistook [[Carolingian minuscule]] as the authentic writing style of the Romans and redesigned the small Carolingian letter, lengthening ascenders and descenders, and adding incised serifs and finishing strokes to integrate them with the Roman capitals. By the time [[movable type|moveable type]] reached Italy several decades later, the humanistic writing had evolved into a consistent model known as '''humanistic minuscule''', which served as the basis for Venetian typeface.

==Handwriting==
{{Main|Western calligraphy}}

===Roman cursive===
{{Main|Roman cursive}}
In addition to the aforementioned square capitals used in architecture, in the Roman empire and in the Middle Ages for rapidly written vernacular documents [[roman cursive]] or even a form of shorthand, called [[tironian notes]], were used.

===Secretary hand===
{{Main|Secretary hand}}
Whereas the meticulously drawn textualis quadrata was the most common script for religious works, starting from the 13th century a common style of handwriting for vernacular work, which were written at speed, was [[Secretary hand]], a [[cursive]] script, which features amongst several ligatures and contraction distinctive strong "elephant's ear" ascenders and descenders&lt;ref&gt;The Calligrapher's Bible: 100 Complete Alphabets and How to Draw Them, David Harris, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italic script===
{{Main|Italic script}}
In the 16th–17th century secretary hand was slowly replaced by [[italic script]]s, a semi-cursive group of scripts. Early italic hand, dating from the 15th century, was based on [[humanist minuscule]] with pronounced serifs, a [[A|single story a]], [[G|open tailed g]], slight forward slope and in the late renaissance could have been written with [[flourishes]] and [[swashes]].
Italic hand developed into Cancelleresca (chancery) corsiva (also an italic script) used for [[Holy See|Vatican]] documents from the middle of the 16th century, which featured a more prominent slope and lavish swashes (often curled) on capitals.&lt;!--same ref as before--&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Additionally this script led to the [[italic type]] in typography, which could be used within a text written in [[Roman type]] (''e.g.'' "The [[Biological classification|taxonomic name]] of the red fox is ''Vulpes vulpes''") and thanks to [[Edward Johnston]] this script has enjoyed a revival in the 20th century.&lt;br&gt;
'''Note:''' "Italic hand" (a semi-cursive script), "Ital''ian'' hand" (a copperplate cursive script) and "Italic ''type''" (a typeface) are different concepts.

===Copperplate and cursive===
{{Main|Copperplate script|cursive}}
From the italic scripts after the 16th century, more cursive forms evolved and were known as [[Copperplate script]] due to way the calligraphy books were printed and reached their height in the 18–19th century. The main examples were the Italian hand and the English round-hand, which in Britain were taught to men and women respectively, these scripts feature flowing letters which could be written with a single pen lift (with the exception of x and the marks added after writing the word which were dots on i and j and the bar of the ascender of t) with straight or looped ascenders and descenders. In Italy Italian hand is instead known as "posata" (posed).
Several national styles of cursive were developed, such as [[Spencerian Script]] in the US. Despite the recent decline, in several countries cursive scripts are still taught in schools today{{Examples|date=September 2010}}, often modified to be more similar to roman type letters (tailless z, w-like instead of a 90° CW turned s for w, capitals without "belly" or swashes, forward-facing capital F etc.).

{{Main|Spread of the Latin script}}
With the spread of [[Western Christianity]] the Latin alphabet spread to the peoples of [[northern Europe]] who spoke [[Germanic languages]], displacing their earlier [[Runic alphabet]]s, as well as to the speakers of [[Baltic languages]], such as [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]], and several (non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]) [[Uralic languages]], most notably [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. During the [[Middle Ages]] the Latin alphabet also came into use among the peoples speaking [[West Slavic languages]], including the ancestors of modern [[Poles]], [[Czechs]], [[Croats]], [[Slovenes]], and [[Slovaks]], as these peoples adopted Roman Catholicism. Speakers of [[East Slavic languages]] generally adopted both [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] and [[Cyrillic script]].

As late as 1492, the Latin alphabet was limited primarily to the languages spoken in western, northern and [[central Europe]]. The [[Orthodox Christian]] Slavs of eastern and [[southeastern Europe]] mostly used the Cyrillic alphabet, and the Greek alphabet was still in use by Greek-speakers around the eastern Mediterranean. The [[Arabic alphabet]] was widespread within Islam, both among [[Arab]]s and non-Arab nations like the [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesians]], [[Malay people|Malays]], and [[Turkic peoples]]. Most of the rest of Asia used a variety of [[Brahmic family|Brahmic alphabets]] or the [[Chinese script]].

[[Image:Latin alphabet world distribution.svg|thumb|right|350px|World distribution of the Latin alphabet. The dark green areas shows the countries where this alphabet is the sole main script. The light green shows the countries where the alphabet co-exists with other scripts.]]

By the 18th century, the standard Latin alphabet comprised the 26 letters we are familiar with today.

During [[colonialism]], the alphabet began its spread around the world, being employed for previously unwritten languages, notably in the wake of [[Christianization]], being used in [[Bible translations]]. It spread to [[the Americas]], [[Australia]], and parts of [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and the Pacific, along with the [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] languages.

In the late 18th century, the [[Romania]]ns adopted the Latin alphabet; although [[Romanian language|Romanian]] is a Romance language, the Romanians were predominantly Orthodox Christians, and until the 19th century the Church used the [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet]]. [[Vietnam]], under French rule, adapted the Latin alphabet for [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], which had previously used Chinese characters. The Latin alphabet is also used for many [[Austronesian languages]], including [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and the other [[languages of the Philippines]], and the official [[Bahasa Malaysia|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], replacing earlier Arabic and indigenous Brahmic alphabets.

In 1928, as part of [[Kemal Atatürk]]'s reforms, [[Turkey]] adopted the Latin alphabet for the [[Turkish language]], replacing the Arabic alphabet. Most of [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking peoples of the former [[USSR]], including [[Tatars]], [[Bashkirs]], [[Azeri]], [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] and others, used the [[Uniform Turkic alphabet]] in the 1930s. In the 1940s all those alphabets were replaced by Cyrillic. After the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, several of the newly independent Turkic-speaking republics adopted the Latin alphabet, replacing Cyrillic. [[Azerbaijan]], [[Uzbekistan]], and [[Turkmenistan]] have officially adopted the Latin alphabet for [[Azeri language|Azeri]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], respectively. In the 1970s, the [[People's Republic of China]] developed an official transliteration of [[Mandarin Chinese]] into the Latin alphabet, called [[Pinyin]], used to aid children and foreigners in learning the pronunciation of Chinese characters. Aside from that, Chinese characters are used for reading and writing.

[[West Slavic languages|West Slavic]] and most [[South Slavic languages]] use the Latin alphabet rather than the [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], a reflection of the dominant religion practiced among those peoples.  Among these, [[Polish language|Polish]] uses a variety of diacritics and digraphs to represent special phonetic values, as well as [[l with stroke]]&amp;nbsp;– ł&amp;nbsp;– for a w-like sound.  [[Czech language|Czech]] uses [[diacritic]]s as in Dvořák&amp;nbsp;– the term [[háček]] ("little hook") is Czech.  [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and the Latin version of [[Serbian language|Serbian]] use carons, or háčeks, in č, š, ž, an [[Acute accent|acute]] in ć and a [[bar (diacritic)|bar]] in đ.  The languages of [[Eastern Orthodox]] Slavs generally use Cyrillic instead which is much closer to the Greek alphabet. [[Serbian language|Serbian]], however, actively uses both alphabets.

An '''independent''' or '''nonpartisan politician''' is an individual [[politician]] not affiliated with any [[political party]]. There are numerous reasons why someone may stand for office as an independent.
* Independents may support policies which are different from those of the major political parties.
* In some parts of the world, electors may have a tradition of electing independents, so standing for a political party is a disadvantage.
* In some countries (such as [[Russia]]), a political party can only be registered if it has a large number of members in more than one region, but in certain regions only a minority of electors support the major parties.
* In some countries (including [[Kuwait]]), political parties are [[wikt:unlawful|unlawful]] and all candidates thus stand as independents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al-Zumai|first=Fahad|date=June 2013|title= Kuwait's political impasse and rent-seeking behaviour: A call for institutional reform|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/middleEastCentre/kuwait/documents/Kuwaits-political-impasse-and-rent-seking-behaviour.pdf|journal=Kuwait Programme on Development, Governance and Globalisation in the Gulf States|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|volume=29|pages=1–33|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In some countries where politics is otherwise traditionally partisan, such as the [[United States]], subnational bodies and offices such as the [[Nebraska State Legislature]] and various directly-elected judicial and executive positions are nonpartisan and require politicians to abstain from running for office as part of a political party, even if they may be a member of one.
* In some countries where politics is otherwise traditionally partisan, such as [[Mongolia]], the incumbent President must always be an independent and cannot run for reelection as a member of a political party.

Some independent politicians may be associated with a political party, perhaps as former members of it, or else have views that align with it, but choose not to stand in its name, or are unable to do so because the party in question has selected another candidate. Others may belong to or support a political party at the national level but believe they should not formally represent it (and thus be subject to its policies) at another level.

In running for public office, independents sometimes choose to form a party or alliance with other independents, and may formally register their party or alliance. Even where the word "independent" is used, such alliances have much in common with a political party, especially if there is an organization which needs to approve the "independent" candidates.

==Australia==
{{main|Independent politicians in Australia}}
Independents are a recurrent feature of the federal [[Parliament of Australia]], and they are more commonly elected to state parliaments. There have been up to five independents in every federal parliament since 1990, and independents have won twenty-eight times during national elections in that time. A large proportion of independents are former members of one of Australia's four main parties, the [[Australian Labor Party]], the [[Liberal Party of Australia]], the [[Australian Greens]], or the [[National Party of Australia]]. In 2013 a political party named the [[Australian Independents]] was registered with the [[Australian Electoral Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Registered_parties/australian-independents.htm|title=Australian Independents|work=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As at 2017, two independents sit in the [[Australian House of Representatives]], [[Andrew Wilkie]] from [[Division of Denison|Denison]] in [[Tasmania]] (former [[Australian Greens|Greens]] candidate) and [[Cathy McGowan (politician)|Cathy McGowan]] from [[Division of Indi|Indi]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

Independent [[Australian Senate|Senators]] are quite rare. In modern politics, independent [[Brian Harradine]] served from 1975 to 2005 with considerable influence at times. [[Nick Xenophon]] has been the only elected independent Senator since his election to the Senate at the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]]. Xenophon was re-elected for another six-year term at the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/federal-election-2013/results/senate/sa/|title=Senate Results: South Australia|work=ABC News|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|DLP]] Senator [[John Madigan (Australian politician)|John Madigan]] became an independent Senator in September 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=217571|title=Senator John Madigan|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Palmer United Party|PUP]] Senators [[Jacqui Lambie]] and [[Glenn Lazarus]] became independent Senators in November 2014 and March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=250026|title=Senator Jacqui Lambie|publisher=APH|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Senator Glenn Lazarus|publisher=APH}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brazil==
The independent politicians are not allowed to run for offices in Brazil. The Constitution of 1988, in its Article 14, §3rd, item V, says that "Are conditions for eligibility: V - party affiliation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/constituicaocompilado.htm|title=Constituição da República Federativa do Brasil de 1988|publisher=Palácio do Planalto|language=pt|date=5 October 1988|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Proposal Amendment to the Constitution (PEC) no. 6/2015, authored by senator [[José Reguffe]], would allow the independent candidacy of individuals who have the support of at least 1% of the electors able to vote in the region (city, state or country, depending on the election) in which the candidate is running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.senado.leg.br/noticias/materias/2015/02/10/pec-propoe-candidatura-avulsa-independente-de-filiacao-partidaria|title=PEC permite candidatura avulsa a cargos eletivos|publisher=Senado Notícias|language=pt|date=10 February 2015|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www25.senado.leg.br/web/atividade/materias/-/materia/119631|title=Proposta de Emenda à Constituição nº6, de 2015|publisher=Senado Federal|author=José Reguffe|language=pt|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, members of the legislative and executive can leave their respective parties after elected, as is the case of senator Reguffe, who left the [[Democratic Labour Party (Brazil)|Democratic Labour Party]] (PDT) in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www25.senado.leg.br/web/senadores/senador/-/perfil/5236|title=Senador Reguffe|publisher=Senado Federal|language=pt|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bulgaria==
The [[President of Bulgaria]] [[Rumen Radev]] is an independent with support from the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]. Radev was elected in the [[Bulgarian presidential election, 2016|2016 election]].

==Canada==
{{see also|Independent Liberal|Independent Conservative}}
Independent Members of Parliament were numerous in the last decades of the 19th century but diminished as the party system solidified. It remained common, however, to have a small number of [[Independent Liberal]] or [[Independent Conservative]] MPs into the 1950s.

Independent politicians have held considerable sway in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] in recent years as Canada has been governed by successive [[minority government]]s with independent [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) sometimes sharing in the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]].

In the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]], [[Chuck Cadman]] was elected to federal parliament as an independent MP representing the [[British Columbia]] [[Riding (division)|riding]] of [[Surrey North]]. Cadman had previously represented that riding on behalf of the [[Reform Party of Canada]] and [[Canadian Alliance]], but after the Canadian Alliance merged with the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] to form the new [[Conservative Party of Canada]] in 2003, Cadman lost the nomination to represent the Conservative Party in that riding to [[Jasbir Singh Cheema]]. Cadman then stood in the subsequent election as an independent and defeated Cheema, as well as the candidates of other Canadian parties, by a significant margin.

In the spring of 2005, Cadman cast the tying vote in favour of a budget supported by the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] government of [[Paul Martin]] as well as the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] (NDP), but opposed by the opposition Conservatives and [[Bloc Québécois]].  Two other independents also voted on that budget. [[Carolyn Parrish]], independent MP for [[Mississauga—Erindale]], had recently been kicked out of the Liberal Party for criticizing US president George W Bush, but nonetheless sided with the Liberals on the budget vote. [[David Kilgour]] independent MP for [[Edmonton—Mill Woods—Beaumont]], had previously quit the Liberal caucus and voted with the opposition parties against the budget. The tie vote required the [[Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada|Speaker of the House]] [[Peter Milliken]] to cast the deciding vote, and he did so in favor of the budget, allowing the government to survive.

Cadman was terminally ill with [[cancer]] at the time he cast his crucial vote, and he died later in 2005. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2006|2006 federal election]], his riding was won by NDP candidate [[Penny Priddy]]. Neither Parrish nor Kilgour (nor [[Pat O'Brien (Canadian politician)|Pat O'Brien]], MP for [[London—Fanshawe]], who quit the Liberal Party to sit as an independent after the 2005 budget vote) stood for re-election in 2006.

Another independent candidate, [[André Arthur]], was elected in the [[Quebec]] riding of [[Portneuf—Jacques-Cartier]] in 2006, and was the only independent to win a seat in that election. He was re-elected in the [[Canadian federal election, 2008|October 14, 2008 federal election]]. Former [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] and [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] MP [[Bill Casey]], who was expelled from the Conservative Party for voting against the 2007 Federal Budget, also ran as an independent in the 2008 election, easily retaining his seat.

Candidates in federal elections who are not affiliated with a party have two options: independent or no affiliation. In the former case, they appear on the ballot with "Independent" following their name; in the second case, they appear with their name only. The two options are otherwise equivalent.

The territorial legislatures of the [[Northwest Territories]] and [[Nunavut]] are [[consensus government]]s with no political parties, so that all members sit as independents. There are a few independent members of the other subnational legislatures, which are similar in principle to the federal House of Commons; for example, in the [[British Columbia general election, 2009|2009 election]] in [[British Columbia]], independent candidate [[Vicki Huntington]] narrowly defeated incumbent [[Attorney General of British Columbia|Attorney General]] [[Wally Oppal]] as MLA for [[Delta South]].

True independents should not be confused with members of parties without [[official party status]] in a legislature. Most legislatures provide that a party must hold a certain number of seats to enjoy certain advantages in staffing, budget, ability to ask questions in [[Question Period]], and the like. Although members whose parties do not hold this status may have no more privileges than independent members, they remain representatives of political parties.

Also, members who are expelled from or choose to leave their party caucus may sit as "Independent" with some designation, e.g., "Independent Liberal" or "Independent Conservative", to indicate their affiliation to that party even if it is not officially recognized.

Election as an independent is far more common at the municipal level. Many municipalities have no tradition of political parties.

==Croatia==

After an inconclusive election in [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2015|2015]], [[Tihomir Orešković (politician)|Tihomir Orešković]] was named the first non-partisan [[Prime Minister of Croatia]].

==Finland==
After serving six years on his first term as [[President of Finland]] in the [[National Coalition Party]] from 2012 to 2018, [[Sauli Niinistö]] was elected for his second term in 2018 after running as an independent candidate.

==France==
In France, independent politicians are frequently categorised as ''sans étiquette'' ("without label") in municipal or district elections. However, it is rare to have independent politicians at national level, notably [[José Bové]] in the 2007 presidential election. [[Emmanuel Macron]] was an independent politician as Minister, but formed his own party to stand in the 2016 presidential election.

In 1920, [[Alexandre Millerand]] was elected [[President of France|president of the Republic]] under the banner "without label".

From 2001 to 2008 "without label" was no longer used in the nomenclature of the [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Ministry of the Interior]]. Candidates and lists presenting themselves as "without label" are classified in DVG (various left), DVD (various right), DVC (various center) or AUT (other) according to their political sensitivity. Therefore, from 2008 onwards, the DIV (miscellaneous) or the LDIV code for the "miscellaneous" list has been created to group unclassifiable or categorical interests and, by default, mayors without a declared label claiming No political sensitivity, be it left, center or right. The AUT (other) grade replaces the DIV grade without changing its definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/basile/visio.do?id=qSEQ080103109|title=Site du sénat|website=www.senat.fr|access-date=2017-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Georgia==

On 28 October [[Salome Zurabishvili]] runs in [[Georgian presidential election, 2018|the 2018 presidential elections]] as an independent candidate to become first-ever female president of Georgia.

==Germany==
[[Joachim Gauck]], [[President of Germany]] from March 2012 to March 2017 and the first Federal President without party affiliation, was to date the most prominent Independent politician. In the [[German presidential election, 2010|German presidential election of 2010]] he was the candidate of the  [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] and [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Greens]], in [[German presidential election, 2012|2012]] the candidate of all major parties except [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]]. His presidency—though his powers are limited—constitutes an exception, as Independent politicians have rarely held high office in German history, at least not since [[World War II]]. It has nevertheless happened that a presidential candidate without any chances of election by the [[Federal Convention (Germany)|Federal Convention]] was not a party member: for example, when in 1984 the Greens came up with the writer [[Luise Rinser]].

In the [[Bundestag]] parliament nearly all deputies belong to a political party. The voting system of [[mixed-member proportional representation|personalized proportional representation]] (since 1949) allows any individual holding the [[suffrage|passive right to vote]] to stand for a direct [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] in the [[electoral districts]]—half of the seats in parliament are distributed by districts according to a [[plurality voting system]]. Such a candidate has to present 200 signatures in favor of his candidacy, the same as a candidate of a party that had no parliamentary presentation previously. The first [[West German federal election, 1949|Bundestag election in 1949]] saw three independents elected; since then, no party-independent candidate has won a seat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wahlrecht.de/lexikon/parteilose.html Unabhängige Direktkandidaten], last seen October 13th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[States of Germany|state]] level, the situation is more or less the same: only party members have a real chance to be elected to a [[Landtag]] legislature, and state ministers without party membership are just as rare as at the federal level. However, in [[local election]]s it may occur that an independent politician is elected deputy to [[Districts of Germany|districts]]', cities' and municipalities' assemblies, as well as member of a [[city council]] or even [[mayor]], especially in [[Northern Germany]]. In recent years, independents have formed [[Free Voters]] associations to enter Landtag parliaments, so far only successful in [[Landtag of Bavaria|Bavaria]].

An independent [[Member of Parliament|MP]], who also is not a member of a voters' association, holds the status of a ''[[non-inscrit]]'' ({{lang-de|fraktionsloser Abgeordneter}}) not affiliated to any [[parliamentary group]]. A representative who leaves his party (and his parliamentary group) and does not join another becomes an independent and ''non-inscrit''. In 1989 the Bundestag MP [[Thomas Wüppesahl]], who had left the Green Party in 1987 and was excluded from the Green parliamentary group the next year, obtained more rights as a non-inscrit, for example more talking time and representation in a subcommittee, when the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]] decided partially in his favor.

After the [[Unification of Germany|German unification]] of 1871, the first [[Chancellor of Germany|Reich Chancellors]] ([[head of government|heads of government]]) ''de jure'' served as [[executive officer]]s of the [[German Empire|German Imperial states]] as non-partisans, usually recruited from the traditional bureaucratic, aristocratic and/or military elites. In the fierce political conflicts during the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] period after [[World War I]], several chancellors and Reich Ministers also had no party affiliation: these chancellors were [[Wilhelm Cuno]] (1922–1923), [[Hans Luther]] (1925–1926), the former [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre]] politician [[Franz von Papen]] (1932), and [[Kurt von Schleicher]] (1932–1933). The last two [[Cabinet of Germany|cabinets]] appointed by Reich President [[Paul von Hindenburg]], a non-partisan (though strongly [[Conservatism in Germany|Conservative]]) himself, were regarded as apolitical cabinets of experts with regard to the rise of the [[Nazi Party]]; many of the ministers were not party members.

Since World War II, only two ministers of (West) German cabinets have not been party members, though "on the ticket" of the major party in the coalition, the Social Democrats: Education Minister [[Hans Leussink]] (1969–1972), and Minister of Economy [[Werner Müller (politician)|Werner Müller]] (1998–2002). Minister of Justice [[Klaus Kinkel]] only shortly after his appointment joined the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democrats]] in 1991. A special case is the former Federal Minister and Chancellor [[Ludwig Erhard]], whose affiliation with the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) has not been conclusively established: although he served as Minister of Economics from 1949 to 1963 and as Federal Chancellor from 1963 to 1966, and was even elected CDU [[party chair]]man in 1966, it seems that he never signed a membership form or paid contributions. Researches by ''[[Der Stern]]'' magazine have revealed a record at the CDU party archives created only in 1968, with the faked date of entry of early March 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/cdu-altkanzler-ludwig-erhard-war-nie-cdu-mitglied-587764.html Stern: Ludwig Erhard war nie CDU-Mitglied], April 25th, 2007, last seen August 7th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hong Kong==
More than half of Hong Kong's [[Legislative Council (Hong Kong)|Legislative Council]] is made up of independents, or members whose political groups are represented by one sole member in the legislature. They are common in [[Functional constituency (Hong Kong)|functional constituencies]], and are not rare among [[geographical constituencies]].

==Iceland==
The [[President of Iceland]] (currently [[Guðni Th. Jóhannesson]]) is independent.

==India==
Independent candidate contest elections on the basis of their personal appeal or to promote an ideology different from any party. Some are also run as independent candidates after being sidelined by political rivals within their own party, or to ensure that a rival candidate is not elected. While some are genuine candidates, others have been criticised as dummy candidates put forward by political parties to get around the spending ceiling imposed by the [[Election Commission of India|Election Commission]], or to confuse voters by using party names similar to those of another candidate. {{Citation needed|date = December 2015}}

==Ireland==
After the [[Irish general election, 2016|Irish general election in 2016]], there were 19 independent [[Teachtaí Dála|TDs]] (Members of Parliament) in the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] (the lower house of the Irish parliament), representing 12% of the total. 4 TDs also sit for a registered party called [[Independents4Change]]. A grouping of independents, the [[Independent Alliance (Ireland)|Independent Alliance]] has agreed to support the minority Government with a number of other individual independents similarly agreeing and receiving cabinet positions.

There are fourteen independent senators in the [[Members of the 25th Seanad|25th]] [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]] (the upper house of the Irish parliament), representing 23% of the total. Three of these are elected by the graduates of the [[National University of Ireland]] and two from [[Trinity College Dublin|Dublin University]]. There are also five independent senators who were nominated by the [[Taoiseach]] and four elected by the technical panels.

Both of these are record highs for independents

==Italy==
The Prime Ministers [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] (1993–1994), [[Lamberto Dini]] (1995–1996), [[Giuliano Amato]] (2000–2001), [[Mario Monti]] (2011–2013) and [[Giuseppe Conte]] (2018–present) were independent when they were in office. Ciampi was also the [[President of the Italian Republic]] between 1999 and 2006.

==Kosovo==
In [[Kosovo]],{{ref label|status|a|}} [[Atifete Jahjaga]] was elected the first female and Independent [[President]] of Kosovo. She was also the first female and independent elected leader in the whole of the [[Balkans]].

==Malaysia==
Independents have rarely been elected to the [[Dewan Rakyat]] and state legislative assemblies. In Malaysian elections, many independent candidates lose their election deposit because they had failed to secure at least 12.5% or one-eighth of the total votes cast. Independent [[List of members of the Dewan Negara|Senators]] are quite rare.

In 2010, a group of independent MPs who were sacked from the [[People's Justice Party]] formed a political block called ''Konsensus Bebas''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://weechookeong.com/2010/06/07/konsensus-bebas-formed/ Formation of KONSENSUS BEBAS] (media statement)&lt;/ref&gt; The members were [[Zahrain Mohamed Hashim]] (Bayan Baru), [[Wee Choo Keong]] (Wangsa Maju), [[Zulkifli Noordin]] (Kulim-Bandar Bharu), [[Tan Tee Beng]] (Nibong Tebal) dan [[Mohsin Fadzli Samsuri]] (Bagan Serai). It did not last beyond the 12th General Elections.

{{as of|2018}}, five independent politician sits in the [[Dewan Rakyat]].

==Mexico==
[[Jaime Rodríguez Calderón|Jaime Heliodoro Rodríguez Calderón]] (born in 1957), sometimes referred to by his nickname "El Bronco", is a [[Mexico|Mexican]] politician who is the current governor for the northern state of [[Nuevo León]] and holds no political party affiliation. {{as of|2015|June|7|df=US}} elected Governor for Nuevo León, making history as the first independent candidate to win in the country.

==New Zealand==
Originally, there were no recognised parties in the New Zealand parliament, although loose groupings did exist informally (initially between supporters of central government versus provincial governments, and later between liberals and conservatives). The foundation of formal political parties, starting at the end of the 19th century, considerably diminished the number of unaffiliated politicians, although a smaller number of independent candidates continued to be elected up until the 1940s. Since then, however, there have been relatively few independent politicians in Parliament. No independent candidate has won or held a seat in a general election since [[New Zealand general election, 1943|1943]], although two independent candidates have been successful in [[by-election]]s (in all cases after having held the seats in question as partisan candidates up until that point). Other politicians have become independents in the course of a parliamentary term, but not been voted into office as such.

The last person to be directly elected to Parliament as an independent in New Zealand was [[Winston Peters]], who won the {{By-election link|Tauranga|1993}} in {{NZ electorate link|Tauranga}} electorate as an independent after having previously held it a member of the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]. By the time of the [[New Zealand general election, 1993|next general election]], he had formed his own party ([[New Zealand First]]), and thus was no longer standing as an independent. Since that time, the only independents in Parliament have been people who quit or were expelled from their original party  but retained their seats without going through a by-election. Some have gone on to found or co-found their own parties, with varying levels of success — examples include [[Peter Dunne]], [[Taito Phillip Field]], [[Gordon Copeland]], [[Tau Henare]], and [[Alamein Kopu]]. Others have joined parties which were then outside Parliament, such as [[Frank Grover]] and [[Tuariki Delamere]].

There were two independent MPs in the [[49th New Zealand Parliament|last Parliament]]; [[Chris Carter (politician)|Chris Carter]] and [[Hone Harawira]]. Carter became an independent after his criticisms of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]'s leadership resulted in his being expelled from the Labour caucus, while Harawira resigned from the [[Māori Party]] and, after a short period as an independent, also resigned as an MP in order to force the {{By-election link|Te Tai Tokerau|2011}} when he was re-elected as representative of his new political party, [[Mana Party (New Zealand)|Mana]] and retained the seat in the 2011 General Election. There are also two parties other which have only a single MP  [[United Future]] with [[Peter Dunne]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] with [[David Seymour (politician)|David Seymour]]. Neither Dunne nor Seymour are classed as independents — Dunne's presence in Parliament is due to personal votes in his home electorate, and Seymour's presence is as the sole elected MP of ACT because of a collapse in their support in the {{NZ election link|2011}}. In the [[50th New Zealand Parliament]] there was one independent MP: [[Brendan Horan]], a former New Zealand First MP who was expelled from his party because of allegations of misappropriation of family assets.

Peter Dunne effectively became an Independent MP for a short period after his United Future political party was deregistered on 25 June 2013 by the Electoral Commission, as the party no longer had the required minimum of 500 members. The party was subsequently re-registered.

==Niue==
In [[Niue]], there have been no political parties since 2003, when the [[Niue People's Party]] disbanded, and all politicians are ''de facto'' independents. The government depends on an informal coalition.

==Pakistan==
[[Pakistan]] is a Democratic country and also has Independent politician standing in elections. Pakistan's Parliament has  [[Pakistani general election, 2008|General Elections, 2008]] Elected 30 Members. In Election 2011 has won the 4 candidates in National Assembly.In General Election 2013, 9 seats won by independents.

==Philippines==
[[Noli de Castro]], the [[Philippines]]' former [[Vice President of the Philippines|vice president]], [[Philippine general election, 2001|ran as senator]] in 2001 with no political party affiliation. He was a guest candidate of the opposition [[Pwersa ng Masang Pilipino|Pwersa ng Masa coalition]] but he never joined their campaign rallies. He won in the senate race with the highest votes (then) in Philippine history. In 2004, he ran [[Philippine presidential election, 2004|as vice president]] as a guest candidate of the administration [[Koalisyon ng Katapatan at Karanasan sa Kinabukasan|K-4 coalition]] and won with just under majority of the vote.

Starting in 2001, several [[Senate of the Philippines|senators]] had also resigned from their respective parties to become independents; at the start of the [[15th Congress of the Philippines|15th Congress]], there were more independent senators than any other single political party. However, in contesting elections, all elected independents had been members of either the administration or the opposition coalition, until in the [[Philippine Senate election, 2007|2007 Senate election]] when [[Gregorio Honasan]] (a former senator) was elected as an independent while not a being member of any coalition. Honasan was earlier [[Philippine Senate election, 1995|elected in 1995]] as an independent candidate and being adopted by the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]]-led coalition to become the first elected independent senator since [[Magnolia Antonino]] in [[Philippine Senate election, 1967|1967]], although Antonino was a guest candidate of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] then.

In the local level, former priest [[Eddie Panlilio]] was elected as governor of [[Pampanga]] in 2007, defeating two administration candidates. When Panlilio eventually transferred to the Liberal Party in time for the 2010 election, it was ruled that he was beaten in the 2007 election; in 2010, he was defeated.

In the [[Philippine House of Representatives elections, 2010|2010 House of Representatives elections]], seven independents were elected, although all but two joined a political party after the elections.

In contesting elections, independent candidates are required by law to spend less than candidates nominated by a party.

==Poland==
The [[Poland|Polish]] [[Sejm]] is elected by party-list ordination, which does not allow lone candidates to run, although since 2001 there has been a possibility to create non-partisan ''Voters' Electoral Committee'' (pol. ''KWW'', ''komitet wyborczy wyborców''); they are by almost any means party lists, but no officially registered party is behind them. They can be unregistered parties, e.g. [[Kukiz'15]], or non-partisan movements, although the latter never reached the 5% threshold. National minorities candidates also form Voters' Electoral Committees (like [[German Minority Electoral Committee]], represented in Sejm since 1991), but they do not have to reach the nationwide threshold. However, during a Sejm term many members switch parties or become independents.

Tickets like [[Civic Platform]] during the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2001|2001 election]] were formally non-partisan, Civic Platform was widely viewed as a de facto political party, as it is now.

The situation in the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] is different, as the voting system allows independents to run as single candidates and some are elected in their own right. In the last parliamentary election ([[Polish parliamentary election, 2015|2015]]) four independents won seats in the Senate.

Three [[President of Poland|Presidents]] since 1990 have technically been independents. [[Lech Wałęsa]] was not an endorsed candidate of any party, but the chairman of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] and he was elected without full support of this union (Solidarity votes split between him and [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]]). [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] was a leader of the [[Social Democracy of the Republic of Poland]], but formally resigned from the party after he was elected, as did [[Lech Kaczyński]], who was the first leader of [[Law and Justice]], [[Bronisław Komorowski]] ([[Civic Platform|PO]]) and [[Andrzej Duda]] ([[Law and Justice|PiS]]). The resignation is required because the Constitution says that the president shall hold no other offices nor discharge any public functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sejm.gov.pl/prawo/konst/angielski/konse.htm#5 |title=The Constitution of the Republic of Poland |publisher=Sejm |accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aforementioned presidents often participated in their party's campaigns (e.g. Andrzej Duda in the Law and Justice campaign three months after his resignation from the party).

==Portugal==
Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the current President of Portugal since 6 March 2016, was elected on 24 January 2016 as an independent.

==Russia==
All of Russia's [[President of Russia|Presidents]] have been independents. Former president [[Dmitry Medvedev]] declined an offer to join [[United Russia]], saying that he believes the President should be an independent so that he serves the interests of the country rather than his political party.

[[Vladimir Putin]], the current president of Russia, was the head of the [[United Russia]] party until 26 May 2012, but even then was not its member, thus formally was and still is independent.

==Republic of China==
After [[Taiwanese local elections, 2018]], there is only one independent local head:
* [[Ko Wen-je]], Mayor of [[Taipei]].

==United Kingdom==

The [[Registration of Political Parties Act 1998]] laid down the first specific rules in the United Kingdom relating to the use of the term 'independent' by election candidates. That Act was repealed with most of its contents covered by Part II of the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]]. Candidates standing for United Kingdom local elections and United Kingdom parliamentary elections, including the devolved assemblies, can use the name of a registered political party, or the term 'Independent' (or its Welsh language equivalent ''annibynol'') or no ballot paper description at all&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction to standing as a candidate|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/164109/intro-candidate.pdf|publisher=Electoral Commission|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electoral Administration Bill|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmbills/050/en/06050x-c.htm|website=United Kingdom parliament|publisher=United Kingdom parliament|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (this latter choice was used, for example, by David Icke at the [[Haltemprice and Howden by-election, 2008]]).

Some groups in the United Kingdom who are not affiliated to any national or regional party have registered locality-based political parties. Some English examples are the [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern]], the [[Epsom and Ewell Residents Association]], the [[Devizes Guardians]], the [[Derwentside Independents]], and the East Yorkshire Independents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.TheEYIP.co.uk|title=History of East YorkshireLearn about East Yorkshire|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of Commons===
{{see also|List of UK minor party and independent MPs elected}}
Before the twentieth century it was fairly common for independents to be elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], but there have been very few since 1945.

[[S. O. Davies]], the veteran [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP held his [[Merthyr Tydfil]] seat in the General Election of 1970, standing as an independent, after he had been deselected by the Labour Party.

The journalist [[Martin Bell]] was elected at [[Tatton (UK Parliament constituency)|Tatton]] in the [[United Kingdom general election 1997|General Election of 1997]], having stood on an anti-corruption platform. He was the first independent to be newly elected to the Commons since 1951.&lt;ref name="GuardianMartinBell"&gt;[[Martin Bell]]'s 1997 election was the first election of an Independent in the UK since 1951: {{cite news |
url=https://www.theguardian.com/global/2007/jun/03/martinbell | title=Martin Bell Profile | publisher=Guardian | accessdate=October 18, 2012 | location=London | date=3 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stood unsuccessfully in a different constituency in 2001.

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 General Election]], [[Richard Taylor (UK politician)|Dr Richard Taylor]] of the [[Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern]] party was elected for the constituency of [[Wyre Forest (UK Parliament constituency)|Wyre Forest]].

Two independent (or local party) members of parliament were elected in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 election]], although both were defeated five years later.

At the same General Election, [[Peter Law]] was elected as an independent at [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent]]. Law died on 25 April 2006: the resulting [[Blaenau Gwent by-elections, 2006|by-election]] elected [[Dai Davies (politician)|Dai Davies]] of the local party [[Blaenau Gwent People's Voice]]. The by-election was unusual as it was the first time in over eighty years that an independent had held a seat previously occupied by another independent.

Also at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 General Election]] Richard Taylor was re-elected for Wyre Forest. This was notable for the fact that he was the only independent in recent times to have been elected for a second term.

Only one independent was elected to the Commons in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010]], [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 elections]], [[Sylvia Hermon]], the Member for [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]], a [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] who left the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] because of its links with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]].

There have also been several instances of politicians being elected to the Commons as representatives of a political party, then resigning the party's whip, or having it withdrawn. Examples in this in the 2010-2015 parliament included [[Mike Hancock (British politician)|Mike Hancock]] (formerly a Liberal Democrat), [[Eric Joyce]] (formerly Labour) and [[Nadine Dorries]], a Conservative who had the whip withdrawn for part of the parliament and thus sat as an independent during that time.

Independent candidates often stand in British parliamentary elections, often with platforms about specific local issues, but usually without  success. An example from the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]] was [[Aston Villa]] supporter Ian Robinson, who stood as an independent in the [[Sutton Coldfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sutton Coldfield constituency]] in protest at the way chairman [[Doug Ellis]] ran the football club. Another example an independent candidate, in the [[Salisbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Salisbury constituency]], is [[Arthur Uther Pendragon]], a local activist and self-declared reincarnation of [[King Arthur]].

Other independent candidates are associated with a political party and may be former members of it, but cannot stand under its label. For instance, after being expelled from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] but before the [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect Coalition]] was founded, British [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[George Galloway]] described himself as "Independent Labour".

On 23 March 2005 the [[Independent Network]] was set up to support independent candidates in the General Election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independentnetwork.org.uk/Launch_news_release.html|title=Launchdate of the Independent Network|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Independent Network still supports Independent candidates in local, regional, national and European elections. It has an organic{{clarify|date=May 2014}} set of principles which are known as the Bell Principles and are very closely related to [[Committee on Standards in Public Life|Lord Nolan's Standards of Public Life]]. The Independent Network does not impose any [[ideology]] or political influence on their candidates.

In March 2009, the multi-millionaire [[Paul Judge]] established the [[Jury Team]], an umbrella organisation dedicated to increasing the number of independent candidates standing in Britain, in both national and European elections.&lt;ref name=Independant8Mar09&gt;{{cite news | last = Gourlay  | first = Chris | title = Tycoon finances 'X Factor' party to clean up politics | publisher = [[The Sunday Times]] | date = 2009-03-08 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5864530.ece | accessdate = 2009-05-10 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Independent and No Description candidates====

Part II of the [[Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000]] allows individuals who wish to stand as a candidate to all parliaments and assemblies in the UK, including the House of Commons, the right to use one of three ballot paper descriptions. Those descriptions are the name of a registered political party; the word "independent" or the Welsh equivalent; or no description at all, leaving the ballot paper description box blank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 - Part II "Registration of Political Parties"|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/41/part/II|website=Lesiglation.gov|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless a candidate stands as "independent" or as a "No Description" candidate leaving the ballot paper description box blank, their candidature must be confirmed by a signed certificate from the relevant officer from a registered political party, as set out in Section 52 of the [[Electoral Administration Act 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Electoral Administration Act 2006 - Explanatory Notes|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/22/notes/division/9/7/1?view=plain|website=Legislation.gov|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of Lords===
{{main|Crossbencher|Non-affiliated members of the House of Lords|Lords Spiritual}}
The [[House of Lords]] includes a large number of peers independent from political parties. Some are simply [[Non-affiliated members of the House of Lords|not affiliated]] with any grouping, whilst another, larger, grouping is given the official designation of [[Crossbench#United Kingdom|crossbenchers]]. Additionally the [[Lords Spiritual]] (bishops of the [[Church of England]]) do not have party affiliations.

===Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Northern Irish Assembly===
In the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2003|2003 Scottish Parliamentary elections]], three [[Members of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]] were elected as Independents: [[Dennis Canavan]] ([[Falkirk West (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Falkirk West]]), [[Jean Turner|Dr Jean Turner]] ([[Strathkelvin and Bearsden (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Strathkelvin and Bearsden]]) and [[Margo MacDonald]] ([[Lothians (Scottish Parliament region)|Lothians]]). In 2004 [[Campbell Martin]] ([[West of Scotland (Scottish Parliament region)|West of Scotland region]]) left the [[Scottish National Party]] to become an independent and in 2005 [[Brian Monteith]] ([[Mid Scotland and Fife (Scottish Parliament region)|Mid Scotland and Fife]]) left the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] to become an independent. At the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|2007 Scottish Parliamentary elections]] Margo MacDonald was again returned as an independent MSP and was elected as an independent for the third time [[Scottish Parliament election, 2011|four years later]]. She died in 2014 while still serving as member of the Parliament. As she was elected as an independent regional MSP, there could be no by-election and her seat remained vacant until the [[Scottish Parliament election, 2016|2016 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-26883278|title=Independent MSP Margo MacDonald dies|publisher=bbc.co.uk|date=4 April 2014|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Law]] was expelled from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] after standing against an official Labour candidate in [[Blaenau Gwent]] at the 2005 UK general election and became an independent in the National Assembly and UK Parliament. In 2006 Peter Law died from a [[brain tumour]] and his wife, [[Trish Law]] campaigned and took the seat as an independent candidate at the sequent by-election and held onto the seat again in the [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2007|2007 Welsh Assembly elections]].

In 2016, [[Nathan Gill]] as the then leader of UKIP Wales defected from the group to sit as an independent after a falling out with [[Neil Hamiliton]] who was elected UKIP Assembly group leader. Lord [[Dafydd Elis-Thomas]] left the [[Plaid Cymru]] group later in 2016 after multiple fallings out with Plaid Cymru leader [[Leanne Wood]]. Dafydd Elis-Thomas said his reason for leaving Plaid Cymru was that it not serious about working with the [[Welsh Labour]] Government. [[Neil McEvoy]] Was expelled from Plaid Cymru on 16 January 2018 and is now sitting as an independent AM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-42711839|title=Neil McEvoy expelled from Plaid group|date=6 July 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nathan Gill stood down on the 27 December 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-42493743|title=Nathan Gill resigns from assembly|date=27 December 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by [[Mandy Jones]]. Mandy Jones left the UKIP group on the 9 January 2018 over a fallout over her staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-42620397|title=UKIP rejects new AM in row over staff|date=6 July 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local elections===
The introduction of [[Directly elected mayors in England and Wales|directly elected mayors]] in several parts of England has witnessed the election of independents to run councils in [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Middlesbrough (borough)|Middlesbrough]], [[Borough of Bedford|Bedford]], [[Hartlepool (borough)|Hartlepool]] and [[Mansfield (district)|Mansfield]]. The first [[Mayor of London]], [[Ken Livingstone]], was [[London mayoral election, 2000|first elected]] as an independent, having run against the official Labour candidate [[Frank Dobson]]. He was subsequently re-admitted to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in December 2003 before his first re-election campaign.

Independent candidates frequently stand and are elected to local councils. There is a special Independent group of the [[Local Government Association]] to cater for them. A number of local authorities have been entirely or almost entirely composed of independent members, such as the [[City of London Corporation]], the [[Isles of Scilly Council election, 2009|Isles of Scilly Council]], [[Orkney Islands Council]], [[Shetland Islands Council]] and [[Comhairle nan Eilean Siar]] (Western Isles Council) in the [[Outer Hebrides]].

Roughly a quarter of the [[police and crime commissioner]]s elected in England and Wales in the [[England and Wales police and crime commissioner elections, 2012|2012 election]] were independents.&lt;ref name=PCCs_uk&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: Police and crime commissioners|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19504639|accessdate=27 November 2014|work=BBC News|date=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{see also|Third party officeholders in the United States}}

===President===
[[George Washington]] was the only president elected as an independent, as he was not formally affiliated with any party during his term in office.

[[John Tyler]] was expelled from the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in September 1841, and remained effectively an independent for the remainder of his presidency, later returning to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]. He briefly sought re-election in [[United States presidential election, 1844|1844]] as a National Democrat, but withdrew over fear he would split the Democratic vote.

Since 1900, notable candidates running as independents for U.S. president have included Republican Congressman [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980]], [[Ross Perot]] in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]], and former [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate [[Ralph Nader]] in the [[United States third party and independent presidential candidates, 1996|1996]] and [[United States third party and independent presidential candidates, 2000|2000]] elections. Independent Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] ran for the Democratic nomination, but ultimately did not appear on the ballot in the [[United States elections, 2016|2016]] election, though he did receive 5% of the vote as a [[write-in candidate]] in his home state of [[Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vtelectionresults.sec.state.vt.us/Index.html#/federal |title=Vermont Election Night Results |website=https://www.sec.state.vt.us/ |date= |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Nader formed Independent Parties in [[New Mexico]], [[Delaware]], and elsewhere to gain ballot access in several states. This strategy has been pursued by several other candidates for Federal races, including [[Joe Lieberman]] ([[Connecticut for Lieberman]]).

===Governor===
[[Illinois]], [[Maine]], [[Oregon]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Texas]], [[Alaska]] and [[Minnesota]] have elected formally independent candidates as governor: Illinois's first two governors, [[Shadrach Bond]] and [[Edward Coles]]; [[James B. Longley]] in 1974 as well as [[Angus King]] in 1994 and 1998 from Maine; [[Lincoln Chafee]] in 2010 from Rhode Island; [[Julius Meier]] in 1930 from Oregon; [[Sam Houston]] in 1859 from Texas; and [[Bill Walker (American politician)|Bill Walker]] in 2014 from Alaska. [[Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.]] is sometimes mentioned as an independent governor, though this is not technically correct; he ran as an [[A Connecticut Party]] candidate (which gave him better ballot placement than an unaffiliated candidate would receive), defeating the Democratic and Republican party nominees.  Another former governor who is sometimes mentioned as an independent is [[Jesse Ventura]], who actually ran as a member of the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party's]] Minnesota affiliate, which later disaffiliated from the party and reverted to their original name the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]].

In 1971, State Senator [[Henry Howell]] of [[Virginia]], a former Democrat, was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia|lieutenant governor]] as an independent. Two years later, he campaigned for [[Governor of Virginia|governor]] as an independent, but lost by 15,000 votes.

There were several unsuccessful independent gubernatorial candidates in 2006 who impacted their electoral races. In [[Maine]], state legislator [[Barbara Merrill]] (formerly a Democrat) received 21% of the vote. In [[Texas]], [[country music]] singer and [[detective fiction|mystery novelist]] [[Kinky Friedman]] received 12.43% of the vote, and State [[Comptroller]] [[Carole Keeton Strayhorn]] received 18.13%. Strayhorn and Friedman's presence in the race resulted in a splitting of the ballot four ways between themselves and the two major parties.

In 2010, [[Florida]] governor [[Charlie Crist]] left the Republican party and became Independent (He later became a Democrat.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/27/charlie-crist-senate-race_n_774589.html|work=Huffington Post|title=Charlie Crist Comes Under Fire For Pulling Party Switch|date=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than face former [[Florida House of Representatives|state house]] [[Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Marco Rubio]] in the Republican primary (Rubio won, though Crist came in ahead of Democratic nominee [[Kendrick Meek]]).

In 2014, former [[Honolulu]] mayor [[Mufi Hannemann]] ran as an independent candidate for the [[Governor of Hawaii|governorship]] of the State of [[Hawaii]] after previously campaigning in the state's Democratic primary. As a result, Democratic candidate [[David Ige]] was elected as governor with a plurality of 49%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kitv.com/politics/ige-takes-early-lead-in-hawaii-governors-race/29545058|title=Democrat David Ige elected Hawaii governor|date=4 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105212441/http://www.kitv.com/politics/ige-takes-early-lead-in-hawaii-governors-race/29545058|archivedate=5 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congress – House of Representatives and Senate===
There have been several independents elected to the [[United States Senate]] throughout history. Notable examples include [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]] of [[Illinois]] (a former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]) in the 19th century, and [[Harry F. Byrd, Jr.]] of [[Virginia]] (who had been elected to his first term as a Democrat) in the 20th century.  Some officials have been elected as members of a party but became independent while in office (without being elected as such), such as [[Wayne Morse]] of [[Oregon]]. [[Nebraska]] senator [[George W. Norris]] was elected for four terms as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] before changing to an independent after the Republicans lost their majority in Congress in 1930. Norris won re-election as an independent in 1936, but later lost his final re-election attempt to Republican [[Kenneth S. Wherry]] in 1942. [[Vermont]] senator [[Jim Jeffords]] left the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to become an independent in 2001. Jeffords's [[party switching|change of party status]] was especially significant because it shifted the Senate composition from 50-50 between the Republicans and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] (with a Republican [[Vice President]], [[Dick Cheney]], who would presumably break all ties in favor of the Republicans), to 49 Republicans, 50 Democrats, and one Independent. Jeffords agreed to vote for Democratic control of the Senate in exchange for being appointed chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works|Senate Environment and Public Works Committee]], and the Democrats held control of the Senate until the [[U.S. Senate election, 2002|Congressional elections in 2002]], when the Republicans regained their majority. Jeffords retired at the end of his term in 2007. Wayne Morse after two years as an independent became a Democrat. [[Dean Barkley]] of the [[Independence Party of Minnesota]] was appointed a day before the 2002 elections to fill the senate seat of [[Paul Wellstone]] who, while running for re-election, died weeks prior. Barkley refused to caucus with either party.

Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] is the longest serving independent member of Congress in American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/bernie-sanders-president-democrat-145640890.html |title=Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders says he may run for president as a Democrat |publisher=Yahoo! News |date=2014-09-14 |accessdate=2014-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an independent member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] for [[United States House of Representatives, Vermont At Large|Vermont-at-large]] from 1991 to 2007. Sanders later won the open Senate seat of [[Jim Jeffords]] as an independent. [[Joe Lieberman]] is a former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who, like Lowell P. Weicker, Jr., ran under a third party ([[Connecticut for Lieberman|Connecticut for Lieberman Party]]) in the [[Connecticut United States Senate election, 2006|2006 election]]. Though both representatives are technically independent politicians, they often caucus with the Democrats. In 2006, Sanders and Lieberman were the only two victorious independent candidates for Congress. In 2012 [[Angus King]] was elected to the US Senate as an Independent from Maine.  {{as of|2016}}, he has typically caucused with the Democrats.

The [[United States House of Representatives]] has also seen a handful of [[Third-party members of the United States House of Representatives|independent members]]. Examples include [[Bernie Sanders]] of [[Vermont]], [[Virgil Goode]] of [[Virginia]], [[Frazier Reams]] of [[Ohio]], and [[Victor Berger]] of [[Wisconsin]].

===State and local offices===
In August 2008, there were 12 independents who held offices in state legislatures. There were four state senators, one from [[Kentucky Senate|Kentucky]], one from [[Oregon Senate|Oregon]], one from [[Tennessee Senate|Tennessee]], and one from [[New Mexico Senate|New Mexico]]. The representatives came from the states of [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana]] (two), [[Maine House of Representatives|Maine]] (two), [[Vermont House of Representatives|Vermont]] (two), and [[Virginia House of Delegates|Virginia]] (two). In the 2008 general elections, Wisconsin State Assemblyman Jeffrey Wood left the Republican Party and won reelection as an independent. After the 2008 primary election, New Mexico State Senator [[Joseph Carraro]] left the Republican Party and registered as an Independent. He did not run for reelection.

In November 2005, [[Manny Diaz (Florida politician)|Manny Diaz]] was elected Mayor of [[Miami, Florida]] as an independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citymayors.com/mayors/miami_mayor.html |title=Manny Diaz - Mayor of Miami |publisher=City Mayors |date=2008-01-28 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 19, 2007, [[Mayor of New York City|New York Mayor]] [[Michael Bloomberg]] switched his party affiliation from Republican to independent. [[Oscar Goodman]], Mayor of [[Las Vegas, Nevada]] switched his affiliation to Independent from Democrat in December 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kxnt.com/Mayor-Goodman-Switches-Party-Affiliation/5902291|title=Goodman Switches Party Affiliation. KXNT, Ret. December 16th 2009|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dan Hollingsworth]] has won four consecutive elections as an Independent since 1998 for mayor of the small city of [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]], [[Louisiana]], the home of [[Louisiana Tech University]].

The [[Nebraska Legislature]] is unique in that it is the only nonpartisan state legislature. In the Legislature (which is additionally unique in that it is also the only state legislature that is [[unicameral]]), there are no formal party alignments or groups and the members are nominated in nonpartisan primary elections. Members are allowed to register with political parties but choose not to reveal their affiliation while seated, as a professional courtesy. However, the political affiliation of party-affiliated members are considered [[open secret]]s and the parties exist in the legislature on an unofficial basis. Some members, such as [[Ernie Chambers]] of [[Omaha]], are independent of party officially, while others have not publicly disclosed their affiliation.

'''Jott''' was a [[voice-to-text]] transcription service which allowed its users to call a [[toll-free telephone number]] and speak for up to 30 seconds. The speech is then transcribed to text using a combination of software and human transcribers who work in a "sterile environment which also includes medical dictation."  The message can be sent back to oneself, turned into a reminder, sent to a contact or group, or sent to a third-party "Jott link" such as LiveJournal. Transcribed messages can be delivered to recipients via email, text message, or both.

Jott was founded in April 2006&lt;ref name="hello"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jotts.typepad.com/jott/2006/08/hello_world.html |title=Think it. Jott it.

{{distinguish|Vamachara|Dakshinachara}}

[[File:Baphomet.png|thumb|right|The [[Baphomet]], from Eliphas Levi's ''Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie'', 1854, adopted symbol of some western esoteric "Left-Hand Path" [[life stance|belief systems]].]]

In [[Western esotericism]] the '''Left-Hand Path''' and '''Right-Hand Path''' are the [[dichotomy]] between two opposing approaches to magic. This terminology is used in various groups involved in the [[occult]] and [[ceremonial magic]]. In some definitions, the ''Left-Hand Path'' is equated with malicious [[black magic]] and the ''Right-Hand Path'' with benevolent [[white magic]].&lt;ref name=evans&gt;{{Cite book|last=Evans|first=Dave |title=The History of British Magick after Crowley |publisher=Hidden Publishing|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|152}} Other occultists have criticised this definition, believing that the Left–Right dichotomy refers merely to different kinds of working and does not necessarily connote good or bad magical actions.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|176}}

In more recent definitions, which base themselves on the terms' origins in Indian [[Tantra]], the Right-Hand Path, or RHP, is seen as a definition for those magical groups that follow specific ethical codes and adopt [[Convention (norm)|social convention]], while the Left-Hand Path adopts the opposite attitude, espousing the breaking of [[taboo]] and the abandoning of set [[morality]]. Some contemporary occultists, such as Peter J. Carroll, have stressed that both paths can be followed by a magical practitioner, as essentially they have the same goals.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

== Terminology ==

=== Right-Hand Path ===
The Right-Hand Path is commonly thought to refer to magical or religious groups which adhere to a certain set of characteristics:
* They divide the concepts of [[mind]], [[Human body|body]] and [[spirit]] into three separate, albeit interrelated, entities.&lt;ref name="Hine, Phil 2007 Page 204"&gt;Hine, Phil, quoted in Evans, Dave (2007). ''The History of British Magick after Crowley''. Hidden Publishing. p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They adhere to a specific moral code and a belief in some form of judgement, such as [[karma]] or the [[Threefold Law]].&lt;ref name="Hine, Phil 2007 Page 204"/&gt;

The occultists [[Dion Fortune]]&lt;ref&gt;Fortune, Dion; ''The Mystical Qabalah'', Aquarian Press, 1987, {{ISBN|0-85030-335-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William G. Gray]]&lt;ref&gt;Gray, William; ''Exorcising The Tree of Evil: How To Use The Symbolism Of The Qabalistic Tree of Life To Recognise And Reverse Negative Energy'', [Helios/Weisers/Kima Global], 1974/1984/2002, (originally The Tree of Evil)&lt;/ref&gt; consider non-magical [[Abrahamic religions]] to be RHP.

=== Left-Hand Path ===
The historian Dave Evans studied self-professed followers of the Left-Hand Path in the early 21st century, making several observations about their practices:
*They often reject societal convention and the [[status quo]], which some suggest is in a search for spiritual freedom. As a part of this, LHP followers embrace magical techniques that would traditionally be viewed as [[taboo]], for instance using [[sex magic]] or embracing [[Satanism|Satanic]] imagery.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|197}} As Mogg Morgan wrote, the "breaking of taboos makes magic more potent and can lead to reintegration and liberation, [for example] the eating of meat in a [[vegetarian]] community can have the same liberating effect as [[anal intercourse]] in a sexually inhibited straight society."&lt;ref&gt;Shual. ''Sexual Magic''. p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They often question religious or moral [[dogma]], instead adhering to forms of personal [[anarchism]].&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|198}}
* They often embrace [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and incorporate it into magical ritual.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|205}}

=== Criticism ===
Criticism of both terms has come from various occultists. The Magister of the Cultus Sabbati, [[Andrew D. Chumbley]], stated that they were simply "theoretical constructs" that were "without definitive objectivity", and that nonetheless, both forms could be employed by the magician. He used the analogy of a person having two hands, a right and a left, both of which served the same master.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Chumbley|Chumbley, Andrew]], quoted in Evans, Dave (2007). ''The History of British Magick after Crowley''. Hidden Publishing. pp. 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar sentiments were expressed by the [[Wicca]]n High Priest [[John Belham-Payne]], who stated that "For me, magic is magic."&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Chumbley|Chumbley, Andrew]], quoted in Evans, Dave (2007). ''The History of British Magick after Crowley''. Hidden Publishing. p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the terms ==

=== Vamachara ===
{{Main|Vamachara}}
''Vāmācāra'' is a [[Sanskrit]] term meaning "left-handed attainment" and is synonymous with Left-Hand Path or Left-path (Sanskrit: ''Vāmamārga'').&lt;ref&gt;Bhattacharya, N. N. ''History of the Tantric Religion'' pp. 81, 447. (1999) {{ISBN|81-7304-025-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tantra, ''Vamamarga'' [http://www.ecstaticawareness.com/id13.html (The Left Handed Path: [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]] sadhana)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523175705/http://ecstaticawareness.com/id13.html |date=2012-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to describe a particular mode of worship or spiritual practice (Sanskrit: ''[[sadhana]]'') that is not only [[Heterodoxy|heterodox]] (Sanskrit: ''[[Nāstika]]'') to standard [[Vedic]] injunction, but extreme in comparison to prevailing cultural norms. These practices are often generally considered to be [[tantra|Tantric]] in orientation. The converse term to ''Vāmācāra'' is ''[[Dakshinachara]]'' (glossed "Right-Hand Path") which is used to refer not only to orthodox (''Āstika'') sects but to modes of spirituality that engage in spiritual practices that not only accord with Vedic injunction but are generally agreeable to prevailing cultural norms. That said, left-handed and right-handed modes of practice may be evident in both orthodox and heterodox schools of [[Indian religions|Dharmic religions]] such as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Buddhism]] and are a matter of taste, culture, proclivity, initiation, ''sadhana'' and dharmic lineage (''[[parampara]]'').

=== Tantra and Madame Blavatsky ===
The occidental use of the terms ''Left-Hand Path'' and ''Right Hand-Path'' originated with [[Madame Blavatsky]], a 19th-century occultist who founded the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical Society]]. She had travelled across parts of [[southern Asia]] and claimed to have met with many mystics and magical practitioners in [[India]] and [[Tibet]]. She developed the term ''Left-Hand Path'' as a translation of the term [[Vamachara]], an Indian [[Tantra|Tantric]] practice that emphasised the breaking of Hindu societal taboos by having [[sexual intercourse]] in ritual, drinking [[alcohol]], eating [[meat]] and assembling in graveyards, as a part of the spiritual practice. The term ''Vamachara'' literally meant "the left-hand way" in [[Sanskrit]], and it was from this that Blavatsky first coined the term.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|178}}

Returning to Europe, Blavatsky began using the term. It was relatively easy for her to associate ''left'' with [[evil]] in many European countries, where it already had an association with many negative things; as the historian Dave Evans noted, [[homosexuals]] were referred to as "left-handed", and while in [[Protestant]] nations [[Roman Catholics]] were called "left-footers".&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|177}}

=== Adoption into the western esoteric tradition ===
In New York, Madame Blavatsky founded the [[Theosophical Society]] with several other people in 1875. She set about writing several books, including ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' (1877) in which she introduced the terms ''Left-Hand Path'' and ''Right-Hand Path'', firmly stating that she herself followed the RHP, and that followers of the LHP were practitioners of Black Magic who were a threat to society. The occult community soon picked up on her newly introduced duality, which, according to historian Dave Evans, "had not been known before" in the Western Esoteric Tradition.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|181–182}} For instance, [[Dion Fortune]], the founder of an esoteric magical group (the [[Society of the Inner Light]]) also took the side of the RHP, making the claim that "black magicians", or followers of the LHP, were [[homosexuals]] and that Indian servants might use malicious magical rites devoted to the goddess [[Kali]] against their European masters.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|183–184}}

[[Aleister Crowley]] further altered and popularized the term in certain occult circles, referring to a "Brother of the Left-Hand Path", or a "Black Brother", as one who failed to attain the grade of [[A∴A∴#Magister Templi|Magister Templi]] in Crowley's system of ceremonial magic.&lt;ref name="payattention"&gt;[http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/mwt/mwt_12.html Magick Without Tears]&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley also referred to the Left-Hand Path when describing the point at which the [[A∴A∴#Adeptus Exemptus|Adeptus Exemptus]] (such as his old Christian mentor, [[Macgregor Mathers]]) chooses to cross the Abyss, which is the location of [[Choronzon]] and the illusory eleventh [[Sephirot|Sephira]], which is [[Da'at (Kabbalah)|Da'ath]] or Knowledge. In this example, the adept must surrender all, including the guidance of his [[Holy Guardian Angel]], and leap into the Abyss. If his accumulated [[Karma]] is sufficient, and if he has been utterly thorough in his own self-destruction, he becomes a "babe of the abyss", arising as a Star in the Crowleyan system. On the other hand, if he retains some fragment of ego, or if he fears to cross, he then becomes encysted. The layers of his self, which he could have shed in the Abyss, ossify around him. He is then titled a "Brother of the Left-Hand Path", who will eventually be broken up and disintegrated against his will, since he failed to choose voluntary disintegration.&lt;ref name="payattention" /&gt; Crowley associated all this with "Mary, a blasphemy against [[BABALON]]", and with the celibacy of Christian clergy.&lt;ref name="payattention" /&gt;

Another of those figures that Fortune considered to be a follower of the LHP was [[Arthur Edward Waite]], who did not recognise these terms, and acknowledged that they were newly introduced and that in any case he believed the terms LHP and RHP to be distinct from black and white magic.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|182–183}} However, despite Waite's attempts to distinguish the two, the equation of the LHP with Black Magic was propagated more widely in the fiction of [[Dennis Wheatley]]; Wheatley also conflated the two with [[Satanism]] and also the political ideology of [[communism]], which he viewed as a threat to traditional British society.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|189–190}} In one of his novels, ''Strange Conflict'' (1941), he stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{|
|
:The Order of the Left-Hand Path... has its adepts... the Way of Darkness is perpetuated in the horrible [[West African Vodun|Voodoo]] cult which had its origins in [[Madagascar]] and has held [[Africa]], the Dark Continent, in its grip for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis Wheatley|Wheatley, Dennis]] (1941). ''Strange Conflict''.&lt;/ref&gt;
|
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Later 20th and 21st centuries===
In the latter half of the 20th century various groups arose that self-professedly described themselves as LHP, but did not consider themselves as following [[Black Magic]]. In 1975, [[Kenneth Grant]], a student of Aleister Crowley, explained in ''Cults of the Shadow'' that he and his group, the [[Typhonian Order]], practiced the LHP. Grant's usage takes meaning from its roots in eastern Tantra; Grant states that it is about challenging taboos, but that it should be used in conjunction with the RHP to achieve balance.&lt;ref name=evans /&gt;{{rp|193}}

When [[Anton Szandor LaVey]] was developing his form of [[LaVeyan Satanism]] during the 1960s, he emphasised the rejection of traditional Christian morality and as such labelled his new philosophy to be a form of the Left-Hand Path. In his ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'', he wrote that "Satanism is not a white light religion; it is a religion of the flesh, the mundane, the carnal—all of which are ruled by Satan, the personification of the Left Hand Path."&lt;ref&gt;LaVey, Anton Szandor. ''The Satanic Bible''. The Book of Lucifer 3: paragraph 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia there is a tradition of Left Hand Path practices within the [[Rodnovery|Rodnover]] community under the influence of [[Volhv]] [[Veleslav]],&lt;ref&gt;Чёрная Книга Мары» (2008) - The Black Book of Mary; Шуйный путь: чёрная книга нави» (2011) - Шуйный путь: The Black Book of the Navi [NOTE: 'Шуйный путь' remains untranslated to distinguish it from the Shuyngj Way within Odinism]; Книга Великой Нави: Хаософия и Русское Навославие» (2011) - The Book of the Great Navi: Хаософия (The Wisdom of Chaos [Chaosophy]) and Russian Навославие (Praising of the Navi).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and within the [[Odinism|Odinist]] community with [[Askr Svarte]],&lt;ref&gt;http://nikarevleshy.blogspot.ru/2013/06/evgeny-nechkasov-askr-svarte.html, {{cite web |url=http://www.users.on.net/~mmellors_nbn/4.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217064149/http://www.users.on.net/~mmellors_nbn/4.htm |archivedate=2015-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in England with [[Nikarev Leshy]]. Veleslav has also written numerous books on Tantra and the Left Hand Path.&lt;ref&gt;[[Veleslav#Written works]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen E. Flowers, Ph.D. of the Temple of Set states in his book ''Lords of the Left Hand Path: A History of Spiritual Dissent'' there are two criteria to be considered a true Lord of the Left Hand Path and they are Self-Deification and [[Antinomianism#Left-hand path|Antinomianism]].&lt;ref&gt;Lords of the Left Hand Path: A History of Spiritual Dissent by Stephen E. Flowers Ph.D. pg.4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Usage in Tantra ==
[[Tantra]] is a set of [[esoteric]] [[India]]n traditions with roots in [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Tantra is often divided by its practitioners into two different paths: ''[[dakshinachara]]'' and ''[[vamachara]]'', translated as ''Right-Hand Path'' and ''Left-Hand Path'' respectively. Dakshinachara consists of traditional Hindu practices such as [[asceticism]] and [[meditation]], while vamachara also includes ritual practices that conflict with mainstream Hinduism, such as [[sexual ritual]]s, consumption of [[alcohol]] and other [[intoxicant]]s. The two paths are viewed by Tantrists as equally valid approaches to [[bodhi|enlightenment]]. Vamachara, however, is often considered to be the faster&lt;ref&gt;p. 265 ''Shakti: Realm of the Divine Mother'', Vanamali, Inner Traditions. {{ISBN|1-59477-199-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Vajrayana#Paramitayana and Vajrayana|Distinguishing Paramitayana from Mantrayana]] in ''Encyclopedia of Buddhism'', Robert E. Buswell, Ed., Macmillan USA, New York, NY, 2004. {{ISBN|0-02-865910-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and more dangerous of the two paths, and is not suitable for all practitioners. The usage of the terms Left-Hand Path and Right-Hand Path is still current in modern Indian and Buddhist Tantra.

===Left-Hand Path relation to Tantra in Buddhism===
Robert Beér's ''Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs'' clarifies widespread taboos and deprecation that associate the left hand as dark, female, inferior and 'not right':

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In Buddhist tantra, the right hand symbolises the male aspect of compassion or skilful means, and the left hand represents the female aspect of wisdom or emptiness. Ritual hand-held attributes, such as the vajra and bell, vajra and lotus, damaru and bell, damaru and khatvanga, arrow and bow, curved knife and skull-cup, sword and shield, hook and rope snare, etc., placed in the right and left hands respectively, symbolise the union of the active male aspect of skilful means with the contemplative female aspect of wisdom.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In both Hinduism and Buddhism the goddess is always placed on the left side of the male deity, where she 'sits on his left thigh, while her lord places his left arm over her left shoulder and dallies with her left breast'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In representations of the Buddha image, the right hand often makes an active mudra of skilful means—the earth-touching, protection, fearlessness, wish-granting or teaching mudra; while the left hand often remains in the passive mudra of meditative equipoise, resting in the lap and symbolising meditation on emptiness or wisdom."&lt;ref&gt;Beér, Robert; ''The encyclopedia of Tibetan symbols and motifs'', Serindia Publications, Inc., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Beér's preceding explanations correspond to [[Yab-Yum]] (father-mother) symbolism and contemplation on or practice of [[sexual ritual]]s associated with [[Vajrayogini]] and [[Anuttarayoga Tantra]]. Yab-yum is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of wisdom and compassion. The metaphorical union of bliss and emptiness is commonly represented within [[Thangka]] paintings of the [[Cakrasaṃvara Tantra]] depicting the sexual union of the deity Saṃvara and his consort [[Dorje Pakmo]].

'''Marion Eleanor Zimmer Bradley''' (June 3, 1930 – September 25, 1999) was an American author of [[fantasy]], [[historical fantasy]], [[science fiction]], and [[science fantasy]] [[novel]]s, and is best known for the [[Arthurian fiction]] novel ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'', and the [[Darkover series]]. While she is noted for her [[feminist]] perspective in her writing,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xuvLRbKvyGEC|title=The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=Citadel Press|year=|isbn=9780806524078|editor-last=Rabinovitch|editor-first=Shelley|location=|pages=|language=en|editor-last2=Lewis|editor-first2=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|28-29}} her popularity has been posthumously marred by multiple accusations against her of [[child sexual abuse]] and [[rape]] by two of her children, Mark and Moira Greyland, and others. 

==Biography==
Born Marion Eleanor Zimmer on June 3, 1930, she lived on a farm in [[Albany, New York]], and began writing at the age of 17.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/09/29/books/marion-zimmer-bradley-69-writer-of-darkover-fantasies.html?pagewanted=1|title=Marion Zimmer Bradley, 69, Writer of Darkover Fantasies|last=|first=|date=29 September 1999|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was married to Robert Alden Bradley from October 26, 1949 until their divorce on May 19, 1964. They had a son, David Robert Bradley (1950–2008). During the 1950s she was introduced to [[lesbian]] advocacy organization the [[Daughters of Bilitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ucCwDgAAQBAJ|title=Indomitable: The Life of Barbara Grier|last=Passet|first=Joanne|date=2016-11-01|publisher=Bella Books|year=|isbn=9781594936647|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=Chapter Two: Becoming Gene Damon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her divorce, Bradley married [[numismatist]] [[Walter H. Breen]] on June 3, 1964. They had a daughter, Moira Greyland, who is a professional [[harpist]] and singer,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moiragreyland.net/|title=Moira Greyland|website=Moira Greyland|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a son, Mark Greyland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://starfire-studio.com/markgreyland.html|title=Secret Keeper No More: An Interview With Mark Greyland|last=|first=|date=2014-12-21|website=|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20141221115834/http://starfire-studio.com:80/markgreyland.html|archive-date=21 December 2014|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Bradley graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Hardin-Simmons University]] in [[Abilene, Texas]]. Afterward, she moved to [[Berkeley, California]], to pursue graduate studies at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] between 1965 and 1967. In 1966, she helped found and named the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] and was involved in developing several local groups, some in New York after her move to [[Staten Island]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paxson|first=Diana L.|date=Winter 1999|title=The Priestess of Avalon: A Memoir of Marion Zimmer Bradley (1930-1999)|url=https://avalonbooks.net/about-authors/the-priestess-of-avalon/|journal=Sagewoman|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paxon|first=Diana L.|author-link=Diana L.

Bradley and Breen separated in 1979 but remained married, and continued a business relationship and lived on the same street for over a decade. They officially divorced on May 9, 1990, the year Breen was arrested on [[child molestation]] charges after a 13-year-old boy reported that Breen had been molesting him for four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Serrano, Richard A. |date= October 3, 1991| url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/61504546.html?dids=61504546:61504546&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+03%2C+1991&amp;author=RICHARD+A.+SERRANO&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Rare+Coins+Expert+Charged+With+Child+Molestation&amp;pqatl=google | title=Rare Coins Expert Charged With Child Molestation| work= [[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=  December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had edited Breen's book ''Greek Love'', which was dedicated to her, and in 1965 had contributed an article, "Feminine Equivalents of Greek Love in Modern Literature", to Breen's journal ''The International Journal of Greek Love''.&lt;ref name="(John)Phd20142"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V7nKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA321|title=Before Stonewall: Activists for Gay and Lesbian Rights in Historical Context|last=Mader|first=Donald|date=|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-1-317-76628-5|editor-last=Bullough|editor-first=Vern L.|location=|pages=312–321|chapter=Walter H.

===Religion===
While she was attending the College for Teachers (now [[University at Albany, SUNY]]) in Albany, Bradley became involved in [[Western esoteric tradition]]. She later completed the [[Rosicrucian]] correspondence course.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the late 1950s or early 1960s, Bradley and [[Walter H. Breen]] founded the Aquarian Order of the Restoration based on the work of [[Dion Fortune]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nDdcVt9-jnMC|title=The Encyclopedia of Witches, Witchcraft and Wicca|last=|first=|date=2010-05-12|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=|isbn=9781438126845|editor-last=Guiley|editor-first=Rosemary|location=|pages=36-37|language=en|chapter=Bradley, Marion Zimmer (1930 - 1999)}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1961 she was formally initiating others, including Ramfis S. Firethorn.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|313}}

Bradley was active in Darkmoon Circle, which was founded in 1978 by several women who were members of her Aquarian Order of the Restoration. Bradley renovated her garage to provide a meeting room for Darkmoon Circle as well as for other local Pagan groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thespiralpath.org/clergy/handbook/aboutspiral.html|title=The Fellowship of the Spiral Path Clergy Training Program: Handbook|last=|first=|date=2014-12-27|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141227175500/http://www.thespiralpath.org/clergy/handbook/aboutspiral.html|archive-date=27 December 2014|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 Bradley, [[Diana L. Paxson]], and [[Elisabeth Waters]] incorporated the Center for Non-Traditional Religion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the 1990s Bradley said she would return to [[Christianity]], telling an interviewer: "I just go regularly to the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian church]]... That pagan thing... I feel that I've gotten past it. I would like people to explore the possibilities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/30/news/mn-16625|title=Marion Bradley; Writer of Fantasy Novels|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|date=1999-09-30|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
After suffering declining health for years, Bradley died at [[Alta Bates Medical Center]] in Berkeley on September 25, 1999, four days after suffering a debilitating [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Her ashes were later scattered at [[Glastonbury Tor]] in [[Somerset]], England.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|28-29}}

==Child sex abuse allegations==
In 2014, her daughter, Moira Greyland, accused her of sexual abuse from the age of three to 12. In an email to ''[[The Guardian]],'' Greyland said that she had not spoken out before because: {{quote|1=I thought that my mother's fans would be angry with me for saying anything against someone who had championed women's rights and made so many of them feel differently about themselves and their lives. I didn't want to hurt anyone she had helped, so I just kept my mouth shut.}} Greyland also claimed that she was not the only victim and that she was one of the people who reported her father, [[Walter H. Breen]], for child molestation, for which he received multiple convictions.&lt;ref name="Flood"&gt;{{cite web|last=Flood|first=Alison|date=June 27, 2014|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/27/sff-community-marion-zimmer-bradley-daughter-accuses-abuse|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=June 27, 2014|title=SFF community reeling after Marion Zimmer Bradley's daughter accuses her of abuse}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenberg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Alyssa|date=June 27, 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2014/06/27/re-reading-feminist-author-marion-zimmer-bradley-in-the-wake-of-sexual-assault-allegations/|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=June 27, 2014|title=Re-reading feminist author Marion Zimmer Bradley in the wake of sexual assault allegations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidl"&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidl|first=Christian|date=June 29, 2014|url=http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/leute/schriftstellerin/missbrauchsvorwuerfe-an-avalon-autorin-36588372.bild.html|publisher=[[Bild]]|accessdate=June 29, 2014|title=Hat die Avalon-Autorin ihre Tochter missbraucht?}}&lt;/ref&gt; By her own admission, Bradley was aware of her husband's behavior although she chose not to report him.&lt;ref name="sff.net"&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160911223846/http://www.stephengoldin.com/MZB%20Website/Marion%20Zimmer%20Bradle---Timeline.html |archive-date=September 11, 2016 |url=http://www.stephengoldin.com/MZB%20Website/Marion%20Zimmer%20Bradle---Timeline.html |work=Marion Zimmer Bradley: In Her Own Words |title=Timeline of Events |publisher=Stephen Goldin |last=Goldin |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Goldin |date=1999 |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to these allegations, on July 2, 2014, [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]], the publisher of Bradley's digital backlist, announced that it will donate all income from the sales of Bradley's e-books to the charity [[Save the Children]].&lt;ref name="SFgateway"&gt;{{cite web|date=July 2, 2014|url=http://blog.sfgateway.com/index.php/marion-zimmer-bradley/|publisher=[[Victor Gollancz Ltd]]|accessdate=July 2, 2014|title=Marion Zimmer Bradley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author [[Janni Lee Simner]], who has continued to write works in Bradley's [[Darkover]] series, announced on June 13, 2014 that she would be donating advances from her two Darkover books, her Darkover royalties and at the request of her husband, Larry Hammer, payment for his sale to Bradley’s magazine, to the American anti-sexual assault organization [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]].&lt;ref name="Simner"&gt;{{cite web|date=June 13, 2014|url=http://simner.com/blog/?p=5775|publisher=[[Janni Lee Simner]]|accessdate=July 10, 2014|title=On doing a thing I needed to do}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the first was [[John Scalzi]], who within a day of the allegations being made public, described the allegations as "horrific".&lt;ref name="Scalzi"&gt;{{cite web|date=June 13, 2014|url=https://twitter.com/scalzi/status/476521186780667904|publisher=[[John Scalzi]]|accessdate=July 11, 2014|title=This is horrible: Marion Zimmer Bradley's daughter alleges she was molested by her mother.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugo Award]] winner [[Jim C.

==Literary career==
Bradley stated that when she was a child she enjoyed reading adventure fantasy authors such as [[Henry Kuttner]], [[Edmond Hamilton]], [[C.L. Moore]], and [[Leigh Brackett]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward James (historian)|Edward James]], "Bradley, Marion Zimmer", ''St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers'', ed. [[David Pringle]], St. James Press, 1996, {{ISBN|1-55862-205-5}}, p. 68-71.&lt;/ref&gt; especially when they wrote about "the glint of strange suns on worlds that never were and never would be". Her first novel and much of her subsequent work show their influence strongly. At 17, she began her first novel ''[[The Forest House]]'', her retelling of ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''; she finished it before her death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Bradley made her first sale as an adjunct to an amateur fiction contest in ''[[Amazing Stories]]'' in 1949 with the short story "Outpost". "Outpost" was published in ''Amazing Stories'' Vol. 23, No. 12, the December 1949 issue; it had previously appeared in the fanzine ''Spacewarp'' Vol. 4, No. 3, in December 1948.  Her first professional publication was a short story "Women Only", which appeared in the second (and final) issue of ''Vortex Science Fiction'' in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?VRTXSCNCFC21953 Publication Listing – Title: Vortex Science Fiction Vol. 1, No. 2], Internet Speculative Fiction Database&lt;/ref&gt; Her first published novel-length work was ''[[Falcons of Narabedla]]'', first published in the May 1957 issue of ''[[Other Worlds (magazine)|Other Worlds]]''.
[[File:Cover of I Am A Lesbian by Lee Chapman - Monarch MB529 1962.jpg|thumb|256x256px|Cover of "I Am A Lesbian" published by Marion Zimmer Bradley under the pseudonym Lee Chapman. &amp;nbsp;[[Monarch Books|Monarch Book]],&amp;nbsp;1962.]]
Early in her career, writing as Morgan Ives, Miriam Gardner, John Dexter, and Lee Chapman, Bradley produced several works outside the [[speculative fiction]] genre, including [[gay]] and [[lesbian pulp fiction]] novels; ''I Am a Lesbian'' was published in 1962. Though relatively tame by today's standards, her novels were considered [[Pornography|pornographic]] when published, and for a long time she refused to disclose the titles she wrote under these pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/068/000044933/|title=Marion Zimmer Bradley|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nndb.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her 1958 novel ''[[The Planet Savers]]'' introduced the planet of [[Darkover]], which became the setting of a popular series by Bradley and other authors. The Darkover milieu is a [[science fantasy]] fictional world, with science fiction as well as fantasy overtones: Darkover is a lost human [[colony]] where [[Parapsychology|psi powers]] developed to an unusual degree, and work like magic, while technology has regressed to a more-or-less medieval stage. Bradley wrote many Darkover novels by herself, but in her later years collaborated with other authors for publication; her literary collaborators have continued the series since her death.[[File:Mists of Avalon-1st ed.jpg|left|thumb|222x222px|[[United States]]&amp;nbsp;1st edition cover of&amp;nbsp;''[[The Mists of Avalon]]''&amp;nbsp;(1983).]]
Bradley took an active role in science fiction and fantasy [[fandom]], promoting interaction with professional authors and publishers and making several important contributions to the subculture. In her teens she wrote letters to the pulp magazines of the time, such as the above-mentioned ''Amazing Stories'' and ''[[Wonder Stories|Thrilling Wonder Stories]]''. Starting in the late 1940s and continuing in the 1950s and 1960s, she published her own fanzines, including ''Astra's Tower'', ''Day*Star'', and ''Anything Box''. She also co-edited fanzines, including ''Ugly Bird'' with [[Redd Boggs]], ''MEZRAB'' with her first husband Robert Bradley, and ''Allerlei'' with her second husband Walter Breen. Bradley contributed to several other fanzines, including ''The Gorgon'' and ''The Nekromantikon''. In the 1970s, as part of the contemporary wave of enthusiasm for [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s fictional world of [[Middle-earth]], she wrote two short [[fanfic]] stories about [[Arwen]] and published them in [[chapbook]] format. One story, "The Jewel of Arwen" (originally published in a different form in the fanzine ''I Palantir'' #2, August 1961), appeared in her professional anthology ''The Best of Marion Zimmer Bradley'' (1985), but was dropped from later reprints. She continued to contribute to different science fiction and fantasy fanzines and magazines throughout her career.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

In 1966, Bradley became a co-founder of the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] and is credited with coining the name of that group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.epochtimes.com/news/8-3-17/67686.html "Latter-Day Knights Battle for Imaginary Kingdoms"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515192325/http://en.epochtimes.com/news/8-3-17/67686.html |date=May 15, 2008 }}, ''The Epoch Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithway.org/history/chap6b.html "... Marion Zimmer Bradley, came up with 'Society for Creative Anachronism' which quickly caught on."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727145215/http://www.smithway.org/history/chap6b.html |date=July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, Bradley actively encouraged Darkover [[fan fiction]]. She encouraged submissions from unpublished authors and reprinted some of it in commercial Darkover anthologies. This ended after a dispute with a fan over an unpublished Darkover novel of Bradley's that had similarities to one of the fan's stories. As a result, the novel remained unpublished and Bradley demanded the cessation of all Darkover fan fiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/236/191 "The Contraband Incident: The Strange Case of Marion Zimmer Bradley."] Coker, Catherine. 2011. – ''Transformative Works and Cultures'', no. 6. doi:10.3983/twc.2011.0236. Texas A &amp; M University, College Station, TX&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradley was the editor of the long-running ''[[Sword and Sorceress series|Sword and Sorceress]]'' [[anthology]] series, which encouraged submissions of fantasy stories featuring original and non-traditional heroines from young and upcoming authors. Although she particularly encouraged young female authors, she was not averse to including stories from men in her anthologies.  [[Mercedes Lackey]] was one of many authors who first appeared in the anthologies. Bradley also maintained a large family of writers at her home in [[Berkeley, California]]. Bradley was editing the final ''Sword and Sorceress'' manuscript until the week of her death.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

Her most famous single novel may be ''[[The Mists of Avalon]]'',&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-marion-zimmer-bradley-1123162.html|title=Obituary: Marion Zimmer Bradley|last=Adrian|first=Jack|date=30 September 1999|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; a retelling of the [[Camelot]] legend from the point of view of [[Morgan Le Fay|Morgaine]] and [[Guinevere|Gwenhwyfar]]. It grew into a series of books and, like the Darkover series, the later novels are written with or by other authors and have continued to appear since Bradley's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mzbworks.com/|title=Marion Zimmer Bradley Literary Works Trust|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, the critic [[Damon Knight]] stated that "(h)er work is distinctively feminine in tone, but lacks the clichés, overemphasis and other kittenish tricks which often make female fiction unreadable by males".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A Century of Science Fiction|last=Knight |first= Damon|authorlink= Damon Knight|year=1962 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn= |page= 136|accessdate=July 21, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Century_of_Science_Fiction.html?id=jH_jAAAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradley was posthumously awarded the [[World Fantasy Award]] for lifetime achievement in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfadb.com/World_Fantasy_Awards_2000|title=World Fantasy Awards 2000|last=|first=|date=|website=www.sfadb.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mixtecan languages''' constitute a branch of the [[Otomanguean]] language family of [[Mexico]]. They include the [[Trique language|Trique]] (or Triqui) languages, spoken by about 24,500 people; [[Cuicatec]], spoken by about 15,000 people; and the large expanse of [[Mixtec languages]], spoken by about 511,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;2000 census; the numbers are based on the number of total population for each group and the percentages of speakers given on the website of the Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas, http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=660, accessed 28 July 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Trique, Cuicatec, and Mixtec, is an open question. Unpublished research by [[Terrence Kaufman]] in the 1980s supported grouping Cuicatec and Mixtec together.&lt;ref&gt;Macaulay, Monica. 1996. ''A grammar of Chalcatongo Mixtec''. University of California Publications in Linguistics, pp 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proto-Mixtecan==

The ''[[urheimat]]'' of the [[Oto-Manguean languages|Otomanguean family]] may be the [[valley of Tehuacán]] ([[Puebla]]).&lt;ref&gt;Suárez, 1983: 153.&lt;/ref&gt; This site was one of the places of the domestication of [[maize]].  The thousand-year presence of Otomanguean-speaking groups in this region makes it probable that they were active in this domestication process, which favored the inhabitants of the Altiplano's transition to a sedentary lifestyle and thus influenced the development of Mesoamerican civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Bellwood: 2005, 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell and Kaufman have proposed that the Otomanguean languages began to diverge about 1500 BCE.  The difficulty of establishing more general relationships between the eight subgroups of the family presents a difficulty for making more detailed inferences on the historical development of the languages.

Proto Otomanguean has been reconstructed by [[Robert E. Longacre]] and Calvin Rensch. The phonological system of the protolanguage has nine consonants, four vowels, and four tones.&lt;ref&gt;Rensch, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;  The groups of consonants and the diphthongs formed from this limited repertory would have been the origin of the phonemes in the daughter protolanguages of the various subgroups of Proto-Otomanguean.  Some of the most significant changes in the diversification of Proto-Otomanguean phonemes into Proto-Mixtecan phonemes are the following:

&lt;/center&gt;

Rensch revised the reconstruction work of Longacre.  He revised the probable phonological inventory and described some of his proposals, based on comparisons of the cognates in the Mixtecan languages.  After this work, he proposed a reconstruction of the phonological system of Proto-Mixtecan.&lt;ref&gt;Rensch, 1977: 59.&lt;/ref&gt; This proposal contains sixteen consonants, four vowels, and four tones.

'''Net register tonnage''' ('''NRT''', '''nrt''', '''n.r.t.''')  is a ship's cargo volume capacity expressed in "register tons", one of which equals to a volume of {{convert|100|cuft|m3|2}}. It is calculated by subtracting non-revenue-earning spaces i.e. spaces not available for carrying cargo, for example engine rooms, fuel tanks and crew quarters, from the ship's [[gross register tonnage]].&lt;ref name="stopford"&gt;{{Citation|last=Stopford|first=Martin|year=2009|title=Maritime Economics|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=752|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tfsC6RUDn2QC|accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tsnistgov"&gt;[http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/upload/appenb.pdf Units and Systems of Measurement Their Origin, Development, and Present Status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019215258/http://ts.nist.gov/WeightsAndMeasures/upload/appenb.pdf |date=2011-10-19 }}. National Institute of Standards and Technology. {{retrieved | accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Net tonnage is thus used in situations where a vessel's earning capacity is important, rather than its mere size.  Net register tonnage is not a measure of the weight of the ship or its cargo, and should not be confused with terms such as [[deadweight tonnage]] or [[displacement (ship)|displacement]].

Gross and net register tonnages were replaced by [[gross tonnage]] and [[net tonnage]], respectively, when the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) adopted The International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships on 23 June 1969. The new tonnage regulations entered into force for all new ships on 18 July 1982, but existing vessels were given a migration period of 12 years to ensure that ships were given reasonable economic safeguards, since port and other dues are charged according to ship's tonnage. Since 18 July 1994 the gross and net tonnages, [[dimensionless]] indices calculated from the total moulded [[volume]] of the ship and its [[cargo]] spaces by [[mathematical formula]]e, have been the only official measures of the ship's tonnage.&lt;ref name="imo"&gt;[http://www.imo.org/About/Conventions/ListOfConventions/Pages/International-Convention-on-Tonnage-Measurement-of-Ships.aspx International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships]. International Maritime Organization (IMO). {{retrieved | accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the gross and net register tonnages are still widely used in describing older ships.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1648">Night service in telephony is a feature of [[private branch exchange]]s and other business telephone systems, whereby for a set period during the day (usually those hours outside of normal office or work hours, when normal operator services are not provided), all incoming calls are automatically redirected by the [[telephone switchboard|switchboard]] to a specific extension or to equipment such as an [[answering machine]] or other [[voice mail]] system.

In systems without [[direct inward dial]] capability, all calls for a large organisation originally were placed to the facility's main number, where a [[switchboard operator]] or attendant would ask which extension or department the caller intended to reach. The call would then be transferred manually. As soon as the front office closed for the day, the system would be unusable for inbound calls.

Night service would redirect after-hours calls to a desk where personnel remained on duty overnight, such as a [[security guard|night watchman]]'s duty station or a commercial [[answering service]]. An [[automated attendant]] may also be used to retain inbound calling to individual extensions after a live attendant goes off duty.

'''Peter Pagin''' (born 1953) is Professor of [[Philosophy]] at [[Stockholm University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.su.se/~ppagin/pagineng.htm Peter Pagin] Stockholm University 
&lt;/ref&gt; He is a specialist in the philosophy of [[language]] and has worked extensively on foundational issues in semantics and on technical and philosophical problems about the compositionality of meaning.

==Work==

One of Pagin's principal aims is to provide the foundations for seemingly basic semantic concepts like truth and reference in terms of the role that compositional semantic theories must play in explaining the success of linguistic communication. This has led him into various areas of the philosophy of language and logic, and he has written about rules and rule-following, vagueness, synonymy, and assertion, and about the works of Wittgenstein, Quine, Davidson and Dummett. Pagin has also worked in fields adjacent to the philosophy of language such as the philosophy of mind (work on sensation terms), cognitive psychology and psychiatry (work on speakers with autism), and the history of literature (work on indexicality and point of view).

==Academia==

Peter Pagin was born in Stockholm and educated at Stockholm University. He received a bachelor's degree in Philosophy and Mathematics in 1981 and a PhD in 1987 (for a thesis written under the supervision of Dag Prawitz). From 1987-1991 Pagin held a postdoctoral research position (forskarassistent) and received a Docent degree in 1992. In 1996 he was a Fellow at The Swedish Collegium for Advanced Studies in Social Science (SCASSS), Uppsala. He was made a full Professor in 2002.

'''Qatari Unified Sign Language''' is a proposal by the Qatari Supreme Council for Family Affairs to unify the [[deaf sign language]], or perhaps languages, of [[Qatar]].  A dictionary has been published.  The council's description suggests that sign language in Qatar may belong to the [[Arab Sign Language family]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tm22nivpJi4C&amp;pg=PA288&amp;dq=%22Qatari+Sign+Language%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HRxaUqy-K_LCyAGnw4GIBQ&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Qatar&amp;f=false Intelligent Informatics: Proceedings of the International Symposium on Intelligent Informatics ISI'12].

'''RUFKM'''?, is an abbreviation for "Are You Fucking Kidding Me?" in [[Internet slang]]. It was first used in [[text messaging]] but is now widespread in other forms of [[computer-mediated communication]], and even face-to-face communication. It is one of many initialisms for expressing reactions to absurd situations and stories like FML? ("Fuck My Life").  The abbreviations RUFKM and FML have become so common that entire websites are dedicated to sharing stories about situations that make you say RUFKM? or FML?

The '''Santa language''', also known as '''Dongxiang''' ({{lang-zh|s=东乡语|p=Dōngxiāng yǔ}}), is a [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language]] spoken by the [[Dongxiang people]] in [[northwest China]].

==Dialects==
There are no dialects in strict sense, but three local varieties (''tuyu'') can be found: Suonanba (ca. 50% of all Dongxiang speakers), Wangjiaji (ca. 30% of all Dongxiang speakers) and Sijiaji (ca. 20% of all Dongxiang speakers).

== Phonology ==
Except for a limited number of cases there is no vowel harmony, and the harmonic rules governing the suffix pronunciation are by far not as strict as those of Mongolian.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;

===Consonants===
Dongxiang has 29 consonants:{{sfnp|Field|1997|p=37}}

===Syntax===
In common with other Mongolic languages, Dongxiang is basically a [[Subject–object–verb|SOV]] language. In Linxia, however, under the influence of the [[Mandarin Chinese]] dialects spoken by the neighbouring [[Hui people]], sentences of the [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] type have also been observed.{{sfnp|Bao|2006|loc=1.1: 东乡语的语序特点}}

==Writing system==
Knowledge of [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is widespread among the Sarta, and as a result, they often use the [[Arabic script]] to write down their language informally (cf. the [[Xiao'erjing]] system that was used by [[Hui people]]); however, this has been little investigated by scholars. {{asof|2003}}, the official [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] for Dongxiang, developed on the basis of the [[Monguor language|Monguor]] alphabet, remained in the experimental stage.{{sfnp|Kim|2003|p=348}}

==The Tangwang language==
{{main article|Tangwang language}}

There are about 20,000 people in the north-eastern part [[Dongxiang Autonomous County|Dongxiang County]], who self-identify as Dongxiang or [[Hui people]] who do not speak Dongxiang, but natively speak a Dongxiang-influenced form of [[Mandarin Chinese]]. The linguist Mei W. Lee-Smith calls this the "Tangwang language" ({{zh|唐汪话}}), based on the names of the two largest villages (Tangjia and Wangjia, parts of Tangwang [[town (China)|Town]]) where it is spoken and argues it is a [[creole language|creolized language]].
&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{citation |last1=Lee-Smith|first1=Mei W. |contribution=The Tangwang language |author2=International Council for Philosophy and Humanistic Studies |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1996 |isbn=3-11-013417-9 |title=Atlas of languages of intercultural communication in the Pacific, Asia, and the Americas, Volume 2, Part 1. (Volume 13 of Trends in Linguistics, Documentation Series). |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=glU0vte5gSkC |pages=875–882 |editor-last=Wurm |editor-first=Stephen A. 
|editor2-last=Mühlhäusler |editor2-first=Peter |editor3-last=Tyron |editor3-first=Darrell T. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Lee-Smith, the Tangwang language uses mostly Mandarin words and morphemes with Dongxiang grammar. Besides Dongxiang loanwords, Tangwang also has a substantial number of Arabic and Persian loanwords.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

Like standard Mandarin, Tangwang is a tonal language, but grammatical particles, which are typically borrowed from Mandarin, but are used in the way Dongxiang morphemes would be used in Dongxiang, don't carry tones.&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

For example, while the Mandarin plural suffix ''-men'' (们) has only very restricted usage (it can be used with personal pronouns and some nouns related to people),  Tangwang uses it, in the form ''-m'', universally, the way Dongxiang would use its plural suffix ''-la''. Mandarin pronoun ''ni'' (你) can be used in Tangwang as a possessive suffix (meaning "your").
Unlike Mandarin, but like Dongxiang, Tangwang has grammatical cases as well (however only four of them, unlike eight in Dongxiang).&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;

There is no officially recognized national sign language in [[Singapore]]. Since Singapore's independence in 1965, the Singapore deaf community has had to adapt to many linguistic changes. Today, the local deaf community recognizes Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) as a reflection of Singapore's diverse linguistic culture. SgSL is influenced by [[Shanghainese Sign Language|Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL)]], [[American Sign Language|American Sign Language (ASL)]], [[Signing Exact English|Signing Exact English (SEE-II)]] and locally developed signs. The total number of deaf clients registered with The Singapore Association For The Deaf (SADeaf), an organisation that advocates equal opportunity for the deaf, is 5756, as of 2014. 

== History of sign language in Singapore ==

=== 1950s - Beginnings ===
[[File:The Singapore Association for the Deaf logo.svg|thumb|right|The Singapore Association For The Deaf (SADeaf) aims to assist the deaf to achieve a better quality of life and to enable them to integrate and contribute to society.]]
The history of sign language in [[Singapore]] can be traced back to 1951 when [[Peng Tsu Ying]] left China for Singapore to teach deaf children in their homes. Born in Shanghai, Peng became deaf at the age of 6, and was educated in Hong Kong School for the Deaf (now known as Chun Tok School) and Shanghai Chung Wah School for the Deaf. With Peng’s education background in [[Shanghai Sign Language|Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL)]] and together with a group of Chinese merchants, in March 1954, the Singapore Chinese Sign School for the deaf was opened. At that time, Singapore was predominantly Chinese and many diverse varieties were spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=William Gordon Ewing|first1=Sir Alexander|author2=Lady Templer|authorlink2=The Educational Treatment of Deafness in South-east Asia|title=The Modern Educational Treatment of Deafness|date=1960|publisher=Manchester University Press|page=25|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fEG8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=The+Modern+Educational+Treatment+of+Deafness.#v=onepage&amp;q=predominantly%20Chinese%20&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 October 2014|chapter=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peng and his wife, also deaf, used SSL in the sign school to teach children to read in Chinese and other subjects at the primary level.

During the same period in the early 1950s, the [[Singapore Red Cross Society|Singapore Red Cross]] began conducting oral classes for deaf children and provided counselling services for parents of deaf children. As the demand for classes increased, the Singapore Red Cross Society and officials of the Social Welfare Department founded The Singapore Association For The Deaf (SADeaf) (then known as Singapore Deaf and Dumb Association) in 1955. 
It was in 1963 when the sign school and the oral school merged to become the Singapore School for the Deaf (SSD). Within the same premises, students in the oral section of the school were taught in English as the medium of instruction, while students in the signing section of the school were taught in Chinese, with SSL as the medium of instruction.&lt;ref name="scholarbank.nus.edu.sg"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phua Su Yin|first1=Mandy|title=The Language Skills of Singaporean Deaf Children Using Total Communication|url=http://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/bitstream/handle/10635/13863/ThesisMandyPhua.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1966 – Bilingual policy ===
{{Main|Language planning and policy in Singapore}}
The bilingual education policy, which came into effect in 1966, marked a linguistic transition for Singapore. The policy places English as the main medium of instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=National Library |last1=Singapore |title=Singapore's Education System |url=http://libguides.nl.sg/content.php?pid=57257&amp;sid=551371 |website=Bilingual Education - Singapore's Educational System - Resource Guides at National Library, Singapore |publisher=National Library Board Singapore 2014 |access-date=19 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002211453/http://libguides.nl.sg/content.php?pid=57257&amp;sid=551371 |archivedate=October 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since English became the language of instruction in the education sector, parents could choose education through any one of the four official languages (Mandarin, Malay, Tamil) but all students also had to study English, in non-English-medium schools. The government then required all schools to teach Math and Science in English starting at primary one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=L. Quentin Dixon|authorlink1=The Bilingual Education Policy in Singapore: Implications for Second Language Acquisition|editor1-last=Cohen|editor1-first=James|editor2-last=T. McAlister|editor2-first=Kara|editor3-last=Rolstad|editor3-first=Kellie|display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=MacSwan|editor4-first=Jeff|title=ISB4: Proceedings of the 4th International Symposium on Bilingualism|date=2005|publisher=Cascadilla Press|location=Smmerville, MA 02144, USA|isbn=978-1-57473-107-1|url=http://www.lingref.com/isb/4/047ISB4.PDF|access-date=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This policy is significant to the local deaf community because it has marked a change in educating the deaf. Singapore, once under colonial rule, had been influenced by the British in learning English through the oral method. Furthermore, mainstream education in Singapore was moving towards English education and schools were beginning to switch to English as a medium of instruction. This posed a dilemma to the deaf community because the oral method was not suited to every student. While parents wanted their children to learn English, they have been learning SSL, which was associated with written Chinese.

=== 1970s ===
Lim Chin Heng, a former student under Peng, went to the United States of America (USA) to learn English and their sign system, the [[American Sign Language|American Sign Language (ASL)]]. While studying, Lim also got to know some of the professors and authors in USA who were developing a sign system to teach English specifically, called [[Signing Exact English|Signing Exact English (SEE-II)]]. Lim became the first Singaporean to enter [[Gallaudet University]] in Washington, D.C, an American university for the deaf. He graduated in with a degree in Mathematics, returned to Singapore and introduced ASL to the deaf community by 1974.&lt;ref name="scholarbank.nus.edu.sg"/&gt; Written English was known to be associated with ASL because ASL has seen the least number of generational breaks and was well-transmitted as compared to European counterparts. The international deaf community looked up to America as having a strong tradition in protecting their deaf and deaf rights. Hence, ASL was adopted to teach English as a medium of instruction to the deaf because it was seen as the best sign language to learn English.

In 1976, SADeaf invited Frances M. Parsons, then an associate professor at the Gallaudet University to promote [[Total Communication]]. Total Communication is a philosophy which uses signs, [[speech]], [[gesture]]s, [[Lip reading|speech reading]], amplification, [[finger spelling]], and/ or other mode of communication to provide linguistic input to deaf children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History about SADeaf|url=http://www.sadeaf.org.sg/history.htm#2|website=The Singapore Association for the Deaf|publisher=SADeaf|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Lim also brought back SEE-II to the local deaf community.

By 1977, the Total Communication approach was fully implemented in SSD.&lt;ref name="scholarbank.nus.edu.sg"/&gt;  Lim also taught basic ASL classes for teachers and eventually ASL was taught to students in SSD.&lt;ref name="Sign for Singapore"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=An Introduction: Sign Language in Singapore|title=Sign for Singapore|date=1990|publisher=Times Editions Pte Ltd, Singapore Association for the Deaf|location=Times Centre, a New Industrial Road, Singapore 1953|isbn=978-981-204-148-7|page=4|url=http://eohorizons.tumblr.com/post/63093451155/an-introduction-sign-language-in-singapore|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1978, SEE-II was adopted as the mode of communication and instruction by SADeaf in its affiliated schools, in SSD and Vocational School for the Handicapped (now known as Mountbatten Vocational School). However, the sign section of SSD, which used SSL, was phased out in 1983 because there were gradually fewer parents who opted for a Chinese education for their deaf children.&lt;ref name="scholarbank.nus.edu.sg"/&gt;

In 1985, SADeaf joined the [[World Federation of the Deaf]].

=== 2000s ===
The term Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) was coined by Andrew Tay in 2008. Tay emphasized the importance of SgSL in the deaf community to help deaf people develop their self-esteem, self-confidence, cognitive power as well as recognize their deaf identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tay-Pelz|first1=Ann|title=Andrew Tay's Sharing on Singapore Sign Language (SgSL)|agency=The Singapore Association for the Deaf|publisher=The Singapore Association for the Deaf|date=4 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Present ===
Today, sign language used in Singapore is a continually developing blend of Shanghainese, American and locally generated signs.&lt;ref name="Sign for Singapore"/&gt; It comprises different types of systems, including SEE-II, [[Pidgin Signed English|Pidgin Signed English (PSE)]] and gestures.&lt;ref name=SgSLSignBank&gt;{{cite web|title=SgSL Sign Bank|url=http://www.sadeaf.org.sg/sign-bank.htm|website=The Singapore Association for the Deaf|publisher=SADeaf|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; SgSL is socially recognised and accepted by the deaf community in Singapore, and is a reflection of Singapore's diverse linguistic culture.

== Language and sign systems used in Singapore ==
While Singapore does not have a national sign language, the local deaf community recognizes Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) as Singapore’s native sign language. This is because sign language in Singapore has developed over the last 6 decades since the setting up of the first school for local deaf in 1954. Hence, there is crucial need to preserve and maintain local signs invented by the deaf community in Singapore since the early 1950s.&lt;ref name=SgSLSignBank/&gt; Various sign languages have been adopted and used by the local deaf community as a result of linguistic changes. SgSL is influenced by [[Chinese Sign Language|Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL)]], [[American Sign Language|American Sign Language (ASL)]], [[Signing Exact English|Signing Exact English (SEE-II)]] and locally developed signs.&lt;ref name="scholarbank.nus.edu.sg"/&gt; It also comprises different types of systems, including SEE-II, [[Pidgin Signed English|Pidgin Signed English (PSE)]] and [[gestures]].&lt;ref name=SgSLSignBank/&gt; Today, SgSL consists of the following language and sign systems:

=== Language systems ===

==== Shanghainese Sign Language (SSL) ====
{{Main|Chinese Sign Language}}

==== American Sign Language (ASL) ====
{{Main|American Sign Language}}

==== Pidgin Signed English (PSE) ====
{{Main|Pidgin Signed English}}
Pidgin Signed English (PSE) is a variety or style of language that arises from contact between natural sign language (in this case being SgSL) and the surrounding spoken language, or between different sign languages. It involves the use of SgSL following the spoken English Language word order with simplified or reduced grammar. The use of PSE also occurs when there is contact between two sign languages. In this instance, foreign signs borrowing, code switching, [[fingerspelling]], [[mouthing]], and mixed systems are used.&lt;ref name=SgSLSignBank/&gt;

=== Sign system ===

==== Signed Exact English (SEE-II) ====
{{Main| Signing Exact English}}
SEE-II is a [[Manually Coded English]] system. It is a sign system that English Language visual through the hands. It was developed in 1969 in Southern California, USA with the aim of teaching deaf children English. About 75% to 80% of SEE-II signs are either borrowed from ASL or modified ASL signs. Unlike ASL, SEE-II is not a language but merely a mode of communication.&lt;ref name=SgSLSignBank/&gt;

== Current approaches to deaf education ==

=== Oral approach ===
Children with hearing impairments receive education through the oral approach method at the Canossian School for the Hearing Impaired (CSHI). The Directory of Services for the Disabled states that students at CSHI are taught using the Natural Auditory-Oral Philosophy, which emphasises the use of audition. Unlike students from the Singapore School of the Deaf (SSD), which is at present the only other Singaporean school specialized in education for deaf children, teaching is done without any form of signs or sign language. Hearing-impaired pupils in general public schools access the school curriculum through speech, in the same environment like their hearing classmates.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Phua Su Yin|first1=Mandy|title=The Language Skills of Singaporean Deaf Children Using Total Communication|url=http://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/bitstream/handle/10635/13863/ThesisMandyPhua.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technological progress and development of hearing aids and [[cochlear implant]]s allow hearing-impaired children to participate in class. Additional therapy programmes provided by schools and other specialized institutions, as in the case of CSHI with their Audio Verbal Therapy (AVT) or the Listen and Talk programme at the Singapore General Hospital, aim to improve performance of hearing-impaired children in a beneficial setting. The Listen and Talk Programme uses the Auditory-Verbal approach, which helps children access speech and language primarily through auditory input. It allows to integrate affected children in mainstream schools so that their hearing classmates function as important language models in their learning process.

=== Sign approach ===

[[American Sign Language|American Sign Language (ASL)]] was introduced to Singapore’s deaf community by Lim Chin Heng, in 1974. Lim Chin Heng was instructed by Peng Tsu Ying and additionally studied English and ASL at [[Gallaudet University]] in the United States. During that period, mainstream education in Singapore shifted from a diverse to a uniform language teaching system. English was promoted as the language of instruction in Singaporean schools, and therefore ASL served as a medium of instruction. ASL is still used in Singapore today.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

[[Signing Exact English|Signing Exact English (SEE-II)]] is not a language itself but a sign coded version of English, meaning it utilises the vocabulary of ASL with the English grammar. 

== Challenges ==
{{Main| Sign Language}} 
Sign language is often viewed as subordinate to spoken language. For both adults and children within the deaf community, this perception, to some extent, leads to them becoming unable to learn sign language, which negatively impacts them socially. The Deaf and Hard of Hearing Federation of Singapore acknowledges that sign language is not the popular choice to educate the deaf population, but it is of good benefit for parents to expose their deaf children to both sign and oral language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boh|first1=Samantha|title=Don't shrug off sign language, say groups|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/dont-shrug-sign-language-say-groups|website=AsiaOne Singapore|publisher=AsiaOne News Singapore|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Local Observations ===
It is difficult to determine if a bilingual (native sign language and English) education program for the deaf in Singapore would be beneficial, since little is known about their language. There is a lack of government documentation that recognizes a native sign language in Singapore, thus there is also not much regulation in place to monitor how useful sign language is for Singaporeans and its deaf population; it is a continuing process in improving its application.&lt;ref name="scholarbank.nus.edu.sg"/&gt;

In Singapore, no one has been able to identify a language that is native of the deaf population, although the public would say that the deaf use "sign language" to communicate. This "sign language", [[Signing Exact English]] (SEE-II), is not a sign language, but a [[Manually Coded English]] sign system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yin|first1=Mandy Phua Su|title=The Language Skills of Singaporean Deaf Children Using Total Communication|url=http://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/bitstream/handle/10635/13863/ThesisMandyPhua.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the SEE-II system is continually being used to help deaf people improve their grasp of English, Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) is evolving as another method for them to communicate. And both of these systems pose challenges to establishing sign language as a standard in Singapore.

=== Challenges facing Signing Exact English (SEE-II) ===

The use of SEE-II to educate Singaporean deaf children and even adults, is an ongoing issue. This is because most of the deaf population in Singapore are not raised in English-speaking homes. Thus, parents have a difficulty learning sign language because these classes are conducted only in English and SEE-II.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Wang|first1=Li-Sa|title=The Politics of Educating the Deaf In Singapore: Challenges to Achieving Inclusion}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind these systems is that Deaf children will learn English better if they are exposed, visually through signs, to the grammatical features of English. However, exposure to them does not always provide children with the complete linguistic access, which is needed to internalize the whole language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zak|first1=Omer|title=Methods of Communication with the Deaf|url=http://www.zak.co.il/d/deaf-info/old/methods#see1see2|website=Deaf-Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, there needs to be a better way for parents with [[hearing-impaired]] children to effectively communicate with them. On the other hand, if this concern with SEE-II is left unaddressed, more parents may choose to not educate their sons and/or daughters using SEE-II or sign language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephenson|first1=Patrice|last2=Zawolkow|first2=Esther|title=Communication Considerations: Signing Exact English (SEE)|url=http://www.handsandvoices.org/comcon/articles/see.htm|website=Hands &amp; Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Challenges facing Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) ===
There is a need to standardize the use of Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) based on cultural elements. Language instruction of [[Signing Exact English]] for the Deaf does not get used when they are amongst themselves in the deaf community. Despite SEE-II being adopted as the language of instruction among deaf children in Singapore since 1977, and its use as a system of communication in the Deaf community in Singapore, it is of utmost importance to preserve and maintain local signs invented by the Deaf community in Singapore since the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SgSL sign bank|url=http://www.sadeaf.org.sg/sign-bank.htm|publisher=The Singapore Association for the Deaf}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Singapore Sign Language (SgSL), depending on the background of the Deaf, local signs of SgSL often are invented and used by them, and they are not necessarily formally and officially indexed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mini Enabling Master Plan 2012|url=http://www.sadeaf.org.sg/Mini%20Enabling%20Master%20Plan.pdf|website=SADeaf|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a concern such that essentially, the SgSL language lends itself to many ambiguities when it comes to its expression. Additionally, Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) has not gone through any form of linguistic research/study; this is because of a lack in government resources and funding. This basically means that it is hard to rely on the deaf population to provide updates on the local vocabularies and sign systems of SgSL, and poses an even greater obstacle for the Sign Language Interpreting community in gaining a better handle on and about the language itself.

Currently, the Linguistic Sub-Committee at the Singapore Association does exciting research into SgSL for the Deaf (SADeaf). They aim to set up a sign bank to record locally developed signs and also to better understand SgSL so as to create resources for the general public as well as members of the Deaf community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sign Language and Deaf Community|url=http://sadeafyblog.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/jan14-sign-language-and-deaf-community/|website=sadeafyblog}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are trying to progress in the research of SgSL in order to lead to corpus development. And out of corpus development, the aim is to produce material that is more accurate in the teaching of the sign language. This, however, will take a long time to happen, for this is still in the beginning stages; this is the case because the matter is highly complex in Singapore.

== Moving forward ==
[[File:SgSL Week 2014 poster.jpg|thumb|The Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) Week 2014, in conjunction with the International Week for the Deaf, is a platform for the local deaf community to promote the awareness of SgSL and [[Deaf culture]].]]
The Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) linguistics sub-committee has been formed to perform research on SgSL that will eventually lead to corpus development, which will be used to produce material that is more accurate in the teaching of SgSL. The committee is currently in its second term. Plans have also been made to start a preschool that focuses on language acquisition.

In addition, SADeaf organises carnivals and exhibition with its partners to reach out and promote public understanding of deafness and awareness of deaf people in the society. SADeaf has recently organised SgSL Week 2014, from 22 to 28 September 2014, in conjunction with International Week for the Deaf. The theme for International Week for the Deaf is “Strengthening Human Diversity”. The SgSL Week is a platform for the local deaf community to stand proud as Deaf, and to promote the awareness of SgSL and [[Deaf culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Singapore Association for the Deaf homepage|url=http://www.sadeaf.org.sg/index.htm|website=The Singapore Association for the Deaf|publisher=The Singapore Association for the Deaf|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the situation in Singapore, there are further recommendations that may be made in order for Singapore Sign Language (SgSL) to progress further, and establish itself in a more prominent sense. More hearing people in Singapore will need to be educated in SgSL, learn it and the manual alphabet to provide more communication and social interaction between deaf and the hearing populations alike.&lt;ref name='JS2'&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Submission of Can! and Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Federation|url=http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/session11/SG/JS2_JointSubmission2-eng.pdf|publisher=Universal Periodic Review-Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; What has been recognized is the need to give every deaf child as early as possible in his/her life as much language education as possible through whatever correct communication input; sign language education to meet their needs; need not there to be method(s) of communication to the exclusion of others.&lt;ref name='JS2'/&gt;

'''Skolt Sami''' ({{lang|sms|sääʹmǩiõll}} {{IPA|[ɕa̟ːmc͡çjɘhlː]}} 'the Saami language' or ''nuõrttsääʹmǩiõll'' {{IPA|[nwɘrhtːɕa̟ːmc͡çjɘhlː]}} if a distinction needs to be made between it and the other Sami languages) is a [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Sami languages|Sami]] [[language]] that is spoken by the [[Skolts]], with approximately 300 speakers in [[Finland]], mainly in [[Sevettijärvi]] and approximately 20–30 speakers of the Njuõʹttjäuʹrr (Notozero) dialect{{sfn|Sergejeva|2002|p=107}} in an area surrounding [[Lake Lovozero]] in [[Russia]]. Skolt Sami also used to be spoken in the [[Neiden, Finnmark|Neiden]] area of [[Norway]].{{sfn|Sergejeva|2002|p=107}} It is written using a modified Roman [[orthography]] which was made official in 1973.

The term ''Skolt'' was coined by representatives of the majority culture and has negative connotation which can be compared to the term ''Lapp''. Nevertheless it is used in cultural and linguistic studies.{{sfn|Sergejeva|2002|p=103}}
[[File:Sami dialects and settlements in Russia map.svg|thumbnail|300px|Sami dialects and settlements in Russia:
{{legend|magenta|Skolt (Russian ''Notozersky'')}}
]]

==History==
On Finnish territory Skolt Sami was spoken in four villages before the Second World War. In [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]], Skolt Sami was spoken in Suonikylä and the village of Petsamo. This area was ceded to Russia in the [[Second World War]], and the Skolts were evacuated to the villages of [[Inari (village)|Inari]], [[Sevettijärvi]] and [[Nellim]] in the [[Inari, Finland|Inari]] municipality. 

On the Russian (then Soviet) side the dialect was spoken in the now defunct Sami settlements of Motovsky, Songelsky, [[Lake Notozero|Notozero]] (hence its Russian name – the ''Notozersky'' dialect). Some speakers still may live in the villages of [[Tuloma (rural locality)|Tuloma]] and [[Lovozero (rural locality)|Lovozero]].

==Status==

Skolt Sami is spoken by approximately 400 people by the government as one of the official [[Sami languages]] used in [[Sápmi (area)|Lapland]] and can thus be used by anyone conducting official business in that area. It is an official language in the municipality of [[Inari, Finland|Inari]], and elementary schools there offer courses in the language, both for native speakers and for students learning it as a foreign language. Only a small number of youths do learn the language and continue to use it actively. Skolt Sami is thus a seriously [[endangered language]], even more seriously than [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]] in the same [[Municipalities of Finland|municipality]], which has a nearly equal number of speakers.

From 1978 to 1986, the Skolts had a quarterly called [[Sääʹmođđâz]] published in their own language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.saaminuett.fi/kolttasaamelaiset/koltansaamen-kielestae/saamoddaz.html |title= Sää'mođđâz-lehti |author= |date= |work= |publisher= Saa'mi Nue'tt ry |accessdate=27 April 2011 | language = Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013 a new magazine called [[Tuõddri pee'rel]] has been published once a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://oddaz.saaminuett.fi/2013/11/27/tuoddri-peerel-2014-tarinoita-kolttasaamelaisesta-kulttuurista-elamasta-ja-ihmisista/ |title= Tuõddri pee'rel 2014 – Tarinoita kolttasaamelaisesta kulttuurista, elämästä ja ihmisistä |author= |date= |work= |publisher= Saa'mi Nue'tt ry |accessdate= 21 September 2016 | language = Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, [[language immersion]] programs for children younger than 7 were created. At present, however, no funding has been forthcoming for these programs in years and as a result they are on hold. These programs were extremely important in creating the youngest generation of Skolt Sami speakers. In recent years, these programs have been reinstated.

Like [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]], Skolt Sami has recently borne witness to a new phenomenon, namely it is being used in rock songs
sung by [[Tiina Sanila]], who has published two full-length CDs in Skolt Sami to date.

In addition, 2005 saw the first time that it was possible to use Skolt Sami in a Finnish matriculation examination, albeit as a foreign language. In 2012, Ville-Riiko Fofonoff ({{lang-sms|Läärvan-Oʹlssi-Peâtt-Rijggu-Vääʹsǩ-Rijggu-Ville-Reeiǥaž}}) was the first person to have Skolt Sami for the mother tongue portion of the exam; for this, he won the [[Skolt of the Year Award]] the same year.&lt;ref name="oddaz2012"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oddaz.saaminuett.fi/2012/12/03/ville-riiko-fofonoff-on-vuoden-koltta-2012/|title=Ville-Riiko Fofonoff on Vuoden koltta 2012|trans-title= Ville-Riiko Fofonoff is Skolt of the Year 2012|author=Moshnikoff, Minna|publisher=Saaʹmi Nueʹtt|date=3 December 2012|language= Finnish and Skolt Sámi|access-date=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Finnish news program [[Yle Ođđasat]] featured a Skolt Sami speaking newsreader for the first time on 26 August 2016. Otherwise Yle Ođđasat presents individual news stories in Skolt Sami every now and then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://yle.fi/uutiset/yle_oasat_koltansaameksi_ensimmaista_kertaa/9122148 |title= Yle Ođđasat koltansaameksi ensimmäistä kertaa |author= |date= |work= |publisher= Yle |accessdate= 21 September 2016 | language = Finnish }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there have been various TV programs in Skolt Sámi on YLE such as the children's TV series ''Binnabánnaš''.

==Writing system==

Skolt Sami uses the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]] with the addition of some special characters:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"

Notes:
* The letters [[Q]]/q, [[W]]/w, [[X]]/x, [[Y]]/y and [[Ö]]/ö are also used, although only in foreign words or loans.
* No difference is made in the standard orthography between {{IPA|/e/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}}. In dictionaries, grammars and other reference works, the letter {{angbr|ẹ}} is used to indicate {{IPA|/ɛ/}}.
* The combinations {{angbr|lj}} and {{angbr|nj}} indicate the consonants {{IPA|/ʎ/}} and {{IPA|/ɲ/}} respectively.

Additional marks are used in writing Skolt Sami words:
* A [[prime (symbol)|prime symbol]] ʹ (U+02B9 MODIFIER LETTER PRIME) or standalone acute accent ´ or ˊ (U+00B4 ACUTE ACCENT or U+02CA MODIFIER LETTER ACUTE ACCENT) is added after the vowel of a syllable to indicate suprasegmental palatalization.
* An [[apostrophe]] ʼ (U+02BC MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE) is used in the combinations {{angbr|lʼj}} and {{angbr|nʼj}} to indicate that these are two separate sounds, not a single sound. It is also placed between identical consonants to indicate that they belong to separate prosodic feet, and should not be combined into a geminate. It distinguishes e.g. ''lueʹštted'' "to set free" from its causative ''lueʹštʼted'' "to cause to set free".
* A hyphen - is used in compound words when there are two identical consonants at the juncture between the parts of the compound, e.g. ''ǩiõtt-tel'' "mobile phone".
* A vertical line ˈ (U+02C8 MODIFIER LETTER VERTICAL LINE), [[typewriter apostrophe]] or other similar mark indicates that a geminate consonant is long, and the preceding diphthong is short. It is placed between a pair of identical consonants which are always preceded by a diphthong. This mark is not used in normal Skolt Sami writing, but it appears in dictionaries, grammars and other reference works.

==Phonology==
Special features of this Sami language include a highly complex vowel system and a suprasegmental contrast of palatalized vs. non-palatalized stress groups; palatalized stress groups are indicated by a "softener mark", represented by the modifier letter prime (ʹ).

===Vowels===

The system of vowel phonemes is as follows:

{| class="wikitable IPA" border="1"
!
! [[front vowel|front]]
! [[central vowel|central]]
! [[back vowel|back]]
|- align="center"
! [[close vowel|close]]
| i
| 
| u
|- align="center"
! [[close-mid vowel|close-mid]]
| e
| ɘ
| o
|- align="center"
! [[open-mid vowel|open-mid]]
| ɛ
| ɐ
| ɔ
|- align="center"
! [[open vowel|open]]
| a
|
| ɑ
|}

Long and short vowels contrast phonologically: cf. ''leʹtt'' ‘vessel’ vs. ''leeʹtt'' ‘vessels’. All vowels can occur as both long and short.

The vowels can combine to form twelve opening [[diphthong]]s:

{| class="wikitable IPA" border="1"
|
! [[front vowel|front]]
! [[front vowel|front]] to [[central vowel|central]]
! [[back vowel|back]] to [[front vowel|front]]

! [[back vowel|back]] 
|- align="center"
! [[close vowel|close]] to [[close-mid vowel|close-mid]]
| {{Not a typo|ie}}

All diphthongs can occur as both long and short, although this is not indicated in spelling. Short diphthongs are distinguished from long ones by both length and stress placement: short diphthongs have a stressed second component, whereas long diphthongs have stress on the first component. 

Diphthongs may also have two variants depending on whether they occur in a plain or palatalized environment. This has a clearer effect with diphthongs whose second element is back or central. Certain inflectional forms, including the addition of the palatalizing suprasegmental, also trigger a change in diphthong quality.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Skolt Saami|last=Feist|first=Timothy|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=Manchester|pages=37-38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Unvoiced stops and affricates are pronounced preaspirated after vowels and [[sonorant consonant|sonorant]] consonants.
* Voiced stops and affricates are usually pronounced just weakly voiced.
* Older speakers realize the palatal affricates {{IPA|/c͡ç, ɟ͡ʝ/}} as plosives {{IPA|[{{IPA link|c}}, {{IPA link|ɟ}}]}}.
* In initial position, {{IPA|/x/}} is realized as glottal {{IPAblink|h}}.

Consonants may be phonemically short or long ([[geminate]]) both word-medially or word-finally; both are exceedingly common. Long and short consonants also contrast in consonant clusters, cf. ''kuõskkâd'' 'to touch' : ''kuõskâm'' 'I touch'. A short period of voicelessness or ''h'', known as preaspiration, before geminate consonants is observed, much as in [[Icelandic orthography|Icelandic]], but this is not marked orthographically, e.g. ''joʹǩǩe'' 'to the river' is pronounced {{IPA|[jo̟hk̟k̟e]}}.

===Suprasegmentals===

There is one phonemic [[suprasegmental]], the [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalizing]] suprasegmental that affects the pronunciation of an entire syllable. In written language the palatalizing suprasegmental is indicated with a free-standing acute accent between a stressed vowel and the following consonant, as follows:

::''vääʹrr'' 'mountain, hill' (suprasegmental palatalization present)
::cf. ''väärr'' 'trip' (no suprasegmental palatalization)

The suprasegmental palatalization has three distinct phonetic effects:

* The stressed vowel is pronounced as slightly more fronted in palatalized syllables than in non-palatalized ones.
* When the palatalizing suprasegmental is present, the following consonant or consonant cluster is pronounced as weakly palatalized. It should be noted that suprasegmental palatalization is independent of segmental palatals: inherently palatal consonants (i.e. consonants with palatal place of articulation) such as the palatal glide /j/, the palatal nasal /ɲ/ (spelled {{angbr|nj}}) and the palatal lateral approximant /ʎ/ (spelled {{angbr|lj}}) can occur both in non-palatalized and suprasegmentally palatalized syllables.
* If the word form is monosyllabic and ends in a consonant, a non-phonemic weakly voiced or unvoiced vowel is pronounced after the final consonant. This vowel is ''e''-colored if suprasegmental palatalization is present, but ''a''-colored if not.

===Stress===

Skolt Sami has four different types of stress for words:

*Primary stress
*Secondary stress
*Tertiary stress
*Zero stress

The first syllable of any word is always the primary stressed syllable in Skolt Sami as Skolt is a fixed-stress language. In words with two or more syllables, the final syllable is quite lightly stressed (tertiary stress) and the remaining syllable, if any, are stressed more heavily than the final syllable, but less than the first syllable (secondary stress).

Using the [[abessive]] and the [[comitative]] [[Grammatical number|singular]] in a word appears to disrupt this system, however, in words of more than one syllable. The suffix, as can be expected, has tertiary stress, but the penultimate syllable also has tertiary stress, even though it would be expected to have secondary stress.

Zero stress can be said to be a feature of [[conjunctions]], [[postpositions]], [[grammatical particle|particles]] and monosyllabic pronouns.

==Grammar==

Skolt Sami is a [[synthetic language|synthetic]], highly [[inflection|inflected]] language that shares many grammatical features with the other [[Uralic languages]]. However, Skolt Sami is not a typical [[agglutinative language]] like many of the other Uralic languages are, as it has developed considerably into the direction of a [[fusional language]], much like [[Estonian language|Estonian]]. Therefore, cases and other grammatical features are also marked by modifications to the root and not just marked with suffixes. Many of the suffixes in Skolt Sami are [[portmanteau|portmanteau morphemes]] that express several grammatical features at a time.

===Umlaut===

[[Umlaut (linguistics)|Umlaut]] is a pervasive phenomenon in Skolt Sami, whereby the vowel in the second syllable affects the quality of the vowel in the first. The presence of absence of palatalisation can also be considered an umlaut effect, since it is also conditioned by the second-syllable vowel, although it affects the entire syllable rather than the vowel alone. Umlaut is complicated by the fact that many of the second-syllable vowels have disappeared in Skolt Sami, leaving the umlaut effects as their only trace.

The following table lists the Skolt Sami outcomes of the Proto-Samic first-syllable vowel, for each second-syllable vowel.

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! Proto
! *ā, *ō
! *ē
! *ë, *u
! *i
|-
! Skolt

|-
! *oa
| uä || uäʹ, uẹʹ || uå || ueʹ
|-
! *uo
| uâ || ueʹ || uõ || uõʹ
|}

Some notes:
* ''iẹʹ'' and ''uẹʹ'' appear before a quantity 2 consonant, ''eäʹ'' and ''uäʹ'' otherwise.

As can be seen, palatalisation is present before original second-syllable ''*ē'' and ''*i'', and absent otherwise. Where they survive in Skolt Sami, both appear as ''e'', so only the umlaut effect can distinguish them. The original short vowels ''*ë'', ''*u'' and ''*i'' have a general raising and backing effect on the preceding vowel, while the effect of original ''*ā'' and ''*ō'' is lowering. Original ''*ē'' is fronting (palatalising) without having an effect on height.

===Nouns===

====Cases====

Skolt Sami has 9 cases in the singular (7 of which also have a plural form), although the genitive and accusative are often the same. 

The following table shows the inflection of ''čuäcc'' ('rotten snag') with the single [[Morpheme|morphemes]] marking noun stem, number, and case separated by [[Hyphen|hyphens]] for better readability. The last morpheme marks for case, ''i'' marks the plural, and ''a'' is due to [[epenthesis]] and does not have a meaning of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Skolt Saami|last=Feist|first=Timothy|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=Manchester|pages=137-138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Nominative=====

Like the other [[Uralic languages]], the [[nominative]] singular is unmarked and indicates the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] or a [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. The nominative plural is also unmarked and always looks the same as the [[genitive]] singular.

=====Genitive=====

The ''genitive'' singular is unmarked and looks the same as the [[nominative]] plural. The genitive plural is marked by an ''-i''. The genitive is used:

*to indicate possession (''Tuʹst lij muu ǩeʹrjj.'' 'You have my book.')
*to indicate number, if said the number is between 2 and 6. (''Sieʹzzest lij kuõʹhtt põõrt.'' 'My father’s sister (my aunt) has two houses.')
*with prepositions (''rääi + [GEN]'': 'by something', 'beyond something')
*with most postpositions. (''Sij mõʹnne ääkkäd årra.'' 'They went to your grandmother's (house).', 'They went to visit your grandmother.')

The genitive has been replacing the partitive for some time and is nowadays more commonly used in its place.

=====Accusative=====

The [[accusative]] is the direct [[Object (grammar)|object]] case and it is unmarked in the singular. In the plural, its marker is ''-d'', which is preceded by the plural marker ''-i'', making it look the same as the plural [[illative]]. The accusative is also used to mark some adjuncts, e.g. ''obb tääʹlv'' ('the entire winter').

=====Locative=====

The [[locative]] marker in the singular is ''-st'' and ''-n'' in the plural. This case is used to indicate:

*where something is (''Kuäʹđe'''st''' lij ǩeʹrjj'': 'There is a book in the ''kota''.')
*where it is coming from (''Niõđ puõʹtte domoi Čeʹvetjääuʹre'''st''''': 'The girls came home from [[Sevettijärvi]].')
*who has possession of something (''Suʹ'''st''' lij čâustõk'': 'He/she has a lasso.')

In addition, it is used with certain verbs:

*to ask someone s.t. : kõõččâd [+loc]

=====Illative=====

The [[illative]] marker actually has three different markers in the singular to represent the same case: ''-a'', ''-e'' and ''-u''. The plural illative marker is ''-d'', which is preceded by the plural marker ''-i'', making it look the same as the plural [[accusative]]. This case is used to indicate:

*where something is going
*who is receiving something
*the indirect [[Object (grammar)|object]]

=====Comitative=====

The [[comitative]] marker in the singular is ''-in'' and ''-vuiʹm'' in the plural. The comitative is used to state ''with whom or what'' something was done:

*''Njääʹlm sekstet leeiʹn'''in'''.'' The mouth is wiped with a piece of cloth.
*''Vuõʹlǧǧem paaʹrni'''vuiʹm''' ceerkvest.'' I left church with the children.
*''Vuõʹlǧǧem vueʹbb'''in'''an ceerkvest.'' I left church with my sister.

To form the comitative singular, use the genitive singular form of the word as the [[Root (linguistics)|root]] and ''-in''. To form the comitative plural, use the plural genitive root and ''-vuiʹm''.

=====Abessive=====

The [[abessive]] marker is ''-tää'' in both the singular and the plural. It always has a tertiary stress.

*''Vuõʹlǧǧem paaʹrni'''tää''' ceerkvest.'' I left church without the children.
*''Sij mõʹnne niõđ'''tää''' põʹrtte.'' They went in the house without the girl.
*''Sij mõʹnne niõđi'''tää''' põʹrtte.'' They went in the house without the girls.

=====Essive=====

The dual form of the [[essive]] is still used with pronouns, but not with nouns and does not appear at all in the [[plural]].

=====Partitive=====

The [[partitive]] is only used in the [[Grammatical number|singular]] and can always be replaced by the genitive. The partitive marker is ''-d''.

1. It appears after numbers larger than six:

* ''kääuʹc čâustõkkâ'''d''''': 'eight lassos'

This can be replaced with ''kääʹuc čâustõõǥǥ''.

2. It is also used with certain [[postpositions]]:

*''kuäʹtte'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''d''' vuâstta'': 'against a kota'

This can be replaced with ''kuäʹđ vuâstta'

3. It can be used with the [[Comparison (grammar)|comparative]] to express that which is being compared:

* ''kåʹlle'''d''' pueʹrab'': 'better than gold'

This would nowadays more than likely be replaced by ''pueʹrab ko kåʹll''

==== Pronouns ====

===== Personal pronouns =====
The [[personal pronoun]]s have three numbers: singular, plural and [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]]. The following table contains personal pronouns in the nominative and genitive/accusative cases.

{| class="wikitable"
!&amp;nbsp;
!English

==== Possessive markers ====
Next to number and case, Skolt Sami nouns also inflect for possession. However, usage of [[Possessive affix|possessive affixes]] seems to decrease among speakers. The following table shows possessive [[inflection]] of the word ''muõrr'' ('tree'). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Skolt Saami|last=Feist|first=Timothy|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=Manchester|pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be seen that inflection involves changes to the verb stem as well as inflectional suffixes. Changes to the stem are based on verbs being categorized into several inflectional classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Skolt Saami|last=Feist|first=Timothy|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=Manchester|pages=115-136}}&lt;/ref&gt; The different inflectional suffixes are based on the categories listed below. 

====Person====

Skolt Sami [[verb]]s conjugate for four [[grammatical person]]s:

*first person
*second person
*third person
*[[Grammatical voice#Fourth person in Finnic languages|fourth person]], also called the indefinite person

====Mood====

Skolt Sami has 5 [[grammatical mood]]s:

*[[Grammatical mood#Indicative|indicative]]
*[[Imperative mood|imperative]] (''Pueʹtted sõrgg domoi!'' 'Come home soon!')
*[[Conditional mood|conditional]]
*[[Grammatical mood#Potential|potential]]
*[[Optative mood|optative]]{{Citation needed|reason=In Feist (2010), optative mood is not listed for Skolt Sami|date=May 2018}}

====Number====

Skolt Sami [[verb]]s conjugate for two [[grammatical number]]s:

*[[Grammatical number|singular]]
*[[plural]]

Unlike other Sami varieties, Skolt Sami verbs do not inflect for [[Dual grammatical number|dual]] number. Instead, verbs occurring with the dual personal pronouns appear in the corresponding plural form.

====Tense====

Skolt Sami has 2 [[Grammatical tense|simple tenses]]:

*[[Preterite|past]] (''Puõʹttem škoouʹle jåhtta.'' 'I came to school yesterday.')
*[[Grammatical tense|non-past]] (''Evvan puätt mu årra täʹbbe''. 'John is coming to my house today.')

and 2 [[compound tenses]]:

*[[Present perfect|perfect]]
*[[pluperfect]]

==== Non-finite verb forms ====
The verb forms given above are person-marked, also referred to as [[Finite verb|finite]]. In addtition to the finite forms, Skolt Sami verbs have twelve [[Participle|participial]] and [[converb]] forms, as well as the [[infinitive]], which are [[Nonfinite verb|non-finite]]. These forms are given in the table below for the verb ''kuullâd'' ('to hear').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Skolt Saami|last=Feist|first=Timothy|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=Manchester|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lee'd'' is used, for example, to assign tense to [[Lexical verb|lexical verbs]] in the [[Conditional mood|conditional]] or [[potential mood]] which are not marked for tense themselves:  

* ''Jiõm âʹte mon ni kõõjjče, jos mon teâđčem, '''leʹččem''' veär '''raajjâm''' ouddâl.''  

(negation (1st P. Sg.) – then – 1st P. Sg. – even – ask (negated conditional) – if – 1st P. Sg. – know (1st P. Sg. conditional) – '''be (1st P. Sg. conditional)''' – soup – '''make (past participle, no tense marking)''' – before) 

'I wouldn't even ask if I knew, if I had made soup before!'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Skolt Saami|last=Feist|first=Timothy|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=Manchester|pages=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=====Negative verb=====

Skolt Sami, like Finnish, the other Sami languages and Estonian, has a [[negative verb]]. In Skolt Sami, the negative verb conjugates according to [[Grammatical mood|mood]] (indicative, imperative and optative), [[Grammatical person|person]] (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th) and [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural).

Note that ''ij'' + ''leat'' is usually written as ''iʹlla'', ''iʹlleäkku'', ''iʹllää'' or ''iʹllä'' and ''ij'' + ''leat'' is usually written as ''jeäʹla'' or ''jeäʹlä''.

Unlike the other Sami languages, Skolt Sami no longer has separate forms for the dual and plural of the negative verb and uses the plural forms for both instead.

=== Word order ===

==== Declarative clauses ====
The most frequent word order in simple, [[Declarative sentence|declarative sentences]] in Skolt Sami is [[Subject–verb–object|subject-verb-object (SOV)]]. However, as cases are used to mark relations between different [[Noun phrase|noun phrases]], and verb forms mark person and number of the subject, Skolt Sami word order allows for some variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Skolt Saami|last=Feist|first=Timothy|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=Manchester|pages=278-281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of an SOV sentence would be:

* ''Neezzan suâjjkååutid kuårru.'' (woman (Pl., Nominative) – protection (Sg., Nominative) + skirt (Pl., Accusative) – sew (3rd P. Pl., Past)) 'The women sewed protective skirts.'

Intransitive sentences follow the order subject-verb (SV): 

* ''Jääuʹr kâʹlmme.'' (lake (Pl., Nominative) – freeze (3rd P. Pl., Present)) 'The lakes freeze.'

An exception to the SOV word order can be found in sentences with an [[auxiliary verb]]. While in other languages, an OV word order has been found to correlate with the auxiliary verb coming after the [[lexical verb]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Skolt Saami|last=Feist|first=Timothy|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=Manchester|pages=284}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the Skolt Sami auxiliary verb ''lee'd'' ('to be') precedes the lexical verb. This has been related to the [[V2 word order|verb-second (V2) phenomenon]] which binds the [[finite verb]] to at most the second position of the respective clause. However, in Skolt Sami, this effect seems to be restricted to clauses with an auxiliary verb.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Skolt Saami|last=Feist|first=Timothy|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=Manchester|pages=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An example of a sentence with the auxiliary in V2 position: 

* ''Kuuskõõzz '''leʹjje''' ääld poorrâm.'' (northern light (Pl., Nominative) – '''be''' (3rd P. Pl., Past) – female reindeer (Sg., Accusative) – eat (Past Participle)) 'The northern lights had eaten the female reindeer.' 

==== Interrogative clauses ====

===== Polar questions =====
In Skolt Sami, [[polar questions]], also referred to as yes-no questions, are marked in two different ways. [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphologically]], an [[interrogative]] [[Grammatical particle|particle]], ''-a'',  is added as an [[affix]] to the first word of the clause. [[Syntax|Syntactically]], the element which is in the scope of the question is moved to the beginning of the clause. If this element is the verb, subject and verb are inversed in comparison to the declarative SOV word order. 

* ''Vueʹlǧǧveʹted'''–a''' tuäna muu ooudâst eččan ääuʹd ool?'' (leave (2nd P. Pl., Present, Interrogative) – 2nd P. Dual Nominative – 1st P. Sg. Genitive – behalf – father (Sg. Genitive 1st P. Pl.) – grave (Sg. Genitive) – onto) 'Will the two of you go, on my behalf, to our father's grave?'

If an auxiliary verb is used, this is the one which is moved to the initial sentence position and also takes the interrogative affix. 

* ''Leäk'''–a''' ääʹvääm tõn uus?'' (be (2nd P. Sg., Present, Interrogative) – open (Past Participle) – that (Sg. Accusative) – door (Sg. Accusative)) 'Have you opened that door?'
* ''Leäk'''–a''' ton Jefremoff?'' (be (2nd P. Sg., Interrogative) – 2nd P. Sg. Nominative – Jefremoff) 'Are you Mr. Jefremoff?'

A negated polar question, using the negative auxiliary verb, shows the same structure: 

* ''Ij'''–a''' kõskklumâs villjad puättam?'' (Negation 3rd P. Sg., Interrogative – middle – brother (Sg. Nominative, 2nd P. Sg.) – come (Past Participle)) 'Didn't your middle brother come?'

An example of the interrogative particle being added to something other than the verb, would be the following: 

* ''Võl'''–a''' lie mainnâz?'' (still (Interrogative) – be (3rd P. Sg., Present) – story (Pl., Nominative)) 'Are there still stories to tell?'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Skolt Saami|last=Feist|first=Timothy|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=Manchester|pages=319-321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Information questions =====
Information questions in Skolt Sami are formed with a question word in clause-initial position. There also is a gap in the sentence indicating the missing piece of information. This kind of structure is similar to [[Wh-movement]] in languages such as [[English language|English]]. There are mainly three question words corresponding to the English 'what', 'who', and 'which' (out of two). They inflect for number and case, except for the latter which only has singular forms. It is noteworthy that the illative form of ''mii'' ('what') corresponds to the English 'why'. The full inflectional paradigm of all three question words can be found below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Skolt Saami|last=Feist|first=Timothy|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=Manchester|pages=325-326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of information questions using one of the three question words: 

* '''''Mâiʹd''' reäǥǥak?'' (what (Sg., Accusative) – cry (2nd P. Sg., Present)) 'What are you crying about?'
* '''''Mõõzz''' pueʹttiǩ?'' (what (Sg., Illative) – come (2nd P. Sg., Past)) 'Why did you come?'
* '''''Ǩii''' tuʹst leäi risttjeäʹnn?'' (who (Sg., Nominative) – 2nd P. Sg., Locative – be (3rd P. Sg., Past) – godmother (Sg., Nominative) 'Who was your godmother?'
* '''''Kuäbbaž''' alttad heibbad?'' (which (Sg., Nominative) – begin (3rd P. Sg., Present) – wrestle (Infinitive)) 'Which one of you will begin to wrestle?'

In addition to the above-mentioned, there are other question words which are not inflected, such as the following: 

* ''koʹst'': 'where', 'from where'
* ''koozz'': 'to where'
* ''kuäʹss'': 'when'
* ''mäʹhtt'': 'how'
* ''måkam'': 'what kind'

An example sentence would be the following: 

* '''''Koozz''' vuõʹlǧǧiǩ?'' (to where – leave (2nd P. Sg., Past)) 'Where did you go?'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Skolt Saami|last=Feist|first=Timothy|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=Manchester|pages=326-328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Imperative clauses ====
The Skolt Sami imperative generally takes a clause-initial position. Out of the five imperative forms (see [[Skolt Sami language#Verbs|above]]), those of the second person are most commonly used.  

* '''''Puäʹđ''' mij årra kuâssa!'' (come (2nd P. Sg., Imperative) – 1st P. Pl., Genitive – way – on a visit) 'Come and visit us at our place!'

Imperatives in the first person form, which only exist as plurals, are typically used for [[hortative]] constructions, that is for encouraging the listener (not) to do something. These imperatives include both the speaker and the listener. 

* '''''Äʹlǧǧep''' heibbad!'' (start (1st P. Pl., Imperative) – wrestle (Infinitive)) 'Let's start to wrestle!'

Finally, imperatives in the third person are used in [[Jussive mood|jussive]] constructions, the [[Grammatical mood|mood]] used for orders and commands. 

* '''''Kuärŋŋaz''' sij tieʹrm ool!'' (climb (3rd P. Pl., Imperative) – 3rd P. Pl., Nominative – hill (Sg., Genitive) – onto) 'Let them climb to the top of the hill!'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Skolt Saami|last=Feist|first=Timothy|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=|location=Manchester|pages=329-330}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sterjo Spasse''' (1914–1989) was an [[Albanians|Albanian]] writer.

==Life==
Sterjo Spasse was born in 1914 in [[Gollomboç]], [[Liqenas Municipality]], [[Korçë District]], [[Albania]], of [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.al/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&amp;pg=PA427&amp;dq=sterjo+spasse+elsie&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBkQ6AEwAGoVChMIxt-1p9GIyQIVAvsOCh14iQNr#v=onepage&amp;q=sterjo%20spasse%20elsie&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Spasse pursued the elementary school in [[Korçë]], and later, the [[Shkolla Normale e Elbasanit]]. He worked as a teacher in [[Derviçan]], in the [[Dropull]] region,&lt;ref name="Elsie"&gt;{{citation|publisher=Robert Elsie|url=http://www.albanianliterature.net/authors_classical/spasse.html|title=Biography of Sterjo Spasse|accessdate=2013-09-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927082847/http://www.albanianliterature.net/authors_classical/spasse.html|archivedate=2013-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then went to the [[University of Florence]], Italy to study [[Pedagogy]]. He also pursued a master in literature in the [[Soviet Union]]. After World War II he worked as a literary critic and writer in the pedagogic magazines ''The new school'' ({{lang-sq|Shkolla e re}}), and ''The popular education'' ({{lang-sq|Arsimi popullor}}), as well as ''Our Literature'' ({{lang-sq|Literatura jonë}}), and ''November'' ({{lang-sq|[[Nëntori]]}}). He was a member of the [[Albanian League of Writers and Artists]].&lt;ref name="Nga jeta"&gt;{{citation|title=STERJO SPASSE ''Nga jeta në jetë PSE ?!...''| page= 211 |section=Shënime për autorin (Notes on the author)|language=Albanian|edition=2 |publisher= Redaksia e Botimeve "RILINDJA"|location= Prishtina|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spasse died in [[Tirana]], Albania in 1989.

Along his various contributions in the pedagogic field and translations, his main fieldwork was creative writing, which started in the 1930s. He published four collections of short stories and 10 novels:&lt;ref name="Nga jeta"/&gt;

Spasse's novel ''Pse?'' is considered to be perhaps one of the greatest Albanian novels of the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="Elsie" /&gt;

A  '''clamp''' is a compact heap, mound or pile of materials.&lt;ref&gt;"Cramp, n.3." ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A '''storage clamp''' is used in the [[agriculture|agricultural industry]] for temporary storage of root crops such as [[potato]], [[turnip]], [[rutabaga]], [[mangelwurzel]], and [[sugar beet]].

A clamp is formed by excavating a shallow rectangular depression in a field to make a base for the clamp. Root crops are then stacked onto the base up to a height of about {{cvt|2|m}}. When the clamp is full, the earth scraped from the field to make the base is then used to cover the root crops to a depth of several inches. [[Straw]] or old [[hay]] may be used to protect the upper surface from rain erosion.

A well-made clamp will keep the vegetables cool and dry for many months. Most clamps are relatively long and narrow, allowing the crops to be progressively removed from one end without disturbing the remaining vegetables. The use of a clamp allows a farmer to feed vegetables into market over many months.

The '''Triqui''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|iː|k|i}}), or '''Trique''', languages are [[Oto-Manguean]] languages of Mexico spoken by the [[Trique people]]  of the state of [[Oaxaca]] and the state of [[Baja California]] (due to recent population movements). They belong to the [[Mixtecan languages|Mixtecan]] branch together with the [[Mixtec languages]] and [[Cuicatec]].&lt;ref&gt;The proposal to group Mixtec, Trique and Cuicatec into a single family (none more closely related to one than to the other) was made by Longacre (1957) with convincing evidence.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties==
''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists three major varieties: 
* Triqui de Copala spoken by 15,000 people (1990 census) in [[San Juan Copala]], Oaxaca (and recently due to migrations in the [[San Quintín, Baja California|San Quintín valley]], [[Baja California]]).
* Triqui de San Andrés Chicahuaxtla spoken by 6,000 people in [[San Andrés Chicahuaxtla]], Oaxaca.
* Triqui de San Martín Itunyoso spoken by 2,000 people (1983 survey) in [[San Martín Itunyoso]], Oaxaca.

Mexico's federal agency for its indigenous languages, [[Instituto Nacional de Lenguas Indígenas]] (INALI), identifies four varieties of Trique in its ''Catálogo de las lenguas indígenas nacionales'' published in early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;The catalogue is the result of a project completed by INALI in 2007 in fulfillment of its obligations under Mexican federal law to document and enumerate the indigenous languages of Mexico. The catalogue was published in the federal government's [[public journal|official gazette]], the ''[[Diario Oficial de la Federación]]'' (DOF).&lt;/ref&gt; The variants listed by INALI are:

==Phonology==
All varieties of Triqui are [[Tonal language|tonal]] and have complex phonologies. The tone system of Copala Triqui is the best described and has eight tones.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hollenbach, Barbara. The Phonology and Morphology of Tone and Laryngeals in Copala Trique. Ph.D Thesis, University of Arizona. 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Tones in Triqui languages are typically written with superscript numbers,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; so that ''chraa&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'' 'river' indicates the syllable ''chraa'' with the highest (5) tone, while ''cha&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;na&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' 'woman' has the middle (3) tone on the first syllable and the lowest (1) tone on the second syllable.

Of the Triqui languages, the Copala dialect has undergone the most vowel loss, with many non-final syllables losing their vowels. The result, as in many other Oto-Manguean languages, is a complex set of consonant clusters. So, for instance, the word ''si&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;kuj&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'' 'cow' in Itunyoso Triqui corresponds to ''skuj&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;'' in Copala Triqui.

The tonal phonology of other Triqui languages is more complex than Copala Triqui. The tone system of Itunyoso Triqui has nine tones.&lt;ref&gt;DiCanio, Christian. The Phonetics and Phonology of San Martín Itunyoso Trique. Ph.D Thesis, University of California, Berkeley. 2008. Available [http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~dicanio/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; The tone system of Chicahuaxtla Triqui has at least 10 tones &lt;ref&gt;Good, Claude. Diccionario Triqui, volume 20 of Serie de Vocabularios Indigenas. Summer Institute of Linguistics, Mexico. 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; but may have as many as 16.&lt;ref&gt;Longacre, Robert E. Proto-Mixtecan. In Indiana University Research Center in Anthropology, Folklore, and Linguistics, volume 5. Indiana University Research Center in Anthropology, Folklore, and Linguistics, Bloomington. 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthography==
Triqui has been written in a number of different orthographies, depending on the intended audience. Linguists typically write the language with all tones fully marked and all phonemes represented. However, in works intended for native speakers of Triqui, a practical orthography is often used with a somewhat simpler representation.

The following Copala Triqui example is written in both the linguistic and the practical orthographies:&lt;ref&gt;Hollenbach, Barbara. Vocabulario breve del triqui de San Juan Copala. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| ''Gloss''

| 3rd person

'To whom are you speaking?' (¿Con quién estás hablando?)

==Morphology==
Triqui morphology is fairly limited. Verbs take a /k-/ prefix (spelled ''c-'' or ''qu-'') to show completive aspect:

A'mii&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; zo'&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
'You are speaking'.

C-a'mii&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt; zo'&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
'You spoke'.

The same /k-/ prefix plus a tonal change shows the potential aspect:

C-a'mii&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; zo'&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.
'You will speak.'

The tonal changes associated with the potential aspect are complex but always involve lowering the tone of the root (Hollenbach 1984).

There are also complex phonological processes that are triggered by the presence of root-final clitic pronouns. These pronouns (especially the first- and the second-person singular) may change the shape of the stem or alter its tone.

As a language subfamily, Triqui is interesting for having a large tonal inventory, complex morphophonology, and interesting syntactic phenomena, much of which has yet to be described.

==Syntax==
Copala Triqui has a [[verb-subject-object]] word order:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|-
| A’nii&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;
| Mariia&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
| chraa&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| raa&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
| yoo&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
| a&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;.
|-
| put
| Maria
| tortilla
| in
| tenate
| declarative
|}
'Maria put the tortilla in the tenate.'

Copala Triqui has an accusative marker maa&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or man&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, which is obligatory for animate pronominal objects but optional otherwise:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|-
| Quene'e&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| Mariia&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
| (maa&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
| chraa&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
| a&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;.
|-
| saw
| Maria
| acc
| tortilla
| declarative
|}
'Maria saw the tortilla.'

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|-
| Quene'e&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| Mariia&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
| *(maa&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
| zo'&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
| a&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;.
|-
| saw
| Maria
| acc
| you
| declarative
|}
'Maria saw you.'

This use of the accusative before some objects and not others is what is called [[differential object marking]].

The following example (repeated from above) shows a Copala Triqui question:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Me&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
| zii&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;
| riaan&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;
| a'mii&lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;
| zo'&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
| ga&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| wh
| 3rd person
| to
| speak
| 2nd person
| interrogative
|}

'To whom are you speaking?' (¿Con quién estas hablando?)

As this example shows, Copala Trique has [[wh-movement]] and [[pied-piping with inversion]].

Copala Triqui syntax is described in Hollenbach (1992).

Triqui is interesting for having toggle processes as well. For negation, a completive aspect prefix signifies the negative potential. A potential aspect prefix in the same context signifies the negative completive.

'''Yiddish orthography''' is the [[writing system]] used for the [[Yiddish language]]. It includes Yiddish [[spelling]] rules and the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew script]], which is used as the basis of a full vocalic [[alphabet]]. Letters that are silent or [[glottal stop]]s in the [[Hebrew language]] are used as [[vowel]]s in Yiddish. Other letters that can serve as both vowels and consonants are either read as appropriate to the context in which they appear or are differentiated by [[Diacritic|diacritical marks]] derived from the Hebrew [[Niqqud|''nikkud'']], commonly referred to as "points". Additional [[phonetic]] distinctions between letters that share the same base character are also indicated by pointing or by the adjacent placement of otherwise silent base characters. Several Yiddish points are not commonly used in any present-day Hebrew context and others are used in a manner that is specific to Yiddish orthography. There is significant variation in the way this is applied in literary practice. There are also several differing approaches to the disambiguation of characters that can be used as either vowels or consonants.

Words of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and Hebrew origin are normally written in the traditional orthography of the source language—i.e., the orthography of these words, which is consonant-based, is generally preserved ([[#niborski2012|Niborski 2012]]). All other Yiddish words are represented with a [[phonemic orthography]]. Both forms can appear in a single word—for example, where a Yiddish [[affix]] is applied to a Hebrew stem. Yiddish pointing may also be applied to words that are otherwise written entirely with traditional orthography.

==Reform and standardisation==
[[Image:Tevye-nyc.jpg|thumb|120px|left|Traditional orthography]] 
[[Image:Tevye.jpg|thumb|105px|Soviet orthography]]
In the early 20th century, for cultural and political reasons, efforts were initiated toward the development of a uniform Yiddish orthography. A specimen initial practice was described in detail by the Yiddish lexicographer [[Alexander Harkavy]] in a ''Treatise on Yiddish Reading, Orthography, and Dialectal Variations'' first published in 1898 together with his Yiddish-English Dictionary ([[#harkavy1898|Harkavy 1898]]). Additional illustrations of this variation are provided in source excerpts in [[#fishman1981|Fishman 1981]], which also contains a number of texts specifically about the need (pro and con) for a uniform orthography. A detailed chronology of the major events during this normative action, including rosters of conference participants, bibliographic references to the documents they produced, and summaries of their contents, is given in Yiddish in [[#syo1999|Schaechter 1999]]. There is a less detailed (but extensive nonetheless) English language review of this process in [[#estraikh1999|Estraikh 1999]].

The first action formally undertaken by a government was in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1920, abolishing the separate [[Etymology|etymological]] orthography for words of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] (i.e., Hebrew and Aramaic) origin. This was extended twelve years later with the elimination of the five separate final-form consonants (as indicated in the table below) which were, however, widely reintroduced in 1961. The changes are both illustrated in the way the name of the author [[Sholem Aleichem]] is written. His own work uses the form שלום־עליכם but in Soviet publication this is respelled phonetically to שאָלעמ־אלײכעמ also dispensing with the separate final-form ''mem'' and using the initial/medial form instead. This can be seen, together with a respelling of the name of the protagonist of his [[Tevye|Tevye der milkhiker]] (originally טביה, changed to טעוויע), by comparing the title pages of that work in the U.S. and Soviet editions illustrated next to this paragraph. Note also the Germanized מילכיגער (''milkhiger'') in the former exemplifying another widespread trend, ''daytshmerish'', discussed further below.

The efforts preliminary to the 1920 reform, which took place in several countries — most notably in Poland with focus on a uniform school curriculum — resulted in other devices that were not implemented as a result of any governmental mandate. These were further considered during the 1930s by the ''Yidisher visnshaftlekher institut'', [[YIVO]] ([[#yivo1930|YIVO 1930]]). This led to the development of their תּקנות פֿון ייִדישן אויסלייג  (''takones fun yidishn oysleyg'' - "Rules of Yiddish Orthography"), also known as the "SYO" (''Standard Yiddish Orthography'') or the "YIVO Rules" (1st edition [[#yivo1935|YIVO 1935]], current edition  [[#syo1999|SYO 1999]]). This has become the most frequently referenced such system in present-day use. Although it regularly figures in pedagogical contexts, it would be misleading to suggest that it is similarly dominant elsewhere. Other orthographies are frequently encountered in contemporary practice and are house standards for many publishers.

A useful review of this variation is provided in the Oxford University כלל־תקנות פון יידישן אויסלייג  (''klal takones fun yidishn oysleyg'' - "Standard Rules of Yiddish Orthography") ([[#oxford1992|Oxford 1992]] and [http://www.dovidkatz.net/dovid/PDFStylistics/1992.pdf available online]), written in and codifying a more conventional orthography than the one put forward by YIVO. Differences in the systems can be seen simply by comparing the titles of the two documents but they differ more fundamentally in their approaches to the [[prescription and description]] of orthographic detail. The former treats orthographic variation as a positive attribute of the Yiddish literature and describes essential elements of that variation. The latter presents a uniform Yiddish orthography, based on observed practice but with proactive prescriptive intent. Strong difference of opinion about the relative merit of the two approaches has been a prominent aspect of the discussion from the outset and shows little sign of abating. Although the Yiddish alphabet as stated in the SYO is widely accepted as a baseline reference (with a few minor but frequently encountered variations), the spelling and phonetics of the YIVO system of [[Romanization|romanized transliteration]] discussed below, remain subjects of particular contention. The intent of the SYO is not to describe the spectrum of traditional orthographic practice. The bulk of Yiddish literature predates the formulation of those rules and the discrepancies are significant.

==Transliteration==
A few Yiddish letters and letter combinations are pronounced quite differently in the various [[Yiddish dialects]]. Whatever impact this may have on the discussion of standardized orthography, it becomes a significant factor when Yiddish is [[Transliteration|transliterated]] into other scripts. It is entirely possible to assign a specific character or sequence of characters in, for example, the [[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]] to a specific character or character sequence in the Yiddish alphabet. The transliterated form will, however, be pronounced in a manner that appears natural to the reader. A choice therefore needs to be made about which of the several possible pronunciations of the Yiddish word is to be conveyed prior to its transliteration, with parallel attention to the phonemic attributes of the target language.

The romanization of Yiddish has been a focus of scholarly attention in Europe since the early 16th century. A detailed review of the various systems presented through the 17th century, including extensive source excerpts, is provided in [[#frakes2007|Frakes 2007]]. The Harkavy treatise cited above describes a late 19th-century system that is based on the pronunciation of the Northeastern Yiddish dialect, [[Lithuanian Jews|Litvish]], for an [[English language|anglophone]] audience. This was also a mainstay of the standardization efforts of YIVO, resulting in the romanization system described in detail below. The Harkavy and YIVO initiatives provide a convenient framework within which intervening developments may be considered. There was significant debate about many aspects of that sequence, including the need for any form of standardized orthography at all ([[#fishman1981|Fishman 1981]]).

The outright replacement of Hebrew script with Roman script in the native representation of written Yiddish was briefly considered. This had no impact on mainstream orthography but a number of Yiddish books are currently available in romanized editions. These include Yiddish dictionaries, a context in which consistent and phonetically tenable transliteration is essential.

There is no general agreement about the [[Romanization of Hebrew|transliteration of Hebrew]] into the Roman alphabet. The Hebrew component of a Yiddish text will normally reflect the transliterator's preference without being seen as a component of the methodology applied to the romanization of words presented in the phonemic orthography.

==Transcription==
A transliteration system uses one script to represent another as closely as possible. It will normally permit unambiguous conversion back and forth between the two scripts. Where the intent is to indicate phonetic variation, some form of [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] will be required. This is frequently done by using the International Phonetic Alphabet ([[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]). There are also many contexts in which phonetic distinctions are indicated by the diacritical marking of the base characters, or through the similar use of some alternate script that is familiar to the intended audience. These approaches are all also seen in native Yiddish texts, where distinctions that cannot be directly represented with the basic Yiddish script but do need to be highlighted, are indicated by using additional Hebrew diacritical marks, with Roman letters, or with the IPA.

There is no intrinsic reason why a transcription scheme cannot also be used for transliteration. In general, however, there is no expectation that the representation of a word in the source script can be retrieved from a transcription. Its purpose is to indicate how a word is pronounced, not its native orthography.

The table in the following section indicates two alternatives each for romanized transliteration and phonetic transcription. It is keyed to the Yiddish character repertoire as codified by YIVO. Other transliteration systems are also regularly employed in a variety of contexts but no single one of them represents the full range of variant pronunciation in Yiddish dialects. Nor is the YIVO system equally appropriate phonetically to all languages using Roman script. This issue becomes particularly intricate when dealing with older texts where little is known about pronunciation, and transmitting the fullest possible detail of their notation is historically important. There are several approaches to the romanization of such material. The YIVO transliteration system is solely intended to serve as an English-oriented phonetic counterpart to the [[Yiddish phonology|modern Standard Yiddish]] described (and to some extent prescribed) in the SYO. That work does, however, consider the transcription of variant pronunciation as will be discussed below.

YIVO published a major study of the range of Yiddish phonetic variation in ''The Language and Cultural Atlas of Ashkenazic Jewry'', commonly referred to as the  [[#lcaaj|LCAAJ]]. This uses a detailed system of marked Roman characters and [[Prosody (linguistics)|suprasegmental]] marks to indicate that variation, and does not apply standard YIVO transliteration at all. Although the full phonetic transcription scheme is not amenable to presentation in the table below, its core elements have been included. This scheme has been used by later authors to indicate "phonetic transcription" and is labelled in that manner here. One recent example of this is provided in [[#jacobs2005|Jacobs 2005]]. Another transcription system frequently cited in academic contexts was devised and presented (in German) by [[Solomon Birnbaum]] in [[#birnbaum1918|Birnbaum 1918]] and used in his later German works, as well as his English publication [[#birnbaum1979|Birnbaum 1979]]. This was intended to provide extreme flexibility in the representation of differences between dialects but failed to gain further practical acceptance due to its intricacy and idiosyncratic appearance (illustrated by Birnbaum's own transcription of a passage from Sholem Aleichem's, ''Shprintse'': "''Vaaihii haaiym, tréft zex a maasy, éiryv śvjjys iz dus gyvéin, kjm ex cj fuurn mit a bisl milexiks cj ainy fjn maany koinytys, a ijngy almuuny jn a raaxy fjn iékaterinoslav, vus is gykjmyn cj fuurn mit ir ziindl, aronćik haist er, kain boiberik ifn zjmer''", which in YIVO transliteration is, "''Vayehi hayoym, treft zikh a mayse, erev-shvues iz dos geven, kum ikh tsu forn mit a bisel milkhigs tsu eyner fun mayne kundes, a yunge almone un a raykhe fun katerineslav, vos iz gekumen tsu forn mit ihr zundl, arontshik heyst er, keyn boyberik oyfn zumer''").

==The Yiddish alphabet==
This table lists the Yiddish alphabet as described in the [[Uriel Weinreich]] ''English–Yiddish–English Dictionary'' ([[#weinreich1968|Weinreich 1968]]), with a few variants that may be seen in readily available literature. The YIVO romanizations are taken from the same source, where they are presented as "sound equivalents". The romanizations indicated in [[#harkavy1898|Harkavy 1898]] are included for comparison. The IPA transcriptions correspond to the examples provided by YIVO&lt;ref&gt;YIVO, [http://yivo.org/about/index.php?tid=57&amp;aid=275 IPA transcriptions]&lt;/ref&gt; (with a few additional variants). The  transcriptions in the following column were extrapolated from the LCAAJ. It is important to note that the elements of the two transcription systems appear in this table as appropriate to the standard pronunciation discussed under the next heading. The same elements, particularly those indicating vowels and [[diphthong]]s, are associated with other Yiddish letters when other pronunciations are being transcribed.

The table also includes several [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] and a [[Trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]] that are standard elements of the Yiddish [[writing system]]. They appear here in normal [[Collation|alphabetic order]] but are commonly collated separately at the end of a listing of the basic single-character alphabet.

==The Standard Yiddish Orthography==
The SYO is presented in Yiddish, and a few romanized transcriptions are included only where needed to indicate variant pronunciation. Given that the YIVO standardization initiative has been severely criticized for failing to accommodate such variation, it may be worth noting that the SYO explicitly references the three major branches of Eastern Yiddish — ''Litvish'' (Northern), ''Poylish'' (Central), and ''Ukrainish'' (Southern), as developed in the regions centered on present-day Lithuania/Belarus, Poland, and Ukraine/Moldova. The SYO gives dialect-specific romanized equivalents for the following characters:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
! '''Symbol''' !!  '''Litvish''' !! '''Poylish''' !! '''Ukrainish''' !! '''Name'''
|-
| align=center | {{lang|yi|2=&lt;span style="font-size:200%"&gt;ו&lt;/span&gt;}}
| align=center | u
| align=center | i
| align=center | i
| align=center | ''vov'' 
|-
| align=center | {{lang|yi|2=&lt;span style="font-size:200%"&gt;יי&lt;/span&gt;}}
| align=center | ej
| align=center | aj
| align=center | ej
| align=center | ''tsvey yudn''
|-

| align=center | aj
| align=center | ā
| align=center | aj
| align=center | ''pasekh tsvey yudn''
|}

A few further romanized equivalents are provided but do not indicate dialectal differences. These are identical to what is contained in the table in the preceding section, with the following exceptions:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 1em auto 1em auto"
! '''Symbol''' !!  '''Romanization''' !! '''Name''' !! '''Note'''
|-
| align=center | {{lang|yi|2=&lt;span style="font-size:200%"&gt;כ&lt;/span&gt;}}

|-
| align=center | {{lang|yi|2=&lt;span style="font-size:200%"&gt;ש&lt;/span&gt;}}
| align=center | š
| align=center | ''shin''
| align=center |
|}

YIVO took Litvish as the [[Standard language|standard dialect]] with only slight modification, to a large extent because of the consistency with which its phonemic attributes could be represented by a standardized orthography similarly requiring only minimal elaboration of traditional practice. The important distinctions between Litvish, Poylish, and Ukrainish are therefore not indicated in either the SYO or Weinreich dictionary. These are, however, discussed in detail in the LCAAJ to which Uriel Weinreich was a major contributor. The Roman characters appearing in the SYO correspond to those used in the LCAAJ, and their marking according to Central European orthographic convention provides greater flexibility in notating dialectal distinction than does an English-oriented approach. Phonetic transcription is therefore common in linguistic discourse about Yiddish, often using a wide range of diacritical marks in clear contrast to the totally undecorated YIVO romanization.

The SYO listing of the Yiddish alphabet (which predates the Weinreich dictionary) explicitly states that the vowels with combining points, and the ''vov'' and ''yud'' digraphs, are not counted as separate letters, nor are the additional consonant digraphs and trigraphs listed at all:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div dir="rtl"&gt;
{{Hebrew|1=&lt;span style="line-height:normal"&gt;דער סדר פֿון אותיות אין אַלף־בית איז אַזאַ׃ א, ב, בֿ, ג, ד, ה, ו, ז, ח, ט, י, כּ, כ (ך), ל, מ (ם), נ (ן), ס, ע, פּ, פֿ (ף), צ (ץ), ק, ר, ש, שׂ, תּ, ת

אַ, אָ, וּ, וו, וי, יִ, יי, ײַ רעכענען זיך ניט פֿאַר קײן באַזונדערע אותיות אין אַלף־בית &lt;/span&gt;}}
&lt;/div&gt;

''The order of the letters in the alphabet is as follows [from right to left]:''
&lt;div dir="rtl"&gt;
{{Hebrew|1=&lt;span style="line-height:normal"&gt;א, ב, בֿ, ג, ד, ה, ו, ז, ח, ט, י, כּ, כ, (ך), ל, מ, (ם), נ, (ן), ס, ע, פּ, פֿ, (ף), צ, (ץ), ק, ר, ש, שׂ, תּ, ת &lt;/span&gt;}}
&lt;/div&gt;

{{Hebrew|אַ}}&amp;lrm;'', ''{{Hebrew|אָ}}&amp;lrm;'', ''{{Hebrew|וּ}}&amp;lrm;'', ''{{Hebrew|וו}}&amp;lrm;'', ''{{Hebrew|וי}}&amp;lrm;'', ''{{Hebrew|יִ}}&amp;lrm;'', ''{{Hebrew|יי}}&amp;lrm;'', ''{{Hebrew|ײַ}}'' are not counted as separate letters in the alphabet.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Common variation==
[[Image:KJ bus stop sign.jpg|thumb|Yiddish transliteration of text on bus stop signs in [[Kiryas Joel, New York]]. This is completely unpointed; for example ''stop'' is written סטאפ rather than {{Hebrew|סטאָפּ}}.]]
There are several areas in which Yiddish orthographic practice varies. One of them is the extent to which pointing is used to avoid ambiguity in the way a word may be read. This ranges from unpointed text, through a small number of pointed characters, to the redundant use of the full system of Hebraic vowel pointing. Text being prepared for print generally uses a certain amount of pointing. In other contexts, however, there is an increasing tendency to forgo it entirely.

The most frugal application of pointing is the distinction of ''pey'' and ''fey'' by enclosing a dot in the former (further details below). Immediately beyond that is the differentiation of the ''komets alef'' from the unpointed form and then the further use of the ''pasekh alef''. Where additional points are applied, there can be significant variation in their number and disposition and there are often internal inconsistencies in a single system. (The belief that this variation was an impediment to the recognition of Yiddish as a literary peer to the other major European languages was a primary driving force toward the development of orthographic norms.)

A detailed generalized description of the pointing of Yiddish text is given in [[#harkavy1898|Harkavy 1898]] and the topic is also treated briefly in the SYO (which otherwise simply declares the prescribed characters). A more extensive character repertoire is presented and discussed in [[#birnbaum1918|Birnbaum 1918]].

Although consonants are basically represented in the same manner, the indication of vowels differs more widely. One noteworthy situation that does pertain to the representation of consonants is the indication of phonetic distinctions between each of the four character pairs ''beys/veys'', ''kof/khof'', ''pey/fey'', and ''tof/sof''.  The 'hard' ([[plosive]]) pronunciation of the first letter in each pair is unequivocally denoted by a dot (''[[dagesh]]'') in the middle of the letter. The 'soft' ([[fricative]]) pronunciation is similarly notated with a horizontal bar over the letter (''[[Rafe (diacritic)|rafe]]''). Most orthographic systems usually only point one of the two characters in a pair but may be inconsistent from pair to pair in indicating the hard or soft alternative. Text that otherwise conforms to the SYO therefore frequently omits the ''rafe'' from ''fey'', in harmonization with its unpointed final form, and makes the contrastive distinction from a ''pey'' solely with a ''dagesh'' in the latter ({{Hebrew|פ&amp;nbsp;פּ}}). The similar avoidance of the ''rafe'' and preferential use of the ''dagesh'' is a common alternative for the contrastive distinction between ''beys'' and ''veys'' ({{Hebrew|ב&amp;nbsp;בּ}}), although in Yiddish, because ''beys'' is used much more than ''veys'', with ''veys'' limited to words of Semitic origin, the ''dagesh'' is avoided and ''rafe'' used instead.

The ''rafe'' is an attribute of earlier Yiddish orthographic tradition and the ''dagesh'' is an adaptation of what is more generally a Hebrew practice. This also applies to the alternatives for indicating the distinction between ''yud'' when used as a consonant or as a vowel. There is a related need for marking the boundary between a ''yud'' and ''tsvey yudn'' where they appear adjacent to each other and, again, in the corresponding situation with ''vov'' and ''tsvey vovn''. A dot under a ''yud'' (''khirik yud'') and to the left of a ''vov'' (''melupm vov'') unambiguously indicates the vocalic form of those letters. Harkavy does not use these pointed forms in the main table above, being among the details codified in the early 20th century. In the traditional Yiddish orthographies where these letters are not pointed, the vowel is indicated by preceding it with a ''shtumer alef'' (reducing the use of which was a major focus of the normative efforts). The single and digraph forms of, for example, ''vov'' can be separated either with a dot or an embedded ''alef'' as {{Hebrew|וווּ}} or {{Hebrew|וואו}} (''vu'' - "where"). Although only the former spelling is consistent with the SYO and appears in Uriel Weinreich's dictionary, he uses the unpointed alternative exclusively in his own "Say it in Yiddish" ({{ISBN|0-486-20815-X}}), a phrase book that contains the word in a large number of "Where is...?" queries and was published when the rules had already been well established.

A further graphic example of this distinction is seen in the official announcement, on 14 November 1997, of a change in editorial policy for the prominent Yiddish periodical, [http://yiddish.forward.com/ {{Hebrew|פֿאָרווערטס}}] (''forverts'' - "Yiddish Forward"). It was first during that year that they adopted the YIVO orthography. The previous editorial position overtly opposed any such change and the following is included in the explanation of the shift (quoted in full in [[#syo1999|Schaechter 1999]], p.&amp;nbsp;109):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div align="right"&gt;
{{Hebrew|1=&lt;span style="line-height:normal"&gt; און דערנאָך האָבן מיר באַזײַטיקט דעם אלף אין די ווערטער ייד און יידיש (פֿריער איד און אידיש), ייִנגל (פֿריער אינגל); און איצט וועלן די ווערטער געשריבן ווערן מיט אַ חיריק אונטערן צווייטן יוד, װי׃ ייִד, ייִדיש, ייִנגל &lt;/span&gt;}}
&lt;/div&gt;

And then we removed the ''alef'' in the words {{Hebrew|ייד}} [''yid''] and {{Hebrew|יידיש}} [''yidish''] (previously {{Hebrew|איד}} and {{Hebrew|אידיש}}) and  {{Hebrew|ייִנגל}} [''yingl''] (previously {{Hebrew|אינגל}}), and now will spell the words with a ''khirik'' under the second ''yud'' as: {{Hebrew|ייִדיש}}&amp;lrm;, {{Hebrew|ייִד}} and {{Hebrew|ייִנגל}}.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The appearance of three alternate spellings for the name of the Yiddish language in a statement intended to describe its orthographic standardization might not require any comment if it were not for the clear indication that the cardinal representation — {{Hebrew|יידיש}} — was neither the older nor the newer editorial preference. Regardless of the intent of that statement, a word-initial ''yud'' is consonantal and an adjacent ''yud'' is vocalic in all Yiddish orthographic systems, as is the constraint on a word initial ''tsvey yudn'' diphthong. Pointing the second ''yud'' in {{Hebrew|ייִדיש}} is therefore, indeed, redundant. The spelling {{Hebrew|אידיש}} also illustrates some of the dialectic breadth of the Yiddish language, the name of which is both written and pronounced with and without an initial consonant. It may also be useful to note that in earlier texts, a single ''vov'' in word-initial position was often used to indicate {{IPAslink|f}}.

Finally, letters other than ''shtumer alef'' may be used as silent indications of syllable boundaries and in compound consonants, as well as for extending the length of an adjacent vowel. This became particularly common in deliberately Germanized orthographies dating from the late 19th century, collectively termed ''daytshmerish''. Its most obvious further attributes are the heavy use of double consonants where traditional orthography uses single ones, and the gratuitous substitution of German vocabulary for established Yiddish words. The desire to reverse that trend was another of the reasons for the effort toward orthographic standardization.

Publishers of Yiddish newspapers have, however, been particularly conservative in their attitude toward that development and the preceding editorial statement in ''Forverts'' provides a useful capsule summary of the details about which opinions differed. Other current Yiddish newspapers and magazines retain the spelling {{Hebrew|אידיש}} and many elements of ''daytshmerish''. This is typified in {{Hebrew|דער&amp;nbsp;איד}} ("[[Der Yid|Der&amp;nbsp;Yid]]"), which is one of several weekly [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s — others being {{Hebrew|דער&amp;nbsp;בּלאט}} ("[[Der Blatt|Der&amp;nbsp;Blatt]]") and {{Hebrew|די&amp;nbsp;צייטונג}} (''di&amp;nbsp;tsaytung'' - "News Report"&lt;!-- the English title in the publication's own banner --&gt;) — that all adhere to the earlier orthography and are in wider circulation and of substantially greater length than the [[broadsheet]] ''Forverts''. It may also be seen in the online version of the [http://www.algemeiner.net/generic.asp?id=3994 {{Hebrew|אַלגעמיינער&amp;nbsp;זשורנאַל}}] (''algemeyner&amp;nbsp;zhurnal'' - [[Algemeiner Journal]]), as well as in its printed edition. Extensive additional source material relevant to the stance of the daily press on orthographic reform is provided in [[#fishman1981|Fishman 1981]].

Editorial acceptance of varying orthographies is a general characteristic of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] publication, and a single work written by multiple authors may differ in that regard from section to section depending on the preferences of the individual contributors or the typographic context. One example of the latter situation is the use of the pointed forms of ''alef'' only in specific instances where they are deemed necessary to avoid misreading. (As may be noted with the preceding discussion of the spelling of {{Hebrew|ייִדיש}}, and the pointing of both ''fey'' and ''pey'', the SYO contains some redundant elements.) The online manifestation of such orthographic heterogeneity can readily be seen in the [[Yiddish Wikipedia]]. This is an expansive aspect of contemporary Yiddish publication and will require detailed accommodation in future codifications of orthographic practice.

==Graphic innovation==
Orthographic reform as considered here, embraces two distinct actions. The first is concerned with the way Yiddish words are spelled, as illustrated in the preceding section with the name of the language itself. The second relates to the graphic devices used to distinguish, for example, between א when representing what in English is an /a/ and when representing an /o/. The pointed אַ and אָ came into use for that purpose in the mid-18th century and were thus well established by the time the 20th century reforms were initiated, as were several other traditional Yiddish pointings. The most deeply entrenched of these was the distinction between פ ''fey'' and פּ ''pey''. YIVO proposed the additional use of pointed letters that were not in the Yiddish (or Hebrew) fonts of the day. This is a frequently cited reason for the SYO being slow to gain acceptance, but regardless of any opinion about their utility, most of the graphic elements introduced in that manner are now readily available. (The SYO explicitly states that pointing to disambiguate vowels does not change the identity of the base character; a pointed alef, for example, is not a letter of its own.)

The first edition of the SYO was preceded by a collection of essays published by YIVO in 1930 entitled, "A Standard of Yiddish Spelling; Discussion No. 1" (דער איינהייטלעכער יידישער אויסלייג — ''der eynheytlekher yidisher oysleyg'', [[#yivo1930|YIVO 1930]]). Neither the title of this work, nor its contents, were written using the conventions that YIVO was subsequently to put forward on its basis. The pivotal essay in the 1930 collection was written by [[Max Weinreich]]. His, "A Projected Uniform Yiddish Orthography" ([[#weinreich1930|Weinreich 1930]]), was not written with the pointing that was to be prescribed in the SYO and introduces a character that was entirely absent from the previous repertoire. This is the V-shaped [[grapheme]] on the second line of that text, replacing the ''tsvey vovn'' in Weinreich's name, and in the name of the city where the work was published, Vilna. It appears at numerous additional places in the text and in two other essays in the same collection but did not appear in any subsequent printed work. It was, however, included in the SYO as a recommendation for use in handwritten text, where it is also encountered. Yudl Mark, who authored one of the other 1930 essays in which the [[Typesetting|typeset]] form was used, was later to dub this character the ''shpitsik maksl'' ("acute Maxy"), and it remains enshrined in the YIVO logotype.

Further orthographic variation is seen in other YIVO publications from the same period, also using markings that were not included in the SYO, but which did have typographic precedent (for example, אֵ to represent /e/). The way in which the ''pasekh tsvey yudn'' are set in the heading of the Weinreich article (in his name) is discussed below.

&lt;div id="digital_text"&gt;

==Computerized text production==
{{see also|Unicode and HTML for the Hebrew alphabet}}

There are orthographic alternatives in the digital representation of Yiddish text that may not be visually apparent but are of crucial importance to computer applications that compare two sequences of characters to determine if they match exactly. Examples of this are [[database]] queries and [[spell checker]]s. Situations where differing representations of typographically similar characters can give unexpected or incorrect results are described below. This may prove a particular concern for Internet users as Yiddish is increasingly used in [[Internationalized domain name|Internationalized Domain Names]], and in Web and e-mail addresses.

Some mobile clients only provide limited support for typing pointed text, restricting the range of available characters for such things as [[instant messaging]] and other forms of spontaneous digital text. Even people who are skilled in using laptop or desktop keyboards for that purpose (which also requires some erudition) are subject to this constraint. This fuels the move toward unpointed text and is illustrated in the blog,  [http://blogs.yiddish.forward.com/yiddish-with-an-aleph/ Yiddish with an alef]. This is of particular note given the late acceptance of the SYO by its parent publication, [[The Jewish Daily Forward]], discussed below.

There are also problems specific to the display of pointed Hebrew text in Wikipedia articles. These are discussed in detail at [[Wikipedia:Niqqud]].

===Digraphs===
There are two different ways in which each of the digraphs ''tsvey vovn'', ''vov yud'', and ''tsvey yudn'' can be typed on Yiddish and Hebrew keyboards (which are both commonly used for the production of Yiddish text). If the digraph appears on a single key, as is normal in a Yiddish keyboard layout, pressing that key will produce a single-character [[Ligature (typography)|ligature]]. In the [[Unicode]] code chart the HEBREW LIGATURE YIDDISH DOUBLE VAV appears in position U+05F0, the HEBREW LIGATURE YIDDISH VAV YOD at U+05F1, and the HEBREW LIGATURE YIDDISH DOUBLE YOD at U+05F2 (where the "U+" indicates that the numerical position of the character in the Unicode chart is given by following four [[hexadecimal]] digits).

These ligatures are, however, frequently missing from Hebrew keyboards — a characteristic inherited from the similarly differentiated Yiddish and Hebrew typewriter layouts. A separate ''vov yud'' was, however, not provided on either. Hebrew typewriters were modified specifically for Yiddish by the replacement of the first two keys in the second row, which were used for punctuation marks, with one shifting key for "''tsvey yudn/tsvey vovn''" and another for "''komets alef/pey''" (with ''dagesh''). This can be seen on a typewriter that belonged to the Yiddish author [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] [http://singer100.com/exhibition/]. Typewriters built directly for Yiddish include the same four additional characters in different positions, as can be seen on another typewriter that belonged to Singer [http://www.newyorker.com/images/2007/06/11/p465/070611_staley04_p465.jpg]. The salient difference between the two designs is that each key on the Yiddish typewriter produces one character only, available in two different sizes through shifting.

As a result of the widespread practice of writing Yiddish on Hebrew keyboards and other legacy effects of the variant digraph forms on both modified Hebrew and native Yiddish typewriters, when Yiddish text is entered from a computer keyboard with single-key digraphs, many people nonetheless type the digraphs as two-key combinations, giving the corresponding two-letter sequences (''tsvey vovn'' U+05D5 U+05D5; ''vov yud'' U+05D5 U+05D9; ''tsvey yudn'' U+05D9 U+05D9). Although ligatures can be appropriate in [[Monospaced font|monospaced]] typewritten text, other than in the smallest type sizes they rarely appear in proportional typesetting, where the elements of a digraph are normally [[Tracking (typography)|letterspaced]] as individual characters (illustrated in Max Weinreich's name in the facsimile text in the preceding section). It may be of further interest to note that a useful, albeit highly colloquial, test of whether digraphs are regarded as single or double characters is provided by the way they appear in [[crossword puzzle]]s. In Yiddish, each element of a digraph is written in its own square (and the same practice applies to other word games where letters are allocated to positions of fixed width in a regular array).

The pointed digraph ''pasekh tsvey yudn'' can also be typed in different ways. The one is simply to enter a [[Precomposed character|precomposed]] ''pasekh tsvey yudn'', which is both displayed and stored as a single character ײַ (U+FB1F). The second option is to enter the ''tsvey yudn'' ligature as a base character and then to enter a combining ''pasekh'' for display together with it. Although appearing to be a single character ײַ, it is stored digitally as two separate characters (U+05F2 U+05B7). These two forms can only be directly entered from a keyboard on which the ligature appears. As a result, a practice is developing where ''pasekh tsvey yudn'' are indicated by enclosing a ''pasekh'' between the elements of a two-character digraph. The ''pasekh'' aligns correctly only with the first ''yud'' (subject to conditions described in the next section) but the display is tolerably that of a fully marked digraph יַי and in some display environments may be indistinguishable from one or both of the previous alternatives. However, this option requires the storage of three separate characters (U+05D9 U+05B7 U+05D9). As a fourth alternative, albeit the least stable typographically, the second of two consecutive ''yudn'' may be pointed ייַ (U+05D9 U+05D9 U+05B7). A ''pasekh yud'' is otherwise not part of any established Yiddish character repertoire, and its use in this context manifests conditions that are specific to computerized typography. The four possible representations of the ''pasekh tsvey yudn'' thus have even greater potential for causing confusion than do the other digraphs. A further potentially confusing option specific to computerized text production, but not a component of any Yiddish orthographic tradition, is the combination of a ''khirik'' with a ''tsvey yudn'' ligature to represent the consonant-vowel sequence ''yud'' — ''khirik yud'', as ײִ (U+05F2 U+05B4) rather than the correct ייִ (U+05D9 U+05D9 U+05B4).

===Combining marks===
Fonts that support Hebrew script do not always correctly render the combining points that are specific to Yiddish (and in many cases have general difficulty with Hebrew marks). Some applications display extraneous blank space adjacent to a letter with such a mark, and the mark may be displayed in that space rather than properly positioned with the base character. Writing text for presentation in a reading environment that has unknown font resources  — as will almost invariably be the case with [[HTML]] documents — thus needs special care. Here again, this is not simply a matter of typographic preference. The disjunction of combining and base characters can easily lead to error when character sequences are copied from one application into another.

The same alternative modes of entry that are illustrated above with the ''pasekh tsvey yudn'' are available for all of the other pointed characters used in Yiddish, with largely indistinguishable visual results but with differing internal representations. Any such character that appears on either a physical or a [[virtual keyboard]] will normally be recorded as a two-character sequence consisting of the base character followed by the combining mark. If a graphic character selector is used that does not emulate a keyboard, the desired character will be chosen from a table on the basis of its appearance. Since such facilities display combining marks separately from base characters, it is likely that the precomposed character form of a character will be the more readily recognized of the alternatives.

Most applications will accept either form of input, but frequently [[Text normalization|normalize]] it to the combining characters. There are, however, some applications that normalize all input to precomposed characters. Digital texts containing the combining, and the precomposed alternatives are therefore both encountered. An example of extensive text using precomposed characters is provided by the online edition of the periodical [http://lebnsfragn.com לעבּנס־פֿראַגן] (''lebns-fragn'' - "Life Questions").

The present article was written using combining characters with the exception of the second row in the following table, which is provided to illustrate the differences between the two forms. In a viewing environment prone to the misalignment of base characters with their combining marks, precomposed characters are more likely to be typographically stable (but may cause greater difficulty in other regards).

|}

===Punctuation===
The punctuation marks used to indicate sentence structure — the comma, period, colon, and semicolon — are the same in Yiddish as they are in English. The punctuation used for the abbreviation, contraction, and concatenation of words — the apostrophe and hyphen — are conceptually similar but typographically distinct in a manner that, yet again, can cause confusion when represented digitally. This can be illustrated with the contraction for {{lang|yi|עס איז}} (''es iz'' = "it is"), which is {{lang|yi|ס׳איז}} (''s'iz'' = "it's"). Although the Yiddish punctuation mark is termed an {{lang|yi|אַפּאָסטראָף}} (''apostrof'') the character used to represent it is the Hebrew ''[[geresh]]'', which differs both in its graphic appearance and, more importantly, in its digital representation. (The APOSTROPHE is U+0027, and the HEBREW PUNCTUATION GERESH is U+05F3.)  What is termed a double apostrophe is used to indicate abbreviation through the removal of several consecutive letters. For example, {{lang|yi|דאָקטאָר}} (''doktor'' = "doctor") is abbreviated {{lang|yi|ד״ר}} (equivalent to "Dr."). The punctuation mark is, however, not the QUOTATION MARK (U+0022), but the HEBREW PUNCTUATION [[Gershayim|GERSHAYIM]] (U+05F4), which is the [[dual number|dual]] form of the word ''geresh''.

Yiddish words are also hyphenated in a manner that is directly comparable to English punctuation. The character used to indicate it is, however, not the HYPHEN-MINUS (U+002D), but the HEBREW PUNCTUATION MAQAF (U+05BE). The latter character appears as the horizontal mark flush with the top of the text in {{lang|yi|מאַמע־לשון}} (''mame-loshn'' - "mother tongue"; the common vernacular designation for the Yiddish language). Typeset text may also indicate hyphenation with a character resembling an equal sign, sometimes in an oblique variant, but this is uncommon in digital text.

The distinctions between ''geresh - gershayim - maqaf'' and "apostrophe - quotation mark - hyphen" are always indicated correctly in typeset material (with exception for the occasional deliberate use of the hyphen instead of the maqaf). All characters in the first group are, however, not directly available on many Hebrew or Yiddish keyboards, and any that is lacking is commonly replaced by the corresponding character in the second group. Here again, in situations that depend on the correct matching of character sequences, the fall-back representation of a punctuation mark may not match the stored target of a database query, without the reason for the failure being apparent to a non-specialist user.

Paired characters such as parentheses, brackets, and quotation marks, which are typographically mirrored  —  &lt;span style="font-family:serif; font-size:larger"&gt;(&amp;nbsp;)   [&amp;nbsp;]   {&amp;nbsp;}   “&amp;nbsp;”&lt;/span&gt;  —  are prone to incorrect presentation in digital Yiddish text, with the opening and closing forms appearing to have exchanged places. (There are several instances in the preceding text where this problem will be apparent on systems that do not properly render mirroring characters in [[bidirectional text]].)
